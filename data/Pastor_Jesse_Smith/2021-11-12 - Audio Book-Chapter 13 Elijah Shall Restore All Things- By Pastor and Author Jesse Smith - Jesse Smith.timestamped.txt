[0:00] chapter 13 elijah shall restore all
[0:03] things
[0:04] chapter 13 contains footnotes numbers
[0:07] 1898-1972
[0:13] and jesus answered and said unto them
[0:15] elias truly shall first come and restore
[0:18] all things matthew 17 verse 11
[0:23] the subject of elijah and his shared
[0:26] anointing elisha and john the baptist
[0:28] had the spirit of elijah has both
[0:30] baffled and astounded believers for
[0:32] centuries but daniel 12 4 and revelation
[0:36] 10 verse 7 assure us the mystery of god
[0:39] will be finished in the end time god is
[0:41] obligated to reveal this mystery in our
[0:44] day because the worldwide rapture
[0:46] conditions are evident
[0:48] see chapter 12 as the final star angel
[0:51] to the laodicean age
[0:52] the mystery of elijah's anointing is
[0:54] actually part of the seventh mystery the
[0:57] seven stars
[0:58] because the final star angel to the
[1:00] laodicean age was to be an elijah
[1:03] anointed prophet
[1:06] elijah shall restore all things before
[1:08] the gentile rapture six passages of
[1:11] scripture acts 3 verses 20 and 21
[1:14] matthew 17 verses 11 and 12
[1:17] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 revelation 10
[1:20] verses 7 through 11
[1:23] amos 3 verse 7 and luke 17 verse 30
[1:27] declare an authoritative biblical truth
[1:30] about elijah's spirit in the end time
[1:33] jesus will remain in heaven and not
[1:35] physically return to the earth until all
[1:37] things
[1:39] including bible doctrines and the hearts
[1:41] of believers
[1:42] are restored to their original apostolic
[1:45] conditions by the preaching of a prophet
[1:47] anointed with the spirit of elijah
[1:51] acts 3 verses 20 and 21
[1:54] beginning here peter teaches jesus will
[1:57] remain in heaven until the times of
[1:59] restitution of all things
[2:01] in the greek restitution means
[2:04] restoration
[2:05] all things pertaining to christianity
[2:07] need restored or put back into their
[2:10] original condition
[2:11] look at modern churches and ask yourself
[2:14] do churches today resemble the churches
[2:16] in the book of acts
[2:18] of course not
[2:19] as they are lacking power holiness
[2:22] diligence truth sincerity and more joel
[2:25] 2 verse 25 agrees with god's promise to
[2:28] restore the true church back to its
[2:30] original glory i will restore
[2:34] matthew 17 verses 11 and 12
[2:37] restoration is also jesus's theme in
[2:40] matthew 17 verse 11 elias elijah truly
[2:44] shall first come and restore all things
[2:47] three points need emphasized first all
[2:50] things must be restored which agrees
[2:52] with joel and peter's restoration
[2:54] prophecies
[2:56] second jesus says elijah alone not
[2:59] elijah with moses
[3:01] is going to come and restore everything
[3:03] before jesus's millennial reign occurs
[3:06] third jesus affirms in matthew 17 verse
[3:09] 12 that john the baptist had elijah's
[3:12] spirit upon him but i say unto you that
[3:14] elias has come already and they knew him
[3:17] not but have done unto him whatsoever
[3:19] they listed
[3:21] both matthew 17 verse 12 and luke 1
[3:24] verse 17 agree john the baptist had
[3:27] elijah's spirit upon him
[3:30] putting these findings together elijah's
[3:32] anointing comes upon four other men
[3:34] besides elijah himself
[3:36] telling five total appearances of
[3:39] elijah's spirit
[3:40] elijah first kings 17 verse 1
[3:44] elisha second kings 2 verses 19-15
[3:48] the preparation elijah john the baptist
[3:52] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 with luke 1
[3:55] verse 17
[3:57] isaiah 40 verse 3
[3:59] with matthew 3 verses 1 through 3
[4:02] malachi 3 verse 1 with matthew 11 verse
[4:05] 10 and matthew 17 verses 12 and 13.
[4:10] the restoration elijah william branham
[4:13] according to malachi 4 verses 5 and 6
[4:16] matthew 17 verse 11
[4:19] luke 17 verse 30
[4:21] revelation 10 verse 7 with amos 3 verse
[4:26] 7
[4:27] elijah in the tribulation accompanied by
[4:30] moses revelation 11 verses 3 through 13.
[4:35] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6.
[4:38] this text mentions the spirit of elijah
[4:41] working in two separate ministries
[4:43] before judgment strikes the world
[4:45] before the coming of the great and
[4:47] dreadful day of the lord
[4:49] these two ministries belong to john the
[4:50] baptist and william branham
[4:53] john prepared the way for the messiah's
[4:55] first coming and branham restored the
[4:57] way for jesus's second coming
[5:00] malachi 4 verse 6 reads and he shall
[5:03] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[5:04] children and the heart of the children
[5:06] to their fathers lest i come and smite
[5:09] the earth with a curse the two
[5:11] ministries elijah's spirit fulfills are
[5:15] turning the heart of the fathers to the
[5:17] children
[5:18] and turning the heart of the children to
[5:20] the fathers
[5:22] according to luke 1 verse 17 john the
[5:24] baptist fulfilled the first ministry of
[5:27] turning the hearts of the fathers to the
[5:28] children and he shall go before him in
[5:30] the spirit and power of elias
[5:33] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[5:35] children and the disobedient to the
[5:37] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[5:39] people prepared for the lord
[5:42] john by elijah's spirit prepared the
[5:44] people for the messiah jesus by
[5:47] preaching repentance
[5:49] mark 1 verse 4 proclaims john did
[5:51] baptize in the wilderness and preach the
[5:54] baptism of repentance for the remission
[5:56] of sins
[5:57] repenting and obeying god is the
[5:59] definition of a turned heart
[6:01] romans 6 17 agrees saying but god be
[6:04] thanked that ye were the servants of sin
[6:07] but ye have obeyed from the heart that
[6:09] form of doctrine which was delivered you
[6:12] act 7 verse 39 shows a disobedient heart
[6:15] is turned back into worldliness
[6:18] to whom our fathers would not obey but
[6:20] thrust him from them and in their hearts
[6:23] turn back again into egypt
[6:27] the fathers john preached to were the
[6:29] first generation of believers who
[6:31] accepted the messiah the first
[6:34] generation included early father
[6:35] apostles
[6:36] like paul and peter
[6:38] these original apostles were deeply
[6:40] burdened for the children
[6:41] or last generation of christians who
[6:44] would see jesus's return to the earth
[6:46] and wrote about it
[6:49] john the baptist had the preparation
[6:50] ministry for the messiah preparing
[6:53] believers hearts through repentance to
[6:55] receive jesus
[6:56] malachi 3 verse 1 foretold this saying
[6:59] behold i will send my messenger and he
[7:01] shall prepare the way before me
[7:04] jesus affirmed this spoke of john in
[7:06] matthew 11 verse 10
[7:08] for this is he of whom it is written
[7:11] behold i send my messenger before thy
[7:13] face
[7:14] which shall prepare thy way before thee
[7:16] isaiah 40 verse 3 and matthew 3
[7:20] verses 1 through 3 teach the same saying
[7:23] john's voice would cry prepare ye the
[7:25] way of the lord
[7:27] but there had to come a restoration
[7:29] ministry another preacher anointed with
[7:32] elijah's spirit had to come to turn the
[7:34] hearts of the children or last
[7:36] generation of christians
[7:38] back to their fathers the first
[7:39] generation believers
[7:41] this book is one of many witnesses that
[7:43] william branham's ministry is turning
[7:46] hearts back to bible-based repentance
[7:48] and obedience
[7:50] so that end-time christians can love
[7:52] serve and understand god just like the
[7:55] early apostolic believers branham's
[7:57] bible revelations are currently
[7:59] restoring the book of acts church
[8:01] worldwide
[8:03] branham's restoration ministry is the
[8:05] former reign ministry from joel 2 verse
[8:08] 23 as former can mean teacher in hebrew
[8:12] after two decades of studying branham's
[8:14] teachings i can testify to the depths of
[8:17] sound teaching god has restored to his
[8:19] bride in every single area of doctrine
[8:23] the 12 mysteries true repentance
[8:25] salvation by grace prayer and fasting
[8:28] marriage and divorce modest appearance
[8:31] abomination still in effect two kinds of
[8:34] christians melchizedek the serpent seed
[8:37] predestination daniel's 70 weeks the
[8:41] feasts and holy days of israel ties and
[8:43] offerings torment in the lake of fire is
[8:46] not eternal
[8:47] divine healing the nine gifts of the
[8:49] spirit male only preachers male only
[8:53] angels and so much more while rejoicing
[8:56] and growing through the former reigns
[8:57] teaching we eagerly await the latter
[9:00] reign the final anointing of rapturing
[9:03] faith
[9:05] someone to delete the fourth elijah
[9:07] ministry to the gentiles and make the
[9:09] fifth elijah ministry of the tribulation
[9:12] a restoration but that would be a gross
[9:14] heir for two reasons
[9:16] first john the baptist came alone to
[9:19] turn the hearts of the apostolic fathers
[9:21] to the children in malachi 4 6 so the
[9:25] turning of the hearts of the children
[9:27] back to their apostolic fathers must be
[9:29] done by one elijah anointed man not two
[9:34] william branham came alone to turn the
[9:36] hearts of the children to the fathers
[9:38] the fifth elijah ministry of revelation
[9:40] 11 verse 3 consists of two men
[9:43] elijah and moses
[9:45] second the fifth elijah ministry during
[9:47] the tribulation is a ministry of
[9:50] judgment or torment according to
[9:52] revelation chapter 11 verse 10.
[9:55] this of course differs greatly from the
[9:57] fourth elijah ministry which brought
[9:59] restoration before the rapture
[10:02] additionally the 144 000 jews are
[10:05] restored only after jesus physically
[10:07] returns to them following the rapture of
[10:10] the two prophets
[10:11] zechariah chapter 13 verse 6 seems to
[10:14] support this because they are ignorant
[10:16] of the nail prince in jesus hands and
[10:19] his death on the cross
[10:21] what are these wounds in thine hands
[10:24] reconciliation and restoration occur
[10:26] only through the knowledge of the blood
[10:28] of jesus's cross
[10:30] according to colossians 1 verses 14 20
[10:33] and 22
[10:36] revelation 10 verses 7 through 11.
[10:40] these scriptures reveal jesus giving the
[10:42] open book formerly sealed with seven
[10:44] seals to an earthly seventh angel
[10:47] the open book's revelations are then
[10:49] taken around the world
[10:52] notice first the open book can only come
[10:54] to the earth at the end time agreeing
[10:57] with daniel 12 4
[10:59] but thou o daniel shut up the words and
[11:02] seal the book even to the time of the
[11:04] end many shall run to and fro and
[11:07] knowledge shall be increased
[11:10] revelation 10 verse 11 places this end
[11:12] time revelation at the end of the times
[11:15] of the gentiles because the open book is
[11:17] eaten and taken around the world to
[11:20] gentiles
[11:21] thou must prophesy again before many
[11:23] peoples and nations and tongues and
[11:26] kings the open book is not sent to
[11:29] israel only but to every nation under
[11:31] heaven
[11:32] revelation 10 verse 11 reveals god is
[11:35] going to finish jesus's great commission
[11:37] preached in matthew 28 verses 19 and 20
[11:40] by the loosing of the seven seals
[11:44] the seventh angel of revelation 10 7
[11:46] must be the same fourth elijah ministry
[11:49] because they both happen at the end time
[11:52] before the times of the gentiles
[11:53] finishes
[11:55] thus the seventh angel preaches during
[11:57] the seven church ages or times of the
[11:59] gentiles
[12:00] labeled as the seventh angel in
[12:02] revelation 10 7 he must be the angel of
[12:05] the church of the laodiceans
[12:07] in revelation 3 verse 14. because
[12:10] laodicea was the seventh and final
[12:12] gentile church jesus addressed
[12:16] amos 3 verse 7
[12:18] the 7th angel of revelation 10 verse 7
[12:21] must also be a prophet because amos 3
[12:24] verse 7 assures god only reveals his
[12:27] mysteries to prophets
[12:29] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[12:31] he revealeth his secret unto his
[12:33] servants the prophets branham revealed
[12:35] the secrets of these 12 bible-defined
[12:37] mysteries and also correctly foretold
[12:40] the future by the holy spirit
[12:42] sick believers were foretold of their
[12:44] healings by branham and they were well
[12:46] shortly thereafter
[12:48] brother branham correctly prophesied the
[12:50] immoral condition of the churches in the
[12:52] united states
[12:54] how no greater ministry would rise to
[12:55] the gentiles
[12:57] than what god gave to him and no
[12:59] christian denomination would return to
[13:01] an apostolic ministry
[13:03] additionally christ revealed the seven
[13:05] seals to branham the united states's
[13:07] identity position and destiny in
[13:10] revelation 13 and spoke with thus saith
[13:13] the lord regarding numerous bible
[13:15] doctrines
[13:17] luke 17 verse 30. the last of the six
[13:21] verses about god's end time restoration
[13:23] was detailed in chapter 12 under the
[13:26] section the last sign before the rapture
[13:29] the son of man ministry had to be
[13:31] revealed to the gentiles before the
[13:32] rapture and jesus anointed brother
[13:35] branham to fulfill this prophecy
[13:38] it's notable there are three r's
[13:40] emphasized in this day revelation
[13:43] restoration and rapture
[13:45] brahms ministry was the revelation of
[13:47] the son of man
[13:48] his ministry brought restoration of
[13:50] bible teachings turning hearts back to
[13:53] the apostolic fathers
[13:55] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:57] believers are ready for the rapture
[14:00] i trust you can now see the clear bible
[14:02] evidence for brother adam's ministry it
[14:05] was foretold by jesus malachi peter and
[14:08] john and witnessed by millions worldwide
[14:14] historical evidence of branham's
[14:15] restoration ministry
[14:18] historical evidence abounds for
[14:19] substantiating william branham's
[14:22] restoration ministry
[14:23] firsthand witnesses of his gifts of
[14:25] healing and discernment testify to god's
[14:28] anointing upon his life amazingly the
[14:31] pillar of fire was photographed in his
[14:32] meetings speaking with thus saith the
[14:35] lord branham spoke god's opinion on
[14:37] sound doctrine and foretold the future
[14:40] researching branham's life you will see
[14:42] the characteristics of elijah spirit
[14:44] upon the kentucky born prophet
[14:48] healings and discernment
[14:50] branham's healing ministry is legendary
[14:53] as god used it to initiate the
[14:55] post-world war ii healing revival
[14:58] although his healing campaigns began in
[15:00] 1946
[15:01] branham had been pastoring a local
[15:03] church in jeffersonville indiana since
[15:05] 1933
[15:08] met by an angel and commissioned to pray
[15:10] for the sick in may 1946 healings
[15:13] multiplied throughout his state the
[15:15] nation and then the world
[15:18] observed branham's ministry began first
[15:20] well before other evangelists because
[15:23] god himself ordained it
[15:25] oral roberts began his own healing
[15:27] campaigns in 1947 and billy graham rose
[15:30] to national acclaim in 1949
[15:34] after only four years of supernatural
[15:36] ministry over one thousand ministers
[15:38] gathered at a voice of healing
[15:40] convention in 1950 to recognize
[15:42] branham's influence on the healing
[15:44] revival
[15:45] they praised god and paid tribute to
[15:48] branham for inspiring them to start
[15:50] praying for the sick
[15:52] as moses was given two signs to prove he
[15:55] was god's deliverer god commissioned
[15:57] branham with two signs
[15:58] a sign in his hand to identify
[16:00] sicknesses and discernments to know the
[16:03] secrets of hearts
[16:04] divinely equipped the power of a branham
[16:07] service remains a legend unparalleled in
[16:10] the history of the charismatic movement
[16:13] the largest stadiums and auditoriums in
[16:15] the world were filled with worshipers
[16:17] and jesus christ mightily healed and
[16:19] saved his people branham's sign in his
[16:22] hand detected diseases when a sick
[16:24] person put their right hand into his
[16:26] left hand
[16:27] mita branham william's wife was detected
[16:30] as having a tumor on her left ovary
[16:32] around 1948 well before it caused me to
[16:36] pain
[16:37] over the next 15 years the tumor grew
[16:39] until it bulged out of meda's side
[16:42] causing her to hobble as she walked
[16:44] but in november 1963 the angel of the
[16:47] lord met branham and told him to speak
[16:49] to the tumor
[16:50] he prayed before the doctor's hand shall
[16:53] touch her the hand of god shall take the
[16:55] tumor away and it won't even be found
[16:58] so it was
[17:00] the tumor literally vanished as she sat
[17:02] in the doctor's office seconds before
[17:04] her doctor asked to touch it
[17:08] authentic healings were commonplace in
[17:10] branham's ministry guided by a vision
[17:12] branham traveled to milltown indiana to
[17:15] pray for 28 year old georgia carter
[17:18] tuberculosis had caused her to wither
[17:21] away to 50 pounds and had kept her
[17:23] bedridden for nearly 9 years
[17:26] branham grabbed her hand and called upon
[17:28] the name of the lord jesus and she was
[17:30] instantly healed she spent the rest of
[17:32] her days as the pianist at the local
[17:35] baptist church
[17:37] another saint named florence humes was
[17:39] healed of tuberculosis in 1955
[17:42] almost all hope was lost as florence
[17:45] mother of three girls was rapidly losing
[17:47] weight in a prayer line in
[17:49] campbellsville kentucky branham first
[17:51] discerned her disease then condemned
[17:54] satan in prayer and turned florence
[17:56] loose in the name of jesus christ
[17:58] florence miraculously recovered having
[18:01] five more children 25 grandchildren and
[18:04] over 40 great-grandchildren
[18:06] you can listen to the audio of this
[18:08] miraculous event online i had the
[18:11] pleasure of meeting florence before she
[18:13] passed in 2015.
[18:16] the healing of congressman william
[18:18] upshaw in 1951 remains one of the most
[18:21] powerful healing testimonies from
[18:23] branham's meetings
[18:25] after being a paraplegic for nearly 50
[18:27] years
[18:28] bound to a wheelchair and crutches
[18:30] upshaw attended branham's meeting and
[18:32] rose from his wheelchair walking in
[18:35] complete healing he preached christ the
[18:37] rest of his days
[18:38] testifying of christ's mighty power
[18:40] upshaw claimed to have sent his written
[18:43] testimony to president truman every
[18:45] senator and congressman
[18:47] king george vi
[18:48] winston churchill and even joseph stalin
[18:52] again you can listen to upshaw's own
[18:54] voice give this testimony online
[18:57] healing magazines like the voice of
[18:59] healing catalogue jesus's power in
[19:02] branham's ministry
[19:03] at branham's memorial service in january
[19:06] 1966
[19:08] the late evangelist tommy osborne well
[19:10] said
[19:11] the man we know is william branham was
[19:13] sent to demonstrate god again in the
[19:15] flesh
[19:16] branham came our way as the prophet of
[19:18] god and showed us in the 20th century
[19:21] precisely the same things that were
[19:23] shown us in the gospels
[19:25] where we read of a few incidents in the
[19:27] gospels we have seen hundreds in our
[19:29] generation no less great nor wonderful
[19:32] but far more numerous
[19:34] we have seen them in our day
[19:37] unfortunately most historians reject
[19:40] branham's teachings but gladly accept
[19:42] and praise god for the supernatural
[19:44] healings via his two signs
[19:47] the same was true of jesus's earthly
[19:48] ministry multitudes rejoiced over his
[19:51] miracles
[19:52] but many of his own disciples left his
[19:54] ministry because of his doctrine
[19:56] faithful saints accept the bible-based
[19:59] words of life jesus revealed to branham
[20:02] just as peter stayed with jesus when the
[20:04] majority left saying
[20:06] lord to whom shall we go thou hast the
[20:09] words of eternal life
[20:12] the return of the pillar of fire
[20:16] it's historically proven that the pillar
[20:17] of fire returned to vindicate brother
[20:19] branham's ministry you first learned of
[20:21] the pillar of fire or the lord in a
[20:23] visible manifestation
[20:25] leading moses and the children of israel
[20:27] as they journeyed from egypt
[20:29] the pillar of fire has to be jesus's
[20:31] spirit
[20:32] or the holy spirit for hebrews 11 verse
[20:35] 26 plainly says moses esteemed the
[20:37] reproach of christ
[20:39] the lord as the pillar of fire met moses
[20:42] to give him the ten commandments and
[20:44] also inspired him to write the
[20:45] pentateuch or the first five old
[20:47] testament books
[20:49] since the pillar of fire was visible at
[20:51] the onset of the old testament it had to
[20:53] come at the founding of the new
[20:55] acts 9 verses 3 through 6 and galatians
[20:58] 1 verse 17 point to jesus being the
[21:01] pillar of fire who met paul and later
[21:03] inspired him to write the majority of
[21:05] the new testament's foundational
[21:06] epistles
[21:09] since restoration was foretold the
[21:11] mystery of god was to be finished
[21:14] and desperately needed at the close of
[21:15] the new testament it was necessary for
[21:17] the pillar of fire to return
[21:20] overall the church was in a lukewarm
[21:21] state and couldn't understand the old or
[21:23] new testament but god promised to
[21:25] restore
[21:27] daniel 12 4 says the book would be
[21:29] sealed into the end time when jesus
[21:31] brings the open book to earth after
[21:33] loosing its seven seals as told in
[21:35] revelation 10.
[21:38] in march of 1963 the lord met branham in
[21:41] the desert
[21:42] near tucson arizona and commissioned him
[21:45] to preach the seven seals with thus
[21:46] saith the lord
[21:48] these revelations rightly divided the
[21:49] word of truth
[21:51] making the bible understandable and
[21:53] god's presence real
[21:55] once again god had visited his prophet
[21:57] in a desert to bring the word of the
[21:59] lord
[21:59] god previously met moses in the
[22:01] wilderness to inspire the writing of the
[22:03] old testament and jesus led paul to the
[22:05] arabian desert to inspire his writing of
[22:08] the new
[22:09] now god was fulfilling revelation 10 1-7
[22:12] by meeting with his prophet branham in
[22:15] the desert to finish his divine mystery
[22:19] two evidences support the spirit's
[22:20] visible return in brother branham's
[22:22] ministry
[22:23] on january 24 1950
[22:26] a picture was taken of branham at a
[22:28] debate on divine healing in houston
[22:30] texas
[22:31] sea figure 26
[22:33] above his head is the pillar of fire and
[22:35] this photo remains the most well-known
[22:37] picture of the post world war ii healing
[22:40] era
[22:41] george j lacy an official examiner of
[22:44] question documents
[22:45] verified the photo was not retouched but
[22:48] light struck the negative
[22:50] a second evidence of the visible pillar
[22:52] of fire was on january 8 1961 when the
[22:56] spirit became visible to the entire
[22:57] branham tabernacle congregation
[23:00] at the conclusion of branham's sermon
[23:02] about the book of revelation see chapter
[23:04] 7.
[23:05] audio exists from the supernatural
[23:07] occurrence
[23:09] the return of thus saith the lord
[23:12] accompanying the pillar of fire's return
[23:15] was the necessary return of a prophet
[23:17] speaking for god with the full authority
[23:20] of thus saith the lord moses spoke this
[23:22] authoritative phrase to both pharaoh and
[23:24] israel
[23:25] paul prophesied the rapture by the word
[23:28] of the lord and challenged the
[23:29] corinthians to recognize his prophetic
[23:31] authority to speak for god
[23:33] what came the word of god out from you
[23:36] or came unto you only
[23:38] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[23:40] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[23:42] the things that i write unto you are the
[23:44] commandments of the lord branham's
[23:46] picture with the pillar of fire
[23:48] validates god choosing him to speak on
[23:50] behalf of heaven with all due respect
[23:53] note that preachers like oral roberts
[23:55] and billy graham never spoke with thus
[23:57] saith the lord for they were not
[23:58] commissioned by god to do so
[24:01] both men had their gifts and positions
[24:03] but not as prophet of the lord
[24:05] modern preachers like t.d jakes and joel
[24:08] olsteen never prophesy with us saith the
[24:10] lord like brother branham did
[24:13] truly no man in recent history has
[24:15] spoken like branham in the name of the
[24:17] lord and exercised such an awesome
[24:20] unparalleled gift of discernment
[24:22] remember it's thus saith the lord will
[24:24] never see a greater gift to the gentiles
[24:26] before the rapture than branham's
[24:28] discernment gift
[24:31] open your bible and heart to receive
[24:33] these 30 statements brother branham
[24:35] spoke with the same thus saith the lord
[24:37] authority as moses and paul
[24:41] thus saith the lord regarding doctrine
[24:44] the divine presence of the pillar of
[24:46] fire in branham's meetings led him to
[24:48] preach doctrine with the authoritative
[24:50] phrase thus saith the lord
[24:52] doctrine is instruction a direct order
[24:55] or command
[24:56] this means god was speaking direct
[24:58] orders
[24:59] originally found in scripture through
[25:01] his prophet to christians of this final
[25:03] age
[25:05] while most left branham because of his
[25:06] doctrine the true bride of christ were
[25:09] and still are drawn like a magnet to his
[25:12] bible-based teachings
[25:15] the main reason believers follow
[25:17] branham's doctrines is because they are
[25:18] found in the word of god
[25:20] in my personal life i went to many
[25:22] churches and always left feeling
[25:23] disappointed and unfulfilled before
[25:26] jesus gave me my heart's desire
[25:28] with branham's bible-centered doctrines
[25:31] his bible references answered my
[25:33] questions about every aspect of my life
[25:36] i could physically point to the
[25:37] scripture in the bible providing me
[25:39] specific instructions on how to live
[25:42] i finally knew i was doing god's perfect
[25:44] will
[25:46] concerning the doctrinal mysteries in
[25:48] this book six of the twelve were
[25:50] delivered with thus saith the lord from
[25:52] god through branham
[25:54] chapter one regarding the doctrine of
[25:56] the godhead as one person and not an
[25:59] unholy trinity of three persons
[26:01] trinitarianism is of the devil i say
[26:04] that thus saith the lord look where it
[26:06] come from it come from the nicean
[26:08] council when the catholic church become
[26:10] in rulership
[26:12] the word trinity is not even mentioned
[26:14] in the entire book of the bible and as
[26:16] far as three gods that's from hell
[26:18] there's one god
[26:20] chapter two regarding the doctrine of
[26:22] israel's blindness to their own messiah
[26:24] originally taught in the fifth seal if
[26:26] you've never heard if you ever believed
[26:28] i ever said anything in a sermon
[26:30] inspired you take them tapes on the
[26:32] seven seals
[26:34] and if you ever heard anything that's
[26:35] really as i can say it's thus saith the
[26:38] lord get those
[26:40] chapter 6 regarding the doctrine of the
[26:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[26:44] i want to make myself very clear on what
[26:46] the baptism with the holy ghost is
[26:48] according to the word
[26:50] it is not according to me and it is not
[26:52] according to you
[26:53] it has to be according to thus saith the
[26:55] lord for we are falsely led amen
[26:59] chapter 7 regarding the revelations of
[27:01] the seven church ages
[27:03] now the vision plus the word plus the
[27:05] history plus the church ages and all
[27:08] blend together so i could truly say that
[27:10] to the best of my understanding and
[27:12] according to the word of god in the
[27:13] vision and the revelation the
[27:16] interpretation thereof is thus saith the
[27:18] lord chapter 9 regarding the roman
[27:21] catholic church as the mother harlot of
[27:23] revelation 17
[27:25] and then finally she
[27:26] the roman catholic church
[27:28] was the mother of harlots she gave birth
[27:31] unto churches after her because they
[27:33] couldn't have been boys they had to be
[27:35] girls
[27:36] and we find out that the protestant
[27:38] church is a product of the catholic
[27:39] church by searching the scriptures and
[27:41] looking at your history book we see that
[27:43] the protestant church is the product
[27:46] and the protestant can't holler at the
[27:47] catholic because the both says they are
[27:49] harlots and
[27:51] that's flat but that's thus saith the
[27:53] lord
[27:54] chapter 10 regarding the mystery of
[27:56] iniquity working by the antichrist
[27:58] spirit
[27:59] now but you see antichrist come in as we
[28:02] pictured it and showed it what a
[28:04] revelation my my
[28:06] and to think all these years we've seen
[28:08] it moving up and here it is it's
[28:10] absolutely directly thus saith the lord
[28:14] additionally branham highlighted eight
[28:16] individual doctrines as thus saith the
[28:18] lord with their validating scriptures
[28:21] recognizing jesus's enigma in matthew 28
[28:24] verse 19
[28:26] water baptism is to be performed in the
[28:28] literal name of jesus christ acts 2
[28:30] verse 38 acts 8 verse 16 acts 10 verse
[28:34] 48 acts 19 verse 5 and acts 22 verse 16
[28:40] rather than the titles of father son and
[28:42] holy ghost
[28:43] thus saith the lord the baptism using
[28:46] the title of father son and holy ghost
[28:48] is false
[28:49] thus saith the lord i command every one
[28:52] of you on here or on tape that hasn't
[28:54] been baptized in the name of jesus
[28:56] christ be baptized again in the name of
[28:58] jesus christ
[29:00] marriage in divorce matthew 5 32
[29:04] matthew 19 verses 3 through 13 and the
[29:07] serpent seed doctrine genesis 3 verse 15
[29:11] proverbs 30 verse 20. and here they are
[29:14] the true mystery of marriage and divorce
[29:16] and the serpent's seed and all these
[29:18] things that's been fussed about it's
[29:20] thus saith the lord what is it the
[29:22] quickening power coming to the church
[29:24] making her ready this hour that we're
[29:27] approaching quickening power
[29:30] ancient rome morphed into papal rome and
[29:33] rules the world at the end time as the
[29:35] fourth kingdom from daniel's
[29:37] interpretation of nebuchadnezzar's dream
[29:40] daniel 2 verses 40 through 43
[29:43] russia communism isn't conquering
[29:45] nothing god's word can't fail
[29:48] romanism is going to conquer the world
[29:50] let's take daniel's vision that's the
[29:52] word of god thou o daniel
[29:55] thou o king nebuchadnezzar is the head
[29:57] of gold babylon
[29:59] another kingdom will succeed thee which
[30:01] is silver see which was medes o persia
[30:05] another one was greece alexander the
[30:07] great next come in rome and there wasn't
[30:10] nothing said about a communism
[30:12] rome conquered the world
[30:14] catholic hierarchy with all the
[30:16] denominations in the world right now
[30:18] coming together as an organization
[30:20] the confederation of churches organizing
[30:22] themselves together it isn't russia it's
[30:25] rome thus saith the lord yeah show me a
[30:28] scripture where communism or anything
[30:30] else besides rome will rule
[30:33] women who purposely dress in sexy
[30:35] provocative clothes will answer for
[30:38] committing adultery because they cause
[30:40] men to lust after them
[30:42] proverbs 7 verse 10 and verse 27
[30:46] matthew 5 verse 28
[30:49] they don't know what decency means out
[30:51] here with little old tight dresses on
[30:53] and things like that and men lusting
[30:55] after them and think that they're decent
[30:58] you might not have done nothing wrong
[30:59] sister but let me tell you you're a tool
[31:01] of the devil and at the judgment bar
[31:04] thus saith the lord you'll answer for
[31:06] committing adultery and your soul will
[31:08] be gone you know better
[31:11] a woman who cuts her hair shames both
[31:13] her husband and christ and is
[31:15] spiritually dead having rejected the
[31:17] quickening or life-giving power of the
[31:19] holy ghost baptism first corinthians 11
[31:22] verses 1 through 16
[31:24] ephesians 2 verses 1 through 3. the
[31:27] woman that's a child of god lets her
[31:29] hair grow to show that she's consecrated
[31:31] to every word of god
[31:33] if she cuts it off i don't care how much
[31:35] she dances sings is in the choir speaks
[31:37] in tongues runs up and down or has all
[31:40] kinds
[31:41] of aid societies she is dead
[31:44] that's thus saith the lord the word of
[31:46] god
[31:47] branham's bible-based teachings are
[31:49] restoring god's people back to the
[31:51] fullness of pentecost joel 2 verses
[31:54] 23-26
[31:56] the people of god are being made ready
[31:58] by the word of truth from the messenger
[31:59] to this age
[32:01] in her will be the fullness of pentecost
[32:03] for the spirit will bring the people
[32:04] right back to where they were at the
[32:05] beginning
[32:06] that is thus saith the lord it is thus
[32:09] saith the lord for that is what joel 2
[32:11] verses
[32:12] 23-26 says
[32:15] the elijah messenger to the gentiles
[32:17] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6.
[32:21] the fourth ministry of elijah appeared
[32:23] in the united states in the 1960s
[32:26] god has promised malachi 4 for this last
[32:28] day and malachi 4 has not yet been
[32:31] fulfilled but it must be fulfilled
[32:33] for it is a germatized word of god
[32:36] spoken through malachi the prophet
[32:38] jesus referred to it it is to be just
[32:40] before the coming of christ the second
[32:42] time
[32:43] all scripture that has not been
[32:45] fulfilled must be before that time the
[32:47] bible is to be finished two to be
[32:50] finished
[32:51] the gentile dispensation is to be
[32:53] finished with the church age when this
[32:55] anointed messenger arrives
[32:57] of course he will plant the seed of the
[32:59] entire bible plum from the serpent to
[33:01] the messenger in the former rain
[33:03] then he will be rejected by the
[33:05] denominational people as his forefather
[33:08] john and elijah as was spoken by our
[33:10] lord
[33:11] so it's at this time in this country
[33:13] that that person will appear for it's in
[33:15] the scripture and it's thus saith the
[33:17] lord
[33:20] fulfilled prophecies and three in the
[33:22] process of coming to pass
[33:24] one qualification for being a genuine
[33:26] prophet is to foretell something in the
[33:29] lord's name and then see it come to pass
[33:32] william branham was a true prophet for
[33:34] he correctly prophesied the passing of
[33:36] florence chicarian in 1965
[33:38] and the healing of florence humes in
[33:40] 1955.
[33:42] in chicarian situation she was diagnosed
[33:45] with inoperable cancer and after seeing
[33:48] a vision of her passing branham said
[33:50] thus saith the lord their daughter
[33:51] florence is going to die while it's not
[33:54] difficult to prophesy death for a cancer
[33:56] patient the context shows its
[33:58] supernatural origin
[34:00] florence's brother demas was a famous
[34:02] minister and several friends in their
[34:05] pentecostal ranks had prophesied in the
[34:07] name of the lord that florence would be
[34:09] healed
[34:10] but with florence's passing branham's
[34:12] word from the lord was proven to be true
[34:15] even when death is certain god sometimes
[34:17] uses prophets to warn the sick of their
[34:19] deaths just as elijah foretold king
[34:23] ahaziah of his certain death in second
[34:25] kings 1 verses 1 through 17.
[34:29] humes's situation described earlier was
[34:32] just as desperate as she was noticeably
[34:34] thin dying with tuberculosis
[34:37] but god's prophet condemned satan in
[34:39] jesus christ's name and foretold her
[34:41] healing saying god bless you sister tell
[34:44] you what to do to know whether i told
[34:46] you the truth you go monday and way then
[34:50] next monday way again see what i've told
[34:53] you amen
[34:55] indeed in the name of the lord hume saw
[34:57] the prophecy come to pass she was turned
[34:59] loose being made well
[35:01] living 60 more years
[35:04] three prophecies are in the process of
[35:05] coming to pass
[35:07] with the first being his 1961 prophecy
[35:10] of no greater gift arising to the
[35:13] gentiles than the gift of discernment
[35:15] god gave him
[35:16] chapter 12 details branham's discernment
[35:18] gift in the section the last sign before
[35:21] the rapture for 60 years this prophecy
[35:24] has stood firm preachers have come and
[35:26] gone some even performing miracles but
[35:28] none have come close to the discerning
[35:30] ability to know the thoughts and intents
[35:32] of the hearts like jesus repeatedly
[35:35] performed in branham
[35:37] video exists from branham's 1954
[35:39] meetings in washington dc
[35:41] in which he told a cancer patient 15
[35:44] secrets including her name
[35:46] address
[35:47] and ailments before pronouncing her
[35:49] healing in jesus's mighty name instances
[35:52] of infallible discernments like this
[35:55] were commonplace in branham's prayer
[35:56] lines
[35:58] a second prophecy coming to pass is the
[36:01] immoral condition of american churches
[36:04] in april 1965 branham shared a symbolic
[36:07] vision with thus saith the lord in which
[36:09] a group of women represented american
[36:12] churches
[36:13] the women had bobbed hair painted faces
[36:15] were dancing to rock and roll smoking
[36:17] cigarettes and hardly wearing any
[36:19] clothes in an attempt to sexually seduce
[36:22] history shows most churches especially
[36:25] pentecostals in 1965 condemned all these
[36:28] evil practices
[36:30] recently we've seen the acceptance of
[36:31] these sins in nearly every church
[36:34] specifically the celebration of rock and
[36:36] roll
[36:37] when i shared branham's vision with my
[36:39] mother now 70 years old she admitted her
[36:42] pentecostal denomination once forbid
[36:44] rock and roll until a decade ago
[36:47] her heart broke at a recent youth
[36:49] convention as she watched young people
[36:51] dance to rock rap and more something she
[36:54] thought would never have been accepted
[36:56] in her denomination
[36:58] undoubtedly this sinful trend will only
[37:00] increase
[37:01] since it's a warning in the name of the
[37:03] lord
[37:05] the third prophecy from july 1965
[37:08] foretold the impossibility of christian
[37:10] denominations returning to the apostolic
[37:13] gospel
[37:14] and the certainty of their acceptance of
[37:16] the future pope antichrist
[37:19] god's prophet announced it's predicted
[37:21] that they're going to do it and they're
[37:23] going to do it for it's thus saith the
[37:25] lord they're going to do it you think
[37:27] them nominations will ever break up
[37:29] their denomination come back to the word
[37:32] it's thus saith the lord they won't will
[37:34] they go into the antichrist exactly it's
[37:37] thus saith the lord they will
[37:39] friend there is no hope for
[37:40] denominational systems
[37:42] in 56 years since his prophecy thundered
[37:45] out true apostolic revival has not come
[37:48] to a single denomination and never will
[37:50] come to their dead systems
[37:52] while the warning is stern god's grace
[37:55] to call out his people from organization
[37:57] is amazing revelation 18 verse 4 pleads
[38:01] with millions yet today come out of her
[38:03] my people that you be not partakers of
[38:05] her sins and that you receive not of her
[38:08] plagues
[38:10] future prophecies with thus saith the
[38:12] lord
[38:14] in divine mercy god has given us 11
[38:16] future prophecies to help us prepare for
[38:19] jesus's rapture return
[38:21] the first is driverless cars prophesied
[38:24] in 1933 but not recorded on tape until
[38:27] 1958.
[38:29] branham said
[38:30] now i said it'll come to pass
[38:32] that those cars will not be run by a
[38:34] steering wheel it'll be something
[38:36] another run
[38:38] it's them cars they're bringing out
[38:40] right now remote control for safety
[38:42] now you remember that's thus saith the
[38:44] lord it's likely waymo a sister company
[38:48] of google
[38:49] along with tesla general motors and
[38:51] other companies will help bring this
[38:53] prophecy to pass
[38:55] backslidden united states has seven
[38:58] judgment prophecies against her we are
[39:00] coming into religious persecution with
[39:02] the same things that they did in pagan
[39:04] rome many years ago forced thus saith
[39:07] the lord
[39:08] and i say this thus saith the lord the
[39:11] god that america claims to serve will
[39:13] destroy her
[39:15] this america has become condemned
[39:18] and what did she do according to the
[39:19] vision she elected the wrong person i
[39:22] don't know how long it'll take it to run
[39:24] out but it will be some day thus saith
[39:27] the lord it will she's on her downward
[39:30] move right now
[39:31] she'll never come back again she's gone
[39:34] that's right she's been gone since 1956
[39:37] when she condemned and turned away god
[39:40] from the great revival hours
[39:42] and remember thus saith the lord there
[39:45] will be a woman rule before the end time
[39:48] she'll either be president vice
[39:50] president or it'll be the catholic
[39:51] church as a woman i've seen her a great
[39:54] woman the nation bowed to her it will be
[39:56] one before the end time thus say the
[39:58] lord
[39:59] write it down and find out you young
[40:01] people see if it happens if it isn't i'm
[40:04] a false prophet
[40:06] i remember just my last message in
[40:08] california where i thought i never go
[40:10] back again when i predicted los angeles
[40:13] would go beneath the ocean thus saith
[40:15] the lord it will
[40:16] she is done she is washed she is
[40:19] finished what hour i don't know when but
[40:22] it will be sunk someday thus saith the
[40:25] holy spirit out of the word of god
[40:27] that america there had been whole
[40:30] turning god down and will receive the
[40:32] mark of the beast according to
[40:33] revelations the 13th chapter and we're
[40:36] moving into it
[40:38] the last and seventh vision was wherein
[40:40] i heard a most terrible explosion as i
[40:42] turned to look i saw nothing but debris
[40:45] craters and smoke all over the land of
[40:47] america
[40:49] along with branham's earlier prophecy
[40:51] that every denomination would take the
[40:53] mark of the beast he also described it
[40:55] as a form of unionized religion
[40:57] pertaining to labor union i know you
[41:00] work you men have labor unions and
[41:02] things that you if you want to work you
[41:04] have to belong to it that's exactly
[41:06] right
[41:07] you have to do that
[41:08] but watch it see because it's going to
[41:10] come from labor to religion one of these
[41:12] days see now you just remember it's a
[41:15] forerunner of everything becoming
[41:17] unionized
[41:18] you can't work they won't let you on the
[41:21] job your your scab unless you unless you
[41:23] belong to this union
[41:25] now remember you young people remember
[41:27] what brother branham's saying
[41:29] and may my words be engraved
[41:31] with an iron pen in a mountain of steel
[41:34] thus saith the lord that same thing will
[41:36] happen in religion you'll belong to a
[41:38] denomination of some sort or you cannot
[41:40] buy or sell so be real careful brother
[41:43] let it go just to labor alone
[41:46] watch it it's a warning
[41:49] god's spirit warns christians to
[41:50] spiritually battle against the effects
[41:53] of catholicism
[41:54] in punishment for failing to repent of
[41:56] untold iniquities a harsh prophecy is
[41:59] spoken against the vatican
[42:01] don't you never try to fight communism
[42:03] fight romanism for that's thus saith the
[42:06] lord the lord said romanism is going to
[42:09] rule not communism it's just a puppet
[42:13] remember i say this is god's prophet the
[42:15] russian empire will drop an atomic bomb
[42:18] of some sort on the vatican city and
[42:20] destroy it in one hour thus saith the
[42:23] lord
[42:24] armed with these thus say the lord
[42:26] doctrines and fulfilled and future
[42:28] prophecies jesus's earthly bride is now
[42:31] fulfilling revelation 10 verse 11 by
[42:34] sharing these prophecies essentially
[42:37] prophesying again
[42:38] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[42:40] again before many peoples and nations
[42:43] and tongues and kings
[42:45] possessing thus saith the lord the word
[42:47] of the king
[42:49] makes you ready for the final showdown
[42:50] before the rapture
[42:53] this last showdown is between the true
[42:55] bride church of jesus christ and the
[42:58] false united denominational churches
[43:01] recall haman's wicked plot to kill
[43:03] esther and her people through evil laws
[43:06] that's a type of the catholic beast
[43:08] systems plot to lay down its worldwide
[43:11] mark in deadly religious persecution
[43:14] against jesus's bride through government
[43:16] legislation
[43:18] esther's intercession for the king's
[43:20] favor at the second wine banquet in the
[43:23] presence of her enemy haman secured
[43:25] deliverance
[43:26] the bride of christ's favor with king
[43:28] jesus will grant her deliverance from
[43:31] satan's false church at the latter wine
[43:33] banquet or the time when rapturing faith
[43:36] is poured out
[43:39] branham's elijah characteristics
[43:42] since william branham fulfilled the
[43:43] forthcoming of elijah's spirit he
[43:45] fittingly displayed numerous
[43:47] characteristics of elijah and john the
[43:50] baptist
[43:52] first all three men spoke the word of
[43:54] the lord
[43:55] elijah spoke with thus saith the lord
[43:57] when he prophesied of haziah's demise in
[44:00] second kings 1 verses 1 through 18.
[44:03] the word came to john in the wilderness
[44:06] whereby he foretold jesus would take
[44:08] away the sins of the world and baptize
[44:10] with the holy ghost as this chapter
[44:12] chronicles brother branham correctly
[44:14] spoke in the name of the lord more than
[44:16] 30 times
[44:19] second all three were set apart from
[44:22] and opposed the popular religious
[44:24] organizations of their day
[44:26] elijah rebuked ahab
[44:29] jezebel and their false 450 baal
[44:32] prophets in 1st kings 18 verses 17
[44:36] through 22
[44:37] and 1st kings 21 verses 20 through 25
[44:41] john called the pharisees and sadducees
[44:43] a generation of vipers
[44:45] in matthew 3 verses 6 through 8
[44:48] as god revealed the incurable iniquities
[44:50] of denominations branham condemned
[44:52] preachers who rejected bible revelations
[44:55] and today i indict this bunch of
[44:57] ordained ministers in their creeds and
[44:59] denominations they are crucifying to the
[45:02] people the very god that they claim that
[45:04] they love and serve
[45:06] i indict these ministers in the name of
[45:08] the lord jesus
[45:09] upon their doctrine that claim that the
[45:11] days of miracles is past and that the
[45:14] water baptism in the name of jesus
[45:16] christ is not sufficient and not right
[45:19] upon any of these words that they have
[45:21] substituted creeds for i indict them as
[45:23] guilty and the blood of jesus christ
[45:26] upon their hands
[45:27] for crucifying afresh the lord jesus the
[45:30] second time
[45:31] they are crucifying christ to the public
[45:33] taking from them the thing that they're
[45:35] supposed to be giving to them
[45:37] and they substituted something else in
[45:39] its place a church creed for popularity
[45:44] third these men condemned prominent
[45:46] immoral women
[45:48] elijah condemned jezebel's murder of
[45:50] innocent naboth in first kings 21 verses
[45:53] 17-29
[45:55] john the baptist rebuked herod for his
[45:58] unlawful marriage to herodias
[46:00] prompting her to take off his head
[46:03] branham condemned the evil influences of
[46:05] marilyn monroe and jackie kennedy
[46:08] about monroe he warned i don't want you
[46:11] influenced by marilyn monroe i want you
[46:13] to be influenced by jesus christ see and
[46:16] by his word he is the word if the word
[46:19] don't influence you then christ can't
[46:21] because he is the word
[46:23] branham rebuked kennedy for encouraging
[46:25] women to cut their hair
[46:27] breaking first corinthians 11 verses 1
[46:29] through 16. he preached
[46:32] i said a hard thing about mrs kennedy a
[46:34] couple times about her setting fashions
[46:37] for the world with these waterhead
[46:39] haircuts and how our sisters and them
[46:42] cut their hair and dress like mrs
[46:43] kennedy i said like a jezebel of old
[46:47] that's true
[46:49] fourth all three were men of the
[46:51] wilderness
[46:52] elijah was from gilead a mountainous
[46:55] region near the river jordan
[46:57] he spent time at the brook cherith being
[46:59] fed by ravens
[47:01] later he rested under a juniper tree and
[47:03] dwelt alone in a cave hearing god's
[47:05] voice
[47:06] john dwell in the wilderness receiving
[47:08] god's word and baptizing there
[47:10] john is well known for wearing camel's
[47:12] hair and eating locusts and honey
[47:14] brother branham spent much of his free
[47:16] time in the woods and wilderness in
[47:18] order to refresh his mind and body
[47:20] his gift of discernment sapped much of
[47:23] his physical strength
[47:24] just as daniel experienced in daniel 8
[47:27] verses 26 and 27
[47:30] nature was also his refuge a place to
[47:32] meet with god
[47:34] branham shared and my nature has always
[47:36] been to the woods i was born in the
[47:38] woods and i just seemed like was raised
[47:41] up there
[47:42] and even my conversion never took it out
[47:44] of me
[47:44] not so much to get the game
[47:46] but just to be in the woods i think god
[47:49] is there to see him how he moves
[47:53] lastly all three men battled the sin
[47:55] nature when not under the holy spirit's
[47:57] anointing
[47:58] fearing jezebel's threat elijah fled in
[48:01] 1st kings 19
[48:03] verses 1-8
[48:05] despite having so recently called fire
[48:07] down from heaven to consume his
[48:09] sacrifice
[48:10] while in prison john doubted whether
[48:12] jesus was the messiah despite having
[48:15] baptized jesus and having seen the
[48:17] spirit descend upon him like a dove
[48:19] under god's powerful anointing brother
[48:21] branham repeatedly and publicly declared
[48:23] he was god's prophet
[48:25] when correctly discerning a woman's
[48:27] infirmity he proclaimed and that you
[48:29] might know that i be god's prophet and
[48:31] his spirit is here on me now you also
[48:34] have a condition of the colon and bowel
[48:37] but when jesus's mighty anointing left
[48:39] brother random doubted he was a prophet
[48:41] hesitating to label himself so
[48:44] the people many times regard me as being
[48:46] a prophet i do not regard myself that no
[48:49] sir i do not i have
[48:51] i don't say that to be humble i say that
[48:53] to be truthful
[48:54] i do not regard myself to be a prophet
[48:56] of the lord i i haven't that honor
[49:01] false claims to be elijah
[49:04] although many men and women have falsely
[49:06] claimed to have elijah's anointing two
[49:08] stand out in particular
[49:10] john alexander dowie and tony palmer
[49:15] dowie
[49:16] 1847 to 1907 was a pastor from australia
[49:20] who moved to america and gained many
[49:23] followers in the chicago area
[49:25] dowie did indeed possess a legitimate
[49:27] healing ministry having won nearly 100
[49:30] suits against doctors and clergy who
[49:32] denied his healing testimonies
[49:35] sadly he declared himself elijah the
[49:37] restorer in 1901 and was later removed
[49:40] from leading the city of zion for fiscal
[49:43] irresponsibility
[49:46] what's significant about dowie is the
[49:48] timing in which he falsely claimed to
[49:50] possess the elijah anointing as 1901 was
[49:54] only eight years before the true elijah
[49:56] was born william branham
[49:58] a biblical precedent exists for men
[50:00] recognizing god's season for prophecy to
[50:03] be fulfilled but prematurely injecting
[50:05] themselves into it
[50:07] in acts 5 verses 34-39
[50:10] the jewish teacher gamalia names this
[50:14] and judas of galilee as men who boasted
[50:16] themselves as great ones and gained many
[50:19] followers to their shame and destruction
[50:22] these evil men sensed it was time for a
[50:24] great one to come and he did jesus
[50:27] christ
[50:28] but they selfishly exalted themselves as
[50:30] great rather than waiting for god's
[50:32] chosen one
[50:34] gamalia wisely advised the jewish
[50:36] council to abstain from persecuting
[50:38] peter and the christians for if the move
[50:41] was of men it would cease
[50:44] moving on to our day jesus himself
[50:47] taught many would rise and claim to be
[50:49] him right before his second coming in
[50:51] matthew 24 24 spiritual men recognize
[50:55] this is the season of jesus second
[50:57] coming
[50:58] and some allow satan to deceive them
[51:00] into pretending to be messiah but they
[51:02] lie
[51:03] do not fear for jesus says you'll know
[51:06] all the false prophets by their evil
[51:08] fruits you'll know the true church
[51:10] jesus's bride for shall have the correct
[51:13] interpretation of the bible and the
[51:15] power of the spirit accompanying her
[51:18] bishop tony palmer
[51:21] 2014
[51:23] is best known for unifying the
[51:25] charismatic word of faith movement with
[51:28] the vatican
[51:29] in february 2014
[51:31] palmer visited kenneth copeland's
[51:33] leadership conference in the spirit of
[51:35] elijah to reunite protestants and
[51:38] catholics
[51:39] it was a lie for the spirit of elijah
[51:41] had already spoken thus saith the lord
[51:44] through branham to fight against not
[51:47] unite with romanism the bishop claimed
[51:50] the protest against rome was over and
[51:53] all christians were catholics
[51:55] however revelation 18 verse 5 says
[51:57] heaven will not forget rome's sins
[52:01] palmer was right about one thing he knew
[52:03] elijah had to return before jesus second
[52:05] coming but must have overlooked
[52:08] branham's unequaled ministry
[52:10] the bishop erd by teaching the anointing
[52:12] unites us not the doctrine
[52:15] ii john 1 verse 9 teaches otherwise
[52:18] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[52:22] in the doctrine of christ hath not god
[52:25] he that abideth in the doctrine of
[52:26] christ he hath both the father and the
[52:29] son
[52:30] true christian unity requires both the
[52:32] anointing and true doctrine many false
[52:35] prophets and false christs have the
[52:37] anointing but are void of truth
[52:40] copeland's group swallowed up palmer's
[52:42] false unity plea
[52:44] blessing pope francis with all their
[52:46] hearts and souls an idolatrous statement
[52:50] and visited the vatican a few months
[52:51] later to officially unite in brotherhood
[52:54] yes the iron catholics and clay
[52:57] protestants of daniel 2 verse 43 are
[53:00] mixed but not cleaving one to another
[53:03] true god-fearing protestants remain
[53:05] staunchly opposed to rome for the blood
[53:08] of millions of martyrs is on her hands
[53:11] and she is guilty of continual idolatry
[53:14] marialatry pedophilia
[53:16] and every other unclean spirit
[53:20] tragically palmer died in a head-on
[53:22] motorcycle accident in july 2014 and we
[53:26] mourn for his wife children and family
[53:29] but the question remains if elijah's
[53:32] spirit upon branham had already come
[53:34] with thus saith the lord to condemn
[53:36] catholicism's iniquity how could god
[53:39] send another man with elijah spirit
[53:41] palmer to condone rome's wickedness and
[53:44] urge complete unity with the mother
[53:46] harlot
[53:47] scriptural and prophetic authority
[53:49] validates branham as god's true and only
[53:52] elijah messenger to this age
[53:56] william branham was not jesus
[53:59] in recent years two extreme erroneous
[54:02] groups have risen up around branham's
[54:04] movement
[54:05] one exalts branham as infallible
[54:08] essentially equal with jesus and the
[54:10] other labels him a charlatan
[54:13] william branham was not jesus far from
[54:15] it according to his own words he
[54:18] admitted he was a sinner saved by grace
[54:20] making thousands of sins per year and
[54:22] repenting frequently
[54:24] i make thousands of mistakes in each
[54:26] month in each year sure i do but when i
[54:29] see i'm wrong i say god i didn't mean to
[54:32] do it you know my heart i didn't mean to
[54:34] do that i was trapped into that i didn't
[54:37] mean to do it you forgive me lord
[54:40] branham plainly said i'm not infallible
[54:42] in 1963
[54:44] after telling his congregation it was
[54:46] awful and tommy rot to say he was such
[54:49] in october of 1962
[54:52] branham never wanted or accepted jesus's
[54:55] honor
[54:57] the ever-growing branham worship group
[54:59] says every word branham said was thus
[55:01] saith the lord this is blatant heresy in
[55:05] light of romans 3 verse 4
[55:07] yea let god be true but every man a liar
[55:10] the rest of romans 3 says there is none
[55:12] righteous and every tongue has used
[55:14] deceit
[55:16] jesus alone is the only infallible man
[55:19] if branham was a true prophet he like
[55:22] every prophet would be infallible when
[55:24] he spoke in the name of the lord and
[55:26] with thus saith the lord
[55:28] it's my conviction branham was a true
[55:30] prophet but not every word he uttered
[55:32] was inspired as he often admitted
[55:35] during his lifetime brother branham
[55:37] battled and rebuked men who worshipped
[55:39] him
[55:40] two years before his death branham
[55:42] wondered if god would take him off the
[55:44] earth because men were giving him more
[55:46] attention than they were to christ's
[55:48] bible message
[55:49] i'm nothing i'm your brother don't you
[55:51] pay any attention to the messenger you
[55:54] watch the message don't watch the
[55:56] messenger god will take it away from you
[55:58] he will share his glory with nobody
[56:00] that's right don't you watch the
[56:02] messenger watch the message
[56:04] the man worshiping antichrist spirit
[56:07] never left after branham's death as many
[56:09] worship branham secretly by claiming his
[56:12] every word was infallible
[56:15] branham's supernatural gifts caused some
[56:18] to exalt him just as some confused john
[56:20] the baptist for jesus in john 1 verses
[56:24] 19-20
[56:25] and this is the record of john when the
[56:27] jews sent priests and levites from
[56:29] jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he
[56:32] confessed and denied not but confessed i
[56:35] am not the christ
[56:36] anyone worshiping a man is the seed of
[56:38] satan however servants of god always
[56:41] battle this satanic scheme
[56:43] like paul and barnabas desperately
[56:45] condemned worship directed to them in
[56:48] acts 14
[56:50] like john the baptist branham only
[56:52] pointed believers to jesus
[56:54] john said behold the lamb of god and
[56:57] branham directed believers away from his
[56:59] mortality pointing to the immortal
[57:01] christ praying
[57:03] may they look away from this mortal clay
[57:05] of a servant may they look to him who is
[57:07] the omnipotent who is
[57:10] and we know lord that we are finite no
[57:12] matter who we are we're still mortal
[57:15] but not the messenger but the message
[57:18] granted lord that's where we point to to
[57:21] jesus christ the son of god
[57:23] grant that he will be so real to
[57:25] everyone here today
[57:26] even to the little children that he will
[57:28] become the absolute of the entire
[57:30] congregation we ask it in jesus name
[57:33] amen
[57:35] any student of branham's teachings knows
[57:38] he grew in revelation some of his
[57:40] doctrinal understandings greatly changed
[57:43] over the course of his ministry for
[57:45] example branham grew in his
[57:47] understanding of the godhead and the
[57:48] seven seals
[57:50] in 1952 he thanked god for the great
[57:52] third person of the trinity who burned
[57:54] in his heart but nine years later he
[57:57] boldly preached trinitarianism was of
[57:59] the devil
[58:00] branham originally believed the white
[58:02] horse writer of revelation 6 2 was the
[58:05] holy spirit but three years later
[58:07] declared he was the antichrist spirit
[58:09] with thus saith the lord
[58:11] in both doctrines his later
[58:13] interpretations contradicted his first
[58:16] teachings proving not every word he said
[58:18] was divine since god doesn't contradict
[58:21] himself branham's growth and
[58:23] understanding is a sign of his humble
[58:25] teachable christ-like spirit
[58:29] william branham was not a charlatan
[58:32] the anti-brahm group claims he was a
[58:34] charlatan but their assumptions are
[58:37] evidence of their ignorance
[58:39] one claim against branham was that he
[58:40] purposely lied and exaggerated stories
[58:43] in order to gain influence
[58:45] it's true details and random stories
[58:47] change at times but nothing suggests
[58:50] he was lying
[58:51] humans sometimes forget details
[58:54] which i can relate to as a minister of
[58:55] the gospel
[58:56] also unlike nearly every other human
[58:59] brother branham spent much time daily
[59:01] seeing visions in a heavenly dimension
[59:04] many associated with him witnessed him
[59:06] constantly breaking in and out of
[59:09] visions
[59:10] as daniel suffered physically and
[59:11] mentally from visions branham did too
[59:14] a weary mind is prone to forgetfulness
[59:17] but god's amazing grace kept branham
[59:19] sharp
[59:20] with thus saith the lord
[59:22] branham wasn't afraid of being
[59:25] challenged as he openly invited
[59:27] listeners to test his teachings by the
[59:29] word
[59:29] quoting prove all things repeatedly he
[59:32] knew the bible was always right and
[59:34] accepted correction from it
[59:36] now we must prove all things by the
[59:38] scripture not what
[59:39] if it's contrary to my faith and yet the
[59:41] scripture says so the scripture is right
[59:43] and i'm wrong see the scripture is
[59:46] always right
[59:47] and only way you can do anything is come
[59:49] back to the scripture
[59:52] a second more serious attack is saying
[59:54] branham's prophecies failed but branham
[59:57] has evidence of accurately foretelling
[59:58] events in the name of the lord as you've
[1:00:00] already read five prophecies that have
[1:00:02] either come to pass or are in the
[1:00:04] process of being fulfilled
[1:00:07] the anti-brahm group makes three
[1:00:08] mistakes regarding branham's prophecies
[1:00:11] first they claim prophecies have failed
[1:00:13] because they haven't come to pass but
[1:00:15] ignore the fact that brother brahm never
[1:00:17] put a date on their fulfillment
[1:00:20] next they fail to recognize some
[1:00:22] prophetic visions are conditional while
[1:00:25] others are unconditional
[1:00:27] conditional promises come to pass
[1:00:28] through human obedience and thus can
[1:00:31] remain unfulfilled due to disobedience
[1:00:34] joshua 1 verses 1 through 4 shows god's
[1:00:37] conditional promise to israel through
[1:00:39] joshua
[1:00:40] equivalent to thus saith the lord
[1:00:42] regarding their potential boundaries or
[1:00:45] coasts
[1:00:46] but judges one and two show israeli
[1:00:48] tribes failed to drive out all the
[1:00:51] inhabitants of canaan
[1:00:52] thus not fully claiming their coasts did
[1:00:56] god's own thus saith the lord fail
[1:00:58] no that generation of israelis
[1:01:01] failed god's conditional thus saith the
[1:01:03] lord promise due to disobedience and
[1:01:06] miss their opportunity to expand their
[1:01:08] borders
[1:01:10] on the other hand jesus's earthly life
[1:01:13] and mission is an example of an
[1:01:15] unconditional promise
[1:01:16] despite herod's efforts to kill all
[1:01:18] israeli male babies two years old and
[1:01:21] under god protected baby jesus by
[1:01:24] sending him and his parents to egypt
[1:01:26] isaiah's thus saith the lord prophecies
[1:01:28] about jesus's life death and
[1:01:31] resurrection in isaiah 53 were going to
[1:01:34] be fulfilled no matter what
[1:01:37] a final mistake is denying the fact that
[1:01:39] god can use other men to fulfill brother
[1:01:42] branham's prophecies if they have not
[1:01:44] yet come to pass
[1:01:46] in 1st kings 19 verses 15-17
[1:01:49] the lord commanded elijah to anoint
[1:01:51] hasael jehu and elisha
[1:01:54] elijah could have said thus saith the
[1:01:56] lord i'm going to anoint three men
[1:01:58] but elisha was the only one he anointed
[1:02:01] hasiel seems to be anointed by elisha in
[1:02:04] second kings 8 verses 13 through 15
[1:02:07] and jay who is anointed by a son of a
[1:02:09] prophet in second kings 9 verses 1
[1:02:12] through 13.
[1:02:14] scripture doesn't offer a reason why god
[1:02:16] didn't allow elijah to anoint the other
[1:02:18] two men but you learn we cannot
[1:02:21] interpret prophecies by human reasoning
[1:02:24] god is the only true interpreter of his
[1:02:26] word
[1:02:28] i must insert a friendly challenge to
[1:02:30] readers to contact me if you think a
[1:02:32] branham prophecy has failed
[1:02:34] after two decades of studying and
[1:02:36] preaching revelations god revealed to
[1:02:38] branham i'm convinced branham was a
[1:02:40] genuine prophet of god who was accurate
[1:02:43] with thus saith the lord
[1:02:46] brother branham was as genuine as
[1:02:47] christians come with impeccable
[1:02:49] character
[1:02:50] financially branham lived a very modest
[1:02:53] life shunning luxurious living unlike
[1:02:56] today's many prosperity preachers
[1:02:59] he lived true to his first wife hope
[1:03:01] and after her death did the same with
[1:03:03] his second wife meda
[1:03:05] branham kept his ministry small when
[1:03:08] other ministers of his time like oral
[1:03:10] roberts spent millions to expand theirs
[1:03:13] all while compromising on bible truths
[1:03:16] brahms purpose in staying small was to
[1:03:19] be able to preach to any size
[1:03:21] congregation and to abstain from begging
[1:03:23] for money but i've kept my meeting small
[1:03:26] i've never tried to get big or some
[1:03:29] great big program where i have to beg
[1:03:30] people for money when it gets like that
[1:03:33] i'll fold the bible and go back to my
[1:03:36] tabernacle see i never have to do that
[1:03:39] may god help me to never do it i've
[1:03:42] never had big programs so i can go to a
[1:03:44] church that holds ten and hold a revival
[1:03:47] or if the lord wants me to preach to a
[1:03:48] hundred thousand he sends somebody along
[1:03:51] to pay for it so i go on and preach to a
[1:03:53] hundred thousand so that's the way we
[1:03:55] live so just don't have to have money
[1:03:58] just very small
[1:04:00] no these are not the words of a
[1:04:02] charlatan rather they reveal branham was
[1:04:04] a humble honest christian who was loved
[1:04:07] and vindicated by god but despised and
[1:04:10] rejected by the majority of christendom
[1:04:14] william branham and the twelve mysteries
[1:04:17] two bible passages foretold brother
[1:04:19] branham's ministry of restoring the
[1:04:21] twelve mysteries
[1:04:22] the twelve pieces of shoe bread and
[1:04:24] elijah repairing the altar with 12
[1:04:26] stones
[1:04:29] on december 30th 1962 william branham
[1:04:32] preached two sermons and the latter
[1:04:35] evening service was different than any
[1:04:37] other sermon he had ever preached the
[1:04:39] sermon titled is this the sign of the
[1:04:41] answer
[1:04:43] contained a cluster of interrelated
[1:04:45] dreams and visions he couldn't interpret
[1:04:48] yet he spoke in the name of the lord
[1:04:50] that something important was going to
[1:04:51] happen soon
[1:04:53] branham wondered if the dreams and
[1:04:54] visions meant his death or jesus's
[1:04:56] coming but three months later the lord
[1:04:59] showed him they signaled a furthering of
[1:05:00] his ministry into its third and final
[1:05:03] phase
[1:05:05] the last phase of branham's ministry was
[1:05:07] to finish the mystery of god in
[1:05:09] fulfillment of revelation 10 verse 7.
[1:05:12] he spent the second half of the is this
[1:05:14] the sign of the answer
[1:05:16] sermon preaching all the bible mysteries
[1:05:19] that needed to be explained before the
[1:05:20] end time many of which he had already
[1:05:23] preached
[1:05:24] branham began the teaching by quoting
[1:05:26] c.i scofield's comments on matthew 13
[1:05:29] verse 11 which defined 11 new testament
[1:05:32] mysteries and then added more bible
[1:05:34] revelations god's people needed it
[1:05:37] became clear to me that schofield and
[1:05:38] branham were on to something divine and
[1:05:41] i began studying these mysteries
[1:05:44] to begin my search i used my electronic
[1:05:46] bible concordance to search the king
[1:05:48] james version for every scripture that
[1:05:51] used the word mystery and found
[1:05:53] twenty-seven
[1:05:54] after reading them all i concluded there
[1:05:56] were twelve mystery doctrines not eleven
[1:05:59] scofield left one out the mystery of
[1:06:02] god's will found in ephesians 1 verse 9.
[1:06:05] 12 mysteries connects to 12 loaves of
[1:06:07] shoe bread in the old testament holy
[1:06:10] place
[1:06:10] just as the seven church ages were
[1:06:12] represented by the seven golden
[1:06:14] candlesticks
[1:06:15] the types have to match the anti-types
[1:06:18] there were not 11 loaves of bread but
[1:06:20] 12.
[1:06:22] next the spirit of god brought to my
[1:06:24] remembrance how branham taught the
[1:06:26] waters of separation and moses's
[1:06:28] tabernacle typed our new testament
[1:06:31] worship experience
[1:06:32] old testament worshippers first had to
[1:06:35] be sprinkled with the waters of
[1:06:36] separation before they could even enter
[1:06:39] moses tabernacle so the red heifer typed
[1:06:41] jesus death on the cross and the
[1:06:43] sprinkling of the water typed a
[1:06:45] believer's first act of repentance
[1:06:47] first peter 1 verse 2 shows new
[1:06:50] testament sprinkling as god's anointing
[1:06:52] to repent and obey
[1:06:54] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:06:55] god the father through sanctification of
[1:06:58] the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling
[1:07:01] of the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:04] once sprinkled the cleansed and forgiven
[1:07:06] believer could enter the outer court and
[1:07:08] offer sacrifices which typed
[1:07:11] justification the first new testament
[1:07:13] work of grace
[1:07:15] branham taught this and said old
[1:07:16] testament worshipers in the outer court
[1:07:19] still lacked fellowship with almighty
[1:07:20] god for there were two courts they could
[1:07:22] not enter
[1:07:24] holy place and the holiest of holies
[1:07:26] in the new many believers repent and
[1:07:29] worship god but fail to advance in
[1:07:31] worship with the holy place representing
[1:07:33] sanctification and the holiest of holies
[1:07:36] typing the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:07:38] true fellowship with god
[1:07:40] branham taught now my baptist brother i
[1:07:43] want to ask you something if
[1:07:45] justification is all god requires i'd
[1:07:47] like to ask you this
[1:07:49] when the man was separated by the waters
[1:07:51] of separation sprinkled
[1:07:53] then he could not yet enter into the
[1:07:55] worship of the glory of the lord he
[1:07:58] could not do it because he was only
[1:07:59] sprinkled from his sins
[1:08:01] it separated him from his sins but it
[1:08:04] did not put him in fellowship that's
[1:08:06] right it only separated him from his
[1:08:08] sins now ephesians says we are washed by
[1:08:11] the water of the word
[1:08:12] now hearing the word and being just as
[1:08:15] religious as you want to be and your
[1:08:17] your pastor a scholar and your doctor of
[1:08:20] divinity a scholar still that don't put
[1:08:22] us in fellowship no sir it will not do
[1:08:25] it because they were only separated from
[1:08:27] their sins now that's a justification
[1:08:30] was martin luther's doctrine we know
[1:08:32] that being justified by faith and still
[1:08:35] it didn't bring a fellowship
[1:08:38] the anti-type of the holy place is the
[1:08:40] second work of grace called
[1:08:41] sanctification
[1:08:43] sanctified christians today must worship
[1:08:46] with all three furniture pieces the
[1:08:48] seven golden candlesticks the twelve
[1:08:50] loaves of shoe bread and the altar of
[1:08:52] incense
[1:08:53] the seven candlesticks speak of
[1:08:55] branham's thus saith the lord
[1:08:56] interpretation of the seven church ages
[1:08:59] see chapter seven
[1:09:01] believers must recognize their church
[1:09:03] age laodicea and maintain a brightly
[1:09:06] burning testimony for christ as every
[1:09:08] other age accomplished
[1:09:10] then believers feast on the fresh
[1:09:12] spiritual shoe bread the bread of his
[1:09:14] face or the twelve new testament mystery
[1:09:17] doctrines tasting the goodness of the
[1:09:19] lord
[1:09:20] before entering the holiest christians
[1:09:22] become prayer warriors offering fiery
[1:09:25] sincere prayers including sighing and
[1:09:27] crying for the abominations done in the
[1:09:29] world
[1:09:31] a crucial point about the twelve loaves
[1:09:33] of shoe bread
[1:09:34] as the twelve new testament mysteries is
[1:09:37] that paul said you can understand all
[1:09:38] mysteries yet not have love in first
[1:09:41] corinthians thirteen verse two and
[1:09:43] though i have the gift of prophecy and
[1:09:45] understand all mysteries and all
[1:09:47] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[1:09:50] that i could remove mountains and have
[1:09:52] not charity i am nothing
[1:09:54] just as priests could devour the shew
[1:09:56] bread yet still not enter the holiest
[1:09:59] believers today can devour the 12
[1:10:00] mysteries and still not be born again
[1:10:03] yes you can understand all the mysteries
[1:10:05] the 12 previous chapters of this book
[1:10:08] and still not be filled with the holy
[1:10:09] ghost baptism experience a dedicated
[1:10:12] sincere prayer life is needed to be born
[1:10:14] again as evidenced by the altar of
[1:10:17] incense being the final piece of
[1:10:19] furniture before entering the holiest
[1:10:23] the third work of grace the baptism of
[1:10:25] the holy ghost is tight by the holiest
[1:10:28] of holies
[1:10:29] god meets with and speaks to christians
[1:10:31] in their souls as exodus 25 22 says it
[1:10:35] was the place of meeting and communion
[1:10:38] or speaking the ark of the covenant
[1:10:40] contained two tables of stone the pot of
[1:10:43] manna and aaron's rod the stone tables
[1:10:45] speak of the new testament word covenant
[1:10:48] written on the fleshly tables of our
[1:10:50] hearts
[1:10:50] according to second corinthians 3 verse
[1:10:52] 3
[1:10:53] the part of manna represents god sharing
[1:10:55] his original supernatural word with
[1:10:58] believers in every generation
[1:11:00] god's word is incorruptible and
[1:11:02] satisfies the hungry soul
[1:11:04] for he satisfieth the longing soul and
[1:11:07] filleth the hungry soul with goodness
[1:11:09] aaron's rod represents a resurrected
[1:11:11] quickened soul according to ephesians 2
[1:11:14] verse 5
[1:11:15] even when we were dead in sins hath he
[1:11:17] quickened us together with christ by
[1:11:20] grace ye are saved
[1:11:23] i believe there's a second scriptural
[1:11:24] precedent for branham restoring the 12
[1:11:27] mysteries
[1:11:28] first kings 18 verses 30 and 31 shows
[1:11:31] elijah repairing the altar of the lord
[1:11:33] with 12 stones at the mount carmel
[1:11:35] showdown
[1:11:36] once the altar of worship was restored
[1:11:39] elijah prayed and the fire fell
[1:11:41] vindicating him as god's true prophet
[1:11:44] elijah showdown typed the final showdown
[1:11:46] coming before the rapture which branham
[1:11:48] calls the mount zion latter rain
[1:11:50] showdown
[1:11:52] then in the latter rain will come a
[1:11:53] mount carmel showdown he will be
[1:11:55] indicated pointed out in the word
[1:11:58] revelation 10 7 and god will vindicate
[1:12:00] his ministry he will preach the truth as
[1:12:03] elijah did and be ready for the mount
[1:12:05] zion
[1:12:06] showdown in our day branham had the
[1:12:09] spirit of elijah and restored true
[1:12:11] worship by placing 12 stones or the 12
[1:12:14] mysteries in their proper place
[1:12:16] matthew 16 verses 17 and 18 teach a
[1:12:20] stone or rock is a revelation
[1:12:23] one day soon the holy ghost fire will
[1:12:25] fall vindicating branham as god's true
[1:12:27] prophet as evidenced by his followers
[1:12:30] being raptured into the sky to meet
[1:12:32] jesus in the
[1:12:34] air branham's emphasis on the bible and
[1:12:38] concordance
[1:12:40] amazed by the revelations of moses's
[1:12:42] tabernacle typing new testament worship
[1:12:45] i wondered how to teach the twelve new
[1:12:47] testament mysteries
[1:12:48] the holy spirit reminded me of how he
[1:12:51] taught branham to interpret the seven
[1:12:52] seals and i followed his example
[1:12:55] each day before preaching one of the
[1:12:57] seals god showed branham a vision
[1:12:59] interpreting its meaning
[1:13:01] then branham would spend the rest of the
[1:13:03] day finding bible support for each
[1:13:05] vision's meanings
[1:13:07] using his concordance to locate
[1:13:09] scriptural evidence for god's
[1:13:10] revelations
[1:13:11] here branham explains it well
[1:13:14] and then i thought well what is it lord
[1:13:16] and i walked up and down the floor while
[1:13:18] i'd kneel down and pray go back and pick
[1:13:21] up the bible sit down and read walk back
[1:13:24] and forth
[1:13:25] and then all of a sudden when i got
[1:13:26] quiet hear it
[1:13:27] vision
[1:13:28] just unfolded like that then i grab a
[1:13:31] pen right quick and go to writing it
[1:13:33] down like that whatever i was seeing and
[1:13:35] doing watching it like that till i got
[1:13:38] it wrote down
[1:13:39] then i take the rest of the day and go
[1:13:41] down and chase this out and see if it
[1:13:44] all tied all the way down through the
[1:13:46] scriptures then it prove all things see
[1:13:50] further brother branham likens this
[1:13:52] method to raising a building stone by
[1:13:54] stone
[1:13:55] which connects to his elijah-like
[1:13:57] ministry of restoring the altar of
[1:13:59] worship using 12 stones or 12 mystery
[1:14:02] truths
[1:14:04] so help me i never knew it before none
[1:14:07] of these things revelations of the seals
[1:14:10] have i ever known before that's right
[1:14:12] and i just don't
[1:14:14] just go up there and take the bible and
[1:14:16] sit down and sit there until
[1:14:18] when it vision goes to breaking forth
[1:14:21] like that i just pick up my pen and
[1:14:23] start writing see
[1:14:24] and just stay there maybe for hours till
[1:14:27] it gets uh it gets finished then i go
[1:14:30] back and i find out
[1:14:32] as i see where he said this i thought
[1:14:34] well
[1:14:35] looks like i've seen that somewhere i
[1:14:37] got my concordance
[1:14:39] go look back is there something like
[1:14:41] that and here it is right here and then
[1:14:44] here it is over here again here it is
[1:14:47] back here and down here and over here
[1:14:49] then i just tie it right in
[1:14:51] i know that's god as long as it's
[1:14:53] comparing scripture with scripture
[1:14:55] that's the way it has to do just like
[1:14:57] putting a building together the stones
[1:14:59] have to fit stone by stone
[1:15:03] in my case with the twelve mysteries i'm
[1:15:05] not a prophet so i never saw visions but
[1:15:08] i started with the unfailing thus saith
[1:15:10] the lord teachings from branham as my
[1:15:13] foundational rock
[1:15:14] with each mystery such as chapter five's
[1:15:17] mystery of godliness i used the
[1:15:19] concordance to look up each occurrence
[1:15:21] of godliness in the king james version
[1:15:24] there are 15
[1:15:25] then i looked up each of the eight
[1:15:27] character traits
[1:15:28] such as virtue and temperance
[1:15:30] in the concordance and every bible
[1:15:33] occurrence had to be taken into
[1:15:34] prayerful consideration
[1:15:36] in understanding the trait
[1:15:38] it's indisputable that the bible
[1:15:40] interprets itself so the revelation of
[1:15:42] virtue temperance and every other trait
[1:15:44] must already lay in scripture
[1:15:47] this book's aim has been to clearly
[1:15:49] prove the revelations of the 12
[1:15:51] mysteries are already in the bible
[1:15:54] branham's experience in the spiritual
[1:15:56] realms supporting heavenly visions using
[1:15:59] his bible in concordance caused him to
[1:16:02] distinguish his teachings on the seven
[1:16:04] seals as his greatest meetings he says
[1:16:07] the spirit's revealing of truth is
[1:16:09] greater than divine healing
[1:16:11] of all the times that i've been behind
[1:16:13] the pulpit at the tabernacle i have
[1:16:15] never never in any time of my ministry
[1:16:18] ever worked into the realms of god and
[1:16:20] the spiritual realms as it's been this
[1:16:22] time yeah it's beyond anything i ever
[1:16:24] did in any time of my ministry in any
[1:16:27] meeting at anywhere like this
[1:16:29] mostly it's on healing this is revealing
[1:16:32] of truth by the same spirit see same
[1:16:35] spirit
[1:16:38] branham on mysteries as bread
[1:16:41] while no one quote exists of brother
[1:16:43] branham saying twelve mysteries numerous
[1:16:46] quotes associate mysteries and bread
[1:16:49] in moses's tabernacle the shoe bread was
[1:16:51] hidden from the public inside the holy
[1:16:54] place
[1:16:55] priests alone could eat of it once a
[1:16:56] week
[1:16:57] the manna was even more exclusive
[1:17:00] accessible only once a year to israel's
[1:17:02] high priest
[1:17:04] interestingly there's no biblical record
[1:17:06] of any priest eating from the pot of
[1:17:08] manna
[1:17:10] spiritually speaking the 12 bible
[1:17:12] mysteries are hidden from most
[1:17:14] christians accessible only to spiritual
[1:17:16] priests who are living sanctified lives
[1:17:20] born again christians who enter into the
[1:17:21] holiest by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:25] behold the pot of manna or original
[1:17:27] eternal word delivered on the day of
[1:17:29] pentecost
[1:17:31] branham's first quote connecting
[1:17:33] mysteries and bread is fittingly from
[1:17:35] december 1960 immediately after he
[1:17:38] preached the revelation of the mystery
[1:17:40] of the seven stars and seven golden
[1:17:42] candlesticks the seven church ages
[1:17:45] according to a dream or vision from the
[1:17:47] lord he says his preaching was a
[1:17:49] mountain of bread the saints were
[1:17:51] feasting on help me god because i seek
[1:17:54] sincerely to know your will that i might
[1:17:56] do it to bring as you showed me many
[1:17:59] years ago when i left this church
[1:18:01] the bread of life to the peoples of the
[1:18:03] world
[1:18:04] when i saw that great mountain of bread
[1:18:06] and white robe saints coming from all
[1:18:08] over the earth to eat this bread of life
[1:18:11] oh god let me oh god let me never never
[1:18:14] fail to feed the people on the bread of
[1:18:16] life bless these hungry souls in here
[1:18:20] that raise their hands just now
[1:18:23] in june 1964 brother branham likens
[1:18:26] christians to spiritual kings and
[1:18:28] priests who enter into the holy place
[1:18:31] and holiest of holies eating shoe bread
[1:18:34] or bibles with brand new revelations
[1:18:37] it may be but you see inside behind that
[1:18:40] badger skin
[1:18:41] behind that human skin in there is the
[1:18:43] shekinah glory in there is the power
[1:18:46] in there is the word in there is the
[1:18:48] shoe bread
[1:18:50] and the shekinah glory which is the
[1:18:51] light that makes light that ripens grain
[1:18:55] you kansas people know that by your
[1:18:56] wheat crops without that sun it won't
[1:18:59] light and until you come in behind that
[1:19:01] badger skin until you get out of your
[1:19:04] old skin your old thoughts
[1:19:06] your old creeds and come into the
[1:19:08] presence of god then the word becomes a
[1:19:10] living reality to you
[1:19:12] then you're awakened to the shekinah
[1:19:13] glory then the bible becomes a new book
[1:19:16] then jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:19:18] today and forever
[1:19:20] you're living in his presence eating the
[1:19:21] shoe bread that's only provided that day
[1:19:24] for believers priests only and we are
[1:19:26] priests royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:19:29] peculiar people giving spiritual
[1:19:31] sacrifices to god
[1:19:33] but you must come in to behind the veil
[1:19:36] to see the unveiled god and god is
[1:19:38] unveiled that's his word made manifest
[1:19:42] next in what may be the most important
[1:19:44] quote associating mysteries and bread
[1:19:47] brother branham uses malachi 4 verses 5
[1:19:50] and 6 and revelation 10 verse 7 to say
[1:19:52] god is turning our hearts back to eating
[1:19:55] all the revealed mysteries calling them
[1:19:57] the shoe bread of this laodicean church
[1:19:59] age
[1:20:01] the shekinah glory it ripens the shoe
[1:20:03] bread that we feast on and drive across
[1:20:06] the country for hundreds of miles see
[1:20:09] it's the believer's food it's only for a
[1:20:11] believer remember the shoe bread was
[1:20:13] only for the believer only see shoe
[1:20:16] bread seed notice what does it do that's
[1:20:19] your kind of glory over the shoe bread
[1:20:21] kept it from spoiling
[1:20:23] what's this your kind of glory today to
[1:20:25] break beyond the veil to see who god is
[1:20:28] standing before you see who god is
[1:20:30] standing here before us the the pillar
[1:20:33] of fire he is veiled in human flesh but
[1:20:35] what does the shekinah what did it do
[1:20:38] the shoe bread seed the word that were
[1:20:41] to live on in this day by these promises
[1:20:44] the shekinah glory ripens that shoe
[1:20:46] bread brings it to pass makes it bread
[1:20:48] to the believer that laid in the pages
[1:20:50] of the bible year after year the word
[1:20:53] for this age
[1:20:54] to the denominations it's a stumbling
[1:20:56] block to the denominations they stumble
[1:20:58] at it down through the years luther
[1:21:00] wesley martin luther and all
[1:21:02] sankey finney john smith knox
[1:21:05] all stumbled at it
[1:21:07] but what's it to be done in the last
[1:21:09] days
[1:21:10] what is to reveal bring forth
[1:21:13] what's malachi 4 to do to turn back the
[1:21:16] people from that stumbling block to
[1:21:18] break down the traditions and to reveal
[1:21:20] the bread with the shekinah glory
[1:21:22] watch it ripen and produce just exactly
[1:21:24] what it said it would do oh my the shoe
[1:21:27] bread for this age to the denomination a
[1:21:30] stumbling block a bunch of fanatics
[1:21:33] but we who believe
[1:21:34] but now as revelation 10 as promised all
[1:21:36] the mysteries of god
[1:21:38] that's been hidden the pages down
[1:21:39] through them years would be ripened
[1:21:42] brought forth in the age of the seventh
[1:21:44] angel's message
[1:21:47] restored truths
[1:21:49] another observation from is this the
[1:21:51] sign of the end sir is branham listing
[1:21:54] more mysteries after he read scofield's
[1:21:56] list of 11 such as the serpent seed the
[1:21:59] true understanding of grace non-eternal
[1:22:01] hell water baptism in jesus christ
[1:22:04] literal name and the return of the
[1:22:06] pillar of fire
[1:22:07] but notice these doctrines are not
[1:22:08] specifically labeled as mysteries in
[1:22:10] scripture like the 12 mysteries of each
[1:22:12] previous chapter since god's word omits
[1:22:15] the mystery label i choose to do the
[1:22:18] same
[1:22:19] the conclusion is twofold first some of
[1:22:22] these doctrines are part of the 12
[1:22:24] mysteries showing they are mysterious
[1:22:27] they include the serpent seed as part of
[1:22:29] the mystery of iniquity
[1:22:30] grace accepted and grace failed in the
[1:22:32] mystery of godliness and water baptism
[1:22:35] as part of the mystery of the godhead
[1:22:39] second the doctrines not labeled as
[1:22:40] mysteries in the kjv such as non-eternal
[1:22:44] hell and the return of the pillar of
[1:22:46] fire can be categorized as restored
[1:22:48] truths christians lost during the church
[1:22:51] ages recall the end time is the age of
[1:22:54] restoration according to joel 2 verses
[1:22:56] 23-26 matthew 17 11 and acts 3 verses 20
[1:23:01] and 21
[1:23:04] revelations are hidden wisdom given to
[1:23:06] the wise
[1:23:08] the 12 bible-defined mysteries and
[1:23:10] branham's god-given revelations are so
[1:23:12] simple and plain you would think
[1:23:14] multitudes of church members would
[1:23:16] rejoice in them
[1:23:17] sadly most fulfill the denunciation
[1:23:20] given to the laosen church age thinking
[1:23:22] they have everything spiritually and
[1:23:24] desire nothing more from god
[1:23:27] in most of my conversations sharing
[1:23:29] about the mysteries church members
[1:23:31] disregard them showing no interest in
[1:23:33] the deep things of god
[1:23:35] if they had the spirit they would desire
[1:23:36] the deep things for the spirit searches
[1:23:39] all things yea
[1:23:41] the deep things of god
[1:23:43] lukewarm is god's description of this
[1:23:45] revelation rejecting group
[1:23:48] another reason church members reject the
[1:23:50] mysteries is because they're hidden from
[1:23:52] them first corinthians 2 verse 7
[1:23:54] supports this saying but we speak the
[1:23:57] wisdom of god in the mystery even the
[1:23:59] hidden wisdom which god ordained before
[1:24:01] the world unto our glory
[1:24:04] why is it hidden
[1:24:05] because they have rejected god's
[1:24:06] previous attempts to show them truth
[1:24:09] billions will be left behind after the
[1:24:11] rapture and suffer god's wrath in the
[1:24:14] tribulation because they refuse god's
[1:24:16] counsel
[1:24:17] proverbs 1 verses 24 through 26 reads
[1:24:21] because i have called and ye refused i
[1:24:24] have stretched out my hand and no man
[1:24:26] regarded but ye have said at not all my
[1:24:29] counsel and would none of my reproof i
[1:24:32] also will laugh at your calamity i will
[1:24:34] mock when your fear cometh
[1:24:36] the tribulation is the reaping of their
[1:24:38] sinful planting
[1:24:40] david speaks of god's just dealings with
[1:24:42] mankind that apply to today in second
[1:24:45] samuel 22 verses 26-28
[1:24:48] with the merciful thou will show thyself
[1:24:51] merciful and with the upright man thou
[1:24:54] wilt show thyself upright with the pure
[1:24:56] thou wilt show thyself pure
[1:24:59] and with the froward thou will show
[1:25:01] thyself unsavory and the afflicted
[1:25:04] people thou wilt save
[1:25:06] but thine eyes are upon the haughty that
[1:25:09] thou mayest bring them down
[1:25:12] jesus endured the same truth-rejecting
[1:25:14] demon-filled religious groups we battle
[1:25:18] the pharisees flat-out denied and
[1:25:20] ignored all the scriptures about jesus
[1:25:22] like groups today do to followers of
[1:25:24] brother branham's ministry john 7 52
[1:25:27] exposes
[1:25:28] one major heir the pharisees made they
[1:25:31] never asked jesus where he was born
[1:25:33] they assumed he was born in galilee but
[1:25:36] bethlehem was his birthplace
[1:25:38] how many today hear brother branham's
[1:25:40] doctrines like the one person godhead
[1:25:42] the serpent seed women having uncut hair
[1:25:45] and never search the scriptures to see
[1:25:47] if they are true
[1:25:48] shame and folly is all that is left for
[1:25:51] such world loving church members
[1:25:54] proverbs 18 verse 13 confirms this
[1:25:57] he that answereth a matter before he
[1:25:59] heareth it it is folly and shame unto
[1:26:01] him
[1:26:03] holy ghost-filled christians want to
[1:26:05] know god's mysteries
[1:26:07] we delight in the deep things of god for
[1:26:09] they reveal god's heart we want to
[1:26:11] please god he is seeking true worshipers
[1:26:14] now for his eyes go to and fro
[1:26:16] throughout the earth to reveal himself
[1:26:19] to truth-hungry souls
[1:26:22] jesus heart trusts his wife
[1:26:25] paul says in first corinthians 4 verse 9
[1:26:28] we are made a spectacle unto the world
[1:26:30] and to angels and to men
[1:26:32] the word spectacle means theater or
[1:26:34] public show giving us the imagery of a
[1:26:37] broadway show
[1:26:38] human history is a great drama being
[1:26:40] played out before the world angels and
[1:26:43] men
[1:26:44] thankfully the author and finisher of
[1:26:46] the script loves and protects those that
[1:26:48] love him and will not suffer them to be
[1:26:50] tempted above their capacity
[1:26:54] the final act in this climatic times of
[1:26:56] the gentile scene is for heaven's hero
[1:26:59] our husband jesus christ to return to
[1:27:02] rapture his bride off the earth
[1:27:05] revelation 19 verse 7
[1:27:07] says our charge as jesus's future wife
[1:27:10] is to make ourselves ready the bible is
[1:27:13] our husband's love letter giving us both
[1:27:15] clear and secret instructions to prepare
[1:27:18] for the rapture
[1:27:19] the secrets or mysteries are only
[1:27:21] revealed to jesus's bride because she
[1:27:24] truly hungers to obey him
[1:27:26] deuteronomy 29 verse 29 proclaims this
[1:27:28] saying
[1:27:29] the secret things belong unto the lord
[1:27:31] our god but those things which are
[1:27:34] revealed belong unto us and to our
[1:27:36] children forever that we may do all the
[1:27:39] words of this law
[1:27:41] the distinctive characteristic of true
[1:27:44] christians
[1:27:45] is their desire to lovingly obey jesus
[1:27:48] as a wife obeys her husband
[1:27:50] thus the purpose of god revealing his
[1:27:52] mysteries is so you can do the will of
[1:27:54] god james 1 verse 22 says but be ye
[1:27:58] doers of the word and not hearers only
[1:28:00] deceiving your own selves
[1:28:02] jesus bride is a doer not a hearer only
[1:28:07] since you've received jesus spirit in
[1:28:09] the depths of your being your soul
[1:28:12] he has confidence that you'll do his
[1:28:13] good pleasure in everything
[1:28:15] recall how god confidently allowed job
[1:28:18] to be tested by satan himself
[1:28:20] god wasn't worried about job falling
[1:28:22] neither is he worried about you falling
[1:28:24] because you have already received his
[1:28:26] own life in your soul the holy ghost
[1:28:29] like job and the proverbs 31 woman jesus
[1:28:32] heart is confident in your obedience
[1:28:35] proverbs 31 verses 10 through 11
[1:28:37] proclaims who can find a virtuous woman
[1:28:40] for her price is far above ruby's the
[1:28:43] heart of her husband dust safely trust
[1:28:45] in her so that he shall have no need of
[1:28:47] spoil
[1:28:49] truly god doesn't think he knows you're
[1:28:52] going to overcome satan and keep his
[1:28:55] word for you are the spiritual seed of
[1:28:57] abraham
[1:28:58] genesis 18 is repeating now as god is
[1:29:01] preparing to destroy the sin-loving
[1:29:03] sodomites of this world but god is
[1:29:05] graciously revealing all his plans to
[1:29:07] you like he did abraham because you're
[1:29:10] keeping his bible commands
[1:29:12] and the lord said shall i hide from
[1:29:14] abraham
[1:29:16] that thing which i do
[1:29:17] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[1:29:19] a great and mighty nation and all the
[1:29:21] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[1:29:23] him for i know him that he will command
[1:29:26] his children and his household after him
[1:29:28] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:29:30] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[1:29:33] may bring upon abraham that which he has
[1:29:35] spoken of
[1:29:36] him since you love jesus christ with all
[1:29:39] your heart you're in the abraham group
[1:29:42] to whom jesus revealed his 12 mystery
[1:29:44] doctrines
[1:29:45] recall the four heart reactions to jesus
[1:29:48] from figure 21 in chapter eight
[1:29:50] jesus hid these revelations from the
[1:29:52] other three groups the lot group foolish
[1:29:55] virgins
[1:29:56] mrs lot group make believers like judas
[1:29:59] iscariot
[1:30:00] and sodomites unbelievers
[1:30:04] whether the rapture comes in this
[1:30:05] generation
[1:30:06] or a future generation jesus's blessing
[1:30:09] will rest upon you and your children
[1:30:11] because you're abraham's spiritual seed
[1:30:14] you've obeyed his voice and kept his
[1:30:16] commands
[1:30:17] isaac the seed of abraham received this
[1:30:19] same promise in genesis 26 verses 4 and
[1:30:22] 5
[1:30:23] and i will make thy seed to multiply as
[1:30:25] the stars of heaven and will give unto
[1:30:27] thy seed all these countries and in thy
[1:30:29] seed shall all the nations of the earth
[1:30:31] be blessed because that abraham obeyed
[1:30:34] my voice and kept my charge my
[1:30:36] commandments my statutes and my laws
[1:30:41] your ministry is making yourself ready
[1:30:43] finishing jesus's great commission and
[1:30:45] waiting for your heavenly husband to
[1:30:48] appear not on stage but above the stage
[1:30:51] in the air
[1:30:52] our promise remains
[1:30:54] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:30:56] be caught up together with them in the
[1:30:58] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:31:00] so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:31:03] you don't know the day and hour of his
[1:31:05] return neither do the angels or the
[1:31:07] husband himself but he knows your heart
[1:31:10] and he's trusting you'll be ready
[1:31:14] conclusion with a comma scripture is
[1:31:16] clear that god promised to send a
[1:31:18] prophet anointed with the spirit of
[1:31:20] elijah to restore all things before
[1:31:22] jesus returns to the earth
[1:31:25] amos 3 verse 7 agrees saying god always
[1:31:28] sends a prophet to reveal the secrets
[1:31:30] our lord was obligated by his promises
[1:31:33] to send a prophet before the times of
[1:31:34] the gentiles were finished and he has
[1:31:37] come and gone speaking in jesus name
[1:31:39] with thus saith the lord
[1:31:42] the apostolic ministry of bible days has
[1:31:44] returned though small in number
[1:31:46] jesus's bride patterns herself after
[1:31:48] paul's divine pattern pointed to paul's
[1:31:51] scriptures by branham
[1:31:53] as a member of jesus's bride never let
[1:31:55] your hunger for god wane
[1:31:57] feed your soul daily upon god's fresh
[1:31:59] bread his word
[1:32:02] god doesn't condemn people for being
[1:32:04] born in sin but for loving darkness
[1:32:06] rather than light if your soul is full
[1:32:09] of holy ghost love you'll never
[1:32:11] denominate upon your own opinions
[1:32:13] instead you'll constantly seek more
[1:32:15] revelation from god
[1:32:17] branham had to stand against every
[1:32:18] denominational system because they grew
[1:32:20] lukewarm and thought they had no more
[1:32:23] need of god's power like revelation 3
[1:32:25] verse 17 expresses god's prophet said
[1:32:29] that way when i speak against some
[1:32:30] denomination or the denominational
[1:32:33] system it isn't the people in there
[1:32:35] it's the system that i'm against you see
[1:32:38] that holds them apart holds us from
[1:32:40] receiving see they drop their
[1:32:42] declarations say we believe this period
[1:32:45] if they would end it with a comma we
[1:32:48] believe this plus as much as the lord
[1:32:50] can show us out of his word it would be
[1:32:52] all right but they do not do it that way
[1:32:55] you know that it couldn't be a
[1:32:57] denomination and do that see it would
[1:32:59] just be the move of god moving on all
[1:33:02] the time you see
[1:33:04] i'm a witness that god is active and
[1:33:06] moving in my life and our local church
[1:33:09] by his grace
[1:33:10] we're thrilled to be a part of god's
[1:33:12] restoration of the book of acts church
[1:33:14] the best part is the move of god is only
[1:33:17] going to increase in bride churches
[1:33:19] according to prophecy in joel 2 verses
[1:33:22] 23-26
[1:33:24] imagine a church full of fresh bread
[1:33:26] fresh preaching
[1:33:27] imagine a church overflowing with wine
[1:33:30] joy and gladness and oil saints being
[1:33:32] born again
[1:33:34] imagine being satisfied leaving church
[1:33:36] every single time
[1:33:37] imagine long stretches of joyous praise
[1:33:40] to jesus
[1:33:41] imagine being unashamed of the gospel in
[1:33:44] every area of your life
[1:33:45] some saints are already experiencing
[1:33:47] these blessings but the bride worldwide
[1:33:50] is coming into them in order to fulfill
[1:33:52] god's promises
[1:33:55] my final prayer is for god to help us
[1:33:56] boldly utter the revelations he has made
[1:33:59] known to us as paul prayed in ephesians
[1:34:02] 6 verses 18-20
[1:34:04] we are called to boldly share god's
[1:34:06] secrets not hide them from others
[1:34:09] dear jesus open doors of utterance to
[1:34:12] the lost and embolden our souls and
[1:34:14] spirits to make known the mystery of the
[1:34:17] gospel in their ears
[1:34:20] at the beginning of this book jesus
[1:34:22] secrets were at your fingertips but now
[1:34:24] they are written in your heart by the
[1:34:26] holy ghost god's secrets are both with
[1:34:28] you and in you proverbs 3 verse 32
[1:34:32] affirms his secret is with the righteous
[1:34:35] second corinthians 4 7 says god's
[1:34:38] treasure is inside you
[1:34:40] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:34:42] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:34:45] may be of god and not us
[1:34:48] i'm ending this book with a symbolic
[1:34:50] comma as a tribute to branham's
[1:34:52] dedication to constant revival through
[1:34:55] receiving further revelation from the
[1:34:57] holy spirit branham never denominated
[1:35:00] thinking he knew everything bride
[1:35:02] members today will keep the same humble
[1:35:03] attitude
[1:35:04] as their star messenger branham may you
[1:35:07] believe god sent william branham to
[1:35:09] finish the mystery of god and obey the
[1:35:11] bible truths he pointed to with all my
[1:35:14] heart i believe brother branham's
[1:35:15] bible-based revelations plus as much
[1:35:18] additional revelation the lord jesus
[1:35:21] christ will reveal to me out of his word
