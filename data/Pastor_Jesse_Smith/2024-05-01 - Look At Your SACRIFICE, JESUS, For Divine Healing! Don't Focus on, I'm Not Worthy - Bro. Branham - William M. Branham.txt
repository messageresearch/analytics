TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well I tell you brother I'm not worthy of he I've just got to tell you it's nothing you done it's what he done amen you keep thinking you're unworthy here what if an old mayor back in the Bible time would give birth to a little cult or had say he had a mule and this mule was born and both ears was flopped down his tail stuff straight up his eyes was crossed his knees was B together well if he could look in a glass and think it's say boy is me they'll never feed me they just knock me AE when they come out and see me but what if his mother was well instructed in the law she say wait a minute honey wait a minute I know you're a horrible looking creature you're no good but you're going to live because there is a law of God that says you are born under a Birthright that's right you're my first oh God why you want to be a presbyterian want you go back to be a Pentecostal like it was at the first the birthright you can be a Pentecostal Presbyterian you can be a Pentecostal Methodist go back to the first church the way it started say you were borned under a Birthright I tell you if you were borned under a Birthright you what's going to happen What going to take place in the morning when they come out to the pastor to see you you know what they're going to do they are not going to knock you in a head because you're going to live but there's going to have to reach over and get a lamb without a blemish on it amen and they'll take that lamb that don't even have a blemish on it and that lamb will have to die in your stead the priest will never see you amen amen GL do you see it amen don't look at yourself look at your sacrifice God don't look at you he looks at your sacrifice CH amen God don't look at yourself I'm not worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the one I'm not counting on what I've done what I am I'll never make it but I'm looking at what he done that's where I'm trusting what he done amen He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no sir Lord Heart To Die long I know I've never even been born but I live I got eternal life I'm going to heaven why because he don't for me he took my place I was not NE crosseyed in every kind of condition but he took my place spiritually speaking I was all twisted up and all messed up but he took my place so he makes me a perfect Son of God a perfect daughter of God his sacrifice did it not mine I had nothing to do with it I was born all out of shape anyhow but I I don't trust in what I done I trust in what what he done what he was that's what it was
