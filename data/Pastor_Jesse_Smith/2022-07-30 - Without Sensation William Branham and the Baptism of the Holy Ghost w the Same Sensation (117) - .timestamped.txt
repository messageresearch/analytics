[0:07] same baptism same kind of people acting
[0:09] the same way with the same power the
[0:11] same sensation the same
[0:14] sensation greetings friends in the name
[0:17] above all names the lord jesus christ
[0:21] the purpose of this video is to answer
[0:22] the question
[0:24] what did brother branham mean when he
[0:25] said the mystery of the baptism of the
[0:27] holy ghost without sensation
[0:30] some interpret this quote to mean there
[0:32] is no emotion or feeling when a person
[0:35] is baptized with the holy ghost
[0:37] did brother branham mean a believer will
[0:39] feel no sensation
[0:41] in his body human spirit or soul when he
[0:44] is born again by the baptism of the holy
[0:46] ghost
[0:47] i truly believe the answer is no
[0:50] based upon two proofs
[0:52] first the new testament proves every
[0:55] believer from every church age
[0:57] and as many believers as the lord our
[0:59] god shall call
[1:01] has some sort of sensation when he or
[1:03] she is born again as peter declared on
[1:05] the day of pentecost in acts 2 verse 33
[1:09] and verses 38 and 39 and also
[1:12] in acts 11 15
[1:15] peter said the father's promise of the
[1:17] holy ghost hath shed forth this which ye
[1:20] now see and hear
[1:22] and also in acts 2 verse 38 and 39
[1:25] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:27] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:29] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[1:31] the gift of the holy ghost for the
[1:33] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:35] and to all that are far off even as many
[1:38] as the lord our god shall call and of
[1:40] course the lord our god is still calling
[1:42] souls today to be baptized with the holy
[1:45] ghost
[1:46] acts 11 verse 15 says and as i began to
[1:49] speak the holy ghost fell on them as on
[1:51] us at the beginning
[1:53] the bible is clear that the gospel
[1:55] cannot change according to galatians 1
[1:57] verses 6 through 12 and revelation
[2:00] chapter 22 verses 18 and 19.
[2:03] paul said we are to keep jesus's
[2:05] commandments without spot until the
[2:07] appearing of the lord jesus christ in
[2:09] first timothy 6 14.
[2:12] brother branham wrote in the church age
[2:14] book that the seventh angel could not
[2:15] change one word that was given to paul
[2:18] by jesus christ let's listen to the
[2:21] quote
[2:22] it was the apostles who brought the
[2:24] original word to the people
[2:26] that original word could not change not
[2:28] even a dot or dash of it
[2:30] paul knew it was god who had spoken to
[2:32] him so he said
[2:34] even if i come and try to give a second
[2:36] revelation
[2:37] try to make one little change in what i
[2:39] gave originally let me be accursed
[2:42] one of these days there is going to come
[2:43] a prophet to the laodicean church age
[2:46] and you will know if he is the real one
[2:48] sent from god or not yes you will
[2:51] for if he is of god he will be in that
[2:54] word exactly as god gave it to paul he
[2:57] won't deviate from that word for a
[2:58] moment not by one iota
[3:02] so when you take everything back to the
[3:04] bible like the without sensation quote
[3:07] you never find the baptism of the holy
[3:09] ghost
[3:10] or seal of the holy ghost changing
[3:12] so when brother branham said without
[3:14] sensation he was not changing the
[3:16] baptism of the holy ghost i believe he
[3:18] was simply saying there was no certain
[3:20] evidence as he said in another quote
[3:23] which we'll hear later in this video and
[3:25] again as acts 11 verse 15 said peter
[3:28] told us the holy ghost felt the same way
[3:30] on the day of pentecost as it did in
[3:32] corneas house it felt the same on jews
[3:35] as it did gentiles and remember jesus
[3:38] christ is the same yesterday today and
[3:40] forever according to hebrews 13 verse 8.
[3:43] the second reason i believe every person
[3:45] needs a sensation
[3:47] or supernatural experience when they get
[3:49] the baptism of the holy ghost is because
[3:51] brother branham has quotes both before
[3:54] and after the quote about without
[3:57] sensation
[3:58] that prove he believed every person
[4:00] needed a definite emotional
[4:02] powerful experience with the holy ghost
[4:05] as vindication they were born again or
[4:07] baptized with the holy ghost
[4:10] in other words there are quotes before
[4:12] is this the sign of the answer sermon
[4:14] and there's quotes after is this a sign
[4:17] of the end times sermon where brother
[4:19] ranum supports that each person have a
[4:21] supernatural emotional powerful
[4:23] sensational experience when they're
[4:26] baptized with the holy ghost so it seems
[4:28] the quote without sensation means
[4:30] without a requirement or mandate to
[4:33] speak in tongues or produce one certain
[4:35] sensation or evidence
[4:38] here's the outline for the video first
[4:40] we'll examine the without sensation
[4:42] quote comparing it with scripture
[4:45] second we'll look at quotes before the
[4:47] without sensation quote
[4:49] third we'll look at quotes after the
[4:51] without sensation quote
[4:53] and fourth we'll look at three reasons
[4:55] some want the false without sensation
[4:58] interpretation
[5:00] examining the without sensation quote
[5:02] and comparing it with scripture
[5:05] let's listen to the without sensation
[5:06] quote from brother
[5:09] the branham of the baptism of the holy
[5:11] ghost
[5:12] without sensation but the person of
[5:14] christ performing in you the same works
[5:16] that he did
[5:19] friend i have two observations about
[5:21] this quote
[5:22] first notice brother branham quoted no
[5:24] scripture so we don't know which verse
[5:27] he's referring to and all quotes from
[5:30] brother branham must be taken back to
[5:31] the bible to be proven as the bible says
[5:35] and also as brother branham taught us
[5:37] brother brahm said quote now we must
[5:40] prove all things by the scripture
[5:42] if it's contrary to my faith and yet the
[5:44] scripture says so the scripture is right
[5:46] and i'm wrong
[5:47] see the scripture is always right and
[5:49] the only way you can do anything is to
[5:51] come back to the scripture end quote
[5:54] again brother branham said quote well
[5:56] you say how do you know that you're not
[5:58] right
[5:59] then test me by the word come test your
[6:01] denomination by this word let's see who
[6:03] is right prove all things the bible said
[6:06] end quote
[6:07] if we go back to the scripture the holy
[6:09] ghost baptism experience is something
[6:11] that is poured out from god according to
[6:13] acts 2 verse 17.
[6:15] it is also seen and heard according to
[6:17] acts 2 verse 33
[6:19] when the holy ghost baptism falls on a
[6:21] believer it has such a sensation upon
[6:24] them that others can observe it with
[6:26] their eyes and ears as peter said
[6:29] and an unbeliever would think the person
[6:31] who was filled with the holy ghost was
[6:33] drunk on natural wine according to acts
[6:35] 2 13.
[6:37] the spirit-filled believer would also
[6:39] declare the wonderful works of god with
[6:41] their mouth according to acts 2 verse
[6:43] 11.
[6:45] so we see the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:47] is poured out it's seen and heard people
[6:50] accuse them of being drunk and the
[6:52] believers declare god's works with their
[6:54] mouth
[6:55] i also call it the see and hear
[6:56] principle
[6:57] of being born again just like a natural
[7:00] birth of a baby is both seen and heard
[7:02] so is a spiritual baby's birth seen and
[7:05] heard
[7:06] remember this experience is to as many
[7:09] as would believe as peter said in acts 2
[7:11] verse 39 as many as the lord our god
[7:14] shall call and remember acts 11 15 peter
[7:17] said the holy ghost fell the same on the
[7:18] jews as the gentiles
[7:20] acts 11 15 says and as i began to speak
[7:24] the holy ghost fell on them as on us at
[7:26] the beginning
[7:28] so in cornelius house when the holy
[7:29] ghost fell on the gentiles
[7:31] observers would have thought they were
[7:33] drunk on natural wine
[7:35] so of course they had the same sensation
[7:37] they had on the day of pentecost
[7:39] when the jews like peter and james and
[7:41] john went out into the streets praising
[7:43] god and declaring the wonderful works of
[7:44] god
[7:45] a second observation about though
[7:47] without sensation quote is that it
[7:49] reminds me of john 14 verse 12
[7:52] where jesus said the works that i do ye
[7:54] shall do also
[7:56] friends
[7:57] as holy ghost filled believers we should
[7:59] be doing the works of christ we should
[8:01] ask ourselves what works am i doing as a
[8:04] message believer claiming to have the
[8:06] holy ghost that jesus did
[8:09] those who don't believe in the
[8:10] supernatural baptism of the holy ghost
[8:12] with signs wonders and miracles and
[8:13] sensations
[8:14] are denying this part of the quote and
[8:17] they're basically splicing this quote
[8:19] they're only saying baptism of the holy
[8:22] ghost without sensation but leaving out
[8:24] the works of christ let's not be guilty
[8:26] of splicing quotes
[8:28] let's not be guilty of refusing to take
[8:30] quotes back to the scripture
[8:32] so we should have a baptism of the holy
[8:34] ghost experience with sensations just
[8:36] like they did on the day of pentecost
[8:38] and in corneas house
[8:40] and then the works of christ should
[8:42] follow in our lives
[8:44] as the bible said in mark 16 these signs
[8:47] shall follow them that believe
[8:49] here's another observation
[8:51] there's a quote in the same sermon as
[8:53] the without sensation quote which is is
[8:55] this the sign of the end times sir from
[8:58] december 1962
[9:00] and brother branham said he was against
[9:02] the evidence of the holy ghost as being
[9:04] speaking in tongues
[9:06] so this proves brother branham could
[9:07] have been talking
[9:09] about tongues are not the evidence of
[9:11] being baptized with the holy ghost when
[9:13] he was saying without sensation let's
[9:16] listen to the
[9:21] chicago quote association is going to
[9:24] challenge me
[9:25] on the baptism in the name of jesus
[9:27] christ
[9:29] the greater chicago ministerial
[9:30] association is going to challenge me on
[9:32] the evidence of the holy ghost speaking
[9:34] in
[9:34] tongues they're going to chase me on the
[9:36] serpent seed and on the creation of
[9:38] grace
[9:40] but also then later in the same sermon
[9:42] he said real believers have tongues he
[9:45] said our holy ghost filling should
[9:46] produce signs miracles and wonders
[9:49] speaking in tongues and the things that
[9:51] early church had let's listen to the
[9:53] quote
[9:55] will this be the mystery that would open
[9:58] up that would bring christ
[10:01] bring up power to the church uh see
[10:04] we've already we believe in repentance
[10:07] being baptized in the name of jesus
[10:08] christ we believe in receiving the holy
[10:10] ghost we have signs wonders miracles
[10:13] speaking in tongues and the things that
[10:14] the early church had
[10:16] and frankly there's been more done right
[10:18] here that's wrote in the book of acts
[10:21] this one little group of people this
[10:22] little bitty ministry of archer
[10:24] what about the world over
[10:27] furthermore
[10:28] in the sermon before
[10:30] is this the sign of the answers in the
[10:32] morning of december 31
[10:34] 1962 brother branham was contending for
[10:37] tongues prophecy and all the gifts of
[10:39] the spirit in other words he was showing
[10:41] that the supernatural power of god will
[10:43] follow a believer who's baptized with
[10:45] the holy ghost in other words they'll
[10:46] have sensations in their life i have
[10:49] experiences with the holy ghost that
[10:50] they'll see and hear
[10:52] let's listen to the quote
[10:54] we baptist even immersing it's good
[10:57] what about the
[10:58] baptism what about speaking with tom
[11:02] what about gifts of healing
[11:03] what about prophecy
[11:05] oh no we don't that was for another age
[11:07] oh boy
[11:09] that's it brother when a man comes to
[11:11] christ you don't want to take some word
[11:13] some secretary's word some something
[11:15] else you promised us don't take this out
[11:17] of there go to that absolute
[11:19] until you're right you're there is being
[11:23] born again and filled with the holy
[11:25] ghost and you see
[11:26] the bible being manifested in humility
[11:29] and love
[11:30] through your life oh then that's your
[11:32] absolute
[11:33] yes sir
[11:35] before moving on to the next section
[11:37] here's a quote a year and a half later
[11:40] after the without sensation quote which
[11:42] is also after the opening of the seven
[11:44] seals wherein brother branham said we
[11:46] have the same sensation as the day of
[11:48] pentecost
[11:50] so i'm going to play both quotes back to
[11:51] back i'm going to play the without the
[11:53] sensation quote and then followed up
[11:55] with this other quote from the mighty
[11:57] god unveiled before us a year and a half
[11:59] later
[12:00] in the first quote by the band will say
[12:01] without sensation and the next quote
[12:03] he'll say the same sensation let's
[12:05] listen to the quotes back to back
[12:08] the mystery of the baptism of the holy
[12:10] ghost
[12:11] without sensation but the person of
[12:13] christ performing in you the same works
[12:15] that he did
[12:17] and now it's right to bring him back
[12:19] exactly like he was at the beginning
[12:22] the same ministry the same jesus the
[12:25] same power the same holy ghost the same
[12:28] one that come down in the day of
[12:30] pentecost is the same holy promises
[12:33] manifested today
[12:35] from barrier to parent to
[12:39] with the baptism of the holy ghost with
[12:41] the same sign same numbers same baptism
[12:44] same kind of people acting the same way
[12:46] with the same power the same sensation
[12:48] it's from prayer and today
[12:52] [Music]
[12:59] friend the bible has no contradictions
[13:02] and god's prophet brother branham
[13:04] finished the mystery of god the baptism
[13:06] of the holy ghost is mysterious
[13:08] according to colossians chapter 1.
[13:10] the only logical conclusion about the
[13:12] quotes saying without sensation and same
[13:15] sensation is that brother branham
[13:17] supported a holy ghost baptism
[13:18] experience identical to acts chapter 2
[13:22] and the without sensation quote means
[13:24] without a mandate to speak in tongues or
[13:27] have any other one single evidence
[13:30] quotes before the without sensation
[13:32] quote i'm going to share three quotes
[13:35] that brother branham gave before the
[13:37] without sensation quote that proved he
[13:39] believed the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:41] experience did have sensations feelings
[13:43] emotions
[13:45] the same sensations they had on the day
[13:46] of pentecost
[13:48] the first quote is from who is this 1959
[13:51] brother ram said on the day of pentecost
[13:53] they acted like they were drunk and he
[13:55] said when the same spirit is poured out
[13:57] upon a congregation of people the same
[13:59] results will take place today let's
[14:02] listen to the quote
[14:04] on the day of pentecost when the holy
[14:06] spirit came into the people they acted
[14:08] like they were drunk
[14:10] even so much as they stopped and made
[14:13] fun of it
[14:14] said these men are full of new wine
[14:17] peter said you men of jerusalem and you
[14:19] that dwell in judea let this known unto
[14:22] you and hearken unto my words for these
[14:24] are not drunken
[14:26] as you suppose
[14:28] but this is that which is spoken by the
[14:30] prophet joel it'll come to pass the last
[14:32] day of god i pour my spirit out upon all
[14:35] flesh
[14:36] when that same spirit is poured out upon
[14:38] a congregation of people the same
[14:40] results will take place
[14:42] or you cannot put a life of a grapevine
[14:45] in a pumpkin and make it bear pumpkins
[14:48] it'll bear grapes
[14:51] by the fruits they are known
[14:53] the church is knowing the world's
[14:54] wondering
[14:57] the second quote was it wasn't so from
[15:00] the beginning 1960 brother brahm said
[15:02] every person will have the same reaction
[15:04] to the baptism of the holy ghost like
[15:06] they received at pentecost let's listen
[15:08] to the quote
[15:13] [Applause]
[15:20] under the power of the holy spirit
[15:22] he cannot change that he cannot
[15:29] [Applause]
[15:39] [Music]
[15:50] the third quote is from the rejected
[15:51] king 1960
[15:53] brother ram said the same holy ghost
[15:55] that found the day of pentecost is the
[15:56] same holy ghost and it has to bring the
[15:58] same experience to you if not you have a
[16:01] different holy spirit than that was
[16:03] let's listen to the quote
[16:05] and the same holy ghost that fell on the
[16:07] day of pentecost which we all know that
[16:09] that was the birth of the new church
[16:11] if that same holy spirit don't bring the
[16:13] same experience to you then you've got a
[16:15] different holy spirit from what that was
[16:18] that god if it don't make you live a
[16:20] sacrificial life and a life full of joy
[16:23] and pleasure and the baptism of the
[16:24] spirit leading you into signs and
[16:26] wonders and miracles and things that
[16:28] something happened
[16:30] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[16:33] that believe
[16:37] quotes after the without sensation quote
[16:40] in this section i'm going to share six
[16:42] quotes from after the without sensation
[16:44] quote that proved brother branham
[16:46] believed we had to have sensations we
[16:48] had to have supernatural experiences
[16:50] when we're baptized with the holy ghost
[16:53] the first is from pardon
[16:54] 1963
[16:56] brother braham said when the same spirit
[16:58] comes upon you you act the same way
[17:00] let's listen to the
[17:03] was our quote
[17:03] [Music]
[17:05] no one will have to say but what or can
[17:07] say but what that the church was
[17:09] inaugurated on the day of pentecost
[17:12] and the same spirit that come upon them
[17:14] on that day every time without fail in
[17:17] the bible when the holy ghost came upon
[17:20] the people they acted the same way
[17:24] in this next quote from desperations
[17:26] 1963 i love this quote brother ram said
[17:29] the holy ghost has just not no certain
[17:31] evidence
[17:33] you might speak in tongues you might you
[17:34] might cast out devils you might have
[17:36] many different kinds of sensations but
[17:39] you will have some kind of sensation
[17:41] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[17:42] ghost let's listen to the quote
[17:59] and that token
[18:00] is your affair
[18:02] and now it shows that the blood has been
[18:04] shed and been applied to you the price
[18:08] has been applied to you and you have the
[18:10] token that the blood is applied to you
[18:12] and you're accepted get it now
[18:15] oh
[18:17] no
[18:18] no certain evidence
[18:20] see you say brother brown
[18:23] i feel it in your mind you see
[18:25] why will i know
[18:28] look
[18:29] what were you
[18:31] and where are you
[18:34] that's how you know
[18:36] what was you before this token was
[18:38] applied
[18:39] what are your hatred supplies
[18:47] and these other things just
[18:49] automatically go with that
[18:51] see
[18:52] it isn't like talking about say tongues
[18:54] is
[19:02] [Applause]
[19:14] and doing those things and preaching and
[19:17] whatever is the evidence that's there
[19:20] true but it's it's not it
[19:23] see it's the gift of it
[19:26] if i told you that you said uh i want
[19:29] you brother brown and i'll give you a
[19:31] gift
[19:32] see
[19:33] well that's not me that's my gift
[19:35] tongues is the gift of the holy ghost
[19:38] not the holy ghost a gift of the holy
[19:40] ghost and the devil can't impersonate
[19:42] any of those things
[19:44] but he cannot be the holy ghost
[19:47] he can impersonate these gifts but he
[19:49] can't be the holy ghost amen
[19:52] a third quote i love is from the fourth
[19:54] seal 1963 brother ram said you have to
[19:56] wait on the holy spirit until something
[19:58] happens like the apostles waited and
[20:01] received such a positive experience from
[20:03] the holy ghost
[20:04] and i love it he says i don't care what
[20:06] form it comes in
[20:08] just so it happened that's the main
[20:09] thing
[20:10] he said you might dance emotional shout
[20:13] he said but the main thing is make sure
[20:14] you're changed
[20:16] brother branham said the baptism of the
[20:17] holy ghost took the fear out of the
[20:20] apostles in acts chapter 2. and he said
[20:22] if that experience brought such a
[20:24] positive change that they sealed their
[20:26] testimonies with their blood we should
[20:28] have a very similar life-changing
[20:30] experience
[20:31] let's listen to the
[20:32] quote hello
[20:34] uh jesus told them
[20:36] luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of
[20:39] my father upon you
[20:42] but you go up to jerusalem and wait
[20:44] until what was the promise of the father
[20:47] joel 2 28 while we find out he's going
[20:49] to pour out the spirit now isaiah 28 19
[20:52] how there'd be stammer lips and other
[20:54] tongues and all these things they went
[20:56] up there and as we went through it maybe
[20:58] one said well people waited long enough
[21:00] let's just accept it by faith that's
[21:02] good baptist doctrine but it didn't work
[21:04] with them
[21:05] so then the first thing you know it had
[21:07] to become a reality and they waited on
[21:10] their ministry
[21:12] for their word to be vindicated
[21:15] and when you come to seek the holy
[21:17] spirit you do the same
[21:19] yes you can't accept it by faith you
[21:21] have to accept christ by faith that's
[21:23] exactly right and you accept the holy
[21:25] spirit by faith but then let the
[21:28] holy spirit come and give the
[21:30] circumcision as a witness that he's
[21:32] accepted your faith you see and see
[21:35] abraham believed god it was imputed to
[21:37] him for righteousness but god gave him
[21:39] the sign of circumcision has a
[21:41] confirmation he had accepted his pain
[21:44] so that's the same thing we must do we
[21:46] must wait on the holy spirit tell us
[21:48] done something not necessary because
[21:50] we've spoken down and not because we
[21:52] danced we got emotional we shot it until
[21:54] we were changed
[21:56] until something actually happened i
[21:58] don't care what form it comes in
[22:00] just so it happened that's the main
[22:02] thing man
[22:04] speaking thomas doesn't do it do i speak
[22:06] with tongue of men and angels and have
[22:08] not charity and profit me nothing
[22:10] see no i could do it see so those things
[22:13] doesn't mean that you have the holy
[22:15] spirit but when he the person
[22:18] the
[22:19] immortal spirit of christ becomes
[22:23] your personal savior changes you and
[22:26] throws your views right straight into
[22:28] caliber into this world something's
[22:30] happening
[22:33] something has happened
[22:36] no one will have to tell you about it
[22:37] you'll know it when it happens and the
[22:40] new wine when it brings revelation
[22:43] then it's revealed and that's where it
[22:45] was at pentecost they know that
[22:48] there's supposed to be a spirit poured
[22:50] out upon
[22:51] and they waited till this happened and
[22:53] when the vindication of the revelation
[22:56] took place then stimulation was over
[23:00] and sure did they steamed up too they
[23:03] right out into the streets where there
[23:04] was afraid at the door shut and they
[23:06] were out in the streets or they've been
[23:08] afraid of a group of people of preaching
[23:10] the gospel
[23:12] see something happened because the true
[23:16] word of promise was vindicated
[23:19] now let's stop here
[23:22] if that brought such positive to that
[23:25] man that the
[23:26] nearly every one of them sealed their
[23:28] testimony with their blood
[23:32] no matter what come on as long as they
[23:35] live they never got over it
[23:37] it stayed there because it was the true
[23:40] word of promise
[23:42] vindicated
[23:43] the revelation
[23:45] become a vindicator
[23:48] and they died sealing your testimony
[23:51] with their own blood
[23:55] the fifth quote is from questions and
[23:56] answers part two 1964. they asked
[23:59] brother branham at the instant of
[24:00] receiving the holy ghost
[24:02] is there a difference and brother
[24:04] branham answered with a question could
[24:06] you imagine a mother giving birth to a
[24:07] baby and not knowing it so in other
[24:09] words yes
[24:11] something has to happen the person has
[24:12] to know something has changed when they
[24:14] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[24:17] he said there's something that changes
[24:19] takes place in you let's listen to the
[24:21] quote
[24:22] question for sunday morning sorry this
[24:25] time
[24:26] at the instant of receiving the holy
[24:29] ghost or the baptism
[24:31] of the holy ghost
[24:34] is there a difference does a person
[24:37] speak with tongues
[24:38] if not
[24:39] [Music]
[24:40] always what manifestation is known
[24:45] well
[24:48] could you
[24:50] imagine a mother giving birth to a baby
[24:52] and not knowing it
[24:55] should have to be unconscious
[24:58] not to know it
[25:01] neither can
[25:02] you receive the holy ghost without
[25:04] knowing it
[25:06] there's something takes place in you
[25:09] see there's something that changes you
[25:12] your whole system your whole
[25:15] spiritual system is made new again
[25:18] and you become a new creature in christ
[25:21] as the bible puts it a new creation in
[25:24] christ
[25:24] you know it now you say brother brad
[25:27] then you don't believe that a man should
[25:28] speak with tongues to receive the holy
[25:30] ghost not to prove he's got the holy
[25:31] ghost
[25:33] i would that ever remember my church
[25:35] spoke with tongues
[25:36] i would like for him to do that
[25:38] and if i believe if you ask god god will
[25:41] grant it to you
[25:43] but let me tell you i know plenty people
[25:45] speak in tongues and hasn't got the holy
[25:47] ghost
[25:48] and there's not a minister's true with
[25:50] himself and with his congregation but
[25:51] while telling his congregation the same
[25:54] the devil can impersonate that
[25:58] the sixth and final quote is why it had
[26:00] to be shepherds and of course saints
[26:02] there's more quotes than this but i just
[26:04] wanted to give a sample brother brandon
[26:06] quotes acts 2 verse 39 and he says if
[26:08] god is still calling the same experience
[26:11] is for you
[26:12] if you'll follow the same prescription
[26:14] let's listen to the quote
[26:17] the first priest if you want to call him
[26:19] peter that had the keys to the kingdom
[26:22] how did he to say
[26:23] he said repent every one of you and be
[26:26] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[26:29] for the remission of sin
[26:31] and you shall receive the gift of the
[26:32] holy ghost for the promise
[26:34] is to you and to your children and to
[26:37] all even as many as the lord are god
[26:40] shall call
[26:41] and if god is still calling the same
[26:44] experience is for you if you follow the
[26:47] same prescription
[26:48] if this congregation believes that
[27:02] three reasons somewhat the false without
[27:05] sensation interpretation
[27:08] now friends there could be more reasons
[27:09] why people don't want an emotional
[27:12] sensational baptism of the holy ghost
[27:14] experience but i found three simple ones
[27:16] from the scripture
[27:18] the first one is they'd rather foolishly
[27:20] waste their time than get down to
[27:21] business with god that's in ephesians 5
[27:24] verses 15 through 17.
[27:26] paul said the wise christians redeem the
[27:28] time they understand the will of god
[27:31] they walk circumspectly or exactly but
[27:34] fools then would waste time
[27:37] so the reason some people don't want
[27:39] sensation
[27:40] at the moment they're born again is
[27:42] because they don't want to invest time
[27:44] into dying out and seeking god's face
[27:47] second reason people want no sensation
[27:49] is because they don't want to pray they
[27:51] don't want to ask and they don't want to
[27:53] fully die out luke 11 13 tells us this
[27:57] jesus said how much more shall your
[27:58] heavenly father give the holy spirit to
[28:00] them that ask him
[28:02] some people just don't know how to pray
[28:05] they don't know how to see god's face
[28:06] they don't want to see god's face
[28:08] they just want to be saved but they
[28:10] still want to enjoy the foolish things
[28:11] of the world
[28:13] but a real believer will get down to
[28:14] business with god they'll ask jesus for
[28:16] the holy ghost and they'll keep asking
[28:18] until they receive it
[28:20] the third reason is they don't hunger
[28:21] enough according to matthew 5 6 jesus
[28:25] said blessed are they which do hunger
[28:26] and thirst after righteousness for they
[28:28] shall be filled so jesus plainly tells
[28:31] us this we have a thirst in our soul we
[28:34] have a hunger in our soul for god's
[28:36] spirit to fill our souls
[28:38] but we've got to satisfy that thirst
[28:39] we've got to satisfy that hunger
[28:42] and the only way to do that is through
[28:44] prayer
[28:45] reading the scriptures obeying the word
[28:47] of god redeeming the time
[28:49] it reminds me of what stephen said in
[28:51] acts chapter 7 ye always do resist the
[28:53] holy ghost
[28:55] so people that falsely interpret the
[28:57] without sensation quote it's likely
[28:59] they're the ones that are resisting the
[29:00] move of the holy spirit they're afraid
[29:02] of what will happen they're afraid of
[29:04] what they'll have to give up if they do
[29:06] get born again
[29:07] just like the type of israel going into
[29:09] the promised land at kadesh barnea they
[29:12] were afraid of the giants
[29:14] some people are afraid of the battles
[29:16] they'll have to face
[29:17] if they get born again
[29:19] they're afraid of the persecution
[29:21] afraid of the struggles
[29:22] afraid of the criticism
[29:24] but a child of god just wants god's
[29:26] spirit the spirit of their father to
[29:28] indwell them
[29:30] and be the seal in their soul until the
[29:32] day of redemption
[29:34] in closing
[29:36] i hope this video was a blessing friends
[29:37] this was a question one of the viewers
[29:39] had and i had it a couple times within a
[29:41] week so i felt compelled perhaps i
[29:43] should make a video on this
[29:45] again friends we must take every quote
[29:47] back to the bible
[29:48] the bible says prove all things
[29:50] and if we have the holy ghost baptism
[29:53] and if we've had a sensational
[29:54] experience with the baptism of the holy
[29:56] ghost then the holy ghost will guide us
[29:58] into all truth and jesus said thy word
[30:00] is truth the holy ghost will always
[30:03] point us back to the word of god and
[30:05] when we do that we understand the holy
[30:06] ghost baptism experience can never
[30:08] change
[30:09] and that will help us interpret the
[30:10] without sensation quote to mean that
[30:13] brother branham is saying we don't have
[30:14] to speak in tongues to know we're born
[30:16] again
[30:16] there's no certain evidence for the
[30:18] baptism of the holy ghost
[30:20] but when you have a real holy ghost
[30:21] baptism experience it'll be something
[30:23] people can see and hear
[30:25] just as peter said on the day of
[30:27] pentecost and also in acts 11 15.
[30:31] if you have any questions concerns or
[30:34] testimonies about this video please
[30:35] contact me
[30:39] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[30:41] the desire of your heart
