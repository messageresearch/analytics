[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] now you that don't believe in music in
[0:04] the church what about that and the
[0:07] spirit of the Lord come up the prophet
[0:09] when the music was
[0:12] playing greetings friends in the
[0:14] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:17] I'm Pastor Jesse Smith from bride of
[0:19] Christ Fellowship in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:22] defend the Bible revelations Jesus
[0:24] Christ revealed to his Prophet The Late
[0:26] William brandham 19091 1965
[0:30] 5 welcome to part two of our video
[0:32] series on William brandham rock and roll
[0:35] and music in part one we covered the
[0:38] vision the Lord Jesus gave to brother
[0:40] brandham to condemn rock and roll and
[0:43] warn the Bride of Jesus Christ to stay
[0:45] away from rock and roll and of course
[0:47] all sins as brother random ended The
[0:49] Vision by shouting out stay in
[0:52] line now here in part two we will go
[0:55] through eight Bible requirements for
[0:56] music and songs and of course there
[0:58] could be more Bible requirements and I'm
[1:01] not a musician so I'm not an expert on
[1:03] this subject I'm just trying to rightly
[1:04] divide the scriptures in the area of
[1:07] music and songs I'm relying upon the
[1:10] wisdom and discernment of the Holy Ghost
[1:12] in this area by the grace of our Lord
[1:15] Bible requirement number one is we must
[1:17] prove what music pleases God because
[1:20] every sound and song has a
[1:24] meaning friends it is the job of the
[1:27] pastor song leader and every musician
[1:30] along with every Christian to prove the
[1:32] music and songs that please the Holy
[1:35] Spirit Ephesians 59 and 10 speak of the
[1:39] fruit of the spirit in all goodness and
[1:41] righteousness and Truth proving what is
[1:43] acceptable unto the Lord 1 Thessalonians
[1:45] 521 prove all things hold fast that
[1:48] which is good and then a main text about
[1:51] sounds and identifying the meanings of
[1:53] them is 1 Corinthians 14 6-11 in context
[1:58] this is referring to tongues
[2:00] interpretation but this is easily
[2:02] relatable to music Paul says things
[2:05] giving sound except they give a
[2:07] distinction in the sound how shall be
[2:09] known what is piped or harped the Bible
[2:11] says for the trumpet give an uncertain
[2:13] sound who shall prepare himself for
[2:14] battle likewise except you utter by the
[2:17] Tongue words easy to be understood how
[2:20] shall be known what is spoken so we can
[2:23] see the scripture is emphasizing
[2:25] understanding the meaning of the sound
[2:27] the meaning of the voice so must apply
[2:30] that to
[2:31] music and remember Exodus 32:1 17-19
[2:35] from part one Joshua thought he heard a
[2:38] noise of war in the camp but Moses
[2:40] understood the meaning of the sound it
[2:42] was the noise of them that sing and this
[2:45] was a song and dance of idolatry so
[2:48] that's what we must listen for we must
[2:50] listen for which songs sound like
[2:52] idolatry where the focus is off of the
[2:55] Lord Jesus Christ and its focus is
[2:57] exalting the flesh exal in the lust of
[3:00] the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life
[3:03] and as a brother shared with me I
[3:04] believe it was brother Alex he said
[3:06] there must be a difference in our
[3:07] worship services in the message of the
[3:09] hour the Holy Ghost filled churches
[3:12] compared to the worship Services of CCM
[3:16] churches or mega
[3:18] churches this is found of course in
[3:20] Ezekiel 44:23 in context it's speaking
[3:23] of the Jewish priest but we can see how
[3:26] it was God's desire for the teachers or
[3:29] the Priests of Israel to teach the
[3:32] people the difference between the holy
[3:34] and profane and cause them to discern
[3:37] between the unclean and the clean so we
[3:39] can take this verse along with prove all
[3:41] things and then the verses in 1
[3:43] Corinthians 14 to show how we must we
[3:45] must prove what kind of music and sounds
[3:48] God approves of and also be able to
[3:50] discern which ones god disproves of the
[3:55] second and third Bible requirements for
[3:56] music and songs are second loud songs
[4:01] and also skillful
[4:03] musicians this is found in Psalm 33:3
[4:06] sing unto him a new song plays
[4:08] skillfully with a loud noise so with
[4:11] this requirement we see the variety in
[4:13] music we can see how loud crescendos
[4:16] then are acceptable they're part of
[4:18] God's variety of Music the Bible says
[4:21] play loud but it doesn't say how loud so
[4:24] we have to find a god honoring balance
[4:26] with the loudness of course as any
[4:29] honest person knows God can move in a
[4:30] loud atmosphere such as the loud
[4:32] rejoicing and praise of the multitude in
[4:34] Luke
[4:35] 19:37 and Jesus refused to stop that
[4:38] multitude from the loud praising and
[4:40] rejoicing Jesus sanctioned the loud
[4:43] shouting and rejoicing but God can also
[4:46] move in a quiet atmosphere like the
[4:47] still Small Voice First Kings 19:12
[4:50] although it is important to note that
[4:52] the Lord's presence caused the loud
[4:54] earthquake Wind and Fire as First Kings
[4:58] 19:11 say says so God's presence did
[5:01] cause a lot of noise but then his voice
[5:03] was a still Small Voice and also recall
[5:06] the book of Exodus where God thundered
[5:08] out his voice from Mount Si and the
[5:11] people didn't want to hear directly from
[5:12] God anymore so God speaks in both loud
[5:15] and quiet voices here's a quote from
[5:17] brother brandom from seeking after Jesus
[5:19] where brother R said play softly only
[5:21] believe so we can see brother Bram like
[5:23] soft music and notice he says how many
[5:25] believes that the spirit of God comes in
[5:26] music let's listen to the quote and if
[5:29] you will my sister s uh play softly only
[5:34] believe if you will or abide with me
[5:35] something like
[5:37] that how many believes that the spirit
[5:39] of God comes in music now on the other
[5:42] end of the spectrum here's a quote from
[5:44] what does thou hear 1959 brother brandom
[5:47] says America loves noise they got to
[5:48] have it so loud it'll blast your eard
[5:50] drums out nearly all the noise all the
[5:52] time of the day so see the Bible says we
[5:56] want loud music but we don't want it too
[5:58] loud where people's eard drums are hurt
[6:00] let's listen to the quote that's what
[6:03] I'm thinking today friends we people are
[6:06] so are so carried away with all the
[6:09] noise so America loves noise look at
[6:12] what they're doing they turn on these
[6:14] old radios just as hard as they can with
[6:17] rock and roll and booly woly all that
[6:19] kind of stuff they've got to have it so
[6:21] loud it'll blast your eard drums out
[6:24] nearly all the noise all the time of the
[6:28] day
[6:29] the fourth requirement for music and
[6:31] songs is the requirement of instruments
[6:34] and how instruments are acceptable we
[6:37] find this in Luke 15:25 Jesus's Parable
[6:40] told about the Elder son drawing n to
[6:42] the house and he heard music and dancing
[6:44] in the Greek that word music can mean
[6:47] Unison of sound that is a concert of
[6:49] instruments harmonious note of course
[6:52] there's more support for this as well
[6:54] the New Testament is a better Covenant
[6:56] with better promises as Hebrews 8:6 says
[6:59] and there there's no prohibition of
[7:00] instruments in the New Testament recall
[7:02] God loved David's worship as a man after
[7:05] God's Own Heart and David was the one
[7:07] who instituted musicians in the daily
[7:10] worship of Jehovah in 1st Chronicles
[7:13] 23:5 2 Chronicles 7:6 and it's acts
[7:16] 13:22 that says David was a man after
[7:19] God's Own Heart so by all these proofs
[7:21] we conclude the use of instruments is
[7:23] undoubtedly a blessing in the New
[7:25] Testament as long as they're used to the
[7:26] glory of God here's a quote where
[7:29] brother
[7:29] connects isua Pentecostals to having old
[7:33] guitars and singing in the streets and
[7:35] brother Ram speaks of it in a positive
[7:36] way 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given
[7:38] for let's listen to the
[7:41] quote I remember Pentecostal conversions
[7:44] is Holy Ghost fi
[7:48] conversions in a minority to start with
[7:51] on the side of the alley out there with
[7:53] a old guitar and women couldn't even
[7:56] afford a pair of
[7:58] stockings well out on the railroad
[8:00] tracks and picking up corn and mash it
[8:02] and making bread for their children but
[8:05] what's it come
[8:06] to the most powerful standing Church in
[8:10] the world
[8:11] today not in the eyes of the world but
[8:14] in the eyes of God because he proves it
[8:17] for what he's doing for him he's pouring
[8:19] himself into them pouring it in here's
[8:24] another quote from identified with
[8:26] Christ 1959 brother random said he was
[8:29] out West in Arizona and a man named slim
[8:31] and his friend were on the guitar
[8:33] helping bring the spirit upon brother
[8:34] brandham that got him ready to
[8:36] eventually repent shortly thereafter
[8:39] let's listen to the quote a brother one
[8:42] time way back up down in the mountains
[8:45] in Arizona bringing down a herd of
[8:47] cattle one night I sitting there and a
[8:50] boy named slim had an old home with a
[8:53] piece of paper over he was playing and
[8:56] another fell sitting there from Texas
[8:58] with a get to our struming and they come
[9:01] on to him I had my saddle off the horse
[9:05] laying down my head using it for a
[9:07] pillar and my blanket up all me there
[9:10] still with my boots on a pair of Spurs
[9:12] holding me up off the ground and he
[9:15] begin to scum down at the cross where my
[9:18] savior died down therefore for cleansing
[9:22] from sin I cried there to my heart was a
[9:27] blood applied glor glory to his name I
[9:31] try to pull a blanket up and stop my
[9:33] ears up I look up the stars hanging low
[9:36] and them Whispering Pines in the
[9:38] mountains seem to cry Adam Where Art
[9:42] Thou oh cattle raising was a second
[9:47] thing I wanted to find God way back out
[9:52] there kicked up on a pair of those Spurs
[9:55] I said sir I don't know who you are but
[9:58] don't punish me until I can find the
[10:01] real thing two days after that down in
[10:04] the city sitting there and I after a few
[10:07] days after that after round up I sitting
[10:10] there on a little old park bench little
[10:12] Spanish girl come by I was sitting there
[10:15] thinking about God what could it be and
[10:18] the little girl come by me just about
[10:20] 18year old boy she Dred her hand and
[10:23] walk by I said woman you dropped your
[10:26] handkerchief just the thoughts of G had
[10:29] changed my
[10:32] desire a poor Irish heart was a hunger I
[10:37] wanted something something that
[10:41] satisfies one more thought about
[10:43] instruments as a brother shared with me
[10:45] I believe it was brother Alex again when
[10:46] we get into specific instruments in part
[10:49] three of this series like drums electric
[10:51] guitar bass guitar Etc we have to be
[10:54] very careful how we use these
[10:56] instruments because it's a lot like
[10:58] driving a a Ferrari a Ferrari has lots
[11:01] of power and it's hard to handle all
[11:03] that power and so the same is true with
[11:06] drums electric guitar bass guitar these
[11:08] instruments have a lot of power or
[11:10] influence over the music and so it takes
[11:13] someone who's very disciplined someone
[11:15] who has a lot of temperance that can
[11:17] play these instruments in a way that
[11:19] pleases the holy spirit that person has
[11:22] to be led of the Holy Spirit to handle
[11:24] all that power and keep that power under
[11:26] control keep those instruments under
[11:28] control control of the Holy Spirit and
[11:30] again we'll see more of this fully
[11:32] explained in the third video in this
[11:33] series Lord
[11:35] willing the fifth requirement for music
[11:38] and songs is that music must create an
[11:40] atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to move
[11:43] this is according to 2 Kings 3: 5 Elisha
[11:46] said bring me a Minstrel when the
[11:48] minstrel played the hand of the Lord
[11:49] came upon him and here's a further part
[11:52] of this quote where brother Ram was
[11:53] speaking of playing softly only believe
[11:56] and he says the spirit of God comes in
[11:58] music and he references Elisha let's
[12:00] listen to the quote and if you will my
[12:02] sister s uh play softly only believe if
[12:07] you will or abide with me something like
[12:09] that how many believes that the spirit
[12:12] of God comes in music remember when
[12:15] Elisha got all stewed up one time
[12:18] and he said if it wasn't I respected the
[12:21] presence of Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even
[12:23] look at you is that right but he said
[12:25] nevertheless bring me a minstral and the
[12:28] music begin to
[12:30] play now you that don't believe in music
[12:32] in the church what about that and the
[12:35] spirit of the Lord come up on the
[12:36] prophet when the music was playing so
[12:39] every church is required to play music
[12:42] that will create an atmosphere for the
[12:43] Holy Ghost to move for gifts to operate
[12:46] for prayers to be
[12:47] answered the sixth Bible requirement for
[12:49] music and songs is that we must sing new
[12:52] songs and of course this would include
[12:54] new music again according to Psalm 33:3
[12:57] sing unto him a new song play skillfully
[12:59] with the loud
[13:00] noise now this six requirement will lead
[13:03] to another closely related question
[13:05] should we as message Believers sing
[13:07] songs of famous CCM artists the answer
[13:11] is you take your own liberty to answer
[13:14] this question for your church
[13:16] individually each church is Sovereign of
[13:17] itself but one thing is for sure you
[13:20] cannot condemn singing some of the CCM
[13:22] songs if they're scriptural so new songs
[13:26] that include good lyrics can come from
[13:28] bad people or bad seed because these
[13:31] songwriters have the gift to write songs
[13:34] and God gave them those gifts to write
[13:36] the songs and this is the same concept
[13:39] that balum was a bad seed he went to
[13:42] hell According to second Peter chapter 2
[13:44] but he had good prophecy he prophesied
[13:47] at the star of Jacob so gifts of God in
[13:49] people's lives like songwriters from
[13:52] Hillsong or bethl can produce
[13:55] god-honoring songs despite the lives of
[13:57] these songwriters being being sinful at
[13:59] times or maybe sinful most of the time I
[14:02] don't know so this means pastors song
[14:04] leaders musicians and every Christian is
[14:06] then required to discern each song and
[14:09] the lyrics to ensure they are scriptural
[14:11] lyrics here's a quote where brother
[14:13] random said the wise men had to follow
[14:15] the prophecy of balum from 1954 let's
[14:18] listen to the
[14:19] quote and as it was for Jesus so was a
[14:22] Morning Star ass signed to the wise man
[14:26] that came from the East there had heard
[14:29] that there would be a star of Jacob rise
[14:32] balam the prophet prophesied of it and
[14:35] they knew that there would be a star
[14:37] arise and this star would be the sign
[14:40] that there'd be a King born on the Earth
[14:43] that would be a savior to all the
[14:46] nations and when they seen this star
[14:49] arise it was a sign to them to get ready
[14:52] yes sir that the Redemption was at hand
[14:57] yes here's another quote from there is a
[14:59] man here that can turn on a light 1963
[15:02] brother Ram said balum was a prophet
[15:04] truly and he prophesied a star would
[15:06] rise out of Jacob and then the Wise Men
[15:08] followed this prophecy so we see wise
[15:11] men following the prophecy from a gift
[15:13] of God from a prophet who eventually
[15:16] went to hell let's listen to the quote
[15:18] and then we find out that balum the
[15:21] prophet back in numbers
[15:25] 2417 uh balum was kindly of Mai
[15:30] himself he was a prophet
[15:32] truly and he prophesied here and said a
[15:36] star would rise out of
[15:39] Jacob and when these wise men saw that
[15:44] the word of God said a star would rise
[15:46] out of Jacob they followed that little
[15:50] god-given
[15:51] token to the source of eternal
[15:56] life then again here in the anointed
[15:59] ones of the end time 1965 brother Ram
[16:01] said the prophecy of bam was correct it
[16:03] was his teaching that was false brother
[16:06] Ram said the anointing of God upon
[16:07] balam's gift wouldn't speak nothing else
[16:10] and God Vindicated by proving it was the
[16:12] truth but Ram said it was the teaching
[16:14] of balum that was wrong let's listen to
[16:16] the quote now the teaching of balum not
[16:21] the prophecy of baam that was all right
[16:24] that was
[16:26] God how many believ that
[16:29] amen the prophecy of bam was exactly
[16:31] right because he couldn't speak nothing
[16:32] else the anointing of God wouldn't speak
[16:34] nothing
[16:37] else and God Vindicated it by proving it
[16:40] was the truth but it was the teaching of
[16:43] baam anointed ones but their teaching is
[16:48] false trinities and all things like that
[16:53] wrong
[16:54] Antichrist here's another point I want
[16:56] to make some people say we should should
[16:58] not sing new songs only old songs but
[17:01] friends at some point every song We Sing
[17:03] was a new song so that begs the question
[17:06] so how far back do we go only songs from
[17:09] the 19th century or the first half of
[17:12] the 20th century or do we only do songs
[17:14] that were written during brother bram's
[17:15] lifetime what about all these wonderful
[17:17] songs that have been written after
[17:19] brother Bram went off the scene so I
[17:21] believe that God still has people today
[17:23] that have the gift to write songs and
[17:25] then they must be faithful with their
[17:27] gift to write a song they don't want to
[17:29] bury their songwriting gift in the
[17:30] ground like Jesus's parable of the
[17:32] talents because Jesus called that man
[17:35] Wicked and lazy we don't want to be
[17:36] Wicked and lazy with our gifts to write
[17:38] songs so this Bible requirement of
[17:40] writing new songs is good because it
[17:42] requires Believers to invest in their
[17:44] own songwriting gifts Believers should
[17:46] not waste their gifts before moving on
[17:49] to the next requirement note this quote
[17:52] from 1957 brother brandom says he said
[17:55] there's something about those
[17:56] old-fashioned songs the oldtime hymn I'd
[17:59] rather have them than all these worldly
[18:01] songs put in and of course this is a
[18:03] beautiful quote but notice brother Ram
[18:05] said worldly songs he didn't say new
[18:07] Christian Godly songs so this quote
[18:09] balances out we need new songs but
[18:11] brother Ram is basically saying those
[18:13] old songs are wonderful and anointed of
[18:15] the Holy Ghost as well so that's what we
[18:17] need today as message Believers as Holy
[18:19] Ghost filled Saints we need both new
[18:21] songs but we cannot forget the old songs
[18:23] let's listen to the
[18:25] quote don't you just love that scouring
[18:29] you feel good raise your hands there's
[18:32] something about those
[18:33] oldfashioned songs the old time him I'd
[18:37] rather have in all these new worldly
[18:40] songs put in in and Christian churches I
[18:44] like that old I like
[18:46] [Music]
[18:48] Jesus
[18:51] Keep
[18:52] [Music]
[18:57] Me
[18:59] [Music]
[19:00] there the
[19:06] [Music]
[19:09] preious
[19:11] free to
[19:14] all our
[19:20] healing
[19:23] BL from
[19:27] C
[19:29] [Music]
[19:33] in
[19:37] the
[19:39] in the
[19:42] cross oh
[19:44] be my
[19:53] glory
[19:55] he my r
[19:59] [Music]
[20:01] Soul shall
[20:09] find
[20:11] [Music]
[20:15] the I could go out of the world pretty
[20:18] easy when that's being say couldn't you
[20:21] how wonderful has it all
[20:23] settled you know I'm glad I done settled
[20:27] it all up aren't you
[20:29] the old accounts all settled long time
[20:33] ago the seventh Bible requirement for
[20:36] music and songs is we must include these
[20:38] types of songs Psalms hymns spiritual
[20:41] songs making Melody and songs of thanks
[20:45] this is found in Ephesians
[20:47] 518-20 the Bible says speaking
[20:49] yourselves in Psalms now in the Greek
[20:51] this means a striking or twanging
[20:53] striking the chords of a musical
[20:55] instrument used of the book of Psalms of
[20:58] course from the Old Testament the word
[21:00] hymn In the Greek here means a song in
[21:02] the tithe Praise of God a sacred song
[21:06] the word melody in the Greek means to
[21:07] cause to vibrate by touching to twang to
[21:10] touch or strike the chord to twang the
[21:13] strings of a musical instruments so that
[21:15] they gently vibrate to play on a string
[21:17] instrument to play the harp Etc to play
[21:20] to sing to the music of the harp in the
[21:23] New Testament to sing A Hymn to
[21:24] celebrate the Praises of God in song
[21:27] then verse 20 says giving thanks always
[21:29] for all things unto God the eighth and
[21:31] final Bible requirement for music and
[21:33] songs is songs that use the name of
[21:35] Jesus Christ and his word in Acts 4:17
[21:39] and 18 the apostles were threatened that
[21:41] they should speak henceforth to no man
[21:44] in this name of Jesus they commanded
[21:47] them not to speak at all nor teach in
[21:49] the name of Jesus anyone knows that
[21:51] songs have great power and potential to
[21:54] teach and so we must speak and teach in
[21:57] the name of Jesus Jesus we must speak
[21:59] about Jesus in our songs we must teach
[22:01] about Jesus in our songs we must not add
[22:04] to the word of God nor take away
[22:06] according to Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 we
[22:09] must not change the gospel with any
[22:12] lyrics in our songs according to
[22:14] Galatians 1: 8
[22:15] and9 Paul said If any man preach any
[22:18] other gospel unto you than that which
[22:19] you have received let him be ACC cursed
[22:21] I share two examples before finishing up
[22:24] here when I first came in the message
[22:25] there was a song that came out by SAA it
[22:28] was called You Raise Me Up I remember
[22:29] listening this song the first few times
[22:31] when people sang it as a song special or
[22:33] we sang at the church and I just kept
[22:34] asking myself where is the name of Jesus
[22:37] in this song and it bothered me a little
[22:39] bit and I guess it still bothers me to
[22:41] this day so I think if we're going to
[22:43] sing this song which we don't sing it at
[22:45] our church but if we did we would need
[22:47] to add the name of Jesus to this song
[22:49] now we don't want to be legalistic
[22:51] either for example when a preacher is
[22:53] called to the pulpit some Churches might
[22:54] sing the course only believe and maybe
[22:56] they'll just say only believe all all
[22:58] things are possible only believe and of
[23:00] course the name of God or Jesus is not
[23:02] used in just that course of the song so
[23:04] we're not trying to be legalistic we
[23:06] want to meet the requirement that we
[23:08] should use the name of Jesus Christ
[23:11] another example is the song you say by
[23:13] Lauren dagel now we have never sang this
[23:16] song at our church mainly because of the
[23:18] lack of Christian lyrics this song
[23:20] doesn't say God or Lord or Jesus but
[23:22] I've heard message churches sing this
[23:24] song and so as Pastor I've never thought
[23:26] this song was a good song to sing and of
[23:29] course we despise the style clothing Pro
[23:33] lgbtq stance of Lauren dagel we would
[23:36] never support her as an artist or
[23:38] Christian musician but the main issue
[23:40] with this song is the lyrics the lyrics
[23:43] are missing the name of Jesus
[23:45] Christ in closing friends I hope part
[23:49] two has been a blessing by the grace of
[23:50] God I hope these eight Bible
[23:52] requirements for music and songs were
[23:53] helpful for you as the Bible and brother
[23:56] Ram taught us we must take everything
[23:57] back back to the word of God the word of
[23:59] God is our foundation the word of God is
[24:01] our absolute and so please let me know
[24:03] if this video was helpful as I said in
[24:06] the podcast in relation to music please
[24:08] send me any questions for future videos
[24:11] and by God's grace we'll try to answer
[24:12] them the best we can I'm definitely
[24:14] looking forward to part three with
[24:15] defining rock and roll I would say this
[24:18] would probably be the most important
[24:19] video in the series I'll try to show
[24:22] real examples from CCM artists and by
[24:25] the help of God find the balance so we
[24:27] can clearly discern rock and roll that
[24:29] should be condemned and differentiated
[24:31] between holy Godly music and we should
[24:33] be able to enjoy the liberty of the Holy
[24:35] Ghost that the Holy Ghost gives us with
[24:37] instruments new songs volume and so
[24:39] forth if you have any questions concerns
[24:42] or testimonies about this video please
[24:44] contact
[24:45] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[24:48] the desire of your
[24:50] [Music]
[24:52] heart
