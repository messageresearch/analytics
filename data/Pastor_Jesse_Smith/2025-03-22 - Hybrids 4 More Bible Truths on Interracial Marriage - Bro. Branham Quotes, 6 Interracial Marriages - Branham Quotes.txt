TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and he married a gentile woman that produced Ephraim and Manasses which was J A into the kingdom into the Patriotic promise and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show four more truths about the validity of interracial marriage according to the Bible this video then is a followup to a video I put out on February 22nd about interracial marriage and how God's Prophet the true Prophet brother William Mar and brandham said Moses's marriage to Zapora was perfect because it was God's choice so God chose for Moses to marry outside of his race outside of his nationality Moses married an Ethiopian woman Zapora and that was perfect in the plan of God so these next three or four points were Quicken to me this morning as I was working on my latest podcast also that defends the message and so let me briefly go through these four points here by God's grace first the thought came to me that all of brother Ram's quotes about the six interracial couples from the Bible are all positive brother RAM does not say one negative thing about these six couples that were married in we' say in interracial marriages let's go through those couples the first one of course Moses and Zapora second Uriah and basheba third Ruth and Boaz fourth Rahab and Solon fifth Joseph and azth and a new one at least for me was Esther and King Xerxes the Persian king so later in the video we'll get to quotes on those but let's look at the second point now the second point is that these interracial marriages are not worldly someone made a comment on my February 22nd video that said interracial marriages are worldly and I'm pretty sure I know the famous preacher where this person got that statement from so the second point is that interracial marriages are not worldly because if you say that you're actually calling God worldly and God is Not worldly God is Holy the critics of interracial marriage cannot call God both worldly and holy God is Holy and again if you take the quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham the interracial marriage of Moses and Zapora was perfect and God's choice the third point is that other critics from that February 22nd video called the children of interracial marriage couples hybrids and so this morning I found a quote where brother brandom said Joseph and azen's children were heirs to the kingdom so this quote demolishes this weak argument that the children of interracial marriage couples are hybrids they're not hybrids if they're Believers they're heirs to the kingdom of God and of course we'll prove that by the scriptures and the quotes in a moment here and the fourth point is that a Critic said the interracial marriage examples from the Bible that I've listed are the only ones that God allowed because they are types of Christ and the church and of course that is ridiculous all marriages are a type of Christ in the church according to Ephesians chap 5 and then Ephesians 3 says one of the mysteries of God is to show that the Jew and Gentile Believers in Christ are of the same body so the person just needs to read Ephesians 3 1-9 if they really want the truth by the grace of God so I hope it's plain for our viewers to see that these four points further prove that God is for interracial marriage when he ordains it interracial marriages are few and far between and we're thankful for the continual revelation of the Holy Spirit from the Bible brother Ram said the holy spirit will only point you to the Bible the holy spirit will not point you away from the Bible because the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that the holy spirit is a compass the North Star is the word and the compass will only point to the north star and the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word not some ecumenical move not some denomination but to the word of God Amen you remember all the other stars shift with the world but the North Star stays exactly because it's in a center and every other man's word will fail but God's word Can't Fail it's a NSTAR Center it won't shift with the world no matter where the world is it Remains the same yesterday today and forever and he is the world now the compass is the Holy Spirit and the your your tie poost would be the North Star so the holy spirit will always Point towards the word hallelujah the holy spirit will never lead you to anything else but the word of God that's so how could a man accept the Creed when it's contrary to the word and then still say he has the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has point you away from that it takes the Holy Spirit to point you to the word for he is the word he is the word and it can only as the um as the magnet in the compass is only set towards the North Pole that's the only way it can draw and when the Holy Spirit is the author and writer and the quickener of the word how can it point the person to anything else but the word so now let's go through these quotes on the these six interracial marriage Couples from the Bible by God's grace first we'll start with Moses and Zapora of course these two quotes are repeat from the February 22nd video brother ram calls it perfect and then brother ram calls it God's choice let's listen to the quotes and Mariam showed her try too when she laughed because Moses married this Negro girl and said wasn't there other girls to be married and so forth he could done it and God wasn't pleased with that and smot her with leprosy and her own brother screamed out and said would you let your sister die in that shape and God told Moses to come before him and he went and interceded for for marrying she didn't live long after that no brother what God does is perfect we ain't got no business with our minds putting anything to it just leave it the way it is God did it God said it that settles it just take it I don't know how if I could explain it that I be equal with God I can't explain it I just believe it oh that's all I'm asked to do and there one day we find out that even Mariam a propheus and Aaron the high priest made fun of moses' wife because she was an Ethiopian and thought was there enough women of our own group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that wasn't moses' choice that was God's choice for Moses amen and when they made fun of it that angered God in such a way until he struck Miriam the prophetes full of leprosy moses' own sister what about that her a prophetess but what was she doing she was making fun in an ear reverence to God's messenger amen the messenger of the Covenant of that day and she was irreverent and also Aaron the high priest the very mouthiest of Moses yeah right next let's look at Uriah and basba I'll just look at these quotes that brother R mentioned Uriah brother R called Uriah a gallant soldier in one quote in another quote he said he wanted to go up and tell Uriah in heaven that his testimony meant something to brother brandham notice brother Bram never criti izes Uriah for his interracial marriage Uriah was a hittite bash of course was a Jew they were not supposed to marry under the conditions when the hittite was an unbeliever but Uriah was a proelite so Uriah was a genuine believer in the god of Israel so of course they were allowed to marry because he was a proelite and notice that brother Braham didn't say well when I get to heaven I'm going to go up to Uriah and say your interracial marriage was wrong and if you would had any children they would would have been hybrid that's not what brother Bram said because we know both the Bible and brother brandham put Uriah in a very positive light let's listen to the quotes and she was to be mother and brought her in so that he could lay it on Ur and he was not a gentile he was not a Jew he was a gentile amen and he was a hati a proelite to the Jewish religion brother when I get to Glory I want to walk up to your and shake his hands and say God be praise for your testimony meant something to me in my Earthly Journey amen but you're are that Gallant Soldier being yet only a proelite he was a gentile a hatip but he said God forbid me to go down with my wife in the ark of my God on the battlefield when I cross the line between this life and that one there I want to shake your eyes hand he was a real man amen the third example is Ruth and Boaz of course Ruth was a moabitas moabites were not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord of course in the state that they were heathens or unbelievers but if they were prosites then they were allowed to worship almighty God and Ruth is the best example notice brother Bram says Ruth Story is a beautiful story brother Bram also says it's a beautiful type of Christ in the church notice brother Ram doesn't say Ruth and Boaz is an interracial Mar marriage story of compromise and worldliness and one of the most powerful points is that Ruth's son OED was not a hybrid OED was in the lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ because it went OED Jesse David and then 14 Generations I believe later was the Christ so all these critics and accusations come to nothing in the light of the truth of the Holy Scripture let's listen to the quotes and now Ruth the night woman was a beautiful type of the Gentile bride the beautiful story of of Ruth when returning with neom when neom had lost all of her inheritance and Boaz brought it back I believe I preached on that the last time of year a beautiful picture then we find after he come over and after he come Boaz and there come another Gentile in which he come in by Ruth and out of there come Jess out of Jess come David and a little Hillside stable out there brought forth the King of Kings Jesus Christ the son of David his spiritual son next let's look at Ester and Xerxes brother Ram said Esther is a type of the church today in the sweetness of the Holy Spirit not in the worldliness of some type of make believer or hybrid believer so a Jew marrying a Persian would have been an interracial marriage but it was part of God's perfect plan it was God's choice just like with Moses and Zapora it was God's choice to use Esther to save the Jewish people God is so wonderful God Is So Perfect God is so amazing let's listen to the quotes on Esther Esther was a type of the church today those who are ready to come out and Adorn themselves with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit not the perfuming and the dressing of the world try to compare with them but that hidden man of the heart that's the one next is Rahab and Salon brother Ram said Rahab is a type of the true church not the compromising Church she's a type of the believer today the real believer brother brandom says notice brother randam does not say she's a type of the make believer or the worldly believer or the foolish virgin or something like that brother R always makes her out to be a True Believer she was a Canaanite living in Jericho Jews were not supposed to Mary Canaanites and heathens from other nations but the fact is Rahab was not a heathen she became a believer the fear of the Lord Came Upon her when she heard about God bringing Israel out of Egypt she became a Believer therefore Solon could marry her so let's listen to the quotes on Rahab Rahab didn't ask to see Joshua's sign she just heard a type of the church a type of the true church that's been pulled away at prostitution I'm a Methodist today a Baptist a presbyterian the next day p P away in prostitution yes now Rahab the Harlot known as the Harlot she was the type of the believer today the real believer she didn't say now I hear that U Joshua can do signs because he's a successor of Moses I'd like to see those signs if I can see those signs then I'll believe it well he didn't absolutely have to show those signs because she believed it anyhow last let's look at Joseph and azth brother random of course uses this couple as a type of Christ in the church in the church age book brother uses this couple as a type for the Gentile Rapture when Joseph reveals himself to his Brethren he puts everybody out of the palace and brother Ram said look the bride Joseph's bride is not with Joseph when Joseph reveals himself to his Brethren showing that the raptured Bride of Jesus Christ will be at the marriage supper of the lamb and not here on the Earth Earth during the tribulation when Jesus reveals himself to the 144,000 now where will the Gentile Church be while Jesus is making himself known to his Brethren remember that the Bride of Joseph with the two children were in the palace where Joseph had commanded let everyone leave me put them all out from before me so the Gentile bride was hidden in the Palace of Joseph where will the Gentile Church go in the Rapture into the palace the bride will be taken all off the Earth she will be caught up before the Great Tribulation to meet her Lord in the air so again this is a beautiful type and the point I want to emphasized is this quote I found just this morning where brother ramam said Joseph and az's children were joint Hees into the kingdom into the patriarch promise so Joseph and aanas children were not hybrids they were not to be looked down upon or disrespected or thought lower than other children that were fully Jew these were half Jew half Egyptian children and they became joint heirs into the kingdom and it's completely scriptural here's a visual I'd like to show you I made this years ago when studying The Book of Life Joseph is originally listed with the 12 sons of Jacob in Genesis 35 22- 26 but in the Book of Numbers Levi is taken out because his inheritance is the Lord the Lord is his portion and then Joseph is out and his two sons go in Ephraim and manasse they in yellow font to make it easier to see now there's an asterisk by Ephraim and Dan because they commit idolatry and God blots their names out from under Heaven not in heaven brother Ram teaches us that in the church age book so there we see the sons of an interracial marriage become heirs to the kingdom they're in numbers 10 11- 28 they were not hybrids they were not less than other Jewish children fully Jewish blooded children they were individual tribes named among the 12 tribes of Israel then in Revelation 7: 4-8 we see the 144,000 tribes receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost during the tribulation period Dan and Ephraim are still out but there's Manasseh Manasseh m is the son of Joseph and azth an interracial marriage Levi and Joseph are back in because of the names being blotted out but then in the Millennium there in Ezekiel 48 brother Ram tells us all the names are restored so we see Ephraim back in Dan back in and so we see the conclusion throughout all thousand years of the Millennium Ephraim and manasse their tribes will be counted in the 12 tribes of Israel proving they were not hybrid they were not less than they're not to be looked down upon they were chosen in the mind of God before the foundation of the world as the Bible tells us in Ephesians 1 so here's a quote I'd like to play Israel and the church part 1 1953 brother random says he married Gentile woman that produced Ephraim and Manasseh which was joint heirs into the kingdom into the patriarchic promise let's listen to the quote Joseph was given a gentile bride he was rejected of his brothers and turned and took a gentile bride is that right he gave him Pharaoh gave him the priest of or a daughter for a bride and he married a Gentile woman that produced Ephraim and Manasses which was Jord a into the king into the Patriotic promise in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again these three or four ideas and points kind of came to me this morning so I just thought when I catch the inspiration of the Holy Ghost I'll go back to the scripture quickly go to the quotes and then share them with the Saints by the grace of God so I hope this was a blessing God's word can never fail God's word is always true the word of God sets us free and remember friends if you are forgiven through the blood of Jesus Christ through faith in Jesus Christ you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you are a child of Abraham according to the book of Galatians then if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you are an adopted son or daughter into the kingdom of God that also makes you a king and priest unto God no matter what your natural Human family Tree is like whether you came from an interracial marriage or not God is not looking at the natural seed anymore he's looking at the spiritual seed according to 1 Peter 1:23 we must be born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God that's one reason God showed us the revelation of the serpent seed because all humans are hybrid with the sin nature they're not like the original humans Adam and Eve who had no sin no all of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God so we need a new birth we need a new seed and it's a spiritual seed by the grace of God thank God for the spiritual seed of the baptis AP ISM of the Holy Ghost it's shed abroad in our hearts as Acts chapter 2 says let's continue to share this message with every people Kindred nation and tongue according to Revelation 10 8-11 let's keep eating the book The Revelations from the Bible that were restored to us through God's Prophet brother William brandham let's prophesy them again let's share them again until the last one comes in if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
