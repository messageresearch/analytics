TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on me but every hour I confess it constantly I wouldn't try to go to heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ I go in on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question do I believe the supposed Ed 1964 prophecy of Kenneth Hagen prophesying of brother bram's passing my answer is no I do not believe it was a genuine prophecy I'll have three reasons to share about that in this video by God's grace I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late William brandham 1909 to 196 5 I also defend William branham's Godly Christian character again my answer is no I do not believe Kenneth heagen gave a genuine prophecy about the death of William brandham let me read the apparent prophecy apparently this prophecy is from Kenneth hain's 1992 book called he gave gifts unto men here's a screenshot of the book and apparently the prophecy said at the end of 65 he who now stands in the Forefront of The Healing Ministry as a prophet will be taken out of the way he'll make a false step and Satan shall destroy his life but his spirit will be saved and his Works will follow him air 66 shall come he shall be gone here's the three reasons I do not believe this was a genuine prophecy the first reason is this is an after Thea prophecy this book was not released until 1992 brother bandam died in 1965 so this prophecy is 27 years after the fact there's no proof as far as I know of Kenneth Haagen ever publishing this Prophecy Before brother braham's death so again this is called an after the fact prophecy one of brother Ram's accusers also shared that this prophecy was apparently written in a 1976 book by Freda Lindsay and that might be true I don't know I've never read the book but again even if it was written in 1976 that's still 11 years after brother braham's death so people who trust in this prophecy are Trust ing in after Thea prophecies but remember brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of God I have a video with six fulfilled thus sayith the Lord prophecies from brother brandham that were spoken before the fact and came to pass by the grace of God again as one proof out of many proofs that brother Bram was a genuine prophet of God moving on to the second reason I don't believe this was a genuine prophecy the second reason is because there's no Bible precedent for a genuine prophet of God making one false step and then being allowed to be given over to Satan to destroy his life so even the wording this prophecy is not a Biblical wording the wording was he'll make a false step and Satan shall destroy his life so there is no Bible example of a prophet making one mistake and then God allows that Prophet to be given over to Satan so Satan can destroy his life the only thing close to this we can see in the scripture is 1 Corinthians chapter 5 where a brother was sleeping with his stepmother it was such wickedness Paul says even the Gentiles don't have this type of wickedness and then Paul said deliver that brother over to Satan that his body will be destroyed but his spirit will be saved but then if you read the book of 2 Corinthians you find out this brother repented and he was restored back into Fellowship so there are no Bible examples of a prophet making one false step and then God gives the prophet over to Satan to be destroyed and also as I've been studying brother bram's Ministry now for over 23 years brother Bram did not make a false step in his Ministry that he did not repent of brother BR is such an honest transparent man such a humble Christian that he often talked about his missteps and in every case he admitted it was a sin he repented of it and he got right with God again proving he was a genuine prophet of God and a holy ghost filed Christian and so this prophecy this apparent prophecy could not apply to brother brandham because he did not make a false step that he did not repent of and so God would not need to take him off the scene for a mistake because brother brandham would have repented did of any mistake he made brother Braham said he confessed his sins every day so that means he's forgiven and his sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ every day he's walking in the light as Jesus is in the light I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on me but every hour I confess it constantly when I see my wrong then I turn from that and try to do what's right I wouldn't try to go to heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ he is my trust I I I believe in him I wouldn't try to go in because I'm a Pentecostal brother I I wouldn't go in on the merits of Pentecost I go in on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me and that's what I want you to trust the merits of him and then how you know you're getting there is when every word is you punctuate with an amen amen because it's a word itself trying to vindicate itself and if we deny that word how can it vindicate itself I'm so happy that I know him in the Forgiveness of my sins and with the assurance that my sins are under the blood as I confess them daily to him related to this same idea of after Thea prophecies some of brother bram's accusers say brother bram's seven major visions of 1933 were after the fact and I do agree that there is no recording of the 1933 prophecies when brother Ram actually preached them in 1933 but there is a quote where brother Bram said hands were raised in the brandom Tabernacle that were there when brother spoke the 1933 prophecies and these were hands that were raised in 1961 so 28 years after brother Rah gave the prophecy 28 years after 1933 in 1961 hands went up and said they heard brother B prophesy the seven major Visions let's listen to the quote it's from the 7th week of Daniel 1961 now in 1933 when we were worshiping over here in the Masonic temple where the Church of Christ stands today on one April morning before leaving home I was dedicating my a car I got a 33 model car and I was dedicating to the Lord's service and in a vision I saw the end time amen now I notice how striking this is back in there when I was just a boy and you can imagine what a 1933 model car look like now what look like and I went over there to the Masonic temple where some of you oldtimers in here remembers and throw down an old paper at home it's already in print went out around the world see that was in 1933 and I predicted that there would be some great tragedy happened to this United States before or by the year of 1977 how many remembers me saying that look at the hand now watch I predicted seven things was yet in a making of the before this great consummation or great thing would take place here in the United States some great horrible thing the third reason why I don't believe this Prophecy from Kenneth Haagen is because Kenneth Hagen is a known false teacher there's at least four doctrines that he teaches that are wrong the first was the Prosperity Gospel that God always wants you to be healthy and Wealthy second he allowed women preachers we know 1 Timothy 2 says Paul never allowed women to assur authority over men and preach to men the third false teaching he taught was tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and the final false Doctrine he taught was the word of faith and of course this gets into the name it and claim it false teaching any true Christian knows you just can't name and claim whatever you want you can only speak as you're led by the Holy Spirit that's what brother Bram told us when he was telling about speaking the squirrels into existence in 1964 brother Ram said he never never asked to speak squirrels into existence God led him to speak that and that's how it was with all of the testimonies of the third poll brother using the third poll I think there's five testimonies of that in Look Away to Jesus 1963 and each time it was God leading brother brandham to speak the word of God God was telling brother Bram to speak the word to have faith in the word of God that God revealed to brother brandham so let's play that quote from 19 1964 brother BR said he never asked to speak the squirrels it was God doing it let's listen to the quote you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here Witnesses squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things in like that do these things there I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but it was God that sent him down to Egypt see so friends no one is really sure why God took brother brandom home I've shared this before I believe that God took him home because people were looking too much at the messenger instead of the message the reason I believe that is because brother Ram said that so let's play that quote it's from an absolute January 27th 1963 brother BR said you watch the message don't pay any attention to the messenger God will take it away from you God will share his glory with nobody don't you watch the messenger watch The Message let's listen to the quote I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass by you I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you he'll share his glory as nobody right glory to God don't you watch the messenger watch the message in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God those are the three reasons I do not believe Kenneth Haagen actually gave a prophecy about the death of brother brandham what's sad is that some of brother bram's accusers are actually trusting in this Kenneth haen prophecy even though both Witnesses are after the fact Witnesses and then some accusers of brother Bram they criticize brother brandham for apparent after theact prophecies and yet here they are trusting in after theact prophecies so that doesn't make any sense to me it seems like they are contradicting themselves so we can look at the life of brother brandham he finished the mysteries of God he was a genuine prophet he revealed secrets about the Seven Seals he had the spirit of Elijah anointing him with all the characteristics of Elijah brother R corrected over 110 false teachings that most churches were guilty of teaching brother Ram turned Hearts back to the apostolic fathers in other words the original Revelation that Jesus Christ gave to St Paul so we're so thankful for that by the grace of God let's keep standing on the word of God rightly dividing the word of Truth so in this case rightly dividing supposed prophecies we must do that the Bible said prove all things 1 Thessalonians 5 the Bible says believe not every Spirit but try the spirits in 1 John 4 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
