[0:02] Beginning in the year 1956,
[0:05] God's prophet William Brham began
[0:08] telling a beautiful testimony of a
[0:10] Lutheran dean named Brother Hegree who
[0:14] had at first blasphemed his ministry,
[0:17] but was able to repent, receive
[0:19] correction, and receive the baptism of
[0:22] the Holy Ghost. This is a beautiful
[0:25] encouraging story of how people can go
[0:28] from blaspheming to victory by the grace
[0:31] of almighty God. This is a biblical
[0:34] truth that people can blasphe and yet
[0:37] still be forgiven. It's found in 1
[0:40] Timothy 1:13.
[0:42] St. Paul, who was previously known as
[0:45] Saul, told us he had blasphemed the Holy
[0:47] Ghost in ignorance. Over the years, I've
[0:51] talked to numerous people and they've
[0:53] wondered if they've blasphemed the Holy
[0:55] Ghost for the final time. And I always
[0:57] take them to this verse to encourage
[1:00] them because the Bible is clear. We can
[1:02] blasphe in ignorance and still be
[1:06] forgiven and of course saved. And as the
[1:09] example of St. Paul and Brother Hegree
[1:11] prove, you can also be filled with the
[1:14] Holy Ghost.
[1:16] We know the Lord Jesus Christ spoke of
[1:18] the dangers of blasphemy in Matthew
[1:20] 12:31-32.
[1:23] And those words are true. But there's
[1:25] also the truth that people can blasphe
[1:28] ignorantly and still be forgiven,
[1:30] justified, sanctified, and filled with
[1:32] the Holy Ghost.
[1:34] St. Peter is another great example how
[1:37] he was saved, walked on water, was given
[1:39] the keys to the kingdom, but then denied
[1:41] the Lord Jesus Christ three times, wept
[1:44] bitterly, but God in his grace and
[1:47] mercy, his abundant rich mercy was able
[1:50] to restore Peter and then fill him with
[1:53] the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost.
[1:56] On January 15th, 1957, William Brandham
[1:59] told this story of a Lutheran dean,
[2:01] Brother Hegree, from God Keeps His Word
[2:04] in Sturgis, Michigan. Brother Hegree
[2:06] went to see Brother Brand a minister in
[2:08] Minneapolis. And Brother Hegree wrote
[2:11] Brother Brandham a letter and called him
[2:12] a soothsayer. So that was Brother
[2:15] Hegre's ignorant blasphemy.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it was a a dean of the
[2:19] Lutheran College.
[2:22] He had wrote me a letter and you talk
[2:25] about giving me a good raing over. He
[2:26] gave me one. I was at Minneapolis and he
[2:30] said, "I drove 15 miles last night in a
[2:33] blinding snowstorm thinking I was going
[2:35] to hear a servant of the Lord and what
[2:37] did I find but a polished up
[2:39] soothsayer." And he said, "And your
[2:42] theology is oh my 22 pages in the
[2:48] letter." I know.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Notice William Brandham's reaction. His
[2:53] first reaction to being called a
[2:55] soussayer was, "Well, now that's all
[2:57] right. It's okay."
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Well, now I thought, "Well, now it's all
[3:04] right. I It's okay."
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham wrote him back and
[3:08] noticed the words Brother Brandham used.
[3:11] He said, "Dear beloved brother, I was
[3:14] glad to get your letter. Look at the
[3:17] self-control. Look at the temperance,
[3:19] the longsuffering.
[3:21] Look at the love, the charity of Jesus
[3:23] Christ in the heart of God's prophet,
[3:25] William Brandham. He didn't write him
[3:28] back in anger. He didn't curse him. He
[3:30] didn't lose his cool. He called him
[3:33] beloved brother. He was always glad for
[3:36] friendly criticism.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; So I sat down and I addressed him after
[3:40] he first told me he thought I was a
[3:42] devil. See, a sousayer, which would be a
[3:45] devil, of course. So he said uh you uh
[3:49] uh I said dear beloved brother
[3:53] I was glad to get your letter. I'm
[3:56] always glad for friendly criticism. It
[3:59] helps me helps you if you just take it
[4:01] that way if there somebody criticize you
[4:04] might have some spots that ought to be
[4:05] cleared up. I said, "I'm very happy to
[4:08] get your letter and you must think
[4:12] something of me or you wouldn't have
[4:14] wrote to me."
[4:16] I said, "And then another thing that I
[4:18] admire you for is your 50 years of
[4:21] service for my Lord."
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says the first thing he told
[4:26] him was that he forgives him for calling
[4:29] Brother Brandham a soussayer.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; So I said, "You must love me." And uh I
[4:34] said, "Now the first thing I'm going to
[4:36] say to you, I forgive you for calling me
[4:38] a soothsayer." I said, "Because a devil
[4:42] because you remember Jesus when he was
[4:45] doing that very same thing, saying I can
[4:48] do nothing except I do what the father
[4:51] tells me and was seeing the visions and
[4:53] telling the people what who they were
[4:55] and what they were and what happened and
[4:57] so forth." Brother Ram then goes on to
[5:00] straighten up brother Hegree by saying
[5:02] you can't base your faith on experience.
[5:04] Your faith must be based upon the word
[5:06] of God and Satan cannot cast out Satan.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; I said just to straighten you up,
[5:11] brother.
[5:13] I said, I just like to ask you
[5:15] something. I'm surprised that a Lutheran
[5:17] dean would base his theology up on some
[5:22] sort of an experience.
[5:24] Why?
[5:26] In the Baptist church and the And the
[5:29] first year of school, we learned to base
[5:31] everything upon the Bible.
[5:34] I said, "All our theology must come off
[5:37] the Bible." And here you're trying to
[5:39] base your theology on an experience.
[5:44] Well, now I said to settle it, Jesus
[5:46] said that Satan cannot cast out Satan.
[5:52] That settled it then. If Jesus said
[5:54] Satan can't heal, I don't care what
[5:56] anyone else would say. That's settled.
[5:58] He think he that's all.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Hegry received Brother Bram's
[6:01] letter and wanted to meet with him face
[6:03] to face at a Christian businessman's
[6:05] international convention.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; He wrote me a letter back and said, "Mr.
[6:09] Brandham, I hear you're coming back to
[6:10] the Christian businessman's
[6:12] international convention to speak. So,
[6:13] could I have a few words with you?"
[6:15] &gt;&gt; In that meeting, Brother Hegry wondered
[6:18] about Pentecostal people kicking
[6:21] furniture around. Brother Random quoted
[6:23] Ezekiel 37 and the dry bones coming
[6:26] together as biblical support for the
[6:29] Pentecostals kicking furniture around.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; And as we had our dinner, he said, "I
[6:35] want to ask you a question, Mr. Ram." I
[6:37] said, "Yes." I here it comes. Lutheran
[6:40] demons.
[6:42] He said, "I've been down to the
[6:43] Pentecostal and kick the furniture
[6:45] around and everything like that, but I
[6:46] won't ask you there anything to it." I
[6:48] said, "Yes, sir, there is." I said like
[6:51] a little kid when he gets a toy he just
[6:53] falls. I said like Ezekiel said it's a
[6:55] valley full of dry bones. He said can
[6:58] these live? He said thou knowest. So he
[7:01] said prophesy to the dry bones. And when
[7:03] the bones come together there's a
[7:05] rattling and a shaking. A lot of noise.
[7:09] But then when the skin come on the meat
[7:10] come on them. There wasn't much noise.
[7:12] He said prophesy to the spirit now. I
[7:15] said I think that's what's going on.
[7:18] So I said the I see him make a lot of
[7:20] noise. I said I think the bones are
[7:22] coming together.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Then brother he asked about how to
[7:26] receive the Holy Ghost. If Abraham
[7:28] believed God and was righteous, wasn't
[7:31] believing enough to receive the Holy
[7:33] Ghost? And brother Ram said, "Yes, you
[7:35] have to believe, but God also has to
[7:37] give you a confirmation of your faith."
[7:40] Which for Abraham was the seal of
[7:42] circumcision in his flesh. But for us,
[7:45] it's the circumcision of the soul by the
[7:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then God
[7:50] has recognized your faith.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're hungered and thirsting
[7:54] for God." I said, "It's fine." Said,
[7:57] "And we want you to tell us how to
[7:59] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[8:02] He said, "But Abraham believed God,
[8:03] Brother Brandon, and it was imputed to
[8:05] him for righteous because he believed.
[8:07] What more can a man do but believe?" I
[8:09] said, "That's all a man can do."
[8:11] I said, "You believe and accept Christ
[8:13] as personal savior, that's your faith."
[8:15] But remember, God gave Abraham a seal of
[8:19] circumcision as a confirmation of his
[8:21] faith.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. And I said, "Then that was
[8:24] the Old Testament. In the New Testament,
[8:26] when we say we believe, God gives us the
[8:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is a
[8:29] seal of confirmation."
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; See, Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not
[8:33] the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're
[8:35] sealed until the day of your
[8:36] redemption."
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the seal that God has
[8:39] recognized your faith. But if he hasn't
[8:41] gi you the Holy Ghost yet, he's never
[8:43] recognized your faith. See,
[8:45] &gt;&gt; brother must have received all this
[8:47] correction because he still wants the
[8:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he wanted
[8:52] it there and asked Brother Random how to
[8:54] receive it. He said, "Scoop back your
[8:56] chairs and let's pray." Brother Hegree
[8:59] and his students got on their knees
[9:02] praying on their chairs. Brother Ram
[9:04] laid hands on them and 72 Lutheran
[9:07] students received the baptism of the
[9:09] Holy Ghost with signs and wonders
[9:11] healings following.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; So he said, "We want the Holy Ghost."
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, a Lutheran God. I said, "What's
[9:21] the Lutheran people going to say?" He
[9:23] said, "We don't care what the Lutheran
[9:24] people say. We want God."
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I said, "Wonderful."
[9:30] Uh I said, "When do you want?" He said,
[9:33] "Right now." I said, "Well, scoot back
[9:36] to your place and I will pray." And I
[9:38] had them all go around to the wall like
[9:40] that, laid hands on them. 72 Lutheran
[9:43] students received the baptism of the
[9:45] Holy Ghost. They got signs and wonders
[9:47] and healings going on in the Lutheran
[9:48] College in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[9:50] Praise the Lord.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; And then in spiritual adoption 1956,
[9:55] brother Ram said he even laid his hands
[9:57] on the dean, Brother Hegree, and receive
[9:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, proving
[10:01] we can blasphe in ignorance, and God in
[10:04] his mercy will forgive us and lead us
[10:07] all the way through justification,
[10:09] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[10:11] Holy Ghost.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; I said, "Move back your plates, take
[10:14] your bench, and scoot over against the
[10:15] wall." Each man did all the way around.
[10:18] I said, "Now kneel down and turn your
[10:20] face to the wall and started asking God
[10:22] for the Holy Ghost." And I had brother
[10:23] Moore to stand and pray. I went laying
[10:25] hands on each one and all 72 students
[10:29] and the dean received the baptism of the
[10:31] Holy Ghost and they're shaking that
[10:32] country up there with the miracles and
[10:35] working of God. They're having healing
[10:36] services and everything. The Lutheran
[10:39] Seminary.
[10:41] Friends, if the devil battles you on
[10:42] whether you've crossed the line between
[10:44] mercy and judgment, or if you've
[10:46] blasphemed the Holy Ghost, tell Satan
[10:48] he's a liar. The biblical proof that you
[10:52] are still able to be saved, sanctified,
[10:54] and filled with the Holy Ghost is that
[10:56] you're still longing for God. You still
[10:59] desire to be right with God. If you had
[11:01] crossed the line, if you had blasphemed
[11:04] and there was no coming back, you
[11:05] wouldn't even desire to go to church, to
[11:08] watch this video, to read your Bible, to
[11:11] pray. And that's proven by at least two
[11:13] examples. Judas's scariot blasphemed the
[11:16] Lord Jesus, left him, and never came
[11:18] back to repent. He had no desire to come
[11:20] back to Jesus and repent.
[11:23] The other example is Cain. Cain left the
[11:25] prince of God and he never comes back to
[11:27] the prince of God. So friend, if you're
[11:29] coming back to the presence of God, if
[11:32] you want to worship God, if you want
[11:33] your heart right before God, if you want
[11:35] to be forgiven, that proves there's
[11:37] still hope for you. You can still be
[11:39] saved, sanctified, and spiritfilled.
[11:43] Brother Random dealt with people many
[11:44] times who thought they'd crossed the
[11:47] line. Brother Ram says, "You haven't
[11:49] crossed the line. You wouldn't be here
[11:51] tonight in the service if you'd crossed
[11:53] the line."
[11:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Brandom, I've been so
[11:57] sinful. I believe I've crossed the
[11:58] separating line. No, you haven't. Or you
[12:00] wouldn't be here tonight.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says, if you feel like
[12:04] you're beyond hope and you've broken
[12:06] every commandment, if you've done
[12:07] everything there is in the Bible that
[12:09] you ought not to do besides blas the
[12:12] Holy Ghost, and of course that means for
[12:14] the final time, not in ignorance. God
[12:17] has a sacrifice provided for you. He's
[12:20] Jehovah Gy. He alters all circumstances.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; How can he make atonement for me? I
[12:25] broke my marriage vows. I've done this,
[12:27] that, and the other. He's Jehovah Gara,
[12:30] the Lord's provided sacrifice.
[12:33] If you're beyond hope, if you broke
[12:35] every commandment, if you've done
[12:37] everything there is in the Bible that
[12:39] you ought not to do besides blasphe the
[12:41] Holy Ghost, God has a sacrifice provided
[12:43] for you. He's Jehovah Jarai.
[12:48] He alters all circumstances.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Hegy had called
[12:53] brother Brandham a susair, a worker with
[12:55] the devil. And yet he had not blasphemed
[12:57] the Holy Ghost for the final time. Thank
[13:00] God for such amazing grace. God is rich
[13:03] in mercy.
[13:07] I'll leave you with one more quote from
[13:08] it is I be not afraid March 29th, 1960.
[13:13] Brother Ram said, "You might think
[13:14] you've crossed the separating line and
[13:16] you can't be saved. That's wrong. As
[13:19] long as you got enough God about you to
[13:21] come here to this church tonight,
[13:22] there's hope for you to be saved. As
[13:24] long as the spirit of God's dealing with
[13:26] you.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; There he was. All hopes is gone. Maybe
[13:30] you are tonight. Maybe the doctor says
[13:32] you can't live no longer. Maybe you
[13:35] think you cross a separating line. You
[13:37] can't be saved. That's wrong. As long as
[13:41] you got enough God about you to come
[13:43] here to this church tonight, these hopes
[13:44] for you to be saved. Long as the spirit
[13:47] of God's dealing with you. I love how
[13:49] God ministered to those who thought
[13:52] they'd crossed the line through Brother
[13:54] Ram's ministry. Brother Ram gave them
[13:56] simple answers on whether they'd
[13:59] blasphemed and gone too far or not. He
[14:02] said, "You wouldn't be in church if
[14:03] you'd blasphe the Holy Ghost. You
[14:06] wouldn't care about your spiritual
[14:07] condition if you'd gone too far." Praise
[14:10] God for his mercy and his love. Praise
[14:12] God that he can still forgive ignorant
[14:15] blasphemy.
[14:17] Praise God that he is full of compassion
[14:20] and forgives iniquity according to Psalm
[14:22] 78:38.
[14:26] Praise God that God is full of
[14:28] compassion and gracious and
[14:30] long-suffering and plenteous in mercy
[14:33] and truth according to Psalm 86:15.
[14:36] [Music]
[14:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Brandham, I've been so
[14:40] sinful. I believe I've crossed the
[14:41] separating line." No, you haven't, or
[14:43] you wouldn't be here tonight. As long as
[14:46] you got enough God about you to come
[14:48] here to this church tonight, these hopes
[14:49] for you to be saved. Long as the spirit
[14:52] of God's dealing with you.
[14:55] [Music]
