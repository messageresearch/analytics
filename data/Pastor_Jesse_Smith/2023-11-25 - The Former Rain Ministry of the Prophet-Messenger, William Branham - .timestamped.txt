[2:10] on well we find out that there's been a

[2:27] Reign G forth there's been a national
[2:30] teaching ring communism sold amongst the
[2:33] people every
[2:36] nation they've been talking so much
[2:38] about line not discarding you line
[2:40] Brethren but that's not
[2:43] line the line would have been your the
[2:46] power of God would have struck that
[2:47] thing and should trip the world the
[2:50] latter rain fixing to come what's the
[2:53] matter the church is manufacturing
[2:55] herself something just like Eve tried to
[2:57] do she tried to have more life to
[3:00] manufacture something we've had a
[3:03] Revival Joel said we fuss so much about
[3:05] line had movements called lat rain
[3:09] latter rain farmer rain in Rain outter
[3:11] rain I was reading the other day do you
[3:13] know what farmer rain means in the
[3:15] Hebrew word I can't call it right now I
[3:17] never wrote it down it skipped my mind
[3:19] but farmer
[3:20] rain the first rain means a rign of
[3:25] teaching the second Reign is the spirit
[3:28] that comes up on what's been taught and
[3:30] produces a
[3:31] crop why is it we had such a Revival
[3:34] Pentecostal Baptist all the other trees
[3:37] put forth their buds as Jesus said they
[3:39] would be and what are we hatched out the
[3:41] Baptist said they got a million more in
[3:44] 44 look at the Catholic how they
[3:46] increase look at all denomination look
[3:48] at Pentecost what do we do we seow
[3:50] denominational seeds we reap the
[3:52] denominational Harvest while the church
[3:55] ought to be on fire for God right now
[3:57] there have been a word seed solded back
[3:59] there and there be signs wonders
[4:01] miracles in that church to be together
[4:03] one heart one Accord and marching toward
[4:05] Zion for the Rapture
[4:08] Hallelujah right what did we do we had
[4:11] intellectual speeches instead of the
[4:13] word it is at such a time as this that
[4:17] the messenger of Malachi must come then
[4:19] in the latter reign will come a Mount
[4:21] Carmel
[4:22] Showdown watch this carefully now to see
[4:25] it in the word John was the Forerunner
[4:28] of Malachi 3 he planted the former rain
[4:30] and was rejected by the organizations of
[4:33] his day Jesus came and had a mount
[4:35] Transfiguration
[4:37] Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ
[4:39] will sow for the latter Reign Jesus will
[4:42] be the showdown between the
[4:43] denominations and Creeds for he will
[4:45] come to back up his word and take his
[4:47] bride in the Rapture the first Showdown
[4:50] was Mount Carmel the second was the
[4:52] mount
[4:53] Transfiguration and the third will be
[4:55] Mount
[4:56] Zion this age started just after the
[4:59] turn of the 20th century as it was to be
[5:02] the age in which the true church would
[5:03] return to being the bride she was at
[5:06] Pentecost we know that there must of
[5:08] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[5:11] the Believers sensed this in their
[5:12] spirits and began crying to God for a
[5:14] new outpouring such as was in the first
[5:17] century what seemed to be the answer
[5:19] came as many began to speak in tongues
[5:22] and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was
[5:24] then believed that this was indeed the
[5:26] long- awaited
[5:28] restoration it was not for the latter
[5:30] rain can come only after the former rain
[5:32] which is the spring or teaching rain the
[5:35] latter rain then is the Harvest Reign
[5:38] how could this be the real thing when
[5:40] the teaching Reign had not come the
[5:42] prophet messenger who was to be sent to
[5:44] teach the people and turned the hearts
[5:46] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[5:48] fathers had not yet come thus what was
[5:52] thought to be the restoration and the
[5:53] final quickening unto the Rapture had
[5:55] not come in it was a mixture of the
[5:58] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[6:00] blessing and manifesting in the Holy
[6:02] Ghost as we have kept pointing out to
[6:03] you in it also was devil power as men
[6:07] were under the control of devils yet no
[6:09] one seemed to realize it then to prove
[6:12] that it was not the real these people
[6:14] even before a second generation had
[6:16] appeared organized and wrote their
[6:18] unscriptural doctrines and built their
[6:20] own fences as every other group ahead of
[6:22] them
[6:24] did
