========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] s in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to give a simple basic teaching on courtship and engagement I felt impressed by the Holy Spirit to recently teach this at my local church and now I'd like to share it with the Saints by the grace of God the outline of this video is simple we'll start with five fundamental principles about courtship and engagement and then look at the three stages in a relationship and before we get started I do want to say I'm thankful for all the youth conferences and youth meetings that the ministers have held over the years where they focused on courtship and engagement I've never attended one but I'm thankful for all the efforts to help the youth in this message and the efforts to help any Christian Youth prepare for marriage because again marriage is the second greatest decision outside of salvation by God's grace I've only married three couples and I'll likely marry a fourth couple in the near future so I don't have a lot of experience with these subjects but I believe the Holy Ghost has equipped me through the seasons of life where I've needed the Bible truths on these subjects and of course I have eight children so my oldest is 18. it seems at some point in the future I'll likely be dealing with courtship and engagement topics more frequently and Friends lastly I know there's variables in each courtship situation I know it's likely that each experience is different for every couple that's courting or engaged for example it could be that a single sister's dad has passed away and so she doesn't have the headship of her father or a single sister's parents are not Believers and yet she's a Holy Ghost Field Christian she's a message believer and so that situation would be different than other situations of course if you have any questions contact your local Pastor if you don't have a local Pastor you can text me your questions as well by God's grace so let's begin with five fundamental principles for courtship and engagement the first principle is honor the god-ordained headship in First Corinthians 11 verses 1 through 3 Paul gives the headship for the entire universe so it begins with the invisible Spirit god holds the highest preeminence he's on top of all headship under God the invisible spirit is Christ the human body of Jesus Christ which is of course filled with the fullness of the godhead bodily that body being in subjection to the invisible spirit inside of it under Christ you have man and under Christ you have woman and then of course First Corinthians 11 verses 4 through 16 show how that headship is connected through physical hair all Christian women and really all women in general should grow long uncut hair that is a sign they're under the headship of their husband or if they're not married yet their father and that means they're to follow the Holy Ghost leadership of their husband or their father the next verse is First Corinthians 7 verses 36-38 here Paul talks about fathers would be able to give their daughters in marriage now of course remember the Bible is an Eastern book and we're westerners here in the United States so in the Eastern customs and Eastern family traditions the father has much more control over the marriage of his children than Western families and Western traditions so in this text First Corinthians 7 36-38 Paul says some fathers can choose to give their daughters a marriage or not give their daughters in marriage so in Paul's time in the Eastern tradition fathers had a lot of control over their daughters and could refuse giving them in marriage now in the western culture that usually isn't the case once a girl reaches 18 years old she can choose whether to be married or not she doesn't have to have the approval of her father but again we're speaking best case scenario a Holy ghost-filled Father and a holy ghost-filled daughter would be in one Accord by the leadership of the Holy Ghost on whether that daughter should be married to a certain man or not and also with this thought we see how there's Christian Liberties allowed within Eastern culture and Western culture Eastern culture is my exercise more influence and control over marriage choices whereas Western cultures might have less control and less influence over marriage choices but each one needs to find the middle of the road the balance of the Holy Ghost In other words each father and daughter must pray fast and seek God for the perfect will of God for the daughter's marriage in Numbers Chapter 30 the entire chapter verses 1 through 16 we see the Old Testament shadow of this truth this chapter speaks of the finality of a vow in this chapter you'll see if you read it by God's grace that in Moses day and going forward in the Old Testament any vow a woman made had to be approved by her father if she wasn't married and also any married woman any vow she made had to be approved by her husband so in this context we see again that God ordained headship that God set in place every vow a woman made had to be approved by her headship either a husband or her father if she wasn't married yet so with this first foundational principle we understand that single sisters are under the headship of a Holy ghost-filled Father and they should honor the leadership of that Holy ghost-filled Father now again I know there are situations where maybe a father isn't filled with the Holy Ghost and so that's a subject for a different video but I hope you understand by God's grace the point of these verses from First Corinthians 11 First Corinthians 7 and numbers 30 verses 1 through 16. the second foundational principle is the finality of the vow or the promise to be married this is found in Matthew 1 verse 20 and of course this goes along with Numbers Chapter 30 1-16 so in Matthew 1 verse 20 the angel Lord appeared unto Joseph and said fear not to take Mary thy wife when we understand the context of this verse Joseph and Mary were only engaged and yet the angel of the Lord already recognized that they were married the promise to be married is final and it cannot be broken so before that decision is made before the vow to marry someone is made it should be done with much prayer fasting seeking the Lord and godly counsel between a father her mother and the daughter the third foundational principle is complete physical Purity in the courting and engagement process this is found in First Corinthians 7 1-9 the main verse I want to emphasize is verse 1 it is good for a man not to touch a woman so when a young man is interested in marrying a woman he should not touch her outside of just shaking hands and the reason is because it will lead to Temptation and of course for the world it always leads to fornication that's what First Corinthians 7 verse 2 says a man shouldn't touch her to avoid fornication verse 9 says because young people have a burning desire for intimate relations and so it's good for a man not to touch a woman so friends I believe when a young single man and single woman are courting they should only shake hands they should never hold hands but I believe once a couple is engaged I believe holding hands is okay and perhaps a side hug but I do not encourage frontal hugs because the woman's reproductive parts and the man's reproductive parts are touching and a couple should save their first kiss to the wedding day I believe those guidelines would honor Paul's words in First Corinthians 7 verse 1 for a complete physical purity guideline number four is guard your emotions this is found in proverbs 4 verse 23 which says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life this verse means guard your emotions a couple that's courting should not get carried away in their emotions their lustful desires or their lustful imaginations because it could lead to fornication if they don't guard their emotions or realize the person they're recording could be someone else's husband or someone else's wife they could get too fixated on the person and rush into the marriage before praying and fasting enough to see if it's the perfect will of God it's better for couples to go through numerous courtships staying physically pure and not giving away their emotions than to just jump into the first courtship and give all their emotions away to someone and get married too quickly without seeking the will of God first and Fifth and finally the fifth foundational guideline is never court or married an unbeliever this is found in second Corinthians 6 verses 14 through 18 and then also any widow or widower is told to remarry only a Christian in First Corinthians 7 verse 39. God's Prophet told us to never marry an unbeliever and no believer should every marry an unbeliever under no circumstance always marry believers court and eventually get engaged to only a Christian and the best case scenario is a holy ghost-filled Christian again I know God has different testimonies for different people but for the sake of this video I'm speaking of the best case scenario one holy ghost-filled person should only choose to marry a holy ghost-filled person three stages in a relationship years ago I heard a preacher say there were three stages in any potential marriage relationship and I thought that was a good teaching the first stage is friendship in this stage the single man and woman are just friends maybe they see each other at church or they talk at youth Banquets but this relationship is friendship only I personally believe there should be no texting going on between the single man the single woman and of course just handshakes and pleasant conversations the second stage is courtship and counseling stage in this stage if a young man is interested in courting a woman that young man should have a full-time job he should have income he should be ready to be married and to have a family and this young man who's interested in a young woman should then approach that young lady's father first according to the scripture and see if the father believes his daughter is mature enough to begin a courtship for potential marriage because with real Holy Ghost Field Christians there should be no dating only courtship if the single young lady's father agrees to a courtship and that young man should start spending time with the entire family of the single lady he's interested in that way he can see the family Dynamic he can see how the lady's interested in is treating her parents her siblings he can see her true character and of course spend time with her at church see how she worships see how she loves the Lord and of course all physical Purity is kept during this stage if the young man feels LED of the Holy Ghost to continue pursuing this single young lady for marriage then they should do counseling with one of their pastors now in my church I do seven counseling sessions the seventh is just questions and answers but I'll list the six counseling sessions that I do with courting couples the first is courtship boundaries the second is marriage expectations and Ministry the third is money and finances the fourth is Family Planning and the physical relationship the fifth is communication and conflict management the six is Bible beliefs and the seventh is questions and answers and then throughout the counseling process as a pastor I've asked the couple to consider whether they want to continue the courtship or not and then the young man has to make the decision am I going to continue courting this young lady or do I stop the courtship and if all the physical boundaries and spiritual boundaries were kept and the couple decides to depart and there's no harm done and both families can remain Christian Friends by the grace of God but if the young man feels led to marry her then he must ask for permission to propose to her from her father and mother by God's grace the third stage is engagement of course this is when the man proposes his love for the single sister and if she accepts and Promises to marry the young man and both parents agree and the couple is married at that time spiritually by The Vow they made just like Matthew 1 verse 20 says now at that point then I do believe the married couple can hold hands and give side hugs but of course not too much because the more physical touch they allow the more Temptation they would allow as well so they got to use wisdom they got to use Temperance self-control and they have to keep the guidelines for physical Purity all the way to their wedding day by God's grace now of course in the Bible days after the engagement was made according to Jewish history the Jewish man who's going to get married would take one year and he would build his own house or prepare his own house for his future wife that he's espoused to or engaged to and also friends before I forget I do have numerous videos about marriage and divorce if you have any questions about that you can reach out to me for those links or you can find them on my YouTube channel those would be a great help to you by God's grace we see this idea of the man preparing a future home for his wife in Matthew chapter 25 in the parable of the wise of foolish virgins in the context the bridegroom has prepared his home and then he's coming at an unknown hour to fetch his bride and take her to the marriage supper as Matthew 25 verse 10 says and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut so the engagement phase lasts as long as it takes for the single man who's engaged now to prepare a home and prepare all the details of the wedding with his future wife it lasts all the way up till they get married and then by God's grace they have their wedding day and perhaps a honeymoon by the grace of the Lord in closing friends I hope this video was a help and a blessing I thought about this subject over the years and wanted to make a video on it before but I felt now would be a good time to make the video since I just taught on it in our local church last Sunday night by God's grace we got some good feedback and it seemed to have helped the single Saints in our congregation and also the teenagers and young adults so I know it's a very basic and general Bible study but if you're in this situation where you're courting or thinking about courting then I would highly advise you to read through all those scriptures presented on this video and to reach out to leadership your headship whether it's father and mother or just father or just mother and of course These Are Holy ghost-filled Saints a holy ghost-filled Pastor by the grace of God friends I know there's a lot more detail a lot more scriptures and of course quotes from God's Prophet brother Branham that could be added to this video but I just want to get out a courtship and engagement Bible study to help those who may need it and of course we can do a part two or three later on by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
