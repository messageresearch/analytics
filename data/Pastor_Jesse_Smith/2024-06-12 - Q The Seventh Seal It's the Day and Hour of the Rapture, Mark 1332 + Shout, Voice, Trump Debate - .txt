TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the Seven's always a mystery watch that seven that's the finish that was the coming of the Lord heaven was quite silent nobody moved because Jesus said himself not even an angel of heaven knows when I will return I don't even know it myself what time the father has put that in his mind God Alone knows it greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about the seventh seal I was read recently asked what I believed about the seventh seal so in this video I'd like to make the answer to that by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here for the past 18 years and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then restored according to the scriptures through his Prophet The Late William Mariam brandham 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so here's the outline for this video first look at the Bible teaching on the seventh seal second we'll look at the three forms of each seal third we'll look at 11 quotes on the day and hour of Jesus's return relating to the seventh seal fourth will debunk the he's here misunderstanding and fifth we'll look at the Rapture processed debate of course it's a debate done with brotherly kindness and respect so let's begin with the Bible teaching on the seventh seal seventh seal is mentioned in Revelation 8: 1 and 2 the Bible says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets so the first thing we notice is that there's silence in heaven about the space of half hour when the seventh seal is open I believe according to the Bible the only reason there would be silence in heaven is because Jesus left heaven in order to go down to Rapture the Bride of Jesus Christ to meet the Saints in the air to fulfill 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 this is also according to Revelation 4:8 Revelation 4:8 says the beasts rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come so these beasts are doing ceaseless praise unending praise to Jesus Christ but then when the Seven Seals open Heaven is silent so why would these beasts be silent it would have to be because Jesus left heaven in order to Rapture the Bride of Jesus Christ and of course brother Ram taught this in at least one place he said it in the sardian church age December 9th 1960 he says the heavens was empty for the space of half an hour where is this big fellow God then uh-huh see he's in Christ sure let's listen to the quote and Jesus comes from heaven with 10,000s times 10 thousands of his Saints and the Bible says that the heavens was empty for the space of a half hour where is this big fellow God then see he's in Christ now getting back to 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord so this is what I believe the seventh seal is the seventh seal begins with Jesus Christ descending from heaven and meeting the Saints in the air brother brand also said the seventh seal is seen in many types in the Bible of course the first type would be Enoch he was the seventh from Adam and he was not for God took him in other words Enoch was the first person raptured that's according to Genesis 524 and Jude 1:14 so we see the seventh seal foreshadow in the Old Testament through Enoch's Rapture the seventh from Adam we also see it in Joshua 6 the entire chapter Jericho fell on the seventh lap around when Israel was marching around Jericho and of course when it fell they had to shout and there was seven trumpets blowing so we see a shout and a trumpet which is a fulfillment of the shout voice and Trump from 1 Thessalonians 4:17 so I've always been on the lookout for The Voice in Joshua chapter 6 but we definitely have a shout and Trump when Jericho fell so in other words we see a type of the Rapture in Joshua chapter 6 Rahab and her house were spared because of the token or the baptism of the Holy Ghost all else died and that's a type of the seven-year Great Tribulation period where first all those that don't take the mark are killed that would include foolish virgins and then when Jesus comes back riding the White Horse at the battle of Armageddon nearly everyone is killed and of course the reason I believe that is because the Bible says that some people will make it through the battle of Armageddon and live into the Millennium and that's found in Zechariah 14:16 and it should come to pass that everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles so we see the first Bible meaning of the seven seal is it's the Rapture it's the day and hour when Jesus returns to Rapture the Bride of Jesus Christ before the Great Tribulation period the second meaning is that the seventh seal is a time period it's the beginning of the end of time the seventh seal and the Rapture it sets in motion the end as brother Ram said the seven seal is the end of the church ages it's the end of the vials it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of time it's the end of the struggling world so the seventh seal is also a time period beginning with the Rapture all the way until the future home because when the future home starts the new Jerusalem time shall be no more and friends this is true because the seventh seal is the last seal on the book of redemption so during the time period of the seventh seal we have the Redemption of the Bride she's raptured we have the Redemption of Israel the 144,000 are sealed with the Holy Ghost during the tribulation period we have the redeemed Saints reigning during the 1,000-year millennial Reign we have Satan's destruction at the Battle of gagam Magog and then we have the white Throne judgment where the Saints sit with Jesus in The Throne of judgment and judgment is given to the Saints don't you know that the Saints shall judge the Earth don't you know that the Saints shall judge angels and then of course the end of all time is the New Jerusalem the future home let's play the quote from the seventh seal where brother brandom says the seventh seal is the end of all time we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things fine the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundational World it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world it's end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth it's it's even the end of time time runs out the Bible said so everything runs out and this time the end of the the at the end of this seventh seal notice it's the end of the church age it's the the end of the seven seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials and even in the ushering in of the Millennium that's on the seventh seal now let's move on to the second section three forms to each seal friends remember during the first seal sermon brother brandom says there's three forms to every seal he said the first seal opened in symbol form what about when it's open in reality form he said first it's with God next it's in a symbol then it's revealed three things let's listen to the quote and notice the first seal opened the first seal when it was open in the symbol form it thundered and what about when it's open in its reality form it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal and what did it reveal not all of itself first it's with God next it's an assemble then it's revealed seal three things now here's a chart I made a simple chart every seal has a symbol form a reality form and a revelation form so I'm not going to go through all these seals but you can pause the video if you want to look at each one but we see that each of the seals had a symbol reality and Revelation form now the seventh seal the symbol form was given around 8090 and there's no symbol the only clue we're given is silence in heaven which I already addressed the only reason there would be SS in heaven as if Jesus left and then the four beasts did not have to worship him anymore the reality form of the seventh seal is the day an hour of the Rapture it's an unknown day or hour this is according to Mark 13:32 and brother Brandon will use this scripture later on as we'll go through that in the seventh seal sermon Jesus said but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father so even Jesus's human glorified body does not know know the day and hour of the Rapture only the father knows it and then the Revelation form of the seventh seal was preached on March 24th 1963 by God's Prophet brother brandham and the revelation of the seven seal was Mark 13:32 brother Bram tells us is the day and hour of the Rapture but the reality form has not happened yet the Rapture has not happened so friends this is the reason there's so much confusion on the seventh seal people don't really understand how each seal has has three forms If people could understand that quote then it would make a lot more sense for them there wouldn't be so much confusion so here's a separate slide on the seventh seal there's no symbol we're just told there's silence in heaven we know what that means Jesus left Heaven the reality form of the seventh seal hasn't opened yet brother Bram tells us it's the day and hour the unknown day and hour the Rapture and the Revelation brother Ram told us quote revealed to us it was revealed to us the Revelation is Jesus's Rapture coming for the Gentile bride and of course that was preached on March 24th 1963 moving on to section number three let's look at 11 quotes on the day and hour Matthew 13:24 and how it relates to the seventh seal now I'm going to go through these quotes in chronological order except for the seventh seal quotes from March of 63 I'll read those last broken sisters 1964 brother random said and that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the Lord and brother R cites 1 Thessalonians 4:16 And1 17 the Rapture Scriptures it shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first just resting till that time let's listen to the quote remember that they which are alive and remain shall not hinder those which are sleeping for the Trump of God that last trumpet the sixth one has just sounded and that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the Lord it shall sound in the dead and Christ shall rise first just resting till that time the second quote is the Feast of trumpets 64 brother ramam said because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew that was the minute or hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us so a year and 4 months after brother R preached the seventh seal brother Ram told us the seventh seal mark 13:32 and it was revealed to us let's near the quote because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew that's a minute or hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us the third quote is again from the Feast of trumpets brother ramam said the seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know that's his coming let's listen to the quote the seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know that's his coming the fourth quote is again from the Feast of trumpets brother Bram said as the church the bride is draw together she's Tak up speaking of the Rapture that mystery of the seventh seal the mystery of going let's listen to the quote at the same time now as soon as this church the bride is draw together she's taken up in that mystery of the seven seal or the seven seal the mystery going and the Jews is called by The Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets Elijah and Moses the fifth quote is from Souls that are in prison now brother Ram said the seven is always the mystery watch that seventh that's the finish that was the coming of the Lord Brother brand cites Mark 13:32 God Alone knows it the spirit then brother brandom cites a seal was open then there was silence in heaven so he cites Revelation 81 see it wasn't give away what would take place let's listen to the quote the Seven's always a mystery what that seven that's the finish that was the coming of the Lord heaven was quite silent nobody moved because Jesus said himself not even an angel of heaven knows when I will return I don't even know it myself what time the father has put that in his mind God Alone knows it the spirit that I didn't know it and it wasn't reveal when that seventh trumpet sounded or the seventh angel um seal was open then there was silence in the heaven see it wasn't give away what would take place sixth from Souls that are in prison now brother Rand said he hid the seventh seal from us and said there is silence in heaven no one knew it it was the coming of the Lord so again Mark 13:32 let's listen to the quote remember he hid the seven seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood day by day telling it but then he wouldn't do it on that so there's silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the [Music] Lord the eighth quote is from Christ is the mystery of God revealed red brother BR said nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself so again brother R cites Mark 13:32 let's listen to the quote God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about even the angels didn't understand it he he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh um uh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they want to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself the ninth quote is again from Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Ram said see the coming of the Lord that's one thing hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't let's listen to the quote God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he he didn't reveal it that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space for half hour and seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the 10th quote is again from Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Ram said now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming he never gave his mystery in full so we see brother Ram plainly says there are some things about the seventh seal that are revealed but he never gave the mystery in full in other words all three forms of the seventh seal were not revealed to us but the Revelation was the revelation of the seventh seal is the unknown day and hour of Jesus Rapture according to Mark 13:32 let's listen to the quote now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming amen see and so was all the mysteries of God waiting for this last day after is already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done oh my never gave his mystery and full now the 11th and final quotes from the seventh seal brother Ram tells us none of us know the seventh seal but I'm going to tell you my revelation of it and then he proceeds to tell them about the seven Thunders he said Jesus never spoke of it John Couldn't Write it Angels know nothing about it what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it he didn't know it himself said only God would know it but he told us when we begin to see these things coming up so brother brandom again cites Mark 13:32 as the revelation of the seventh seal let's listen to the quote what what is it now none of us know but I'm I'm going to tell you my my revelation of it seven Thunders utter straight together like a spelling out something notice at that time John's started writing he said don't write it Jesus never spoke of it John Couldn't Write Angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen said only God would know it amen but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up now you getting somewhere all right notice so friends I believe it's beyond a shadow of a doubt the seventh seal is a time period And it begins with the Rapture of the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ the unknown day and hour of the Rapture before the tribulation period we have the Bible verses on it we have the types and shadows of it and we have at least 11 quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham on this topic fourth let's debunk the he's here misunderstanding so recently I've become aware of some preachers and churches that say when the seventh seal was preached back in 1963 March of 1963 these churches now believe that Jesus is here or the Rapture has already started and so some preachers and their congregants will say things like I heard a preacher say he said Jesus is not in heaven he's on Earth he's on the throne of your heart and friends this is ridiculous to say that Jesus is not in heaven goes against the Scripture it goes against brother Ram's quote and that's what I want to share in this section so friends it's likely the preachers and their congregations misunderstand brother Ram's quotes Heaven is not bankrupt of Jesus the body of Jesus still sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high as the Bible tells us and also another attribute about these preachers and their churches is they're the ones that are saying just believe every word on the tape there's no mistakes in the message this proves they're weak immature Christians they're babies in the word of God they're not mature in the word of God brother Bram never said there's no mistakes on any of his tapes brother brandom never said just believe every word I say is thus sayith the Lord so these are the churches that have preachers but they have this misunderstanding about the tapes they're actually starting to worship the tapes of brother brandham not as boldly as brandham Tabernacle and all the tape church people but they're leaning more towards idolatry of brother brandham so when we look at Revelation 10 Jesus is coming down to earth as brother Ram said this is history the coming of the mighty Angel did not bankrupt Heaven brother ramam said the Holy Spirit visited him every day while he preached the Seven Seals he said the pillar of fire would be there he said the angel of the Lord would meet him so yes it was a visitation of Christ to give brother brandham the revelation of the Seven Seals and then brother brandham preach it to the people but again Revelation 10 did not bankrupt heaven heaven still has the body of Jesus Christ and I'm going to prove this by the quot quotes of course soon in just a moment but remember Jesus said the Holy Spirit would be with us forever John 14:16 I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever so the same Holy Ghost has been here amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ and of course the foolish virgin for the last 2,000 years the Holy Ghost has been abiding with Believers forever of these last 2,000 years but then yes there was a special appearing of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ to brother brandham in order to break the Seven Seals but that did not bankrupt heaven so people should not say things like he's already here we're not looking for Jesus to come that's completely contrary to what brother bandom taught even after he preached the Seven Seals so let's look at these quotes here there's six quotes I'm going to share of course there's a lot more but we'll start in June of 63 brother brandom said now by faith lay your hands upon your sacrifice Jesus who is sitting at the right hand of God this is 3 months after the seals brother Ram said Jesus is now sitting at the right hand of God let's listen to the quote Now by faith lay your hands upon your sacrifice Jesus who is sitting at the right hand of God to make intercessions for you then in the next month July 1963 brother Ram said Jesus is a high priest right now sitting at the right hand of the Majesty of God so that's 4 months after he preached the Seven Seals brother BR said the body is in heaven right now it's at the right hand of the Majesty of god let's listen to the quote the Bible said he's a high priest right now a high priest sitting at the right hand of the Majesty of God to make intercessions Upon Our confession and then August of 1964 17 months after he preached the Seven Seals brother Ram said Christ is in heaven today brother Ram didn't say Christ is here he's not in heaven Heaven's bankrupt no brother Ram said Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem let's listen to the quote now listen close don't move don't don't miss this Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem then in July of 1965 28 months after preaching the Seven Seals in what is the attraction on the mountain brother Bram said we are waiting on the coming of the Lord as he's recording this tape and preaching to the people on the phone hookup seven times he says we're waiting for the coming of the Lord Brother Ram did not say he's here and we don't have to wait for his coming like some people say today some people just say he's here of course that's a false Doctrine let's listen to the quote we send greetings to those in Tucson that's gathered tonight waiting for the coming of the Lord down in Houston Texas to those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord up in Chicago to those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord up on the East Coast New York and Connecticut and the great groups up there that's w waiting for the coming of the lord we send greetings to brother Junior Jackson tonight and his group down in Clarksville brother rutle upon 62 and his group waiting for the coming of the Lord and we're gathered here tonight at the home Church the Tabernacle waiting for the coming of the Lord next in November 1965 about a month before brother R passed he said we're looking up for his coming he's coming one of these days he's coming again so notice again brother Ram did not say he's already here he said we're looking up for his coming this is in the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote we're looking upward watching the true bride Across the Nation this hour looking up Church he's coming one of these days just as sure as he come the first time he's coming again and then six and finally from the church age book which was released December 1965 brother Bram said Jesus now sits at the right hand of the great spirit of Jehovah so he said now this was released again in December 65 the same month brother R passed away now Jesus sits at the right hand of the spirit of Jehovah in heaven let's listen to the quote and notice when Jesus was taken off the cross he was exalted into heaven and now sits at the right hand of the great spirit of Jehovah Fifth and finally let's talk about the Rapture process debate of course this is a debate done in brotherly kindness so the debate on the Rapture process is basically has the shout already happened Paul told us there's three phases to the Rapture shout voice Trump now personally I've always believe the shout is brother br's message it's going out to the entire world and I've always believe the voice will be the voice of the Archangel likely Michael because Michael is associated with Resurrection such as Moses's Resurrection you can read about that in Jude 1:9 and then of course the trumpet will be the body change that will be the unknown day and hour of the Rapture so the debate is basically has the Rapture process already started or is the rapture a process and I personally believe yes now I could be wrong on this I'm open to further Revelation again this is a topic that does not pertain to salvation Salvation is through the blood of Jesus Christ only by Grace we are saved through faith Ephesians 2:8-10 but also Romans 3:25 says we must have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ so when our faith is in the blood of our sacrifice we are saved we're Justified we're declared righteous as we wish to be as the Greek Lexicon says recently I got an email about this question that's why I thought I'd include it on this video and so for years I've wondered you know is the shout the message of brother brandham to go around the world and has it started the Rapture process again I personally believe yes and then I believe I found some scripture to back this up it's from Exodus 3: verse 8 God said and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites so notice the wording here God said I am come down to deliver Israel now how did God do it he did it through Moses he did it through a prophet of God and so Israel's delivery out of bondage and to the promised land was a process it was over a 40-year process God came down in the ministry of Moses to give the people an exodus and place them into the land so could this mean that God came down in brother Ram's Ministry to give us an exodus out of denominations and prepare us for the Third Exodus the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ so I personally believe that yes the Rapture process has started the shout was brother bram's ministry as brother Bram said in the Rapture sermon 1965 let's listen to that quote the first thing comes when he starts descending from the heaven there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now L trimming time rise and trim your lamp what watch was that the seven amen not the six the seven behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any or in their lamps see what's lamp triming time it's Malachi 4 time why you it's Luke 17 it's it's all those prophecy that's it can perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right there brother random referenced Matthew 256 the Midnight Cry behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him so brother Braham connected these two verses a shout to start the Rapture process and then the cry made at midnight where both virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps but of course only one had the oil only one had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in the Hebrew the words come down means to descend and so the Bible says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout so we have the same words there descend come down in Exodus 3:8 and then descend in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and again friends you know if I have my own opinions I'm open to the Lord revealing more Revelation on them I could be wrong but I'm just again answering a question from a dear Saint who wanted my opinion about the seventh seal and of course that relates to the Rapture as well in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I love getting these questions and it's a nice review for me to go back and look at the scriptures and quotes on the seventh seal regarding the seventh seal we don't have any thus sayi the Lord quotes on it other than the revelation of it brother Ram said in the seventh seal he said the history plus the church ages plus the Seals All Blends together and I can truly say it's thus sayith the Lord so the revelation of the seven seal is thus sayth the Lord but again there's an element we don't know we don't know the day and hour no man knows the day or the hour not even the sun knows the day or the hour nor the angels in heaven now the Vision Plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus sayith the Lord so we're thankful for the Revelation that God has given to us and the main thing is we want our lamps trimmed and we want to make sure we have oil for the going out to meet the bridegroom the oil of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be ready for the Rapture so if I get lots of comments on this there may be a part two we'll see by God's grace let's continue to make ourselves ready for the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
