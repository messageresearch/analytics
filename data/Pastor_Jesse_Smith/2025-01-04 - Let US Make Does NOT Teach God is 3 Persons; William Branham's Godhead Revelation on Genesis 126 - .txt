TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] let us who father and son trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayeth the Lord amen look where it come from greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a question I received does Genesis 1: 26 prove God is three persons because it says let us make man in our image this is an excellent godhead question and of course the answer is no the use of the plural pronoun us does not prove God is three persons in Genesis 1:26 and this video will prove that by the Bible and by quotes from God's Prophet brother William Brenham hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William Marin brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character trinitarians often use Genesis 1:26 and Matthew 3 which is the story of Jesus's baptism to prove God is three persons but that's wrong and these trinitarians fail to admit that they add words to the Bible the words three persons are not even in the Holy Scripture so trinitarians whether aware of it or not are sinfully adding to the Bible and there's great warnings about adding to the Bible in Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 add thou not unto God's words lest thou be found a liar and Revelation 22:18 and 19 we should not take away from the word of God nor add to the word of God because there are grave consequences for doing so trinitarians fail to recognize God's multiple manifestations and God's multiple manifestations do not equal multiple personalities if multiple manifestations equal personalities then the Holy Ghost is at least 120 different persons because he appeared as a lick of fire above 120 different persons in the upper room and so this example relates to Jesus's baptism just because there was three manifestations a voice from Heaven Jesus the son in the water and the Holy Spirit descending like a dove those three manifestations do not prove God is three persons and friends as most of us know trinitarianism is simply polytheism and tritheism rebranded as I wrote in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries nearly 5,000 years ago samarians worshiped a Triad of deities Anu enlil and eia then in the New Kingdom Egyptian age from around 1500 to 1,000 BC worship was given to a Triad of gods Osirus Isis and Horus there's many more examples of a tribe ad of deities from the pagans but I'm not going to go through them here's the outline for the rest of the video friends we'll look at first reviewing the nine proofs the Trinity is false Doctrine or heresy including its origin beginning around 180 ad and moving up to 381 ad then we'll examine Genesis 1:26 after that we'll look at the mystery of plural pronouns and then look at a few quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham so let's begin with reviewing the nine proofs the Trinity is heresy or false Doctrine you'll find this on pages 23 through 32 in my 2021 book I'm going to go through these quickly first and the most decimating to its validity the Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible second Jesus and his Apostles taught and affirmed pure Hebrew monotheism rather than trinitarianism third the Athenian Creed or sixth century trinitarian confessional contains multiple contradictions to Biblical teaching on the godhead I list six examples in the book one of which is the shield of the Trinity which contains a blatant lie where it says the father is not the Holy Spirit the father is a spirit According To Jesus in John chapter 4 and the Holy Spirit is a spirit as its name declares so if the holy spirit is not the father then Jesus had two fathers and of course we know that's wrong four fourth major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies exist among trinitarians fifth the early trinitarians did not affirm that the Holy Spirit was divine into the Council of Constantinople in 381 ad so think of that friends the Holy Ghost was not considered Divine in trinitarians Minds until 381 ad nearly 300 years after the final Apostle died St John here's a quick visual regarding water baptism and the godhead the true Apostolic baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was administered by Peter around 30 or 33 ad Paul continued that of course up to 59 ad as recorded in scripture in Acts 19:5 and then the enemy began to change baptism from the apostolic baptism to Modern baptism or the Liturgy baptism which is a false baptismal formula of father son holy ghost that was around 100 AD and then around 180 ad Theophilus coined the Greek word Trias shortly after that tertullian coins the Latin word Trinitas so both words mean Trinity then according to the world book from 2003 the so-called three persons were declared as one God at the Council of NAA in 325 ad and again that's not according to me that's according to the World Book 2003 page 447 under the word Trinity so with that visual it's just so simple to see water baptism was changed about 40 years after St Paul used it at Ephesus and then the godhead began being changed about 80 years after St John died around 180 ad again proving the Bible authors did not teach three persons the Bible authors never had the idea of three persons in their minds six trinitarian images and artwork are often deceptive creating false representations of the godhead seventh some trinitarians use two fear tactics to persuade others to believe in the Trinity one is heresy the other is hell and eighth and finally God sent a prophet named William brandom to warn Christians about the false Trinity Doctrine so I think I misspoke earlier in the video I think I said there was nine proofs so I'm sorry about that there's eight proofs now let's examine Genesis 1:26 the section I wrote about this is on page 40 in my 2021 book the first thing I mention is that the word make it said let us make and notice there's one maker in the Bible there's not two makers there's not three makers Malachi 2:10 says we have one father one God created us not three persons there's not two creators or three creators there's only one according to Malachi 2:10 and then Isaiah 4424 States thus sayith the Lord thy Redeemer he that formed thee from the womb I am the Lord that maketh all things that stretches forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the Earth by myself so the Lord alone forms humans in the womb he alone stretch out the heavens he makes all things the Lord did this by himself not with two other persons the next point is that there's two possible explanations for the usage of us in Genesis 1:26 the first is God could be referring to himself and the Angelic host because God used Us in the same manner in two other passages Genesis 11:7 and Isaiah 6:8 in Genesis 11: 6-9 the Lord Jehovah says let us go down and there confound their language verses 8 and9 in Genesis 11 say God scattered the men at Babel but it's likely God came with his angels to scatter and confound the men at Babel just as God came with two angels to visit Abraham and lot in Genesis chapters 18 and 19 and remember it's impossible that a threers god visited Babel since the Bible never describes God as three people then in Isaiah 8: 1-8 it's Isaiah's heavenly vision notice Isaiah sees only one person sitting on Heaven's Throne the Lord or Yahweh and then God said whom shall I send and who will go for us so this use of us likely refers to the seraphim and those are the seraphim that Isaiah saw there around the Throne of God now the second possibility for let us in Genesis 1:26 is the combined work of of the Father and Son and yet this would not equate to two individual persons this is the view that I hold this is the one I think is the most likely the use of us would coincide with Jesus's usage of us in reference to he and his father in John 17:21 so in the beginning let us means the invisible father used his word which was later acknowledge as Christ in John 1: 1-3 to create man so God used his word to create man and all things and we understand this because you and I use our spoken words to create our daily activities I'm going to go do some errands I'm going to go grocery shopping I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to pray so in the same way the invisible God used his words to create man and all things in the universe this is supported by Ephesians 3:9 God created All Things by Jesus Christ God the one person created by his word he created by speaking the next point is that the Father and Son shared one image not two in Genesis 1:26 and this is because the father is invisible the Bible said Jesus is the image of the invisible God that's in Colossians 1:15 and the Bible said no man has seen the father nor ever can see the Father John 1:18 says no man hath seen God at any time then 1 Timothy 6:16 says whom no man hath seen nor can see so the son was the visible image of the invisible father so the Father and Son shared a Celestial visible body and that's just like when God made Adam God made Adam and Eve a spirit first and then they became flesh so the invisible Spirit became visible So based upon that sufficient Bible evidence now we understand Genesis 1:26 is not teaching three persons so now let's go to the mystery of plural pronouns as it relates to the godhead I start this section actually before Genesis 1 126 I start the section on page 37 of the 2021 book now this section is about three and a half pages in my book so I'm just going to hit the highlights here to keep this video a little shorter by the grace of God I can already tell it's getting longer than I anticipated Jesus's usage of first person plural pronouns like we and us when referring to the father is the only remaining godhead mystery John 14:23 Jesus says and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our with him so Jesus uses we a plural pronoun and our a possessive determiner to speak of his and his father's coming to dwell in the man who keeps his words then in John 17:21 Jesus uses us to refer to himself and the father saying that they also may be one in us so why would Jesus use plural pronouns and possessive determiners the best biblical answer is that Jesus was both fully human and fully Divine and because his human side was not Divine therefore he had to use a separate pronoun for his human body his mortal body unlike the immortal father I'm sure we all know the contrast between Jesus's body and the holy spirit inside of him Jesus's human body could die God could never die Jesus human body could be tempted God can never be tempted therefore a separate pronoun was needed for Jesus's human body Jesus's human body was a unique one-of-a-kind human manifestation unlike God's previous manifestations like MDC mzc wasn't born of a woman mzc didn't die a pillar of fire a burning bush a rock in the wilderness a voice in the Whirlwind remember mzc had no mother or father according to Hebrews 7 1-3 but Jesus had a human mother and human father Jesus was born of a woman of course Mary and Joseph were not his literal parents so using plural pronouns shows the difference between Jesus's flesh body and his Immortal invisible Spirit or father God or holy ghost that dwelt inside of him so the use of plural pronouns and possessive determiners does not prove God is multiple persons it proves God can manifest himself in multiple ways it also proves the invisible God can dwell in a visible manifestation and so when God is talking about his invisible spiritual nature and then his body Emmanuel the body of Jesus Christ he uses more than one pronoun because they have different attributes his invisible Spirit has different attributes than the body of Jesus the use of plural pronouns then shows that the invisible God is using his visible manifestations remember friends even a manifestation a light of God a pillar of fire is still a noun it's a person place or thing so we would say like the pillar of fire is a manifestation but that Pillar of Fire necessarily isn't the invisible spirit of God cu the Bible said again in 1 Timothy 6 that God dwells in the light the light is just a manifestation or appearance so the invisible God can dwell in it so God uses plural pronouns to show both the invisible and the visible manifestation are present so the pillar of fire the pillar of light is a thing and therefore it's a noun when you have the invisible spirit of God he's a person a noun needs to describe God and then you have a manifestation that's also a noun you have to use a plural pronoun to describe both like us and we and hour and I understand this could be considered deep to some people but this conclusion about plural pronouns is both scriptural and so much safer reverent and ultimately pleasing to God compared to the sin of adding uninspired words like three persons to God's Eternal inspired inherent word God's not trying to confuse Us by using plural nouns rather he's trying to help us see the necessity of his manifestation In the Flesh the body of Jesus Christ it was only through his son's body God could be seen held and handled because of what John says in 1 John 1: 1 and 2 it says which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of Life Next let's look at a few quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham the first is from questions and answers on Genesis 1953 here brother Ram says that the let us of Genesis 1:26 is Father and Son so this is the understanding that I hold to let us means the Father and Son it doesn't mean father and Angels but it could mean father and Angels let's listen to the quote you got all those things together made plant made all the other things all the animal life the birds the bees the monkeys and whatever it was put them all here on Earth and then he asked this question now let us who father and son next friends there's at least five quotes where brother Ram says Genesis 1:26 let us is the invisible God working through the logos he says in 1951 he says it three times in 1953 and one time in 1957 we'll just listen to the one from 1957 brother Ram said now the logos went out from God so there you have the invisible God something came out of him that was the logos the visible image of God and he said that's the kind of body that God was the logos for he said let us make man in our image and our likeness and that's how God made Adam God made Adam an invisible Spirit first and then God made a body to put Adam into so invisible becoming visible God did the same for himself and then he did that for Adam as well let's listen to the quote and now the lust that went out of God which was the the logus all this began to form into a a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholars teaching logus the logos that went out of God in other words a a better word for it was a what we call a theoy theoy is a human body that's glorified not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified stage but it is the form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now in there we enter into that body and that's the kind of body that God was for he said let us make man in our own image and in our likeness now when man become into that body he had control of all the fishes and fowls and in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I love going over topics like this again to prove that brother brandham had thus sayith the Lord regarding the godhead recall brother Bram said thus sayith the Lord trinitarianism is of the devil he said because all these words that trinitarians use are not found in the Bible now my precious brother I know this is a tape also now don't get excited let me say this with Godly love the hours approach where I can't hold still on these things no more too close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayith the Lord amen look where it come from it come from the N seeing Council when the Catholic Church become in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three Gods that's from heav there's one God it's exactly right now do you say then you believe it all these people that as trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong and remember friends we must use Bible words I have another section in my book and the section is about how God uses three manifestations in the godhead not three persons if only trinitarians would be humble and admit to themselves that the Bible doesn't use the word Trinity or three persons if they could only humble themselves and use the words the Bible uses like manifestation God was manifest In the Flesh so the son is a manifestation of the invisible God according to 1 Timothy 3:16 and then the Holy Ghost is a manifestation according to First Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so we can see it's undeniable the Bible uses the word manifest in related to the godhead and not three persons this wonderful Revelation that God gave to brother brandham is the same Revelation St Paul had all the Bible authors had the same Revelation that God is one person so we're thankful they could be restored in the end time just as Revelation 10:7 says the mystery of God should be finished the godhead has called a mystery in Colossians 2:2 so God used brother Bram to restore that Revelation that he gave to St Paul in the beginning God restored the Revelation here at the end time Jesus also said that in Matthew 17:1 Elijah shall come and restore all things so brother BR was anointed with the spirit of Elijah to restore the revelation of the godhead to the people of God it's also a fulfillment of Malachi 45 and6 that Elijah the Holy Spirit upon brother Brandon would turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers so we rejoice in that friends we're so glad we've been visited by the Holy Ghost using a prophet to restore the word of God to our hearts if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
