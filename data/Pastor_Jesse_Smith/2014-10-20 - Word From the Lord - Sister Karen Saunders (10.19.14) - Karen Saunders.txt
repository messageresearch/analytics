TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you've been a real help and strength to my christian life and you never back down i know the things that i have talked to you about and you lived when uh brother camp brother simon and sister beth i stay with them when i come up here normally i did stay at your house one time but when we were having meetings at their house i had talked to you about something god don't you don't have no respect for a person and he brought a message through you that liked to kill me but it hurt me and he taught me that things that hurt instruct amen and so god bless you and i this is a this is a good testimony for me to show you how god in the real small things of our lives everything matters i asked god if i could give brother dave luella you know one of those books i wanted to give him from my heart and i said lord i want to have more you let me give them so when i got here and things started moving around where the craig brought one up and i saw brother dave walking around with the book and i said lord how did you get that book i said well i asked you for good luck i said lord please take it back he said he said brother craig had given it to him and then a little later i found out through him and i said oh do you do you have a book he said well no sister he said you know what happened i said what he said brother craig actually brought up her brother jesse he said but he gave it to me and he gave it to somebody and he gave it his brother for him and then the wrong person got it and he said and i said lord you don't give it back and they had to give it back and give it to the right person so last yesterday over to sister bessie's name i said so for the dave do you have a book he said well no not really he said but i'll give one i thought you know he said here's what happened it went through the wrong channels he said and what happened he said that so i gave it back friday night these messages were dangerous i know that i know that i don't have to think about it i don't have to you know i know it i know it in my own life i know my own heart the message that came friday night was so compelling by saturday i got here i was sweeping and crying in my heart and i thought oh lord so the lord left with me and i think some of you saw me approach sister beth now sister beth and brother side didn't do anything i had to go to them and apologize but the lord dealt with my heart and he showed me that i i didn't repent that these meetings they would not go to spirit because one person would have stopped everything and so i had to get that out of my life because i didn't want to stop god in your life and so when god brought the message today and the blood of the spirit began to move i knew that obedience it always is the right thing to do yay my people i would say unto thee this day i the lord thy god have called these meetings yea i will speak to your heart today yay i have caused you to have a great time in my spirit but yes said the lord now i shall bring thee a warning said the lord yea saith the lord you must repent except ye repent saith the lord you will not make it i will cause you said the lord to stand in stagnant waters and thou will not move until i have spoken yes said the lord search thy heart search thy soul repent run to the altar said the lord for the hour is late for the time is at hand and yes said the lord hear my voice just say think not of the flesh but thank you the living god yes saith the lord for i am with thee i am with thee in repentance if thou not repent surely i shall leave the lord oh god wow thank you thank you jesus oh you
