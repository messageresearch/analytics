[0:02] now watch and the hearts of the children
[0:05] to the fathers any second coming in the
[0:08] last days he turns back to the apostolic
[0:11] faith again amen see how perfect the
[0:14] scriptures line
[0:15] up greetings friends in the matchless
[0:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:20] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:22] viewer's question are there two
[0:24] different Ministries spoken of in
[0:26] Malachi 4: 6 it says and he shall turn
[0:31] the heart of the fathers to the children
[0:33] and the Heart of the children to their
[0:34] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[0:36] with a curse so I got this question from
[0:39] a brother who believes the message but
[0:41] he has been challenged by an accuser of
[0:44] brother brandom claiming that there are
[0:46] not two Ministries here in Malachi 4:6
[0:50] so I'll read the question of the viewer
[0:51] here hello Pastor Smith God bless you I
[0:54] have a question about Malachi 4:6 and
[0:56] Luke 1:17 I found an article by a Polish
[0:59] critic of the message who believes that
[1:01] there is no division into two persons
[1:03] here but that John the Baptist is the
[1:05] Fulfillment of the entire prophecy and
[1:07] believes that these words quote and the
[1:10] disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:12] righteous end quote are the same as Sons
[1:15] to the fathers what do you think about
[1:17] it so my answer was God bless you good
[1:21] question my answer is the Polish critic
[1:24] is wrong there are two Ministries two
[1:27] different Ministries from two different
[1:28] men in Malachi
[1:30] 4:6 and the proof of that is found in
[1:33] John
[1:35] 1:21 and they asked him what then art
[1:38] thou Elias and he saith I am not art
[1:41] thou that prophet and he answered no so
[1:44] notice John the Baptist says he was not
[1:47] that Elijah Prophet but yet Luke 1:17
[1:51] says he was anointed with the spirit of
[1:53] Elijah so either John the Baptist is
[1:55] lying or John the Baptist wasn't aware
[1:58] that he had the spirit of Elijah or
[1:59] there's two separate Ministries for the
[2:02] spirit of Elijah in Malachi 4:6 so we
[2:05] know the answer is that there are two
[2:07] separate Ministries two different men
[2:09] Anointed with the spirit of Elijah in
[2:11] Malachi
[2:12] 4:6 and friends I've seen numerous
[2:14] videos of Jewish priests and other Jews
[2:17] faithful Jews and they are still looking
[2:19] for Elijah to come before the great and
[2:21] Dreadful day of the Lord just as Malachi
[2:24] 45 and 6 speak about let's read Luke
[2:27] 1:17 though and he should go before him
[2:30] in the spirit and power of Elias to turn
[2:32] the hearts of the fathers to the
[2:33] children and the disobedient to the
[2:35] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[2:36] people prepared for the Lord so truly
[2:39] it's thus sayith the Bible that John the
[2:41] Baptist had the spirit of Elijah and
[2:43] John the Baptist fulfilled that first
[2:45] Ministry turning the hearts of the
[2:47] fathers to the children in Malachi
[2:50] 4:6 but then John said I'm not that
[2:53] Elijah so John must have been speaking
[2:55] of the second part of that verse the
[2:57] second phrase and the Heart of the
[2:58] children to their father fathers lest I
[3:00] come and smite the Earth with a curse we
[3:03] know John the Baptist wouldn't lie about
[3:05] his Elijah Ministry so then John the
[3:08] Baptist had the spirit of Elijah to turn
[3:11] the hearts of the fathers spiritual to
[3:14] the children spiritual as Luke 1:17 says
[3:18] I can't find any Bible proof that John
[3:21] the Baptist was dealing with the natural
[3:23] fathers the natural Jewish fathers or
[3:25] the natural Jewish children so this has
[3:28] to have a spiritual meaning this was
[3:30] meaning John the Baptist turned the
[3:33] hearts of the early church fathers to
[3:35] Christ giving them a passion for the
[3:37] coming of the Lord remember John pointed
[3:40] out Behold the Lamb of God who takes
[3:42] away the sin of the
[3:44] world remember John the Baptist had a
[3:46] preparation Ministry Isaiah 40:3 said he
[3:49] was the voice to make ready a people
[3:50] prepared for the Lord so John the
[3:52] Baptist Was preparing getting them ready
[3:55] for the Messiah and brother William
[3:57] brandham was restoring the gospel so the
[4:00] hearts of the children were ready for
[4:02] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ at
[4:04] the second coming of the Messiah there
[4:07] was a follow-up question this brother
[4:09] had a great question he said but what
[4:11] does the phrase in Luke 1:17 mean and
[4:14] the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[4:19] righteous this precious brother wondered
[4:21] why this phrase wasn't in Malachi 45
[4:25] and6 and this polish critic was trying
[4:27] to say that phrase the disobedient to
[4:29] the wisdom of of the righteous was
[4:31] fulfillment of the second part of
[4:32] Malachi 4:5 and 6 but they don't match
[4:36] turning the heart of the children to
[4:38] their fathers doesn't match with the
[4:40] disobedient to the wisdom of the
[4:42] righteous I think another verse in the
[4:45] Book of Luke explains what Luke 117
[4:49] means if you go to Luke 310-1 14 you see
[4:53] John the Baptist helping the disobedient
[4:55] giving them wisdom to be righteous so
[4:58] it's lukee 3 10-4 and the people ask him
[5:01] saying what shall we do then he anth and
[5:04] saith unto them he that hath two coats
[5:06] let him impart to him that hath none and
[5:08] he that hath meat let him do likewise
[5:10] then came also publicans to be baptized
[5:13] and said unto him Master what shall we
[5:14] do and he said unto them exact no more
[5:17] than that which is appointed you and the
[5:19] soldiers likewise demanded of him saying
[5:21] and what shall we do and he said unto
[5:23] them do violence to no man neither
[5:25] accuse any falsely and be content with
[5:28] your wages
[5:30] so here John is helping the disobedient
[5:32] become righteous through the wisdom of
[5:35] the Holy Spirit and what was that wisdom
[5:37] if you have two coats give one coat away
[5:40] if you have meat and someone's hungry
[5:42] give them some of your meat and the
[5:44] publicans are Tax Collectors he said
[5:46] just ask for the amount of taxes that's
[5:49] appointed to you don't steal money from
[5:51] people don't take extra tax money and
[5:53] lie about how much the government wants
[5:56] and then keep some of it see John was
[5:58] giving them with wisdom to be righteous
[6:00] instead of disobedient and then he told
[6:03] the soldiers the same don't be
[6:05] disobedient and be violent don't accuse
[6:08] anyone falsely be content with your
[6:10] wages this is the wisdom of God to be
[6:13] righteous to even soldiers friends if
[6:15] you like more Bible teaching about
[6:17] brother bram's Ministry and Malachi 45
[6:19] and6 I wrote an entire chapter about his
[6:21] ministry in my 2021 book The 12 New
[6:24] Testament Mysteries revealed it starts
[6:26] on page 741 and goes to page
[6:31] 785 so I wrote almost 40 pages on
[6:34] brother br's Ministry I could have wrote
[6:35] more but I had to shorten the book it
[6:37] shows six scriptures God used brother
[6:39] random to fulfill one of which was
[6:42] Malachi 45 and 6 then of course there's
[6:45] 30 thus sayi the Lords in this chapter
[6:47] as well again just as another proof that
[6:49] brother Brenham was a genuine prophet of
[6:51] God hopefully this video was a blessing
[6:53] by the grace of God if you have any
[6:56] questions concerns or testimonies about
[6:57] this video please contact me
[7:00] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[7:02] the desire of your heart
