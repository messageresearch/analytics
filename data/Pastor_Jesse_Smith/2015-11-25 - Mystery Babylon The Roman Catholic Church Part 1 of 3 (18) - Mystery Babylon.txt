TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer the question, is mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic Church? Our answer is yes. We believe the Bible and history teach that the Roman Catholic Church is mystery Babylon as thoroughly detailed throughout the Bible. But specifically taught in Revelation chapters 17 and 18. But first, we want to clearly state that we are not against the people that are trapped inside the Roman Catholic Church system. We have friends and family members that are Roman Catholic. We are against the system, power, and numerous false teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. And this video was made with a pure and loving desire to resound Revelation 18:es 4 and 5 and call God's people out of the Roman Catholic Church system and into the true church, the Holy Ghostfilled bride of Jesus Christ. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. [Music] As we begin, please know that the Roman Catholic Church is the only church that meets all 14 of the Bible descriptions for Mystery Babylon that we will cover on this video. No other person, church, or institution even comes close to meeting all these 14 Bible requirements that we'll cover on this video for being Mystery Babylon. May the Holy Spirit grant you wisdom to recognize beyond a shadow of a doubt who this mysterious mother church is that you might get victory over her false doctrines, over her idolatries and man worship like the saints described in Revelation 15:es 1-3. Mystery [Music] Babylon. We begin at Revelation 17:5, which tells us the name of this woman, Mystery Babylon. The Roman Catholic Church is the modern-day Babylon because it presents a false path to heaven that is contrary to the Bible and brings great confusion to what exactly is the truth of God as we will soon show through their false doctrines. Just as the city of Babylon in Genesis 11:es 1-9 was a man-made way to try to get to heaven. The word Babylon means confusion. And God is not the author of confusion according to 1 Corinthians 14:33. The only way to not be confused is to know the truth. And Jesus said the Bible is the truth according to John 17:17. And this truth sets us free from all error according to John 8:32. Babylon began in the book of Genesis. And the spirit of Babylon is seen throughout the entire Bible and ends up in the book of Revelation. Most specifically described in chapters 17 and 18 which deal with this church, Mystery Babylon. Mystery Babylon as a woman and a mother. Revelation 17:es 3 and 5 describe mystery Babylon as a woman and a mother. Let's first discuss the woman description. The wisdom of God teaches Bible readers that a woman is symbolic of a church in scripture. This symbolism is seen through two examples, the people of Israel and the New Testament church, referred to as the bride or wife of Christ. Israel was called the church in the wilderness in Acts 7:38 and was likened unto a woman in many cases, but most easily seen in the entire chapter of Ezekiel 16. In this chapter, God called Israel harlot unto him, and Israel's sister Samaria had also been involved in abominations and whoredoms just as Israel had. The second example is a New Testament church referred to as the bride or wife of Christ in Revelation 21:9 and Revelation 19:7. This New Testament church is also symbolized as a woman and is most easily seen in Ephesians 5:es 22-33 as St. Paul teaches that a husband is to represent Christ and that a wife is to represent the New Testament church. Next, this woman or church in Revelation 17 was called a mother and clearly represents the original or first church as the word mother signifies. In this case, it would be the first organized Christian church, which was the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church unashamedly claims to be the mother church. The church from which every church took its start. The Roman Catholic Church very well may be the first or mother church, but only by the fact that is the first to organize and be led by man rather than by God. We believe the true church of the living God, never denominated or organized like the Roman Catholic Church did. Every Holy Ghostfilled believer can belong to the true original church today that actually started on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2. The Roman Catholic Church is not that true Acts 2 church. Instead, they are the mother of denominationalism and tradition-based worship, which ultimately was called vain worship according to Jesus in Matthew 15:9. In Revelation 23, the Bible also teaches that the mother church, the Roman Catholic Church, has daughters. All churches that follow denomination or those that teach traditional creeds of men, such as the three-person Trinity doctrine, for one example, are daughters of the mother because they behave just like their mother, denying the plain truth of the scripture, and both add and take away from the Holy Bible. Since most churches confess faith in a supposed trinity, a threeperson God, which is completely unscriptural and ultimately promotes polytheism, most churches today are partaking in the false doctrine of the mother church and are thus daughter churches because they have also added to the word of God like the mother church. Please view our video on the seven reasons why the trinity doctrine is wrong. Truly, most churches have fulfilled the scripture of Ezekiel 16:44. As the mother is, so is her daughter. Just as the Roman Catholic Church added to the Bible and created a threeperson God with a false triune baptism in the titles father, Son, Holy Ghost instead of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So have most churches, whether denominational or non-denominational, also partaken of the same false doctrines, and thus are daughters of the mother harlot, sits on many waters. According to Revelation 17 1-15, the Roman Catholic Church sits on many waters, which the Bible interprets for us as being people, multitudes, nations, and tongues. The Roman Catholic Church sits on or has influence upon many peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. Here are the facts about the Roman Catholic Church. 17% of the world population consider themselves Catholic, over 1.2 billion people. The Roman Catholic Church has over 222,000 parishes worldwide. And there are parishes in nearly every country on Earth. Nearly every nation has either diplomatic or other political relations with the Holy Sea. Sits on seven mountains or hills. Revelation 17:9 teaches that this church or woman sits on seven mountains or hills. The city of Rome, which is the home of the Vatican, is famous for having seven hills on which the ancient city of Rome was built. Seven hills of Rome. Group of hills on or about which the ancient city of Rome was built. Some people say that the seven hills reference from Revelation 17:9 could refer to a different location and not Rome. While it is true that other cities may have seven hills, such as Istanbul, Turkey, no other city than Rome, can meet all the other 13 requirements needed to be considered mystery Babylon, the mother of harlots.
