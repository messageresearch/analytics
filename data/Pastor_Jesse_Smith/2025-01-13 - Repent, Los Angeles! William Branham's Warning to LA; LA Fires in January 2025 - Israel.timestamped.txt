[0:03] repent Los
[0:05] Angeles repent to rest of you and turn
[0:08] to God the hour of his wrath is upon the
[0:10] Earth flee while there's time to flee
[0:14] and come into
[0:16] Christ greetings friends in the
[0:18] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:21] the purpose of this video is to give my
[0:23] reaction to the Los Angeles wildfires
[0:26] which began on January 7th
[0:28] 2025 a brother named Derek had emailed
[0:31] me about this on January 9th he shared
[0:34] some pictures from space of Los Angeles
[0:36] [Music]
[0:40] burning and he shared a great quote from
[0:42] brother brandham that said Los Angeles
[0:45] the City of Angels which are exalted
[0:47] into heaven will be brought down into
[0:51] hell he wanted to know my thoughts on
[0:54] this quote and my humble thoughts are
[0:56] just that I think God is giving Los
[0:58] Angeles another warning of course before
[1:02] Los Angeles sinks in the ocean as
[1:04] prophesied by God's Prophet brother
[1:06] William brandham I remember this my last
[1:09] message in California where I thought
[1:11] I'd never go back again when I predicted
[1:13] Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean
[1:15] thus sayeth the Lord it
[1:18] will she's done she's washed she's
[1:21] finished what hour I don't know when but
[1:24] it will be sunk so I appreciate brother
[1:26] dereck's spiritual email I told him him
[1:30] I was glad the spirit of God had
[1:31] quickened that brother random quote to
[1:33] his remembrance there's about five or
[1:36] six quotes where brother randam speaks
[1:37] of Los Angeles being brought down to
[1:39] Hell just as Jesus spoke of capernium
[1:42] being brought down to Hell in Luke 10:15
[1:45] I'll play one of them it's from the
[1:46] choosing of the Bride preached in Los
[1:49] Angeles April 29th 1965 brother randam
[1:53] pleads with Los Angeles to repent let's
[1:56] listen to the quote thou City who claims
[2:00] to be the city of the
[2:02] Angels who's exalted yourself into
[2:05] heaven and sent all the dirty filthy
[2:07] things of Fashions and things the even
[2:10] the foreign countries come here to pick
[2:11] up our filth and send it away You're
[2:14] your fine churches and Steeples and so
[2:17] forth the way you do remember one
[2:20] day you will be laying in the bottom of
[2:23] the sea you're a great honeycom under
[2:27] you right now the wrath of God is
[2:29] belching right beneath you how much
[2:32] longer you'll hold this sandb hanging
[2:34] out over that on that ocean out under a
[2:35] mile deep will slide in there pump back
[2:37] to the salt and
[2:41] Seed it'll be worse than the last day of
[2:45] pompe repent Los
[2:47] Angeles repent the rest of you and turn
[2:51] to God the hour of his wrath is upon the
[2:53] Earth flee while there's time to flee
[2:56] and come into Christ
[3:01] let us pray dear
[3:04] God my spirit is
[3:08] shaking my heart is dropping teardrops
[3:12] of
[3:14] warning gr old God that men and women
[3:18] will not think of what I've said as a
[3:20] joke and the church people will not
[3:23] think of it as something that was
[3:25] Prejudice or against them may they see
[3:28] lord it's in love
[3:31] so certainly brother random was inspired
[3:33] of the Holy Spirit to warn Los Angeles
[3:35] of a great earthquake that would sink
[3:37] Los Angeles and so the Los Angeles fires
[3:40] I do not think are part of the prophecy
[3:43] but I do think it's a warning from God
[3:46] God in his gracious heart giving the
[3:49] people of Los Angeles another warning
[3:51] about the Doom that is coming of course
[3:54] because of all the filth and trash and
[3:57] wickedness that has come out of Los
[3:58] Angeles brother Brandon was right to
[4:01] warn Los Angeles of oncoming judgment
[4:04] because so much Supernatural had been
[4:06] done by the Holy Ghost in Los Angeles to
[4:09] try to save Souls think of the
[4:12] 1906 isua Street Revival right there in
[4:14] Los Angeles but Los Angeles has turned
[4:17] it down for the wickedness of
[4:19] Hollywood then even in brother bram's
[4:21] Ministry brother Bram did many signs
[4:23] wonders and miracles there in Los
[4:25] Angeles it was God declaring his glory
[4:28] in Los Angeles and yet the city turned
[4:31] it down of course even brother Leroy and
[4:34] Paul cop from the
[4:36] 1953 20 Century Prophet noted all the
[4:39] signs of healings and miracles that were
[4:41] done in Los Angeles at Calvary Temple
[4:44] let's listen to the quote brother
[4:46] brandham in your two great campaigns at
[4:48] Los Angeles at Calvary Temple we noticed
[4:51] that the Lord Jesus Christ worked with
[4:53] you in a very special manner with these
[4:55] marvelous gifts these earning of the
[4:57] spirits of men's Hearts as well as the
[5:00] sicknesses of the body and the signs of
[5:02] healing and miracles that were wrought
[5:04] we thought it was wonderful we're
[5:06] interested brother brandham in hearing
[5:08] more about this unique Ministry that God
[5:09] has given
[5:10] you very well brother cop let's go back
[5:14] to the beginning next I want to play a
[5:16] portion of a video from Ray comfort's
[5:18] YouTube channel Living Waters I was
[5:21] listening to this video while I was
[5:22] driving to church yesterday and he
[5:24] played a series of news clips and in one
[5:27] of them a reporter says she was driving
[5:30] through Los Angeles and it was like
[5:32] driving through hell so again this
[5:34] relates to Jesus's prophecy about
[5:36] capernium brought down to Hell now we
[5:38] know the term brought down to Hell means
[5:40] the souls will be taken to Hades or shol
[5:43] or Hell the prison house for Souls that
[5:46] have rejected the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[5:48] but again I just thought it was a very
[5:49] fitting warning Los Angeles is in a
[5:52] current state where it's burning like
[5:54] hell and so it's God's grace it's God's
[5:57] warning for the people to repent and
[5:59] turn to the Lord Jesus Christ so here's
[6:01] that video clip from Living Waters with
[6:04] three shout
[6:05] outs God creator of the universe zero
[6:10] mentions marking God and using his name
[6:13] as a cuss word is nothing new for
[6:15] Hollywood but less than 48 hours after
[6:18] the golden globe's blasphemy Hollywood
[6:20] was on fire tonight a new fire breaking
[6:23] out late this evening in the Hollywood
[6:25] Hills who would have ever thought this
[6:28] Los Angeles is on fire I talked to a
[6:31] fireman once he was telling me he goes
[6:33] dude one day he goes it's just going to
[6:35] be the right Wind and Fire is going to
[6:37] start in the right place and it's going
[6:39] to burn through La all the way to the
[6:41] ocean and there's not a thing we can do
[6:42] about it the scene
[6:47] horrific this is new aerial video of a
[6:50] six fire the sunset Fire based in the
[6:53] Hollywood Hills firefighters there doing
[6:55] everything they can but there simply
[6:57] Aren't Enough of them to fight the
[6:59] horror that has exploded right now
[7:01] people are rushing to escape the
[7:03] Hollywood Hills brand new fire exploded
[7:06] down the Hollywood Hills making a beine
[7:08] for the iconic heart of the
[7:10] entertainment industry it is like
[7:13] driving through hell itself down here
[7:17] literally through hell tens of thousands
[7:19] of people have fled for their lives
[7:21] abandoning their cars when they could go
[7:23] no further a new fire erupting in the
[7:25] Hollywood Hills marching toward iconic
[7:28] landmarks more than 30,000 people were
[7:30] under evacuation orders across Southern
[7:32] California a new fire has broken out in
[7:35] the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles
[7:37] threatening landmarks like the Dolby
[7:39] Theater where the Oscar ceremony is to
[7:41] be held in just a few weeks literally
[7:44] grabbed our phones to computer and our
[7:47] dogs and ran out the wind hits the wrong
[7:50] way it's just going to burn straight
[7:51] through LA and there's not going to be a
[7:53] thing we could do about it there's
[7:54] nothing they can
[7:55] do last I've been reading through
[7:57] Jeremiah and God gave Jeremiah numerous
[8:00] thus sayith the Lord warnings for Judah
[8:03] Jerusalem all of Israel and at least six
[8:06] times God had Jeremiah say thus sayith
[8:08] the Lord I've sent you prophets turn
[8:11] from your ways and yet the people would
[8:12] not turn from your ways so again I see a
[8:15] parallel between Jeremiah's ministry as
[8:17] a prophet to call Israel to repentance
[8:20] and brother bram's ministry as a genuine
[8:22] prophet of God trying to call Los
[8:23] Angeles and of course the whole world
[8:25] but even the United States to repentance
[8:27] and yet they did not amend their ways
[8:30] one example is Jeremiah 44: 4-6 how be
[8:34] it I sent unto you all my servants the
[8:36] prophets Rising early and sending them
[8:38] saying Oh do not this abominable thing
[8:40] that I hate for Los Angeles stop putting
[8:42] out all these abominable movies and TV
[8:45] shows verse 5 but they hearkened not nor
[8:47] unin their ear to turn from their
[8:50] wickedness to burn no incense unto other
[8:53] gods wherefore my Fury and my anger was
[8:56] poured forth and was kindled in the
[8:58] cities of Judah and in the the streets
[8:59] of Jerusalem think about the streets of
[9:02] Los Angeles and they are wasted and
[9:04] desolate as at this
[9:07] day also Jeremiah 26:5 to hearken to the
[9:11] words of my servants the prophets whom I
[9:12] sent unto you both rising up early and
[9:15] sending them but you have not hearkened
[9:17] then will I make this house like Shiloh
[9:18] and will make this city a curse to all
[9:20] the nations of the earth surely Los
[9:22] Angeles has been a curse to all the
[9:24] nations of the earth as of yesterday
[9:27] January 12th 20 25 Reports say 38,000
[9:32] Acres have been burned in Los Angeles
[9:35] which is the equivalent of about 59
[9:37] square miles over 16 people have died
[9:41] and there's been at least 10,000
[9:43] structures destroyed and almost a
[9:46] quarter million people have been
[9:48] displaced so yesterday in church we
[9:50] prayed for them all the people affected
[9:52] that they would repent of course be safe
[9:54] so that's what we'll end this video with
[9:56] as well father God we thank you for your
[9:58] grace and mercy Lord we see this as a
[10:00] warning to the people of Los Angeles
[10:03] Lord surely we know the city itself will
[10:05] not fully repent neither will this
[10:08] nation fully repent but God we just pray
[10:10] for the individuals Lord God that you're
[10:12] dealing with that they'll repent May
[10:14] Souls get saved because they see the
[10:16] reality of the judgments of God lord you
[10:19] know how to open Hearts just like you
[10:21] did Lydia's heart in Acts 16 so I pray
[10:23] you to Open Hearts soften hearts and may
[10:26] they receive the Gospel of the Lord
[10:27] Jesus Christ that they might be saved
[10:29] thank you God for sending us a prophet
[10:31] that warned this nation Lord God that
[10:33] warned Los Angeles with us sayith the
[10:35] Lord we trust in you Lord God we are
[10:37] believing your prophets we're believing
[10:38] your word because your word cannot fail
[10:41] so father be merciful to all those
[10:42] impacted Lord God keep them safe
[10:44] physically bless the First Responders
[10:46] Lord God anoint them Lord God the
[10:48] firefighters have mercy upon this city
[10:50] we pray we know you have for so many
[10:52] years since the prophecy brother Ram
[10:54] gave almost 60 years so we ask for your
[10:56] continued long-suffering and mercy in
[10:58] Jesus Jesus Christ's name
[11:01] amen if you have any questions concerns
[11:03] or testimonies about this video please
[11:05] contact
[11:06] [Music]
[11:07] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[11:10] the desire of your heart
