[0:16] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:21] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:24] couple viewers questions they asked do I
[0:27] set up a Christmas tree or not
[0:30] So my answer was no there's four reasons
[0:32] why I don't but I also don't think
[0:34] setting up a Christmas tree is a sin of
[0:36] itself
[0:37] I'm trying on purpose to make this a
[0:40] short video as I'm anxious to get to the
[0:42] second seal and the rest of the seal
[0:44] videos in the series about proving
[0:46] brother Branham did not plagiarize the
[0:48] Seven Seals so if you have more
[0:50] questions about this topic of Christmas
[0:52] and Christmas trees you can definitely
[0:54] make those requests to me
[0:56] Christmas is a subject that has lots of
[0:58] quotes from Brother Branham and so a lot
[1:00] more videos could be done on it if the
[1:02] Lord was willing
[1:04] additionally I preached a sermon in 2018
[1:06] called how we worship at Christmas time
[1:09] and you can watch it on our Church's
[1:11] YouTube channel bride of Christ
[1:12] Fellowship Akron it's from October 24
[1:15] 2018.
[1:17] and it's a more extensive look at the
[1:19] subject of Christmas
[1:21] so for this video I'm not going to cover
[1:23] the history of Christmas at all because
[1:25] I think there's a more simple answer for
[1:27] believers today and that answer of
[1:29] course is in the word of God
[1:31] and frankly some of the history I read
[1:33] about Christmas and Christmas
[1:34] celebrations doesn't seem to have a lot
[1:36] of evidence that it's accurate and so if
[1:38] there's any question about a subject I
[1:40] like to then focus more on the word of
[1:43] God and how we can find answers to that
[1:45] question about that subject in the Holy
[1:48] Bible the word of God which is the
[1:49] written absolute and of course Jesus
[1:52] Christ himself is the person of the
[1:54] absolute
[1:55] so here's the outline for this video
[1:57] first we'll look at why Christmas is a
[2:00] Christian Liberty
[2:02] second we'll look at a few of brother
[2:04] branham's Christmas traditions
[2:06] and lastly we'll look at the four
[2:08] reasons I do not personally set up a
[2:10] Christmas tree
[2:12] first why Christmas is a Christian
[2:15] Liberty
[2:16] as we know if there's a Bible question
[2:18] there must be a Bible answer so over the
[2:21] course of 18 years of being a minister I
[2:24] found Colossians 2 verses 16 and 17 to
[2:27] be the most important scripture related
[2:29] to holiday traditions and customs
[2:32] it reads let no man therefore judge you
[2:34] and meat or and drink or in respect of
[2:37] an holy day or of the new moon or of the
[2:40] Sabbath days which are a shadow of
[2:42] things to come but the body is Christ
[2:46] so of course this statement by Paul
[2:48] respect of an holy day I believe this is
[2:52] the terminology we should use for
[2:54] Christmas Thanksgiving Easter or
[2:56] Resurrection Sunday and all other
[2:58] holidays because of course these are all
[3:00] holidays where those of us here in
[3:02] America get days off from work
[3:05] so in April of 1963 brother random
[3:08] called Good Friday and Easter a series
[3:11] of holidays or holy days that the world
[3:14] sets aside to celebrate in commemoration
[3:17] great scriptural events that's happened
[3:18] in the times past
[3:21] we're now in this being what we call
[3:25] Good Friday or God's Good Friday I don't
[3:28] know why we call it that Good Friday
[3:31] but we're just in the beginning on
[3:34] another series of of holidays holy days
[3:38] at the world set aside the Christian
[3:40] world to to celebrate and commemoration
[3:44] great spiritual events that happen in
[3:49] the times past
[3:50] great things have taken place and we use
[3:53] them and make a time of celebration for
[3:57] those things which has happened
[4:00] if uh God
[4:02] if if God were here at this uh Christian
[4:07] world
[4:08] at this time and what's called the
[4:11] Christian we're all wonder what his
[4:12] attitude would be towards our manner of
[4:15] Celebration that we have a memorial of
[4:19] these great days and times that that has
[4:22] been
[4:24] so the Bible and brother Branham never
[4:27] say it's wrong to have special set-aside
[4:29] days or holy days that we use to
[4:32] commemorate past events
[4:34] but of course there are genuine
[4:35] questions how should we celebrate or how
[4:38] should we commemorate
[4:39] and of course the answer is we should
[4:40] Worship the Lord Jesus Christ and of
[4:42] course love others
[4:44] because loving others is the Fulfillment
[4:46] of the whole law
[4:47] it's also important to know that brother
[4:49] random called Christmas time a sacred
[4:51] time just like Good Friday just like
[4:54] Resurrection Day
[4:55] brother Ram said this and God's Gift
[4:58] always find a place 1963.
[5:01] it's still the sacredness of remembering
[5:03] that God gave us the hope that we have
[5:05] in US
[5:07] different than me see today when we are
[5:11] even if it's if it's
[5:14] [Applause]
[5:18] a job remembering that God gave us the
[5:22] hope that we have in his hands
[5:26] up his own Santa Claus thing going on
[5:29] like this might as well don't know sir
[5:32] girl this is my Pagan celebration to us
[5:35] and this is
[5:37] [Applause]
[5:42] no love there's been no peace that been
[5:45] old Hereafter and for the uh a Believer
[5:48] if there have been no Christmas
[5:52] and then why little Bethlehem 1963
[5:54] brother random said whatever day it
[5:57] might be we still doesn't take away the
[6:00] sacredness of what it's supposed to be
[6:02] from the 28th uh first to the 25th of
[6:06] December the sun's setting right almost
[6:08] harder changes at all
[6:10] and then that was the sun God's birthday
[6:12] so they changed it to the Son of God but
[6:14] remember
[6:15] work every what day it might be
[6:19] beat we still
[6:22] still going to be
[6:25] so from these quotes from Brother
[6:26] Branham and Colossians 2 verse 16 we can
[6:30] clearly see that Christians are allowed
[6:32] to celebrate holidays or holy days
[6:35] and clearly Paul sets these holy days
[6:37] aside as Christian liberties
[6:40] and Christian Liberty is something that
[6:42] a Christian can do and in some aspects
[6:45] the Christian is neither better nor
[6:46] worse from doing it
[6:49] this is what Paul said in First
[6:50] Corinthians 8 verse 8 and 9.
[6:53] he said but me commendeth us not to God
[6:55] for neither if we eat are we the better
[6:57] neither if we eat not are we the worse
[7:00] but take heed less by any means this
[7:03] Liberty of yours become a stumbling
[7:04] block to them that are weak
[7:06] so here Paul defends Christians
[7:08] liberties
[7:10] and in each Liberty that we have we need
[7:12] to make sure we're not causing anybody
[7:14] to stumble
[7:15] and so in my personal life as my 2018
[7:17] sermon showed I do not believe I'm
[7:20] causing anybody to stumble when I give
[7:22] each of my eight children three small
[7:24] gifts
[7:25] a book a toy and clothing
[7:29] and when my wife and I give them these
[7:31] gifts we do extra Bible reading on
[7:34] Christmas morning we sing extra worship
[7:36] songs and we tell them that we're giving
[7:39] these gifts as a memorial of the great
[7:41] gift God gave to us his son Jesus Christ
[7:44] just as brother Branham modeled for us
[7:47] I think the church has gone a little
[7:49] present here for the little kitties that
[7:50] you while I was just looking the door
[7:51] back there oh you want to stay at your
[7:53] Sunday School
[7:55] years I think they got some presents
[7:58] back there for the little fellas to give
[7:59] out this morning
[8:01] and um
[8:02] when I you little folks remember while
[8:05] we're doing this
[8:06] I want to make this clear it's not Santa
[8:09] Claus
[8:12] thread that someday you'll learn it's
[8:14] nothing to it
[8:15] but it's from Jesus Christ the truth of
[8:19] all truth is a Son of God and we're
[8:22] giving you this little present this
[8:24] morning because it's letting you know
[8:26] that one time God gave the greatest
[8:28] present could ever be give to the human
[8:29] rights
[8:32] and um we have a poor way expressed and
[8:34] there's nothing we can give to compare
[8:36] with that but just as morals one to
[8:37] another we do that
[8:41] and also Romans 14 verses 15 16 and 20
[8:44] show how we must not destroy others with
[8:47] our liberties and again I don't see how
[8:49] my worship at Christmas time causes
[8:51] anybody to be destroyed I've never seen
[8:54] my family's Christmas traditions destroy
[8:57] anyone's faith
[8:58] for example we don't go into debt to buy
[9:01] our small Christmas gifts we always stay
[9:03] within our means we stay within our
[9:05] budget
[9:06] and none of the gifts glorify the world
[9:07] or glorify Satan or lead any of our
[9:10] children into sin
[9:11] and then in Romans 14 16 Paul said let
[9:15] not then your good be evil spoken of
[9:17] so that's why I preached that sermon in
[9:19] 2018 I didn't want my good and holy
[9:21] commemorations on Christmas to be evil
[9:24] spoken of because I do not believe
[9:26] there's anything wrong with them
[9:28] and then in Romans 14 20 it said all
[9:30] things are indeed pure and of course
[9:32] Paul is talking about Christian
[9:33] Liberties there's nothing wrong with
[9:35] giving someone a present as an
[9:38] expression of your love for them
[9:39] and also as an expression of God's great
[9:42] love for us
[9:43] I think it's important to look at the
[9:44] life of Saint Paul who is the author
[9:46] about Christian Liberties and notice how
[9:48] he took his Christian liberties
[9:51] and a few of them are recorded in Acts
[9:53] chapter 18.
[9:54] Paul kept an Old Testament vow in Acts
[9:57] 18 verse 18. and was going to shave his
[10:00] head at the completion of The Vow now
[10:02] there's nothing in the New Testament
[10:03] that requires men to shave their heads
[10:05] so Paul was clearly using his Christian
[10:07] Liberty to keep an Old Testament vow
[10:10] during a time that the New Testament has
[10:12] already been established and he's
[10:14] helping establish it
[10:15] and then in Acts 18 verse 21 Paul wanted
[10:18] to by all means keep the feast in
[10:21] Jerusalem so the same man Paul that said
[10:23] Christ is our Passover wanted to keep
[10:26] another feast in Jerusalem a literal
[10:28] actual Jewish feast and Paul knew he had
[10:31] that Christian Liberty to do so
[10:34] so all these scriptures and quotes from
[10:36] Brother Branham help us to understand
[10:37] that any holiday celebration or
[10:40] commemoration or tradition is a
[10:43] Christian Liberty and yes we must guard
[10:45] them to make sure they don't become
[10:47] sinful of course
[10:48] and that's why the Holy Ghost was given
[10:50] to us so he would guide us into all
[10:51] truth convict us of sin and keep us
[10:54] walking on the straight and narrow path
[10:58] brother branham's Christmas traditions
[11:02] friends I personally believe brother
[11:04] Branham found the right balance in his
[11:06] worship at Christmas time I believe the
[11:09] Holy Ghost would have convicted brother
[11:10] Branham of his Traditions if he was off
[11:13] balance or too carnal but I don't hear
[11:16] that on brother random sermons
[11:18] I'm not going to play all these quotes
[11:20] I'm just going to reference them but
[11:21] brother Branham of course gave presents
[11:23] to his wife and his children and his
[11:25] wife gave him presents for example a new
[11:27] Bible
[11:28] brother random gave brother Neville a
[11:30] coat that brother Neville needed
[11:32] and of course brother Graham told his
[11:34] congregation he couldn't give everyone a
[11:37] gift because he didn't have the money to
[11:39] do it but he appreciated all the
[11:40] Christmas gifts that the congregation
[11:42] gave him
[11:43] less than three weeks before brother
[11:45] Brandon passed away he was still
[11:46] thanking people for Christmas gifts as
[11:49] he thanked the lady for Christmas candy
[11:50] in the message leadership from December
[11:53] 7th 1965 out in California
[12:07] [Music]
[12:09] if you if you give the one it shows
[12:12] respect like that you just can't do it a
[12:14] minister just can't do that and I
[12:17] understand that brother Neville this
[12:19] morning is presented with a new
[12:23] top coat amen so grateful to you all for
[12:27] my brother there's a little secret to
[12:30] that that Billy Paul and I know
[12:33] so I said arm is going down and getting
[12:36] one so then um
[12:38] I get
[12:40] from the church
[12:43] so at that time Billy come running up
[12:46] with a great big
[12:48] uh influential a word and smile on his
[12:51] face Daddy the church
[12:54] well I know the church could probably
[12:57] get him a little better one so I thought
[12:59] that's just wonderful so we could all
[13:01] that
[13:02] we know that he come in A Real Fine
[13:05] Place in brother Neville eating that
[13:07] cold
[13:24] and uh I want to thank that lady I can't
[13:27] thank him her name Billy just told me to
[13:29] give me bucks a Christmas candy just
[13:32] brought a few moments ago this because I
[13:34] can't think of her name she's from here
[13:36] in California
[13:37] as my first Christmas present
[13:40] well I thank you for it
[13:44] now
[13:45] another thing I would like to say as
[13:48] brother Neville has sold well said that
[13:51] we wished you the best in the visual
[13:54] Tidings and this time of a fellowship
[13:58] around these holy days and so forth and
[14:01] then I want to take this time to express
[14:05] the each and every one of you
[14:08] how grateful I am to you for your
[14:11] Christmas cards and gifts and things
[14:13] that was received at our house amen I
[14:17] certainly thank you with all my heart
[14:19] and
[14:20] I receive some mighty fine Christmas
[14:22] presents a movie camera and many other
[14:26] things guns and things that people love
[14:29] me to give you and I appreciate that
[14:33] regarding the Christmas tree brother Ram
[14:35] said a lot of harsh things against
[14:37] Christmas trees and that makes sense
[14:39] because the majority of people who set
[14:41] up Christmas trees are sinners Jesus
[14:44] said few there be that find the narrow
[14:45] road
[14:46] so it's obvious most Sinners who set up
[14:49] Christmas trees set it up as an idol
[14:52] they don't set it up in honor of the
[14:54] Lord Jesus Christ they set it up as an
[14:56] idol to commercialism and perhaps greed
[14:59] or Pride
[15:00] they're so prideful that they have so
[15:02] much money to buy such amazing gifts
[15:05] such expensive gifts
[15:08] I think it's important to see how in
[15:10] 1953 brother random said Christmas trees
[15:12] were Pagan but yet seven years later he
[15:15] said he set up a Christmas tree for his
[15:17] little son Joseph
[15:19] he said quote I got a little boy small
[15:21] enough yet to kind of want a Christmas
[15:23] tree and we had it in the room end quote
[15:29] [Music]
[15:53] and then I want to take this time to
[15:57] express the each and every one of you
[16:00] how grateful I am to you for your
[16:04] Christmas cards and gifts and things
[16:06] that was received at our house amen I
[16:09] certainly thank you with all my heart it
[16:12] certainly did US good this morning when
[16:14] I got a little boy small enough yet the
[16:17] Connie wanted a Christmas tree and we
[16:19] had it in the room and this morning
[16:21] going to there I found several gifts
[16:24] from my church here and my friends from
[16:26] around different places that had come in
[16:29] laying under the tree and I don't have
[16:33] words to express to you what I how I
[16:36] appreciate every one of them and may the
[16:40] god of Heaven bless you richly is my
[16:42] prayer
[16:44] and then he talked about how he found
[16:46] several Christmas gifts from the
[16:48] congregation under the tree on Christmas
[16:51] morning and he thanked the congregation
[16:52] for those gifts brother Adam said quote
[16:55] I don't have words to express to you
[16:56] what I how I appreciate every one of
[16:58] them
[16:59] and may the god of Heaven bless you
[17:01] richly is my prayer end quote
[17:03] so brother Ram didn't have words to
[17:05] express that means he was very thankful
[17:08] the gifts made him feel the love of
[17:10] Jesus Christ from the congregation
[17:12] because he didn't even have words to
[17:13] express how much it meant to him
[17:16] so again I know a lot more could be said
[17:18] about this subject of brother Branham
[17:20] and his Christmas traditions but I just
[17:22] want to share a few of those quotes with
[17:24] you in order to show you why I think
[17:26] brother Branham had the right balance
[17:28] regarding Christmas
[17:30] four reasons I do not set up a Christmas
[17:32] tree
[17:34] so recently a brother emailed me and
[17:36] asked me why I did not set up a
[17:38] Christmas tree and I and after
[17:39] meditating on it for a few minutes I
[17:41] said there's probably four reasons I
[17:42] don't set one up even though brother
[17:44] Branham did that was his Christian
[17:46] Liberty to do that
[17:48] the first reason I said was Jeremiah
[17:49] chapter 10 verses 1 through 4 I'll read
[17:52] verses two three and four thus saith the
[17:54] Lord learn not the way of the Heathen
[17:56] and be not dismayed at the signs of
[17:58] Heaven for the Heathen are dismayed at
[18:00] them for the customs of the people are
[18:02] Vain One cutteth a tree out of the
[18:04] forest the work of the hands of the
[18:06] workmen with the ax they deck it with
[18:09] silver and with gold they fasten it with
[18:11] nails and with hammers that it move not
[18:15] of course there's a lot of different
[18:16] opinions about this passage of scripture
[18:18] but when I read this I can't help but
[18:20] see the connection between today's
[18:22] worship of Mammon or money
[18:25] the worship of commercialism and its
[18:28] similarity to Jeremiah 10 verses 1
[18:30] through 4. the scripture is clearly tree
[18:33] worship
[18:34] and for my conscience personally I can
[18:37] only have peace with God if I do not
[18:40] decorate a tree and of course that's
[18:42] just my own conscience
[18:44] and again that's my Christian Liberty I
[18:46] think we all can see how Sinners worship
[18:49] the tree and the presence underneath
[18:51] most Sinners on Christmas morning have
[18:54] no real Thanksgiving to the Lord Jesus
[18:56] Christ and aren't giving presence to
[18:58] show the love of Jesus Christ
[19:00] and the worst part is they'll neglect
[19:02] Jesus all together on Christmas
[19:04] he's the reason for the holiday but
[19:06] they'll neglect him in every activity
[19:09] and if Christmas falls on a Sunday like
[19:11] it does this year they will not go to
[19:12] church and Worship the Lord and Savior
[19:14] Jesus Christ
[19:16] so this first reason boils down to a
[19:18] pure conscience
[19:19] the majority of people today are sinners
[19:22] who are lost
[19:23] and they cut down trees or they buy a
[19:25] plastic tree and they decorate it and
[19:28] they basically worship at the idol of
[19:30] greed the idol of Mammon the idol of
[19:33] selfishness
[19:35] the idol of commercialism
[19:37] and so for me I can only have a pure
[19:39] conscience by not having a Christmas
[19:41] tree
[19:42] second a preacher came to our church
[19:44] years ago and preached a sermon and
[19:46] showed how cut down trees in the Bible
[19:49] were cursed trees
[19:51] it was a wonderful sermon it blew my
[19:53] mind I never seen that thought
[19:55] throughout the scriptures
[19:56] and so this reason is again related to
[19:58] my conscience
[20:00] I can only have peace at Christmas time
[20:02] without a Christmas tree if cut down
[20:04] trees represented a curse in the Bible
[20:07] then I don't want to cut down tree in my
[20:09] house
[20:10] on the other side I know that Jesus was
[20:12] made a curse for us according to
[20:14] Galatians 3 verse 13.
[20:16] but that of course is not the focus in
[20:19] people's minds when they set up a
[20:20] Christmas tree today they're not setting
[20:22] up the tree saying oh thank God Jesus
[20:25] was cursed for me so I don't have to be
[20:27] cursed
[20:28] most of them are just setting up because
[20:29] it's pretty
[20:31] it's a place to put all their gifts
[20:33] now with that thought in mind I think
[20:35] it'd be wonderful if those who did set
[20:36] up a tree thought about the truth of
[20:39] Galatians 3 verse 13 while they set it
[20:41] up
[20:42] maybe they would play that audio Bible
[20:44] chapter while they set up the Christmas
[20:46] tree and and just Worship the Lord Jesus
[20:48] during that time of setting it up and
[20:50] say thank you Lord you sent your son he
[20:52] was cut down and made a curse for me he
[20:55] was raised up on the cross he hung
[20:57] Between Heaven and Earth in order to be
[20:59] cursed for me
[21:00] he became a curse that I might be made
[21:02] his righteousness by faith I think if
[21:05] families did that or individuals did
[21:07] that it would be a great blessing to
[21:08] them
[21:09] but for me and my conscience according
[21:11] to these first two reasons I personally
[21:13] can't set up a Christmas tree in my
[21:15] house
[21:16] the third reason is that during my
[21:18] childhood we were very poor we were on
[21:20] food stamps most of my life and
[21:22] Christmas was a very disappointing time
[21:24] due to our poverty and our low finances
[21:27] my mother and siblings and I decorated a
[21:30] tree every year but it was usually in
[21:32] vain because of our poverty
[21:34] and so I have a lot of sad memories from
[21:36] my childhood related to Christmas and
[21:38] Christmas trees
[21:40] and I have bad memories of setting up a
[21:42] Christmas tree and then being
[21:43] disappointed as a child
[21:45] So based upon those past memories I want
[21:47] to refrain from setting up a tree in my
[21:49] house
[21:50] and this is a real thing because brother
[21:51] random said Christmas can be a curse to
[21:54] the poor children he said that in
[21:55] Falling part of the world
[21:57] he said quote but it's got to a place
[21:59] where it it's it's a curse to Little
[22:02] Children some little neighbor down the
[22:04] street can have plenty and the other
[22:05] little fellow don't have nothing and
[22:07] they look and it's it's just the whole
[22:09] thing is all together wrong end quote
[22:15] buying Christmas present months ago and
[22:17] what is it but a heathen trait
[22:20] there's nothing about it Godly all
[22:23] they're trying to say give gifts to the
[22:25] wise man that's just a
[22:27] always for a devil's excuse
[22:31] if you want to give something that's
[22:32] your life to Christ don't give to one
[22:34] another give it to him that's what he
[22:36] died for that's his purpose of coming
[22:38] right
[22:39] but it's got to be a place where it's
[22:41] it's a cursed of little children
[22:44] some little neighbor down the street can
[22:46] have plenty and the other little thought
[22:48] don't have nothing and it looks it's
[22:49] just the whole thing is all together
[22:51] wrong that's all
[22:55] so this third reason is impacted by my
[22:58] memory you know the human Spirit has
[23:00] five inlets conscious memory reason
[23:01] affection imagination the first two
[23:04] reasons I don't set up a tree relate to
[23:05] my conscience this third reason relates
[23:09] to my memory I have bad memories about
[23:12] Christmas from my childhood and setting
[23:13] up trees and so I take my Christian
[23:16] Liberty and I just refrain to set up a
[23:17] Christmas tree because of the memories
[23:19] from my childhood
[23:21] fourth and finally
[23:23] I personally see no connection between a
[23:25] glamorized tree
[23:27] and the humble birth of our Savior Jesus
[23:30] Christ in a Manger in an animal stable
[23:34] of course Christmas is a holiday about
[23:36] the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[23:38] not the resurrection it seems like a
[23:41] glamorized decorated tree symbolizes
[23:43] Jesus's resurrection it certainly
[23:46] doesn't resemble his Earthly life or his
[23:48] Nativity
[23:49] and of course you know we could not have
[23:51] Jesus resurrection without the birth so
[23:53] I'm equally thankful for Jesus's birth
[23:55] life death and Resurrection
[23:58] so our family sets up a small manger
[24:00] scene every year
[24:01] and sometimes we put the gifts by the
[24:03] manger scenes sometimes we don't most
[24:05] recently we're just putting them down in
[24:07] our basement we're not putting the gifts
[24:09] by the manger scene anymore
[24:11] but if I'm going to celebrate a holiday
[24:12] about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:14] I want to think about
[24:15] the humility in which Jesus came the
[24:18] humility in which God sent his dear son
[24:21] into the world the only begotten son of
[24:23] God
[24:24] so decorating a tree making it look
[24:26] bright and shiny and lavish to me that
[24:29] doesn't relate to the humble birth of
[24:30] our Lord Jesus Christ so that's the
[24:32] fourth reason that I choose not to set
[24:34] up a Christmas tree at my house
[24:36] in closing
[24:38] friends I hope this video has been a
[24:40] blessing I just wanted to share this
[24:41] answer to the couple questions I've
[24:43] gotten about Christmas time and
[24:45] Christmas trees if you'd like further
[24:47] videos about this subject please reach
[24:48] out to me let me know
[24:50] this year among all the years I've been
[24:52] on YouTube has been the year where I've
[24:54] answered some of the most difficult
[24:55] maybe controversial questions and so I'm
[24:58] thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ for
[25:01] guiding us into all truth
[25:03] helping us to rightly divide the word of
[25:05] Truth as the scripture says we're to
[25:07] prove all things we're to be labors in
[25:10] the word of God
[25:11] and so I want to wish you a merry
[25:13] Christmas as brother Brandon wished his
[25:14] congregation a Merry Christmas
[25:17] and please make this a sacred time of
[25:19] the year I think it's especially
[25:20] important this year Christmas is on a
[25:22] Sunday so I look forward to coming to
[25:24] the house of God on Sunday not skipping
[25:26] Church coming to church worshiping our
[25:28] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ worshiping
[25:31] him for his birth his life his death his
[25:34] resurrection and now his Ascension and
[25:36] his sending of the Holy Ghost to
[25:37] Believers today
[25:39] please make it a sacred time we're going
[25:41] to have an extra church service also to
[25:44] commemorate Jesus's birth with extra
[25:46] singing testimonies extra preaching and
[25:49] of course give little gifts out to the
[25:50] children in memory of the greatest gift
[25:53] that God sent to mankind his son the
[25:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[25:57] so I want to say in the name of the Lord
[25:58] Jesus Christ We wish you a Merry
[26:00] Christmas and may God bless you in the
[26:02] upcoming new year 2023.
