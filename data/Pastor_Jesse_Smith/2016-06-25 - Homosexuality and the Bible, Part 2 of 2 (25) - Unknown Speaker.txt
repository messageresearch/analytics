TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the spirit of homosexuality the Bible teaches about the characteristics of the spirit of homosexuality through the word of God we can understand why God considers this sin an Abomination or disgusting thing and why he judged Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and Bre Brimstone for being so consumed with this lifestyle first this Spirit publicly declares its sin and is proud of it yet God detests this public Declaration of sin Isaiah 3:9 the show of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as Sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves second this Spirit was known to get aggressive and violent toward anyone who called their sin Wicked This was seen in lot's life from Genesis 19 lot called their lifestyle wickedness so they targeted their lust toward him and threatened him with violence Genesis 19 verse 9 now we will deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door third this Spirit of homosexuality rejects the perfect compliment mentary holy reproductive design of God the male and female design as the Bible says homosexuality is unnatural the Bible says homosexuality is a physical abuse upon the bodies of those who partake in it due to these three defiant ungodly characteristics the Bible said God gives unrepentant homosexuals over to a reprobate mind in Romans 1:28 a mindset that God totally Rejects and condemns for these did not want to retain the knowledge of God in their minds according to Romans 1:28 and instead Fill Their Minds with hatred toward the Bible and pleasure in Vile lusts the spreading and acceptance of homosexuality has allowed Satan to accomplish the construction of his own Eden here on Earth Satan's Eden which is the completely opposite State than God's original Garden of Eden in God's Garden of Eden his son and daughter Adam and Eve were to obey his word and fully trust in him and cling to one another man to woman through the perversion of vile lust Satan has formed the exact opposite atmosphere in the lives of Millions on this Earth a state where couples reject God's word and cling man to man or woman to woman rather than male to female proving it is Satan's [Music] Eden Jesus's Prophecy of the increase of homosexual uality most people are totally unaware that nearly 2,000 years ago Jesus Christ himself predicted the rise in the acceptance of homosexuality that we are seeing today in Luke 17: 24-36 Jesus gave a description of the conditions of the world at the time of the end when he the son of man would be revealed at his second coming Jesus said there would be dual conditions for a second coming days like the days of Noah the first condition and lot the second condition remember this prophecy was spoken by our Lord nearly 2,000 years ago and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed to begin with the days of Noah were described as having the following conditions which are easily seen taking place in today's world people unconcerned about God's Wrath expressing their continuation to eat drink and marry right up until the day the flood came sons of God or Believers that are men would marry unbelieving women the daughters of men men simply because they were fair or attractive and not because of the humble Godly character great wickedness was in the heart of nearly every person because all their thoughts were only evil continually the Earth was filled with violence next the days of lot were described as having the following conditions which are easily seen taking place in today's world people unconcerned about God's Wrath Express in their continuation to eat drink Buy sell plant and build right up until the day fire and brimstone destroy them due to the anger and wrath of God economic and agricultural prosperity in Sodom blinded them of their spiritual nakedness and moral bankruptcy the men were exceedingly Wicked before the Lord because of their Grievous sins with not even 10 righteous people in the entire city of Sodom a people that would not repent from their sin young and old people were given over to homosexuality which lot wickedness and God called abominable or disgusting the people of Sodom had gay pride they declared their sin publicly and did not hide it as seen through the frequent gay pride parades all over the world [Music] today homosexuality is wrong in the eyes of God and always has been although it may be accepted in the eyes of the United States Supreme Court based upon their decision to legalize gay marriage on Friday June 26 2015 since God is unchanging and judge Sodom and Gomorrah for their sexual sins God will judge the United States as well for their acceptance of these sexual sins if God does not judge the United States for the sin of homosexuality then he would have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to them for destroying them and not destroying the United States it seems the prophecy Jesus gave in Luke 17:24 to 36 is fulfilled the sins of Noah's day and lot's day are running rampant upon this Earth the Earth is right for judgment but before that Jesus Will Rapture his holy ghost filled bride off the Earth in closing although homosexuality is an abominable sin it is not the unforgivable sin that is blasphemy of the Holy Ghost or those who purposely call The Works of God the works of the devil but those who are trapped in the Sin of homosexuality still have hope through the blood of Jesus Christ if they genuinely repent of their lust and seek the washing regenerative powers of the Holy Spirit freedom from this lust has been accomplished before and is also being accomplished today through the power of God in the days of St Paul Christians in the Church of Corinth had once been addicted to the sin of homosexuality but through repentance and sanctification they were able to experience the complete cleansing of the Holy Ghost know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicate Hatters nor doubters nor adulterers nor feminite nor abusers of themselves with mankind which are homosexuals nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God we know that all of God's children who battle this sin will experience the same cleansing through the washing power of the Holy Ghost in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah there were only three groups of person could belong in the largest group was the multitudes in Sodom and Gomorrah that accepted the sin of homosexuality and did not speak against it this group suffered the wrath of God the second group was lot and his daughters who narrowly escaped the fire and brimstone of God's Wrath against the sin of homosexuality lot and his group had enough Bible sense to call homosexuality wickedness but still chose to closely associate and Surround themselves with people of this lifestyle in order to benefit financially the third and final group was Abraham and his family and servants this group never lived in Sodom but were totally separated from Sodom and all of its Financial benefits choosing instead to live according to all the word of God Abraham prayed for lot that he would be spared from the wrath of God so which group will will you be in today will you just go with the flow with the majority of society and happily accept the abomination of homosexuality or will you be in the group that has enough conviction to call homosexuality a sin and wickedness but still try to associate with the majority in order for financial benefits or will you separate yourself from all associations with the sin of homosexuality living a separated life from all traits of sin fully obeying the Bible and spend your time praying and interceding for God to save those who are entangled in the associations of homosexual groups we pray that you will choose to be Abraham's seed for we are Abraham's seed through faith in Christ Jesus and the receiving of the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit according to Galatians 3:14 26-29 that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith if you would like more Bible teaching about homosexuality and also prayer for deliverance from this temptation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
