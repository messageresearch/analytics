[0:02] but I mean the real True Believer is
[0:05] coming to that Battlefield and you
[0:07] better be versed to know what you're
[0:08] doing or you can take an evil spirit so
[0:11] easy and not know if it's contrary to
[0:13] this word don't believe it stay with
[0:15] that
[0:17] word greetings friends in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:22] purpose of this video is to show the
[0:24] dangers of leaving the Bible revelations
[0:27] that Jesus Christ revealed to his true
[0:30] Prophet The Late William brandham 1909
[0:34] to
[0:35] 1965 in summary the dangers of leaving
[0:39] these Bible revelations is losing the
[0:42] anointing of the Holy Ghost and being
[0:45] anointed or influenced or oppressed by
[0:48] evil spirits according to 1 Timothy 4:1
[0:52] 1st Samuel
[0:54] 1614 and 2 Peter
[0:56] 2:8 just to name a few hi friends I'm
[1:00] Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ
[1:02] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[1:06] defend the Bible revelations that Jesus
[1:08] Christ revealed to his true Prophet
[1:10] brother William brandham and also defend
[1:12] brother branham's Godly Christian
[1:14] character the Bible is very plain that
[1:17] if a person rejects the truth then they
[1:20] give heed which means to attach oneself
[1:23] hold or cleave to a thing in this case a
[1:27] false Doctrine reject ctors of the Bible
[1:31] revelations Jesus revealed to brother
[1:33] brandham attach themselves to lies or
[1:37] evil spirits that's what 1 Timothy 4:1
[1:40] says they give heed to seducing Spirits
[1:43] they attach themselves to seducing
[1:46] spirits that allow them to believe
[1:47] doctrines of devils giving heed means
[1:50] True Believers give heed to the truth
[1:53] which means they cast down lies
[1:55] according to 2 Corinthians 10:5 they
[1:58] cast down imaginations and any High
[2:01] thing that exalts itself against the
[2:02] knowledge of God so the opposite is true
[2:05] giving heed to lies is casting down the
[2:08] truth and of course this all takes place
[2:10] in the human Spirit or the mind as the
[2:13] Bible teaches there's three parts to man
[2:16] in 1 Thessalonians
[2:18] 5:23 I pray God your whole spirit and
[2:20] soul and body be preserved blameless
[2:22] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:24] so we see the three parts of man the
[2:26] spirit the human Spirit the human mind
[2:29] the soul and the
[2:32] body so true worshippers get the
[2:34] anointing of the holy spirit in their
[2:37] spirits and Minds when they accept true
[2:39] Doctrine and of course when they're born
[2:41] again they get the Holy Ghost the Seal
[2:42] of the Holy Ghost in their soul but
[2:44] people who leave the true bible message
[2:47] they get evil spirits anointing their
[2:49] human mind or their human Spirit friends
[2:52] each generation has a chance to hear
[2:54] God's message for their time period or
[2:56] age this is easily seen in judges 2
[2:59] verse 10 the Bible said all that
[3:02] generation were gathered unto their
[3:04] fathers and There Rose another
[3:06] generation after them which knew not the
[3:08] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[3:10] for Israel since the beginning of time
[3:13] God has always had a message on the
[3:15] earth that led Believers to repentance
[3:17] and salvation by his grace for all those
[3:20] who would believe this was true in
[3:22] Noah's day Moses's day John the
[3:24] Baptist's day the Lord Jesus's Day St
[3:27] Paul's day Martin Luther's day joh
[3:29] Wesley's day and brother bram's day and
[3:32] brother bram's message continues to this
[3:34] day here
[3:36] 2024 I felt led to share this historical
[3:38] fact about Martin Luther I found this
[3:40] quote from a book by Edmond Broadbent
[3:44] from 1935 called the pilgrim church and
[3:47] Broadbent wrote that Luther said not a
[3:50] tenth part of his converts remained
[3:52] steadfast in the faith and Luther felt
[3:56] quote we are almost utter Heathen with
[3:58] the name of Christian and quote so I
[4:00] just read this quote to show that Martin
[4:02] Luther saw a great Falling Away during
[4:05] the message of his hour which was
[4:06] justification by faith the Believers had
[4:08] to come out of Roman Catholicism and a
[4:11] works-based
[4:12] Salvation so if one Church age messenger
[4:15] Martin Luther saw less than one/ tenth
[4:17] of his converts remain should we be
[4:20] surprised today to see so many people
[4:22] who at one time claimed to believe the
[4:24] message of the hour fall away from the
[4:26] Bible faith God gave us through the
[4:29] seventh Church age messenger brother
[4:31] branham's Ministry so of course we're
[4:33] not surprised by all this falling away
[4:36] the Bible of course predicted this great
[4:37] falling away in the last days of the
[4:40] last 2,000 years during the times of the
[4:42] Gentiles found in Luke
[4:45] 21:24 Paul told about this in at least
[4:47] three scriptures 2 Thessalonians 2:3 he
[4:51] said there must come a falling away
[4:53] first he said it in 2 Timothy 3 1-5 in
[4:57] the last days perilous times shall come
[4:59] and then as I mentioned he said it in 1
[5:01] Timothy 4 1-3 in the latter times some
[5:04] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[5:06] to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[5:08] devils two recent major Falling Away
[5:11] movements Who Fallen away from the Bible
[5:14] revelations God gave to brother brandham
[5:15] began in 2012 and 2015 and both
[5:20] movements continued to this day 2012 saw
[5:24] the rise of anti brother brandham
[5:26] websites these websites miserably fail
[5:29] by making hundreds if not more
[5:32] slanderous false conclusions about
[5:35] brother brandham while they leave the
[5:37] Bible revelations Jesus revealed to
[5:39] brother brandham 2015 saw the rise of
[5:42] the tape worship movement this is the
[5:45] Press Play obey movement it's a falling
[5:47] away from the Bible truths Jesus
[5:49] revealed to brother brandom this
[5:52] movement miserably fails by idolizing
[5:54] brother brandham idolizing his tapes
[5:57] lazily staying at home every Sunday
[6:00] they condemn Jesus's true fful Ministry
[6:02] and of course they ignore the Bible
[6:05] brother brandom's absolute now regarding
[6:08] the anti- brother random websites and
[6:10] their movement and all those that follow
[6:12] them I want to say that some of these
[6:14] individuals left message churches that
[6:16] were sinful and I want to say plainly
[6:19] that I support any honest person leaving
[6:22] a sinful message church if God reveals
[6:25] to that person that the sinful Message
[6:27] Church will never repent knowing should
[6:29] ever stay in a church that's filled with
[6:31] false doctrines it's my humble belief
[6:33] that the Lord raises up Godly Man all
[6:36] over the world so that people can leave
[6:39] false churches and go to True Churches
[6:41] according to 1 Corinthians 3:5 Paul said
[6:44] who then is Paul and who is Apollos but
[6:46] ministers by whom he believed even as
[6:49] the lord gave to every man so it seems
[6:52] here that this scripture along with
[6:53] other scriptures about God will not
[6:55] leave himself without a witness that
[6:57] anyone who leaves a false Church God
[6:59] will raise them up a faithful church for
[7:02] them to attend if they can believe wait
[7:04] on the Lord and trust in God because
[7:07] Paul said gave to every man it's my
[7:10] belief that many of these anti- brother
[7:13] random people have done horribly wrong
[7:15] by attacking brother brandham as they
[7:17] have never truly sought the Bible to
[7:20] understand the Bible revelations that
[7:23] God showed brother brandham what these
[7:25] anti brother brandham websites have done
[7:28] is got the people's eyes off the Bible
[7:30] and got it on brother bram's life or
[7:33] people around brother brandham and
[7:34] that's what Satan always does he gets
[7:36] people's eyes off the word of God and
[7:38] onto something else so the best case
[7:40] scenario would have been for these
[7:42] people who left these sinful message
[7:43] churches to try to find Holy Ghost fill
[7:46] message churches or find the best
[7:49] churches that were giving out the most
[7:51] truth in their area and then pray for
[7:53] God to raise up a holy ghost filled
[7:55] Message Church in their area I've also
[7:58] observed that many of these people who
[8:00] have left the message have been hurt by
[8:03] the people that were in the message
[8:05] churches that they left and therefore
[8:07] they've developed complexes towards the
[8:09] message churches they've left and now
[8:11] they have complexes towards brother
[8:13] brandham and they're using the hurt of
[8:15] those complexes to attack brother
[8:16] brandham unfairly and attack message
[8:19] churches many times unfairly but again
[8:22] I'm sure there are mistakes some of the
[8:25] message churches have made no doubt
[8:27] about that and friends it's possible
[8:29] time goes on we're going to see more
[8:30] message churches fall into sin because
[8:33] the Bible said there must come a falling
[8:34] away but this would only prove that
[8:36] these message churches never had the
[8:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost because the
[8:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost will produce a
[8:42] Bible loving character a sin hating
[8:46] character A Love For Truth the Holy
[8:48] Ghost will guide us into all truth
[8:50] according to John 16:13 and so those of
[8:53] us who believe we have the baptism of
[8:55] the Holy Ghost let us make our calling
[8:57] and election sure as the scripture says
[8:59] says before moving on I do want to say I
[9:02] believe it's Godly and wholesome and
[9:04] good to have honest questions about the
[9:06] Bible questions about God and questions
[9:09] about brother brandham and the church
[9:10] age Messengers The Bible says God is the
[9:13] dissolver of doubts God knows we're
[9:15] going to have doubts God is Not Afraid
[9:17] of our questions God is our loving
[9:19] heavenly father he promised to give us
[9:22] wisdom liberally if we would simply ask
[9:23] him according to James 1: 5-7 the Bible
[9:27] commands us to prove all things 1
[9:29] Thessalonians 5:22 try every Spirit 1
[9:32] John 4:1 and be always ready to give an
[9:35] answer for the hope that's within us 1
[9:37] Peter 3:15 as Christians we should
[9:40] search the Scriptures Daily in order to
[9:42] prove the truth of God and His prophets
[9:44] like the bereans did who searched the
[9:46] scripture to prove Paul was right in
[9:48] Acts 17
[9:51] 10-12 now let's get into the danger of
[9:53] leaving the message God gave to William
[9:56] brandham so the danger of leaving is
[9:59] losing the holy anointing of the holy
[10:02] spirit because you believe the truth
[10:05] when a person rejects true Doctrine they
[10:08] take on evil spirits we see this truth
[10:11] in 1 Timothy 4:1 giving heed to seducing
[10:14] spirits and doctrines of devils so those
[10:18] who left the truth they attached
[10:20] themselves or they held on to false
[10:22] doctrines which were evil seducing
[10:25] Spirits 1 Samuel 16:14 said the spirit
[10:28] of the Lord depart from Saul and an evil
[10:30] spirit from the Lord troubled him that's
[10:32] what I believe has happened to these
[10:34] anti- brother brandom website people the
[10:37] spirit of God departed from them and
[10:39] they have an evil spirit that's
[10:41] troubling them and also these anti-
[10:44] brother Brandon people I'll just call
[10:46] them believe the slander people and I
[10:49] don't say that in a mocking way but I
[10:51] believe that's what they truly are
[10:52] they're believing the slander about
[10:54] brother brandham this group that has
[10:56] left the message I believe are vexed by
[10:59] all that they see and hear all they do
[11:01] is see and hear lies and slander about
[11:03] brother brandham and that vexes their
[11:05] human Spirits it troubles their human
[11:07] Spirits so all they can do is lash out
[11:10] against brother brandham and those who
[11:13] believe brother brandham was a true
[11:14] Prophet they have no love for them they
[11:16] don't pray for them they have very
[11:18] little respect for them and these are
[11:20] the type of people I've interacted with
[11:22] many times online other Bible verses
[11:25] that talk about this are 2 Thessalonians
[11:28] 210 through 14 because they receive not
[11:31] the love of the truth the Bible says God
[11:34] shall send them strong delusion that
[11:35] they should believe a lie the danger of
[11:38] leaving the message is believing a lie
[11:40] instead of the truth but thankfully the
[11:43] Bible says we were chosen to Salvation
[11:45] through sanctification of the spirit and
[11:47] belief of the truth True Believers of
[11:49] the Bible revelations of the message are
[11:51] being Sanctified and cleaned out because
[11:54] we believe the truth of the Bible that
[11:56] brother Ram taught us those that have
[11:58] left the message many of them are living
[12:00] a more worldly sinful life they're not
[12:03] being Sanctified by the Holy Spirit and
[12:05] they're not believing true Doctrine
[12:08] Romans 1:28 speaks of them as well they
[12:10] did not like to retain God in their
[12:12] knowledge so God gave them over to a
[12:15] reprobate mind many people that leave
[12:17] the message reject the Bible reject the
[12:19] Bible truths and so God has to give them
[12:21] over to rejected mind these false
[12:24] teachers who leave the message do two
[12:27] things wrong they first add to the Bible
[12:30] and second they often take away from the
[12:32] Bible there are grave consequences to
[12:34] doing both as Proverbs 35 and 6
[12:37] Revelation 22:18-19 warn us before
[12:41] getting into a few examples here let me
[12:43] read 2 Chronicles 36 verse 16 but they
[12:48] mocked The Messengers of God and
[12:50] despised his words and misused His
[12:52] prophets until the Wrath of the Lord
[12:54] arose against his people till there was
[12:57] no remedy this verse shows Israel mocked
[13:00] the prophets God sent them they despised
[13:03] the prophets God sent them and they
[13:05] misused the prophets this is exactly
[13:08] what people are doing today who have
[13:10] left the message that God revealed to
[13:12] brother brandom these men and women on
[13:15] these anti- msage websites and podcasts
[13:18] they mock brother brandham they despise
[13:20] brother brandom and they misuse brother
[13:23] brandom and they do all of this while
[13:25] they ignore the Bible truth faith
[13:29] message preachers are preaching I'm just
[13:30] one of them they mock brother brandom as
[13:33] they do fake research and ignore the
[13:36] true research that validates brother
[13:38] brandom as a genuine prophet of God they
[13:41] mock brother brandom as they go into
[13:43] sexual perversion such as non-binary
[13:46] relationships adulteries fornications
[13:49] and more they mock brother brandom as
[13:51] they accept women preachers which Paul
[13:54] said should not be done and those are
[13:56] just a few examples so the first first
[13:59] example of a false Doctrine these people
[14:01] have accepted is the false Trinity
[14:04] Dogma message Believers know the Trinity
[14:07] Doctrine is false it's of the devil
[14:10] because it adds to the word of God the
[14:12] Bible never calls God three persons but
[14:15] trinitarians freely add that language to
[14:17] the Bible and that's a sin so these
[14:20] anti- message people that now believe in
[14:21] the Trinity they have at least the
[14:24] anointing of three evil spirits perhaps
[14:26] more and there could be some overlap but
[14:29] they're Anointed with the spirit of er
[14:31] they're Anointed with a lying Spirit and
[14:34] the spirit of
[14:36] idolatry and all these are found in 1
[14:38] John 46 Proverbs 35 and 6 and exodus
[14:42] 20:3 they have the spirit of air because
[14:45] the spirit of Truth never calls God
[14:47] three persons so they have the spirit of
[14:49] air claiming God is three persons even
[14:52] though his word never says
[14:54] that they have a lying Spirit according
[14:57] to proverbs 35:6
[14:59] because God said anyone who adds to his
[15:01] words will be called a liar they're
[15:03] lying calling God something that he is
[15:06] not and thirdly they are idolators
[15:09] because they break the first commandment
[15:10] in Exodus 20:3 Thou shalt have no other
[15:13] gods before me and trinitarians place
[15:16] two other persons next to God the
[15:19] father yet the book of Isaiah says God
[15:22] is only one God and there's no others
[15:24] beside him so making three deities three
[15:27] co-equal persons is
[15:29] idolatry the second example is immodest
[15:32] clothing most of the people that leave
[15:34] the message wear immodest clothing they
[15:37] forsake the Holiness standard of modest
[15:40] clothing that the Bible teaches in 1
[15:42] Timothy 2:9 and of course other
[15:44] scriptures so the message rejectors who
[15:48] wear immodest clothing are anointed
[15:50] again with at least three evil spirits
[15:52] the spirit of air the spirit of
[15:54] whoredoms and possibly a lying Spirit if
[15:57] they know the scriptures that teach
[15:59] modest clothing one former message
[16:02] preacher who now attacks brother brandom
[16:04] said there is no modesty standards in
[16:06] the Bible that's a lie either through
[16:09] ignorance or a purposeful lie in 2019 I
[16:13] wrote an entire book showing the Bible
[16:15] standards for a modest outward
[16:17] appearance and of course this man and
[16:20] his fellow message rejectors will never
[16:22] read any of my books even though I
[16:23] offered to some of them for free to give
[16:26] them my books they don't want to know
[16:28] the truth so all we can do is pray for
[16:30] their souls pray for their repentance so
[16:33] they have the spirit of air because
[16:34] they're LED away from the truth of 1
[16:37] Timothy 2:9 about modest clothing they
[16:40] have the spirit of hordon because they
[16:41] likely enjoy seeing women take off most
[16:45] of their clothes and show their immodest
[16:47] flesh in order to tempt men in many
[16:50] cases and of course they have a lying
[16:52] spirit because they know the Bible says
[16:54] modest clothing yet they still say the
[16:57] Bible has no dress code and the dress
[17:00] code is easily found in the four areas I
[17:02] taught in my book we must cover all
[17:04] nakedness Genesis 3:21 1 Timothy 2:9 we
[17:08] must wear thick or layered clothing
[17:10] Matthew 540 John 21:7 we must have
[17:14] gender specific clothing according to
[17:15] Deuteronomy 225 Hebrews 4:15 and loose
[17:19] clothing according to Revelation 7:14
[17:22] proverbs 7: 10 just to name a few third
[17:26] and final example for part one of this
[17:28] series is women
[17:30] preachers anti- message people believe
[17:33] women are called to preach and if they
[17:35] believe this they're Anointed with at
[17:37] least two evil spirits first the spirit
[17:39] of air and second The Jezebel spirit
[17:43] this is found in 1 John 4:6 Isaiah 3:12
[17:48] Revelation 2:20 it is the spirit of air
[17:51] to allow women to preach because Paul
[17:53] said women were not allowed to preach in
[17:56] 1 Timothy chap 2 vers 11 down to 15 you
[17:59] get Paul's full reasoning why women are
[18:02] not allowed to preach when Israel was in
[18:04] a backsliding state the women ruled over
[18:07] them that's Isaiah
[18:09] 3:12 the Bible said these women cause
[18:12] them to he and so a woman preacher will
[18:15] always do that because it's against the
[18:17] word of God and then they also have the
[18:20] Jezebel spirit found in Revelation 2:20
[18:24] they suffer that woman Jezebel to teach
[18:26] and seduce my servants to commit
[18:28] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[18:31] unto
[18:32] Idols of course the Jezebel spirit is a
[18:35] dominating female spirit it's an evil
[18:37] spirit that causes the leaders to submit
[18:40] themselves to people they should not
[18:42] submit to it's a spirit of submission
[18:44] that comes upon the men and they get out
[18:47] of position they get out of God's order
[18:49] that he set forth in 1 Corinthians 11: 1
[18:52] 2 and three the order is God is over
[18:56] Christ Christ is over man man is over
[18:58] the
[19:00] woman in
[19:02] closing friends I hope this video was a
[19:04] blessing by the grace of God I've been
[19:06] wanting to do this video for numerous
[19:08] years now at least two years and so this
[19:10] will likely be a part one Lord willing
[19:12] I'll do a part two later by the grace of
[19:14] God but I want to get this video Out
[19:16] friends as time goes on we see more and
[19:18] more vindications that brother brandham
[19:20] was a genuine prophet of God we're so
[19:22] thankful for the Bible revelations that
[19:24] brother Brandon preached to us and
[19:26] friends the more interactions I have
[19:28] with those people that are against
[19:29] brother brandom the more I can see these
[19:31] evil spirits on their lives in fact in
[19:34] my 10 years on YouTube the two groups
[19:36] that have been the most heinous towards
[19:38] me or aggressive or angry are the tape
[19:42] worshipper group The Press Play and Obey
[19:44] group they've been the harshest to me
[19:46] then the other group is this anti-
[19:48] message group The believe the slander
[19:50] group most of these people are just
[19:53] paring the weak incomplete so-called
[19:57] research of the the leaders of this
[19:59] movement most of them don't even know
[20:01] that on the first seal itself there was
[20:03] a 2,000-year difference between brother
[20:05] brandom's teaching on the first seal and
[20:07] Clarence lens teaching on the first seal
[20:10] they haven't even done that research
[20:12] they're just angry parents so let's pray
[20:14] for brother R's accusers and the tape
[20:16] worshippers that they'll
[20:18] repent Heavenly Father God again today I
[20:21] ask Lord that you have mercy on the tape

[20:28] falling away but Lord I pray Lord all
[20:30] those that will be saved Lord will come

[20:35] faithful message preachers to guide
[20:37] these people back to truth to get the
[20:39] right anointing on them the holy
[20:41] anointing on them and that they'll
[20:43] forsake the seducing spirits and
[20:46] doctrines of devils and they'll come
[20:47] back to the Bible truth all these Bible
[20:50] truths you revealed to your Prophet
