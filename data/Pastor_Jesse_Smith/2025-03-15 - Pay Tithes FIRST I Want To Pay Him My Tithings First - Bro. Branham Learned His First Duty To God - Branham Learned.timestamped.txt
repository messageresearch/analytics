[0:02] I just become a Christian I said first
[0:04] thing Mr Mason as my duty to God I my ti
[0:08] I want to pay my tiing
[0:10] first greetings friends in the matchless
[0:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:15] purpose of this video is to look at this
[0:16] wonderful quotation from God's Prophet
[0:18] brother William brandham this week I was
[0:21] studying on finances someone in the
[0:24] church had asked me about it and I came
[0:25] across this quote and it was just a
[0:27] refreshment to go over this again the
[0:29] quotes from Christ is revealed in his
[0:31] own word August 22nd 1965 the morning
[0:34] service brother Braham said I want to
[0:36] pay him my tithings first so A beautiful
[0:40] story here brother brandham as a young
[0:42] man right after he gave his heart to God
[0:44] he learned that his first duty to God
[0:47] was to pay his ties to God first we see
[0:49] this principle in Proverbs 3:9 honor the
[0:52] Lord with thy substance and with the
[0:53] first fruits of all thine increase so we
[0:57] see this principle give to God first as
[1:00] Jesus said in Matthew 6:33 seek ye first
[1:02] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:04] and all these other things will be added
[1:06] unto you also Matthew 621 Jesus said for
[1:09] where your treasure is there will your
[1:11] heart be also so I love the story
[1:13] brother R just got saved so his treasur
[1:16] is in heaven the word of God is his
[1:18] treasure and even as a young Christian
[1:20] he had learned that with all the money I
[1:23] make I'm going to honor God with all the
[1:26] blessings he bestows upon me I'm going
[1:28] to honor God first by paying my ties
[1:31] although he had a lot of money in
[1:32] medical debts he was able to honor God
[1:35] with his ties first and then eventually
[1:37] God poured out blessings upon him the
[1:39] windows of Heaven were open and he was
[1:41] able to pay off all of his medical debts
[1:42] by the grace of God so I have a couple
[1:44] videos on Bible teaching on paying ties
[1:47] if you'd like to watch that I'll put a
[1:49] link to those in the description it's
[1:51] taught in 1 Corinthians chapter 9 Paul
[1:54] said also in the New Testament the Lord
[1:56] has ordained them which preach the
[1:58] gospel to live of the Gospel so tithing
[2:00] is also a new testament teaching and the
[2:03] Revelation is that tithing is before the
[2:05] Old Testament under Abraham Jacob both
[2:09] men tithe even before the law came under
[2:11] Moses so there was tithing before the
[2:13] law there was tithing in the law and
[2:15] there's tithing in the New Testament we
[2:18] also see a form of tithing in the future
[2:20] home because in Revelation
[2:23] 21:4 the Bible said the kings of the
[2:25] earth do bring their Glory and Honor
[2:28] into it and brother brandom said these
[2:30] were the kings of the earth bringing
[2:31] their tithes and offerings into the
[2:32] future home so brother ram calls them
[2:35] Eternal tithes oh oh if we could had
[2:37] time to take that I got for the book
[2:39] over there over in Revelation all the
[2:41] kings of the earth bring their honor
[2:42] into it that's like a and type the tribe
[2:44] of Levi all the rest of them pay TI to
[2:46] see from one new moon to another one
[2:48] Sabbath to another one up to worship
[2:50] what a day that'll be all
[2:52] right the day they're trying to take the
[2:55] place of God's tiing they're trying to
[2:58] adopt something they're trying to to
[2:59] make it differ they go down and have
[3:02] bunk games in the churches play Lottery
[3:06] lottery will never take the place of
[3:08] God's
[3:09] Tiding
[3:11] suffering Brank excelling pic to raise
[3:16] money to pay different debts off it'll
[3:18] never take the place of God's Eternal
[3:21] child in the offering it'll never do it
[3:24] but yet we're trying to do it what is it
[3:26] it's enticing
[3:28] spirit coming down trying to sub
[3:31] substitute something for the word of God
[3:34] so I just thought I'd make this quick
[3:35] video here as a reminder about the
[3:37] importance of putting God first in
[3:40] finances because you realize all your
[3:42] finances your good health your good job
[3:44] all these things come from above they
[3:46] come from the Lord Jesus Christ and this
[3:48] was such a refreshing quote for me to
[3:49] hear this week by God's grace so so
[3:52] let's listen to the quote from Christ is
[3:53] revealed in his own
[3:55] word now I see laying here there's been
[3:58] many requests this last week on what I
[4:01] said uh last Sunday on the message I
[4:05] believe I forget what I titled it now
[4:08] but uh I said something about paying
[4:11] your
[4:12] debts and you know no matter what you
[4:15] say it's misunderstood by many not
[4:18] because they they don't want to
[4:20] misunderstand it but you just simply
[4:22] misunderstand it and now someone said
[4:25] should we buy a car or what should I
[4:28] that that isn't what Jesus spoke of or
[4:30] the Bible there that said oh no man
[4:33] nothing that's lingering debts that you
[4:36] could pay pay them it don't that's owing
[4:40] no man nothing it doesn't mean my we owe
[4:42] a rent or telephone bill we and what
[4:44] more we we owe those things and we pay
[4:47] them but an old lingering debt that you
[4:49] could be paying on pay it off see uh
[4:52] don't go with anything hanging on you
[4:55] like that I remember a time when I was
[4:58] sick once when I was a boy I come out of
[5:00] the hospital owing about $2,000 and used
[5:03] to be a drugstore here Mr swaner I owed
[5:06] him about3 or $400 of medicine Bill he
[5:08] didn't even know me and a man I went to
[5:10] him I didn't know him and he just s up
[5:13] there anyhow never refused to send it
[5:15] and I said I owe you and I said uh I
[5:18] believe swaner it was Mr
[5:20] Mason down Court Avenue in Spring I said
[5:23] I owe you and I'm I'm just still awfully
[5:26] weak but I'm trying to go to work now if
[5:28] I can't pay you I just become a
[5:30] Christian I said first thing Mr Mason as
[5:33] my duty to God I owe him my tithe I want
[5:35] to pay him my tithings first and I said
[5:38] then my next duty is pay my debts I said
[5:41] my father's sickly and he and we got
[5:44] these 10 of us children in the family
[5:46] but I said I if I can't pay you more
[5:48] than 25 cents on that bill each payday
[5:51] if I can't pay you even the 25 cents
[5:53] I'll come by and tell you about it I'll
[5:55] tell you I I I can't do it this time I
[5:58] by the help of God I pay paid every bit
[6:00] off see but that's what I mean see just
[6:02] don't somebody say oh some Christian
[6:05] here at the church one time went out and
[6:06] got some work done on a car here and the
[6:09] man come down the man said I'll pay you
[6:12] I get paid Saturday or something other
[6:14] and he never paid even weeks after weeks
[6:15] Roll by never paid him never said a word
[6:18] and the man come to ask me he said see
[6:20] it reflects against the church it
[6:22] reflects against Christ you can't pay
[6:24] him go tell them say I owe you and I'm
[6:25] going to pay you I'm a Christian but I I
[6:27] just I can't do it right now I've got I
[6:29] owe this and remember it's on God's
[6:32] books too you know as you do so that's
[6:34] I'm trying to for myself and for all of
[6:38] us together try to be ready for we know
[6:40] we're getting near something very near
[6:44] something's going to take place so we
[6:46] want to be ready when the coming of the
[6:49] Lord is drawing so nigh now we want to
[6:51] be ready for that great hour what a
[6:53] blessing to hear God's Prophet testify
[6:56] about the faithfulness of God of course
[6:58] the blessing is talking about is in
[7:00] Malachi 3:10 bring ye all the ties into
[7:02] the storehouse that there may be meat in
[7:03] mine house and prove me now herewith
[7:06] sayith the Lord of hosts if I will not
[7:08] open you the windows of heaven and pour
[7:11] you out a blessing that there shall not
[7:13] be room enough to receive it and again
[7:15] there's so many scriptures on the
[7:16] importance of tithes and offerings so
[7:18] again I'll leave a link to that video in
[7:20] the description by the grace of God
[7:22] friends let's always put God first three
[7:24] times God said I am the first and the
[7:26] last Isaiah 44:6
[7:29] thus sayith the Lord the king of Israel
[7:31] and his Redeemer the Lord of hosts I am
[7:33] the first and I am the last and beside
[7:34] me there is no God Isaiah 4812 hearken
[7:38] unto me oh Jacob and Israel my called I
[7:40] am he I am the first and I am also the
[7:43] last and Revelation 1:7 and when I saw
[7:46] him I fell at his feet as dead and he
[7:48] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[7:50] me fear not I am the first and the last
[7:54] since Jesus Christ is the first and the
[7:56] last let's put him first in everything
[7:58] Prayer by Bible study finances worship
[8:02] everything we do let's put him first
[8:03] he's worthy of being first in everything
[8:06] of course I think this topic is
[8:07] especially important for brothers in the
[8:09] church leaders in the church the men
[8:12] that God has placed in leadership in
[8:13] families and in the church I've seen so
[8:16] many examples where men did not put God
[8:18] first in finances but God is rich in
[8:21] Mercy and God will teach his children to
[8:23] put him first by the grace of God and
[8:26] all those that do will see the same
[8:28] Windows of Heaven open as brother random
[8:30] saw as I've seen as no doubt many
[8:33] Christians have seen by the promise of
[8:35] almighty God because Jesus Christ is the
[8:36] same yesterday today and forever
[8:38] according to Hebrews
[8:40] 13:8 if you have any questions concerns
[8:43] or testimonies about this video please
[8:45] contact
[8:47] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[8:50] the desire of your heart
