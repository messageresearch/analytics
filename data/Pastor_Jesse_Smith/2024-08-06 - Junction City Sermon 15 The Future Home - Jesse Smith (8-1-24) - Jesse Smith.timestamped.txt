[3:41] God okay now I got uh a lot of notes and
[3:44] uh we'll just try to go here as as good
[3:46] as we can by God's grace um so brother R
[3:50] when he preaches it if you want a full
[3:53] kind of lesson on it these are the of
[3:55] course these are the scriptures brother
[3:56] RAM used there's a lot of them in there
[3:58] uh 2 Peter 3 brother man deals with that
[4:01] he reads the whole chapter uh when he
[4:03] starts the sermon that's why it's three
[4:04] and a half hours amen which is great
[4:07] it's just a phenomenal sermon uh if you
[4:09] haven't listened to it you need to do it
[4:11] by God's grace make time for it
[4:13] Hallelujah um brother R said this was an
[4:15] important blessed subject uh brother
[4:18] random said I very important subject
[4:20] it's a very blessful one and I'm going
[4:22] to skip down here he says uh where
[4:25] they're going to live so this is about
[4:27] where we're going to live but remember
[4:29] this is is not the Millennium this is
[4:31] after the Millennium okay I preached on
[4:33] the Millennium a few weeks ago uh when
[4:35] we were here well by now it must have
[4:37] been a month ago by now so sorry I'm not
[4:39] really good on time I'm awful
[4:41] exaggerating I'm awful I'm awful at
[4:43] remembering details my wife has to tell
[4:45] me after service Jesse you said that
[4:47] wrong I'm like oh that's right sorry hun
[4:48] thank you sweetie I've always got to
[4:50] make it right because I just can't
[4:51] remember all the details as long as I
[4:53] can remember that Jesus Loves Me amen
[4:56] that's the most important by God's grace
[4:58] and brother r remember he just preached
[5:00] the highlights but man said I suppose if
[5:03] I would take my time it would take me
[5:05] weeks to preach this he says I wrote
[5:08] down some scriptures some notes just to
[5:09] hit the highlights to where it'll let
[5:12] you
[5:13] study so this is a job Church you got to
[5:16] go study this too I have I I preached
[5:18] this in 2016 and I just studied or
[5:20] listen to it again today eight years
[5:22] later and it sounds like a brand new
[5:24] sermon so you need to listen to it if
[5:26] you haven't by God's grace you'll be so
[5:28] blessed
[5:29] brother brandham uh this this sermon so
[5:32] impacted brother brandham he would think
[5:33] about it for weeks at a time have ever
[5:35] had that where you've been in a service
[5:37] and you just you can't forget about it
[5:39] it was just like wow that time was
[5:40] awesome wow that was awesome that's how
[5:42] I'm feeling about those Iowa Services
[5:44] amen right just wow God moved and God
[5:46] brought God did so much that's what this
[5:49] sermon did to brother brandham two weeks
[5:51] later he was still talking about it uh
[5:54] he said last week I'm sorry last Sunday
[5:56] a week ago I spoke on the subject the
[5:58] future home I'm going to skip down down
[5:59] here I've been feasting on that ever
[6:01] since knowing that when this life is
[6:03] over I'm going to that City I'm Bound
[6:06] for that City and nothing else matters
[6:09] hallelujah amen church when you love
[6:11] Jesus Christ you really know nothing
[6:13] else matters other than pleasing Jesus
[6:15] Christ Hallelujah you want to do your
[6:17] best uh to please the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:20] we're not saved by works but the Bible
[6:22] says when you get saved then you want to
[6:24] be zealous for good works then because
[6:26] of your love brother said because of
[6:28] your appreciation you want to show oh
[6:29] God how much you appreciate he saved you
[6:31] by doing something for him hallelujah oh
[6:34] I love
[6:35] it but R said by the way he said I got
[6:37] so many letters on the future home that
[6:40] sure hit home somewhere there's a lot of
[6:42] them it did me too I've never gotten
[6:44] over it so two weeks afterwards he's
[6:46] like wow I never got over that sermon
[6:48] may God give you a sermon where you
[6:50] can't get over it I'll say like this you
[6:51] can't get over it but it gets inside of
[6:54] you amen may God give you a sermon that
[6:57] gets inside of you Hallelujah what am I
[6:59] what am I talking about the Holy Spirit
[7:01] getting inside of you and it so impacts
[7:03] you you can't get away from it praise
[7:05] God Amen so then brother B begins
[7:08] teaching on this subject and brother R
[7:10] pulls from The Book of Revelation 21 he
[7:13] says John tells about the new Earth but
[7:15] Peter explains how it comes
[7:18] about
[7:20] okay so John brother man said re
[7:23] basically Revelation 21 uh doesn't
[7:26] explain how we get the new city but
[7:29] Peter explains how we get it all right
[7:32] because John just said I saw a new
[7:34] Heavens A New Earth the first Heaven the
[7:35] first Earth passed away there was no
[7:37] more see that's what we read I'm going
[7:39] to skip down here but we turn back to
[7:41] the second Peter now to find out Peter
[7:43] explains how this process will come
[7:46] about
[7:48] okay so in second Peter chapter 3 Peter
[7:52] describes three different conditions of
[7:54] the world what the world was in like in
[7:56] the past what the world's like now and
[7:59] what the world will be like in the
[8:01] future and I have all the verses up here
[8:02] I don't you know I don't have time to
[8:03] have you guys read your your Bibles
[8:05] tonight usually I do but I don't have
[8:07] time for that tonight just have to bear
[8:09] with me by God's grace 2 Peter 35 and 6
[8:12] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[8:14] that by the word of God the heavens were
[8:16] of old and the Earth standing out of the
[8:18] water and in the water whereby the world
[8:21] that then was being overflow with water
[8:23] perished so this is speaking of the
[8:25] flood of Noah remember Before the Flood
[8:28] there was water inside the Earth and
[8:29] there was water above the Earth remember
[8:31] that that's where the rain came from
[8:33] there was a layer of ice or some type of
[8:35] water out you know above the atmospheres
[8:38] of the Earth but God brought that down
[8:40] and the Bible said the Springs broke
[8:42] open so Peter says this is the process
[8:46] the earth goes through the Earth had to
[8:47] go through a flood first all right
[8:50] that's how the world was but now but the
[8:53] heavens and the Earth which are now by
[8:55] the same word are kept in store reserved
[8:58] unto fire against the day of judgment
[9:01] and predition of Godly men so in the
[9:03] same chapter Peter talks about how the
[9:05] world was how the world is now and then
[9:07] he's going to talk about how the world
[9:08] will be in the future verse 13
[9:12] nevertheless we according to his promise
[9:14] look for a new heavens and a new Earth
[9:17] wherein dwelleth righteousness how many
[9:19] are looking for that new world I'm
[9:21] looking for a new world where there's no
[9:23] more
[9:23] transn where there's no more
[9:25] homosexuality hallelujah amen that's the
[9:28] world I'm looking for where there's no
[9:29] more murders amen am that's the world
[9:31] I'm looking for and that's what Peter
[9:33] says that's what we're looking for
[9:34] Hallelujah a world where righteousness
[9:36] dwells there Hallelujah and Jesus will
[9:39] be the king of that world hallelujah
[9:41] amen now we know he rules the spiritual
[9:43] Kingdom now but he allows Satan to have
[9:45] rule the Bible calls it in 2 Corinthians
[9:48] chapter 4 the Bible calls Satan the God
[9:50] of this world so because because Satan
[9:53] deceived Eve and then Adam gave into sin
[9:56] they gave up their rights they they gave
[9:57] up their dominion over the Earth and now
[9:59] Satan has a sort of dominion over the
[10:01] Earth as long as God allows it how many
[10:04] know that remember the remember remember
[10:06] the story of Job Satan can only do what
[10:09] God allows how many remember that so
[10:11] whenever there's something evil God
[10:13] allowed it but remember God promised
[10:14] I'll make all things work together for
[10:16] good to them that love the Lord to them
[10:18] that are the called according to the
[10:20] purpose of almighty God
[10:23] hallelujah now brother Ram says uh yeah
[10:26] brother I'm just going to skip down here
[10:28] brother Ram says the old world that
[10:29] stood out the water that was before the
[10:30] flood Genesis 1:1 and now the world that
[10:33] is now present and then again he refers
[10:35] to another one the world that is to come
[10:37] the new world three worlds three stages
[10:40] of the
[10:42] world now I mentioned this when I
[10:44] preached on uh the three works of Grace
[10:47] last time I mentioned this the Earth is
[10:50] redeemed in three stages just like
[10:54] you okay so let's say the stages if you
[10:57] know what's the first stage justif ation
[11:00] that means god declares you righteous
[11:01] right you're forgiven what's the second
[11:03] stage sanctification that means to
[11:05] purify and set apart and what's the
[11:07] third stage the baptism of the Holy
[11:09] Ghost or the new birth or the filling of
[11:11] the Holy Ghost those are the three
[11:13] stages that God redeems a man or woman
[11:16] by praise God and brother brother R said
[11:19] brother R tells us from the Bible God
[11:21] does the same thing to the Earth God has
[11:23] to take the Earth through three stages
[11:25] of redemption just like the our bodies
[11:27] that come from the Earth
[11:29] Glory now brother Ram gets a lot of
[11:32] these teachings uh at least eight I
[11:34] counted eight brother Adam gets eight
[11:36] teachings from Clarence Lin Clarence Lin
[11:38] was a Baptist pastor in the late 1800s
[11:41] early 1900s he was a tremendous artist
[11:44] he was a real scholar of the Bible but
[11:47] he didn't have everything right okay um
[11:51] and brother Ram gets at least eight of
[11:52] his details from Lin to preach this but
[11:55] then God gave brother brandom this
[11:56] thought about three stages Clarence l
[11:59] didn't teach that Clarence Lin didn't
[12:02] realize uh the the water of Noah the
[12:05] blood of Jesus's cross and the fire to
[12:08] burn the outside of the earth
[12:09] represented justification sanctification
[12:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[12:14] get real deep and rich in the word of
[12:16] God here tonight so brother man said you
[12:18] better put on your anointing jacket
[12:20] everybody put on your anointing jacket
[12:22] you're G have to do that by God's grace
[12:23] brother R said if you want to catch the
[12:25] anointing Hallelujah no it's just it's a
[12:28] funny joke by God's grace
[12:30] he says now notice God makes plain to us
[12:32] his Plan of Redemption oh this just
[12:34] thrilled my soul brother R says when I
[12:36] saw it how he makes plain to us here now
[12:38] his Plan of
[12:41] Redemption he says what God has done to
[12:44] redeem his world he's done the same plan
[12:46] to redeem his people for the
[12:48] unchangeable god changes not in any of
[12:51] his plans or anything
[12:54] Hallelujah okay so God is unchanging
[12:57] whatever God does he have to continue
[12:59] you doing praise God
[13:02] hallelujah he says how he led us to
[13:04] himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three
[13:07] stages of Grace and he's just led the
[13:10] world in three stages to come to the
[13:12] world as God will come to the world
[13:14] after it's gone through the three
[13:15] different stages of purification that's
[13:17] exactly how he comes to us through three
[13:20] stages of Grace I've taught that at the
[13:22] beginning I've never changed since it's
[13:25] God's word okay so we know we know we
[13:28] have to be Justified then we have to be
[13:30] Sanctified then we have to get the
[13:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost we know that
[13:34] most churches don't know that most
[13:36] churches just say say a sinner's prayer
[13:38] and now you're saved and now you're
[13:39] filled with the Holy Ghost that's wrong
[13:42] that's only one step you have to go
[13:44] through three steps to be saved Jesus
[13:46] said I'm the way the truth and the life
[13:49] hallelujah amen hallelujah we'll get to
[13:51] all these
[13:53] examples he said notice how God makes it
[13:55] plain if that wasn't a great
[13:57] confirmation a loving blessing in from
[13:59] God when I see this and see that sense a
[14:02] boy first time Christ ever dealt with me
[14:05] I've still always taught those three
[14:07] stages of Grace that's why I preach the
[14:09] three works of Grace I think I was led
[14:11] by the Holy Spirit to do it because uh
[14:13] you have to know that in order to
[14:14] understand this all the way all right
[14:17] now that's from my old website
[14:19] uh but there's three three Works to
[14:22] redeem the Earth justification right the
[14:25] water in Noah's flood represents that
[14:27] sanctification the blood pour out at the
[14:29] side of of Jesus side uh when he
[14:32] crucified was crucified and then the
[14:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost the fire to
[14:36] cleanse the Earth after
[14:38] Armageddon okay so just like God Saves
[14:41] you with justification sanctification
[14:43] baptism Holy Ghost God redeems the Earth
[14:45] through the flood of Noah the blood that
[14:48] Jesus shed when they pierced him that
[14:50] was blood that was sanctification blood
[14:52] cleanses right there's no forgiveness
[14:54] without shed blood the Bible says that
[14:57] amen and then God's going to send fire
[14:59] on the earth just like he sent fire in
[15:00] your soul hallelujah amen that's why on
[15:03] the day of Pentecost they had fire above
[15:05] them Hallelujah because God had fully
[15:08] redeemed their being hallelujah oh my
[15:10] that's beautiful so there's three Works
[15:13] to redeem the Earth just like there's
[15:15] three uh steps God redeems a man or
[15:19] woman now remember Ezekiel for told this
[15:21] I'm sorry that's a picture Ezekiel
[15:24] Ezekiel 36 says God's going to give you
[15:26] a new heart a new spirit and my spirit
[15:29] amen
[15:31] okay and I just got to go fast through
[15:34] these Israel possessed the promised land
[15:36] they first left Egypt through the waters
[15:39] of the Red Sea see again water like the
[15:40] Noah's flood see the water they they
[15:43] were proved and tried in the wilderness
[15:44] for 40 years and then they passed over
[15:47] Jordan into their permanent dwelling
[15:51] right they they'd arrived right they
[15:53] they were they they crossed Jordan and
[15:55] now they're sealed into the land amen
[15:58] hallelujah
[15:59] even the life of Abraham has three
[16:02] stages he was called out of uh Chala out
[16:06] of er he was CAU out of that and that
[16:08] was represented when he got saved in
[16:10] Genesis 12 and then from Genesis 13- 16
[16:13] that's the time he got Sanctified and
[16:15] then Genesis 17 he got a token or he got
[16:17] a a permanent Mark right in his loins he
[16:21] had a circumcision and that was a
[16:23] permanent Mark just like when a person's
[16:26] saved they're permanently saved they're
[16:28] permanently sealed until the day of
[16:29] their Redemption praise God it's a type
[16:32] that was a type of what happens to us in
[16:34] the New Testament all right a baby boy
[16:37] like I told you last time or a baby girl
[16:38] I've seen it eight times my wife has had
[16:40] eight babies I've seen it it's like this
[16:41] every time amen the water breaks and
[16:44] then there's blood and then the spirit
[16:46] comes water blood spirit Hallelujah now
[16:49] my wife said it's not bloody show all
[16:50] the time so just put blood there okay my
[16:53] wife does a good job helping me like I
[16:56] told you last time see and that and so
[16:58] many things have three stages to
[17:00] Perfection man is perfected in three
[17:03] stages there's do you know there's three
[17:05] types of bodies there's a terrestrial
[17:07] body that's a flesh body there's a
[17:09] Celestial body that's a like an Angelic
[17:11] body and then there's a glorified body
[17:13] which is a combination of both of
[17:15] them this one eats this one doesn't this
[17:18] one
[17:19] eats Hallelujah that's the difference
[17:22] between this one and that one this is a
[17:24] spirit and a flesh body combined and it
[17:26] can eat and drink water
[17:29] hallelujah amen there's three kinds of
[17:32] bodies the earth goes through three
[17:34] stages for Perfection the flood of Noah
[17:36] Jesus's blood and the fire that Peter
[17:38] talks about fervent heat a baby again is

[18:18] Ghost not three persons three
[18:21] manifestations the Bible calls them
[18:24] manifestations and a plant we saw this
[18:26] brother irin and brother John know this
[18:27] for sure a a wheat gra wheat goes
[18:30] through three stages the stock the
[18:32] tassel then the grain there's three
[18:34] stages Jesus said that in Mark 4:
[18:37] 28 all right and these are all that's
[18:39] all repetition so I'm just trying to
[18:40] skip past that I'm going to go fast I
[18:42] don't know why I repeated that that was
[18:44] my fault now I'm going to skip past this
[18:47] uh because I think you're pretty uh
[18:50] pretty good on this here I'm going to
[18:51] skip down that's slide number 31 now I'm
[18:54] watching my slides here so I can go to
[18:57] the right one now what I'm SK skipping
[18:59] is that the new Earth is not the
[19:01] Millennium but I've been over that with
[19:03] you and I'm going to skip down to slide
[19:05] looks like 55 yeah I want you to see
[19:07] this
[19:09] here in these slides brother Ram
[19:12] says
[19:13] uh in this slide brother Ram says the
[19:17] new Heaven and new earth is not going to
[19:18] be like a brand new Earth God has to
[19:20] create a brand new Earth that's not what
[19:22] it means it means God's going to burn
[19:24] all the sin on the outside he's going to
[19:26] leave the framework of the earth and
[19:28] then then he's going to cause a brand
[19:30] new uh you know a brand new vegetation
[19:32] and all the all the all the trees and
[19:35] and that's all going to grow again brand
[19:37] new but he's keeping the same Earth okay
[19:41] so brother says see the old world
[19:42] framework was not destroyed by the water
[19:44] of Noah's time the world was only washed
[19:47] off that got its baptism it was baptized
[19:49] you know the Earth got
[19:51] baptized so did I so did you amen
[19:54] hallelujah you ought to be because God's
[19:56] got to redeem the the the the the man
[19:58] the same way he redeems the Earth praise
[20:00] God because that's where our bodies come
[20:02] from our bodies come from the
[20:03] earth so will the framework remain
[20:06] though it be burnt by fire it doesn't
[20:08] destroy the Earth sea it just destroys
[20:10] the sin that's on the earth okay so this
[20:14] is some picture right you got your inner
[20:15] core of the Earth outer core inner
[20:17] mantle I do teach science but I don't
[20:19] teach this okay this this is beyond me
[20:22] but I'm just showing you you got your
[20:23] you know outer crust and everything like
[20:24] that but the Bible said you know right
[20:27] now sin is present on the outside side
[20:29] right but then that that represents fire
[20:31] see that orange and now there's just a
[20:33] fire that's what God's going to do there
[20:35] in second Peter 3 he's going to send a
[20:37] fervent heat he's just going to burn the
[20:39] outside he's not going to burn the
[20:40] inside the inside's already burning
[20:42] Hallelujah just like you amen the
[20:44] inside's already burning hallelujah how
[20:47] many hearts are burning for Jesus
[20:48] tonight see the inside's already burning
[20:51] he's just got to clean the outside off
[20:53] he's got to get all the sin on the
[20:54] outside Hallelujah because it's already
[20:56] on fire on the inside thank God Amen
[20:58] that we're burning on the inside
[21:00] Hallelujah Glory see and now the sin is
[21:04] cleansed once he burns the outside the
[21:06] sin is cleansed and now the framework
[21:08] remains right all these parts inner
[21:10] outer inner mantle outer mantle All That
[21:13] Remains but now we can start a brand new
[21:15] Earth with the outside of the Earth all
[21:18] right now I'm going to have to skip some
[21:20] of these uh by God's grace oh yeah I
[21:23] love this quote brother man say he
[21:24] quotes Peter Peter says the Earth shall
[21:26] pass away and melt the elements with
[21:28] ferv heat see doesn't mean that the
[21:30] Earth the planet's going to pass away
[21:32] but the world Cosmos how many happy the
[21:34] politics are going to pass
[21:36] away the sinners now we don't want to
[21:39] see them lost but they got to make their
[21:41] choice the system how you looking
[21:44] forward the sin being burned up
[21:46] everybody should have said Amen on that
[21:48] how you looking forward to disease being
[21:49] burned up germs everything that's wrong
[21:52] will pass away Hallelujah that's why
[21:54] God's got to send a a spiritual fire
[21:57] some type of spiritual natural fire and
[21:59] burn all the sin and the politics and
[22:01] the uh the debauchery the lasciviousness
[22:04] he's got to burn it all up so he can
[22:06] start again Hallelujah and he can put
[22:08] the Earth in the right condition the way
[22:11] it was at the beginning hallelujah amen
[22:14] now let me check my my notes
[22:17] here yeah brother said he's going to
[22:19] burn up but not the planet just the
[22:21] works of men all their politicians their
[22:23] schemes their denominations aren't you
[22:25] glad the denominations are going to get
[22:26] burned up I'm talking about the
[22:27] buildings and the systems and their
[22:29] Creed books and their bylaws we want the
[22:31] people to be saved we're not against the
[22:32] people we're against the Antichrist
[22:34] system we're against their Antichrist
[22:37] doctrines Hallelujah because our only
[22:39] Doctrine is the word of God hallelujah
[22:41] that's
[22:44] right yeah remember the Bible says see
[22:46] the Earth also and the works that there
[22:48] shall be burned up so God's going to
[22:51] destroy all the outside of the Earth the
[22:54] struggling nature he's also going to
[22:56] burn up all the evil works as well
[22:58] they'll all be burnt up praise God for
[23:01] that
[23:02] Hallelujah now I'm going to skip ahead
[23:04] here because again I can't cover all
[23:06] this uh just got to listen to the sermon
[23:08] oh
[23:10] yeah I like this one so brother yeah the
[23:13] Bible says there's going to remember
[23:14] Peter said there's going to be a great
[23:15] noise do I have that verse up
[23:18] here I don't have the verse but the
[23:20] Bible said the the the fervent heat will
[23:22] explode with a loud noise and brother
[23:24] Braham Likens that to when you get the
[23:26] Holy Ghost you make noise
[23:28] amen he said you know when a man
[23:30] receives a baptism of fire there's a lot
[23:32] of noise around there they think that's
[23:34] a shame to hear people scream and shout
[23:36] like that just wait till this Earth gets
[23:38] her baptism of fire amen see when you
[23:42] get the Holy Ghost something brother man
[23:44] say some the Bible says something has to
[23:45] happen you can see it and hear it
[23:48] Hallelujah I know I made a lot of noise
[23:49] when I got the Holy Ghost amen I seen
[23:51] other people they make a lot of noise
[23:52] when they get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[23:55] there there'll be some type of noise
[23:56] Hallelujah because that's what's going
[23:57] to happen there's an explosion and
[23:59] fervent heat that's what happens in your
[24:01] soul when you get born again
[24:04] Hallelujah
[24:06] Glory now this is the word brother Ram
[24:08] uses the Earth gets renovated but not
[24:11] annihilated Annihilation is to totally
[24:14] destroy right God's not going to
[24:16] annihilate the Earth to make a new Earth
[24:18] he's just going to renovate the outer
[24:19] crust of it okay and just burn the
[24:22] outside is everybody clear on that these
[24:24] are the main points he said just like
[24:26] you're renovated when God does the three
[24:27] works on you
[24:29] God doesn't annihilate
[24:30] you he renovates you and the church said
[24:35] I love what brother said
[24:38] Hallelujah he says it won't be
[24:39] annihilated and then he says
[24:44] this he says uh like he did us his
[24:49] creation to live in before he come in it
[24:51] he had to give us the baptism of fire
[24:54] then the Holy Ghost can come in and live
[24:56] the baptism of Fire
[24:59] Hallelujah remember the Bible said
[25:01] blessed are the meek for they shall
[25:03] inherit the earth see church if you just
[25:05] live a a Meek humble what does meek mean
[25:08] it means humble it means putting God
[25:10] above you if you just put God above you
[25:12] God is going to let you inherit a
[25:14] portion of this Earth and I mean in its
[25:17] best condition hallelujah amen in a
[25:19] perfect sinless condition if you can
[25:21] just live a Meek humble life you if you
[25:24] can just say Jesus I want to follow your
[25:26] leading all the days of my life God will
[25:28] bless bless you and you'll get to
[25:29] inherit this Earth it's okay if you
[25:31] don't have much now but God promises
[25:33] he'll give you much later hallelujah
[25:38] amen all right all right now I'm going
[25:41] to skip uh here let me look at my
[25:46] notes
[25:49] okay now we went over this earlier but
[25:51] the new Earth is not the
[25:53] Millennium okay I got to skip uh here
[25:58] the new Earth is different from the
[25:59] Millennium the Millennium is not the end
[26:02] of it there will still be time after the
[26:04] Millennium the Millennium is a space of
[26:06] time but not the new Earth I'm trying to
[26:09] get to my uh I want to give you a visual
[26:11] yeah here's a visual okay all right now
[26:12] everybody see this this is the time of
[26:14] Adam 6,000 years ago okay here's where
[26:17] we are right now okay 2,000 years after
[26:19] Christ
[26:21] 2024 so brother Ram says God has given
[26:24] us six 6,000 years of History each each
[26:28] thousand year is like uh is like one day
[26:30] with God right A Thousand Years is as a
[26:32] day with God Peter says that okay and so
[26:35] brother R explains if you if you pay
[26:38] attention to the Bible you'll see the
[26:39] Bible give you clues about how God is
[26:42] going to finish the Earth and bring in a
[26:44] New Jerusalem okay so here's there's day
[26:47] one so day one was you know from Adam
[26:49] until a thousand years after Adam day
[26:52] two is from the the next thousand year
[26:54] and then there's a flood there's a flood
[26:56] after about two thousand years after
[26:59] Adam okay then there was another
[27:01] Thousand Years another thousand years
[27:02] and then there's calvary or the blood of
[27:04] Jesus Christ so there's a second step
[27:06] right water blood see but we haven't had
[27:09] the fire yet Hallelujah but the fire's
[27:15] coming okay and so that that was this is
[27:17] a thousand years after Christ was
[27:19] crucified and the next one is where we
[27:21] are that's also called the seven Church
[27:23] ages okay is that pretty familiar by
[27:26] God's grace it's just a different way
[27:28] look at human history this is just human
[27:30] history on a timeline and how God is
[27:32] going to redeem the Earth the same way
[27:34] he redeems
[27:36] man all right next is coming a fire I
[27:39] believe it's right after Armageddon
[27:41] because the Bible said in the Millennium
[27:42] we walk upon the ashes of the wicked
[27:44] think of that will walk on the ashes of
[27:47] the wicked all those that blasphemed
[27:48] Jesus Christ all those that wouldn't
[27:50] repent of their idolatries and their
[27:52] fornications and their uh their
[27:54] wickedness God burns them up and then we
[27:56] walk on the ashes of the wicked
[27:59] so see God's going to put let me say it
[28:00] like this God's going to put all enemies
[28:02] under your
[28:03] feet every hear me on that one I'm going
[28:05] say it again that was good amen any
[28:07] enemy you're struggling with I'm talking
[28:08] about demonic powers or anything any bad
[28:10] habits God's going to put all enemies
[28:12] under your feet praise God and he proves
[28:15] it in the Millennium because you walk
[28:16] upon you walk upon the ashes of of all
[28:20] the Sinners right the ashes on any
[28:23] government building you're going to walk
[28:24] on the ashes of it Hallelujah God's
[28:27] going to put you above all these systems
[28:28] of man Hallelujah because you were Meek
[28:31] and the meek inherit the earth
[28:33] Hallelujah so when Amazon's all gone
[28:35] you'll still be here is that right
[28:38] Church Glory hallelujah amen when
[28:41] Walmart's all gone you'll still be here
[28:44] you'll walk on the ashes of Walmart and
[28:46] Amazon Hallelujah not pridefully like
[28:48] I'm you know I'm walking like I got some
[28:49] strength and some energy you know but
[28:52] but you but the Bible say see those are
[28:54] those all those companies support you
[28:56] know homosexuality all these things
[28:58] God's got to burn it he's got to clean
[29:00] it off Hallelujah he's got to start all
[29:01] over again and bring it back to
[29:03] righteousness Hallelujah if you live a
[29:05] righteous life you'll walk upon the
[29:07] ashes of the wicked the Bible
[29:09] says so there's the fire the Earth will
[29:11] go through that fire after
[29:13] Armageddon and then that's the
[29:15] Millennium there's a Thousand-Year
[29:16] Millennium everybody see that it's hard
[29:17] to see it's Millennium I preached on
[29:20] that a month ago I got the recording if
[29:22] you want to hear it so the Millennium is
[29:24] like the seventh day or the seventh
[29:26] group of a Thousand-Year Peri periods
[29:29] okay everybody see
[29:31] that remember brother R said the Rapture
[29:34] here is like the wedding ceremony then
[29:36] we go to the wedding supper in heaven
[29:37] and then the Millennium is our honeymoon
[29:40] amen hallelujah oh if you never got a
[29:41] good good honeymoon over here you're
[29:43] going to get the best honeymoon
[29:44] Hallelujah you get a thousand year
[29:46] honeymoon with Jesus amen
[29:51] hallelujah and then after the Millennium
[29:54] brother Braham said the next after that
[29:56] 7,000 years the next next set of
[29:59] thousand breaks into eternity and it's
[30:01] like the eighth day it's like the the
[30:03] week starts over right after seven days
[30:06] you start over you start the week over
[30:08] and brother man said that's like a cycle
[30:09] of Eternity it's like you're just going
[30:11] to break back into a cycle of Eternity
[30:14] the time's going to end you're going to
[30:15] break into eternity he calls it the
[30:17] Eighth Day
[30:20] Hallelujah you get the new heavens of
[30:22] the new Earth the new Earth of Jerusalem
[30:24] is like the eighth day it's after the
[30:26] 7,000 years now you step into the future
[30:28] home and now it's the Eighth Day the
[30:30] week is over amen the seven days are
[30:32] over now you step into the next week but
[30:35] this week has no time
[30:37] hallelujah amen and you see the Earth
[30:39] moved up there and then this is what
[30:41] we're talking about now now that's your
[30:43] home that's your Eternal home come down
[30:44] to earth and that's where you live
[30:48] Hallelujah everybody see that by God's
[30:51] grace all right I see a lot of smiles
[30:53] out there that's making me happy
[30:55] Hallelujah and if I see frowns you talk
[30:57] to me after Serv I'll apologize if I
[30:59] said something wrong okay if I said
[31:01] something wrong you correct me after
[31:02] service I'm I'm open to correction but
[31:04] you better make sure you're
[31:05] right right you want to correct me
[31:07] that's fine but you better make sure you
[31:08] got scripture to do it
[31:12] Hallelujah okay
[31:15] now there we go now so the new Earth is
[31:18] not the Millennium okay now this is a
[31:20] good chart too this is what brother Ram
[31:21] explains in the sermon he said every
[31:23] 2,000 years God does something major
[31:26] after the first 2,000 years Noah's flood
[31:29] the second 2,000 years the blood of
[31:31] Jesus Christ this last 2,000 years
[31:33] brother R's Ministry came as a prophet
[31:35] Ministry brother R spoke with thus
[31:37] sayith the
[31:39] Lord I have six examples where brother
[31:41] said thus sayi the Lord and He predicted
[31:43] the future and it came to pass another
[31:45] brother has 10 examples where brother
[31:47] said thus say the Lord you're going to
[31:48] be healed and the people come back later
[31:50] and they got healed that's 16 times who
[31:53] do you know who's prophesied 16 times
[31:56] and it came to pass nobody
[31:59] none because none of them had a gift of
[32:02] a prophet but we've received a prophetic
[32:04] gift Hallelujah and how do I know
[32:07] because he pointed me back to the Bible
[32:09] Hallelujah not only did he have a gift
[32:11] of Prophecy not only did he do that but
[32:13] he pointed me back to the true teachings
[32:15] of the Bible He restored our faith back
[32:17] to the faith of St Paul St Peter St John
[32:21] St James we have the original Faith
[32:23] Church
[32:24] hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory that's
[32:27] the seven Church
[32:28] ages all right that's in Revelation chap
[32:31] 2 and 3 all right now I'm going to skip
[32:34] past this now I I showed this last time
[32:36] hone you remember that anybody remember
[32:37] this this is how these are just three
[32:39] simple ways how the Millennium is
[32:41] different from the New Jerusalem this is
[32:43] what I'm preaching on tonight and I'm
[32:44] already 30 minutes in I don't know how
[32:46] this time goes so
[32:48] fast now the Millennium it's a thousand
[32:50] years Sinners are still cursed in the
[32:53] Millennium right they'll uh the Bible
[32:55] said they'll they'll argue and fuss and
[32:57] you've got to come man and you've got to
[32:58] solve all the problems and you will
[33:00] because you have a perfect body you have
[33:02] a perfect body that means you never get
[33:04] tired Hallelujah you have a perfect mind
[33:06] that means you'll never get
[33:08] confused that's what the Bible says
[33:10] you'll Reign you'll Reign Over cities
[33:11] you'll Reign Over Nations now the more
[33:13] sacrifice the more the larger territory
[33:15] you'll Reign Over Jesus says
[33:19] hallelujah but see Sinners get a curse
[33:22] and the Bible said if they won't come up
[33:23] to Jerusalem to worship Jesus will say
[33:25] no more rain on you and their all their
[33:29] crops will die because they won't come
[33:31] up in worship hallelujah amen it's a
[33:33] curse Jesus will put curses on these
[33:35] nations if they won't come up and
[33:37] worship at Jerusalem that's during the
[33:38] Thousand-Year Millennium but the Bible
[33:40] said Revelation 22:3 there's no more
[33:43] curse in the future home Hallelujah
[33:46] there's no more curse in the New
[33:47] Jerusalem praise God because all the sin
[33:49] has been done away with every person's
[33:51] been judged Jesus has separated the
[33:54] Sheep he saves the Sheep but the goats
[33:56] get cast in the Lake of Fire
[33:59] alive during the Millennium Nations get
[34:01] deceived right Satan goes out after the
[34:03] thousand years he goes to the Four
[34:05] Corners one 2 3 4 and he draws all these
[34:08] people the numbers of sand of the sea
[34:10] and he brings them up against Jerusalem
[34:12] but then God Saves us God sends fire
[34:14] isn't that awesome fire saves us
[34:16] hallelujah fire lives in our soul and
[34:18] then fire saves us amen hallelujah God
[34:20] is always using this fire Hallelujah to
[34:23] be with us but see they can be deceived
[34:26] but in revelation 22 the the nations are
[34:29] healed remember the Bible said that the
[34:31] the leaves will be for the healing of
[34:33] the Nations brother raham said a king
[34:35] let's say a king of uh let's say a king
[34:37] of Africa a king of Africa will take a
[34:39] leave Leaf off and brother said he'll
[34:42] hand that to a king of a neighboring
[34:44] country because that's what the dove did
[34:47] when God healed the Earth the dove
[34:49] remember the dove found a leaf and
[34:50] brought it back to Noah and that leaf
[34:53] represented the healing of a Nation
[34:54] Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah praise God
[34:58] amen the dove handed the the leaf back
[35:00] showing God is going to heal the Earth
[35:02] and so in the future home the Nations
[35:04] imagine whoever's in charge of the
[35:06] United States maybe it be some of us by
[35:07] God's
[35:08] grace you will give that healing there
[35:10] to the uh maybe the the the nation of
[35:13] Mexico right let's heal our relations
[35:16] now there's going to be no more sin now
[35:17] there's going to be perfect peace by the
[35:19] grace of God healing so the Nations get
[35:22] healed in the future home but during the
[35:24] Millennium some of them are deceived
[35:28] all right and the last thing uh nations
[35:30] are killed so death is in this time
[35:32] period Nations I think that's the wrong
[35:34] word uh I think I meant people are
[35:37] killed
[35:40] huh let me check that out Revelation
[35:42] 20:9 if you have your Bible you can go
[35:44] to that one but like I said I'm going to
[35:45] try to go fast because I got a long way
[35:48] to go okay Revelation 20:9 and they oh
[35:51] okay okay and they went up on the bread
[35:54] of the earth Encompass the camp of the
[35:56] Saints about and the Beloved City and
[35:58] fire came down out of heaven and
[36:00] devoured them okay yes so these are the
[36:03] Nations repres that are talked about in
[36:06] the previous verse Revelation
[36:09] 20:8 yes and shall go out to deceive the
[36:12] Nations okay yes so when God sends fire
[36:15] down at goag and Magog yes the nations
[36:17] are burnt up right
[36:19] there so there's death in this time
[36:22] period but friends there's no more death
[36:24] in the future home Jesus Takes death
[36:27] hell and throws them in the Lake of Fire
[36:29] do you know that death and hell are
[36:31] demons right the angel the death angel
[36:34] remember Egypt right Moses in Egypt
[36:37] Jesus Takes death and hell and he cast
[36:39] him in the Lake of Fire now there's no
[36:41] more death Hallelujah
[36:43] Glory okay so that's how you know the
[36:45] difference can everybody say Amen all
[36:47] right good got it all right now I'm
[36:49] going to skip ahead
[36:51] here let me look at my notes Here I want
[36:53] to go to slide after that um
[37:02] let's go to slide 108 I'm I want to show
[37:04] you I want to show you the pictures too
[37:05] let's see okay I already did that
[37:09] one I really want you to see the
[37:11] pictures I think it'll help
[37:13] you friends as we speak right
[37:16] now
[37:17] uh Jesus Christ is preparing that
[37:20] pyramid City for us right now now it's
[37:23] amazing there's Jesus does so much in
[37:25] heaven do you ever think of this this
[37:27] this blew me away Jesus has to prepare
[37:29] he said I go to prepare your place right
[37:32] that's the next next Slide John 14 let
[37:35] not your heart be troubled but believe
[37:37] in God believe also in me in my father's
[37:39] house are many mansions that means an
[37:41] abode or
[37:43] dwelling if it were not so I would have
[37:45] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[37:48] aren't you glad Jesus is thinking about
[37:49] you I mean I know I know I know he's
[37:51] putting up billions of mansions but one
[37:53] of those is mine so when he makes that
[37:55] one it's just how I like it
[37:58] he's thinking about me brother that
[37:59] means a lot that Jesus thought about me
[38:02] to make me a home praise God and he
[38:04] thought about you isn't that beautiful
[38:07] if he's building a house for you he's
[38:08] got to think about you he knows you he's
[38:11] Eternal Hallelujah he's God he knows
[38:14] everything about you he knows the very
[38:16] number of the hairs on your head if you
[38:17] still have hair on your head Hallelujah
[38:19] for our dear
[38:21] brothers thank God I still got mine by
[38:23] God's gra but you never know what's
[38:25] going to
[38:26] happen Hallelujah so we see it we
[38:31] see that Jesus is going to prepare us a
[38:36] mansion now again I gota watch my
[38:40] time maybe I can finish this uh this is
[38:44] an interesting point you might want to
[38:45] know the New Jerusalem that City that
[38:47] comes down is not heaven right it's
[38:51] actually heaven uniting with Earth some
[38:54] people think oh when we when I die I'm
[38:56] just going to heaven I'll be in heaven
[38:57] forever no you'll be there for a while
[39:00] but after everything everybody's judged
[39:02] Heaven comes down to earth Heaven and
[39:04] Earth unite like a husband and wife
[39:07] hallelujah amen that's what that's what
[39:09] the Bible said that City comes down as a
[39:12] bride adorned for her what husband so
[39:15] the Earth is the husband and the city is
[39:17] the wife the city is the uh is heaven
[39:20] it's the it's the home of
[39:22] Jesus and the husband and wife come
[39:25] together a perfect union Hallelujah amen
[39:28] so brother man makes this point see I
[39:31] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[39:33] coming down from God out of Heaven
[39:34] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[39:37] husband brother said remember it's not
[39:39] heaven John said I saw it coming down
[39:41] out of Heaven it's to be on the earth
[39:43] see not this Earth is going to pass away
[39:46] it's a redeemed Earth God didn't say he
[39:48] was going to raise up a new generation
[39:49] he's going to redeem the one that's here
[39:51] he he ain't going to raise up a new
[39:53] generation he redeems the one that's
[39:54] already here he ain't going to make a
[39:56] new world it's the one right here
[39:59] hallelujah so see the Throne of God
[40:02] comes down to earth Heaven's Throne
[40:04] comes down to Earth and Heaven and Earth
[40:07] unite praise
[40:08] God there's a song that we somebody sang
[40:11] it was really good
[40:13] uh the song says uh I'll be gone when
[40:16] the tribulation comes I'll be gone but
[40:18] then the next verse is but I'm coming
[40:20] back when the tribulation is over I'm
[40:22] coming back Hallelujah and that's how it
[40:24] is whoever dies here or if we go in the
[40:26] Rapture we'll be going gone from the
[40:27] earth for a little while but friends
[40:29] we're coming back and we'll send spend
[40:31] eternity on this Earth by God's grace
[40:34] Hallelujah I'll be gone but I'm coming
[40:37] back by God's grace Hallelujah all right
[40:39] now yeah I'm going to skip past this
[40:42] here yeah I want to kind of close with
[40:44] that one that's
[40:46] 123 okay
[40:50] now there's a lot of good things in here
[40:52] I'm just going to read a few by God's
[40:54] grace uh the Throne of Heaven comes down
[40:56] to earth
[40:58] and then the city will be just like the
[41:00] bride likes yeah let me just go this I I
[41:03] think I'll show you
[41:04] this it's just I like to show you some
[41:07] visuals the new Earth the Throne of
[41:08] Heaven comes down to
[41:10] earth brother manam said now notice how
[41:13] we go after the world's fire baptism all
[41:15] germs is gone makes it a fit place then
[41:18] for heaven to dwell here on Earth so
[41:21] Heaven's Throne comes down to earth
[41:23] Heaven and Earth
[41:25] unite okay I'm GNA skip past that so
[41:27] there's my Earth there's my there's my
[41:29] common animation that's as good of a
[41:31] animation as I can do okay all right and
[41:34] there's a more beautiful picture of it
[41:35] you know you got the I just love that
[41:37] view now remember there's no sea but
[41:39] there there looks like there could be
[41:40] lakes in the future home because like my
[41:42] daughter was saying how could God not
[41:44] have any whales in in in there like God
[41:46] made this beautiful whale you know
[41:47] there's got to be some whales there
[41:49] right God's not going to say I'm done
[41:51] with whales no more whales we want to
[41:53] see whales amen I like to go swimming
[41:55] with some whales amen and not have to
[41:57] worry about drowning or anything like
[41:58] that or swallow like Jonah praise God
[42:01] you see so there's got to be something
[42:05] there now there there's there's so much
[42:08] my so the the New Jerusalem coming down
[42:11] where we're going to live is just like
[42:13] when the Dove came down on Jesus you'll
[42:15] appreciate that but it's it's a it's a
[42:16] it's a
[42:17] foreshadowing it's the Dove came down
[42:20] Heaven and Earth United there it is amen
[42:22] the dove from Heaven United with the
[42:24] Earth the body of Jesus Christ see that
[42:27] it's it's and just when you got the Holy
[42:29] Ghost the same thing Hallelujah glory
[42:31] amen Heaven and Earth United Hallelujah
[42:35] so it's a good it's a good
[42:37] foreshadow all right
[42:40] now I want to show you some pictures
[42:43] here now brother R says the measurement
[42:45] of the city is uh each side is
[42:49] 1,500 miles wide okay so Revelation
[42:54] 21:15 the city's Four Square so it's
[42:56] like a square at the
[42:58] base okay it's uh 7even 12,000 furong
[43:02] the length and breadth and height of it
[43:04] are equal so 12,000 furlongs equals
[43:07] 1,500
[43:09] miles okay so brother R went and he
[43:12] measured it out on a map okay there
[43:14] there's the calculation from Good Old
[43:16] I'm sorry from Bad old Google not good
[43:18] old Google bad old Google so if you put
[43:21] 12,000 fur longs it equals
[43:25] 1,500 miles
[43:28] okay so brother mam said he went
[43:30] measured it on a map and so here's the
[43:32] size of the city for us it reaches from
[43:35] Maine all the way down to Florida that's
[43:37] just one side and there's three gates on
[43:40] this side 1 2 3 one two 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
[43:44] where people can come where the kings of
[43:45] the Earth can come back into the city
[43:48] Hallelujah that's a pretty big city
[43:50] Hallelujah but that's the home of
[43:52] Jesus's bride he said I go prepare a
[43:55] place for you that where I am you shall
[43:58] be also amen who you long yes you're
[44:01] longing to see some of your loved ones
[44:02] in heaven no doubt about it but who do
[44:03] we long to see most the Lord Jesus
[44:05] Christ Hallelujah he said I'm going to
[44:07] go prepare a place for you that where I
[44:10] am you shall be
[44:14] also all right now that's unnecessary I
[44:16] don't have to do that now here's the
[44:17] location so that that's about the same
[44:19] size right of where it would be and I
[44:20] just slid that over there there's my
[44:22] there's that's all the animation I can
[44:23] do in my life okay so that's exactly
[44:26] where it's going to sit that that's just
[44:28] to give you an idea of the size of it
[44:31] but that's how big the future home is
[44:33] going to be on the entire on the earth
[44:34] when it comes it's going to be that
[44:38] large okay now you're going to like some
[44:40] of these here too let me skip ahead here
[44:43] yes brother man says the city must be a
[44:44] pyramid you'd be surprised most people
[44:46] think this city is going to be a cube
[44:48] but brother man proves it can't be a
[44:50] cube anybody know why okay we'll see
[44:55] brother bam said he he said there's
[44:57] another geographical measure that the
[44:59] dimensions are the same that is a
[45:01] pyramid four square and all the walls
[45:04] were the
[45:05] same he said let me draw it okay then he
[45:08] draws it okay so most people think the
[45:10] future home's this but it can't be that
[45:13] it has to be this for one very important
[45:16] reason ah I see our sister smiling there
[45:18] amen she probably knows what it is amen
[45:21] now have you got that City see it's a
[45:23] Holy Mountain it's a mountain who's ever
[45:25] seen a cube mountain now come on
[45:29] I have never seen a cube Mountain I've
[45:31] flown across the different continents
[45:33] I've never seen a cube Mountain it's
[45:35] always like a pyramid shape and the
[45:36] church
[45:37] said the Bible calls it a Holy Mountain
[45:41] the city is not a cube it's a mountain
[45:43] I'm going skip ahead it's just a great
[45:45] Mountain like a pyramid and the city's
[45:47] on the mountain
[45:49] Glory see here's the key here's how you
[45:51] know the throne could not be seen if the
[45:54] walls are straight up and down like a
[45:56] cube
[45:57] right so it has to be a pyramid
[46:02] Hallelujah ever catch that if it's a
[46:04] cube and you're you know down here at
[46:06] the base you you're not going to see
[46:07] Jesus but the Bible said everyone will
[46:10] see Jesus Hallelujah you won't need the
[46:12] sun because the light of Jesus will be
[46:14] shining on all of us
[46:17] hallelujah Glory sister Rachel amen
[46:20] hallelujah God bless you Sister Melinda
[46:22] God bless you Amen brother brother Noah
[46:24] God bless you isn't this beautiful amen
[46:26] the revelation of God where the Bible
[46:29] has to make sense it has to all fit
[46:30] together and church the Holy Ghost fit
[46:32] it together amen the Holy Ghost rightly
[46:34] divides the word of
[46:36] truth if the walls were straight up and
[46:38] down the city could only be seen from
[46:40] the outside or from the inside the
[46:42] throne can only be seen from the inside
[46:44] if it's a cube in other words if you're
[46:47] on the earth you can't even see the
[46:48] Throne of God where's Jesus where's the
[46:51] throne you can't see if it's a cube so
[46:53] it has to be a pyramid Hallelujah so
[46:56] that wherever you are
[46:57] to some degree you can see Jesus
[47:00] hallelujah amen and brother Bram says
[47:04] the Pyramid of Giza right now in Egypt
[47:06] is a witness of this
[47:09] pyramid even its location is a
[47:12] witness
[47:15] right and brother man tells us he
[47:17] believes Enoch built it I believe that
[47:19] too it had to been a Believer and the
[47:21] reason is because the Capstone is not on
[47:23] the pyramid how many you know that
[47:24] there's no Capstone it's missing a
[47:27] headstone it's not complete this bride
[47:30] is missing Jesus the bride's not
[47:32] complete but she's going to be complete
[47:34] Hallelujah she's complete when Jesus
[47:37] comes back
[47:38] Hallelujah Oh Glory so see there's Giza
[47:41] right there's the Pyramid of Giza and
[47:43] there's Israel so see just the very
[47:45] witness that close to Israel there's a
[47:48] pyramid that no man I'm sorry that uh
[47:51] that men can't build today I watch a I I
[47:54] watched a uh a video one time China
[47:57] tried to build one and they tried to
[48:00] build the Pyramid of Giza in their
[48:02] country and they couldn't do it on a
[48:03] grand scale so they just did a very
[48:05] small one as smart as they are and even
[48:08] as smart as American scientists are
[48:10] Americans uh at least learned from that
[48:12] they they learn not even to try don't
[48:15] even try to build it because you can't
[48:17] it was built by some Supernatural Powers
[48:20] it was built by the word of God
[48:22] hallelujah Enoch or whoever it was I
[48:24] believe it's Enoch he he was a prophet
[48:27] somehow he tapped into some powers of
[48:29] God and built that Pyramid of Giza
[48:31] Hallelujah now they think they got some
[48:33] ideas well that somebody else bu Egypt
[48:35] build it well then build another one
[48:37] they're not going to because they can't
[48:39] hallelujah
[48:42] amen okay so there there's what it looks
[48:44] like in real life look how small these
[48:45] people
[48:46] are but there's no Capstone on it
[48:49] because it was a sign that the Capstone
[48:51] is coming Jesus Christ is coming back
[48:54] Amen to cap off the church
[48:59] okay that's where it'll be the missing
[49:01] Capstone on Enoch's pyramid types Christ
[49:03] The Headstone who's coming to this world
[49:04] to cap the Bride of Jesus Christ at the
[49:08] Rapture all right let me check my
[49:10] progress
[49:11] here I want to show you the picture so
[49:13] you got it and brother oh yeah brother
[49:15] said even the whole world witnesses to
[49:17] it right even your dollar bill witnesses
[49:19] to
[49:20] it everything Witnesses brother man said
[49:22] every time you write your a check and
[49:24] you put 2024 you're witnessing of
[49:26] Jesus's life because it's 2024 in the
[49:30] year of Our Lord glory amen every dollar
[49:33] you spend every time you write a check
[49:35] everything you do you can't escape Jesus
[49:37] Christ Hallelujah so if you can't escape
[49:38] him get him inside your heart praise God
[49:41] Amen
[49:42] Hallelujah he's all around us he he the
[49:45] Bible said he's not far from each one of
[49:46] us if we just reach out and try to feel
[49:48] after him that's in Acts chapter
[49:54] 17 all right now let's read this uh
[49:59] where's my verse
[50:05] yes okay so here's here's what I want to
[50:07] show you next now these are just some
[50:09] mountains right there in Israel okay
[50:11] this this is my very childlike
[50:13] animations okay I'm I'm not a computer
[50:15] specialist I wish I was but I'm not well
[50:17] maybe I don't wish I was um but this is
[50:20] what's going to happen the Bible said
[50:22] let me go back the Bible said the Earth
[50:24] is going to raise up like that in order
[50:27] to receive the future home it needs a
[50:30] flat that's what the Bible says I'm
[50:31] going to show it to
[50:32] you and then that City holy city can
[50:35] come down and rest on it that's what the
[50:37] Bible says hallelujah God has to raise
[50:40] up a platform right you you construction
[50:42] workers and know that you got to have a
[50:43] flat flat PL platform right you have to
[50:45] have a firm foundation Hallelujah Jesus
[50:48] Christ is our foundation
[50:50] Hallelujah see the new city is a
[50:53] mountain on top of a mountain oh yeah
[50:55] here's where brother says it
[50:57] Isaiah 2:2 it shall come to pass in the
[50:59] last days that the mountain of the Lord
[51:01] in the mountain of the Lord's house
[51:03] shall be established in the top of the
[51:05] mountains and shall be exalted above the
[51:07] hills and All Nations shall flow into it
[51:11] Hallelujah all right now let me find the
[51:12] other verse yes here it
[51:15] is yeah there's Isaiah 2 1 through3
[51:18] teaches
[51:20] this all right so the mountain is
[51:23] established in the top of the
[51:25] mountains Hallelujah
[51:27] all right oh yeah and here's why it also
[51:30] has to be here's why it also has to be a
[51:33] pyramid because the city had no need of
[51:35] the sun think about that as powerful as
[51:36] the sun is this city that we live in it
[51:39] won't need the sun because the glory of
[51:41] God lightens it and the lamb is the
[51:44] light
[51:47] thereof all right now brother man talks
[51:49] about other mountains Mount Si Mount
[51:53] Transfiguration okay so now here's my
[51:55] here's my picture right now that's Jesus
[51:57] on the throne you can't see because I
[51:59] don't have a very good quality uh
[52:01] picture there but that's Jesus on his
[52:03] throne right and so as Jesus sits there
[52:06] it has to be a pyramid because see the
[52:07] light has to go out that represents
[52:09] light it's a triangle but it's it just
[52:10] represents light if it's a cube you you
[52:14] couldn't see the light of Jesus you
[52:16] still need the sun if it was a
[52:18] cube right Glory you see it brother it
[52:21] has to be a pyramid amen just like Giza
[52:24] it represents Giza represents the future
[52:27] home see people live in here if it was a
[52:31] cube and you live right here you would
[52:32] need the sun because there' just be a
[52:34] shadow all the time right but it has to
[52:36] be a pyramid that way the light can
[52:38] shine down on you hallelujah amen we
[52:40] walk in the light such a beautiful light
[52:42] Hallelujah comes where the due doops of
[52:44] Mercy are bright and see he's Shin light
[52:47] I me he just shines light in every
[52:48] direction by God's
[52:50] grace okay just my yeah those are my
[52:53] those are my elementary animations there
[52:55] okay yeah that's a
[52:57] picture there's Jesus he's at the top of
[52:59] the pyramid right and he's giving out
[53:01] light now it's just the best picture I
[53:03] got right does it just to gives you an
[53:07] idea all right you've been a good
[53:08] audience now I want to
[53:11] um move ahead
[53:17] now now the Bible says there's a wall
[53:20] how many know there's a wall around the
[53:21] city remember that from Revelation
[53:24] 21 it has 12 found founds and in them
[53:27] are the names of the TW Apostles of the
[53:30] Lamb think about that God honors them so
[53:33] much why did God honor them remember he
[53:35] told Peter because you left fathers
[53:37] mothers children houses and lands for my
[53:40] name's sake see missionaries that leave
[53:43] their families and things their family
[53:45] suffers so God rewards
[53:47] them and he put He even put their name
[53:50] inside the
[53:51] foundations
[53:54] Hallelujah and the wall that's around
[53:56] this had 12 foundations and they were
[53:58] the same stones that were on Aaron's
[54:00] breastplate so here's the 12 type of
[54:03] stones Jasper Sapphire I can't even
[54:05] pronounce some of these Emerald sardonic
[54:08] sardus chrysolite Barrel
[54:11] topaz chry of
[54:14] praus jacin I can't even say him
[54:16] amethyst so I don't I don't I don't know
[54:19] my gems as you know I I don't know very
[54:21] good but these are the same stones that
[54:23] the high priest wore on the Yurman
[54:25] thumin and he was go into the Hol of
[54:27] holies right each Stone represented a
[54:30] tribe and God uses those same stones to
[54:33] build the foundation of his of your home
[54:36] I'm going start calling it your
[54:38] home Hallelujah so see now this is no
[54:42] particular order but right you have
[54:44] Thomas Matthew Bartholomew philli John
[54:46] James Andrew Peter Simon the Canaanite
[54:49] James and thus because I I didn't have
[54:50] enough colors I didn't have enough they
[54:52] ran out of colors here so they ran out
[54:54] of stones but see their names are going
[54:57] to be in there Hallelujah because what
[54:59] did they do they they started the gospel
[55:02] the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[55:04] the kingdom of God hallelujah so God
[55:06] puts their name in The Stone amen that
[55:09] should sound familiar Revelation said
[55:10] you're going to get a stone with your
[55:11] name in
[55:12] it
[55:15] Hallelujah now this is not drawn to
[55:17] scale but here's here's a city and
[55:20] remember there's three gates on each
[55:21] side and the gates are pearly
[55:25] gates
[55:27] Hallelujah let's see do I have any
[55:29] animation on this one no okay now no
[55:32] animation on that one but that's kind of
[55:34] what it looked like from the side now
[55:36] even would be even even more wonderful
[55:38] of course way wonderful than this but
[55:40] just gives you an idea all these nations
[55:42] will flow into the City and the Bible
[55:44] said they're going to bring their Glory
[55:45] and Honor into it by the grace of God
[55:49] okay now I'm going to uh the height of
[55:51] the wall is 144 cubits and again I used
[55:56] uh
[55:57] Google to calculate that it's 19 it's
[56:01] basically 20 stories high so if you find
[56:04] a 20 story building this is a some
[56:06] building in Virginia it's 20 stories
[56:08] high that's how tall the wall is and all
[56:11] these people don't want a wall around
[56:12] our
[56:13] nation God puts a wall around your home
[56:17] Hallelujah and the church
[56:19] said God believes in walls amen the
[56:23] Bible said these walls are salvation
[56:25] deliverance and the gates Our Praise
[56:27] hallelujah
[56:29] amen but this and and this wall is 1,500
[56:34] miles long
[56:36] hallelujah it's has 12 foundations of
[56:39] those 12 types of stones and each each
[56:42] each Stone has a name of a disciple in
[56:44] it by God's
[56:46] grace that's how it's all so next time
[56:48] you see a 20 20 story building that's
[56:50] how tall our our wall of our city of our
[56:53] home is going to be God puts a very
[56:55] strong wall around his brother
[56:56] Pride
[57:00] Hallelujah now the 12 gates are pearly
[57:02] gates I just love this I want to share
[57:04] this
[57:04] one uh and and in the in the gates are
[57:07] the names of the 12 tribes of Israel
[57:10] okay and every several gate was of one
[57:14] Pearl so the gates are made of one Pearl
[57:17] each gate is a pearl now here and so and
[57:21] then here here's the 12 names Simeon
[57:23] Ruben Gad Manasseh Joseph Benjamin Asher
[57:26] II napali isachar Judah and zebul those
[57:29] represent the gates of pearl that each
[57:31] gate has a name of one of the 12 tribes
[57:34] of Israel one of the 12 sons of Israel
[57:36] right but here's the beautiful part now
[57:39] Asher Judah Levi Benjamin now look
[57:42] there's there's a gate and the gates
[57:43] made a
[57:44] pearl a't that amazing why would God
[57:48] have the Pearl right there at the gate
[57:50] to go into his City well it's very
[57:52] simple I believe because Jesus said he
[57:55] is the pearl of of great price amen
[57:59] remember the remember the parable man
[58:00] had many pearls but then he saw the one
[58:02] Pearl he went and sold out all of his
[58:04] pearls to get the great pearl of great
[58:06] price amen that's what that's what you
[58:09] did you might have had good things in
[58:11] your life there was probably some good
[58:12] things in your previous church right
[58:13] there mind Holiness that's for sure amen
[58:16] hallelujah there's some good things I
[58:18] had some good things in Pentecost I mean
[58:20] people got healed of cancer that was
[58:21] good but they cut their hair wore makeup
[58:23] and you know all kinds of evil things
[58:26] there were some good things we had some
[58:27] pearls oh but when we saw the Pearl the
[58:30] Lord Jesus Christ the true
[58:32] interpretation of the Bible the baptism
[58:34] of the Holy Ghost when we saw the pearl
[58:35] of GRA price we sold everything out so
[58:38] we could have that Pearl in other words
[58:40] in other words each one of us had to
[58:42] come into the into Jesus Christ through
[58:45] Jesus Christ because he's the door he's
[58:47] the gate Hallelujah and he's so valuable
[58:49] he's like a great Pearl hallelujah amen
[58:52] I wish I could say it if I can't say it
[58:54] right May the Holy Ghost show you what
[58:55] I'm talking about okay I'm not smart
[58:57] enough to give the right words but I
[58:59] think you understand what I'm saying
[59:00] Jesus Christ is the gate Jesus Christ is
[59:02] the door and he's so valuable he's like
[59:04] the great pearl of great price you gave
[59:07] up everything for Jesus Christ or you

[1:00:16] and the church
[1:00:17] said I could waste two hours watching a

[1:00:23] going like this Hallelujah which is good
[1:00:25] Hallelujah feels like it's going fast
[1:00:26] tonight
[1:00:28] Hallelujah so the New
[1:00:31] Jerusalem yes yes oh yeah beautiful okay
[1:00:34] the New Jerusalem will be where the
[1:00:36] current Jerusalem is right now the Bible
[1:00:39] tells us
[1:00:40] that okay let let's look look at
[1:00:43] Zechariah 14:4 and his feet shall stand
[1:00:46] in that day upon the Mount of Olives
[1:00:47] that's right next to um Mount Zion and
[1:00:51] uh what's the other one where the Temple
[1:00:53] of the mount is there in Jerusalem can
[1:00:55] never think of that
[1:00:56] uh what's the name of that
[1:00:58] mountain right next to Mount
[1:01:01] Zion I can't think of it now forgive me
[1:01:03] Lord he says but okay so you have Mount
[1:01:06] Zion then you have another Mountain
[1:01:07] that's where the Dome of the Rock is
[1:01:08] then you have a valley then you have
[1:01:09] Mount olives right next to it he says
[1:01:12] which is before Jerusalem on the East
[1:01:14] and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in
[1:01:16] the midst thereof toward the East and
[1:01:18] toward the west okay so that's what I
[1:01:19] showed you uh where that ground raises
[1:01:22] up right has to raise up and there
[1:01:25] should should be a very great valley and
[1:01:28] half of the mountain yeah half okay yeah
[1:01:29] half of the mountain shall remov toward
[1:01:31] the North and the other half towards the
[1:01:33] South so so a mountain can rise up I
[1:01:36] didn't have that on my animation but
[1:01:37] that's look that's what the Bible says
[1:01:40] half the mountain has to go to the north
[1:01:42] half South right and then a mountain can
[1:01:44] raise up to be on the
[1:01:46] mountain okay and that's where it is
[1:01:48] that and that's about the that's about
[1:01:50] the size of it too right there's
[1:01:51] Jerusalem that's where the very center

[1:07:55] cuts her hair it's a shame and disgrace
[1:07:58] upon her husband right the word shame
[1:08:01] means a repulse right repulsive is like
[1:08:04] oh
[1:08:05] L because it shows she she doesn't want
[1:08:07] to be under the headship of her husband
[1:08:09] so she cuts her hair that's what the
[1:08:11] Bible says but there there won't be any
[1:08:13] of that in the new city Hallelujah

[1:08:38] to have a white robe on ain't they going
[1:08:40] to be beautiful it says shows we're all

[1:09:51] and offerings to the temple of God cuz
[1:09:54] Jesus is the Temple there is not going
[1:09:56] to be a temple because Jesus is the
[1:09:58] temple
[1:10:00] Hallelujah
[1:10:02] Glory see the Bible says honor the Lord
[1:10:04] with thy substance and with the first
[1:10:06] fruits of thine increase so see that's
[1:10:08] their tithes and offerings the kings of
[1:10:10] the Earth are going to plant all these
[1:10:11] Vineyards and farms and they're going to
[1:10:13] bring their ties and offerings to Jesus
[1:10:16] see that's why you should bring your
[1:10:17] ties and offerings now prise the Lord
[1:10:19] hallelujah ties go to the pastor which
[1:10:22] you guys are praying for one offering go
[1:10:24] for the bill building to handle all the
[1:10:26] other Affairs right but ties are for the
[1:10:29] pastor so he can live and just preach
[1:10:31] the gospel now I'm still praying for our
[1:10:33] church to get big enough so I can just
[1:10:35] preach full-time but God hasn't granted
[1:10:37] that but that's okay because Paul never
[1:10:39] Paul Paul was a he wasn't a full-time
[1:10:41] preacher either do you know that Paul's
[1:10:43] a Tent Maker you know that Paul made
[1:10:46] tents and then he go preach I go to
[1:10:48] school I go teach lessons and then I go
[1:10:50] preach Hallelujah so I'm not alone Paul
[1:10:53] was like that too I'm hoping someday
[1:10:55] could be a full-time
[1:10:56] pastor but see in most churches if the
[1:10:58] church is big enough they all their ties
[1:11:00] 10 10% of everybody's income could
[1:11:02] support one man so he can just preach
[1:11:04] the gospel pray fast and then minister
[1:11:06] to the
[1:11:11] congregation all right now I'm going to
[1:11:13] try to skip
[1:11:15] ahead yeah brother man said all the
[1:11:17] kings of the earth bring their honor
[1:11:18] into it see it's like the tribe of Levi
[1:11:21] all the rest of them paid ties to him
[1:11:23] you see so brother through all all these
[1:11:25] Kings of the countries they'll be
[1:11:27] bringing in with their horses and and
[1:11:28] their buggies and everything and their
[1:11:30] their trailers they're going to be
[1:11:31] bringing in the ties of the Corn and the
[1:11:33] oil and the wine they're going to be
[1:11:35] paying their tithes to Jesus Christ what
[1:11:37] about the people that don't pay ties and
[1:11:38] offerings now I got a feeling they won't
[1:11:40] be there right right the Bible said how
[1:11:44] how could a man rob God and not give God
[1:11:46] 10% of his income a man robs God when he
[1:11:49] won't pay his tithes and offerings and
[1:11:51] the church said I have paid tithes since
[1:11:53] I became a pastor I don't think I've
[1:11:55] ever missed a tie payment God has poured
[1:11:56] out so many blessings on me I can't even
[1:11:58] I couldn't even begin to tell you how
[1:11:59] many blessings poured out on me remember
[1:12:01] I told you got my identity stolen
[1:12:03] somebody stole my identity I lost $1,000
[1:12:06] well guess what I went and preach to
[1:12:07] that Kentucky Church a man walked up and
[1:12:09] gave me 2,000 and another man gave my
[1:12:12] children
[1:12:13] 300 so God paid me back and he paid me
[1:12:16] with a lot of interest in there
[1:12:19] too right God will owe no man anything
[1:12:24] I'm a wit of that by God's
[1:12:26] grace it's just one sign of God's love
[1:12:29] church if you honor God God will honor
[1:12:32] you
[1:12:35] Hallelujah now here's one I don't know
[1:12:37] if you ever heard this I can prove
[1:12:38] there's degrees in heaven and they'll
[1:12:41] not all be the same equal but you'll
[1:12:44] have equal eternal life the Bible said
[1:12:46] the kings of the earth bring their Glory
[1:12:48] and Honor into the city that proves
[1:12:50] there'll be kings in the new Earth Kings
[1:12:51] and rulers Jesus told them they said
[1:12:54] what will we have after we left father
[1:12:56] mother and all to follow you so see
[1:12:59] there's going to be degrees just like
[1:13:00] there's degrees of angels right there's
[1:13:01] archangels there's seraphim there's
[1:13:04] cherubims there's wormwood there's all
[1:13:06] these angels they have they have levels
[1:13:07] some have more Authority than others so
[1:13:09] it is with you and I there's going to be
[1:13:11] some of us who are kings and queens
[1:13:14] Hallelujah other people won't be kings
[1:13:16] and queens they'll just be Governors
[1:13:18] over Nations or there'll be rulers over
[1:13:21] cities Jesus said if you're faithful
[1:13:23] with five talents and you make 10 he
[1:13:25] said I'll make you ruler over 10
[1:13:28] cities
[1:13:30] Hallelujah see God is going to he's
[1:13:33] going to find who are the faithful ones
[1:13:34] that love to serve me who are the ones
[1:13:36] that love to sacrifice who are the ones
[1:13:37] that love to pray give alms give tithes
[1:13:39] give offerings uh fast and seek my face
[1:13:43] and God's going to reward them and
[1:13:44] they're going to be kings and queens
[1:13:46] there's going to be all kinds of rulers
[1:13:47] in this future home how many you want to
[1:13:48] be there by God's grace and church I

[1:16:05] brother the greatest suffering he said
[1:16:06] he went through was being rejected by
[1:16:08] all the churches he went from having
[1:16:10] crowds of uh tens of 20 thousands over a
[1:16:14] whole week he might have 300,000 people
[1:16:16] there he went from that to barely having
[1:16:17] just a real small Church all because he
[1:16:19] preached the Bible truth serpent seed
[1:16:21] godhead there's only one person in
[1:16:22] Godhead Lord Jesus Christ baptism women
[1:16:25] and men should dress
[1:16:26] holy he got rejected he said that was
[1:16:29] the hardest thing he went through we had
[1:16:30] to move out to Arizona he left his whole
[1:16:32] family God called him out there so he
[1:16:34] could get the revelation of the Seven
[1:16:35] Seals amen hallelujah hey Church what's
[1:16:38] been the hardest thing I've seen we have
[1:16:40] a guy in our church his dad kicked him
[1:16:41] out because he came to believe the
[1:16:43] message he was homeless and guess who
[1:16:46] let him in I let him in to live with me
[1:16:47] for a couple months until he could
[1:16:48] afford his own
[1:16:50] apartment that's the suffering we have
[1:16:52] to deal with here in America right but
[1:16:55] you know what people call me the devil
[1:16:56] I've been called Satan I've been called
[1:16:58] Judas I've been called everything but as
[1:17:00] long as God calls me forgiven that's all
[1:17:02] I care about praise God I got to be
[1:17:04] called names I got to have people mock
[1:17:06] me or make fun of me or walk out of my
[1:17:07] service that's fine as long as Jesus
[1:17:09] Christ loves me and forgives me I I I'll
[1:17:11] take any rejection I'll take any
[1:17:13] persecution because I want to reain over
[1:17:15] sin that I'm sorry I want to suffer now
[1:17:17] so I can reain later
[1:17:21] Hallelujah and some of you yeah some of
[1:17:23] you your family rejects you that might
[1:17:25] be the suffering you're called to

[1:17:32] enemies

[1:24:58] or money laundering if you just overcome
[1:25:00] those snares and walk the right way here
[1:25:02] you'll walk with Jesus over there Lord
[1:25:05] It's thus say the Bible they shall walk
[1:25:07] with me in white because they're
[1:25:10] worthy
[1:25:12] Lord and if you can be an honor to him
[1:25:15] like he's honored you he's going to
[1:25:18] reward
[1:25:20] you he's not forgetful of our labor of
[1:25:24] love love that's what the Bible says the
[1:25:26] Lord God will always recompense us for
[1:25:28] our efforts to please
[1:25:31] him yes they'd walked through the world
[1:25:34] and had not partaken of it see like we
[1:25:36] went to the fair today all these people
[1:25:38] are partaking of all these evil dance
[1:25:39] they're dancing for the devil they're
[1:25:41] they already got any clothes on they're
[1:25:42] drinking beers people drinking beers but

[1:25:51] that couple of people saw my Jesus shirt
[1:25:54] they said hey I'm a Christian too I say
[1:25:55] glory to God Amen Hallelujah but see we
[1:25:58] have to walk through this world and not
[1:26:00] touch the things of the
[1:26:02] world they not let the World Systems
[1:26:04] overcome them now he would honor them in
[1:26:08] return for they shall walk with him in
[1:26:11] white he would identify himself with
[1:26:14] them in the New Jerusalem how marvelous
[1:26:16] would be that identification it makes me
[1:26:18] rejoice and yet it makes me weep to
[1:26:20] think of his condescension how he's so
[1:26:22] great but yet he condescended to to
[1:26:24] become visible to us for you will note
[1:26:27] that he's not dressed in any other
[1:26:29] different color from the Saints as
[1:26:31] Earthly leaders would do so today no
[1:26:34] they are like him he's like them they
[1:26:37] are like him even as John said for they
[1:26:39] shall see him as he
[1:26:44] is all
[1:26:46] right yes let's read this one the bride
[1:26:49] goes wherever the bridegroom is she will
[1:26:52] never be left by him she will never
[1:26:54] leave his side she will share the throne
[1:26:57] with him she will be crowned with his
[1:27:00] glory and
[1:27:02] honor

[1:27:10] one let me read two more things okay

[1:27:17] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:27:19] shall be his people and God himself
[1:27:22] shall be with them and be their God
