[0:00] I love how brother brandham glorified
[0:03] Jesus Christ and said Jesus Christ is
[0:05] the fullness of the word brother
[0:07] brandham always separated the fullness
[0:09] of the word being Jesus Christ and all
[0:11] the Believers as just having a part of
[0:13] the word in their souls of course that's
[0:15] the seed of God according to 1 Peter
[0:18] 1:23 being born again not of corruptible
[0:21] seed but of Incorruptible by the word of
[0:24] God which liveth and abideth
[0:26] forever here's some quotes I'd like to
[0:28] emphasize the first is from the voice of
[0:30] the sign 1964 brother brandom says I'm
[0:33] not the word I'm a man notice all these
[0:35] brother brandom worshippers are saying
[0:37] brother bram's the word brother bram's
[0:38] the word but brother Bram said I'm not
[0:40] the word I'm not the word I'm a man but
[0:44] you see he uses this body because he
[0:46] died to sanctify this body that he might
[0:48] use it and give a gift just like pulling
[0:51] it out of gear then the Holy Spirit
[0:53] takes over next in the signs of his
[0:55] coming 1962 brother R said Jesus was the
[0:58] word and brother said we have to
[1:00] approach God through the word the word
[1:03] comes to the prophets they're not the
[1:05] word notice brother Bram said the
[1:06] prophets are not the word Christ is the
[1:09] word brother BR list Elijah Moses all
[1:11] the great prophets they wasn't the word
[1:14] then he says it again they wasn't the
[1:15] word but Jesus was the word now watch he
[1:19] was the word see not Jesus he just said
[1:22] this because he was the word but to us
[1:25] we have to approach God through the word
[1:28] see the the word comes to the prophets
[1:31] they're not the word in Old Testament
[1:34] Elijah Moses all those great prophets
[1:36] they wasn't the word they were the uh
[1:39] they were a perverted body with at the
[1:42] word of God came to the Bible said the
[1:44] word of God come to the prophets they
[1:47] wasn't the word but Jesus was the
[1:49] word hallelujah amen oh I just love
[1:54] that all right in the restoration of the
[1:58] Bride tree 196 2 brother random says
[2:01] we're not the word the word of the Lord
[2:03] came to the prophets they wasn't the
[2:05] word but the word come to them but Jesus
[2:08] was the word again brother Brandon
[2:09] magnifying Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is
[2:12] the fullness of the word now we are not
[2:15] the word the word of the Lord came to
[2:17] the prophets they wasn't the word but
[2:20] the word come to them but Jesus was the
[2:24] word next in Souls that are in prison
[2:27] now brother random said you're a part of
[2:29] God and I am a part of God see but I am
[2:32] not all of God and then brother am
[2:34] quotes the scriptures as Sons adopted by
[2:36] Jesus Christ just as the Bible says in
[2:38] Romans chapter 8 we have received the
[2:41] spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA
[2:44] father you're a part of God and I'm a
[2:47] part of God see but I'm not all of God
[2:49] neither are you all of God see see it's
[2:52] attributes of God upon us as Sons
[2:55] adopted by Jesus Christ which God
[2:57] himself become flesh to die for us
[3:00] lastly from his unfailing words of
[3:02] Promise 1964 brother randam said Jesus
[3:05] was not just a prophet he was God he
[3:08] said the prophets had their part of the
[3:10] word their part of the word the part
[3:12] that was given to them for that age but
[3:14] he Jesus was the fullness of the word he
[3:17] was the word itself how many knows that
[3:20] in the days of his visitation to his on
[3:22] Earth that he was God
[3:26] manifested in in a body called Jes Jesus
[3:30] that was God in a man that's right not
[3:33] just a prophet he was God and the
[3:37] prophets had their part of the word they
[3:39] are part of the word the part was given
[3:42] to them for that age but he was the
[3:44] fullness of the word how many knows that
[3:48] he was the word itself now there is a
[3:51] lotted portion of the word for today is
[3:54] that
[3:55] right that would be him again is that
[3:58] right so that him the same
[4:01] yesterday thank you Lord Jesus for
[4:03] sending us a bible-based prophet the
[4:06] late William brandham Hallelujah to the
[4:08] Lord Jesus
[4:10] Christ amen oh I just love him there's
[4:13] something in my heart just bubbling over
[4:16] how I love the Lord
