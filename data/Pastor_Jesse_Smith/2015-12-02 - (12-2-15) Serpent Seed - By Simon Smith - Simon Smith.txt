tonight just a little basic kind of teacher guy I am um so we're just going to dive into the word of God it's going to be uh little 101 Sunday school so I hope it's all right um but Jess wanted me to do that last Wednesday uh but I felt we felt led to go somewhere else I felt led and uh we went that way and I believe the Lord had his way so amen So today we're gonna uh fulfill brother Jesse's request here just a a simple teaching on the topic of the serpent seed so we're going to pretend like none of us know this Doctrine uh none of us have been taught this Doctrine and that this is brand new fresh um yes 14 years ago when I come to the message and I hear this word and I'm like just overwhelmed with Revelation by the grace of God Amen praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles here to uh Revelations 20 and never started this study right here before but kind of felt led to go this way uh for the start of it Revelations 20 uh verse five and six and then we'll be turned to Matthew 25 Revelations 20 verse 5 says but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished he says this is the first resurrection he says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power amen he says but they shall be Priests of of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so we see here a people uh that are in the first resurrection the Bible calls them blessed and holy absolutely so now let's turn to Matthew 25 amen man Matthew 25 Matthew 25 um we see the great white judgment Throne yes here preached by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Matthew 25:34 he says then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father he says he says inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so here's a people that's not holy but they are blessed absolutely amen now we see here on uh verse 41 then shall he say un unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels so here we see no one blessed here at this portion he said but they are actually cursed this people here so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you God Lord we thank you so much thank Lord for being blessed God lord the Bible says Lord Jesus even said Lord when he was on Earth Lord as the Bible says in the days of his flesh God he taught his disciples and said blessed are your eyes and blessed your ears for they see and hear Lord God and Lord Here We Stand Lord tonight Lord being amongst that that crowd God Lord blessed in both areas God and Lord Jesus we love you so much Lord for allowing us to hear this message Lord to receive this word in this last hour Lord I was caught in a denominational cage God myself Lord and Lord you you came and uh had a man with a key God and opened up Lord and Lord Jesus Lord I feel like an eagle flying God lord and Lord Jesus Lord Lord as I mature God Lord my little head feathers are getting from black into white God lord yes Lord the American Eagle Lord Jesus God lord lord we just want to fly as high as we can godu never take our eyes off the sun Lord yes and Lord build our nests Lord in high places away from where the devils and demons cannot touch us Lord hallelujah any doubt Lord we love you so much Lord thank you for tonight Lord bless the hearers Lord of this little simple study God In The Name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord Saints may have their seats um so Overjoyed to hear our brother here is H decided to attend here now by the grace of God so God bless you just finally met your wife there said H at least right here so praise the Lord uh we just want to get into this little study here I was I've been working with a gentleman named uh Derek Adams I love that last name and then I remember uh didn't remember but I found out recently that he lives on the seventh street so and he's actually uh we I was working with him today and I told him I was going to be here and he's actually live streaming tonight I just wanna I just pray I just uh may God bless him hope this goes out to as a blessing to him and his son if they be watching right now God and we were talking there's a gentleman at my job here and he used to be a Christian but he is no longer a Christian he no longer holds the name of Jesus Christ in high regard he will no longer stand for the gospel and years and years ago 70 years ago when I first met him on the job he was telling me he says he says oh yes I'm a Christian I'm a this and that absolutely I go to such and such church amen blah blah two years ago we come and meet again at a job site and uh he says he says Simon he's ah he's gives me a hard time you know uh he says I'm not a Christian anymore uh list and this and he said he said let me tell you why and he tells me a little story here he said he said Simon he says I have some children he says I've got a couple grown boys he said and no matter what those boys do no matter what them boys would do whether they'd steal he says whether he said they would murder someone he says whether they rape this or they do whatever they whatever the worst worst sin committed he says he says he says me being their father he says I could never ever send them to hell and he said how can God being a god of full love uh being a God that has all mercy and Grace and for knowledge and this and that how can he send those how can he send some of his children to hell and I had the answer at the tip of my tongue right and I said brother you've never been taught the scripture correctly amen wow he said oh this and this and he would never let me get get into it but I said you you just you've Fallen back because of lack of knowledge the Bible says hose 46 he says because of lack of knowledge my people perish absolutely so we want to dive into this and and and and and I know we all know these things but we want to for our brother here we want to rehash these things so here in Revelations 20 we see a people that is blessed and holy that were able to partake in the first resurrection absolutely that's right he said but these are not the same people here we see in Matthew 25 for here there's a group of people and the Bible says the Good Shepherd here will divide as as a shepherd He will divide them as sheep and as goats absolutely one on the right hand and one on the left the one on the right obviously received and says and the Bible says they are just blessed absolutely right and a and are able to walk into eternal life now here on the left here we have a group of people that are typed as goats and they are cursed absolutely so we want to we want to take this Avenue here tonight um we've taught this my I feel bad for my wife here she sat through this Bible study couple hundred times here as we you know kitchen tables you know just teaching 101 just driving it down and just trying you know takes if you actually go through this entire study it's about three what four or five hours you could go going verse by verse by verse by verse absolutely you know taking uh obviously coming up for breast of air absolutely by the grace of God so we want to guide want to dive into this let's go to Psalms 37 hit a little bit here and hopefully we can at least get through the foundation tonight praise God so I know in the church age book uh it's written he pulls from Revelations 3 as we turn to Psalms 37 and he says he says he says they are the Bible says in Revelations 3 the uh the leosan church AG says they are miserable and when he hits that word miserable he says he these are vessels of pity right he says have pity on them I don't he says I don't care how rich they are paraphrasing he says I don't care how rich they are how big their churches are any this and that he says they are vessels of pity he says don't envy them at all he says just have pity on them no matter what they do to you have pity on them absolutely amen absolute Psalms 37 verse uh 20 uh 21 beautiful the Bible says the wicked Borth and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth for such as as be the Blessed of him that inherit the Earth says and they shall be cursed of him and and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off he says the steps of the good man are ordered by the Lord and He delighteth in the way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth his him with his hand absolutely so here's a curse he says and there are those that are steps the good man absolutely once again we see them together located in the scripture together absolutely now um you don't have to go there uh but let's turn to Genesis no actually let's turn to Genesis 1 I'm sorry but Numbers 22 when balum tried to curse the children of Israel God pretty much came down and and and told him no and balum told the king he says he says you cannot uh curse what's blessed and you can't bless what's cursed absolutely he says what God's done is done and is finished absolutely I can do no more absolutely that's right so we want to see where this blessing and cursing uh where this thing came from because the Bible says they were cursed that's past tense he says they were blessed he said that was past tense absolutely right so it had to come somewhere it had to start somewhere and of course we want to go to Genesis the origin the gene seed chapter absolutely now in Genesis 1 the first day what light came forth right absolutely uh we know that's the I believe the logos there now in day two it says now he brings the firmament he separates the waters and this and that so we want to find a location where the first thing that's blessed is blessed we find that in day five now in day five God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life right he says the foul that may fly above in the earth he says in the open firment he says and God created the whales also see so here he's bringing the birds and the whales everything right in day five absolutely but now it's notice in verse 22 he says and God blessed them absolutely so here we see the very first thing that's blessed absolutely that's right and we see it's the birds the Eagles uh even the vultures whatever he said and then it's the fish of the sea the whales everything those things are blessed absolutely now we as we enter and leave the we leave the fifth day going into the sixth day notice in verse 24 and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind the cattle the creeping thing he says and the Beast of the Earth Earth after his kind and it was so verse 25 and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and after that after everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God s it was good notice he placed no blessing upon these these people or like upon these animals absolutely right the the dog uh the cat the the the goat uh the Sheep whatever there's no blessing put on any of these animals absolutely natural b or not boty but just natural life absolutely absolutely they have Flesh and Blood like we do absolutely that live that don't are not in a firmament we don't they don't uh they don't fly in the air uh the fish pretty much fly in the water kind of he said but these are those that are dwelling and confined by gravity I say like that that walk on their little feet my grandpa Garza he was a full Mexican and you see a cat and he call it four feet he get those four feet away from me call it four foot because they had four feet that's right no hands just feet absolutely now but now as we continue in the sixth day he says verse 26 now he's moved some to something more personal and God said let us make man in our image he says after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air absolutely I have to repent here real quick I forgot to call my brother John Graham who is going to be listening in thank you my goodness that's slipped see how forgetful I am my goodness my wife has is pretty much my secretary I must been the Lord there I was we we were teaching here amen amen I apologize praise God brother John Amen brother all right I actually forgot but we're we're dialing in you now is that all right okay all right brother God bless you have mercy now in verse 26 God said let us make man in our image after our likeness he says Let There have dominion over the fish of the seene above the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth right he says and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth now in verse he goes and God created man in his own image in verse 28 he says and God blessed them so we see the original blessing of those in Revelations 20 and the those sitting on the right hand in Matthew 25 absolutely so here are these people that are on the right hand of Christ those that have went and taken part of the first resurrection they had to be right here in this group absolutely they had to be because look look the Bible says and God blessed them and God s to be fruitful and multiply and replace the Earth and SED do it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth absolutely so we want to establish that we see the first blessing here in Genesis this goes to what the Sons and Daughters of God absolutely absolutely and as God did the creating he went from uh lower forms of life all the way up to what we are the peak and Pinnacle or the very image expressed that was in his mind uh we are direct descendants of God himself Absolut look at Matthew absolutely you'll see we that Adam was of God ABS what a lineage oh my amen that's right praise God nowah so in finding these things we find the Bless but now we want to do a little uh investigation and try and find uh uh where the curse are now we know uh of course we're pretending like we don't know any of these things um so we're going to dive in is is if I was sitting here at a kitchen table or standing at a kitchen table teaching someone this Doctrine for the first time or this word of God for the first time I'd say is a brother or sister or however I'd like to take you to Genesis um two here and I want to examine exactly where he put his son of God at absolutely he says now in Genesis 2 and verse 8 and the Lord kind of opened up another study I might be teaching for uh my pastor back home brother cim um and it has to do um with this scripture right here Genesis 2:8 he says and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward and Eden if you search the message and look East Side just type in East in this you'll find something amazing he says and there he put the man whom he had formed and on the ground he says now he says now look he says he's putting him in this Garden of Eden he says it's it's planted right here is in out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to sight and good for food so here's all the these trees that is good for food for Adam he says they're Pleasant sight they're nice to look at whatever he says he says and they're good for food and then we see what a semicolon right absolutely this is 101 right he says he says semicolon represents a separation so now God is teaching through the word of God and laying this out for his son and said he says look he says these trees are good he says eat from these right he says he then then of course the Holy Ghost uh inspired uh maybe translators of the scripture put a semicolon in here he says which means a separation and then it says he says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of n are good evil absolutely so these trees are separate from those trees which grow out of the ground which come from what seed form right you plant them in the ground and they grow up and they they little tassels or or stalks or whatever then they come out and form branches and then there's leaves and then there's fruit off them absolutely now these are those on the left side there but here on the right side of the scripture he say the tree of life in the M the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil absolutely so here we see the two trees absolutely now if I was teaching this to someone I would say now now brother brother sister now when I first heard this and I teach it the way I was taught because this makes the this is the clearest path that I can see absolutely now he asked me a question I just gotten out of college I did not fully graduate absolutely because God dealt with me in away and broke me totally allowed my he allowed me to destroy my life absolutely and then he called me to this word so here this brother asked me he said brother Simon he says now what do you think these trees are he says what is the tree of life and what is the tree of knowledge of G and I'm thinking you know in my little College brain and knowing a little bit about nature and trees I used to climb back in my grandma's house you know whatever I thought the tree of life it must be the Evergreen because the ever oh yeah oh yeah yeah I'm revelated that's right he says the tree of the the the Evergreen right it's stays green year round It Never Dies oh man I thought I had it I said I got it I told him he said brother that's very nice that's very educated guess he said but that's not it and I sat there and I thinking I said what that's not the tree of life he said no he goes let's go and see what the word says I was like and now you couldn't I I mean every devil in hell could not anointed me to sleep that night that's right I was right there God knows if if you know me I I don't have a problem sleeping yeah but that night I was wide awake and my eyes were peel peeled and my ears were right there just like my dogs when the ears Point like this not like this right in front they're ready now we want to go and look at what these trees are absolutely what is a tree in the scripture we know like that this that the Bible says uh pretty much not that the b in a way the Bible says the word interprets itself absolutely when the word came down in flesh he interpreted the word absolutely that's right that's right and the Bible says the word of God always comes to what the prophets Daniel 222 uh Amos 37 right absolutely now so what are what do trees represent and maybe we can find out what these trees were absolutely so we're want to go through this now let's go to Psalms uh one and this is one of the scriptures that brother taught me he says he took me to here is Psalms one so now it's not it's not an evergreen tree a fully Green Tree or round whatever uh now I'm trying to think and think and then he hits his scripture here in Psalms 1 verse one he says blessed is the man that walketh not after the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners he says nor sth in the seat of the scornful he says but his Delight shall be in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night I'm think okay it's here we go okay all right now then he is verse three and I'm like what are you serious yes he says and he shall be planted like a tree planted by he said he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bring forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf no typing what a man has a tree he says he says and bring forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so here he shows me the very first scripture and if you run you know Old Testament New Testament it's all the way through a man is a type of a tree absolutely that's right now as far as I know and the way was born I did not was not a seed planted into the ground and I did not grow up out of the ground with a little little stalk or whatever a root or whatever he says but I was born through a woman absolutely that's right absolutely so I could not come of could not be describing a man as far as the trees that grow out of the ground are good for food absolutely now he says verse four he says the ungodly are not so he says but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away he says wherefore therefore the ungodly shall stand in the J judgement nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous uh but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish so here he brings it once again two sets of people one they both typed his tree one is blessed and the other one is not so blessed they come up in the Judgment under judgment I wonder if they would be the cursed ones my come on yes Lord now Psalms 37 he took me and he ran me all the way through psalms now we're not going to hit every single scripture tonight obviously uh this is a three four hour Bible study and even longer if you want to get super super deep and have hit every angle and every kind of way you can now Psalms 37:34 he says wait on the Lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to the to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off Thou shalt see it notice the Bible says the wicked are cut off absolutely when John the Baptist came into the scene he says he says he says I'm take the axe to the root absolutely absolutely Christ said the same thing in a way he says so they're taking the axe to the root absolutely he says what they're cut off he says uh he says and I have seen the wicked in great power he says spreading himself like a Green Bay Tree absolutely so here uh uh David types the the evil or the wicked as a Green Bay Tree absolutely so here we see even the wicked as types what of tree I know this is 101 absolutely servac SE that's right Psalms 52 beautiful beautiful absolutely very simple absolutely but now as he's teaching me this my eyes are like no way and I've been chewing on this for 14 years regurgitation and just gurita and urita and just chewy and cheu ification absolutely that's right that's what we do that's right because why this is this is still mean to me it never gets old abolutely that's right and you can still go through the scripture and find more and more openings more and more Avenues and way to teach this right absolutely Psalms 52 verse he says verse uh seven he says lo this is the man that hath not strength not God his strength but trusteth in the abundance of his riches and strengthen himself in his wickedness he says but look David says he says he says a man who trusts in money trusted in this and that he said they Wicked man he says he says but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God SS of God where did they get oil for the lamb yeah absolutely right showing what he says he he says I got oil in me he says I'm Dove material that's right totally letter the Holy Ghost as they take on Giants absolutely that's right praise be to God he says I trust he says in the mercy of God forever and ever absolutely right amen that's right he is a green olive tree absolutely he say I guarantee the fruits were shown absolutely that's right absolutely and Pastor buyers would come up and take of the fruits and says man I like this David guy that's right yes amen that's right so here typed as what a tree again absolutely Psalm we'll have one more and we'll move on Psalms 92 uh don't have the time to drive Nails in the coffins tonight or to clench or whatever but we're just hitting uh highlights I'm sure brother Jesse has all these dialed in already Psalms 92 verse 12 he says the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar and Lebanon he says those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God absolutely that's right notice he types them was what planted right in the churches absolutely that's where you're supposed to grow what through the watering of the word of God absolutely so this is a this is a little Congregation of trees tonight absolutely that's right that's right amen if we want to be Trees of Righteousness absolutely that's right praise God that's right so here we see now he runs me through these I'm thinking oh my goodness a man is a type of a tree and he runs this and he runs this through continues in the Old Testament this and this this and I'm like man's type of the tree my goodness all right then he asked me again brother what do you think the tree of life is and now I had moved from my Defiance colge education remember I was a science major yes bio education yeah going to teach like brother J but God said no teaching natural now I teach spiritual right so now I'm thinking it's not an evergreen tree they're not cones he says they do not prick you he says but I'm thinking it must be Jesus Christ he said brother that's right and now now your own now thoughts are really running spiritual thoughts not from the educational thoughts now let's continue on here now let's go to Genesis 3 again verse 22 I hope my friend uh Derek there is en enjoying the little study here amen just taking you a walk through Genesis what the original sin was uh and who are these two sets of people Genesis 2 I'm sorry Genesis 3 I'm sorry apologize and he took me to the scripture here Genesis 3 and22 he said the Lord God said behold man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now let he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever and he said brother this has to be Jesus Christ I said now how are you you're pretty sure he said yes absolutely he says he says look he says this tree if if we can literally go back 6,000 years from now and get next to Adam and move him out of away a little bit and we actually could say go let me let me get this tree of life if we could go back 6,000 years if we could partake of the tree of life then the Bible says we could live forever what have eternal life I said really he said yes he says look at the scripture I was like okay says well I thought there was only one way to eternal life exactly he said well here we have the tree of life and I thought Jesus Christ was it and I said oh now I understand I see what because Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes under the father except through me this has to be the tree of life is Jesus Christ absolutely now you don't have to turn there in John 6 35-48 the Bible says that Jesus is the bread of life now in Acts 3:15 it says the Bible says he is the Prince of Life he says in 1 John 1:1 he says the Bible says he is the word of life right absolutely John 14:6 Jesus said what we said before he says I am the way the truth and the life he says in Genesis 3 and22 he is the Tree of Life absolutely he is life however you want to bring it he is life you bring anything as it him he is life absolutely right he's the oil of our life absolutely right he's the husband of our life absolutely right he is everything he is life John one absolutely that's right now so we know there's only one form of life uh uh he there's a whole bunch of scriptures 1 John 51-13 you have to go there uh Romans 6 uh 23 Romans 5 and 21 dealing and showing that Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life absolutely that's right so we have pinpointed for sure through scripture uh through type and we obviously we skip tried 10 15 20 more scriptures on men typed as trees we can go to Daniel and show Nebuchadnezzar was that great tree absolutely and the the fouls of the year dwelt and branched in that tree absolutely he says and everything was blessed while underneath that tree absolutely and then the Bible says that God cut that tree down absolutely and he go into the the the Wilderness and ate like an ax right absolutely grew little eagle feathers or whatever how it was either claws or whatever absolutely he was just like that right but he was a type of a great tree absolutely that's right now he said now he said let's dial let's just move on we have identified the tree now if this be a tree if this be tree be a person yeah and the B and all trees are it's like this that are good he says they'll have fruit on them what are the fruit what is the fruit of Jesus Christ absolutely let's let's let's look at that today now let's go to Galatians 5 real simple absolutely glory and you're going to see something about one of these fruits that's very very powerful Saints and it's the fruit that only in this age will stand okay yes Glory now now uh Galatians 5 I'm sure we all know what we're we're aiming at here Galatians 5 and uh 22 he says but the fruit of the spirit what Jesus Christ and spirit for he says is love his joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law is this all the fruits of the spirit yes no it's not this is not all the fruits of the spirit because all of these can be mimicked all these can be imitated and you will not be able to tell who's who yeah remember Christ come on the scene and the priest was there who looked like the real Christian who looked like uh who looked like the Messiah the old kind priest and just helped you out and you know a wink or whatever just whatever need a bill pay you know blessing all the children whatever or Christ that comes in the temple and whips the temple beat the Changers of money right who look like the real one was that the love I thought he loved us Absolut I thought God is a god of love absolutely yes that's not all the fruits and if you understand the word of God like we do we know that that was real love correction is love AB judgment is love absolutely right now let's look at the rest the remainder of the fruits and you're going to see a fruit that the others cannot imitate they can get really really close like we tght last Wednesday if you remember the end of the service right shibo and sio right one h they were off on the word by one H one letter yes right amen now let's go to Ephesians 5 and here's where it's revealed a fruit and it's the very last fruit because Jesus said if you continue in my word yes Ephesians 5 and verse eight he says for for ye were sometimes Darkness but now ye are light in the Lord walk as is Children of light right he says for the fruit of the spirit is all goodness and righteousness and truth yes the r the one fruit of the spirit that can never be imitated is truth amen absolutely that's right now to just cap on that just for a second turn to John 8 and we'll run through a little bit here saints of God you don't know how blessed you are we will even even I wonder if in through eternity if what really understand how blessed we are I mean when we get there it's going to be out of control anyhow but through eternity it will never ever get old it'll continue to grow and our joy will be expounded even more absolutely thank God we won't be in these little flesh bodies they'll explode absolutely but we'll have what uh spoken word bodies absolutely that's right glorified bodies now John 8 verse 31 now he's dealing with the scribes and Pharisees here uh Sadducees whoever he says verse 31 then said Jesus to those those Jews which believe me if you continue in my word word right he says then ye are my disciples not if you just hear a good message or a good Doctrine and you you get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and fall away in two years or year whatever that's not continuing in the word what the truth is to continue in truth absolutely that's right even when at this hour truth may look like Antichrist absolutely or not accepted like our holy rer absolutely now in John 8 verse 37 he says I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you absolutely there's nowhere to put it in them absolutely they they can ex they can take it in but where does it sit where does it lie where does it where does it actually seal there's no place to seal it they have no place for it he says and I speak that which I have seen of your father and you did which you have seen of your father absolutely now jump to uh verse 4 three he says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word look at that absolutely truth they cannot handle it they cannot be settled on the truth they will not continue in absolutely now let's jump back off that for a little bit here by the grace of God now let's continue on here so we know the what the tree of life is Jesus Christ absolutely we know the fruits of the spirit love joy peace kindness and what and of course the last one the most important or whatever is truth absolutely it's right absolutely because God is truth all truth lies in his word absolutely now so now he's he's going through the study with me so we've established this now who is the tree he didn't say what but he says who is the tree of knowledge in Good and Evil and I said well that can only be one there can only be one that's what Satan absolutely that's right and we know that is Satan now let's look at the the the uh let's look at the the similarities here in the scripture let's let's go to Genesis 3 back to Genesis 3 here where the original sin took place praise God Genesis 3 Verse 6 amen now the woman had started talking to this creature but notice the effect it had on the woman he says and the woman Genesis 3 and6 he says and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes it was beautiful right he says and a tree to desire to make one wise notice in this tree she found wisdom and Beauty right now brought out through the message of the hour this brother and I was brought up in this way he showed me he said brother he says now keep that in mind he says we're looking at wisdom and Beauty look at look at the characteristics look at that right and he takes me of course to Ezekiel 28 absolutely he says let's turn to Ezekiel 28 amen praise the Lord sure amen and now we had another mind blow as I'm sitting here through this study at two or three or one o'clock in the morning whatever this was I know it was late yeah and he starts reading this here Ezekiel 28:1 and the moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and he said look he says he's talking to the king absolutely and I'm think okay and he said to me thus sayith the Lord God thou seal us the sum full of wisdom right he says and perfect in Beauty he says look he says the tree of knowledge G evil and I'm thinking the king of Tyrus man this has to be a couple at least a couple thousand years after Adam and Eve I'm pretty sure if I could trace this thing back if you run the archaeology back I'm sure it's a couple thousand but now look what he says he says Thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God Amen and I'm reading this for the first time and I'm thinking my goodness he was it's the word the king of Tyrus was there my what a king no wonder he's a king he's had 3,000 years to get there he's G outlive everybody even the other king whoever was now so he looking he's bringing this he says thou has been in Eden the Garden of go every precious stone was thy covering he the Sardis the topaz the diamond the bur onx The Jasper uh uh the sapphire he says the emerald the carok and gold he say workmanship of th TS look he says Not only was this King that he says but he says the workmanship of thy tabberts and thy pipes was prepared in thee the day that I was C look he was the song leader in heaven also he was the song leader then he brings this verse 14 and reveals it he says he says Thou Art the anointed cherub he said brother look the prophet catches the inspiration of God and he goes up to the king and says thus sayith the Lord he says what took place here he says Satan himself the spirit has incarnated himself into the king and now by the wisdom of God the discernment of God through the prophet comes up and discerns who is in this man notice he says notice he says the two characteristics wisdom and Beauty amen beautiful same tree Satan himself and he's just a cherub that's it right absolutely he says Thou Art the anointed cherub what proving that Satan was in the Garden of Eden right then it placed him specifically there in time and in scripture absolutely he says and thou verse 15 he says thou has perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created till iniquity is found in thee he says now he says uh um verse 17 he says thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty notice the fall what caused the fall here Pride because he was beautiful absolutely that's right and and that's why the systems of this day everything is looking for beauty absolutely that's right absolutely absolutely we'll get through that in a little bit he says thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of thy brightness because of beauty because he thought so much of a some his wisness his wisdom went off the beaten path it went from the straight to narrow the way which is Christ and took his own way absolutely he says he says therefore he says he says and by the iniquity of thy traffic absolutely there amen now so he brings this to me and he shows me look he says this tree of knowledge good and evil is Satan scripturally here it places him absolutely that he was there he was the one that caused the fall I was like oh my amen oh my I was like Amen brother praise God absolutely wonderful then he said now let's continue on here and we'll see where he went to to do this Isaiah 14 we all know this Isaiah 14 verse 12 and notice another under another Prophet inspiration comes from God discernment straight from the throne comes out yes and he calls out this man who is is let's see uh maybe it's just a prophecy he says verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground look yes he was that tree he was cut down to the ground absolutely that's right he has no power he's not standing on anything anymore absolutely he's on sinking sand absolutely he says Thou are cut down to the ground which did weaken us the Nations he says for thou has said in thine heart he says I will Ascend into heaven he says I will exalt my throne above the stars of God why is everything I I I in this age iPhone iPad I do uh I everything I this I that I whatever absolutely he even even certain groups have symbols that are the ey hold on he says I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north absolutely now this brother later on a master master teacher came in he said he said let let's examine this he says he says look he says the sides of the north absolutely and he went to the Hebrew now a lot of the ordinances of this day have been they've switched the meetings over yeah but if you go get an old coordinance maybe at a Salvation Army or somewhere where you can get an old one maybe the internet or whatever uh Amazon or or um what's the other eBay he says you get an old one and you can take these words back sides that word sides in the Hebrew three 3411 uh 3409 the extreme feminine sides the extreme feminine extreme Parts the thighs loins as the seed of procreation power he's going to the woman yeah how is he going to exalt himself how is he going to bring what uh uh I like like this his children down uh um that word North and the Greek I me sorry in the Hebrew 6828 to 6845 it's the hidden places so he's going to the feminine he's going to the seed of procreation power that's how he's going to accomplish his entire thing that's how he's going to be worshiped that's how he's going to exalt his throne because to exalt your throne you have to have somebody underneath you to worship you absolutely so in seed of God will not worship the devil knowing it absolutely maybe deceived AB but knowing it absolutely not so he has to form his own people I say it we say like that absolutely we will make it plain here soon absolutely so here he went to the sides of the north absolutely verse 14 he I'll send above the heights of the clouds I will be most like he I will be like the most high yet Christ says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit absolutely that's right now in verse 19 but thou are cast out of thy grave like an abominable Branch one once again typing Satan as a tree absolutely that's right all the way through real really simple absolutely M that's right the word of God interprets itself absolutely now so here we see Satan is the the the tree of knowledge in Good and Evil now what would be the fruit on Satan we went through the fruit the fruits of the spirit of Jesus Christ kindness love peace all these things right now so what is the fruit let's go to Proverbs Proverbs one Proverbs 1 verse 28 then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me my for they for that they hated knowledge they hated knowledge they wouldn't hear it and did not choose the fear of the Lord that they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof therefore shall they eat the fruit of Their Own way amen absolutely so what is the fruit of this tree is Going Your Own Way doing your own thing taking a thought on the word of God and just going any way you want absolutely living your life any kind of way absolutely that's the way of the tree of knowledge and good and evil that's one of the fruits of it absolutely he says you shall eat the fruit of your own way and be filled with their own devices oh my for the Turning Away of the simple shall slay them look and the prosperity fools shall destroy them Prosperity why be careful Saints m proverbs 10 yes look at the fruit of that tree my proverbs 10 he says the labor Proverbs 10:16 he says the labor of the righteous tendeth to sin oh sorry tendeth to life but the fruit of the wicked to sin absolutely that's right real simple I know now Hosea the book of Hosea praise God the word of God Is Right the greatest the greatest book ever written it's a mystery book amen Hosea 10 verse 12 he says sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in Mercy break up your fatle ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and Reign righteousness upon you that's and that's the letter R we're waiting for right there Saints he says ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity you have eaten the fruit of Lies amen absolutely because thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy Mighty Men so here we see also a fruit what the fruit of Lies absolutely it's right your own way and lies absolutely everything even counted right there that's the fruit how tempting amen my goodness and of course let's go to proverbs 30 and this brother brought this when he was teaching me proverbs 30:20 and he said ' brother no scripture is put in here for vain there is none of the word of God that's just thrown in there for per chance for whatever however you want to look at it he says everything has a meaning everything has a reason behind it all words every action has a spirit behind it absolutely that's right every creation everything man makes has a spirit behind it absolutely that's right proverbs 30 and 20 and he said brother let's read this why would God put this in here he says for such is the way of an adulterous woman continue on here by the grace of God uh now let us go to Revelations 20 hit one scripture and we're dialing back we'll hopefully cover the foundation here tonight I don't even know what time started 73 who almost an hour is everybody okay we're hour in yes sir yes sir we'll just we'll see if we can Ram slam this a little bit here if we can by the grace of God sir yes sir that work you at work I used to work with a guy and his favorite saying was when we were going to tackle a project and he said we call it Ram slam and I like it because it's sheep it's you know what they do just take your head just Hammer ramam let's get it done dve back the enemy am she the ram Jesus Christ born under the ram amen amen so now Revelations 20 verse one and I saw an angel come down from from Heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand he laid hold on the dragon he says look he says that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years so here in the scripture here at the very end it calls him what that old serpent when we mean when it is old it means ancient or or or or even from the beginning absolutely that's right so let's go back there and now we we know the Trees of Life the Trees of n Gena we know the fruits that lie on them but now we need to look at the vehicle right that Satan used yes and here when I was the Lord sent me out to the mountains and the White Mountains there and I climbed those and I I was out there for three days God arranged orchestrated the entire thing set me up to witness to one man in a in a barn at the end of three days I find myself in the upper room of a barn I had no idea what was doing I just wet with thus say the Lord I believe now I know it is but and I was witnessing to him and I hit him up with sin here and I said brother why can't they find the missing link why can't they find it scientists so intelligent man they've got excavators that can pull tons and tons of dirt at a time they cannot find it they cannot even find anything that links man with animal uh even animal different kinds of animals they can't find any links them why can't they find it and I said because God changed it and he saids hold on I gotta go to bathroom and we just walked you know miles and miles and miles up and down in 6,000 feet mountains whatever and he says I go go B he goes downstairs and I'm waiting and I'm waiting because I I met him he's a he's a through hiker I'm waiting he comes back up he said you're not going to believe this those guys downstairs watching TV in The Spar he said I said yeah he goes they're watching something on the original or he said they're watching something on the missing link I said I told you I'm telling you the truth wow praise God praise God God always leaves a witness Saints absolutely right then I said I'm in the world of the Lord that's right what I'm speaking is truth cuz God just backed it up through carnal absolutely right praise be to God absolutely now in Genesis 3 ver1 we're going to find ourselves in the Garden of Eden pre fall we know the two trees are here and they're bearing their fruit yes now what takes place here my my friend Eric if you're with me buddy hang in there verse one he says now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beast of the field which the Lord God had made right right now remember on the sixth day animals were not blessed no right but in the sixth day later on in creation God creates Us in spirit form and he blessed us but here this animal here is not blessed he's not a it calls him a serpent a beast he was not a fish or a whale coming out of the water and he was not an eagle that fly down and talk to him but he was a serpent a beast and not and something very very special about this Beast now the serent was more subtle that word subtle means subtle crafty Sly Artful manlike right absolutely he says then any of the beasts what he was a natural animal right think animal right a real you got your picture of your dog you got your picture of your horse this was in God's eyes no difference right right remember I'm teaching you for the first time you've ever heard this he says of the field which the Lord God had made now look at what this animal can do he says and he said unto the woman this Beast can talk right he can speak he has a vocal cords he has a mouth and a tongue and a teeth like ours they can form words he can form the spoken word he can reiterate the spoken word my and he knows how to strike up a conversation he says ye shall shall we eat of every tree of the garden any nowhere to go to remember if Satan has incarnated this beast and he said I'm going to the sides of the north look he's at the sides of the north right now that's right he says you shall eat of every tree of the garden and notice the woman was not startled uh was not Star Struck was not kind of uh and Eve shuddered or Eve was like oh get away from me you it was just like a regular old conversation like we're picking up maybe at the end of their conversation uh just getting a little spiritual let's move into the word brother sister absolutely amen he says he says and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the Trees of the field of the garden he says but of the fruit which of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat it lest she touch it uh lest she died right and the servant said the woman ye shall not surely die what the first SL we know these things right absolutely so here she is talking with an animal a brute Beast a beast named what a serpent at this time he was not as what you would think a snake that goes on the ground absolutely he says or one that could shed his skin and had no legs and no arms but this was thing was upright and a spoke like a man it sounded like a man and they knew the word of God absolutely it's right where did he get this knowledge because if you to Genesis 2 you only see God talking to Adam yeah right where did he get this knowledge the tree of nil must have been near or within vocal range of the Tree of Life speaking with uh another Tree of Life Adam he says and he must have overheard and knew the word of God and he said okay now I know he was a little secret agent maybe and that invisible tree went and what and now we see him go and incarnate himself into an animal amen now remember we know Satan is full of wisdom in his mind whether he I don't know he's a spiritual being he cannot with any of us without the Holy Ghost right without the Holy Ghost we're powerless with we're finite absolutely and somehow he figured this out that he needed to get hold of the serpent he did not bring a horse he did not bring my little puppy dog that's right he did not bring a chicken or or something else any other creature but he specifically brought because what it could communicate right and there was something else about it absolutely now verse six of Genesis 3 and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasantly eyes and a tree desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and she did it not eat now look they took they took what she believed the lies oh this and that whatever she believed the lies and we know through what the scripture here in verse 13 Genesis 3: 13 and the Lord God said unto the woman what is it thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat that word beguiled in the Hebrew means to seduce utterly morally that's right so what took place s god let's just make it plain there was a absolute a seduction a seducing that took place in the Garden of Eden Brother s that's pretty crazy that's crazy talk let's go see now verse seven and the eyes of both them were opened and he knew that they were naked they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons right now they've sinned right they've taken they they've sinned they've Fallen absolutely now and look he says and they show they they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons because they realized they were naked brother sister tonight uh uh those watching however wherever he says you are clothed with clothing absolutely covering what the part that had sinned absolutely how come they did not make little mouth coverings why but it said they wrapped themselves around because they were naked they realized they used the parts that were used uh to sin they covered those because they were totally defiled now absolutely it was what a seduction absolutely now yes and we know these things right and now the Judgment hit now here's where the danger comes with this this is why the preacher the guy behind this thing right here this guy right here guy right here and I heard this brother right here are in the most dangerous positions in the world the levels of hell right civil and then what ecclesiastical the lowest the lowest of the lows of in hell will be what false creatures because everything notice the Judgment of God Adam right has thou eaten he goes to the man first right right and something particular he said go Adam said he says he says it it was the woman that you gave me he charged God and God said that's right said you got me there he says so I'm gonna bypass you brother son right right right and then notice notice how God's going to judge this is Judgment Day Jud this is how we're going to judge Saints because the Bible says what the Saints shall judge the earth right this is how we'll judge why do you do this well this person did that and then in judgment will go to that person will say Eve why did you eat of this tree and then you'll say it was the servant and now what the false priest prach is on the Judgment circuit absolutely the righteous the righteous will be Scot free absolutely because they're on the right hand they were already blessed just deceived absolutely but now we see the Judgment all falls lying on the false Preacher serp Brother what gave you the right to get behind that Pulpit you T you taught something false and you caus this you caus this the fall you cause a spill absolutely amen now so we're looking for those that are cursed right verse 14 and the Lord God said un the serpent we've seen the Blessed they're blessed and the Lord God said un the serpent because thou has de us Thou Art cursed above all cattle that's why in the sixth day God never blessed any of them because he knew by for knowledge the curse would have to fall on this absolutely it could not bless it why would then that also too why would the sacrifices be animals animals animals couldn't bless it they'd have to partake what of the curse absolutely he says because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field he says upon the belly shalt thou go notice the change the body change took here that's right and now the serpent they could talk they could walk that was a man he says now he goes his shoulders were taken off his arms he lost his legs he's a he was in the wrong War he's a wounded soldier but he ain't going to get none to be honest street right he says now he just goes like a snake now the serpent has become what we know as a snake today right absolutely that's right but something peculiar happened during the sin during this adulterous Affair something was planted now verse 15 he says and he speaking see serpent still in the Judgment see and the Stars still speaking to the serpent he says and I will put any imity which means a hatred he says between thee and the woman he says and between thy seed and when I was being taught this the first time and now the enlightenment hits right yeah and and and for me the tears kind of start behind the eyes your face gets a little flush a little warm and you realize what's being said amen with much knowledge com much sorrow pleas right that's right that's right yeah and now we've entered the saddest Doctrine you could ever utter before a congregation you're teaching the saddest uh a study you could ever teach you're telling me that some of these people that I grew up with that may even be in my family right co-workers right every person I've ever met in my entire life life is one or the other yes yes that's true and I'm sitting there and I'm going through this study and I'm thinking God be kidding me the most Sublime moment in my life was after this study Saints yeah amen it's still affects me today yeah because we this is not this is not a this is not a Mormon thing okay where we just kind of hope that the seven or you know the nine plates are whatever this ain't a job's witness thing what but this is reality amen amen this is inspired word of God 66 books and we're bringing a Doctrine and we can bring this thing from Genesis to Revelations it's realen and not only that but it was been hidden yes for 2,000 years Saints AB yes no other people before us Einstein never got a chance to hear this that's right that great man Tindale never got hear this John hus never got to hear thisen Luther Wesley and we get to hear this the great ones right six of the seven Messengers to the church ages never heard this oh and there I'm sitting in 2001 hearing it I'll put enity between thy seed and her seed the serpent had Seed where planted in her right animal and a daughter of God came together right and now something's going to come forth that's never been there it was not in the original creation right we know we know in nature the female is more beautiful than the male that's right I'm sorry the male is more beautiful than the female nature so the serpent is the male of the species the most beautiful of the serpent probably the highest one best one serpent you could find sure goes incarnates and finds the most beautiful in the human race because in the human race God did it backwards right the man's not as beautiful as the female right the female holds the beauty and now Look Beauty and beauty not Beauty and semi Beauty no Beauty and Beauty Satan's he sees he sees a match wowow my goodness absolutely right he says and it shall bruise thy head and thou sh bruise it shall bruise thy heel AB the type of Christ right so here we see the serpent has seed right now as he moves from there he curses and now that serpent is cursed right but remember that is an animal it did not have a soul right right yes good that's true if when we judge all those remember what is the first first one we'll judge or how I mean as far as back in time it'll be Cain this serpent will not be there because when these two seeds mingled now the the serpent seed actually come and he had a place for a soul something within the genetics carried it absolutely now he has a place in his soul where he could actually receive God right absolutely now in verse 16 now look at this if this was not an adulterous Affair why would God judge her not curse her but judge her according to this way he says unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow in and thy conception notice reproduction what the size of the north absolutely he says and in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children why is it reproduction why is it this area why is it that right he says and thy desire shall be to thy husband because in the beginning it wasn't it was to another man she eateth and said I've done no wickedness she didn't Adams he's a nice guy yeah I came out of him but this guy's really goodlooking and that guy's really tall and he's Ultra smart he taught me things I didn't know before right he says and thy husband shall rule over her and that's her judgment pain absolutely we know these things and Adam said because thou was hearkened now he's dealing with Adam he says which I commanded thee he says Thou shalt not eat of it curse it as the ground for thy sake and sorrow thou sh eat it he say now he's got to work for his food absolutely now if you remember I don't think this family was here but I had taught a couple months ago on Matthew 13 and I brought Matthew 13 and showed you this all the way through Genesis 1 2 and 3 even up to Enoch's day and we ran the church ages all the way through this and showed you the ground was the ground of the heart amen but go back and get the taper I don't know got any now let's continue on here now we see so we see now notice these are two he says there there he says I will put between thy seed and her seed absolutely he says now in chapter four where is this now here's where people have a problem see look he says well Adam knew his wife right here list that this is actually because remember Moses was the one writing this he was the one that God used to rewrite the first five books of the Bible and Moses had to have seen us either through vision or through uh orally handing it down through the saints of God from Abraham all the way down or whatever but it's probably more a vision because we see it it's aable form it's symbolic and what two books of the Bible that Satan hate the most what Genesis and Revelation all Revelations are symbolic the entire thing is symbolism absolutely and then here in chapter three symbolism we find also as well absolutely hiding the truth absolutely has been covered now yes he says and Adam knew his wife when was this this was Genesis 3:6 when Adam knew his wife he says and she conceived and bear can and said I have gotten a man from Adam no he says she says what from the Lord amen she would not account this to Adam he says and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground absolutely that's right so we see the two seed lines now entwined with one another absolutely now growing up together absolutely uh talking with another fellow shipping and we knew and deep down each one knows there's something different about the other one absolutely that's right that's right now amen now we'll see we still have not we found something that was cursed but we need to find something that will be cursed in what Matthew 25 right he says we know Cain and Abel right and the Bible says in the process of time right he said the brother they were both worshippers right now look at this in verse 24 and he drove out the man and and he placed at the East notice how he said about the East we'll do a study on may he said at the east of the Garden of Eden cherub him every flaming sword and turned every way to keep the Tree of Life a prophet said he said he says when these two brothers went up to worship he says they built their altars at the East Gate what looking for the trying to get a p a peas with the Tree of Life absolutely that's right and we'll maybe explain that later so now here they're at the East Gate here and they brought forth their sacrifices we know right uh one was the fruit of the ground absolutely and the other one was what a bleeding lamb absolutely that's right yes now one was rejected the other one was accepted absolutely uh Cain then we know slew his brother right absolutely verse eight and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass as they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him right and the Lord said to Cain where is Abel th brother he said I said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper absolutely and We Know by the word of God yes we are our brothers and sisters keep bre that's not a true question he says now he says and he said why H has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground he says and now thou are cursed here we go this must be the start of those that must be the start of that sea line that we identified in Matthew 25 the ones that are on the left side that are cursed and says go into Everlasting damnation or hover absolutely they do not receive eternal life absolutely this is the start of it I know this is fresh for you guys right now that's where it all started amen he says he says and now Thou Art curse from the earth and open and which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand he says when thou TST the ground it shall H forth yield uh uh yield under her strength we went through that in Matthew 13 a while back when we taught that now and of course we know this right he says verse 15 and the Lord God said to him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain uh Vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon Cain and we all know that through the teaching of this message that what the mark of the beast is still right among us and one day soon very soon people on the face of the Earth will have will be will given a choice and they will have to choose to accept the mark Or Not to accept the mark right right that Mark of the Beast that Mark is still on that seed line they will always take it that curse is on that seed line it's always with them we know in second Peter it says he calls them curse children right past tense went to right here yes because remember whatever God's cursed is cursed whatever is blessed is blessed you cannot change it it's done in the sixth day he did not bless them so what he could curse one animal in here absolutely bring it to judgment now let's go to verse 16 and I'll read you something here hopefully I won't keep you much much longer here God thank you Jesus this this study takes forever I'm I'm just being honest you know absolutely it's just a long I mean there's just I'm youing it there's I I in my like little Ecom medical showdown in 2003 five or six pastors there wise 40 people here this was the topic that was the issue me versus the world and what the Holy Ghost gave me wisdom shut him up we never went any further and we you know we'll hit that scripture obv I think I've taught that before now now um sorry sorry so I know this is right I we pretty much defeated every Pastor I came up to with this now look what he says here specifically I know brother Jess want to scripture mostly but I want to throw this in here amen he's dealing in the power transformation he says now watch the first thing he done you tell me when you think you got enough CU I'll just stop anywhere he see Cain went out of the presence of the Lord he says there he made his mistake he says then what they'll never go into it again he says he says and there is where you make you you will make a mistake there is where I'll make the mistake the very minute we walk out of the presence of the Lord and he's dealing with this right here this scripture and look what he says now look at verse 16 and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden continually back to the East and we're going to do a study someday maybe whatever we'll we'll hit it and look what the prophet says about that word East he says see how religious it was he says he went around to the east side east side yeah why there's something there yes and you'll be able to run it yes but he said that was a religious move God kicked him out of the garden right Adam everybody Eve right and he placed the angel on the east side of that garden with the sword right covering with and then when C's rejected the marks taken and he's cursed where is he set up shop on the East yes of Eden yes and that's what showing what that seed line will forever be religious that's right wow wow whether they acknowledge Our God or not they're gonna find a religion right They're Gonna Worship somebody yes oh yeah amen it's built in them they could he couldn't even help he just moved there and that's where he set up shot build his first city right absolutely now we're not going to hit that okay saints of God let's start running here um just to let's do about 10 more scriptures and we'll call it good we got Le got the foundation done however and of course we find something interesting here um in Genesis 6 verse one and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth the daughters were born unto them right he says and the sons of God now in modern Bible translations it talks about the me Nephilim calls him the sons of God the Nephilim that what we know through the word the true word of God the King James version right it's not Nephilim but these are sons of God these are not Fallen Angels but these are direct descendants of Adam himself absolutely right Adam Abel Abel taking off the Seth moving on right absolutely and now it comes to Noah's day as direct Son of God he says and they multiply in the face of Earth and the sons of God saw the daughters of men notice not the daughters of God but the daughters of men he says what they taking on what Eve's nature the beauty outside remember the female was the most beautiful not Adam Eve and now through the crossing again the high breeding that seed line takes on Eve's looks looks like the most beautiful women's there ever was that's true well look look Noah Eve was the most Beauty through Eve right these daughters must be of Eve what natural because it wasn't pleasant to the sight right sure sure he says and they chose took them wives of all what they chose he say and the Lord God my spirit is not always a stri with man so so here there's there's three major things here the prophet T about Noah's day he says three uh red light flashings I'm paraphrasing he says what the wom in this day will become beautiful right right he says uh men will become Giants and Tall not here he yes absolutely he said and what and the imagination intens of the thoughts of the hearts were continually evil right AB those three major signs this is the end times right now so we see something here now he says now look at verse nine there are the generations of it says these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his Generations all the way from Adam down he married within his within the daughters of God that's right so we know if he was pure his sons were pure right pure seed right absolutely he said so now we're going we're going to the flood how did this we know by New Testament scripture even after the flood scripture serice he got through exactly how did they get through now we're dealing with Noah he was perfect in his Generations he could say he lined it all the way this daughter this this wife this this came from Adam this look Generations absolutely right just like the the old the New Testament priest could look and say I'm I'm Abraham seed I'm just look absolutely right he says so what happened here how did the serpent see get in here sermon SE 1958 he says now knowing his sons which come out hamem and Jeth come out in the righteous line he says how did the seed ever get over he said the seed come over in the ark just like it did in the beginning through the woman he says they're wives yes wow well I thought I thought the life was in the man the blood line the blood cell came through the man right this thing is not what we think well if I'm a Son of God of course Son of God children of God there's something remember we're dealing with a natural makeup a natural genetic makeup serpent right right and a natural man but spiritual right Son of God daughter of God somehow in this genetics remember the double helix a there is something there that can cause this that can happen it's proved how did it get through the ark remember it said Noah was perfect in his Generations it never said that about his sons that's right because remember the sons of God saw the daughters of man for they beautiful took all right these were Noah's sons also did the same thing because remember After the flood came right Noah would become a Vineyard man he started right making making wine whe he got drunk whatever and his one son saw him naked what he couldn't curse that son because he remember he came out of Noah and Noah was pure but he had to curse his grandson great great grandson whatever see he could not curse his son because he was pure God already blessed it right did he sin sure but he already blessed it couldn't curse it by the inspiration Noah being what a preacher of righteousness maybe a prophet however he could not curse that one because he was a seat of God absolutely yes sir absolutely now SS of god let's just let's just give the power punch when I was in high school the r I'll say the ram slam when I was in high school I had a buddy and and my buddy uh me and him fell away for a while then then after college we got back together and started hanging out you know buddies friends you know and I had come into the message and I said brother I want to show you something man and I did did this entire study he's like I don't see it I don't see it I don't see it I don't see it and then I read one scripture the LA one of the last scriptures I read as you can imagine it took for a long time right and he's a good friend because he sit right through it and I like to hit every scripture because I don't want no doubts in your mind I don't want to be devil say well no no this thing is real this is the truth and I hit this scripture in First John 3 verse 11 for this is the message that you had heard from from the beginning in the beginning God what Genesis he says that we should all love one another not as Cain who is of that Wicked one and slew his brother wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brother's righteous I said who is the wicked one was Adam the wicked one he said oh my goodness you're right this is true he said the scary thing is he said well that still doesn't move me he said but I see it it's there wow he saw it he saw it this one ss of God I went through this entire study in this one scripture it opened just like that yes yes I said you want to know who the wicked one is it wasn't it wasn't Adam I said let's turn to Matthew 13 He said yeah let's check that out he saw it he saw it right then I said let's let's reveal who this wicked one is and this is where I had my El Comm munical Showdown a year into the message yeah people were coming out D you know a small group of young believers my brother cam in fact brother cam who's preaching

through scripture we're gonna run it just like we just been doing right right I got two or three scriptures in this one what about I throw scripture oh what about this one I throw scripture the this one out of the crowd whatever I said through scripture and it was just an uproar right and the lord gave me wisdom I'm only a year into this message you know I haven't even received the Holy Ghost yet till like 200 after this about a year half a year whatever that's when I received the Holy Ghost but you just need the Holy Ghost wisdom maybe gift of wisdom I don't know what whatever so I go in

we'll believe Jesus's words over Peter's Phillips and Paul's any day of the week that's what he do that's right that's what yeah it was over yeah they gave me the last snail right a p right right yes I said you'll believe Jesus's words over Peter's and Paul's any day they said absolutely I said let's go back to service okay let's go back to server seed I mean demon seed I me server seed demon all right oh I had him and I took him to Matthew 13 I said this is a very particular scripture I mean set of scriptures here this chapter is amazing I said there's parables in here they said oh yes Absol we know about this absolutely that's right and I took him through the parable the SE I said look at this Parable the SE do you have any problem with it we read it absolutely no problems you got problems no no problems we love it okay absolutely I said what now let's now let's read this here Matthew 13 verse 24 here's another Parable oh my goodness two Parables big ones too these are like paragraphs absolutely he says it says and another pretty Parable he put forth he says the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man which stowed good seed in his field and I'm waiting for something to strike nothing but while man slept his enemy came and S tears among the weed and went his way but when the the blade was sprung forth and brought forth tears then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the household we read these things right and I said do you have a problem with this Parable they said no oh good good neither do I and I said did you know these two parables are very very special Parables these are the only parables in Matthew 13 that God Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead B that Inc came into this body he said that he gave an interpretation to amen oh they said yes yeah I said let's read the interpretation of the SE we read it do you have a problem with that no let's turn the page I said do you have a problem now let's read this right let's get and I read it really really slow and I put emphasis on every letter and a certain person stood up and said you can't read it like that I said I'm reading the word of God right I can put emphasis on any jot and tit word letter whatever it's here and we read this verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house actually I took him verse 34 and all these things spake Jesus and the multitude in Parables and without a parable speaking out why did he speak these in Parables he says verse 35 that I be fulfilled which is spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables he was fulfilling scripture prophecy right he says and look what he's doing he says I will hutter things which have been kept secret from the foundations of the world yes yes so something in here is being hidden and being opened up yes some one of these Parables has an opening to the foundation of the world that has the original that Jesus sent the multitudes away and he went to the house and his disciples came and said unto him declare unto us the parable the ter Terrors of the field notice that's the only ones the inter that the uh that the disciples wanted to know he says and he said Toto him he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world and these people were starting to get really quiet oh you believe Jesus's words any day here we go you guys got red letters I got red letters he says the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom my he says but the tears are the children of the wicked one I said my buddy back in the day I said who is that Wicked one look verse 39 he says the enemy that sld them is the devil that's the wicked one right and I read this Parable really articulately yes and it was total silence this brother's been a pastor for 20 years that one's 30 this this this their wives this and that dealt with who knows what as a pastor I don't know what they go through I'm sure a lot been through seminary schools who knows that LD ddl whatever L's right all these L's and M's right D's RS whatever phds all this stuff they had it all yeah right and you know what they said that guy stood up said well we're going to we're moving on we're we want to talk about something else they saw it they saw it there was no arguing about this after that wow I had them the Holy Ghost had them amen and on Judgment Day yes yeah a judgment day yeah God's going to rewind rewind back to 2003 that's true and I taught these people I tried to tell them right absolutely breaking down a mystery last scripture sorry SS Scot last scripture let's go to Second Peter no no second Peter 2 verse one I notice Peter he says but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who probably shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought them and bring bring uh upon themselves Swift destruction right so he's dealing with preachers teachers prophets men men right then he goes through everything they do he types he brings it back to types s gorra Noah Noah and all these things right and in verse 12 he he made something really he just says something so spectacular he says but these as natur natural brute beasts the Bible says all scriptures given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost absolutely and since this is in within the holy writ or the cannon of the scripture this is inspiration of the Holy Ghost amen what the spirit of God just like it came in Isaiah in Ezekiel Isa identifying Satan yes right in them right right here Peter the Holy Ghost and Peter calls them out in written for absolute he says but these As Natural beasts mean made made to be taken and destroyed I took on some Baptists one time they said show me where it says they were made that way took them right here game over well let's let's talk about uh yeah let's talk about something else we want we want to move on here sints of God Amen this thing is undefeatable UN you can you cannot lose because it's right says let every man be a liar but God's word be true Abol like I tell them tell people I witness it's I'm not right the word is right but I want to follow this because I'm trying to be right yes I want that fruit of Truth on my tree yes abely yeah I'm just trying to put that little juice out there and make that truth fruit and I'm I'm there he says obviously with all the others too he says and they shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they count it in pleasure to Riot in the daytime spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceiving while they Feast with you having eyes full of adultery it's like Serpent and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls are heart they have exercise with Covetous practice curse children these are them absolutely sints God this is just a nice Foundation here hope is a blessing we haven't even been through probably half the scriptures maybe not even a third maybe we've been through about a third of everything in here wordwise as far as R S Zed absolutely SS of God when you go out from here tonight and you wake up tomorrow or brother sister whatever you stop at a gas station every person you see yes comes from one of these two lineages that's right very very sad you know what you know what gives me strength a lot of times when somebody would offend me or uh someone give me an issue or this and that I say Lord this guy could be one of them forgive him Lord Jesus said forgive them Father for they know not what they do that's right they can't help it s of God they're really just animals with Souls Noah said the Bible says in Noah's day there were eight Souls on the ark but it was full of animals didn't have souls but when the mixing the high breeding took place that Soul was added to them there's a little spot their heart must have formed just like the sons of God where the soul is put and they had that same thing too now and now because remember before they were not in the image of God right they were just like a natural animal but when God said let us make man in our image he made him what Spirit Body and Soul right but now when they hybrid that Soul crossed over a a spot to have the soul and a soul was given to each one of these and now they're in the image of God and now they have to answer for the things of God right that's right right you look you you are formed just like my sons and my daughters how come you did not conform to the word of God you are in my image yes right good good oh my so sad but like we there's no place there they cannot they can never stay with the word yes I have two goats at home I have chickens I have dogs I have animals and no matter how train or how good I can train a goat to if I could dress it up and sit at my table was little goofy goat horns right and I train it to eat like a man eat like a sister right right and even bow ahead and pray maybe that goat maybe would do that no none of my training will ever be able to take out that nature that's right none of it no matter how much I let that goat watch a a television show about nature no matter how much I try to indoctrinate them with the true indoctrination with the word of God they can that nature will always be there right and you can't get mad at them because they are go it's just how it is right it's the saddest thing vessels of pity Mercy Lord anyhow let's uh let's say a word of prayer sorry if I held you too long or whatever just want to be a blessing wonderful wonderful let's just bow our heads here dearly father Lord Jesus Lord we just love you Lord Lord the most hum Ling maybe Doctrine revelation God lord to cross our eyes and our ears in this day go yes Lord it just it's just so saddening to me Lord and Lord I

Lord there has to be some glorified and some uh judged Lord I don't know why you wrote it this way Lord but you chose to Lord and Lord we just we love you anyhow God lord and Lord I believe we have the mind of God Lord but it still hurts Lord we're still human Lord we're kin to them in a way Lord God we're built just like them God they're just built just like us Lord You Don't Know What to Do Lord half the time Lord you you try and witness Lord and do our best to Shine the Light God and offer Lord your word and just love as the best we can the fruits of our spirit Lord that you the fruits of your spirit Lord you gave us Lord and Lord it just seems like they don't like that taste of that fruit Lord but they the fruit of their own way God Lord that's their appetites Lord I don't I don't know Lord I we just thank God lord you made each one of us here Lord God in your image Lord and Lord that you chose us before the foundations of the world we just love you so much for it God yes Lord thank you Jesus Lord the study is just always hard it's really it's it's it's an awesome study Lord but it's so it's so hard it's painful God to teach Lord but Lord we teach it anyhow because your

cannot even control themselves that's right they have can you imagine yourself being insane not knowing it right being not not even be able to control yourself not even be able to see one time I was in Walmart and I was behind a guy and he was telling this guy in front of me was telling the cashier I have a snake and they're talking about it and I'm just listening and I'm think okay Lord what you know whatever just being patient and he said you know he said you know you know the funny thing most people don't know about snakes and she's like what's that she goes say snakes can't hear real well and they can't see real well really my goodness that's right that's right in the scripture I said that's perfect what the natural and the spiritual absolutely they can't see and they can't hear they cannot help it that's how they're built yes oh my but just just be in prayer SS of God watch out for one another amen witness to everyone we don't know these things are we're so mingled right now we

up to the Holy Ghost get the unity of the faith between the Believers we're AI amen you know this ain't we didn't write this we we're in it amen we just have to fulfill what we have to fulfill right Hallelujah I know I know this really affects me this study is just hard for me it's just it's just sad so J let's stand for yous youbody appreciate you wonderful beautiful beautiful sir thank you thank you beautiful message let's give the Lord round Applause praise God thank you praise God I never get tired of the word of God like he said and he's right you can when you dig into a topic I don't care if it's water baptism right you dig into something you find more eternal truth of God it will rejoice your heart if you're a child of God it's all about what seeds inside because the Bible says the Lord loveth righteousness yes and his count do doth uphold the upright but see that's why when you leave the presence of God his countenance can't uphold you because they leave it but we got to stay in the countenance of the Lord the Bible said The Way of the Wicked is abomination of the Lord he that loveth him that fouth but he loveth him that fouth after righteousness that's why God loves us follow his word yes Lord in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother praise God I love what he said there we must always be our Brother's Keeper God is telling us to be our Brother's Keeper right let's treat and was like we said sometimes we don't know who it is right we don't know what seed thereof so we're Jesus said even love your enemies then right right love your family brotherly kindness loves all the family of God right but also loves the unlovable yes praise God let's just sing a song here here too by God's grace as we close don't you love the Lord Church oh my what a beautiful message brother side we appreciate your sacrifice and the word of God outstanding message just beautiful beautiful I love to see it through the word of God I said I've only I look back on my notes I've only preached on serpent seed twice since I've been Pastor so I just just didn't preach on it very much boys believed it oh he studied it you know uh so I really want him to come someone who's preached it that many times and taught it I want to see what opened people's eyes and I think we heard that tonight so amen very thankful yes Lord thank you let's s that song I Just Want to Thank You Lord talks about serpent seed praise God praise God okay number 120 the book there I Just Want to Thank You Lord remember uh I think I told some of this but the first person who witnessed the message to me was brother Simon and the first message he brought me was serpent seed and as soon as I heard it I I saw it and Simon said he said as soon as he heard the message she said I know Jesse's going to receive it abely and I did that that Thanksgiving night 14 years ago just a few days ago was the anniversary of that so that's why this message is very dear to me but all of them are dear but you understand the first one you hear is usually special to you glory you didn't
