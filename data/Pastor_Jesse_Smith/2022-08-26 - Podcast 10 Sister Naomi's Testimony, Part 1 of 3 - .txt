If you were raised in the Message, we believe you'll greatly enjoy Sister Naomi's testimony. 

In Part 1 you'll learn about her dedicated upbringing in the End Time Gospel of Jesus Christ. As the mighty power of God moved in her church, she was drawn to God's presence,  being baptized with the Holy Ghost around 12 years old. 

The seal of God in her soul kept her strong and faithful as she moved into junior and senior high, helping her overcome her greatest battles. 

Any young person in this Message will benefit from our sister's testimony as an example of the grace of Jesus Christ upon a youth that is hungry and thirsty for Jesus' righteousness.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you and welcome to defending message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and i'm eamon lee we're thankful that you're joining us here on the podcast today today we have another wonderful testimony we're going to share we felt led over the last few months to go through testimonies of the saints in our church of course right now there's an attack on the message where people are leaving the message and speaking bad about the message and saying in some cases the message ruined their life and of course we see totally different we see how the message has given hope to our lives and as brother austin's testimony shares it's brought restoration to his life and transformation i would say the same for brother amen and i and of course everyone in the church because the true definition of the message is the word of god that jesus christ is fulfilling right now in the lives of real christians so we're rejoicing in what god has done in our lives we want to continue here and have a testimony from our sister naomi she's been a wonderful testimony here in our church a wonderful example of a christian sister our sister and her mother started coming to our church around the end of 2013. i can still remember when they first came they were dressed so nicely and you could tell they were just ready for church and they entered into worship right away they were so humble they came to our humble little church like a hole in the wall and they've been with us ever since supported us in everything we've ever done and they prayed for us they've been such a wonderful blessing to our family and the church here so we're going to start with our sister's testimony before we begin i want to share a couple of things first i want to apologize for the low quality of our sister naomi's voice this is my fault as i forgot to change the audio in setting when we were recording the podcast so please forgive me for that but hopefully you can still hear her voice if you turn up your volume to maximum and also for privacy reasons we're going to protect our sister's last name and country of origin i'm going to start with our very first question what was your childhood like in relation to learning about jesus so thankfully i i was born into the message i was we grew up in church it was that was the normal thing go to church on sunday and then i think we used to go two days during the week wednesdays and fridays and like there was no excuse you go to church every every time there's service you go to church though that's how i that's how we grew up thankfully this truth was was open to us like right from death and then we've been in it we grew up with very little and with the way the message is kind of the messages it looks like like the bible says you have um access to everything but not everything is lawful for you so there are so many things you don't get yourself involved in so it looked like it's something that was suitable for like poor people because then you don't get to do lots of fun stuff so i thought it was normal because that's how i grew up until probably i got to um junior high and then i actually realized okay there's something different about us and because we did not have much we did not really grow up with family we didn't have a lot of i didn't have a lot of relationship with my extended family it was just my parents and my siblings stuff and so and then i had a few friends in church so it was probably junior high and the school i went to to reward uniforms the girls had their uniforms the boys and their uniforms so there was nothing that made me think that i was standing out different from them probably in junior high that's when i actually i got to the realization that oh okay so we dredged differently and there is something different about us so and that was probably about between between the ages of 10 and 12. that was when i actually realized okay so the kind of christian life you're living is not the normal one this is something different you know we've talked different times over the years sister and i remember how you know growing up as you said there was times your family lacks certain things so i'd like to maybe share some of the details about that what did you lack and then how did you see the lord intervene for you in some of those situations okay so um like i said earlier we grew up with very little so i mean it was and it's my dad working he was like a public servant and it wasn't much earning and we're like it was five of us because my parents saw it was seven sometimes like even meals is a problem but to the glory of god there was no there was not a single time that we had to go to bed on an empty stomach or anything like that god always provided sometimes we had enough sometimes we did not but i think god helped us as a family we're always together and however little it was we're able to share it usually during christmas that's when everybody gets like new clothes new shoes and things like that but it's not every christmas we get new clothes sometimes it's like hand-me-downs and thankfully my mom used to make clothes so sometimes during christmas she's able to get fabric that is if we are able to afford that she gets fabrics and then she sews clothes for us so that was the way we lived and even in school like the school uniforms like i said we wear school uniforms so we pass it down and then when the school year starts when we do not always go with new shoes and sometimes it was it was a little hard on you because you want to go to school with new shoes but i mean your parents cannot afford it and now i look back and i'm thankful that then god gave us even though we wanted it and we couldn't have it god still gave us that contentment in our hearts like we were okay we didn't go um doing anything that we wanted or like trying to get new issues away i mean we just couldn't afford it we accepted that that is how it is yeah and going to school my parents did their best to even though they did not have much to take us to the best schools around sometimes it was a struggle paying school fees and but to the glory of god yeah he he kept us he he provided for us and i ultimately ended up in college i did not take student loan or anything my dad paid my fees my sister i wasn't the only one in school my siblings were also in school but we didn't take students loans or anything he he worked hard and god provided yeah i love that this part of your testimony you know we've been at the church we've been looking at how god calls some rich some poor you know god has a different calling in life for each and every person and so in your case you know god started you or god called you in a spot where economic times were harder and so your dad had to work super hard and you had to basically work your way out of poverty but in each step god always provided he provided the food the clothing and then schooling which is a huge blessing too because there are some countries where their their families can't afford school and so god through his mercy and through the hard work of mom and dad everybody working together praying together god provided all things for your family so i think that's a beautiful testimony of god's provision so it's wonderful to hear that you were raised in the house of god with parents that were godly and loved you when and why do you think you finally surrendered to jesus can you remember when you gave your heart to the lord and maybe what led you to repent and become a christian yourself okay so um i was i was very actively involved in church because that was that was just how it was it was just go to school in church those were the only two places i was going to school in church so we're very actively involved in church like cleaning and getting the church ready and all the everything that goes in church stuff so growing up we used to see like the power of god moving church and people screaming and prophesying and most services are like that so i had then she was my best friend that was the only best friend i had and then we went to the same school so when we go to school like on mondays that's after church on sundays then we asked ourselves then we used to call it or the anointing of god fell so we asked ourselves did the anointing fall on you today it was something like we're asking ourselves every time on mondays when we go to church did anointing follow you and then you're like no so we got to a point where we declared our own fastings like okay today we are going to fast and then pray i think that i'll probably be that was in junior high so i was probably about 11 years thereabout so we'll organize our own fasting and then pray about it and then even sometimes at church when they say we should fast and i do not fast or maybe i just break my fast in the middle of the day i am so scared when i go to church because i feel like prophecy is going to break for that i did not do the faster i ate so it was it was that kind of like fear because sometimes sins are called out in the church people prophesy and they call out sin in the church so when you're going to church with and then you are not right like you are really scared because anything could happen in i can't even imagine how that would feel so you wanted to get everything right so i think that was that i was around that time and i was longing to see what i was seeing in people i was seeing the spirit of god move on people i wanted to also feel it so i think i was praying about it and then the spirit of god was moving towards also praying asking god to to grant it to me and then one time we went to church and then after service we all got up to pray i wasn't feeling myself there was something different i wasn't too sure what it was but i knew there was something different so they asked all of us to sit down and i realized i couldn't sit like my hands were that was when i realized i was actually crying so i was crying and screaming and i couldn't stop crying i think i cried all through the service the rest of the service until the service ended and then even after the service when everybody left i was still in the church and then i was i was still crying so i think my dad came for me and then took me to the pastor and then we prayed and then my dad did not have a car so he had to get a friend who had a car and then they put me in the car and then drove me home and i was still crying so i i believe that was when i was filled with with the spirit of god and i think it was probably shortly after that that i got baptized yeah i got baptized before i went to um senior high so it was probably shortly after that i got baptized and i thank god god has been gracious god has been very gracious to me i can relate to sister naomi how she says you know in her church growing up there was a lot of gifts of the spirit i was raised in a denominational pentecostal trinitarian church and there was tongues almost every week i would consistently feel the presence of god i would feel the conviction of my sin but also like our sister when she got to senior high i would see the spirit fall when i'd see people speak in tongues but then i would watch their lives afterwards and their lives didn't match the word of god and so that was a little bit confusing there for me when i was younger as well well that's one thing we should all learn as a church if we want to see the supernatural we got to pray for the supernatural there was gifts in the church operating so they were coming to church with expectation and that's something we can learn here in 2022 you know we want our young people to experience the spirit of god the presence of god gifts of the holy spirit well it's our duty as adults right to come and pray and the bible says that we must covet the best gifts so we must come together and pray and ask for the spirit of god to move and then when it moves on us it'll make the children want the holy spirit to move on them so that's another wonderful lesson that we can learn their adults created such an atmosphere that the children wanted to fall under that atmosphere and so that's what we want to we want to create an atmosphere where the children will be hungering and thirsting for righteousness want to fast want to pray want to be born again want the anointing to fall on them so as adults we can we can model that for them by god's grace about what age was senior high so so we can kind of place this for the young people and those listening you got the holy ghost before you went to senior high so that's a great testimony that's a powerful testimony it shows you were raised in a church that believed in justification and sanctification and that it already happened in your life but any idea about what age was senior high started my senior high was between 13 and 15 years it was it was two years praise god that i think it's great to identify that you know the fact that she received the holy ghost before she was 13. what a beautiful testimony how god can work in young people's lives i hope those listening on the podcast and all of our children in our home church can see how important it is to pray did all the children hear that i hope all of our listeners heard that too they set up their own prayer meetings before they're 13 years old because they got she got the holy ghost before she was 13. what a beautiful testimony of the spirit of god drawing a person and then also the person responding because like she said she didn't have to fast or she didn't have to do that she was led to do that she chose to do that and she obeyed that so i hope that's an encouragement to all the young people listening and also the young people in our church that they will see that god can use you at any age god wants in fact the younger the better praise god the the younger you can repent and get justified and sanctified then god can fill you with the holy ghost and again this testimony her testimony validates acts chapter 10 how those in corneas house received the holy ghost before they were baptized in water so her testimony is another support or proof that you can get the holy ghost before you're baptized in water because she was already living a sanctified life so that's a great testimony so in your life sister it seems like from 13 to 15 you were outside of your home you were attending a boarding school which is totally different from america in most cases i know some families that are rich can send their kids away to private schools but most kids do public education or homeschooling so your your testimony is very unique in the fact that you had the holy ghost and then it was like kind of like jesus's life you were sent off to be tested and tried uh at the boarding school so are there any testimonies you want to share about that experience that might help teenagers or anyone that would maybe be outside of home and not living at home but still wanting to to live for jesus christ when he goes most of the senior high schools are born in houses so you'd take your stuff leave home and then go stay on the campus for probably about three to four months till the semester ends and then when the semester ends you go you go home for a couple of weeks and then come come back so i had to leave home at 13 and then go to the boarding house and like i earlier said it was around junior high that i realized that okay there was something different about us then when i got to senior high i actually saw okay like we're really different when i looked at the clothes of my classmates and then mine like especially the necklines and then the length of the dresses like mine was always higher the neck was higher the dress was more the the length was much longer and what baffled me was that most of them were christians like most of them were christians and they could speak in tongues and yeah it was a public school so on sunday um the catholics will have their own place together the pentecostals will have their own place together the methodists will have their own place together and this was the very first time i'm going to a church outside my church so i'm like okay i can't do a catholic i don't like metadata so i'll just do the pentecostals so i go there they pray they speak in tongues and all that but then after afterwards when we go back to the dorm they they live all kinds of lives like they're talking about boyfriends girlfriends and i was i was very naive to those things like i had no idea what they were so i'm like what baffled me was on sunday we go to church and like they're speaking and so and they can't even pray like much harder than me saying and all that so i was like okay like what what is going on here and then also because of my age you know at the teenage age you want to feel like a sense of belonging you want to be part of the people that you are with sometimes you you want to conform so that you can be accepted you don't want to look like you're a weird person and these are people you're living with every day so you don't want to appear like anything like you're weird or sometimes they'll tease you and call you um cre-faith they call you craft that's yeah like a holy roller or something and you know as much as you're a christian you want to be identified as a christian you don't want to be seen as like a christian that is to the extreme so you try to uh kind of do some of the things that they do so you can you can confirm sometimes they even come to you and then um tell you we are all christians so there is nothing wrong with this one of the very vivid memories i have is in senior high school is um probably i was i was probably in my second year no it was the first year so on saturdays we have entertainment programs every saturday we go for entertainment it could be singing it could be anything and then um when the first years come in they entertain the school so they have a nice way everybody will dress so funny and then you come in you dress funny and then come in entertain and then one time the entertainment show was was modeling so you wear your clothes and then you come and muddle so you had to get your parents to send you clothes so my mom sent me clothes of course that's the dress and long skirt and then everybody was excited before before the the show everybody was excited i mean days before the show everybody was excited we're talking about our clothes and this person said oh see what i got see what i got and then i bring my out and everybody starts laughing like how possibly can you wear a then like this to the modeling like no you need to get something else i'm like are you sure you're like yeah and of course i wanted to feel like i was part of them so i put my clothes down and then took what they gave me which was not appropriate so that was what i wore today modeling and then i got up there and then modeled in the clothing i came back and i was crying i'm like i disappointed girl this was not right i shouldn't have won those clothes and i was crying so some friends came in there like why are you crying like i shouldn't i shouldn't put on what i put on you're like there's nothing wrong with it you were not naked there was nothing wrong with it i'm like no this is not appropriate and they were christians so i thought they would understand but they just kind of brushed it off and i dealt with the guilt for like years i called my mom i told you like this is what i did and i felt like god will not forgive me i was it took me years to recover from that guilt i think that was that was my major mistaking in senior high and i regretted it and i was like that was when i told myself okay i can leave like everybody else this is me i have to i have to stand on my ground and if you'd accept me fine if you wouldn't accept me like this is me because i can i can live like everybody there the feeling of guilt was so immersed on me it was it was horrible and i'm like never again so that was that was the time that was the point that i was like i i don't have to give in to peer pressure this is me everybody is different this is this is the path that god is carrying for me and i can do otherwise because that the feeling of guilt was was terrible it was terrible and the part that hurt me most was those around me like the friends that were around me that i saw as christians did not understand why they thought i was overreacting did not understand why i should feel that sense of guilt and nobody understood me so i'm like okay i can't be understood by people so i just have to go and live like i should leave if you want to be my friend this is me if you don't want to be my friend because of the life i live well that's that's up to you so i think that was that was my major thing in senior high then i went to college and because of that experience i had in senior high i think it's it helped me very much in my college years because then i had accepted like this is how i'm supposed to dress so i don't feel bad for it i accept it of course you have you've had people passing comments about you but this is how to live and have a free conscience and have a good relationship with god so that's how i've always lived yeah we appreciate you sharing that personal testimony what a great example of the conviction power of the holy spirit like when a person makes a mistake personally i can't imagine i didn't serve god when i was a teenager i can't imagine the pressure that would have been on you sister so it's awesome to see that god allowed you to go through this her sister lived different than her previous convictions just one time and the amount of conviction that came upon her proves she had the born-again experience right because if she wasn't born again she would not have been convicted so severely or so consistently regarding her sin and i thought what a great proof that is that you were born again and it took you years to get over then that shows how sincere you are with god how you want to honor god's word and contrast that with the pentecostal people who can sin and it doesn't bother them at all but when a holy ghost-filled person sins the spirit of god is right there it's dwelling in their soul and it's right there to convict them and will lead them to quick obedience so what a what a great testimony of you get the holy ghost before you're 13 and then you get tested in your teens you make one mistake and god is right there to bring conviction bring correction and then you're able to stand the rest of your life really so god had to bring you through this trial so you could learn a lesson overcome and really gain power to stand as you went into the later years of college and now all through adulthood as well by god's grace i want to go back to when our sister received the baptism of holy ghost before she was 13 i want all of our listeners especially our our young people in the church to catch this i just thought it was wonderful that her and her friends were asking each other every monday did the holy ghost fall on you did god anoint you i mean that's so that's so wonderful it's so wonderful that they were talking every monday did the holy ghost visit you did he did he pour out his spirit on you what a beautiful uh testimony of inviting god's presence remember brother brahm said the more you talk about jesus the more he'll come right as soon as you start talking about him he'll come and i love the fact that he and her friends were talking about the holy ghost and she was hungry for the holy ghost and she was saying no didn't follow me but the fact that she was talking about it and the more they did talk about it eventually the holy ghost did fall on it so i'd like you to share a little bit more about do you remember what was preached like that exact moment the holy ghost fell upon you or maybe what you were singing because it was such a wonderful testimony and maybe just give us an estimate about how long were you singing there crying and when your dad had to go get the car you know someone else's borrow the car to take you home can you just give us a little more detail about that and because that was the moment you had talked about you prayed for and then god finally came and anointed you so maybe share a little bit more about that if you can i do not remember the same one that was preached but the song that was singing i remember i was past me not of gentle savior and so that was it was the end of the service and then we're praying the the preaching had ended and then we were praying and then singing and then i think the spirit of god fell that day so it was a little longer probably about 30 45 minutes and then church ended but i was still in church crying and it will probably be about two three hours like when i finally got home yeah because my my dad is a as he was an elder in the church so after church they have to it was a bigger church so after church they have to do a few things and then his friend was also he was a trustee so after church they have to take care of the offering and a few church problems here and then things that needs to be done so it takes a while before they they go home every time we get off church we have to sit behind for at least an hour before we get home so i will probably be about two three hours when i finally got one yeah that's a great testimony example of crying out for the power of god pleading with god let the holy spirit follow me and then god finally answers how long do you think you and your friends were talking about that anointing until it finally fell on you personally we talked about it we talked about it a long time because we're seeing the spirit of god move in church so i was in junior high that i actually became conscious of everything so that was about 10 years old so probably probably for for about six months to a year we're talking about it yeah it was something we were talking about sometimes we go to church and we cry sometimes we see the spirit of god and we're doing she was my best friend in chief we're doing some specials together and yeah we were really close and when i went to when i went to senior i would write each she did not go to a boarding school she was in a day school so she was still going to church and all but i was in the boarding school so i had to we write each other letters and tell them i can't wait to come to church and all that kind of stuff uh what a great lesson for our young people that when you seek the lord it's really helpful to have a friend there too so the sister naomi was not only seeking god by herself but a friend was encouraging her so let we can encourage our young people as you seek the lord find a god-fearing friend young young sisters in our church and talk about the lord just talk about the things of god be under expectation so you can see in that those six months leading up to before she was filled with the holy ghost you know she was seeking the face of god and didn't the bible say if you seek me you'll find me what a wonderful testimony of god backing up his promise if you seek me with all your heart you'll find me okay uh we just finished our first part of this testimony and we're gonna make another part very soon and i hope you were blessed by this honorable and this testimony from our dear sister naomi yeah thank you for listening and hope these testimonies have been a blessing we know that the lord jesus christ is working our lives and this message which is the revelations god gave us out of the bible are transformative and so we hope you enjoy this direction that we're going we can see it transform our sister's life and our testimony and brother austin's life in the previous testimony so we hope you'll stay tuned and i hope these uh stories are speaking to your heart especially for a young person here's a young person raising the message and if you seek god even when you're young you'll find god god will reveal himself to you if you're thirsty for god if you're hungry for god surely you'll be filled so god bless each one of you and may the lord jesus christ anoint you to defend the message [Music] do [Music] you
