[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] you say that message you're preaching
[0:04] brother random is wrong look at yourself
[0:06] a little bit let the Holy Spirit search
[0:09] your minds with the word you'll agree
[0:11] with the
[0:14] message greetings friends in the
[0:16] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:19] the purpose of this video is to share a
[0:21] second set of reasons why I'm a message
[0:24] believer why I follow the bible-based
[0:27] ministry that Jesus Christ gave to his
[0:30] Prophet The Late William brandham who
[0:31] lived from 1909 to
[0:33] 1965 my name is Jesse Smith I'm pastor
[0:36] of bride of Christ Fellowship here in
[0:38] akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible
[0:40] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:43] to his true Prophet brother William
[0:45] brandham and also defend The Godly
[0:47] character of brother William brandom
[0:49] I'll leave a link in the description to
[0:51] part one of this
[0:53] series before I get into reasons 10
[0:55] through 14 I just want to thank the Lord
[0:57] Jesus Christ for saving my soul as as I
[1:00] said I was raised in Assembly of God and
[1:01] they were good people but when it came
[1:03] down to receiving the full revelation of
[1:04] the word of God the church I was raised
[1:07] in did not receed the full Revelation
[1:09] and then when I went to college I went
[1:11] to a Baptist type of mega church got
[1:14] saved there then about two years after
[1:16] that my brother Simon introduced the
[1:18] message of the hour to me by God's grace
[1:21] so I want to thank my Lord and Savior
[1:22] Jesus Christ for saving my soul
[1:24] sanctifying me and filling me with the
[1:26] Holy Ghost putting me into service for
[1:28] his glory I can do nothing without
[1:31] Jesus's help and I believe my life verse
[1:33] is John 15:5 where Jesus said without me
[1:37] you can do nothing and I'm a living
[1:39] walking testimony to that without Jesus
[1:41] I can do absolutely nothing if any good
[1:43] comes out of my humble little
[1:45] insignificant life then Jesus gets all
[1:47] the glory it was a moment when I yield
[1:49] to the Holy Spirit and Jesus was able to
[1:52] use me like a worker puts his hand in a
[1:54] glove as a human I'm just a glove Christ
[1:58] is the power behind me that's how it is
[2:00] with every Godly Christian also want to
[2:02] thank my mother for all the years of
[2:04] praying for me she'd prayed with me
[2:06] before school and before bed of course
[2:09] she'd pray with my siblings and I even
[2:12] as a single mother she would Faithfully
[2:14] pray for us take us to church so I
[2:16] believe me being saved is partly God's
[2:19] answer to all her prayers and then God
[2:21] used my brother cam to help me get saved
[2:24] as well he was the first one amongst his
[2:25] brothers who gave his heart to Christ
[2:27] cam was a wonderful example of Christ
[2:30] and he let me borrow his car and while
[2:31] driving in his car as a sinner I listen
[2:33] to his Christian music and it totally
[2:35] softened my heart to Christianity so I
[2:38] credit the Lord Jesus Christ using my
[2:40] mom and brother cam so I could be saved
[2:42] by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:45] then I also want to say thank you to
[2:46] brother Simon I put out a video recently
[2:48] about the revelation God showed to him
[2:49] and and I felt like I didn't thank him
[2:51] enough brother Simon has been a
[2:53] tremendous friend and of course natural
[2:55] brother to me he's been a tremendous
[2:56] help to our church and our ministry he
[2:58] comes in and teaches as as an evangelist
[3:00] and as a teacher does a wonderful job
[3:02] staying with the word of God building
[3:04] our faith stirring us up in fact in one
[3:07] sermon last year in 2023 brother Simon
[3:10] preached and during the sermon there
[3:11] were at least nine things that discerned
[3:13] the thoughts and intents of my heart
[3:15] things I didn't tell him things he
[3:16] didn't know things I'd preached that he
[3:18] didn't know I'd preached and I wept and
[3:21] cried after that service and I thanked
[3:22] the Lord and I told Brother Simon never
[3:24] doubt that Jesus Christ has called you
[3:26] to preach never in my entire life of
[3:28] being a Christian have I been so
[3:30] thoroughly discerned than that one
[3:33] service I think it was nine or 10 or
[3:34] more times secrets of my heart things
[3:37] I've been wondering about praying about
[3:38] preaching about things I'd gone through
[3:40] trials I'd gone through brother Simon
[3:42] was led by the Holy Ghost to discern my
[3:45] heart and life and I thank the Lord for
[3:46] brother Simon yielding to the Lord Jesus
[3:48] Christ so now by God's grace we'll get
[3:51] into reason number 10 reason number 10
[3:53] I'm a message believer is because of
[3:55] amazing Bible
[3:56] revelations friends when I first came in
[3:58] the message I would Drive 3 hours across
[4:00] the state from akan to Lima Ohio and
[4:03] even Defiance Ohio just for Bible study
[4:06] sometimes we'd sit for an hour two three
[4:09] maybe four hours and brother Craig bu
[4:11] and brother Simon would take me through
[4:12] the scriptures just teach me all the
[4:14] scriptures about water baptism the
[4:16] godhead hell is not Eternal the three
[4:19] works of Grace serpent seed the baptism
[4:22] of the Holy Ghost in the soul the gifts
[4:24] of the Holy Spirit the mother Harlot the
[4:26] Roman Catholic church and so many more
[4:28] Amazing Revelations
[4:30] this recent video I put out was another
[4:32] amazing revelation God showed to my
[4:35] brother Simon about how rebaptism in the
[4:37] New Testament was typed in the Old
[4:39] Testament through Joseph's two burials
[4:42] what a beautiful Revelation that's why
[4:44] I'm a message believer because the word
[4:46] of God becomes more and more real and
[4:49] Vindicated we get more information about
[4:51] the same Revelations all the time
[4:54] recently I was listening to brother
[4:55] brandom and he said there's hundreds of
[4:57] the differences between the bride of
[4:58] Christ and denomination
[5:00] now take a good look for a moment with
[5:03] your own spiritual Insight at your soul
[5:06] just look around I'm speaking Across the
[5:08] Nation now look just if you met you out
[5:10] there in a brandom tabernacle you and
[5:12] the Tabernacles on the west coast in
[5:15] Arizona and everywhere you're at look at
[5:17] yourself for a few
[5:18] minutes you say that message you're
[5:20] preaching brother random is wrong look
[5:22] at yourself a little
[5:24] bit let the Holy Spirit search your
[5:27] minds with the words
[5:31] you'll agree with the
[5:33] message let Christ the anointed word
[5:36] search out your own
[5:38] conscience let him get into you see if
[5:40] that's right or not that's just one or
[5:43] two things that mention when there's
[5:44] hundreds of
[5:45] them does a Bible agree with a woman
[5:48] bobbing her hair no does the bible
[5:50] believe agree with three baptisms in the
[5:53] name of father son Holy Ghost no such a
[5:55] thing does the bible agree with woman
[5:58] wearing man's clothing
[6:00] I'll just take them three there one of
[6:02] these hundreds or more search it out in
[6:04] the light of God's
[6:05] word so I took about an hour and I
[6:08] listed 100 doctrines that are different
[6:11] for us as message Believers than the
[6:12] nominal Christians of course some of
[6:15] them are saved I don't mean nomino in a
[6:16] bad way but it's the group outside of
[6:19] the message of the hour so I made it to
[6:21] 100 and then I thought think of all the
[6:24] Creeds and bylaws that all these
[6:25] churches have and so it's without a
[6:27] doubt there's hundreds if not thousands
[6:29] of differences between the true bride of
[6:31] Christ who stays with all the word of
[6:32] God like brother random has taught us to
[6:34] do and we're doing by the grace of God
[6:37] we're not perfect but the blood makes us
[6:38] perfect or mature and of course we know
[6:41] we're forgiven or perfect in heaven and
[6:43] we have a theophany waiting in heaven an
[6:45] eternal body in the heavens as Paul
[6:47] tells us in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 but
[6:50] there are so many amazing Revelations
[6:53] the Bible became a new Bible to me when
[6:55] I heard the message of William bradam I
[6:57] just can't thank the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:59] enough for revealing all these amazing
[7:01] Revelations to me my family our church
[7:04] each believer who follows this end time
[7:06] message the 11th reason I follow the
[7:09] message of the hour is because I've
[7:10] experienced real genuine love Jesus said
[7:12] you know my disciples because of their
[7:14] love one for another when I first came
[7:16] in the message I was a college student
[7:18] message believer would walk up and I'm a
[7:19] college student and he'd give me a
[7:20] handshake and there'd be a $20 bill in
[7:22] there God bless brother Richard that's
[7:24] the brother who would do it and when we
[7:25] go to other churches like lima we were
[7:28] treated so well by Pastor Pastor Isaiah
[7:29] Brooks all the saints there we got to
[7:32] stay at their houses when we'd come for
[7:34] church services and so forth they'd Feed
[7:36] Us One time my wife and I went to
[7:38] Jeffersonville and we didn't have any
[7:40] money to go out to eat and one sister
[7:42] paid for our food even bought our little
[7:44] baby girl Lydia some clothes that she
[7:46] needed one time a family from
[7:48] Pennsylvania and numerous families in
[7:50] this church from Pennsylvania filled an
[7:52] entire truck bed full of frozen food
[7:54] after my wife had a baby in order to
[7:56] give us food so my wife didn't have to
[7:58] cook right after having a baby I was
[8:00] crying it was such a wonderful Act of
[8:02] Christian love so I could truly say I
[8:04] felt the genuine love of Jesus Christ in
[8:07] the message of the hour and on top of
[8:09] that one time about 10 years ago I had
[8:11] some complexes towards some preachers I
[8:13] prayed about it each time I reached out
[8:15] to them they just freely forgave me and
[8:17] moved on haven't treated me any
[8:19] different and so again I've seen so much
[8:21] love in this message and that's the
[8:23] proof as Jesus said that we'd be the
[8:25] Disciples of Jesus Christ the love that
[8:27] we have one for another
[8:29] the 12th reason is simply the life in
[8:32] the book of Acts the angel of the Lord
[8:34] told the disciples to go speak in the
[8:36] temple and speak all the words of this
[8:38] life the disciples were in prison the
[8:40] angel got them out and said go speak the
[8:41] words of this life and that's what this
[8:43] Christian Life is in the message of the
[8:45] hour is the same life as the book of
[8:48] Acts Saints we get to walk where the
[8:50] apostles have Tred by the grace of God
[8:52] we have the same Doctrine the same
[8:53] baptism we have many of the same signs
[8:56] wonders and miracles we have the same
[8:58] love and we see see Jesus Christ
[9:00] bringing every area of Our Lives into
[9:02] subjection to the Holy Spirit to the
[9:05] word of God when I first came in this
[9:06] message I was in college and I visited
[9:09] the home of these young Brothers they
[9:10] were single Brothers brother Dave
[9:12] brother Craig brother Freddy brother Dan
[9:15] and I'm of course used to living with
[9:16] college athletes worldliness worldly
[9:19] movies worldly music all these things
[9:21] yet they go to church but when I walked
[9:23] into this house of the message Believers
[9:25] these single men I was overwhelmed with
[9:27] the Holiness of the Holy Spirit that I
[9:29] felt it truly was a holy atmosphere and
[9:32] I thought in my mind either these guys
[9:33] are the biggest frauds or they got
[9:35] something I don't got and I found out
[9:37] they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:39] and thank God now I got it by God's
[9:41] grace but friends it was the life the
[9:43] life of Jesus Christ being formed into
[9:45] the life of the message believers who
[9:47] believe the Bible revelations of this
[9:49] hour it's simply Paul's gospel restored
[9:53] to us the current believers who are live
[9:55] today and that's according to numerous
[9:57] scriptures there are six scriptures at
[9:59] at least that brother Randon fulfilled
[10:01] Amos 37 Matthew
[10:03] 17:11 acts 3:20 and 21 Luke 17:30
[10:08] Revelation 10 1-7 Malachi 45-6 and no
[10:12] doubt other verses all proving brother
[10:14] brandom had a bible-based
[10:16] Ministry to restore all things that have
[10:19] been lost down through the church ages
[10:21] restore them at the end time the mystery
[10:23] of God could be finished the 13th reason
[10:26] I love this message is because we get to
[10:27] see into a life of a genuine prophet of
[10:30] God and its on tape and also video I
[10:33] love seeing the highs and lows of
[10:35] brother Ram's life I love seeing his
[10:37] love for the Lord his love for the grace
[10:39] of God I love seeing his humanity and
[10:42] then his prophetic gift of the Holy
[10:44] Ghost as a prophet and having the gift
[10:46] to discern between the thoughts and
[10:47] intents of the heart I love the
[10:49] discernments in the prayer lines or just
[10:51] reading about the discernments from
[10:53] believers who wrote about their
[10:55] interactions with God's Prophet brother
[10:56] brandham I love seeing brother Bram zeal
[10:59] for the Gospel of Jesus Christ to defend
[11:01] the Gospel of Jesus Christ and brother
[11:03] bam always gave Jesus all the glory and
[11:06] again friends this is why I made over
[11:08] 200 videos about brother Ram's Ministry
[11:10] how it's impacted mine because it's a
[11:12] bible-based Ministry I've written two
[11:14] books about brother bram's Ministry my
[11:16] second book is 812 Pages it could have
[11:18] been a lot longer but I had to shorten
[11:20] it in order to fit it into one volume I
[11:23] mean the amazing Bible revelations and
[11:25] the wonderful quotes from God's Prophet
[11:27] brother brandham I couldn't in a book
[11:30] Jesus Christ moved so mightily through
[11:31] brother Ram's life yet he was so humble
[11:33] and so that's what we want to have we
[11:35] want to learn from the prophet of God
[11:37] God will bless us as we honor His
[11:39] prophets such as brother brandom and may
[11:41] God help us to be humble 14th and
[11:44] finally reason I love this message is
[11:46] because the teachings of the message
[11:48] have given me a wonderful loving family
[11:51] on a personal note as you probably know
[11:53] I was raised in a family where we're
[11:55] broken family my parents divorced when I
[11:57] was around 13 or 14 years old if I'm not
[11:59] mistaken and so for those remaining five
[12:02] or six years at home I always wanted one
[12:04] thing just a loving home I wanted to see
[12:06] a mom and dad who loved each other and
[12:09] of course my parents had good times and
[12:11] good years but eventually after the
[12:13] divorce it just left us all heartbroken
[12:15] that's why the Bible said God hates
[12:17] divorce but through the message of the
[12:19] hour I heard quotes from brother brandom
[12:20] say things like make the home a great
[12:23] place for your children make it a happy
[12:25] place make your home nice make your home
[12:29] a place where your daughter or son will
[12:30] not be ashamed to bring their company
[12:32] before their father and mother and into
[12:33] their house and make home so happy that
[12:36] they'll be pleased in their home and
[12:38] brother Ram said always keep the
[12:39] honeymoon with your wife and he was
[12:41] talking about a man losing their
[12:44] affections for their wife and don't uh
[12:46] love them as they did when they were
[12:48] sweetheart shame on you you ought to do
[12:51] it she's always your sweetheart
[12:53] absolutely that's the part she should be
[12:56] and you should treat her like that all
[12:58] oh never let that little honeymoon cease
[13:02] cuz it isn't going to in heaven going to
[13:05] be just perfectly one there that's right
[13:07] so all well looks like some women order
[13:10] to Said Amen to that don't never me here
[13:13] always balling women out and talking
[13:14] like that sister Hickerson why did you
[13:17] say something or somebody back there say
[13:19] did you thank you sister Cox that's very
[13:22] good brother Cox that's for you where
[13:24] you are now all right yes sir and we
[13:27] should never forget the h honor each
[13:29] other always be sweethearts never let it
[13:31] cease and even before I proposed to my
[13:34] wife brother random said only marry her
[13:37] if you can't live without her and that's
[13:38] what I found I'm so thankful that's what
[13:40] actually moved me to propose to my wife
[13:43] cuz I realized I couldn't live without
[13:44] her young man asked me other day he said
[13:46] you think I could already get married
[13:48] brother Bram to such and such a girl I
[13:51] said how much do you think of her he
[13:54] said oh my I just love her I said well
[13:57] if you're not going to live without her
[13:58] you better marri her but if you can't
[14:01] live without her you better not so but
[14:03] if it's going to kill you you better you
[14:04] better go ahead and get married and so
[14:07] what I was trying to get to in this that
[14:09] if you love her so much and so there's
[14:12] so many wonderful quotes about family
[14:15] and parenting that brother Bram gave us
[14:17] and we're so thankful for them Lord
[14:18] willing I'd like to write a book about
[14:20] family using Brother bram's quotes and
[14:21] of course the Bible scriptures not sure
[14:24] when that will happen but that's on my
[14:26] bucket list Lord willing another thing
[14:28] is to brother the ROM taught us to go
[14:29] back to the word of God and in the word
[14:31] of God we see God loves family you know
[14:33] modern families limit the number of
[14:35] children they have I don't know how
[14:37] God's going to deal with that one
[14:38] thing's for sure birth control pills are
[14:40] literally abortion pills so it's just a
[14:42] great reminder brother Ram never
[14:44] sanction birth control pills because
[14:46] they can cause abortions so by God's
[14:49] grace my wife and I have eight children
[14:50] we're very grateful for that but it's
[14:52] because of this bible message that God
[14:54] gave us through brother random that we
[14:56] learn to Value all the teachings of the
[14:57] Bible about family and how God loves
[15:01] family God loves children they're arrows
[15:03] they are the heritage of the Lord
[15:05] children are God's Heritage God's
[15:07] possession as brother randam said just
[15:09] receive them as God sends them in
[15:13] closing friends I hope this short little
[15:15] video series on why I'm a message
[15:16] believer is a blessing if I think of
[15:18] more reasons Lord willing I make a part
[15:21] three by God's grace we're so thankful
[15:23] Jesus Christ revealed all these Bible
[15:26] revelations to his humble Prophet the
[15:28] late brother William Bram as time goes
[15:30] on we're just going to get more Bible
[15:32] Revelation from the holy spirit because
[15:34] the Holy Ghost guides us into all truth
[15:36] just like with this rebaptism video and
[15:39] just like the four classes of Believers
[15:41] brother taught us in the church age book
[15:43] and the three works of Grace we are so
[15:45] blessed to walk in the light of this
[15:48] Revelation that Jesus has given us in
[15:50] this hour believe in the Lord and His
[15:52] prophets and you shall surely prosper by
[15:54] the grace of God I'm a living witness of
[15:57] that the Lord Jesus Christ has prospered
[15:59] me spiritually naturally and it's all
[16:01] because of the grace of Jesus Christ Our
[16:04] Lord if you have any questions concerns
[16:06] or testimonies about this video please

[16:09] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[16:12] the desire of your
[16:15] heart
