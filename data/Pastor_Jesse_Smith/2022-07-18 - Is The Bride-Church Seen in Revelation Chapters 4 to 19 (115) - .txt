Description:
In a few instances, God's prophet, William Branham said Revelation chapters 4 to 19 were "all Jewish", meaning he thought they dealt only with Jews, and not the Gentile Bride-Church. But others quotes from Brother Branham say the Bride-Church and/or its members are Revelation chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, and 14. 

Most importantly, Brother Branham's own prophetic ministry is detailed in Revelation chapter 10, so the thought that Revelation chapters 4 to 19 were "all Jewish" was his opinion, and not a "THUS SAITH THE LORD" statement.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question is the bride or the holy ghost filled christian church seen in the book of revelation chapters 4 through 19 the answer is yes which may be surprising to those who follow god's prophet brother william branham but as you'll soon see brother branham has quotes on both sides of this issue numerous times during brother and series on the seven seals he taught that the bride was seen in the first four seals and certainly the seventh seal and brother ram's own ministry was seen in revelation chapter 10 which we rejoice in so when we rightly divide the word of truth as commanded by the holy ghost in second timothy 2 verse 15 we can see members of the new testament bride in numerous chapters in the book of revelation such as chapters 4 5 6 7 8 10 13 and 14. here's the outline for the video first we'll look at brother random quotes that say the bride is not seen in revelation 4 through 19. second we'll look at brother random quotes about the bride or bride members being in chapters 4 through 14. third we'll look at seven proofs that the book of revelation is not in chronological order and fourth and finally we'll look at how it seems brother branham got this thought that the bride was not seen from revelation 4 to 19 from clarence larkin and rehearse how brother branham did not plagiarize from clarence larkin brother branham quotes that the bride is not seen from revelation chapter 4 to 19. by god's grace this is in the four quotes from brother branham that say the bride is not seen from revelation chapters 4 to 19. in the first quote from 1961 god being misunderstood brother branham said for when the church goes up that's the last of the church until she comes with her lord as bride and bridegroom in the 19th chapter during this time it's dealing with israel so you'll see this fact that brother branham seems to say that revelation chapters 4 through 19 are all about israel but again we have quotes from brother brown that say different than that but let's listen to the quote god dealing with israel or when the church goes up that's the last of the church until she comes with her lord his bride and bridegroom in the 19th chapter during this time is dealing with israel next in 1961 the 70th week of daniel's sermon brother ram said the sixth chapter was all jewish which is quite a statement since that's completely opposite of what he taught in the seven seals so again we can see how brother random grew in revelation and friends remember the first four seals dealt with the early church covering the last two thousand years let's listen to the quote the church leaves on the third chapter of revelations nothing said in there about nothing was just the last thing was the last messenger of the age then we deal with the jews until the coming again with the bride of the 19th chapter from the 6th to the 19th chapter is all jewish in the next quote from 1964 the feast of trumpets brother branham said the first three chapters of the book of revelation reveals all the happenings unto the church and then he says the church is not seen anymore after the end of the third chapter unto the 19th chapter of revelation and then again he says god is dealing with israel in the chapters between let's listen to the quote the first uh three chapters of the book of revelations reveals all the happenings onto the church then from the third chapter unto the 19th chapter of revelation there is no more seeing of the church the church goes up at the fourth chapter of revelations and returns back at the 19th chapter of revelations the bride and the groom together coming to the earth and then from the 19th chapter to the conclusive of the 22nd chapter it's all on the millennium and what will be in the years that is to follow during the 4th to the 19th god is dealing with israel in this fourth and final quote it's from 1964 questions and answers part three brother random basically said the same thing as he said in the previous quote from the feast of trumpets he said the first three chapters of revelation that's all to the church he says the rest of it is the jews there let's listen to the quote read the first three chapters of revelations you get what the church is right there that's all to the church and when she comes back with the bride once you come back read if you don't know about the church what pertains to read revelations the first three chapters and then go over to the 19th chapter and start reading from there if you get the rest of it it's in the jews there brother branham quotes saying the bride church or bride members are seen in revelation chapters 4 through 14. we'll go in order of the book of revelation we'll begin at revelation chapter 4 and revelation chapter 4 verse 4 says there are 4 in 20 seats in heaven and god's prophet brother branham said 12 of those seats were for bride members or the 12 original apostles of the lord jesus christ and of course we know matthias took judas's scared spot so judas iscariot does not have a throne in heaven he went to his own place he was the son of perdition judas iscariot went to hell and so consider this friends we see some bride members in revelation chapter 4. let's listen to the quote how many was he 20 and four 24 elders is that right now oh my who was it the twelve apostles and the twelve tribes of israel the twelve patriarchs revelation chapter 5 we see a repeat of the same bride members in verse 8 it again names the 24 elders 12 of them were bride members and the other 12 were the 12 sons of israel and in verse 13 the bible said every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the sea and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i sang of course this is speaking of saint john so saint john was no doubt a bride member so we see a beautiful picture of the supernatural nature of visions here john is in a vision seeing himself as one of those 24 elders in the heavenly dimension and of course god's prophet brother branham said john saw his name on the lamb's book of life causing him to rejoice let's listen to the quote and uh john said everybody in heaven everything beneath the earth everything you're him praising god about it john was without his name on there doing david all that time then he said he is worthy to take the book of redemption in revelation chapter 6 we see even more mentions of the bride or church from brother branham in this first quote in the first seal brother branham said the white horse rider rode during the first church age the first seal dealt with the beginning of the gentile church ages let's listen to the quote oh anti souls close to the sea the very elect here he is he's the antichrist he started riding the first church age now he rides on down on down through every age i watch next in the second seal brother branham said the red horse rider wrote during the dark ages which was in the fourth church age and there were bride members of course during the fourth church age so we see what the bride members were anointed by during the church ages the line anointing the ox anointing and also the evil spirit they were combating the white horse rider and the red horse rider let's listen to the quote there's a seal they admit 68 million all their mortarology besides all those cut to death outside of that oh mercy during the dark ages there were millions fed the lions and slaughtering that way because they wouldn't bow down to that catholic document in the third seal brother branham said the black horse rider rode during the dark ages of course the dark ages were during the time of the church ages the holy ghost filled saints had the anointing of a man and they were battling the black horse rider let's listen to the quote he started riding him in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was lit watch now and that church age at middle church is the dark church in the next quote from the fourth seal brother ram said the message of the four horse riders from revelation chapter 6 was one of the main messages to the church at this time so the bride believers of brother branham's day or our day needed to know the messages about the four horse riders in order that we might understand church history and also overcome the rider of our day the pale horse rider so brother branham is saying bride members today needed to know what previous bride members had gone through under the first three seals because we know in the four seal we're battling the same spirit because the same rider just changed horses so bride members today will overcome the antichrist spear let's listen to the quote just uh thought this one wouldn't come but it finally did so i'm so thankful that being the last of those four harsh writers which i think is one of the main messages to the church at this time the next sermon from the fifth seal brother brown gives us many mentions of how the church is mentioned in the first four seals in paragraph 116 brother branham said god sent another one after him to combat it to hold his church so brother brahm's talking about how the holy ghost anointing of the four beasts would come upon the bride or church members and that anointing would help them overcome satan's four riders let's listen to the quote he went out again as a red horse rider another color another power another mystery god sent another one entry to combat of the holy shirt sent the third one again god said his third beast coming now said he said the fourth one god sent his fourth one and then the antichrist in and the church ages ended two at that time in paragraph 124 brother branham mentions why the early church had healings miracles and visions and power it was because of the anointing of the line of the tribe of judah and he said it had to ride during the first church the apostolic so the first seal had to do with the bride members of the early church let's listen to the quote that's the reason early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was the living word in the form of the light of the tribe of judah right now to combat that amen now you got it he sends his power antichrist god chance is the word antichrist false teaching the true teaching went with it the combat that was a person now this was the first church apostolic that went to media in paragraph 129 during the thyroid or church age the little church had to just simply labor with the ox anointing so he's speaking directly of the bride church members during the church ages and the bride members could only live based upon the anointing that they'd received from heaven and then in paragraph 130 he said the same thing about the ox anointing and how the saints just freely gave their lives in the dark ages let's listen to the quotes see that shows that the phytara age as the antichrist got settled down and come into the thought of the age the little church could do nothing but just just simply labor next in paragraph 140 brother branham said the opening of the seals proved church history and the four beast powers that were let loose upon the church they were anointings and the believers couldn't do nothing else let's listen to the quote i will prove to you by the history of the church and by the the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else next in paragraph 145 brother brandon mentioned the spirit of the church in that day was sacrifice labor he said they were anointed with a true spirit of god of that age 68 million of them died he said the ox sacrifice anointing let's listen to the quotes because the spirit of the church and that they will sacrifice labor and their walkthroughs as freely as they can walk anointed with the true spirit of god of that age and die like heroes and sacrifice thousands times thousands 68 million of them on the record in paragraph 150 brother branham mentions the cunningness of god's wisdom anointing the believers during the age of the reformation so he's speaking of the third seal which dealt with the bride members during the church ages let's listen to the i went quote combat with the continuous of god's wisdom with him that was the age of the reformation martin luther john wesley and so forth see it was a reformation paragraph 164 brother makes a powerful statement that god put a spirit of wisdom upon martin luther and john wesley and he said they brought the church from its pagan ceremonies of idolatry back to god again so during the third seal we saw the holy ghost anoint the preachers of the reformation to bring the church back to god again the bride church so the bride is seen in the first four seals let's listen to the quote but see at that time of all the man's being see god put a spirit of wisdom upon man to understand it's wrong now that was to combat the third beast that got the church so corrupt that he was riding that it was terrible they're informed uh uh what did they do then they in the reformers age they brought the church from its pagan ceremonies of idolatry back to god again in paragraph 177 we receive an amazing statement from brother branham he said don't forget it class remember all the days of your life these beasts are correct it's thus saith the lord and then immediately after that he talks about the man beast anointing with the power of god the wisdom that god gave them brought the church from idolatry back to god so friends we have thus saith the lord that the first four seals are speaking of the four holy ghost anointings that god sent down from heaven to anoint the bride members throughout the church ages let's listen to the quote i don't forget this class don't forget remember all the days of your life these beasts are correct it's thus saith the lord notice idolatry brought the man beast went forth with the power of god by wisdom that god gave him and brought the church from idolatry back to god in paragraph 185 brother makes a beautiful statement he never knew the beast before he was just sitting there and then saw move up in a vision so see how a vision changed brother rams thinking he had thought revelation 4 to 19 was all jewish but the vision of the holy ghost showed him that there was bride anointings in revelation chapter four five and six because all three chapters mention the four beasts let's listen to the quote and you're around beast uh uh i never knew that before i was just sitting there getting moved up there just the same as you're looking at me and it's got to be right because it's right here with the bible so how are you going to do anything else but say it's right next from paragraphs 193 to 214 brother branham begins looking at the eagle anointing which was the holy ghost anointing upon him and the believers of this day so the fourth seal is all about the gentile bride of our church age you and i by god's grace so is the bride scene in revelation chapter 6 yes the bride members of our day are seen in the fourth seal we have the flying eagle anointing in paragraph 193 brother brahm said the last power is the eagle power to restore the children back to the original faith again of course quoting malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 and then he quotes revelation 10 verses 1 to 7. let's listen to the quotes he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original faith again don't you notice there's no more beasts that's all of us amen now if you would take now revelations 10 1-7 i've been referring to it remember in the last messenger's age see what was to happen all of the mysteries of god would be revealed in paragraph 211 brother random said this eagle anointing has got to come to this seer based upon revelation 10 1-7 let's listen to the quote every word of god is brought the bible doesn't change the system at all it's the same thing it's got to come to this seer that we're expecting to arrive now notice revelations 10 1 7. and then in paragraph 214 brother branham said isn't this the prophet we're looking to come some man anointed with the spirit of elijah but abram said his very ministry would restore the people back to the original faith of the fathers let's listen to the quote now isn't the prophet that we're looking to come some man anointed with the with the spirit uh like elijah it won't be elijah of course but to be a man like that will come down and his very ministry is to send to restore back to this fallen people in these denominational twists back to the original faith of the father [Applause] now friends no doubt there's more quotes like this in the seven seals series but i'm gonna go ahead and move on to revelation chapter seven friends we see either the bride or the foolish virgin at the end of revelation chapter seven now of course i believe it's the bride and if you'd like to watch my video about that you can easily find it on my youtube channel it was my 87th video it's called is revelation 7 the wise bride or foolish virgin so again revelation chapter 7 is not all jewish either the bride or foolish virgin is in revelation chapter 7. revelation chapter 8 the seven seals mentioned and the seventh seal is the literal day and hour of jesus christ coming for his gentile bride there are numerous quotes from brother branham about this subject let's just listen to a couple a lamb took his book from the seventh seal just ready for it to be opened the sixth seal remember he hid the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood day by day telling him but then he wouldn't do it on that so there's silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the and lord comes from heaven with ten thousands times ten thousands of his saints and the bible says that the heavens was empty for the space of a half hour where is this big fellow god damn see he's in christ in revelation chapter 10 brother branham's ministry is seen in verses 1 through 7 and then verses 8 through 11 is the ministry of the bride who eats the little book eats the revelation of the seven seals and goes and prophesies it again to the rest of the world so of course revelation chapters 10 is not all jewish i'm not going to play quotes about that because i've already played quotes about that from the fifth seal that brother branham preached earlier in revelation 13 verse 16 we see the bride according to brother branham in the sermon from 1962 spoken word is original seed brother brahm said the bride would be forced to stop preaching by the ecumenical system the b system so again we see the bride in revelation chapter 13. let's listen to the quote i believe someday the real bride of christ will be force to stop preaching the word of god the bible prophesies of it in revelations 13 16 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the lord for this in revelation chapter 14 verses 6 through 12 brother branham taught that we see the last three church age messengers and of course that would be martin luther john wesley and brother branham brother ram taught this in the mark of the beast and the seal of god part 2 from 1961. let's listen to the quotes i know i'd like you to scout your pencils to write this down i'd like to write down revelations 14 6-12 that's the three last angels three angels at the seventh angel there were three special angels come forth did you notice that watch the first angel at the reformation leave her preach the gospel second angel wesley's sanctification the fornication is straightened up for the church but the third message the pentecostal message should be the true messenger warning them to escape the mark of the be sin whosoever receives the mark of the beast was saying will drink the wrath of god poured out that mixture into the cup a big dignity poured out of all the people that's the very message today the third angel the third message the last message the lutheran message of justification the wesley message of sanctification and the pentecostal message of the seal of god escape the american of these be conquerors into the kingdom of god seven proofs the book of revelation is not in chronological order friends there's at least seven proofs but there could be more that the book of revelation is not in chronological order the first example is the first four seals of revelation chapter six according to brother branham these were actually taking place at the same time as revelation chapters two and three so the first four seals of revelation 6 did not happen after revelation 2 and 3 they happened at the same time the second example is the trumpets of revelation chapters 8 and 9. these trumpets cannot be blown before the mystery of god is finished to the gentiles in revelation chapter 10 because the mystery of god must be finished first and then destruction would come wrath would come upon the world for rejecting revelation 10 1-7 this is also proven by the fact that the first trumpet cannot be blown until the 144 000 saints are sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost as seen in revelation chapter 7 verse 3. so please read that scripture and then also read revelation 8 verse 7 because there we see trees are destroyed so again this proves revelation 8 and 9 is not chronologically before revelation chapter 10. a third example is revelation 10 verses 8 through 11. it's a ministry to the gentiles as we mentioned earlier the open book prophecy is taken to every people nation tongue and tribe of course this would happen before the beginning of revelation 7 when the 144 000 jews are sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost so we can see revelation 10 8 through 11 happens before revelation chapter 7. in revelation chapter 12 there's numerous things that are not in chronological order such as the war in heaven when satan was cast out by michael the archangel of course that happened way before the church ages but yet it's in revelation chapter 12 so we see it's not in order also in revelation chapter 12 you see the birth of the man child speaking of jesus christ's birth well of course jesus christ birth was before the church ages it was before revelation chapters two and three so we can again see how the book of revelation is not in chronological order a fifth example is brother branham taught revelation 13 verses 1 to 10 was during the church ages this was when the beast was wounded to death brother branham said the pagan roman empire but came back to life as the holy roman empire and brother ram taught this in chapter 5 of the church age book let's listen to the quote and right in this age is when the feast of revelation 13 3 that was wounded to death the pagan roman empire came back to life and power as the holy roman empire rome as a material nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely but it mattered not now for her religious empire would keep her on top of the world governing from the inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside and again you can see how revelation 13 1-10 does not fully deal with the jews because there's gentiles mentioned so again just more proof that brother branham grew in revelation on this subject a sixth example is the prophecy of the united states in revelation chapter 13. brother braham said the beast out of the land was the united states and the united states had power to make fire come down from heaven which he said was the atomic bombs of world war ii from revelation 13 verse 13. of course this took place during the seventh church age and this quote is from the mark of the beast 1954. let's listen to the quote two horns like a lamb not a lamb what is it it's our american buffalo sure see there he is two horns like a lamb but then what he knew he would have freedom of religion first he acted like a lamb he spoke like a lamb but remember he never didn't become an old ram he was the lamb this country's only 150 years old you know just the land and then he speak like a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first beast had before the red dragon and caused all that was on the earth to dwell upon the earth to worship the beast whose deadly womb was healed [Applause] and and he does great wonders so to make so far come down our heaven the atomic bomb and hydrogen smart intelligent nation and so forth deceiving the nations by these things this united states will come to a time that church and state will unite together a seventh and final example as brother ram said revelation 13 verse 16 will be the bride being forced to stop preaching the bride is still preaching now so this is not yet fulfilled and yet brother branham said the bride went up in revelation 4 verse 1. so we see the bride is still here in revelation chapter 13. and remember friends brother ram said the holy spirit told him to pick up his pen and write this about the bride so let's listen to both quotes the quote where brother branham said the church went up in revelation chapter 4 verse 1 because the door was open in heaven and let's again hear the quote about the bride being forced to stop preaching revelations 4 1 after the church was gone then a door was open and we went through all that and found that that was christ was the door and the same voice that was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks also was the same voice he heard in heaven saying come up hither john went up that represented the church going in the rapture i believe sunday the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of god the bible prophesies of it in revelations 13 16 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its mark then when the lamb will take his pride and judge the horde for this brother branham likely got this idea about the church not being seen from clarence larkin last year when i was studying clarence larkin i came across this quote from his book dispensational truce chapter 11. larkin wrote and i quote the book of revelation is written in chronological order after the fourth chapter the church is seen no more upon the earth until she appears in the 19th chapter coming with the bridegroom from heaven end quote of course we know brother branham studied clarence larkin brother branham appreciated clarence larkin even thanked him when i saw this quote from clarence larkin it seemed as if this is perhaps where brother random got it from now i'm not sure but because brother branham said this at least four times almost these same exact words it seems that brother brown may have got it from larkin and recall friends brother branham was not a plagiarist as i have one video and one podcast that proved this fact my june 30th 2021 video called clarence larkin william branham and the plagiarism accusation labors on this subject and there is undeniable proof brother branham was not a plagiarist it only seems brother branham forgot to quote larkin about the future home sermon but again let's give him the benefit of the doubt he was a genuine servant of god he seemed to just make a human mistake and forgot to cite larkin but brother brandon's main emphasis was on the three works of grace which clarence larkin did not teach and that is the thought that brother and got from god which was the thought that as the earth had to go through three works for purification so does each individual believer have to go through three works of purification justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and then friends on my april 27 2022 podcast number three called seven seals plagiarized no jesus revealed seven seals to brother branham charles tays russell i clearly show how brother ram did not plagiarize the seven seals from either clarence larkin nor charles tays russell remember friends in the 1960 church age sermon series brother branham referenced historians on at least 20 occasions and specifically said the dates he used for them were from historians in 1961 brother branham thanked clarence larkin by name during his series on the daniel 70 weeks and then in 1964 brother branham plainly stated that he had read clarence larkin's work during the week he preached the seven seals but again remember brother branham's revelations were vastly different than larkin's teachings they only agreed on the sixth seal so on the six other seals brother branham and larkin totally disagreed proving brother and got his revelations from the lord jesus christ in closing i hope this video has been a blessing friends it's another exercise of rightly dividing the word of truth brother branham was a genuine prophet of god but of course not every word he said on tape was thus saith the lord and this video again shows how brother adam could repeat a statement that he believed over and over again believing the bride was not seen from revelation 4 to 19 but then when we look at more quotes from brother branham we see that god showed him visions of the four beasts and then showed how those four beasts were anointings on the bride members during the church ages in revelation chapter 6. and of course we know brother brahms ministry was in revelation chapter 10. so we can plainly see it's our duty as ministers as believers to rightly divide the word of truth prove all things by the scripture take everything back to the word of god to confirm it as brother branham taught us and of course as the bible commands us to do so we're grateful that jesus's words are true today he said the holy ghost will guide you into all truth that's exactly what jesus christ is doing so we praise his holy name for that and we thank him for the anointing of the holy spirit the spirit of truth that allows us to do this if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
