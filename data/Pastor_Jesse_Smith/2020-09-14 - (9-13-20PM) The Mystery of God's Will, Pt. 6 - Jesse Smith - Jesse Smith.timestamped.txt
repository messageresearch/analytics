[29:20] this morning we finished with uh little
[29:22] ministries we actually say little but
[29:24] they're important but we would say
[29:27] they're
[29:27] they're underneath the leadership of the
[29:29] church the apostle prophet
[29:32] and all the fivefold ministry then we
[29:34] look at the ministries under that
[29:38] providing relief and those types of
[29:40] ministries prayers and

[29:58] on three one

[30:15] before your throne lord god and
[30:17] as i looked over lord at the bread and
[30:19] the wine and
[30:20] remembering lord god what you did this
[30:23] is
[30:24] uh the ordinance you asked us to do lord
[30:26] and we're so glad that we can partake of
[30:28] it
[30:29] lord growing up those 18 years of
[30:30] denomination i had no idea what i was
[30:32] doing drinking grape juice and
[30:34] little bits of crackers lord i didn't i

[30:38] and lord you were patient with me now i
[30:41] know lord god
[30:42] i'm to remember your death in order to
[30:45] remember
[30:46] the holy spirit's life and the bread of
[30:49] the word the unleavened life and
[30:51] the life of the holy spirit now lord god
[30:53] i'm to partake of it daily
[30:55] until you come lord help me lord take up
[30:57] my cross tonight help each one of us to
[30:59] do the same lord god
[31:01] as we get into your word anoint me to
[31:03] preach in your people
[31:04] to receive lord and brother bang to give
[31:06] his testimony and
[31:08] especially pray for the young people
[31:09] lord that they can hear these
[31:11] these words lord god and lord it will
[31:14] guide them but it will be training to
[31:16] them
[31:17] to trust you all the days of their life
[31:19] so anoint us god in my divine presence
[31:22] in jesus christ's name the saint said
[31:24] amen god bless you being seated praise
[31:26] god
[31:31] um or lydia could you put up a just i
[31:34] got one just quote i want to share
[31:37] um i was listening brother tim pruitt
[31:38] preach and i started listening to him a
[31:40] lot more you know since donnie reagan
[31:41] got sick i listened to tim
[31:42] heard a lot how's danny reagan doing
[31:44] does anybody know anybody happen to know
[31:47] i haven't heard anything okay i knew
[31:50] brother daryl ward got better
[31:52] i don't know how brother donnie's doing
[31:54] i know they were praying really hard for
[31:55] him so
[31:56] i've been listening to tim fruit a lot
[31:58] lately he's been preaching some
[31:59] fantastic
[32:00] message i think i shared one with amen
[32:02] just some really good messages
[32:03] i really appreciate his gift um so
[32:06] here's one where he just brings out a
[32:08] simple quote about all the gifts are in
[32:09] the promised land
[32:12] now remember the story remember the
[32:13] spies brought
[32:15] fruit out of the land right uh to show
[32:18] to show
[32:18] beforehand before they entered in so
[32:21] that would be what we would refer to
[32:22] uh people that are not born again that
[32:24] still have access to the gifts right
[32:26] they can go into the land and bring out
[32:30] the gifts but they don't live in the
[32:31] land
[32:33] because their life proves they don't
[32:35] they don't have a possession they don't
[32:36] have
[32:37] uh the character of the land right they
[32:39] don't live there
[32:40] but we're supposed to have a permanent
[32:41] dwelling in the things of god
[32:43] amen day in day out week and week out of
[32:46] living in god's land praise god
[32:48] amen i'm possessing the land god has
[32:51] called me to possess
[32:52] right and so that's a beautiful thought
[32:54] brother man brings it out i'm going to
[32:56] skip down to verse
[32:57] where he talks about let's get down to
[32:58] here with joshua he started with a new
[33:00] generation a leadership with joshua
[33:02] who believed the word amen and he took
[33:04] them to the promised land oh god
[33:06] may this young generation of
[33:08] pentecostals get
[33:10] the vision and this is after the seals
[33:13] i don't think he's talking about
[33:14] denominational pentecostals he's talking
[33:16] about us
[33:16] holy ghost-filled saints praise god
[33:19] anyone who's got the holy ghost he's
[33:20] talking about
[33:22] and he says get the vision see they went
[33:25] on
[33:26] to the promised land we ought to be
[33:28] aware we have all kinds of the gifts of
[33:30] god
[33:31] we did speak with tongues that's that's
[33:32] fine that's that's right
[33:34] nothing against that uh moses crossed
[33:36] the red sea the enemy was killed behind
[33:37] him we we appreciate that
[33:39] that's still not all of it praise god so
[33:41] the point he's making
[33:42] we want to do we don't just want to
[33:44] partake of that little by little
[33:46] uh we want to live there praise god we
[33:48] want to be blessed with the gifts
[33:49] daily praise god and you'll see i try to
[33:52] make it
[33:53] i think each time we study it it gets
[33:55] more clear don't you think
[33:57] and i've searched sister wendy for years
[33:59] i've searched the internet can somebody
[34:01] give me the definitions of the fruits of
[34:03] the
[34:03] gifts of the spirit i've never found a
[34:05] good one that lines up with brother
[34:06] brown's message
[34:07] that's why i'm writing a book because
[34:10] there's no there's no place to go
[34:12] there's no place to go to get something
[34:13] where you have a good
[34:15] summary of everything brother brahms
[34:17] said about it and it's all lined up with
[34:18] the word
[34:19] you don't have any place to go there's
[34:21] nowhere to go so
[34:22] we want to do that we want to be a
[34:24] blessing and we want to uh
[34:25] do our part praise god now uh just let's
[34:28] start with that verse
[34:29] they're given to everyone to profit with
[34:32] all
[34:32] so gifts uh help others increase right a
[34:36] profit is an increase
[34:37] in the greek so when a gift operates
[34:40] someone's spiritual condition
[34:41] is increased praise god and remember you
[34:44] have the choice
[34:46] to let it uh to believe it or not to
[34:48] accept that increase or not
[34:50] right because the bible said because of
[34:51] unbelief jesus could not do many
[34:53] miracles there
[34:54] the gifts wanted to operate jesus wanted
[34:56] to bless them and
[34:58] increase their uh their love for god and
[35:00] and help them and heal them
[35:02] but unbelief kept it out so we got to
[35:04] have a heart of belief praise god
[35:06] let's have a heart of belief tonight by
[35:07] god's grace let me set a timer here
[35:09] so i'm cautious of everything uh
[35:16] so let's have open hearts praise god now
[35:18] i want to uh
[35:19] remind you that again gifts and callings
[35:21] of god are without repentance
[35:22] uh before you even repent your gifts are
[35:25] in you before birth
[35:26] um right after i started preaching i got
[35:28] an email from
[35:30] i think i told my wife this but an
[35:31] ex-girlfriend in high school before i
[35:33] started dating my wife
[35:34] uh she didn't live in our town she lived
[35:36] in another town and she just even
[35:38] emailed me out of the blue her name was
[35:40] janine and uh
[35:41] she's like what are you doing i'm like
[35:43] i'm preaching the gospel
[35:45] she's like i always knew you would be a
[35:47] preacher
[35:48] and i'm like how did you know i was
[35:51] going to be a preacher
[35:52] i wasn't a christian and she just said
[35:56] the way you carried yourself and i look
[35:58] back now and i want to bring that
[36:01] newspaper article one time it says
[36:03] jesse's gang rides again
[36:05] right you'll ride this trail again
[36:09] uh and you know even when we won the
[36:10] state championship they
[36:12] they were seniors up there but i was a
[36:13] junior they asked me to speak
[36:15] and i never felt like i was a good
[36:16] speaker and i wonder if that's part of
[36:18] it
[36:18] but i just thought wow that's
[36:20] interesting and then when the first time
[36:22] we went to sheffield
[36:23] sister kim browning brother samuel's
[36:25] wife
[36:26] she said she looked at me and said he's
[36:28] going to be a preacher someday and i had
[36:29] long hair and i just i wasn't
[36:31] i wasn't fit in the part really good you
[36:33] know i had my gym shoes on and you know
[36:35] i just
[36:36] i never didn't look the part but she
[36:38] knew uh
[36:39] and so that that that uh validates
[36:43] jeremiah 1 5 that god knew
[36:46] and placed the gifts in us before our
[36:48] birth and each of us have a purpose that
[36:50] we must fulfill
[36:52] praise god and i'll just say like this
[36:55] who would have thought that i would have
[36:57] been the first
[36:58] message preacher to stand up and debate
[37:00] believe the sign
[37:01] of all the message preachers and the
[37:03] brothers told me they asked many many
[37:04] preachers
[37:05] now i'm not i'm not saying i'm any i'm
[37:07] not nothing i'm just saying like i
[37:09] wouldn't think
[37:10] i would be the one there's so many
[37:12] there's brothers that knew brother
[37:13] branham
[37:15] that i would thought but nobody wanted
[37:17] to do a part of it and if they said they
[37:18] did then whatever it
[37:19] never worked out uh
[37:23] you know i would i would have never
[37:24] looked at my life you're in high school
[37:26] like oh i'm gonna
[37:27] i'm gonna try to defend the christian
[37:29] faith someday i'm gonna you know
[37:30] i just never would me no way
[37:34] but uh we know it's god will bring out
[37:37] whatever's in there if we allow it to
[37:39] come out
[37:40] we don't want to remember you can bury
[37:41] your gift in the ground we don't want to
[37:42] bury it and
[37:43] hide from it we want to use it for god's
[37:46] grace amen
[37:47] and that's what i want to be i want to
[37:48] be a you yield a vessel that god can
[37:50] operate
[37:51] his extraordinary because remember a
[37:53] gift is an extraordinary power
[37:56] in our lives to help his people praise
[37:58] god
[37:59] and that's what it is to help other
[38:00] people so in other words somebody needs
[38:03] your service
[38:05] somebody needs you because that's what a
[38:06] gift is for it's not for you right
[38:09] and so god help us to have that attitude
[38:11] lord show me who needs me today
[38:14] that i can help whether like it's
[38:16] through helps
[38:17] or whether it's through prayer for the
[38:19] sick uh whatever i can do lord show me
[38:22] how i can help because i am here because
[38:25] someone needs me
[38:27] right and the bible says you'll never
[38:28] have to force yourself into it proverbs
[38:30] 18
[38:30] 16 a man's gift makes room for him and
[38:33] bringeth him before great men think
[38:35] about brother graham
[38:37] standing next to richard nixon at that
[38:40] prayer breakfast my a seventh grade
[38:43] educated man
[38:44] right next to richard nixon my i just
[38:46] thank god my god is
[38:48] his word is so true praise god he can
[38:50] raise up the most humble the most little
[38:53] uh those that seem like they have no
[38:54] chance at all god specializes in raising
[38:57] them up praise god
[38:59] through a gift through a gift it's not
[39:01] even their power
[39:02] right uh but it's god's power and if
[39:05] we're faithful to god's power it will
[39:08] raise us up praise god
[39:11] so your gift has a god-ordained place to
[39:13] fit into
[39:15] your gifts will edify that word edify
[39:17] means build up
[39:19] let's can you pull out first corinthians
[39:21] 14 5 just to see
[39:23] the greatest gifts are ones that help
[39:25] the most people so i hope
[39:27] my preaching gifts as much as i try to
[39:29] study and pray and humble myself i hope
[39:31] all of you are being built up every time
[39:33] we gather i i just hope and pray i
[39:35] i do not want to build i would not want
[39:36] to tear you down i want to build you up
[39:38] by god's grace
[39:40] i know i've got we've all you know the
[39:41] holy spirit we know is a sword it cuts
[39:43] us right but
[39:43] it's to build us up in the end right so
[39:46] we can
[39:47] be healed and the balm applied to the
[39:49] cut and
[39:50] and be healed if we if we need some
[39:53] uh correction now first corinthians 14
[39:56] 5 i would that y'all speak with tongues
[39:58] but rather that you prophesied for
[40:00] greater is he that prophesy
[40:01] than he that speaketh with tongues
[40:03] except the interpret that the church may
[40:05] receive
[40:06] edifying now again
[40:09] greater that doesn't mean like he's
[40:10] greater like he's a greater christian
[40:12] he can just be used in a greater way
[40:15] right
[40:16] uh and it's all about god's wisdom you
[40:18] know
[40:19] uh none of us should ever complain well
[40:21] i wish my gift was greater i wish i'd
[40:23] you know
[40:24] god's the one who determined your gift
[40:26] praise god whether it's five two or one
[40:28] talent right god's the one who
[40:30] determines so just be happy with what we
[40:32] got yeah long for more i love that song
[40:34] but even about longing for more take
[40:35] that's that's beautiful god if we're
[40:37] faithful with it god will increase it
[40:39] praise god
[40:40] we know that and if others fail god may
[40:44] put that burden on us right or god may
[40:46] give us that burden and give us ability
[40:49] praise god there's one story brother ram
[40:51] told uh there was a husband and wife
[40:53] and they heard brother evan's message
[40:55] she was a woman preacher i forget the
[40:56] name of the couple karen might remember
[40:58] i don't know
[40:59] it's a story but i'm told and when she
[41:02] heard the message she sat down
[41:03] and brother man said the gift went on
[41:05] her husband now of course he was already
[41:07] ordained to be a preacher but
[41:09] that extra anointing came on him
[41:12] uh and so there's uh numerous examples
[41:16] we could say where if someone's not
[41:17] faithful with it like with judas
[41:19] he wasn't faithful so god raised up
[41:21] matthias and i know he got it by lot
[41:22] but he did a lot for the kingdom of god
[41:25] he took the kingdom a very long way so
[41:27] did thomas right remember we've been
[41:28] through that a little bit
[41:29] thomas did a lot for god he only dotted
[41:31] for just a little bit
[41:32] but after that he was a soldier servant
[41:36] and so uh we want to be we want to do
[41:39] all we can do to build people up
[41:42] okay and so this is maturity you know if
[41:45] you're in the promised land
[41:47] and you're really living in the promised
[41:49] land and you're harvesting fruits of the
[41:51] holy spirit praise god
[41:53] you've got lots of fruits of the holy
[41:54] spirit and then you've got gifts of the
[41:56] holy spirit
[41:58] uh it's maturity on how you use them
[42:01] you gotta so this this is what i'm
[42:03] talking about is that one of the highest
[42:05] levels of maturity if you're baptized
[42:06] with the holy ghost
[42:08] and now you know your gifts and then
[42:10] investing in those gifts
[42:11] now we're talking adoption praise god
[42:14] right
[42:15] and even even if you can just look at
[42:16] one of those nine and say i know god's
[42:18] used me for that
[42:19] and you can look at that and pray for
[42:21] that say god just increase it and
[42:23] and then use me for any of the other
[42:24] eight whenever if you
[42:26] if you want to use me here i am praise
[42:28] god that's i think that's i think that's
[42:30] maturity don't you
[42:33] where because brother branson a lot of
[42:34] people don't get gifts operating because
[42:36] they're not yielded to god
[42:37] they're they're not consecrated and so
[42:40] that's why i like going through the
[42:41] testimonies and hearing all these
[42:42] testimonies of god
[42:43] doing great things that oh thank god
[42:46] we're uni
[42:46] that we can be unto the holy spirit
[42:48] praise god but we want to do more
[42:51] so i love it i love hearing those
[42:53] testimonies thank god
[42:55] now it they also keep the church clean
[42:57] peter had a gift of discernment
[42:59] and he discerned ananias and sapphiris
[43:02] lie and the bible said great fear
[43:06] came upon all the church so see what
[43:09] when gifts operate brother
[43:10] said he said if you are really a child
[43:12] of god and you see a gift operate he
[43:14] said it thrills your heart
[43:16] that's why i get through when you guys
[43:17] give your testimonies and people getting
[43:19] healed and
[43:20] dreams and uh god doing miracles in your
[43:23] lives
[43:24] it thrills my heart praise god because
[43:25] i'm a believer praise god
[43:28] i am and i want to hear what is god
[43:30] doing in your life wendy and karen
[43:32] i love to hear what god is doing because
[43:35] it's uh
[43:35] it's you uh investing in your gifts and
[43:38] being faithful
[43:39] and god using them to help other people
[43:41] praise god
[43:42] accomplishing your purpose on the earth
[43:44] amen amen hallelujah
[43:46] see it's growing up into maturity we
[43:48] want to help as many people as possible
[43:55] so i'm just happy i got that number
[43:57] million in my head we've helped over a
[43:59] million people
[43:59] [Laughter]
[44:01] i was at least a couple thousand of
[44:02] those just watching my videos make sure
[44:04] they
[44:05] you know they play the right way what
[44:07] did i say on that video
[44:09] sometimes i gotta go back and reference
[44:11] what what's the revelation on that one
[44:13] you
[44:14] can't remember everything but think
[44:16] about like that's a blessing to me and
[44:18] church
[44:18] your ties paid for my computer and the
[44:20] cameras to do those things
[44:22] your ties you gotta part in that that's
[44:25] what i use it for i mean i
[44:26] break most of the ties go to this it's
[44:28] reading right here which i love to do it
[44:30] but it's your ties that pay for the
[44:31] computer and uh the camera and
[44:33] everything
[44:34] and we it's all we're all in this
[44:36] together praise god i know that's a
[44:37] saying the world likes to use but
[44:39] we are all in this together praise god
[44:42] it's a it's a
[44:43] a body work praise god
[44:46] but see when gifts operate great fear
[44:49] see that reverence that's what we want
[44:50] church
[44:51] we want to come to church and that's why
[44:53] it's nice to see gifts operate here
[44:54] because it just creates a
[44:56] more of a reverent atmosphere because
[44:58] you know we all get loose
[44:59] i'm guilty you know we all get human
[45:02] but it doesn't have to operate here but
[45:04] it's just nice when it does praise god
[45:07] because it just creates a fear and
[45:09] reverence among the people
[45:10] that's what we want we want and we know
[45:12] god loves us because this was the book
[45:13] of acts church
[45:14] when peter was discerning that and
[45:16] people falling dead and
[45:18] uh people great signs and wonders and
[45:20] miracles there was super reverence
[45:22] people were ready to pray right they
[45:23] were ready to hear the word they're
[45:25] ready to sing
[45:26] everybody felt god's presence amen and
[45:29] that's what gifts are
[45:30] for praise god they're to build
[45:33] uh they're to edify they're to keep
[45:35] clean praise god
[45:38] and but remember we must as you know uh
[45:41] it's all about seeking the giver first
[45:43] right give yourself to the lord first
[45:45] and then
[45:46] he'll give you to somebody to help now
[45:48] pull up first corinthians 14 1 honey
[45:50] uh if you do that
[45:54] and brother bam's recommendation was
[45:55] never seek uh the gifts first he said
[45:58] always seek the giver
[46:01] okay but i just showed you those
[46:02] scriptures this morning desire the gifts
[46:04] right
[46:05] but follow charity so in other words we
[46:07] follow the holy spirit
[46:09] and at the same time we desire wisdom
[46:12] we desire knowledge we desire prophecy
[46:15] oh i want to know the future don't you
[46:17] amen just like the man said don't you
[46:19] want to look past the curtain of time
[46:21] praise god who wouldn't want to look
[46:22] past the curtain of time
[46:23] to know what's going to happen amen no
[46:26] matter what comes and goes no matter
[46:27] what storms come
[46:28] god has showed us the future we we have
[46:31] quite a few though yeah
[46:32] we have quite a few with uh uh the this
[46:34] prophecies brotherhood
[46:35] gave us follow after cherry so we are
[46:38] always following love
[46:40] anything i'm always going after love how
[46:42] can i love this person
[46:44] and as you're loving how can i love the
[46:45] church as i'm following that
[46:47] at the same time i'm desiring the nine
[46:49] gifts of the spirit to operate
[46:52] but this is what i need to grow in i
[46:54] need to pray for more prophecy
[46:57] right we need to pray for more of that
[47:01] because that's what the bible says it
[47:02] edifies the saints more
[47:05] i don't think if we had brother bang
[47:07] have we had a prophecy
[47:10] we had the discernment was by stephen
[47:12] and i confirmed that with three people
[47:14] that was
[47:14] 2006 or maybe quite a long time ago i
[47:17] don't know if you ever had a prophecy
[47:20] i can't think of any i don't think so
[47:24] now we've had dreams that were prophetic
[47:25] amen and who had one like that prophetic
[47:27] um my wife and i have dreams that was
[47:29] just before we were church though
[47:31] uh so see that's why the bible says it's
[47:34] important to pray for prophecy
[47:36] to so you're prepared right so you so
[47:39] you're
[47:39] anticipating god in the future so that's
[47:43] something that we can pray for
[47:46] so follow after them and desire so see
[47:48] there's got to be a desire this is where
[47:50] a lot of churches backslide
[47:51] they stop desiring these gifts of the
[47:53] holy spirit oh you don't need them
[47:54] they're up on the shelf
[47:55] well there's quotes brother bam says we
[47:57] just read the quote if you're in the
[47:59] promised land you got all kinds of gifts
[48:01] he didn't say they're on the shelf in
[48:03] the promised land he said you got all of
[48:04] them praise god
[48:06] so you got to balance out the quotes and
[48:08] and remember if church if we're not
[48:10] desiring spiritual things then what are
[48:11] we desiring
[48:12] natural things right
[48:16] right if you're not desiring the move of
[48:17] god then you're desiring to
[48:20] i don't know go home and do something i
[48:22] don't know go to the store and buy
[48:24] something i don't know i got to battle
[48:25] that too you know
[48:26] we all battle that but see that's why
[48:28] it's so important that your desires are
[48:30] in the outworking of the holy spirit
[48:32] and praying oh god work through our
[48:34] brother work through our sister today
[48:36] and
[48:37] minister to them and may we see
[48:38] something supernatural god and
[48:41] we have to desire that amen
[48:44] so that's so important to desire that we
[48:48] are not to be
[48:48] ignorant of the gifts yeah what
[48:50] scripture was that um
[48:52] be not ignorant was that the one no
[48:55] this scripture just kind of came to me
[48:57] here let me look real quick be not
[49:00] ignorant
[49:02] maybe that's yeah chapter 14.
[49:11] can you look up lydia i thought there
[49:13] was a scripture about
[49:15] don't be ignorant of the gifts just give
[49:17] me a moment here please
[49:20] ignore it
[49:25] maybe i got a word mixed up or something
[49:29] oh no it's twelve one yeah yeah sorry
[49:32] first one is twelve one i knew it was
[49:34] there somewhere
[49:38] and that's that and that's what uh i was
[49:39] sharing you know
[49:41] you know uh i'll go websites for years
[49:43] i've gone and just give me a website
[49:45] that lists everything so i can
[49:46] know i want to know what gifts i got
[49:48] y'all going to know what is how to
[49:49] understand the bible i just haven't
[49:51] found any that's really good
[49:53] so i'm like well if nobody's got one i'm
[49:54] going to make one you know
[49:56] but the bible said now concerning
[49:57] spiritual gifts brethren i would not
[49:59] have you ignorant
[50:01] now how many master churches do you
[50:03] think could name all nine gifts of the
[50:04] spirit and then know which ones they got
[50:06] operate in their lives
[50:07] remember that sheet we printed off last
[50:09] week or last year karen
[50:11] and we wrote examples of our gifts in
[50:12] them and i it was such a small sheet and
[50:14] karen's like
[50:15] how am i going to fit all these
[50:16] testimonies on this little sheet
[50:19] i thought that was a great testimony
[50:20] sister character because i didn't know
[50:22] you know i didn't
[50:23] i just uh
[50:26] and so how many people are ignorant they
[50:30] they don't want to know about gifts they
[50:31] don't care about gifts
[50:33] but paul says you you desire as you
[50:35] follow jesus christ love of god
[50:37] you desire spiritual things right and
[50:40] you're not ignorant of them
[50:43] right now for us it might look like this
[50:45] like if you know someone has a gift of
[50:48] discernment or something like you might
[50:49] go to them prayerfully and say can you
[50:51] kind of judge the situation here i know
[50:55] we know some people that we go to for
[50:57] those things
[51:00] words of wisdom who do you know that
[51:02] real good with advice
[51:04] that's a word of wisdom who do you know
[51:06] that knows a lot about the word
[51:08] knowledge
[51:08] they give you a word open up open up the
[51:11] whole doctrine for you
[51:12] just give you that right scripture oh
[51:14] that's knowledge
[51:15] knowledge so think about that you know
[51:18] there's
[51:19] we shouldn't be ignorant of them but how
[51:20] many would i say a lot of people are
[51:22] ignorant of them a lot of people are and
[51:25] it's not for us we're supposed to be
[51:27] i hate to say it's like this but you
[51:29] know the the people that left the
[51:30] message
[51:30] they say the message people brag and say
[51:32] they're the cream of the crop
[51:33] or worthy elite now we we don't say that
[51:37] now but but do i believe we should live
[51:40] on a higher spiritual plane
[51:41] yes absolutely absolutely
[51:45] so you know just like jesus disciples
[51:49] they were going to be
[51:50] head and shoulders above the pharisees
[51:52] right i mean
[51:53] spiritually it's not something brother
[51:55] johnny we pat ourselves on the back do
[51:57] we don't pat ourselves on the back
[51:58] well i'm god's elite you know what it's
[52:01] it's it brings humility
[52:04] but we should be amen praise god we
[52:07] should be
[52:09] we should have more understanding i know
[52:12] we got more discernment praise god
[52:14] right we judge we can judge those
[52:15] spirits pretty easily right most of the
[52:17] time
[52:18] that's the worldly spirit that's the
[52:19] holy spirit right
[52:22] so we in other words we should be a
[52:23] spiritually mature
[52:25] and elite group of people amen
[52:29] praise god
[52:32] and i hope that's under i hope you
[52:34] understand that we're not exalting
[52:36] ourselves or anything but
[52:37] when you have more revelation it gives
[52:39] more understanding
[52:40] now we need to realistically access i'm
[52:43] sorry assess
[52:44] the portion of faith that we have
[52:46] because every man is given
[52:48] a portion of faith so let's go to romans
[52:50] 12 6.
[52:51] you have a portion romans 12
[52:54] 6.
[52:58] brother man is famous for making that
[52:59] quote i love it he said uh i may not
[53:02] have the faith
[53:02] uh to go in the rapture and walk like
[53:04] enoch he said in a rapture he said but
[53:06] i'm never gonna get in anybody's way who
[53:08] could
[53:09] and i love that oh i think that's so
[53:11] powerful in other words i i got a gift
[53:13] but if i don't have as much gift as that
[53:15] person
[53:15] i'm not going to get in their way i'm
[53:16] going to support them praise god amen
[53:19] and that's what we have to understand
[53:21] church even with healing
[53:22] we may not have the faith to cure cancer
[53:26] but if somebody does praise god
[53:29] go ahead amen you may have prayer for we
[53:31] say something smaller like a headache
[53:33] no headache's very serious though when
[53:35] you got one right how many can save into
[53:36] that
[53:37] when you got a headache it's really
[53:39] serious uh toothache anything
[53:42] uh but the bible said it's a proportion
[53:44] or portion
[53:45] a a measured out amount having then
[53:48] gifts differing according to the grace
[53:49] that's given to us whether prophecy
[53:51] let us prophesy according to the
[53:53] proportion of faith
[53:55] i think the most famous prophecy was
[53:56] 2013 when brother brooks told us
[53:58] in january he said the holy spirit told
[54:01] me many message
[54:02] many prominent message ministers are
[54:03] going to die this year
[54:05] that's when lee vale joseph coleman
[54:08] and numerous and i thought wow that was
[54:10] pretty
[54:12] because it was times it was time stamped
[54:14] and i think there was five if i'm not
[54:15] mistaken
[54:16] those were the two that were most
[54:17] prominent but it was time stamped i
[54:20] thought that was a genuine prophet uh
[54:21] prophecy from god
[54:22] it has to happen this year
[54:28] and so here we see uh you have a portion
[54:31] a portion just like with the towns right
[54:34] a portion of five a portion of two
[54:37] a portion of one and they operate
[54:40] uh according to the amount so you might
[54:43] not be able to move a mountain
[54:44] but you might move a hill right
[54:48] you you have a portion
[54:52] god and so whatever we have you know we
[54:55] have to understand
[54:56] god gave me that much and he wants me to
[54:58] be faithful that with that much and he
[54:59] may give me more
[55:02] because remember the parable was he
[55:03] didn't he wasn't faithful with this one
[55:05] give it to the other
[55:07] right
[55:10] okay so that's just a quick introduction
[55:13] quick review on gifs i think that was
[55:15] all i had
[55:16] let me just check real quick okay
[55:19] all right i got 20 minutes here that
[55:20] will be 40 minutes i've preached and
[55:22] then uh
[55:23] i'll stop
[55:27] all right let's quickly go well i
[55:28] shouldn't say quickly let's go through
[55:29] these just kind of thoroughly so in the
[55:31] book i list all nine and i give at least
[55:33] five examples or four examples of each
[55:34] one
[55:36] so that everybody uh can know
[55:39] uh some clear examples even from my life
[55:42] most of them are from our my life or our
[55:44] ministry
[55:45] that i give examples of okay so let me
[55:48] just see how much i
[55:49] got all right
[55:52] now and if you can if you can think
[55:54] about the testimonies we've heard from
[55:55] everybody and you can start kind of
[55:57] picking out
[55:58] well this brother this sister
[56:01] and if you're not sure come talk to me
[56:02] afterwards and remind me your
[56:04] testimonies maybe you and i can figure
[56:06] it out together
[56:07] but the whole point on that is just so
[56:09] you can start praying about that
[56:12] like lord i've seen you work in healing
[56:13] in my life help pray for others
[56:16] lord help me to be a vessel that you can
[56:18] use when someone gets sick
[56:20] right not ignoring that right but
[56:24] following charity and desiring god to
[56:26] move through your life
[56:28] praise god so wisdom is first it's the
[56:30] chief gift
[56:31] because it manages all others it's
[56:33] called the principle thing
[56:35] in proverbs 4 7. the principle thing the
[56:38] head of all things
[56:40] is wisdom solomon was honored by god
[56:43] because he asked for wisdom
[56:44] and then he proceeded to write proverbs
[56:46] which is a treasure trove of wisdom
[56:51] he had a gift of wisdom but as his life
[56:53] aged he failed to apply it all
[56:55] but jesus christ is the fullness and
[56:58] essence he's the person of wisdom praise
[57:00] god
[57:01] amen now wisdom is like sound advice so
[57:05] think about whenever someone's told told
[57:07] you to do something at a certain time
[57:09] in a certain way that's wisdom
[57:13] all right uh and it manifests its skill
[57:16] as its discretion or its judgment in the
[57:20] timely decision making
[57:23] and jesus said wisdom is validated by
[57:26] its results so you know something was
[57:27] wisdom when you look back and say wow
[57:29] had i not made this decision some bad
[57:32] things could have happened
[57:34] because jesus said wisdom is justified
[57:36] of her children
[57:38] so her children the results justify and
[57:41] tell what wisdom is
[57:42] right just like your children mothers
[57:44] you want your children their reflection
[57:45] of what you put into them praise god
[57:47] in many cases right so
[57:50] wisdom is justified over children and
[57:52] then the bible said wisdom
[57:54] builds the house amen
[57:58] and a wise man builds his house upon the
[58:00] rock
[58:02] so like a project manager building a
[58:04] house wisdom tells you what to do
[58:06] and when to do it so here's some
[58:08] examples jesus
[58:09] doing the taxes about taxes with caesar
[58:12] and giving money to god that was wisdom
[58:14] they knew what to do
[58:15] and when to do it right don't avoid one
[58:18] do both right and do it when they want
[58:20] it
[58:22] that was matthew 22 15-22 the wise
[58:26] virgins took time to repair
[58:27] extra oil in light i'm sorry for light
[58:31] in case the bridegroom tarried
[58:33] so that they're called wise virgins why
[58:36] because they made a decision i've got to
[58:38] have this ready
[58:39] uh just in case i run out later wisdom
[58:43] amen so making preparations praise god
[58:46] right now we're making preparations for
[58:48] the going away amen
[58:50] whether through the grave or through the
[58:51] sky amen we're making preparations
[58:54] praise god to make sure we got plenty of
[58:55] oil
[58:56] when the bridegroom comes that's wisdom
[59:04] third one i said paul's perception
[59:07] uh when he was surrounded by angry
[59:08] jewish counsel he had a perception that
[59:10] some of them believed in the
[59:12] resurrection
[59:14] so he shared his belief in the
[59:16] resurrection in acts 23
[59:18] verses 6 through 11 and it saved his
[59:20] life
[59:21] he's going to die he's going to get
[59:23] beaten up by the mob but he had enough
[59:25] wisdom to know oh
[59:26] here there's a group they they believe
[59:27] in the resurrection they don't if i
[59:29] bring this up
[59:30] then this this group will come and save
[59:32] my life
[59:34] and he didn't agree with either group
[59:36] right
[59:37] he didn't agree with the any of the jews
[59:38] at that time they were all both out to
[59:40] kill him the pharisees sadducees
[59:42] but he had wisdom to be able to discern
[59:43] okay this is the right time let me bring
[59:45] it up now it'll save my
[59:46] life so it's what it's
[59:49] the right the sound doctrine there's a
[59:51] sound decision
[59:52] at the right time now here's two
[59:55] examples
[59:56] um a pastor was being uh
[1:00:00] from my ministry he was being wrongly
[1:00:03] accused
[1:00:04] a preacher came in and told him he was
[1:00:06] failing as a father he was a bad father
[1:00:08] to his children and it was about
[1:00:12] his children doing extracurricular
[1:00:14] activities and i said i said no brother
[1:00:16] brown did extra extra
[1:00:17] curricular activities and all you have
[1:00:19] to do is make sure it doesn't interfere
[1:00:20] with god
[1:00:21] i basically said it like that and the
[1:00:23] brother was crying he's like brother
[1:00:24] that is a
[1:00:25] thank you for that word of wisdom
[1:00:26] because he was being condemned by
[1:00:28] another preacher
[1:00:29] saying you're not a good dad can you
[1:00:30] imagine that that's that's in the
[1:00:32] message
[1:00:33] see we got and where's where's satan in
[1:00:34] attack writing the message
[1:00:36] see where his targets right you don't
[1:00:38] have to fight at the catholic church so
[1:00:40] much he's going to fight us right here
[1:00:41] so we can expect that god help me to be
[1:00:43] on my toes help me to have my armor on
[1:00:45] praise god
[1:00:46] be ready to discern and so he literally
[1:00:50] told me on the phone crying
[1:00:52] it was a word of wisdom another brother
[1:00:54] told me i gave him a word of wisdom
[1:00:56] he was i didn't know it but he was
[1:00:57] thinking about uh
[1:00:59] quitting preaching and i told him all
[1:01:02] those talent things i preached i just
[1:01:04] it was out of service i just preached
[1:01:05] the talents and i was talking about
[1:01:07] compound interest if you just
[1:01:09] i said you can't stop investing you've
[1:01:10] got to keep investing
[1:01:12] and if you invest faithfully that little
[1:01:14] little little is going to turn into
[1:01:16] massive and i was i was preaching and i
[1:01:19] looked back now amen i was preaching
[1:01:20] right in his face and i didn't even know
[1:01:21] like i was like
[1:01:22] you invest in the gift you know you
[1:01:25] gotta don't quit just keep praying
[1:01:28] and the next week he's calling me up but
[1:01:30] he's like he said brother jess i was
[1:01:32] ready to quit
[1:01:32] and you gave me a word of wisdom not to
[1:01:34] quit
[1:01:37] and i thank the lord for that because it
[1:01:38] was it was that time he was going to
[1:01:40] quit at that time
[1:01:42] so i thank the lord now anybody here
[1:01:45] i'll let you share it right now from
[1:01:46] your chair
[1:01:47] anybody here can think of a good word of
[1:01:48] wisdom maybe in your life or
[1:01:50] it's okay if you can't i couldn't think
[1:01:51] of many either you know i think so many
[1:01:53] things happen it's
[1:01:55] if you don't write them down and make a
[1:01:57] a john graham log because he's so good
[1:01:59] that guy and i love you john you
[1:02:02] probably not listen
[1:02:03] that man was he's a it's like loris
[1:02:04] loris is like
[1:02:06] i went to lawrence's house one time i
[1:02:08] said hey brother you've been running
[1:02:09] lately
[1:02:09] he got out a spreadsheet of every time
[1:02:12] he's ran like the last
[1:02:13] and how the distance and the time i'm
[1:02:15] like you got different gifts than me
[1:02:18] buddy
[1:02:20] and that's i appreciate i mean god's got
[1:02:24] a great variety
[1:02:25] you know god has a variety of character
[1:02:28] okay
[1:02:29] that's how john john graham made a list
[1:02:31] a few years ago of all the supernatural
[1:02:32] in our church just to encourage us i
[1:02:33] don't know what happened to it
[1:02:35] just all the testimonies over the years
[1:02:36] you know just to keep us encouraged
[1:02:38] but anybody think of like sound wisdom
[1:02:40] you got and you knew it was the lord
[1:02:42] at a certain time i know i'm kind of
[1:02:45] putting on putting you on the spot
[1:02:47] anybody got one that's okay
[1:02:52] no problem i just thought i would give
[1:02:56] you a chance to share what if you
[1:02:57] got one see i know they happen i just
[1:02:59] like
[1:03:01] it's hard to like think back and
[1:03:02] remember it but those are the two that
[1:03:04] were fresh on my mind
[1:03:05] now word of knowledge if wisdom tells
[1:03:07] you how to build
[1:03:08] knowledge is your building materials you
[1:03:11] need both to build a house so you'll
[1:03:12] find
[1:03:13] knowledge and wisdom are associated 30
[1:03:15] times in the bible there's 30 scriptures
[1:03:17] that say wisdom and knowledge together
[1:03:19] they always go together
[1:03:20] like oil and wine and knowledge is
[1:03:23] information from god usually a scripture
[1:03:26] jesus calls knowledge a key of knowledge
[1:03:28] helps you enter into the door of god's
[1:03:30] will
[1:03:31] knowledge is understanding god's word uh
[1:03:34] needed to possess
[1:03:35] promises and escape satan's devices
[1:03:38] peter says we escape the pollutions of
[1:03:40] the world through the knowledge
[1:03:41] of our lord and savior jesus christ amen
[1:03:44] i didn't realize that right there
[1:03:45] you you escaped pollutions through the
[1:03:47] knowledge oh i
[1:03:48] i don't have to live like this praise
[1:03:50] god i don't have the devil doesn't have
[1:03:52] to stay in my house
[1:03:53] the devil has to leave in jesus name
[1:03:55] praise god
[1:03:57] you escape pollution through the
[1:03:59] knowledge the understanding
[1:04:02] of jesus christ amen peter and philip
[1:04:05] both gave knowledge
[1:04:07] peter cited joel 2 on the day of
[1:04:09] pentecost and philip
[1:04:11] quoted isaiah 53 and peter opened the
[1:04:14] door to 3 000 souls being saved
[1:04:16] and philip opened the door to the
[1:04:18] philippian eunuch to be saved
[1:04:20] they entered the door of salvation
[1:04:21] through water baptism praise god
[1:04:23] amen they're saying peter what is this
[1:04:26] it's joel 2
[1:04:27] praise god it's john 2 28 it's the
[1:04:29] knowledge of god amen
[1:04:31] and the the ethiopian
[1:04:35] what who's this talking about who is
[1:04:37] isaiah 53 he said it's jesus christ
[1:04:40] amen and he pointed them this is the
[1:04:42] knowledge of who this is
[1:04:44] and it opened the door of understanding
[1:04:46] that they could walk through
[1:04:49] acts 19 is probably the most beautiful
[1:04:51] one these they're all
[1:04:53] apollo's church is all fired up all they
[1:04:56] got is john's baptism though
[1:04:58] but paul comes in he said have you
[1:04:59] received the holy ghost since you
[1:05:00] believed
[1:05:01] and they said we didn't even know we
[1:05:03] didn't even have the knowledge
[1:05:04] of the baptism of the holy ghost he said
[1:05:06] you be baptized
[1:05:08] and he said he lays his hands on 12 of
[1:05:10] them and 12 of them get the holy ghost
[1:05:12] because they had no knowledge of the new
[1:05:13] birth but once they got their knowledge
[1:05:15] they were born again amen praise god
[1:05:19] in church i'll tell you like this
[1:05:20] talking with rod bergen yesterday nice
[1:05:21] guy he'd have any scriptures to back up
[1:05:23] what i had to say
[1:05:25] simon's like simon's like just whoa and
[1:05:27] i i think i left here saying
[1:05:29] oh i was talking to cam cam called me
[1:05:31] right after i said kim
[1:05:32] i said one thing i know brother we've
[1:05:34] got the word
[1:05:36] amen they've got intellectualism but
[1:05:38] we've got thus saith the lord amen
[1:05:40] they couldn't say nothing i was like you
[1:05:42] know i said well tell me can bruce
[1:05:44] jenner
[1:05:44] is it okay for bruce jenner to wear
[1:05:46] women's clothes because if he says yes
[1:05:48] he has to say yes because his wife can
[1:05:50] wear pants
[1:05:51] and if a woman can cross-dress it's okay
[1:05:54] for me and he said
[1:05:55] uh it's not for me to judge he said
[1:05:59] sinners are gonna sin
[1:06:00] and i'm like so when i got my turn i
[1:06:02] said it's wrong
[1:06:04] it's wrong because he was saying jesse
[1:06:05] you need to read this book read this
[1:06:06] book i said let me give you a book to
[1:06:08] read rod
[1:06:08] i said read women and pants it's a book
[1:06:11] sinners wrote
[1:06:13] and they show they show the the fall of
[1:06:16] women independence from the 1800s
[1:06:18] to the 1900s i got the book if you want
[1:06:19] if you want to borrow it but please give
[1:06:21] it back
[1:06:22] because it's a great book it was worth
[1:06:24] the read if you want to read it
[1:06:26] it was worth the read but there they
[1:06:28] there's no scripture they could say
[1:06:30] or they tried to corner me on the oh
[1:06:32] they tried to quote me on uh acts 15.
[1:06:34] they said uh brother jesse paul or paul
[1:06:37] had um a council member of the jerusalem
[1:06:39] council
[1:06:40] and the uh and they said the the they
[1:06:43] told the gentiles you only have four
[1:06:44] commands to obey
[1:06:47] and so he says see we're not under the
[1:06:49] law we're not under deuteronomy 22 5.
[1:06:51] see because the gentiles only have to
[1:06:53] obey four things
[1:06:57] oh is that right
[1:07:00] i said well sir i said well you forgot
[1:07:04] that was just the beginning to give them
[1:07:06] the foundation
[1:07:07] because paul went out in the deserts of
[1:07:09] arabia
[1:07:10] met jesus christ and jesus christ said
[1:07:12] you're a teacher to the gentiles
[1:07:15] give them the full counsel of god and
[1:07:17] then paul
[1:07:18] quotes all ten testaments from the from
[1:07:21] the oh
[1:07:21] from the ten commandments he quotes all
[1:07:24] ten commandments and brings them back to
[1:07:25] our day
[1:07:26] we are under the righteousness of the
[1:07:28] law we're we're not under the curse of
[1:07:31] the law the curse of the law is if you
[1:07:32] fail one you've missed them all
[1:07:34] we're not under that curse we can fail
[1:07:36] numerous times a day but when we confess
[1:07:38] them under the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:39] we're not guilty of all of them we're
[1:07:41] forgiven of all of them
[1:07:43] amen
[1:07:46] so see with if with their understanding
[1:07:48] then you don't even need paul's epistles
[1:07:50] because you just got four things you got
[1:07:52] to obey
[1:07:54] well they're a little too late for that
[1:07:57] see how they
[1:07:57] i said well the very one you're saying
[1:07:59] paul he was there with the four
[1:08:02] he went and said keep all these
[1:08:03] commandments without partiality he told
[1:08:06] he told that to timothy right and he
[1:08:09] said keep him without spot or blemish
[1:08:11] until the coming of the lord jesus
[1:08:12] christ amen
[1:08:17] oh i love that brother i'd love to see
[1:08:19] the lord in battle praise god
[1:08:21] let's just put the word there was
[1:08:22] numerous times i didn't know what i was
[1:08:23] going to say brother
[1:08:24] and just came out i was like oh glory
[1:08:26] praise god
[1:08:27] i didn't know what to say it just came
[1:08:29] to me because
[1:08:31] jesus promised he said when you've got
[1:08:32] the holy ghost it'll bring all things to
[1:08:34] your remembrance praise god
[1:08:36] amen now there's a few things i messed
[1:08:37] up on let me tell you one of them the
[1:08:39] last question
[1:08:40] the last question was brother rod saying
[1:08:42] he got um
[1:08:44] mistreated by message people
[1:08:47] and i felt like i messed up a little bit
[1:08:49] so if you listen to it you probably know
[1:08:50] what i'm talking about
[1:08:52] um and i just said oh brother that's
[1:08:54] heartbreaking i'm sorry to hear that
[1:08:56] but then i said i hope and i believe
[1:08:59] there
[1:08:59] are some people with divine love in
[1:09:01] those churches
[1:09:02] so what i felt like i messed up and i
[1:09:04] should have just disagreed and said
[1:09:06] rod i'm sure not everybody in the
[1:09:09] message
[1:09:10] doesn't have love so my answer kind of
[1:09:12] started out wrong but then i corrected
[1:09:14] it later on so just so you know
[1:09:16] i believe the churches they left have
[1:09:18] people that have divine love in them
[1:09:21] now i don't know how many right
[1:09:25] like you can go to churches and you can
[1:09:27] feel where they got love or not
[1:09:31] so it sounds like it but if you keep
[1:09:33] listening the next few sentences i say
[1:09:35] brother i hope and i believe some people
[1:09:38] in those churches have divine love
[1:09:41] so i was going to bed last night and
[1:09:43] that enemy was kind of condemning me i'm
[1:09:44] like
[1:09:45] jesus you know my heart i believe people
[1:09:47] have divine love in those churches
[1:09:49] so if you hear something wrong please
[1:09:50] let me know i'd like to i'd like to
[1:09:51] correct it
[1:09:55] i thank the lord okay five minutes let
[1:09:57] me finish up here we'll finish up with
[1:09:59] knowledge and maybe faith so uh i don't
[1:10:02] know who shared it with me but whoever
[1:10:03] shared first corinthians 6 12 with me
[1:10:05] uh it delivered
[1:10:08] it literally delivered me from chewing
[1:10:10] tobacco that scripture
[1:10:12] literally delivered me it was the
[1:10:14] knowledge i didn't even know but amen i
[1:10:16] didn't even know i could be free from
[1:10:17] that i didn't even know
[1:10:19] but once i knew i hung it up on my wall
[1:10:21] and i kept coping it and pretty soon it
[1:10:23] was gone praise god
[1:10:25] the knowledge of it opened it up to me
[1:10:27] praise god
[1:10:29] it's just like with the long hair thing
[1:10:30] as soon as i knew
[1:10:32] as soon as craig showed me men have to
[1:10:35] have short hair i went and cut it
[1:10:36] that day that day i didn't wait for
[1:10:39] a week that day he's like oh i don't
[1:10:43] want there to be any question
[1:10:45] if i'm uh masculine hair feminine hair i
[1:10:48] want to have masculine hair
[1:10:50] i think god's not falling out yet too my
[1:10:52] dad and grandpa my dad's got
[1:10:54] you don't have any hair so i'm thankful
[1:10:56] huh keep it as long as i got it they say
[1:10:58] it's what keeps you warmer
[1:11:00] but see that's just that knowledge i
[1:11:01] didn't even know but once we knew church
[1:11:03] right once we know once i knew that
[1:11:06] water baptism let me go down to the
[1:11:08] water praise god
[1:11:09] because it's knowledge it's a key to
[1:11:11] open up that area
[1:11:13] of victory that we can get
[1:11:16] and this is the one from brother it was
[1:11:18] brian hawkins uh my wife gave me a word
[1:11:20] of knowledge for him he was doubting
[1:11:22] somebody in this church i don't know who
[1:11:23] was attacking him
[1:11:24] oh you can't be a deacon and a preacher
[1:11:27] and i was talking to him on the phone
[1:11:28] and
[1:11:29] i said i'll pray for you i hung up and
[1:11:30] my wife said jesse phillip was both a
[1:11:32] deacon the preacher we looked in the
[1:11:33] scripture
[1:11:34] i called him up told him about it he
[1:11:36] started crying rejoicing and god gave
[1:11:38] him the victory
[1:11:39] now i don't know if brian would call
[1:11:40] that a gift of knowledge but i would
[1:11:42] call that a gift of knowledge
[1:11:43] i mean i read that in the scripture bang
[1:11:45] but i forgot about it
[1:11:47] but look at that my wife right there she
[1:11:48] could be a universal you know i thought
[1:11:50] praise the lord
[1:11:51] that that opened up a door where he's
[1:11:53] not under condemnation anymore
[1:11:55] he's in the room of the forgiven praise
[1:11:57] god right
[1:11:58] he's in the room of the victorious amen
[1:12:00] instead of living in condemnation
[1:12:02] you can live in that room if you want
[1:12:03] but god is jesus is the door out praise
[1:12:06] god amen
[1:12:07] he's the door out and you can lif you
[1:12:10] can move out
[1:12:13] so that's the beauty of just someone
[1:12:14] with a gift of knowledge to be able to
[1:12:16] give you that word
[1:12:17] and that word can just set you free it's
[1:12:21] a door
[1:12:21] it opens i'm sorry it's a key rather
[1:12:23] sorry it's a key to open
[1:12:25] the door and christ is the door so let's
[1:12:28] end with faith
[1:12:29] uh this is faith is a gift of a
[1:12:32] it's a gift of assurance not insurance
[1:12:36] assurance and it's an inner substance of
[1:12:38] god's desire and power to move
[1:12:40] obstacles problems sicknesses
[1:12:43] adversaries
[1:12:44] and they're figuratively described by
[1:12:47] mountains
[1:12:48] right as mountains uh and it's speaking
[1:12:51] god's word
[1:12:53] whether it's through prayer or whether
[1:12:54] it's speaking directly to the problem
[1:12:56] jesus teaches faith or a revelation of
[1:12:58] god's will about a specific work
[1:13:00] makes anything possible praise god
[1:13:04] jesus said that matthew 17 20 with faith
[1:13:07] god all things are possible praise god
[1:13:11] so examples the roman centurion jesus
[1:13:13] even said you've got great faith
[1:13:16] requesting that jesus speak the word
[1:13:18] only for a servant's healing
[1:13:20] which happened that same hour amen
[1:13:24] paul and a crippled man at lystra both
[1:13:27] had faith for healing
[1:13:29] uh paul loudly command the man to walk
[1:13:32] for the first time in acts 14 7-10
[1:13:36] praise god hallelujah
[1:13:41] jose pronounced that barren couple would
[1:13:43] have a baby
[1:13:45] and one year later he was born on my
[1:13:46] birthday
[1:13:49] one morning i spoke to that mountain of
[1:13:51] my co-workers
[1:13:52] baroness and less than a year later they
[1:13:55] embraced their baby girl and i saw her
[1:13:56] at
[1:13:58] the smoothie shop last year and she just
[1:13:59] had twins
[1:14:02] so she had a baby girl and twins and and
[1:14:04] i i forgot to ask her about this but she
[1:14:05] had another dream about me
[1:14:07] and more children before the twins were
[1:14:09] born and i forgot to ask her about that
[1:14:11] so i actually prayed for her to have
[1:14:12] more children and she had more children
[1:14:14] but i don't have the details on that
[1:14:16] part
[1:14:17] her name she's a nice woman there very
[1:14:20] we had
[1:14:20] bible studies in her home that was a
[1:14:22] really good testimony um
[1:14:24] just spoke to that mountain of
[1:14:25] barrenness um
[1:14:32] and i and i i said it was faith when i
[1:14:34] commanded the critical spirit to leave
[1:14:35] our church and eleven days later it did
[1:14:37] i've shared that many times i was again
[1:14:39] through brother brian that's where
[1:14:40] brother brown was used by god
[1:14:42] uh to speak to that couple and tell them
[1:14:43] do what you want to do which one to do
[1:14:45] and they wanted to leave so god let him
[1:14:47] leave um
[1:14:51] brother cam's testimony he was talking
[1:14:54] to a brother who's gonna go hunting the
[1:14:56] next day i think i told you this
[1:14:57] uh and the anointing came on brother cam
[1:15:00] it was after church on a sunday night
[1:15:01] they were just talking he's like i'm
[1:15:02] i was on a friday night prayer meeting
[1:15:05] uh brother jonah and
[1:15:07] they're just talking about the buck and
[1:15:08] cam kim got the faith on him he said
[1:15:10] he said speak it right now whenever you
[1:15:13] speak now you'll have it tomorrow
[1:15:15] and jonah said i'm going to get a six
[1:15:17] point buck tomorrow
[1:15:19] and he went and hunted about i think 10
[1:15:21] o'clock cam said he got a call
[1:15:23] and joan he said he said how's your
[1:15:25] six-point buck
[1:15:26] he said it's great i got it a few
[1:15:29] minutes ago
[1:15:30] so just a good example speaking the word
[1:15:32] praise god right
[1:15:34] speaking the word by faith so see search
[1:15:36] that's a gift i've seen it at least
[1:15:37] twice in my life you know speaking the
[1:15:39] word of god oh then with your dad too
[1:15:41] sisterhood
[1:15:42] uh brother bang brother bang you may
[1:15:44] have a gift of healing too buddy
[1:15:45] because you had faith to take that
[1:15:48] prayer cloth
[1:15:49] you had faith to do that so i don't know
[1:15:51] if you ever prayed for your children i
[1:15:52] know johnny's
[1:15:53] gave some great testimonies about that i
[1:15:55] know numerous mothers have prayed for
[1:15:57] their children right and god's healed
[1:15:58] them
[1:15:59] give to faith or maybe it's divine
[1:16:01] healing we'll get to that next time
[1:16:03] sometimes with divine healing and faith
[1:16:05] it's kind of hard
[1:16:06] because faith can lead to divine healing
[1:16:08] right divine healing is just going to be
[1:16:10] healing in time so
[1:16:13] things to watch and so this is something
[1:16:16] church i need to be devoted more to
[1:16:17] prayer god
[1:16:19] help me to be yielded so i can speak
[1:16:20] your word right for other people and i
[1:16:23] don't take it lightly church
[1:16:24] right i don't speak to every mountain
[1:16:27] you know
[1:16:27] sister wendy stubs or toe i don't speak
[1:16:29] to the mountain of stubborn or you know
[1:16:31] that stubbed toes gotta leave you know i
[1:16:32] would you know and she wouldn't do that
[1:16:34] for me right you know
[1:16:35] we got we got to be led by the holy
[1:16:36] spirit right
[1:16:39] but we're always always cautious of that
[1:16:42] now let me share this as we stand let's
[1:16:43] stand here for a moment
[1:16:45] i don't know if you remember amen on
[1:16:47] wednesday night we were fasting for my
[1:16:49] parents and
