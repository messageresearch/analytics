Description:
In Part 2, we see 20 more proofs proving the tapes of prophet William Branham have human mistakes, yet he's a true prophet. Again, these proofs show the fallacy of Branham Tabernacle to exalt every word on Brother Branham's tapes to "Thus saith the Lord," which is utter foolishness. 

Part 3 will cover the remaining 26 proofs, for a grand total of 68 proofs we have compiled to date.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] other day i got something mixed up i have to hear it yes i called it right there and it's on the tape if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the bible you see greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to continue part two on the subject of 60 plus proofs the tapes of brother branham have mistakes yet he was a true prophet but first i want to thank everybody for the positive feedback on part one truly it is the desire of the bride of jesus christ to rightly divide the word of truth and that's what this two or three part series aims to do and we can do it by the grace of jesus christ and by the gift of the holy ghost in our lives because jesus promised in john chapter 16 verse 13 that the holy ghost would guide us into all truth picking up in 1961 number 22 in january 1961 brother branham said jesus is not on his heavenly throne now quote he isn't on his throne now no sir where's the throne at now in the heart in the heart of who the members of the seven church ages end quote then in awakening jesus 1963 brother ram said quote now we know that his body will not return to the earth until he comes for the church because it must remain there for a sacrifice is that right it must be on the altar he sets on the throne of god tonight end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth in one quote brother braham said jesus is not on the heavenly throne in the other quote brother ram said jesus is on the throne and can't leave the throne according to the scripture the truth is jesus christ is on the throne yes in one way the altar of god is in the heart of man in the soul of man and the holy spirit is a seal and abides in the soul of man but there's no scripture that ever says jesus christ leaves the heavenly throne the scripture says he must remain there until all enemies are under his feet next at number 23 in 1961 brother ram said trinitarians are saved quote i believe that many thousands of trinitarian people who believe in three gods is saved because they don't know any difference end quote then in 1965 brother graham said quote you put him a third person second person or any other person besides god you're lost end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth are trinitarians saved or lost according to the bible anyone who repents and calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved so a trinitarian who repents of his sins and calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved remember there's two kinds of christians there's wise virgins and foolish virgins the wise virgins know jesus christ is god there's only one person in the godhead but foolish virgins who can be saved according to the scriptures may believe god is three persons but yet they can still be saved number in march of 1961 brother ram said quote jesse had lost some mules had gone away end quote but first samuel 9 verse 3 said it was kish saul's father that had lost the asses so what is the word of truth the word of truth is the scripture's right it was saul's father kish who lost the mules and not jesse david's father number 25 in april of 61 brother ram said quote but jonah never got out of the will of god how can a prophet get out of the will of god end quote but earlier in 1955 brother branham was speaking to moses and said quote now hurting the sheep just a shepherder a man out got out of the will of god and murdered a man and back over there now as a shepherder end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth can a prophet get out of the will of god or not well the truth is yes prophets can get out of the will of god in a simple example is brother branham when he failed the brown bear vision it was god's will for him to shoot the brown bear as he said even giving us a thus saith the lord that it will be but then god did his part of the vision but brother branham did not do his part of the vision and so brother ram did not shoot the brown bear as he told us but yet brother ran was still a prophet because the brown bear vision was a conditional promise as one of my recent youtube videos spoke of and another example for those who needed an exact quote would be from the africa trip report 1953 brother bran was speaking of his trip to south africa and how the brothers got him out of the perfect will of god he said quote but brother i've had more trouble of preachers getting me out of the will of god than anything i've ever seen in my life end quote so if prophets cannot get out of the will of god then brother branham wasn't a prophet but of course we know brother branham was a genuine prophet so we can plainly see brother brahm grew in his revelation on the subject of being out of the will of god number 26 in may of 1961 brother brahm said we were commissioned to baptize using father son and holy ghost quote no wonder we are commissioned to baptize using father son and holy ghost end quote now a month later in june of 1961 brother ram said quote repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and today they adopted the name of father son and holy ghost to be baptized in there's no scripture for that end quote so which one is the rightly divided word of truth well according to acts chapter 2 verse 38 we know the correct water baptism is in the name of the lord jesus christ so again this shows how brother bram grew in revelation and understanding even in water baptism just as it did in the godhead as we saw in part one when brother branham thanked the lord for the third person of the trinity and said how he loved the third person of the trinity that dwelt in his heart but then later brother branham got the revelation that god was only one person number 27 in august 1961 brother graham said quote from the 6th to the 19th chapter is all jewish end quote so here brother brahm says revelation chapter 6 through 19 is all jewish but what is the rightly divided word of truth recently i made a video about this and showed how the gentiles are seen in numerous chapters such as revelation chapter 6 revelation 7 the rapture is in the seventh seal in revelation chapter eight brother ram's own ministry is in revelation chapter 10 and of course the bride is seen in revelation 13 verse 16 as brother bran told us the holy spirit told him to pick up his pen and write revelation 13 verse 16 is the beast system trying to force the bride from preaching the word of god so the truth is we do see the bride in certain chapters between revelation 6 and 19. and also recall that brother ram told us the revelation that god gave him on the four beasts was thus saith the lord and those four beasts represented anointings of the holy ghost that would anoint the gentile bride during the seven church ages and of course the first four seals dealt with the gentile church ages number 28 in august 1961 brother brahm said christ was rejected by the jews in 33 a.d quote from the time god made the promise to abraham genesis chapter 12 verse 3 to the time of christ being rejected in a.d 33 by the jews end quote brother branham also taught this earlier in 1958 in the baptism of the holy spirit quote and we find out hear what the bible says about about whether when the lamb was slain see if it was slayed in a.d 33 end quote but later in questions and answers on the seals 1963 brother brahm said christ was slain in 30 a.d quote now we know that jesus was slain about 80 30. is that right about it was about the middle of the year i guess a.d 30 end quote so which one is the truth was jesus slain in 33 or 30 a.d i believe the rightly divided word of truth is 30 a.d and i believe you come to this conclusion based upon a correct understanding of daniel's 70 weeks moving on to 1962 in february brother branham said the jawbone samson used was an old jawbone quote did you ever think how samson with that old jawbone of the mule end quote but the scripture says in judges 15 verse 15 and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth of course the truth is the scripture it was a new jawbone not an old one i remember friends from part one brother branham said he made these kind of mistakes all the time he would misquote a scripture he would forget something these are all human mistakes brother and made yet he was a genuine prophet of god when brother graham spoke thus saith the lord those statements never failed that was brother ram's divine side or divine prophetic gift but there was also a human side as brother ram told us and the human side was fallible number 30 was from march 1960 brother ram said the human spirit was the deepest part of man's being in the greatest battle ever fought he said quote inside of that body is a soul but the spirit is only has one sense end quote but later in the god of this evil age 1965 brother ram said quote the inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses but the inside of that spirit is a soul and is controlled by one thing your free will end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth the truth is the latter quote the god of this evil age the soul is the deepest part of man's being that's because jesus christ said i come to bring rest unto your souls proving in the old testament before jesus christ came they could never have the baptism of the holy ghost in the soul there was no soul rest but then john chapter 7 said the saints could receive the baptism of the holy ghost after jesus christ was resurrected and his body glorified number 31 brother brahm said i'm no prophet but then later he said he was a prophet in 1962 in the signs of his coming brother ram said quote brother branham people call call you a prophet i said i'm no prophet end quote but then the token 1964 brother ram said quote now do you believe me to be his prophet i'll say it anyhow believe and you'll be made well end quote so which is the truth is brother branham not a prophet or is brother adam a prophet i think most of us watching this would say brother branham was a prophet and it seems like from other quotes to brother branham he did not like to refer to himself as a prophet because he felt the people might think he was exalting himself but of course under the strong anointing of the holy ghost when his gift was operating he would call himself a prophet number 32 in april 62 the signs of his coming brother brahm said quote some of the pentecostal people today don't even count martin luther in them because they say he didn't have the holy ghost he did he might not have had it in the depths that we get it in now but it wasn't for that time end quote another time in 1962 and then another quote in 1961 both say martin luther did not have the baptism of the holy ghost like we have it today but different than that in the sardisian church age chapter 7 brother ram said quote now martin luther himself was a sensitive spirit-filled christian end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth in my humble opinion i do believe martin luther had the baptism of the holy ghost and the reason is because the baptism of the holy ghost does not change in the new testament doctrine so the new testament never teaches that the baptism of the holy ghost experience would change in the middle of the church ages i do believe revelation was lost but i do not believe that the holy ghost could not be given in the soul during the dark ages or the middle part of the church ages and also to back that up if martin luther was one of the seven stars in the hand of jesus he would have had the same brightness in other words he would have had a very similar experience a spiritual experience as all the other stars which included brother branham and saint paul number 33 was from april 1962 the restoration of the bride tree brother bam said quote the word of the lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word come to them but jesus was the word end quote a month later brother bran would say different he'd say quote and he is the word of god because he's carrying the word of the lord that is a true prophet of the lord end quote so in restoration the bride tree brother ram said the prophet isn't the word but then a month later he said a prophet is the word so what is the rightly divided word of truth if you take the context of the first quote brother is comparing jesus christ as a prophet to all the other prophets and brother branham is saying that jesus christ was fully the word of god he was the word made flesh but all the other prophets were human prophets who sinned jesus christ never sinned because he had a word nature all the other human prophets had a sin nature so when you looked at the nature of jesus and the prophets jesus was the only one who was a word prophet he had the full nature of the word of god all the other prophets had a sin nature but yet god's spirit still anointed them and of course this is the quote branham tabernacle doesn't like they'll never quote this where brother ram said the prophets wasn't the word because then that would make them question whether or not every word on brother rams tapes was thus saith the lord or not well we know not every word on tape is thus saith the lord because we're honest we're humble by the grace of god and we believe these quotes like this quote from the restoration the bride tree so can the human prophets that are sinners say by grace can they be the word of god well in one sense yes and one sense no we'll start with the no a human prophet say by grace can never be fully the word of god while living on this earth in other words moses john the baptist jeremiah ezekiel were never equal to jesus christ they did not have the full word nature but did those prophets represent the word of god do they have a commission to preach the word of god the answer to that is yes so in one way a prophet who is a sinner saved by grace represents the word of god just as the new testament calls us ambassadors for christ really every holy ghostville christian is an ambassador for christ according to new testament doctrine number 34 is from july 62. brother branham apologized for an expression he made he said quote oh my sakes you'd have blowed up like a frog eating shot and you'd you wouldn't of why my you would have not to excuse that experience expression i shouldn't have said that forgive me end quote now previous to this in 1958 brother ram said quote god doesn't have to apologize to nobody for nothing end quote now these two quotes don't seem to contradict each other but if you follow branham tabernacle and their false doctrines these quotes do contradict each other because branham tabernacle says every word on the tape is thus saith the lord if brother branham apologized on the tapes that could not be thus saith the lord because god doesn't have to apologize to nobody for nothing so again brother rahm's own honest humble christian character admits he's not equal to god not everywhere on the tape as thus saith the lord and god alone is the only one who does not have to repent or apologize number 35 is from september 62 brother ram said colombo was the third church age messenger and martin was the fourth so brother ram switched them quote the third church age which was pergamos was saint columba which was a great saint of god during the time of the dark age and the persecution the fourth age and the fourth count saint martin of tours the great saint coming from france end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth is the church age book right when columba is the fourth age messenger is this quote from countdown thus saith the lord or is the church age book thus saith the lord the truth is brother iran made a mistake in the countdown and he just switched columba and martin columbus should be the fourth messenger and martin should be the third messenger it's incredibly sad friends that the branham tabernacle would say every word is thus saith the lord how can colomba be both the fourth and third church age messenger how can martin be both the third and fourth church age messenger that's a complete contradiction you'd have to be insane to believe that so again that's why we'll pray for these precious souls at the end of the video number 36 is closely related in october of 62 brother ram said columbus come in thirteera quote then entire tira come columba end quote i believe this quote but then the dates brother ram gave for columbus life and the star of the authoritarian church age do not allow colomba to live within his own church age so what is the rightly divided word of truth did columbus come in his church age or not i believe the answer is yes he did come in his church age and that brother ram just made a mistake on the dates of the authority and church age and of course i have a youtube video about this i think i put it out earlier this year or late last year so you can find that and watch that if you're interested in that subject number 37 is from december 62. brother ram said quote but there are seven other seals that's on the back side of the book it's outside the bible but the backside had seven seals on the back of it that wasn't written in the book it's not even written in the book end quote now this is a beautiful quote from the spiritual food in due season brother branham admits that there cannot be seals on the backside of a book because you cannot add or take away from the revealed word of god the genesis to revelation revelation that god has given us as it's been compiled in the holy bible so in 1965 spiritual food and due season quote i always thought it was sealed on the back of the book and it'd be something wasn't wrote in the book but it turned out that it was made known that he cannot do that it isn't something that's written in the book it's something that's been hid in the book for whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it so it's a mystery that's been in the book in these seven church ages end quote again i love this quote and this subject i may make a separate video on this topic but it shows again how brother brandon was human in 1962 he thought there were seven additional seals on the backside of the book but then two years later his thoughts changed he said i always thought there was seals in the back but then he come to find out there can be no further revelation outside of the holy bible moving into 1963 number 38 in march brother graham said martin luther was not a prophet one day after saying all the messengers were prophets in the breach brother ram said quote out of there was seven prophets that went fourth seven seers eyes so that last one must be a seer end quote and then the next night in the first seal quote why did martin luther say that because he was a reformer not a prophet end quote now what's interesting also is in the restoration the bride tree 1962 brother ram said martin luther was one of the four great prophets quote martin luther justification what was the second john wesley by sanctification what was the third pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the holy ghost what was the fourth the word the word there were four great prophets end quote so what is the rightly divided word of truth now on this subject friends i'm not sure which one it is but it's undeniable brother branham said two complete opposite things he said martin luther was not a prophet but he also said martin luther was a great prophet it's interesting to know also that in the church age book brother branham said martin luther had all nine gifts of the spirit one of which would be prophecy so again i'm not quite sure if martin luther was a prophet or not i haven't studied deep enough into his own personal writings to know whether or not he spoke with thus saith the lord and foretold future events but again here we have brother random speaking two completely contrary statements and both cannot be thus saith the lord and in fact neither one is spoken with thus saith the lord so that's why up to this point i haven't studied it i would consider this a minor subject and not a major subject such as salvation the baptism of the holy ghost the mark of the beast and other very important subjects number 39 brother ram said in the fourth seal that the eagle age was promised in malachi chapter 1 verse 4. quote now we find out that the eagle age was promised in revelation 10 verse 7 and in and in malachi 1 verse 4 that it would be in the last days see that's right end quote friends if you read malachi 1 verse 4 it says nothing about an eagle age it's actually thus saith the lord of hosts speaking of edom and the lord's indignation against them forever so friends this cannot be thus saith the lord that the eagle age is spoken of in malachi 1 verse 4. it seems here brother branham had a slip of the tongue and met malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. but again this proves not every word on tape is thus saith the lord number 40 is again from the fourth seal brother braham said there were only 700 that had not bowed the knee to baal in the days of elijah quote he had 700 that never bowed down to them creeds that they had end quote now of course almost everyone knows who's listened to the seven seals that brother rand later corrected this he said he knew it was seven thousand he just said seven hundred and he apologized for that he said i do these kind of mistakes all the time and of course the bible tells us as well there were seven thousand god himself told us seven thousand had not bowed the knee so again not every word on tape is thus saith the lord number 41 brother ram said quote all the messengers come at the end of the age end quote friends this statement by brother branham cannot be thus saith the lord first according to brother ramsey's dates columba didn't even live within his age so that would mean no human messenger came at the end of the third tier in church age but of course i believe columbus did live within the thirty or church age and he came at the beginning of the age i believe history proves and the bible proves that all the messengers came at the beginning or towards the beginning of their ages second it's playing paul iranius martin luther wesley and brother branham came at the beginning of their ages now some try to say that brother branham meant the messengers came at the end of the previous age well if they believe that they're not saying what the tapes say because the tapes say all the messengers come at the end of the age and of course this wouldn't make sense for brother branham brother ram's message started going worldwide around 1946 and 47 and the laodicean church age had already started in 1906 so brother ramsey's message does not start at the end of the philadelphian church age because it already had ended by 1906. number 42 brother brown apologized for making himself something rather than god in questions and answers on the seals quote i could take that person now by the help of god and tie them in such a knot it make their head swim look i don't care what now i don't mean now that don't sound right forgive me i didn't mean that lord i didn't know i didn't now i i felt him check me on that see so i didn't mean to say it that way i'm i'm sorry i just don't even want to be myself or nothing it's him he didn't like that see that was putting me in there see end quote so here brother branham exalts himself a little bit and the holy spirit checks him and makes him humble himself and realize brother ram could not make a man's head swim again it's brother random being very humble but notice brother am apologized but then in 1958 the handwriting on the wall brother branham said quote god doesn't have to apologize to nobody or nothing end quote so again not every word on the tapes are thus saith the lord because brother adam said god doesn't have to apologize but then brother branham apologized and said he was making himself something also this quote is helpful to anyone who would say well i'm taking brother rams statements during the seven seals because they were more inspired of course i believe brother ram sermons were very inspired in the seventh seal but it doesn't mean every word was thus saith the lord during the seven seals sermons because this is just another example to go along with the 7 000 or 700 quote that we already heard friends we've come to the end of part two we've now gone through 42 proofs that not every word on tape was thus saith the lord lord willing we'll have one more part in part three we'll go through the remaining 26 proofs that not every word on tape was thus saith the lord for a total of 68. again i'll probably put this audio on a separate podcast because some people prefer the podcast format and thank you for all your prayers and all your support as we seek to rightly divide the word of truth by the spirit of truth the holy ghost thank you friends for all your support and positive feedback god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
