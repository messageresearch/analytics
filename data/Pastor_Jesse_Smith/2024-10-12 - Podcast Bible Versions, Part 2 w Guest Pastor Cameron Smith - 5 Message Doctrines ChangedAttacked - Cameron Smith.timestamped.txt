[0:02] the Antichrist refuses the true
[0:07] bride Doctrine and therefore he takes
[0:10] his own bride now and builds her up
[0:13] under a Creed of his
[0:16] own and a genuine Faith Of God will
[0:20] believe in God and God is the word it'll
[0:23] never add nothing to
[0:25] [Music]
[0:26] it greetings friends in the matchless
[0:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:32] purpose of this video is to record a
[0:34] part two of our podcast series on Bible
[0:38] versions and here in part two we're
[0:40] going to discuss five message doctrines
[0:43] that are attacked and changed by other
[0:46] Bible versions other than the King James
[0:49] version specifically the Amplified and
[0:52] NIV
[0:53] versions hi friends I'm Jesse Smith
[0:56] pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here
[0:58] in akan Ohio USA and I defend the
[1:00] original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02] that he revealed to St Paul then had to
[1:04] restore through Martin Luther John
[1:06] Wesley and the late Prophet William
[1:08] brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and
[1:11] also defend brother Ram's Godly
[1:13] Christian character I want to briefly
[1:15] review part one of our podcast series on
[1:17] Bible versions We Looked at brother
[1:19] Cam's testimony and his awareness of how
[1:21] the NIV deleted verses out of the King
[1:24] James Bible brother cam showed how
[1:26] Satan's been twisting scripture from the
[1:29] Garden of Eden and then also in Jeremiah
[1:31] 8:8 Satan was twisting or changing
[1:34] scripture in the days of Jeremiah and we
[1:37] know the Pharisees were adding
[1:39] traditions of men in Matthew chapter 15
[1:42] then of course revelation 22 said people
[1:44] would take away and add to the word of
[1:47] God and awful repercussions would be
[1:49] given to them and a genuine Faith Of God
[1:52] will believe in God and God is the word
[1:56] it'll never add nothing to it the Bible
[1:59] tells us if we add one word or take one
[2:01] word away our part will be taken from
[2:03] The Book of Life Revelations 22:18 the
[2:06] last closing chapter in The First
[2:08] beginning the first book of the Bible
[2:10] God told them not to break one word of
[2:12] that every word must be kept they must
[2:14] live by that word Jesus in the middle of
[2:17] the book come along and said that in his
[2:19] age and said man shall not live by bread
[2:21] alone but by every word that in it comes
[2:24] out of the mouth of God and in the
[2:26] closing age of Revelations for told to
[2:28] us that whosoever shall take one word
[2:31] out of the book or add one word to it
[2:33] his part will be taken from the book of
[2:35] life we saw the trend that some message
[2:38] churches and of course many other
[2:39] churches are no longer using the King
[2:42] James version only a sad Trend then we
[2:45] saw there's only two families of
[2:47] manuscripts that all bibles are
[2:49] translated from of course the King James
[2:51] used the Texas receptus from the bisane
[2:54] family all other Bible translations use
[2:56] the false westcot and Hort texts the
[2:59] West Scott and Hort manuscripts then we
[3:02] saw there's over 30,000 changes in the
[3:04] West Scott and Hort manuscripts but
[3:07] thankfully God promised to preserve his
[3:09] pure words in Psalm 12: 6 and 7 then
[3:12] brother cam brought up a great Point how
[3:14] one of the goals of the Counter
[3:16] Reformation is to change the Bible which
[3:19] they're doing but true believers will
[3:21] not change the truth of God's word
[3:23] they'll use the true translation the
[3:25] King James version then we finished by
[3:27] showing all recent revivals use the King
[3:30] James version of the Bible and that's
[3:33] the version God's Prophet brother
[3:34] brandom used for his restoration
[3:36] Ministry to finish the mystery of God
[3:38] according to Revelation 10:7 so here in
[3:40] part two of the podcast I believe you'll
[3:42] be blessed by the grace of God the focus
[3:44] of part two will be to show that the
[3:46] false Bible versions have attacked and
[3:49] changed at least five message doctrines
[3:52] that's what we're going to cover in this
[3:53] podcast hopefully in the next recording
[3:55] we'll do more examples but brother cam
[3:58] has studied and found that five message
[4:00] doctrines are being attacked the first
[4:02] is we must live by every word of God
[4:04] according to Matthew
[4:06] 4:4 second is they're attacking
[4:08] Revelation
[4:10] 10:7 Third they're attacking or changing
[4:12] the serpent seed fourth they're
[4:15] attacking the believer's equality with
[4:17] God how the Holy Ghost is in the soul of
[4:19] the believer and Fifth and finally
[4:21] they're attacking men and women's hair
[4:23] links from 1 Corinthians 11
[4:26] 1-16 now I want to play a striking
[4:29] statement brother Cam said in part one
[4:31] brother Cam said we can lay two Bible
[4:33] versions side by side and see if the new
[4:36] versions affect what a god-sent seventh
[4:40] angel William brandham gave us it was a
[4:43] striking beautiful statement the Holy
[4:44] Spirit Led brother cam to say why would
[4:46] we want to take a new Bible version that
[4:49] changes what the seventh Church age
[4:51] messenger gave us from the original word
[4:54] of God the truth is we wouldn't want to
[4:57] use a Bible version that changes the
[4:59] seven Church age messenger gave to us by
[5:02] the grace of God of course what he gave
[5:04] to us brother Ram gave to us was already
[5:06] in the scripture why would messageer
[5:08] Believers today want to use a Bible that
[5:10] denies what their messenger taught so
[5:13] let's listen to that quote from Brother
[5:14] cam but really what we would need to do
[5:17] at some point in time is is to actually
[5:19] look at the evidence especially from a
[5:21] message perspective which is what we're
[5:23] looking at and see if this affects what
[5:27] a godsent seventh Angel William brandham
[5:31] gave us now before getting into the
[5:33] podcast I want to make two statements
[5:35] first I want to apologize for certain
[5:38] portions of the podcast that don't have
[5:40] very good sound quality that's my fault
[5:43] I think I forgot to plug in the external
[5:45] microphone when brother Cam and I
[5:47] recorded this second part so please
[5:49] pardon that if you have any questions on
[5:51] what brother cam or myself said please
[5:53] reach out and let me know I tried to
[5:55] edit it so everything that was said
[5:57] could be understood this the second
[5:59] statement is I want to show some Bible
[6:01] verses about the equality with God you
[6:04] know there are some people that would
[6:06] get so upset if you said there was
[6:07] inequality with God between God and the
[6:10] Believers it's so misunderstood
[6:13] especially by many people outside the
[6:15] message one side completely rejects any
[6:18] teaching that brings an equality between
[6:21] God and man and of course this group
[6:23] would deny the truth in 1 John 3:9 which
[6:27] says the seed of God in The Believer
[6:29] makes it so The Believer cannot sin and
[6:32] so we see when a Believer receives the
[6:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost in his or her
[6:37] soul they have a small measure of
[6:40] equality with God they have a portion or
[6:43] a measure of equality with God because
[6:45] God's spirit is inside him or her that
[6:48] measure of the holy spirit is part of
[6:50] God's Own eternal spirit it's a portion
[6:53] of God's Own Spirit or it's a measure as
[6:56] the Bible says in Romans 12:3 we have a
[6:59] Measure of Faith then Ephesians 4:13
[7:02] says we have a measure of the fullness
[7:05] of the stature of Christ inside of us
[7:08] and this measure is the same quality of
[7:11] God's Own spirit because it is God's
[7:13] spirit and Romans 8:11 says if the
[7:15] spirit of God dwells in you it will
[7:17] Quicken your mortal body just as it
[7:19] quickened Jesus's mortal body so
[7:21] Believers like brother Cam and myself
[7:23] and others who Faithfully preach the
[7:26] message that God gave to brother
[7:27] brandham we're not exalting ourselves
[7:29] saying we're equal with God what we're
[7:31] saying is we have a measure of God's Own
[7:34] spirit in us and that measure of God's
[7:36] spirit is equal in quality as God's
[7:40] spirit but of course Jesus had the
[7:43] fullness of the Holy Ghost a larger
[7:45] quantity of the Holy Ghost the fullness
[7:48] of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily as
[7:50] Colossians 1:9 says the Bible said the
[7:53] fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ
[7:55] Colossians 2:9 as well Jesus had the
[7:59] holy ghost without measure as John 3:34
[8:02] says so message Believers are not saying
[8:05] we have the same amount of holy ghost
[8:07] that Jesus had we're not saying that
[8:09] we're just saying we have a small
[8:10] measure or portion of the Holy Ghost but
[8:14] as 1 John 39 said that same quality of
[8:17] the holy spirit makes us so we cannot
[8:20] sin that spirit of God in us cannot sin
[8:23] so there's two camps around this thought
[8:26] on the equality of God the first Camp
[8:27] rejects any teaching on equality with
[8:30] God and the other Camp overemphasizes it
[8:34] such as in the NRA movement the Kenneth
[8:36] Copeland movement the Bill Johnson
[8:38] movement the Joyce Meyer movement the
[8:41] Prosperity Gospel Movement that names it
[8:43] and claims it they have what they call
[8:45] the little Gods teaching and of course
[8:47] they overemphasize it connecting it with
[8:49] their false Prosperity Gospel and they
[8:52] falsely believe God wants every believer
[8:55] healthy wealthy and they can speak
[8:57] whatever they want they name it and
[8:58] claim it that's a false gospel brother
[9:01] man plainly taught when a Christian
[9:02] speaks the word of God it's only by the
[9:04] permission of God a real Christian can
[9:07] only speak name and claim what God wants
[9:10] them to name and claim you are believing
[9:12] because of the spoken words and things
[9:14] like that that he said about and all of
[9:16] you here Witnesses squirrels and all
[9:17] these other things that's been done but
[9:19] did you notice that was sovereignly
[9:23] given I never asked him Lord let me do
[9:27] this speak these things in like that do
[9:29] these things there I never asked him
[9:31] that he by his own Divine
[9:34] will came to me and said you go do this
[9:38] see I wasn't asking one thing about it
[9:42] Moses never asked to go down in Egypt
[9:44] but was God that sent him down to Egypt
[9:47] see so if you have any questions on the
[9:49] equality with God teaching please let me
[9:51] know again it's the equality in the soul
[9:53] of the believer not the body and not the
[9:56] human Spirit or mind brother Cam and I
[9:58] hope to do another recording soon by
[9:59] God's grace and we'll go over other
[10:01] numerous Bible doctrines that are
[10:03] attacked or changed or completely taken
[10:05] out of the new Bible translations
[10:09] they're false Bible translations of
[10:10] course a few examples are prayer and
[10:13] fasting to cast out Devils that teaching
[10:16] is taken out of numerous new Bible
[10:18] translations also new Bible translations
[10:21] take out the word fornication as a sin
[10:24] that causes one to not inherit the
[10:25] kingdom of God so in other words they're
[10:27] giving a license for immorality as Jude
[10:30] 1:3 says the Bible said these men were
[10:33] ordained to this condemnation they
[10:35] turned the grace of God into
[10:36] lusciousness or lawlessness they're
[10:38] allowing people to commit fornication
[10:40] and say it's not a sin we don't believe
[10:42] a true message believer would want to
[10:44] use a Bible that denies what their
[10:47] seventh Church age messenger taught and
[10:49] denies what Jesus taught so again these
[10:52] podcasts and videos are made in the love
[10:53] of God to help people stay with the true
[10:56] word of God the King James version Bible
[10:58] with that being said here is part two of
[11:00] Bible
[11:02] [Music]
[11:09] translations God bless you and welcome
[11:12] to the defending the message podcast I'm
[11:14] your host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's
[11:16] podcast we're going to do part two on
[11:18] the Bible versions topic we're again
[11:20] joined by my brother in the natural and
[11:22] spiritual Pastor Cameron Smith from
[11:24] Napoleon Ohio and in this podcast we're
[11:27] going to look at five message doctrines
[11:29] that are changed or attacked by the new
[11:32] Bible translations this was recorded
[11:35] back in July I believe so it took me a
[11:37] while to get this edited and ready for
[11:39] publication but I'm excited to get this
[11:41] out now and we'll jump right into this
[11:44] topic with our precious brother so hope
[11:46] you enjoy part
[11:52] two yes so I think a key point to start
[11:55] right off with is that there are many
[11:58] many many different es uh which not only
[12:01] destroy what we call message Doctrine
[12:03] but also fundamental doctrines from all
[12:07] Protestants of course from our
[12:09] standpoint this right here will uh going
[12:13] through these will will show you not
[12:15] just little things but rather large
[12:18] changes that they made you know what
[12:20] they they always say the proof is in the
[12:22] pudding so you know you can have
[12:23] somebody reason and reason you to a spot
[12:26] okay I'm with that critical text but
[12:28] once you see what the critical text
[12:30] produces that might give you another
[12:33] thought now I would like to start first
[12:37] off uh with Luke 4:4 because of course
[12:40] what we're talking about we're talking
[12:42] about the word of God Luke 4:4 the King
[12:46] James version says and Jesus answered
[12:49] him in saying it is written that man
[12:51] shall not live by bread alone but by
[12:54] every word of God now what we find when
[12:59] we we start looking at the critical text
[13:01] and the new versions is that it will
[13:03] actually take this out NIV it says Jesus
[13:06] answered it is written man shall not
[13:07] live on bread alone period notice what
[13:10] they take out they take out Jesus's own
[13:13] words and they say man shall not live on
[13:15] bread alone but they take out but by
[13:18] every word of God that's what solar
[13:20] script tour is we live by the word it's
[13:22] our only infallibility now we could go
[13:25] through the the ESV the message bible
[13:27] NLT but they basically all say the same
[13:29] same thing but for the sake of of those
[13:31] U message Believers starting to look at
[13:33] the Amplified Bible perhaps having
[13:35] interest in using that the Amplified
[13:37] Bible says and Jesus replied to him it
[13:39] is written man shall not live and be
[13:41] sustained on bread alone brackets a but
[13:45] by every word and expression of God so
[13:50] it actually adds to it so now it doesn't
[13:53] just say live but it says but now we
[13:55] must be sustained by every word and
[14:00] expression of God so what's an
[14:02] expression of God that could mean almost
[14:04] anything that could mean uh a do game
[14:07] you know flew and landed on my window s
[14:09] it means God has his holy ghost for me
[14:11] good enough you know I'm gonna live on
[14:13] that now which I mean I'm I'm not taking
[14:15] down what God can manifest but notice
[14:18] now we're we're adding but you'll find
[14:20] it's going to get a little bit more
[14:21] severe now I started right there because
[14:23] that affects everybody okay of course
[14:25] that's from the Old Testament but one
[14:28] that will go from for us message
[14:29] Believers is Revelations 10:7 which is
[14:32] very critical the King James version
[14:35] says but in the days of the voice of the
[14:38] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[14:39] sound the mystery of God should be
[14:42] finished as Heath declared to his
[14:43] servants the prophets so we see right
[14:47] there a seventh angel but what Angel we
[14:50] see is we see that it is the Angel to
[14:54] the Church of leoda the seventh Church
[14:56] age Angel which is why it says says as
[14:59] he declared to his servants the prophets
[15:01] because he was a prophet but I want you
[15:03] to see this uh look at what the
[15:05] Amplified says it says but when it is
[15:08] time for the trumpet call of the seventh
[15:12] angel when he is about to sound then the
[15:16] mystery of God that is his hidden
[15:19] purpose and plan is finished as he
[15:22] announced the gospel to his servants the
[15:24] prophets so look at what he says here
[15:27] now why is this relevant and why is this
[15:30] really important because if you look in
[15:33] the Bible you'll find in Revelations 8
[15:36] and9 you'll find six trumpet
[15:39] Angels but the seventh trumpet angel is
[15:41] not
[15:43] denoted but if I take a new version for
[15:46] Revelation 10:7 what Angel do I have I
[15:50] have when it's time for the trumpet call
[15:53] of the seventh angel so they are saying
[15:56] that the seventh angel and the King
[15:59] James is actually the seventh trumpet
[16:01] angel to the
[16:02] Jews okay well if we get into the Bible
[16:05] where does it talk about in the King
[16:07] James the seventh angel trumpet angel
[16:09] coming at the end of Revelations
[16:12] 11 which is the two prophets come out
[16:15] that finishes and then the seventh
[16:16] trumpet angel sounds so now what are we
[16:19] going to do with that brother Jesse so
[16:21] you see what I'm saying now watch the
[16:23] NIV Bible it says but in the days when
[16:25] the the seventh angel is about to sound
[16:28] his trumpet and it continues on so one
[16:33] of our main doctrines which shows that
[16:37] we will receive the mystery of God in
[16:39] this hour which ties in with Matthew 17
[16:41] the days uh of the restoration is right
[16:44] here but they the new versions are
[16:46] saying this is no longer the seven
[16:48] Church Angel like he told us it is
[16:51] actually the seventh angel to the Jews
[16:54] very important wow brother I'd never
[16:56] seen that before but you're right yeah
[16:58] if they make that a trumpet angel it's
[17:02] connected to the angel of judgment
[17:04] during the Great Tribulation period and
[17:06] not the seventh Church age messenger
[17:08] huge it's huge so you know as a message
[17:11] believer why would I even want to
[17:12] partake in this you see what I'm saying
[17:15] so uh some very major changes because
[17:18] now now we're having issues with our
[17:20] revelation of Revelations 2 and 3 very
[17:24] important okay let's do another one I'm
[17:26] going to read uh King James Bible uh
[17:28] Genesis 41 and
[17:31] 2 it says and Adam knew as Eve's wife
[17:34] and she conceived and bear Cain and said
[17:36] I have gotten a man from the Lord now
[17:40] watch it says and she again bear his
[17:43] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of
[17:45] the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[17:48] ground all right are you ready for this
[17:52] yes sir the Amplified Bible says now the
[17:55] man Adam knew Eve as his wife and she
[18:00] conceived and gave birth to
[18:03] Cain and she said I have obtained a man
[18:07] parentheses baby boy son with the help
[18:11] of the
[18:12] Lord verse
[18:14] two and brackets later she gave birth to
[18:19] his brother Abel okay now let's read
[18:22] again because they say the same thing
[18:24] because it's it's written with a
[18:25] different text uh NIV it says Adam made
[18:29] love to his wife Eve and she became
[18:31] pregnant and gave birth to Cain uh she
[18:34] said with the help of the Lord I have
[18:36] brought forth a man second verse later
[18:40] she gave birth to his brother Abel so
[18:43] this destroys one of our main tenant
[18:46] doctrines of serpent seed because
[18:50] Genesis 41 and2 in the King James
[18:53] version we can see the absolute and even
[18:56] the commentators talk about that this
[18:58] could be a
[18:59] twins okay uh which is what we believe
[19:03] we believe that the serpent impregnated
[19:05] Eve and then Adam shortly after partook
[19:08] in the same fruit and right there we
[19:12] have two children born from two act but
[19:15] the amplifi NIV say and later she gave
[19:19] birth to his brother Abel so what was
[19:22] that 5 years two years and and the
[19:25] commentators make note of that and they
[19:27] say it was two separate at Birth and
[19:29] this one came later so if you destroy
[19:32] twins at the beginning you destroy the
[19:35] whole doctrine of message Believers and
[19:38] you can do that with the Catholic
[19:40] version
[19:41] Bibles that's right and that's what
[19:42] Satan doesn't like to do he doesn't like
[19:44] to be exposed right so the King James
[19:47] version exposes what he did in the
[19:49] garden his fruit was adultery and It
[19:52] produced uh a separate seed line and so
[19:56] the King James version preserves that
[19:58] truth
[19:59] and that is crazy what versions did you
[20:01] read There Brother what two versions I
[20:03] first read the Amplified and then I read
[20:05] the NIV most of these I'm going to read
[20:07] are from the Amplified then NIV right
[20:10] because those are the ones most used by
[20:12] people right yep and uh you'll see that
[20:14] uh it's very interesting because they're
[20:16] actually very close to each other well
[20:18] why is that because they use a different
[20:20] Greek text right and then the Bible in
[20:23] uh Genesis 3 already says there's two
[20:26] seeds when God said I'll put enity
[20:29] between thee and the woman between thy
[20:31] seed and her seed and then the Bible
[20:33] already says in Genesis 3 that Eve is
[20:36] already a mother of all living so the
[20:40] King James sets up there's already two
[20:42] seeds in Genesis 3 and then King James
[20:46] makes it look like there's twins in
[20:48] Genesis 41 and2 but then the other
[20:50] versions destroy that foundation and
[20:53] even the testimony of Genesis chapter 3
[20:56] right so the whole different idea but
[21:00] that's the point of it that's why it was
[21:02] sent it was sent to deceive you know if
[21:05] I can interject something just for a
[21:07] moment if you think about it why if
[21:11] they're saying that the vaticanus and
[21:14] the cicus are more reliable on their
[21:17] right why are these critical text
[21:21] acceptors why at every opportunity are
[21:24] they trying to make something very close
[21:28] to the King James version you see what
[21:31] I'm saying if they're going to take Mark
[21:32] 16 out why wouldn't you just put a Bible
[21:34] without Mark 16 at the end of it the
[21:36] Great Commission but you see what
[21:37] they're doing they're they're actually
[21:39] trying to deceive saying that their
[21:42] version has it even though it doesn't
[21:44] right deceiving on purpose probably for
[21:47] financial gain but also for the
[21:49] corruption and deception of the One
[21:51] World
[21:52] Church
[21:54] 100% so if if there's a better why in
[21:57] the world don't we all just get pushed
[21:59] right over to it so a very good point a
[22:02] very valid point so let's do this one
[22:06] next this is the equality that you and I
[22:08] have with God us Believers have with God
[22:11] Philippians
[22:13] 2:5 it says uh let this mind be in you
[22:17] uh which was also in Christ Jesus who
[22:21] being in the form of God thought it not
[22:24] robbery to be equal with God so we look
[22:28] at in the New Testament we find that
[22:30] we're the bride of Christ uh the message
[22:32] teaches us that that we are actually the
[22:34] feminine attribute of
[22:37] God uh so the Bible tells us here that
[22:40] let us Think Like Jesus Christ let this
[22:42] mind be in you he thought it not robbery
[22:45] to be equal with God so you and I uh we
[22:47] should be with this mind of Jesus that
[22:50] we think it's not robbery to be equal
[22:52] with God okay now let's hit it Amplified
[22:57] verse five and there's a lot of brackets
[22:59] and parentheses in the in the amplifi
[23:01] because they're trying to amplify
[23:02] everything but uh it says have this same
[23:04] attitude in yourselves which was in
[23:06] Christ Jesus uh brackets look to him as
[23:10] your example in selfless humility verse
[23:13] six uh who although he existed in the
[23:17] form and unchanging essence of God
[23:21] brackets as one with him possessing the
[23:24] fullness of all the Divine attributes
[23:27] the entire nature of deity and of
[23:30] brackets did not regard equality with
[23:34] God a thing to be grasped or assert it
[23:39] as if he did not already possess it or
[23:41] is afraid of losing it okay so that's in
[23:44] the brackets so now they're I want you
[23:46] to see this of course all these
[23:48] amplifications they're just giving you
[23:49] what you're what they want you to
[23:51] believe but notice they said they did
[23:54] not regard equality with God a thing to
[23:55] be grasped or asserted okay which can
[23:57] apply to us
[23:59] so it's completely opposite now if those
[24:01] brackets weren't there it would be just
[24:02] like NIV the NIV says in your
[24:05] relationships with one another have the
[24:07] same mindset as Christ Jesus who being
[24:10] in the very nature of God did not
[24:12] consider equality with God something to
[24:14] be used to his own Advantage it's
[24:18] completely
[24:20] opposite so where the King James tells
[24:24] us that we should begin to start
[24:25] thinking like Christ let Christ mind
[24:28] bring this forth from us that thought it
[24:30] not robbery to be equal with God the
[24:32] other two versions say one that he did
[24:35] not regard equality with God a thing to
[24:37] be grasped or asserted and that's the
[24:39] way way people act you know they they
[24:40] don't believe they can do the same works
[24:41] as Jesus they don't think they can grasp
[24:43] that um It also says in the NIV and
[24:45] they're all different when they when
[24:47] they come against this but uh and bring
[24:49] it a contrary idea but they they also
[24:51] say uh he didn't think it was something
[24:53] to be used as his own Advantage I don't
[24:55] know about you the holy ghost in the day
[24:57] of Pentecost was given for an
[25:00] advantage right exactly right yeah Jesus
[25:03] said it's power to be Witnesses and then
[25:06] Paul said we don't want to let Satan get
[25:08] advantage on us because we know his
[25:09] devices we're not ignorant of his
[25:12] devices right so then we work with uh
[25:15] the equality we see that we have we have
[25:18] issues with the belief of the equality
[25:20] of God that we have now obviously in
[25:22] some of these and if you think about it
[25:24] you know they can change one of them
[25:26] completely opposite way and then you can
[25:28] have you can still have John 14:12 there
[25:30] uh but but if you watch it actually
[25:32] starts putting the scripture against
[25:33] itself well which one do I believe which
[25:36] one do I believe so what does that say
[25:39] you know once again then it just makes
[25:40] confusion and how you going to have
[25:42] faith uh in the aspect of
[25:46] confusion right brother good verse for
[25:48] that with equality with God is uh first
[25:51] John
[25:52] 3:9 for whosever is born of God do not
[25:54] commit sin now here's the same man two
[25:57] chapters earlier said if you say you
[25:59] don't sin you're a
[26:01] liar uh but then he explains it for his
[26:03] seed remaineth in him he cannot sin
[26:07] because he's born of God so when
[26:09] Christians say you know there's this
[26:11] element of equality with God that's what
[26:12] we mean it's God's spirit living in our
[26:15] soul it's the spirit of God that's
[26:17] quickened our soul here John catches the
[26:19] Revelation and says it's the seed of God
[26:22] we have God's Own seed we're God's own
[26:25] children acts 17 says we're his
[26:27] offspring
[26:29] and that's the reality of what we're
[26:30] talking about when it refers to equality
[26:32] of uh with God it's a part of God is
[26:35] inside of us and if it's a part of God
[26:38] it's just as Eternal as God and that
[26:41] goes back to Ephesians 1 where it says
[26:43] we were chosen in Christ before the
[26:46] foundational world and that tells us we
[26:48] were in the thoughts of almighty God and
[26:51] that thought in God's mind has become
[26:54] manifested and then he put his life his
[26:57] equal life in inside of us so the part
[27:00] of us that's equal with God is the soul
[27:02] because the soul has the anointing of
[27:03] the Holy Ghost right amen amen and that
[27:08] puts the nature of God on the inside of
[27:10] us well what does the nature of God do
[27:12] it makes you like
[27:13] God excellent yes that's what Peter said
[27:16] Peter said we're partakers of the divine
[27:18] nature in second Peter chapter 1 so
[27:21] that's the part of us that's equal with
[27:23] God is the soul that's filled with the
[27:26] Holy
[27:26] Ghost right right
[27:34] amen I'd also like to play two quotes
[27:36] from God's Prophet brother brandham
[27:38] about the equality the believer has with
[27:40] God the first is from 1954 questions and
[27:43] answers May 15th brother Bram said man
[27:46] is almost on the equal with God and
[27:49] that's what we're talking about when we
[27:50] talk about the teaching of equality with
[27:53] God man is never fully equal with God
[27:56] but God shares a measure of his spirit
[27:58] with him so here's the quote from
[28:00] questions and answers 54 almost une
[28:02] equal with God but a man is in flesh
[28:05] like a brute but he's got a soul of God
[28:08] anymore it makes him Immortal amen and
[28:10] he can invent look what he can do he's
[28:12] on almost on equal with God because he's
[28:14] a Son of God even in his fall in the
[28:16] faith he's wonderful look at him see
[28:20] that's it and here's the second quote
[28:22] I'd like to share this quote from
[28:24] brother brandom says it even more
[28:25] plainly he refers to the soul of of The
[28:28] Believer from the sermon called the
[28:30] token September
[28:32] 1963 a beautiful quote brother Brams
[28:34] talking about a Believer has passed from
[28:35] Death unto life and of course that must
[28:37] mean eternal life God's own life Zoe
[28:40] life brother R quotes 1 John 3:9 The
[28:44] Believer cannot sin for the seed of God
[28:46] remains in him brother R is referring to
[28:49] the Token or the baptism of the Holy
[28:50] Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ has
[28:52] covered his sins it can't display
[28:54] nothing but the token so a believer's
[28:56] life can only display
[28:58] the eternal life that God shares with
[29:00] him let's listen to the quote September
[29:02] 1st morning 1963 the token there it is
[29:06] it cannot perish now a life lays over
[29:10] it's a token lays over that little body
[29:14] lays over that soul that person there's
[29:17] a token over there the holy spirit that
[29:19] it belongs to God it say when I see the
[29:24] token I'll pass over you a POS postive
[29:29] token the holy spirit is our token
[29:32] therefore when you receive the Holy
[29:34] Ghost you pass from Death to life that's
[29:36] all because life is in you you can no
[29:39] more perish the Bible said he that's
[29:41] formed of God does not commit sin for he
[29:45] cannot sin for the seed of
[29:50] God the seed of God remains in him and
[29:55] how can he sin when the sin God is in
[29:59] him when he's in a sinless God how can
[30:02] he
[30:04] sin no matter what he's done the blood's
[30:06] covered
[30:07] him he's a new creature now his desires
[30:11] and Ambitions is of Heaven because he's
[30:14] changed from a cuckle be to a
[30:16] wheat his desires ain't the same as he
[30:19] once was and he displays it you so I
[30:23] believe that and still sin it ah you're
[30:25] deceived that's right it can't display
[30:29] nothing but the
[30:35] token let's jump to another one brother
[30:38] and uh I I want I want to focus on the
[30:40] Amplified this time because of all the
[30:43] uh little brackets and so forth but uh
[30:46] in 1 Corinthians 11 and I'm just going
[30:47] to read a little bit of the King James
[30:49] but I'm going to read most of it from
[30:50] the
[30:51] Amplified uh and then maybe we can
[30:53] highlight some of those things in 1
[30:55] Corinthians 11:4 of course this whole
[30:58] half of the chapter is working with hair
[31:00] it's working with covering you know we
[31:02] we believe that a woman should not cut
[31:04] her hair amen um in 1 Corinthians 11:4
[31:08] it says every man uh praying or
[31:10] prophesying having his head covered
[31:14] dishonor his head but every woman that
[31:17] prayeth or prophesieth with her head
[31:20] uncovered dishonor her head for that is
[31:23] even all one as if she were shaven for
[31:26] if the woman be not covered let her also
[31:29] be Shor but if it be a shame for a woman
[31:33] to be Shor or shaven let her be covered
[31:36] uh of course if you move down to the
[31:38] 15th verse it says that the covering is
[31:40] the hair said a woman's covering is her
[31:42] hair uh this is something we we've been
[31:44] taught of the seventh angel something
[31:46] the Bible and right there it all makes
[31:49] perfect sense because it's saying that a
[31:51] man should not let his hair grow and
[31:53] never cut it it's saying that a woman
[31:55] should always uh let her hair grow so if
[31:59] we look at the Amplified let's pick this
[32:02] up here so in the fourth verse in the
[32:04] Amplified it says every man who prays or
[32:09] prophesies with something on his head
[32:13] it's completely different so now they're
[32:15] saying that the covering is actually
[32:18] something that I'm putting on my head
[32:20] this is a covering it's not the hair
[32:23] anymore I want you to see this because
[32:25] what you're finding is they're actually
[32:28] beginning to put their Doctrine in with
[32:31] doing this uh anyone who prays or
[32:33] prophesies with something on his head
[32:35] dishonors his head brackets and the one
[32:37] who is the head and every woman who
[32:40] prays or prophesies when she has her
[32:43] head uncovered disgraces her head so
[32:46] it's already bringing on the idea that a
[32:48] covering is something that you would put
[32:51] on your head it's not your hair it's
[32:53] something you put on your head uh for
[32:55] she is one and the same as the woman who
[32:59] whose head is shaved brackets in
[33:02] disgrace if a woman does not cover her
[33:04] head she should have her hair cut off
[33:08] and if it is disgraceful for a woman to
[33:10] have her hair cut off or her head shaped
[33:13] she should cover her head okay then it
[33:18] continues so it's still bringing the
[33:19] same idea I don't know what you're
[33:21] picking up with this but when you just
[33:22] start off with something on the head now
[33:25] the whole thing talks about I got to
[33:26] wear a hoodie I got to we a some sort of
[33:28] a hat so seventh verse picks up and it
[33:32] says a man ought not to have his head
[33:35] covered brackets during worship where do
[33:39] they get that from I can 100% say that
[33:42] is not in the Greek they're putting
[33:44] their own interpretation on this so you
[33:47] know a lot of the message brothers that
[33:48] will say and the Amplified says that you
[33:50] have to be very careful because you can
[33:54] see right here these people are
[33:55] absolutely making something up that only
[33:58] during worship which implies what
[34:00] brother Jesse it implies that it's
[34:02] putting something on right and then that
[34:05] helps them form their well this is just
[34:07] a cultural thing argument rather than no
[34:11] this was Paul's command as he preached
[34:14] everywhere in every church as he said in
[34:16] 1 Corinthians 4 if I'm not mistaken
[34:17] verse 17 and you're right yeah brother
[34:20] you can go back and we can use the Greek
[34:22] Lexicon and we can click every one of
[34:24] those Greek words and it will never say
[34:27] anything about wearing something in the
[34:29] worship right like wearing a hat or
[34:31] wearing a head covering in worship it
[34:33] never says that in the Greek they
[34:35] injected their own false idea into the
[34:38] text yes exactly and that's why you'll
[34:42] find many traditions in churches the
[34:44] women will have to wear hats in church
[34:46] and the men you know when they walk in
[34:48] they'll take their hat off so the women
[34:50] keep their hats on well what is that
[34:52] that's old traditions that they've made
[34:53] off misunderstanding this but we're
[34:56] going to jump down a little bit for time
[34:57] s to the 13th verse so it goes through
[35:00] and says why but now it says in the 13th
[35:02] verse judge for yourselves is it proper
[35:05] for a woman to offer prayer to God
[35:09] brackets publicly with her head
[35:13] uncovered so you see they're they're
[35:15] giving you their Doctrine because now
[35:17] they're injecting in there that this
[35:20] head uncovered is publicly so does not
[35:24] common sense itself teach you that if a
[35:27] man has long hair it is a dishonor to
[35:29] him but if a woman has long hair it is
[35:32] her ornament and glory for her long hair
[35:34] is given to her as a
[35:36] covering well the whole thing is a
[35:39] confused mess now now we're talking
[35:40] about hats now we're back to hair so he
[35:43] says now if anyone is inclined to be
[35:46] contentious brackets about this which I
[35:48] don't know about you I'm feeling a
[35:49] little contentious about this myself
[35:51] right now uh we have no other practice
[35:54] brackets in worship So This only affects
[35:57] this whole thing that they're saying it
[35:58] only affects worship than this brackets
[36:02] nor do the Churches of God in Brackets
[36:05] in
[36:06] general so you see how this is the
[36:09] version I'm hearing several message
[36:11] ministers using nowadays is uh this
[36:13] Amplified trying to get and I and God
[36:15] bless them you know they want to be
[36:16] deeper they want they want to be able to
[36:18] give a more profound understanding but
[36:21] if they're already doing this uh what
[36:23] are we looking at right those are
[36:25] excellent examples you know I just
[36:27] looked in 1 Corinthians 11 in the King
[36:28] James it doesn't say anything about
[36:30] public worship again they added their
[36:32] own thoughts in there so brother these
[36:34] are five amazing areas you know living
[36:36] by every word of God that gets back to
[36:39] you know perfect faith and even love for
[36:41] Jesus Jesus said if you love me keep my
[36:43] commands other words live by the word uh
[36:45] the second was Revelation 10:7 these
[36:48] Bible versions attack our seventh Church
[36:50] age Messengers why would we want to use
[36:52] them uh the serpent seed brother Bram
[36:54] said that doesn't pertain to salvation
[36:56] but it does shine more light on the
[36:58] truth that we're all trying to see and
[37:00] it is a mystery of course it's part of
[37:02] the mystery of iniquity so brother B had
[37:05] to come and finish the mystery of God
[37:06] that was one of them and then our
[37:08] equality with God as far as the Holy
[37:10] Ghost being in us that's attacked by the
[37:12] false Bible translations and then this
[37:14] Fifth and final example for this podcast
[37:17] hair links and remember the Bible says
[37:20] in the King James it's a shame which
[37:23] means a repulse for a woman to cut her
[37:26] hair and it has nothing to do with the
[37:28] the man-made coverings of the hat or the
[37:31] cloth or anything like that Paul is
[37:33] clear this is a disgrace this is a
[37:35] repuls which means a disgusting thing
[37:37] when a woman cuts her hair or a man
[37:39] grows his hair out uncut like a woman so
[37:43] we see how the King James protects the
[37:46] Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ
[37:48] revealed to Paul and then had to restore
[37:50] through Luther Wesley and then finish
[37:52] the mystery of God with brother
[37:54] brandom Hallelujah exactly right brother
[38:03] so we've come to the conclusion of part
[38:04] two on this podcast series of Bible
[38:07] versions hopefully this series is
[38:09] beginning to prove to everybody that the
[38:10] King James version is the only fully
[38:12] accurate infallible version of the Bible
[38:16] by the grace of God we've only scratched
[38:18] the surface we look forward to having
[38:19] further podcasts that discuss all the
[38:22] changes sadly that new Bible versions
[38:25] are making to God's holy word so we want
[38:28] to thank brother cam for being on this
[38:29] podcast and we're going to invite him
[38:30] back for another recording again very
[38:32] soon by the grace of God so we'll let
[38:35] brother cam say a final few words here
[38:37] and share a little more about some of
[38:39] the resources he'd recommend if you're
[38:41] interested in studying this topic all
[38:44] right thank you brother Jesse it's been
[38:45] a real blessing to be here and we're
[38:46] glad uh that the Lord has anointed you
[38:49] in such a way to try to help the people
[38:52] of God uh with answers uh and to better
[38:54] the relationship with Jesus Christ I
[38:57] would say in in closing uh if anyone
[38:59] would be interested there's a few places
[39:02] you can go there's actually many places
[39:03] you could go uh but I would recommend it
[39:06] especially because we're in the 21st
[39:07] century a man a filmmaker named Chris
[39:10] Pinto uh has done numerous films but uh
[39:14] regarding the Bible and the Bible
[39:15] version say he has three very very
[39:18] filling Works he has a lamp in the
[39:20] darkness he has bridge to Babylon and
[39:24] then tears among the wheat that's the
[39:26] name of it those those are very good uh
[39:29] documentaries they're almost three hours
[39:31] long a piece but they're just jam-packed
[39:33] full of very good evidence quotes and so
[39:36] forth um that's a real good one uh
[39:38] another resource would be um ww. bs. net
[39:44] and then you could look up books uh
[39:46] David souron has some really good books
[39:48] on the subject so do Floyd Jones uh
[39:51] which version is the Bible that was a
[39:53] very good one Dr Samuel Gip has the
[39:56] understandable history of King James
[39:57] Bible very good Jack Mormon he has
[40:00] forever settled uh a few other books I
[40:02] have and then David Daniels has very
[40:05] good readable resources like what's
[40:07] missing in my Bible did Jesus use the
[40:10] septu aant uh which is the Greek New
[40:12] Testament there's a lot of resources
[40:15] that he has and he's at chick.com so
[40:18] there's so much there to prove that
[40:19] you're on the right track uh because
[40:21] what we're dealing with here is we're
[40:23] dealing with a Protestant versus
[40:25] Catholic uh idea two lines that's where
[40:28] we're at so that's where I'm at brother
[40:30] Jesse amen well we appreciate that
[40:32] brother cam thanks for all the studying
[40:34] you've done may God richly bless you as
[40:37] you continue to study we appreciate your
[40:38] stand for the truth brother and we just
[40:40] love the word of God I think of these
[40:42] former saints that gave their lives for
[40:44] the word of God and we live in such a
[40:46] blessed age we don't suffer anything
[40:49] that they did as far as imprisonment yet
[40:52] or martyrdom and so we must remember the
[40:55] sacrifices that these men made to give
[40:57] the perfect word of God uh brother cam
[41:00] did mention that book look what's
[41:01] missing cam gave me a copy of that by
[41:03] David W Daniels it's an amazing book
[41:07] easy to read I used it to preach a few
[41:09] sermons about this to my church and
[41:12] Floyd Nolan Jones's book what version is
[41:15] the Bible I use parts of that in my 2021
[41:17] book so these are awesome resources and
[41:20] as our brother said the proof is right
[41:21] there in front of you the proof is in
[41:22] the pudding it's plain to see and we
[41:25] have to be on guard because s is trying
[41:27] to attack the true Revelation brother
[41:29] Bram calls it bride Doctrine Satan is
[41:32] against uh the bride Doctrine right as
[41:34] we saw five awesome examples the Lord
[41:36] showed our brother cam so we're very
[41:38] grateful for that the Antichrist refuses
[41:41] the true
[41:43] bride Doctrine and therefore he takes
[41:46] his own bride now and builds her up
[41:49] under a Creed of his own thank you so
[41:54] much brother Cam and we look forward to
[41:55] the next podcast by the grace of God
[42:03] so that brings this podcast to a
[42:04] conclusion friends thank you for your
[42:07] downloads and if you feel led of the
[42:08] Holy Spirit to share this with someone

[42:27] dead living among men today his church
[42:30] the same Jesus that was yesterday will
[42:33] be today and
[42:35] forever is never failed
