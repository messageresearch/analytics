[21:30] [Music]

[21:44] [Applause]
[21:52] jesk
[21:54] Lord God it's just a little honor here
[21:56] to be here to tonight just a little
[21:59] basic kind of teacher guy I am um so
[22:03] we're just going to dive into the word
[22:04] of God it's going to be uh little 101
[22:07] Sunday school so I hope it's all right
[22:09] um but Jess wanted me to do that last
[22:12] Wednesday uh but I felt we felt led to
[22:14] go somewhere else I felt led and uh we
[22:17] went that way and I believe the Lord had
[22:18] his way so amen So today we're gonna uh
[22:21] fulfill brother Jesse's request here
[22:23] just a a simple teaching on the topic of
[22:26] the serpent seed
[22:29] so we're going to pretend like none of
[22:30] us know this Doctrine uh none of us have
[22:33] been taught this Doctrine and that this
[22:35] is brand new fresh um yes 14 years ago
[22:39] when I come to the message and I hear
[22:41] this word and I'm like just overwhelmed
[22:44] with Revelation by the grace of God Amen
[22:46] praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles
[22:49] here to uh Revelations
[22:56] 20 and never started this study right
[22:59] here before but kind of felt led to go
[23:01] this way uh for the start of it
[23:04] Revelations 20 uh verse five and
[23:08] six and then we'll be turned to Matthew
[23:13] 25 Revelations 20 verse 5 says but the
[23:18] rest of the Dead live not again until
[23:20] the thousand years were finished he says
[23:22] this is the first
[23:24] resurrection he says blessed and holy is
[23:27] he that hath part in the First
[23:29] Resurrection on such the second death
[23:32] hath no power amen he says but they
[23:34] shall be Priests of of God and of Christ
[23:37] and shall reign with him a thousand
[23:39] years so we see here a people uh that
[23:42] are in the first resurrection the Bible
[23:44] calls them
[23:45] blessed and holy absolutely so now let's
[23:49] turn to Matthew
[23:52] 25 amen
[23:55] man Matthew 25
[24:03] Matthew 25 um we see the great white
[24:06] judgment Throne yes here preached by our
[24:09] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Matthew
[24:12] 25:34 he says then shall the king say
[24:15] unto them on his right hand Come Ye
[24:17] blessed of my
[24:19] father he says he says inherit the
[24:22] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[24:24] foundation of the world so here's a
[24:26] people that's not holy but they are
[24:28] blessed absolutely amen now we see here
[24:32] on uh verse 41 then shall he say un unto
[24:36] them on the left hand depart from me ye
[24:40] cursed into Everlasting fire prepared
[24:43] for the devil and his angels so here we
[24:45] see no one blessed here at this portion
[24:48] he said but they are actually cursed
[24:50] this people here so let's bow our heads
[24:53] in a word of prayer
[24:55] amen dear Lord Jesus
[24:58] Lord we love you God Lord we thank you
[25:00] so much thank Lord for being blessed God
[25:04] lord the Bible says Lord Jesus even said
[25:06] Lord when he was on Earth Lord as the
[25:08] Bible says in the days of his flesh God
[25:10] he taught his disciples and said blessed
[25:12] are your eyes and blessed your ears for
[25:15] they see and hear Lord God and Lord Here

[27:39] children he says I've got a couple grown
[27:40] boys he said and no matter what those
[27:42] boys do no matter what them boys would
[27:45] do whether they'd steal he says whether
[27:47] he said they would murder someone he
[27:49] says whether they rape this or they do
[27:51] whatever they whatever the worst worst
[27:53] sin committed he says he says he says me
[27:55] being their father he says I could never
[27:58] ever send them to
[28:01] hell and he said how can God being a god
[28:05] of full love uh being a God that has all
[28:09] mercy and Grace and for knowledge and
[28:12] this and that how can he send those how
[28:14] can he send some of his children to
[28:17] hell and I had the answer at the tip of
[28:20] my tongue
[28:22] right and I said brother you've never
[28:25] been taught the scripture correctly amen
[28:27] wow he said oh this and this and he
[28:28] would never let me get get into it but I
[28:30] said you you just you've Fallen back
[28:33] because of lack of knowledge the Bible
[28:34] says hose 46 he says because of lack of
[28:37] knowledge my people perish absolutely so
[28:40] we want to dive into this and and and
[28:42] and and I know we all know these things
[28:44] but we want to for our brother here we
[28:45] want to rehash these things so here in
[28:47] Revelations 20 we see a people that is
[28:49] blessed and holy that were able to
[28:51] partake in the first resurrection
[28:53] absolutely that's right he said but
[28:54] these are not the same people here we
[28:56] see in Matthew 25 for here there's a
[28:58] group of people and the Bible says the
[29:00] Good Shepherd here will divide as as a
[29:02] shepherd He will divide them as sheep
[29:04] and as goats absolutely one on the right
[29:06] hand and one on the left the one on the
[29:08] right obviously received and says and
[29:10] the Bible says they are just blessed
[29:12] absolutely right and a and are able to
[29:15] walk into eternal life now here on the
[29:18] left here we have a group of people that
[29:21] are typed as goats and they are cursed
[29:24] absolutely so we want to we want to take
[29:25] this Avenue here tonight
[29:28] um we've taught this my I feel bad for
[29:30] my wife here she sat through this Bible
[29:32] study couple hundred times here as we
[29:35] you know kitchen tables you know just
[29:37] teaching 101 just driving it down and
[29:39] just trying you know takes if you
[29:40] actually go through this entire study
[29:42] it's about three what four or five hours
[29:44] you could go going verse by verse by
[29:46] verse by verse absolutely you know
[29:48] taking uh obviously coming up for breast
[29:49] of air
[29:51] absolutely by the grace of God so we
[29:53] want to guide want to dive into this
[29:55] let's go to Psalms 37 hit a little bit
[29:58] here and hopefully we can at least get
[30:00] through the foundation tonight praise
[30:02] God
[30:05] so I know in the church age book uh it's
[30:09] written he pulls from Revelations 3 as
[30:12] we turn to Psalms 37 and he says he says
[30:15] he says they are the Bible says in
[30:16] Revelations 3 the uh the leosan church
[30:19] AG says they are miserable and when he
[30:22] hits that word miserable he says he
[30:24] these are vessels of pity right he says
[30:26] have pity on them I don't he says I
[30:28] don't care how rich they are
[30:29] paraphrasing he says I don't care how
[30:31] rich they are how big their churches are
[30:32] any this and that he says they are
[30:34] vessels of pity he says don't envy them
[30:36] at all he says just have pity on them no
[30:38] matter what they do to you have pity on
[30:41] them absolutely amen absolute Psalms 37
[30:44] verse uh 20 uh 21 beautiful the Bible
[30:48] says the wicked Borth and payeth not
[30:50] again but the righteous showeth mercy
[30:53] and giveth for such as as be the Blessed
[30:55] of him that inherit the Earth says and
[30:58] they shall be cursed of him and and they
[31:00] that be cursed of him shall be cut off
[31:02] he says the steps of the good man are
[31:04] ordered by the Lord and He delighteth in
[31:06] the way though he fall he shall not be
[31:08] utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth
[31:10] his him with his hand absolutely so
[31:12] here's a curse he says and there are
[31:13] those that are steps the good man
[31:15] absolutely once again we see them
[31:16] together located in the scripture
[31:18] together absolutely now um you don't
[31:22] have to go there uh but let's turn to
[31:24] Genesis no actually let's turn to
[31:25] Genesis 1 I'm sorry but Numbers 22 when
[31:28] balum tried to curse the children of
[31:30] Israel God pretty much came down and and
[31:33] and told him no and balum told the king
[31:35] he says he says you cannot uh curse
[31:37] what's blessed and you can't bless
[31:39] what's cursed absolutely he says what
[31:41] God's done is done and is finished
[31:43] absolutely I can do no more absolutely
[31:44] that's right so we want to see where
[31:47] this blessing and cursing uh where this
[31:50] thing came from because the Bible says
[31:51] they were cursed that's past tense he
[31:54] says they were blessed he said that was
[31:56] past tense absolutely right so it had to
[31:58] come somewhere it had to start somewhere
[32:01] and of course we want to go to Genesis
[32:02] the origin the gene seed chapter
[32:05] absolutely now in Genesis 1 the first
[32:09] day what light came forth right
[32:12] absolutely uh we know that's the I
[32:14] believe the logos there now in day two
[32:17] it says now he brings the firmament he
[32:19] separates the waters and this and that
[32:20] so we want to find a location where the
[32:22] first thing that's blessed is blessed we
[32:24] find that in day five now in day five
[32:27] God said let the waters bring forth
[32:28] abundantly the moving creature that hath
[32:31] life right he says the foul that may fly
[32:33] above in the earth he says in the open
[32:35] firment he says and God created the
[32:36] whales also see so here he's bringing
[32:39] the birds and the whales everything
[32:40] right in day five absolutely but now
[32:42] it's notice in verse 22 he says and God
[32:45] blessed them absolutely so here we see
[32:48] the very first thing that's blessed
[32:49] absolutely that's right and we see it's
[32:51] the birds the Eagles uh even the
[32:53] vultures whatever he said and then it's
[32:55] the fish of the sea the whales
[32:57] everything those things are blessed
[32:59] absolutely now we as we enter and leave
[33:02] the we leave the fifth day going into
[33:03] the sixth day notice in verse 24 and God
[33:06] said let the Earth bring forth the
[33:08] living creature after his
[33:10] kind the cattle the creeping thing he
[33:13] says and the Beast of the Earth Earth
[33:16] after his kind and it was so verse 25
[33:19] and God made the Beast of the earth
[33:20] after his kind and cattle after their
[33:22] kind and after that after everything
[33:24] that creepeth upon the Earth after his
[33:26] kind and God s it was good notice he
[33:28] placed no blessing upon these these
[33:31] people or like upon these animals
[33:34] absolutely right the the dog uh the cat
[33:38] the the the goat uh the Sheep whatever
[33:40] there's no blessing put on any of these
[33:42] animals absolutely natural b or not boty
[33:45] but just natural life absolutely
[33:47] absolutely they have Flesh and Blood
[33:48] like we do absolutely that live that
[33:51] don't are not in a firmament we don't
[33:52] they don't uh they don't fly in the air
[33:54] uh the fish pretty much fly in the water
[33:56] kind of he said but these are those that
[33:58] are dwelling and confined by gravity I
[34:00] say like that that walk on their little
[34:02] feet my grandpa Garza he was a full
[34:03] Mexican and you see a cat and he call it
[34:05] four feet he get those four feet away
[34:07] from
[34:08] me call it four foot because they had
[34:10] four feet that's right no hands just
[34:13] feet absolutely now but now as we
[34:15] continue in the sixth day he says verse
[34:18] 26 now he's moved some to something more
[34:21] personal and God said let us make man in
[34:24] our image he says after our likeness and
[34:26] let them have dominion over the fish of
[34:28] the sea and over the fowls of the air
[34:30] absolutely I have to repent here real
[34:32] quick I forgot to call my brother John
[34:35] Graham who is going to be listening in
[34:38] thank
[34:40] you my goodness that's slipped see how
[34:42] forgetful I am my goodness my wife has
[34:45] is pretty much my
[34:47] secretary I must been the Lord there I
[34:49] was we we were teaching here amen amen I
[34:54] apologize praise God
[34:57] brother
[34:59] John Amen brother all right I actually
[35:01] forgot but we're we're dialing in you
[35:03] now is that all
[35:06] right okay all right brother God bless
[35:10] you have
[35:13] mercy now in verse 26 God said let us
[35:16] make man in our image after our likeness
[35:18] he says Let There have dominion over the
[35:20] fish of the seene above the foul of the
[35:21] air and over the cattle and over all the
[35:23] Earth right he says and over every
[35:25] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[35:26] Earth
[35:27] now in verse he goes and God created man
[35:29] in his own image in verse 28 he says and
[35:31] God blessed them so we see the original
[35:36] blessing of those in Revelations 20 and
[35:40] the those sitting on the right hand in
[35:43] Matthew 25 absolutely so here are these
[35:46] people that are on the right hand of
[35:48] Christ those that have went and taken
[35:50] part of the first resurrection they had
[35:51] to be right here in this group
[35:53] absolutely they had to be because look
[35:56] look the Bible says and God blessed them
[35:58] and God s to be fruitful and multiply
[36:00] and replace the Earth and SED do it and
[36:02] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[36:03] and over the fowls of the air and over
[36:05] every living thing that moveth upon the
[36:07] Earth absolutely so we want to establish
[36:10] that we see the first blessing here in
[36:12] Genesis this goes to what the Sons and
[36:15] Daughters of God absolutely absolutely
[36:18] and as God did the creating he went from
[36:20] uh lower forms of life all the way up to
[36:23] what we are the peak and Pinnacle or the
[36:24] very image expressed that was in his
[36:26] mind uh we are direct descendants of God
[36:29] himself Absolut look at Matthew
[36:31] absolutely you'll see we that Adam was
[36:33] of God
[36:35] ABS what a lineage oh my amen that's
[36:39] right praise God
[36:41] nowah so in finding these things we find
[36:44] the Bless but now we want to do a little
[36:46] uh investigation and try and find uh uh
[36:49] where the curse are now we know uh of
[36:52] course we're pretending like we don't
[36:54] know any of these things um so we're
[36:56] going to dive in is is if I was sitting
[36:58] here at a kitchen table or standing at a
[37:00] kitchen table teaching someone this
[37:01] Doctrine for the first time or this word
[37:03] of God for the first time I'd say is a
[37:05] brother or sister or however I'd like to
[37:08] take you to Genesis um two here and I
[37:11] want to examine exactly where he put his
[37:14] son of God at absolutely he says now in
[37:17] Genesis 2 and verse
[37:20] 8 and the Lord kind of opened up another
[37:23] study I might be teaching for uh my
[37:25] pastor back home brother cim um and it
[37:27] has to do um with this scripture right
[37:30] here Genesis 2:8 he says and the Lord
[37:32] God planted a garden Eastward and
[37:35] Eden if you search the message and look
[37:37] East Side just type in East in this
[37:40] you'll find something amazing he says
[37:42] and there he put the man whom he had
[37:44] formed and on the ground he says now he
[37:46] says now look he says he's putting him
[37:47] in this Garden of Eden he says it's it's
[37:50] planted right here is in out of the
[37:51] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[37:53] tree that is Pleasant to sight and good
[37:54] for food so here's all the these trees
[37:57] that is good for food for Adam he says
[37:59] they're Pleasant sight they're nice to
[38:00] look at whatever he says he says and
[38:02] they're good for food and then we see
[38:03] what a semicolon right absolutely this
[38:06] is 101 right he says he says semicolon
[38:09] represents a
[38:10] separation so now God is teaching
[38:13] through the word of God and laying this
[38:15] out for his son and said he says look he
[38:17] says these trees are good he says eat
[38:19] from these right he says he then then of
[38:22] course the Holy Ghost uh inspired uh
[38:25] maybe translators of the scripture put a
[38:26] semicolon in here he says which means a
[38:29] separation and then it says he says the
[38:31] tree of life also in the midst of the
[38:33] garden and the tree of n are good evil
[38:35] absolutely so these trees are separate
[38:37] from those trees which grow out of the
[38:39] ground which come from what seed form
[38:41] right you plant them in the ground and
[38:42] they grow up and they they little
[38:44] tassels or or stalks or whatever then
[38:46] they come out and form branches and then
[38:48] there's leaves and then there's fruit
[38:49] off them absolutely now these are those
[38:52] on the left side there but here on the
[38:54] right side of the scripture he say the
[38:55] tree of life in the M the garden and the
[38:57] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[38:58] absolutely so here we see the two trees
[39:01] absolutely now if I was teaching this to
[39:02] someone I would say now now brother
[39:04] brother sister now when I first heard
[39:06] this and I teach it the way I was taught
[39:08] because this makes the this is the
[39:10] clearest path that I can see absolutely
[39:13] now he asked me a question I just gotten
[39:16] out of college I did not fully graduate
[39:18] absolutely because God dealt with me in
[39:20] away and broke me totally allowed my he
[39:24] allowed me to destroy my life absolutely
[39:26] and then he called me to this word so
[39:28] here this brother asked me he said
[39:29] brother Simon he says now what do you
[39:32] think these trees are he says what is
[39:34] the tree of life and what is the tree of
[39:36] knowledge of G and I'm thinking you know
[39:37] in my little College
[39:39] brain and knowing a little bit about
[39:41] nature and trees I used to climb back in
[39:43] my grandma's house you know whatever I
[39:45] thought the tree of
[39:47] life it must be the Evergreen because
[39:50] the ever oh yeah oh yeah yeah I'm
[39:52] revelated that's right he says the tree
[39:54] of the the the Evergreen right it's
[39:56] stays green year round It Never Dies oh
[40:00] man I thought I had it I said I got it I
[40:02] told him he said brother that's very
[40:03] nice that's very educated guess he said
[40:04] but that's not
[40:06] it and I sat there and I thinking I said
[40:09] what that's not the tree of life he said
[40:11] no he goes let's go and see what the
[40:14] word says I was like and now you
[40:18] couldn't I I mean every devil in hell
[40:19] could not anointed me to sleep that
[40:21] night that's right I was right there God
[40:23] knows if if you know me I I don't have a
[40:25] problem sleeping yeah but that night I
[40:27] was wide awake and my eyes were peel
[40:29] peeled and my ears were right there just
[40:31] like my dogs when the ears Point like
[40:33] this not like this right in front
[40:35] they're ready now we want to go and look
[40:38] at what these trees are absolutely what
[40:41] is a tree in the scripture we know like
[40:43] that this that the Bible says uh pretty
[40:45] much not that the b in a way the Bible
[40:46] says the word interprets itself
[40:49] absolutely when the word came down in
[40:51] flesh he interpreted the word absolutely
[40:53] that's right that's right and the Bible
[40:55] says the word of God always comes to
[40:57] what the prophets Daniel 222 uh Amos 37
[41:00] right absolutely now so what are what do
[41:04] trees represent and maybe we can find
[41:06] out what these trees were absolutely so
[41:09] we're want to go through this now let's
[41:10] go to Psalms uh one and this is one of
[41:12] the scriptures that brother taught me he
[41:14] says he took me to here is Psalms one so
[41:17] now it's not it's not an evergreen tree
[41:19] a fully Green Tree or round whatever uh
[41:22] now I'm trying to think and think and
[41:23] then he hits his scripture here in
[41:24] Psalms 1 verse one he says blessed is
[41:27] the man that walketh not after the
[41:29] counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in
[41:30] the way of Sinners he says nor sth in
[41:32] the seat of the scornful he says but his
[41:35] Delight shall be in the law of the Lord
[41:36] and in his law do he meditate day and
[41:38] night I'm think okay it's here we go
[41:40] okay all right now then he is verse
[41:42] three and I'm like what are you
[41:45] serious yes he says and he shall be
[41:48] planted like a
[41:51] tree planted by he said he shall be like
[41:54] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[41:56] that bring forth his fruit in his season
[41:59] and his Leaf no typing what a man has a
[42:03] tree he says he says and bring forth his
[42:05] fruit in his season his Leaf also shall
[42:08] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[42:11] prosper so here he shows me the very
[42:13] first scripture and if you run you know
[42:15] Old Testament New Testament it's all the
[42:17] way through a man is a type of a tree
[42:22] absolutely that's right now as far as I
[42:25] know and the way was born I did not was
[42:27] not a seed planted into the ground and I
[42:30] did not grow up out of the ground with a
[42:31] little little stalk or whatever a root
[42:33] or whatever he says but I was born
[42:35] through a woman absolutely that's right
[42:37] absolutely so I could not come of could
[42:39] not be describing a man as far as the
[42:41] trees that grow out of the ground are
[42:43] good for food absolutely now he says
[42:46] verse four he says the ungodly are not
[42:49] so he says but are like the chaff which
[42:51] the wind driveth away he says wherefore
[42:53] therefore the ungodly shall stand in the
[42:55] J judgement nor sinners in the
[42:58] congregation of the righteous for the
[42:59] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous uh
[43:01] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[43:03] so here he brings it once again two sets
[43:06] of people one they both typed his tree
[43:09] one is blessed and the other one is not
[43:12] so blessed they come up in the Judgment
[43:14] under judgment I wonder if they would be
[43:17] the cursed ones my come on yes Lord now
[43:21] Psalms 37 he took me and he ran me all
[43:23] the way through psalms now we're not
[43:24] going to hit every single scripture
[43:26] tonight obviously uh this is a three
[43:29] four hour Bible study and even longer if
[43:31] you want to get super super deep and
[43:33] have hit every angle and every kind of
[43:35] way you can now Psalms 37:34 he says
[43:38] wait on the Lord and keep his way and he
[43:41] shall exalt thee to the to inherit the
[43:43] land when the wicked are cut off Thou
[43:46] shalt see it notice the Bible says the
[43:48] wicked are cut off
[43:50] absolutely when John the Baptist came
[43:52] into the scene he says he says he says
[43:54] I'm take the axe to the root absolutely
[43:57] absolutely Christ said the same thing in
[43:59] a way he says so they're taking the axe
[44:01] to the root absolutely he says what
[44:03] they're cut off he says uh he says and I
[44:06] have seen the wicked in great power he
[44:08] says spreading himself like a Green Bay
[44:12] Tree absolutely so here uh uh David
[44:15] types the the evil or the wicked as a
[44:17] Green Bay Tree absolutely so here we see
[44:20] even the wicked as types what of tree I
[44:22] know this is 101 absolutely servac SE
[44:24] that's right Psalms 52 beautiful
[44:28] beautiful absolutely very simple
[44:30] absolutely but now as he's teaching me
[44:33] this my eyes are like no
[44:35] way and I've been chewing on this for 14
[44:39] years regurgitation and just gurita and
[44:42] urita and just chewy and cheu ification
[44:45] absolutely that's right that's what we
[44:47] do that's right because why this is this
[44:49] is still mean to me it never gets old
[44:52] abolutely that's right and you can still
[44:54] go through the scripture and find more
[44:56] and more openings more and more Avenues
[44:57] and way to teach this right absolutely
[45:01] Psalms 52 verse he says verse uh seven
[45:04] he says lo this is the man that hath not
[45:07] strength not God his strength but
[45:10] trusteth in the abundance of his riches
[45:11] and strengthen himself in his wickedness
[45:13] he says but look David says he says he
[45:15] says a man who trusts in money trusted
[45:17] in this and that he said they Wicked man
[45:19] he says he says but I am like a green
[45:21] olive tree in the house of God SS of God

[46:10] in the coffins tonight or to clench or
[46:13] whatever but we're just hitting uh
[46:15] highlights I'm sure brother Jesse has
[46:17] all these dialed in already Psalms 92
[46:20] verse 12 he says the righteous shall
[46:22] flourish like the palm tree he shall
[46:25] grow like a cedar and Lebanon he says
[46:28] those that be planted in the house of
[46:31] the Lord shall flourish in the courts of
[46:33] our God absolutely that's right notice
[46:35] he types them was what planted right in
[46:36] the churches absolutely that's where
[46:38] you're supposed to grow what through the
[46:39] watering of the word of God absolutely
[46:43] so this is a this is a little
[46:44] Congregation of trees tonight absolutely
[46:46] that's right that's right amen if we
[46:49] want to be Trees of Righteousness
[46:51] absolutely that's right praise God
[46:53] that's right so here we see now he runs
[46:55] me through these I'm thinking oh my
[46:58] goodness a man is a type of a
[47:01] tree and he runs this and he runs this
[47:04] through continues in the Old Testament
[47:05] this and this this and I'm like man's
[47:08] type of the tree my goodness all right
[47:12] then he asked me again
[47:14] brother what do you think the tree of
[47:16] life
[47:18] is and now I had moved from my Defiance
[47:21] colge
[47:23] education remember I was a science major
[47:26] yes bio education yeah going to teach
[47:28] like brother J but God said no teaching
[47:32] natural now I teach spiritual right so
[47:34] now I'm thinking it's not an evergreen
[47:36] tree they're not cones he says they do
[47:38] not prick you he says but I'm
[47:40] thinking it must be Jesus Christ he said
[47:44] brother that's
[47:46] right and now now your own now thoughts
[47:50] are really running spiritual
[47:51] thoughts not from the educational
[47:54] thoughts now let's continue on here
[47:57] now let's go to Genesis 3 again verse 22
[48:02] I hope my friend uh Derek there is en
[48:04] enjoying the little study here amen just
[48:07] taking you a walk through Genesis what
[48:09] the original sin was uh and who are
[48:12] these two sets of people Genesis
[48:17] 2 I'm sorry Genesis 3 I'm sorry
[48:20] apologize and he took me to the
[48:22] scripture here Genesis 3 and22 he said
[48:25] the Lord God said behold man has become
[48:28] as one of us to know good and evil and
[48:32] now let he put forth his hand and take
[48:34] also the tree of life and eat and live
[48:39] forever and he said brother this has to
[48:44] be Jesus Christ I said now how are you
[48:46] you're pretty sure he said yes
[48:47] absolutely he says he says look he says
[48:50] this tree if if we can literally go back
[48:52] 6,000 years from now and get next to
[48:54] Adam and move him out of away a little
[48:56] bit and we actually could say go let me
[48:58] let me get this tree of life if we could
[49:00] go back 6,000 years if we could partake
[49:03] of the tree of life then the Bible says
[49:05] we could live forever what have eternal
[49:09] life I said really he said yes he says
[49:12] look at the scripture I was like okay
[49:14] says well I thought there was only one
[49:16] way to eternal life exactly he said well
[49:19] here we have the tree of life and I
[49:20] thought Jesus Christ was it and I said
[49:23] oh now I understand
[49:26] I see what because Jesus said I am the
[49:28] way the truth and the life no man comes
[49:33] under the father except through me this
[49:35] has to be the tree of life is Jesus
[49:38] Christ absolutely now you don't have to
[49:41] turn there in John 6 35-48 the Bible
[49:44] says that Jesus is the bread of life now
[49:47] in Acts 3:15 it says the Bible says he
[49:49] is the Prince of Life he says in 1 John
[49:52] 1:1 he says the Bible says he is the
[49:54] word of life
[49:56] right absolutely John 14:6 Jesus said
[49:58] what we said before he says I am the way
[50:00] the truth and the life he says in
[50:02] Genesis 3 and22 he is the Tree of Life
[50:06] absolutely he is life however you want
[50:08] to bring it he is life you bring
[50:10] anything as it him he is life absolutely
[50:13] right he's the oil of our life
[50:15] absolutely right he's the husband of our
[50:17] life absolutely right he is everything
[50:20] he is life John one absolutely that's
[50:22] right now so we know there's only one
[50:25] form of life uh uh he there's a whole
[50:27] bunch of scriptures 1 John 51-13 you
[50:29] have to go there uh Romans 6 uh 23
[50:32] Romans 5 and 21 dealing and showing that
[50:34] Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal
[50:36] life absolutely that's right so we have
[50:38] pinpointed for sure through scripture uh
[50:40] through type and we obviously we skip
[50:42] tried 10 15 20 more scriptures on men
[50:45] typed as trees we can go to Daniel and
[50:47] show Nebuchadnezzar was that great tree
[50:50] absolutely and the the fouls of the year
[50:52] dwelt and branched in that tree
[50:53] absolutely he says and everything was
[50:55] blessed while underneath that tree
[50:57] absolutely and then the Bible says that
[50:58] God cut that tree down absolutely and he
[51:01] go into the the the Wilderness and ate
[51:03] like an ax right absolutely grew little
[51:05] eagle feathers or whatever how it was
[51:07] either claws or whatever absolutely he
[51:09] was just like that right but he was a
[51:10] type of a great tree absolutely that's
[51:13] right now he said now he said let's dial
[51:16] let's just move on we have identified
[51:17] the tree now if this be a tree if this
[51:20] be tree be a person yeah and the B and
[51:23] all trees are it's like this that are
[51:25] good he says they'll have fruit on them
[51:27] what are the fruit what is the fruit of
[51:30] Jesus Christ absolutely let's let's
[51:31] let's look at that today now let's go to
[51:33] Galatians
[51:35] 5 real simple
[51:39] absolutely glory and you're going to see
[51:42] something about one of these fruits
[51:44] that's very very powerful Saints and
[51:47] it's the fruit that only in this age
[51:49] will stand okay
[51:53] yes Glory now
[51:55] now uh Galatians 5 I'm sure we all know
[51:59] what we're we're aiming at here
[52:00] Galatians 5 and uh 22 he says but the
[52:04] fruit of the spirit what Jesus Christ
[52:07] and spirit for he says is love his joy
[52:11] peace longsuffering gentleness goodness
[52:14] Faith meekness Temperance against such
[52:16] there is no law is this all the fruits
[52:18] of the spirit yes no it's not this is
[52:23] not all the fruits of the spirit
[52:25] because all of these can be mimicked all
[52:28] these can be imitated and you will not
[52:30] be able to tell who's who yeah remember
[52:33] Christ come on the scene and the priest
[52:34] was there who looked like the real
[52:36] Christian who looked like uh who looked
[52:38] like the Messiah the old kind priest and
[52:40] just helped you out and you know a wink
[52:42] or whatever just whatever need a bill
[52:44] pay you know blessing all the children
[52:46] whatever or Christ that comes in the
[52:47] temple and whips the temple beat the
[52:49] Changers of money right who look like
[52:51] the real one was that the love I thought
[52:53] he loved us Absolut I thought God is a
[52:55] god of love absolutely yes that's not
[52:58] all the
[52:59] fruits and if you understand the word of
[53:01] God like we do we know that that was
[53:03] real love correction is love AB judgment
[53:05] is love absolutely right now let's look
[53:07] at the rest the remainder of the fruits
[53:09] and you're going to see a fruit that the
[53:12] others
[53:13] cannot
[53:14] imitate they can get really really close
[53:17] like we tght last Wednesday if you
[53:18] remember the end of the service right
[53:21] shibo and sio right one h
[53:25] they were off on the word by one H one
[53:27] letter yes right amen now let's go to
[53:31] Ephesians
[53:36] 5 and here's where it's revealed a fruit
[53:40] and it's the very last fruit because
[53:43] Jesus said if you continue in my word
[53:46] yes Ephesians 5 and verse eight he says
[53:50] for for ye were sometimes Darkness but
[53:52] now ye are light in the Lord walk as is
[53:55] Children of light right he says for the
[53:57] fruit of the spirit is all goodness and
[54:00] righteousness and truth yes the r the
[54:04] one fruit of the spirit that can never
[54:07] be imitated is truth amen absolutely
[54:11] that's right now to just cap on that
[54:14] just for a second turn to John 8 and
[54:17] we'll run through a little bit here
[54:19] saints of God you don't know how blessed
[54:21] you are we will even even I wonder if in
[54:23] through eternity if what really
[54:25] understand how blessed we are I mean
[54:27] when we get there it's going to be out
[54:28] of control anyhow but through eternity
[54:31] it will never ever get old it'll
[54:33] continue to grow and our joy will be
[54:34] expounded even more absolutely thank God
[54:38] we won't be in these little flesh bodies
[54:39] they'll explode absolutely but we'll
[54:41] have what uh spoken word bodies
[54:43] absolutely that's right glorified bodies
[54:45] now John 8 verse 31 now he's dealing
[54:49] with the scribes and Pharisees here uh
[54:51] Sadducees whoever he says verse 31 then
[54:54] said Jesus to those those Jews which
[54:56] believe me if you continue in my word
[55:00] word right he says then ye are my
[55:03] disciples not if you just hear a good
[55:05] message or a good Doctrine and you you
[55:07] get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:09] and fall away in two years or year
[55:11] whatever that's not continuing in the
[55:13] word what the truth is to continue in
[55:16] truth absolutely that's right even when
[55:19] at this hour truth may look like
[55:21] Antichrist absolutely or not accepted
[55:24] like our holy rer absolutely now in John
[55:26] 8 verse 37 he says I know that you're
[55:30] Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[55:33] because my word hath no place in you
[55:36] absolutely there's nowhere to put it in
[55:38] them absolutely they they can ex they
[55:40] can take it in but where does it sit
[55:42] where does it lie where does it where
[55:43] does it actually seal there's no place
[55:45] to seal it they have no place for it he
[55:47] says and I speak that which I have seen
[55:49] of your father and you did which you
[55:50] have seen of your father absolutely now
[55:53] jump to uh verse 4
[55:56] three he says why do you not understand
[55:59] my speech even because you cannot
[56:03] hear my
[56:05] word look at that absolutely truth they
[56:09] cannot handle it they cannot be settled
[56:12] on the truth they will not continue in
[56:14] absolutely now let's jump back off that
[56:16] for a little bit here by the grace of
[56:17] God now let's continue on here so we
[56:20] know the what the tree of life is Jesus
[56:22] Christ absolutely we know the fruits of
[56:24] the spirit love joy peace kindness and
[56:25] what and of course the last one the most
[56:27] important or whatever is truth
[56:29] absolutely it's right absolutely because
[56:31] God is truth all truth lies in his word
[56:33] absolutely now so now he's he's going
[56:36] through the study with me so we've
[56:37] established this now who is the tree he
[56:39] didn't say what but he says who is the
[56:41] tree of knowledge in Good and Evil and I
[56:43] said well that can only be one there can
[56:46] only be one that's what Satan absolutely
[56:48] that's right and we know that is Satan
[56:50] now let's look at the the the uh let's
[56:52] look at the the similarities here in the
[56:54] scripture let's let's go to Genesis 3
[56:55] back to Genesis 3 here where the
[56:57] original sin took
[57:00] place praise God Genesis 3 Verse 6 amen
[57:07] now the woman had started talking to
[57:09] this
[57:10] creature but notice the effect it had on
[57:13] the woman he says and the woman Genesis
[57:16] 3 and6 he says and when the woman saw
[57:18] the tree was good for food and that it
[57:21] was pleasant to the eyes it was
[57:22] beautiful right he says and a tree to
[57:24] desire to make one wise notice in this
[57:28] tree she found wisdom and Beauty right
[57:33] now brought out through the message of
[57:34] the hour this brother and I was brought
[57:36] up in this way he showed me he said
[57:38] brother he says now keep that in mind he
[57:40] says we're looking at wisdom and Beauty
[57:42] look at look at the characteristics look
[57:44] at that right and he takes me of course
[57:46] to Ezekiel 28 absolutely he says let's
[57:48] turn to Ezekiel 28 amen praise the Lord
[57:51] sure amen and now we had another mind
[57:55] blow as I'm sitting here through this
[57:57] study at two or three or one o'clock in
[57:59] the morning whatever this was I know it
[58:01] was late yeah and he starts reading this
[58:05] here Ezekiel
[58:08] 28:1 and the moreover the word of the
[58:10] Lord came unto me saying son of man take
[58:13] up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus
[58:15] and he said look he says he's talking to
[58:17] the king absolutely and I'm think okay
[58:20] and he said to me thus sayith the Lord
[58:22] God thou seal us the sum full of wisdom
[58:27] right he says and perfect in Beauty he
[58:29] says look he says the tree of knowledge
[58:31] G evil and I'm thinking the king of
[58:33] Tyrus man this has to be a couple at
[58:36] least a couple thousand years after Adam
[58:38] and Eve I'm pretty sure if I could trace
[58:39] this thing back if you run the
[58:41] archaeology back I'm sure it's a couple
[58:42] thousand but now look what he says he
[58:45] says Thou Hast been in Eden the Garden
[58:49] of God Amen and I'm reading this for the
[58:52] first time and I'm thinking my goodness
[58:55] he
[58:56] was it's the word the king of Tyrus was
[58:59] there my what a
[59:01] king no wonder he's a king he's had
[59:04] 3,000 years to get there he's G outlive
[59:06] everybody even the other king whoever
[59:08] was now so he looking he's bringing this
[59:11] he says thou has been in Eden the Garden
[59:12] of go every precious stone was thy
[59:15] covering he the Sardis the topaz the
[59:17] diamond the bur onx The Jasper uh uh
[59:20] the sapphire he says the emerald the
[59:22] carok and gold he say workmanship of th
[59:24] TS look he says Not only was this King
[59:26] that he says but he says the workmanship
[59:29] of thy tabberts and thy pipes was
[59:31] prepared in thee the day that I was C
[59:32] look he was the song leader in heaven
[59:34] also he was the song leader then he
[59:37] brings this verse 14 and reveals it he
[59:39] says he says Thou Art the anointed
[59:42] cherub he said brother look the prophet
[59:45] catches the inspiration of God and he
[59:48] goes up to the king and says thus sayith
[59:51] the Lord he says what took place here he
[59:53] says Satan himself the spirit has
[59:55] incarnated himself into the
[59:58] king and now by the wisdom of God the
[1:00:02] discernment of God through the prophet
[1:00:04] comes up and discerns who is in this man
[1:00:07] notice he says notice he says the two
[1:00:10] characteristics wisdom and Beauty amen
[1:00:13] beautiful same tree Satan himself and
[1:00:17] he's just a cherub that's it right
[1:00:21] absolutely he says Thou Art the anointed
[1:00:23] cherub what proving that Satan was in
[1:00:26] the Garden of Eden right then it placed
[1:00:28] him specifically there in time and in
[1:00:31] scripture absolutely he says and thou
[1:00:34] verse 15 he says thou has perfect in thy
[1:00:36] ways from the day thou was created till
[1:00:38] iniquity is found in thee he says now he
[1:00:40] says uh um verse 17 he says thine heart
[1:00:44] was lifted up because of thy Beauty
[1:00:48] notice the fall what caused the fall
[1:00:50] here Pride because he was beautiful
[1:00:53] absolutely that's right and and that's
[1:00:54] why the systems of this day everything
[1:00:57] is looking for beauty absolutely that's
[1:00:59] right absolutely absolutely we'll get
[1:01:01] through that in a little bit he says
[1:01:02] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:01:03] Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[1:01:06] the reason of thy brightness because of
[1:01:08] beauty because he thought so much of a
[1:01:10] some his wisness his wisdom went off the
[1:01:13] beaten path it went from the straight to
[1:01:15] narrow the way which is Christ and took
[1:01:17] his own way absolutely he says he says
[1:01:20] therefore he says he says and by the
[1:01:22] iniquity of thy traffic absolutely there
[1:01:24] amen now so he brings this to me and he
[1:01:28] shows me look he says this tree of
[1:01:29] knowledge good and evil is Satan
[1:01:31] scripturally here it places him
[1:01:33] absolutely that he was there he was the
[1:01:35] one that caused the fall I was like oh
[1:01:37] my amen oh my I was like Amen brother
[1:01:40] praise God absolutely wonderful then he
[1:01:43] said now let's continue on here and
[1:01:45] we'll see where he went to to do this
[1:01:48] Isaiah 14 we all know this Isaiah 14
[1:01:52] verse 12 and notice another under
[1:01:55] another Prophet inspiration comes from
[1:01:58] God discernment straight from the throne
[1:01:59] comes out yes and he calls out this man
[1:02:03] who is is let's
[1:02:05] see
[1:02:07] uh maybe it's just a prophecy he says
[1:02:11] verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven
[1:02:13] oh Lucifer son of the morning how art
[1:02:16] thou cut down to the ground look yes he
[1:02:19] was that tree he was cut down to the
[1:02:21] ground absolutely that's right he has no
[1:02:23] power he's not standing on anything
[1:02:24] anymore absolutely he's
[1:02:26] on sinking sand absolutely he says Thou
[1:02:29] are cut down to the ground which did
[1:02:31] weaken us the Nations he says for thou
[1:02:33] has said in thine heart he says I will
[1:02:35] Ascend into heaven he says I will exalt
[1:02:37] my throne above the stars of God why is
[1:02:39] everything I I I in this age iPhone iPad
[1:02:42] I do uh I everything I this I that I
[1:02:45] whatever absolutely he even even certain
[1:02:48] groups have symbols that are the ey hold
[1:02:50] on he says I will sit upon the Mount of
[1:02:52] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:02:56] north absolutely now this brother later
[1:02:59] on a master master teacher came in he
[1:03:02] said he said let let's examine this he
[1:03:04] says he says look he says the sides of
[1:03:06] the north absolutely and he went to the
[1:03:08] Hebrew now a lot of the ordinances of
[1:03:10] this day have been they've switched the
[1:03:12] meetings over yeah but if you go get an
[1:03:15] old coordinance maybe at a Salvation
[1:03:18] Army or somewhere where you can get an
[1:03:19] old one maybe the internet or whatever
[1:03:21] uh Amazon or or um what's the other eBay
[1:03:25] he says you get an old one and you can
[1:03:27] take these words back sides that word
[1:03:29] sides in the Hebrew three 3411 uh 3409
[1:03:35] the extreme feminine sides the extreme
[1:03:39] feminine extreme Parts the thighs loins
[1:03:43] as the seed of procreation
[1:03:45] power he's going to the woman yeah how
[1:03:50] is he going to exalt himself how is he
[1:03:52] going to bring what uh uh I like like
[1:03:54] this his children down uh
[1:03:59] um that word North and the Greek I me
[1:04:02] sorry in the Hebrew
[1:04:05] 6828 to 6845 it's the hidden places so
[1:04:10] he's going to the feminine he's going to
[1:04:12] the seed of procreation power that's how
[1:04:14] he's going to accomplish his entire
[1:04:16] thing that's how he's going to be
[1:04:17] worshiped that's how he's going to exalt
[1:04:18] his throne because to exalt your throne
[1:04:20] you have to have somebody underneath you
[1:04:21] to worship you absolutely so in seed of
[1:04:24] God will not worship the devil knowing
[1:04:26] it absolutely maybe deceived AB but
[1:04:27] knowing it absolutely not so he has to
[1:04:29] form his own people I say it we say like
[1:04:32] that absolutely we will make it plain
[1:04:33] here soon absolutely so here he went to
[1:04:35] the sides of the north absolutely verse
[1:04:37] 14 he I'll send above the heights of the
[1:04:39] clouds I will be most like he I will be
[1:04:41] like the most high yet Christ says yet
[1:04:43] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to
[1:04:45] the sides of the pit absolutely that's
[1:04:48] right now in verse 19 but thou are cast
[1:04:51] out of thy grave like an abominable
[1:04:53] Branch one once again typing Satan as a
[1:04:55] tree absolutely that's right all the way
[1:04:58] through real really simple absolutely M
[1:05:00] that's right the word of God interprets
[1:05:02] itself absolutely now so here we see
[1:05:05] Satan is the the the tree of knowledge
[1:05:08] in Good and Evil now what would be the
[1:05:10] fruit on Satan we went through the fruit
[1:05:12] the fruits of the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:05:14] kindness love peace all these things
[1:05:15] right now so what is the fruit let's go
[1:05:17] to Proverbs Proverbs
[1:05:23] one
[1:05:25] Proverbs 1
[1:05:29] verse 28 then shall they call upon me
[1:05:32] but I will not answer they shall seek me
[1:05:34] early but they shall not find me my for
[1:05:37] they for that they hated knowledge they
[1:05:40] hated knowledge they wouldn't hear it
[1:05:43] and did not choose the fear of the Lord
[1:05:45] that they would none of my counsel they
[1:05:47] despised all my
[1:05:50] reproof therefore shall they eat the
[1:05:52] fruit of Their Own way amen absolutely
[1:05:55] so what is the fruit of this tree is
[1:05:57] Going Your Own Way doing your own thing
[1:06:00] taking a thought on the word of God and
[1:06:01] just going any way you want absolutely
[1:06:03] living your life any kind of way

[1:06:07] knowledge and good and evil that's one
[1:06:08] of the fruits of it absolutely he says

[1:06:58] the greatest book ever written it's a
[1:07:00] mystery book amen Hosea

[1:09:50] 20 verse one and I saw an angel come
[1:09:53] down from from Heaven having the key of
[1:09:55] the bottomless pit and a great chain in
[1:09:57] his hand he laid hold on the dragon he
[1:09:59] says look he says that old serpent which
[1:10:02] is the devil and Satan and bound him a
[1:10:05] thousand years so here in the scripture
[1:10:07] here at the very end it calls him what
[1:10:09] that old serpent when we mean when it is
[1:10:12] old it means ancient or or or or even
[1:10:15] from the beginning absolutely that's
[1:10:17] right so let's go back there and now we
[1:10:19] we know the Trees of Life the Trees of n
[1:10:21] Gena we know the fruits that lie on them
[1:10:23] but now we need to look at the vehicle
[1:10:26] right that Satan used yes and here when
[1:10:29] I was the Lord sent me out to the
[1:10:31] mountains and the White Mountains there
[1:10:32] and I climbed those and I I was out
[1:10:34] there for three days God arranged
[1:10:37] orchestrated the entire thing set me up
[1:10:39] to witness to one man in a in a
[1:10:42] barn at the end of three days I find
[1:10:44] myself in the upper room of a barn I had
[1:10:47] no idea what was doing I just wet with
[1:10:49] thus say the Lord I believe now I know
[1:10:50] it is but and I was witnessing to him
[1:10:52] and I hit him up with sin here and I

[1:10:56] missing
[1:10:57] link why can't they find it scientists
[1:10:59] so intelligent man they've got
[1:11:01] excavators that can pull tons and tons
[1:11:02] of dirt at a time they cannot find it

[1:11:06] links man with animal uh even animal
[1:11:09] different kinds of animals they can't
[1:11:10] find any links them why can't they find
[1:11:13] it and I said because God changed it and
[1:11:14] he saids hold on I gotta go to bathroom

[1:11:33] yeah he goes they're watching something
[1:11:35] on the original or he said they're
[1:11:36] watching something on the missing link I
[1:11:39] said I told you I'm telling you the
[1:11:40] truth wow praise God praise God God
[1:11:44] always leaves a witness Saints
[1:11:46] absolutely right then I said I'm in the
[1:11:49] world of the
[1:11:50] Lord that's right what I'm speaking is
[1:11:52] truth cuz God just backed it up through
[1:11:54] carnal absolutely right praise be to God
[1:11:57] absolutely now in Genesis 3
[1:12:00] ver1 we're going to find ourselves in
[1:12:02] the Garden of Eden pre
[1:12:04] fall we know the two trees are here and
[1:12:07] they're bearing their fruit yes now what
[1:12:09] takes place here
[1:12:12] my my friend Eric if you're with me
[1:12:14] buddy hang in
[1:12:16] there verse one he says now the serpent
[1:12:20] was more subtle than any of the beast of
[1:12:23] the field which the Lord God had made
[1:12:25] right right
[1:12:29] now remember on the sixth day animals
[1:12:33] were not blessed no right but in the
[1:12:36] sixth day later on in creation God
[1:12:38] creates Us in spirit form and he blessed
[1:12:41] us but here this animal here is not
[1:12:43] blessed he's not a it calls him a
[1:12:45] serpent a beast he was not a fish or a
[1:12:48] whale coming out of the water and he was
[1:12:50] not an eagle that fly down and talk to
[1:12:52] him but he was a serpent a beast and not
[1:12:55] and something very very special about
[1:12:58] this
[1:12:59] Beast now the serent was more subtle
[1:13:02] that word subtle means subtle crafty Sly
[1:13:05] Artful manlike right absolutely he says
[1:13:09] then any of the beasts what he was a
[1:13:11] natural animal right
[1:13:14] think animal right a real you got your
[1:13:19] picture of your dog you got your picture
[1:13:20] of your horse this was in God's eyes no
[1:13:25] difference
[1:13:27] right right remember I'm teaching you
[1:13:29] for the first time you've ever heard
[1:13:31] this he says of the field which the Lord
[1:13:33] God had made now look at what this
[1:13:35] animal can do he says and he said unto
[1:13:38] the woman this Beast can talk right he
[1:13:42] can speak he has a vocal cords he has a
[1:13:45] mouth and a tongue and a teeth like ours
[1:13:47] they can form
[1:13:49] words he can form the spoken word he can
[1:13:54] reiterate the spoken
[1:13:57] word my and he knows how to strike up a
[1:14:00] conversation he says ye shall shall we
[1:14:03] eat of every tree of the garden any
[1:14:06] nowhere to go to remember if Satan has
[1:14:09] incarnated this beast and he said I'm
[1:14:11] going to the sides of the north look
[1:14:13] he's at the sides of the north right now
[1:14:16] that's right he says you shall eat of
[1:14:19] every tree of the garden and notice the
[1:14:21] woman was not startled uh was not Star
[1:14:25] Struck was not kind of uh and Eve
[1:14:27] shuddered or Eve was like oh get away
[1:14:29] from me you it was just like a regular
[1:14:32] old
[1:14:33] conversation like we're picking up maybe
[1:14:35] at the end of their conversation uh just
[1:14:38] getting a little spiritual let's move
[1:14:39] into the word brother sister absolutely
[1:14:41] amen he says he says and the woman said
[1:14:43] to the serpent we may eat of the Trees
[1:14:45] of the field of the garden he says but
[1:14:47] of the fruit which of the tree which is
[1:14:48] in the midst of the garden God has said
[1:14:50] ye shall not eat it lest she touch it uh
[1:14:52] lest she died right and the servant said
[1:14:55] the woman ye shall not surely die what
[1:14:57] the first SL we know these things right
[1:14:58] absolutely so here she is talking with
[1:15:00] an animal a brute Beast a beast named
[1:15:04] what a serpent at this time he was not
[1:15:07] as what you would think a snake that
[1:15:09] goes on the ground absolutely he says or
[1:15:11] one that could shed his skin and had no
[1:15:13] legs and no arms but this was thing was
[1:15:15] upright and a spoke like a man it
[1:15:17] sounded like a man and they knew the
[1:15:19] word of God absolutely it's right where
[1:15:21] did he get this knowledge because if you
[1:15:23] to Genesis 2 you only see God talking to
[1:15:26] Adam yeah right where did he get this
[1:15:29] knowledge the tree of nil must have been
[1:15:32] near or within vocal range of the Tree
[1:15:36] of Life speaking with uh another Tree of
[1:15:39] Life Adam he says and he must have
[1:15:40] overheard and knew the word of God and
[1:15:42] he said okay now I know he was a little
[1:15:45] secret agent maybe and that invisible
[1:15:47] tree went and what and now we see him go
[1:15:49] and incarnate himself into an animal
[1:15:53] amen now remember we know Satan is full
[1:15:57] of
[1:15:58] wisdom in his mind whether he I don't
[1:16:01] know he's a spiritual being he cannot
[1:16:03] with any of us without the Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] right without the Holy Ghost we're
[1:16:07] powerless
[1:16:08] with we're finite absolutely and somehow
[1:16:12] he figured this
[1:16:14] out that he needed to get hold of the
[1:16:16] serpent he did not bring a horse he did
[1:16:18] not bring my little puppy dog that's
[1:16:20] right he did not bring a chicken or or
[1:16:22] something else any other creature but he
[1:16:24] specifically brought because what it
[1:16:27] could communicate right and there was
[1:16:29] something else about it absolutely
[1:16:33] now verse six of Genesis 3 and when the
[1:16:36] woman saw the tree was good for food and
[1:16:38] that it was pleasantly eyes and a tree
[1:16:40] desired to make one wise she took of the
[1:16:41] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[1:16:43] to her husband with her and she did it
[1:16:44] not eat now look they took they took
[1:16:47] what she believed the
[1:16:49] lies oh this and that whatever she
[1:16:52] believed the lies and we know through
[1:16:53] what the scripture here in verse 13
[1:16:55] Genesis 3: 13 and the Lord God said unto
[1:16:58] the woman what is it thou Hast done and
[1:17:00] the woman said the serpent beguiled me
[1:17:03] and I did eat that word beguiled in the
[1:17:06] Hebrew means to seduce utterly
[1:17:09] morally that's right so what took place
[1:17:12] s god let's just make it plain there was
[1:17:14] a absolute a seduction a seducing that
[1:17:17] took place in the Garden of Eden Brother
[1:17:20] s that's pretty crazy that's crazy talk
[1:17:23] let's go see now verse seven and the
[1:17:25] eyes of both them were opened and he
[1:17:27] knew that they were naked they sewed fig
[1:17:28] leaves together and made themselves
[1:17:29] aprons right now they've sinned right
[1:17:32] they've taken they they've sinned
[1:17:33] they've Fallen absolutely now and look
[1:17:36] he says and they show they they sowed
[1:17:39] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:17:41] aprons because they realized they were
[1:17:43] naked brother sister tonight uh uh those
[1:17:46] watching however wherever he says you
[1:17:48] are clothed with clothing absolutely
[1:17:51] covering what the part that had sinned
[1:17:54] absolutely how come they did not make
[1:17:56] little mouth coverings why but it said
[1:17:59] they wrapped themselves around because
[1:18:00] they were naked they realized they used
[1:18:02] the parts that were used uh to sin they
[1:18:05] covered those because they were totally
[1:18:08] defiled now absolutely it was what a
[1:18:11] seduction absolutely now yes and we know
[1:18:15] these things right and now the Judgment
[1:18:16] hit now here's where the danger comes
[1:18:18] with this this is why the preacher the
[1:18:20] guy behind this thing right here this
[1:18:22] guy right here guy right here and I
[1:18:23] heard this brother right here are in the
[1:18:25] most dangerous positions in the world
[1:18:28] the levels of hell right civil and then
[1:18:32] what ecclesiastical the lowest the
[1:18:34] lowest of the lows of in hell will be
[1:18:36] what false

[1:19:10] do this well this person did that and
[1:19:13] then in judgment will go to that person
[1:19:14] will say Eve why did you eat of this
[1:19:16] tree and then you'll
[1:19:19] say it was the servant and now what the
[1:19:22] false priest prach is on the Judgment
[1:19:24] circuit absolutely the righteous the
[1:19:28] righteous will be Scot free absolutely

[1:20:02] said un the serpent because thou has de
[1:20:04] us Thou Art cursed above all cattle
[1:20:06] that's why in the sixth day God never
[1:20:09] blessed any of them because he knew by
[1:20:12] for knowledge the curse would have to
[1:20:13] fall on this absolutely it could not
[1:20:17] bless it why would then that also too
[1:20:20] why would the sacrifices be animals
[1:20:21] animals animals couldn't bless it they'd

[1:22:21] ever met in my entire life life is one
[1:22:23] or the other yes yes that's true and I'm
[1:22:27] sitting there and I'm going through this
[1:22:32] study and I'm thinking God be kidding
[1:22:37] me the most Sublime moment in my life
[1:22:41] was after this study Saints
[1:22:44] yeah amen it's still affects me today
[1:22:47] yeah because we this is not this is not
[1:22:50] a this is not a Mormon thing okay where
[1:22:51] we just kind of hope that the seven or
[1:22:53] you know the nine plates are whatever
[1:22:55] this ain't a job's witness thing what
[1:22:57] but this is reality amen amen this is
[1:23:00] inspired word of God 66 books and we're
[1:23:03] bringing a Doctrine and we can bring
[1:23:05] this thing from Genesis to Revelations
[1:23:06] it's realen and not only that but it was
[1:23:09] been hidden yes for 2,000 years Saints
[1:23:12] AB yes no other people before us
[1:23:16] Einstein never got a chance to hear this
[1:23:18] that's right that great
[1:23:20] man Tindale never got hear this John hus
[1:23:23] never got to hear thisen Luther
[1:23:28] Wesley and we get to hear
[1:23:32] this the great
[1:23:35] ones right six of the seven Messengers
[1:23:40] to the church ages never heard this
[1:23:43] oh and there I'm sitting in
[1:23:46] 2001 hearing
[1:23:50] it I'll put enity between thy seed and
[1:23:53] her seed the serpent had
[1:23:56] Seed where planted in her
[1:24:00] right animal and a daughter of God came
[1:24:04] together right and now something's going
[1:24:08] to come forth that's never been there it
[1:24:10] was not in the original
[1:24:12] creation right we know we know in
[1:24:16] nature the female is more beautiful than
[1:24:19] the male that's right
[1:24:25] I'm sorry the male is more beautiful
[1:24:27] than the female
[1:24:28] nature so the serpent is the male of the
[1:24:31] species the most beautiful of the
[1:24:33] serpent probably the highest one best
[1:24:36] one serpent you could find sure goes
[1:24:38] incarnates and finds the most beautiful
[1:24:40] in the human race because in the human
[1:24:42] race God did it backwards right the
[1:24:44] man's not as beautiful as the female
[1:24:47] right the female holds the beauty and
[1:24:49] now Look Beauty and beauty
[1:24:53] not Beauty and semi Beauty no Beauty and
[1:24:55] Beauty Satan's he sees he sees a match
[1:24:59] wowow my goodness
[1:25:01] absolutely right he says and it shall
[1:25:03] bruise thy head and thou sh bruise it
[1:25:05] shall bruise thy heel AB the type of
[1:25:07] Christ right so here we see the serpent
[1:25:09] has seed right now as he moves from
[1:25:12] there he curses and now that serpent is
[1:25:14] cursed right but remember that is an
[1:25:17] animal it did not have a
[1:25:20] soul right right yes good that's true if
[1:25:24] when we judge all those remember what is
[1:25:27] the first first one we'll judge or how I
[1:25:29] mean as far as back in time it'll be
[1:25:31] Cain this serpent will not be there
[1:25:34] because when these two seeds
[1:25:36] mingled now the the serpent seed
[1:25:40] actually come and he had a place for a
[1:25:43] soul something within the genetics
[1:25:45] carried it absolutely now he has a place
[1:25:48] in his soul where he could actually
[1:25:49] receive God right
[1:25:52] absolutely now in verse 16 now look at
[1:25:55] this if this was not an adulterous
[1:25:57] Affair why would God judge her not curse
[1:26:00] her but judge her according to this way
[1:26:03] he says unto the woman he said I will
[1:26:05] greatly multiply thy sorrow in and thy
[1:26:08] conception notice reproduction what the
[1:26:11] size of the north absolutely he says and
[1:26:14] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[1:26:16] children why is it reproduction why is
[1:26:18] it this area why is it that right he
[1:26:21] says and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:26:23] husband because in the beginning it
[1:26:25] wasn't it was to another
[1:26:27] man she eateth and said I've done no
[1:26:30] wickedness she didn't Adams he's a nice
[1:26:33] guy yeah I came out of him but this
[1:26:36] guy's really goodlooking and that guy's
[1:26:38] really tall and he's Ultra smart he
[1:26:40] taught me things I didn't know before
[1:26:43] right he says and thy husband shall rule
[1:26:46] over her and that's her judgment pain
[1:26:50] absolutely we know these things and Adam
[1:26:51] said because thou was hearkened now he's
[1:26:53] dealing with Adam he says which I
[1:26:55] commanded thee he says Thou shalt not
[1:26:56] eat of it curse it as the ground for thy
[1:26:58] sake and sorrow thou sh eat it he say
[1:27:00] now he's got to work for his food
[1:27:01] absolutely now if you remember I don't
[1:27:04] think this family was here but I had
[1:27:07] taught a couple months ago on Matthew 13
[1:27:10] and I brought Matthew 13 and showed you
[1:27:12] this all the way through Genesis 1 2 and
[1:27:15] 3 even up to Enoch's day and we ran the
[1:27:18] church ages all the way through this and
[1:27:20] showed you the ground was the ground of
[1:27:23] the heart amen but go back and get the
[1:27:26] taper I don't know got any now let's
[1:27:29] continue on here now we see so we see
[1:27:31] now notice these are two he says there
[1:27:33] there he says I will put between thy
[1:27:35] seed and her seed absolutely he says now
[1:27:38] in chapter four where is this now here's
[1:27:41] where people have a problem see look he
[1:27:42] says well Adam knew his wife right here
[1:27:44] list that this is actually because
[1:27:45] remember Moses was the one writing this
[1:27:47] he was the one that God used to rewrite
[1:27:49] the first five books of the Bible and
[1:27:51] Moses had to have seen us either through
[1:27:53] vision or through uh orally handing it
[1:27:55] down through the saints of God from
[1:27:57] Abraham all the way down or whatever but
[1:27:58] it's probably more a vision because we
[1:28:00] see it it's aable
[1:28:02] form it's symbolic and what two books of
[1:28:05] the Bible that Satan hate the most what
[1:28:07] Genesis and Revelation all Revelations
[1:28:08] are symbolic the entire thing is
[1:28:11] symbolism absolutely and then here in
[1:28:13] chapter three symbolism we find also as
[1:28:15] well absolutely hiding the truth
[1:28:17] absolutely has been covered now yes he
[1:28:19] says and Adam knew his wife when was
[1:28:22] this this was Genesis 3:6 when Adam knew
[1:28:26] his wife he says and she conceived and
[1:28:29] bear can and said I have gotten a man
[1:28:31] from Adam no he says she says what from
[1:28:33] the Lord amen she would not account this
[1:28:35] to Adam he says and she again bear his
[1:28:38] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of
[1:28:39] sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[1:28:41] ground absolutely that's right so we see
[1:28:43] the two seed lines
[1:28:46] now entwined with one another absolutely
[1:28:48] now growing up together absolutely uh
[1:28:51] talking with another fellow shipping and
[1:28:52] we knew and deep down each one knows
[1:28:54] there's something different about the
[1:28:55] other one absolutely that's right that's
[1:28:57] right now amen now we'll see we still
[1:29:00] have not we found something that was
[1:29:01] cursed but we need to find something
[1:29:02] that will be cursed in what Matthew 25
[1:29:05] right he says we know Cain and Abel
[1:29:06] right and the Bible says in the process
[1:29:08] of time right he said the brother they
[1:29:10] were both worshippers right now look at
[1:29:13] this in verse 24 and he drove out the
[1:29:15] man and and he placed at the East notice
[1:29:19] how he said about the East we'll do a
[1:29:21] study on may he said at the east of the
[1:29:24] Garden of Eden cherub him every flaming
[1:29:26] sword and turned every way to keep the
[1:29:27] Tree of Life a prophet said he said he
[1:29:30] says when these two brothers went up to
[1:29:31] worship he says they built their altars
[1:29:33] at the East
[1:29:35] Gate what looking for the trying to get
[1:29:37] a p a peas with the Tree of Life
[1:29:39] absolutely that's right and we'll maybe
[1:29:42] explain that later so now here they're
[1:29:44] at the East Gate here and they brought
[1:29:47] forth their sacrifices we know right uh
[1:29:50] one was the fruit of the ground
[1:29:52] absolutely and the other one was what a
[1:29:54] bleeding lamb absolutely that's right
[1:29:56] yes now one was rejected the other one
[1:29:58] was accepted absolutely uh
[1:30:02] Cain then we know slew his brother right
[1:30:06] absolutely verse eight and Cain talked
[1:30:09] with Abel his brother and it came to
[1:30:10] pass as they were in the field that Cain
[1:30:12] rose up against Abel his brother and
[1:30:14] slew him right and the Lord said to Cain
[1:30:16] where is Abel th brother he said I said
[1:30:17] I know not am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:30:19] absolutely and We Know by the word of
[1:30:21] God yes we are our brothers and sisters
[1:30:24] keep bre that's not a true question he
[1:30:27] says now he says and he said why H has
[1:30:29] thou done the voice of thy brother's
[1:30:32] blood crith unto me from the ground he
[1:30:34] says and now thou are cursed here we go
[1:30:39] this must be the start of those that
[1:30:43] must be the start of that sea line that
[1:30:44] we identified in Matthew 25 the ones
[1:30:47] that are on the left side that are
[1:30:48] cursed and says go into Everlasting
[1:30:50] damnation or hover absolutely they do
[1:30:52] not receive eternal life
[1:30:54] absolutely this is the start of it I
[1:30:57] know this is fresh for you
[1:31:00] guys right now that's where it all
[1:31:03] started amen he says he says and now
[1:31:07] Thou Art curse from the earth and open
[1:31:09] and which has opened her mouth to
[1:31:11] receive thy brother's blood from thy
[1:31:12] hand he says when thou TST the ground it
[1:31:13] shall H forth yield uh uh yield under
[1:31:16] her strength we went through that in
[1:31:17] Matthew 13 a while back when we taught
[1:31:19] that now and of course we know this
[1:31:22] right he says verse 15 and the Lord God
[1:31:24] said to him therefore whosoever slayeth
[1:31:25] Cain uh Vengeance shall be taken on him
[1:31:28] Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon
[1:31:31] Cain and we all know that through the
[1:31:33] teaching of this message that what the
[1:31:35] mark of the beast is still right among
[1:31:37] us and one day soon very soon people on
[1:31:41] the face of the Earth will have will be
[1:31:42] will given a choice and they will have
[1:31:44] to choose to accept the mark Or Not to
[1:31:47] accept the mark right right that Mark of
[1:31:49] the Beast that Mark is still on that
[1:31:52] seed line they will always take it that
[1:31:54] curse is on that seed line it's always
[1:31:56] with them we know in second Peter it
[1:31:58] says he calls them curse children right
[1:32:01] past tense went to right here yes
[1:32:04] because remember whatever God's cursed
[1:32:05] is cursed whatever is blessed is blessed
[1:32:07] you cannot change it it's done in the
[1:32:09] sixth day he did not bless them so what
[1:32:11] he could curse one animal in here
[1:32:14] absolutely bring it to
[1:32:15] judgment
[1:32:19] now let's go to verse 16 and I'll read
[1:32:21] you something here hopefully I won't
[1:32:24] keep you much much longer
[1:32:27] here God thank you Jesus this this study
[1:32:31] takes forever I'm I'm just being
[1:32:34] honest you know absolutely it's just a
[1:32:36] long I mean there's just I'm youing it
[1:32:38] there's I I in my like little Ecom
[1:32:41] medical showdown in
[1:32:43] 2003 five or six pastors there wise 40
[1:32:46] people here this was the topic that was
[1:32:48] the issue me versus the world and what
[1:32:52] the Holy Ghost gave me wisdom shut him
[1:32:54] up we never went any further and we you
[1:32:58] know we'll hit that scripture obv I
[1:32:59] think I've taught that before now now um
[1:33:03] sorry sorry so I know this is right I we
[1:33:06] pretty much defeated every Pastor I came
[1:33:08] up to with this now look what he says
[1:33:10] here
[1:33:12] specifically I know brother Jess want to
[1:33:15] scripture mostly but I want to throw
[1:33:16] this in here
[1:33:18] amen he's dealing in the power
[1:33:21] transformation
[1:33:22] he says now watch the first thing he
[1:33:23] done you tell me when you think you got
[1:33:24] enough CU I'll just stop anywhere he see
[1:33:26] Cain went out of the presence of the
[1:33:27] Lord he says there he made his mistake
[1:33:29] he says then what they'll never go into
[1:33:31] it again he says he says and there is
[1:33:32] where you make you you will make a
[1:33:33] mistake there is where I'll make the
[1:33:35] mistake the very minute we walk out of
[1:33:36] the presence of the Lord and he's
[1:33:38] dealing with this right here this
[1:33:39] scripture and look what he says now look
[1:33:42] at verse 16 and Cain went out from the
[1:33:44] presence of the Lord and dwelt in the
[1:33:45] Land of Nod on the East of Eden
[1:33:49] continually back to the East and we're
[1:33:50] going to do a study someday maybe
[1:33:52] whatever we'll we'll hit it and look
[1:33:54] what the prophet says about that word
[1:33:55] East he says see how religious it was he
[1:33:59] says he went around to the east side
[1:34:02] east
[1:34:04] side yeah why there's something there
[1:34:07] yes and you'll be able to run it yes but
[1:34:10] he said that was a religious
[1:34:12] move God kicked him out of the garden
[1:34:14] right Adam everybody Eve right and he
[1:34:17] placed the angel on the east side of
[1:34:19] that garden with the sword right
[1:34:21] covering with
[1:34:22] and then when C's rejected the marks
[1:34:24] taken and he's
[1:34:25] cursed where is he set up shop on the
[1:34:28] East yes of Eden yes and that's what
[1:34:32] showing what that seed line will forever
[1:34:35] be religious that's right wow wow
[1:34:37] whether they acknowledge Our God or not
[1:34:40] they're gonna find a religion right
[1:34:41] They're Gonna Worship somebody yes oh
[1:34:43] yeah amen it's built in them they could
[1:34:46] he couldn't even help he just moved
[1:34:47] there and that's where he set up shot
[1:34:48] build his first city right absolutely
[1:34:51] now we're not going to hit that okay
[1:34:52] saints of God let's start running here
[1:34:56] um just to let's do about 10 more
[1:34:59] scriptures and we'll call it good we got
[1:35:01] Le got the foundation
[1:35:03] done however and of course we find
[1:35:05] something interesting here um in Genesis
[1:35:08] 6 verse one and it came to pass when men
[1:35:11] began to multiply on the face of the
[1:35:12] Earth the daughters were born unto them
[1:35:15] right he says and the sons of God now in
[1:35:18] modern Bible translations it talks about
[1:35:21] the me Nephilim calls him the sons of
[1:35:24] God the Nephilim that what we know
[1:35:27] through the word the true word of God
[1:35:28] the King James version right it's not
[1:35:31] Nephilim but these are sons of God these
[1:35:32] are not Fallen Angels but these are
[1:35:35] direct descendants of Adam himself
[1:35:38] absolutely right Adam Abel Abel taking
[1:35:41] off the Seth moving on right absolutely
[1:35:43] and now it comes to Noah's day as direct
[1:35:45] Son of God he says and they multiply in
[1:35:48] the face of Earth and the sons of God
[1:35:49] saw the daughters of men notice not the
[1:35:51] daughters of God but the daughters of
[1:35:53] men he says what they taking on what
[1:35:55] Eve's
[1:35:57] nature the beauty outside remember the
[1:36:00] female was the most beautiful not Adam
[1:36:02] Eve and now through the crossing again
[1:36:05] the high breeding that seed line takes
[1:36:07] on Eve's looks looks like the most
[1:36:10] beautiful women's there ever
[1:36:12] was that's
[1:36:15] true well look look
[1:36:18] Noah Eve was the most Beauty through Eve
[1:36:22] right these daughters must be of
[1:36:24] Eve what natural because it wasn't
[1:36:27] pleasant to the
[1:36:29] sight right sure
[1:36:32] sure he says and they chose took them
[1:36:36] wives of all what they chose he say and
[1:36:38] the Lord God my spirit is not always a
[1:36:39] stri with man so so here there's there's
[1:36:41] three major things here the prophet T
[1:36:43] about Noah's day he says three uh red
[1:36:45] light flashings I'm paraphrasing he says
[1:36:47] what the wom in this day will become
[1:36:49] beautiful right right he says uh men
[1:36:51] will become Giants and Tall not here
[1:36:55] he yes absolutely he said and what and
[1:36:58] the imagination intens of the thoughts
[1:36:59] of the hearts were continually evil
[1:37:01] right AB those three major signs this is
[1:37:03] the end times right now so we see
[1:37:05] something here now he says now look at
[1:37:07] verse nine there are the generations of
[1:37:10] it says these are the generations of
[1:37:11] Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in
[1:37:15] his
[1:37:16] Generations all the way from Adam down
[1:37:18] he married within his within the
[1:37:20] daughters of God
[1:37:22] that's right so we know if he was pure
[1:37:25] his sons were pure right pure seed right
[1:37:28] absolutely he said so now we're going
[1:37:30] we're going to the flood how did this we
[1:37:32] know by New Testament scripture even
[1:37:36] after the flood scripture serice he got
[1:37:38] through exactly how did they get through
[1:37:40] now we're dealing with Noah he was
[1:37:42] perfect in his Generations he could say
[1:37:44] he lined it all the way this daughter
[1:37:46] this this wife this this came from Adam
[1:37:47] this look Generations absolutely right
[1:37:50] just like the the old the New Testament
[1:37:52] priest could look and say I'm I'm
[1:37:53] Abraham seed I'm just look absolutely
[1:37:55] right he says so what happened here how
[1:37:58] did the serpent see get in here sermon
[1:38:00] SE 1958 he says now knowing his sons
[1:38:03] which come out hamem and Jeth come out
[1:38:05] in the righteous line he says how did
[1:38:07] the seed ever get over he said the seed
[1:38:09] come over in the ark just like it did in
[1:38:11] the beginning through the woman he says
[1:38:13] they're wives yes wow well I thought I
[1:38:16] thought the life was in the man the
[1:38:20] blood line the blood cell came through
[1:38:23] the man
[1:38:25] right this thing is not what we
[1:38:30] think well if I'm a Son of God of course
[1:38:33] Son of God children of
[1:38:35] God there's something remember we're
[1:38:38] dealing with a natural makeup a natural
[1:38:40] genetic makeup serpent right right and a
[1:38:43] natural man but spiritual right Son of
[1:38:46] God daughter of God somehow in this
[1:38:48] genetics remember the double helix
[1:38:51] a there is something there that can
[1:38:54] cause this that can happen it's proved
[1:38:57] how did it get through the ark remember
[1:38:59] it said Noah was perfect in his
[1:39:01] Generations it never said that about his
[1:39:04] sons that's right because remember the
[1:39:07] sons of God saw the daughters of man for
[1:39:09] they beautiful took
[1:39:10] all right these were Noah's sons also
[1:39:14] did the same
[1:39:15] thing because remember After the flood
[1:39:17] came right Noah would become a Vineyard
[1:39:19] man he started right making making wine
[1:39:22] whe he got drunk whatever and his one
[1:39:24] son saw him naked what he couldn't curse
[1:39:26] that son because he remember he came out
[1:39:28] of Noah and Noah was pure but he had to
[1:39:30] curse his grandson great great grandson
[1:39:33] whatever see he could not curse his son
[1:39:36] because he was pure God already blessed
[1:39:38] it right did he sin sure but he already
[1:39:42] blessed it couldn't curse it by the
[1:39:44] inspiration Noah being what a preacher
[1:39:46] of righteousness maybe a prophet however
[1:39:48] he could not curse that one because he
[1:39:50] was a seat of
[1:39:52] God absolutely yes sir absolutely now SS

[1:45:22] look at this Parable the SE do you have
[1:45:24] any problem with it we read it
[1:45:25] absolutely no problems you got problems
[1:45:26] no no problems we love it okay
[1:45:28] absolutely I said what now let's now
[1:45:30] let's read this here Matthew 13 verse 24
[1:45:32] here's another Parable oh my goodness
[1:45:34] two Parables big ones too these are like
[1:45:36] paragraphs absolutely he says it says
[1:45:38] and another pretty Parable he put forth
[1:45:40] he says the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[1:45:41] unto a man which stowed good seed in his
[1:45:43] field and I'm waiting for something to
[1:45:44] strike nothing but while man slept his
[1:45:47] enemy came and S tears among the weed
[1:45:49] and went his way but when the the blade
[1:45:50] was sprung forth and brought forth tears
[1:45:52] then appeared the tears also so the
[1:45:53] Servants of the household we read these
[1:45:55] things right and I said do you have a
[1:45:57] problem with this Parable they said no
[1:45:59] oh good good neither do I and I said did
[1:46:04] you know these two parables are very
[1:46:06] very special Parables these are the only
[1:46:09] parables in Matthew 13 that God Jesus
[1:46:11] Christ the fullness of the godhead B
[1:46:13] that Inc came into this body he said
[1:46:15] that he gave an interpretation to amen
[1:46:18] oh they said yes yeah I said let's read
[1:46:20] the interpretation of the SE we read it
[1:46:23] do you have a problem with that
[1:46:24] no let's turn the
[1:46:27] page I said do you have a problem now
[1:46:29] let's read this right let's get and I
[1:46:31] read it really really slow and I put
[1:46:34] emphasis on every
[1:46:36] letter and a certain person stood up and
[1:46:38] said you can't read it like that I said
[1:46:40] I'm reading the word of God right I can
[1:46:43] put emphasis on any jot and tit word
[1:46:46] letter whatever it's here and we read
[1:46:49] this verse 36 then Jesus sent the
[1:46:52] multitude away and went into the house
[1:46:54] actually I took him verse 34 and all
[1:46:56] these things spake Jesus and the
[1:46:57] multitude in Parables and without a
[1:46:59] parable speaking out why did he speak
[1:47:01] these in Parables he says verse 35 that
[1:47:04] I be fulfilled which is spoken by the
[1:47:05] prophet saying I will open my mouth in
[1:47:08] Parables he was fulfilling scripture
[1:47:09] prophecy right he says and look what
[1:47:11] he's doing he says I will hutter things
[1:47:14] which have been kept secret from the
[1:47:16] foundations of the world yes yes so
[1:47:20] something in here is being hidden and
[1:47:22] being opened
[1:47:23] up yes some one of these Parables has an
[1:47:26] opening to the foundation of the world
[1:47:28] that has the
[1:47:30] original that Jesus sent the multitudes
[1:47:33] away and he went to the house and his
[1:47:35] disciples came and said unto him declare
[1:47:37] unto us the parable the ter Terrors of
[1:47:38] the field notice that's the only ones
[1:47:40] the inter that the uh that the disciples
[1:47:43] wanted to
[1:47:44] know he says and he said Toto him he
[1:47:46] that Seth The Good Seed is the son of
[1:47:49] man the field is the
[1:47:52] world and these people were starting to
[1:47:54] get really
[1:47:56] quiet oh you believe Jesus's words any
[1:47:59] day here we go you guys got red letters
[1:48:02] I got red letters he says the field is
[1:48:05] the world the good seed are the children
[1:48:09] of the
[1:48:10] Kingdom my he says but the tears are the
[1:48:13] children of the wicked one I said my
[1:48:15] buddy back in the day I said who is that
[1:48:17] Wicked one look verse 39 he says the
[1:48:19] enemy that sld them is the
[1:48:21] devil that's the wicked one right and I
[1:48:25] read this Parable really articulately
[1:48:28] yes and it was total silence this
[1:48:32] brother's been a pastor for 20 years
[1:48:33] that one's 30 this this this their wives
[1:48:35] this and that dealt with who knows what
[1:48:37] as a pastor I don't know what they go
[1:48:38] through I'm sure a lot been through
[1:48:40] seminary schools who knows that LD ddl
[1:48:44] whatever L's right all these L's and M's
[1:48:46] right D's RS whatever phds all this
[1:48:50] stuff they had it all yeah right and you
[1:48:53] know what they said that guy stood up
[1:48:55] said well we're going to we're moving on
[1:48:58] we're we want to talk about something
[1:49:01] else they saw
[1:49:03] it they saw

[1:49:08] that wow I had them the Holy Ghost had
[1:49:12] them amen and on Judgment Day yes yeah a
[1:49:16] judgment day

[1:49:22] people I tried to tell them
[1:49:26] right
[1:49:29] absolutely breaking down a mystery last
[1:49:31] scripture sorry SS Scot last scripture
[1:49:34] let's go to Second
[1:49:49] Peter
[1:49:54] no
[1:50:10] no second Peter 2 verse one I notice
[1:50:15] Peter he says but there were false
[1:50:17] prophets also among the people even as
[1:50:20] there shall be false teachers among you
[1:50:22] who probably shall bring in damnable
[1:50:24] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:50:25] brought them and bring bring uh upon
[1:50:28] themselves Swift destruction right so
[1:50:31] he's dealing with preachers teachers
[1:50:33] prophets men men right then he goes
[1:50:38] through everything they do he types he
[1:50:40] brings it back to types s gorra Noah
[1:50:42] Noah and all these things right and in
[1:50:44] verse 12 he he made something really he
[1:50:46] just says something so spectacular he
[1:50:48] says but these as natur natural brute
[1:50:52] beasts the Bible says all scriptures
[1:50:54] given by the inspiration of the Holy
[1:50:56] Ghost absolutely and since this is in
[1:50:59] within the holy writ or the cannon of
[1:51:00] the scripture this is inspiration of the
[1:51:03] Holy Ghost amen what the spirit of God
[1:51:05] just like it came in Isaiah in Ezekiel
[1:51:07] Isa identifying Satan yes right in them
[1:51:11] right right here Peter the Holy Ghost
[1:51:13] and Peter calls them out in written for
[1:51:16] absolute he says but these As Natural
[1:51:19] beasts mean made made to be taken and
[1:51:22] destroyed I took on some Baptists one
[1:51:24] time they said show me where it says
[1:51:25] they were made that way took them right

[1:51:40] undefeatable UN you can you cannot lose
[1:51:44] because it's
[1:51:46] right says let every man be a liar but
[1:51:48] God's word be true Abol like I tell them

[1:52:00] yes abely yeah I'm just trying to put
[1:52:02] that little juice out there and make
[1:52:04] that truth fruit and I'm I'm there he
[1:52:07] says obviously with all the others too
[1:52:08] he says and they shall receive the
[1:52:11] reward of unrighteousness as they count
[1:52:12] it in pleasure to Riot in the daytime
[1:52:15] spots they are and blemishes sporting
[1:52:17] themselves with their own deceiving

[1:52:37] hope is a
[1:52:38] blessing we haven't even been through
[1:52:40] probably half the scriptures maybe not
[1:52:42] even a third maybe we've been through
[1:52:44] about a third of everything in
[1:52:47] here wordwise as far as
[1:52:50] R S Zed
[1:52:53] absolutely SS of God when you go out
[1:52:55] from here tonight and you wake up
[1:52:57] tomorrow or brother sister whatever you
[1:53:00] stop at a gas station every person you
[1:53:02] see yes comes from one of these two
[1:53:05] lineages that's
[1:53:07] right very very
[1:53:09] sad you know what you know what gives me
[1:53:11] strength a lot of times when somebody
[1:53:13] would offend me or uh someone give me an
[1:53:15] issue or this and that I say Lord this
[1:53:17] guy could be one of them forgive him
[1:53:19] Lord
[1:53:20] Jesus said forgive them Father for they
[1:53:21] know not what they do that's right they
[1:53:23] can't help
[1:53:24] it s of God they're really
[1:53:27] just animals with
[1:53:31] Souls Noah said the Bible says in Noah's
[1:53:35] day there were eight Souls on the ark
[1:53:38] but it was full of
[1:53:39] animals didn't have souls but when the
[1:53:43] mixing the high breeding took place that
[1:53:46] Soul was added to them there's a little
[1:53:47] spot their heart must have formed just
[1:53:49] like the sons of God where the soul is
[1:53:51] put and they had that same thing too now
[1:53:54] and now because remember before they
[1:53:56] were not in the image of God right they
[1:53:58] were just like a natural animal but when
[1:54:00] God said let us make man in our image he
[1:54:01] made him what Spirit Body and Soul right
[1:54:05] but now when they hybrid that Soul
[1:54:07] crossed over a a spot to have the soul
[1:54:10] and a soul was given to each one of
[1:54:11] these and now they're in the image of
[1:54:13] God and now they have to answer for the
[1:54:16] things of God right that's right right
[1:54:19] you look you you are formed just like my
[1:54:21] sons and my daughters how come you did
[1:54:23] not conform to the word of God you are
[1:54:26] in my image yes right good good oh
[1:54:30] my so sad but like we there's no place
[1:54:33] there they cannot they can never stay
[1:54:35] with the word yes I have two goats at
[1:54:38] home I have chickens I have dogs I have
[1:54:41] animals and no matter how train or how
[1:54:45] good I can train a goat to if I could
[1:54:47] dress it up and sit at my table was
[1:54:48] little goofy goat horns right and I
[1:54:51] train it to eat like a man eat like a
[1:54:55] sister right right and even bow ahead
[1:54:58] and pray maybe that goat maybe would do
[1:55:01] that no none of my training will ever be
[1:55:04] able to take out that nature that's
[1:55:06] right none of it no matter how much I
[1:55:09] let that goat watch a a television show
[1:55:12] about nature no matter how much I try to
[1:55:15] indoctrinate them with the true
[1:55:17] indoctrination with the word of God they
[1:55:19] can that nature will always be there
[1:55:23] right and you can't get mad at them
[1:55:25] because they are
[1:55:27] go it's just how it is right it's the
[1:55:31] saddest thing vessels of
[1:55:33] pity Mercy
[1:55:35] Lord anyhow let's uh let's say a word of
[1:55:38] prayer sorry if I held you too long or
[1:55:40] whatever just want to be a blessing

[2:00:52] eternal truth of God it will rejoice
[2:00:54] your heart if you're a child of
[2:00:58] God it's all about what seeds
[2:01:01] inside because the Bible says the Lord
[2:01:04] loveth righteousness yes and his count
[2:01:06] do doth uphold the upright but see
[2:01:09] that's why when you leave the presence
[2:01:11] of God his countenance can't uphold you
[2:01:13] because they leave it but we got to stay
[2:01:15] in the countenance of the Lord the Bible
[2:01:17] said The Way of the Wicked is
[2:01:19] abomination of the Lord he that loveth
[2:01:21] him that fouth but he loveth him that
[2:01:24] fouth after
[2:01:25] righteousness that's why God loves us
[2:01:28] follow his word yes Lord in this the
[2:01:31] children of God are manifest and the
[2:01:32] children of the devil whosoever doeth
[2:01:35] not righteousness is not of God neither
[2:01:38] he that loveth not his brother praise
[2:01:41] God I love what he said there we must
[2:01:43] always be our Brother's Keeper God is
[2:01:45] telling us to be our Brother's Keeper
[2:01:47] right let's treat and was like we said
[2:01:49] sometimes we don't know who it is right

[2:08:49] it's so beautiful how God hides that in
[2:08:51] there it is such a thing of beauty and
[2:08:53] it takes the Holy Spirit to take each
[2:08:55] piece out of that puzzle box and place
[2:08:57] it all together and now you got your
[2:08:59] picture right you don't have a cow on
[2:09:00] top of a tree now you got the cow on the
[2:09:03] ground they got the cow and the tree and
[2:09:05] all kinds of things if they even got a
[2:09:07] cow I don't know what they got but our
[2:09:09] picture is complete because the one who
[2:09:12] wrote the or one who made the puzzle
[2:09:14] then divide up place it back together
[2:09:16] for us we just get to stare and say my
[2:09:18] what a beautiful
[2:09:20] picture that's real artwork right
[2:09:23] there let me close with this in the
[2:09:25] seventh week of Daniel brother R said
[2:09:27] and the seed of the serpent that's the
[2:09:29] killer many people don't believe
[2:09:31] that now why don't they believe that why
[2:09:34] is it the killer oh on because they hate
[2:09:37] the truth they hate to be exposed
[2:09:40] because it exposes them shows what side
[2:09:43] they're on that's why they don't like it
[2:09:44] but us that love it it shows us that
[2:09:47] we're the children of God amen he said
[2:09:49] many people don't believe that but if
[2:09:50] you just read in Genesis the Bible said
[2:09:52] the serpent had a seed so the serpent
[2:09:54] had a seed if the serpent seed was
[2:09:55] spiritual then Jesus was not a man so
[2:09:57] the Serpent's Seed was spir so the
[2:09:59] woman's seed was spiritual they both had
[2:10:01] seeds and the enemity is still there the
[2:10:03] serpent had a seed and if you'll just
[2:10:05] take your Bible and get down and be real
[2:10:07] reverent before God I believe God will
[2:10:09] reveal it to you amen he said of course
[2:10:12] we realize that doesn't save a man
[2:10:14] serpent scene doesn't save a man neither
[2:10:16] does it condemn a man but it only brings
[2:10:19] light upon the subject that we're all
[2:10:21] trying so hard to get the people to see
[2:10:25] it only brings light what are we trying
[2:10:27] to get the people to see that Jesus
[2:10:29] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:10:31] forever and he's opened and finished he
[2:10:33] opened the book and finished all the
[2:10:34] mysteries in this end time that's what
[2:10:36] we're trying to get them to see and they
[2:10:38] can live the whole word believe the
[2:10:40] whole word by what the power of the Holy
[2:10:42] Ghost that's the word of God thank God
[2:10:46] for his Mercy thank you brother
[2:10:47] beautiful message by God's grace realize
[2:10:49] it was the Holy Spirit bringing it out
[2:10:51] but that was beautiful message here
[2:10:52] tonight praise God don't you love the
[2:10:54] Lord a let's bow our heads we dismiss in

[2:11:09] light shines upon these subjects Lord
[2:11:11] God we can see it even more clear Lord
[2:11:14] but it also exposes more sin and more ER
[2:11:17] and for that we're thankful Lord God

[2:11:22] Children of the light walking in the
[2:11:25] light dear God thank you for your mercy
