[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to show 14 signs that we
[0:16] are living in the end times
[0:18] i felt inspired to write down these 14
[0:21] signs while writing my 2021 book
[0:24] and these 14 signs are in chapter 12 of
[0:26] that book
[0:27] in the chapter about the rapture
[0:29] and no doubt there could be more signs
[0:31] of the end times as well this was just a
[0:33] starting spot
[0:34] we'll begin by going through these 14
[0:36] signs of the end times and then i'll
[0:39] discuss which prophecies that we are
[0:41] looking to be fulfilled now before the
[0:43] rapture of the bride of jesus christ
[0:46] based upon the bible and god's prophet
[0:48] brother william branham
[0:50] i'd like to begin these 14 signs by
[0:52] starting with the passage in first
[0:54] thessalonians 5 verses 1 through
[0:57] before i read that remember though that
[0:59] first thessalonians chapter 4 verses 13
[1:02] through 18 detail the rapture as paul
[1:06] told us in the name of the lord that
[1:08] there be a shout voiced trump for the
[1:10] rapture to be fulfilled
[1:12] we believe the shout is going out right
[1:14] now
[1:15] the shout is the same midnight cry jesus
[1:18] parable spoke about in matthew 25 verses
[1:20] 1 through 13.
[1:22] it is the shout to make ourselves ready
[1:24] for the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:27] that shout was given to us through god's
[1:29] prophet brother william marin branham
[1:31] and this shout is currently still going
[1:33] around the world
[1:35] in fact every nation needs to hear the
[1:36] revelation that god gave to brother
[1:38] branham the bible revelations that the
[1:41] mystery of god is finished according to
[1:43] revelation 10 7 and matthew 24
[1:46] verse 14 which says and this gospel of
[1:49] the kingdom shall be preached in all the
[1:51] world for witness unto all nations and
[1:54] then shall the end come
[1:56] so we believe god is using the internet
[1:59] to upspread the shout the message god
[2:01] gave to william branham to all nations
[2:04] but of course he's also sending living
[2:06] preachers missionaries to all nations
[2:09] and we should be praying that god will
[2:11] send these laborers into the harvest
[2:13] so please join me in prayer for god to
[2:16] send more missionaries around the world
[2:18] despite the covet lockdowns god's word
[2:21] will prevail we have to be patient as
[2:23] james chapter 5 says be patient unto the
[2:25] coming of the lord
[2:27] so let's read first thessalonians 5 1-3
[2:30] but as of the times and the seasons
[2:32] brethren you have no need that i write
[2:33] unto you
[2:35] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[2:36] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[2:39] the night for when they shall say peace
[2:41] and safety then sudden destruction
[2:43] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[2:46] with child and they shall not escape so
[2:50] the apostle paul describes the times and
[2:52] seasons of the rapture
[2:54] with these first two descriptions
[2:56] first sinners will be unaware of the
[2:59] rapture just as drunken sleeping robbery
[3:02] victims are caught off guard by a
[3:04] nighttime thief
[3:07] jesus teaches this same idea when he
[3:09] likens the day of the lord as the days
[3:11] of noah in which the lost kept eating
[3:14] drinking and marrying right up until the
[3:17] flood came and took them all away
[3:20] paul compares the sinners to sleeping
[3:21] drunks
[3:23] the second sign is that paul proclaims
[3:26] the world's mantra will be peace and
[3:28] safety at the time of christ's sudden
[3:30] rapture event it's striking to imagine
[3:32] how contrary the thoughts and plans of
[3:35] sinners will be compared to those of god
[3:38] as god is planning for war armageddon
[3:41] and destruction with earth's sinless
[3:44] holy restoration in mind
[3:46] the world is planning in vain for world
[3:49] peace and safety
[3:51] so we believe the end time conditions
[3:53] today that we see around the world all
[3:55] the unrest violence destruction
[3:58] will continue to increase so much so
[4:00] that the world's mantra will be we want
[4:02] peace and safety
[4:04] you may have seen this
[4:06] recently in the news in december 2021
[4:09] the united nations headquarters in new
[4:11] york unveiled a statue they called the
[4:14] guardian for international peace and
[4:16] security
[4:17] of course peace and security should
[4:19] remind us of the mantra of peace and
[4:21] safety
[4:22] this beast was a combination of daniel 7
[4:25] verse 3 and 4 and revelation 3 verse 2
[4:29] it was like a leopard
[4:31] feet as the feet of a bear
[4:33] mouth as the mouth of a lion
[4:35] and had eagle's wings
[4:38] so no doubt this mantra for peace and
[4:40] safety is a cry from the people because
[4:43] of luke 21 verse 26 where jesus said
[4:45] men's hearts will be failing them for
[4:48] fear
[4:49] so because this great spirit of fear is
[4:51] coming upon the earth the people of the
[4:53] earth will be crying out for peace and
[4:55] safety but real christians currently
[4:57] find real peace and safety
[4:59] in the anointing of the holy ghost in
[5:01] their souls
[5:03] a third proof is found in second peter 3
[5:05] verses 3 and 4.
[5:07] scoffers will be mocking jesus's second
[5:10] coming
[5:11] the fourth sign is the conditions of
[5:13] noah's time will be repeated
[5:15] which is violence lust-based marriages
[5:18] and continually evil thoughts according
[5:21] to luke 17 verses 26-30
[5:24] and genesis 6 verses 1-13
[5:27] notice again jesus christ said the
[5:29] conditions of noah's time will repeat at
[5:32] the time of his second coming
[5:34] the fourth sign is that sodomite
[5:36] conditions of lots time will be repeated
[5:40] based upon jesus's own words again in
[5:42] luke 17 verses 28 through 30.
[5:45] and of course this explains the rise of
[5:47] homosexuality transgenderism as a repeat
[5:51] of the sodomite conditions from the days
[5:53] of lot
[5:54] the sixth sign is evil men and deceivers
[5:56] will grow more evil with greater
[5:59] deceptions according to 2 timothy 3
[6:02] verse 1-13
[6:04] false prophets coming in the name of
[6:05] jesus have never been more deceptive
[6:08] and their deceptions will grow closer
[6:11] and closer to being the truth but yet
[6:12] they'll be lies so the true believer
[6:15] will need the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:17] the spirit of god in them to raise up a
[6:19] standard against the flood of deception
[6:22] and false prophecies that satan is
[6:24] pushing upon the people of god but do
[6:27] not fear we will overcome by the grace
[6:29] of god
[6:30] for the holy spirit is here to rightly
[6:32] divide the word of truth as he promised
[6:34] to guide us into all truth by his spirit
[6:38] the seventh sign is that many churches
[6:39] will commit a great falling away from
[6:41] god's truth according to second
[6:43] thessalonians two verse three
[6:45] we're seeing this today especially
[6:47] around the message churches that once
[6:49] recognized the bible truths that god
[6:51] gave to his prophet william branham in
[6:54] order to fall away from the truth you've
[6:56] got to be around the truth you would
[6:58] have had to spend time around the true
[7:00] teachings of the bible and the truest
[7:02] teachings
[7:03] were given by god to brother william
[7:05] branham with thus saith the lord
[7:08] so we can expect more people to fall
[7:10] away as the coming of the lord jesus
[7:12] nears
[7:13] an eighth sign is that few will have
[7:16] genuine faith expressed through regular
[7:18] prayer according to luke 18 verses 1
[7:21] through 8.
[7:22] remember friends jesus said watch and
[7:24] pray for his coming
[7:26] and in this parable jesus asked shall i
[7:28] find faith on the earth when i return
[7:31] in its context it's talking about a
[7:33] prayer life that continually asks seeks
[7:36] and knocks in prayer to god almighty so
[7:39] our prayer lives need to continue daily
[7:42] and we need to keep asking god to
[7:44] fulfill his word and of course he will
[7:46] in his time in season
[7:48] since we're the seed of abraham we'll
[7:50] have faith like abraham will be able to
[7:52] wait 25 years or more for god to bring
[7:55] his promises to
[7:56] pass a ninth sign is that pestilences
[8:00] and earthquakes will increase
[8:02] as sorrows before the tribulation this
[8:05] is found in matthew 24 verses 7 and 8.
[8:08] these scriptures became much more real
[8:10] in the year 2020 as the world became
[8:13] overcome with fear over the coronavirus
[8:16] now of course there have been other
[8:17] viruses before this like the swine flu
[8:19] but the coronavirus was the latest
[8:21] pestilence to hit the earth and for some
[8:23] of us it was the first major pestilence
[8:25] in our lifetime
[8:27] but the coming of the coronavirus and
[8:29] the increase of earthquakes around the
[8:30] world only point us back to the
[8:32] scripture and encourage us that this was
[8:34] already foretold and these are the
[8:36] beginning of sorrows but jesus said he
[8:38] left his peace with us
[8:40] not the peace of the world but the peace
[8:42] of the holy spirit so despite these
[8:45] trials despite these sorrows we can
[8:47] serve god with thanksgiving
[8:49] as philippians 4 says we can make our
[8:51] request known unto god and then the
[8:53] peace that passes all understanding will
[8:55] keep our hearts and minds in christ
[8:57] jesus
[8:58] the tenth sign is that men will be
[9:00] lovers of themselves more than lovers of
[9:02] god and they will be covetous boasters
[9:05] proud
[9:06] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[9:10] unthankful unholy without natural
[9:12] affection truce breakers false accusers
[9:15] incontinent which means having no
[9:17] self-control
[9:18] fierce despisers of those that are good
[9:22] traitors heady
[9:23] high-minded and having a form of
[9:25] godliness but denying the power thereof
[9:28] according to second timothy 3 verses 1-7
[9:32] the 11th sign is that the new testament
[9:34] gospel will have been preached to all
[9:36] the world matthew 24
[9:38] 14.
[9:40] of course we mentioned this earlier but
[9:41] is our duty as holy ghost filled
[9:43] christians to continue to spread the
[9:45] gospel around the world
[9:47] yes we can use the internet but living
[9:49] preachers need to go to all nations and
[9:51] preach the gospel which is a fulfillment
[9:54] of revelation 10 verses 8 through 11
[9:57] where john as a type of the bride eats
[9:59] the book and then prophesies again to
[10:01] peoples multitudes nations and tongues
[10:04] the 12th sign is
[10:06] new laws will stop true churches from
[10:08] preaching
[10:10] through unified efforts of false
[10:12] churches and politicians the us
[10:14] government will adopt new laws to stop
[10:18] true churches from preaching and
[10:19] pressure them to join the evil
[10:21] ecumenical move
[10:23] but jesus will anoint believers with the
[10:25] latter rain and rescue them in the
[10:28] rapture
[10:29] more on this sign a little later the
[10:32] 13th sign is israelis will be physically
[10:34] returning to live in the holy land and
[10:37] seeking to rebuild a new temple
[10:39] according to deuteronomy 30 verses 1
[10:41] through 10 luke 21 24 and revelation 11
[10:45] verses 1 and 2.
[10:47] god's prophet taught us that israel was
[10:49] god's timepiece so that's why we're
[10:52] constantly watching the news about
[10:53] israel to hear about updates regarding
[10:56] her freedoms and also the desire of the
[10:58] faithful remnant to rebuild the temple
[11:01] and the 14th sign is nominal churches
[11:04] will be in a laodicean lukewarm
[11:06] condition concerned with riches and
[11:08] goods and they'll have no need of more
[11:11] truth
[11:12] and unwilling to repent according to
[11:14] revelation 3 verses 15 through 19.
[11:17] so most churches fall under this
[11:19] category because they do not want more
[11:21] truth of the bible
[11:23] most churches are interested more in
[11:25] getting more members and the way to do
[11:27] that is to make the church more worldly
[11:30] and to make sins no longer sins but the
[11:32] bible says it's an abomination to call
[11:35] that which is evil good but most mega
[11:38] churches with famous pastors do exactly
[11:40] that they take something evil like
[11:43] adultery or homosexuality and they say
[11:46] it's okay it's good that god still loves
[11:49] those people even if they won't repent
[11:51] but we know jesus said if you love me
[11:53] keep my commands if you love jesus
[11:55] you'll repent of adultery or repent of
[11:57] being a homosexual and you'll learn to
[11:59] serve jesus in holiness
[12:02] and it's possible through the anointing
[12:03] of his holy spirit
[12:06] what we're looking for now
[12:10] as the rapture nears what are holy
[12:12] ghost-filled christians looking for
[12:14] right now
[12:15] we're looking for all these 14 signs to
[12:17] continue and we know they will but the
[12:19] main one that i watch for and encourage
[12:22] my church to watch for are the signs
[12:24] related to the 12th sign which was the
[12:26] united states government uniting with
[12:28] christian churches in order to change
[12:30] laws friends the reason we emphasize
[12:33] this sign the 12th sign more than others
[12:35] is because because we don't know if the
[12:37] great california earthquake will be
[12:39] before the rapture or after
[12:41] it looks like according to the book of
[12:42] revelation it'll be after the rapture
[12:44] but we don't know for sure
[12:46] also we don't know if the third jewish
[12:48] temple will be built before the rapture
[12:50] or after the rapture we don't know if
[12:52] the seventh vision of the bomb exploding
[12:55] united states will be before the rapture
[12:57] or after the rapture
[12:59] god's prophet told us to watch the
[13:01] purple curtain which is the catholic
[13:03] church
[13:07] that's
[13:09] communism
[13:11] nazism and fascism
[13:16] watch
[13:18] russia but that is not the main one to
[13:21] watch
[13:23] listen god says the lord
[13:29] repent
[13:31] our prejudice
[13:34] in the name of the lord
[13:36] there is one called the iron curtain
[13:38] which will be russia
[13:40] what's red china that'll be the bamboo
[13:42] curtain
[13:44] they're horrible but what's that purple
[13:46] curtain that's rising in the united
[13:48] states and over the world
[13:49] the roman empire
[13:51] the cruelest of all of them remember in
[13:54] the name of the lord
[13:57] get away from it
[13:58] come away from anything that's attached
[14:00] to us
[14:01] please to the rocks
[14:04] although the coming of the lord is at
[14:06] hand
[14:07] we need a confidence
[14:10] i need a conference to talk these things
[14:12] over with god
[14:13] the churches that they're in
[14:21] and the catholic church is greatly
[14:22] influencing every nation but especially
[14:25] the united states for the united states
[14:27] is seen in revelation chapter 13 verses
[14:30] 11 through 18
[14:32] verses 1 through 10 and revelation 13
[14:34] was imperial rome turning into papal
[14:37] rome when imperial rome fell the bible
[14:40] said it was wounded unto death but was
[14:42] given new life in papal rome when
[14:45] constantine united church and state
[14:47] but verses 11 through 18 is papal rome
[14:50] infiltrating the united states
[14:52] government especially since the election
[14:54] of the first catholic president john f
[14:56] kennedy in 1960
[15:01] but based upon these scriptures and
[15:02] quotes we believe it's helpful to watch
[15:05] both israel and the united states
[15:07] lord willing we might see israel god's
[15:10] timepiece
[15:11] begin building their temple before the
[15:13] rapture and then we would know the
[15:14] coming of the two prophets during the
[15:16] great tribulation is very near and of
[15:19] course the squeeze would take place
[15:20] before that
[15:22] also we might see the government of the
[15:24] united states unite with the world
[15:26] council of churches or another church
[15:28] council and begin changing laws to
[15:30] outlaw true holy ghost worship
[15:33] and then again we would know the time of
[15:34] the squeeze is upon us
[15:38] in the church age book brother branham
[15:40] said the temptation will come as follows
[15:42] the ecumenical move that has started on
[15:44] what seems such a beautiful and blessed
[15:46] principle fulfilling christ's prayer
[15:48] that we all might be one becomes so
[15:51] strong politically that she bears
[15:52] pressure upon the government to cause
[15:54] all to join with her either directly or
[15:57] through adherence to principles enacted
[15:59] into law so that no people will be
[16:01] recognized as actual churches unless
[16:03] under direct or indirect domination of
[16:06] this council little groups will lose
[16:08] charters privileges etc until they lose
[16:11] all property and spiritual rights with
[16:13] the people
[16:14] also in the church age book brother
[16:16] branham said i believe according to
[16:17] revelation 13 verse 16 that the bride
[16:20] will have to stop preaching for the
[16:22] beast is demanding the mark in the hand
[16:24] or the forehead of permission to be
[16:26] preached be granted
[16:28] denominations will take the mark or be
[16:30] forced to quit preaching
[16:31] then the lamb will come for his bride
[16:33] and judge the great harlot
[16:35] so putting these two quotes together
[16:37] once the laws change the united states
[16:39] that we know the squeeze time or the
[16:41] time of pressure will come down upon the
[16:42] bride
[16:43] she'll be forced to stop preaching
[16:45] publicly but she'll still have a
[16:47] ministry she'll still be able to
[16:48] minister to people through small private
[16:50] gatherings but not public gatherings and
[16:52] then we believe it's at that time during
[16:54] the squeeze that the prophesied latter
[16:56] reign which is thus saith the lord will
[16:58] fall upon god's true bride
[17:01] and with that anointing the bride will
[17:02] finish the great commission
[17:04] no one knows how long that anointing
[17:06] will last
[17:07] but brother branham makes it seem like
[17:08] god is going to do great supernatural
[17:10] things through his bride during the time
[17:13] of the squeeze
[17:14] as he spoke and looked away to jesus in
[17:16] 1963.
[17:19] so
[17:20] now
[17:22] i am
[17:23] going to say something to you now that i
[17:26] haven't said all along
[17:28] that is
[17:30] the thing that we have looked forward to
[17:32] for so long or at least
[17:35] many years four or five years or maybe
[17:37] longer the third pull
[17:40] has now been vindicated
[17:42] and i'm sure you all know what it is
[17:45] now
[17:46] remember it
[17:47] there'll never be an impersonation of
[17:49] that because it can't be
[17:51] it cannot be
[17:53] now it's inexistent
[17:56] and
[17:58] i have i am warned of this
[18:02] that soon
[18:04] right at this time now it's just
[18:07] happened so it could identify its
[18:10] presence among you
[18:12] see but it will not be used in a great
[18:16] way
[18:17] until
[18:18] this council
[18:20] begins to tighten up
[18:22] and when it does
[18:24] when that does
[18:25] the pentecostals and so forth can almost
[18:28] impersonate anything to be done
[18:30] but when that time comes
[18:32] when the squeeze comes down then you'll
[18:35] see what you've seen temporarily
[18:37] be manifested in the fullness of its
[18:39] power
[18:40] [Applause]
[18:43] it's tightening and then when that time
[18:45] comes and the press comes to a place to
[18:48] where you're pressed out then watch what
[18:50] i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[18:52] watch the third pull down
[18:55] and it'll be absolutely to the total
[18:57] lost but it it will be for the bride in
[19:00] the church
[19:02] and then jesus christ will come to
[19:04] rapture his holy ghost-filled bride off
[19:06] the earth then when the church goes up
[19:09] satan will come down and reveal himself
[19:11] in the antichrist which we believe will
[19:13] be a pope of rome
[19:16] in closing
[19:17] hope this video has been a blessing
[19:19] where you're able to see some of the end
[19:21] times signs that show us we're living in
[19:23] the last days
[19:24] now of course friends there could be
[19:26] more signs this was just a list i made
[19:28] last year when i finished writing my
[19:29] book
[19:30] again our desire should be to fulfill
[19:33] what jesus told us to do watch and pray
[19:35] for a second coming
[19:37] finishing first thessalonians 5 we must
[19:39] watch and pray because we're the
[19:40] children of the day we're not children
[19:43] of the darkness the rapture will not
[19:45] overtake us as a thief we will see it
[19:48] coming because we'll be watching these
[19:50] signs that are clearly taught in the
[19:52] bible and as paul said will have on the
[19:54] full armor of god
[19:56] as he said putting on the breastplate of
[19:58] faith and love and foreign helmet the
[20:00] hope of salvation
[20:02] and i'll leave you with first
[20:03] thessalonians 5 9 for god hath not
[20:05] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[20:08] salvation by our lord jesus christ
[20:11] the true bride of jesus christ will not
[20:13] experience the wrath of the tribulation
[20:15] period may each one of us put on the
[20:17] full armor of god today finish the great
[20:20] commission and watch him pray until
[20:22] jesus comes
[20:25] if you have any questions concerns or
[20:26] testimonies about this video please
[20:28] contact me
[20:31] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[20:33] the desire of your heart
