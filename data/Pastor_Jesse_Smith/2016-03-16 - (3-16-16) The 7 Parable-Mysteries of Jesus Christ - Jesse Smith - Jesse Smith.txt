really good so HDMI he told me one or two he told me all right there number two okay oh there it is Glory all right praise the Lord amen right um like just continue little thought from Sunday like to preach on the seven Parable mysteries of Jesus Christ tonight praise the Lord I never preached on this topic ever so I'm 10 years a pastor and you know it's the first time I preached it but I feel pretty good about it um you I've read through these Parables for years here and found a lot of good quotes this week so I think you'll enjoy the message here tonight praise God let's go to m Matthew Chapter 13 Verse one Matthew 13 verse1 praise God God bless everybody good to see the Saints here tonight by God's grace praise the Lord Matthew 13 verse1 the same day went Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sacked and the whole multitude stood on the shore now you just take a moment think about that they must have stood a long time they must just been standing there a long time so we got it pretty easy right we get to sit all the service they just sit all there on the shore listening to and preach out the boat Jesus would preach anywhere preach on a mountain he preach in a boat he preach in Hell Glory he preach everywhere amen he's a real well he's God Amen the only real preacher there is is Jesus amen so verse three and he spake many things onto them in Parables saying Behold a sword went forth to seow I'm going to skip down to verse 10 down to verse 10 and the disciples came and said to him why speakest thou unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given praise God let's bow our heads for a word of prayer have a need on your heart just make it known unto God trly can pull whatever you have need of out of the gift of God here tonight and I'm trusting God to speak to me as well and speak to all of us let us pray Heavenly Father we love you tonight we thank you for your mercy dear God we thank you for your grace I just pray God you speak to us now Lord that every person here hungering thirsting for righteousness may they be filled Lord may you fill each one of us with more of your spirit more of your power love humility Lord repentance whatever we have need of Joy Mercy longsuffering Temperance as we saw on Sunday Lord with the fruits of the spirit dear God whatever we have need of tonight I pray God you just fill us with that Empower us with that for lord it's only through you we're conquerors Lord and you're the Great Mighty King and you're the mighty conqueror so Lord live in us tonight and speak to us to word in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen God bless you being see that praise the Lord so uh you know I'm going to just review a little bit from Sunday I kind of looked at this I kind of had time on this week you know to kind of look at just some pictures and do a little slides remember Sunday night I did not have a slideshow for you so I tried to work on that this week by the grace of the Lord but uh we saw how the Bible said the mysteries of God were finished amen when that book came down the open book and the and the angel came down the mighty Angel and thundered out seven Thunders the Bible said the mysteries of God were finished praise the Lord so Sunday uh kind of read our text a little bit here Su I just want to review we had 10 or 11 Bible Mysteries the more I think about the more I think it's just 10 but it could be now the reason I think it's 10 is because 10 plus the seven I'm going to preach tonight is 17 and you got a lot of good 17s in the Bible okay you got Revelation 107 there's 10 and the Seven you have the day of atonement on the 10th day the seventh month yes got some good ons there were 17 Nations on the day of Pentecost that received the water baptism in Jesus Christ's name lot of good 17s in the Bible so that's why I lean more towards that because I can't find many 18s so if I miss that pardon me but I believe you know we have 10 or 11 Bible defined Mysteries and if the Bible said the Mysteries would be finished by the seventh angel then the the the the Mysteries God says are mysteries in the Bible should be finished we should understand them yeah and church we'll see tonight every one of these by God's grace the 10 that we went through on Sunday night and the Seven we'll see tonight all of them we understand by the grace of God so are the Mysteries finished or not you tell me yes the Mysteries are finished praise the Lord so number one is the blindness The Mystery of the blindness of Israel and the Gentile dispensation we went over this on Sunday I'm just GNA kind of fly through these These are in Romans chapter 11 by God's grace most you remember that we read that Romans 11 on Sunday night number two is the mystery of the one body of elect Jews and Gentiles that have received Christ the blood of Jesus Christ breaks down the middle P or partition dividing Jews and Gentiles and we're all one body in Jesus Christ those that believe in Jesus Christ are filled with the Holy Ghost we're one body amen glory there's no more dividing praise the Lord number three The Mystery of the New Testament Church as the bride of Christ now the other one is Ephesians 2 and3 on the one body Jews and Gentiles this is uh Ephesians chapter 5 the New Testament church is called The Bride of Jesus Christ and as you study the Bible the bride has to make herself ready for the marriage supper amen that's what we're looking for that's what's going to take place during the tribulation tribulations here on Earth marriage supper going on in heaven amen Number Four The Mystery of the catching away of the New Testament Church which is called The Rapture in our layman terms but the Bible calls it catching away or caught up amen that's another great mystery that's in 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 15 praise the Lord number five the mystery of Christ in The Believer Colossians 1:26 and 27 Christ in you the hope of glory amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's a real important mystery praise God most people are deceived they think you shake a hand you're born again that's because they don't know the mystery church but we know the mystery amen glory that gives us a special relationship with the Lord as we said makes us the bride because we are born again number six the Mist of godliness I believe that's a statue of perect man there's one quote where brother R says Christ is the mystery of godliness and I agree with that because Christ had to come and restore godliness that's I believe that and we'll see that quote tonight but godliness is defined by Peter who says add your faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity so I believe true godliness is restored through the statute of pervert man amen I believe that because that's what Peter said add to this add to that add to that then he said an entrance will be made to you and the kingdom of God glory all right number seven The Mystery of the Seven Stars which are the seven Church AG Messengers amen that's Revelation 1 verse 20 that was a great mystery for those have been revealed to us through the ministry of our Prophet brother Brandon number eight the mystery of God the father and of Christ that's Colossians chapter 2 verse one and two which is the mystery of the godhead Glory we understand that if you don't understand this you're an idolator most in most cases right right unless you're a good Jew and you believe in bism but if not if you're a trinitarian you might not be really know it or understand it but you're an idolator amen because you worship three persons which really has to be three Gods right right because you can't uh it breaks all the Bible scripture it it breaks plain logic but to say God's one person who manifests himself in three ways makes plenty of sense because I'm one person and I'm a father son and a brother that's right I'm also more than that I'm a pastor teacher husband I'm a lot more than that I'm a friend I'm all these things I'm a lot of things but I'm one person so is God Amen God's not three persons God's one person amen now I say the last two for the uh the sinful ones all the previous eight Mysteries are all good Godly Mysteries but these the mysteries of sinfulness so number nine is the mystery of iniquity and that's in second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7 and brother man tells us that's the spirit of the Antichrist that's right remember he tells in the seals there's three there's three phases of that where they work their way you know to the actual man Antichrist uh so we see that by the grace of the Lord I don't remember those right off hand so I'm sorry haven't preached on that lately but I know it it goes from like a saying to a deed to a man or something along that those lines so pardon me but the mystery of iniquity is a mystery of sin okay and number 10 our greatest enemy mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic church right remember that brother B said the voice said watch the king of the north but then he come around and said he said but he also said keep your eye on the purple curtain that's right he kept saying keep your eye on the purple curtain purple curtain so we do that by God's grace all right now I spelled a word wrong again so pardon me in my I spelled Mysteries wrong there sorry I just caught my my typ book so remember we close on Sunday night why are the Mysteries so important to us church because if you have the revelation of the Mysteries it helps you keep all the word let's say for Holy Ghost or the SAT of a man God is if you don't have the revelation of those you're not keeping the word for godliness that's right right or for a real Born Again experience you're breaking the word you're just a justification that M born again and you're not right and you don't have the power to to fulfill the word like you ought to if you're really born again oh my glory amen or if you have faith with no virtue you can't live the daily life and all these things like that you can't keep all the word without the revelations being made know why because the Gates of Hell cannot against Revelation amen yes this is scriptural because our sister wedney read this on Sunday night the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children why that we might do all the words of this law amen and we apply that that that that principle to the New Testament we know the mystery so Jesus said we can live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God glory also the second reason the Mysteries are so important is because the Seed of Abraham are the possessors of Revelation so if you have the revelations it shows you the Seed of Abraham that's what sister Priscilla read for us on Sunday night because God says shall I hide from Abraham that thing which you do I can't hide these things from my friend glory and if he's the father and we're the children of Abraham then we'll do the works of Abraham Jesus said seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation all the nations there shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon abraam that which he has spoken of him Oh Glory that's beautiful church amen so God knew Abraham would keep the word and he commanded the Next Generation now what about the spiritual generation that we are we should keep the word of Abraham and the word of God as well amen the just shall live by his faith he's father of Faith okay let's get to tonight's message praise the the Lord that was an 8 Minute review that's probably my shortest review I ever did in my life right there Glory but it's good to remember church because you know this week don't you forget something sometimes right and you name all the 10 Mysteries without me telling you so it's good to know it church it's good to know it's good to review it briefly all right and I'm just you know trying to trying to help everybody remember the more you hear it the more you remember now let's look at these tonight get your Bibles I wonder have some of you read these if you got Bibles handy I want because some of these are just really small portions of scripture the first Parable mystery is the swer who sowed seeds on four grounds or so just calls it the parable the sewer yes I just want to put those four grounds there because it's really important that there's four grounds all right Matthew 13 okay now we know uh the stor let's go to 18 let's go to 1318 let's just read that portion all right um and I'll read this one then after that I think they're a little short this one's kind of long so I'll read this one I hate to put a burden like that on somebody Verse 18 now here's uh important part now he tells about the parable the four grounds and the seeds on on on the four grounds now he interprets it for us uh in in verse 18 hear ye the therefore the parable the SE when anyone hear the word of the Kingdom so what are the seeds the seeds are word words of the Kingdom how do the words of the Kingdom get scattered by preachers right yes and understand it not then cometh the wicked one and catch away that which was swn in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside I just want to make a statement here I didn't write this down but if you come into a sermon and you walk out not understanding right you better be careful either that was a bad sermon or you need to seek God for understanding because if it's the word of the kingdom and you don't understand it Satan can snatch it out real quick praise the Lord so it's important that you understand what's being preached that's why the Bible said let the women ask their husbands at home right they're supposed to ask they're supposed to understand what's being preached amen glory amen so that's important God likes understanding remember Paul said I'd rather speak five words in a known tongue than 10,000 in an unknown tongue when I'm gathered with the Saints so that you all that all of us understand the word of God Amen okay verse let's finish uh I think we we finish that then cometh the wicked one and catch away that which was swn in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside verse 20 but he that receive the seed into Sony places the same as he that heareth the word and and on with joy receiveth it don't we like when people are joyful when they hear the word I like it that's right I like to see people really happy when they preach I like that I like to see him bad I like to see him happy glory and that is what Jesus says here we have another kind of a heart the first heart's a heart that doesn't understand the preaching and so they leave and Satan rips it out of their heart and they don't they don't get blessed by the word the second kind they get excited about the word but look at verse 21 yet have he no root in himself so he's not a very deep he has he don't have a real deep experience with God right praise God his roots don't go very deep in Christ but dth for a while for when tribulation or persecutes ariseth because of the word and by and by he's offended the word that he was so happy about now he gets mad at that same word yeah or gets offended what do you mean what do you mean this preacher did this what do you mean the church believes that what do you mean they get offended by the very word they just used to be excited about they used to be oh thank God God a prophet and not what he was no Prophet what do you mean right that right Church Mercy Lord right they used to love that word and joy received it and now they're offended by it don't talk to me about that kind of stuff oh mercy verse 22 he also that receiveth seed among the Thorns this one we got to watch out for those of us who keep coming to church and hanging around the message right yeah this what we got watch out for number 22 he also that receive seed among the Thorns is he that hear the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh what unfruitful I'm GNA show you that this is the foolish virgin it is I showed you this before I'm going show it to you there brother said there's four classes there's two kinds of believers in four classes I showed you that we're going to show it to you again tonight by the grace of the Lord so look if you don't give the word more importance than riches and cares of the world it will choke the word's influence in your life the word won't be able to breathe it won't won't be able to speak the word hallelujah it won't have life it won't have breath the word can't speak the word it's choked out of it it's strangled to death the word is strangled it can't speak in and people don't see the fruit of the spirit love joy Temperance godliness longsuffering how can we not so longsuffering anymore brother sister the words being choked in my life is that the Bible that's what Jesus taught right exactly um now here's the one we all want to strive for how you g to strive for this one Glory but he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that Hearth the word amen understands it like I said if you don't understand something preach don't walk away because say and say I don't care I have to understand all that you should do that sat might snatch you out of your heart and you might need that word somewhere along the line I don't care what it's about third seal I'm sorry third po seven seal there's third seal though too that's the only wine Glory T not that Satan amen you understand you see you can't just you should have put the word on such a low esteem we should put the word on the highest esteem amen yes you should email me your questions text me your questions if you don't understand if you're married ask your husband first hopefully he caught it if he can't catch it he can text me Glory but we shouldn't walk out here say well I don't understand it's okay I still love Jesus and things like that no don't get me wrong it's good to love Jesus but we should understand what's being said today now if you understand look at verse 23 says finishing it which also beareth what fruit so one type of Christian cannot bear fruit because they have cares to the world and all these lust and things like that but the real Christian who understands it they can bring forth the fruit of the spirit and they're the one that's born again exactly right that's what brother ra said Remember on Sunday we showed that brother ra said don't judge yourself by how many miracles you can do he said judge yourself by how much fruit you're presently producing that's right because every tree is known by what fruit the fruit of the spirit because if they don't have the Holy Ghost if they don't have the spirit really living in them then they can't produce the right fruit because they don't have the right seed amen right now here's what we need to do beareth fruit and bringeth for some some H hundredfold you imagine a h hundredfold times the seed you SED can you imagine that a hund times what you sewed that's quite a crop I don't I'm not sure which kind of seed produces that but that's that's quite a cop hundredfold some so some Christians will produce hundredfold of what the seeds were swn in their life Glory let's be those kind of Christians amen some 60-fold some 30 fold amen how many love the Lord amen now get your it up here if you if you want to I got some notes so this is the foundational Parable mystery like I said I've never preached on these I was really excited to preach this so if you feel my excitement praise the Lord so I'm excited tonight this is the foundational Parable mystery and it's interpreted by our Lord himself which we just read the seed is the word of God because a parallel passage in Luke 8 says the seed is the word and it's also which is the word of the Kingdom same thing so it's preaching of the word now notice now Simon told me this Simon had a good thought he preached this here before Simon noticed kain's ground could not bring forth any fruit in that powerful amen is that powerful the three worst kinds of ground never brought any fruit right the way side the Stony right brother the Stony was Roman Catholics denominationalism so it wasn't way side they got some they got some rejoicing uh but the foolish virgin must be the thorny because they don't bring forth fruit remember Cain was cursed and he said you'll try to plant and sweat but the ground will not bring forth for you and that was the type of his heart his heart will bring forth any fruit unto God any fruit of the spirit praise God why because he he left the Holy Spirit remember the Bible said Cain left the presence of the Lord with an evil countenance remember that so he didn't look like a happy Holy Ghost joyful Christian anymore God help us have the right countenance when we come to church right that's one way you knew Cain was not in one Accord with the Lord his countenance fell towards God you just look at him and say boy he don't really look like he loves the Lord too much oh my that's the Bible Church that's right that's the Bible but Adam's ground did bring forth fruit and that proves that every ground must be prepared and that shows us predestination praise God so the conditions of the ground look the ground was already in the condition when the seed came Glory Church if you're a good-hearted Christian if you're an hon hearted Christian if you're that best BR Christian then God prepared your heart to be in that condition it shows you're predestinated to bring forth 30 60 or 100 let's say praise the Lord amen glory praise the Lord amen because the the ground was already in that condition all four grounds were already in that condition when the SE came so it shows the power of predestination how come your ground can bring forth such things how come their ground canot bring forth such thing it's predestination the ground was ready for it right amen so ground number one is the Wayside the fouls represent the wicked one Jesus said so a bunch of birds always represent evil spirits and his Fallen Angels so this person who's A Wayside hearer does not understand the gospel so evil spirits catch away the word out of his heart and the word can't grow the word can't be watered he'll never be watered because he he didn't understand it and Satan catches way oh just bunch of nonsense that's the that that's the unbeliever right there the total unbeliever okay we just read that the Devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved okay the second kind of ground is Stony places this is the longest Parable so that's why it's going kind of slow so pardon me I got I'm gonna get through seven tonight by God's grace all right the Sony places represents the heart that immediately rejoices in the word but has no deepness of Earth or root in himself when tribulation and persecution arises represented by the son they're offended and wither away you ought to Rejoice if you live through tribulation amen you ought to Rejoice because you know I'm not one of those kind of grounds I'm not this Stony ground amen this most fall away when persecution comes to get past the very word they used to love they had Joy at one time that's ke our Jo let's not just have joy at the beginning of our walk with god let's keep our joy and let's bring forth fruit of the seed of the word of God Amen that's what the Bible says right there for which a while they believe they can believe for a [Applause] while right but in time of Temptation they fall away see this proves that one saved always saved only applies to God's mind praise the Lord God is the only one who knows that on who are saved will always be saved right because you can believe for a while but then be lost that's right because that that's what the Bible says your name being blotted out of the book of life that's exactly right why would Jesus tell the church age uh be careful or I'll blot your name out of The Book of Life why would he say that he says that because God keeps a record of all the confession because you overcome by your confession Glory the blood of the Lamb the word of your profession amen so God puts a list on The Book of Life in heaven of anyone that confess to be saved but if they deny that if they believe for a while and then leave it he blocks it out that's exactly what Jesus said Glory but if you're a real Holy Ghost to a Christian you were once saved always saved GL but if you're a make believer like Judas and Bam and all these Esau different ones like that you'll believe for a while but then you get offended by the word you get upset at the word your count is changes toward the word and then you deny the word and then your name gets denied on The Book of Life Oh Glory I'm little tired today so bear with me here by God's grace I'm excited and tired okay ground number three The Authority ground The Authority ground represents those who love the cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches choke the word thus the person is unfruitful like I said this is the one we got to be careful careful for right I gota be careful you got to be careful for this okay when they heard the word now Luke 8 is the parallel passage Luke 8:14 when they've heard they go forth and they're Chun with cares and riches and pleasures of this life remember the Bible said they were lovers of Pleasures or the lovers of God so what do you love more going to a church tonight or the pleasures of this world well shows a good thing if you came tonight because your pleasure is in the house of God Amen it's more pleasurable than anything else I can do the pleasures of being a Christian amen and number four here's well let's all strive to be good ground let's all strive to have a good ground heart the good ground represents those who understand the word they hear these bear fruit some hundredfold some 60 fold and some 30 fold the parallel pass I love this parallel passage look what Luke says so this is the kind of Christian we need to be an honest Christian right you know there's a lot of Christians honest amen can you say Amen to that amen they don't tell you the truth all the time yeah those are Authority Christians right or uh Sony ground Christians or so-called understand honest and a good heart having heard the word I love this they keep the word amen you see a real Christian keeps and obeys the Bible and bring forth fruit with what patience and patience is on the Statue of a person perfect man that's right Jesus said in patience possess your Souls praise the Lord he and then he told the church the Philadelphia Church CH he said if you keep the word of my patience I'll keep you from the hour of Temptation that's coming upon the entire world oh glory and here's what I want to show you remember this when I preached on sa David you remember that or has it been so long that I've overloaded you have I overloaded you okay there's two kinds of classes there's two Destinies there's a saved Destiny and a lost Destiny right and we call these Believers and now the lws have two kinds they have unbelievers that never believe like the the worst kind of the the Wayside ground and then they have make believers who believe for a little bit this is church AG book my teaches this in the CH Church age book right it's all from the Bible now underneath the saved the far right is the Holy Ghost filled the highest quality of Christian and I can just I can take a screen this an email to you if you want it by God's grace so the wise virgin is the highest quality of Christian then you have the foolish virgin make believer unbeliever the Bible says well we know Jes there's four crosses brother BR said Jesus was the highest quality the saved Thief at least he God saved right Judas was lost but believed for a while the Lost Thief never believed it again with right so the Bible in revelation 22 says there's holy he that's holy be holy still he that's righteous be righteous still he that's filthy be filthy still he that's unjust be unjust still the rain falls on the just and the unjust right second Timothy 2:20 says we must be meat for the Master's use which means there's some vessels of gold right some vessels of silver they get saved they're redeemed there's some vessels of wood some vessels of Earth and here's ours I already had this on you I didn't have to do nothing because I already preached this before it was already part of the message right Jesus said there's three kinds of ground there's a good ground produces fruit that's right the Thor ground doesn't produce fruit because it doesn't have the Holy Spirit the Stony ground doesn't rejoices for a little bit then Falls away in times of tribulation and the Wayside don't even they don't even understand it to begin with so you have four kinds of Believers in every age you have Abraham lot Mrs lot sodomites I still got two two to fill in here you have Mah Jehoshaphat Ahab jeze all right does that make sense you understand that church I'm really pay attention when I ask you understand I'm really pay attention do you understand after this sermon tonight if you don't understand Satan can snap you out of your heart you might not believe the right things might believe the wrong things okay so hopefully that hopefully that makes sense now look what brother says here doors in the door 1965 so we find that our messages today the message that we have of come out of Babylon be free be filled with the spirit and your lamp trimly clear and look up our Redemption y near these things are foreign to many people who breathe and call our lovely lord's name is that true a lot of people read the Bible and don't even know that God said my people better come out of the Roman Catholic church now it keeps going yet in the midst of all that we don't have nothing against those people those denominational people do you I hope you don't have anything against them right you should love them amen you should forgive them amen you should be a higher quality Christian than them not by bragging but by sure ability of the word bringing forth in your life they're all right they're fine look how look how nice they're all right they're fine they there're are Associates with the gospel because Jesus said no man can go to me except my father draws him and all the father give me will come I'm getting to somewhere I'm getting to where he talks about this Parable we just preached are so we're only responsible for sewing seeds some fell by the wayside some different kinds of ground some fell over and brought forth a h hundredfold so we are just seed sers God is the one who directs it when it's falling God knows where to take that seed and where it's going to fall God knew where you'd be to bring the work to you and now we pray that maybe this morning there be a little seed drop along somewhere that might encourage someone all right new quote I'm not going to read all this I'm sorry it's a little bit smaller too I'm going to start right here you know his own seed they said he SED some fell by the wayside didn't do any good at all some fell on Thorns but and on Stony ground but some went over in good soil that was the son of God I can just seow seeds the same way so now says he interprets this Parable for us Jesus is the sewer but it's Jesus in Preachers today that preached the word to us he said I can sow seeds the same way so church if i s ever SE any see guess what it wasn't me it was Christ amen Lord don't say great job brother Jus you're the best and you're I'm not if any good seed was sld it'd be Christ and him alone amen now here's one I love this is a beautiful quote this to me proves that that H hundredfold Seed that fell on good grass uh was the baptism of the Holy Ghost because this is what he says firstever 1963 August that's the way many people does about coming to Christ they lay the foundation of believing on the Lord Jesus and accepting him as personal Savior and maybe going on to Christian baptism but when it comes down to following on through to the baptism of the Holy Spirit somebody explains it away for them that's the reason that seed fell on by the wayside or it fell on Stony ground it tells us right here in order for a seed to in order for to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seed must go all the way through and accomplish what it's supposed to accomplish right all right how you like that hope you like that by God's grace a great in solon's here he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first and here's the gracious thing about it all the fathers give me will come that's the part I like that yes sir all the fathers give me will come and I'm happy for that so we don't know who is and who's not we just scatter forth the seed that's all we can do some Falls by the wayside some Falls this way and that way but some does fall on good ground that's right ground that's been prepared by God to receive the seed I told you God prepared your ground to receive the seed God God knew where that seed was going God knew gravity and the wind would take it this place and that place God knew where you were at he knows right where you are tonight too church God just you heard the word the first time he knows where you are right now praise God he goes on to say this he said some went forth when the sea went forth preached the word some fell by the wayside just like water on a duck's back runs right off some fell on Rocky ground Stony and it's just little dust that blowed up there and sprung up but didn't have no roots no place to put its roots I'm going to make illustrations here and I hope I don't hurt no feelings so I hope brother R doesn't hurt any feelings here he said that was the Catholic Church they said they was built on a rock Glory so the unbelievers the Wayside the Stony ground he says is the Catholic church because they're built upon a rock but they Peter if that their rock is Peter Peter's not the rock that the gospel's buil upon because he was a man and he'd fall short of the glory of God you can't build anything upon a man and expect the heaven to come forth and follow through you got to build your hopes on Jesus Christ and look he says I'll agree with them I'll sure agree with them that's right no no Earth under at all wow no Earth on it to grow from why it couldn't produce they couldn't produce a Bible vitamin because they don't even believe in it right GL I thought that was good I never heard that before till last night when I was studying I like that yes so the unbelievers the way side the Sony ground is Catholicism they don't have any vitamins of the spiritual vitamins of the word all right and I hope it don't hurt any feelings all right Queen Sheba I'm gonna go right to the highlighted part and then he say someone over and brought forth a h hundredfold see you must first let the word fall in the right type of Faith so now he calls the heart a heart of faith and then that Faith produces what the word said because the word is a seed all right next one I'm G read the underline part that's where many fall away because we can't stand that trial a person come to the altar time Revival and you watch just a little while and the hot trials begin to come so now we're talking about the Stony ground again watch somebody that comes to the altar but watch how they live their life after that he said Jesus plainly taught it the store went forth sewing seed some fell by the wayside some on swinging ground and among thorns and thistles and others fell over a good ground and he said that's the way the word went goes out some hears the word go out birds come along pick it up see they don't do no good at all all come up overnight oh they're going to do great things but when the trials begin to come it chokes them down but some goes all the way into the good crd and that brings forth aund fold so he says let's be hund folds how many want to do what brother R said there I do on this one I do let's be the hundredfold let's go way over and sell out everything from the world and look to Christ and believe him with all our hearts no roots of bitterness against anybody that's right and everything's cleaned out and the Holy Spirit can work through us then we become a channel he talks about if you stay in the channel of Christ if he abides in me my words abide in you ask what you will be done unto you you say this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe what you said will come to pass you're gonna have what you said praise God Amen all right that's the first Parable that's going to be the longest one okay because I had the most quotes on that one all right now number two is the parable of the wheat and tears this is an interesting text as well so let's go to this one let's go to Matthew 13:36 to 43 I'll read this one again because it's long but after that I'll have some brothers maybe some of the sisters if you'd like to uh read some verses for us let's read just the ocation I think is this another Parable mystery where Jesus interprets it for us so now can can everybody see how the four grounds or four types of classes of of Believers can everybody see that that's a mystery didn't Jesus say that's a mystery most people don't know that mystery but God gave it to brother right in time of the writing of the church age book right before he went off the scene glory amen and we know the mystery so we know not to be choked by the cares of the world or by riches we know we must be fully sold out to Christ if we're going to bring forth A3 or sex0 we know only those who are truly born again will bring forth the fruit of the spirit Glory now let me read this 1336 to 43 this a big read well you know what okay let's read it because we got time all right time let me okay it's 8 8:14 okay yeah we got time because the other parables are really short the first two are really long okay verse 36 then Jesus s the mude away and went to the house and the disciples came unto him saying declare us the parable the tears of the field that's how we should be church right look they didn't understand the parable so they go ask Jesus what what did you mean Jesus we should do that if we don't understand the word we should go to the Lord and say Lord can you explain that to me can you have somebody else preach that sometime soon because I didn't catch that or can we have the pastor sit down and do a Bible study about that I need to understand what you just said right GL aners into them he that s The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears of the children of the wicked one the enemy that sld them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers of the angels as therefore the tears are gathered together in the fire I'm sorry burn the fire so shall be the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out the kingdom all things that of fend and them which do iniquity and shall be cast them I'm sorry and shall cast them into a furnace of Fire there should be wailing and nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who have ears to hear Let Him hear all right praise the Lord now there's one scripture I want to read here just a moment okay now go to verse 25 I'm sorry I want to read this because this ties it with the interpretation 13:25 now brother Simon said he preached this when I when I was out in Iowa last summer okay so I don't know I don't expect you remember that that's a long time ago I just was curious who would that's why I asked you on Sunday who remembers what he said I didn't remember I wasn't here that's why and I don't actually don't think it got recorded either okay Matthew 13:25 now listen but wild men did what while they slept slept wild men slept so first the son of man SWS his good seed but then when those men sleep his enemy came and so tears among the wheat and went his way so first there's a bunch of weat when the gospel was produced think about Acts chapter 2 think about the book of Acts Glory God bless sister Wy appreciate your sacrifice bu Glory so see you get that in the book of Acts chapter 2 the church started out M there's a bunch of wheat seeds out there but while men slept when those Apostles started D the enemy came and sold a lot of Tears amongst the church age that's what brother Bram said I'm G to show it to you now this also types serpent SE we're going to show that too okay because that's the way I've always preached it but I talked to Simon Monday night on the phone for a while and he said that's he found this quote and I opened it up to him I said yeah that's exactly right that's the word the son of man was showing wheat wheat wheat wheat and then when men slept after men slept remember Paul said after I leave Ephesus remember act 20 previous wolves shall enter in not spelling the flock are you with me he worn them for three years and tears so once men slept once men moved on then the terror swers came in don't get me wrong the Antichrist Spirit was working before that we know that start working on the day after the day of Pentecost forever more you understand somewhere along in there but really Paul knew once I leave once a mighty prophet of God leaves that's when Satan can really go in there and sew in a bunch of Tears all right so now here's some notes I want to bring out some other things now this is a mystery most people don't understand this mystery they don't apply it the right way so this is the second Parable mystery and is again interpreted by our Lord himself I love that when Jesus interprets it himself because we can't miss it then that's right as long as we got right Hearts before God we won't miss it then the son of man is he that sow The Good Seed which are the children of the Kingdom the field is the world and the tears are are the children of the wicked one right the enemy that sow them is the devil you see the devil planted his own children praise God in the beginning In the Garden of Eden it was a natural Child by the serpent seed he influenced the serpent and brought forth a hybrid person right but now we're all mixed into that we all got that nature sin dwell in our members amen and even one of the most holy ghost filled Mighty Men of God St Paul still said that s dwells in my members and that what I hate that's what I do praise God even when Good's right there with me good and wrong right there with me even that which I hate I do that why because sin dwelleth in our members Glory the Harvest is the end of the world the reapers are the Angels in the end of the world the terar will be gathered by the angels of the son of man and the terrce will be burned in the Lake of Fire or the furnace that's the end of the world now here's my notes so this is might be different to you in this Parable we see two great Mysteries because this a mystery Parable amen Jesus said I speak them in Parables because there's Mysteries and it's given to you to understand the Mysteries amen so the first Parable the first meaning is there's two different seeds The Godly seed and the serpent seed that's right meaning that Eve was the field that received the two different seeds and now we would say something like this well I don't know how to say it but the Feld would just be the world yeah it was even the beginning of if you look at the type of two different seeds two different children and now uh the second interpretation so the first interpretation is serpent seed Children Of Satan the second one is the church ages here's the one brother has a quote for the meaning in this church age interpretation the meaning is that the field was the church age and had both weat and tears in each age and here's what brother man taught in the church age book it's page 367 for those who like to read it that paragraph number two now please let us be careful here resume the church ages this message to the angel of the church which is at Ephesus is not a message to the actual local Ephesian Church it is a message to the age so this message you know where the angel comes and speak to the Church of Ephesus that was to the entire age not just the church in Ephesus I think most of us understand that and that age had in it the seed of truth and the seed of air exactly as set forth according to the parable of the weat and the tears right is that beautiful the church ages is the field and in it are we in tears the false Church organized humanized the government the word and fought the true Christian Glory ain't that good church let's say praise the Lord ready praise the Lord amen I never seen that until this week I even read that book and I missed it so see how did the field start it started out with a bunch of wheat how the church age start with a bunch of truth but by The End by the Harvest what's happened you mostly have tears among SED and so it is in the churches today we most have tears sitting in churches today are you with me can everybody say Amen to that that sound right sound sound biblical that's exactly biblical so now you know the mystery of the uh the wheat and the tears is actually a mystery of the seven Church ages right Glory I don't know if you knew that but now you know thaten okay so the first mystery is of the four kinds of grounds two kind signs and destinies and four classes that's the first mystery of the kingdom of God the second one is what we saw here the mystery of the church ages how it starts off with good seed and then the tears spread like wildfire that's what they got Wildfire they don't have a controlled Mighty real substance fire glory amen a lick of tongue fire we'd say Amen they just got Wildfire makes it can't control it but a real Christian can control the holy spirit in life amen well there said you have control of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit has control of you praise God glory remember the greatest anointing on Jesus was the Holy Spirit in control amen not wildfire in control yes but if you have nothing but Wildfire praise God at least you got some fire but we want control fire that's right okay mystery number three like I said these are a lot shorter now look at this is only two verses so maybe some you can handle reading two verses morning I I just didn't want to have you read too much because I know it's a it's a labor okay let's go to Matthew 13 3132 you got your Bibles here okay when like to read that just raise your hand when like to read that John okay 31-32 this is the mystery of the grain of mustard see this might knock your socks off here so go ahead brother John yeah 13 31- 32 sir oh okay brother it's okay is everybody El time to get there another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and Seed in his field which indeed is that least of all seeds but when it is grown is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and Lodge in the branches thereof amen thank you sir now let me before I knock your shoes off here if you don't know this maybe you know it then I won't knock your shoes off get your spiritual jackets on then brother B said okay ready to be shocked by the Holy Spirit here now listen when I first read this I think oh Mustard Seed oh Mustard Seed Faith right Jesus said if your faith is the size of a mustard seed you can say this mountain move and it'll move but as you read it you start seeing how birds come along and Lodge in the branches thereof and the only pictures I can think of birds lodging are the Roman Catholic Church how she's a cage of un hateful and unclean Birds that's right and that Baker that Joseph had a dream for all the birds come and bit off you know the the cake on the pie on his head I can't think of any good things where and and and Abraham shoting all the fouls off of his sacrifice in Genesis 15 Glory said that was Abraham casting out Devils Glory so see I first thought it was a positive one but it's actually a mystery of the work of the Antichrist church and yes I have quotes back this up so the least of all the seeds brought forth the biggest herb of full tree it's so large birds come in Lodge there the little ly tongue Kindles a great fire the Bible say it's a world of iniquity amen one lying tongue one thing that's wrongly said some bitter word can become a whole world of iniquity are you with me church amen one word One root of bitterness can become an entire world of iniquity right Birds plural usually seem to mean evil spirits there's Genesis 15 where Abraham shooting away all the evil birds off the sacrifice that God told him to offer uh I Genesis 40 That's the the baker that died by command of the king with the birds picking up the pie off his head whatever more and then Revelation 182 is all the cage of unclean and hateful birds in the Roman Catholic Church whereas one bird the dove represents the holy spirit in John 13 all right here's your quote chapter nine Church age book The leoan Church age here's your quotation I know you've been waiting for it appreciate your patience now I said a moment ago the false FL came into full fruition in this age her her fruit would soon mature and ripen that's correct this evil spirit of church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into the tree where lies the fouls of the air and at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity amen look how Jesus hid that mystery laying in there everybody thinks that's oh that's Mustard Seed Faith and all these birds are com to Lodge on me better be careful what birds come and Lodge on you amen sister want one bird loding on me and that's the DB of God amen the Holy Spirit I don't want a bunch of birds L on me I want one bird and that's the Holy Ghost amen glory so brother man talk all this is true and this is true then it must also be true that the bride church WIll mature and her rightness will be in identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will become to hers the Myster of godliness which is in need Christ there's that quote one time brother said Christ is the mystery of godliness so he bring brings godliness to the people just how does he do that through St perect man add to your faith remember said it's the faith of Jesus Christ it's the virtue of Jesus Christ it's the knowledge of Jesus Christ it's the temperance of Jesus Christ it's the patience of Jesus Christ it's the godess of Jesus Christ it's a brother kindness of Jesus Christ and it says Jesus Christ himself amen the love of God amen glory finishing the quote and as the false church with all cunning and D iCal power made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against this True Vine the True Vine was the fullness of what the spirit of God not a bunch of birds one Bird right the spirit of God and the word would do the very acts of power that Jesus did amen then as she nears her head so becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and groom May forever be United as one how many love the Lord tonight Lord amen I love that one that's probably my favorite one I learned I never do that let the Lord revealed that to me this week Hallelujah so now you know that that's quite a mystery quite a mystery it takes a small lie a small sin and it grows in the biggest problem the biggest tree in your life and then a bunch of evil what the Bible said one demon will go get seven more demons and now you don't have just one bird I got a bunch of birds Glory Hallelujah mystery number four 11 hidden three measures of meal Hallelujah 11 hidden three measures of meal now who like to read that one for me just one verse anybody read that one 13:33 okay go ahead brother whenever you're ready 1333 I got up here you can read off here if you want but I did put that one there another Parable spoke he unto them the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid three measures of meal till the whole was leavened amen thank you sir thank you I got quiet interpretation for you on this one you got your shot Pro best on don't take him off yet I have some more shocking to do tonight I said that last one was a shock to me I'm like my mustard SE I thought that was a good thing I thought that was Faith turned out to be exactly opposite of what thought that's usually how the Holy Spirit brings it doesn't it that's how brother told the Holy Spirit brought on the White Horse Rider he thought it was the mighty conqueror it's exactly opposite the mystery of iniquity so see brother when the mind of the spirit comes in it's always contrary to what we think sometimes all right now here's some's my notes so this will start breaking into you so you understand it I looked it up okay not the word le is used 37 times in the Bible and every time it's mentioned in sin except in the time where it's in the the wave offering at the Feast of Weeks okay it's in the bread there was leav in that bread every other time it's mentioned in a sinful way right now I taught that and I believe I could back it up by the scripture two loaves were waved and there's Le in those waves now before that remember uh was it 50 days before that they waved the first fruits and that was the type of Christ there's no le in Christ yeah so when Christ was waved on the resurrection he's waved before the people there's no le but 50 days later on the day of Pentecost the church was weighed before the people Glory that seed that was in that first fruit came into life in this bread amen but baked into the bread so part of the church was part of it was sinful because don't we have sin in our members I just said it right right so that's what the Feast of Weeks was they weighed two loaves and I preach it like this I preached one Lo was the alpha bride and the other was the Omega I don't know his brother said saw the vision of the Bride he saw the first church M and he said when the next one came back it was just like the first one yes so that's why I preach I could be wrong I don't know one thing for sure it was way before the Lord so it was an offering unto God so it had to be something good the only time any 11 was ever good when it was part of the bread that was offered on the day of Pentecost and way before the that's got to be the sin that's left in the church inside the members of the Bride of Jesus Christ that they overcome amen because it's baked into them they can't take it out right you take it out you get rid of the bread and get rid of the believer right praise God you try to take the Le out the baked bread sometime I challenge you to do that you can't do it because Le becomes a whole it comes part of it it becomes everything come becomes like it okay so let me knock your socks off or shock you with some shock in here now two other Parables before this one I'm sorry one's before one's after two other Parables that are different from this one the wheat and the ter I went through that one and the draget the draget is the seventh and last Parable both speak of evil permeating the entire world right so this Parable would go along with Jesus other interpretations of the worldwide perversion around the world Le represents sin every time it is used in the Bible some 37 40 times I didn't put the UN before Le when I did the search I just did leev with any ending I should have put the asteris in front right to get all the UN but I didn't do that I thought well I just want to see what it says about 11 11 11 11 okay you understand now the kingdom gospel now look this is the difference the kingdom Jesus already said the kingdom gospel Goes Forth by sewing seeds not by intermingling leid are you with me that's how the kingdom Goes Forth you hear the word of the Kingdom by seeds being SE not by baking and injecting Leen into uh the flower where those seeds came from That's not how God does it praise the Lord he SWS the seed here's another beautiful type a woman types a church in Ephesians 5 a woman also types a city in Revelation 7 198 Rome and a woman also types A people which is Israel in Revelation 121 so a woman could be any of those three so what woman Church would hide sin in three portions of wheat flour until the entire meal was completely sinful what woman would do that I believe it's the Roman Catholic Church chch and I got a low scripture to back that up I don't have any quotes on this one so it's have to be all scripture notice this is a beautiful thought here look at this notice next notice the connection between the black horse rider which is the Antichrist spirit in the church ages under the third seal of the Dark Ages and this woman with Le they both work with three measures a barley and one works with meal they both have three measures they're working with right both have control over the grain or flow that's handled and the church said I know I jumped off my chair I did my search on three measures the black horse rider works the same way with three evil measures amen and that woman that woman who injects Le into the gospel injects Le into the good flower she's got three measures as well and they're both Antichrist amen so the 11 Parable proves their sin is present in three measures that they control they control said the black horse riter controlled the staff of Life which was natural which a type of the spiritual of the doctrine they were giving out to the people because they had in the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic Church was church and state combined and had control over the natural bread and the spiritual bread exactly right let me give you some scripture now here's the beautiful scripture I was talking about and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the forb say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and now brother said this was Jesus and see thou HT not the oil and the wine cuz the boys came out of the midst of the Beast and the Beast were worship in Jesus praise God and so Jesus say don't touch the simulation and Revelation and Holy Ghost baptism amen don't touch that amen oh glory amen and this is what we just read here's a woman who hides why would she hide sin in her bread right she's purposely hiding sin in her bread that she's gonna bake and feed to the people right because she knows what she's doing Church she don't operate in that unleavened bread like we do Glory First Corinthians 5 says we keep the Feast of the Passover with sincerity and truth and unleavened bread amen glory and the church Hallelujah so who in the world works with three measures a woman and a horse rider that's a black who else could that be except the Roman Catholic church and the Antichrist spirit in the Roman Catholic church right who else could that be and look church I got two or three Witnesses yes thank you Jesus and all these people this week that been trying to still throw me off of brother Bram I said show me one thing that you're saying that's got two or three Witnesses and they don't have any Witnesses Church it just it boils down to this Simplicity yes if we just simp simply follow the word where we just have two or three Witnesses and humbly keep the word rightly divide the word we always come out on top because we're just humbly keeping the word of God I don't have to impress people with big words and fancy words I just have to rightly divide the word the way the Bible said to divide it glory and he always rescues us he always stands up for us we always have the answer because he's the dissolve of all Satan's doubts Amen brother said we got the answer to Satan's questions amen and the answer is in the word of God Amen now listen this next L I hope I don't throw you off but listen three measures can represent either one of these three things or all three of these things but I found it striking that the Roman Catholic Church is connected with these three things that both have a three did you catch that I'm G show you three things that both have three parts so it could be one of these three or it could be all of these three so what did she inject into her bread now watch look at this one this sin in three measures it might be sin in the father son Holy Ghost false doct right because brother R said he saw a vision of a man beating his what m mom down and there's a three cornered Club he said which was a false trium baptism unto a trinity of gods and Satan just inject that false lie into the father Son and Holy Ghost brother said Satan travels in the names of Father Holy Ghost right Church it could be that or it could be something else it could be the three unclean spirits like frogs which is under the six file and the vials burn the tribulation yes which go out from the dragon look three unclean spirits go out from the Dragon one Satan the Beast the spirit of Rome because that's part of Daniel's Vision that Beast that man right and then the last one the false prophet which is the pope Antichrist right and I'm gonna show you the scripture after this the scripture after this shows it um it shows that those three Spirits go out to the entire world and defile defile the whole world and gather all the Sinners for the day of the battle the day of Our God the battle of Armageddon Glory so this the father and Holy Ghost might pervert the whole world no doubt it has the Catholic church is in every nation almost these three the Bible literally says with their lies of Wonders of working miracles their lying wonders their lying Miracles will pervert the whole entire world and gather them against the Christ and his people for our Glory or it might be number three which I put on our video on our website for mystery Babylon I love this I love when brother R brings us out the I think it's the second seal he said did you ever see how they have a threefold blasphemy against God it's in Revelation 13:6 the Bible said the beast in Revelation 13:6 blasphemed God's name every brother said how do they do that they change the name from Jesus Christ to father son Holy Ghost right it's blasphemy right change his name a Blasphemous Tabernacle and how they do that the Tabernacle in heaven coming down to earth new city but they call Rome the Eternal City and that's blasphemy that's what brother have said and lastly they blasing the Saints said how do they blasing the Saints in heaven he said they pray to them and makes offerings for them and make statues of them they blasting the Saints in heaven that's right praise the Lord amen so it might be one of those three it might be all of those three and three measures one measure two meure I'm gonna hide this sin this Li I'm gonna hide this lie in this food I'm giving out to the people and I'll bake it and they won't even see it and they'll partake of it and they'll be guilty of partaking of Leaven because it's baked in there that's right right and everything in their bread their false word and false lies is all laved up it's all sinful and they can't help but for partake 11 because Le makes everything like itself it's all lies it's all false Doctrine and God said come over my people that you be got partakers of sins and plagues amen we're preaching tonight praise God it's a good thing too because I'm not a preacher all right this is beautiful now I don't have this one understand I hope Wendy will email me on this when you guys will email me this go to Hosea chapter 7 look at this this a beautiful scripture here I I know how to interpret it but there's another connection to leaven in ovens and sin in adultery it's beautiful I jump about jumped off my seat when I saw this to I'm like but I couldn't understand this I'm like Lord help me help me Jesus help me I couldn't quite understand it so I'm sure the revelation will come and do season maybe the next few minutes here it'll come I don't know okay Daniel Hosea okay so Daniel Hosea I'm think that song Daniel J all right all right those good songs in our hearts amen glory all right well I'm having a hard time getting there brother by I'm having a hard time my fault okay now Hosea 7 now this is uh where God is rebuking uh Israel of course this is 780 BC this is right after um Solomon and David okay look at vers for they are all adulterers was it the Roman Catholic Church an adulter that's right they're all adulterers all Israel as an oven heated by the baker who Seth from Raising after it near the D until it be le so God Likens Israel to putting Le in their bread and putting in the oven and sitting around until it's all 11 that's exactly what the Catholic church has done they've injected Le it into their Doctrine and give it up to the people and they sit back and wait till the day of judgment well they're going to get judged no doubt about that one hour they're going to be judged sit back and just let the adultery see they know it's going to work because it's all 11 and anyone who partakes of it is an adulter before God exactly right that's why I said come out of her my people amen now it doesn't stop there because um go down to verse seven look at this they are all hot as an oven see they're hot with sin and lust and have devoured their judges all their kings are Fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me they're so hot hanging around this oven just sitting back and relaxing and then feeding all these lies to the people exactly right the church said amen look this gen other words this Old Testament New Testament I don't have I don't have a Genesis scripture on this but you can see Old Testament to New Testament can't you right all right so the woman the ministry of the woman 11 has got to be the Roman Catholic church planting Le and then sitting back and making sure everybody eats that oh it's all going to be Tak care they're all going to be adulteries yes they are they're all going to eat your adulterous work and that's a mystery praise the Lord amen how many preachers you ever see that recently preached the Le of the Catholic Church Glory will tear it up and they a bunch of Le only only Maniacs like me I imagine fix that but I'm a maniac for Christ I'm a ftic you're G be somebody's fool right are you fool for Jesus that's right and this is the only interpretation that works Through the Bible praise God you can't make the real Church injecting sin in the three measures where do you get the three in the church church AG is all seven but see they got three meals of Father Son and Holy Ghost oh they got three me of blasphemies maybe it's that one or three unclean spirits like FL they got threes all over them and Le always represents sin now here's the scripture like I told you sorry the mouth the three unclean spirits they are the spirits of devils that work miracles and they're not real Miracles because they're Devils right they're lying wonders and miracles the Bible tells us which go forth under the kings of the earth of what the whole world see this is Le that goes throughout the entire world just like the parable said to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty that's got to be if this is the B it has to be Armageddon that's right okay how many love the Lord amen okay it's got I got just two or three more here and these are the shorter ones too it's almost n o'clock we're doing good on time praise the Lord okay number five the treasure hid in the field now this is the one I had least amount on I I search and search I just couldn't find brother saying anything about this in particular but I do find a lot about the Pearl the great price in the message amen so this I I I liken this one a lot unto the next Parable mystery the parable of uh the great Pearl great price okay so verse 44 you got any other people that haven't read yet that would like to read Matthew 13:44 I got up there if you don't have a Bible anybody like to read that oh brother okay okay go ahead brother thank you again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man had found he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sth all that he ha and buth that feel amen let's say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so by notes Jesus said man found a treasure in a field the joy of this treasure caused the man to go sell everything he had in order to buy the field that contained the treasure right this Parable seems very similar to the sixth parable of a merchant man who sells out everything for the one great Pearl brother Ram liken humans unto the merchants and the one great Pearl as Christ so that's where I'm going to be done with that one um because this one is almost exactly the same principles of the fifth one but for some reason he has to tell it as a field and here he tells it as a pearl so Christ is both a treasure and a pearl we know that amen okay Glory all right six the pearl of great price okay Matthew 13:45 and 46 I'll read this one again the Kingdom of Heaven is like under a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he found one Pearl great price went and sold all that he had and bought it now here's my notes we are likened unto Merchant seeking goodly pearls is that how we start off we're seeking a lot of good things we want all kinds of good I want a good job brother I want a good friend I want a good wife I want a good husband I'm want a good I'm seeking all kinds of good things I'm looking for a lot I'm looking for health I'm looking for riches I'm looking for everything I'm looking for a lot of good things but eventually we find the one and only Pearl that means more than all the others there's a lot of good things out in the world you say it's a good thing to have a good job it is brother just it's a good thing to have nice that's a good thing too but there's one thing that's more precious than all that and that's Jesus Christ amen amen yes because this fits these scriptures back up this Parable by the truth yes yeah is go and buy the field that had the Pearl right he had to buy the true field are you with me church he had to buy it so he had to pay a price and we have to pay the price of some some separation brother man says separating from people that don't believe yes buy the truth and sell it not so why would he buy the field and then sell he bought the field and kept it Glory he didn't buy it and sell it out like people were trying to get me to sell it out I'm not selling out the truth I bought it it's mine I paid the price because he paid the price amen amen and also wisdom and instruction and understanding the good Hearts understand the Mysteries all those 10 mysteries on Sunday night now all these seven makes 17 Mysteries and we understand all 17 I was born on the 17th day of November so I like that to I just throw that in there I was born 17 years to the day after just once more 196 November 17th so there's just once more there's one more lad rain that's going to fall I don't know I'm just looking for more of God Amen know how you try to see God in your life don't you was 17 can preach 17 Mysteries I don't know if that's true or not but I thought that was pretty neat amen glory 318 i c the to what yes Christians have to buy right you're going to purchase something on this earth right you're either going to buy buy the goodly Pearl or going to buy all the other pearls right and then you bought your yourself a ticket to hell but if you buy that one feel that's all all useless except for one great Pearl oh my Hallelujah everything else around you don't mean anything all my life all these things around me really have no value there's only value one thing in my life and that's Christ amen no that's how we should look at our lives amen Jesus csing us he said you should make that purchase sister Josie brother Jesse brother John sister brail you should buy this this is a good purchase he's quite a great financial advisor what you say glory and he don't charge nothing for his fees either like these other guys okay buy me gold try the fire that thou mayest be rich and white r thou mayest be clothed and the shame of th nakedness should not appear and anoint th eyes with th side th mayest see Peter sold out how many you believe that he bought it Peter bought the the treasure in the field right in fact all them did now Judas didn't sell out all sins that's that was his trouble he still had that lust and that lust for greed in there that's why he sold out Jesus for 30 pieces of silver then Peter said Lo we have left off and follow thee and he said to them bear th I say to you there's no man that left house or parents or Brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God said who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life Everlasting Glory Glory Glory Glory he left all he sold out all he had so he could obtain Christ Christ said I'll reward you in this life and the life to come you know Elisha and Elijah right Elisha was plowing The Oxen and he saw Elijah walking he said the Bible say he left the ox and ran Elijah said let me I pray the kiss my father my mother I'll follow thee and he said go back what do with thee how about that for an encouragement for a Prophet Elijah can I follow you go back and just keep following your Ro see God likes the test us doesn't he Jesus made as if he'd keep walking on just want to see if they want to pull on him a little bit for some fellowship right amen come into the house and break bread with us there's something special about you and God was testing their faith sometime God test our faith and we must s out everything and cling to the pearl of great price in our lives and it returned back from him and took a yoke of ox and slew them I'm killing my previous life I'm separating all it's going to die my previous occupation is going to die I'm selling out lock sock and Barrel to following this message Elijah and he boiled their flesh with their instruments of ox and gave one of the people and then he then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered and he sold out everything yes and he bought a Ministry with Elijah right he had to sell out everything in order to buy a Ministry with God's Prophet yes I love this quote 1958 I know my redeemer liveth brother man praying for the people and he's kind of talking for them he says yes I was sitting in a little old black Tabernacle one beautiful Easter morning this was on Easter god raised up the curtain I looked to pass the curtain of time I see my church didn't mean very much praise God I seen there was nothing on Earth that meant very much to me anymore there I sold out everything I had I bought the pearl of great price I accepted Jesus as my savior and there's numerous quotes like this Christ is the pearl of great price I love this now here brother brings it to a deeper level he says the pearl of great price was the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is in 1963 after the seals I love that almost on my birthday Oh Glory three days away I'm just K that I lost my mind think I lost my mind even my good old righteous mother that di a few years ago when I first received the Holy Ghost there was no one in our country know anything about it and I was just a local little young B preach about 20 years old but when I received the Holy Ghost my mother said that boy has lost his mind see but no matter what mother thought I'd found that pearl of great [Music] price Hallelujah does the Bible say Christ is the unsearchable riches of Christ the pearl of great price is unsearchable riches oh it might have seemed like that to her but to me it was real see it was it was the genuine something that I had found in God hallelujah okay you ready for the last one then we'll close I thought I could get through all them tonight so God help me do that so I preached 16 Mysteries to you in the last few Services here's number 17 I also saw I got to look this up but one of the websites said the word charity is 17 times in the book of 1 Corinthians 13 look that something special with 17 107 17 17 Nations on the day of Pentecost something special in there so the net cast into the sea Matthew 13 47- 50 now what I thought was interesting was this let me just bear give me a second uh in the end time Revelation 17 the Beast has seven heads and 10 what was the other one corns horns yeah or maybe it's vice versa it's one of those I pray make S so you add at 10 and seven you get 17 and then we've got 17 Mysteries and the gates of hell can't Prevail against this Revelation that's right right so it seems like God gave us seven that's why I said 17 seems like the right number right because Satan always impersonates what God has done right praise God go and then God raised up a standard we have the revelation of all these tricks you tried to pull Satan we've got all the revelation of the word of God we need for this hour we've got 17 and our 17 always conquer Satan 17 amen amen so just a little thought there I didn't have enough time to study out 17 I studed a little bit on numerology last night but have enough time to get to it by God's grace 10 by the way 10 looks like law and judgment because you have Ten Commandments that's the law and then 10 plagues which look like judgment so 10 looks like law and judgment uh but then you got the 10 vergs I'm not sure about that who had the law who had the Judgment well the Judgment would have been the foolish so I I'm just trying to understand okay so numerology is real a real touchy subject uh because you gotta make sure all lines up but anyways I just thought that was interesting okay the cat the net cast in the sea again the Kingdom of Heaven is like under a net that was cast in the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew the shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but Cast Away the bad so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and separ the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire and there should be wailing and nashing of teeth what a beautiful way to end this Jesus again interprets this Parable as one that deals with the end time is that beautiful amen look at this all these Parables deal with the end time and the Bible said the Mysteries couldn't be finished till the end amen they couldn't be understood until the end time why because they're about the end time that's beautiful right there Glory a net Goes Forth at the end time and gathers every kind of person good and wicked right so everybody's gathered together good and wicked Angels sever the wicked away from them and cast them in the furnace of fire this kind of sounds like the white Throne judgment I don't know it could be I don't know might be or it might be something like once they're bound you know in their economical Council and later burn the white thr judgment I'm not sure but it sounds a little bit like that and they're cast in a furnace of fire with weeping and nashing your teeth could be the burning right before the Millennium right we we walk out on the ashes of the wicked so it could be that too I don't know but I'm just saying what Jesus said so B says a little bit about this there's only one thing that we know to do and that's the follow the instructions our Lord left us preach to God Every Creature amen he knows who's saved and who's not we do not know that we don't know who's saved and who's not right we do not I'm sorry we just cast The Net into the sea bring forth of all kinds but God knows who's saved and who's not and no man can come to except the father's drawn him and all the father giv will come we know that so we can't say this one is a Christian that one isn't because he said the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man that took a great net and went to the SE and cast it in and when he taken the net in he had all kinds of things in there there would be water spiders bugs snakes and fish scavenger fish and good fish and but you see the water bugs and things finally crawl back in the water again but the good fish was Kept For The Master now we don't know which is we just cast The Net but remember that water bug was a water bug when the net went over him the influence of the meeting was what caught him the snake was still snake the gospel that just ped him in and the scavenger fish was a scavenger fish the turtle was a turtle the Crawfish was a crawfish see but the real fish was a fish to begin with so he knows which is because he had their names on his book yes put there when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and we are very or we here to try to do our part now brother Vic has been over on the counter casting the net for many years other ministers have been on other Corners casting the net I come to weave my net with you Brethren so that we can just make a great big cast and just keep pulling like fishermen on the corners of the lake one of these days the last fish will be taken from the lake fishing will be over then let us seek God with all of our hearts pray and be sincere as we see this hour approaching and stand to our feet why is that such a critical Parable because people think it anyone comes up to the alt thing they're saved is that true right they think anyone one that the gospel net has pulled in oh they're saved oh they're fish and Jesus said this is a mystery they're noten amen and only his elect angels will know which is which amen I say like this by their fruits you shall know them oh yes by their fruits you shall know them so we have 10 Bible Mysteries and I Nam them off I preached them on Sunday night plus seven Parable mysteries of Jesus Christ give us 17 total New Testament Mysteries like I said I'm not sure what 17 means but I do know this the Bible said the mystery of God should be finished that's right and church how many can say by the grace of God you understand all 17 Bible Mysteries hallelujah amen glory is that right church we understand all those by the help of God Amen all 17 so I feel sad for anybody says oh the Mysteries aren't finished every mystery I've gone through every Bible word when it said mystery every time it said mystery those are the 17 doctrines and Parables that deal with Mysteries and the Bible said they'd be finished we are standing on the Rock of Ages glory and notice I didn't add my own thought I let the scripture interpret the scripture is that right even on the ones we have quotes for we just line that one up with the other one about the pro great price because it's it's the same principles Al together just a different thought one's for a man with land or uh yeah one for the field there treasure and then one's for a pearl yes praise the Lord let's bow our heads here sister going to come to thank you very much you know we've s a lot tonight and I hope you know if you didn't if you miss something you I hope you'll understand it that's kind of like the them of tonight amen I want you to understand what was preached I don't expect everybody to remember these things and that's not really the reason I preach it I preach it because I believe the mysteries of God are finished and I've never preached on these seven Parables ever before and this week they just seem to open up to me amen and church and then to watch as I study to watch the scripture interpret the scripture that's that's more that's the Pearl great Christ amen that's the spirit of Christ in my ministry that's right because there's nothing good that can come from Jesse Smith or any other preacher but when scripture interprets scripture when the word interprets itself and everything lines up just right amen that we can know that the Holy Spirit came down to reveal his word to us in a lot of these church we know our Prophet already told us what they meant just a few we had to looked to the scripture but they don't go against anything that was ever taught anything that was ever said by our Prophet or anything in the word of God they line up just exactly right what a privileged people we are to know all 17 [Music] Mysteries there's something special about this number I'm not quite sure Revelation 10:7 10th day the seventh month day of atonement all these things church I don't fully understand it but I know one thing I want to be one of God's children I want to be one of the wheat seeds I want to be that good CR that hears the word and has a good and honest heart I don't want a dishonest heart I don't want to choke the word my life to where the word can't breathe the word's not getting life like it ought to the words are getting fueled I want the word to be fueled in my life how do say brother Jess want the word to be fued pray foress Heavenly Father we pray tonight for understanding yes we pray for that heart that brings forth a h hundredfold of what was planted or a heart of 60 fold or a heart of 30 fold one thing we know for sure we're not the Wayside we're in church we're not the Stony because we we've called we've come through trial after trial persecution after persecution and we're still standing we still joy in the word we first heard Am Lord where Ratt with the cares of the world all of us I do everyone does your Prophet said that was the struggle of this hour the cares of riches no other age really had to battle like we do because ours is the lat seen age Rich increas good Lord forgive us if we've lost our Focus off you this week dear Lord may we get our Focus back on the pearl of great there's a lot of pearls that are shining out there but Lord let our eyes be on the one Pearl that is the Pearl that's more valuable than all the other pearls may be more valuable than our family and our friends our Associates and our jobs and everything like that everything we have the pearl of Christ and our relationship with Christ may that be the Pearl that we sell out everything for amen this week May we sell out everything every day for this world de God I pray for your people that they'll do it thank you that you didn't inject Le in your doctr Lord thank you that the bride doesn't inject Le into her word but the Bible said we keep the feast with sincerity with unleavened worship dear God and sincerity and Truth dear Lord there's no leav in this bride your Prophet said that so we thank you dear God help us to live that kind of a life help us to overcome by the revelation of these Mysteries and the revelation of the minors too yes because you said Lord it wasn't mean you said the Mysteries will be finished and Lord we just standing all tonight to see every time the Bible calls a mystery you've showed it to us by the word only you can do that Lord and the rest of the church is scratches their head or they think they got the right answer but it's actually contrary to everything in the Bible it doesn't puff us up like Le it makes us humble God look what you showed me now it's and then Lord we feel the weight of responsibility of wanting to live this and share with others your abil may we use just something as simple as inviting somebody in church maybe this week Lord or maybe something simple as just giving out a card or giving out a Bible or giving out a sermon or just something simple just to try to pass on that Pearl great price we know most of the time it'll be rejected in fact in your first Parable only 25% of the seed fell good ground one out four but I imagine the percentage is worse than that now but Lord you were just given a parable a very small percentage not even the majority of our efforts will bring forth yes how few of my sermons actually bring forth we'd say a New Soul we get Lord I know how many sermons are Lord are bringing forth changed lives and repentance hearts and souls that love you Lord we thank you Jesus thank you Lord we can water the seed pull out roots of bitterness pull out roots of other sins and let the light of Christ shine upon the SE in the good hearted grounds of your children oh thank you Jesus we love you tonight so Lord now we rededicate our lives for the rest of this week dear Lord and we thank you for these may we understand your word not get offended by it accept it and live it dear God thank you Jesus help us to be honest help us to be patient amen patient Lord the good ground keeps the word with patience let us be patient as we wait upon all your promises in Jesus Christ's name church amen let's give the Lord a round of applause praise God you know this sermon was one of those kind where you just sit back and I just watch the Lord unfolded amen I'm just like I'm just an observer yes I just typ in a few words boom boom boom I can see it I see it Lord thank you where a gift just goes to operating and you just got to catch it and put it on paper because God opened it up for us I just want to thank the Lord for this word tonight I want to thank him that he prepared my heart to receive this seed right he prepared it before the SE out there it was already a good ground [Music] amen wasn't myself that you know made the ground ready it was God's mercy that made it ready so why don't we thank the Lord for his Mercy tonight praise [Music] God he is my he is [Applause] my he is my own he is [Applause] my great and he his for me everything
