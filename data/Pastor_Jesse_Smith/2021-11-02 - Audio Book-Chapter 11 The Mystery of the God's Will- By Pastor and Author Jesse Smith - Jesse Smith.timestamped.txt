[0:00] chapter 11 the mystery of god's will
[0:04] chapter 11 contains footnotes numbers
[0:06] 1693-1792
[0:13] having made known unto us the mystery of
[0:15] his will according to his good pleasure
[0:18] which he hath purposed in himself
[0:20] ephesians 1 verse 9
[0:24] multitudes of religious people say they
[0:26] want to know god's will for their lives
[0:28] for certain this is an admirable
[0:30] confession but how many would accept it
[0:33] if they knew god was calling them to
[0:35] holiness
[0:36] in the greek lexicon holiness means
[0:38] sacred physically pure morally
[0:42] blameless paul emphatically states god's
[0:45] call upon every christian's life is a
[0:48] holy calling in second timothy 1 verse 9
[0:51] who hath saved us and called us with an
[0:54] holy calling not according to our works
[0:57] but according to his own purpose and
[0:59] grace which was given us in christ jesus
[1:02] before the world began
[1:04] first note that god loves you so much
[1:07] that his purpose for you started before
[1:09] the world began
[1:10] the bible tells you where you came from
[1:13] god's mind and where you're going back
[1:15] to god's presence
[1:18] ephesians 1 verse 4 agrees saying we
[1:20] should be holy based upon our love for
[1:22] god
[1:24] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:26] before the foundation of the world that
[1:28] we should be holy and without blame
[1:30] before him in love
[1:32] you will learn where you are now in
[1:34] relation to god's will and how to remain
[1:37] in his perfect will
[1:40] god calls us to holiness away from the
[1:42] world you cannot live immorally and
[1:45] claim to be obedient to god's will
[1:47] you're not called to enjoy sin
[1:49] in first thessalonians 4 verses 7 and 8
[1:52] paul claims we are not called to
[1:54] uncleanness but to holiness
[1:57] men despise us for this calling but our
[1:59] leading to be holy is through the holy
[2:01] spirit within us
[2:03] jesus's holy voice daily calls you to
[2:06] live holy
[2:08] in fact holiness is a requirement to see
[2:11] jesus in his mercy
[2:12] hebrews 12 verses 14 and 15 read
[2:16] follow peace with all men and holiness
[2:18] without which no man shall see the lord
[2:21] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[2:24] the grace of god
[2:26] you read that correctly
[2:28] religious people can fail or fall short
[2:31] be destitute lack god's grace and miss
[2:34] heaven
[2:35] many fail or reject grace by disobeying
[2:37] jesus's commands
[2:39] god's warning for this is recorded in
[2:41] hebrews 10 verse 29
[2:43] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[2:46] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[2:49] trodden underfoot the son of god and
[2:51] hath counted the blood of the covenant
[2:53] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[2:56] thing and hath done despite unto the
[2:58] spirit of grace
[3:01] doing the will of god is at the core of
[3:03] the christian experience
[3:05] and is a requirement to enter heaven
[3:07] in the greek will means choice desire or
[3:10] pleasure since god is eternal infinite
[3:13] omniscient and omnipotent his will or
[3:17] choices for us are our joy and comfort
[3:20] humans constantly make disastrous
[3:22] choices so god's will saves us from our
[3:25] helpless
[3:26] fallen sinful selfish and failing
[3:29] condition
[3:31] jesus's prayer in gethsemane in the
[3:33] moment of his greatest anguish marked by
[3:36] bloody sweat drops is likely the most
[3:38] memorable and famous quote regarding
[3:40] god's will
[3:41] luke 22 42 records this prayer saying
[3:45] father if thou be willing remove this
[3:47] cup from me nevertheless not my will but
[3:50] thine be done
[3:52] the father's will superseded the will of
[3:54] jesus flesh and mind
[3:56] which did not want to suffer let alone
[3:59] die the brutal death of the cross
[4:01] yet jesus chose god's will and christ is
[4:04] exalted glorified and worshiped because
[4:07] of his momentous surrender of his own
[4:09] will
[4:11] jesus's ability to always do the
[4:13] father's will is what made him a worthy
[4:15] substitutionary sacrifice for mankind he
[4:18] said in john 8 verse 29 for i do always
[4:22] those things that please him
[4:24] your ability to surrender to and obey
[4:26] god's will is what makes you worthy of
[4:28] heaven according to our lord in matthew
[4:31] 7 verse 21
[4:33] not every one that saith unto me lord
[4:34] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[4:36] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[4:38] father which is in heaven
[4:42] the confusion about the mystery of god's
[4:44] will
[4:45] the confusion about god's will centers
[4:47] on whether or not it can be known and if
[4:50] so how can it be known
[4:53] is his will known by just reading the
[4:54] bible or does god speak in other ways
[4:57] additionally many wonder if it's their
[4:59] responsibility to seek god for his will
[5:02] or if god is obligated to initiate his
[5:05] will by supernaturally revealing himself
[5:08] and his will to them
[5:10] the revelation of the mystery of god's
[5:12] will is that god initiates and reveals
[5:15] his will to every person making them
[5:18] responsible for responding to him and
[5:20] seeking his future desires
[5:24] biblical evidence for the revelation
[5:26] about god's will
[5:28] scripture teaches god initiates a
[5:30] relationship with every human
[5:32] undeniably revealing himself and his
[5:35] eternal power
[5:36] romans 1 verses 19 and 20 proclaims
[5:39] because that which may be known of god
[5:41] is manifest in them for god hath showed
[5:44] it unto them
[5:46] for the invisible things of him from the
[5:48] creation of the world are clearly seen
[5:50] being understood by the things that are
[5:52] made even his eternal power and godhead
[5:55] so that they are without excuse
[5:58] god makes everyone know his existence by
[6:01] giving them proof in close proximity to
[6:03] them in their body mind and all creation
[6:07] in the universe around them
[6:09] as preacher ray comfort correctly
[6:11] reasons atheists believe the scientific
[6:14] impossibility that nothing created
[6:16] everything every building is proof of a
[6:18] builder every painting is proof of a
[6:21] painter creation is proof of a creator
[6:24] it's impossible for it to make itself
[6:27] there will be no excuses on judgment day
[6:29] for denying god's existence grace and
[6:31] mercy his love is proven in the air you
[6:35] just breathed the grass you walk on and
[6:38] the 35 million times your heartbeat in
[6:41] the past year without needing your help
[6:43] or permission
[6:45] through god's mercy we live and move and
[6:48] have our being
[6:49] life is such a beautiful opportunity to
[6:52] experience god's love and share with
[6:54] others
[6:55] solomon states the glory of life's
[6:57] opportunities but perfectly balances it
[7:00] with god's requirement for
[7:02] accountability in ecclesiastes 11 verse
[7:04] 9
[7:06] rejoice o young man in thy youth and let
[7:08] thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy
[7:10] youth and walk in the ways of thine
[7:13] heart and in the sight of thine eyes but
[7:16] know thou that for all these things god
[7:18] will bring thee into judgment
[7:21] armed with this inward spiritual
[7:23] knowledge and outward scientific
[7:25] evidence all men are responsible for
[7:28] responding to god by searching after
[7:30] knowing and doing his will
[7:33] every soul has a thirst for god and
[7:35] truth psalm 42 verse 2 reads my soul
[7:39] thirsts for god for the living god
[7:43] god mercifully grants each person the
[7:45] gift of life an awareness of his
[7:47] creator's existence and free moral
[7:50] agency
[7:51] but god is going to demand back or
[7:53] require each soul to give account of his
[7:56] choices
[7:57] luke 12 20 says of the lost soul thou
[8:00] fool this night thy soul shall be
[8:03] required of thee
[8:04] the wise soul will seek after god and
[8:07] find him through the cross of jesus the
[8:09] sinful foolish soul will deny his
[8:12] creator and spurn his mercy
[8:16] validated by john 3 16 and verse 19 the
[8:19] sad truth is god loves the humanity he
[8:22] created but most men greatly love
[8:24] darkness those who love god will be with
[8:27] him eternally those who hated and
[8:29] despised him will be separated from him
[8:31] eternally
[8:33] our lord is too gracious and loving to
[8:35] force anyone to be in his presence
[8:38] eternally
[8:40] god's sovereign will
[8:42] there are three aspects to god's will
[8:45] first god's sovereign immutable eternal
[8:48] unconditional will
[8:50] second god's known will for man
[8:53] third god's progressive unknown or
[8:55] future will of man
[8:58] ultimately god's will is sovereign
[9:00] immutable and eternal before the
[9:03] foundation of the world the eternal god
[9:05] pre-planned all human history based upon
[9:08] his foreknowledge of every human
[9:10] decision beginning with believers 1st
[9:12] peter 1 verse 2 says we are elect or
[9:15] chosen based upon god's foreknowledge
[9:18] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[9:20] god the father through sanctification of
[9:23] the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling
[9:25] of the blood of jesus christ
[9:29] god never had to neither had need to
[9:32] ask anyone about how to plan human
[9:34] existence he needs no counselor as
[9:37] isaiah 40 verses 13 and 14 proclaims
[9:40] who hath directed the spirit of the lord
[9:43] or being his counselor hath taught him
[9:45] with whom took he counsel and who
[9:47] instructed him and taught him in the
[9:49] path of judgment and taught him
[9:51] knowledge and showed to him the way of
[9:53] understanding
[9:55] the obvious answer is no one
[9:58] god declares the beginning from the end
[10:00] and does exactly what he wants
[10:02] isaiah 46 verses 9 and 10 reads
[10:06] remember the former things of old for i
[10:08] am god and there is none else i am god
[10:11] and there is none like me
[10:13] declaring the end from the beginning and
[10:15] from ancient times the things that are
[10:17] not yet done
[10:18] saying my counsel shall stand and i will
[10:21] do all my pleasure
[10:23] what pleases god he does
[10:26] it pleased god to plan the flood in
[10:28] noah's day
[10:30] nearly two thousand years afterwards he
[10:32] planned jesus's substitutionary death
[10:34] beforehand along with his resurrection
[10:37] his future plans for the rapture
[10:39] tribulation battle of armageddon
[10:41] millennium white throne judgment and new
[10:44] jerusalem future home are all steadfast
[10:48] sure and unchangeable
[10:50] we can't stop his will nor delay it or
[10:52] alter it but we can embrace it and
[10:55] prepare for it if you haven't yet done
[10:57] it make your plans to repent of your
[10:59] sins and live with jesus in his future
[11:02] home
[11:04] every nation under heaven is subject to
[11:05] god's will
[11:07] worldly rulers cannot alter god's
[11:09] eternal purposes
[11:10] our lord allows them freedom in decision
[11:12] making but he alone ultimately decides
[11:15] what will happen based upon his eternal
[11:18] plan
[11:19] psalm 33 verses 10 and 11 declares the
[11:22] lord bringeth the council of the heathen
[11:24] to naught he maketh the devices of the
[11:27] people of none effect
[11:28] the council of the lord standeth forever
[11:31] the thoughts of his heart to all
[11:33] generations
[11:35] daniel 2 verse 21 says god alone changes
[11:38] the times and seasons of earthly leaders
[11:41] removing and setting them up
[11:43] after being humbled by god for seven
[11:45] years one of the world's most powerful
[11:47] leaders of all time nebuchadnezzar
[11:50] described god's sovereign will over the
[11:52] earth thusly i bless the most high and i
[11:56] praised and honored him that liveth
[11:58] forever whose dominion is in everlasting
[12:00] dominion and his kingdom is from
[12:03] generation to generation and all the
[12:05] inhabitants of the earth are reputed as
[12:07] nothing and he doeth according to his
[12:09] will in the army of heaven and among the
[12:12] inhabitants of the earth and none can
[12:14] stay his hand or say unto him what doest
[12:17] thou
[12:19] job's life teaches that everything the
[12:21] devil does must first be allowed by god
[12:24] giving us great trust in our heavenly
[12:26] father as we go through trials and tests
[12:29] chapters 1 and 2 show satan having to
[12:31] ask permission to tempt job and god
[12:34] allowed it because he knew in his
[12:35] foreknowledge job would eventually
[12:37] overcome the temptation and not fall to
[12:40] it first corinthians 10 13 says all
[12:43] temptations upon man are similar and
[12:46] shared and god will only allow a test in
[12:48] your life that he has already equipped
[12:50] you to overcome
[12:53] yes god works everything according to
[12:55] his own counsel and pre-plans every
[12:58] event for the spiritual benefit of his
[13:00] children
[13:01] believers ephesians 1 verse 11 says we
[13:04] are predestinated according to the
[13:06] purpose of him who worketh all things
[13:09] after the council of his own will
[13:12] romans 8 verse 28 deuteronomy 6 verse 24
[13:16] deuteronomy 8 verse 16
[13:18] and deuteronomy 10 13 all agree that god
[13:22] works every event for our good always
[13:26] you never have to wonder why good or
[13:27] evil happens to you
[13:29] your heart rests in heaven's assurance
[13:32] that every event that occurs in your
[13:34] life will make you love god more
[13:37] the best way to prove your love to god
[13:39] is by believing in a sovereign will and
[13:42] choosing thankfulness and joy while you
[13:44] go through trials of faith that his
[13:46] infinite wisdom allowed to come to pass
[13:50] jesus promises you peace that passes all
[13:53] understanding and a life free from
[13:55] anxiety as you prayerfully thank god for
[13:58] everything in your life while making
[14:00] your personal request known to him
[14:04] god's known will for man
[14:06] moving to man's perspective of god's
[14:08] will there is a will of god he makes
[14:11] known to men and then a progressive
[14:13] future will men must seek for
[14:17] starting with god's known will he first
[14:19] gives every soul an awareness and thirst
[14:22] for fellowship with him
[14:23] the individual's inward conscience and
[14:26] knowledge of his maker's desire to save
[14:28] his soul makes him thirst to respond to
[14:31] god and seek him
[14:33] he either quenches his soul thirst by
[14:35] seeking and finding christ or hushes and
[14:38] silences it with sinful pleasures
[14:42] god's will is further known through the
[14:43] holy bible which contains all his holy
[14:46] commands simply put god's will is his
[14:49] word
[14:50] notice ephesians 1 verse 9 says the
[14:53] mystery of god's will is purposed in
[14:55] himself and he is the word
[14:59] there are two crucial aspects of god's
[15:01] known will
[15:02] his desire for every human to be saved
[15:04] and then be born again or filled with
[15:07] his spirit
[15:09] first the eternal god wants all men to
[15:11] be saved from hell but in his love will
[15:14] not force anyone to love him in return
[15:17] he will patiently wait until every
[15:19] person who longs to be saved is saved
[15:23] second peter 3 verse 9 states the lord
[15:26] is not slack concerning his promise as
[15:28] some men count slackness but is
[15:31] longsuffering to us word not willing
[15:33] that any should perish but that all
[15:35] should come to repentance paul agrees to
[15:37] this in 1st timothy 2 verse 4
[15:40] who will have all men to be saved and to
[15:42] come unto the knowledge of the truth
[15:45] do not allow the devil to tell you god
[15:47] doesn't love you and doesn't want you
[15:49] saved here's biblical proof he wants you
[15:52] saved trust god and his word for satan
[15:55] is the father of lies and jesus is the
[15:58] faithful and true witness
[16:00] jesus promises it is not the will of
[16:02] your father which is in heaven that one
[16:04] of these little ones should perish
[16:08] jesus wants you and every believer in
[16:10] heaven with him for he said in john 6 40
[16:14] this is the will of him that sent me
[16:16] that everyone which seeth the son and
[16:18] believeth on him may have everlasting
[16:21] life and i will raise him up at the last
[16:23] day
[16:24] galatians 1 verse 4 says it is god's
[16:26] will to deliver us from this present
[16:28] evil world
[16:31] our god does not delight in the death of
[16:33] the wicked for he wants and pleads for
[16:35] the souls to love him and live
[16:38] ezekiel 33 verse 11 declares say unto
[16:41] them as i live saith the lord god
[16:43] i have no pleasure in the death of the
[16:45] wicked but that the wicked turn from his
[16:48] way and live
[16:49] turn the eternity from your evil ways
[16:51] for why will ye die o house of israel
[16:55] when a soul hears the good news of jesus
[16:57] christ preached and explained he knows
[16:59] the revelation of the mystery of god's
[17:01] known will
[17:03] paul says the revelation of god's will
[17:05] is that all things in heaven and earth
[17:07] will be gathered in christ and believers
[17:10] will have an unending inheritance as
[17:12] they praise jesus glory eternally having
[17:15] made known unto us the mystery of his
[17:17] will according to his good pleasure
[17:19] which he hath purposed in himself that
[17:22] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[17:24] times he might gather together in one
[17:26] all things in christ
[17:28] both which are in heaven and which are
[17:30] on earth even in him
[17:32] in whom also we have obtained an
[17:34] inheritance
[17:36] being predestinated according to the
[17:37] purpose of him who worketh all things
[17:39] after the council of his own will
[17:42] that we should be to the praise of his
[17:43] glory who first trusted in christ
[17:47] the second truth about god's known will
[17:49] is his desire for christians and all men
[17:52] to be born again
[17:54] god loves when believers hear the good
[17:56] news accept it and get saved because
[17:59] part of the known will of god is obeyed
[18:01] giving god great pleasure however full
[18:04] redemption is a three-step process
[18:07] justification sanctification and the
[18:09] filling of the holy ghost see chapter
[18:12] five
[18:12] this was tight by israel coming out of
[18:15] egyptian bondage
[18:16] deuteronomy 6 verse 23 says god brought
[18:19] them out to bring them in
[18:22] and he brought us out from thence that
[18:24] he might bring us in to give us the land
[18:26] which he swear unto our fathers
[18:29] jesus brought you out of sin justifying
[18:31] you but he doesn't want you to stop
[18:33] there he wants you to come through the
[18:35] spiritual wilderness of sanctification
[18:37] and into the promised land of the holy
[18:40] ghost baptism in your soul 2 corinthians
[18:43] 5 verse 17 says you are a new creature
[18:46] when you are in christ
[18:49] jesus first commands all to be born
[18:51] again in john 3 verse 7. ye must be born
[18:54] again remember israel leaving egypt she
[18:57] must reach canaan or else she would fall
[18:59] short of god's will
[19:01] then christ invites all to be born again
[19:04] in john 7 verses 37-39 crying if any
[19:09] thirst let him come unto me and drink
[19:12] this spake he of the spirit which they
[19:14] that believe on him should receive for
[19:16] the holy ghost was not yet given
[19:19] the universal invitation to the new
[19:21] birth is also resounded by the holy
[19:23] spirit and the bride church in
[19:25] revelation 22
[19:27] 17
[19:28] and the spirit and the bride say come
[19:31] and let him that heareth say come and
[19:33] let him that is a thirst come and
[19:35] whosoever will let him take the water of
[19:38] life freely
[19:39] again cast down any doubt satan puts in
[19:42] your mind about god not wanting to fill
[19:45] you with the holy ghost
[19:46] deny the seducing serpent and accept the
[19:49] loving lamb
[19:52] if you want to obey both aspects to
[19:54] god's known will
[19:55] being saved and spirit filled
[19:57] you need only genuine love
[20:00] all jesus precepts are summarized and
[20:02] fulfilled in one word love
[20:04] in matthew 22 verses 37 through 40 jesus
[20:08] says loving god with all your heart and
[20:10] loving your neighbor fulfills every
[20:12] command
[20:13] three times paul echoes jesus summary
[20:16] saying love is the fulfilling of the law
[20:19] if you can truly love god you will do
[20:21] his will
[20:23] in first john 5 verses 1 through 4 the
[20:26] apostle john writes that being born
[20:28] again is the source of this divine love
[20:31] empowering christians to keep all jesus
[20:34] commands
[20:35] whosoever believeth that jesus is the
[20:37] christ is born of god and everyone that
[20:40] loveth him that begat loveth him also
[20:43] that is begotten of him
[20:45] by this we know that we love the
[20:46] children of god when we love god and
[20:49] keep his commandments for this is the
[20:51] love of god that we keep his
[20:53] commandments and his commandments are
[20:55] not grievous
[20:56] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[20:59] the world and this is the victory that
[21:01] overcometh the world even our faith
[21:05] friend if you are seeking salvation
[21:07] through jesus christ and the filling of
[21:09] his holy spirit in your soul you can
[21:11] undoubtedly know you're doing the will
[21:13] of god
[21:16] god's known will through the holy bible
[21:18] is your spiritual food
[21:20] after a believer is saved he comes in
[21:23] contact with earth's greatest book the
[21:25] holy bible
[21:26] man begins to satisfy his soul's thirst
[21:29] to know god through daily reading of
[21:31] scripture
[21:32] while meditating upon his readings he
[21:34] finds more of the known will of god
[21:38] some of the following doctrines have
[21:39] been mentioned previously in this book
[21:42] but bear repeating to emphasize their
[21:44] place in your spiritual diet the known
[21:46] will of god
[21:48] let these commands as god's will
[21:50] be your meat or spiritual food
[21:53] jesus says my meat is to do the will of
[21:55] him that sent me and to finish his work
[21:59] jesus christ desires or wills all
[22:01] christians to
[22:03] experience sanctification or
[22:05] purification of thoughts and actions

[25:21] from charitable giving
[25:23] smoking drinking dressing and modestly
[25:25] and breaking the law put you out of
[25:28] god's will for your life
[25:30] it's possible you're learning about
[25:32] these commands for the first time
[25:34] if so know that it's god fulfilling
[25:36] prophecy from matthew 17 verse 11 acts 3
[25:40] verse 21 and malachi 4 verses 5 and 6.
[25:44] the lord promised to restore all
[25:46] biblical truths in the last days
[25:49] he loves you and wants you to know truth
[25:52] god orchestrated his mysteries to be
[25:53] finished in your lifetime so he could
[25:55] lead you to the revealed word for your
[25:57] day see chapter 13.
[26:00] he's getting his bride ready for her
[26:01] rapture wedding day
[26:03] god has made a way for you to know his
[26:05] plan to restore all things and be
[26:07] established in the present truth
[26:10] be like your messiah who focused on and
[26:13] sought after god's will saying i seek
[26:16] not mine own will but the will of the
[26:18] father which has sent me
[26:20] john 6 38 teaches christ's purpose for
[26:23] coming down from heaven was not to do
[26:25] mine own will but the will of him that
[26:27] sent me
[26:28] that's your purpose as well and peter
[26:31] says you lived for your own will before
[26:33] being saved but now that you're a
[26:35] christian you live for god's will that
[26:38] he no longer should live the rest of his
[26:40] time in the flesh to the lusts of men
[26:42] but to the will of god
[26:45] have a humble hungry heart like david
[26:47] who said teach me to do thy will
[26:50] in psalm 143 verse 10
[26:53] ask god for wisdom to understand his
[26:55] will and he'll bountifully give it to
[26:57] you
[26:58] ephesians 5 verse 17 states
[27:01] wherefore be not unwise but
[27:03] understanding what the will of the lord
[27:05] is james 1 verse 5 promises if any of
[27:08] you lack wisdom let him ask of god that
[27:11] giveth to all men liberally and
[27:13] upbraideth not and it shall be given him
[27:18] patience is the key attribute you need
[27:20] as you follow god's will god's order for
[27:22] answering prayers is ask in prayer do
[27:26] god's will
[27:27] wait and then receive the promise
[27:29] hebrews 10
[27:31] verses 35 through 38 declares this truth
[27:34] cast nine away therefore your confidence
[27:37] which hath great recompense of reward
[27:39] for ye have need of patience that after
[27:42] you have done the will of god you might
[27:44] receive the promise forget a little
[27:46] while and he that shall come will come
[27:49] and will not tarry now the just shall
[27:51] live by faith but if any man draw back
[27:54] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[27:58] the stature of a perfect man in
[28:01] connection to the known will of god
[28:03] through peter's stature of a perfect man
[28:05] teaching you can know your spiritual
[28:07] location in the known will of god
[28:09] hebrews chapter 4 types israel's journey
[28:12] from egypt to canaan as the christians
[28:14] growth from sinner to holy ghost-filled
[28:17] saint
[28:18] hebrews 4 verse 11 tells us to labor to
[28:21] enter into that rest as israel labored
[28:24] to reach canaan
[28:26] jesus says he gives us rest for our
[28:28] souls in matthew 11 29 which must be the
[28:32] holy ghost baptism he repeatedly urged
[28:34] his disciples to receive
[28:36] breathing receive ye the holy ghost
[28:39] just as moses joshua and caleb could
[28:42] know exactly where they were on their
[28:44] journey whether the baptism at the red
[28:46] sea the wilderness of sanctification at
[28:49] the border of canaan or crossing jordan
[28:52] so can you know where you stand with god
[28:55] chapter 5 explained god's eight-step
[28:58] plan for bringing christians from
[29:00] salvation to the new birth called the
[29:02] stature of a perfect man
[29:04] faith the first work of grace
[29:07] comes at the moment you get saved and
[29:09] water baptized in the name of the lord
[29:11] jesus christ
[29:12] then you begin the second work of grace
[29:14] called sanctification
[29:15] herein god imparts or adds more
[29:18] character attributes of his own life to
[29:20] yours
[29:21] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[29:23] godliness and brotherly kindness the
[29:26] third work of grace is the baptism of
[29:28] the holy ghost or god's charity his love
[29:31] coming to dwell in your soul
[29:34] remember paul said god has already made
[29:36] known to us the mystery of his will you
[29:40] know it's god's will for you to be saved
[29:42] faith
[29:43] sanctified
[29:44] virtue through brotherly kindness
[29:46] and spirit-filled born again with
[29:49] charity
[29:51] two principles governing god's
[29:53] progressive will for man
[29:56] after following god's known will being
[29:58] saved spirit-filled and obeying the
[30:00] bible doctrines
[30:01] you naturally begin to wonder what else
[30:03] god has in store for the rest of your
[30:05] life
[30:07] god's future plans for your life can be
[30:09] called the progressive will of god the
[30:11] plans are eternally known to god but
[30:14] unknown to you
[30:16] he reveals his future desires to you as
[30:18] you seek his guidance traveling on your
[30:20] earthly pilgrimage
[30:22] abraham is your example for seeking
[30:24] god's progressive future will
[30:26] god called him to leave his country and
[30:29] family and he didn't know where he was
[30:31] going
[30:32] hebrews 11 8 says abraham was called out
[30:35] and obeyed not knowing whether he went
[30:38] abraham obeyed the known will of god but
[30:40] god didn't tell him all the details
[30:42] about his travels nor his final
[30:44] destination
[30:46] abraham was content seeking god's
[30:47] progressive will daily and as a
[30:50] spiritual faith child of abraham you'll
[30:52] do the same
[30:53] be faithful to god's most recent
[30:55] revelation of his will until the next
[30:58] revelation comes
[30:59] as abraham live by faith moving from
[31:02] city to city you live from faith to
[31:04] faith from revelation to revelation from
[31:07] glory to glory
[31:10] two principles govern god's progressive
[31:12] will
[31:13] it'll align perfectly with his known
[31:15] will revealed in the holy bible and will
[31:18] happen in his ordained time and season
[31:22] god's future will always harmonizes with
[31:25] his known will expressed in holy
[31:27] scripture and also through the prophets
[31:30] satan's threefold temptation of christ
[31:32] in matthew 4 exemplifies this truth
[31:35] about obeying the known word
[31:37] one particular temptation was for christ
[31:39] to immediately rule over the nations
[31:41] rather than wait
[31:43] jesus knew he'd rule the nations at some
[31:45] point in the future but was it now
[31:47] how did jesus know god's progressive
[31:49] will in the exact moment of temptation
[31:52] jesus triumphed over the wicked one not
[31:55] by miracles but by obeying the known
[31:57] will of god
[31:59] which said to never worship anyone but
[32:01] god
[32:03] in second samuel 6 david attempted to
[32:06] bring the ark of the covenant into
[32:07] jerusalem but his first attempt failed
[32:10] causing uza's death for one reason he
[32:13] disobeyed the known will of god that
[32:15] said the ark must be carried on the
[32:17] shoulders of the levites
[32:19] david first put the ark on a new cart
[32:22] but when the oxen shook it and uza
[32:24] touched the ark to steady it god smote
[32:26] him
[32:27] three months after the tragedy david
[32:30] fully obeyed the known will of god
[32:32] pleasing god this time he again
[32:34] worshiped god with all his might in the
[32:36] same manner he previously did
[32:38] and brought the ark to jerusalem with
[32:40] joy in daniel 9 verses 1 and 2 daniel
[32:44] was seeking god to know his progressive
[32:46] will for his people israel
[32:48] how did daniel know god was going to
[32:50] soon move on israel's behalf and let
[32:52] them return to jerusalem
[32:55] verse 2 says he knew the 70-year exile
[32:57] period was about up due to reading
[33:00] jeremiah's books
[33:01] god's progressive will for israel was
[33:03] known by one prophet daniel through its
[33:06] harmony with another prophet
[33:08] jeremiah jeremiah's victory over the
[33:11] false prophet hananiah in jeremiah 28 is
[33:15] an example of god's progressive will
[33:17] aligning with his own previous
[33:18] prophecies
[33:20] how did jeremiah know hananiah was wrong
[33:22] by saying god would break
[33:23] nebuchadnezzar's yoke upon israel within
[33:26] two years
[33:27] he knew because god had already spoken
[33:29] the yoke would last 70 years through
[33:32] jeremiah's own lips
[33:34] showing a true prophet's prophecies will
[33:36] always agree with his previous
[33:37] predictions spoken in the lord's name
[33:41] applying this to your life means no
[33:43] matter how strongly you may feel about a
[33:45] potential decision first see if it obeys
[33:48] god's known will
[33:49] for example if you're a woman and
[33:51] someone pleads with you to cut your long
[33:54] uncut hair for any reason even to help
[33:56] make wigs for cancer patients
[33:59] you know not to
[34:00] because of god's known will
[34:02] rather than cutting your hair god's word
[34:05] says to lay your hands on the sick in
[34:06] prayer and ask for healing
[34:09] or if you're a married man and you're
[34:10] tempted to commit adultery with another
[34:13] man's wife or divorce your wife and
[34:15] remay or another you know it's not god's
[34:18] progressive will
[34:19] god's known will command you to remain
[34:21] married to one wife until death
[34:25] never trust a sign or wonder if it
[34:27] contains instructions that disagree with
[34:29] god's known will
[34:31] deuteronomy 13 verses 1 through 5
[34:34] expresses this lesson as moses tells
[34:36] israel not to follow a prophet who urges
[34:39] you to worship false gods even if he
[34:41] shows a sign or wonder that comes
[34:44] moses says it's a test of your love for
[34:46] god
[34:47] if you love god you'll always keep the
[34:49] known will of god as you're trying to
[34:51] discern his progressive will
[34:53] signs and wonders and the messages that
[34:55] follow must all harmonize with god's
[34:57] known will
[34:58] as exodus 4 verses 8 and 9 demonstrate
[35:01] god's signs have a voice or instructions
[35:04] that follow them and they will always
[35:06] point you to holiness and obedience
[35:10] perhaps you have a beautiful dream you
[35:12] think comes from god and it's allowing
[35:14] you to break his word jesus himself
[35:17] might appear in the dream but if the
[35:19] command is against scripture you know
[35:21] it's satan disguised as an angel of
[35:23] light
[35:24] don't trust any dream nor angel or
[35:26] preacher if they contradict jesus's holy
[35:29] words in the bible
[35:32] god works in specific times and seasons
[35:35] and his progressive will always aligns
[35:37] with his predetermined timing
[35:39] believers must obey god's known will and
[35:42] patiently wait until it's god's time to
[35:44] fulfill his promise you don't want to
[35:46] try and enforce god's will too early nor
[35:49] miss god's moment in which he wants to
[35:51] move
[35:52] one reason god rejected king saul was
[35:55] because he couldn't wait upon god's
[35:57] timing
[35:58] in 1st samuel 13 verses 8 through 14
[36:01] saul was told to wait seven days for the
[36:03] prophet samuel to come and offer
[36:06] sacrifices before battling the
[36:08] philistines
[36:09] towards the end of the time period saul
[36:11] took it upon himself to offer sacrifices
[36:14] encroaching into the prophet's office
[36:17] as soon as the sacrifices were offered
[36:19] samuel arrived and pronounced god's
[36:21] displeasure with saul forcing himself
[36:24] into an office not assigned to him
[36:27] saul by missing god's progressive will
[36:30] by a few hours lost out on generations
[36:33] of blessings
[36:35] david's adulterous sin with bathsheba
[36:37] happened when he was out of position in
[36:40] the season of battle
[36:41] second samuel 11 verse 1 tells that the
[36:44] kings went out to battle at a particular
[36:46] time of the year but instead of being in
[36:48] position in battle david neglected his
[36:51] position leading to his adultery with
[36:53] bathsheba and murder of uriah
[36:56] this serves as a lesson for christians
[36:58] to be in position or obeying all the
[37:00] known will of god in every season
[37:03] second timothy 4 verse 2 says preach the
[37:06] word be instant in season out of season
[37:09] reprove rebuke and exhort with all
[37:12] longsuffering and doctrine
[37:15] there is also great sin in refusing to
[37:17] act in god's season missing his leading
[37:20] and jesus rebukes a multitude for not
[37:22] discerning his supernatural ministry
[37:25] jesus chides the multitude in luke 12
[37:28] 56 saying ye hypocrites you can discern
[37:32] the face of the sky and of the earth but
[37:34] how is it that ye do not discern this
[37:36] time
[37:38] in my short time as a christian i've
[37:40] seen many erroneously attempt to predict
[37:43] the season of the rapture
[37:45] in 2011 the late herald camping rented
[37:48] billboards across america declaring the
[37:51] rapture would occur on may 21st 2011.
[37:55] it miserably failed
[37:57] the next year 2012 many believe the
[38:00] mayan calendar predicted the world's end
[38:03] but it came and went without a
[38:04] fulfillment
[38:06] blood moons in 2015 were next in line to
[38:09] predict the rapture but this phenomenon
[38:12] came and went without ending history
[38:14] thankfully spirit-filled christians are
[38:17] promised to know the time and season of
[38:18] the rapture based upon first
[38:20] thessalonians 5 verse 1 and don't spend
[38:23] their time trying to force the rapture
[38:25] season to occur
[38:28] service submission and suffering in
[38:31] god's progressive will
[38:33] new christians and sometimes seasoned
[38:36] ones
[38:36] often ask themselves about god's will
[38:39] for their relationships vocations
[38:41] locations ministries and gifts
[38:44] they say who should i marry or what job
[38:47] should i have many ask where should i
[38:49] live and what gifts has god given me
[38:52] these are legitimate worthy questions
[38:55] god knows you're considering and he has
[38:57] answers for all of
[38:58] them you'll have to ask god about some
[39:01] of these subjects and remember to honor
[39:03] the two principles for god's progressive
[39:06] will he'll never ask you to break
[39:08] commands in scripture and everything
[39:10] must be done in his season not yours
[39:14] before diving into knowing god's will
[39:16] for relationships and more understand
[39:18] service submission and suffering are at
[39:21] the heart of god's will for every life
[39:24] you are called to serve and submit to
[39:26] others
[39:27] david's life exemplifies service and new
[39:30] testament authors expound on christian
[39:32] submission and suffering
[39:35] serving others is at the core of your
[39:37] calling for each of these areas for
[39:40] example acts 13 36 states for david
[39:44] after he had served his own generation
[39:46] by the will of god
[39:48] fell on sleep and was laid unto his
[39:50] fathers and saw corruption
[39:53] david's vocation and location are easy
[39:56] to identify as god chosen to be king
[39:58] over all israel in jerusalem because he
[40:01] was a man after god's heart
[40:03] acts 13 verse 22 declares the very
[40:06] reason god chose david was because he
[40:08] knew david would do all of his will i
[40:11] have found david the son of jesse a man
[40:13] after my own heart which shall fulfill
[40:16] all my will
[40:17] david served god's will feeding
[40:20] protecting and judging israel for 40
[40:22] years
[40:24] david's marriage with bathsheba began in
[40:27] sinful disgrace but god still used this
[40:29] couple to serve his purpose in shaping
[40:32] israel's future
[40:34] their second son solomon was loved of
[40:36] the lord and later became the wisest and
[40:39] richest king of his time period
[40:41] at the end of david's life it was
[40:43] bathsheba's service to god her influence
[40:46] and efforts that stopped adenija from
[40:48] stealing the throne from solomon who
[40:51] eventually ascended to his kingly
[40:53] god-given authority
[40:55] david served god's purpose for both the
[40:57] music and military ministries
[41:00] in first chronicles 15 and 16 david
[41:03] established levitical worship using
[41:05] various instruments to continually and
[41:08] skillfully thank and praise god
[41:11] with his military david served god's
[41:13] purpose for expanding israel's borders
[41:15] to boundaries they were promised under
[41:17] joshua but never achieved until david's
[41:20] lifetime
[41:21] these victories were possible because
[41:23] david always inquired of the lord before
[41:26] battles
[41:27] and each time scripture records him
[41:29] seeking god before battle he was
[41:31] undefeated
[41:32] as you learn to humble yourself and pray
[41:34] before decision making you'll see
[41:36] constant victories as well
[41:39] history affirms david's gifts to write
[41:42] songs and prophecy served god's purpose
[41:45] for his life
[41:46] david contributed more than 70 of the
[41:49] 150 songs in the book of psalm many of
[41:52] which are sung to this day in christian
[41:55] churches worldwide
[41:57] described as a prophet in acts 2 verse
[41:59] 30 david served god's will to foretell
[42:02] many details of jesus crucifixion and
[42:05] resurrection nearly one thousand years
[42:07] beforehand
[42:09] it is also god's will that you submit to
[42:11] others beginning with god
[42:14] james 4 7 commands submit yourselves
[42:17] therefore to god resist the devil and he
[42:19] will flee from you
[42:21] then learn to sacrifice your selfish
[42:23] desires and submit to others
[42:26] ephesians 5 verse 21 says submitting
[42:29] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[42:31] god
[42:32] every christian should submit to godly
[42:34] leadership in their local church
[42:37] obey them that have the rule over you
[42:39] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[42:41] your souls as they that must give
[42:43] account that they may do it with joy and
[42:46] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[42:49] for you
[42:51] peter tells us submission to government
[42:53] is the will of god and silences those
[42:55] who criticize christianity in first
[42:58] peter 2 verses 13-15
[43:00] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[43:02] man for the lord's sake whether it be to
[43:04] the king as supreme or to governors as
[43:08] unto them that are sent by him for the
[43:10] punishment of evil doers
[43:12] and for the praise of them that do well
[43:15] for so is the will of god that with
[43:17] well-doing you may put to silence the
[43:19] ignorance of foolish men
[43:22] suffering is a necessary but often
[43:24] unwanted part of doing god's will
[43:27] as humans we need a renewed vision of
[43:29] suffering's purpose
[43:31] the lord has chosen suffering as your
[43:33] teacher and his lesson is obedience
[43:36] even god's spotless holy son jesus
[43:40] learned obedience through suffering
[43:42] hebrews 5 verse 8 declares though he
[43:45] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[43:47] the things which he suffered you know
[43:49] jesus is suffering during his gethsemane
[43:52] prayers but this scripture tells us much
[43:54] of his life was spent suffering for the
[43:56] gospel
[43:58] expect suffering in your earthly journey
[44:01] as all that will live godly in christ
[44:03] jesus shall suffer persecution
[44:06] there is no escaping suffering for
[44:07] christians as it's required for future
[44:10] responsibility
[44:11] if you hope to reign with and for christ
[44:14] in the millennium embrace your
[44:16] sufferings
[44:17] second timothy 2 verses 11 and 12 says
[44:20] it is a faithful saying for if we be
[44:22] dead with him we shall also live with
[44:24] him if we suffer we shall also reign
[44:27] with him if we deny him he will also
[44:30] deny us
[44:32] peter's first epistle constantly deals
[44:35] with your required suffering
[44:37] chapter 2 verse 20 claims god accepts
[44:39] you when you endure suffering with
[44:41] patience
[44:42] in chapter 3 verses 13-17
[44:46] the apostle tells you to be happy if you
[44:48] suffer for righteousness sake
[44:51] next first peter 4 verse 19 says to
[44:53] commit the keeping of your soul to god
[44:56] in constant well-doing when you're
[44:58] suffering according to god's will
[45:00] in the times god desires you to suffer
[45:03] remember the vast eternal benefits
[45:05] one benefit is your perfection or
[45:08] completion
[45:09] you'll never be what god intended you to
[45:11] be without a little suffering
[45:13] chapter 5 verse 10 reads but the god of
[45:16] all grace who hath called us unto his
[45:18] eternal glory by christ jesus
[45:20] after that you have suffered a while
[45:22] make you perfect establish strengthen
[45:25] settle you
[45:27] paul says all suffering is only
[45:28] momentary light affliction that produces
[45:31] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[45:34] of glory
[45:36] your suffering allows god's power to
[45:38] manifest through your life
[45:40] paul explains the following order for
[45:42] powerful instances of god's spirit
[45:45] suffering weakness then strength
[45:49] second corinthians 12 verses 1 through
[45:51] 10 provides insight on paul's physical
[45:54] sufferings from a satanic messenger to
[45:57] keep him humble
[45:58] after three prayer requests for it to be
[46:01] removed jesus tells paul his strength is
[46:03] perfect in paul's weakness
[46:05] paul then glories in his weakness
[46:07] because christ's power rested on him
[46:10] you also see how god's power is not
[46:12] always seen in healing the sick or
[46:14] raising the dead
[46:16] sometimes its power to give thanks in
[46:18] the midst of suffering and weakness
[46:20] in everything give thanks for this is
[46:23] the will of god in christ jesus
[46:26] it's through suffering that you develop
[46:28] intimacy with christ
[46:30] most christians want to know jesus's
[46:31] power but few his sufferings
[46:34] paul knew both were mandatory
[46:36] philippians 3 verse 10 tells you that i
[46:39] may know him and the power of his
[46:40] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[46:43] sufferings being made conformable unto
[46:45] his death
[46:47] how well do you want to know jesus
[46:49] enough to suffer for him
[46:51] if so you'll not only suffer for him but
[46:54] fellowship with him as he'll never leave
[46:56] you nor forsake you
[46:59] how to find the perfect will of god for
[47:01] your life
[47:03] romans 12 verses 1 and 2 provides two
[47:05] simple steps to finding the perfect will
[47:08] of god for your life i beseech you
[47:10] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[47:13] that you present your bodies a living
[47:15] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which
[47:18] is your reasonable service
[47:20] and be not conformed to this world but
[47:22] be transformed by the renewing of your
[47:25] mind that ye may prove what is that good
[47:27] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[47:32] observe in verse 2 that there is a
[47:33] perfect will and permissive will of god
[47:36] for your life
[47:37] the perfect will of god is full
[47:38] obedience to the word of god while the
[47:40] permissive will is a path of
[47:42] disobedience and compromise
[47:45] david says the word of god is the lamp
[47:47] unto our feet and light unto our path
[47:50] disobeying god's word and struggling
[47:52] through life in god's permissive will is
[47:55] like losing your light source in the
[47:56] dark and fearfully stumbling about
[48:00] jesus is the only person to ever walk in
[48:03] god's perfect will for his entire life
[48:06] but many saints recorded in scripture
[48:08] spent much of their lives in the perfect
[48:10] will of god such as abraham joseph david
[48:14] daniel and paul
[48:15] these men's lives are marked by constant
[48:17] obedience to god's commands their
[48:20] mistakes god allowed recorded in the
[48:21] bible show brief missteps into the
[48:24] permissive will of god with appropriate
[48:27] consequences but god's grace always
[48:29] guides them back into the perfect will
[48:33] all who willingly disobeyed god's word
[48:35] in bible records are examples of walking
[48:38] the permissive will of god
[48:40] four examples include cain balaam saul
[48:43] and hezekiah
[48:45] the first two men were lost the last two
[48:47] were saved
[48:48] satan inspires people into the
[48:50] permissive will of god for they choose
[48:52] their own will over gods
[48:55] lucifer said i will five times in isaiah
[48:58] 14 verses 12 through 15
[49:01] like christ and say i will do god's will
[49:04] not my will
[49:06] cain disdained god's perfect will
[49:09] requiring animal sacrifice before
[49:11] murdering his brother abel
[49:13] the son of the wicked one cain even
[49:16] turned down god's plea for his
[49:17] repentance in a personal supernatural
[49:20] encounter with the holy one balaam heard
[49:23] god's first command his perfect will to
[49:25] avoid visiting balak but prayed again to
[49:28] see if god would allow it the lord gave
[49:31] him permission to take the permissive
[49:32] will and go see balak but balaam was
[49:35] ultimately slain in disgrace for his
[49:38] sins
[49:39] king saul started his kingship in great
[49:42] victory and obedience but ultimately
[49:44] rebelled against god's direct commands
[49:46] causing him to lose out on god
[49:48] establishing his kingdom forever
[49:51] king hezekiah lived in the perfect will
[49:53] of god for much of his life but
[49:55] staggered into the permissive will of
[49:56] god when he asks for more years for his
[49:59] life
[50:00] once granted 15 more years hezekiah
[50:03] catered to the babylonian ambassadors
[50:05] showing them all the treasures in the
[50:07] lord's house
[50:09] the first step in finding god's perfect
[50:11] will is to present your body as a living
[50:14] sacrifice unto god
[50:16] paul says to consider god's mercy and
[50:18] then willingly offer your body to god
[50:21] for his service
[50:22] sacrificing opportunities to make your
[50:24] body feel good god won't force you to
[50:27] offer yourself but his mercy will plead
[50:29] with you to do so
[50:31] this means forcing your body to serve
[50:33] god when your body sin nature doesn't
[50:35] want to
[50:36] usually this equates to eating less food
[50:39] and eating the healthy kinds when you do
[50:41] and voluntarily starving your body at
[50:43] times called fasting by jesus in matthew
[50:46] 6 18
[50:48] benefits of fasting are many including
[50:51] powerful healing and deliverance focused
[50:53] to feed the poor and getting answers
[50:55] from god
[50:58] since you're a living sacrifice your
[51:00] altar is also your own personal cross
[51:03] in luke 9 verse 23 christ says
[51:06] if any man will come after me let him
[51:08] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[51:10] and follow me
[51:12] your cross is the loss of your desires
[51:15] for the next verse says for whosoever
[51:17] will save his life shall lose it but
[51:19] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[51:22] the same shall save it you must learn to
[51:24] let god lead your life every single day
[51:27] he will lead you only into holy
[51:29] separation not lust of the flesh
[51:33] also keep your body out of harm's way
[51:36] avoid all appearances of evil not
[51:39] walking in lasciviousness lusts excess
[51:42] of wine reveling banquetings and
[51:45] abominable idolatries
[51:47] keep your body out of bars sporting
[51:50] events concerts movie theaters and all
[51:53] sinful gatherings
[51:54] control your work hours as well
[51:57] satan has enslaved many a well-meaning
[51:59] christian into the idolatry of money
[52:02] making and position seeking
[52:05] indeed if you're to be a sacrifice and
[52:08] reasonably serve god's purpose for your
[52:10] life something has to die
[52:12] you must die daily as paul says i die
[52:14] daily
[52:15] remember your living sacrifice which
[52:18] requires a daily crucifixion of your
[52:20] lusts and selfish will
[52:23] secondly your mind needs renewed daily
[52:26] though our outward man perish yet the
[52:28] inward man is renewed day by day
[52:31] jesus says to seek the kingdom of god
[52:33] first so pray and read your bible first
[52:36] every morning reading your bible once a
[52:38] week isn't enough
[52:40] daily reading is essential to renew your
[52:42] mind
[52:43] this daily renewing of your thinking
[52:44] causes your spiritual transformation
[52:48] recall your mind has five channels
[52:50] conscience memory reason affection and
[52:52] imagination
[52:54] second corinthians 10 verses 4 and 5
[52:57] says any evil thought pattern or mental
[53:00] complex that exalts itself against god's
[53:03] word must be pulled down cast down and
[53:06] forgotten through the mighty weapon of
[53:08] god's word
[53:09] when satan floats a hurtful memory near
[53:12] your mind cast it down if you're
[53:14] building a complex by imagining
[53:16] someone's hatred for you and planning
[53:18] how to counter a possible attack pull
[53:21] down that sinful stronghold
[53:23] if you're affectionately admiring and
[53:25] coveting earthly riches
[53:27] cast on those thoughts and set your
[53:29] affections on things above
[53:32] yes the key to mind renewal is simply
[53:35] putting off old sinful thoughts or the
[53:38] old man and putting on the new man or
[53:41] new holy thought according to ephesians
[53:43] 4 verses 22-24
[53:46] that ye may put off concerning the
[53:49] former conversation the old man which is
[53:51] corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
[53:54] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[53:56] mind and that you put on the new man
[53:58] which after god is created in
[54:00] righteousness and true holiness
[54:03] give your mind holy to the word think
[54:05] upon all eight of paul's subjects
[54:08] whatsoever is true honest just pure
[54:12] lovely of good report virtuous and
[54:14] praiseworthy
[54:16] meditate all day and pray without
[54:18] ceasing
[54:20] you now see doing god's perfect will
[54:23] requires complete consecration of your
[54:25] body presented as a living sacrifice
[54:28] and mind daily renewed
[54:30] you know your being has three parts body
[54:33] mind spirit
[54:35] and soul
[54:36] but did you notice how paul never
[54:38] mentioned the soul of man in romans 12
[54:40] verses 1 and 2.
[54:42] the reason is because paul knew the
[54:44] christian soul was already housing god's
[54:46] nature sealed by his holy spirit which
[54:49] directs all actions
[54:51] a christian soul is already perfect
[54:52] before god it cannot sin for possesses
[54:56] god's own seed his life
[54:59] paul is showing you how to bring your
[55:00] two outward parts into subjection to
[55:03] your inner core your soul
[55:07] prayer is one indispensable tool to know
[55:09] god's will
[55:11] in jesus model prayer he says the daily
[55:13] pray for god's kingdom to come and his
[55:16] will to be done in earth as it is in
[55:19] heaven in fact jesus says this kind of
[55:21] consistent prayer will be hard to find
[55:24] on the earth at a second coming so be
[55:26] one of those faithful prayer warriors
[55:30] praying jesus's way through the holy
[55:32] spirit raises your faith
[55:34] and faith does the works god desires for
[55:36] your life jude 1 verse 20 states but ye
[55:40] beloved building up yourselves on your
[55:42] most holy faith praying in the holy
[55:44] ghost
[55:46] paul writes in ephesians 2 verse 10
[55:48] god created you to do his will or good
[55:50] works
[55:51] for we are his workmanship created in
[55:54] christ jesus unto good works which god
[55:56] hath before ordained that we should walk
[55:58] in them
[56:01] through your prayers you can support
[56:03] other believers in doing god's will
[56:05] paul's helper epiphanes had this special
[56:08] burden as a prayer warrior in colossians
[56:10] 4 verse 12.
[56:12] epiphanus who is one of you a servant of
[56:15] christ saluteth you always laboring
[56:18] fervently for you in prayers that ye may
[56:20] stand perfect and complete in all the
[56:23] will of god
[56:24] paul prayed similarly for the colossians
[56:27] for this cause we also since the day we
[56:30] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[56:32] and to desire that ye might be filled
[56:34] with the knowledge of his will in all
[56:36] wisdom and spiritual understanding
[56:39] if you can't do anything else to help
[56:41] others you can pray for them to do all
[56:44] the will of god
[56:47] proving god's perfect will in your
[56:48] relationships vocations locations
[56:52] ministries and gifts
[56:55] daily renewing of your mind leads to
[56:57] transformed living
[56:59] equipped with a transformed being
[57:01] a fully consecrated body and mind
[57:04] you can now prove god's perfect will for
[57:06] your life
[57:07] as he progressively reveals it to you
[57:10] you won't have to guess about it you'll
[57:11] know and do jesus's perfect will
[57:14] always diligently obey all the known
[57:16] will of god before deciding upon
[57:19] relationships vocations locations
[57:21] ministries and gifts
[57:25] relationships
[57:26] paul's first letter to the corinthians
[57:29] helps establish god's will for
[57:30] relationships
[57:32] chapter 7 addresses virgins the
[57:34] unmarried married and the widowed read
[57:37] the whole chapter for a complete
[57:39] understanding
[57:40] single believers should pray and seek
[57:42] god to know whether they have the gift
[57:44] to be single or whether they should seek
[57:46] marriage
[57:47] marriage is the second most important
[57:49] decision you'll make in life outside of
[57:51] salvation so pray fast and seek god
[57:55] before agreeing to mary
[57:57] quote james 1 verse 5 aloud in prayer
[58:00] and god will freely give you the wisdom
[58:02] to know whom to marry and when
[58:06] it's crucial to know that your vow to
[58:08] marry a person cannot be broken too
[58:10] often engagements become official and
[58:13] then are broken off
[58:15] this is sin because a promise or vow is
[58:17] what marries two people in god's sight
[58:20] matthew 1 verses 18 through 20 shows the
[58:23] power of the vow as the angel of the
[58:25] lord appeared to joseph in his dream
[58:27] called mary his wife and they were only
[58:29] espoused or engaged
[58:31] numbers 30 offers added insight on vows
[58:36] if you're single in committing
[58:37] fornication with your partner you know
[58:40] you are out of god's will
[58:42] it's not wise to jump into marriage with
[58:44] a partner just so you can have sexual
[58:46] relations without seeing if god is
[58:48] leading you to marry this person
[58:50] stop fornicating begin living in
[58:52] sanctification and wait upon the lord
[58:55] for his will
[58:57] if you are already in a marriage
[58:58] relationship and you wonderfully come to
[59:01] christ as a new convert paul says to
[59:03] stay married even if your spouse is not
[59:06] a christian
[59:07] he encourages you that your sanctified
[59:09] life may help win your spouse and
[59:11] children to christ
[59:14] notice paul emphasizes how marriage is
[59:16] about pleasing and serving your spouse
[59:18] through love
[59:19] when marriage infatuation ends let god's
[59:22] love motivate you to serve and please
[59:24] your mate
[59:26] malachi 2 verse 16 says god hates
[59:28] divorce and anyone who divorces and
[59:30] remarries another becomes adulterers
[59:33] and if left unconfessed keeps them from
[59:36] the kingdom of god
[59:39] jesus teaches the only occasion a person
[59:41] can remarry after divorce is a man who
[59:44] puts away his wife due to unconfessed
[59:47] fornication committed before marriage
[59:50] read matthew 5 verses 31 and 32 and
[59:53] matthew 19 verses 1 through 9 for more
[59:56] on this
[59:58] this one and only divorce and remarry
[1:00:01] clause exist because the woman made a
[1:00:03] false vow claiming to be pure when she
[1:00:06] wasn't joseph and mary best teach this
[1:00:08] truth as he was going to put her way for
[1:00:11] fornication but god supernaturally
[1:00:14] intervened to validate mary's virginity
[1:00:17] adultery is not a cause for remarriage
[1:00:19] only unconfessed fornication according
[1:00:22] to jesus christ
[1:00:23] all marriage vows last until
[1:00:26] death god's will for parents is to
[1:00:29] diligently love teach discipline and
[1:00:32] provide for their children
[1:00:34] read proverbs 19 verse 18 proverbs 20
[1:00:37] verse 11 proverbs 22 6 proverbs 22 15
[1:00:43] proverbs 23 verse 13 proverbs 29 verses

[1:00:49] proverbs 29 verse 21 and colossians 3 21
[1:00:53] for these truths
[1:00:54] psalm 127 verses 1 through 5 proclaimed
[1:00:58] children are god's heritage possession
[1:01:01] rewards from his creative hand
[1:01:03] and are arrows you must sharpen
[1:01:06] increasing their godly character to
[1:01:08] defeat future enemies
[1:01:11] for all non-family relationships
[1:01:13] endeavor to live at peace with all men
[1:01:16] as much as possible have answers ready
[1:01:18] for those who ask about your faith and
[1:01:21] season them with grace
[1:01:22] jesus says bless and love enemies rather
[1:01:25] than cursing them overcoming evil with
[1:01:27] good
[1:01:30] vocations
[1:01:32] god's will for your job can be an urgent
[1:01:34] question for some
[1:01:36] know first that parenting is the most
[1:01:37] important vocation if you have children
[1:01:40] never abandon your child the rod and
[1:01:43] reproof give wisdom but a child left to
[1:01:45] himself bringeth his mother to shame
[1:01:48] if the choice is between more money
[1:01:50] through a job or staying at home to
[1:01:52] parent your children and have less
[1:01:54] choose less in the natural and more in
[1:01:56] the spiritual you can work the rest of
[1:01:58] your life after your children grow up
[1:02:01] love and invest in your children's souls
[1:02:03] while there is hope proverbs 19 verse 18
[1:02:07] admonishes
[1:02:08] chasten thy son while there is hope and
[1:02:11] let not thy soul spare for his crying
[1:02:15] as with relationships ask god for wisdom
[1:02:18] when deciding upon a vocation
[1:02:20] if you love god he'll use your choices
[1:02:23] for his glory and all will work together
[1:02:25] for your good be open to god doing
[1:02:28] something different from your first
[1:02:29] plans you might follow in your parents
[1:02:32] footsteps like jesus working as a
[1:02:34] carpenter
[1:02:35] paul made and sold tents
[1:02:37] luke was a physician matthew was a tax
[1:02:39] collector peter was a fisherman and
[1:02:42] lydia was a seller of purple god will
[1:02:44] provide a vocation for you too
[1:02:48] no matter the vocation god's will is for
[1:02:50] you to work diligently as if you're
[1:02:52] working for him
[1:02:54] ecclesiastes 9 verse 10 says whatsoever
[1:02:57] thy hand findeth to do do it with thy
[1:03:00] might for there is no work nor device
[1:03:02] nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave
[1:03:06] wither thou goest
[1:03:08] paul expresses the same urgency in
[1:03:09] romans 12 verse 11
[1:03:12] not lawful in business
[1:03:14] fervent in spirit serving the lord
[1:03:17] ephesians 6 verse 6 records paul's
[1:03:19] instructions for servants to serve from
[1:03:22] their hearts
[1:03:23] not with eye service as men pleasers but
[1:03:26] as the servants of christ doing the will
[1:03:28] of god from the heart
[1:03:31] always remember your vocation is not
[1:03:33] given you to become rich
[1:03:35] it's not a sin to be wealthy nor to be
[1:03:37] poor but god's goal for you is
[1:03:39] contentment
[1:03:41] first timothy 6 6 teaches but godliness
[1:03:44] with contentment is great gain
[1:03:46] money is a means to an end the end is
[1:03:49] loving god and your fellow man
[1:03:51] god loves a cheerful giver
[1:03:55] locations
[1:03:57] where should you live
[1:03:58] this answer is most often determined by
[1:04:00] your vocation but no god determined your
[1:04:03] physical location so you would learn to
[1:04:06] seek him acts 17 verses 26 and 27
[1:04:10] declares
[1:04:11] and hath made of one blood all nations
[1:04:13] of men for to dwell on all the face of
[1:04:16] the earth and hath determined the times
[1:04:18] before appointed and the bounds of their
[1:04:21] habitation that they should seek the
[1:04:23] lord if haply they might feel after him
[1:04:25] and find him though he be not far from
[1:04:28] every one of us
[1:04:30] god determined your starting location so
[1:04:33] trust him to guide all the places you'll
[1:04:35] inhabit
[1:04:36] you might never leave the region of your
[1:04:38] birth
[1:04:38] or there may be surprises about your
[1:04:40] future dwellings
[1:04:43] abraham by god's will moved at least 15
[1:04:46] times
[1:04:47] from ur to egypt to damascus to hebron
[1:04:51] despite the constant activity from his
[1:04:53] many movings he was a friend of god and
[1:04:55] father of faith
[1:04:58] it wasn't easy for joseph when god
[1:05:00] allowed him to be sold into slavery at
[1:05:02] age 17. he was completely surprised and
[1:05:05] his life was turned upside down
[1:05:07] joseph was moved from canaan across the
[1:05:10] sinai peninsula to egypt
[1:05:12] god's purpose for joseph's life as
[1:05:15] savior of many lives caused his move
[1:05:18] all god-directed moves glorify god and
[1:05:21] position man for his service
[1:05:24] lot nephew of abraham demonstrates the
[1:05:27] importance of your physical location
[1:05:29] in genesis 13 lot and abraham agreed
[1:05:33] they could not live together due to
[1:05:34] spacing limits so lot chose the
[1:05:37] well-watered plains of jordan and
[1:05:39] pitched his tent towards sodom this
[1:05:41] turned out to be a disastrous choice as
[1:05:44] eventually he lost his wife
[1:05:46] turned into a pillar of salt
[1:05:48] and other family members in fire and
[1:05:50] brimstone
[1:05:51] lot's location choice seemed to be made
[1:05:53] upon financial prospects only he may
[1:05:56] have prospered financially but suffered
[1:05:59] great loss spiritually he was daily
[1:06:01] vexed by the things he saw and heard
[1:06:03] especially the violent homosexual
[1:06:05] lifestyle of sodom's men
[1:06:07] choose to put your family among godly
[1:06:09] people and influences even if it means
[1:06:12] less money and benefits
[1:06:15] let your place of worship your home
[1:06:17] church be a major factor in your
[1:06:19] location
[1:06:20] frequent increasing gathering with
[1:06:22] christians while hearing live preaching
[1:06:25] from the fivefold ministry is god's will
[1:06:26] for your life so choose a location that
[1:06:29] allows you to fulfill this command
[1:06:31] satan wants to scatter the sheep
[1:06:33] congregation
[1:06:34] from their shepherd pastor so his wolves
[1:06:37] can devour the flock
[1:06:39] your location should allow you to have a
[1:06:41] pastor and church family you regularly
[1:06:43] serve and worship with
[1:06:47] ministries
[1:06:49] important christian ministries outside
[1:06:51] local church ministry
[1:06:53] include missionary work prayers and
[1:06:55] providing relief for the poor and needy
[1:06:58] ask god which ministry you are to
[1:06:59] support
[1:07:00] fulfill jesus command to seek first the
[1:07:02] kingdom of god
[1:07:05] god's will must be sought for each move
[1:07:07] in missionary work
[1:07:08] for instance some have said all
[1:07:10] missionary efforts are the will of god
[1:07:13] acts 16 verse 6 proves otherwise as paul
[1:07:16] is forbidden of the holy ghost to preach
[1:07:18] the word in asia
[1:07:20] while on a second missionary trip god's
[1:07:22] will for paul cut him off from doing
[1:07:24] missionary work in asia minor at that
[1:07:26] time
[1:07:27] acts 13 verses 1 through 3 shows paul
[1:07:30] fasting denying his body food before
[1:07:33] deciding where to go and who to take
[1:07:34] with him on his trips
[1:07:36] you must constantly see god's
[1:07:38] progressive will in every ministry
[1:07:40] effort for missionary efforts you'll
[1:07:43] find paul frequently leaning on god's
[1:07:45] will and timing for his visits
[1:07:48] he knew everything had to be done in
[1:07:50] god's time and season not his
[1:07:52] christians must recognize and accept the
[1:07:54] same
[1:07:55] paul tells the romans he's hoping for a
[1:07:57] prosperous journey by the will of god to
[1:07:59] come unto them with joy by the will of
[1:08:02] god so they could all be refreshed
[1:08:04] he wanted to visit his christian family
[1:08:06] but everything depended upon god's will
[1:08:09] his actual ability to visit provisions
[1:08:12] joy and refreshment
[1:08:14] your every missionary or evangelistic
[1:08:16] trip should follow this pattern
[1:08:19] prayer is a crucial ministry for saints
[1:08:22] as paul prayed and fasted before trips
[1:08:24] but all saints can join in praying to
[1:08:26] heaven for successful missionary efforts
[1:08:29] and general christian needs
[1:08:31] acts 12 records the unceasing prayers of
[1:08:33] the church during peter's imprisonment
[1:08:36] and in response god sent an angel to
[1:08:38] rescue him out of prison
[1:08:41] providing relief to the poor needy is a
[1:08:43] god called ministry referred to as helps
[1:08:46] in first corinthians 12 28. in the greek
[1:08:49] helps means aid relief jesus calls this
[1:08:53] almsgiving and saints like joanna
[1:08:55] tabitha phoebe and the macedonian
[1:08:58] christians are examples of relief
[1:09:00] ministries joanna wife of chuza herod
[1:09:03] steward
[1:09:04] teamed up with susannah and many others
[1:09:07] to provide food and other needs for
[1:09:09] jesus
[1:09:10] as he preached in cities and villages
[1:09:13] tabitha was full of good works and alms
[1:09:15] deeds making coats and garments for the
[1:09:17] needy paul urged the romans to assist
[1:09:20] phoebe in her business of securing or
[1:09:22] aiding the needy for she had previously
[1:09:24] helped meet paul's needs
[1:09:26] paul rejoices in the efforts of the
[1:09:29] deeply poor macedonians who sent paul
[1:09:31] and his ministry provisions
[1:09:33] scripture says the macedonians first
[1:09:35] gave themselves to the lord and then
[1:09:37] unto paul by the will of god
[1:09:39] this harmonizes with this entire chapter
[1:09:42] as you find god's will after you yield
[1:09:44] yourself completely to him
[1:09:47] this pattern of saints non-preachers
[1:09:50] helping and supporting preachers is
[1:09:52] foundational as seen in jesus ministry
[1:09:54] luke 8
[1:09:56] and in acts
[1:09:57] new converts saw such holiness in the
[1:10:00] preachers and cared so much for other
[1:10:02] believers that they laid financial
[1:10:04] offerings at the apostles feet assured
[1:10:06] the money would be used wisely for god's
[1:10:08] kingdom
[1:10:09] the twelve apostles in the early church
[1:10:11] soon ordained deacons through prayer and
[1:10:14] reports of honest men to provide relief
[1:10:16] to hungry christians in acts 6 verses 1
[1:10:19] through 8.
[1:10:21] take paul's advice and find within your
[1:10:23] home church a family who diligently
[1:10:26] serves the needy and then offer to help
[1:10:28] them
[1:10:29] first corinthians 16 verses 15 and 16
[1:10:32] says i beseech you brethren you know the
[1:10:35] house of stephanus and that it is the
[1:10:37] first fruits of a chao and that they
[1:10:40] have addicted themselves to the ministry
[1:10:41] of the saints
[1:10:43] that you submit yourselves unto such and
[1:10:45] to everyone that helpeth with us and
[1:10:47] laboreth
[1:10:48] stephanus's addiction to serving
[1:10:50] believers was a testimony that refreshed
[1:10:53] paul's spirit
[1:10:54] would to god adults and teenagers would
[1:10:57] be addicted to serving others by the
[1:10:58] will of god rather than suffering
[1:11:01] addiction to drugs and alcohol
[1:11:03] be like david serving your generation by
[1:11:05] the will of god
[1:11:08] gifts of the holy ghost
[1:11:10] paul lists the nine gifts of the holy
[1:11:12] ghost in first corinthians 12
[1:11:14] verses 8 through 10.
[1:11:16] gifts are extraordinary powers god
[1:11:18] bestows upon all to help all
[1:11:21] paul teaches gifts are given to every
[1:11:22] man to profit others
[1:11:24] romans 11 29 says god gives gifts and
[1:11:27] callings regardless of whether a person
[1:11:29] repents or not
[1:11:30] your gifts are in you before birth
[1:11:34] two people have told me they knew i was
[1:11:36] a preacher before i stepped into the
[1:11:38] pulpit to minister a high school friend
[1:11:40] said she saw a leadership gift in my
[1:11:42] life even when i was a sinner seven
[1:11:45] years before i began preaching
[1:11:47] years later a pastor's wife told me she
[1:11:49] knew i'd be a preacher the very first
[1:11:51] time we met well before i even
[1:11:53] considered preaching
[1:11:55] jeremiah 1 verse 5 is true god knew us
[1:11:58] before our birth and ordained us for his
[1:12:00] purpose
[1:12:02] since your gift is not for yourself you
[1:12:04] only operate it in love seek not to use
[1:12:07] your gift for your benefit but use your
[1:12:09] gift that sinners might testify to god's
[1:12:12] manifest presence
[1:12:15] god gives you a gift or gifts because
[1:12:17] there is a need for your service
[1:12:19] you'll never have to force your gift
[1:12:20] into a situation
[1:12:22] or church ministry because proverbs 18
[1:12:25] verse 16 declares a man's gift maketh
[1:12:27] room for him and bringeth him before
[1:12:30] great men
[1:12:31] your gift has a god-ordained place for
[1:12:33] it to fit into
[1:12:36] gifts edify or build the church and keep
[1:12:39] it clean
[1:12:40] paul says prophecy is greater than one
[1:12:43] person's ability to speak in tongues
[1:12:45] because it helps more believers
[1:12:47] i would that ye all spake with tongues
[1:12:49] but rather that ye prophesied for
[1:12:51] greater is he that prophesieth than he
[1:12:53] that speaketh with tongues except he
[1:12:55] interpret that the church may receive
[1:12:57] edifying
[1:12:59] peter's gift of discernment cleaned the
[1:13:00] spirit of deception out of the early
[1:13:02] church when ananias and sapphira tried
[1:13:05] to lie to him
[1:13:06] afterwards great fear came upon all the
[1:13:08] church and upon as many as heard these
[1:13:11] things
[1:13:13] many seek gifts like unknown tongues
[1:13:16] rather than the giver of the gifts jesus
[1:13:18] christ
[1:13:19] seek first to be born again and
[1:13:21] afterwards follow charity desiring
[1:13:23] spiritual gifts
[1:13:25] get born from above and god will
[1:13:26] naturally lead you to using your gifts
[1:13:29] first corinthians 14 verse 1 proves this
[1:13:32] follow after charity and desire
[1:13:34] spiritual gifts but rather that ye may
[1:13:37] prophesy
[1:13:38] you should not be ignorant of gifts and
[1:13:40] it is godly to desire the best gifts so
[1:13:42] that more saints are
[1:13:44] helped while everyone has a gift the
[1:13:47] apostle also stresses realistically
[1:13:49] assessing your portion of faith or
[1:13:52] whichever gift you possess
[1:13:53] our gifts have different measures of
[1:13:55] power your faith might move mountains
[1:13:58] while mine moves only hills
[1:14:00] romans 12 6 says to operate your gift
[1:14:03] according to the proportion of your
[1:14:04] faith
[1:14:06] another's gift of healing might cure a
[1:14:07] cancer case while another might relieve
[1:14:10] a headache
[1:14:11] in his wisdom jesus gave differing
[1:14:13] amounts of talents to each person and we
[1:14:15] must happily invest in our portion
[1:14:19] definitions and examples of the nine
[1:14:21] gifts
[1:14:23] all nine gifts will now be defined
[1:14:25] accompanied by both bible and real life
[1:14:27] examples
[1:14:28] the word of wisdom
[1:14:30] listed first by paul wisdom is the chief
[1:14:33] gift because it manages all others
[1:14:36] solomon says it is the principle thing
[1:14:38] god honors solomon because he asked for
[1:14:40] wisdom and wrote proverbs a treasure
[1:14:43] trove of practical wisdom
[1:14:45] however he had only the gift of wisdom
[1:14:48] and in his later years he failed to
[1:14:49] apply it to his life when his many wives
[1:14:52] turn his heart from the lord
[1:14:54] jesus christ is the fullness and essence
[1:14:56] of wisdom
[1:14:59] this ability sometimes referred to as
[1:15:01] sound advice manifests skill and
[1:15:03] discretion in timely decision making
[1:15:06] jesus says wisdom is validated by the
[1:15:08] results it bears saying wisdom is
[1:15:11] justified of her children
[1:15:13] the bible says wisdom hath builded her
[1:15:15] house and a wise man builds his house
[1:15:18] upon a rock like a project manager
[1:15:20] building a house wisdom tells you what
[1:15:23] to do and when to do it here are some
[1:15:25] examples
[1:15:26] jesus's answer about paying taxes to
[1:15:29] caesar and also giving money to god
[1:15:31] matthew 22 verses 15 through 22
[1:15:35] the wise virgins preparing extra oil for
[1:15:37] light in case the bridegroom tarried
[1:15:40] while the foolish neglected to prepare
[1:15:42] matthew 25 verses 1-13
[1:15:46] paul's perception to share his belief in
[1:15:48] the resurrection before a divided angry
[1:15:51] jewish council thereby saving his life
[1:15:54] acts 23 verses 6 through 11.
[1:15:58] a minister said i gave him a word of
[1:16:00] wisdom about how to decide upon and
[1:16:03] manage extracurricular activities for
[1:16:05] his children after he was wrongly
[1:16:07] accused of being an unfit father
[1:16:10] another minister said i gave him a word
[1:16:12] of wisdom to continue in his ministry
[1:16:14] when he had almost decided to give up
[1:16:17] the word of knowledge
[1:16:19] if wisdom tells you how to build a house
[1:16:21] knowledge is your raw building materials
[1:16:24] you need both to build a house so you'll
[1:16:26] find knowledge and wisdom associated
[1:16:28] together over 30 times in scripture
[1:16:31] knowledge is information from god
[1:16:33] usually a scripture from the bible
[1:16:36] another divine illustration is jesus
[1:16:38] calling knowledge a key allowing you to
[1:16:40] enter into the door of god's will in
[1:16:43] luke 11 52.
[1:16:45] knowledge is an understanding of god's
[1:16:47] word needed to possess his promises and
[1:16:50] escape satan's devices
[1:16:52] peter says we escape the pollutions of
[1:16:54] the world through the knowledge of the
[1:16:56] lord and savior jesus christ here are
[1:16:58] some examples
[1:17:00] peter and philip both gave scriptural
[1:17:02] knowledge citing joel 2 verses 28
[1:17:05] through 32
[1:17:07] and isaiah 53 verses 7 and 8
[1:17:09] respectively
[1:17:10] allowing 3 000 souls and the ethiopian
[1:17:13] eunuch to enter the door of salvation
[1:17:15] through repentance and water baptism in
[1:17:18] acts 2 verses 1 through 47
[1:17:20] and acts 8 verses 26 through 40.
[1:17:24] acts 19 verses 1 through 6 shows paul
[1:17:27] opening the door of the baptism of the
[1:17:29] holy ghost
[1:17:30] to 12 believers in ephesus who
[1:17:32] previously had no knowledge of the new
[1:17:34] birth
[1:17:36] after receiving the knowledge of first
[1:17:37] corinthians 6 verse 12
[1:17:39] god opened the door to my deliverance
[1:17:41] from tobacco addiction
[1:17:44] my wife gave me a word of knowledge i
[1:17:46] shared with the brother struggling to
[1:17:48] know whether or not he could be both a
[1:17:50] preacher and deacon setting him free
[1:17:52] from doubt and allowing god to use him
[1:17:54] repeatedly in supernatural ways in our
[1:17:57] assembly
[1:17:59] faith
[1:18:00] this gift is an assurance and inner
[1:18:02] substance of god's desire and power to
[1:18:05] move obstacles problems sicknesses or
[1:18:09] adversaries figuratively described as
[1:18:11] mountains by speaking god's word
[1:18:14] jesus teaches that faith a revelation of
[1:18:17] god's will about a specific work makes
[1:18:20] anything possible here are some examples
[1:18:23] jesus commends the roman centurion's
[1:18:25] great faith for requesting jesus to
[1:18:28] speak the word only for his servant's
[1:18:30] healing which happened the same hour
[1:18:32] matthew 8 verses 1-13
[1:18:36] paul and a crippled man in lystra both
[1:18:38] had faith for healing causing paul to
[1:18:40] loudly command the man to walk for the
[1:18:42] first time acts 14 verses 7-10
[1:18:47] a friend's gift of faith pronounced a
[1:18:49] barren couple would have a baby after we
[1:18:51] prayed for them and about a year later
[1:18:54] their baby boy was born on my birthday
[1:18:57] similarly one morning in prayer i felt
[1:18:59] led to command another couple's mountain
[1:19:02] of baroness to leave
[1:19:03] and less than a year later they embraced
[1:19:05] their godsend baby girl after months of
[1:19:08] battling a critical spirit on a couple
[1:19:10] in our assembly i felt led to stand by
[1:19:13] their seats while praying alone in
[1:19:15] church
[1:19:16] commanding the evil spirit to leave and
[1:19:18] 11 days later the husband and officer in
[1:19:20] our church
[1:19:21] abruptly resigned and left restoring
[1:19:24] peace
[1:19:26] a pastor friend of mine felt led to tell
[1:19:28] his friend to speak his faith in god's
[1:19:30] word regarding his hunting trip the day
[1:19:32] beforehand the hunter spoke an
[1:19:35] eight-point buck in faith and harvested
[1:19:38] it the next day
[1:19:40] the gifts of healing
[1:19:42] healing is the deliverance from the
[1:19:44] oppression of the devil from both body
[1:19:46] and mind as mental torment often causes
[1:19:48] physical ailments
[1:19:50] there are numerous gifts of healing such
[1:19:52] as laying on hands speaking the word and
[1:19:55] natural remedies
[1:19:56] divine healing isn't spontaneous which
[1:19:59] differentiates it from miracles here are
[1:20:01] some examples
[1:20:03] saul's mental torment from an evil
[1:20:05] spirit troubled his body but david's
[1:20:07] skillful heart playing cast the demon
[1:20:09] from him first samuel 16 verses 13
[1:20:13] through 23
[1:20:15] ezekiel 47 verse 12 declares leaves and
[1:20:18] plants can be used as medicine and figs
[1:20:20] were used to heal boils
[1:20:22] second kings 20 verse 7 isaiah 38 21
[1:20:28] jesus christ promises to heal the sick
[1:20:30] when we lay hands on them
[1:20:32] mark 16 verses 16 and 17.
[1:20:36] paul prayed and laid his hands on
[1:20:38] publius's father and he was healed of
[1:20:41] fever and bloody flux an intestinal
[1:20:43] infection acts 28 verse 8
[1:20:47] women on two separate occasions one in
[1:20:49] pennsylvania and another in our ohio
[1:20:52] church were healed of arm weakness or
[1:20:54] paralysis using jesus's keys to the
[1:20:57] kingdom in prayer
[1:20:59] after battling a throat sickness for
[1:21:01] over a week which hindered me from
[1:21:03] singing
[1:21:04] a visiting minister from india prayed
[1:21:06] for me and i left the church building
[1:21:07] with full ability to sing and praise god
[1:21:10] loudly
[1:21:12] as i preached on divine healing in the
[1:21:14] service my wife felt god reveal her
[1:21:16] healing from migraines
[1:21:18] and through faith and a healthier
[1:21:20] lifestyle has not suffered from them
[1:21:22] since
[1:21:24] the working of miracles
[1:21:26] these are instant spontaneous
[1:21:28] manifestations of healings or other
[1:21:30] phenomenon performed by faith
[1:21:33] galatians 3 verse 5 says
[1:21:35] he therefore that ministereth to you the
[1:21:37] spirit and worketh miracles among you
[1:21:39] doeth he it by the works of the law or
[1:21:41] by the hearing of faith
[1:21:44] jesus's innumerable healing miracles
[1:21:47] included stopping a woman's bleeding and
[1:21:49] delivering souls from life-threatening
[1:21:51] fevers
[1:21:52] other miraculous phenomenon included
[1:21:55] raising the dead turning water to wine
[1:21:57] and multiplying fish and bread
[1:21:59] more biblical and modern examples
[1:22:01] include
[1:22:02] casting out certain types of demons mark
[1:22:05] 9 verses 38-39
[1:22:08] jesus causing a lame man to walk and
[1:22:10] leap by the hand of peter and john
[1:22:13] acts 3 verses 1 through 11 and acts 4
[1:22:16] verse 16.
[1:22:18] using handkerchiefs paul had touched to
[1:22:20] drive out demons from the sick acts 19
[1:22:23] verses 11 and 12
[1:22:26] god's healing my mother from liver
[1:22:27] cancer as my father laid his hand upon
[1:22:30] her and prayed in jesus name in 1988
[1:22:35] while praying for the sick and guyana i
[1:22:37] witness god instantly heal a young
[1:22:38] mother from a kidney stone as well as an
[1:22:41] elderly man suffering from arthritis
[1:22:45] prophecy this ability foretells the
[1:22:48] future giving believers edification
[1:22:50] exhortation and comfort
[1:22:52] prophecies can be spontaneously
[1:22:54] pronounced aloud with thus saith the
[1:22:56] holy ghost
[1:22:57] like agabus in acts 21 verse 11
[1:23:01] or god can send a prophetic dream as he
[1:23:03] did with nebuchadnezzar in daniel
[1:23:04] chapter 2.
[1:23:07] when prophecies are pronounced in a
[1:23:08] public gathering they are to be judged
[1:23:10] by two or three witnesses according to
[1:23:12] first corinthians 14 verse 29 and 1st
[1:23:15] thessalonians 5 verses 19 through 21
[1:23:19] here are some examples
[1:23:21] jesus foretold peter's three denials
[1:23:24] matthew 26 verses 34 and 75
[1:23:28] activists prophesied a famine acts 11
[1:23:31] verses 27 through 28. philip had four
[1:23:35] virgin daughters who prophesied acts 21
[1:23:38] verse 9.
[1:23:40] in 2013
[1:23:41] a pastor friend of mine foretold the
[1:23:43] passing away of numerous preachers
[1:23:45] during that year
[1:23:47] my wife and i have had prophetic dreams
[1:23:49] come to pass warning individuals of
[1:23:52] satan's snares
[1:23:54] discerning of spirits
[1:23:56] this gift judges or distinguishes
[1:23:58] between the source or motivation behind
[1:24:01] actions prophecies or words
[1:24:04] all actions come from either the holy
[1:24:06] spirit or one of the many unholy spirits
[1:24:08] fallen angels
[1:24:10] and discernment identifies if it's from
[1:24:12] god or a demon whether a spirit of
[1:24:14] divination lying spirit or other
[1:24:18] discernment is the gift that judges
[1:24:20] publicly announce prophecies and
[1:24:22] interpretations of unknown tongues
[1:24:24] let the prophets speak two or three and
[1:24:27] let the other judge
[1:24:29] hebrews 4 verse 12 likens discernment to
[1:24:32] a sword that divides a man's soul and
[1:24:35] spirit and discerns the thoughts and
[1:24:37] intents of the heart
[1:24:38] god's word ministers to the unique
[1:24:41] individual needs of the body human
[1:24:43] spirit and soul see chapter 5
[1:24:46] discernment allows secrets of hearts to
[1:24:48] be made manifest
[1:24:49] below are some biblical and modern
[1:24:51] examples
[1:24:52] solomon used a sermon to reveal the good
[1:24:55] intentions of the real mother of a baby
[1:24:57] when another woman falsely claimed to be
[1:24:59] its mother
[1:25:00] first kings 3 verses 16-28
[1:25:04] jesus discerned both nathaniel's
[1:25:06] guileless spirit and the woman at the
[1:25:08] wells sexual immorality with six men
[1:25:11] john 1 verses 47 through 51 and john 4
[1:25:15] verses 4 through 29
[1:25:18] peter exercised a sermon by revealing
[1:25:20] ananias secret lie and simon the
[1:25:23] sorcerer's wicked heart condition in
[1:25:25] acts 5 verses 1 through 5
[1:25:27] and acts 8 verses 18-24
[1:25:31] paul says sinners will recognize god's
[1:25:33] spirit in a local church when their
[1:25:35] secrets are revealed through gifts of
[1:25:37] prophecy interpretation and discernment
[1:25:40] first corinthians 14 verses 24 and 25
[1:25:44] through dreams god gave a couple in our
[1:25:46] church discernment about the source of
[1:25:48] contention in a matter likening the evil
[1:25:51] spirit as a wolf acts 20 verses 29 and
[1:25:54] 30.
[1:25:56] god help me discern and deny a lying
[1:25:58] spirit on a former church member when he
[1:26:01] requested permission to share his false
[1:26:03] teachings in front of the church to draw
[1:26:05] away members after his group
[1:26:09] diverse kinds of tongues
[1:26:11] this gift allows believers to speak in
[1:26:13] unknown or known human languages or even
[1:26:16] tongues of angels
[1:26:18] jesus promised believers would speak in
[1:26:20] new tongues in mark 16 17.
[1:26:23] tongues may be given in public worship
[1:26:25] but only if they are interpreted and
[1:26:27] judged
[1:26:28] paul says publicly spoken tongues
[1:26:30] without interpretations create a
[1:26:32] barbaric insane atmosphere
[1:26:35] with no interpreter tongues are strictly
[1:26:37] for private prayer and individual
[1:26:39] edification
[1:26:41] first corinthians 12 30 says not all
[1:26:44] christians speak with tongues paul
[1:26:46] strongly supported prophetic interpreted
[1:26:48] tongues because they edify the entire
[1:26:50] church rather than just one believer
[1:26:54] on the day of pentecost the 120
[1:26:57] spirit-filled believers were speaking in
[1:26:59] unknown tongues so the hears from 17
[1:27:02] different regions could hear them in
[1:27:04] their own native languages
[1:27:06] all tongues were known and understood
[1:27:09] you can speak in an unknown tongue at
[1:27:11] the moment you're born again but it
[1:27:13] should be understood by here close by
[1:27:16] modern churches err greatly when they
[1:27:18] allow instant constant and uninterpreted
[1:27:21] tongues in public services
[1:27:23] leading to confusion and chaos which god
[1:27:26] does not author
[1:27:28] below is a list of examples where
[1:27:30] tongues were used appropriately
[1:27:32] while peter preached at corneos's house
[1:27:35] the holy ghost fell upon the hears who
[1:27:37] spoke in tongues and magnified god acts
[1:27:40] 10 verses 44-48
[1:27:44] paul laying hands on 12 ephesians who
[1:27:46] being filled with the holy ghost spoke
[1:27:48] in tongues and prophesied
[1:27:50] acts 19 verses 1-6
[1:27:53] in 2010 a visiting minister to our
[1:27:56] church spoke in an unknown tongue and
[1:27:58] interpreted it with three people
[1:28:00] testifying the message was a warning to
[1:28:02] them about their spiritual backsliding
[1:28:06] three other times our church has had
[1:28:07] unknown tongues spoken and we've prayed
[1:28:10] for interpretations as paul commanded in
[1:28:12] first corinthians 14 13 but none came
[1:28:16] and we are always open to more
[1:28:20] interpretation of tongues
[1:28:22] this gift directly connects to diverse
[1:28:24] kinds of tongues
[1:28:26] the examples above also apply to it
[1:28:29] begin seeking god first to be born again
[1:28:32] and afterwards seek to know his gift or
[1:28:35] gifts in your life
[1:28:36] paul says follow after charity and
[1:28:38] desire spiritual gifts
[1:28:40] you might have more than one gift as
[1:28:42] paul had multiple gifts including
[1:28:44] speaking in tongues miracles and divine
[1:28:46] healing remember with love is your
[1:28:48] motivation you're commanded to desire
[1:28:50] and covet gifts
[1:28:52] first corinthians 12 31 reads but covet
[1:28:55] earnestly the best gifts and yet show i
[1:28:58] unto you a more excellent way
[1:29:00] may you covet god's supernatural power
[1:29:02] and ministry in both your daily life and
[1:29:05] church services
[1:29:08] study god's way to use your gifts
[1:29:10] and prayerfully ask god to help you
[1:29:12] operate them
[1:29:13] after you double the impact of your
[1:29:15] spiritual gifts jesus will say well done
[1:29:17] thou good and faithful servant thou hast
[1:29:20] been faithful over a few things i will
[1:29:22] make thee ruler over many things
[1:29:24] enter thou into the joy of thy lord
[1:29:28] my testimony about finding god's will
[1:29:30] for my life
[1:29:32] reading my testimony about finding god's
[1:29:34] will may help you find his will for
[1:29:36] yours currently i'm 40 years old happily
[1:29:40] married with eight children my two
[1:29:42] vocations are teaching in public school
[1:29:44] and pastoring a small church
[1:29:46] humbly i truly believe with all my heart
[1:29:48] i'm living in god's perfect will for my
[1:29:50] life
[1:29:51] how did i get here
[1:29:53] relationship
[1:29:55] my wife and i joke we met in a sandbox
[1:29:57] because we were both long jumpers in
[1:29:59] track
[1:30:00] and began dating in 1998 at 17 and 15
[1:30:03] years old respectively
[1:30:05] we weren't saved at this point but we
[1:30:07] knew we shared a special bond
[1:30:09] after i left for college we both
[1:30:10] repented and gave our hearts to jesus
[1:30:12] christ on the same night completely
[1:30:14] unaware of it she and toledo and me in
[1:30:17] columbus
[1:30:18] we had obeyed god's known will for
[1:30:20] salvation but was it god's will for us
[1:30:22] to be married
[1:30:24] before our engagement we had been dating
[1:30:26] for over four years and we had seriously
[1:30:29] prayed asking god to show us his will
[1:30:31] for our relationship we were both open
[1:30:33] to god separating us as well since we
[1:30:36] wanted only his will
[1:30:37] after multiple conversations i had with
[1:30:39] pastors and married couples
[1:30:41] god's peace settled into my heart that i
[1:30:44] did not want to live without her
[1:30:46] i admired everything about her and knew
[1:30:48] her strengths would complement my
[1:30:49] weaknesses
[1:30:50] our wedding in june of 2003 still stands
[1:30:54] as the second happiest day of my life
[1:30:56] right after the day we were saved from
[1:30:58] our sins through faith in jesus christ
[1:31:02] vocations
[1:31:03] while on college visits i realized i
[1:31:05] didn't want to become a doctor as i had
[1:31:08] previously hoped completely naive to the
[1:31:10] workload
[1:31:11] after my first college semester in akron
[1:31:14] jesus wonderfully saved my soul but i
[1:31:16] was still undecided on my major
[1:31:18] trying course after course i joined a
[1:31:20] friend in a child development class and
[1:31:23] instantly fell in love with the
[1:31:24] classroom it became a joy to go to class
[1:31:27] and learn about teaching and learning
[1:31:30] in 2004 god supernaturally opened up a
[1:31:33] teaching position for me right out of
[1:31:36] college when jobs were scarce and
[1:31:38] despite hundreds of applicants seeking
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:41] multiple parents have told me having
[1:31:43] their child in my classroom was the
[1:31:45] answer to their prayers
[1:31:47] additionally the lord has inspired me to
[1:31:49] help lead two bible clubs one before
[1:31:51] school at the middle school
[1:31:53] and one after school at an elementary
[1:31:56] building
[1:31:56] hundreds of children and teens have
[1:31:58] heard the gospel of jesus
[1:32:01] my second job is pastoring as my friends
[1:32:03] and i started our own church in 2006 and
[1:32:07] i've served as the only pastor
[1:32:09] the reason i knew god had called me to
[1:32:11] preach was because i began to feel a
[1:32:12] strong burden to minister
[1:32:14] after receiving an invitation to preach
[1:32:17] i prayed and fasted asking god to
[1:32:19] clearly show me if he was calling me
[1:32:21] the lord answered in full assurance
[1:32:23] seconds before i began preaching jesus
[1:32:26] anointed a sister in the audience to
[1:32:28] give a loud word of discernment making
[1:32:30] known the very subject i was going to
[1:32:32] preach
[1:32:33] at the sermon's conclusion the altar was
[1:32:35] full of saints repenting seeking
[1:32:37] deliverance and more
[1:32:39] i've known it's god's will for me to
[1:32:40] preach ever since
[1:32:43] locations
[1:32:45] i've lived in only two ohio locations my
[1:32:47] entire life toledo and akron you know
[1:32:50] god brought me to college in akron
[1:32:52] before mercifully saving me but you
[1:32:54] might be surprised to know he used a
[1:32:56] full-ride football scholarship to do it
[1:32:59] being that my parents were divorced our
[1:33:01] family was poor and it was impossible
[1:33:03] for me to attend college without it
[1:33:05] being paid for
[1:33:06] i now see god's hand in the scholarship
[1:33:09] to move me away from all that i ever
[1:33:11] knew and loved
[1:33:13] this separation showed me my need for
[1:33:15] jesus's love and guidance and he was
[1:33:17] also providing a pastor for his small
[1:33:19] akron church
[1:33:22] after my 2004 college graduation and
[1:33:25] subsequent hiring at a local school
[1:33:27] district we started the church two years
[1:33:29] later
[1:33:30] i've never felt god's leading to leave
[1:33:32] this city but i am open to god moving my
[1:33:34] family according to his pleasure
[1:33:37] ministries
[1:33:39] my family's main ministry is providing
[1:33:41] three weekly church services to our
[1:33:43] akron church members
[1:33:45] a few my older children have began to
[1:33:47] serve in music ministry in which i also
[1:33:49] perform a small role
[1:33:51] i believe god gave me my eight children
[1:33:53] for song in the house of the lord and
[1:33:55] for service of the house of god like a
[1:33:58] man father of 17 children from the days
[1:34:01] of david
[1:34:03] it's my joy to do most of the preaching
[1:34:05] and all the church's deacon and
[1:34:07] financial work
[1:34:08] our church supports missionaries helps
[1:34:11] the poor needy and provides bible
[1:34:13] studies for new converts
[1:34:16] over the past eight years i felt led to
[1:34:18] work in video making and book writing
[1:34:20] ministries
[1:34:22] i waited on these ministries for almost
[1:34:24] 10 years
[1:34:25] but since investing heavily into these
[1:34:27] works god has given us wonderful
[1:34:29] testimonies of his spirit helping
[1:34:31] believers around the world
[1:34:34] gifts
[1:34:35] you've read some of the testimonies god
[1:34:37] has done through the gifts of my life
[1:34:38] whether in preaching or in faith healing
[1:34:41] or miracles jesus's words in john 15 5
[1:34:44] are my testimony to any good happening
[1:34:47] through my life
[1:34:48] i am the vine ye are the branches he
[1:34:51] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[1:34:54] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:34:57] ye can do nothing
[1:34:58] i am nothing without jesus
[1:35:00] absolutely nothing
[1:35:03] i can honestly say i feel unworthy
[1:35:05] during the times god has gently and
[1:35:07] mercifully used me to help others
[1:35:09] in the moment of any supernatural work
[1:35:12] jesus has captured my entire thought
[1:35:14] process and i'm just doing what seems
[1:35:16] right or natural
[1:35:18] as romans 12 verses 1 and 2 declares
[1:35:20] being used of god happens as i lay
[1:35:23] myself on his altar laying aside my
[1:35:25] thoughts time plans and preferences
[1:35:29] my dearest prayer is that i can always
[1:35:30] be his living sacrifice that he may be
[1:35:33] exalted more
[1:35:36] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[1:35:38] of god's will
[1:35:40] eternal life is the first and greatest
[1:35:42] reward for doing the will of god first
[1:35:44] john 2 verse 17 expresses and the world
[1:35:47] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[1:35:50] that doeth the will of god abideth
[1:35:52] forever
[1:35:53] living god's will in this short fleeting
[1:35:55] life entitles you to an unimaginably
[1:35:58] amazing eternal life to come
[1:36:01] a second reward is joining by the new
[1:36:04] birth and fellowshipping with god's
[1:36:06] eternal family
[1:36:07] jesus teaches your spiritual family is
[1:36:09] in fact your real family
[1:36:11] while preaching jesus was interrupted
[1:36:12] and told that his mother mary and
[1:36:15] siblings were seeking him
[1:36:17] jesus's answer about who is his true
[1:36:19] family astounds the hears
[1:36:21] mark 3 verses 33-35 says
[1:36:25] and he answered them saying who is my
[1:36:27] mother or my brethren
[1:36:28] and he looked round about on them which
[1:36:30] sat about him and said behold my sister
[1:36:33] and my brethren for whosoever shall do
[1:36:35] the will of god the same as my brother
[1:36:38] and my sister and mother
[1:36:41] doing god's will makes you a part of his
[1:36:43] forever family
[1:36:46] natural family relationships are
[1:36:48] important but pale in comparison to
[1:36:50] being in god's spiritual family you must
[1:36:53] love jesus your savior more than anyone
[1:36:55] else
[1:36:56] jesus knew his preaching would divide
[1:36:58] family relationships within houses but
[1:37:01] whosoever shall deny me before men him
[1:37:03] will i also deny before my father which
[1:37:05] is in heaven
[1:37:06] think not that i am come to send peace
[1:37:08] on earth i came not to send peace but a
[1:37:11] sword for i am come to set a man at
[1:37:13] variance against his father and the
[1:37:15] daughter against her mother and the
[1:37:17] daughter-in-law against her
[1:37:18] mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be
[1:37:21] they of his own household he that loveth
[1:37:24] father or mother more than me is not
[1:37:26] worthy of me and he that loveth son or
[1:37:28] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:37:30] me and he that taketh not his cross and
[1:37:33] fouleth after me is not worthy of me
[1:37:37] in this life you'll benefit from being
[1:37:39] in god's family when peter tells jesus
[1:37:42] he's left everything for him implying
[1:37:44] about his losses jesus informs him of
[1:37:47] his gains in mark 10 verses 29-30
[1:37:51] and jesus answered and said verily i say
[1:37:53] unto you there is no man that hath left
[1:37:55] house or brethren or sisters or father
[1:37:58] or mother or wife or children or lands
[1:38:01] for my sake and the gospels
[1:38:04] but he shall receive an hundredfold now
[1:38:06] in this time
[1:38:08] houses and brethren and sisters and
[1:38:10] mothers and children and lands with
[1:38:12] persecutions
[1:38:13] and in the world to come eternal life
[1:38:17] holy ghost-filled christians have great
[1:38:19] heavenly inheritances awaiting them but
[1:38:22] all inherit a loving family in this
[1:38:24] earthly journey
[1:38:26] more rewards for doing god's will
[1:38:28] include being blessed by god abiding in
[1:38:30] his love and assurance that jesus hears
[1:38:33] our prayers
[1:38:34] our lord promises those who do his will
[1:38:37] and teach others to do the same shall be
[1:38:39] called great in the kingdom of heaven
[1:38:42] as you confidently wait upon god's will
[1:38:44] for a little while you gain three more
[1:38:47] great rewards
[1:38:48] first you eventually receive the promise
[1:38:50] whether it's a bodily healing knowledge
[1:38:52] of whom to marry or financial supply
[1:38:56] hebrews 10 verses 35 through 38 notes
[1:38:59] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:39:01] which hath great recompense of reward
[1:39:04] for ye have need of patience that after
[1:39:06] ye have done the will of god you might
[1:39:08] receive the promise
[1:39:10] for yet a little while and he that shall
[1:39:12] come will come and will not tarry now
[1:39:15] the just shall live by faith but if any
[1:39:17] man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:39:19] pleasure in him
[1:39:22] while patiently waiting for god to make
[1:39:24] his progressive will known and manifest
[1:39:27] your promise the second reward of
[1:39:28] renewed strength isaiah 40 31 says but
[1:39:32] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:39:34] their strength they shall mount up with
[1:39:37] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[1:39:39] be weary and they shall walk and not
[1:39:41] faint
[1:39:42] hasty believers who try to force their
[1:39:44] will instead of waiting on god's will
[1:39:47] grow weaker in faith not stronger
[1:39:50] jesus strengthens your faith as you wait
[1:39:52] upon his time and season
[1:39:55] the third reward is understanding god's
[1:39:57] progressive will as paul describes in
[1:40:00] ephesians 5 verses 14-21
[1:40:03] with christ's light of understanding you
[1:40:05] walk precisely in god's will redeeming
[1:40:08] the time
[1:40:09] notice paul separates wise from foolish
[1:40:11] by their use of time
[1:40:13] just like jesus separates the wise and
[1:40:15] foolish virgins
[1:40:17] wise virgins use their time to do
[1:40:18] exactly god's will for their lives
[1:40:22] you can understand your purpose doing
[1:40:24] god's will
[1:40:25] moses says the same as paul telling
[1:40:27] israel that god's commands are your
[1:40:29] wisdom and your understanding in the
[1:40:31] sight of the nations
[1:40:33] your life makes sense as you read the
[1:40:35] bible for god's known will for your life
[1:40:38] and pray for his progressive will
[1:40:40] in john 7 verses 16 and 17 jesus says
[1:40:44] you gain a witness inside your being
[1:40:46] when you do god's will
[1:40:47] you'll feel know and understand true
[1:40:50] doctrine through the spirit's presence
[1:40:52] in your soul
[1:40:55] the consequences for rejecting the
[1:40:57] revelation of god's will
[1:40:59] the most serious consequence of
[1:41:01] rejecting god's known will is being lost
[1:41:03] to hell and eternally separated from god
[1:41:06] via the lake of fire
[1:41:08] jesus's teaching about true and false
[1:41:10] prophets in matthew 7 verses 13 through
[1:41:12] 29 explains the severe punishment for
[1:41:15] false prophets who have enough faith in
[1:41:17] god to operate their spiritual gifts
[1:41:19] correctly yet afterwards devote their
[1:41:21] lives to iniquity verses 21-23 read
[1:41:26] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:41:28] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:41:30] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:41:32] father which is in heaven
[1:41:34] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:41:36] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:41:38] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:41:41] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:41:43] and then will i profess unto them i
[1:41:45] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:41:48] work iniquity
[1:41:50] it's not enough to do miracles and
[1:41:52] operate spiritual gifts
[1:41:54] god wants simple humble obedience to his
[1:41:56] will both known and progressive the
[1:42:00] evils of these false prophets are the
[1:42:02] worst because they knew god's will and
[1:42:04] blatantly refused to obey loving sin
[1:42:07] more than righteousness
[1:42:10] a second consequence is unfulfilled
[1:42:12] potential which applies to the saved or
[1:42:15] foolish virgins who are truly christians
[1:42:18] but live with some disobedience to god's
[1:42:20] will
[1:42:21] they could have potentially attended the
[1:42:22] wedding supper but failed to prepare
[1:42:25] enough oil
[1:42:26] or live close enough to god's will to
[1:42:28] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:31] jesus also says they miss out on
[1:42:33] producing fruit likening them to having
[1:42:35] thorny hearts
[1:42:37] which care for the world riches and
[1:42:39] pleasures more than christ
[1:42:42] king saul is a prime example of falling
[1:42:44] short of his potential yet being saved
[1:42:47] samuel promised saw he would be saved
[1:42:49] with him in paradise after his death in
[1:42:51] battle but saul lost out on untold
[1:42:54] blessings wasting years embroiled with
[1:42:56] jealousy and murderous hatred for his
[1:42:59] son-in-law david
[1:43:00] god would have established saul's
[1:43:02] kingdom forever if only he had done his
[1:43:04] will
[1:43:06] a third consequence is inward confusion
[1:43:09] sadness sorrow and grief
[1:43:12] mark 10 verses 17-25
[1:43:14] records jesus offering the highest
[1:43:16] calling in the church apostle to the
[1:43:19] rich young ruler
[1:43:20] parallel passages prove jesus love this
[1:43:23] man as he kept nearly all the
[1:43:25] commandments but to gain god's will for
[1:43:27] his life and the eternal life he lacked
[1:43:30] jesus asked him to forfeit his trusts
[1:43:32] and riches which the man refused
[1:43:35] verse 22 says and he was sad at that
[1:43:38] saying and went away grieved for he had
[1:43:40] great possessions
[1:43:42] although he may have grown to possess
[1:43:43] even greater riches he would always
[1:43:45] possess an even greater sorrow for
[1:43:48] turning down eternal life he may have
[1:43:50] even kept the commands on giving his
[1:43:52] money in tithes and offerings to the
[1:43:54] temple which would have been a sacrifice
[1:43:56] but he always lived with the grief of
[1:43:58] loving money more than jesus
[1:44:00] obedience to god's will is greater than
[1:44:02] sacrifice
[1:44:04] you can live in the joy assurance and
[1:44:06] confidence of obedience
[1:44:09] conclusion
[1:44:11] god's power is limitless and he's
[1:44:14] predestined and ordained everything in
[1:44:16] human history and your life perfectly
[1:44:18] weaving his sovereign will with man's
[1:44:21] freemore agency he chose the location of
[1:44:24] your nativity that you'd respond to his
[1:44:26] loving invitation to be saved and know
[1:44:29] him intimately you might go from the
[1:44:31] shepherd's field to the throne like
[1:44:33] david
[1:44:34] or from pharisee fame to the prison like
[1:44:37] paul but you can trust jesus plan
[1:44:40] purposes timing and commands
[1:44:44] you easily identify god's known will by
[1:44:46] simply reading the bible but his
[1:44:48] progressive will is a mystery you must
[1:44:50] seek out for yourself
[1:44:52] it's not a maddening arduous task rather
[1:44:55] it's a joy comparable to a gold
[1:44:57] prospector who is guaranteed to strike
[1:44:59] it rich proverbs 2 verses 4 and 5
[1:45:02] illustrates if thou seekest her as
[1:45:04] silver and searches for her as for hid
[1:45:07] treasures then shalt thou understand the
[1:45:09] fear of the lord and find the knowledge
[1:45:11] of god
[1:45:13] it's like the queen of sheba enduring
[1:45:15] travel pains but eventually experiencing
[1:45:17] the indescribable joy of having all her
[1:45:20] questions answered by solomon in god's
[1:45:23] holy presence
[1:45:26] you're guaranteed to know god's will if
[1:45:27] you'll search for it as you seek him he
[1:45:30] promises to be found the infallible
[1:45:32] christ says everyone that asketh
[1:45:35] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[1:45:38] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:45:39] opened
[1:45:41] serve your family church community and
[1:45:44] generation by god's will live in the
[1:45:47] perfect will of god and pray like
[1:45:49] epiphanes for others to obey all of
[1:45:51] god's will
[1:45:53] lastly my prayer for you is everyday
[1:45:55] service to god's will like zechariah
[1:45:58] prayed in luke 1 verses 71-75
[1:46:02] may we serve him without fear in
[1:46:04] holiness and righteousness before him
[1:46:07] all the days of our life
[1:46:10] action steps
[1:46:12] number one do the known will of god
[1:46:15] first obeying every bible command
[1:46:17] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:46:19] the lord jesus christ if you haven't
[1:46:22] been saved
[1:46:23] then go through sanctification the
[1:46:25] second work of grace
[1:46:26] so you can be born again by the holy
[1:46:28] ghost in the third work of grace
[1:46:31] step two after the new birth develop the
[1:46:34] daily habits of romans 12 verses 1 and 2
[1:46:37] being a living sacrifice taking up your
[1:46:40] cross and allowing your renewed mind to
[1:46:42] transform your life
[1:46:45] step 3 before any decision
[1:46:48] relationship vocation ministry etc
[1:46:51] patiently wait on god's timing while
[1:46:54] keeping every commandment
[1:46:55] ask seek and knock and jesus will let
[1:46:58] you receive find your desire and open
[1:47:00] every door he wants you to walk through
