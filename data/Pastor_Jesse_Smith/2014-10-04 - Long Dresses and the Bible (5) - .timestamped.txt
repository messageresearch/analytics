[0:11] Greetings in Jesus Christ's holy name.
[0:14] The purpose of this video is to answer
[0:16] the following question. Why do some
[0:18] Christian women wear long skirts and
[0:21] dresses? This is a fair and honest
[0:23] question that a lot of people probably
[0:26] wonder but might not have the answer to.
[0:29] So it was our desire to humbly share by
[0:31] the Bible and by history why we believe
[0:35] God is asking Christian women today to
[0:37] present themselves in women's clothing
[0:40] which are long dresses and skirts while
[0:42] men are asked to present their bodies in
[0:44] clothing that only pertains to men which
[0:47] are pants.
[0:53] Let's more closely examine what the
[0:54] Bible teaches about crossdressing.
[0:57] According to two main scriptures, the
[0:59] Bible teaches that Christian women
[1:00] should wear long, loose, flowing skirts
[1:03] and dresses because they are modest and
[1:05] aren't designed to be sexually
[1:08] attractive. Deuteronomy 22:5 says, "The
[1:11] woman shall not wear that which
[1:13] pertainth unto a man, neither shall a
[1:15] man put on a woman's garment, for all
[1:17] that do so are abomination unto the Lord
[1:20] thy God." 1 Timothy 2:9 says, "In like
[1:24] manner also that women adorn themselves
[1:27] in modest apparel, with shamef faceness
[1:29] and sobriety, not with braided hair or
[1:32] gold or pearls or costly
[1:35] array." Starting with Deuteronomy 22:5,
[1:38] we learn that God considers
[1:40] cross-dressing an abomination. An
[1:42] abomination is a disgusting thing to
[1:44] God. God is well pleased when men and
[1:47] women dress differently, wearing
[1:48] different garments. Due to our
[1:50] Judeo-Christian principles, our nation
[1:53] was founded upon, we believe garments
[1:55] that pertain to men only are pants, and
[1:58] garments that pertain to women only are
[2:00] skirts and dresses. So, we believe any
[2:02] man who wears a dress or skirt is
[2:05] breaking God's command and is committing
[2:07] an abomination. Likewise, we believe any
[2:10] woman who wears a pair of pants is
[2:12] committing an abomination against God.
[2:14] But the sad part is most men and women
[2:16] are not even aware of this Bible
[2:17] teaching.
[2:19] A little later in this video, we will
[2:21] show how nearly all of America once
[2:23] believed and obeyed this Bible command
[2:25] of different clothing for males and
[2:27] females just 50 years ago, including
[2:30] companies like Macy's. Please stay
[2:33] tuned. Concerning Deuteronomy 22:5, most
[2:37] people will quickly try to point out the
[2:39] fact that it is found in the Old
[2:40] Testament, and so they claim that it
[2:42] cannot apply to us today because we are
[2:45] under the New Testament. While it's true
[2:48] we are under the New Testament, keep in
[2:50] mind that many Old Testament
[2:51] commandments, which some have called the
[2:53] moral law of God, are still in effect
[2:55] today in the New Testament. Such as
[2:57] God's commandments against lying,
[2:59] stealing, committing adultery and
[3:01] fornication, murder, and even God's
[3:04] continued desire for children to honor
[3:06] their parents. It is clear that some Old
[3:09] Testament scriptures have been fulfilled
[3:11] and are done away with, which some call
[3:13] the ceremonial law of God. These
[3:16] commands no longer require our actions
[3:18] of obedience like the keeping of holy
[3:20] days, circumcision, sacrificing animals
[3:23] for sins, and the entire ironic
[3:26] priesthood. Yet many Old Testament
[3:28] commandments are still in effect today
[3:30] as displayed
[3:31] [Music]
[3:33] earlier. So the argument that we don't
[3:36] need the Old Testament commandments
[3:37] today because we are not under the law
[3:40] will not work for every Old Testament
[3:41] scripture. And in the case of
[3:43] Deuteronomy 22:5 and crossdressing, it
[3:46] is clear by searching both the Old
[3:48] Testament and the New Testament that God
[3:51] never abolished or fulfilled this
[3:53] command. So, we believe Deuteronomy 22:5
[3:56] is still in effect today.
[3:59] If God is willing, we will soon produce
[4:02] a video to teach which abominations are
[4:05] still in effect, along with how the
[4:07] majority of the Ten Commandments are
[4:09] still eternal truths we must obey. So,
[4:12] please check back to our website for
[4:15] updates. Moving on to 1 Timothy 2:9,
[4:19] let's notice here that St. Paul commands
[4:21] women specifically to dress modestly.
[4:24] But of course, we know God wants men to
[4:26] do the same according to scripture in
[4:28] Mark
[4:29] 5:15. Modesty means dressing or behaving
[4:32] so as to avoid impropriy or indecency,
[4:36] especially to avoid attracting sexual
[4:38] attention. It also means not revealing
[4:41] or emphasizing the figure. Without a
[4:44] doubt, our sinful, ungodly American,
[4:47] westernized Hollywood culture loves to
[4:50] glorify and reveal both men and women's
[4:52] figures. But it is clear that it thrives
[4:55] on the woman's ability to attract sexual
[4:58] attention as seen by the $14 billion a
[5:01] year pornography industry and the 11
[5:05] billion a year movie
[5:07] industry. A godly Christian man and
[5:09] woman will strive to not attract the
[5:11] sexual attention of others by choosing
[5:13] to obey God's command and dress
[5:16] modestly. The way to do this is to wear
[5:18] loose- fitting clothing, layers of
[5:20] clothing, and clothing that covers more
[5:23] of the
[5:23] [Music]
[5:29] body. For nearly 200 years of our
[5:32] nation, the United States, we honored
[5:34] and kept many Judeo-Christian Bible
[5:36] standards, including separate garments
[5:38] for men and women, meaning no
[5:40] crossdressing.
[5:42] But because our country has backsliden
[5:44] and fallen away from its biblical
[5:46] foundation, as the Bible predicted in 2
[5:49] Thessalonians 2:3, 2 Timothy 3:es 1-8,
[5:53] and Matthew
[5:55] 24:22, the standards for a holy
[5:57] appearance have either been greatly
[5:59] diminished or even completely abolished
[6:01] among many church-going groups. Let's
[6:04] view what a few historical references
[6:07] teach us about when and why
[6:09] crossdressing has become acceptable.
[6:11] Despite the Bible command for separate
[6:13] clothing for men and
[6:15] [Music]
[6:17] women, laws against crossdressing
[6:20] existed in England at the end of the
[6:22] 17th century. For instance, a person
[6:25] could be hanged for dressing in clothes
[6:27] of the opposite sex.
[6:30] History says our ancestors were obedient
[6:32] to the word of God throughout the entire
[6:34] 17th
[6:36] century, 18th
[6:39] century, and 19th
[6:41] [Music]
[6:43] century. While legal restrictions were
[6:45] less severe by the 19th century, arrests
[6:48] and imprisonment continued to occur with
[6:51] exceptions being made only during
[6:53] certain festivals and holidays.
[6:57] Religious leaders cited a passage in the
[6:59] Bible, Deuteronomy 22:5, forbidding men
[7:03] and women to wear the clothes of the
[7:04] opposite sex. The general public
[7:07] believed the Bible edict. The legal
[7:10] system as well reflected these Christian
[7:13] beliefs. Just prior to the 1960s, around
[7:17] 1949 to 1959, history says pants and
[7:22] jeans were forbidden to be worn by
[7:24] females in schools.
[7:26] Sadly, everything changed toward the end
[7:28] of the 20th century in the mid 1960s and
[7:32] early
[7:34] 1970s. According to the ebook called
[7:36] fashion, the sexual revolution and
[7:39] women's lib, they borrowed more from
[7:41] men's fashion. The look slowly became
[7:44] widely accepted as an alternative to
[7:46] skirts and dresses.
[7:48] Furthermore, in the 1970s, we find the
[7:52] 1970s can be summed up in one word,
[7:55] pants. It was hard to believe that so
[7:57] recently, the length of a skirt was the
[7:59] most important fashion consideration on
[8:02] the part of the vast majority of
[8:03] American women. It is also hard to
[8:05] believe that in the early 1970s, women
[8:08] were not allowed to enter fine
[8:10] restaurants and clubs wearing pants.
[8:13] As the 1970s opened, many women began to
[8:17] wear pants. Pants sold so well that
[8:20] major designers added pants suits. In
[8:23] 1968, Levis's launched a division for
[8:26] gals. Some businesses began to accept
[8:28] female employees in pants. Macy's would
[8:32] not permit women employees in pants, but
[8:35] the First National Bank of Boston would
[8:38] if they continued to act like women.
[8:40] AT&T would keep an open
[8:42] mind. For the first time in America's
[8:45] fashion history, women began to have a
[8:47] real choice between dresses and pants.
[8:50] Any woman of the 1600s or 1700s never
[8:54] would have dreamed of pulling on a pair
[8:55] of
[8:57] breaches. Why did these changes
[8:59] happen? History says woman has all the
[9:03] desire to conquer worlds. History
[9:05] records that women were trying to
[9:07] conquer the man's world. And so in order
[9:10] to do this, they had to wear his
[9:13] clothes. To summarize this timeline, we
[9:16] can clearly see that the majority of our
[9:18] ancestors from England and through the
[9:20] times of the founding fathers of our
[9:21] nation were obedient to God's command
[9:24] for separate clothing for men and women
[9:26] in Deuteronomy 22:5. But at some point
[9:29] during the mid to late 1960s, the
[9:32] majority of American men and women have
[9:34] been disobedient to this command. The
[9:36] laws of our ancestors reflected their
[9:38] biblical views, punishing cross-dressing
[9:41] with death and imprisonment. Of course,
[9:44] we do not hope for a return to these
[9:46] laws and punishments. But we do pray for
[9:49] return of all God's children to the
[9:51] Bible teaching of Deuteronomy
[9:54] 22:5. Oh children of God, won't you
[9:56] return to obeying the holy words of our
[10:00] [Music]
[10:04] Lord? Hosea 4:6 says, "My people are
[10:08] destroyed for a lack of knowledge." For
[10:11] my own personal testimony, I was never
[10:14] aware of the Bible truths on long
[10:16] dresses and crossdressing. I had a great
[10:19] lack of Bible knowledge on this subject.
[10:22] But thankfully, God saw fit to reveal
[10:24] his truth to me about separate male and
[10:27] female clothing by his grace and his
[10:30] mercy. I find that most people I talk to
[10:33] about men and women's clothing fall in
[10:35] the same category that I was in not long
[10:38] ago. They are totally unaware of what
[10:41] God's word teaches on this subject. This
[10:44] ought to remind us of the days of the
[10:46] judges when there arose another
[10:48] generation that knew not the Lord
[10:51] according to Judges 2:10.
[10:54] Thankfully, today God is trying to
[10:56] remind the people of his testimonies
[10:59] that we read in the Bible. God is making
[11:02] the world aware of his word. As
[11:04] recently, the Today Show even testified
[11:07] about the truth of Deuteronomy 22:5 and
[11:10] God's desire for women to wear long
[11:13] flowing dresses and skirts.
[11:24] Following Proverbs, she learned to sew.
[11:27] This is
[11:28] hard. And made a few wardrobe changes.
[11:32] Deuteronomy 22 says that the Lord
[11:34] detests a woman who wears man's
[11:36] clothing. So to be on the safe side, you
[11:38] probably want to stick with flowing
[11:39] skirts like these.
[11:42] Furthermore, the most simple and obvious
[11:44] public witness of the truth of
[11:46] Deuteronomy 22:5 in our society today is
[11:50] probably the female symbol used on
[11:52] public restroom signs. A woman's symbol
[11:55] is a dress or skirt because at one time
[11:58] this nation honored Deuteronomy 22:5 and
[12:01] believed that a dress or skirt was a
[12:03] garment that only pertained to a woman.
[12:06] These signs are an undeniable, constant,
[12:08] and lasting symbol of the standards for
[12:10] separate clothing our country once held
[12:13] but forfeited nearly 50 years
[12:19] ago. In conclusion, we pray that you
[12:22] will sincerely study out the biblical
[12:24] and historical truths we presented and
[12:27] consider obeying God's commands on men
[12:30] and women's clothing. Jesus said man
[12:32] should live by every word that proceeds
[12:35] out of the mouth of God in Matthew 4:4
[12:39] which includes modest clothing and not
[12:41] crossdressing. We do not want to be
[12:43] guilty of not preaching the truths of
[12:45] Deuteronomy 22:5 and 1 Timothy 2:9. For
[12:49] then we would be taken away from the
[12:51] words of the book of this prophecy, the
[12:53] Holy Bible. And that comes with grave
[12:56] consequences according to Revelation
[12:58] 22:19.
[13:00] Won't you prayerfully consider
[13:02] presenting your body humbly and
[13:04] modestly, not trying to draw sexual
[13:06] attention or any other attention to
[13:08] yourself? Men, won't you prayerfully
[13:11] consider wearing men's garments only?
[13:14] Women, won't you prayerfully consider
[13:16] wearing women's garments only, which are
[13:19] dresses and skirts? Please know that
[13:21] nothing abominable will enter the holy
[13:24] city, the new Jerusalem. May God help
[13:27] each one of us to honor his word about
[13:30] separate clothing for men and women that
[13:32] we might enter that holy city. And there
[13:35] shall in no wise enter into it anything
[13:38] that defileth, neither whatsoever
[13:40] workketh abomination or maketh a lie,
[13:44] but they which are written in the Lamb's
[13:46] book of life.
[13:48] If you would like more Bible and
[13:50] historical teaching about separate
[13:52] garments for men and women, or if you
[13:54] are in need of garments that would honor
[13:56] God's commands in Deuteronomy 22:5 and 1
[13:59] Timothy 2:9, please contact our Akran
[14:02] fellowship. God bless you and may Jesus
[14:05] Christ be the desire of your heart.
