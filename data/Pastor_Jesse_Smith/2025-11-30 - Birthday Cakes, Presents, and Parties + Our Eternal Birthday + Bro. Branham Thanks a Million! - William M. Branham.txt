TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God, we just feel unworthy and to look upon this audience today and see this [music] birthday cake playing here. I'm sorry, Father. You forgive me. I [music] just can't talk. But I pray, God, that somehow somehow that this stream of divine love will help everyone. bless these people who has done this great thing. Father, &gt;&gt; thanks a million. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord [music] Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about birthday [music] cakes and birthday parties. I was asked if it's wrong to have a birthday party or give someone a birthday cake. [music] I think the answer is no. It's okay. It's fine to have a birthday party and to give someone a birthday cake as long as it's done humbly and not too extravagant because we want to be careful not to go overboard. We don't want to make anyone an idol and we certainly don't want to cause anybody to stumble and we'll talk about that here in the video by the grace of God. One brief story. When I first started pastoring, someone asked me about having birthday parties and so forth. And and I think this individual was against birthday parties, but I said just humbly, "What's wrong with taking one day out of the year or maybe two if you give Christmas gifts? What's wrong with taking one or two days out of the year just to show someone you love them, you appreciate them, and you're so thankful God has placed them in your life?" And that's why I held a few birthday parties for my children. But as I got older, I stopped holding birthday parties because I started having multiple children, many children, and it would be too many parties. But again, that's the conviction that was on my heart. What's wrong with having a party and just celebrating someone you love, care for, appreciate? None of us are guaranteed tomorrow. So, I don't believe with a humble, sincere Christian heart that it's wrong to give someone a birthday cake or have a party for them as long as it's done in humility and with a sincere heart by God's grace. Let's start with some scriptures here. I wrote down some scriptures by the grace of God. Titus 1:15 says, "Unto the pure all things are pure, but to unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled." So, if you have a pure heart, there's nothing wrong with having a birthday party or getting a birthday cake. You just want to make sure that your mind is pure. Your mind has no defilement. Your intentions are pure by God's grace. Second, we want to avoid legalism and not let your good things be spoken evil of. Paul talks about this in Romans 14, 16, and 17. Let not then your good be evil spoken of. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. So, if you held a birthday party for someone and you just wanted to express joy for their life and you're just thankful for their life, there would certainly be nothing wrong with that by the grace of God. As you'll see, brother Brand was given birthday presents. Brother Brand was given birthday cakes and he always said, "Thank you and God bless you." Third, we don't want to cause anyone to stumble even in the liberty of having birthday parties and birthday cakes. In other words, we don't want to make them too extravagant. Romans 14:13, "Let us not therefore judge one another anymore, but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way." So, I imagine it's possible if people overdid a birthday party, it might cause other people to stumble, maybe with extravagant gifts or worldly music or sinful birthday cards or something. I'm just trying to think of different things that the Lord wouldn't be pleased with, worldly things, carnal things. And then 1 Corinthians 8:12-13 says, "But when ye so sin against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend." I just always love this verse. Paul said with Christian liberties, "I'm not going to do anything that would cause a brother or sister to be offended as long as the world is standing." And that's quite a statement to make. In other words, Paul was willing to go to any lengths to keep someone from stumbling in their Christian walk. a weaker Christian. And so if you have a birthday party or get a birthday cake, you want to make sure it's humble. You don't want to cause anybody to stumble. Again, with extravagant gifts, excessive amounts of money being spent, excessive praise being given to the person. We're supposed to give honor and then double honor to those who labor in the word of God. But we shouldn't praise them. We shouldn't worship them. Every Holy Ghostfilled Christian knows what I'm talking about by God's grace. And then fourth, again, a warning verse is that Herod in Matthew 14:6 had a birthday and it was kept. And so, a lot of people will point to this verse and say, "Well, that's why we shouldn't have birthday parties." But what about the pure people? What about those who were thankful for Brother Bram's life and gave him birthday cakes, as we'll see in just a moment here. So, again, it's we should take it as a warning to keep celebration simple, spiritual, sincere, and reverent by the grace of Almighty God. And then fifth, be impartial with birthdays. He's not. And now I found as a pastor and then as a father of nine children, this is quite a challenge. You got to make sure you do the same amount of celebrating for each child and then for each member in the church by the grace of God. The Bible talks about in James 3:17 that we not to have partiality. The wisdom of God is pure, peaceable, gentle, easy being treated, full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy. So we want to make sure we treat everyone the same by the grace of God. We know the body of Christ is spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 and we should have the same care one body member for another. So now let's look at some quotes here by God's grace. There's two quotes about birthday cakes that I could find. It seems like brother Random got a birthday cake when he turned 47 in 1956 and when he turned 55 in 1964. But before I forget, um I made a video last year about how brother Brandon reacted to Christmas gifts receiving them and he always said thank you and God blessed you. He wished he could get everybody a gift in return but he couldn't afford it. So I'll leave a link to that video in the description. I think that'd be helpful. You see brother Brandham receiving gifts and he just appreciated the people and wanted God to bless them. So the first quote is from what is a vision April 8th am 1956. I used the details from this quote to make the AI generated thumbnail of brother Ram praying at a pulpit and somewhere around the pulpit was a birthday cake because brother Ram says a birthday cake is laying here. So, brother Ram says, "Shall we pray?" This is the beginning of the sermon to look upon this audience today and see this birthday cake laying here. I'm sorry, Father, you forgive me. I just can't talk. But I pray, God, that somehow somehow that this stream of divine love will help everyone. Bless these people who has done this great thing, Father. And I just ask that your blessings will be with us so great today until the whole building will be flooded with your glory. So, if I'm not mistaken, it seems like brother Ram is calling this birthday cake a great thing. And again, he's turning 47 years old here in Chicago. So, here's the first quote that I found about birthday cakes, and it was a positive thing. He was humbled. Sounds like he's almost crying. He was so overwhelmed by the love of the people. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Shall we pray? &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, we thank you for all your goodness to us. God, we just feel unworthy. [clears throat] And to look upon this audience today and see this birthday cake laying here, I'm sorry, Father, you forgive me. I just can't talk. But I pray, God, that somehow somehow that this stream of divine love will help everyone. Bless these people who has done this great thing, Father. And I just ask that your blessings will be with us so great today until the whole building will be flooded with your glory and and think at the very time looking at that deaf and dumb people passing by going to the other side. Oh, I pray God somehow do something in a great way for us today. We ask that in Jesus name. Amen. Next, in 1964, a trial, April 5th, he wanted to thank a lady and her husband who baked me a birthday cake and give it to me. Many of you has given me cards and things. Thank you very much. God bless you. And I like this. He said, "I hope you have we all spend an eternal birthday over yonder where we'll sit down. I want a 10,000 years with each one of you. Just sit down and talk." Now, I thank you for all that you've done. Beautiful quote here. Let's listen to the quote &gt;&gt; before I forget it. Uh, my son told me a while ago some little lady and her husband from Arkansas baked me a birthday cake and give it to me. Many of you is giving me cards and things I haven't even had time to get into yet. Thank you very much. God bless you and I hope you have a we all spend an eternal birthday over where we'll sit down and I want to I want a 10,000 years with each one of you just sit down and talk and we won't have any less time to talk than we did when we began. That's the truth. Now, I thank you for all that you've done. &gt;&gt; And here's three more quotes about birthdays in general. In 1956, April 7th there in Chicago, Brother M kind of makes a joke and talks about how he was getting birthday presents and he was hoping some of the birthday presents would be song specials such as German boy singing and then brother Ekberg singing Down from His Glory. He said that's his favorite hymn. Let's listen to the quote. The little German boys, I don't guess they're here tonight. They sang it this morning and it would just say, "I'm getting really birthday presents to hear brother Eckberg s down from his glory." That would be marvelous. And the reason I like that, it just expresses in the way I I love him. All right, how many loves that song? Let's see your hand. &gt;&gt; Just remember that's my favorite hymn. All Brother Ed. &gt;&gt; Second quote is again from Chicago, April 8th, 1956. What is a vision? The ram said, "A little girl, a little envelope in there and it was her tiths of about 8 cents, I think it was. She sent it to me for a birthday present. Her tithings." He said, "Oh God, richly repay you, my dear brothers and sisters." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing I can say, and this is not exactly what it says. Say with a prayer, God bless you. And if I never be able and God never lets me do it in this life to to show my appreciations for all these gifts from everyone. Even a little girl had a a little envelope in there and it was her tithings of about 8 cents I think it was. She sent it to me for a birthday present for her tithe. From that to these great presents here. Oh, God. Richly repay you, my dear brothers and sisters. I just I didn't think you really thought that much, haven't I? I do appreciate it. &gt;&gt; And the final quote is from the time is at hand. Again, 1956, April 8th. He said, "I was just thinking a few moments ago, I wish I could put on a list of names of all who had gave me a birthday present why I'd have a sheet of paper like that." And imagine he's talking about a large sheet of paper. And I just want to say this and surely you understand what I mean. Heartily God bless every one of you. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; I was thinking just a few moments ago, I wished I could uh put down a list of names of all who had gave me a birthday present and why I'd have a sheet of paper like that. And I just want to say this and surely you you understand what I mean. A heartily God bless every one of you. And I was undoing one of the little packages a while ago and a little pair of rompers fell out for my little Joseph and I oh I I just something in my heart. Did you ever get to a place where you couldn't express what you wanted? See and the only thing you know to do is just say God bless you. That's all I can say. Thanks a million. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, it's awesome to see how Brother M reacted to receiving Christmas gifts or receiving birthday gifts and presents. I hope it was helpful to you by the grace of God. Here in Leodysia, you know, it's 2025, almost 2026. We just got to be careful not to go overboard on birthdays and birthday gifts, birthday cakes and so forth. We just want the Holy Spirit to remind us to be humble, to stay humble, stay sincere, keep ourselves little, do not lift people up too highly. Do not get overextravagant. If we give gifts, if we have parties, do it by the leading of the Lord, by the grace of Almighty God, keeping all these attributes that we read about in the scripture. Purity, considering others feelings so we don't cause them to stumble, being impartial. As the Bible said, may God help us to redeem the time because the days are evil. It's okay to spend a little bit of time thanking people, honoring them, being grateful that God has given you, family members, friends, maybe church members, and one day by God's grace, we'll all have that eternal birthday together. And that's all possible by the blood of Jesus Christ through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. If you have any [music] questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may [music] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never [music] failed.
