[0:02] the Seven Seals seven trumpets seven
[0:06] bows three woes woman in the sun casting
[0:11] out of the devil of the red dragon comes
[0:15] between these times during the Great
[0:18] Tribulation period don't forget
[0:21] it greetings friends in the matchless
[0:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:26] purpose of this video is to go over the
[0:28] order of events during the seven-year
[0:29] great tribulation period This is a study
[0:32] I've invested years into I'm just going
[0:34] to do the best I can by the grace of God
[0:36] to put these events in order and I trust
[0:38] to be a blessing to you by God's grace
[0:40] hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride
[0:42] of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio
[0:44] USA and I defend the original Gospel of
[0:46] the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed
[0:48] to St Paul and then had to restore
[0:50] through Martin Luther John Wesley and
[0:52] the late Prophet William Maran brandham
[0:54] who lived from 1909 to
[0:56] 1965 I also defend brother bram's Godly
[0:58] Christian character this video is going
[1:00] to be a teaching video using quotes from
[1:03] God's Prophet brother brandom and of
[1:04] course many Bible scriptures to try to
[1:05] place the events of the Great
[1:08] Tribulation in the correct
[1:10] order let's start off with some quotes
[1:12] from God's Prophet brother
[1:14] brandham then we'll look at the events
[1:16] before the Rapture that we're
[1:18] anticipating then we'll look at the main
[1:20] Bible verses used to decide the order of
[1:23] events in the tribulation and then we'll
[1:25] look at the events of the
[1:28] tribulation first quote I want to look
[1:30] at is how brother Bram said there are
[1:31] certain events that pertain to Salvation
[1:34] some that do not and of course this
[1:36] topic of the events of the tribulation
[1:37] do not pertain to Salvation brother Bram
[1:40] even said this about the Rapture or the
[1:42] coming of the Lord Brother brandom said
[1:44] if we have different ideas about the
[1:45] coming of the Lord that's okay because
[1:47] it doesn't pertain to Salvation and
[1:49] salvation remember only comes through
[1:51] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:52] according to Romans chapter 3 because
[1:55] we're saved by grace through faith
[1:56] according to Ephesians 2 8-10 brother
[1:59] Ram says this in how can I overcome 1963
[2:02] he said but it doesn't pertain to
[2:04] Salvation it's pertaining to the coming
[2:05] of the Lord let's listen to the quote
[2:07] but I I can't agree with him because I
[2:09] don't see it but the it doesn't pertain
[2:12] to Salvation it's pertaining to the
[2:15] coming of the Lord he sees that the
[2:18] church has to go through the tribulation
[2:20] period for
[2:21] purification I say the blood of Jesus
[2:24] Christ purifies the
[2:26] church the next quote I want to read is
[2:28] from The Sixth Seal brother Bram said
[2:29] The Sixth Seal is the interruption of
[2:31] nature as we'll see with the seven
[2:34] trumpets and the Seven vials brother BR
[2:36] was speaking of the Great Earthquake
[2:37] spoken of in Revelation chap 6 in the
[2:41] section on The Sixth Seal brother Raam
[2:42] said then all nature was interrupted
[2:45] nature took a tumble let's listen to the
[2:47] quote we find out now John said I beheld
[2:50] when he opened the Sixth Seal there was
[2:53] a great earthquake then all nature was
[2:57] interrupted see God God's been doing
[3:01] great things like Healing The Sick and
[3:03] Open the Eyes of the Blind and doing
[3:06] great work but we find out here that
[3:09] nature tuck a
[3:11] tumble yes all nature look what taking
[3:14] place the the earthquake the sun went
[3:18] black and the moon would give its light
[3:20] the Stars Shook and fell and wow
[3:24] everything happened see right at the
[3:27] time of the opening of this six seal
[3:30] that's when it takes place right
[3:33] immediately after the announcing of
[3:36] those
[3:38] Martyrs the martyrs have been finished
[3:40] now you see we're right close into that
[3:42] hour now we could be at any time
[3:46] amen see because the church is just
[3:50] about ready to take its flight but
[3:53] remember when these things happen the
[3:57] bride won't be here
[4:00] just remember the bride's gone she don't
[4:03] have to go through any of it this is a
[4:06] time of tribulation of purification of
[4:09] the uh of the church it's put up on her
[4:12] for to go through it not the rde he
[4:16] takes his sweetheart out of the way
[4:18] that's her she done redeemed
[4:21] her see it's kind of a that's his own
[4:25] selection his own choice like any man
[4:27] that takes his bride next I want to
[4:30] share two quotes where brother Ram said
[4:31] there's one week left for Israel there's
[4:35] one week left for the Jews and I know of
[4:36] course there's many quotes during the
[4:38] preaching of the Seven Seals and after
[4:40] the Seven Seals where brother Ram said
[4:42] there's only half a week left or three
[4:44] and a half years but again I have a
[4:46] video on Daniel 70 weeks my
[4:48] understanding of that through quotes
[4:50] from brother brandham and also
[4:52] scriptures so I'll make sure I leave a
[4:54] link to that in the description but both
[4:56] quotes are from the 70th week of Daniel
[4:58] August 6 19 61 the first one he said one
[5:01] week left one weeks yet determined then
[5:04] a few paragraphs later he says we're at
[5:07] the end of the Gentile age then there's
[5:09] one more week left for the Jew is that
[5:11] right so let's listen to these two
[5:13] quotes well God did with the Jews just
[5:16] exactly what he said he would do and
[5:18] then 69 years uh it was 483 years but 69
[5:23] weeks one week left one week's yet
[5:25] determined now if these exactly was
[5:29] seven years years each one of the weeks
[5:31] and we've already had 69 weeks then we
[5:33] have the Gentile age and we're nowhere
[5:36] at the end of the Gentile age and
[5:37] there's one more week left for the Jew
[5:40] is that right and that's exactly seven
[5:42] years the next quote I want to read is
[5:44] from the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's
[5:46] visit to Daniel from July 30th evening
[5:48] service 1961 notice brother random says
[5:52] the Seven Seals seven trumpets seven
[5:54] vows three woses all take place during
[5:57] the time of the Great Tribulation period
[5:59] don't forget it now the reason I read
[6:01] this is because there's other quotes
[6:02] where brother random says the woses some
[6:04] of them have already happened or some of
[6:06] the trumpets have already been blown but
[6:08] this is the quote I believe is most
[6:10] accurate let's listen to the quote
[6:12] listen I'm closing the Seven Seals seven
[6:17] trumpets seven Bowes three woles woman
[6:22] in the sun casting out of the devil or
[6:25] the red dragon comes between these times
[6:29] during the Great Tribulation period
[6:32] don't forget it all these things take
[6:35] place during this time but here is the
[6:37] sixfold purpose of his coming do you
[6:40] believe it hallelujah what a glorious
[6:43] time lays in store for those who love
[6:46] the Lord I tell you friends we can't
[6:48] afford to miss that don't miss that for
[6:51] whatever you do be sure the next quote
[6:55] is from Feast of trumpets 1964 brother
[6:58] Bram said the 200 million demons that
[7:00] were loosed under the fifth trumpet were
[7:03] already loosed upon the Jews during the
[7:06] Holocaust and again I could be wrong on
[7:08] this but based upon the other quote I
[7:09] believe the fifth trumpet has not
[7:11] sounded yet and I'm basing that of
[7:12] course on another quote from Brother
[7:14] brandham Where brother brandham said the
[7:15] trumpets are only going to be sounded
[7:17] during the Great Tribulation period so
[7:19] let's listen to the quotes now now he
[7:22] loosed upon under that six
[7:26] seal these 200,000
[7:30] spiritual
[7:32] demons started in Rome Germany Hitler no
[7:37] over the Bible where they received never
[7:40] they received power as kings but wasn't
[7:42] crowned a dictator is not a Crown King
[7:44] just received power as a king notice
[7:49] 2,00,000 demons turn loose upon those
[7:52] Jews when they burn them they crucified
[7:54] them they put bubbles in their veins
[7:56] they kill them so they had no more gas
[7:58] to kill them with and they shot them
[7:59] until they had no more bullets to shoot
[8:01] with and they and they done everything
[8:02] they could do and they cremated their
[8:04] bodies and everything and hung on fences
[8:06] children and
[8:07] all innocent people because they were
[8:11] Jews they were done that
[8:14] way but God said he gave each one of
[8:16] them a role undeserving as it was but
[8:19] his grace to Blind them so we could see
[8:21] the seventh seal hasn't open yet you
[8:24] know that's his coming the next quote
[8:27] I'm going to play is from 1954 brother
[8:28] brand said
[8:30] the first wo happened in World War I and
[8:32] the second wo happened in World War II
[8:34] and of course I don't exactly agree with
[8:36] this quote I agree with brother Ram's
[8:38] other quote from the six-fold purpose of
[8:40] Gabriel's visit to Daniel that was 7
[8:42] years later brother Ram said the woes
[8:44] all take place during the Great
[8:45] Tribulation period And I don't believe
[8:47] we're living in the Great Tribulation
[8:49] period right now but anyways let's
[8:50] listen to these quotes just so the
[8:51] people are aware where brother R thought
[8:54] World War I was the first woe and World
[8:56] War II was the second woe let's listen
[8:58] to the quote there was three walls
[9:00] followed it the first one happened in
[9:03] World War I second one happened in World
[9:06] War II you see what we're going in now
[9:09] all right we're at the end of the road
[9:13] now by God's grace let's look at the
[9:15] events right before the Rapture that
[9:16] we're anticipating to happen these are
[9:19] the events I believe are now happening
[9:22] uh for the bride the world in Israel
[9:24] here's a screenshot I made I preached at
[9:27] our church a couple years ago for the
[9:29] bro what's happening right now is the
[9:30] maturation of the wheat laying in the
[9:32] presence of the sun according to Matthew
[9:34] 13:30 it's the uniting time of the bride
[9:37] with Christ Ephesians 4:13 2
[9:39] Thessalonians 2 ver1 it's a lamp
[9:41] trimming time Matthew 25 1-13 and it's
[9:45] Malachi 4 time turning our hearts back
[9:47] to the apostolic fathers Malachi 4 5 and
[9:50] 6 it's also time to eat the book and
[9:52] prophesy again Revelation 10: 8-1 it's
[9:56] also the finishing of the Great
[9:57] Commission Matthew
[10:00] 24:14 the end cannot come until all
[10:02] nations have heard the gospel now the
[10:05] events for the world is the maturation
[10:07] and binding of the tears and it's got to
[10:10] be so close it would deceive the very
[10:11] elect if it were possible according to
[10:13] Matthew 13:30 Matthew
[10:16] 2424 the world is also seeing birth
[10:18] pains which are Wars pestilences
[10:20] earthquakes famines according to Matthew
[10:24] 247 and 8 the Millennium is the birth of
[10:29] of a new day a new heavens and new earth
[10:32] so the world is going through birth
[10:34] pains right
[10:36] now and in Israel right now the events
[10:38] are happening as Israelis are returning
[10:40] to the Homeland according to Isaiah
[10:43] 111-12 Jeremiah 23 3-8 and Luke
[10:47] 21:4 and they're also preparing for a
[10:51] temple now the events that I believe
[10:53] will still be future right before the
[10:55] Rapture for the bride will be the
[10:57] squeeze according to revelation 13:16
[10:59] and Revelation 3:10 this is also known
[11:02] as the Mount Zion Showdown brother Bram
[11:04] told us in the church age book and also
[11:06] 1962 spoken word as Original Seed and
[11:09] then we're also waiting for the latter
[11:11] rain which is the final outpouring of
[11:12] the Holy Ghost rapturing Faith according
[11:14] to James 57 and Joel 2
[11:18] 23-26 which brother Ram spoke with thus
[11:20] sayith the Lord about the latter Reign
[11:23] and brother Bram said the fullness of
[11:25] the Pentecost will be in the bride due
[11:27] to the latter Reign thus sayith the Lord
[11:29] Joel 2
[11:31] 23-26 the world will be doing the
[11:33] squeeze of the One World Roman Le
[11:36] government according to Revelation 13:16
[11:38] Revelation 3:10 and Daniel
[11:41] 233 also I believe the world will see
[11:44] the fourth major Vision fulfilled the
[11:46] fifth major vision and the sixth major
[11:48] Vision fulfilled right before the
[11:50] Rapture and then perhaps with a question
[11:53] mark maybe we'll see Israel starting to
[11:55] rebuild their Temple I don't know if
[11:57] that'll be before the Rapture or after
[12:01] after Now by God's grace here's the
[12:03] Bible verses that allowed me to get to
[12:07] the order of the Great Tribulation
[12:09] period all the events in the Great
[12:11] Tribulation
[12:12] period first is revelation
[12:15] 7:3 which says hurt not the Earth
[12:17] neither the sea nor the trees till we
[12:19] have sealed the Servants of God in our
[12:21] foreheads this scripture is so
[12:24] important the Earth cannot be hurt not
[12:26] one tree not the sea the Earth can not
[12:29] be hurt until the 144,000 have received
[12:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost according
[12:34] to Revelation 7 but this is important
[12:36] because it places the blowing of the
[12:38] trumpets after the 144,000 Jews have
[12:42] been sealed with the Holy Ghost and
[12:44] that's because in Revelation 8: 7 the
[12:48] first trumpet sounds and a third part of
[12:51] the trees were burnt up all the green
[12:52] grass was burned up so this is why I
[12:55] believe the trumpets have not sounded
[12:56] yet there's never been a time on the
[12:58] Earth when all the green grass was
[13:00] burned up so those two verses together
[13:02] are my first point Revelation 73 and
[13:05] Revelation 87 the first trumpet has not
[13:08] sounded and cannot sound until after the
[13:11] 144,000 are sealed with the baptism of
[13:14] the Holy
[13:15] Ghost the second point is revelation
[13:18] 3:10 this tells us the bride will not be
[13:20] on the Earth when the mark of the beast
[13:22] is Lain
[13:24] down because Jesus said because thou has
[13:26] kept the word of my patience I will also
[13:28] keep thee from the the hour of
[13:29] Temptation which will come upon all the
[13:31] world to try them that dwell upon the
[13:35] Earth so I believe the bride will hear
[13:37] whispers about the mark of the beast but
[13:39] the bride will be raptured before they
[13:41] actually have to make a decision to take
[13:43] or reject the mark of the beast of
[13:44] course the bride would have rejected it
[13:46] but the bride won't be here according to
[13:49] Jesus's own words in Revelation
[13:52] 3:10 the next verse is revelation 12:14
[13:55] this says the woman Israel was given two
[13:57] wings of a great eagle that she would
[13:59] fly into the Wilderness where she's
[14:01] nourished for a time that's a year times
[14:04] two years and a half time so three and a
[14:06] half years from the face of the serpent
[14:08] this verse is important because God's
[14:10] going to protect Israel for the first
[14:12] three and a half years of the Great
[14:15] Tribulation period and this means the
[14:17] mark of the beast cannot be laid down
[14:19] during this time period because if the
[14:21] Mark was laid down then the 144,000 Jews
[14:24] would be killed because they would not
[14:25] take the mark of Rome and then they
[14:27] could not receive the Lord Jesus and
[14:29] receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost so
[14:32] again Revelation 12:14 tells me the mark
[14:35] of the beast cannot be laid down until
[14:36] the second half of the seven-year Great
[14:38] Tribulation period and the fourth and
[14:41] final verse I want to read is Revelation
[14:42] 11 veres 13 and 14 here we see the order
[14:46] of the second woe the second woe is the
[14:50] earthquake in Jerusalem that causes a
[14:52] tenth part of the city to fall 7,000
[14:55] people are killed in Jerusalem and the
[14:58] Bible says the second woe is passed
[15:00] behold the Third Woe cometh quickly so
[15:03] here we see the second woe has to be at
[15:05] the end of the first half of the Great
[15:08] Tribulation period so that means the
[15:10] first woe and the first six trumpets
[15:12] must be also during that first 3 and 1/2
[15:16] year period and we'll try to line this
[15:18] up here on a visual by the grace of
[15:20] God okay now let's uh look at a visual
[15:23] here of the timeline of the events of
[15:25] the 7-year Great Tribulation period And
[15:28] Friends of course I'm open to correction
[15:30] especially with this topic because it
[15:32] doesn't pertain to Salvation so in any
[15:34] area where I'm wrong please let me know
[15:36] I'll try to make some corrections
[15:37] perhaps I'll do a part two on this
[15:38] series we'll see by God's grace so I
[15:41] begin with this screen Daniel's 70th
[15:42] week or 7year tribulation period we can
[15:44] see the end of the church ages there the
[15:47] event that ends the church ages of
[15:49] course is the rapture that's the bride
[15:52] going up the catching away or Rapture of
[15:55] the Bride according to 1 Thessalonians
[15:57] 4:16-18 for Corinthians 15:
[16:03] 51-54 and after the Rapture of the
[16:05] Gentile bride We Begin this 7-year
[16:08] tribulation period called Jacob's
[16:09] trouble or the six seal we're taught so
[16:13] this red rectangle represents the first
[16:15] three and 1/2 years of the seven-year
[16:17] Great Tribulation period and this begins
[16:20] with the torment Ministry of Moses and
[16:22] Elijah because we're told the exact
[16:25] number of days they're going to minister
[16:28] 42 months mon or 3 and 1/2 years which
[16:30] is 1,260 days and notice what they begin
[16:33] doing they begin causing no rain and
[16:37] they turn water to blood there in the
[16:39] Jerusalem
[16:41] area next the second event would be the
[16:44] Pope's 7-year Covenant again this is a 3
[16:46] and 1 half year Covenant so this has to
[16:48] happen very closely around the same time
[16:51] the two prophets are revealed according
[16:53] to Daniel
[16:56] 927a shortly after that then I believe
[16:58] the temple will be rebuilt and they'll
[17:00] begin offering animal sacrifices
[17:02] according to Revelation 11
[17:06] 3-13 the fourth event would be Jesus
[17:09] revealing himself to and then sealing
[17:12] 144,000 Jews according to Revelation 71-
[17:15] 8 Zechariah 12: 10 all the way through
[17:18] 13 13:
[17:24] 1-6 then once Israel sealed as we
[17:26] mentioned earlier according to
[17:27] Revelation 7 3 and Revelation 87 then
[17:32] the trumpets can begin to sound the two
[17:34] prophets will call forth these trumpets
[17:37] which also include the first woe and
[17:39] this is revelation chapters 8
[17:43] and9 and to me this is when the sudden
[17:46] destruction prophecy after the peace and
[17:49] safety Mantra is going to be fulfilled
[17:52] according to first Thessalonians 5:3
[17:54] people are saying peace and safety peace
[17:56] and safety they have a seven-year
[17:57] Covenant Israel got their Temple but
[18:00] then these six trumpets will be sudden
[18:03] destruction that comes upon the whole
[18:05] earth because the torment Ministry of
[18:07] Moses and Elijah will first be only in
[18:09] the Jerusalem
[18:11] area but then after the Jews are sealed
[18:14] then the wrath of God will begin to be
[18:16] poured out upon the rest of the earth
[18:18] okay and that will finish the first half
[18:21] of the seven-year Great Tribulation
[18:22] period and here comes the next rectangle
[18:25] for the second half of the Great
[18:27] Tribulation period the second half of
[18:30] the 70th week in other
[18:31] words and I just summarized this last
[18:34] three and a half years as the seven
[18:35] vials and
[18:37] Armageddon the first event of this time
[18:39] period will be the death and Rapture of
[18:41] Moses and Elijah which includes the
[18:43] second woe that earthquake there in
[18:45] Jerusalem that kills
[18:46] 7,000 yet the remnant of Jews will see
[18:49] them resurrected and they'll
[18:54] Rejoice the seventh event would be the
[18:56] pope breaking his Covenant with Israel
[18:59] of course the pope won't be happy about
[19:01] that he's a Roman Catholic and when he
[19:03] sees these Jewish prophets resurrected
[19:05] that will make him angry he'll recognize
[19:08] the power of Jesus remember he's filled
[19:10] with Satan so Satan always hates the
[19:12] power of the Lord so that will cause the
[19:14] pope to break the Covenant with
[19:17] Israel the next event will be the
[19:19] abomination of desolation which
[19:21] according to uh Daniel 12:11 is 30 days
[19:25] after he breaks the Covenant and also
[19:28] that'll be 2 Thessalonians 2:4 in
[19:30] fulfillment where he sits in the temple
[19:32] of God claiming that he is
[19:36] God the ninth event will be the mark of
[19:38] the beast laid down now that he's
[19:40] sitting in the temple of God claiming
[19:41] that he is God he'll be able to lay down
[19:43] the mark of the beast according to
[19:44] Revelation 13
[19:48] 15-18 the 10th event is the vials
[19:51] numbers 1-5 will be poured out according
[19:53] to Revelation 15 16-11
[19:59] and then the 11th event will be the six
[20:01] vial poured out that dries up the
[20:02] Euphrates so the kings of the East
[20:04] probably China can come to Jerusalem
[20:06] according to Revelation 161
[20:09] 12-16 the 12th event is the great
[20:12] will be judged in the seventh vow by
[20:14] Russia brother Bram told us that thus
[20:16] sayi the Lord according to Revelation
[20:18] 16: 17 through 18: 24 this is called
[20:23] also the day of Wrath according to
[20:25] revelation 62-17
[20:28] these are just my thoughts next here the
[20:30] next this 12th event will also include
[20:33] Los Angeles Sinking by a mighty
[20:35] earthquake according to Revelation 1618
[20:38] the Bible said this would be the worst
[20:39] earthquake in human
[20:42] history then I also believe this is when
[20:45] the USA will be bombed which is brother
[20:47] Ram's 7eventh vision of the seven major
[20:49] Visions according to Revelation 16:20
[20:52] all the mountains flee away there's no
[20:54] more islands and this is all happening
[20:57] pretty simultaneously ly also because
[20:59] Revelation
[21:00] 188 says the will be judged with
[21:03] fire I know that refers to the Vatican
[21:06] City but also refers to United States
[21:07] because the United States is the Beast
[21:10] coming up out of the land according to
[21:11] Revelation 13
[21:13] 11-18 because there's only one beast
[21:16] that's the spirit of Rome so the United
[21:18] States has the spirit of Rome behind it
[21:20] again according to Daniel's
[21:21] interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's Dream
[21:23] from Daniel chapter 2 the feet of iron
[21:26] and Clay of course is the Catholic
[21:29] iron and the Protestant
[21:31] clay and the 13th event would be the
[21:34] battle of Armageddon this is where all
[21:36] nations come to battle at Jerusalem the
[21:38] kings of the north Russia Kings of the
[21:40] South I don't know who that would be
[21:42] maybe Egypt I don't know the kings of
[21:44] the East again likely China will be
[21:47] defeated by Jesus according to Zechariah
[21:50] 14 1-3 Revelation 1911 through 21 and
[21:54] Ezekiel chapters 38 and 39 remember
[21:57] friends in Ezekiel 39
[21:59] verse 9 it says it's going to take 7
[22:02] years for Israel to burn all the weapons
[22:04] of all these armies that came against
[22:06] Jerusalem and then in verse 12 of
[22:09] Ezekiel 39 it says it's going to take s
[22:11] months to bury all these slain
[22:14] soldiers then the next event the 14th
[22:16] event will be the fervent heat burning
[22:18] Heaven and Earth and this is preparing
[22:20] Ashes to be on the earth so the Saints
[22:22] the righteous can walk upon the ashes of
[22:24] the wicked according to Malachi 4 verse
[22:27] 1-3 and the fervent heat was spoken of
[22:30] is 2 Peter 3:
[22:33] 10-12 the 15th event I have on here is
[22:36] the seventh trumpet sounds because when
[22:38] this trumpet sounds It's the final
[22:39] trumpet and it says the kingdoms of the
[22:41] world have become the kingdoms of our
[22:44] God Revelation 11:
[22:48] 15-9 finally the millennial age will set
[22:52] in where Christ and his bride will rule
[22:56] for 1,000 years Kings and Priests upon
[22:58] the Earth in glorified
[23:02] bodies in
[23:04] closing friends hope this video was a
[23:06] blessing by the grace of God I spent
[23:08] years revisiting this topic again and
[23:10] again part of this timeline is in my
[23:12] 2021 book on the 12 New Testament
[23:14] Mysteries I thought it'd be helpful I
[23:16] thought it'd be very interesting to go
[23:18] through the scriptures and quotes from
[23:19] God's Prophet brother brandom and try to
[23:20] place these events in their correct
[23:22] order but again this doesn't pertain to
[23:24] Salvation I could be completely wrong on
[23:26] some of these events but this is a good
[23:27] exercise and rightly dividing the word
[23:29] of Truth and also helps us to watch and
[23:31] pray watch the world events pray watch
[23:34] Israel that's God's time piece so that
[23:36] we're ready to escape all these things
[23:38] that should come upon the Earth as Jesus
[23:40] said Luke 21:36 said watch ye therefore
[23:43] and pray always that you may be
[23:44] accounted worthy to escape all these
[23:46] things that should come to pass and to
[23:48] stand before the son of man so by God's
[23:51] grace let's keep watching let's keep
[23:52] praying let's keep on the full armor of
[23:54] God the Bible said having done all you
[23:57] can do stand against the Ws of the devil
[24:00] according to Ephesians chapter 6 and by
[24:02] God's grace if we stand and overcome the
[24:04] devil we'll stand before the son of man
[24:06] as Overcomers will be at the meeting in
[24:08] the air the catching away of the Bride
[24:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ before these
[24:12] awful tribulation events
[24:14] occur if you have any questions concerns
[24:17] or testimonies about this video please
[24:18] contact
[24:19] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[24:22] the desire of your heart
