TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation Church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put their accordion of prophecy. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer about seven questions about the new pope from the United States, Pope Leo I 14th. He was chosen about two weeks ago on May 8th, 2025. and I apologize for the delay. Our family has received a new baby daughter, so we're thankful for that. So, let's look at this topic here. By the grace of God, now these seven questions come from a accuser of the message or someone who doesn't believe the Bible- based ministry that God gave to the prophet of God, brother William Mary Brandham. So, I'm going to try to answer these with as much grace and brotherly kindness as possible here by the grace of God. The first question is apparently not every prophecy needs to be a thus sayith the Lord. Right now the defenders of the message have decided to innovate. They're creating their own prophecies. So my answer is no. True message believers do not create their own prophecies. As I said in my previous video, I don't know if the 1954 quote about the new pope from the United States was a prophecy. And I still believe that because there was no thus say the Lord. I believe it was just a general prophecy. I believe brother Ram just saw the connection between the spirit of Rome coming out of the United States in Revelation 13 11-18 and brother Brandham recognized if the spirit of Rome was going to be in the United States then it would require a American pope that would influence the United States. And the main reason I say that is because I don't know if this pope, Pope Leo I 14th, will bring about the forming of the image of the beast as the 1954 quote shows. So let me read that quote again. You probably heard it many, many times over the last two weeks or 3 weeks. I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of Church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy, then they'll form an image like unto the beast. So, brother makes it seem like the steps is the confederation comes together, the new pope is brought by the United States and then the image of the beast is formed. Now, it makes sense that the forming of this beast has taken years and years and years. As I even noted in a past video, I think 1966 was the first year the pope met with the World Council of Churches. It was right after brother Brandham passed off the scene or it might have been 1965, something like that. It was very striking to see that. So no, true believers are not creating their own prophecies. I personally don't believe this was a specific prophecy. I just believe it was a general prophecy. Brother Ram saw the prophecy and the connection with the United States being led by the spirit of Rome and therefore it would require a American pope. But I could be wrong. And so I also said then yes it's true not every prophecy has to be thus sayith the Lord because Paul in 2 Timothy 3:13 and Peter in 2 Peter 3:10 wrote prophecies in the Bible that did not have the words thus sayith the Lord behind them but those prophecies were part of scripture. Brother Ram's words are not scripture as he said in the sermon the unveiling of God 1964 because we cannot add one word or take away one word from the canon of scripture the word of God. This is a beautiful quote. I'll just put it up here on the screen. Brother Ram said, "A man was trying to catch him and said, "You would be eligible to write a Bible yourself, your word, if God is manifested. You have all the qualifications." But brother Ram said, "No, sir. It would be adding something to it or taking something from it. See, it's all in the word. You can't get out of that word. It won't leave the word. And God's spirit will never leave that word. It'll stay right with the word." And then brother Ram told us the way to know he was prophesying was that he would say the words thus sayeth the Lord or in the name of the Lord. This is from He cares do you care 1963. Brother Ram said I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to. There's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there's something that goes forth it will speak it. So brother Ram says always it will speak it. It's thus sayith the Lord even divisions or anything. So that's what I understand friends. Any prophet after the canon of scripture was fulfilled has to speak thus sayith the Lord or in the name of the Lord to know that it is a prophecy. And I could be wrong on that. That's just my thought at this moment. And then brother Ram said he had nothing on it from the Lord as far as the Martin Luther King Jr. racial situation. He said if I say anything from the Lord like that to you, it's always I'm speaking now. But when he speaks, I say, "It's not me, it's thus sayith the Lord." And I can't say it until he tells me. I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King. I don't know. I can't say. That's just my opinion. So, if we go back to the sermon where he talked about Martin Luther King Jr., the third exodus from June 30th morning, 1963. Brother Random thought Martin Luther King Jr. would lead millions into a death trap. He said, just like Hitler did. And he said, "And that's exactly the same thing." So, Brother Ram thought Martin Luther King Jr. and Adolf Hitler were doing the exact same thing. And he said, "And remember, I'm on tape. You'll see it after maybe after I'm gone." That's exactly what's going to happen. Them precious people will die down there like flies. And so, when they asked Brother Random about this the next month, he said, "I have nothing on it from the Lord, and it didn't speak thus sayith the Lord." So, it's not a prophecy. So here we can see how human prophets in their own human minds can be so dogmatic or think something exactly is going to happen. But yet when asked about it he said I have no thus sayith the Lord on it. So it's just my opinion. So Christians are allowed to have their own opinions. And the way you know it's an opinion is there's no thus sayith the Lord. But if there is a thus sayith the Lord that's a prophecy. And remember friends, when I made that video two weeks ago about the new pope, I noted brother Ram did not say thus sayith the Lord about a new pope coming out of the United States. So again, it's hard to tell if the 1954 new pope quote was a real prophecy. I still don't know if it was a real prophecy because it was so general. There was no thus sayith the Lord. And we don't know if this American pope now, Pope Leo the 14th, will be the official antichrist since that is what brother Ram's quote implies. Brother Ram's quote implies that once the new pope comes out of the United States, then it will form the image of the beast and all the churches will be drove together. So basically, Brother Rams implying when we get the new pope, they'll form the image of the beast that will drive us together for the rapture. So is this the time the bride's going to be driven together for the rapture? I don't know. No one knows. Unless we have a thus sayith the Lord, we don't know. So only thing we can do is just watch and wait and pray. All right. Second question. Which prophecy does this American pope quote fit into? And I said, I don't know. Brother Ram did not tell us a specific verse in the 1954 quote. I think it's a general prophecy about Revelation 13:11-18, which Brother Ram said was the spirit of Rome in the United States as early as May 1954. And then the new pope from the USA quote was in December 1954. So let's listen to that quote here from 1954 May. This is the earliest quote I can find on brother connecting Revelation 13 with United States. If you can find an earlier quote I would love to see that. I'd love to read that by the grace of God. It was in the mark of the beast May 13th 1954. Brother Ram said I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth. He's quoting Revelation 13. And then the thickness and multitudes of people's water. Then this is where there was no people, the United States. He had two horns like a lamb. Let's listen to the quote. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth. Not out of water, out of the earth. Then the sickness and multitudes of people is water. Then this is where there was no people, the United States. And he had two horns like a lamb. Two horns like a lamb. Not a lamb. What is it? It's our American buffalo. Amen. Sure. See, there he is. Two horns like a lamb. But then what did he do? He would had freedom of religion. First he acted like a lamb. He spoke like a lamb. But remember, he never did become an old lamb. He was a lamb. Amen. This country is only 150 years old, you know. just the lamb. And then he spake like a dragon and he exercised all the power the first beast had before him, the red dragon, and caused all that was on the earth to draw upon the earth to worship the beast whose deadly wound was healed. Amen. Look, and and he does great wonders so to make a fire come down out of heaven, the atomic bomb and hydrogen, a smart intelligent nation and so forth, deceiving the nations by these things. This United States will come to a time that church and state will unite together and Protestant and Catholic will throw their things together to fight communism. And it's exactly playing in the hands of what God said right here. Question three, what practical benefit does the 1954 new pope quote bring to the bride? Or is it just another prophetic scare? So again, this person's very critical of message believers. So I feel sorry for this person, but I can think of at least four reasons this is a benefit. Uh it helps us live closer to God as we're aware of the end time events. Second, it gives a better understanding of the book of revelation because now we can see since the beast since the spirit of Rome will be in the United States, it's likely the pope will have to be an American pope. Third, it gives more evidence that brother Bram was a prophet because who else was predicting an American pope? Out of the theologians, out of the politicians, very few people predicted that. Although I don't believe the new pope, quote, was an official prophecy. I've heard numerous reporters say that they believe there would never be an American pope. So the fourth reason it proves brother Ram had insight into the book of revelation as the United States is in revelation chapter 13. So we believe brother Ram received that revelation from God because most churches don't know the United States is in revelation 13. Fourth question. In which part of the apocalypse does this forming of the beast by the new pope from the United States appear? Well, the forming of it would probably take place right before the rapture. But according to Revelation 3:10, the mark of the beast is not laid down until the great tribulation period. Because Jesus said, "Because you've kept the word of my patience, I will keep you from the hour that will come upon the face of the whole earth." So before the rapture, we'll be hearing about this beast system forming. Can't buy or sell. We'll be hearing about it. There'll be a time of pressure, a squeeze time. We believe that's when the bride will come together. Jesus will come and rescue his wife off the earth. And then in the tribulation period, that's the time when the mark will be laid down. The fifth question, have the churches already gathered at the famous conference or the United Confederation of Church before the pope became American? And again, I don't know the answer to this question. I don't know if there was an official conference, an official confederation of the churches uniting. I don't know. But we do know that the World Council of Churches represents over half a billion Christians according to their website. Like to show the visual here. Now, this is from the about the World Council of Churches page. What is the World Council of Churches? a fellowship of 352 churches from more than 120 countries representing over 580 million Christians worldwide. The sixth question. So, does this mean that not every prophecy is a thus sayith the Lord? And again, I would go back to the first question. Every prophecy has to have a thus sayith the Lord if it was given after the canon of scripture was fulfilled. So I believe brother Ram's 1954 quote was just a general prophecy. It wasn't a specific prophecy. So I believe every prophecy today has to have a thus sayith the Lord on it to be an official prophecy. And seventh and finally is this new pope going to be the antichrist or not. And the answer is we don't know if this pope will be the antichrist or not. It could be this pope or a future pope. No one knows. Only God knows. But again, it is amazing that brother Ram said a pope would come out of the United States 71 years before it happened because many people thought there would never be a pope from the United States. Friends, let's stay solid. Let's stay faithful. Let's not be fanatics as Holy Ghost fil Christians. As brother Bam told us in questions, answers on the seals. Brother Ram said, just live a good, godly Christian life. Show everyone how much you love the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe some people could get in trouble if they're trying to make this pope the actual antichrist. What if he's not? Of course, that hurts the name of Christ. That brings reproach upon the name of Christ and reproach upon the individual. We've just always got to be very careful what we make. Thus sayith the Lord. And this kind of relates to the six major vision and if Camala Harris fulfilled that or not. I do not believe Camala Harris fulfilled the sixth vision because I did not bow to her. The vision said the whole nation bowed to this woman. this powerful woman. I never bowed to Camala Harris naturally or spiritually. And now she's not in power anymore. So this topic of the new pope kind of goes along with the previous vice president, Camala Harris. So we just got to be honest. We just got to be humble. We just got to wait on the Lord. And church, as we wait upon the Lord, God renews our strength like the eagle. Well, that's the anointing we have for this day, the eagle anointing to fly above the worldly things to set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings the good news that Jesus raised from the dead living among man today his church the same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed [Music]
