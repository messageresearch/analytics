TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Now remember, God's got some guards for that for that mercy seat. Oh, I just had a glorious time. Now watch what it was, what the Lord did. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to find where is the throne of God? Where is God? This topic was suggested to me by a precious brother. So I appreciate the suggestion and I hope this video is a blessing by the grace of the Lord. So the answer to that question is God is both in his heavenly throne and also on the throne of every heart of every true believer living here on the earth. I'll begin with a few points here by the grace of God. The first point is that God has always had a throne or a spiritual seat or a dwelling place. Remember before God created anything he was all alone. the invisible God, God the Father. So, he had a dwelling place. Then God became visible in the logos or we'd say God's theophony, the Holy Ghost. And then God must have created a throne for his theophony, his son, and then created the angels to worship his son. So that was the first visible throne of God in the spiritual realm. And in this video, we'll go through the Old Testament thrones on earth, the New Testament thrones on earth, and then the heavenly throne. And lastly, we'll look at brother Aram's glorious time and revelation that he shared with us regarding the throne of God. Another important point is that due to God's omnipotence, he can be on all these thrones at one time. God is all powerful. God can manifest himself in as many ways and in as many places as he wants. This is specifically seen at Jesus' baptism. Three manifestations, yet one God, one person, not three persons. It's also seen on the day of Pentecost. The Holy Ghost is seen as a lick of fire above 120 believers. He was seen as a lick of fire above them. And then he was also dwelling in their souls. So the Holy Ghost is not 120 different persons. The Holy Ghost is one person. It's God the Father. It's God in us. God the Father is God above us. the invisible God. Jesus is God with us, Emmanuel. And the Holy Ghost is God in us. And the third and final point I want to make is that when we speak of the heart and the soul, sometimes they're used interchangeably, but sometimes they're used as different aspects of mankind's being. Sometimes heart is used for the emotions, which would be in the human spirit. Sometimes heart is used as the soul. Here's a few examples. In Jeremiah 17:9, the Bible says, "The heart is deceitful above all things." Well, if I'm a Holy Ghostfilled believer and God is in my soul, well, then my soul is not deceitful. It would be my human mind or my human emotions would be deceitful. Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. So, in this case, heart is speaking of the soul. And then Deuteronomy 6:5 says, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul." So in this scripture, heart is the emotions in the human spirit and soul would be the innermost part of man, his nature. So we have to be careful when we read the Bible to apply heart and soul in the correct manner based upon the context by the grace of God. So let's begin with the Old Testament throne. Now in the Hebrew, the word throne means a seat, throne, stool. So the first Old Testament throne would be the Garden of Eden. The tree of life had to be the Lord Jesus Christ. Had to be the spirit of Jesus Christ. This is one of the keys to the serpent seed. If the tree of life was a literal tree, then there's two ways to eternal life. That would break God's word. That would break God's plan. There's only one way to eternal life. That's through the spirit of God. So the tree of life in the Garden of Eden was the spirit of Jesus, the logos, or the Holy Ghost. So God's presence was seated there in the garden. That was the first throne of God on earth was in the garden of Eden. And the Bible also said that God walked in the garden. That was mentioned after Adam and Eve had sinned, though. But it seems like perhaps the spirit of God was dwelling there in the garden, walking and fellowshipping with Adam and Eve before the fall. But again, that's just my thought. I could be wrong on that. After the fall, the first time a seat or throne is mentioned is Exodus 25:22. God said, "There will I meet with thee. I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubams which are upon the ark of testimony." Now before this, God had met with humans, believers and unbelievers, numerous times. Of course, he spoke to Cain in Genesis 4. He spoke to Noah in Genesis 6. God came in the form of Melzdc and met with Abraham in Genesis 14. The Lord appeared to Isaac and Jacob as well. But Exodus 25:22 is the first mention of God having another earthly throne or seat. God's presence would meet Moses and Aaron above the mercy seat or perhaps only Aaron if I'm not mistaken. And then the Old Testament traces the locations of the ark of the covenant. Moses, of course, had it in the tabernacle in the wilderness. Joshua carried it into battle. Then it went to Shiloh in the book of Judges 20 27. And then in 1st Samuel chapters 4-7, the ark went from Shiloh to Felistia, then to Kirjath Jereim. The days of David, David brought the ark into Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 6. Of course, King Solomon had the ark in Jerusalem in First Kings 8. The Kingdom of Judah had the ark in 2 Chronicles 35:3. And that is the final historical mention of the Ark of the Covenant, if I'm not mistaken, 2 Chronicles 35:3 when Josiah restores worship and restores the ark. Next, in the New Testament, the throne of God, of course, the first throne of God or seat of God was the body of Jesus Christ. The Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself in 2 Chronicles 5:1 19. The Bible said in Colossians 2:9 that the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in Christ. After Jesus ascended to heaven, the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost. And now every true believer becomes a temple of God. This is clearly taught in 1 Corinthians 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 6:19. Know ye not that you are the temple of the living God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you? Know ye not your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you. So the place where the Holy Ghost falls and takes his seat or dwelling place in the believer is the soul. It's a permanent dwelling because we're sealed unto the day of our redemption according to Ephesians 4:30. Believers were now given the Holy Ghost in their souls. According to John 7 38-39, Colossians 1:26-28, Isaiah 11:10, Jesus gives his rest and it will be glorious. And then Paul says in Colossians 1, Christ in you the hope of glory. Matthew 11:28-29 speaks of Jesus giving a rest unto our souls. And the Bible said, "We must fear lest we come short of entering into this rest." In Ephesians 4:es 1-12, the language in the New Testament speaks of God's dwelling in the hearts of believers. So sometimes the word heart, remember, represents the emotions, the human spirit. Sometimes it represents the soul. Sometimes the word heart is used for both human spirit and soul together. In other words, the spiritual element to the believer. The believer is both spiritual and physical. And we have three parts. The physical part is the body. And then the spiritual parts are the spirit and the soul according to 1 Thessalonians 5:23. So now let's see how the Holy Ghost dwells in our hearts and in heaven. Let's look at the terminology of the dwelling place for the throne of God or the ark of the covenant. In the Old Testament, First Kings 8:30 says here thou in heaven thy dwelling place. So the Old Testament calls God's throne his dwelling place. But now in the New Testament, our soul is called the dwelling place of God. So we're looking at that word dwell again. Ephesians 3:17, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. So God dwells both in heaven and in your heart, your soul. Galatians 4:6, and because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, "Aba, Father." So God dwells both in heaven and in the heart of every true believer. Praise the Lord. The next word or the next term I want to look at is the word rule. In the Old Testament, the words throne, kingdom, and ruler are used to speak of God's dwelling. Psalm 103:19 says, "The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all." So God's heavenly throne is likened unto his kingdom. It's a place where he rules from. But now the Bible said God rules in our hearts. Colossians 3:15, "And let the peace of God rule in your hearts." So this is another proof that God's throne is in the heart of the believer, the soul of the believer. He rules in our hearts. And then Luke 17 says, "The kingdom of God is within you." So again, the kingdom is where the throne is, as Psalm 103:19 says. So Jesus says, "The kingdom of God is within you." That's the Holy Ghost. Now, let's move on to the next section, the heavenly throne. We know the earthly tabernacle Moses was based upon the pattern he saw in heaven. So Moses's earthly tabernacle was patterned after the heavenly throne or tabernacle according to Hebrews 8:5 and Exodus 25:9. Here's a visual of Clarence Larkin's drawings of the three tabernacles, the human body, the tabernacle Moses, and the heavenly tabernacle. I have Larkin's books. I personally love his books and his drawings, his details, his attention to scripture. Now, in this visual, I added two golden veils just because Larkin didn't have the veils drawn. So, you can see a veil after the sea of glass, and you can see a veil after the seven spirits or lamps of God before you get into the most holy place. Let's start in the outer court. You first have the sacrificial altar. This would have to have burning coals as Isaiah 6 told us. And also the fifth seal of Revelation chapter 6 speaks of this altar. And there's also Jewish believers around this throne, their souls under the altar crying out, "How long, Lord?" Then moving closer in to the temple of God, you have the sea of glass. And Moses represented these with the brazen altar and the labor in his outer court. Moving into the second court called the holy place, we have the golden altar burning with incense. The Bible says this is the prayers of the saints. The Bible says we also have a golden sensor in heaven. Near this golden altar, we have seven lamps burning with fire. This was represented by the seven golden candlesticks in the times of Moses. Also, I believe in the holy place, you have 24 seats for elders. I could be wrong on that, but that's just my thought. And then you have a veil separating the holy place from the most holy place. And lastly, we have the holiest of holies. There are four cherubams or four beasts surrounding the throne of Jesus. Lightnings and thunderings proceed out of the throne. And friends, I could be wrong on this, but I believe Jesus's throne is also considered to be an ark of the covenant because in Revelation 11:1 19, the Bible said the temple of God was open in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament. So there is an ark of the covenant up in heaven. I believe that's Jesus' throne because in Moses tabernacle, you had the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat was the top lid of the ark of the covenant. So I believe Jesus sits on heaven's mercy seat and there he makes intercession to the father for us. Hebrews 6:19 says our hope is an anchor of the soul and enters into that within the veil. So our hope enters into the holiest of holies in heaven. What a wonderful promise. And that's where the Bible said Jesus is seated there appearing in the presence of God for us. According to Hebrews 9:24, Hebrews 9:3 says Moses tabernacle had two veils. So it's likely heaven has two veils as well. One before the holy place and one before the holiest of holies. So heaven's tabernacle remains until the time of the new Jerusalem. Now even during the millennium I believe there will be a heavenly tabernacle but there will also be a physical tabernacle God's throne in Jerusalem where Jesus will judge all the nations rule the nations with a rod of iron for a thousand years. So God will have a earthly throne during the millennium and also a heavenly throne. But then during the new Jerusalem heaven comes down to earth. Heaven and earth unite and the Bible says there will be no temple. The Bible says the final throne of God will be on the top of the new Jerusalem. Revelation 22 says a river will proceed out of the throne of God and of the lamb. So the final throne of God is at the top of the new Jerusalem. Scripture teaches there is a final throne. That's the throne of God and the lamb and the new Jerusalem. And scripture teaches there is no more temple because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of the new Jerusalem. Let's go to Revelation 21:22. The final section will be the glorious time and glorious revelation brother Brandham had about the throne of God. This is taken from brother Bam's sermon, Revelation chapter 4, part three, January 8th, 1961. Brother Ram said, "I was sitting the other day and saw this. I just jumped up and run around and around and around the chair saying glory, glory, glory, glory, around and around." He said, "Oh, I just had a glorious time." Let's listen to the quote. sitting the other day and saw this. I just jumped up and run around around the chair saying glory glory glory glory glory round around round Charlie I course you up in the woods sometime sister if I act like that you run me out I house oh I just had a glorious time now watch what it was what the Lord did now &gt;&gt; so what is this glorious revelation the revelation is that God's throne in heaven is guarded with four throne guards the four cherubam or the four beasts each one like an unto a lion man, calf, man, flying eagle. So, brother Ram said the revelation is that God's throne in heaven has guards and brother Ram says God's presence on earth has guards. Brother Ram says God's presence on earth is the book of acts church represented by the book of acts from the bible and has four guards which are the four gospels of the lord Jesus Christ. Brother Ram gave two examples of how the book of Acts is guarded by the four gospels. The first example was salvation and water baptism. He said the book of Acts teaches the water baptism and salvation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to Acts 2:38 and numerous other baptism verses. But brother Ram notices how all four gospels protect the revelation of salvation and water baptism through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He starts in Matthew 1:18 and shows how the name of the son is Jesus. Then Matthew 73 and 14 speak of enter in ye at the straight gate. Then Matthew 28:19 baptize them in the name one name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. And of course 10 days later Peter said baptize in the name of the lord Jesus Christ. Mark protects this revelation because Jesus said, "Whosoever believeth and is baptized shall be saved." Luke supports this revelation or protects the revelation because he said, "Repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name." So, one name again, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in Luke 24:47. And John 3:23 shows when John baptized, he baptized because there was much water there. So this protects the revelation of full immersion in water not sprinkling. And the second subject brother Ram says is protected is divine healing. In Matthew 10:1 the disciples are given power to heal the sick. In Mark 16 15-17 Jesus said these signs will follow them that believe. They'll lay hands on the sick. They shall recover. They will cast out devils. Luke supports divine healing. Luke 10 again is the sending out of Jesus's 12 apostles with power to heal. John 14:12 Jesus said, "The works that I do shall ye do also. Greater works than these shall you do because I go to my father." That greater means more works, not greater because no one could do greater works than the Lord Jesus Christ. And brother Random taught John 15:7 as well. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. &gt;&gt; Now remember, God's got some guards for that for that mercy seat. What is that mercy seat guard? All right. M A D H Matthew on the east, Luke, Mark, John, all of their four gospels vindicate the book of Acts to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They guard it anywhere you want to look at it. Let's just take one. Just one. We ain't got time. I got 20 you borrow wrote down here, but let's just take one on this subject for salvation. Now, let's take and see if Matthew up here now will guard it for divine healing. Got your pencils and hand you're writing this down. All right. See if Matthew divides divine will guard. Let's take Matthew 10 and one. &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. So where is God? God is both in heaven and in our hearts at the same time by his omnipotence. His temple is both in heaven and in our souls now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. His temple will also return during the millennium. But his final temple of course will be the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in the new Jerusalem. Let us do what Ephesians 4:30 says. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of our redemption. The word grieve in the Greek means to offend. Let's not offend the Holy Ghost. If we do, let's confess our sins quickly. We know we sin every day. So, let's quickly confess our offenses to the Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit can come back on us, anoint us for the glory of God, that the Holy Ghost might dwell in our hearts, rule our lives, help us to win souls for the kingdom of God, help our souls to be made ready for the millennium and the future home. I think the last thing I'll say is if you want Jesus Christ to dwell in your heart, all you have to do is repent of your sins and mean it with all your heart. Repent means to turn away, change your mind, and make amends for your sin. So if Jesus is not on the throne of your heart now, repent of your sins. Do everything in your power to overcome sin. God will help you. He'll sanctify you. He'll clean you out. You get saved first with justification. And then God sanctifies you, which means purifies your daily life and habits and your mind. And then he'll fill your soul with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Even when you repent, God's spirit will dwell in your heart, dwell in your emotions. He'll dwell in your human spirit. He'll continue doing that through sanctification. But once you're baptized with the Holy Ghost, it's a permanent dwelling or ruling of God's spirit in your soul. And that lasts until the day of your redemption. [Music] If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm &gt;&gt; very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fail. [Music]
