TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Many times someone has said, "Brother Bram, why is it you always take the Old Testament?" Nearly always taking a text, you'll go back to the Old Testament. I do it because I like typology. God never used idols. He always used man. God don't use machinery, mechanical devices. He uses man, individuals. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to see a parallel with the current Brandham tabernacle leadership and how they've closed the doors, the physical doors of their church. And I believe this was foreshadowed by King Ahaz in the Old Testament. And of course, this video is made in brotherly kindness in hopes that the leadership at Brandham Tabernacle and the people there will repent and get back to public worship, opening their doors and inviting their congregation back into the house of God rather than telling them to stay at home and neglect gathering more as we see that day approaching. So the main Bible verse that I believe Brandham Tabernacle is neglecting as far as the focus of this video is Hebrews 10 24 and 25. The Bible said, "Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see that day approaching." So we see the importance of saints gathering together. It stirs us up to love better, to love one another, to do more works for the kingdom of God, for the Lord Jesus Christ. And we should do it more, gather more as we see that day approaching. The manner of some is to forsake assembling. And that's a sin. So, Holy Ghost fil Christians are gathering more as we see that day approaching, not laying out of church. And if I'm not mistaken, Brandham Tabernacle hasn't gathered physically since March of 2020. So over 5 years they've sat at home and not gone to church. Despite all the quotes where brother Random says, you can't be as good of a Christian if you stay at home and don't physically go to church. And despite the quotes where brother Ram said, even if I just agreed with one thing with a church, I'd still go to that church to show everybody which side I'm on. People say I can stay at home, be just as good a Christian as I can at church. You can't. The Bible said not forsake or assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the time coming. If you're a Christian, you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians. So you cannot stay away from church and live the same life. It can't do it because it's like I I I I'm hungry, but I'll never go to a table. I just I'll never eat. I just ain't going to do it. See, you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another. If I lived in a city and they had nothing there but u uh well some church I don't want to call any names but just any church that only believe one thing that Jesus was divine all the rest up is wrong. I'd go to that church if I can't get a whole loaf of bread. I I'll take a slide. I'll go listen worship the Lord and show him that I'm doing my part. I want them to know I'm alive. I'm I'm want everybody to know what side I'm on. assemble with the Christians and their worship and and serve the Lord. And now you've got tapes on that. You got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline of the church. How we behave oursel in the church of God. How we got to come here together and set together in heavenly places. Don't stay home. Amen. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying because we're in the last days where the Bible exalted exhorted us to to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to symbol ourselves together in heavenly places and and and Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other. That's right. Stay right together. Now that shows that at the beginning they had nothing to start with. For if you love God, you can't you couldn't wire you away from church. They couldn't chain you away from it. They can't hide a believer from God. So what spirit is on the current bride tabernacle leadership that tells them to lay out of church and not show everybody what side they're on? Also, Luke 4:16 tells us what Jesus's attitude towards church attendance was. His custom was always to go into the synagogue on the Sabbath. So, we know the Lord Jesus never neglected physically gathering for worship, public worship. And yet, Brandham Tabernacle on their blog posts say they are the greatest congregation of all time. And yet, they can't even gather together and worship. So this thought just came to me one morning while studying and I was thinking of how the Brandham tabernacle has been abandoned both the original Brandham tabernacle and the renovated young Foundations building. And I felt the spirit of God just ask me that question. Has this ever been done before in the Bible? So I started searching and yes this has been done before. God's temple has been abandoned before and that was during the time of King Ahaz. Ahaz ruled around 7:35 to 7:15 BC. Around 8th century BC. He was the son of King Jotham. He was the father of Hezekiah. According to 2 Kings 16:1-4, he did that which was not right in the sight of the Lord. He did a lot of wicked things. But the one thing that caught my attention was found in 2 Chronicles 28:24. And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord. And he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. So what caught my attention was he shut the doors of the house of the Lord. And so while I'm studying, while I'm meditating on these things, this seemed to be the foreshadowing of what current Brigham Tabernacle is doing. Anybody can go on Brandham Tabernacles website and see when they started this renovation of the Young Foundation Center. I think it was 2022. The work has been finished for quite a while now. I reached out by email to some of the workers there at Voice of God if I'm not mistaken, and they told me the construction's been done for a long time, but that the current pastor doesn't feel led to physically gather. But if you read the website, that was the whole point of the million dollars of renovations was because they had so many people moving into Jeffersonville to physically attend church that they needed to make a bigger church. Now, I hope the church opens up this Sunday. It probably won't, but I hope it does cuz then the people are getting closer to God, closer to obeying the word of God. But it's just sad that the current Brandham Tabernacle and the renovated Young Foundations building are sitting empty every Wednesday, every Sunday. The people are not gathering more as we see that day approaching. So they're breaking the scripture. King Hezekiah when he opened the house of God stated again that the people had turned their backs on the habitation of the Lord. This is in 2 Chronicles 29:6-7. And have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord and turned their backs. Also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. So the temple was physically closed and religious services ceased due to the sins of the leadership. And I believe that's what's happened at Brenham Tabernacle. The physical gathering and physical public worship to the Lord Jesus Christ has ceased due to the sin mainly of idolatry. And that idolatry is making every word on brother Ram's tapes, thus sayith the Lord. That's a lie. That's heresy. That's idolatry. Brother Ram said it was an awfulest thing to do. It was Tommy to make him completely infallible. Let's listen to the quote. They're claiming here that some brethren up there that said that I sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that um that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and what were some of the awesome prophesying and understand that one man should leave this wife and go marry that one. Uh this church knows that we don't stand for no such Tommy rod as that. We believe in the Bible. So I want to look at some parallels here with King Ahaz and the current Brandom tabernacle. There's about five parallels. The first one is idolatry. This is found in 2 Chronicles 28 2-3. Verse two said he made molten images for Balum. Moreover, he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Henam. Then in verse four, sacrificed burnt incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. So the parallel I'm taking is that Brandham Tabernacle has made an idol of brother Brandham's tapes. They say every word on tape was thus sayith the Lord. And that's a lie. He says that you have to realize that brother every brother Joseph believes everything that brother Brandon says is sayeth the Lord. Amen. I believe everything says the Lord. Brother Ram said there's mixups on the tapes and he said when that happens he said these four beautiful words look in the Bible because the Bible has no mistakes. The Bible is our absolute. The other day I got something mixed up. I happened to hear it. It's I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it. Boy was a great teaching there. I didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible you see. So the Bible is perfectly true and that's what we stand on the Bible. It must be thus sayaeth the Lord. It's got to come to one final absolute. And my absolute is the word, the Bible. The second attribute was the temple was closed. 2 Chronicles 28:24. I read this earlier. And shut up the doors of the house of the Lord. And he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. So that's what Brandham Tabernacle has done. They've shut the doors to Brandham Tabernacle and the renovated Young Foundation's building. Now every house of their members becomes an altar or becomes a place of worship. And I just think it's so sad. Brother Random thought the boycott, the future boycott of the World Council of Churches and the One World Economical Movement would force churches to close doors. But that's not what's happened to Brandham Tabernacle. Brandom Tabernacle has closed their own doors. And that's extremely sad. It wasn't the enemy that closed the doors of Brandham Tabernacle and the Young Foundation's building. It was the leaders of Brandom Tabernacle that closed the door. That's why I believe there's this similarity between the current Brandom Tabernacle leadership and King Ahaz. And then worship was stopped. This is the third attribute that's similar. We know this is true because in 2 Chronicles 29 28 and 29 when Hezekiah reestablished the worship then the congregation worshiped and all that were present including the king bowed themselves and worshiped. This is the Bible says and all the congregation worshiped and the singers sang. So singing was restored once Hezekiah restored the temple but there was no singing during the time of Ahaz. no singing in the house of God. And the trumpeters sounded, and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped. So all the worship was stopped. There's no singing in Brham tabernacle anymore. There's no prayers offered in the young Foundation's building. It just sits empty. So there's idolatry. The physical doors are closed and there's no worship service. Fourth, the priesthood is neglected. This is 2 Chronicles 29 11. So when Hezekiah reopens the temple, he says in verse 11, "My sons, be not now negligent, for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him, and that you should minister unto him and burn incense." So his father Ahaz did the opposite. His father Ahaz told the ministers and the priesthood to neglect their service. He shut them out of service. And the parallel obviously here is that the Brandham tabernacle tells preachers to sit down and just press play or stand up and press play. It doesn't matter. The sin that's taking place is they're telling preachers not to preach. The Bible never says avoid the five-fold ministry, the living preachers. The Bible never says to limit the five-fold ministry. The Bible never says press play and obey. But they always press play and disobey. What the Brandham Tabernacle is currently doing is promoting that preachers bury their talents in the earth. Like in Matthew 25 26. And friends, any preacher that's a real preacher that buries his talent in the earth and just presses play and won't preach is going to be called wicked and slothful servant according to the Lord Jesus. And brother Random said, "We need more preachers." And he never changed that after he said it in questions and answers 1964. So we'll listen to that quote. And then they asked, "Brother Brandham, should you be the only one preaching?" And he said, "No, there's men all around the world." He says, "Get in the ministry. We need them." And then he says, "Also, I'm right behind the preachers." So, we know if Brother Brand was alive today, he'd be behind the living preachers. He wouldn't be behind the button pushers. He'd be behind the true five-fold ministry. Let's listen to the quotes. Now, Brother Brandham, is it true that no one should preach but you? We have seen your We have seen you ordained man. We do don't believe you would do that if there were not if they were not to preach. Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told you that nobody's preached for me, I'd sure be a poor subject of God's with all that. No. Every man or that feels a call of God upon his life, get into the ministry, start preaching. We need them. Man of God are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel. See, I'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones. See, so I just many more eligible, more worthy, more of anything to preach than me. I'm just one little humble person laying out here. I'm one grain of wheat and a whole garner. See, so it's just, you know what I mean? Any man that's called of God needs to preach the gospel. Would we still be on fire and preach the gospel or is the time over? No, keep preaching this. As hard as you can preach, brother, stay with it. I'm right behind you. Fifth, and finally, there's a parallel in 2 Chronicles 29:10. Here we see Hezekiah renewing the covenant. He says, "Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us." So the opposite of this is true. King Ahaz transgressed the covenant or changed the covenant or neglected the covenant. And that's exactly what current Brandham tabernacle has done. And as my past videos show, they've changed the covenant. The sign of the covenant currently is the token which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But Brandham Tabernacle has changed it. Their leadership literally says the tapes are the token. So that's the fifth and final attribute that's the same as the days of King Ahaz with the current Brandom Tabernacle leadership. They've broken the covenant. They've changed the sign of the covenant. Now it's just the ability to push play. That's a lie. That's heresy. So let's listen to the quotes where brother Random says, "The Holy Ghost is the token." Brother Ram never said pressing play was the token. Let's listen to the quote. But they got to catch the vision. You got to play the tapes. They're the token that come from the body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Water, blood, and life. Amen. And the whole church, the bride together has been made up through justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the token, as Hebrews 11 says, all these who wander about sheep skins and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that the blood has been shed, and that the Holy Ghost is upon the church. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. You know, I did not plan to study this topic. This thought I believe came to me inspired by the Holy Spirit. Recently, when I listened to Brother Ram preaching about the invasion of the United States, he said, "Brother Brand, why is it you always take the Old Testament?" He said, "Because I'm a typologist." He said, 'The only way that I know to be somewhere near right is to see what the pattern was, to look off the blueprint and see what it was, and then I know what that was will be something similar to what this is here because it's just a shadow of it. And I always look back to the Old Testament to see what the children of Israel did, see what the punishment of sin was, see what the justice of the prophets was, and see what all those things were. And then I have an idea what this is here which is foreshadowed what will be in the general windup at the end. So that was inspired to me when I preached the invasion of the United States. And then while meditating on this topic the thought came to me where is the pattern of closing the church doors in the Bible and it's King Ahaz. But Hezekiah gives us hope. And so that gives us hope. If the current bread and tabernacle won't repent, perhaps they will in the future will pray for them. But perhaps the next generation will like the Bible shows regarding King Hezekiah, maybe they'll open the doors of the house of God and allow real preachers to use their preaching gifts. As brother Ram said, God never permitted mechanical devices to preach the gospel. God never use idols. He always used man. God don't use machinery, mechanical devices. He uses man, individuals. Hallelujah. Excuse me. I didn't name the holler that round. Notice I'm not excited. Oh, I know right where I am. Right. I just feel good. So, let's close with a prayer for current Brennham Tabernacle. Dear God, I pray for the current Brennham Tabernacle leadership. God, may they take warning from this if they see it. Lord God, we can see they have a cult mentality. They don't listen to anyone else except their pastor and the tapes, which means they won't accept correction. So Lord, I just pray their hearts would open. If they have true hearts, if they're hungry and thirsting for righteousness, they'll have a heart to hear this. And not just from me, but from anyone else who will speak the truth to them in love. Lord, you know this is done in love and brotherly kindness. Also as a warning, the Bible said them that sin rebuked before all. And Lord Jesus, if you anointed Brother Brennan to warn those people out in Arizona in 1964 about their cult tendencies, Lord, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You'll anoint people to do it today. So God, be magnified, be glorified. We pray for repentance for this generation of the brand tabernacle. And Lord, we pray for a Hezekiahike revival where they'll open the church doors and let real preachers in to preach the gospel. Lord, let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings the good news that Jesus raised from the dead living among men today his church the same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed [Music]
