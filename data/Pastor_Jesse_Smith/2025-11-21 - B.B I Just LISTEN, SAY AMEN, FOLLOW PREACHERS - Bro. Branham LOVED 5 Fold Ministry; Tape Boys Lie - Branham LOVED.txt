TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So, I just listen to what they say and say, "Amen." Go on. Because they're they're a man of God. I follow them. I find they're in the Bible and tell the truth. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show a quote from God's prophet, Brother William Brham, [music] from 1959, where he supports the five-fold ministry. This quote is closely related to the previous video I made [music] which is called pastors have a higher office than brother Brandham. And of course those are brother Brandham's own words not my words. And so in that video, by the grace of God, we rightly divided the word of truth to show that the pastor has the highest office in the local church only. But the highest office of the five-fold ministry is the apostle and the highest office for revelation of the word of God is the prophet. So let's look at this quote from 1959. It's November 29th. Let us see God, San Jose, California. Brother Random is ending the service with a prayer line and discernment. He said, "Now I cannot heal. Healing is already purchased by the Holy Spirit." How many knows that Christ did it on Calvary? The only thing that maybe these men here, their ministers, they could take the word of God. And I wouldn't I'd be darent to stand before them with the word of God and anything contrary. &gt;&gt; Now, I cannot heal. Healing is already purchased by the Holy Spirit. How many knows that Christ did it on Calvary? The only thing that maybe these men here, they're ministers. They could take the word of God. I wouldn't I'd be darcing to stand before him with the word of God and anything contrary because they're called, that's their office. &gt;&gt; So, this is the first statement I want to look at. I hope everybody caught that. Brother Random said, I'd be daring to stand before them with the word of God. I'd be daring to stand before him with the word of God and anything contrary. &gt;&gt; So look how humble brother Brandham is to the local five-fold ministry and especially pastors, evangelists, and teachers because brother Bram will say later, he has a prophetic gift. Brother Bram said, in other words, I dare not stand before these ministers. Now that's totally opposite of tape worshippers. Tape worshippers will say, how dare you try to correct Brother Brandham? How dare you try to rightly divide the word of truth? So again, the tape boys are completely opposite of brother Brandham. Brother Brham said, "I would dare not stand before the local pastors, evangelists, and teachers because they have separate gifts. They have different gifts than my prophetic gift." So that's the first point, and it's a powerful point. I wonder what the tape boys would say about that. Brother Brandham would dare not stand before the local five-fold ministry preachers. Moving on the quote, he said, "Because they're called, that's their office. They preach &gt;&gt; because they're called, that's their office. They preach." &gt;&gt; So again, Brother Bram's emphasizing, these are local pastors, local evangelists and teachers, and they have the office to do the preaching and teaching to the local assemblies. And brother Ram says, he goes on to say, they know what they're talking about. &gt;&gt; They know what they're talking about. Now, second, let's look at what brother Random says next. This is powerful. So, I just listen to what they say and say amen and go on because they're they're men of God. &gt;&gt; So, I just listen to what they say and say, "Amen." Go on. Cuz they're they're men of God. &gt;&gt; So, that's the second point. Brother Random says, "I just listen and say amen." Brother Ram did not say, "I just demand to take my pulpits back and I demand to put the prophet back in the pulpit and let all the preachers say amen to me." That's what Brandham Tabernacle says today. Brandham Tabernacle is lying today. They're not saying what Brother Brandham said. Brother Brandham said, "I just let them preach. They know what they're talking about. I just say amen because they're men of God." So Brandham Tabernacle says only say amen to brother Brandham not living preachers but brother Brandham says I say amen to the living preachers. So who are we going to follow? Brother Brandham or the current Brandom Tabernacle. We're going to follow God's prophet brother Brandham. We believe the quotes by God's grace. And third he says I follow them. I find they're in the Bible and tell the truth. &gt;&gt; They're a man of God. I follow them. I find they're in the Bible and tell the truth. So thirdly, brother Brandham said he followed the five-fold ministry. But yet Brandham Tabernacle says, "Brother Brandham's a leader of the five-fold ministry. Everyone should say amen to him and all the preachers should be quiet, stop preaching, neglect their gifts, sit down, and just press play and follow Brother Brandham." Yet look how humble brother Brandham was in the local ministry setting. He said, "I follow them. I just sit down, say, "Amen, and listen to what they say. I follow them." That's a true prophet of God who would not undermine the authority of the local churches. And then brother Ram goes on to say, "Well, now I'm not much to preach, but my gift is the gift of seeing." So again, he's differentiating between prophets and then pastors, evangelists, and teachers. He said, "Jesus was a preacher. He was also a seer. And now my part being that I have not education enough to preach, but I have a gift to foresee things, tells forth and foretells." Well, now I'm not much to preach. But my gift is a gift of seeing. That's a Jesus was a preacher. He also was a seer. And on my part, being I have not education enough to preach. But I have a gift to foresee things tells forth and foretell. &gt;&gt; So again, a super powerful quote from God's prophet supporting the five-fold ministry. not degrading it, not neglecting it, not claiming that he was the only important one to hear in the five-fold ministry. So again, the thumbnail of this video is just my imagination. What would an honest tape boy look like if he was sitting in his church just pressing play and he heard this? I think he'd be shocked if he had a conscience and it was not numbed. If he had a clean Holy Ghost conscience, he would be shocked to hear brother Ram say he did not dare stand before the local preachers, teachers, and evangelists. And he just said amen to them and followed them. Of course, this goes along with brother Ram's quote from 64 questions and answers. He says, "I'm just one pebble on the beach." &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, is it true that no one should preach but you? We have seen your We have seen you ordained man. We do don't believe you would do that if there were not if they were not to preach. Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told you nobody's preached for me, I'd sure subjects of God with all that. No. Every man or that feels a call of God upon his life, get into the ministry, start preaching. We need them. Man of God are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel. See, I'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones. See, so uh there just many more eligible, more worthy, more of anything to preach than me. I'm just one little humble person laying out ear. I'm one grain of wheat and a whole garner. See, so it's just, you know what I mean? Any man that's called of God needs to preach the gospel. How can a Christian get deeper in the love of God? Read the word and pray. Read the word of God and pray. And friends, if anyone is honest who listens to brother Random regularly, they will find Brother Random supporting the five-fold ministry many times. I'm just going to give four quick examples. First, in May of 1960, Brother Ram said he loved Orman Neville's sermons. He never said, "I love when Brother Neville sits down and just presses play and obey and gives me back the pulpit." &gt;&gt; I tell you the reason I'd love to hear Brother Neville speak. I tell you the reason I love to hear brother Neville speak. Not mainly because he's a good preacher, but because I know that he lives what he preaches. &gt;&gt; And I would rather you would live me a sermon than preach me one. &gt;&gt; It'll be more effective. &gt;&gt; Our our precious brother is is one unselfish man is is brother Neville. And if any of you here last Sunday and heard that marvelous message that he brought on the cruel, it was out one of the most outstanding message I ever heard. &gt;&gt; Was what brother Neville brought by the Holy Spirit last Sunday to this little herd of sheep that God has gathered together. Second, in 1963 July, Brother Ram said he got 20 sermons from listening to Lee Vale preach at Brennham Tabernacle and said, "I couldn't say nothing to make it any better." Look how humble that is. And I think Levale got off the word of God greatly as he got older. But that's just my humble opinion. But while Levale was alive, Brother Ram said he couldn't say nothing to make it any better. Yet the tape boys will say there's no greater preacher than Brother Brandham. Nobody could preach a sermon as good as brother Brandham. Yep. Brother Brandham said leave sermon was so good he could not make it any better. &gt;&gt; So much was said I couldn't say nothing to make it any better. &gt;&gt; And I truly believe that it was the Lord that worked this out for brother Veil to bring this man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. So do &gt;&gt; you see it has to work that way. We we accept that from God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's so many things he was saying. I I I'd have 20 sermons. Go down your what he said. &gt;&gt; So, who's telling the truth? Who's lying? Of course, the Brandham Tabernacle is lying. We want to tell the truth. We want to be honest and say what the tapes actually say, not twist them to promote 24 false doctrines coming out of Brandham Tabernacle. Third, in July 1965, Brother Ram said he felt led of the Holy Spirit to listen to Brother Neville in the morning service of his last Sunday preaching at Brennham Tabernacle. See how the Holy Ghost led the prophet to submit to the pastor in the local assembly. And brother Ram was so grateful he did that cuz he felt the sermon was important to hear from brother Neville. Brother Ram never said, "Just sit down, brother Neville. It's my pulpit. Put me back in the pulpit." No. Brother Brandon was a holy ghostfilled gentleman. &gt;&gt; I thank you this morning. I wanted to hear brother Neville myself and I heard him many times and never heard him anytime. But what I appreciate but this morning that timely message. I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning. I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning. Very fine. And I see why you people like to come and listen to him. Also listen to that mighty message this morning on uh brother Neville brought us about I thought it was so wonderful how he said there a doctor will diagnose a case but the man that comes with a handful of needles he gives the injection. &gt;&gt; And last but not least in November 1965 brother Ram said he didn't want to take Pastor Perry Green's time in what house will you build me in Tucson Arizona? I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother Green several times speak and I certainly was influenced I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother Green several times speak and I certainly was influenced. &gt;&gt; This is so important to see how Brother Rem didn't want to take the pastor's time. So he kept his comments short before he prayed and ordained brother Perry Green as the pastor of Tucson Tabernacle. And even in this quote, Brother Ram said, "This is my church." So, Brother Ram's home church at the end of his life was the Tucson Tabernacle. That's what the tapes say. I'm just saying what the tapes say. Now, this they need Sunday school teachers. They're going to need a stand. And I want to say this so that you'll thoroughly understand. This is my church. I've been here 3 years. This is my church. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram pleaded with them, attend every service. Brother Ram never said, sit at home and press play. He said, attend every service. And now that brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe. We are to be very grateful to God. We can't ever service take every place that we can. We can't ever service take every place that we can. &gt;&gt; And yet Brandham tabernacle leaders, I have the recordings. They've listened to this and what they get out of this sermon of what house will you build me and say, "Why don't we put Brother Brandham back in the pulpit so they can listen to a sermon and get a different interpretation?" because they're not gifted to rightly divide the word of truth. And they've got an evil spirit that causes them to hear what the evil spirit says, not what the Holy Ghost says. But brother Ram said, "I don't want to take your time, Pastor Perry Green. I want the pastor to be anointed by the Holy Ghost to give the message to the local church." I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother Green several times speak and I certainly was influenced and can every service take every place that we can and if we're asked to call on to pray to seek to do let's be soldiers not at the just anxious to do it. &gt;&gt; If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the [music] desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
