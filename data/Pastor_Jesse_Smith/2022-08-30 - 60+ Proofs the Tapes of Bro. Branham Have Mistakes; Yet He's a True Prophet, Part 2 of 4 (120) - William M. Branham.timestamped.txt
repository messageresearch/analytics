[0:03] other day i got something mixed up i
[0:04] have to hear it yes i called it right
[0:06] there and it's on the tape if you happen
[0:08] to catch that on your tape remember look
[0:09] in the bible you see
[0:13] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:15] of the lord jesus christ
[0:17] the purpose of this video is to continue
[0:19] part two on the subject of
[0:22] 60 plus proofs the tapes of brother
[0:24] branham have mistakes
[0:26] yet he was a true prophet
[0:29] but first i want to thank everybody for
[0:30] the positive feedback on part one
[0:33] truly it is the desire of the bride of
[0:35] jesus christ to rightly divide the word
[0:37] of truth and that's what this two or
[0:39] three part series aims to do and we can
[0:42] do it by the grace of jesus christ and
[0:44] by the gift of the holy ghost in our
[0:46] lives
[0:47] because jesus promised in john chapter
[0:49] 16 verse 13 that the holy ghost would
[0:52] guide us into all truth
[0:54] picking up in 1961
[0:57] number 22 in january 1961 brother
[1:01] branham said jesus is not on his
[1:03] heavenly throne now
[1:04] quote he isn't on his throne now no sir
[1:07] where's the throne at now in the heart
[1:09] in the heart of who the members of the
[1:11] seven church ages end quote
[1:14] then in awakening jesus 1963 brother ram
[1:17] said quote
[1:19] now we know that his body will not
[1:20] return to the earth until he comes for
[1:22] the church because it must remain there
[1:24] for a sacrifice
[1:26] is that right it must be on the altar he
[1:29] sets on the throne of god tonight
[1:31] end quote
[1:32] so what is the rightly divided word of
[1:34] truth in one quote brother braham said
[1:36] jesus is not on the heavenly throne in
[1:38] the other quote brother ram said jesus
[1:40] is on the throne and can't leave the
[1:42] throne according to the scripture the
[1:44] truth is jesus christ is on the throne
[1:47] yes in one way the altar of god is in
[1:49] the heart of man
[1:50] in the soul of man and the holy spirit
[1:53] is a seal and abides in the soul of man
[1:56] but there's no scripture that ever says
[1:58] jesus christ leaves the heavenly throne
[2:00] the scripture says he must remain there
[2:02] until all enemies are under his feet
[2:04] next at number 23 in 1961 brother ram
[2:08] said trinitarians are saved quote
[2:11] i believe that many thousands of
[2:12] trinitarian people who believe in three
[2:14] gods is saved because they don't know
[2:17] any difference end quote then in 1965
[2:21] brother graham said quote you put him a
[2:22] third person second person or any other
[2:25] person besides god you're lost end quote
[2:29] so what is the rightly divided word of
[2:31] truth are trinitarians saved or lost
[2:33] according to the bible anyone who
[2:35] repents and calls upon the name of the
[2:37] lord shall be saved
[2:39] so a trinitarian who repents of his sins
[2:41] and calls upon the name of the lord
[2:43] shall be saved
[2:44] remember there's two kinds of christians
[2:46] there's wise virgins and foolish virgins
[2:49] the wise virgins know jesus christ is
[2:51] god there's only one person in the
[2:53] godhead
[2:54] but foolish virgins who can be saved
[2:56] according to the scriptures may believe
[2:58] god is three persons but yet they can
[3:00] still be saved
[3:02] number
[3:03] in march of 1961 brother ram said quote
[3:06] jesse had lost some mules had gone away
[3:08] end quote
[3:09] but first samuel 9 verse 3 said it was
[3:12] kish saul's father that had lost the
[3:14] asses
[3:16] so what is the word of truth the word of
[3:18] truth is the scripture's right it was
[3:20] saul's father kish who lost the mules
[3:22] and not jesse david's father
[3:25] number 25 in april of 61 brother ram
[3:28] said quote but jonah never got out of
[3:30] the will of god how can a prophet get
[3:32] out of the will of god end quote
[3:34] but earlier in 1955 brother branham was
[3:37] speaking to moses and said quote now
[3:39] hurting the sheep just a shepherder a
[3:41] man out got out of the will of god and
[3:44] murdered a man and back over there now
[3:46] as a shepherder end quote so what is the
[3:49] rightly divided word of truth can a
[3:50] prophet get out of the will of god or
[3:52] not well the truth is yes prophets can
[3:55] get out of the will of god
[3:57] in a simple example is brother branham
[3:59] when he failed the brown bear vision it
[4:01] was god's will for him to shoot the
[4:02] brown bear as he said even giving us a
[4:05] thus saith the lord that it will be but
[4:07] then god did his part of the vision but
[4:09] brother branham did not do his part of
[4:10] the vision and so brother ram did not
[4:12] shoot the brown bear as he told us but
[4:15] yet brother ran was still a prophet
[4:16] because the brown bear vision was a
[4:18] conditional promise as one of my recent
[4:20] youtube videos spoke of
[4:22] and another example for those who needed
[4:24] an exact quote would be from the africa
[4:26] trip report 1953
[4:29] brother bran was speaking of his trip to
[4:30] south africa
[4:32] and how the brothers got him out of the
[4:33] perfect will of god he said quote but
[4:36] brother i've had more trouble of
[4:37] preachers getting me out of the will of
[4:39] god than anything i've ever seen in my
[4:41] life end quote
[4:43] so if prophets cannot get out of the
[4:45] will of god then brother branham wasn't
[4:47] a prophet but of course we know brother
[4:48] branham was a genuine prophet so we can
[4:51] plainly see brother brahm grew in his
[4:52] revelation on the subject of being out
[4:54] of the will of god
[4:56] number 26 in may of 1961
[4:59] brother brahm said we were commissioned
[5:00] to baptize using father son and holy
[5:03] ghost quote
[5:04] no wonder we are commissioned to baptize
[5:06] using father son and holy ghost end
[5:08] quote now a month later in june of 1961
[5:12] brother ram said quote repent and be
[5:14] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[5:16] the remission of sins and today they
[5:18] adopted the name of father son and holy
[5:20] ghost to be baptized in there's no
[5:22] scripture for that end quote so which
[5:25] one is the rightly divided word of truth
[5:27] well according to acts chapter 2 verse
[5:29] 38 we know the correct water baptism is
[5:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ so
[5:34] again this shows how brother bram grew
[5:35] in revelation and understanding even in
[5:37] water baptism just as it did in the
[5:39] godhead as we saw in part one when
[5:42] brother branham thanked the lord for the
[5:44] third person of the trinity and said how
[5:46] he loved the third person of the trinity
[5:48] that dwelt in his heart but then later
[5:50] brother branham got the revelation that
[5:51] god was only one person
[5:53] number 27 in august 1961 brother graham
[5:57] said quote from the 6th to the 19th
[5:59] chapter is all jewish end quote
[6:02] so here brother brahm says revelation
[6:04] chapter 6 through 19 is all jewish but
[6:06] what is the rightly divided word of
[6:08] truth recently i made a video about this
[6:10] and showed how the gentiles are seen in
[6:12] numerous chapters
[6:14] such as revelation chapter 6 revelation
[6:16] 7
[6:17] the rapture is in the seventh seal in
[6:19] revelation chapter eight brother ram's
[6:21] own ministry is in revelation chapter 10
[6:24] and of course the bride is seen in
[6:25] revelation 13 verse 16
[6:27] as brother bran told us the holy spirit
[6:29] told him to pick up his pen and write
[6:31] revelation 13 verse 16 is the beast
[6:34] system trying to force the bride from
[6:36] preaching the word of god so the truth
[6:38] is we do see the bride in certain
[6:39] chapters between revelation 6 and 19.
[6:42] and also recall that brother ram told us
[6:44] the revelation that god gave him on the
[6:46] four beasts was thus saith the lord and
[6:48] those four beasts represented anointings
[6:50] of the holy ghost that would anoint the
[6:52] gentile bride during the seven church
[6:54] ages and of course the first four seals
[6:57] dealt with the gentile church ages
[7:00] number 28 in august 1961 brother brahm
[7:02] said christ was rejected by the jews in
[7:04] 33 a.d quote from the time god made the
[7:08] promise to abraham genesis chapter 12
[7:10] verse 3 to the time of christ being
[7:12] rejected in a.d 33 by the jews end quote
[7:16] brother branham also taught this earlier
[7:17] in 1958 in the baptism of the holy
[7:20] spirit quote and we find out hear what
[7:23] the bible says about about whether when
[7:25] the lamb was slain see if it was slayed
[7:27] in a.d 33 end quote
[7:30] but later in questions and answers on
[7:32] the seals 1963 brother brahm said christ
[7:35] was slain in 30 a.d quote now we know
[7:38] that jesus was slain about 80 30. is
[7:40] that right about it was about the middle
[7:42] of the year i guess a.d 30 end quote so
[7:45] which one is the truth was jesus slain
[7:47] in 33 or 30 a.d
[7:50] i believe the rightly divided word of
[7:51] truth is 30 a.d and i believe you come
[7:54] to this conclusion based upon a correct
[7:57] understanding of daniel's 70 weeks
[8:00] moving on to 1962
[8:03] in february brother branham said the
[8:05] jawbone samson used was an old jawbone
[8:08] quote did you ever think how samson with
[8:11] that old jawbone of the mule end quote
[8:14] but the scripture says in judges 15
[8:16] verse 15 and he found a new jawbone of
[8:19] an ass and put forth his hand and took
[8:22] it and slew a thousand men therewith end
[8:24] quote
[8:25] so what is the rightly divided word of
[8:27] truth
[8:27] of course the truth is the scripture it
[8:30] was a new jawbone not an old one i
[8:32] remember friends from part one brother
[8:34] branham said he made these kind of
[8:35] mistakes all the time he would misquote
[8:37] a scripture he would forget something
[8:40] these are all human mistakes brother and
[8:41] made yet he was a genuine prophet of god
[8:44] when brother graham spoke thus saith the
[8:45] lord those statements never failed that
[8:48] was brother ram's divine side or divine
[8:50] prophetic gift but there was also a
[8:52] human side as brother ram told us and
[8:54] the human side was fallible
[8:57] number 30 was from march 1960 brother
[9:00] ram said the human spirit was the
[9:02] deepest part of man's being in the
[9:04] greatest battle ever fought he said
[9:06] quote inside of that body is a soul but
[9:09] the spirit is only has one sense end
[9:11] quote but later in the god of this evil
[9:13] age 1965
[9:15] brother ram said quote the inside man is
[9:17] a spirit man which is controlled by five
[9:19] senses but the inside of that spirit is
[9:22] a soul and is controlled by one thing
[9:24] your free will end quote
[9:26] so what is the rightly divided word of
[9:28] truth the truth is the latter quote the
[9:30] god of this evil age the soul is the
[9:32] deepest part of man's being that's
[9:34] because jesus christ said i come to
[9:35] bring rest unto your souls proving in
[9:38] the old testament before jesus christ
[9:39] came they could never have the baptism
[9:41] of the holy ghost in the soul there was
[9:43] no soul rest
[9:45] but then john chapter 7 said the saints
[9:47] could receive the baptism of the holy
[9:49] ghost after jesus christ was resurrected
[9:51] and his body glorified
[9:54] number 31 brother brahm said i'm no
[9:56] prophet but then later he said he was a
[9:58] prophet
[9:59] in 1962 in the signs of his coming
[10:02] brother ram said quote brother branham
[10:04] people call call you a prophet i said
[10:06] i'm no prophet end quote but then the
[10:08] token 1964 brother ram said quote now do
[10:11] you believe me to be his prophet i'll
[10:13] say it anyhow believe and you'll be made
[10:15] well end quote
[10:17] so which is the truth is brother branham
[10:18] not a prophet or is brother adam a
[10:20] prophet i think most of us watching this
[10:22] would say brother branham was a prophet
[10:24] and it seems like from other quotes to
[10:26] brother branham he did not like to refer
[10:28] to himself as a prophet because he felt
[10:30] the people might think he was exalting
[10:32] himself but of course under the strong
[10:34] anointing of the holy ghost when his
[10:35] gift was operating he would call himself
[10:38] a prophet
[10:39] number 32
[10:40] in april 62 the signs of his coming
[10:43] brother brahm said quote some of the
[10:45] pentecostal people today don't even
[10:47] count martin luther in them because they
[10:49] say he didn't have the holy ghost he did
[10:51] he might not have had it in the depths
[10:53] that we get it in now but it wasn't for
[10:55] that time end quote
[10:57] another time in 1962 and then another
[10:59] quote in 1961 both say martin luther did
[11:03] not have the baptism of the holy ghost
[11:04] like we have it today
[11:06] but different than that in the sardisian
[11:08] church age chapter 7 brother ram said
[11:11] quote now martin luther himself was a
[11:13] sensitive spirit-filled christian end
[11:15] quote
[11:17] so what is the rightly divided word of
[11:18] truth
[11:19] in my humble opinion i do believe martin
[11:21] luther had the baptism of the holy ghost
[11:24] and the reason is because the baptism of
[11:26] the holy ghost does not change
[11:28] in the new testament doctrine so the new
[11:30] testament never teaches that the baptism
[11:32] of the holy ghost experience would
[11:34] change in the middle of the church ages
[11:37] i do believe revelation was lost but i
[11:39] do not believe that the holy ghost could
[11:41] not be given in the soul during the dark
[11:43] ages or the middle part of the church
[11:45] ages
[11:46] and also to back that up if martin
[11:48] luther was one of the seven stars in the
[11:51] hand of jesus he would have had the same
[11:53] brightness in other words he would have
[11:55] had a very similar experience a
[11:56] spiritual experience as all the other
[11:59] stars which included brother branham and
[12:01] saint paul
[12:03] number 33 was from april 1962 the
[12:06] restoration of the bride tree brother
[12:07] bam said quote the word of the lord came
[12:10] to the prophets they wasn't the word but
[12:12] the word come to them but jesus was the
[12:15] word end quote
[12:17] a month later brother bran would say
[12:19] different he'd say quote and he is the
[12:22] word of god because he's carrying the
[12:23] word of the lord that is a true prophet
[12:25] of the lord end quote
[12:28] so in restoration the bride tree brother
[12:29] ram said the prophet isn't the word but
[12:32] then a month later he said a prophet is
[12:34] the word so what is the rightly divided
[12:36] word of truth if you take the context of
[12:38] the first quote brother is comparing
[12:40] jesus christ as a prophet
[12:42] to all the other prophets
[12:44] and brother branham is saying that jesus
[12:46] christ was fully the word of god he was
[12:48] the word made flesh
[12:49] but all the other prophets were human
[12:51] prophets who sinned jesus christ never
[12:53] sinned because he had a word nature all
[12:55] the other human prophets had a sin
[12:57] nature
[12:58] so when you looked at the nature of
[13:00] jesus and the prophets jesus was the
[13:01] only one who was a word prophet he had
[13:04] the full nature of the word of god
[13:06] all the other prophets had a sin nature
[13:08] but yet god's spirit still anointed them
[13:10] and of course this is the quote branham
[13:12] tabernacle doesn't like they'll never
[13:13] quote this where brother ram said the
[13:15] prophets wasn't the word because then
[13:18] that would make them question whether or
[13:20] not every word on brother rams tapes was
[13:22] thus saith the lord or not well we know
[13:24] not every word on tape is thus saith the
[13:26] lord because we're honest we're humble
[13:28] by the grace of god
[13:29] and we believe these quotes like this
[13:31] quote from the restoration the bride
[13:32] tree so can the human prophets that are
[13:35] sinners say by grace can they be the
[13:36] word of god well in one sense yes and
[13:39] one sense no
[13:40] we'll start with the no a human prophet
[13:43] say by grace can never be fully the word
[13:45] of god while living on this earth in
[13:47] other words moses john the baptist
[13:50] jeremiah ezekiel were never equal to
[13:52] jesus christ they did not have the full
[13:54] word nature but did those prophets
[13:57] represent the word of god do they have a
[13:59] commission to preach the word of god the
[14:01] answer to that is yes
[14:03] so in one way a prophet who is a sinner
[14:05] saved by grace represents the word of
[14:07] god just as the new testament calls us
[14:09] ambassadors for christ really every holy
[14:11] ghostville christian is an ambassador
[14:13] for christ according to new testament
[14:15] doctrine
[14:16] number 34 is from july 62.
[14:19] brother branham apologized for an
[14:21] expression he made he said quote oh my
[14:24] sakes you'd have blowed up like a frog
[14:27] eating shot and you'd you wouldn't of
[14:30] why my you would have not to excuse that
[14:33] experience expression i shouldn't have
[14:35] said that forgive me end quote
[14:38] now previous to this in 1958 brother ram
[14:40] said quote god doesn't have to apologize
[14:42] to nobody for nothing end quote
[14:45] now these two quotes don't seem to
[14:46] contradict each other but if you follow
[14:48] branham tabernacle and their false
[14:50] doctrines these quotes do contradict
[14:52] each other because branham tabernacle
[14:54] says every word on the tape is thus
[14:55] saith the lord if brother branham
[14:57] apologized on the tapes
[14:59] that could not be thus saith the lord
[15:01] because god doesn't have to apologize to
[15:03] nobody for nothing so again brother
[15:05] rahm's own
[15:07] honest humble christian character admits
[15:10] he's not equal to god not everywhere on
[15:12] the tape as thus saith the lord and god
[15:14] alone is the only one who does not have
[15:16] to repent or apologize
[15:18] number 35 is from september 62 brother
[15:21] ram said colombo was the third church
[15:23] age messenger and martin was the fourth
[15:25] so brother ram switched them quote the
[15:27] third church age which was pergamos was
[15:29] saint columba which was a great saint of
[15:32] god during the time of the dark age and
[15:34] the persecution the fourth age and the
[15:36] fourth count saint martin of tours the
[15:39] great saint coming from france end quote
[15:41] so what is the rightly divided word of
[15:43] truth is the church age book right when
[15:45] columba is the fourth age messenger
[15:48] is this quote from countdown thus saith
[15:50] the lord or is the church age book thus
[15:52] saith the lord the truth is brother iran
[15:55] made a mistake in the countdown and he
[15:56] just switched columba and martin
[15:59] columbus should be the fourth messenger
[16:01] and martin should be the third messenger
[16:03] it's incredibly sad friends that the
[16:05] branham tabernacle would say every word
[16:07] is thus saith the lord how can colomba
[16:09] be both the fourth and third church age
[16:12] messenger
[16:13] how can martin be both the third and
[16:15] fourth church age messenger that's a
[16:17] complete contradiction you'd have to be
[16:19] insane to believe that so again that's
[16:21] why we'll pray for these precious souls
[16:23] at the end of the video
[16:25] number 36 is closely related in october
[16:28] of 62 brother ram said columbus come in
[16:31] thirteera quote then entire tira come
[16:34] columba end quote
[16:36] i believe this quote but then the dates
[16:38] brother ram gave for columbus life and
[16:40] the star of the authoritarian church age
[16:42] do not allow colomba to live within his
[16:45] own church age
[16:46] so what is the rightly divided word of
[16:48] truth did columbus come in his church
[16:50] age or not i believe the answer is yes
[16:52] he did come in his church age and that
[16:54] brother ram just made a mistake on the
[16:56] dates of the authority and church age
[16:58] and of course i have a youtube video
[17:00] about this i think i put it out earlier
[17:02] this year or late last year so you can
[17:04] find that and watch that if you're
[17:05] interested in that subject
[17:07] number 37 is from december 62. brother
[17:10] ram said quote but there are seven other
[17:12] seals that's on the back side of the
[17:14] book it's outside the bible
[17:16] but the backside had seven seals on the
[17:18] back of it that wasn't written in the
[17:20] book it's not even written in the book
[17:23] end quote
[17:24] now this is a beautiful quote from the
[17:26] spiritual food in due season brother
[17:27] branham admits that there cannot be
[17:29] seals on the backside of a book because
[17:32] you cannot add or take away from the
[17:34] revealed word of god the genesis to
[17:36] revelation revelation that god has given
[17:39] us as it's been compiled in the holy
[17:41] bible so in 1965 spiritual food and due
[17:44] season quote i always thought it was
[17:46] sealed on the back of the book and it'd
[17:47] be something wasn't wrote in the book
[17:50] but it turned out that it was made known
[17:52] that he cannot do that it isn't
[17:54] something that's written in the book
[17:56] it's something that's been hid in the
[17:57] book for whosoever shall take one word
[17:59] from it or add one word to it so it's a
[18:02] mystery that's been in the book in these
[18:03] seven church ages end quote
[18:06] again i love this quote and this subject
[18:08] i may make a separate video on this
[18:09] topic but it shows again how brother
[18:11] brandon was human in 1962 he thought
[18:14] there were seven additional seals on the
[18:16] backside of the book but then two years
[18:17] later his thoughts changed he said i
[18:19] always thought there was seals in the
[18:20] back but then he come to find out there
[18:22] can be no further revelation outside of
[18:24] the holy bible
[18:26] moving into 1963
[18:29] number 38 in march brother graham said
[18:32] martin luther was not a prophet one day
[18:34] after saying all the messengers were
[18:36] prophets
[18:37] in the breach
[18:38] brother ram said quote out of there was
[18:40] seven prophets that went fourth seven
[18:42] seers eyes so that last one must be a
[18:45] seer end quote
[18:47] and then the next night in the first
[18:48] seal quote
[18:50] why did martin luther say that because
[18:51] he was a reformer not a prophet end
[18:54] quote now what's interesting also is in
[18:56] the restoration the bride tree 1962
[18:59] brother ram said martin luther was one
[19:00] of the four great prophets quote martin
[19:03] luther justification what was the second
[19:05] john wesley by sanctification what was
[19:08] the third pentecost with the restoration
[19:10] of the gifts the holy ghost what was the
[19:12] fourth the word the word there were four
[19:15] great prophets end quote
[19:17] so what is the rightly divided word of
[19:19] truth now on this subject friends i'm
[19:21] not sure which one it is but it's
[19:23] undeniable brother branham said two
[19:25] complete opposite things
[19:27] he said martin luther was not a prophet
[19:29] but he also said martin luther was a
[19:30] great prophet it's interesting to know
[19:32] also that in the church age book brother
[19:34] branham said martin luther had all nine
[19:36] gifts of the spirit one of which would
[19:38] be prophecy
[19:39] so again i'm not quite sure if martin
[19:41] luther was a prophet or not i haven't
[19:43] studied deep enough into his own
[19:44] personal writings
[19:46] to know whether or not he spoke with
[19:48] thus saith the lord and foretold future
[19:50] events
[19:51] but again here we have brother random
[19:53] speaking two completely contrary
[19:55] statements and both cannot be thus saith
[19:58] the lord and in fact neither one is
[20:00] spoken with thus saith the lord so
[20:02] that's why up to this point i haven't
[20:03] studied it i would consider this a minor
[20:05] subject and not a major subject such as
[20:07] salvation the baptism of the holy ghost
[20:10] the mark of the beast and other very
[20:12] important subjects
[20:14] number 39 brother ram said in the fourth
[20:16] seal that the eagle age was promised in
[20:19] malachi chapter 1 verse 4.
[20:22] quote now we find out that the eagle age
[20:25] was promised
[20:26] in revelation 10 verse 7 and in and in
[20:29] malachi 1 verse 4 that it would be in
[20:31] the last days see that's right end quote
[20:34] friends if you read malachi 1 verse 4 it
[20:37] says nothing about an eagle age it's
[20:39] actually
[20:40] thus saith the lord of hosts speaking of
[20:42] edom and the lord's indignation against
[20:44] them forever
[20:46] so friends this cannot be thus saith the
[20:47] lord that the eagle age is spoken of in
[20:50] malachi 1 verse 4. it seems here brother
[20:52] branham had a slip of the tongue and met
[20:54] malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6.
[20:57] but again this proves not every word on
[20:58] tape is thus saith the lord
[21:01] number 40 is again from the fourth seal
[21:03] brother braham said there were only
[21:05] 700 that had not bowed the knee to baal
[21:08] in the days of elijah quote he had 700
[21:11] that never bowed down to them creeds
[21:13] that they had end quote now of course
[21:16] almost everyone knows who's listened to
[21:18] the seven seals that brother rand later
[21:19] corrected this
[21:20] he said he knew it was seven thousand he
[21:22] just said seven hundred and he
[21:24] apologized for that he said i do these
[21:25] kind of mistakes all the time
[21:27] and of course the bible tells us as well
[21:29] there were seven thousand god himself
[21:31] told us seven thousand had not bowed the
[21:34] knee
[21:34] so again not every word on tape is thus
[21:36] saith the lord
[21:38] number 41 brother ram said quote all the
[21:41] messengers come at the end of the age
[21:44] end quote
[21:45] friends this statement by brother
[21:46] branham cannot be thus saith the lord
[21:48] first according to brother ramsey's
[21:49] dates columba didn't even live within
[21:51] his age
[21:53] so that would mean no human messenger
[21:54] came at the end of the third tier in
[21:57] church age
[21:58] but of course i believe columbus did
[21:59] live within the thirty or church age and
[22:01] he came at the beginning of the age
[22:03] i believe history proves and the bible
[22:05] proves that all the messengers came at
[22:07] the beginning or towards the beginning
[22:09] of their ages
[22:10] second it's playing paul iranius martin
[22:13] luther wesley and brother branham came
[22:15] at the beginning of their ages
[22:17] now some try to say that brother branham
[22:20] meant the messengers came at the end of
[22:22] the previous age well if they believe
[22:24] that they're not saying what the tapes
[22:26] say because the tapes say all the
[22:27] messengers come at the end of the age
[22:30] and of course this wouldn't make sense
[22:31] for brother branham brother ram's
[22:32] message started going worldwide around
[22:35] 1946 and 47 and the laodicean church age
[22:38] had already started in 1906
[22:40] so brother ramsey's message does not
[22:41] start at the end of the philadelphian
[22:44] church age
[22:45] because it already had ended by 1906.
[22:48] number 42
[22:50] brother brown apologized for making
[22:52] himself something rather than god
[22:54] in questions and answers on the seals
[22:56] quote
[22:57] i could take that person now by the help
[22:58] of god and tie them in such a knot it
[23:00] make their head swim
[23:02] look i don't care what now i don't mean
[23:04] now that don't sound right forgive me i
[23:06] didn't mean that lord i didn't know
[23:08] i didn't now i i felt him check me on
[23:11] that
[23:12] see so i didn't mean to say it that way
[23:14] i'm i'm sorry
[23:15] i just don't even want to be myself or
[23:18] nothing it's him he didn't like that see
[23:20] that was putting me in there see end
[23:23] quote
[23:24] so here brother branham exalts himself a
[23:26] little bit and the holy spirit checks
[23:27] him and makes him humble himself and
[23:30] realize brother ram could not make a
[23:31] man's head swim
[23:33] again it's brother random being very
[23:34] humble but notice brother am apologized
[23:37] but then in 1958 the handwriting on the
[23:39] wall
[23:40] brother branham said quote god doesn't
[23:41] have to apologize to nobody or nothing
[23:43] end quote
[23:45] so again not every word on the tapes are
[23:46] thus saith the lord because brother adam
[23:48] said god doesn't have to apologize but
[23:50] then brother branham apologized and said
[23:52] he was making himself something
[23:55] also this quote is helpful to anyone who
[23:56] would say well i'm taking brother rams
[23:59] statements during the seven seals
[24:00] because they were more inspired
[24:03] of course i believe brother ram sermons
[24:04] were very inspired in the seventh seal
[24:06] but it doesn't mean every word was thus
[24:08] saith the lord during the seven seals
[24:10] sermons because this is just another
[24:12] example to go along with the 7 000 or
[24:14] 700 quote that we already
[24:16] heard friends we've come to the end of
[24:19] part two
[24:20] we've now gone through 42 proofs that
[24:22] not every word on tape was thus saith
[24:24] the lord lord willing we'll have one
[24:26] more part
[24:27] in part three we'll go through the
[24:28] remaining 26 proofs that not every word
[24:31] on tape was thus saith the lord for a
[24:33] total of 68. again i'll probably put
[24:35] this audio on a separate podcast because
[24:38] some people prefer the podcast format
[24:41] and thank you for all your prayers and
[24:43] all your support as we seek to rightly
[24:45] divide the word of truth by the spirit
[24:46] of truth the holy ghost
[24:48] thank you friends for all your support
[24:50] and positive feedback god bless you and
[24:52] may jesus christ be the desire of your
[24:55] heart
