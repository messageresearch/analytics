[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:14] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and I'm amen
[0:17] Lee we're thankful to be having another
[0:19] podcast by the grace of God and today
[0:21] we're bringing a new testimony from a
[0:23] Believer our sister Hua but before we
[0:26] get into the testimony I just want to
[0:27] say thank you for all the positive
[0:29] feedback I've received numerous comments
[0:31] on YouTube and numerous emails thanking
[0:34] our church for these wonderful
[0:36] testimonies from Sister Naomi to brother
[0:38] Austin and to brother amen and my own
[0:40] and so we feel like this has been a
[0:42] great encouragement to the people we're
[0:44] almost at a thousand downloads now
[0:46] um so we can see how God is using these
[0:48] podcasts to help people all around the
[0:51] world so we're grateful for that and
[0:53] also I want to let the listeners know at
[0:54] some point I would like to address some
[0:55] of the more recent accusations where uh
[0:58] the accusers of brother Branham are
[0:59] bringing out all these claims that
[1:01] brother random was racist or he was a
[1:03] polygamist or even worse claims of
[1:07] course we know those are wrong of course
[1:08] we know that's presumption but I just
[1:10] want to let the listeners know I'm aware
[1:12] of them I listen to almost all those
[1:13] podcasts so that I can be prepared to
[1:16] give answers later on and I have
[1:18] answered some of those emails some
[1:19] people have asked me directly through
[1:20] email about some of those accusations
[1:22] and I've tried to answer them and at
[1:24] some point I hope to address those by
[1:26] the grace of God but now we want to
[1:28] transition here into our testimony from
[1:29] our sister Hua and of course she's
[1:31] brother amen's wife and God has made
[1:34] amen and sister Hua just pillars in our
[1:36] church over these years and we're
[1:37] excited to learn about how God has
[1:39] called our sister and all the
[1:42] testimonies that God has done in her
[1:43] life okay we're about to ask the first
[1:45] question
[1:46] what was your childhood like when you
[1:49] heard about God so I grew up going to
[1:51] church All My Life
[1:53] um going to a Baptist church and then
[1:55] going to the CMA church right afterwards
[1:58] I mean at a very young age I didn't
[2:00] really know much about God because it
[2:02] was not really spoken at home and it was
[2:04] not really taught
[2:06] and it was just oh you go to church and
[2:08] you just learn it from the Sunday School
[2:10] teachers there
[2:12] and then when the preacher is preaching
[2:14] you don't really have a clue what he is
[2:16] saying because you're young
[2:17] and you're like a little child and all
[2:19] you want to do is just play
[2:21] so that was that was typically me and
[2:24] then you know throughout the years
[2:26] growing up being in the youth group
[2:28] you just start learning more about God
[2:30] there but then it wasn't like stable it
[2:34] wasn't stable stable where I was
[2:36] completely Anchored In
[2:38] wanting to know more about Jesus you
[2:41] know it's just more of going there to
[2:43] just hang out with your friends and just
[2:45] talk about random topics subjects that
[2:49] had nothing to do with Jesus yeah that
[2:52] sounds a lot like my childhood at least
[2:54] with my experience like I was raised in
[2:57] church my whole life but really it was
[2:59] more social for me I just wanted to go
[3:00] play with my friends or my brothers
[3:02] outside afterwards was there any time as
[3:05] a child that you felt like a great
[3:07] interest in God or was there any time
[3:10] you experienced any Supernatural with
[3:12] God
[3:13] practically wasn't only because it
[3:16] wasn't taught at home
[3:18] at an early age so it's more of you just
[3:21] go to church and you learn from there
[3:25] but then being at such a young age you
[3:28] know they they don't ingrain that into
[3:30] your like brain like you know you need
[3:32] to love God you need to seek or search
[3:35] for God and get to know God it was just
[3:37] it was just very dry yeah I appreciate
[3:39] you sharing that you know unfortunately
[3:41] that's the condition of a lot of
[3:43] churches here in America and probably
[3:45] around the world a lot of dry
[3:47] experiences where a lot of people that
[3:49] go to church that's the only time they
[3:50] think about God that's the only time
[3:52] they actually care to hear God's word
[3:54] and so it's a great lesson you can learn
[3:56] from a young age that wow God in the
[3:58] Bible have to be more than just talked
[4:00] about at church whatever you learn about
[4:02] God has to be brought home so the
[4:04] reality of the Christian's life is that
[4:06] they talk about Jesus at church they
[4:08] sing about Jesus at church but then they
[4:10] also allow his Spirit to come home with
[4:12] them and govern the rest of their lives
[4:14] yeah tell us more about the youth group
[4:16] what was the overall attitude towards
[4:19] God was it did they have some fear of
[4:21] the Lord or was it just a a dry
[4:23] experience to go and talk about about
[4:25] God I know in my life I had some fear of
[4:28] the Lord but once I left the church I
[4:31] was back into my rock and roll and my
[4:32] rap once I got out to the car so I'm
[4:34] just curious to know like in your youth
[4:35] group was it were there some sincere
[4:37] people that seemed to want to serve God
[4:39] or was it more just because you said
[4:41] there was really no stability or where
[4:43] the majority of them only there for
[4:44] social purposes
[4:46] some of the youth members I know they
[4:48] they
[4:49] would draw closer to to God
[4:51] but their lifestyle didn't represent
[4:54] that and their teachings I mean it was
[4:58] really really dry
[5:00] things that you you probably know but
[5:04] just can't relate to and um I mean their
[5:07] their life explains
[5:10] their belief in Jesus
[5:13] and there were some very sincere people
[5:15] there because they they would help or
[5:17] they would try their best to explain
[5:20] to us what Jesus meant to them or how
[5:23] Jesus can mean to us if we if we just
[5:27] seek him out I like to add I think
[5:30] Will's really trying to say is it's hard
[5:32] to explain something you have no
[5:34] experience in so they're describing
[5:38] something that they don't have and
[5:40] they're trying to teach something that
[5:41] they don't have and that's what we
[5:42] experience at these churches yeah I
[5:45] agree with both of you 100 you keep
[5:47] bringing up that word dry what's the
[5:48] opposite of dry wet what's that make us
[5:51] think of Living Water
[5:53] right Jesus says when you're born again
[5:55] he said the Holy Ghost will be like
[5:56] Living Waters flowing out of you so you
[5:59] have people talking about the water
[6:01] talking about the The Life of Christ but
[6:04] don't have any water to show for it
[6:07] okay and so that's what the ministry of
[6:09] brother Branham did and of course John
[6:11] Wesley and Martin Luther and the Saints
[6:14] the day of Pentecost they preached the
[6:16] reality of Jesus Christ and people had a
[6:18] real experience and they just didn't
[6:20] talk about the water but they
[6:22] experienced the Waters of Life flowing
[6:24] from their own bellies as Jesus said
[6:27] so in other words we can see how the
[6:30] church you were raised in and even mine
[6:31] lacked the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[6:34] by God's grace we experienced that today
[6:36] by his Mercy
[6:39] well it's a huge difference coming out
[6:41] from a denominational Church to The
[6:42] Message Church you know I I experienced
[6:44] more of God and I
[6:46] pretty much know more about God and The
[6:48] Messengers than I do in a denominational
[6:50] Church
[6:51] it's like in a denominational Church our
[6:53] mind just isn't your mind's on Jesus yes
[6:56] but it's not up there like where you
[6:59] need to know about Jesus like really
[7:01] really get to know him
[7:03] compared to when you come into the
[7:04] message you're like okay I know this I
[7:07] know that it's like
[7:09] you just know your rights from wrongs
[7:10] yeah I can totally relate to that you
[7:12] know I was raised in church in a
[7:14] Pentecostal church and really I didn't
[7:16] know anything other than maybe John 3
[7:19] 16. that's probably all I knew and if
[7:21] you if anybody want to ask me any
[7:23] question about salvation or Roman
[7:25] Catholicism or the holy ghost or
[7:27] Miracles I would have had nothing to say
[7:29] because alls I knew was John 3 16 and of
[7:32] course that was partly my fault too
[7:34] because I wasn't seeking God but if I
[7:37] would have it still would have been
[7:38] limited by denomination we know God sent
[7:41] this message to bring his people out of
[7:43] denominations the mother Harlot Roman
[7:45] Catholic church and all the daughter
[7:47] harlots as well right and we hear at
[7:50] least on this podcast we're all a part
[7:51] of denominations we're all part of the
[7:53] the mother-daughter system so thank God
[7:55] he's called us out of those systems and
[7:57] now God's not limited we do not limit
[7:59] the Holy One of Israel but we allow him
[8:01] to move in our lives as he wants to
[8:05] foreign
[8:09] we're moving on to our second question
[8:10] when and why did you finally surrender
[8:13] to Jesus and repent or in other words uh
[8:16] when was the moment you received Christ
[8:18] as your savior and the Bible says then
[8:20] you're justified by faith so it was
[8:23] during my high school years when things
[8:26] just went out of hand and went whack
[8:28] that I started praying more and I
[8:31] usually didn't do that but every night
[8:34] it was just constant prayer every single
[8:37] night
[8:39] um and then it it led me out throughout
[8:42] the throughout my high school year I I
[8:44] started seeking more of God I I wanted
[8:46] to know the truth of God
[8:48] and so
[8:50] that's what I did throughout High School
[8:52] I it was like self-teaching myself
[8:55] the word and and just being in prayer
[8:58] and then right after high school after I
[9:00] graduated
[9:02] well let me let me say during my last
[9:05] during my junior my senior year I can't
[9:08] recall which but it was when I was
[9:11] introduced it to the message through my
[9:14] sisters
[9:15] and then I I knew that things were
[9:18] getting real and I knew that guy was
[9:20] real
[9:21] and so I I just listened to my sisters
[9:25] and their their experiences of being in
[9:28] the message and then right then after
[9:30] high school was when I wanted to get
[9:32] baptized
[9:34] just like them that's great and I'm
[9:36] starting to see the whole picture of
[9:37] your testimony sister that's really good
[9:40] because I remember all this
[9:43] as far as I remember meeting you so it
[9:46] looks like by God's grace God was
[9:49] drawing you before we met and before
[9:52] your sisters introduced you to the Bible
[9:55] revelations that God gave to brother
[9:57] Branham so it's awesome to see God was
[9:58] drawing you in advance
[10:00] through consistent prayer seeking God
[10:04] studying the Bible yourself God was
[10:06] drawing nigh unto you as you were
[10:09] drawing nigh into him and then at the
[10:11] moment you wanted to be saved God had
[10:14] your sisters witness to you about the
[10:15] water baptism and then I remember that
[10:18] beautiful day where you and your
[10:20] siblings come down to Portage Lakes and
[10:23] we baptize you and buried you in the
[10:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we got
[10:26] pictures to prove it was such a great
[10:27] time in the Lord you were so happy so
[10:29] full of joy praise God yes
[10:31] can you tell us kind of what your
[10:33] sisters talked to you about at first do
[10:34] you remember what they were saying and
[10:36] then what led to your baptism and
[10:38] ultimately being saved
[10:40] um I I don't really quite remember the
[10:43] words they uh used but I think I'll just
[10:45] paraphrase they came home almost every
[10:48] single Sunday well I was still attending
[10:51] the night the denominational churches
[10:53] they were already in the message and
[10:55] they would come almost every single
[10:56] Sunday and they would just teach and
[10:59] tell me things of the Bibles that I I
[11:01] never even knew sins that were wrong you
[11:04] know
[11:05] the revelations behind every every story
[11:10] of the Bible and you know it was just
[11:12] eye-opening and I'm like oh I never knew
[11:16] that was a sin I didn't know we were
[11:17] wearing earrings was a sin
[11:20] and so you know they would just come
[11:23] home every single day and telling me how
[11:25] great of an experience they had and you
[11:28] know I wanted to experience that myself
[11:31] so I I thought a lot about it prayed a
[11:34] lot about it and that's what led me to
[11:37] want to get baptized the same way as
[11:39] them that is awesome you know I was
[11:42] never there at your house during those
[11:43] meetings but I was there at the services
[11:45] I was preaching to your sisters and cam
[11:47] was preaching to your sister Simon was
[11:49] brother Randy was preaching to your
[11:50] sister so it's awesome to see that they
[11:52] were soaking that in absorbing and what
[11:54] a great lesson for our sisters and even
[11:56] Brothers even if Brothers even if you're
[11:57] not a preacher you can go home and
[11:58] testify about what the Lord said at
[12:01] church and everybody said
[12:04] that's beautiful I wouldn't do the same
[12:05] thing I want to go home and talk about
[12:07] what the word of God was about and what
[12:09] God did oh God heard Lena's prayer God
[12:12] heard God answered Naomi's prayer God
[12:14] heard brother William's prayer like I
[12:15] love that your sisters were hearing the
[12:17] testimonies hearing the revelations
[12:19] being taught the word of God and it's
[12:21] Purity going home to testify and that
[12:24] proved you had a seed of God on the
[12:25] inside of you because when the word of
[12:27] God started coming to you you just
[12:29] instantly received it it drove you to
[12:31] more prayer drove you to more Bible
[12:33] study so it's beautiful to see how God
[12:35] used our little Ministry a really humble
[12:37] tiny small little Ministry and then your
[12:40] sisters to share the word of God with
[12:43] you kind of like how Simon heard the
[12:46] revelation of the message and then came
[12:47] and testified to me about it for months
[12:49] until he had a chance to sit down with
[12:51] me and share the word of God with me so
[12:53] wonderful beautiful testimony
[12:59] is there anything specific like right
[13:01] after you were baptized and out of high
[13:02] school you want to get into next now
[13:04] this stage of life you're repented
[13:06] you're baptized anything like after that
[13:09] you want to share about I was in a a
[13:13] relationship that wasn't God's will if I
[13:18] can just put it that way
[13:21] and
[13:22] you know a guy really opened up my eyes
[13:24] and he's like and and I was you know you
[13:28] get that feeling like I shouldn't do
[13:30] this and I shouldn't do that
[13:33] and so I I knew I had to just stop
[13:36] I had to just stop doing what I used to
[13:39] do and just
[13:40] just turn turn myself away from such
[13:43] sins and
[13:44] uh that specific person didn't really
[13:47] quite understand what I was saying
[13:51] and I specifically told this person that
[13:53] you know I at this point I feel like God
[13:56] was really dealing with me harshly and
[13:59] he didn't want me to
[14:01] be in this
[14:02] kind of relationship like I had like it
[14:05] was such a huge burden on me like him
[14:09] telling me get out like get out get out
[14:12] of this relationship
[14:13] like you shouldn't even you shouldn't be
[14:16] in this kind of relationship
[14:18] you know
[14:20] and so I I had to make a cut decision
[14:24] and so I you know it was between
[14:27] listening to God or just
[14:30] being my old self and just going on with
[14:32] with life and so I I made a cut decision
[14:35] and I obeyed God and left the
[14:38] relationship
[14:40] and it was the best decision ever
[14:42] it really was
[14:45] that's a beautiful story you know you
[14:47] get saved and you get baptized you're
[14:49] forgiven and then instantly the Holy
[14:51] Spirit starts dealing with you like you
[14:53] said it was just undeniable God's voice
[14:57] telling you you've got to end this
[14:59] and this is not my will and what a great
[15:02] testimony that you were a child of God
[15:03] because you obeyed
[15:06] and you listened and you're willing to
[15:08] forsake everything in the past leave it
[15:10] all behind and walk in the newness of
[15:12] Life the Bible says
[15:14] and the Beautiful part about
[15:15] Christianity is the Bible said through
[15:16] the blood of Jesus Christ all of our
[15:18] sins are forgiven all the trespasses are
[15:21] forgiven all the sins are remitted
[15:23] thrown away and they're tossed in the
[15:24] sea of forgetfulness praise God
[15:26] and then the Bible says we're new
[15:28] creatures in Christ Jesus the Bible says
[15:31] old things are passed away behold all
[15:32] things are become new
[15:34] so God was doing something new on the
[15:36] inside God was making you a new creature
[15:39] and so the next step is for God to clean
[15:41] you out
[15:42] and you listen to the Holy Spirit what a
[15:44] great testimony praise God
[15:46] and I remember
[15:48] um the night when I
[15:51] went ice and ship and I ended it that I
[15:53] went to my sisters
[15:56] and you know I I had to confess
[16:01] and they were they they were really
[16:02] sweet to me
[16:04] and they
[16:06] they helped me through that time and I
[16:08] remember crying and
[16:09] praying that night repenting to God to
[16:12] ask him for to forgive me for such
[16:16] was such a thing
[16:19] and so and I was very thankful too
[16:21] because I was in college too and I
[16:22] didn't have class the following mornings
[16:25] I was able to sleep in for the time
[16:28] being but
[16:31] wait yes and I mean the following
[16:34] morning when I woke up after I repented
[16:36] you know I felt so much better like the
[16:39] chains were off
[16:41] you know like I felt like I was really
[16:43] set free from it and it it didn't bother
[16:45] me ever since
[16:48] you know it's awesome to hear about
[16:50] um your genuine repentance sister you
[16:52] know and how you woke up feeling totally
[16:54] free I mean that's exactly what the
[16:56] gospel is supposed to do the gospel is
[16:58] good news
[17:00] right and when we confess our sins the
[17:02] Bible says Jesus is faithful and just to
[17:05] forgive us of our sins and cleanse us
[17:07] from all unrighteousness so look at the
[17:09] just look at the beautiful power of
[17:11] confession like Lord I'm sorry
[17:13] it was my fault and then you wake up
[17:15] feeling like a brand new person and you
[17:18] don't have school the next day so God
[17:19] gave you some he showed you some favor
[17:21] there and gave you some rest so you
[17:22] could sleep in
[17:24] um but then also God provided you know
[17:26] your sisters there like the Bible says
[17:28] gave you good comforters you know God
[17:30] gave you some good comforters there are
[17:31] some people that would lead you into
[17:33] prayer and support you and be with you
[17:37] when you really needed somebody to pray
[17:39] with you and and someone to just be with
[17:42] you in a moment of repentance to me it's
[17:45] also beautiful too like God gave you
[17:46] numerous Witnesses of your repentance
[17:49] you know that's a great thing to have
[17:50] you know in mouth of two or three
[17:51] Witnesses let every word be established
[17:54] and so another reason it makes me happy
[17:56] is because I see your constant love for
[17:58] God you know you'll come up for prayer
[17:59] every couple weeks or every couple
[18:01] months
[18:02] and it's undeniable you have a heart for
[18:04] Jesus Christ you know you just keep
[18:06] coming up at different times for prayer
[18:08] requests it's almost like I can see
[18:10] through your actions you know a genuine
[18:12] sincerity a pure love for Jesus Christ
[18:15] pure love for God
[18:17] and so I can see and easily understand
[18:19] how you know that moment was a great
[18:21] moment you know your the chains are
[18:23] broken from an unhealthy relationship
[18:25] you've obeyed the word of God and God
[18:28] set you free I'd love to hear about that
[18:30] because I I we can see the fruits of
[18:32] that decision today how you're walking
[18:34] in the beauty of Holiness you're walking
[18:36] with God
[18:38] so dedicated to God serving God with all
[18:41] of your heart it's beautiful to hear
[18:42] about that and then to see the fruits of
[18:44] that decision so many years later and
[18:47] also this testimony is important for
[18:49] anyone who may be in a relationship now
[18:51] that you know is not the will of God
[18:53] you know what's beautiful is that
[18:54] brother Bram said your decision about
[18:56] marriage is the second greatest decision
[18:58] in your life and so you were in a
[19:01] relationship that you know God showed
[19:03] you was wrong you step right out of it
[19:05] and now God's given you the right
[19:07] relationship praise God and so what a
[19:09] great testimony this is to anyone who
[19:11] may be struggling with the will of God
[19:13] now or not sure about the will of God
[19:15] for relationship
[19:16] so we can learn that just draw night to
[19:18] God through like your prayers you're
[19:20] talking about your Bible reading you
[19:21] know
[19:22] searching the Bible yourself we have
[19:25] that confidence then that if we're
[19:26] seeking God and we're reading the word
[19:28] and we're praying God is going to give
[19:29] us the right relationship we can trust
[19:31] God he will guide us maybe out of a
[19:34] relationship and he'll give us the right
[19:35] relationship so what a great lesson your
[19:38] testimony is for others that they can
[19:39] learn that same thing
[19:41] if you seek God with all your heart
[19:43] you'll find him if you want to do the
[19:45] perfect will of God he'll give it to you
[19:48] foreign
[19:51] yeah so building off upon that testimony
[19:53] of how you came out of an unhealthy
[19:55] relationship it was still a desire of
[19:58] your heart to find the right man the man
[20:01] that God had for you for marriage and so
[20:03] can you tell us about that how God LED
[20:05] you to the right man that he wanted you
[20:07] to marry and how God Vindicated it to
[20:10] you and how you knew it was the perfect
[20:12] will of God
[20:13] so after leaving the unhealthy
[20:16] relationship I remember praying one
[20:21] night asking God
[20:23] for a good loving God-fearing husband
[20:29] I I wasn't specific about how the way
[20:33] this person will look how tall this
[20:36] person would be but as long as this
[20:39] person had a heart to do God's Will and
[20:43] to obey God in everything and word and
[20:45] indeed that
[20:48] that will be the one that God would want
[20:50] me to marry
[20:51] and so from
[20:54] 2007 all the way to 2014 I said this
[20:58] prayer in 2007 I completely forgot about
[21:02] it for a few years and throughout those
[21:06] few years
[21:07] I've I've courted people but the
[21:10] relationship just didn't go right that
[21:13] there was nothing that was
[21:16] gluing me to these people that I was
[21:19] courting like there was always something
[21:21] that was off
[21:23] like a red flag and it just didn't work
[21:26] out
[21:27] and in 2011
[21:29] at the CMA Church uh I was introduced it
[21:33] to my spouse which is right now and I I
[21:37] didn't know he was going to be my spouse
[21:40] I all I remember was you were doing
[21:44] fresh and ready but throughout the years
[21:47] you know
[21:49] I I only
[21:51] see my spouse as a friend and and
[21:53] nothing more until we had a youth
[21:57] gathering at someone's house
[21:59] and this is when my spouse was newly
[22:03] introduced into the message and
[22:05] when he got baptized but he didn't know
[22:08] that I was baptized the exact same way
[22:12] and we were at the stairs talking while
[22:15] we were eating and you know I I was
[22:18] introducing him to serpency
[22:21] I didn't know much about serpency
[22:23] because I wasn't in the message to to
[22:26] really know about it and I had to learn
[22:28] it so I can teach others about it but I
[22:31] I just gave this simple and the basic
[22:34] information or what I knew about serpent
[22:36] seed and
[22:38] you know he he was like shocked like
[22:40] really
[22:42] he had to go home and do some research
[22:45] himself to make sure that was it but
[22:49] from the from that night when we we
[22:52] found out that we were both you know
[22:54] baptized correctly and we both were
[22:57] believing almost the exact same thing as
[22:59] what Drew us together and the connection
[23:02] was just there
[23:04] and so that was like seven years and
[23:07] then it was like 2014 was when
[23:10] God brought it back to my remembrance
[23:12] and and I remember the prayer that I
[23:15] said back in 2007 like what I asked for
[23:19] and a husband and I knew I received it
[23:23] then
[23:24] it's awesome to see how God gave you a
[23:26] husband as a direct answer to your
[23:28] prayer
[23:29] again showing how God is so personal and
[23:32] if you delight yourself in him he'll
[23:34] give you the desires of your heart what
[23:36] your testimony is a beautiful
[23:37] Vindication of that promise from God
[23:40] that if you are true worshiper
[23:42] worshiping God and spirit and truth and
[23:45] you ask something from the Lord the Lord
[23:46] is going to give it to you
[23:48] and that reminds me of you know earlier
[23:49] this year you know you had a a difficult
[23:52] uh life situation
[23:54] and then the Lord reminded you how you
[23:57] had to wait for the right husband a
[23:59] godly man a man that loved the Lord with
[24:01] all of his heart
[24:03] so maybe can you share a little bit
[24:04] about that how God had to remind you
[24:06] that even though you had to wait for the
[24:09] right husband God gave you the right one
[24:11] a more honorable husband than other
[24:14] brothers and then how God used that to
[24:17] encourage you to keep waiting for more
[24:19] Promises of God to be answered in your
[24:21] life
[24:22] so it was the beginning of this year uh
[24:27] I I was growing a bit impatient but I
[24:30] knew I had to to wait and see what God
[24:33] has in store for me and I remember it
[24:36] was after
[24:37] service that I went up for prayer for a
[24:40] debt situation for a house for children
[24:45] and uh
[24:47] my pastor prayed over me and I went back
[24:49] to uh my seat and while I was worshiping
[24:54] a voice spoke and said
[24:58] remember when you prayed for your
[25:00] husband and remember when you waited for
[25:04] seven years for your husband
[25:07] didn't I give you the desires of your
[25:09] heart that you asked for
[25:13] and I thought about it and I and I'm
[25:15] like yes
[25:17] like yes God you you did answer that
[25:19] prayer you know I'm thinking about it
[25:22] while I'm hearing the voice and he said
[25:26] don't you want to wait
[25:28] for
[25:30] um your your prayers to be answered just
[25:32] as you waited for your your husband that
[25:34] you pray for
[25:36] and he he brought a song to my
[25:39] remembrance
[25:40] um it's uh
[25:42] a promise of a lifetime
[25:45] I forgot the band who who sung that song
[25:48] okay
[25:49] but that song came to me in my mind and
[25:54] and uh
[25:56] it just gave me courage and it just made
[26:00] me feel a lot better to know that God
[26:03] has everything under control
[26:06] and that he will bring to pass
[26:10] what I ask for in prayer as long as it's
[26:13] in his will to do so
[26:15] and
[26:17] The Voice also spoke he mentioned you
[26:21] know didn't I give you the good loving
[26:24] God-fearing husband
[26:27] like didn't you ask for this husband and
[26:30] I gave you the best one that would be
[26:33] the one that God would want me to marry
[26:36] and you know it took me a while to think
[26:39] about it and I'm like yes because look
[26:42] where I'm standing now
[26:46] I'm I'm still
[26:48] I'm still believing this message I'm I'm
[26:51] still doing what God is asking me to do
[26:53] I'm still obeying the word
[26:55] and you know I just see the fruit of it
[26:59] and I just see God's hand and everything
[27:01] in every situation
[27:04] that sounds like a very scriptural voice
[27:06] because you know God would tell Abraham
[27:08] is anything too hard for the Lord you
[27:10] know and then David would recall
[27:13] if God help me with the to defeat the
[27:15] bear and the lion then surely he'll be
[27:17] with me in this situation so it seems
[27:20] like a very scriptural voice God
[27:21] reminding you if I gave you the desire
[27:23] of your heart related to the choice of
[27:25] your husband and I gave you the best
[27:27] husband for you who was more honorable
[27:29] than other brothers than surely
[27:32] I'll still answer your other prayer
[27:34] requests in my time and season it's just
[27:36] like God how God Is So merciful it
[27:39] matches God's character that he makes
[27:41] everything beautiful in his time God
[27:43] gave you the right marriage relationship
[27:44] in his time and we're going to trust God
[27:46] is going to answer all these other
[27:48] requests in his time because it sounds
[27:50] like a very scriptural voice
[27:56] that's the end of the first part of this
[27:58] testimony and I hope that you guys come
[28:00] and listen to the rest of this testimony
[28:02] and yet you would be blessed by it yeah
[28:04] we're certainly blessed by part one
[28:05] looking forward to part two and it's
[28:08] just special for me because sister I've
[28:10] seen I've seen you and your family come
[28:12] in the message one by one over the last
[28:15] 20 years and so I was there when you
[28:18] were baptized I had the blessing of
[28:20] being the one who baptized you and since
[28:23] then we've just I've just seen you grow
[28:24] in faith over all these years and
[28:27] getting these stories behind the scenes
[28:30] is really wonderful and this has been
[28:32] really encouraging for me because I get
[28:34] to know more about what was going on and
[28:36] how God was working behind the scenes in
[28:38] ways that I didn't see so we're looking
[28:40] forward to part two next time by God's
[28:41] grace
[28:42] and we appreciate you listening to this
[28:45] podcast and downloading it God bless you
