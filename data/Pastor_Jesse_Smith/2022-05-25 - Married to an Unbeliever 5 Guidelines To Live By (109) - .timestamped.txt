[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:11] names the lord jesus christ
[0:14] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:16] viewer's question
[0:17] how does a holy woman live when her
[0:19] husband is in sin
[0:22] lord willing i'll do my best by the
[0:23] scriptures and the leading of the holy
[0:25] ghost to give answers for both a holy
[0:27] woman who's married to a sinful man
[0:30] and a holy man who's married to a sinful
[0:32] woman
[0:34] first matthew 6 verse 33 tells everyone
[0:37] married or single to seek jesus's
[0:39] righteousness first
[0:41] make it your first desire to seek jesus
[0:44] righteousness daily confessing your sins
[0:47] and dying to all selfish desires
[0:50] as paul said i die daily in first
[0:53] corinthians 15
[0:55] 31
[0:56] the earlier in the day you read your
[0:58] bible pray and die to your selfishness
[1:01] and seek to express jesus's
[1:03] righteousness in your life or in other
[1:06] words obedience to every word of god the
[1:08] more victory you'll see in your life
[1:11] and in your family the lord willing
[1:13] this is according to matthew 6 33 but
[1:16] seek ye first the kingdom of god in his
[1:18] righteousness and all these things
[1:20] should be added unto you
[1:22] and first corinthians 15 31 says i
[1:25] protest by your rejoicing which i have
[1:27] in christ jesus our lord i die daily
[1:31] by putting jesus first you will ensure
[1:34] you love christ jesus more than anything
[1:36] or anyone else
[1:38] as commanded by christ in matthew 10
[1:40] verses 36-38 which says and a man's foes
[1:44] shall be they of his own household he
[1:47] that loveth father or mother more than
[1:49] me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:51] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[1:54] not worthy of me
[1:55] and he that taketh not his cross and
[1:57] fouleth after me is not worthy of me
[2:01] so jesus says following him will be like
[2:03] taking up a cross which is a slow death
[2:05] to self
[2:06] a slow death to selfishness
[2:09] and the fact that you take up this cross
[2:11] shows that you love jesus more than
[2:12] anything else
[2:14] based upon matthew chapter 10 verse 37 i
[2:17] want to share a few quotes from god's
[2:19] prophet brother branham that go along
[2:21] with this first guideline for believing
[2:24] spouses to seek jesus's righteousness
[2:26] first
[2:27] and always obey god's word first
[2:30] in this first quote from questions and
[2:32] answers part 4 1964 brother ram tells a
[2:36] believing wife who's being persecuted by
[2:38] her unbelieving husband that she does
[2:40] not have to stop reading her bible and
[2:42] that her husband cannot refuse her to
[2:45] read her bible or go to church and then
[2:47] brother adam quotes matthew 10 verse 37
[2:50] let's listen to the quote
[2:52] brother branham
[2:54] the bible tells us that a wife should
[2:57] obey her husband i am a christian and my
[3:00] husband is a sinner he uh
[3:04] persecutes me in every way that he can
[3:08] and for me not to go to church
[3:10] and read my bible and
[3:14] and denies the word what should i do
[3:19] what should you do
[3:21] now listen
[3:22] you're supposed to obey your husband
[3:24] that's the word
[3:26] now if he tells you and refuses you to
[3:28] read the bible go to church or something
[3:31] like that you don't have to obey that
[3:33] because he that won't forsake his father
[3:36] mother husband wife whatever it is and
[3:38] follow me is not worthy of mine is that
[3:39] right no don't the man i suppose
[3:42] you're not a man's not supposed to use
[3:44] that authority over a woman just because
[3:46] he's her ruler god is her ruler above
[3:49] you brother see
[3:50] and if your wife is doing something
[3:52] wrong then don't uh now you can got a
[3:55] right to tell her she's supposed to
[3:56] listen to you but you ain't got no right
[3:57] to beat her or drag her around or do
[3:59] those things she god made man a helpmate
[4:03] not a doormat
[4:05] remember she she was your sweetheart she
[4:08] should always be that
[4:11] here's another quote from questions and
[4:13] answers part 2 1964 where brother
[4:16] branham again tells a believing
[4:17] christian woman who has a sinner husband
[4:20] that she does not have to obey his
[4:22] commands for her to cut her hair wear
[4:25] shorts or go to ungodly places the
[4:27] believing wife doesn't have to be
[4:29] subject to these sinful suggestions or
[4:31] sinful commands from her sinful husband
[4:34] brother braham says you're not bound to
[4:36] that in other words you're not bound to
[4:37] disobey the word of god and he tells the
[4:39] woman you might have to separate from
[4:41] everything for god notice brother braham
[4:43] said that the woman must seek first the
[4:45] kingdom of god in his righteousness
[4:47] quoting matthew chapter 6 33 showing
[4:50] again that a believing spouse must honor
[4:52] god first and obey every word of god
[4:55] that she or he possibly can and try to
[4:57] live at peace with their unbelieving
[4:59] spouse if at all possible let's listen
[5:02] to the quote
[5:04] also brother branham
[5:05] i believe a woman should be
[5:08] subject to her husband
[5:10] but if a christian woman has a center
[5:13] husband who does not
[5:16] even
[5:18] to one of your services come to one of
[5:21] your services and won't
[5:23] and wants his wife to be doing things
[5:27] cutting her hair wearing shorts and
[5:29] going to ungodly places
[5:32] is this woman supposed to be subject to
[5:35] this man
[5:36] in this way please explain this more
[5:40] clearly as this is a question that is
[5:43] asked often
[5:45] no sister
[5:47] you are not subject to such a person
[5:50] no indeed
[5:51] for this cause
[5:53] you'll leave everything and cleave to
[5:55] god now the thing if you want that man
[5:57] wants to live with you and you be stay a
[5:59] christian but if he's going to make you
[6:02] wear shorts
[6:03] cut your hair and do all these other
[6:04] things in ungodly places you seek first
[6:07] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[6:09] you're not bound to such a person as
[6:11] that but as long the bible says as
[6:14] she is pleased and he is pleased to
[6:17] dwell together
[6:18] you remember that
[6:20] let them and now these i didn't put the
[6:22] scriptures out because i just picked
[6:23] them up you see a few minutes ago i pick
[6:25] up one now and then that i haven't got
[6:26] time but paul said that as long as they
[6:29] unbelieving husband has unbelieving or
[6:31] believing wife or so forth let the
[6:33] believing wife remain with the believing
[6:35] husband as long as it's not contrary now
[6:37] to god
[6:38] if he's pleased to dwell with her go
[6:40] ahead honey if you want to go to church
[6:41] that's all right but i ain't going i
[6:43] don't believe in it don't have nothing
[6:44] to do with it but you go ahead that's
[6:46] art but when he says you can't do it
[6:48] there's a different thing
[6:50] you're not bound to that then you
[6:52] separate everything for god
[6:57] second you should stay in your calling
[6:59] if god called you to serve him
[7:01] and you were married to a sinner remain
[7:03] married to the sinner as commanded by
[7:05] saint paul in first corinthians 7 verses
[7:08] 10 and 11
[7:09] 17
[7:11] and 20-24
[7:14] verse 11 says and unto the married i
[7:16] command yet not i but the lord let not
[7:19] the wife depart from her husband but and
[7:22] if she depart let her remain unmarried
[7:24] or be reconciled to her husband and let
[7:27] not the husband put away his wife
[7:30] note that a couple according to paul can
[7:32] separate due to one being a christian
[7:35] and the other not being a christian but
[7:37] they cannot marry again because they are
[7:39] bound by their vow until death
[7:43] verse 17 says but as god hath
[7:45] distributed to every man as the lord
[7:47] hath called everyone so let him walk and
[7:50] so ordain i in all churches
[7:53] verses 20 through 24 says let every man
[7:56] abide in the same calling wherein he was
[7:57] called
[7:58] art thou called being a servant care not
[8:01] for it but if thou mayest be made free
[8:03] use it rather
[8:04] for if he that is called in the lord
[8:06] being a servant is the lord's free man
[8:08] likewise also he that is called being
[8:11] free is christ's servant ye are bought
[8:13] with the price
[8:14] be not ye the servants of men brethren
[8:17] let every man
[8:18] wherein he is called abide
[8:20] therein abide with god
[8:23] remember friends as i mentioned in my
[8:25] previous video husbands love your wives
[8:27] as christ loved the church
[8:29] domestic abuse is never acceptable no
[8:31] one is obligated to take domestic abuse
[8:34] as the abuser is demon-possessed if
[8:37] abuse is happening know that god does
[8:39] not want you to be abused and you should
[8:41] seek physical and spiritual safety you
[8:44] should contact the local authorities as
[8:46] you're led by the holy ghost but as long
[8:48] as you can live together in peace then
[8:50] the bible tells us to remain in our
[8:52] calling third the reason you stay in
[8:55] your calling being married to a lost
[8:57] spouse is because your holy life will
[8:59] sanctify their unholy lives as paul
[9:02] wrote in first corinthians 7 verses
[9:04] 12-16
[9:06] but to the rest speak i not the lord if
[9:08] any man hath a wife that believeth not
[9:10] and she be pleased to dwell with him let
[9:12] him not put her away and if the woman
[9:15] which hath and the husband that
[9:16] believeth not and if he be pleased to
[9:18] dwell with her let her not leave him for
[9:21] the unbelieving husband is sanctified by
[9:23] the wife and the unbelieving wife is
[9:25] sanctified by the husband else were your
[9:28] children unclean but now are they holy
[9:32] notice paul says the influence of one
[9:34] believing spouse upon the children will
[9:37] make their lives holy in other words the
[9:39] godly parent will train the children
[9:41] according to christian moral standards
[9:43] and they will learn to know the ways of
[9:44] the lord as a child
[9:46] verse 15 says but if the unbelieving
[9:48] depart let him depart
[9:50] a brother or sister is not under bondage
[9:52] in such cases but god hath called us to
[9:55] peace
[9:57] again this shows how christians can be
[9:58] separated from an unbelieving spouse in
[10:00] a marriage but this scripture does not
[10:02] give permission for a christian partner
[10:05] to marry anyone else while their first
[10:07] spouse is still living remember all
[10:10] christians are bound by their marriage
[10:11] vows until death
[10:13] here's a quote from god's prophet
[10:15] brother branham from 1962 questions and
[10:17] answers brother branham specifically
[10:19] quotes first corinthians 7 verse 15
[10:22] about letting an unbelieving spouse
[10:23] depart but twice notice brother branham
[10:26] says but you can't remarry
[10:28] and not that you can remarry again again
[10:31] brother ram always taught believers were
[10:33] bound to their marriage vows until death
[10:35] and they could not remarry again if they
[10:37] had a living spouse because that would
[10:39] cause both to be adulterers
[10:41] let's listen to the
[10:45] the quote depart
[10:47] let him depart now if the unbeliever
[10:49] says i'm not going to live with you any
[10:51] longer you become a christian
[10:53] until a man tells his wife because you
[10:55] got saved go to get out of the world
[10:57] where was once then i'm going to leave
[10:59] you
[11:00] all ain't nothing you do about it let
[11:02] him depart see or the woman say to her
[11:04] husband i'm not going to mix up with
[11:06] that bunch of holy rollers i'm not going
[11:08] to do this i'll separate and leave you
[11:10] don't you leave the church you let her
[11:12] leave a brother our sister is not under
[11:16] bondage in such case
[11:18] that is if your companion is putting you
[11:20] away and wants to depart for it you
[11:22] don't have to just hold on to them if
[11:24] they want to leave you and they are
[11:25] going to leave you for the cause of
[11:26] christ let them leave but you can't
[11:29] remarry
[11:31] but god has called us unto peace
[11:34] now not that you can remarry again he's
[11:37] already stated that but you don't have
[11:39] to live with an unbelieving husband or
[11:42] an unbelieving wife
[11:44] if they are
[11:45] not willing if they're willing say now
[11:47] you go on to church if you want to go
[11:49] down there that's your business you want
[11:50] to go to your church you go ahead for me
[11:54] i don't believe it and i i'll do
[11:55] anything for you i'll not send in your
[11:57] way you go ahead then you just remain
[11:59] there knowing not that your sanctified
[12:01] life will sanctify that believer calls
[12:03] endlessly see either side man or woman
[12:06] you but now just to say i brother
[12:09] branham i got married my wife's
[12:11] unbeliever and here's the sister over
[12:13] here i can marry i'm gonna leave this
[12:14] and marry that one oh no
[12:17] no indeed
[12:18] your about is until death you separate
[12:22] and there's nothing else in the world
[12:24] will permit you to marry in the bible
[12:26] until your companion is dead
[12:29] that's right there are only grounds
[12:31] there's no remarrying nowhere at all
[12:33] except a dead companion that's all see
[12:37] you can't make it contradict itself
[12:41] verse 16 says for what knoweth thou o
[12:43] life whether thou shalt save thy husband
[12:45] or how knowest thou o man whether thou
[12:48] shalt save thy wife
[12:50] so see friends you don't know whether or
[12:51] not god will save your unbelieving
[12:53] spouse
[12:54] so paul's godly wisdom told us to abide
[12:56] in our marriages and to trust that our
[12:58] sanctified life will speak to the
[13:00] unbelieving spouse and hopefully cause
[13:02] them to repent and become christians as
[13:04] well
[13:05] there's two scriptures that give us
[13:07] insight on how this sanctification takes
[13:09] place
[13:10] in first timothy five verse fourteen and
[13:13] titus two verses four and five
[13:16] in first timothy five four paul said i
[13:18] will therefore that the younger women
[13:20] marry bear children guide the house give
[13:23] none occasion to the adversary to speak
[13:25] reproachfully
[13:27] notice paul said the wife can guide the
[13:30] home
[13:30] and guide means manage family affairs so
[13:33] the believing wife is not the boss of
[13:35] the home but she manages the home such
[13:38] as she manages the food preparation
[13:41] sometimes education
[13:43] the discipline of the children the
[13:44] training of the children and so much
[13:46] more in other words she has a lot of
[13:48] influence upon the home
[13:50] her every action can glorify jesus
[13:52] christ and that christian character will
[13:54] be seen by her unbelieving husband and
[13:56] her children
[13:58] titus 2 verses 4 and 5 say that they may
[14:01] teach the young women to be sober to
[14:02] love their husbands to love their
[14:04] children to be discreet chaste keepers
[14:07] at home
[14:08] good obedient to their own husbands that
[14:10] the word of god be not blasphemed
[14:13] so a christian wife has a huge
[14:16] responsibility even if her husband isn't
[14:18] saved to love her husband and her
[14:20] children to be discreet which in the
[14:22] greek means to have a sound mind to be
[14:25] sane
[14:26] self-control temperate to curb one's
[14:29] desires and impulses
[14:31] she's to be chased which in the greek
[14:33] means
[14:34] free from carnality
[14:36] modest
[14:37] and reverent
[14:39] and she's to keep the home which means
[14:41] care for the house work at the home take
[14:43] care of household affairs
[14:45] and of course obedient to her husband
[14:48] that the word of god be not blasphemed
[14:50] or in other words that she doesn't bring
[14:52] reproach upon the word of god and the
[14:54] lord jesus christ because the spirit of
[14:56] jesus christ teaches a godly woman to
[14:59] love her husband obey her husband and
[15:00] love her children
[15:02] in this next quote from questions and
[15:04] answers part 1 1964 brother ram tells a
[15:07] believing wife
[15:08] that her life will sanctify her husband
[15:11] who doesn't believe the message brother
[15:13] branham encourages her to go with her
[15:15] husband to his denominational church but
[15:17] don't partake in any sinful things that
[15:19] that church would partake in
[15:21] and then brother brahm told her the way
[15:23] she'd win her husband was by being real
[15:25] salty and he quotes the scripture the
[15:27] sanctified wife sanctifies the husband
[15:31] let's listen to the quote
[15:33] brother branham
[15:34] i have ex
[15:36] accepted god's message of today and also
[15:40] our son and we both have been baptized
[15:44] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[15:47] my husband
[15:49] my husband hasn't accepted
[15:52] the message
[15:53] and is fighting this message and he has
[15:57] influenced our son
[15:59] and is taking him to a methodist church
[16:03] he wants me to go
[16:04] with him to church
[16:07] when we are not in
[16:09] service here at the tabernacle would it
[16:12] be right for me to go with him or would
[16:16] it be better to stay out of that
[16:19] denomination
[16:21] well now dear sister you should ever
[16:23] sign no name but perhaps you're
[16:25] listening to your question don't you
[16:26] hear it on tape go with your husband
[16:29] but don't be partakers
[16:32] of what they're doing
[16:33] see you're supposed to love your husband
[16:35] and love is what doesn't you just be
[16:38] real salty he'll get thirsty
[16:44] don't join their denomination he said
[16:46] stay away from that denomination don't
[16:48] join it
[16:49] go to it if you can't get a whole loaf
[16:51] get a half can't get a life let's get a
[16:53] slice see
[16:55] but uh that's where you'll win your
[16:56] husband by doing that don't be irritant
[16:59] then he'll know he's got this as much as
[17:01] you have see but when you show something
[17:04] that you have that he don't have
[17:06] that'll make him thirst to be like you
[17:08] the sanctified wife sanctifies the
[17:11] husband that was just an advice so i i
[17:13] could spend a long time on that but
[17:17] fourth the faithful holy ghost-filled
[17:19] wife has to lead by a quiet example
[17:22] without using aggressive words meaning
[17:25] she lives a godly life without ruling
[17:27] over a husband according to first peter
[17:29] 3 verses 1-7
[17:31] likewise your wives be in subjection to
[17:33] your own husbands that if any obey not
[17:36] the word they also may without the word
[17:38] be won by the conversation of the wives
[17:41] while they behold your chaste
[17:42] conversation coupled with fear
[17:46] notice peter said the wife wins the
[17:47] husband without the word so her actions
[17:50] are to speak louder than her words
[17:53] notice she's not to preach at her
[17:55] husband with aggressive words but she's
[17:58] to let her life speak she's let her
[18:00] testimony speak and that testimony will
[18:02] speak louder than any word she could say
[18:06] and verses three and four says her
[18:07] adorning should be that hidden man of
[18:09] the heart a meek and quiet spirit which
[18:12] is in the sight of god a great price
[18:15] and then peter in verses 5 and 6
[18:18] says this is how the holy women also in
[18:20] the old testament who trusted in god
[18:22] adorned themselves they were in
[18:23] subjection unto their own husbands
[18:26] notice peter also said the saved wife
[18:29] must be in subjection to the husband and
[18:31] paul said the same paul said the wives
[18:33] to be in subjection in everything in
[18:36] ephesians 5 verse 24
[18:40] and of course that means she's only in
[18:42] subjection as he gives her requests that
[18:44] obey the bible
[18:45] a godly woman is not required to disobey
[18:48] the scripture or disobey jesus christ
[18:50] because she loves jesus christ more than
[18:52] anything else
[18:53] as we saw earlier in matthew chapter 10.
[18:56] but getting back to peter notice first
[18:58] peter 3 verse 7 for the husbands it says
[19:00] likewise you husbands dwell with them
[19:02] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[19:04] the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[19:07] and as being heirs together of the grace
[19:09] of life that your prayers be not
[19:11] hindered
[19:13] so christian husbands with wives that
[19:14] don't believe they should still give
[19:16] honor to their wife trusting that
[19:18] hopefully one day she will be saved and
[19:20] then they'll have rewards together as
[19:22] the bible says heirs together of the
[19:24] grace of life
[19:26] and then that man can expect god to
[19:28] answer his prayers as well because he's
[19:29] treating his wife the right way and
[19:32] husbands remember malachi 2 verses
[19:34] 14-16
[19:36] god told the men of israel to take heed
[19:38] to their spirits that they don't deal
[19:40] treacherously with their wives
[19:42] because god was a witness between the
[19:44] husbands and wives
[19:46] god sees how husbands treat their wives
[19:48] and how they either use the authority
[19:50] well that god's given them or they abuse
[19:52] their authority god sees all the
[19:54] interactions in the home
[19:56] and the holy ghost will guide a man to
[19:58] love his wife as christ loved the church
[20:01] lastly the saved or believing spouse
[20:03] must fear god and also do good to his or
[20:06] her unbelieving spouse all the days of
[20:09] his or her life as taught in proverbs 31
[20:12] verse 12 and verses 28 through 30 and
[20:15] ephesians 5 verses 25 and 26
[20:19] proverbs 31 12 says she will do him good
[20:21] and not evil all the days of her life
[20:24] verse 28 says her children arise up and
[20:26] call her blessed her husband also and he
[20:28] praiseth her
[20:30] verse 30 says favor is deceitful and
[20:33] beauty is vain but a woman that feareth
[20:35] the lord she shall be praised
[20:38] and for the husbands ephesians 5 verses
[20:40] 25 and 26 say husbands love your wives
[20:43] even as christ also loved the church and
[20:45] gave himself for it that he might
[20:47] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[20:49] of water by the word
[20:52] two more helpful quotes from brother
[20:54] branham
[20:55] before closing i want to add
[20:57] a couple more quotes from brother
[20:58] branham that i believe will help message
[21:00] believers who might be married to an
[21:02] unbelieving spouse
[21:04] in this first quote from questions and
[21:05] answers part 1 1964
[21:08] brother ram talks about a man
[21:10] who's a believer but his wife has
[21:12] divorced him and is suing him
[21:14] this would be an incredibly sad
[21:16] situation but brother ram tells him
[21:18] commit the situation to god and
[21:20] recognize that satan's only trying to
[21:22] tear him up satan wanted to break his
[21:24] health down brother ram told him to be
[21:27] just as happy as he could be and pray to
[21:29] god and say god i love her and commit
[21:32] the whole thing to you lord i want them
[21:35] saved but i can't go no further then
[21:37] commit it to the lord and just let it
[21:39] alone and god will take care of the rest
[21:41] of it
[21:42] lets us into the quote
[21:44] dear brother branham my wife and i were
[21:51] separated she is suing me for a divorce
[21:55] she is not a christian and i believe the
[21:58] message and want her to be saved that
[22:02] nice
[22:02] that's real christian spirit
[22:04] and believe what must i do
[22:08] we also have two boys
[22:11] sign their name
[22:13] brother
[22:17] look let me tell you she's going to sue
[22:19] you for a divorce
[22:21] that's satan
[22:23] you shouldn't do that
[22:24] but if you're a christian and done
[22:26] nothing in the world to enter that woman
[22:28] then it's satan doing that he's only
[22:30] trying to tear you up
[22:32] now if she is one of god's elected she
[22:36] will come to him
[22:38] if she's not she's not worth worrying
[22:40] about
[22:41] then if it does if you worry it'll break
[22:44] your health down and that's what satan
[22:46] wants to do he's working i know at you
[22:49] so you just commit the whole thing to
[22:51] god and go right on serving god just as
[22:53] happy as you can be
[22:55] god will take care of the rest of all
[22:57] that the father has given me
[22:59] will come to me get down on your knees
[23:02] i'll pray with you or anything i'll pray
[23:03] over the matter just say lord god
[23:07] i love her she's a mother of my children
[23:08] if she is and say i i just commit the
[23:11] whole thing to you lord i want to save
[23:13] you know i do but i can't go no further
[23:15] she's going to divorce me anyhow i
[23:17] haven't done nothing if i have revealed
[23:18] it to me i'll go make it right i'll do
[23:20] anything then commit it to the lord and
[23:22] just let it alone then just let it alone
[23:24] for i don't live in the same as as
[23:26] nothing ever happened god will take care
[23:28] of the rest of it
[23:31] in the next quote again from questions
[23:33] and answers part 1 1964
[23:35] there was a married man who believed the
[23:37] message but his wife and son did not
[23:38] rejoice in the word the man was
[23:40] struggling to claim his family and asked
[23:43] brother brandon what is my course sir
[23:45] brother ram said commit them to the lord
[23:47] and know that all that the father has
[23:49] given
[23:50] me will come to me speaking of jesus
[23:52] brother branham said just show by the
[23:54] sweetness of your life and your
[23:56] consideration for others that you have
[23:58] the real genuine love of jesus christ
[24:00] and he said if you don't have it pray
[24:03] until it comes to you because it had to
[24:05] be real he says pray to the place till
[24:08] your life is full of salt of the savior
[24:10] lifting up jesus christ then he said if
[24:13] you do go to the denominations be
[24:14] careful don't don't join their church
[24:17] let's listen to the quote
[24:19] brother branham i believe the message
[24:22] you teach with all my heart it thrills
[24:25] my soul however my wife and son do not
[24:29] rejoice in the word they do not desire
[24:32] to separate themselves
[24:35] from some other worldly habits
[24:37] you said that we
[24:39] should claim our
[24:42] claim our families
[24:44] i find that difficult
[24:46] to do seeming that they do not live for
[24:49] the word or in the word
[24:52] what is my course sir
[24:55] do i claim them
[24:57] and believe or do i pray
[25:00] father thy will be done and be content
[25:04] in the state i find myself in i would
[25:08] appreciate your guidance brother branham
[25:11] god bless you my brother or sister
[25:14] whoever you may be
[25:16] i
[25:17] i would just commit them to the lord
[25:20] i see because what all the father has
[25:24] given me will come to me amen now the
[25:27] only thing for you people to do now
[25:30] i'm mother
[25:31] when my sister if your husband wants you
[25:34] going out to methodist church you go
[25:36] ahead you might not have a whole loaf of
[25:38] bread but if they even say they believe
[25:40] that jesus christ is the son of god you
[25:42] believe that because we do too now to go
[25:45] off on other tantrums and things just
[25:47] let them go ahead but you eat that much
[25:48] of the bread see and in that you just
[25:51] show by the sweetness of your life your
[25:53] consideration for others if you haven't
[25:55] got it sister dear pray till it comes to
[25:58] you that you won't have to put on
[25:59] anything artificially because when you
[26:01] do that it's not real your husband can
[26:03] tell that
[26:04] but you when you really have prayed to a
[26:06] place that your life is full of salt of
[26:08] the savior he'll make the contact
[26:12] if i be lifted up i'll draw all man
[26:15] i'd go
[26:16] be real careful don't join the churchill
[26:18] please don't do that don't you join the
[26:20] church but go on
[26:24] in closing
[26:26] i hope this short video has been a
[26:28] blessing friends
[26:29] i felt burdened on my heart to work on
[26:31] this video and get it out as soon as i
[26:32] could so please share it with anyone you
[26:35] know who is a christian but they're
[26:36] married to a person who's not a believer
[26:39] and please pray for them friends the
[26:41] most powerful weapon god has ever given
[26:43] us was prayer
[26:45] the scripture says the effectual fervent
[26:47] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[26:50] and remember friends there's no greater
[26:52] miracle than seeing a soul saved
[26:54] so if you're a christian you have a
[26:56] spouse that's not saved keep them in
[26:58] prayer
[26:58] keep living a sanctified life before
[27:00] them and hope and trust that by the
[27:02] grace of god your unsafe spouse will
[27:05] become a believer by the grace of god on
[27:08] a personal note i have seen this happen
[27:10] in one family that i've known
[27:12] the wife was a believer and she trained
[27:14] the children up in the ways of the lord
[27:16] and eventually over the course of 10 or
[27:18] 20 years the husband eventually became a
[27:21] christian
[27:22] now the wife and the children were in
[27:23] the message of the hour and the husband
[27:25] never became a message follower but he
[27:27] lived a christian life before he passed
[27:29] away
[27:30] so the family rejoiced that he was saved
[27:32] and also they can look forward to seeing
[27:33] him in heaven someday because all those
[27:35] who call upon the lord with a pure heart
[27:37] will be saved
[27:39] remember friends with god all things are
[27:41] possible
[27:42] if you have any questions concerns or
[27:44] testimonies about this video please
[27:47] contact me
[27:49] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[27:51] the desire of your heart
