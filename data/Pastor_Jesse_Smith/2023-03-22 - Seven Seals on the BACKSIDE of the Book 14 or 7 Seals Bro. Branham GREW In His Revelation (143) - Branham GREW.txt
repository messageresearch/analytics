TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show that God's Prophet brother William Branham grew in his Revelation on his understanding on the Seven Seals especially Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 which says and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals by God's grace we'll see that God's Prophet at one time thought there were seven seals inside the book and also on the outside of the book but then three years later the Holy Spirit corrected him and then brother Branham came to understand that the revelation of the Seven Seals cannot be outside the Bible the revelation of the Seven Seals has to be in the Bible so we'll start by listening to the quotes and then we'll end this short video with a few lessons that we can learn and I hope it'll be a blessing to you by God's grace I'll begin with two quotes the first quote is from June 11 1961 Revelation chapter 5 part one and brother Branham says the revelation of the Seven Seals is sealed on the back side of the book not written Within and then brother Ram says Christ the lamb is the only one that can reveal those seven Mysteries out let's listen to the quote [Music] so this is [Music] [Music] reveal [Music] Ed next a year and a half later in 1962 December 30th is this the sign of the end sir brother Branham speaks a little more about this subject and says there are seven other seals that's on the back side of the book it's outside the Bible so here brother makes it sound like there's Seven Seals in the book and then there's seven seals on the outside of the book let's listen to the quote if there's seven other seals that's on the back side of the boat outside the Bible [Music] this is [Music] not revealed it's not even written in the bill then friends three years later in spiritual food and due season July 1965 while talking about the Seven Seals brother Branham says he always thought there were seals on the backside of the book and it wasn't something written in this heavenly book he says but then it turned out God cannot do that the revelation of the Seven Seals has to be something that's written in this heavenly book and then he quotes revelation 22 verses 18 to 19 that say not one word can be added to the book and therefore the mystery of God is already contained within the Holy Bible the book of redemption let's listen to the quote [Music] [Music] a mystery all about water baptism these other things that the salon so friends we can gain at least four lessons from these quotes the first lesson is that this is proof brother random had the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he could be guided into all truth according to John 16 verse 13. although brother random was wrong about Seven Seals being on the back side of the book the holy ghost did not let him start a 14 seals Dogma or a 14 seals camp that had teachings outside the Holy Bible brand did not start a different gospel he preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ a second lesson is that this proves Jefferson Bill and the Bradham Tabernacle are wrong again of course not every word on tape is thus saith the Lord the two quotes that we heard at the beginning from 1961 and 1962 were not thus saith the Lord there are not Seven Seals on the back side of the book and of course this video supports that three-part series I made called 60 plus proofs not every word on tape was thus say the Lord and now Friends by God's grace I'm almost up to 80 proofs that not every word on the tapes are thus say the Lord so perhaps Lord willing in the future I'll make another video on that if God is willing and Friends those videos strengthen the faith of real Believers like myself and others that realize brother random was human and he's not to be worshiped and the tapes are not to be worshiped either the tapes point us to the absolute the Bible a third lesson is that we must prove all things we must take every quote brother random said back to the word and of course every quote from a preacher that we hear even today and this is what brother Ram taught us in 1963 he cares do you care he said I've always asked you to be careful when you're listening to him he said because there's so much of it that's the Human Side so it's a great lesson that we almost learn we can't get lazy we've got to continually prove all things we've got to go back to the scripture and make sure what we believe is found in the word of God and a fourth and final lesson is that no matter how emotional brother Brenda may sound in a quote it doesn't mean what he's saying is thus saith the Lord like with this example no matter how enthused brother random is how excited he may seem we've still got to take every quote he said back to the word of God a couple examples are like the quotes about 1977 brother brand was very emotional thinking total Annihilation would come before 1977 and of course it didn't that was just a human prediction brother Ram is still a prophet of God another example is brother Branch predictions about Martin Luther King Jr leading Millions into a death trap and causing another race war of course those were just his own opinions as he told us brother Ram said he had nothing on it from the Lord that was just his opinion as followers of God's Prophet we have to look for both Bible evidence and the words of brother Branham saying thus saith the Lord to know that some future prediction or prophecy is from the Lord just as brother Ram taught us and he cares do you care in 1963. so friends we rejoice in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is still here he still seals our souls the Holy Ghost is the dissolver of doubts he's the spirit of truth that's with us today he's the one that leads and guides us today into all truth he helps us rightly divide the word of Truth if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
