[0:03] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ very thankful
[0:09] to announce that my first book restoring
[0:13] Christian modesty God's perfect will for
[0:15] your outward appearance is now available
[0:18] by God's grace I put links in the
[0:21] description below to Amazon for both
[0:24] paperback and Kindle versions paperback
[0:27] is priced at 995 and the kindle version
[0:30] is priced at 695 here's a brief history
[0:35] of how this book came about since 2005
[0:38] I've been making gospel materials to
[0:40] distribute with the help of other
[0:42] brothers beginning with mp3 files on CD
[0:45] then in 2012 I started researching and
[0:47] tinkering with video editing then around
[0:50] March 2014 I published my first Vimeo
[0:52] video about water baptism by scripture
[0:55] alone seven months later I moved to
[0:57] YouTube and devoted most of my free time
[0:59] to script writing filming and editing
[1:01] now in March 2019 five years after
[1:05] joining Vimeo my YouTube page has over
[1:08] seven thousand subscribers and over six
[1:11] hundred thousand views this is a small
[1:13] channel to most but this has been a big
[1:15] encouragement to me
[1:17] now I'd like to begin a chapter by
[1:20] chapter overview of the book we'll do
[1:22] two chapters on this video perhaps three
[1:25] on the next and then two on the next by
[1:27] the grace of the Lord here are the
[1:29] headlines for chapter 1
[1:30] I'll read the entire list but then I'll
[1:32] choose a few of the most beneficial
[1:34] lessons from this chapter that I'd like
[1:36] to share with you the Word of God is our
[1:39] foundation the rightly divided word of
[1:42] truth the predicted falling away
[1:45] what is holiness God requires holiness
[1:50] how we become holy holiness is beautiful
[1:55] love is the greatest motivator legalism
[2:00] modesty the beginning and ending a
[2:03] modest clothing today is like the days
[2:06] of Noah the root of in modesty outward
[2:11] nakedness signal spiritual nakedness
[2:13] the dangers of immodesty my experience
[2:17] with in modesty first I think what is
[2:22] holiness will be important we have to
[2:24] understand that holiness is consecration
[2:26] purification and sanctification of heart
[2:29] and life in fact God calls us to perfect
[2:32] holiness in reverential fear or respect
[2:35] to Almighty God it's also crucial to
[2:40] know that Scripture literally States our
[2:42] purpose is that we should be holy and
[2:44] without blame before him the headline
[2:48] love is the greatest motivator is
[2:50] extremely important because it shows the
[2:52] order that we must obey God
[2:54] we start with love for God which
[2:57] produces faith and then faith produces
[3:00] works Jesus Christ plainly taught that
[3:03] love is the greatest motivation for
[3:05] obedience it was Jesus's love for the
[3:09] father that allowed him to keep all the
[3:11] commandments of God the legalism section
[3:14] is very important you'll benefit from
[3:16] understanding that legalism is something
[3:19] that's added to the Word of God so Jesus
[3:21] fulfilled every word of God that did not
[3:24] make him a legalist it made him a
[3:25] loyalist the same applies to you and I
[3:28] if we keep all the Word of God that
[3:30] doesn't mean we're legalists it means
[3:32] we're loyal to obedience to every word
[3:35] of God the modesty headline defines
[3:38] modesty by the Bible because it's a
[3:41] Bible command the beginning and ending
[3:44] of modest clothing is an important
[3:46] section because God initiated modest
[3:48] clothing in Genesis 3 verse 21 and it
[3:52] has remained unchanged through the
[3:53] entire Bible the last mention of modest
[3:56] clothing is in Revelation 7 where we see
[3:58] Jesus and all the Holy Ghost filled
[4:00] Christians dressed in modest robes that
[4:02] go down to their feet we'll spend all
[4:04] eternity in modest clothes the root of a
[4:07] modesty is the influence of demons or
[4:10] evil spirits evil spirits cause people
[4:14] to take off their clothes and display
[4:15] their flesh in an immodest public way
[4:18] the book will also teach that if someone
[4:21] displays their nakedness in public it
[4:24] shows they have a spiritual nakedness as
[4:26] well this
[4:27] means the person does not possess the
[4:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's two
[4:32] dangers of in modesty one is causing
[4:34] people to stumble into sin which also
[4:36] means we're sinning against Christ the
[4:40] other is someone becomes captive to the
[4:42] will of evil spirits or they're addicted
[4:44] to demonic powers the last headline is
[4:48] about my experience with immodesty in
[4:50] second grade I was exposed to in
[4:52] modestly dressed women on MTV and has
[4:55] started an addiction to lust that lasted
[4:57] up into my college years but God by the
[5:00] power of the Holy Ghost through the
[5:01] blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me
[5:03] completely from that and I've never gone
[5:05] back chapter two headlines include
[5:09] rightly dividing Old Testament scripture
[5:13] nine categories for placing Old
[5:15] Testament scripture the New Testament
[5:18] Sabbath two or three Bible witnesses we
[5:24] are not under the law blanket statements
[5:29] abominations and magnifying the law to
[5:32] fulfill the law in Chapter two I show
[5:36] nine categories that Old Testament
[5:39] scripture can be rightly divided into
[5:41] this is extremely helpful for everyone
[5:43] to understand that Old Testament
[5:45] scripture can be used to guide our lives
[5:48] in the New Testament there's an
[5:49] important chart in Chapter two this
[5:51] shows all Ten Commandments are still in
[5:53] effect in the New Testament the two or
[5:56] three witnesses section is important
[5:57] because it shows God will give two or
[5:59] three scriptural witnesses for the
[6:01] principles or commands that remain in
[6:03] effect for New Testament believers we
[6:07] are not under the law shows that we are
[6:08] not under the curse of the law but
[6:10] rather were saved by grace but grace
[6:13] does put us under the law of the Holy
[6:15] Spirit according to the Bible the law of
[6:17] the Holy Spirit will never guide us into
[6:19] sin but rather into obedience and the
[6:22] fulfillment of God's righteous Word the
[6:25] abomination section is crucial
[6:27] most of the Old Testament abominations
[6:30] remain abominable in the New Testament
[6:31] and there's a very detailed list of
[6:34] these such as homosexuality idolatry
[6:37] murder witchcraft and other abominations
[6:41] in closing thank you for your support
[6:44] with this book I trust it'll be a
[6:46] blessing to your heart I trust it will
[6:48] teach you a lot more about the Lord and
[6:51] then be a witnessing tool you can use to
[6:53] share with others that Christ might be
[6:56] glorified please contact me with any
[6:58] questions or concerns god bless you and
[7:01] may Jesus Christ be the desire of your
[7:03] heart
