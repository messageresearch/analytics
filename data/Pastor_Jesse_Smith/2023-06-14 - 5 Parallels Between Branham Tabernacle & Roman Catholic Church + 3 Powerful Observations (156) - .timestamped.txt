[0:00] in all godliness and sincerity has
[0:03] anyone else noticed the similarities
[0:05] between the Roman Catholic church and
[0:07] Branham Tabernacle
[0:09] one of the Saints shared this with me
[0:11] and I agree with five of these parallels
[0:14] and also three other observations
[0:18] the first parallel is the Vatican
[0:22] is the adored headquarters of the Roman
[0:24] Catholic Church
[0:25] and this is the easiest parallel to see
[0:27] perhaps because Jeffersonville is the
[0:29] adored headquarters of Branham
[0:31] Tabernacle
[0:35] the second parallel is with the leader
[0:37] of the church
[0:39] the leader of the Roman Catholic Church
[0:40] is the pope he's the current living
[0:42] representative of Christ supposedly of
[0:45] course we know he's not and the Pope's
[0:47] every word is to be believed and
[0:49] followed
[0:51] the parallel to the Pope in the Branham
[0:54] Tabernacle is their pastor
[0:56] and he's the current living
[0:58] representative of brother Branham and
[1:00] they consider their Pastor to be a
[1:02] prophet just like brother Branham and
[1:04] their pastors every word is to be
[1:07] believed and followed
[1:10] the third parallel is with Mary
[1:13] according to Roman Catholic Doctrine
[1:15] Mary is a mediatrix between Jesus and
[1:19] Mankind
[1:20] and as any honest person knows the Roman
[1:23] Catholic Church focuses more on Mary
[1:25] than they really do on Jesus
[1:28] and friends the obvious parallel to this
[1:30] is Brother Branham Branham Tabernacle
[1:33] literally exalts brother Branham to
[1:35] being co-equal with Jesus because they
[1:38] claim every word on brother Brown's
[1:40] tapes is thus saith the Lord
[1:41] Brenham Tabernacle meditates on brother
[1:44] Branham and his voice
[1:45] and so their real focus is on brother
[1:47] Branham and not Jesus
[1:50] some of the Branham Tabernacle members
[1:52] even say brother Braham did more
[1:53] miracles than Jesus which is a
[1:55] misunderstanding of what brother Branham
[1:57] said
[1:58] as we cannot forget John 21 verse 25
[2:02] where John said he supposed even the
[2:04] world itself could not contain the books
[2:06] that should be written about Jesus
[2:10] the fourth parallel is with the Roman
[2:12] Catholic church praying to their Saints
[2:16] and of course brother Rand taught this
[2:17] was spiritualism trying to contact dead
[2:20] people
[2:22] the parallel with Branham Tabernacle is
[2:24] that Brenham Tabernacle invites brother
[2:26] Branham to preach in their services they
[2:29] act like he's alive
[2:30] and they also let brother branham's
[2:32] tapes officiate weddings again acting
[2:35] like brother Branham is literally there
[2:36] officiating weddings
[2:39] so we see the parallel of spiritualism
[2:41] in both churches
[2:44] the fifth parallel is the message of
[2:46] unity
[2:47] the Roman Catholic Church tries to unify
[2:49] everyone around themselves citing the
[2:52] prayer of Jesus in John 17 verses 21-23
[2:56] that they all may be one even as We Are
[2:59] One
[3:01] Branham Tabernacle does the same thing
[3:03] they try to unite all the message
[3:05] Believers around themselves
[3:07] on Branham tabernacle's blog post they
[3:10] frequently say that the only thing we
[3:12] can unite on as message Believers is
[3:15] believing that brother Brandon was God's
[3:17] voice but what they're really saying is
[3:19] that everyone must follow the tape
[3:22] worship of Branham Tabernacle and how
[3:24] they say just push play
[3:26] put brother randoms tapes before the
[3:28] fivefold ministry
[3:31] three other powerful observations are
[3:34] first
[3:35] at least the Catholics only claim the
[3:37] Pope's words are thus saith the Lord
[3:39] when he speaks from Saint Peter's
[3:40] Basilica but Jeffersonville says the
[3:43] tapes are word for word
[3:45] thus saith the Lord the word of God
[3:48] this proves Jeffersonville worships
[3:50] brother Branham more than the Catholics
[3:52] worship the Pope
[3:53] it's hypocrisy to point at Catholicism
[3:55] and its dangers while ignoring the
[3:58] idolatry in Jeffersonville
[4:01] a second powerful observation is that
[4:03] both Catholics and Branham Tabernacle
[4:05] use the word essence to teach their
[4:07] false doctrines
[4:09] first Catholics say each of the three
[4:11] persons of the Trinity has the same
[4:12] Essence well that's a lie because three
[4:15] persons is not in the Bible
[4:17] but Branham Tabernacle also uses the
[4:19] word essence and says the tapes and the
[4:21] Bible are the same Essence which we know
[4:24] is not true because the tapes have
[4:25] mistakes as brother M said and brother
[4:27] Ram said the Bible has no mistakes
[4:30] the third and final observation is that
[4:33] both groups are man-made denominations
[4:36] past Catholic councils have said that no
[4:38] one can be saved outside of the Roman
[4:40] Catholic church and Pope Boniface the
[4:43] eighth said anyone who doesn't submit to
[4:45] the Pope's Authority is not saved
[4:49] random Tabernacle says something very
[4:51] similar they say anyone that is outside
[4:53] of their press play and Obey movement is
[4:56] a make-believer and an unbeliever and a
[5:00] Demus
[5:01] dear friends let's pray
[5:04] for the deceived people in the tape
[5:05] Church movement to repent and come to
[5:07] Christ
