[0:03] There's three stages of their journey.
[0:05] They left Egypt under justification
[0:08] believing the word.
[0:10] They separate themselves from the
[0:12] Egyptians and come out. They cross the
[0:15] Red Sea and kill the things behind them
[0:17] which was sanctification
[0:20] &gt;&gt; through the blood that kills all human
[0:22] desires and evil. But the third stage
[0:27] was when they cross Jordan. into the
[0:30] promised land where their inheritance
[0:33] laid.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:39] this video is to show eight Old
[0:41] Testament types of the three works of
[0:44] grace and specifically we'll look at the
[0:46] lives of seven individuals from the Old
[0:48] Testament and we'll look at Israel as an
[0:51] eighth example. God's prophet, brother
[0:54] William Miriam Brandom spent a lot of
[0:55] time with this thought in 1961. There's
[0:58] over 30 quotes where brother Brandham
[1:00] placed justification, sanctification,
[1:02] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:04] life of Abraham. So, let's make a few
[1:07] points here by the grace of God as we
[1:09] get started. The first point is that the
[1:11] three works of grace is a very biblical
[1:14] teaching. It's part of the mystery of
[1:17] Christ in you, the hope of glory. God's
[1:19] presence grows into your life, into your
[1:21] soul in three steps. Justification,
[1:24] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[1:25] Holy Ghost. Notice it is grace that does
[1:28] the work. This is an important point
[1:30] because accusers of brother Brandham and
[1:32] those who reject the three works of
[1:33] grace are not listening or they're not
[1:35] paying attention or they're not really
[1:37] understanding what we're saying. It is
[1:39] God's grace, God's favor, God's
[1:42] unmmerited favor that works in our life
[1:44] to bring more of his spirit and presence
[1:47] into our lives until our soul is
[1:49] completely baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:51] 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of this. Paul
[1:54] says, "It wasn't I that worked, but it
[1:56] was the grace of God which was with me."
[1:58] Paul said, "He labored more than all the
[2:00] apostles." He said, "Not I, but the
[2:01] grace of God that was with me." So grace
[2:04] causes people to labor. Philippians 2:13
[2:07] says the same where Paul said, "It's God
[2:09] who works in you mightily." So the three
[2:12] works of grace are God's working. We're
[2:15] just yielding. The Bible says in Romans
[2:17] chapter 6, I believe we just yield to
[2:19] the Holy Spirit. We must yield our
[2:21] members. God is doing the work.
[2:24] St. Paul also showed the three works of
[2:26] grace in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.
[2:29] He gave numerous sins that cause people
[2:32] to not inherit the kingdom of God, such
[2:34] as fornication, homosexuality, adultery,
[2:37] and others. But Paul said, "You're
[2:39] washed. You're justified. You're
[2:40] sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:43] Christ and by the spirit of our God." So
[2:46] the truth is hiding in that scripture.
[2:49] justified, sanctified, and then baptized
[2:51] with the spirit of God. And it is the
[2:53] spirit of God doing each step. The
[2:55] spirit of God justifies you. The spirit
[2:57] of God sanctifies you, and the spirit of
[2:59] God baptizes your soul with the Holy
[3:01] Ghost. Even as Jesus said in Acts 1
[3:03] verse 5, he said, "Wait in Jerusalem
[3:05] until you're endued with power from on
[3:07] high and receive the baptism of the Holy
[3:10] Ghost."
[3:12] Jesus also taught a parable of the
[3:14] kingdom of God coming into the believer
[3:15] in three steps in Mark 4 26- 29. It's
[3:20] the three stages of the wheat plant
[3:21] which brother Ram considered his
[3:23] masterpiece as we recently showed a
[3:25] video about that by God's grace. Notice
[3:28] the kingdom comes in three stages and
[3:30] man doesn't understand how. We don't
[3:31] understand how God does it but God
[3:33] justifies us. God sanctifies us. Then
[3:35] God fills us with the Holy Ghost. We
[3:38] just yield to him. We just love him. We
[3:40] just worship him. and we just repent of
[3:41] our sins and God does it. We don't know
[3:43] how God does it by his grace. And then
[3:47] Jesus said in Luke 17:21, "The kingdom
[3:49] of God is within you." So the kingdom
[3:51] has three stages, three works of grace.
[3:54] The kingdom of God is within you. And
[3:55] then Paul said, "We have received this
[3:57] kingdom which cannot be moved in Hebrews
[3:59] 12:28."
[4:02] So it's undeniable the Bible teaches the
[4:04] three works of grace in the New
[4:05] Testament. Here's a chart I have in my
[4:08] 2021 book. It's on page 301.
[4:12] It shows the three processes of eight
[4:16] different processes.
[4:18] Three steps to natural birth, three
[4:20] steps to your spiritual birth, Israel's
[4:22] exodus,
[4:23] the tabernacle's cleansing had three
[4:25] courts to cleanse, the earth's
[4:27] cleansing,
[4:29] Ezekiel prophesied of the three works of
[4:31] grace in Ezekiel 36:26, and 27. Jesus'
[4:34] parable, the wheat plant, and Jesus said
[4:37] he's the way, the truth, and the life.
[4:38] Notice three stages, three steps.
[4:43] The second point is that this relates to
[4:44] the recent video on the spirit of
[4:46] burning. Remember, Old Testament saints
[4:48] could never get the third work of grace,
[4:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their
[4:52] soul. So, as that video on the spirit of
[4:55] burning showed, Old Testament believers
[4:57] could experience two works,
[4:58] justification and sanctification. John
[5:00] 7:37-39 says, "The Holy Ghost could not
[5:03] be given until Jesus was glorified. But
[5:05] yet, we saw Bezale was filled with the
[5:07] spirit of God. That's that can only mean
[5:08] in his human spirit, not in his soul.
[5:11] And remember, in this video, we're
[5:12] showing the three works of grace
[5:15] foreshadowed in the lives of Old
[5:17] Testament saints. That third work is
[5:19] just a foreshadowing. That third work is
[5:21] not the filling of the soul for the Old
[5:23] Testament saints with the seven examples
[5:25] we'll look at here in a moment. Third
[5:28] point I want to make is that you can
[5:29] find lots of other videos I have about
[5:31] this topic. The video on people saved
[5:34] but not born again. I have a short
[5:37] series on the three works of grace. The
[5:40] 12 terms for the baptism of the Holy
[5:41] Ghost is helpful as well. And then the
[5:43] entire audio book for chapter 6 of my
[5:46] 2021 book would be helpful as well. And
[5:49] the final point is that accusers of
[5:52] brother Brandham despise this teaching
[5:53] in particular because it shows they're
[5:55] not sanctified and they don't have the
[5:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We don't know
[5:59] how these accusers can believe they're
[6:00] filled with the Holy Ghost at
[6:02] justification when their habits haven't
[6:03] even been cleaned out. My question has
[6:06] always been, how can these people who
[6:08] freshly get saved or get saved for the
[6:11] first time, how can they be filled with
[6:12] the spirit of God and yet disagree on so
[6:15] many things the spirit of God teaches in
[6:18] his holy word? Like women preachers,
[6:20] like women cutting their hair, like
[6:22] women wearing pants, like men being
[6:24] married two or three or four times. And
[6:26] like brother Ram said, how you going to
[6:27] be part of a kingdom and disagree with
[6:29] the king? And the Lord Jesus Christ is
[6:32] the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[6:34] And the Lord Jesus Christ's will is in
[6:36] the Holy Bible. So how can they be part
[6:38] of a kingdom and disagree with the king?
[6:41] &gt;&gt; How do you get into this kingdom? You're
[6:43] born into it.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; How do you know you keep How would you
[6:46] belong into a kingdom and disagree with
[6:48] the king?
[6:50] &gt;&gt; You be and the king is the word. In the
[6:53] beginning was the word and the word is
[6:54] with God and the word was God and the
[6:55] word is made flesh and dwelt among us.
[6:57] The same yesterday, today and forever.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Remember friends, brother Ram said the
[7:01] three works of grace was his message. He
[7:03] said it in the rising of the sun 1965
[7:07] Easter morning or resurrection morning
[7:08] by the grace of God. So we know this is
[7:11] a very important topic to God's prophet
[7:13] brother Brandham and it is for the bride
[7:15] of Jesus Christ as well. Let's listen to
[7:17] the quote.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; She dreamed a dream that I was standing
[7:20] here by the side of a three step and I
[7:24] was standing preaching to everybody that
[7:26] they must walk up these three steps
[7:28] before they hit the highway. And on the
[7:31] highways, a little pearly like white
[7:34] line runs right into the the the doors
[7:37] of heaven to the pearly gates. And that
[7:39] pearl had been stretched out to the top
[7:41] of these steps. If that ain't my message
[7:43] exactly today, justification,
[7:45] sanctification, baptism, and I would
[7:47] think that a person has to come by these
[7:50] three steps to be able to walk that
[7:52] highway.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; So the first example we use is Israel as
[7:56] a nation. Brother Ram taught in As I Was
[7:59] with Moses that Israel's exodus out of
[8:02] Egypt was in three stages. First, the
[8:04] Exodus parting through the Red Sea,
[8:06] which also typed water baptism. The
[8:08] journey in the wilderness was the second
[8:10] stage, and the third stage was Joshua
[8:11] taking Israel into Canaan when they're
[8:14] crossing Jordan. So, the first work is
[8:17] Exodus 14, crossing the Red Sea. The
[8:20] second work is the wilderness. So
[8:21] everything from Exodus 15 all the way to
[8:24] Joshua 3:5 where Joshua said, "Sanctify
[8:27] yourself cuz tomorrow we're going over
[8:29] over Jordan." It's also helpful to see
[8:32] Deuteronomy 8:2.
[8:34] God had Moses tell the people he took
[8:36] them in the wilderness to humble them
[8:38] and to test them and to try them. And
[8:40] that's exactly what sanctification is
[8:42] all about. causing us to be humble,
[8:45] giving us a new spirit, new way of
[8:46] thinking, testing us and showing us
[8:49] what's in our hearts so that we can
[8:50] repent of it in order to be filled with
[8:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[8:54] crossing Jordan into Canaan was also in
[8:56] Joshua chapter 3 at the end of the
[8:58] chapter by God's grace. So let's listen
[9:00] to the quote from as I was with Moses.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Justification they left Egypt. There's
[9:06] three stages of their journey. They left
[9:09] Egypt under justification believing the
[9:12] word. They separated themselves from the
[9:15] Egyptians and come out.
[9:18] They cross the Red Sea and kill the
[9:20] things behind them which was
[9:21] sanctification
[9:23] &gt;&gt; through the blood that kills all human
[9:26] desires of evil.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Second stage of the journey. But the
[9:31] third stage was when they crossed Jordan
[9:36] into the promised land
[9:39] &gt;&gt; where their inheritance laid
[9:43] &gt;&gt; their inheritance severe in Egypt. So
[9:45] God blessed them in Egypt.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Second example is the first individual.
[9:50] Look at the life of Abraham. Brother Ram
[9:52] taught he went through the three works
[9:54] of grace in type in numerous messages. I
[9:56] think it's most clear in Abraham's grace
[9:59] covenant from Middletown March 17th
[10:01] 1961. So the first work of grace is
[10:04] Abraham responding to God's call in
[10:06] Genesis 12. You can see he left of
[10:09] Chaldis. So that shows he had a change
[10:11] of heart. He had repentance. He left his
[10:15] place of origin to obey the word of God.
[10:17] The second work is the purification all
[10:19] the way from Genesis 12 to Genesis 16 or
[10:22] the beginning of Genesis 17. We'd say
[10:25] brother Ram highlights though Genesis 15
[10:27] because there's a blood sacrifice. God
[10:28] renews the covenant with Abraham. And so
[10:31] that kind of goes with the scripture
[10:32] about water, blood, spirit from the book
[10:35] of first John. But since we know
[10:38] sanctification is an entire process, I
[10:40] would take Genesis 12:6 all the way to
[10:42] the beginning of Genesis 17 as Abraham's
[10:44] sanctification.
[10:46] And then the third work of grace would
[10:48] be Abraham circumcised because it's
[10:50] called a token. The circumcision in his
[10:53] flesh was called a token in Genesis
[10:54] 17:9-14.
[10:56] Also, we see that there's a spiritual
[10:58] principle to this in Romans 2:29 about
[11:00] the circumcision of the heart. So, let's
[11:03] listen to these two quotes. We'll listen
[11:04] to Abraham's grace covenant where he
[11:06] talks about three works of grace and
[11:08] then we'll talk about how Abraham's
[11:10] circumcision in his flesh was a
[11:12] foreshadowing of the token in our souls,
[11:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the seal
[11:17] of the Holy Ghost according to Ephesians
[11:18] 4:30. Let's listen to the quotes.
[11:21] Justification
[11:23] Abraham
[11:25] justification Genesis 12
[11:29] Martin Luther to the seed of Abraham
[11:33] sanctification Genesis 15 confirmation
[11:36] of the covenant
[11:38] his seed of Abraham John Wesley
[11:42] sanctification
[11:45] Abraham had an outlet to draw from his
[11:49] weak condition
[11:52] strength. God's own strength.
[11:58] Do you see it?
[12:00] &gt;&gt; How many sees say amen?
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; God's own strength nursed through a
[12:05] promise.
[12:07] [Music]
[12:08] &gt;&gt; He give it to the Pentecostals.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost drawing God's own life
[12:14] right out into them as he did it
[12:16] naturally there. as a spirit shall hear.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; See, to Abraham and his seed after him.
[12:27] You get what I mean? Now, now remember,
[12:29] the church is still advancing.
[12:33] Long come Pentecost with the baptism of
[12:35] the Holy Ghost. Exactly right. But now
[12:38] we want to stop the Pentecostal church
[12:40] just a minute. Each of those organized
[12:42] and died in their tracks.
[12:46] Now I want you to look use the scripture
[12:49] the fourth and fifth verse
[12:52] after he had called him justification
[12:57] sanctified him through the blood of the
[12:59] covenant give him his own life in 17th
[13:02] chapter the baptism of the holy ghost.
[13:04] Now, what comes next in Israel?
[13:08] Some of you Bible scholars, the placing
[13:10] of a son.
[13:14] And God had Abraham circumcised and
[13:17] confirmation obviously. And what was it?
[13:20] What is the Holy Ghost? Somebody tell me
[13:22] what the Holy Ghost is for. It's a sign.
[13:27] Is that right? What was circumcision?
[13:30] A sign.
[13:33] Is that right?
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; A sign. God give a sign that he had
[13:38] accepted Abraham for circumcision. And
[13:41] when you say, "I believe God. I believe
[13:44] Jesus Christ." Then God gives you the
[13:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost as a sign that
[13:48] he's accepted your faith.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; And then you're sealed in the kingdom of
[13:55] God. Not till the next revival, but
[13:58] until the day of your redemption.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not the Holy
[14:04] Spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[14:05] until the day of your redemption.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; The third example is the life of Jacob.
[14:14] I don't have specific quotes from
[14:15] brother Ara where he says that Jacob
[14:17] went through the three works of grace.
[14:19] I'm using Abraham as my foundation and
[14:22] then I'm looking by the help of the Holy
[14:24] Spirit to rightly divide the word of God
[14:26] and see these three steps or three
[14:28] experiences in other believers lives in
[14:30] the Old Testament. But I do have a quote
[14:32] from 1958 where brother Ram said when
[14:35] Jacob wrestled the angel that was like
[14:37] how we received the baptism of the Holy
[14:39] Ghost. So I'm starting with that. I
[14:41] started with that as that was Jacob's
[14:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost experience in
[14:45] type. Of course he didn't receive it in
[14:47] the soul. So then with the liberty I
[14:49] have as a minister of the gospel trying
[14:51] to rightly divide the word of truth. The
[14:53] first work of grace I see in Jacob's
[14:55] life is when he sees the Lord, he
[14:56] receives the covenant, makes a vow in
[14:59] Genesis 28:es 10- 22. It's a story of
[15:03] Jacob's latter. The second work of grace
[15:06] would likely be his dream from God
[15:08] telling him return to Canaan in Genesis
[15:11] 31:10-13.
[15:13] And also you see that continuation of
[15:15] sanctification until he humbles himself
[15:17] and prays for victory over fear of Esau
[15:20] in Genesis 32:9-23.
[15:24] I love that prayer. Jacob says, "I'm not
[15:26] worthy of the least of your mercy." So
[15:28] here he gets so humble he realizes he's
[15:30] nothing. So he's getting totally
[15:32] sanctified. And then we'd say the third
[15:34] work of grace is Jacob wrestling with
[15:35] the angel given a new walk. The limping
[15:37] prince we'd say. And the Bible said
[15:39] anyone that's in Christ is a new
[15:41] creature. Genesis 32:24-32.
[15:44] Let's listen to the quote.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; And of Jacob on his way with his wife
[15:50] and his children, he heard a message
[15:53] coming that Esau with a great army was
[15:56] coming to meet him. And he began to
[15:58] think on his ways
[16:01] of way he had done. Esau cheated him and
[16:04] it drove him to prayer all night long.
[16:08] He wrestled with the angel of the Lord.
[16:12] I trust tonight that man and women, boys
[16:15] and girls, who's neglected the baptism
[16:17] of the Holy Ghost, you don't know how
[16:20] near you are to home.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; I trust that you'll put purpose in your
[16:26] heart that you'll wrestle with the angel
[16:28] of the Lord and not let him go until
[16:31] you're blessed.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Fourth example is Joseph from the book
[16:36] of Genesis. Again, I don't have a quote
[16:38] on this as far as Joseph having three
[16:41] works of grace, but I can see it just
[16:42] like I can see it in Abraham's life and
[16:44] Jacob's life. I wrote about this in my
[16:46] 2021 book on pages 307 308. I believe
[16:50] the first work of grace where we can see
[16:52] Joseph is obeying the Lord is his faith.
[16:55] Joseph's faith trusted God's way for his
[16:57] life as he unashamedly shared his dreams
[16:59] with his family in Genesis 37:es 5-11. I
[17:04] believe Joseph is a special example of
[17:06] how you can see the eight steps in the
[17:08] stature perfect man in Joseph's life.
[17:10] This is on page 307 308 of my book. You
[17:14] can see faith in his life, then virtue,
[17:15] then knowledge, then temperance, then
[17:17] patience, then godliness, then brotherly
[17:19] kindness. So I would say all those steps
[17:21] are sanctification, virtue, all the way
[17:23] down to brotherly kindness. So my choice
[17:25] as Joseph receiving the Holy Ghost in
[17:28] type would be when Joseph lovingly
[17:30] embraced his father Jacob when he came
[17:32] to abide with him in Egypt in Genesis
[17:34] 46:29.
[17:36] This is a father-son embrace that
[17:38] foreshadow Christians uniting with their
[17:40] loving father their father God because
[17:43] God is love according to book of first
[17:44] John. God is love and love is charity.
[17:48] The fifth example is the life of Moses.
[17:50] And again, I don't have a quote from
[17:52] brother Brandham on the three works of
[17:53] grace, but I'm rightly dividing the word
[17:54] of God. I do have a quote where brother
[17:56] Brandham says his burning bush
[17:57] experience was like the baptism of the
[17:59] Holy Ghost. So, I started with the third
[18:01] work. If I know that's the third work,
[18:03] then I got to go find the scripture
[18:04] where he had two other works of grace.
[18:06] So, I'd say the first work was corded in
[18:09] Acts 7:23 about Moses's life in Exodus
[18:13] where it said it came into his heart to
[18:15] visit his brethren at 40 years old. So
[18:17] seems like Moses started feeling God's
[18:20] pull at about 40 years old and he
[18:22] visited his brethren but of course he
[18:24] only had education from Egypt. So he
[18:26] smoked an Egyptian. He had faith to
[18:28] stand up for his people but he didn't
[18:30] have the character. So the first work of
[18:32] grace would be when he went to his
[18:34] brethren and tried to tell them he would
[18:36] be the deliverer but then failed. The
[18:38] second work of grace is the whole time
[18:39] he fled from Egypt and spent all the
[18:41] time in the wilderness of Midian as a
[18:44] shepherd. had a wife and two children,
[18:47] two sons. Then the third work would be
[18:50] the burning bush. He's put into service
[18:52] at 80 years old according to Exodus 7:7.
[18:55] Let's listen to the quote. Oh, that
[18:57] little sacred place that where man can
[19:01] meet God
[19:04] as Moses had on the back side of the
[19:06] desert
[19:08] after 40 years of good schooling,
[19:12] the highest degrees that be could be
[19:15] given,
[19:17] knowing his position as a deliverer and
[19:20] as a Hebrew, and know that God called
[19:24] him for the commission.
[19:26] And yet he knowed more about God in five
[19:30] minutes in the presence of that burning
[19:32] bush than all of his 40 years of
[19:34] theology taught him.
[19:37] He was in the presence of God.
[19:40] And every man that goes to the field to
[19:43] preach the gospel should never leave
[19:46] until he had that back of the desert
[19:48] experience.
[19:51] No one could explain that out of your
[19:53] mind. No matter how much they twist the
[19:56] scriptures and say this, that or the
[19:58] other. If you've ever met God face to
[20:02] face in the true baptism of the Holy
[20:05] Spirit, there's not enough theologians
[20:07] in the world to ever erase it from your
[20:09] memory.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Something happened.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; You were there.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; When a man gets that place, there is no
[20:20] one can explain it away from him.
[20:24] The sixth example is Joshua. Again, I
[20:27] don't have a quote on this. I'm just
[20:28] doing my best here to rightly divide the
[20:29] word of truth. I would say the first
[20:31] work of grace, the first sign we get
[20:33] that he's moved by God into relationship
[20:36] with God is Exodus 33:11. The Bible said
[20:40] Joshua stayed in the tabernacle. And it
[20:41] looks like he stayed in the tabernacle
[20:43] to spend time with God and worship God.
[20:45] So here we see he has a hunger for the
[20:47] Lord. So I could be wrong, but that's my
[20:49] guess on that was his justification. So
[20:52] then all the time after that until
[20:54] Joshua chapter 5 would be his
[20:55] sanctification.
[20:57] We can clearly see a sanctification
[21:00] happening in Joshua 3:5 where he
[21:02] commands all the people to be sanctified
[21:03] before crossing over Jordan. So we can
[21:06] see that's the finalization of his
[21:08] sanctification process. Now the third
[21:10] work of grace is in Joshua 5 and it
[21:13] could be one of two things. It could be
[21:15] the circumcision where Joshua 5:8 says
[21:18] all the males were circumcised aresh. Or
[21:20] if Joshua was already circumcised, then
[21:23] perhaps it was him meeting the captain
[21:25] of the host of the Lord because it's
[21:27] very similar to the burning bush
[21:28] experience Moses had in Joshua 5:14-15.
[21:33] So I would lean toward Joshua meeting
[21:35] the captain of the host as his third
[21:38] work of grace in type because brother
[21:40] Ram said that was Moses's Pentecostal
[21:42] experience. we'd say meeting God at the
[21:44] burning bush. He knew more about God in
[21:46] 5 minutes than all the 40 years in
[21:48] Egypt. The seventh example is Gideon. I
[21:51] preached a series on Gideon, I think
[21:52] around 2014. And again, I don't have
[21:55] quotes from Brother Brandon on this, so
[21:56] I'm just rightly dividing the word of
[21:57] truth. The first work of grace where
[21:59] Gideon seems drawn to God, it seems
[22:01] like, is when an angel comes to him in
[22:04] Judges 6 1- 24. He's called a mighty man
[22:08] of valor. Then he made a and then he
[22:10] made a sacrifice unto God and worshiped
[22:12] God with the angel being present. So now
[22:15] it seems Gideon has a real faith in God.
[22:18] The second work of grace is all the time
[22:20] from then till verse 33. But the main
[22:23] display of his sanctification is him
[22:25] breaking down his father's altars or
[22:27] personal purification or we'd say the
[22:30] purification of his home, his habits in
[22:32] his home. Judges 6:25-32.
[22:35] So Gideon's father had a habit of
[22:37] worshiping these idols. Well, he
[22:38] destroyed all the habits in his house.
[22:40] He cleaned out his house. Seems similar
[22:42] to getting all the leaven out of a
[22:43] house, cleaning it out. So, we can see
[22:45] sanctification going in Gideon's life.
[22:47] And then the third work of grace is very
[22:49] clear. We'd say Judges 6:34, "The spirit
[22:52] of the Lord comes on him and he blows a
[22:54] trumpet for the people gathering unto
[22:56] him to be a part of God's army."
[22:59] Beautiful type.
[23:01] And the eighth and final example is King
[23:03] David from the Old Testament. Again, I'm
[23:06] doing my best here to rightly divide the
[23:07] word of truth. There's certainly three
[23:09] times David was anointed. The first is
[23:11] when he's anointed among his brethren
[23:13] with the promise that would he would be
[23:14] king in 1st Samuel 16:13. And then I
[23:18] would believe that the second work of
[23:20] grace when he was anointed Judah's king
[23:22] only in 2 Samuel 2:4 and he was king
[23:26] over Judah only, only one tribe for
[23:30] about 7 years. And then the third work
[23:32] of grace was when he was anointed king
[23:34] over all Israel in 2 Samuel 5:3 all 12
[23:37] tribes.
[23:39] So when someone receives the baptism of
[23:40] the Holy Ghost, they're put into
[23:42] service, full service by the power of
[23:45] God as we see on the day of Pentecost.
[23:47] So it seems like David being given power
[23:49] over all the tribes of Israel is a
[23:52] foreshadowing of the believer who
[23:54] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:56] and he brings all enemies under his feet
[23:58] and gets into service for the Lord Jesus
[23:59] Christ.
[24:01] In closing, hope this video was a
[24:03] blessing by the grace of God. I was
[24:04] inspired by that quote from Abraham's
[24:07] grace covenant 1961 about Abraham's
[24:10] three works of grace. And then over the
[24:12] years of preaching, pastoring for over
[24:14] 19 years now, I've come across these
[24:16] other Bible characters and noticed three
[24:18] stages in their life. Praise God that he
[24:20] justifies us. He declares us righteous
[24:22] as we wish to be. He sanctifies us,
[24:25] cleans out our heart, our mind, our
[24:27] daily habits, and then he fills us with
[24:29] his Holy Ghost in our souls. It's a
[24:32] tremendous blessing. Jesus said, "You'll
[24:34] be witnesses unto me, unto Jerusalem,
[24:37] Judea, and the uttermost parts of the
[24:39] world when you receive the baptism of
[24:40] the Holy Ghost." So, thank God that
[24:42] we're witnesses of the truth of God
[24:44] Almighty, the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[24:46] the power of God, this end time message
[24:49] in which the mysteries of God are
[24:51] finished. Praise God that Elijah has
[24:53] come and restored all things according
[24:55] to Matthew 17:1.
[24:57] Friends, keep searching the scriptures,
[24:59] for in them we have eternal life, and
[25:01] they are they that testify of our Lord
[25:03] Jesus Christ. God's true Bible doctrine,
[25:06] such as the three works of grace, the
[25:07] Godhead, water, baptism, serpent, seed,
[25:10] marriage, and divorce. They can
[25:11] withstand all the attacks of Brother
[25:13] Ram's accusers, or any accuser of the
[25:15] Bible who denies the truth of the
[25:17] message of the hour. Thank God for the
[25:19] message of the hour. We're standing on
[25:21] solid rock.
[25:23] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[25:24] testimonies about this video, please
[25:26] contact me.
[25:28] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[25:30] the desire of your heart.
[25:33] Very happy to be here this afternoon.
[25:35] And again, in defense of the gospel of
[25:37] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[25:40] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[25:42] dead, living among man today, his
[25:44] church. The same Jesus that was
[25:47] yesterday will be today and forever.
[25:51] He never failed.
