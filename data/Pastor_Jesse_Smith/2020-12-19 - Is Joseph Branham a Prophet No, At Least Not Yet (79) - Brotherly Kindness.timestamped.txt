[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:11] of the lord jesus christ is our precious
[0:14] brother joseph branham a prophet
[0:17] my personal opinion is no at least not
[0:20] yet
[0:21] and this video explains why again i
[0:24] believe
[0:25] joseph's father brother william branham
[0:27] was a genuine prophet of god the seventh
[0:30] church age messenger
[0:31] and the fulfillment of luke 17 30
[0:34] revelation 10
[0:35] 7 malachi 4 5 and 6 and more
[0:39] by god's grace i preached brother
[0:41] branham's bible revelations
[0:43] for 16 years i first want to say i love
[0:47] and respect our brother in christ
[0:49] brother joseph with christian love
[0:51] he and i have exchanged a few letters
[0:54] and emails
[0:55] i've reached out to him also through
[0:58] private video
[1:00] given him a free copy of my book and
[1:03] tried to share
[1:04] corrections for some of his false
[1:06] teachings
[1:07] but to this point he's not received any
[1:09] of my corrections
[1:11] but that's his right as an american and
[1:14] as a minister
[1:16] after praying and fasting i felt led to
[1:19] make this video for a few reasons
[1:21] first i want to be a voice of truth
[1:24] brother joseph and brother billy paul
[1:26] influence
[1:27] millions and while some of their
[1:29] teachings are correct
[1:31] there are some very dangerous teachings
[1:33] they hold
[1:35] my prayer is that god will direct this
[1:36] video to those who desire the truth
[1:39] about
[1:40] joseph branham's ministry and have some
[1:42] concerns about
[1:43] billy paul's comments and also branham
[1:46] tabernacle
[1:48] again this video is made in brotherly
[1:50] kindness just
[1:51] as brother branham used kindness when
[1:53] trying to publicly correct
[1:55] billy graham david duplessis brother
[1:58] gilmore
[1:59] and brother brock to name a few
[2:02] i'll use this outline for the video
[2:05] first does joseph meet the bible
[2:07] requirements for
[2:08] prophet second we'll examine
[2:11] brother branham's quotes about joseph
[2:14] and third we'll address concerns related
[2:18] to joseph
[2:19] and billy paul
[2:22] first does joseph meet the same bible
[2:24] requirements his father met
[2:27] as with every person who claims to be or
[2:30] exalted
[2:31] to be a prophet christians must give
[2:33] them the word test
[2:35] i'll use the same six bible requirements
[2:38] i used to validate william branham
[2:40] as a genuine prophet to test if joseph
[2:43] is a prophet
[2:44] and i just want to say friends these are
[2:46] not my bible requirements
[2:48] but brother ranum teaches them in the
[2:50] church age book and some of his other
[2:52] sermons
[2:52] i've just gathered them all together and
[2:54] it seems there are six bible
[2:55] requirements
[2:56] for a prophet you can see more about
[2:59] these six
[3:00] bible requirements in our video three
[3:03] prophecies of william branham
[3:06] the first is living a holy life
[3:09] according to first corinthians 9
[3:11] verses 15 to 27 undoubtedly william
[3:14] branham lived a holy life
[3:16] of integrity as for joseph branham it
[3:19] seems he's lived a holy life
[3:21] so it's possible he meets this
[3:22] qualification
[3:25] second requirement is they must teach
[3:28] the word
[3:28] impurity according to galatians 1 6
[3:32] through 12. without question william
[3:34] branham taught the word
[3:35] impurity we know he grew in revelation
[3:38] such as with the trinity
[3:40] and the white horse rider so we have to
[3:42] allow room for joseph branham to grow
[3:44] in revelation for joseph branham
[3:47] he does teach much truth but i'm
[3:49] convinced he teaches at least
[3:51] four or five false doctrines including
[3:54] idolatry
[3:57] examples include his following
[3:59] quotations
[4:01] first his false teaching about the
[4:02] fivefold ministry
[4:04] he says and i quote the true fivefold
[4:07] ministry preach
[4:08] then they played her rahab a tape that's
[4:11] what the fivefold ministry is supposed
[4:13] to do
[4:14] end quote a second false doctrine is
[4:17] about misinterpreting the word
[4:19] of revelation 22 16.
[4:23] remember brother branham said this is
[4:25] one of the five must nots
[4:27] when preaching the word of god joseph
[4:30] says and i quote
[4:31] many critics without revelation say
[4:33] brother branham never said play tapes in
[4:35] the church
[4:36] that's called ears but can't hear others
[4:39] say we just believe the bible and it
[4:40] don't say
[4:41] in the bible neither jesus himself said
[4:44] play tapes in your local church
[4:46] end quote i covered this false doctrine
[4:50] and addition to the word in my video
[4:52] called tape boys are not part of jesus's
[4:55] fivefold ministry if jesus is saying
[4:58] play tapes instead of living preachers
[5:01] he's deleting the fivefold ministry he
[5:03] taught paul
[5:04] in ephesians 4 verse 11. it would also
[5:07] change the gospel paul was given which
[5:10] paul said couldn't be changed
[5:12] in galatians 1. paul warned of another
[5:15] gospel that didn't match
[5:16] the one christ gave him third it seems
[5:20] joseph promotes idolatry
[5:22] of brother branham because he says and i
[5:24] quote
[5:25] i believe everything brother branham
[5:27] says is thus saith the lord
[5:29] this message has to be my absolute end
[5:32] quote
[5:33] this statement makes every word of
[5:35] william branham thus saith the lord
[5:37] or infallible which is idolatry
[5:41] joseph goes on to say and i quote it
[5:44] must be all or nothing
[5:45] i have to believe that everything on
[5:47] tape is thus saith the lord
[5:49] and the absolute the token for our day
[5:52] and i must
[5:52] unquestionably believe every word of
[5:54] brother branham on tape
[5:56] end quote this is a dangerous false
[6:00] doctrine
[6:00] and i humbly believe it's the spirit of
[6:03] idolatry
[6:04] the danger of these statements is
[6:06] deifying william branham
[6:07] by making every word he said the
[6:09] absolute when not
[6:11] every word he said was from god
[6:14] third they teach only the true seed of
[6:16] abraham believe
[6:17] every word on brother branham's tapes
[6:20] which excludes everyone else from being
[6:22] the royal seed of abraham
[6:24] and i quote joseph but god's prophet
[6:27] told us there would be a group of people
[6:28] that would believe
[6:29] every word they are the real living seed
[6:32] of abraham
[6:33] end quote notice also the pressure of
[6:37] fear this movement is using
[6:39] they say falsely of course if you don't
[6:41] believe every word
[6:42] on brother rams tapes or thus saith the
[6:45] lord you are not the real
[6:47] royal seat of abraham and that's an
[6:49] error
[6:51] a fourth false teaching is about the
[6:53] token
[6:54] joseph believes the tapes are the token
[6:58] and that being a part of a tape church
[7:00] is the token
[7:01] and also gave a mandate to stop
[7:03] preaching
[7:04] in order to play tapes and i quote
[7:07] she speaking of rahab had to show her
[7:10] token
[7:11] she said i'm a tape church that's the
[7:14] token
[7:14] i'd say it's real important to say that
[7:16] we're a tape church
[7:18] they referring to preachers got to catch
[7:21] the vision
[7:22] you've got to play the tapes you've got
[7:24] to amen
[7:25] they're the token end quote
[7:29] so in my opinion joseph branham fails
[7:32] this requirement as teaching the word in
[7:34] its purity
[7:36] a third requirement is having converts
[7:38] or fruit of the ministry
[7:40] according to first corinthians 9 verse 2
[7:43] first thessalonians
[7:44] 2 verse 19. william branham had many
[7:47] converts
[7:48] estimated in the 2 millions for joseph
[7:52] branham it seems he may have some
[7:54] but we'd have to question their
[7:55] experience if they believe
[7:57] these four false doctrines which
[7:59] includes idolatry
[8:02] a fourth requirement is revealing
[8:04] secrets according to amos
[8:06] 3 verse 7. william branham was used by
[8:09] god to reveal the seven seals
[8:11] and the bible-defined mysteries such as
[8:13] the rapture the baptism of the holy
[8:15] ghost and more
[8:17] for joseph branham i have heard no
[8:18] examples of his revealing secrets so i
[8:21] believe he fails in meeting this
[8:23] requirement
[8:24] the fifth requirement is anointing for
[8:26] supernatural works
[8:28] according to first chronicles 16 22 acts
[8:31] 5
[8:31] 12 mark 16 verses 17 and 18
[8:35] and john 16 13. william branham had many
[8:39] supernatural
[8:40] signs and i've met a couple who
[8:42] experienced this
[8:44] for joseph branham it seems so as we
[8:46] heard about a man being raised from the
[8:48] dead in their church through prayer
[8:50] so it's possible joseph branham meets
[8:52] this requirement
[8:55] the final requirement is foretelling the
[8:57] future in the name of the lord
[8:59] according to deuteronomy 18 22 and james
[9:02] 5
[9:02] verse 10. for william branham he's
[9:05] foretold
[9:06] healings in the name of the lord as well
[9:08] as three prophecies
[9:09] that are in the process of coming to
[9:11] pass
[9:13] for joseph branham i have not heard him
[9:15] foretell any events
[9:16] in the name of the lord i've sat down
[9:19] and talked to two of his
[9:20] childhood friends and neither have heard
[9:23] him say thus saith the lord
[9:24] in his entire life and he's about 64
[9:27] 65 years old in contrast brother branham
[9:31] said thus saith the lord
[9:32] over one thousand times on tape so
[9:36] in conclusion the word test shows
[9:38] william branham meets all six
[9:40] requirements
[9:41] but it seems joseph branham only meets
[9:43] about three of them
[9:45] and one is questionable so joseph
[9:47] branham is not a prophet
[9:49] in my opinion at least not yet
[9:52] to be a prophet he'd have to meet the
[9:54] other requirements
[9:56] which would require him repenting of his
[9:58] false doctrine
[9:59] and then speaking and foretelling things
[10:01] in the name of the lord and having them
[10:03] come to pass
[10:05] second let's examine brother branham
[10:07] quotes about joseph
[10:10] as we examine brother branham's quotes
[10:12] about joseph you can see
[10:13] none of the quotes ever were spoken with
[10:16] thus saith the lord brother brahm told
[10:18] us to be careful how we listened to him
[10:20] separating the human side from the
[10:23] prophetic side
[10:24] as he said in he cares do you care he
[10:27] said i've always asked you to be careful
[10:28] what you're listening to there's so much
[10:30] of it
[10:31] it's just the human side but always if
[10:34] there's something that goes forth it
[10:35] will speak it
[10:36] it's thus saith the lord even divisions
[10:38] or anything
[10:41] here's william branham's quotes that
[10:43] seem to say joseph is a prophet
[10:45] but there is no thus saith the lord
[10:47] spoken
[10:48] god when my days are done i'd like to
[10:51] see little joseph
[10:52] be a man that i could place this bible
[10:54] in his hand because
[10:55] the day of his dedication he spoke said
[10:58] joseph dowd a prophet
[11:00] i pray god that you let a double portion
[11:02] of spirit on my boy
[11:14] [Applause]
[11:26] yes
[11:29] [Applause]
[11:40] make sure
[11:46] [Applause]
[11:52] notice in this enticing spirits quote
[11:55] brother branham uses the word may
[11:57] which is not thus saith the lord while
[12:00] william branham seems certain joseph is
[12:02] a prophet in these two quotes
[12:04] a third quote shows he's not certain
[12:06] because he says
[12:07] that's my prayer anyhow and i believe
[12:11] it'll be some day notice i believe
[12:14] and not thus saith the lord when i
[12:17] dedicate him to the lord the morning
[12:18] there's many little babies standing i
[12:20] had mothers with him along the altar
[12:22] when i picked up joseph in my arms not
[12:24] thinking of what i'm saying
[12:26] i said joseph my son thou art a prophet
[12:31] that's my prayer anyhow i believe it
[12:33] will be
[12:34] god will take everything that he ever
[12:36] give me a double times devil and put on
[12:38] that boy
[12:39] that will not leave he'll take my place
[12:44] there's a lot to examine in this quote
[12:47] first
[12:47] joseph branham as a prophet was not thus
[12:50] saith the lord
[12:51] it was only a father's hopeful prayer
[12:54] this means the other quotes where
[12:55] brother branham said the lord made
[12:57] joseph branham a prophet
[12:59] were just his hopes william branham was
[13:02] human
[13:03] and not everything he said and thought
[13:05] and hoped for
[13:06] was from the lord a clear example is a
[13:09] dream a sister had
[13:11] about brother branham dying from gunshot
[13:14] brother branham repeated the dream and
[13:16] the dream said the holy spirit said it
[13:18] would happen later
[13:19] but we know he died from injuries
[13:21] sustained during a car accident
[13:23] and not from being shot by the false
[13:26] church system
[13:37] [Applause]
[13:46] sometimes i'm getting out of my car
[13:48] going in they fired me but so then the
[13:50] spirit said not this time but it'll come
[13:52] later
[13:54] god forbid that i compromise on anything
[14:00] second this quote says joseph branham
[14:02] will do four times
[14:04] everything william branham did double it
[14:06] times double
[14:08] friends do you realize the ramifications
[14:10] of this statement
[14:12] if joseph is going to do double times
[14:14] double as brother
[14:16] branham said he needs to hurry for he's
[14:18] never done one discernment prayer line
[14:21] like his daddy he'll have to make 28
[14:24] trips around the world too
[14:27] he'll need to speak 28 squirrels in
[14:29] existence as well
[14:30] since brother branham spoke seven he'll
[14:33] need to win about eight million souls to
[14:35] christ
[14:36] since brother branham said he was in his
[14:38] second million of winning souls to
[14:40] christ
[14:42] third brother branham said joseph was
[14:44] going to take his place
[14:46] but this again must have been his
[14:47] personal hope and opinion
[14:49] because william branham said the same
[14:51] thing about his daughter rebecca
[14:53] and it was related to her seeing visions
[15:05] [Music]
[15:07] who i believe is going to maybe take my
[15:10] place one day
[15:12] she's seen her first vision just
[15:13] recently
[15:15] and she's a very tinder-hearted little
[15:17] thing
[15:20] friends did rebecca branham take william
[15:23] branham's place
[15:24] in any capacity concerning visions
[15:27] the honest answer is no rebecca branham
[15:29] did not minister to thousands through
[15:31] vision
[15:32] like brother branham nor did she have a
[15:34] gift of discernment in public prayer
[15:36] lines
[15:37] nor prophesy publicly with thus saith
[15:40] the lord
[15:41] the key words are i believe is going to
[15:44] maybe
[15:45] these words of i believe and maybe were
[15:48] just
[15:48] a father's hopes for his children both
[15:51] rebecca
[15:52] and at least thus far joseph
[15:55] i'd also like to show brother branham
[15:57] had the same hopes for his son
[15:59] billy paul for he said he hoped that
[16:02] maybe by prayer
[16:04] billy paul would be a full prophet in
[16:06] 1951.
[16:08] but eight years later in 1959 william
[16:11] branham observed
[16:12] billy paul wasn't called to preach
[16:15] so again all of brother branham's hopes
[16:18] for billy paul
[16:19] rebecca and joseph
[16:22] to take his place as a prophet or by
[16:25] seeing visions
[16:27] were not thus saith the lord they were
[16:29] only his
[16:30] human fatherly hopes
[16:34] and then trying to keep myself from sin
[16:37] at that time as much as i knew how i
[16:39] thought maybe god would let my children
[16:42] uh come in to the blessing the full
[16:44] blessing and maybe my
[16:46] little boy would fully be a prophet from
[16:48] god
[16:57] his mother died when he was just 18
[16:59] months old
[17:00] and they've been father and mother both
[17:02] to him but he seems like he doesn't have
[17:04] a call
[17:05] to be a preacher he's bashful
[17:08] backward and so forth a whole lot like
[17:10] his mother's shy
[17:14] thirdly concerns related to joseph and
[17:16] billy paul branham
[17:19] humbly i have the following five
[17:21] concerns connected to the ministries of
[17:24] brother branham's sons
[17:25] joseph and billy paul first i believe
[17:28] joseph has taught
[17:30] and will not repent of at least through
[17:33] my attempts to help him
[17:35] his numerous false doctrines regarding
[17:37] the tapes as the absolute
[17:40] revelation 22 16 saying jesus said to
[17:43] play the tapes
[17:44] and limit preachers a mandate that
[17:47] preachers got to play the tapes and
[17:49] limit their preaching
[17:51] the tapes are the token and the tape
[17:54] boys are the true fivefold ministry
[17:57] and to unquestionably believe every word
[18:00] on brother branham's tapes and believing
[18:03] every word on brother branham's tapes is
[18:06] thus saith the lord
[18:07] among others second i'm concerned about
[18:10] joseph branham's name-calling of those
[18:13] who disagree
[18:14] with him who are actually staying with
[18:16] his father's quotes
[18:18] as joseph said they are demases and
[18:21] make-believers
[18:23] joseph said and i quote when you shut
[18:26] that prophet
[18:27] out of the pulpit and say that's not a
[18:29] live ministry
[18:30] i've got something to tell you demas
[18:33] demas i know i'm going to get it for
[18:35] that but i'm not against nothing
[18:38] but i'm for this word i'm for this
[18:40] message and i'm for this prophet
[18:42] end quote concerning believers make
[18:46] believers and unbelievers
[18:48] joseph said and i quote you the believer
[18:51] you know this message is the truth
[18:53] you know playing the tapes is the truth
[18:55] that's the believer
[18:57] the make believer said man i don't know
[19:00] i don't know if playing the tapes is
[19:02] really right or not
[19:03] it it could be i don't know my pastor
[19:06] says if i play tapes
[19:08] in church if we listen to them i'm just
[19:11] a lazy pastor
[19:12] that's the make believer that's the make
[19:15] believer
[19:15] it's the word it's the word that's
[19:18] that's one
[19:19] she don't know end quote
[19:23] friends it seems joseph thinks any
[19:25] pastor who doesn't play tapes
[19:27] is a make-believer yet his father never
[19:29] taught that
[19:31] for every false teaching of joseph
[19:33] branham there are no quotes of his
[19:35] father
[19:36] to back them up william branham
[19:39] actually taught the opposite and highly
[19:41] esteemed men who preached life
[19:43] and rightly divided the word of truth
[19:52] the most important thing in the name is
[19:55] a good
[19:55] god-sent preacher i admire them
[20:00] and their gift is far beyond anything
[20:03] can be done in anything else as a
[20:04] preacher
[20:05] a man who knows how to rightly divide
[20:07] the word of god
[20:09] the most wonderful gift in the world is
[20:12] to be a minister
[20:13] which is a which was the new testament
[20:15] modern-day prophet
[20:17] a preacher
[20:20] thirdly joseph seems to believe he's
[20:23] like joseph from
[20:24] egypt in the old testament brother
[20:27] branham never taught that though
[20:29] in the 2001 here i stand article brother
[20:32] joseph wrote and i quote
[20:34] you might be eating stolen bread my
[20:36] friend but is not because there is a
[20:38] famine among the bride
[20:40] or because i have scheme to keep food
[20:42] from your table
[20:43] as someone have you to believe the food
[20:46] has been stored up
[20:47] why should the bride be starving the
[20:50] granaries are stocked
[20:52] food is available in 45 languages
[20:55] end quote this interpretation is wrong
[20:58] because
[20:59] brother branham taught the old testament
[21:01] joseph
[21:02] typed jesus not his son joseph
[21:06] the church age book says now let us
[21:08] examine the life of joseph while he was
[21:10] in egypt
[21:11] for it is here we see him as the perfect
[21:14] type of christ
[21:16] another reason it's wrong is because the
[21:19] old testament joseph's wife
[21:21] was never starving for food like joseph
[21:24] branham said about jesus's bride
[21:28] joseph branham's types all fail the
[21:30] correct types are joseph's wife
[21:33] asanath was always in the palace with
[21:35] him
[21:36] typing the gentile bride and she was
[21:38] never starving
[21:40] egypt is correctly tied to the world
[21:43] running to and fro around the world
[21:45] searching for food fulfilling the
[21:47] prophecy of amos
[21:48] 8 11 and 12. joseph's nearly starving
[21:52] brethren
[21:53] are correctly typed as the 144 000
[21:57] jewish remnant fourth i'm greatly
[22:00] concerned and saddened
[22:02] by billy paul's false beliefs regarding
[22:04] his daddy's corporal body
[22:07] in tulsa oklahoma billy paul said and i
[22:10] quote
[22:11] and he god sent a message through a
[22:13] prophet that was infallible
[22:15] word of the living god no mistakes
[22:18] no private interpretation i don't
[22:21] worship the man
[22:22] william branham but i glorify the god
[22:24] that was in the man william branham
[22:27] he william branham lived like jesus but
[22:30] his name was william branham
[22:31] the only difference is the corporal body
[22:34] and anything that don't believe that
[22:36] is the seed of discrepancy end quote
[22:41] there's at least three false doctrines
[22:43] here one brother branham was not
[22:45] infallible
[22:46] brother branham said it was tommy rot to
[22:48] make him infallible
[22:50] as this following quote suggests by the
[22:54] way
[22:55] i have a letter here that uh
[22:59] that just come in the mail as billy
[23:01] picked it up a while ago
[23:03] that some brethren are in michigan and
[23:05] this comes from the ministerial
[23:07] association
[23:08] it's got a lot of things that's what
[23:10] gets things grouped up you see that
[23:12] they're claiming here that some brethren
[23:14] up there that said that i sent them up
[23:16] there and they're preaching that
[23:18] man should leave their wives and hunt
[23:19] for their spiritual mate
[23:22] and that i am perfectly infallible
[23:26] that there's nothing and over some of
[23:28] the office things you've ever heard and
[23:29] the ministerial association
[23:31] got a hold of it and they're writing me
[23:33] a letter about
[23:35] and um but i sent them up there and
[23:38] it's causing a lot of confusion and some
[23:40] of them prophesying and saying that one
[23:42] man should leave this wife and go marry
[23:44] that one
[23:45] this church knows that we don't stand
[23:47] for no such tommy rod is that
[23:51] the only times brother branham was
[23:52] infallible was when he spoke with thus
[23:54] saith the lord
[23:56] second the statement i don't worship the
[23:58] man but i glorify the god that was in
[24:00] the man
[24:01] was never taught by brother branham
[24:03] brother branham never said in his
[24:05] campaigns
[24:06] glorify the god that is in me this seems
[24:09] to be a step towards
[24:10] idolatry brother branham did the
[24:13] opposite
[24:13] he pointed people away from himself the
[24:16] messenger
[24:17] and to the message the person of jesus
[24:19] christ
[24:20] who is the revelation of the word of god
[24:24] lord i love them and i offer my prayer
[24:26] that they will
[24:27] look to you lord may they look away from
[24:29] this mortal play of a servant
[24:32] may they look to him who is the
[24:36] omnipotent
[24:37] who is and we know lord that we are
[24:39] finite no matter who we are we're still
[24:42] mortal
[24:43] but not the messenger but the message
[24:46] granted lord that's where we point to
[24:48] jesus christ the son of god
[24:50] grant that he'll be so real to everyone
[24:52] here today even to the little children
[24:54] that he'll become the absolute of the
[24:57] entire congregation
[24:59] we asked in jesus name amen
[25:04] i'm only telling you the truth i don't
[25:05] let it pass by you
[25:07] i'm not claiming i'm nothing i'm your
[25:10] brother
[25:11] don't you pay attention to a messenger
[25:13] you watch the message
[25:15] don't watch the messenger god will take
[25:17] it away from him
[25:19] he'll share his glory with nobody right
[25:22] don't you watch the messenger watch the
[25:26] message may you always
[25:29] bear that in mind to be a gem in the
[25:31] crown of jesus christ
[25:33] paul said to the church you are you are
[25:35] the jewels
[25:36] the gems of his crown we want to be the
[25:39] gems of the crown of jesus christ
[25:42] we don't want never put a man in it you
[25:44] forget anything about me
[25:46] i am your brother a sinner saved by
[25:49] grace
[25:50] not fit to live that's exactly the truth
[25:54] i send out to be humble that's facts
[25:57] there's nothing in me not one sound
[25:59] thing at all
[26:01] but the grace of god has left my poor
[26:04] dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of
[26:08] power and i see those
[26:10] [Music]
[26:13] third it's utter false doctrine to say
[26:15] the only difference between jesus and
[26:17] brother branham was the corporal body
[26:19] and anyone who don't believe that is the
[26:21] seed of discrepancy
[26:23] friends first thessalonians 5 says man
[26:26] is made up of three parts
[26:28] body human spirit or mind
[26:31] and the soul brother branham was not
[26:33] like jesus in the human spirit
[26:36] or mind or the soul jesus soul was
[26:40] never dead in sins like brother
[26:42] branham's soul
[26:43] as saint paul teach we were all dead in
[26:46] sins and trespasses
[26:49] brother branham's mind committed many
[26:52] sins
[26:52] yet jesus was tempted in his mind
[26:56] but never sinned so you can't say
[26:58] brother branham's mind and soul was
[27:00] exactly the same as jesus's
[27:02] that's simply not true so i would say
[27:06] it's the seed of discrepancy to
[27:08] propagate the teaching
[27:09] that brother branham was exactly like
[27:11] jesus except the corporal body
[27:14] fifth i'm concerned the branham
[27:16] tabernacle services
[27:18] continually invite their pastor brother
[27:20] william branham to preach
[27:22] even though he's dead this is obviously
[27:25] very very wrong
[27:26] william branham never told anyone to do
[27:28] this and even said
[27:30] i will not always be your pastor in
[27:32] 1964.
[27:35] i know it's been long and hot but people
[27:39] we won't always be standing here
[27:43] i won't always be your pastor
[27:48] sixth and finally i'm concerned that
[27:50] followers of branham tabernacle
[27:52] either forget or refuse to answer my
[27:55] point-blank
[27:56] simple questions that demonstrate not
[27:59] every word brother branham said
[28:01] was infallible here's four examples
[28:04] did america get totally annihilated
[28:06] before 1977
[28:09] with only tree stumps left and then
[28:12] there will come a total annihilation the
[28:14] entire nation will be wiped out
[28:16] and that i predict now this is not the
[28:18] lord saying this
[28:19] the other about the woman in his is the
[28:21] lord but i
[28:23] predicted in 19 and 30
[28:26] 33 that the world would be total
[28:29] annihilation before
[28:31] 77. so i didn't know then that they had
[28:34] something that could annihilate it like
[28:36] they got now but i seen
[28:37] the nation in total annihilation just
[28:41] stumps and trees and things like that so
[28:44] it's on its road
[28:47] is the white horse rider of the first
[28:49] seal the holy spirit
[28:51] as brother branham taught in 1961 or the
[28:54] antichrist spirit
[28:55] as he taught in 1963
[28:59] the sixth chapter deals with the with
[29:01] the white horse
[29:03] which was the holy spirit went forth
[29:04] conquering the conqueror then come the
[29:07] pale horse death and hell
[29:10] followed it and each one of those riders
[29:12] on the horses
[29:15] a white horse rider went out they with
[29:19] his mighty in his conquering power
[29:23] he's a great fellow and he's conquering
[29:26] power
[29:28] you only tell who he is he's the
[29:30] antichrist
[29:31] that's exactly what he is
[29:34] who is the real promise joseph is it
[29:37] billy paul
[29:38] as brother branham said in 1951 or
[29:41] joseph branham as brother branham taught
[29:43] in 1958
[29:45] my little boy which is with us now soon
[29:48] be
[29:49] 16 years old he was
[29:52] you seemed to be a good boy he reminded
[29:55] him his very
[29:56] lovely little fella but i talked to him
[29:59] about being baptized and making his
[30:00] public confession of christ
[30:02] he lived good in everything little fella
[30:05] but about a week after that
[30:06] i walked into the house and he'd come
[30:09] without me asking
[30:10] anything said daddy i want to be a
[30:12] christian i want to serve the lord
[30:14] my joseph was right with me i didn't
[30:17] know it
[30:18] a little baby that i thought would be
[30:19] joseph a little girl and i call her
[30:22] sarah
[30:26] i'm thankful for her i love her with all
[30:29] my heart
[30:32] the little boy many of you know the
[30:34] story of little joseph
[30:36] the lord showed him to me six years
[30:39] before he was
[30:40] come to the earth and
[30:43] he promised me a boy because i liked
[30:46] joseph so well
[30:49] did rebecca marry a bride a woman
[30:52] as brother branham said in 1958 or a
[30:55] bridegroom
[30:56] as he said in
[31:03] and that 1963 beast that she was water
[31:07] was the one who passed her 205
[31:13] eliza when he came to get better
[31:17] rebecca she mounted her up on a camel
[31:20] the very camel she watered and she
[31:24] rolled this
[31:24] camel to meet her unseen
[31:30] bridegroom does the third person of the
[31:33] trinity dwell in our hearts
[31:34] as brother branham taught in 1952
[31:38] or does the one and only person of the
[31:40] godhead the holy spirit
[31:41] dwell in our hearts as he taught in 1963
[31:46] truly we're not much in this world we're
[31:48] looked down upon
[31:50] but god we believe we're accepted in
[31:52] christ jesus
[31:53] and he in return us give us the holy
[31:55] ghost we love him
[31:58] that great first person of the trinity
[32:00] who burns through our hearts
[32:02] and we love him
[32:06] his death didn't stop him no so he
[32:08] returned again
[32:10] not a third person but the same person
[32:15] [Music]
[32:21] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[32:23] and forever
[32:24] that's the token that's the silence
[32:29] friends there are many many more
[32:31] contradicting quotes from brother
[32:32] branham
[32:33] that prove not every word he spoke was
[32:35] infallible
[32:36] he was human and grew in his
[32:38] understanding
[32:40] friends i sent one of these questions to
[32:42] our precious brother joseph
[32:44] does the third person of the trinity
[32:45] dwell in our hearts as brother branham
[32:47] taught in 1952
[32:50] and i heard back from him on september
[32:52] 17
[32:53] 2020 and his answer was this
[32:57] and i quote dear brother smith i believe
[33:00] every word he spoke on the tapes
[33:02] for it is the revelation of jesus christ
[33:05] hebrews 13
[33:06] 8 end quote so see friends brother
[33:09] joseph and his friends
[33:11] at the branham tabernacle cannot give us
[33:13] answers
[33:14] about these questions their false
[33:16] doctrine has trapped them in a corner
[33:19] and all they can say is that i believe
[33:20] every word he said was thus saith the
[33:22] lord
[33:24] this helps us to learn a few things our
[33:26] precious brothers either don't have a
[33:28] preaching gift to rightly divide the
[33:30] word of truth
[33:31] or their babes in christ through a lack
[33:34] of exercising the preaching gift of
[33:36] discernment
[33:37] according to hebrews 5 verses 12 through
[33:39] 14.
[33:41] it also tells us the tape boys are not
[33:43] in the fivefold ministry
[33:44] because they cannot rightly divide the
[33:46] word of truth
[33:48] regarding my four simple questions above
[33:51] because they're trapped by the deity
[33:53] spirit into thinking
[33:54] everything is thus saith the lord and
[33:57] there are no contradictions
[33:58] in any word brother branham spoke on
[34:01] tape
[34:02] yet a holy ghost-filled preacher can
[34:04] rightly divide the truth on these
[34:06] questions
[34:07] and here's the answers regarding 1977
[34:11] the united states was not annihilated
[34:13] before 1977
[34:14] it was brother branham's human
[34:16] prediction that didn't come to pass
[34:18] yet he's still a genuine prophet because
[34:20] he didn't make that prediction in the
[34:22] name of the lord
[34:23] regarding the identity of the white
[34:25] horse rider it's the antichrist spirit
[34:28] as brother random taught in 1963 because
[34:31] he taught that with the authority of
[34:33] thus saith the lord
[34:35] regarding the promise joseph billy paul
[34:38] was not the promised joseph
[34:40] as brother random taught in 1951 but his
[34:42] youngest son was
[34:44] brother branham was simply trying to
[34:46] interpret god's promised word
[34:48] using his human thinking but god
[34:50] corrected him
[34:52] regarding rebecca she didn't marry a
[34:54] wife as brother branham mistakenly said
[34:57] it was a slip of the mind and tongue he
[34:59] meant to say bridegroom but mistakenly
[35:01] said
[35:02] rebecca married a bride regarding the
[35:05] third person of the trinity
[35:06] dwelling in believers hearts brother
[35:09] branham grew in revelation
[35:10] and by 1963 he knew god was only one
[35:13] person
[35:14] not three and he actually spoke it with
[35:16] thus saith the lord in 1961
[35:19] so his belief in three persons was wrong
[35:22] and god corrected him
[35:24] in closing with broadly kindness i say
[35:27] again
[35:28] i love brother joseph and billy paul but
[35:30] i believe they are simply wrong
[35:32] on these important subjects my attempts
[35:35] to correct them
[35:36] privately didn't work but i will keep
[35:38] praying for them
[35:39] to open their hearts to god's truth i
[35:42] felt led of the holy ghost to make this
[35:44] video to help them speak the truth
[35:46] on these subjects for the truth will
[35:48] make them free
[35:49] and all the people they influence
[35:52] i hope this video is a blessing my
[35:55] prayers that it would help
[35:56] those who are confused about the
[35:58] teachings coming out of the branham
[36:00] tabernacle
[36:01] i know god will direct this video the
[36:04] word of god that's on it
[36:05] to the hearts that are hungering and
[36:07] thirsting for jesus righteousness
[36:11] please contact me with any questions
[36:13] concerns
[36:14] or testimonies about this video
[36:18] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[36:20] the desire
[36:21] of your heart
