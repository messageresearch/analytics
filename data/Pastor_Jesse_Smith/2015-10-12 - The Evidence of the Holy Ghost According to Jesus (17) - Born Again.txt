TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach what is the true evidence for the baptism of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself recall that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the third work of Grace that very few people will receive and so the evidence of experiencing this third work of Grace we are about to teach from the words of Jesus himself will be rarely found in the world today the evidence let us Begin by plainly stating that Jesus's evidence for receiving the Holy Ghost was and still is the following the Holy Ghost is a seal according to Ephesians 4:30 inside of you guiding you into all truth of the the word of God that he has revealed in the age in which you live to State it in other words the Holy Ghost fil believer will do the following they will be in the word all the way they will live and obey the word of God for their day and hour they will receive the word from the human messenger who is preaching the true word of God to their generation they will have the spirit of Christ in them perform performing the same works that Jesus did the true evidence of the Holy Ghost is found in the following scriptures according to Jesus himself St John 6:45 John 16:13 John 13:20 and John 14:12 John 6:45 it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me Jesus taught that only the children of God can learn and be taught the word of God According To Jesus himself Children of the devil cannot understand the Bible and will not obey it John 8:43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murder from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speak of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not furthermore Jesus said that make Believers or Sinners of the world could not receive the spirit of Truth in John 14:17 even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you second we will will quote Jesus from John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth so a true Holy Ghost filled believer today will be guided deeper into the understanding and living all the truth of the Bible they will hunger and thirst for righteousness according to Matthew 5:6 and seek to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God according to Matthew 4:4 they will not be a lukewarm backslid Bible rejecting sin loving church member third we will quote Jesus from John 13 verse 20 verily verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me Jesus taught that he himself would be sending messengers of his truth and if anyone receive those Messengers and their preaching it would be the same as if they receive the preaching of Jesus himself how important it is for us to receive the human messenger that has or will preach to Our Generation by the grace of God we believe God's Messenger to our generation has come and gone but not without leaving us infallible proofs that he was God's messenger for these last days William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 is in our opinion the most bible-based preacher and Holy Ghost Vindicated Prophet messenger Our Generation has ever witnessed his undeniable Supernatural prophetic son of man gift of discernment is without comparison in any realm or religious Circle because it was Jesus Christ himself manifesting through his humble servant brother brandham please see the video three Prophecies of William brandham for a detailed look at this Supernatural son of man Ministry we believe a true Holy Ghost fill belever will receive William brandham as the god-sent messenger for the last days for brother brandham preached the word of God by stating thus sayeth the Lord just as God told another genuine Prophet named Ezekiel to do Ezekiel 30:2 son of man prophesy and say thus sayeth the Lord God how ye woe worth the day fourth the person or Spirit of Christ himself the Holy Ghost will perform the same works in the life of the true Christian as Jesus did when his physical body was here on the earth John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father the evidence in action since the evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving the word of God for your day we realize this could sound vague to some people so we want to share numerous actions s Jesus taught that True Believers would manifest in their daily life let's see what the evidence in action looks like in the life of a true Christian first Jesus said his true disciples would have love one for another John 13:35 by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another second Jesus said his true believers would have Supernatural and Powerful signs of the holy ghost following them in their Ministries and that is because they first received the true word of God signs always follow the true word of God Mark 1617 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover third Jesus said the Holy Ghost would abide or dwell with the true belever Believers always John 14:16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever fourth Jesus said the Holy Ghost would bring his own words to the remembrance of the True Believers John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you fifth Jesus said the Holy Ghost would testify or witness of Jesus and also glorify Jesus A True Believer will always glorify Jesus only and filter all their thoughts and teachings through the words of Jesus in the Bible John 15:26 and 27 but when the comforters come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning John 1614 and 15 he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you six Jesus said the Holy Ghost would reprove or convict or expose the world of their sin and convict them of the righteousness and judgments of God John 16: 7-1 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you shall see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is is judged Jesus will always urge his followers to repent of their sins in fact Jesus taught us to be zealous which means eagerly desirous to repent of our sins especially in these last days the L to see in church age Revelation 3: 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent the Bible teaches we should hate sin according to Romans 7 ver1 15 and strive for a perfect holy life according to 2 Corinthians 7:1 if you love Jesus and are born again you will hate your sin and strive to live a perfect life of Holiness before God Jude 1 123 says we should hate sin as well hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh seventh a True Believer will overcome the sin and Temptation Of The World the gates or c of Hell will not Prevail against the true Christian 1 John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith eighth a True Believer will know about the future because the Holy Ghost will show them prophecy about what is to come John 16:13 through1 15 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come we are so thankful that the Holy Ghost still prophesies and foretells the future we have produced two videos that share numerous prophecies about the future and we encourage you to view them God has foretold us about the following topics the mark of the beast Rome and the Vatican the United States advances in science and and reassuring prophecies for True Christians the spirit has shown us things to come just as Jesus Promised ninth true Christians will not add anything to the Bible or take anything away from the Bible according to Revelations 22: 18 and 19 most denominations and non- denominational churches began based upon their own interpretations of the Bible and this is very dangerous each set of Creeds or bylaws if not written by the Holy Ghost quickly becomes a cursed thing because the writing usually adds to the Bible or takes away from the Bible for example many churches add to the Bible by teaching that we should pray to Mary or other Saints who've already died Jesus and St Paul never taught intercession through Saints and so this is a clear addition to the word of God many churches take away from the Bible by not preaching simple Holiness standards that are clearly taught in the Bible such as women abstaining from wearing makeup and cutting their hair just to name a few simple examples So True Believers today will only have one Creed and that will be the full word of Christ everything in the Bible so that nothing is added and nothing is taken away the evidence has always been the same if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever according to Hebrews 13:8 then the evidence of being a true follower of his must have been the same in every age as well that means receiving and living the word of God for your age has always been and always will be the evidence of those who are truly born again or are True Believers in Jesus Christ this proves that speaking in tongues cannot be the evidence of being a True Believer today because that gift has never been the evidence in the past and never will be in the future either recently we produced a video that gave seven Bible proofs that tongues were not the evidence of the Holy Ghost we hope you will view this video and pray about the truths contained in it trusting you will find the true evidence of the Holy Ghost through the words of Jesus Christ himself as we have presented on this video Let's briefly look at four simple Bible examples of how the evidence of being a True Believer which is receiving and living the word for your age has always been the same as we will recall the lives and ministries of Noah Moses John the Baptist and St Paul in Noah's day eight True Believers were saved from the worldwide flood why were they saved they were saved because they received the word of God for their day which was repent of your sin and seek life and deliverance in the ark Noah and seven other genuine Believers obeyed and listened to the righteous words of God according to 2 Peter 2:5 while the rest of the world were blindly worshiping the wicked imaginations of their hearts continually according to Genesis 6:5 in Moses's day only two Believers made it into the promised land Caleb and Joshua these two men had the evidence of being true believers because they were guided into all the truth of Moses's message they were Believers in the words of God all the way the Bible said Caleb had another spirit in numbers 14:24 so Joshua would have also had this Holy Spirit anointing him as well both men heard the word of God for their day from the human messenger god had chosen for that day which was Moses then Joshua and Caleb obeyed Moses's command from God and lived all the word for their day while the Bible said that the majority of the Israelites who died in the wilderness were destroyed because they did not believe God and his servant Moses according to Jude 1:5 in John the Baptist's day the Bible plainly teaches that the True Believers of his day heard his words and repented confessing their sins and being baptized by him in the wilderness according to Matthew 3: 1 2 and 7 obeying the word of God that came to John and being baptized in water was the evidence of being a True Believer in that day the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God through John's preaching and refused to be baptized by John according to Luke 7:30 John the Baptist called those who rejected his message a Generation of Vipers according to Matthew 3: 7 in St Paul's day the Bible teaches how the Saints at Ephesus received the word of God for their day in Acts 19: 1-6 these Believers had the evidence of being true believers because they willingly obeyed Paul's command to be re-baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus for the gift of the Holy Ghost so the 12 True Believers in Ephesus were re-baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus and then received the Spirit by immersion the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were able to live the word of God for their day despite how it Advanced so recently after the age of John the Baptist and into the age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost asking for the true baptism in closing we plead with you to ask for the real evidence of the Holy Ghost Luke 11:10 for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him remember Jesus taught very few would find the narrow road according to Matthew 7:14 very few people will actually receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in order to receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible teaches in Acts 5:32 that you must obey the word of God to obey the word of God you must live against the trends of society you must hate sin you must hate worldly entertainment and you must love the righteousness of Jesus Christ our prayer is that you receive the word of God for your day through the messenger that God has sent to us in this hour may God strengthen you to obey all the words of God and receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost if you receive this baptism your life will be in the word all the way if you have any questions about the true evidence for the baptism of the Holy Ghost please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
