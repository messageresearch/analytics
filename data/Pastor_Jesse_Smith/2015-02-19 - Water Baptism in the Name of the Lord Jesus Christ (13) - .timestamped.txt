[0:09] greetings in Jesus Christ's name the
[0:11] purpose of this video is to present the
[0:13] one and only Bible way to be baptized in
[0:16] water there are many different ways
[0:18] groups choose to baptize Believers such
[0:21] as father son Holy Ghost and Jesus only
[0:24] but these two specific examples do not
[0:27] take into account all the scriptures in
[0:29] the Bible about baptism which makes them
[0:31] incomplete and
[0:34] [Music]
[0:37] inaccurate we want to humbly present
[0:39] what all the Bible teaches about being
[0:41] baptized in water we will show that we
[0:44] must baptize Believers which means
[0:46] completely immersing them underwater as
[0:48] we call upon the literal name of the
[0:51] Lord Jesus Christ This is a crucial
[0:53] subject as we believe the Bible proves
[0:55] that nearly 1 billion Believers today
[0:58] have been baptized incre ly this
[1:01] estimate might seem shocking to some but
[1:04] Revelation 12:9 said that Satan would
[1:07] deceive the whole world from the truth
[1:10] and Jesus said those that find the true
[1:12] way will be few and the way is narrow
[1:15] according to Matthew
[1:17] 7:14 now let's look at five sections on
[1:19] the subject of water baptism Sola
[1:21] scriptura by scripture
[1:28] alone Believers in Jesus Christ should
[1:31] be fully immersed or buried in water
[1:33] when being baptized the Greek word for
[1:36] baptize literally means immerse or
[1:40] submerge four scriptures from the Bible
[1:42] show how Believers went down into the
[1:44] water had much water there and were
[1:46] buried in water at the moment of being
[1:52] baptized full immersion in water has
[1:54] Bible evidence on the other hand
[1:56] sprinkling at baptism has no Bible
[1:59] evidence zero
[2:01] examples so it cannot be accepted by the
[2:04] Believers because Jesus said every word
[2:06] is established in the mouth of two or
[2:08] three
[2:09] Witnesses by scripture alone there are
[2:11] only seven times the New Testament
[2:13] mentions sprinkling and none of them
[2:15] relate to baptism without a doubt full
[2:17] immersion water is the only method the
[2:19] Bible gives for being
[2:21] baptized the practices of sprinkling at
[2:24] baptism and also baptizing infants did
[2:28] not come from the Bible so must have
[2:30] came from man and therefore it is a
[2:32] tradition of man that makes the word of
[2:34] God of none effect According To Jesus in
[2:37] Matthew 15:
[2:41] 6 by scripture alone we encourage you to
[2:44] be fully immersed in water at your
[2:46] baptism or your rebaptism the Bible
[2:49] supports rebaptism in cases where
[2:51] Believers were unaware of the baptism
[2:53] for the gift of the Holy Ghost according
[2:55] to Acts 19
[2:58] 1-5
[3:04] now that we've seen how the Bible only
[3:06] supports full immersion in water we want
[3:09] to answer the question what name do we
[3:11] call upon at baptism as stated earlier
[3:14] most Believers are baptized calling upon
[3:16] the father son holy ghost or the name of
[3:19] Jesus only these two examples though do
[3:22] not take the entire book of Acts into
[3:24] account and so they are incomplete and
[3:26] inaccurate by scripture alone Believers
[3:29] should call upon on the name of the Lord
[3:30] Jesus Christ when being baptized the
[3:34] book of Acts has 10 recorded baptisms
[3:36] five of them State the name that was
[3:39] called upon let's look at this simple
[3:41] table to understand how God wants you
[3:43] and I to be
[3:44] [Music]
[3:46] baptized as we can all see Jesus
[3:48] commanded his disciples to baptize in
[3:50] the name of the father Son and Holy
[3:52] Ghost in Matthew 2819 before his
[3:55] Ascension to Heaven according to acts 13
[3:58] and 21 10 days after Jesus gave this
[4:01] command St Peter commanded that baptism
[4:04] be carried out in the name of Jesus
[4:05] Christ on the day of Pentecost not long
[4:09] after that St Philip commanded Believers
[4:10] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[4:13] Jesus St Peter was again recorded
[4:15] baptizing in the name of the Lord in
[4:17] Acts 10:48 acts 19:5 shows that St Paul
[4:21] baptized the Ephesians in the name of
[4:23] the Lord Jesus last St Paul testified to
[4:26] Agrippa in Acts 22:16 that he was
[4:29] baptized AP ized in the name of the Lord
[4:31] keep in mind that there is not one
[4:33] scripture in the Bible that shows the
[4:35] apostles baptizing using the words
[4:37] Father Son and Holy Ghost this is
[4:39] because the apostles understood Jesus's
[4:42] words and Matthew
[4:44] 28:19 Jesus's disciples knew that the
[4:47] words Father Son and Holy Ghost were not
[4:50] literal names but were simply titles of
[4:52] the name of the one true God the literal
[4:55] name of God is the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:58] just as a man like my myself can have a
[5:00] literal name yet with many titles my
[5:03] titles include father son brother Uncle
[5:08] husband teacher pastor and friend to
[5:11] name a few but my literal name is Jesse
[5:14] Ray Smith and I cannot sign my checks
[5:16] using the titles but I must sign my
[5:18] checks using the power of my literal
[5:20] name because that identifies my person
[5:23] who I am so it is with god he has many
[5:27] titles such as father son Holy Ghost
[5:30] Rose of Sharon lily of the valley
[5:33] Everlasting father Jehovah Gyra and so
[5:36] forth but the name of God that has power
[5:38] to perform Miracles and cast out demons
[5:42] and do every good work is the literal
[5:44] name of God the Lord Jesus Christ notice
[5:47] that in Matthew 28:19 Jesus said to
[5:50] baptize in the name not names plural of
[5:54] the Father Son and Holy Ghost this is
[5:57] very important to note that the name of
[5:59] the the father Son and Holy Ghost is
[6:01] singular and not plural just as the
[6:04] promises were made to Abraham's seed
[6:07] singular and not seeds plural so Jesus
[6:10] said to baptize in the singular name not
[6:13] names of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[6:17] this further proves that the name of
[6:19] Jesus Christ is the One Singular name of
[6:22] God because St Peter St Paul and St
[6:25] Phillip all baptized using the singular
[6:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:30] by scripture alone we can clearly see
[6:32] that the early Apostles knew that the
[6:34] Lord Jesus Christ was the one and only
[6:37] name to be called upon when
[6:42] [Music]
[6:46] baptizing Matthew 28:19 is one of the
[6:49] most misunderstood scriptures in the
[6:51] Bible today some teach that St Peter
[6:54] philli and Paul broke jesus' command in
[6:57] Matthew 28:19 by not saying the words
[7:00] Father Son and Holy Ghost when baptizing
[7:03] in the book of Acts others have even
[7:05] taught that we should obey Jesus in
[7:07] Matthew 28:19 and reject the book of
[7:10] Acts because they believe the early
[7:12] Apostles contradicted Jesus's command
[7:14] how sad to think that some would reject
[7:16] parts of the Bible and think that jesus'
[7:19] own Apostles would contradict his
[7:21] teaching the truth is that there is no
[7:24] contradiction but there is a revelation
[7:27] Jesus opened their understanding in Luke
[7:47] [Music]
[8:10] [Music]
[8:29] godhead must include the father and Holy
[8:32] Ghost According To Jesus himself the
[8:35] fullness of the father lived in his body
[8:38] John 14:10 the father in me the father
[8:41] that dwells in me he doeth The Works
[8:44] without a doubt the father dwelt in the
[8:46] body of Jesus Christ the Bible also
[8:49] teaches how the holy ghost dwelt in the
[8:51] body of Christ John 1: 32 and 33 the
[8:56] spirit Abode on him and the Spirit
[9:00] remaining on him John
[9:02] 3:34 God giveth the spirit unto him acts
[9:07] 10:38 God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
[9:10] with the Holy Ghost and with power based
[9:13] upon the words of Jesus himself the
[9:15] father Son and Holy Ghost were all
[9:17] declared or manifested through his
[9:20] bodily presence on Earth so then there
[9:22] is one name of the godhead the name of
[9:25] the Lord Jesus
[9:28] Christ
[9:30] [Music]
[9:34] We Believe scripture teaches that Jesus
[9:36] Christ is the name above all names while
[9:38] it is true our God is a father Son and
[9:40] Holy Ghost the Bible tells us there is
[9:43] one name we are saved by in Acts 4:12
[9:46] that one name is the name above all
[9:48] names according to Philippians 2:9 it is
[9:52] the name of Jesus Christ it is the
[9:54] family name of the Believers according
[9:56] to Ephesians 3:15 demon were and still
[10:00] are cast out in the literal name of
[10:02] Jesus Christ according to acts
[10:05] 16:18 Miracles were and still are done
[10:08] in the literal name of Jesus Christ
[10:10] according to acts 3:6 please understand
[10:14] that no miracle was ever performed in
[10:16] the titles father son holy ghost in the
[10:18] Bible proving that father son Holy Ghost
[10:21] is not the literal name of God and so
[10:24] baptism must be carried out in the
[10:26] literal name of Jesus Christ because the
[10:28] Bible also says that baptism is to be
[10:31] performed in the name of the one who is
[10:33] crucified according to 1 Corinthians
[10:36] 1:13 the father and the Holy Ghost were
[10:39] not crucified for you for Jesus said God
[10:42] is a spirit in John 4:24 and the word
[10:45] ghost means spirit and Spirits do not
[10:47] have flesh and blood but God's son whose
[10:50] name was and is Jesus Christ did die on
[10:53] the cross for our sins and so it is in
[10:56] his name that we must be buried in water
[10:59] this has to be the truth because in the
[11:01] book of Acts every baptism was performed
[11:04] using the literal name of Jesus Christ
[11:06] or Lord Jesus or Lord whatever we do in
[11:09] word or deed including Miracles
[11:11] baptizing and casting out evil spirits
[11:14] we are to do all in the name of the Lord
[11:16] Jesus Christ according to Colossians
[11:28] 3:17 so where did this misinterpretation
[11:31] and misunderstanding of Matthew 28:19
[11:34] come from history shows that near the
[11:36] end of the first century Believers
[11:38] started baptizing using the Liturgy
[11:41] formula which only uses one scripture
[11:44] Matthew
[11:45] 28:19 this was a gross Heir Doctrine
[11:48] cannot be built upon one scripture
[11:50] according to Isaiah 28: 9-10 and 2
[11:53] Corinthians
[11:55] 13:1 you cannot teach baptism by Matthew
[11:58] 28:19 alone you must include the book of
[12:01] Acts for that is the record of how
[12:03] Jesus's apostles interpreted his words
[12:06] in Matthew
[12:07] 2819 historically Scholars recognize two
[12:10] different baptisms the first is the
[12:13] apostolic baptism and the second is the
[12:15] Liturgy baptism we have 14 historical
[12:18] references all saying the same
[12:22] thing the first baptism the apostolic
[12:25] baptism was carried out only using the
[12:27] name of Jesus Christ
[12:29] just as the Bible shows there are five
[12:31] baptisms in the book of Acts using the
[12:33] apostolic
[12:35] baptism notice that none of the Bible
[12:37] baptisms are performed using the Liturgy
[12:39] baptism of father son Holy Ghost the
[12:42] modern baptism of today called the
[12:44] Liturgy baptism using Father Son and
[12:47] Holy Ghost began sometime near the end
[12:49] or beginning of the first century and is
[12:51] a misunderstanding of the words of Jesus
[12:54] and thus is a false baptism according to
[12:56] the Bible and
[12:58] history most honest- hearted Christians
[13:00] are most likely unaware of these truths
[13:03] because they have not heard it preached
[13:05] that is why we have such a burden to get
[13:07] the truth out to Christians for the
[13:09] truth on water baptism and every other
[13:12] Bible subject will set them
[13:15] free here's another look at the history
[13:17] of the two different baptisms using a
[13:20] baptism timeline from 33 ad to 100 AD
[13:25] the first and original baptism is called
[13:27] the apostolic baptism this is the true
[13:29] baptism formula and is carried out in
[13:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ on the
[13:34] day of Pentecost around 33 ad St Peter
[13:37] said in Acts 238 that baptism was in the
[13:40] name of Jesus Christ approximately 26
[13:44] years later after St Peter baptized
[13:46] Believers around 59 ad St Paul was
[13:49] recorded as baptizing Believers in the
[13:51] name of the Lord Jesus in acts
[13:54] 19:5 so we see Peter and Paul were
[13:57] baptizing the same way 30 years apart
[13:59] from one another proving that the Lord
[14:01] Jesus Christ is the one name of the
[14:04] father Son and Holy
[14:06] Ghost approximately 40 years after St
[14:09] Paul around the end of the first century
[14:12] history tells us the Liturgy baptism
[14:14] began which is a false baptism formula
[14:17] which was used by non- Apostles and
[14:19] there are no scriptures in the book of
[14:21] Acts of anyone baptizing using the words
[14:24] father son Holy Ghost notice the
[14:26] apostles never use the Liturgy baptism
[14:28] of calling upon the titles of Father Son
[14:31] and Holy Ghost but rather the Apostles
[14:33] of Jesus called upon Jesus's name the
[14:36] Lord Jesus Christ so the Bible and
[14:38] history both prove that everyone in the
[14:40] early church was baptized in the name of
[14:43] the Lord Jesus Christ no one was
[14:45] baptized using the words Father Son and
[14:47] Holy Ghost until the end of the first
[14:49] century so it took nearly 70 years after
[14:52] the apostolic baptism for the false
[14:55] baptism using titles was introduced we
[14:58] hope you'll be baptized in the only
[15:00] Apostolic and bible-based way calling
[15:03] upon the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:05] [Music]
[15:11] Christ in conclusion we pray that you
[15:14] will consider these truths and act upon
[15:16] them if you believe in Jesus Christ with
[15:19] all of your heart and if you want to be
[15:21] baptized or re-baptized Sola scriptura
[15:24] by scripture alone being baptized
[15:27] correctly is of utmost importance
[15:29] for when you are baptized in the name of
[15:31] the Lord Jesus Christ you have the
[15:33] promise to receive the gift of the Holy
[15:35] Ghost according to Acts 2:38 and 39 the
[15:38] Born Again experience is the same as the
[15:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it is the
[15:42] Seal of God upon your soul until the day
[15:45] of your Redemption according to
[15:47] Ephesians 4:30 being born again allows
[15:49] you to see and enter the kingdom of God
[15:52] according to John 3: 3 and 5 and it
[15:55] makes you one of his own according to
[15:57] Romans
