[26:21] the whole world. Just uh if you want to
[26:24] go ahead and turn in your Bibles to me,
[26:25] we're going to invite you to the
[26:27] scriptures.
[26:30] We're going to turn into Romans
[26:33] Romans chapter 4 will be our second
[26:36] reading. Go to go ahead and go to
[26:37] Genesis 17 first. Genesis 17 and verses
[26:42] 1.
[26:44] gonna catch the first few verses there
[26:50] and then we're gonna turn into Romans
[26:52] chapter 4.
[26:56] Romans se uh Genesis 17 and it says,
[26:58] "And when Abraham was 90 years old and
[27:02] nine, the Lord appeared to Abram and
[27:04] said unto him, I am the Almighty God.
[27:08] Walk before me and be thou perfect, and
[27:10] I will make my covenant between me and
[27:12] thee, and will multiply thee
[27:15] exceedingly." And Abraham fell on his
[27:18] face. And God talked with him, saying,
[27:21] As for me, behold, my covenant is with
[27:24] thee, and thou shalt be a father of many
[27:26] nations. Neither shall thy name anymore
[27:29] be called Abraham, but thy name shall be
[27:33] Abraham, for a father of many nations
[27:36] have I made thee. And I will make thee
[27:38] exceeding fruitful. And I will make thee
[27:40] nations of thee. And kings shall come
[27:42] out of thee. And I will establish my
[27:44] covenant between me and thee, and thy
[27:47] seed after thee in their generations for
[27:49] an everlasting covenant to be a god unto
[27:51] thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I
[27:54] will give unto thee, and to thy seed
[27:55] after thee, and the land wherein thou
[27:57] art a stranger, all the land of Canaan,
[28:00] for thou art for an everlasting
[28:02] possession, and I will be their God.
[28:05] Amen. And if let's go ahead and turn in
[28:08] our Bibles to Romans chapter 4.
[28:12] Romans chapter 4. And we're going to
[28:14] catch verses 13 down through verses
[28:20] 25. Amen. It says, "For the promise that
[28:23] he should be the heir of the world was
[28:24] not to Abraham or to his seed through
[28:27] the law, but through the righteousness
[28:30] of faith. For if they which are of the
[28:32] law be heirs, faith is made void. and
[28:35] the promise made of none effect. Because
[28:37] the law workketh wrath, for where no law
[28:40] is, there is no transgression.
[28:42] Therefore, it is of faith that it might
[28:44] be by grace to the end. The promise
[28:47] might be sure to all the seed, not to
[28:50] the last only which is of the law, but
[28:52] to that also which is of the faith of
[28:54] Abraham, who is the father of us all. As
[28:57] it is written, I have made thee a father
[28:59] of many nations before him,
[29:02] whom he believed, even God, who
[29:04] quickenth the dead, and called those
[29:07] things which be not as though they were.
[29:10] Who against hope believed in hope. Think
[29:14] of that statement. Who against hope
[29:16] believed in hope, that he might become
[29:20] the father of many nations, according to
[29:22] that which was spoken, so shall thy seed
[29:24] be. And being not weak in faith, he
[29:26] considered not his own body dead now
[29:29] dead when he was about a hundred years
[29:31] old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[29:33] womb. He staggered not at the promise of
[29:36] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[29:38] the faith, giving glory to God, and
[29:40] being fully persuaded that what he was
[29:43] what he had promised, he was also able
[29:46] to perform. And therefore, it was
[29:48] imputed to him for righteousness. Now it
[29:51] was not written for his sake alone that
[29:53] it was imputed him, but for us also to
[29:57] whom it shall be imputed, if we believe
[30:00] on him that raised up Jesus our Lord
[30:03] from the dead, who was delivered for our
[30:05] offenses and was raised again for our
[30:09] justification.
[30:11] Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[30:12] prayer. Heavenly Father, we just are so
[30:15] grateful, Lord, and so thankful, Lord,
[30:17] for this opportunity to come before you
[30:19] tonight, Lord. We just have an
[30:23] expectation in our heart to hear from
[30:24] you, Lord. May you just open the word up
[30:26] to us. May you break the bread of life,
[30:28] Lord, to us, Lord. May you bring this
[30:30] thought together, Lord, just the way
[30:32] that you laid it upon my heart, Lord.
[30:33] And may there, Lord, may may their ears
[30:35] be open, Lord. May may we just be ready
[30:38] to receive from you. We love you now,
[30:40] Lord God, and we just commit this entire
[30:42] service to you, Lord Jesus. We're here
[30:44] to give you glory and give you honor.
[30:46] We're here to just separate ourselves
[30:48] from the world for a few minutes. And
[30:50] Lord, just hear from the throne room,
[30:52] Lord. We have many needs here tonight,
[30:54] Lord. We have, Lord, many requests, Lord
[30:57] Jesus. And all of those things can be
[30:59] taken care of in just a moment of your
[31:01] presence, Lord. So, that's what we're
[31:02] here tonight to do, Lord. Not to hear a
[31:05] preacher, Lord, who father is nervous
[31:07] and he and has, Lord, no place being
[31:10] here, Lord, but to hear from you,
[31:12] Father. We're here to hear from the
[31:14] throne roomworm. We commit it to you now
[31:16] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you this
[31:19] evening as you take your seats. Thanks,
[31:21] bro. Appreciate that. I wanted to try to
[31:24] bring a couple of thoughts together
[31:25] tonight as the Lord uh as the Lord laid
[31:28] the sermon on my heart. um you know, he
[31:31] just kind of gives gives you things and
[31:33] then you try to put it together, but
[31:35] it's really him that puts it together.
[31:36] Amen. So, at first I was kind of torn in
[31:38] a few directions, but I'm just leaning
[31:40] on him tonight to bring it together the
[31:42] way he inspired it to me. So, there in
[31:44] our opening text, we're looking at this
[31:46] statement here that seems almost
[31:48] contradictory to itself against hope yet
[31:52] believed in hope. Amen. It seems like a
[31:54] paradox yet something incredible but
[31:56] true. Abraham and just a kind of a
[32:00] conglomeration of verses. Abraham being
[32:02] not weak in faith, staggered not at the
[32:04] promise, being fully persuaded, it was
[32:07] imputed unto him. And what's amazing
[32:10] about these specific scriptures is that
[32:14] these were all written after he had made
[32:16] the mistakes that he made. Amen. This
[32:18] was written after all the slip ups and
[32:21] after all the human errors. I read this
[32:23] statement that struck me that was
[32:24] commenting on these verses. And it says
[32:26] that we tend to think that the power of
[32:28] faith depends upon us as if it were a
[32:31] feeling that we could conjure up for
[32:32] ourselves. But it has nothing to do with
[32:36] how we feel. Amen. I don't know about
[32:38] any of you here tonight, but I know that
[32:40] my feelings tend to get in my way a lot.
[32:42] Amen. Sometimes we go through ups and
[32:45] downs in our life and and those things
[32:46] can happen because we have human nature.
[32:49] But it doesn't matter how you feel. The
[32:51] promise is meant for you. Amen. You are
[32:54] heirs according to the promise because
[32:55] you believed in Jesus. Amen. But what
[32:59] the scripture is trying to get us to
[33:00] realize here is that that's not a part
[33:03] of the equation. So, you know, 25 years
[33:07] Abraham had to wait for that promise.
[33:09] And just to think about in his mind,
[33:11] there must have been a lot of times that
[33:13] the enemy would get him discouraged.
[33:15] There must have been a lot of times that
[33:17] he didn't feel worthy of that promise.
[33:20] And in waiting so long, I'm sure he had
[33:22] many thoughts that it may never happen.
[33:25] Amen. Because the thoughts are are going
[33:28] to come because that's what the devil
[33:30] does. Amen. The battleground is in the
[33:32] mind. So just because the thought is
[33:34] there, that doesn't mean it's got to
[33:35] manifest. Amen. And in waiting so long,
[33:38] I I know because I'm I'm a brother and I
[33:41] know that the devil came to fight him
[33:44] just as hard as he fights any of us.
[33:46] Amen. But in the midst of all that, he
[33:49] was fully persuaded that what God had
[33:52] promised, he was able to perform. Amen.
[33:56] Abraham's feelings never had anything to
[33:59] do with the promise.
[34:02] He made some mistakes along the way,
[34:04] too, you know, but what I what I love is
[34:06] that it never hindered the promise. And
[34:08] when it when it came time for the
[34:10] promise to be fulfilled, when when the
[34:12] Lord came to Abraham there in Genesis
[34:14] 17, something was going to take place
[34:17] that had actually never happened before.
[34:19] It was a change that was going to take
[34:21] place. And it was going to be more than
[34:23] just on the surface. This was going to
[34:25] be the start of a new covenant promise.
[34:27] This was going to be an identity shift
[34:30] for Abraham and for Sarah. Amen. And he
[34:33] he says, "No more shall you be called by
[34:35] your old name." The Bible said, "No more
[34:37] shall you be remembered by that old
[34:40] identity, for you will be a father of
[34:43] many nations, the father of faith." And
[34:45] you know what's cool about the scripture
[34:47] in Romans is that when you go and and
[34:49] and refer back to Abraham anytime in the
[34:51] New Testament, when it refers back to
[34:53] him, even when it refers back to the
[34:55] mistakes that he made, it never calls
[34:57] him Abram. Even when he made those
[35:00] mistakes, he was Abram. Amen. But he
[35:02] never referred back to him as Abram. He
[35:05] referred back to him as his new
[35:06] identity. Amen. Sometimes we get to
[35:09] places in our life where we make
[35:10] mistakes and the devil gets you looking
[35:12] in the past. But listen, my brother, my
[35:15] sister, your past doesn't matter. Your
[35:17] new identity is in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[35:20] And he sees you through the blood.
[35:22] Hallelujah. Even in Galatians when when
[35:25] it refers back to that mistake he made
[35:27] when when Ishmael was born of a bond
[35:29] woman. You know that mistake was made in
[35:32] Genesis 16 before his name was ever
[35:35] changed. But when the scripture refers
[35:38] back, it calls him Abraham. Amen.
[35:41] Because this was something that had
[35:42] never been never been accomplished
[35:44] because God was going to change. It was
[35:47] a it was a new covenant promise and he
[35:49] was going to change his identity. Amen.
[35:52] Aren't you glad you got a new identity
[35:54] tonight? Hallelujah.
[35:57] As many mistakes as we've made, as many
[35:59] poor choices as we've made, my identity
[36:02] is not in those things.
[36:05] It's not in the mistakes that I've made.
[36:07] It's not in my past sins. It's not in
[36:10] those things. It's in the new creature
[36:12] that Christ has made me. Even when I'm
[36:15] living now and I I fall and I slip up,
[36:19] my identity is not in those things. My
[36:22] identity is in Christ, the sacrificial
[36:25] lamb that he would died so that I
[36:27] wouldn't have sins imputed unto me.
[36:30] Hallelujah.
[36:33] Oh, you know, sometimes they just want
[36:34] to remind the devil of that, you know,
[36:37] because he likes to remind you of your
[36:39] past. I don't know if I'm just alone
[36:41] here tonight, but he sure does like to
[36:42] remind me of my past. He likes to take
[36:45] us down memory lane and bring up those
[36:48] things that we did back before we had an
[36:52] identity change.
[36:54] Oh, but 2 Corinthians says, "But if any
[36:56] man be in Christ, he's a new creature.
[36:59] Old things are passed away. Behold, all
[37:02] things are new." Oh, I'm thankful for a
[37:05] newness, a newness of life. You know,
[37:08] when he came to him and with that
[37:10] promise, there was a change that was
[37:12] going to take place. And it wasn't just
[37:13] an outward manifestation. It was
[37:16] something inward. It was going to change
[37:18] his the the the very identity of who he
[37:21] was and who he would be for all
[37:23] eternity. Hallelujah.
[37:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[37:29] know, I never noticed this point in
[37:31] scripture, but um Joy and I, we've been
[37:33] reading this book that we were gifted.
[37:34] It's it's about raising children with
[37:36] God being at the center, you know, even
[37:38] even in this godless society. And the
[37:41] writer makes this striking point about
[37:42] the Hebrew boys there in the book of
[37:44] Daniel. You know, when we when those
[37:46] boys were born, they were given names
[37:49] that we often don't refer to. Amen. They
[37:52] were given Haniah and Michelle and
[37:54] Aariah. And if you go and study those
[37:57] names in the Hebrew language, they had
[37:59] incredible meaning.
[38:01] Haniah meaning Yahweh is gracious.
[38:04] Mishel meaning who is what God is. And
[38:07] Azeriah meaning Yahweh has helped. So
[38:10] there was something in the name that
[38:11] they were given at birth, you know, and
[38:13] and in the book of Daniel during that
[38:16] time of the siege, I believe it was the
[38:17] first siege that took them away from
[38:19] their family and from their friends,
[38:21] from everything they knew, and they went
[38:23] to live in Babylon during this time of
[38:25] captivity. They were just young boys.
[38:27] Amen. Think of that today. They were
[38:29] just a a young boy, but something was
[38:32] ingrained within them from when they
[38:34] were just young children. something in
[38:36] their identity. Be even when they lived
[38:39] in a land full of idolatry, even when
[38:42] they were told to do certain things,
[38:43] there was something within them that
[38:45] could not do what the world wanted them
[38:48] to do because their identity was was
[38:50] placed in something firm. There was a
[38:52] firm foundation.
[38:54] And and one of the very first things
[38:56] that that that the Babylonian king did,
[39:00] you see what he did is he recognized
[39:02] their value. So he watched their
[39:04] character and he saw that there was
[39:06] something different about them,
[39:08] something that he knew would be an asset
[39:11] to the kingdom. Scripture says that they
[39:13] were 10 times uh better than all the
[39:16] wise men in the kingdom. But the devil
[39:19] always has a plan to pervert things.
[39:21] Amen. We know that the devil is not a
[39:24] creator. Amen. Which means that he has
[39:27] no originality. Sometimes I just want to
[39:29] take some jabs at him. He has no
[39:31] originality. Amen. He He's not a
[39:33] creator. You need me to use that?
[39:35] Amen.
[39:37] Praise the Lord.
[39:40] Okay. But when he sees something that
[39:43] works for the kingdom of God, Amen,
[39:45] saints of God, he tries to take that
[39:47] thing and he tries to pervert it. So
[39:51] what the devil did is he saw something
[39:54] that worked for God. I've just caught
[39:57] this point and it struck my heart. The
[40:00] devil watched. He's been a spectator
[40:02] throughout all history. And he began to
[40:04] watch. Amen.
[40:06] He began to watch down through history
[40:09] as when when God would do something, he
[40:12] would try to take whatever is whatever
[40:14] it was that he did and he tried to
[40:16] pervert it. He tried to maneuver it. He
[40:18] tried to twist it and use it for his own
[40:20] good. Amen. So way back in in in the
[40:23] channels of history, he watched how
[40:25] Abraham would become a new creature and
[40:28] and his name would be changed. So what
[40:31] happened is is when these Hebrew boys
[40:33] went there, he got this idea in his
[40:35] mind. You know, I'm going to whisper
[40:37] into the king of the Babyl of the
[40:39] Babylon army and I'm going to have them
[40:41] change their name because I want them to
[40:43] change their identity. He wanted to
[40:45] pervert what it was that they had in
[40:48] them. Hallelujah. Oh, saints of God. But
[40:51] it didn't matter how far into Babylon
[40:54] that they went. It didn't even matter
[40:56] what kind of identity on the outward
[40:58] appearance that they tried to to to take
[41:00] from them. They had something f an
[41:03] anchor foundation in which they never
[41:06] left that place.
[41:08] Amen.
[41:10] He recognized the devil would recognize
[41:12] that it was it was more than just a name
[41:14] change. He he watched how it was it was
[41:17] something more than that. He he knew he
[41:20] saw that it was a he he watched how
[41:22] people would now call him Abraham and
[41:24] and and he was referred to as something
[41:26] different than he's always been referred
[41:28] to. He watched how Sarai was now Sarah.
[41:31] He watched how Jacob was now Israel,
[41:34] which is an even more a bigger miracle.
[41:36] He watched this man who was who who was
[41:39] a shyer and had made all these mistakes.
[41:41] But there was a time that came in his
[41:43] life where he had a where he had a
[41:46] connection with God and something
[41:48] changed him. And God decided that this
[41:50] is a time that it's going to be more
[41:52] than just an outward change. I'm going
[41:54] to change your name, but it's going to
[41:56] change your identity.
[41:58] And so what did it do? What did he do?
[42:00] He tried to pervert that. He tried to
[42:02] take that name. He tried to take what
[42:05] their name meant and he tried to rip it
[42:07] from them.
[42:09] Amen.
[42:10] you know, your name, it's just it's it's
[42:12] a greater significance than just a few a
[42:14] few letters. Amen.
[42:16] You know, even after all the years of
[42:20] trying to discourage Abraham and
[42:22] dissuade him a and trying to get Sarah
[42:26] to doubt and to disbelieve. I can't
[42:29] imagine being the devil sometimes after
[42:31] he's done everything he's known how to
[42:33] do to you and to the family of God. He
[42:37] throws every weapon of warfare at you
[42:39] that he has. He discourages you. He
[42:41] torments you. He gives you mind battles.
[42:44] He says you're not a child of God. It
[42:46] goes further than that. You've got scars
[42:49] that he knows about that he works on. He
[42:51] He goes into the secret place because
[42:53] he's watched your life. Amen. So then he
[42:56] plants these things in your mind. Those
[42:57] mind battles. Oh, sometimes they're more
[42:59] than just surface level. And a lot of
[43:01] times when the Lord is trying to deal
[43:03] with those things, it's not just the
[43:05] snap of a finger, friends, sometimes God
[43:08] has to go into intricate places in your
[43:10] spirit to go and put a a stab down on
[43:13] your spirit to be able to get you to a
[43:14] place. Hallelujah. Where where you can
[43:17] be healed of what you need healed from.
[43:20] Oh, saints of God. Hallelujah. He
[43:24] torments you and he causes you to slip
[43:26] up and he causes you to make mistakes
[43:28] and he gives you these mind battles and
[43:30] and he tries to tell you that the
[43:31] promise isn't for you. I can't imagine
[43:34] how many times that thought had to go
[43:36] through Abraham's mind. The promise
[43:38] isn't for you. It's been years and
[43:40] years. Why are you even waiting anymore?
[43:43] Why? You're not even a child of God.
[43:47] Can you think about the mind battles
[43:49] that it took 25 years?
[43:52] Yet he spectates and he watches God
[43:56] manifest the promise in his life.
[44:00] And he does the same thing to you and I
[44:02] today. Hallelujah. He watches you. He
[44:05] watches you come into contact with God.
[44:08] And he watches that there's a nature
[44:10] change. He watches that there's
[44:12] something that takes place on the inside
[44:14] of your spirit and in your soul where
[44:16] where you go from being a no good sinner
[44:19] to to somehow you have now have a desire
[44:22] to serve God. You have a desire to be
[44:24] more than what you used to be and I know
[44:27] you're going to slip up and I know
[44:28] you're going to make mistakes but the
[44:30] desire is still there. Hallelujah.
[44:34] Thank you. Thank you God. How
[44:37] discouraging that would be for the
[44:39] devil.
[44:42] But he watched and he and he saw
[44:44] something that worked and and he watched
[44:47] how right right at the threshold of the
[44:50] manifestation right there in Genesis 17,
[44:53] he saw that God right before it would
[44:56] happen would change their name.
[44:59] In Jacob's life, you know, he was a
[45:01] spectator, like I said, through every
[45:02] mistake that he made. Yet God still
[45:05] chose to change his identity from who he
[45:09] was to who he would always be.
[45:12] Thank you, Lord, for that. Thank you for
[45:15] changing me from the vile wretch that I
[45:17] was and not seeing that person anymore.
[45:20] I know that I still see that person. I
[45:22] know that my mind has mind battles about
[45:24] that person. But that is not who Christ
[45:27] sees.
[45:28] Hallelujah.
[45:30] He sees who we are,
[45:32] not who we used to be.
[45:36] Hallelujah. He saw how he walked
[45:38] different. Something something has
[45:40] changed, you know. And the devil
[45:45] the devil knows when
[45:49] something is genuine.
[45:51] He He watches your life. He sees He sees
[45:56] when something is different about you.
[45:58] when when you became a new creature in
[46:00] Christ, he he's watched it. He's done
[46:03] this a time or two. He's watched it down
[46:05] through history. He's seen every
[46:07] believer that's crossed from death unto
[46:09] life. He's witness this this
[46:11] supernatural event take place, and he
[46:13] desperately does everything he can to
[46:16] try to stop it. Amen. He fights it at
[46:18] every turn,
[46:20] you know. So when when those Hebrew boys
[46:22] came in to captivity under that first
[46:25] siege, the devil, I believe this, he saw
[46:29] this opportunity. He thought, man, these
[46:31] boys with their wisdom and with their
[46:33] gifts,
[46:34] if he could just get them to change the
[46:37] way that God got Abraham to change or
[46:40] that he got Jacob to change, he tried to
[46:43] steal what God had done. and he crafted
[46:45] this plan and he whispered into the
[46:47] thoughts there of the unic that that the
[46:49] king had told to change their name. He
[46:52] said, "I've got a plan. I've watched
[46:54] I've watched this done and now I'm going
[46:57] to go ahead and I'm going to try it for
[46:58] myself."
[47:01] You know, with those new names that were
[47:03] given to those Hebrew boys. We're
[47:05] familiar Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo.
[47:07] Those Babylonian names paid tribute to
[47:10] the false gods that they were worshiping
[47:13] there in Babylon. Shadrach means the
[47:16] command of Aku, which was the moon god.
[47:18] And Mach meant who is what? Aku is the
[47:21] moon god. And Abindo means the servant
[47:24] of Nebo. You see what happened was is
[47:26] the devil tried to rewrite their future
[47:29] in the wrong direction. He wanted to
[47:31] steal away their identity. So he gave
[47:33] them these names that were associated
[47:36] attributed to pagan worship to to
[47:38] somehow try and and change the framework
[47:41] of who they were. But it was never going
[47:43] to work because these boys were anchored
[47:46] to something real and something genuine.
[47:50] Oh, I'm thankful that I'm anchored to
[47:52] something real and to something genuine
[47:54] and that when something happens in my
[47:56] life that may be shaking that it doesn't
[47:58] matter because my firm foundation goes
[48:01] beyond any kind of shaking that would
[48:03] happen.
[48:07] The identity that God gives you far
[48:11] outweighs any label that the devil tries
[48:14] to manufacture in your life. Amen.
[48:18] I want to say that that point again
[48:20] because this struck my heart. The
[48:21] identity that God gives you far
[48:24] outweighs any label that the devil tries
[48:26] to give you
[48:28] because what can happen many times is is
[48:30] that maybe we have a condition in our
[48:32] life that we're dealing with. Maybe we
[48:34] have a sickness. Maybe we have a past.
[48:36] Whatever it is,
[48:37] then what happens is is that's that's an
[48:39] enemy that's coming in into your mind.
[48:42] And and then it's not just the
[48:44] condition. It's the mind battles that
[48:46] are associated with the condition.
[48:49] And what begins to happen is is that you
[48:52] can become so shackled to now this label
[48:55] that you have and it becomes a part of
[48:57] your identity.
[48:59] Amen.
[49:01] But what God wants us to to to step out
[49:04] of is and realize is that that is not
[49:06] our identity. We may be shackled to
[49:08] these bodies here on earth, but I've got
[49:11] an anchor in something that's not in
[49:13] this earth.
[49:15] Hallelujah. And just because the devil
[49:17] tries to put some kind of label in my
[49:19] life, that doesn't mean not only it
[49:21] doesn't mean that that I have to live
[49:22] with it. You don't have to live with it.
[49:24] There is a God that can heal your
[49:26] diseases. He can heal the intricate
[49:28] places in your spirit, in your mind. You
[49:30] you don't you may not know how to deal
[49:32] with it, but God knows how to deal with
[49:34] it. Thanks be to God. You you you may
[49:37] come up to a situation that you do not
[49:40] understand, that you do not know how to
[49:41] deal with, but God knows how to deal
[49:43] with it. Amen. And he wants to deal with
[49:45] it. Amen. These are matters of the
[49:47] heart. And God deals with matters of the
[49:49] heart. Amen. Amen. I believe that with
[49:52] all my heart, you know, you may re you
[49:54] may come to a situation where you have a
[49:56] trial in your life, saints of God. You
[49:59] may come to a place where there's a
[50:00] fiery trial like those boys did.
[50:03] Amen. And something can happen. And what
[50:05] what can happen is is not every time in
[50:08] our lives I not every time it goes the
[50:12] way that we think that it should go.
[50:14] Amen. But our trust is in what they said
[50:17] was which was nevertheless.
[50:20] It was a nevertheless if if I believe
[50:23] that God can save me from this and I and
[50:26] that's where my trust is and I know and
[50:28] I've seen him do it. But nevertheless,
[50:30] if he doesn't if I if he so chooses a
[50:33] different path for me, my anchor is
[50:35] placed in that. Amen. But I want to deal
[50:38] with something a little bit further than
[50:39] that. Because what can happen in our
[50:41] minds if we don't deal with that thing,
[50:43] then we begin to start to question
[50:45] things. We begin to start not
[50:47] understanding. And then it begins to
[50:48] seep into your prayer life. It begins to
[50:50] seep into your to to every part of your
[50:53] being as a father, as a parent, as a as
[50:56] a husband, as a brother, as a sister, as
[50:58] a Christian. It be it could begin to
[50:59] seep into your spirit if you don't let
[51:01] the Lord deal with that thing.
[51:04] Hallelujah.
[51:06] You have to let the Lord come in and be
[51:08] the the one who who who takes those
[51:11] things. You have to be willing to
[51:13] surrender it. You have to be willing to
[51:15] open your heart up to it first. You have
[51:18] to be willing to recognize that I've got
[51:20] this and I need the Lord to be able I
[51:22] need the Lord to touch it. I I I I don't
[51:25] know what to do with it, Lord. I don't
[51:27] know where to go with it, but I know you
[51:28] do, Lord.
[51:30] And I don't want my identity to be
[51:32] placed in that thing. And I know that
[51:34] it's a label that the devil tries to put
[51:36] mind battles. He tries to put it can
[51:38] hinder your prayer life. It can hinder
[51:40] all kinds of things. But it doesn't have
[51:42] to stay that way. Hallelujah.
[51:45] Oh, you can rise above that thing.
[51:47] Thanks be to God.
[51:51] He tries to destroy your life. He gets
[51:54] you to He He tries to get you to
[51:57] identify less with God and more with the
[52:00] idols of the world. That's why we have
[52:03] more entertainment now than we've ever
[52:05] had. That's why we have more access to
[52:07] that garbage than we've ever had. It's
[52:10] it's there there's more now. You know,
[52:13] in the times that they had, there was a
[52:15] lot then, but now because there's such a
[52:18] an an instant access to it. It's now
[52:21] more than ever bombarding your mind.
[52:24] Amen.
[52:25] More access to perversion than ever
[52:27] before.
[52:29] But these Hebrew boys never let that
[52:31] name a the name change affect their
[52:34] stand. As far into spiritual Babylon, I
[52:38] mean, they were far into Babylon. They
[52:41] were they weren't just siege. They
[52:43] weren't just a part of the captivity
[52:44] anymore. They had been brought into the
[52:47] king's house. They had been made a part
[52:50] of the kingdom. They had been set above
[52:53] all of the other officers. There was
[52:55] something about them that was different
[52:57] and they were rising in the ranks. They
[52:59] had access to all of these things. But
[53:02] you know, you go and read that story and
[53:04] even when I'm going to get to this in my
[53:07] notes, but even when you there's places
[53:10] where I I read this commentary and it
[53:13] began to deal with that story and it
[53:14] began to deal with how those Hebrew boys
[53:17] could have made justifications
[53:20] for eating the king's meat and drinking
[53:22] the wine. They were living in a foreign
[53:24] land. And what struck my heart on that
[53:26] is is that the enemy can come in our
[53:29] mind and start to give you every kind of
[53:31] justification that you want to have for
[53:34] whatever it is, whatever excuse,
[53:35] whatever it is that you're that you're
[53:37] that's going on in your life. You can
[53:39] have every kind of justification, but I
[53:41] don't want to live my life with excuses.
[53:44] I don't want to be in that place. If I'm
[53:46] having if I'm having a situation, I want
[53:48] to be able to humble myself and say,
[53:50] "Lord, I need you to deal with me on
[53:53] this. I'm not some great big strong man,
[53:55] Lord. I'm a weak man who's got God
[53:58] behind him. And I know God is strong.
[54:00] Hallelujah.
[54:02] Thanks be to God. And these boys, they
[54:05] had they chose to make a stand on what
[54:08] they believed, even if it mean even if
[54:11] it meant something hard to do. Amen.
[54:13] Sometimes when when we when we live in
[54:17] the world and you know sometimes there's
[54:18] this there's this
[54:21] there there's this uh pull to want to
[54:23] blend in. Blend blend in a little. I
[54:26] mean you know you're you may be you may
[54:28] not look as bad as the world does.
[54:32] Amen. You may it may not you may not
[54:34] you're still modest. You know it's maybe
[54:36] maybe not maybe not as modest as as it
[54:38] as the Lord wants it to be but it's
[54:40] definitely better than the world. Those
[54:42] are justifications
[54:44] that I don't want to live in. Amen.
[54:47] Entertainment. Well, it's not I mean,
[54:49] it's just it's not that bad. It's not
[54:51] that big of a deal.
[54:53] Amen. I don't want to live in that place
[54:56] where I can have find an excuse for
[54:58] everything that that I want to do and
[55:00] that I can do. I want to live in a place
[55:02] where I'm soaring in the atmospheres
[55:05] with God. I want to live in a place
[55:07] where if I do fall, then I know that I
[55:11] can go somewhere and he can pick me back
[55:13] up again.
[55:14] Because what can happen many times is if
[55:16] you fall there and if you never go back
[55:19] to the place that you fell. Amen. Then
[55:21] then there's this broken there's this
[55:23] broken path that you're walking on. You
[55:25] need to go back to that place. You need
[55:27] to let the Lord deal with that thing.
[55:30] Thanks be to God. You keep your feet
[55:33] anchored to the name that God gave you.
[55:37] God gave you a name.
[55:40] He gave you He gave you a promise
[55:43] and he sealed you with that promise.
[55:45] Amen. What the enemy tries to get us to
[55:48] do
[55:49] is make a choice
[55:53] in the wrong direction.
[55:56] One point that the writer makes in this
[55:59] book is that these young men had learned
[56:02] a powerful lesson at an early age and
[56:05] was with and it was that they they must
[56:08] do God's work in this world God's way.
[56:13] And that struck me because sometimes we
[56:15] can try to do God's work maybe our way
[56:20] and that is not what they did and that
[56:24] is not the intention. We are to do God's
[56:26] work his way.
[56:30] That that lesson struck me. We can't
[56:32] ever let the influence of the world
[56:35] cause us to compromise on God's on God's
[56:39] word. They could have they could have
[56:41] made every excuse for drinking wine, but
[56:45] they they made a choice.
[56:48] They didn't want their identity to
[56:51] resemble the world at all.
[56:54] Amen.
[56:55] Sometimes I believe that that the enemy
[56:57] can can bring mind battles on our mind
[56:59] and like I say, just it it just makes
[57:01] you it somehow it it's a negative thing
[57:04] to to want to stand out from the rest of
[57:07] the world. But we are called to stand
[57:10] out. We are called to be separate. When
[57:13] you go and read about Abraham and about
[57:15] Lot, the promise could not happen in
[57:18] Abraham's life. The promise happened in
[57:20] Genesis 17. Lot and Abraham had to
[57:23] separate in Genesis 13. So the promise
[57:26] could not manifest in his life until the
[57:29] separation took place. Amen. And I don't
[57:32] want to live in a place where Lot lived.
[57:34] Oh, I did the Sunday school a few weeks
[57:35] ago. Lot made some choices in his life.
[57:38] Amen. Lot made some pretty pretty poor
[57:41] decisions in his life. And one of the
[57:43] first decisions he made was that he
[57:45] looked up towards Sodom.
[57:47] Amen. And and brother Brandham, this is
[57:49] in my notes somewhere. Brother Brandham
[57:51] comes to this point in a quote and he
[57:53] and he begins to catch Lot's heart on
[57:55] this. He didn't know he was going to
[57:58] backslide
[57:59] when he looked towards Sodom.
[58:02] And how many times did he have it in his
[58:06] mind? Maybe a thought crossed his mind
[58:08] while he was in Sodom that maybe I
[58:10] shouldn't be there. Maybe maybe this
[58:12] place isn't where I should be.
[58:15] Amen.
[58:17] All the mornings that he might have
[58:19] woken up and and realized that his wife,
[58:23] her heart was just not in the right
[58:25] place anymore. Something was different
[58:28] about her.
[58:30] He made these choices and the choices
[58:33] that he made affected more than just
[58:37] him.
[58:38] His choices affected his entire family
[58:41] for the rest of their lives. And the
[58:43] choice that he made to go into Sodom and
[58:46] even worse to stay there because what we
[58:49] have is as an example. If you are a lot
[58:52] and if you do have a justification or if
[58:54] you do have something in your life, you
[58:56] have a choice. You have a chance now to
[58:59] say that I don't want to stay here
[59:01] anymore.
[59:03] Oh, I'm thankful to God that we still
[59:06] have a choice to to say I don't want to
[59:08] be in this place. Because what began to
[59:11] happen is once the angels, you know, it
[59:14] was only because Abraham said, "No,
[59:16] Lord, please don't let let let let my
[59:19] family live." And the angels went down
[59:21] in that city and they warned Lot. in-law
[59:24] basically had to drag his family out of
[59:26] that place
[59:28] and his wife was never able to leave
[59:30] there. Her heart never left that place.
[59:34] And it was because of a choice that he
[59:36] made.
[59:37] Think about it. Think about it. It
[59:39] wasn't just one monumental choice. It
[59:42] was a series of small choices that that
[59:44] that that continued to to to compound on
[59:48] upon each other. And finally, they they
[59:50] went to a place where where the I mean,
[59:54] this was the end. And and I mean, you
[59:57] you know the rest of his story, his lot
[59:59] Lot's daughters, and you know, they
[1:00:01] became the enemies of Israel, their
[1:00:03] descendants, and it was just it's just a
[1:00:04] horrible story.
[1:00:10] You know, we just passed by
[1:00:13] we just passed by Easter and in in the
[1:00:16] lesson this past Sunday I had, I was
[1:00:17] talking about the sacrifice that that
[1:00:21] the second Adam made for us. You know,
[1:00:24] if you go back in in back in the Old
[1:00:26] Testament law when an animal was brought
[1:00:28] to be sacrificed for the atonement of
[1:00:30] the sin, the Bible talks about how the
[1:00:32] priests, they would lay their hand upon
[1:00:34] the head of the sacrifice
[1:00:36] and it was Amen. It was that transfer.
[1:00:38] But we showed how that it was more than
[1:00:41] just just a a mere contact with the
[1:00:44] sacrifice. It was more than just laying
[1:00:48] your hand on the surface of this animal.
[1:00:51] It was it was more than just surface
[1:00:54] level identification.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] The Hebrew word there that was used to
[1:01:01] express laying the hand upon was this
[1:01:04] word saw saw I think and it meant it
[1:01:08] meant more than just touching. It more
[1:01:11] it meant more than just contact. It
[1:01:14] meant that you would lean heavily into
[1:01:19] the sacrifice. meaning that you were
[1:01:22] identifying yourself with the sacrifice.
[1:01:27] It was more than just you making contact
[1:01:30] with a God that's living in a in a
[1:01:32] foreign place.
[1:01:34] Oh my saints of God, when you come into
[1:01:37] contact with God, let me just express
[1:01:39] this to you from my heart. I I I bid
[1:01:42] you, you need to lean heavily into him.
[1:01:45] You you need to recognize that this was
[1:01:47] more than just a mere sacrifice. This is
[1:01:50] the transfer of every wrong thing that
[1:01:54] you've ever done. Every wrong the the
[1:01:57] willfully wrong sin that you committed
[1:02:00] was now being laid upon the head was now
[1:02:04] being laid upon this sacrificial lamb.
[1:02:07] And it was more than just a surface
[1:02:09] level religion. And I'm afraid that
[1:02:10] that's what's wrong with a lot of the
[1:02:12] world is they find themselves with a
[1:02:14] surface level religion. And as a
[1:02:16] believer, I don't want to have a surface
[1:02:18] level religion where I come into contact
[1:02:20] with God because I go to a church that
[1:02:23] believes the word and I and I hear I
[1:02:25] hear the word, but I never make it
[1:02:27] something that I've identified with. You
[1:02:30] need to make that sacrifice a part of
[1:02:32] your identity. Amen.
[1:02:34] It has to be an identification that you
[1:02:37] are transferring your sin upon this
[1:02:41] innocent sacrifice.
[1:02:44] Hallelujah.
[1:02:50] That's that's what I'm afraid is is that
[1:02:52] they've never fully identified with
[1:02:55] their sacrifice. They've never had a
[1:02:58] revelation of what of the depths of what
[1:03:00] Jesus really did to atone for their
[1:03:05] sins. Something significant takes place.
[1:03:07] It it's a clear it's a clear change
[1:03:11] within you when we come to Christ. when
[1:03:14] he changes our name, when he changes our
[1:03:16] nature. And one thing that you can do
[1:03:20] is is that you can lean heavily into
[1:03:22] your redeemer with guilt and with shame.
[1:03:26] And one thing that you need to always
[1:03:29] remember because this is just a way of
[1:03:31] remembrance tonight. One thing you have
[1:03:33] to remember always is that it's a it's
[1:03:36] he's still on he's still on the altar.
[1:03:38] It's still a sacrifice. you still lean
[1:03:40] into them
[1:03:42] because we still are making mistakes.
[1:03:44] We're I hope we're not willfully
[1:03:46] sinning.
[1:03:46] I know. But sometimes we make mistakes
[1:03:49] and we still need we still need that
[1:03:52] advocate.
[1:03:54] And when you have that thing that you
[1:03:56] might deal with, he's still there.
[1:04:00] It's all encompassing. I It's all It's
[1:04:03] all encap It's all encapsulated in that.
[1:04:05] Every redemptive promise is in Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ. and it's still there for you and
[1:04:10] I. Thanks be to God.
[1:04:13] Amen.
[1:04:14] I want to look into the mirror of God's
[1:04:17] word and be able to identify myself the
[1:04:21] same way that those Hebrew boys did.
[1:04:24] That's who we ought to identify with
[1:04:26] tonight. Amen.
[1:04:28] No matter what chains of circumstance,
[1:04:31] you know, come my way. If even if even
[1:04:33] if you find yourself in a furnace filled
[1:04:35] with fire and it sometimes can feel like
[1:04:39] we are I know physically we probably
[1:04:41] will never be in a furnace of fire but
[1:04:43] spiritually you are you are bombarded by
[1:04:46] mind battles all the time.
[1:04:49] You are you are there is a constant
[1:04:51] barrage on you because you're a special
[1:04:54] target that the enemy has in place.
[1:04:59] It's the trying of our faith. Amen.
[1:05:03] James 1:3 says,
[1:05:06] "The trying of our faith workketh
[1:05:10] patience,
[1:05:12] but let patience have her perfect work."
[1:05:17] Even as believers, this has just been
[1:05:19] dealing with my heart the last couple of
[1:05:22] weeks. Even as believers,
[1:05:24] born again, spirit of God, our faith is
[1:05:27] tried and tested. And sometimes when
[1:05:30] you're going through something, a trial,
[1:05:32] it's a working that's happening. And
[1:05:35] like I said earlier, it's not always
[1:05:38] from here to here, the snap of a finger.
[1:05:41] You have to let patience have her
[1:05:44] perfect work. You'll find out, you know,
[1:05:46] the longer I I'm be I'm a Christian, the
[1:05:49] the longer I the the more I understand
[1:05:50] that you're going to face situations
[1:05:52] that are tough to to to fully grasp. And
[1:05:56] the enemy has a way during those times
[1:05:59] to work on your mind and get you to try
[1:06:03] to doubt and get you to try to question.
[1:06:06] But but remember, saints of God,
[1:06:08] remember, you need to have patience.
[1:06:12] There's patience in it. It's having a
[1:06:14] perfect work in your life. You have an
[1:06:17] anchor that you're holding to. And just
[1:06:20] because a mind battle has come in your
[1:06:22] life, Amen. does not it will not
[1:06:25] manifest. Amen. We will not allow it
[1:06:28] allow it to manifest because we are
[1:06:30] heirs of the promise. Amen. And we take
[1:06:32] those things captive and we recognize
[1:06:35] that in our weaknesses he is made
[1:06:38] strong.
[1:06:39] Thanks be to God. And God God will get
[1:06:43] you through it. It may not be today
[1:06:45] though. It may not be tomorrow. But God
[1:06:48] will get you through it. Amen. And
[1:06:50] thanks be to God, you will come out on
[1:06:53] the other side stronger than you were
[1:06:56] before.
[1:06:58] Thanks be to God.
[1:07:00] But in the process, there will there
[1:07:02] will be difficulties. The enemy, he's
[1:07:04] going to deploy every det every tactic
[1:07:06] in the in the arsenal.
[1:07:09] If you have the um my do you have the
[1:07:12] slideshow? You go ahead and pull pull up
[1:07:15] uh slide two. Brother Brandham says,
[1:07:17] "You see, when a man or person has
[1:07:19] really once come has once really come
[1:07:21] into contact with God, with that genuine
[1:07:25] revealed faith that is God, that that uh
[1:07:28] that God is, there's nothing, no time,
[1:07:31] nowhere can separate that man from his
[1:07:35] God."
[1:07:36] I believe it was Paul said there's no
[1:07:38] strife, no hunger, no perils, neither
[1:07:40] living creatures or death or anything
[1:07:42] that can separate us from the love of
[1:07:44] God which is in Christ Jesus. You are
[1:07:47] securely anchored in him because you
[1:07:50] were ordained to life.
[1:07:54] But Satan thought that he could twist
[1:07:57] him around a little bit and cuff him off
[1:07:59] and make him do it. So you see Job with
[1:08:02] his perfect revelation of God and who
[1:08:05] God was and how God loved him. He waited
[1:08:08] no matter what the circumstance was. He
[1:08:10] waited for his faith to be confirmed
[1:08:13] because catch this because he had a grip
[1:08:16] on God which was a revelation. Brother
[1:08:19] Brandham says he had a grip a revelation
[1:08:22] from God.
[1:08:26] The next The next quote is, "If the
[1:08:28] devil ain't after you," this this
[1:08:30] actually I saw this a few months ago and
[1:08:33] this it really spoke. He said, "If the
[1:08:35] devil ain't got you," this is just some
[1:08:37] encouragement tonight. If the devil
[1:08:38] ain't if the devil ain't after you, he's
[1:08:40] got you.
[1:08:41] That's all. Because as long as he's
[1:08:43] after you, that's a sign that he hasn't
[1:08:45] got you.
[1:08:47] Let me say that again. If he I
[1:08:51] as long as he's after you, that's a sign
[1:08:54] that he hasn't got you yet.
[1:08:56] But if he isn't after you, it's a sign
[1:08:58] that he's probably got you. So just
[1:09:00] remember, as long as he's blasting at
[1:09:02] you, you are a few jumps ahead of him
[1:09:06] yet.
[1:09:07] Just keep going.
[1:09:09] Sometimes it's just as much if you don't
[1:09:10] get anything out of this tonight, it's
[1:09:12] just as much as put one foot in front of
[1:09:14] the other and keep going. Because if
[1:09:17] he's battling you, then he hasn't got
[1:09:19] you. Amen. The devil's intentions in the
[1:09:22] fire in your life is to get you to doubt
[1:09:27] God's presence in your life, get you to
[1:09:30] doubt your identity in Christ, and get
[1:09:32] you just to question everything. Brother
[1:09:33] Benham, in this next, actually, I don't
[1:09:35] have this. You can just uh pause it for
[1:09:38] a second. Um I don't have this because
[1:09:40] I'm going to make some uh comments as I
[1:09:41] go. Brother Benham says this in in uh he
[1:09:44] says this in the sermon the hour has
[1:09:46] come. He said he says that one time the
[1:09:50] Hebrew children when they were carried
[1:09:52] over in Babylon listen the time came
[1:09:56] when they had to stand for what was
[1:09:58] right. The king made a proclamation and
[1:10:00] he said that whosoever will not bow to
[1:10:02] this image will be shall be thrown in
[1:10:04] the fiery furnace. So the time came for
[1:10:06] Shadrach, Meshach and Abedneo to show
[1:10:08] their colors, their faith in God. So
[1:10:10] they turned back to the image, turned
[1:10:12] their back to the image, and they said,
[1:10:14] "Our God is able to deliver us from this
[1:10:17] fiery furnace, but nevertheless,
[1:10:20] nevertheless, we will not bow to any of
[1:10:22] their images." There it was. It was
[1:10:25] time, the season was there. So then the
[1:10:28] time came that he was going to throw
[1:10:30] them into the fiery furnace and burn
[1:10:33] that religion out of them. He gets so
[1:10:36] mad. the devil gets so mad at you and at
[1:10:39] any of God's children when you stand on
[1:10:42] God's word and and let me just tell you
[1:10:44] tonight if if the devil could throw you
[1:10:47] in a furnace of fire, he probably would
[1:10:49] do it. Amen.
[1:10:50] He tried to do that to the Hebrew boys
[1:10:52] and he's trying to do it to many of us
[1:10:54] here tonight with the battles that we're
[1:10:56] facing.
[1:10:57] But just like them, I choose to stand on
[1:11:00] the word. Amen.
[1:11:02] Brother Benham says like this. He said,
[1:11:03] listen close now. says that's what the
[1:11:05] devil tries to do all the time is burn
[1:11:08] you up on something and make you sicker
[1:11:10] when you're prayed for it, make you
[1:11:12] think you've lost your experience with
[1:11:14] God. He's lying to you.
[1:11:18] He's lying to you. I know that the mind
[1:11:20] battles come and I know that it can feel
[1:11:22] like you're burning up inside like the
[1:11:24] prophet says that that maybe you that
[1:11:26] you feel like you've lost your
[1:11:28] experience with God. Maybe it feels like
[1:11:30] you'll never make it on the other side
[1:11:31] of this trial. But let me just say
[1:11:33] something that the prophet said. He's
[1:11:35] lying to you.
[1:11:37] Oh, I know. Sometimes when you're just
[1:11:39] in the midst of something, it feels like
[1:11:41] you're never going to get on the other
[1:11:42] side. It feels like I'm never going to
[1:11:43] make it out of this furnace. Feels like
[1:11:46] I'm never going to overcome this thing
[1:11:47] or I'll never see the other side. But
[1:11:50] let me just encourage you tonight. Don't
[1:11:52] stop standing. Amen.
[1:11:55] The prophet says the time comes when you
[1:11:58] have to stand on God's word. stand alone
[1:12:02] and but when the time comes, stand
[1:12:03] there. And listen, this is powerful.
[1:12:05] This is th this is probably where the
[1:12:07] inspiration came from tonight. There's
[1:12:09] got to be a time when you've got to
[1:12:11] separate yourself
[1:12:13] between your feelings and your faith.
[1:12:17] Let me say that again tonight. There's
[1:12:19] got to be a time where you separate your
[1:12:22] feelings from your faith. And guess
[1:12:25] what, saints of God? That time is
[1:12:27] tonight. Amen. Oh, I'm sure Abraham sure
[1:12:30] didn't feel like it was time after all
[1:12:32] this time of waiting, but it was time
[1:12:34] for that promise to manifest. I'm sure
[1:12:36] it sure didn't feel like Jacob like it
[1:12:39] was time, but it was time for that
[1:12:40] promise to manifest. Maybe if maybe it
[1:12:43] doesn't feel like it's time, but it's
[1:12:45] time for that thing to manifest. Amen.
[1:12:48] And you've got to be able to separate
[1:12:50] yourself, your feelings from your faith.
[1:12:54] They are independent of each other. They
[1:12:58] are separate from each other because my
[1:13:00] feelings can get me feeling way down in
[1:13:03] the dump sometimes. My feelings can lead
[1:13:05] me astray, but my faith is anchored to
[1:13:08] one thing that will never move.
[1:13:11] Hallelujah.
[1:13:14] There's a lot of times that my feelings
[1:13:16] have failed me.
[1:13:18] I don't believe I'm alone tonight.
[1:13:20] But the dividing line is a choice. Amen.
[1:13:25] when he separated from Lot,
[1:13:32] he thought he could do certain things
[1:13:35] but maintain his religion. Brother Bham
[1:13:38] says that think of that the prophet of
[1:13:41] God, he caught his mind in the matter.
[1:13:44] And it's the it's the same thought can
[1:13:47] can that can run through a believer's
[1:13:49] mind. You say, "I'm a believer in God.
[1:13:52] I I I I go to church, but I'll be okay
[1:13:56] if I go and and kind of do what I want
[1:13:58] to do. I'll be okay if I dabble a little
[1:14:02] bit in in the world. I'll be okay. I'm a
[1:14:04] believer. I'll be I'll be okay because I
[1:14:07] I'm a believer.
[1:14:11] I can compromise maybe a little bit in
[1:14:13] this area. I I I you know, I I could I
[1:14:15] could justify eating a little bit of the
[1:14:17] king's meat. I I I could justify eating
[1:14:19] I mean, I'm in the foreign land. I I'd
[1:14:21] die otherwise, right? I I die. Why? Why
[1:14:24] wouldn't I just I mean, I'll just do it
[1:14:26] just a little bit.
[1:14:30] Don't find yourself living with lots
[1:14:34] argument.
[1:14:35] Saying that, saying, "I'm a believer,
[1:14:37] but I can still somehow leave part of
[1:14:40] myself open to the world.
[1:14:43] I can still hold on to things in my
[1:14:45] life." compromises. Even further than
[1:14:48] that, bitterness.
[1:14:52] I I I didn't have this. I didn't didn't
[1:14:55] think I was going to put it in my nose.
[1:14:56] The Lord just tell me to go this way.
[1:14:57] You know, when you go and read about
[1:15:01] Saul, about uh Mikall in in the Old
[1:15:05] Testament,
[1:15:07] when it refers to her when she laughed
[1:15:10] at David, it refers to her as MC. I
[1:15:15] believe it was McCall, right? It refers
[1:15:17] to her as McCall, daughter of Saul.
[1:15:21] And she had this this root in her
[1:15:25] something in her that she never dealt
[1:15:29] with.
[1:15:31] She never dealt with that thing. And it
[1:15:33] was recognized because
[1:15:36] her name wasn't MCL, wife of David. She
[1:15:41] had the opportunity and the choice to be
[1:15:44] identified with the greatest king that
[1:15:47] was ever that was ever lived besides
[1:15:50] Jesus.
[1:15:51] Amen.
[1:15:52] She had the opportunity, but there was
[1:15:54] something in her heart and she chose to
[1:15:57] stay identified with Saul because it
[1:15:59] said McCall daughter of Saul laughed and
[1:16:03] and mocked David at what he did. And
[1:16:05] then if you go back and read because it
[1:16:07] was never dealt with, she never had a
[1:16:10] child. She never bore children because
[1:16:12] of something that was never dealt with
[1:16:14] in her life. Don't live in a place where
[1:16:17] you keep something so locked up and you
[1:16:19] never let the Lord deal with it because
[1:16:21] where you left God is where he'll be.
[1:16:24] You need to go back to that place and
[1:16:26] deal with that thing. Don't be
[1:16:28] identified with Saul. Don't be
[1:16:30] identified with some mistake. Don't be
[1:16:32] because those things are going to come
[1:16:34] that the resent bitterness those things
[1:16:36] do come. But don't let it have a grip on
[1:16:38] you. But the only grip that you have be
[1:16:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ in you
[1:16:44] personally.
[1:16:46] Thanks be to God. Think of the
[1:16:49] consequences.
[1:16:52] He says it wasn't long when Lot seen the
[1:16:55] big city. He didn't he didn't see
[1:16:57] Brother Man says this in straight as the
[1:16:59] gate. He didn't see his wife turning to
[1:17:02] a pillar of salt.
[1:17:06] He didn't see he didn't see the fire
[1:17:09] burning up in the city.
[1:17:12] But Abraham took the way with the Lord's
[1:17:15] despised few. He stayed in the desert.
[1:17:18] He didn't Lot didn't perceive that it
[1:17:20] was because of a choice that he made
[1:17:23] that his wife's heart would never be
[1:17:25] able to leave that place. I made this
[1:17:26] point in the Sunday school, but I can
[1:17:29] just imagine that the rest of his life,
[1:17:32] he had thoughts going through his mind
[1:17:34] about how he wishes that he could go
[1:17:36] back to a place where he could have left
[1:17:38] that place before his wife's heart was
[1:17:42] stuck there forever.
[1:17:46] Sometimes we don't realize choices that
[1:17:49] we make have a long-term effect in our
[1:17:53] life.
[1:17:55] And they don't just affect us. Amen.
[1:17:59] I thought about Samson uh last night. Uh
[1:18:04] brother Brenham makes this powerful
[1:18:05] statement we're probably familiar with
[1:18:08] when he preaches, "Oh Lord, just once
[1:18:09] more."
[1:18:11] He says, this isn't in the slides
[1:18:13] either. I think I only got one more in
[1:18:14] the slides.
[1:18:17] He says, "Now when we see Samson
[1:18:19] standing there, how he is thinking of
[1:18:21] the things that he once did with the
[1:18:24] kingdom of God and how he had how God
[1:18:27] how he had failed God and how he had
[1:18:30] failed God's people. Yes, sir. Now he is
[1:18:34] a prisoner of the very nation that God
[1:18:39] raised him up to destroy." Amen.
[1:18:43] God has raised us up to be overcomers in
[1:18:47] the evil day. He raised us up to stand
[1:18:49] on his word. He placed within us an
[1:18:52] identity uh with his word, with his
[1:18:55] promise. He sealed us. It says that we
[1:18:58] are to be more than conquerors through
[1:19:00] Christ Jesus. And yet many times the
[1:19:03] very thing that was raised up for you to
[1:19:07] destroy has now become something that is
[1:19:10] hindering you and has victory over you.
[1:19:14] Don't let yourself live like Samson did.
[1:19:17] Amen.
[1:19:18] Don't find yourself oh
[1:19:22] years down the road and you recognize
[1:19:25] that oh if I could just do what I once
[1:19:28] did for the kingdom. Oh, I was raised up
[1:19:31] to destroy. Make the declaration tonight
[1:19:34] that I am I am raised to be more than a
[1:19:37] conqueror in Christ Jesus. I'm raised to
[1:19:40] be an overcomer in the last day. I know
[1:19:43] that it's hard. I know that I've got
[1:19:46] mind battles. I know I've got to fight.
[1:19:48] Oh, but thanks be to God, I was raised
[1:19:52] to be more than a conqueror. I was
[1:19:54] raised to live above that. Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] Yes.
[1:19:58] I don't ever want to be in that
[1:20:00] situation that Samson was in. Amen.
[1:20:03] He became a prisoner. And just to think
[1:20:06] of the contrast between him and those
[1:20:08] Hebrew boys, you know, God raised them
[1:20:11] up. He knew they were going to have to
[1:20:13] go and live in Babylon. Even and even
[1:20:15] when the enemy tried to get them to
[1:20:17] compromise,
[1:20:18] tried to get them to change their
[1:20:20] identity. They held the standard. I just
[1:20:22] thought about the cont simple contrast
[1:20:24] tonight between Samson and between those
[1:20:28] boys. There was a choice. It was one
[1:20:30] choice. And I want to catch this choice
[1:20:33] because this is this is something that
[1:20:35] deals with your heart. Samson let his
[1:20:37] lust for the world overcome his desires
[1:20:40] and he never fully recovered. I mean at
[1:20:44] the end of his life, the Lord granted
[1:20:45] him that strength back and we're
[1:20:47] thankful for that and it was an example
[1:20:48] for us. Amen. But I want to catch these
[1:20:51] few verses because there's a certain way
[1:20:53] that the devil influenced Delilah to say
[1:20:56] it in a certain way. And it was from
[1:20:59] that one statement and how she said it
[1:21:01] that broke him.
[1:21:04] Judges 16 she 15. And she said unto him,
[1:21:07] "How can thou say I love thee when thine
[1:21:11] heart is not with me?
[1:21:14] Thou hast mocked me these three times,
[1:21:17] and has told me there wherein thy great
[1:21:20] strength lith. And it came to pass when
[1:21:21] she pressed him daily with her words,
[1:21:24] and urged him, so that his soul was
[1:21:27] vexed unto death. And this next verse is
[1:21:30] so heartbreaking
[1:21:33] that he told her all his heart. And it
[1:21:37] was because there was a statement, I
[1:21:40] love thee when now when thine heart is
[1:21:44] not. How can you say you love me when
[1:21:46] thy heart? There's a way that the enemy
[1:21:48] works in in people's lives to to not so
[1:21:53] much go right for she wasn't telling
[1:21:56] Samson that she wanted him to be
[1:21:58] captured. She was just trying to get his
[1:22:01] heart.
[1:22:02] And that's what the devil does to you.
[1:22:04] The devil's not trying to tell you that
[1:22:06] he wants you to die, that he wants you
[1:22:08] to be living in hell, but he's trying to
[1:22:11] get your heart and that's the end goal
[1:22:14] there.
[1:22:15] So, he's working on your heartstrings.
[1:22:17] But don't find yourself in verse 17 and
[1:22:22] where you gave your heart to that thing.
[1:22:25] Don't give the enemy your heart. Amen.
[1:22:32] Don't let
[1:22:34] Don't let what happens up here seep down
[1:22:38] into here. Amen. That's what Samson's
[1:22:41] trouble was. He he let and we got we
[1:22:43] talked on that that quote. He let his
[1:22:46] feelings
[1:22:48] dictate his actions.
[1:22:50] He got so caught up in what she said and
[1:22:54] how she said it in how many times that
[1:22:57] she said it that his soul was vexed that
[1:23:00] he finally told her his heart.
[1:23:06] You know, she always there was always a
[1:23:08] portion which this is this is also a sad
[1:23:10] point is she always had access to a
[1:23:12] portion of his heart. There was always I
[1:23:14] mean the moment that he laid eyes on her
[1:23:16] there was access there because there was
[1:23:18] a lust of the eye and he loved this this
[1:23:21] Philistine woman and he was living
[1:23:24] outside of his ranks. Amen. And what
[1:23:27] happened was is that finally one day
[1:23:29] because of the small access that he
[1:23:33] allowed eventually it became access to
[1:23:36] it all. And that's what the sad thing is
[1:23:39] is that the small things can lead to
[1:23:43] the big things. Amen.
[1:23:45] I know the enemy does he he presses us
[1:23:48] daily. He Amen. Does he press you daily?
[1:23:52] Amen.
[1:23:53] Just want to bring um just some closing
[1:23:56] thoughts tonight
[1:23:58] um on Job. I was going through the book
[1:24:01] of Job a few weeks ago and you know I
[1:24:04] never probably should have caught this.
[1:24:06] I never caught this that the the the
[1:24:08] devil came before the heavenly council
[1:24:11] at two different times about Job. First,
[1:24:13] it was permission to attack all that he
[1:24:16] had. You know, in the first chapter
[1:24:18] deals with that, how how Job had lost
[1:24:20] everything that he held dear, his family
[1:24:22] and his livestock. But then the next
[1:24:23] chapter, the Bible says that the devil
[1:24:26] came again because it it hadn't broken
[1:24:30] Job the way the devil thought it would.
[1:24:32] Amen. And so Job 2, it says, "And again
[1:24:35] there was a day when the sons of God
[1:24:36] came to present themselves before the
[1:24:38] Lord. And Satan came also among them to
[1:24:41] present himself before the Lord. And the
[1:24:43] Lord said unto Satan, from whence comest
[1:24:45] thou?" And Satan answered the Lord and
[1:24:47] said, "From going to and fro in the
[1:24:49] earth, and walking up and down it?" And
[1:24:51] in verse four, he asked him this time if
[1:24:54] he could go a little bit further. He
[1:24:55] said, "All that man hath he will give
[1:24:59] for his life. let me take his health
[1:25:02] from him and he'll curse you to your
[1:25:05] face. And the Lord the Lord granted he
[1:25:07] said do what you will but don't take his
[1:25:09] life. I know we're familiar with that. I
[1:25:11] read this commentary on it. Job's
[1:25:13] response to the second test was the
[1:25:16] physical affliction contrast greatly to
[1:25:20] his attitude after the first test. Job
[1:25:22] still did not curse God, but he cursed
[1:25:25] the day of his birth. He felt it would
[1:25:28] be a better to never be born than to be
[1:25:30] forsaken by God. Job was struggling
[1:25:33] emotionally, physically, spiritually. He
[1:25:36] his misery was pervasive and deep. And
[1:25:38] this writer says this, "Never
[1:25:39] underestimate the vulnerability during
[1:25:42] times of suffering and pain. Hold on to
[1:25:45] your faith even if no relief is in
[1:25:49] sight." Job had gotten to a point in his
[1:25:51] life where there was no relief in sight.
[1:25:55] And once once the the the enemy started
[1:25:58] working, he knew the inner parts of a of
[1:26:01] a of a man's mind. And and once the
[1:26:03] enemy started working, he said, "If you
[1:26:05] let me take his health, there's just
[1:26:07] something discouraging about about when
[1:26:10] when you have afflictions in your body."
[1:26:12] Amen. Some the devil can come and get
[1:26:15] come in like a flood with those things.
[1:26:16] Amen. And he and they realize that. But
[1:26:18] then you begin to realize that it was
[1:26:21] after it wasn't after the first time he
[1:26:23] came, but it was after the second time.
[1:26:25] It was after those difficulties came
[1:26:27] that God came to reveal himself to Job
[1:26:31] in a way that had never been done ever.
[1:26:35] It was it was something this was a
[1:26:37] vision that God was going to give him
[1:26:40] that was gonna that was going to last
[1:26:42] for eternity.
[1:26:44] It was a vision of the sons of God
[1:26:48] shouting for joy. It was a vision that
[1:26:52] in my flesh I will see God. But it was
[1:26:55] after that second time there was a
[1:26:58] revelation that struck him. Amen. I just
[1:27:01] have this if you want to pull this this
[1:27:03] this last I think it's slide number
[1:27:05] five. Uh go ahead and bring the
[1:27:07] musicians. Uh you're here. So go ahead
[1:27:10] and bring the the musicians. We're going
[1:27:11] to go ahead and have the last few
[1:27:14] minutes here.
[1:27:18] Brother Benham says, he says, "That's
[1:27:20] right. Job said, 'You're watching those
[1:27:23] flowers how they die, go into the
[1:27:26] ground. Springtime they come up again,
[1:27:28] but man lays down. He doesn't rise no
[1:27:31] more." Said Job in this way so the
[1:27:34] children will get it. He's brother
[1:27:35] Brandham's dramatizing said, "The flower
[1:27:37] never sinned, but man sinned. And now
[1:27:40] you're only operating under a shadow.
[1:27:41] But the times are coming when there will
[1:27:43] be one come, a worthy one who can stand
[1:27:46] in the breach and put his hand on a
[1:27:48] sinful man and a holy God and bridge the
[1:27:52] way together.
[1:27:54] Then Job seen the next slide. Then Job
[1:27:59] seen
[1:28:02] what the lamb meant. I don't know if I
[1:28:05] have control of this thing.
[1:28:08] Oh, it's there. Then Job seen what the
[1:28:11] lamb meant. He shook himself, stood up
[1:28:15] being a prophet, the spirit came on him,
[1:28:17] and he said, "I know my redeemer
[1:28:19] liveth." Oh, there you are. Through the
[1:28:21] eyes of faith 4,000 years ahead, he
[1:28:25] said, "I know what you mean. That just
[1:28:28] one back there who was promised in Eden.
[1:28:32] I know my redeemer liveth and at the
[1:28:35] last days he will stand on the earth.
[1:28:37] Though the skin worms take me back.
[1:28:40] These are the words of Job. Like it did
[1:28:42] that flower. Yet in my flesh shall I see
[1:28:46] God. Amen. Why? I've come on the basis
[1:28:49] of redemption. I've come offering the
[1:28:51] shed blood that represents the blood.
[1:28:54] This is the type. This is the lamb. The
[1:28:56] next the one next next it says but way
[1:28:58] back yonder the Holy Spirit had revealed
[1:29:01] to him before the world ever started
[1:29:04] that God selected his blameless spotless
[1:29:08] lamb to take away the sin of the world
[1:29:11] and his in his pre-nowledge of it seeing
[1:29:14] him slain before the foundation of the
[1:29:18] world was ever laid and Job got a vision
[1:29:21] of that
[1:29:23] hallelujah job got a vision don't make
[1:29:26] any difference what you say now. He
[1:29:28] believed it. And when he did, the
[1:29:31] lightnings flashed and the thunders
[1:29:33] roared. What is it? The man of God
[1:29:36] getting back into the spirit. There's
[1:29:38] got to be a little anointing somewhere.
[1:29:40] That's right. He's got to get back into
[1:29:42] harmony with God. He said, "Oh, there it
[1:29:46] is." And notice God restored all back to
[1:29:50] him again. Restored his health back to
[1:29:53] him. Why? You Christians here tonight
[1:29:56] that's sick, you may be sick. That may
[1:29:58] be all right. God may be trying you for
[1:30:00] something, but remember, look to the way
[1:30:05] of redemption. Christ is your redeemer
[1:30:08] from sickness. Jesus or just keep
[1:30:11] holding to his unchanging
[1:30:15] hands. Everything that you have need for
[1:30:19] is placed in that lamb that has already
[1:30:22] been slain. And a lot of times we get it
[1:30:25] in our minds that that
[1:30:28] oh I'm I'm I'm unworthy. We are
[1:30:31] unworthy. But God isn't looking at that.
[1:30:34] We get it in our minds that we've made a
[1:30:36] mistake so great that we that we're past
[1:30:38] redeeming. Oh, but God isn't looking at
[1:30:40] that. He's looking at the lamb that was
[1:30:43] slain. And Job was able to see by a
[1:30:46] vision, thanks be to God, by a vision
[1:30:49] that lamb that was slain in his
[1:30:51] pre-nowledge before the foundation of
[1:30:53] the world. That was for you and it was
[1:30:56] for me. And if you have a sickness, it's
[1:30:58] for you and it's for me. If you have
[1:31:01] something in your heart, in your spirit,
[1:31:03] it's for you. It's for me. Saints of
[1:31:06] God, it doesn't matter what your need
[1:31:08] is. He is here tonight. He's here right
[1:31:12] now to be able to meet that. Oh, and I'm
[1:31:16] so thankful to that that he's got an
[1:31:18] unchanging hand. My feelings can cause
[1:31:20] me to to feel up and down sometimes, but
[1:31:24] God has an unchanging hand
[1:31:27] and I want to hold to that. I want to
[1:31:29] hold to God's unchanging hand. Let's all
[1:31:32] stand to our feet.
[1:31:36] Just close just close our eyes tonight.
[1:31:39] You know, had Job never gone through
[1:31:42] those circumstances, he may never I just
[1:31:46] thought about this. He may never have
[1:31:47] had that vision. And I know if it was me
[1:31:51] that for the rest of my life, I would be
[1:31:53] able to hold on to something like that.
[1:31:56] It doesn't matter what comes my way.
[1:31:58] I've got an anchor in my spirit, my
[1:32:00] heart to know. But had he never gone
[1:32:03] through that circumstance, he may never
[1:32:05] have come to that revelation.
[1:32:08] And though had those Hebrew boys never
[1:32:11] stepped into that fiery furnace, they
[1:32:14] may never have known what it was like to
[1:32:16] have a fourth man in the fire.
[1:32:19] Oh, sometimes
[1:32:21] you may be going through something and
[1:32:23] the purpose of it is just it might just
[1:32:26] be so that you can feel that there is a
[1:32:28] fourth man in the fire with you with the
[1:32:31] likeness of the of the son of God with
[1:32:35] the likeness of him. He He's walking
[1:32:37] with you. Amen.
[1:32:39] And I I loved that scripture that I
[1:32:41] started with
[1:32:43] against hope
[1:32:46] believed in hope. A lot of times you
[1:32:48] just it's hope it feels hopeless but
[1:32:51] against that I believe in hope. Amen.
[1:32:55] There was a power within them. They
[1:32:57] identified themselves
[1:32:59] with with that. Amen. Let's just bow bow
[1:33:02] our hearts. If you have a need before
[1:33:05] the Lord just just make it known as an
[1:33:08] uplifted hand as the Lord just may deal
[1:33:10] with your heart right now just where you
[1:33:12] are. Just open your heart up to him.
[1:33:14] Just just pour your heart out to him.
[1:33:17] Just know that he loves you and that he
[1:33:19] cares about you and that regardless of
[1:33:21] how you feel or what you've been
[1:33:24] feeling. That doesn't matter.
[1:33:28] It does not matter how you feel. God is
[1:33:30] with you. God is in you and he's here
[1:33:34] tonight to meet whatever need you may
[1:33:36] have. Heavenly Father, we just come
[1:33:38] before you and we're so grateful, Lord.
[1:33:40] Just be able to know that Lord, it
[1:33:44] doesn't matter how we feel, Lord Jesus.
[1:33:47] Sometimes we get to feeling low, Lord.
[1:33:50] Oh, our anchor is in Christ Jesus, Lord.
[1:33:54] Oh, and the plan has already been set,
[1:33:56] Lord. Lord, we're already we're already
[1:33:59] in your mind, Father, perfected where we
[1:34:03] need to be, Lord Jesus. And we're just
[1:34:04] walking our way there, Lord Jesus. Help
[1:34:07] us in this life.
[1:34:09] Help us tonight, Lord. Lord, with
[1:34:11] whatever we may be, Lord, you saw every
[1:34:13] hand and you know every heart that's
[1:34:15] here tonight that may hear the sound of
[1:34:16] my voice tonight, Lord God. May you just
[1:34:18] deal with them, Lord, in the individual
[1:34:21] way, Lord, that you do, Father. Lord,
[1:34:23] whatever it may be, Lord Jesus. Father,
[1:34:26] I I I I don't have any kind of gift of
[1:34:28] discernment, Lord, but I believe that
[1:34:31] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:34:33] and the intents of the heart. And I
[1:34:35] believe that the word can do those
[1:34:37] things and discern things, Lord, that we
[1:34:40] don't even we don't even know we may be
[1:34:43] struggling with. Lord, let it do that
[1:34:45] tonight. I pray. I love you, Lord. I
[1:34:48] commit every one of these, Lord,
[1:34:50] individuals into your hands, Lord. May
[1:34:52] Lord, may they just be encouraged
[1:34:54] tonight, Lord. May they go home, Lord,
[1:34:57] just with a nugget from you, Lord. May
[1:34:59] they go home and to be able to to say to
[1:35:02] to say that my redeemer liveth, Lord,
[1:35:05] and I'm identified with him in that
[1:35:08] sacrifice. Thank you, Lord. We're just a
[1:35:11] few days past Easter, but Lord, we're
[1:35:13] still in remembrance, Lord. We're always
[1:35:16] in remembrance of what you've did for
[1:35:18] us, Lord. Lord God, and we're so
[1:35:21] grateful for that, Lord. If there be one
[1:35:23] here tonight, Lord, that has never made
[1:35:25] contact,
[1:35:28] Lord, and leaned, Lord, into their
[1:35:30] redeemer, Lord, may tonight be a night
[1:35:34] where they have that chance, Lord God,
[1:35:36] and that it can go past being something
[1:35:38] surface level, Lord God, and it can be,
[1:35:41] Lord, something that they can identify
[1:35:44] with. We ask these things in the lovely
[1:35:47] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:50] Amen.
[1:35:52] Just go ahead and sing whatever's on
[1:35:54] your heart, brother.
