trusting God for all things inside man when I hope you could Amen me at home to him and I need you to help preach with me tonight knowing that the Lord could do all things he knows exactly what you have need of it man how many know immense Jehovah Jireh how many know I miss being a provider hallelujah chords a guy I'm just throw it right there a little piece of the song then we jump into the

hallelujah glory to God in there you know it's one thing with the challenge of the enemy that he would be just enough hallelujah but he's the type of guy that he a liar cut to run over he said he's more than enough for people and then praise God hallelujah a maybe won't Terry we're gonna turn straight to the scripture we're gonna look in the Book of Jonah tonight Amen maybe an unusual place and in but Jonah the first chapter starting at the first verse then also we want to pick something up in the New Testament in the book of Philippians at the same time how to lose your soul we started Jonah 1 we're gonna read in John or 3 as well then Philippians the third chapter man praise God I don't know about you but I always enjoyed the opportunity amen stand before a living God amen praise God hallelujah now we all familiar with the story of Jonah tonight he may appreciate the musicians amen now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amitayus and him and this was no news a newspaper but this was the word of the Lord and it said arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for the wickedness has come up before me now Jonah had a specific task that the Lord had given him to do what he says but Jonah rose up to flee under Tosh's from the presence of the Lord it went down to job and he found a ship going to Tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down and to it to go with them under Tosh's from the presence of the lord a man we know Almighty God gave him a task to do and instead of him doing that task he was in the opposite direction but the Lord I mean that's another but on their name send out a great win into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken in it so here Jonah is moving in the opposite direction from what the Lord wanted him to do but Almighty God sometimes when he allow certain things to happen on your track it man maybe I allow storm to happen on your track to get you back in line I mean now we know what happened for dealing out a man how to salvage threw him overboard amen he end up in the bay level up a special prepared fisherman but I want to draw your attention tonight to the third chat in the first verse because I want to catch what happened the second time around with Jonah me we see the first time when he had a call and in a direction that he was supposed to go in in the direction that he went in but God is gracious and all things the third chapter in the first verse it says in the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time we read earlier that the word of the Lord already came to Jonah but he's a lotta come back to a second time because God is in the business of being able to extend second chances and the people sometimes hallelujah glory to God and he said arise going to Nineveh he didn't change his story now he's telling the same thing once again arise going to Nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that I busy so Jonah arose went in the Nineveh according to the word of the Lord now Nineveh was a seen great city of three days journey and Jonah began to enter to the city of days journey and he big any cried and he said yet forty days and then of us should be overthrown but now catch what happened when when the word of the Lord came through the man of God amen to help get the people back in the line fifth verse says saw the people of Nineveh a man believed God a man that's one of the greatest things that you could ever do in any circumstance in any situation a man is to just believe God even your ABCs always believe Christ the people who never believed God and then they believed that got put in action and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them evil lisa-marie down to the tempers quickly amen but a word came unto the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and he laid his role from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes even the king came in and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his noble saying let neither man nor beast heard nor flaw taste anything let them not feed nor drink water they was in a state of desperation today said we not even gonna let our sin our livestock if they need it man but let mana beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mildly under God yay let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands what can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not even and this is the most important part that we get to me and God saw their works hallelujah I'm glad that God sees all things that they turn from the evil way and God repented of the evil that he said he would do unto them and he did it not the thing that he should've did it me the thing that he should have cast him in the judgment he decided not to do it he saw it at hearts where he saw it mindset was tonight for tired are we gonna take the god of a second chance in it the god of a second chance he's in the business of giving its people another opportunity to do more form in all things Philippians 3 started 11th verse and then we'll let you be seated I know it's a lot of reading but I just like to read description hallelujah flip is 3 and 11 amen Paul's talking about a second chance here I mean I looked at this for the Easter service not too long ago but I think it applies tonight as well if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after posting I'm not all the way there with some things but I'm following after if that I made apprehend that for which also I am an apprehended of Christ Jesus what he's saying is he wants to make sure that he grabs ahold of the thing that has grabbed ahold of him brother and I conduct myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus amen this is by hands tonight Heavenly Father in the holy name of Jesus Christ we're grateful for the opportunity to stand before your people did God and Lord we know that we're scattered all over father God but nevertheless Lord we all covered by the blood of Christ tonight Lord and we all have that same spirit living within us tonight father God so lord I pray that in these unusual times Lord that the spirit that is in need law will agree with the spirit of my fellow brother and spirit of my fellow sister tonight father God that we may all draw that much close to you father guy Lord we just pray that Lord you'll bless the people or the hand on your word Lord would you sell every heart lower settle every home father God every family Lord children Lord Lord no these things can be very difficult for Lord but nevertheless long you've given us at a store you always see these things true we think in the lovely name of Jesus Christ at the st. saving hallelujah you could be seated tonight if you so desire hallelujah praise God here Paul leave me he's picking up a thought and the book of Philippians a many a lot of times when we take this scripture about pressing towards the mark and when we start talking about leaving things behind a lot of times we we take this scripture around New Year's Eve time for watch night services and different things when you go on from old you into a new Yemen but also description can be applicable anytime you you see some things that are behind you and you see things that are before you and you see a direction that Almighty God wants you to go in it what happens as believers sometimes is that there is a spirit of complacency that could set in it there's a lot of spirits that off parade in the midst allowed to see a Amen and one thing is a spirit of complacency that can say I'm rich and I have need of nothing and not knowing that you have shortcomings which are outside not knowing that you haven't shortcomings with what you dress them with the word amen and that spirit of complacency even on the bride is far away from land and sea nevertheless insurance always exert its influence upon the people of God and bring forth for spirit of complacency amen Paul he told the people of God to get away from it amen as far as you gone there's further that we can go as far as you go a minute that there's more things that you can go into it man all that you've done there's still more than we can do a man he was guarding against the spirit of complacency and telling the people sometimes there's some things are behind you that you have to forget him forgetting those things that are behind reaching for those things that are before him in pressing towards the mark what happens in journal humans are very resistant to change that's something that we're all familiar with we don't really like moving to something different sometimes we don't like moving into something that's relatively our know there's a certain comfort level and a comfort zone that we always want to be able to stick in it and in the midst of that since God is that God the swords in the business of shaking things up sometimes what happens is he'll send things along your path that will cause you if you just whistling and twiddling your thumbs walking along eventually you will come upon something that's going to cause you to have to redirect your way so here we are nation amen in a time of great upheaval amen time a great change in time of unusual circumstances a time we even the oldest among us amen some of your senior sentence may be 80 and 85 maybe even nine years old have not even seen things taking place on the earth or taking place within our nation like the things that are taking place right now and see what happens in the midst of those things there's a great desire to always get things back to what they were there's a great push to get things back to how they were in the beginning amen but sometimes things aren't always meant to go back to how they were in the beginning there's a rush to get things opened back up and to get people moving and to give people enough money so thanks go back to how they used to be but you know brother Jason I think that this thing has left such a profound impact on the lives of people I don't think it ever fully get back to what it used to be a man thanks for you know not even when you shake some money hey you know somebody gonna have a thought in the back of their mind about shaking somebody's hand by hugging one another you mean about getting closer whispering something to somebody a man these things a man is we're in unusual times too to the point that I don't fully see it always getting back to what it used to be all right because God is still in the business of shaking things the scripture in the book of Hebrews amen he talks about how to earth was shaking him and Hebrews the twelve chattering man and then he talks about how the next time around a man not only the Earth's gonna be shaken but heaven is gonna be shaken as well amen the spiritual things that people hold on save me if you don't have a tied up in the Christ in the right way and what he's saying is the reason why those things will get shaken the reason why the shaking happens sometimes it's because he he shakes the things that can't be shaken so that the things that cannot be shaken those things will still remain the things that cannot be shaken the foundation that we have within Jesus Christ that cannot be shaken hallelujah we're part of a kingdom that cannot be shaken even if we try to go back to things how they used to be a man but we will see a sense of how things started out maybe the world had a deeper sense of unity starting out with the things that we had to go through but now all the sudden you see like the political divide that they had is is getting greater getting so doesn't matter what man tries to do naturally sometimes there's more things that work going on in there but when circumstances arising and circumstances have a way of doing these one or two things that either get you closer to God Amen I get you further away from God it either gets you closer to trusting an Almighty God and trusting the things you've been taught and trusting the things you believe in I want to push your way and cause you to trust and other things cause you to trust in the CDC more I'll cause you to trust in the presidency more a man and you either get closer to God or fall away from God powerful to God a man he said that we're living in an age but we would need more faith in men than any other agent in 1965 spiritual new season in men we will call more faith than ever in any age because there were people that have to have rapture faith and then we are people that see circumstances and all those circumstances do just how brother Ken sung a little bit earlier and calls us to sing a song called Beulah land Lord I'm getting homesick Lord I got a desire for something crazy man Paul said the believer is always in the business of moving forward amen leaving those things are behind reaching for those things that are before us amen and if you can't if these circumstances and things hadn't cause you to draw closer to Christ then I don't know what well if this time period hasn't cause you to read more in man and pray more man and love your family more that I don't know what well in these times they slowed us down you're not too long ago my wife told me you know God bless us to be married for we're going on 13 years and she said brother Mark Maurice you don't cook like you used to cook but guess what circumstances slow life down enough today I'm doing a lot of cooking around going back in reestablishing things I mean my family means more to me the Word of God amen being my shield knowing that the name of the Lord is a strong tower amen it means more to me now amen if you don't come out of this thing with a deep understanding of the grace of God because you could use Purell you cannot shake hands you could stay six feet apart you can stay 12 feet apart and you still could get everything amen I'm not saying that you don't do those things but at the end of the day a lot of people have done those things and still come down with something so what it shows you is it gives you a deeper appreciation of the grace Almighty God you should come out of this thing with a deeper appreciation for the ministry even a deeper appreciation for your church event the brothers are they working tirelessly to make sure that you have a smooth stream going into your house so you can hear the word of God amen because faith comes by here so you can hear the word of God to have your faith stoked in these times they meant what faith is fading away God wants his people moving forward amen come on the prophets shoulder said man had that frog spirit in the book of Revelation behind the eyes with that frog is set up so that the frog is always looking behind themselves amen but God has called his people to be Eagles in the sideway man we're looking at him and in this time per day man you know I think people have a desire to get things to how they used to be but at the same time I believe that he wants to have our attention for us to get that much closer to him amen he wants to have our attention for us to understand that time is moving a minute and it's time for us to be able to get our comfort zone stay out of our comfort zone amen even I was described in the book of Matthew Amen huh we had the ten virgins we are familiar with the story but if I'm for the God said it was some virgins that would shrimp their lap get that carving off the lamps it would keep burning bright sometimes things happen amen to remind you to keep that carbon off your lamp keep your lamp trimmed its lamp trimming time he's giving us all our patootie amen to joy that much closer to him amen to do that much more for him amen she's always good to have more time with your family but now I want to show the Lord amen that I'm doing something with my time that I'm spending with him as well we looked at a brief story Ava in the story of Joan a man we know that it deals about the city of Nineveh in the scripture that we read started out and it talks about how the life that they was living with in the city of Nineveh the sin that was taking place the things that were going on how it was so vile a man the Bible says that it came up before God the wickedness of the people came up before God what they were doing it was so strong it was so impactful that nobody could deny me that these were sinful people they've been and that they were in trouble but you know the thing that Almighty God did for those people was that he gave him a second chance and he gave them a second opportunity Noel says believers Amen sometimes you know you look at a second chance second opportunity I'm not so much talking about your salvation I'm not so much talking about a life of sin amen and those things do apply mean he gave a lot of us a second chance to come out of sin to come out of things that you were Stoffel with to come out of things that you should not have been doing amen but you know he gave us another chance to draw that much more closer to yeah he gave us another chance to have his word reveal to us just that much more in our hour where people have a very poor understanding of the word of God but nevertheless he had a special people that he gave a second chance to you know I like what he did for them even as he allowed a warning to come before the judgment came in one thing God is in the business of doing a man he'll give you some warning before the judge made me what did he do he said I'm a prophet let him know what was going on and that's not too far from what we familiar with amen God sent us a prophet to let us know what was going on that way we can have some warning before the judgement good with so many things and from the book but there was a very poor understanding of what was within the book and see what the warning coming before the judgment what it does is it gives you an opportunity to get things right amen you know one of the greatest things anybody ever have is an opportunity it's not a lot of times he won't stuff give it to them but they just want an opportunity to do something man and if you get the opportunity and if you have the right things within your heart you will make the most of that opportunity hallelujah I'm in love the Lord tonight amen now the Scriptures talking about Nineveh a city a man I mean know the Bible type such as being a city as well no we're familiar with the book of Revelation amen it talks about a city sitting on seven hills a man is referring to Mystery Babylon him in and we know what type of situation she is in amen God's taught us how that's the false church amen denominational systems they been going in the wrong direction linked up to that mother harlot amen and nevertheless a minute the scripture tells us how they destroy they were shrunk off of the blood of the Saints in man they were living amongst the kings of the earth Amen in that city was tight as being a church but then again a man is also a people of God amen being tight as being a city Amen that city it's called the New Jerusalem so even though we told my Nana being a city a minute and it seems the user has a type but nevertheless the people of God I tighten as a city as well event John was sitting in the script shame in the book of Revelation 21st chapter an angel said he was going to show John the bride the Lambs wife he meant and instead a many John looking he saw a city a man he said it was ascending down from from heaven aim in the holy city coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband a man revelations what he wanted to is it prepared as a bride adorned for a husband something having the glory of God shining with fear hurry men Almighty God has blessed sure that you had the glory of God shining within you amen talking about the precious stones and the precious things with finesse it talked about the walls and the gates and the foundations they meant how he set us up as believers amen with walls against certain things from the enemy Haman and certain gates to uh certain things in and certain things up he's surrounded us with precious stones amen he's built himself a place where Almighty God can abide in the midst of a dark and evil age where he could be comfortable where he could sharpen show his power even a bride that he set aside evening that was specially personally in profit but we know better now that Jonah was actually doing the will of the Lord because him going the complete opposite direction quarter garden is complete opposite way on the man ended up in the belly of that fish just to come out amen in Nineveh and for those people to see this man of God walking from out of the mouth for the fishing man the very thing that they worship because they worship a fish guy the very thing that held in high esteem and high regard even when they had they parties when they had they sacrifice dagon was a big goddamn monster but then they saw a man of God walking out of the mouth for that same fish that he might with a worship tell her name was time to repent get your hops in order and get right if God would show that type of favor to a backslidden city like Nineveh how much more favor would he shows his bride in New Jerusalem amen hallelujah evening now the scripture says in Jonah the third chapter in the fifth verses a minute says that the people of Nineveh a man once they got the opportunity did something with it Amen we have to be careful with our opportunity what we do with it and what we don't do with it because you know these times can wrap up an in and you know people go on about a business and it's just a blip on your radar but then it comes a question of how do we use this time period to draw that much more closer to Christ to get more of him within a segment to understand that there's still more that we could receive I'm happening the Book of Jonah third shot in the fifth verse amen when the Prophet came and he preached them and told them to get right and told him that they were very simple before this guy that it did not have any knowledge of but they started this guy was powerful enough to bring their own guys within or date men the fifth verse it says so the people of Nineveh believed God that's such a simple thing to say and that you believe God but you know out of the millions or billions of people that walked is how if you have a testimony that they believe God because I'll tell you something you could believe in a lot of things you believe what South Carolina DHEC is doing it you believe the things that dr. future you're saying even because he's a very smart man but you know believe in God hallelujah will remind you that all things are possible believe in God a minute it'll remind you that he could do anything I failed believe in God will remind you that he will keep the plague away from you and then the fact that you believe God is what separates you for none believe a man that's the basic thing to say Amen but just think how different the words are when you say a believer and unbeliever the two words are so far apart just by you adding two little letters to the word believer and you'll be an unbeliever that immediately cut you off from the access of the power of Almighty and unlimited a god but you know believers were why different Amen God says that we believe it that settles it Amen we walk by the unseen things which is faith in it because we know without faith it's impossible to please a believer will believe all the way down to the enemy even had that little widow woman when she had her son and just had a little bit of meal laughing about it about she went down believing what that prophet said amen and he asked her to fix him a cake and she fixed that cake on and she didn't know anything about it all she did was believe a believer peace believe it on till the very end no matter the circumstance keep believing come on Saints no matter the test keep believing God amen hallelujah and see what believing God does is because faith is action word amen faith without works is dead so if you believe on long enough it is starting to put you in action and you could demonstrate to the world what you believe and what believing does is they cast out fear hallelujah Bible says if those people believe amen the people of Nineveh believed God Amen not only did they believe then they started getting put in action a man it's good to come out to church a man say I'm gonna believe Amen we sing only believe before the preacher comes out those things are well and good but see believing is action it's got to be demonstrated beyond what's just a mental connotation a minute of what you're taking him in but you show it in your actions now these people when they believe God in me they went forward they proclaim the fast and they put on the sackcloth amen there was a great humbling of themselves before Almighty God in Scripture lets us know that they cried out to God in me that they cried mightily out to God that's what it says Nate first they cried mightily unto Him they humbled themselves in men it was so they were so concerned about what the Word of God said when it came to they even got a pets and the animals in the livestock in order because they believed what he said us being the body of Christ and us believing what the gospel is said to us I mean it calls us to get our house in order men it calls us to get our families in order causes us to get our lives in order calls us to keep our hearts in order because we believe God and we want to show our belief as being action word you know how like I even said how to King the king of this great city even earlier in the scripture says that the city of Nineveh was so big it took you three days to walk through the entire city so this king he was a big time king it man he was just the king of a little side city somewhere they just had a few hundred people but he was the king of a major city he was somebody that people looked up to but the scripture lets us know even though he was a leader he did something different from the leadership that you see a lot nine days a man this leader humbled himself before God this leader took time then he tuned himself down with the rest of the people and the scripture says from the king all the way down to the least they humble themselves they got on one Accord it man he didn't say well this up for me to see he asked and for the rest y'all to get y'all selves in order but everybody got in line that's why you ought to think I forgot the leadership it in a godly past a meaning somebody that knows how to humble themselves a man how to get their whole self and how to get their whole mindset out of the way what these people did they took time they got serious with God even as the time saying get serious with God stay serious with God not saying anybody here wasn't serious we got a man but even Paul recognized there was a time that we had to forget those things that were behind us it's a time where we have to move away from certain things in you a second chance if you got sending your life and you need another chance to get it straightened out he's graces now yeah he has done that you've got little things in your heart against your brother or your sister in that you need to get straight now he's so gracious things that he instills that second chance hallelujah glory to God if you know you were slow forward reading studying amen and really got to the things of God you know it is we get so busy with the cares of this life and things that are going on and making sure our families are situated but nevertheless he's not a God that would allow judgment to come when I give you some water a man he would give you another chance to get it right and that says believers officers people that love God I says being set aside as being part of the Bride of Christ what we do we'll do even more than what the people of nineveh did we take advantage of the second chance hallelujah understand that he's the God of the second chance even the man of God in the description of Jonah he is a prophet he is getting a word directly from Almighty God himself go to Nineveh and what does he do he goes to complete opposite direction innovated me Tosh's was somewhere out by Portugal and Spain and then Nineveh was going into the Middle East so he's going the complete opposite direction over thousands of miles away in another direction but he still gave a second chance to make it right when we're talking about Pope all amen Paul was the poster child of somebody had a second chance it man and you could see that in his rightness how he would talk about the grace of God all things work together and the things that he came out from it oh my when he wrote the book of Hebrews and wrote the book of Ephesians you can see those things in Paul that Paul was very appreciative of the second chance that Almighty God had given under him in the book of Philippians I mean Paul he starts to going back over some of the things in his life I mean we know Paul was a very educated man he was learned in the scripture he tells us at one point he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees but at the same time he turns around and said but I had to count a lot of those things as dung said I could attain them to the ecstasy of Christ man he had to count those things I mean that's a very strong word to say but he said he counted us doing the things that were his own thoughts the things that were his own ideas the things that was his own mind set him and I read it to you men he said yea doubtless I kind of all these things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my lord amen history a demon for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung why that I may win Christ everything that we do is drawing closer to Christ in this alley me Paul said it was a time it meant to lay something Society then leave some things behind reach forward to some certain things if we hadn't had any growth since the beginning of this year in 2020 we should be showing some growth by now if you feel like your revelation isn't growing in the things of God a man you still dwelling with what what your mama's thinks a minute which daddy thinks a man and it's good to follow what your pastor thinks I mean but you got to dig into the scraps a man and let the Lord show you some things he's given us the chance to do those things every time you look at the faith for Christianity it was always about a people a man taking something and moving that much further with it down the road so what it shows you is that the revelation of Christ is a progressive revelation the revelation of Christ means that you keep growing you keep moving don't matter if you're a little kid or teenager even with your understanding of these things you still go forward and keep moving with these things Paul wrote the book of Hebrews and try to convince those Jews that you had a good thing under Judaism but if you keep moving forward into these things of Christ I got something even better for you but I gotta take you even the church thought they had some good things they've been down through the ages and we familiar man named Martin Luther he came in to talk about how to church to live by faith and you might have been a good Catholic anything you might have been somebody that really believed the things of the church amen but it was time to move forward in that revelation so when the prophet of God is broke it down to this amen then it came around in John Wester says it's time to clean up your life get things in northern just like a Christian women act like a Krishna man and the church had to move forward Anatomy that someone was great Pentecostal fathers came in and started talking about this Holy Ghost that was moving how God had Portia's for the people of God that would give you power from your life and the church had to take another step that God sent a modern-day prophet on the scene let us know the church had to take another step from man so the Holy Ghost not just being Oh something on your flesh that make you speak your tongues make you jump around a little bit but will come in and actually make change within your life that will come in and actually be an interpreter of the word for you man that will allow you to keep moving forward amen leave those things that are behind and press towards the more God has never been in the business of leaving his people in the same spot the children usual they had it all right in Goshen a man-eater didn't bother them but so much but at the same time there was time for them to come out of there and go into a promised land what the book of Revelation tell us a man says come out of her my people don't stay with you and move forward I got more light to show you I got a mindset that I want you to have that's different from the world and even though you've been walking in a certain way long period of time I still want you to keep passing tours tomorrow [Music] never left his people in the same spot II never left his people in the same spot always wants his people to move forward amen he that's my frent Christ is a new creature old things are passed away all things become new amen he always wants his people moving forward you know one of the new things that he gave the people a book revelation fish at David right in that bridge between the church ages and seals they meant when they find out that there was somebody worried that opened a book since those twenty-four elders and those beasts they started singing a new song a new song sure they had a song all through the ages and they worship God for what he did in their life how you stood for them but when they saw the land where high he moved that high he was an inner cedar when nobody was worthy the brother said it caused him to sing a new song Alleluia go to God well you see what Almighty God has done for you and how he brought you over how he kept you and kept your family and a miss mydas virus is moving around chop you it'll give you a new sense of the grace of God you know I work in health care so I was seeing something there was time how when you put on your mass and your gloves and your gown if you took it off the wrong way you could put on a virus within the air that could cause you to people we're doing all these things to try to make sure everybody stays safe and in the process you taking those things off you could put a virus in there the kitchen so what those things are doing to put a certain sense of fear somebody put you know as soon as that fear starts moving to think oh my there's nothing I can do then the grace of God comes in and say my grace is sufficient for the evening hallelujah so what that does that causes us to be able to sing a new song before God amen they had a new revelation they had a new experience where they saw somebody intercede for them in a way that they never expected when they saw somebody intercede for them when nobody else could intercede for them no matter how good they were a man faintly we're all through the ages nobody else could do it but the Lamb of God and what it did is it caused them to change their worship it caused them to change their mind City cause them to change how they son Almighty God as we come out of this thing a minute if we knew the musicians I hear y'all can come forward amen as we come out of this thing what it should do is it change our worship change our attitude towards one another he gave us a second chance to get these things right and isn't something that we should take light it isn't something we could be settled in a bit and God has given all of us a sense of our salvation it should be establish a man we all understand that but even Paul said and you know there's still certain things I want to be able to apprehend amen there's still more things I want to be able to grab ahold of because I see it as needful but even in the midst of that Paul said that I know everything still will be alright because something is out friendly to me something is holding on to me so even though I might never reach the ground falls to all things even though my story short comes within my life you're not still my have things I need to move forward I still got something that has a hold of me amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and the thing that has a hold of us tonight but a power Almighty God amen butl blood of Jesus Christ it'll never let you go it'll never let you down there's a lot of things in this agent that could be confusing that could be scary but we're grateful for the opportunity Amy to know Almighty God in me to know a living Savior a guy that but give us a chance to make those things right with him even hallelujah Korda God amen do you love him Amen over to God praise God that's a good song let's try because of who you
