[0:02] Dear gracious Lord, I come before you
[0:04] this morning, Father, we're coming
[0:07] together for this little Sunday school
[0:08] service, Lord, that I have this thought
[0:11] upon my heart. That Lord, that I I know
[0:14] is from you. And Father, we're
[0:17] coming together now to ask that you
[0:19] would come down and anoint my lips,
[0:21] anoint the hearts of the people.
[0:24] Let us open our hearts to your word,
[0:26] Father, we could take hold of it, that
[0:28] it could be revealed to us and that we
[0:30] could manifest it again in this day. And
[0:32] Father, as we would turn to your word
[0:34] this morning, that first we would turn
[0:37] to the author that you would be in it
[0:40] and that you would reveal yourself to us
[0:42] a little bit this morning. We ask it we
[0:44] invite you into this service in Jesus
[0:46] name. Amen.
[0:46] Amen. Um let's all turn to
[0:52] um I'm going to start with Revelations
[0:55] chapter 10
[0:58] and verse one
[1:01] and we'll read a text and then y'all can
[1:04] be seated. Um, so re, this is
[1:07] Revelations 10 and verse one. And it
[1:11] says, "And I saw another mighty angel
[1:13] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:14] cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head,
[1:17] and his face was as it were the sun, and
[1:19] his feet as pillars of fire." You all
[1:22] can be seated.
[1:25] Um, so, uh, I'm going to read that
[1:31] and then, um, just for the sake of time,
[1:34] um, I'm going to just, I just have it
[1:36] noted down here. Um, this is Revelation
[1:38] 4 and verse one. It says, "And after
[1:41] this, I looked, and behold, a door was
[1:43] open in heaven. Um,
[1:46] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:49] it were of a trumpet talking with me,
[1:50] which said, um, is that King James? Can
[1:53] you pull up Revelation 4:1?" There we
[1:54] go. Um, uh, uh, trumpet talking with me,
[1:57] which said, "Come up hither, and I will
[1:59] show thee things which must be
[2:01] hereafter." Um, in verse two, um, and
[2:05] immediately I was in the spirit, and
[2:06] behold, a throne was set in heaven. One
[2:08] sat on the throne, and he that sat uh
[2:13] was to look upon like a jasper and
[2:15] sardine stone, and there was a rainbow
[2:17] round about the throne, in sight like
[2:19] unto an emerald. And round about the
[2:22] throne were four and 20 seats. And upon
[2:24] the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[2:26] sitting clothed in white raignment. And
[2:27] they had on their heads crowns of gold.
[2:30] Now, um I'm reading this and I'll I'll
[2:33] give you a little bit of a backstory
[2:36] where this thought came to be. Um I was
[2:39] we were going to Walmart, me and my
[2:41] lovely wife, and she is now in the stage
[2:44] of pregnancy where we're rearranging
[2:46] furniture and making baby clothes. Um
[2:47] which I think is called nesting. And um
[2:51] the uh so she's she was wanting to make
[2:53] baby clo this dress and it had you know
[2:55] was kind of colorful and it was kind of
[2:56] rainbowy and she was like it kind of
[2:58] looked like a rainbow and she's like
[2:59] well I'm worried that you know her
[3:00] birthday's in June and people are going
[3:01] to get a weird imp impression that you
[3:04] know she's got a rainbow dress on and I
[3:07] was like no this is ridiculous. I'm not
[3:10] going to let the world take that because
[3:12] God clothe himself in rainbows. that
[3:15] this is so integral to who God is that
[3:17] he clothes him he wraps himself in a
[3:19] rainbow that even Joseph who is a type
[3:21] of Christ had to wear a rainbow
[3:24] in order to be that perfect type. It's
[3:26] very integral and it's not an accident
[3:28] and it's not a um it's not just a
[3:31] throwaway thing. It's not just a a
[3:34] bizarre happen stance that in the modern
[3:37] age the rainbow has become associated
[3:39] with something not of God. Right? That's
[3:41] not an accident. that's not, you know,
[3:44] and I'm not even necessarily saying that
[3:45] it's people who are part of that
[3:47] movement, but some intelligence
[3:49] somewhere associated that rainbow with
[3:52] something perverted. Okay? And
[3:56] it's the more I looked into this, the
[3:58] more I looked into what a rainbow is,
[4:00] what it represents, I was so floored
[4:04] by just how deep this is. And so that's
[4:06] what we're going to talk about um is uh
[4:09] rainbows and what it represents and why
[4:11] God associates himself with that.
[4:15] Um
[4:16] so one thing I would like to note about
[4:19] Revelations chapter 10 where he said he
[4:21] was clothed in a cloud and his face
[4:23] shine like a sun and there was a rainbow
[4:25] about his head.
[4:26] Amen.
[4:27] Notice the two things that make a
[4:30] rainbow is water
[4:33] and clouds and sunlight. So here's
[4:37] Christ clothed in a cloud. His face is
[4:39] shining like the sun, which makes a
[4:40] rainbow. Okay.
[4:44] Um so if the if this rainbow is made up
[4:46] of two components, water and sunlight,
[4:50] I got to think, all right, well, what is
[4:52] water represent scripturally, right?
[4:54] What's the what's the type there? Um and
[4:57] the water there's two different ways
[4:59] that you can interpret the um
[5:03] what water represents where it types
[5:05] out. The first is that water represents
[5:08] the word.
[5:09] Amen. Okay, we know the washing of the
[5:11] water by the word that this is um that
[5:14] when the the you know that that would be
[5:17] water and then light um and there's you
[5:21] know I could read some a lot of quotes
[5:23] on this but I I'm just for the sake of
[5:24] time. Light is associated with
[5:28] revelation.
[5:30] Amen.
[5:30] Okay.
[5:32] Right. Obviously there's the obvious I
[5:34] mean just go from foundations, right?
[5:35] Darkness
[5:37] conceals, light reveals. Amen.
[5:39] Okay. Um when Christ's face is revealed,
[5:42] it shines. Um revelation is almost
[5:45] always associated with light. When
[5:46] Christ is revealed to uh to Saul before
[5:50] he became comes Paul, it was through
[5:52] what? A light. Um uh even even when uh
[5:56] we start having a restoration of the of
[5:59] Revelation in the church ages under
[6:01] Luther, this is what we commonly refer
[6:05] to as the enlightenment period,
[6:07] right?
[6:07] Okay. Um
[6:10] uh even when the Holy Ghost is revealed
[6:13] on the day of Pentecost, it is revealed
[6:15] in a multitude of lights, right? Licks
[6:18] of fire. These are individual lights.
[6:20] Revelation is always associated with
[6:22] light. And so a rainbow is the word
[6:25] revealed, right? It is revelation
[6:28] passing through the word which then
[6:30] separates out into a a greater fullness.
[6:33] Right? It's you can see the white light
[6:34] of the sun, but when it passes through
[6:36] the word, it separates out into a
[6:38] fullness that you can now see. All those
[6:40] colors are in the white light of the
[6:43] sun, but unless it passes through the
[6:45] word, you don't fully realize what's
[6:47] there,
[6:47] right? It becomes a fullness.
[6:52] And so this is exactly where you know as
[6:55] the church when you feed on the word
[6:57] when revelation strikes you
[7:00] and you see the fullness there's seven
[7:02] colors right all these seven colors or
[7:05] the seven redemptive names of Jehovah
[7:08] can be the Jehovah can be in his
[7:10] fullness to you be through revelation of
[7:12] the word. This is why read your Bible
[7:14] and pray every day. Feed on the word and
[7:16] then pray for revelation
[7:18] right? feed on the word, water the word,
[7:21] you know, get water and revelation, and
[7:23] then whatever situation you're in. Now,
[7:26] we say that there's seven colors in a
[7:27] rainbow, and that's true. I'm not
[7:29] disputing that. However, something to
[7:31] bear in mind. Interesting thing about
[7:33] rainbows is they are actually
[7:34] technically an infinite number of
[7:36] colors, right? Within each hue, each of
[7:39] those seven hues, if you break it down
[7:41] scientifically, those are just created
[7:43] from the infinite spectrum of light
[7:45] wavelengths.
[7:46] Amen.
[7:46] That can be then sorted out. And so
[7:48] within whatever situation that you're
[7:49] in, no matter how unique or specific or
[7:53] wowy wowsy woo, no one has ever suffered
[7:55] like I have, right? I'm special and out
[7:57] of the billions of people. Well, within
[8:00] each hue of light, there's an infinite
[8:02] number of shades of that color.
[8:04] Okay? The within each redemptive name,
[8:07] there's an infinite number of ways that
[8:09] God can interact with you to meet you
[8:11] exactly where you are at. Okay? You may
[8:14] be one of 30 billion people to have
[8:16] existed, but 30 billion is nothing in
[8:19] comparison to infinity.
[8:20] Okay? There's an infinity ways that God
[8:23] can deal with you and your problems.
[8:26] All right? No matter where you're at, no
[8:28] matter what situation you're in,
[8:31] the the when you find revelation of the
[8:34] word of God, it will meet you where
[8:36] you're at. Okay?
[8:38] Amen.
[8:40] Now the other aspect of this where water
[8:44] also
[8:45] uh can be typed out is that water
[8:47] represents the Holy Spirit or the Holy
[8:50] Ghost um in the people. Okay, we can see
[8:54] this with the smitten rock. Moses
[8:56] striking the smitten rock. Christ is the
[8:57] smitten rock. Out from him flows the
[8:59] spirit. Okay, that we now have access to
[9:02] that Holy Spirit in the church. And so
[9:07] which might sound like some sort of a
[9:09] contradiction but bear in mind the Holy
[9:11] Spirit is the word. The word was in the
[9:14] beginning was the word. Right? See John
[9:15] chapter 1 that that what the Holy Spirit
[9:19] is is simply the word in a form that is
[9:23] capable of indwelling within a person.
[9:25] Amen.
[9:25] That's what the Holy Spirit is.
[9:29] That it is it is the word with the
[9:31] ability to indwell within a person.
[9:35] When huh when that happens, okay, when
[9:39] when the when the spirit of God dwells
[9:43] within a person, they are now the word,
[9:46] right?
[9:47] Amen.
[9:47] Made into flesh, compacted and condensed
[9:51] into a flesh package.
[9:52] Amen.
[9:53] Right. I I don't have the time to read a
[9:57] lot of quotes, but there's a lot of
[9:59] quotes on that. Um the the everything
[10:02] you know all that Christ was he poured
[10:04] in or all that God was poured into was
[10:05] Christ and all that Christ was was
[10:06] poured into the bride. Okay. The bride
[10:08] of Christ full of the Holy Ghost full of
[10:10] the Holy Spirit is nothing short of the
[10:12] word made flesh in this day. That's what
[10:15] that is. And when when Christ is
[10:17] revealed through his bride,
[10:19] right? All those redemptive names are
[10:21] now manifested through her.
[10:23] Right? When you uh act, you become
[10:27] Christ on on earth,
[10:28] right? you. That's what Christian means,
[10:30] doesn't it?
[10:32] Believers never named themselves
[10:34] Christians. The world did that,
[10:36] right? Christians just behaved
[10:40] the way the Holy Spirit led them. And
[10:42] the result was everyone around them
[10:44] could see that that was that they had
[10:46] seen this before,
[10:48] right? This was a reflection of Christ.
[10:51] Christians, if you're a real Christian,
[10:53] people can tell, right? If and if and by
[10:56] the way if people can't tell then I have
[10:59] some questions about whether or not
[11:01] you're really a Christian,
[11:03] right?
[11:03] I mean that's that seems a little harsh,
[11:05] but you know bear that in mind. Your
[11:07] lifestyle being a Christian does not
[11:08] mean you go to church and you read out
[11:10] of a Bible and you you know have some
[11:13] sort of understanding of of scriptures.
[11:17] No, being a Christian means you have a
[11:19] lifestyle that reflects a Christ
[11:21] lifestyle.
[11:22] Amen.
[11:22] Okay.
[11:23] Amen. So when Christ is revealed through
[11:25] you, right, you become the the revealed
[11:29] word for your day,
[11:30] right? You you are that's why we say um
[11:33] you know uh when when you you know
[11:35] preach preach the word with all of your
[11:36] heart and when all else fails, use
[11:38] words,
[11:38] right? Your lifestyle preaches a sermon.
[11:41] Your lifestyle reveals Christ to the
[11:43] world.
[11:44] Amen.
[11:44] Okay. Huh. Now,
[11:49] um how much time do I got? It is going
[11:52] quick. Um,
[11:58] now brother Brandham talks about the
[12:00] rainbow. A lot of times if you just look
[12:02] up, you know, search the word rainbow,
[12:04] you're going to get a lot of quotes
[12:06] where brother Brandham over and over and
[12:07] over and over and over again shows the
[12:09] rainbow as he said the two ends of the
[12:11] rainbow are alpha and omega and then the
[12:13] seven colors represent the seven church
[12:15] ages.
[12:16] Okay, which again Christ being revealed
[12:19] through his people in those church ages.
[12:22] Amen.
[12:22] There each age required a different
[12:25] aspect of Christ to be revealed, a
[12:26] different color, right? It's all of the
[12:28] same God. It's all the same word, but
[12:30] it's being revealed with a different
[12:31] aspect depending on what was needed at
[12:34] that time. Okay? But it's still Christ
[12:37] revealed through his church,
[12:38] right?
[12:38] Creates the seven colors and and it
[12:40] begins and ends with Christ.
[12:43] Okay?
[12:44] Amen.
[12:45] Um he's the alpha and the omega. It
[12:46] references that the um the s the um oh
[12:49] the jasper and sardine stone. These
[12:51] represented Ruben and Benjamin which
[12:52] were the first and lastborn uh
[12:55] patriarchs. Okay, the beginning and the
[12:57] ending. Um but it's both Christ right
[13:02] now. This is where
[13:05] uh you know when we look at the rainbow
[13:08] and the other aspect of this obviously
[13:10] if you're any even Sunday school
[13:12] children should understand the rainbow
[13:13] represents the covenant
[13:16] right it's the covenant that God gave to
[13:17] Noah which was a foretelling of the
[13:19] covenant that God would give the world
[13:20] through the br the blood of Jesus Christ
[13:22] right that that around the the the world
[13:26] is this um this covering of blood that
[13:29] prevents the holy God from seeing the
[13:32] sinful earth and destroying it. Right
[13:34] now, if you notice in when brother Ram
[13:37] tells the vision of when he, you know,
[13:38] he he goes up and he sees the earth and
[13:40] it's surrounded by the blood and then
[13:42] the sins come up and and and pass
[13:44] through that that uh that barrier. The
[13:48] way he tells that, he says when he saw
[13:50] the earth, it was surrounded by a
[13:52] rainbow and then a voice told him that
[13:55] rainbow is the blood.
[13:56] Okay? So it's the earth surrounded by a
[13:59] rainbow or a covenant that that prevent
[14:03] that is preventing the earth from you
[14:06] protecting the earth from destruction.
[14:08] Um
[14:10] notice
[14:12] uh when you look out and see a rainbow,
[14:14] right? You see the beginning and you see
[14:15] the ending and you see the rainbow in
[14:16] the middle. If you I was doing some
[14:20] research on this and and the the the
[14:22] science it was a.gov gov like science
[14:24] website um was the way they worded this
[14:27] I thought was beautiful. They said if
[14:29] you were to start lifting off of the
[14:31] ground and start floating higher you
[14:34] will start to see that the rainbow is
[14:36] actually a circle and it looks like a a
[14:39] arch because that's all you can see
[14:42] because the terrain gets in the way. But
[14:43] the higher you go once you get above it
[14:46] you see that the rainbow is a circle.
[14:49] Right? We see the church ages and the
[14:52] and the the finite arc of time and God
[14:55] sees an infinite circle. God sees an
[14:57] infinity. What we see as an alpha and
[15:00] omega, right? A beginning and an ending.
[15:02] It's all the same thing. The start line
[15:04] and a finish line on the racetrack are
[15:06] the same line,
[15:07] right? The alpha and the omega are the
[15:09] same thing,
[15:11] right? And the time, you know, all the
[15:14] the it's all it's all a a circle, right?
[15:17] It's infinite. the the the covenant is
[15:19] infinite,
[15:20] right? It's not just, you know, from
[15:22] here to there. It's all the way around.
[15:24] And as you lift up, this is man, I about
[15:27] I woke my poor wife up cuz I almost
[15:29] launched out of bed this morning when I
[15:30] read this. Do you know when I'm reading
[15:34] about this, there's a term that pilots
[15:36] have from a rainbow from above. Do you
[15:39] know, does anybody know what pilots call
[15:40] a rainbow that you can? It's called a
[15:43] glory.
[15:44] Amen.
[15:45] It's called a glory. That when you're
[15:47] looking from above and you see a
[15:48] circular rainbow, that is called a
[15:51] glory.
[15:52] Now,
[15:54] I want to read something.
[15:59] Uh, pull up Ezekiel 1 and verse 26,
[16:01] please.
[16:04] Um, and I can start reading it here.
[16:09] Um,
[16:17] do we got nothing?
[16:19] What was it?
[16:20] Ezekiel 126.
[16:25] And I'll I'll let them catch up. I'm
[16:27] just going to start reading. Um, this is
[16:30] verse 26. And above the firmament that
[16:32] was over their head was the likeness of
[16:33] a throne, as the appearance of a
[16:36] sapphire stone. and upon the likeness of
[16:38] the throne was the likeness as the
[16:40] appearance of a man upon it. Verse 27.
[16:44] And I saw as the color of amber, as the
[16:47] appearance of fire round about within
[16:50] it, from the appearance of his loins
[16:54] even upward, and from the appearance of
[16:56] his loins even downward, I saw as it
[16:59] were the appearance of fire, and it had
[17:03] brightness round about it. Verse 28.
[17:07] As the appearance of the bow that is in
[17:09] the cloud in the day of rain, so was the
[17:12] appearance of the brightness roundout.
[17:15] And uh this was the appearance of the
[17:18] likeness of the glory of the Lord. And
[17:21] when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and
[17:24] I heard a voice of one that spake. Okay,
[17:26] so here's Ezekiel saying that the glory
[17:29] of the Lord that goes all the way around
[17:31] his throne
[17:32] is is a rainbow,
[17:34] right? that huh from above the rainbow
[17:37] is a circle that God's glory and and
[17:41] notice in Revelations chapter 10 when he
[17:42] has a rainbow above his head it's not a
[17:46] bow it's a halo
[17:49] right it's you know the the rainbow goes
[17:51] all the way around and it's his glory
[17:54] right notice tying it back to where we
[17:57] started
[17:58] the rainbow is made of the word revealed
[18:03] through his people. That's what the
[18:06] rainbow is made out of,
[18:07] right? That God's glory is made of the
[18:12] word revealed through his people. That's
[18:14] the halo over his head. That's what he
[18:17] he surrounds his throne in is the word
[18:20] revealed through his people. His people
[18:23] living the word.
[18:25] Okay.
[18:26] Could you please pull up 1 Corinthians
[18:30] 11 and uh let me see where it's uh what
[18:34] the exact verse is. 11:7 1 Corinthians
[18:38] 11:7.
[18:48] For a man indeed ought not to cover his
[18:51] head for as much as he is the image and
[18:53] glory of God. But the woman is the glory
[18:56] of the man.
[18:57] Amen.
[18:58] Okay. The bride of Christ again here
[19:00] even even in the way we live and dress
[19:03] you are reflecting that the bride of
[19:05] Christ is the glory of God. Right? That
[19:08] he would wrap himself in a rainbow that
[19:10] he would clothe himself in a rainbow is
[19:12] the word made revealed through you.
[19:15] That's what his glory is.
[19:16] Amen.
[19:18] And because why the his bride is his
[19:22] glory, right? The glory of the man and
[19:24] his is his bride.
[19:26] The um
[19:34] this is
[19:37] this is uh so
[19:41] key I think because even even it goes so
[19:44] far as notice when we said that the that
[19:46] the earth is surrounded by this rainbow
[19:48] right surrounded by the glory right the
[19:50] people God's people even so much in in
[19:53] uh in Revelations where it says he that
[19:55] letth will let until he be taken out of
[19:57] the way. Right? That the covenant, the
[19:59] covenant of the blood covers the earth
[20:02] so long as the bride is on the earth.
[20:04] And when the bride goes up, so does that
[20:06] blood covenant. It is taken out of the
[20:08] way because she's the covenant on the
[20:11] earth.
[20:12] She's the manifestation of that
[20:13] covenant. And when she goes, so does the
[20:15] covenant, right? God's glory goes with
[20:17] her,
[20:18] right? the um
[20:22] the And so now
[20:25] with all of this in mind,
[20:28] now do we see why it is so insidious
[20:34] to associate this covenant, this glory,
[20:36] this rainbow with something called
[20:40] pride,
[20:42] right? That here's Lucifer, right? I
[20:45] said it like this one time. If God is
[20:47] love, then Lucifer is pride, right? If
[20:50] God can be defined as love, then that's
[20:53] the defining feature of Lucifer is
[20:54] pride.
[20:56] Okay? And so, and he's going to raise
[20:58] himself up and take God's throne. He's
[21:00] going to take the place of God. So, what
[21:01] is he going to do? He's going to clothe
[21:02] himself in glory just like God clothed
[21:05] himself in glory. He's going to use a
[21:07] rainbow. Interesting thing about that,
[21:08] just as a side note, notice on the on
[21:10] the rainbow flag, they're all straight
[21:11] lines. It's not an arch.
[21:14] It has a beginning. It has an ending.
[21:15] They will never loop back around.
[21:17] Amen.
[21:17] That is a temporary, finite, doomed
[21:20] pride,
[21:21] doomed glory, right? It will terminate.
[21:26] Amen.
[21:27] God's rainbow does not. Okay. Second of
[21:30] all, notice I said that the that the
[21:33] glory of God is his church,
[21:36] right? It's his bride. It's the it's his
[21:38] word, the word made flesh and real in
[21:41] her. And then revelation through that.
[21:45] So what is Lucifer doing in this day?
[21:48] He's building a church, right? The
[21:50] entire church world will become sat.
[21:53] It's that's Satan's bride, right? That
[21:55] he will incarnate himself in a man of
[21:57] sin and surround himself in a church.
[22:00] Yeah.
[22:00] That's what he's there to do,
[22:02] right? And that's his glory. That's and
[22:05] and you can and it reflects him and
[22:08] everything that he is I mean the the
[22:10] glittering cathedrals and man it's it's
[22:12] crazy. You see um in this day like you
[22:18] you know there when I was my whole life
[22:20] it was never you never associated the
[22:23] politics with religion. It was just
[22:25] never in America especially you know we
[22:28] have separation of church and state and
[22:29] it was but anymore like you can't hardly
[22:31] listen to a political commentator you
[22:34] know half the political commentators in
[22:35] the country and they're all talking
[22:36] about religion. It's all integally
[22:39] linked with religion. And how many
[22:42] people It is stunning to me how this
[22:45] there's a massive shift of people going
[22:48] back to the Catholic Church.
[22:50] Yeah.
[22:50] And you know what the number one thing
[22:52] or at least one of the top reasons that
[22:54] I hear of people turning to the Catholic
[22:57] Church and saying that's the real church
[22:59] and and turning away from Protestantism.
[23:02] It's because well the Catholics and all
[23:05] these churches, God is beautiful. God is
[23:07] all the most beautiful things is in
[23:09] nature and God is in nature and that's
[23:11] beautiful. And so people building
[23:13] beautiful churches just shows that God
[23:14] is in those churches.
[23:16] Wow.
[23:17] Because it's beautiful. It's glittering
[23:18] massive cathedral stained glass, right?
[23:21] Beautiful artwork that you know you know
[23:23] and they'll criticize the the
[23:25] Protestants and say, "Oh, well, you
[23:26] know, we have all these beautiful
[23:27] paintings of people pouring out their
[23:28] their worship and devotion to the Lord
[23:30] in all this beautiful artwork and you
[23:32] guys say it's paganism." which I mean
[23:35] some regards it is but the point is
[23:37] there's a whole movement in this day and
[23:39] age to bring beauty to religion
[23:42] to bring beauty you know these massive
[23:44] cathedrals and and big spectacular
[23:46] things they want to beautify it because
[23:48] it's it's it's Satan glorifying himself
[23:53] it's building glory unto something false
[23:57] right but in this day and age where
[24:00] where the bride is called to is not some
[24:04] man-made glory,
[24:06] right?
[24:06] It's not some man-made architecture.
[24:08] It's not paintings and and murals and
[24:11] stained glass. That's not where God
[24:14] finds glory because that's the handiwork
[24:17] of man,
[24:18] right? Where God finds glory is in
[24:20] people who have yielded themselves to
[24:23] the word. Who've com kicked out
[24:25] everything of themselves and taken only
[24:27] the word and said, "Lord, you fill me
[24:29] all the way and let my life come 100% in
[24:33] line with the word that I can be nothing
[24:35] short of the word made flesh again." And
[24:38] that will create a beauty that no man
[24:40] can replicate,
[24:41] right? That will create I mean, look,
[24:43] you know, the great cathedral Notre Dame
[24:45] can burn down,
[24:47] right? But yeah, you can burn this
[24:48] temple to the ground all you want. It
[24:50] will still give God glory no matter what
[24:52] happens. It will rise again and there
[24:55] will be an eternal glory that comes from
[24:57] it.
[24:58] Okay?
[24:59] The the the the the
[25:03] glory of God is his bride. It is in his
[25:07] church and the yielding of her vessel to
[25:11] the full word of God.
[25:13] Amen.
[25:14] And that's where we quit. Amen.
[25:17] Let's let's stand and have a dismissal
[25:19] prayer.
[25:22] Father, Lord, we thank you for this word
[25:26] that you've given us this morning. Trust
[25:28] that it might bless somebody, might
[25:29] encourage somebody, might give them uh
[25:33] an encouragement of whatever they may
[25:35] face, that they would be able to hold to
[25:37] a promise. Lord, I ask that you would be
[25:39] with us throughout the remainder of the
[25:40] service into the song service as we
[25:42] would worship you. that we would
