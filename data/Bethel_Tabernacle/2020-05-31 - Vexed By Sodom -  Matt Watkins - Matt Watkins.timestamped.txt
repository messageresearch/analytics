[0:00] we'll just read verse seven got me
[0:10] brothers doesn't sound like a moan here
[0:12] yeah alright amen
[0:17] I'd like to speak to you here this
[0:19] morning and teach on this subject that I
[0:22] the Lord put upon my heart for the
[0:24] brothers yesterday in the breakfast and
[0:26] so we're gonna this carry that and this
[0:28] morning do a little bit more teaching on
[0:30] it you could go in and display that
[0:32] brother Joe that title slide I would
[0:34] like to speak to you on vexed by Sodom
[0:37] and subtitled this clean in a dirty aged
[0:42] second Peter chapter two let's just
[0:44] begin reading here at verse five
[0:46] speaking of Noah spared not the old
[0:48] world but saved Noah the eighth person a
[0:51] preacher of righteousness bringing in
[0:53] the flood brothers you might want to
[0:54] check the headphones for the Matthew
[0:56] because I don't think I'm on here so you
[1:00] might want to turn me on here I it's not
[1:02] on it all up here so let's continue here
[1:05] verse 6 turning the cities of Sodom and
[1:07] Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with
[1:10] an overthrow making them an example unto
[1:12] those that after should live ungodly
[1:15] notice this verse 7 this is where we
[1:17] want to draw our inferences emphasis
[1:19] here and deliver just lot vexed with the
[1:22] filthy conversation of the wicked for
[1:24] that righteous man dwelling among them
[1:27] and seeing and hearing vexed his
[1:30] righteous soul there we go now we got
[1:32] power vexed his righteous soul from day
[1:38] to day with their unlawful deeds you can
[1:40] be seated this morning Luke chapter 17
[1:44] turned there in your Bible with me but
[1:46] Joe you got that PowerPoint so we'd like
[1:50] to have that up we're going to use that
[1:52] here just right away as soon as we can
[1:53] get it Luke chapter 17 is a very
[1:57] familiar scripture to us and I just want
[1:59] to draw some emphasis from it today and
[2:01] particularly verse 30 but let's start
[2:04] here at verse 28 it says likewise also
[2:08] as it was in the days of lot they did
[2:11] eat they drank they
[2:13] they sold they planted they builded but
[2:17] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[2:19] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[2:22] and destroyed them all
[2:24] even thus shall it be and the day when
[2:27] the Son of Man is revealed and we know
[2:31] that that's the day and age that you and
[2:34] I are living in and I believe that it's
[2:36] very just a picture perfect description
[2:39] of the age that you're living in today
[2:42] we are truly in the days of lot again
[2:46] and a lot of times when we think of lot
[2:48] we think the days of Sodom we think of
[2:50] Sodom we think of homosexuality and
[2:53] that's that's a significance there for
[2:56] sure but really Sodom was a a city that
[3:00] was overflowing with evil it was and it
[3:04] was a depictive of more than just a
[3:06] homosexual agenda but a wicked age a
[3:09] wicked world Amen a wicked time to live
[3:13] in and the Bible says that the the the
[3:15] sins of Sodom were so great that God's
[3:18] wrath poured out upon Sodom and he
[3:21] destroyed it by fire and brimstone and
[3:24] so you know I think there's there's a
[3:27] lot that could be said here today we
[3:29] wanted this teach on this just here for
[3:31] a moment particularly slot but we know
[3:34] that the Bible calls lot a righteous man
[3:37] I'm gonna need that PowerPoint brothers
[3:39] as soon as you can display it we're
[3:41] gonna need it I don't know if this is on
[3:43] maybe the screens not on but we know
[3:46] that the Bible calls lot a just man you
[3:49] can see it here in 2nd Peter I want you
[3:51] to keep your Bible especially since they
[3:53] don't have it there on the screen yet
[3:54] this bring up 2nd Peter chapter 2 and
[3:56] keep your place there it's amazing
[4:00] because what's clear when you think of
[4:03] the world that you live in today is the
[4:07] world is falling apart and I believe
[4:09] that that is a statement that brother
[4:12] Jason Amar's made that's meant so much
[4:15] to to us and we've repeated it many
[4:17] times is that you're living in a
[4:20] diseased world and you know when brother
[4:24] Jason said that he said you're living in
[4:25] a diseased world
[4:26] you've got to remember you're walking
[4:29] and living working learning amongst
[4:33] diseased people now we know that that
[4:36] disease are talking about is a sin
[4:38] disease and so your children go to
[4:41] school amongst in a diseased atmosphere
[4:44] where a education system has shifted and
[4:48] turned their backs on God and teaches
[4:50] especially in the public school
[4:53] curriculum teaches against God and and
[4:57] gives a very secular psychology to
[5:00] children and so it's a world that's
[5:02] falling apart very much like Sodom was
[5:05] falling apart we could say today this
[5:07] world's falling apart no question and so
[5:10] the generation that we live in is
[5:13] becoming vile and more vile by the day
[5:17] and I think that it's a it's a it's a
[5:19] world that's losing their faith in God
[5:21] as we just pointed out God has been put
[5:24] pushed out put out and you know we could
[5:27] see it here in South Carolina and let me
[5:29] just tell you today that you're living
[5:31] and what's known as the Bible Belt
[5:33] you're living in a conservative state
[5:35] with a conservative governor you know
[5:39] and and even with that you know Buford
[5:42] being a democratic City but even with
[5:45] that we can see you imagine if we here
[5:48] can see the effects of a demonic agenda
[5:53] how much more they could see it in other
[5:55] places in the world you go to California
[5:58] or you go to Colorado you go to places
[6:00] that lean really hard left and and I'm
[6:03] not getting them pointed out any
[6:05] political you know given any political
[6:08] credit here to one party both of them
[6:10] were corrupt and they're not the answer
[6:12] and they've tried to give the answer and
[6:14] they they've thought it would it would
[6:15] be placed in a man or a party and
[6:18] they've realized that's failed and the
[6:20] world is is losing their faith in God
[6:22] honestly you're let's say faithless
[6:25] generation and people may have hold on
[6:28] to cling to religion and hold on to
[6:30] religion because of tradition but really
[6:34] the they've lost their faith in the Word
[6:37] of God because the Word of God is
[6:39] regarded today the Bible even as a
[6:42] infallible book that's the source of all
[6:44] life it's regarded as just religion and
[6:47] when you have that you get a world
[6:49] that's faithless Bible says faith cometh
[6:53] by hearing hearing of the word of God so
[6:55] if you're not hearing the Word of God
[6:57] how can you expect to have faith
[6:59] that's how faith comes so we have this
[7:02] title here today and the remote here let
[7:08] me just turn it on we have this title
[7:09] vexed by Sodom and then I've subtitled
[7:13] this clean in a dirty age and I'd like
[7:17] to look at what it means here to be
[7:19] clean amongst a dirty age and I think
[7:24] that the question could be asked you
[7:27] know as we just go through this as has
[7:29] two brothers yesterday
[7:30] it's sort of a rhetorical question but
[7:32] is it even possible to be clean in such
[7:35] a wicked world is it possible to have
[7:38] righteousness to have a people that have
[7:41] zeal for the Lord in such a wicked age
[7:43] or you know or is it inevitable you know
[7:46] that the world's so dark and it's so
[7:49] dirty and it's so wicked that it's just
[7:52] you know we're just gonna have to we're
[7:54] gonna have to sort of slide with the
[7:55] world as they go down we go down with it
[7:57] and I think we know the answer to that
[8:00] question it's not only possible to live
[8:03] holy and clean by the power of the Holy
[8:06] Spirit but actually your your to be
[8:09] growing in holiness growing in
[8:11] righteousness amen and so I think when
[8:16] we look at here at lot what I want to
[8:18] just point out a few things before we
[8:19] begin the the the Bible uses a word here
[8:24] that I like to use and I'm not I guess
[8:26] this doesn't work with Joe so go to the
[8:28] next slide I forgot this one's not
[8:30] connected to I don't think to
[8:32] propresenter but the word this is second
[8:35] Peter to seven the scripture that we
[8:37] read it I want to teach on it just here
[8:38] for a moment in verse 7 it says and
[8:41] delivered just lot vexed with the filthy
[8:44] conversation of the wicked and so we
[8:49] look at this this first go to the next
[8:52] slide here this
[8:53] no no you went too far it yep so this
[8:55] word here it's amazing because this is
[8:58] the word the Greek word that is used
[9:00] here when it says here and in that he
[9:04] delivered just lot you just read that in
[9:07] verse 7 he delivered just lot and so
[9:11] this word that we find let me find my
[9:14] place here in my notes this word that we
[9:18] find for for delivered means to draw
[9:24] oneself to pull oneself to rescue or to
[9:29] snatch up to draw or rescue a person -
[9:33] and for the deliverer now it's amazing
[9:36] because when you think about this here
[9:38] God is this is a in other words this is
[9:42] a last-ditch effort to save this
[9:45] individual this is what exactly what the
[9:47] Bible saying that God delivered he
[9:50] snatched him out and the picture that we
[9:52] had at the beginning will show you that
[9:54] that the angel came to lot and said he
[9:56] scape and come thither you know why
[9:58] won't you escape you want to die here
[10:01] in the city go back by the Jil one one
[10:03] one slide noted to the word just you
[10:06] should have a slide for the word just
[10:08] too too far back one more so this is
[10:12] what the scripture means when it says
[10:15] that he was just it doesn't mean just in
[10:19] the sense of only but it says that he
[10:23] was a righteous man so the Bible says
[10:25] that this this is what this word means
[10:28] in Greek it means right or judicial
[10:31] approval now that's important because we
[10:34] know the story of lot and we know how it
[10:36] goes that he would you know he goes into
[10:39] complete sin and and he you know we
[10:42] don't want to even get into that here
[10:43] today but we know the way lot we know
[10:45] the way that Lots life went and it would
[10:49] be anything other than righteous but
[10:51] what's important here is the Bible says
[10:53] he was just in other words he was
[10:56] judicially approved now that approval
[11:01] came not by lot but by his association
[11:03] with a important man
[11:05] named Abraham and so lots righteousness
[11:10] was attributed to him for the
[11:12] Association being Abraham's family we
[11:16] know that lot lived amongst with Abraham
[11:19] he sojourned with Abraham he you know I
[11:23] would say he worshiped with Abraham
[11:26] you know he's seen how Abraham worshiped
[11:28] and he knew that they had came out of
[11:31] her for a purpose what was the purpose
[11:34] for leaving Earth was it just to go
[11:36] aimlessly on a journey it was for a son
[11:39] that was the purpose your to lead
[11:43] because your seed shall be more
[11:47] numerable than the stars of the sky in
[11:49] the in the sand of the seashore and I'm
[11:51] gonna bless thee and through thy seed
[11:53] Abraham all the nations of the earth
[11:56] will be blessed now this was the purpose
[11:58] that God had in having Abraham and lot
[12:03] leave her so that purpose immediately as
[12:09] we know begins to fade from lot's mind I
[12:13] think that's very clear that you could
[12:15] see and even in lot he's a righteous man
[12:19] he's a just man the Bible calls him a
[12:21] just man I Cyro tit this way and I
[12:25] believe it's it can have such an
[12:26] important significance he's a righteous
[12:29] man living below what he knows is true
[12:32] and it starts with the desire it didn't
[12:38] start with a house and Sodom catch
[12:41] follow me here Lots story doesn't start
[12:45] in Sodom and no-one's story starts in
[12:48] Sodom and ends in Sodom and so it
[12:52] doesn't start there it started with
[12:54] Abraham it started as a what the Bible
[12:57] calls
[12:58] notice what Thayer says he's approved by
[13:01] God righteous just in the eyes of God so
[13:07] he's accounted he's judicial that's what
[13:09] that's what justification he's justified
[13:11] it's a legal status he's justified he's
[13:15] considered righteous in the eyes of God
[13:18] and so the Bible says here
[13:19] Peter 2:7 and God delivered just
[13:24] righteous righteous lot and so the Bible
[13:28] says that he had chosen this is remember
[13:31] he didn't start and sought him he
[13:34] started with Abraham and you say brother
[13:35] Matt where how did he get from Abraham
[13:38] dwelling with Abraham with the purpose
[13:41] for a promised son to living in Sodom
[13:45] and his life ends up at the gate of the
[13:50] city of Sodom the Bible is what the
[13:52] Bible says in Genesis says that he's
[13:55] sitting at the gate of Sodom now that
[13:59] has the significance that means he has
[14:01] political status when you dwell at the
[14:04] gate that means you're considered a man
[14:06] with wisdom you know just like and the
[14:09] you know the time gone by you'd have the
[14:12] you know the the older men the elder men
[14:15] you know together you know and there was
[14:18] wisdom in that and their people would
[14:20] come to them for counsel people would
[14:22] come them even the judges judicially
[14:23] were had to be of a certain age so you
[14:26] say was that significant visit its it
[14:28] tells you something about lot that he
[14:31] wasn't just a believer living in the
[14:34] world and is separated to himself but he
[14:38] had immersed himself in Sodom culture
[14:42] and so it's amazing here when you look
[14:45] at this he starts with a desire the
[14:49] Bible says it this way we're gonna just
[14:52] save some time here because we're
[14:53] limited for time this morning we're
[14:55] gonna save some time in turning I'm just
[14:56] gonna quote it for you paraphrasing the
[14:58] Bible says that lot pitched his tent
[15:02] toward Sodom now that that speaks of
[15:06] something he's with Abraham he's not in
[15:08] Sodom yet he's not living there doesn't
[15:10] have a house he's not at the gate back
[15:12] up rewind
[15:13] he starts with his tent pitched toward
[15:17] Sodom so he's a in other words it's
[15:20] speaking of his heart his affection he's
[15:23] longing for something you following me
[15:27] he's desiring for the wrong thing where
[15:30] is Abraham where is Abraham and LA
[15:33] are physically together their hearts
[15:36] could not be more contrary to each other
[15:39] Abraham had a purpose he knew his life
[15:42] had a purpose he knew he was in life for
[15:44] a reason and his reason wasn't worldly
[15:47] his reason was for a promise from
[15:51] Jehovah I hope you're catching it this
[15:52] morning
[15:53] but yet lot though he's physically with
[15:56] him though he's there in person yet his
[15:59] heart was far away from that purpose you
[16:02] know many times people can associate
[16:05] with believers physically be in church
[16:09] but their heart is toward sodomy
[16:13] we know sodomy in a type of the world
[16:16] type of the flesh and so he's a
[16:20] righteous man righteous by justification
[16:23] living with his heart and so lot starts
[16:26] there well anytime the heart turns
[16:29] towards something eventually the feet
[16:31] follow and it doesn't always happen
[16:34] overnight did you catch that it always
[16:38] starts your feet don't walk towards the
[16:40] world without first your heart
[16:42] turning to the world first and there was
[16:45] a long period of time that lot lived in
[16:47] church sat in church associated with
[16:50] Abraham but his heart was already
[16:52] looking to something else and eventually
[16:54] his feet follows and he says I'm gonna
[16:59] go dwell and so lot you think about this
[17:02] just in retrospect he chooses a city
[17:05] that is that his destiny is judgment its
[17:11] destiny is fire and brimstone its
[17:14] destiny is destruction fast-forward the
[17:20] movie you go to the end before the
[17:22] credits you have a city that's burning
[17:25] and on fire
[17:26] this was the inevitable end of Sodom now
[17:29] let me just bring it to today this
[17:32] nation has an end fast-forward to the
[17:37] end what a brother branham's see the
[17:39] last vision he said the sick that a
[17:41] sixth vision second-to-last he said was
[17:44] women in the morality the degradation of
[17:46] the morals of a woman he said it was a
[17:49] complete striptease to where she was
[17:51] just almost naked had nothing on now
[17:53] that's the words of a prophet in a
[17:55] vision and that wasn't true in 1965 he
[18:00] might have thought it was brother
[18:01] Branham even there and his own mind
[18:03] thought it was true my brother my sister
[18:05] we're seeing the fulfillment of that
[18:07] vision right here in 2020 the
[18:10] degradation the morality it was
[18:12] something of just like in the beginning
[18:14] and with Eve now in this last generation
[18:18] brother IRA preaches a message
[18:20] Satan's Eden and he said this is his
[18:22] Eden more than ever before he says he's
[18:24] seen the degradation of the morals not
[18:26] just of women that was that was that was
[18:28] symbolic but it was the morality the the
[18:31] the morals of the entire world had had
[18:34] to hit such a low ebb brother Brennan
[18:36] says then the seventh vision he said
[18:39] I've seen America in ruins and ashes he
[18:42] said just smoldering like an atomic bomb
[18:45] had went off so you say brother Matt
[18:48] what is that that's the end the
[18:52] inevitable destiny for this nation for
[18:56] this world so I ask you why would you
[19:01] ever choose to immerse yourself in this
[19:03] culture when the end is inevitable lot
[19:10] made a choice to associate now I know
[19:13] that we're in this world but we're not
[19:15] of this world and we don't immerse
[19:18] ourselves in the culture were not like
[19:20] the rest of the world were pilgrims were
[19:23] Abraham's seed pilgrims strangers lot
[19:27] chooses a city that's ultimate
[19:29] destination is destruction its judgment
[19:33] and he and he says this is where I'm
[19:34] gonna I'm gonna inhabit this place I'm
[19:36] gonna live her I'm gonna dwell here and
[19:39] so so you know this is exactly what
[19:42] happens is that the Bible says that it
[19:45] vexed his righteous soul
[19:47] it's 10:50 we're not gonna get anywhere
[19:49] near done this morning and so go to the
[19:53] next slide by the joke this is what this
[19:56] word vex means now notice this here now
[20:00] remember Paul's that if you could hear
[20:01] for a moment go back to the word deliver
[20:04] to brother Joe Buddhist we're not gonna
[20:05] speed up we're gonna slow down here from
[20:08] it I don't want to I'm not gonna get to
[20:10] where one of the goes so we're just
[20:11] gonna go we'll carry this on through
[20:12] another Sunday so this word delivered
[20:17] this is amazing because it as we read it
[20:22] already it means to be I don't know how
[20:24] to pronounce that Greek word but it
[20:25] means to be snatched it's speaking of a
[20:28] last-ditch effort God makes a last-ditch
[20:31] effort to save this man now he lives
[20:34] there and and you and we don't I don't
[20:36] know the Bible doesn't go to what degree
[20:38] lot became backslidden lot became
[20:41] lustful and sinful and sensual I don't
[20:44] know the Bible just says that he lives
[20:46] in Sodom but here's what we know he said
[20:49] he's a gate keeper as we said he's in a
[20:50] man of importance he's when the angel
[20:52] comes to him he's sitting at the gate of
[20:54] the city and so the but but God makes a
[20:58] last-ditch effort to save this man right
[21:02] before destruction I thought about that
[21:04] and thought you know if you're God's Eve
[21:06] gotta make a last-ditch effort to save
[21:09] you before destruction I'm glad for that
[21:11] kind of a mercy and it may be your own
[21:14] life it may be your last breath it may
[21:16] be your deathbed it whatever it takes
[21:19] God was brother branham said it this way
[21:21] God will get his man so Peter uses this
[21:26] word and he says he delivered he said he
[21:29] delivered him so God reaches into the
[21:32] sewer of Sodom and he saves pulls this
[21:36] man out he snatches him out Jude speaks
[21:39] of this and says save them and he says
[21:43] snatch them snatching them fresh queuing
[21:45] them that's the word rescue them from
[21:47] the fire but don't have your garments
[21:49] spotted with the world and so he
[21:52] snatches lot his family out right before
[21:55] judgment strikes Sodom and so it's it's
[22:01] lot is so spiritually his conscience is
[22:05] so spiritually seared you know that
[22:09] because the angel has to repeat it
[22:11] multiple times
[22:13] says he scape toward Luke I think it's
[22:16] Chapter seven says he escaped and come
[22:18] the angel said escape and come thither
[22:19] and the Bible says count yourself be
[22:23] ready be sober at all times it says that
[22:26] you may be accounted worthy to escape
[22:28] all these things all the judgments and
[22:31] stand before the Son of man it's a
[22:33] reference to this Luke it's a reference
[22:36] to lot here and and and the Son of man
[22:39] had revealed himself to Abraham already
[22:41] in the form of Melchizedek and so a lot
[22:44] as the Bible says the angel said escape
[22:47] and come thither and he's so seared
[22:49] angel eyes to repeat and finally to
[22:51] snatch him out snatch his family and
[22:53] even the effects of so went into his own
[22:57] wife his mate that she turns her back
[23:01] and we know the story she turns back and
[23:04] looks at Sodom and turns to a pillar of
[23:06] salt
[23:07] and so he he's dreary the Bible has this
[23:13] this way to pointed out that he's drug
[23:15] out of Sodom
[23:16] he's drug out of he was so entangled
[23:18] this is exactly what Sodom does Sodom a
[23:22] Masada this is exactly what the world
[23:23] does it's like a vine it just attaches
[23:27] itself and you're so attached you're not
[23:30] thinking straight
[23:31] and he's saying a lot come on what are
[23:33] you doing this God's about to destroy
[23:36] this city so heed this word here
[23:38] delivered him I want you to catch that
[23:40] it's to snatch up to draw or rescue a
[23:44] person - and for the deliverer there you
[23:47] know if God would not have intervened a
[23:49] lot would have stayed and died in this
[23:52] city if God had to intervene and so he
[23:57] he saves him he pulls him we don't want
[24:01] to cover that again he's now I want you
[24:04] to I want you to catch this here the
[24:05] next word there vex brother Joe look at
[24:09] look in your Bible a 2nd Peter chapter 2
[24:11] verse 7 let's read it one more time it
[24:13] says and delivered just lot it's not
[24:15] just righteous law vexed with the filthy
[24:18] conversation of the wicked and so so
[24:24] he's the Bible says he says lot was very
[24:27] this word vex is extremely important and
[24:30] we're just going to take a pulse here
[24:32] but it's extremely important because
[24:34] it's it's the Greek word and I this
[24:38] maybe I don't speak Greek so it may be
[24:40] pronounced wrong cat upon EO is the
[24:43] Greek word and I didn't have the lexicon
[24:46] I used a different one there so you
[24:48] actually see in the Greek it's the
[24:50] present passive participle it means to
[24:53] tire down the notice this it means to
[24:56] tire down so when it remember before you
[24:59] read this think in your mind it vexed
[25:01] his righteous soul when you think of vex
[25:03] you've all maybe often thought of all
[25:05] lot just went oh man this worlds are so
[25:07] bad oh I'm just so grieved by all the
[25:10] sin that's not at all what it means when
[25:11] it says lots soul was vexed it means
[25:15] that lots righteousness whatever he had
[25:19] whatever he had gained with Abraham
[25:22] whatever he had learned with Abraham
[25:25] whatever spirituality he had garnered
[25:28] for himself whatever he went and sought
[25:30] him with the zeal the passion for the
[25:32] random said he was a pastor of a church
[25:34] whatever zeal he had by immersing
[25:37] himself in the culture of Sodom he had
[25:41] it had worn him out it had tired him
[25:46] down look at this exhaust with labor to
[25:48] afflict or oppress with evil to make
[25:51] trouble for to treat roughly this it had
[25:53] he had battered this man lot it had
[25:56] vexed his righteous soul that cat upon
[26:00] EO is a compound word of the Greek word
[26:03] kata
[26:03] and the Greek word Peniel the word kata
[26:06] means total dominance or total control
[26:09] and and and and so it carries the idea
[26:13] of domination pani o means to work to
[26:16] the point of exhaustion so when you put
[26:18] those two words you have this word a
[26:20] compound word here which means total and
[26:23] complete exhaustion like after work
[26:25] you're just completely exhausted this is
[26:28] the description of lot he had so
[26:32] immersed himself and he was so vexed
[26:35] with Sodom it had taken all of the
[26:38] righteousness out of him
