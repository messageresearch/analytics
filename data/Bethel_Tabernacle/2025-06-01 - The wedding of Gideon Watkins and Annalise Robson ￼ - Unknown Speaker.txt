[Music] Um [Music] [Music] [Music] That's fine. [Music] I don't know. I don't know. [Music] Drop it off. Okay. [Music] Congratulations. [Music] [Music] There she is. That's pretty good. [Music] [Music] I don't know if [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] You got enough battery on everything? I'm outside. I I got two. I've got a big battery. I'll go get that right now. I don't think I think we're only get going like five minutes. I think we're getting going. Another [Music] [Music] Michelle girl. You want her? [Music] What am I That's what [Music] Look at that. All [Music] right. Mom's open. [Music] Hello. Good. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] What [Laughter] are you doing? [Music] Heat Holy. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh my god. [Music] [Music] Don't be afraid to come out. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Keep checking. [Music] [Music] [Music] All right. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] friends and family gathered here today in the sight of God and this company who loves and cherishes Gideon and Anna. But there's something very special, very sacred, a covenant between a man and a woman that's by the people who have shaped them, loved them, raised them, and prayed for this very moment to happen. We know that marriage is not just a beautiful ceremony, but it's a divine institution created by God himself. Apostle Paul taught us that marriage is honorable and holy. It's a picture of God's union between him and his bride. Jesus honored marriage and he performed his first miracle at a wedding. So, we know he celebrates these kind of moments. We recognize today that true love, the kind that last for eternity, is in and of itself a miracle. It's more than affection. It's more than attraction. It's a deep sacred love that only God can give and he pours it into our hearts by his spirit. This kind of love where one man loves one woman, one woman loves one man exclusively, faithfully, and forever. It's not something that we enter into lightly, but it should be entered into and approached very reverently with prayer and with deep respect for the one who designed it. Today, my son Gideon and Anna have come not just to be celebrated, but to be joined together in this holy covenant before God. At this time, if there's anyone who knows of any reason why these two should not be joined together, you're asked to speak now or forever hold your peace. And also, I ask this of both of you, Gideon and Anna. You know, of any reason of this union would be unlawful before God speak. Who gives this woman to be married to this man? turn face each other. Today is a very very special day for me and um it's been quite emotional already and for me and Rachel just to see Gideon here and Anna all of our here. We had just a moment before we came out just to in celebration of this moment that we're sharing in as I have the privilege of burying my oldest son Gideon that we are so proud of what the Lord has done in his life. Gideon, this is an awesome moment. What an incredible moment. One that really is better than any Hallmark story. one that really only the Lord could have put together. Gideon, it was just last October, just last October that Anna came into your life. I can't speak very much because that was very much helpful at work very quick and the arrow of love struck your heart and uh Anna he just simply hasn't been able to think about anything else but you from that moment getting me and mom vividly remember you may be seated here we vividly remember that night if you did just uh last October almost 2:00 in the morning. We were exhausted, ready to go to bed. Didn't want to do anything but go to sleep. Exhausted from just the day. But Gideon wasn't going to take no for an answer. He had to see us. He had to see us right then and there. We had to sit in the car. He had to tell us because he was bursting and exploding with uh joy. He wanted to tell us to say get dad, mom, I know that I know that I know that he said it 10 times that I have found the one God has for me. And we knew that you knew that you knew that you knew that you had found the right one. But Gideon, you had just met her just at that moment. What we said, Gideon, are you sure? But boy, he was sure. Dad, I know. I know. God has shown me this is the real one. And you know what? You were right, Gideon. You were right. Anna, it was just this February, just this February or January, the end of January, you were surprised on a trip to North Carolina when Gideon asked you to marry him. I'll never forget that moment you guys return home from that trip, us knowing you were engaged, and you all come in the door 10:00, all the kids filed in, and here comes Gideon. And something happened that uh I can't explain. just as the Lord. But when you walked in the door, I can describe it as is that the way I looked at you was not as my son's girlfriend or fiance, but it felt like one of my daughters. That was a very special moment. And I know that God has truly brought grandson life when he gave us. Brother Brandham, in the sermon, Kinsman Redeemer 1960 says, "Hatred had a beginning, so it has to have an end. Love had no beginning, so it has no end. Hatred is forever. Love is eternal. Hatred begins and hatred will end. Lover love never did begin. It will never end. See, it was eternal. And when a man loves a woman and marries her just because she's pretty, there will be an end to that. But when a man finds a woman that he loves, he don't know why, but he loves her. She finds a man that she loves. No matter what he looks like, he he loves her. She loves him. That's an eternal fate. In glory, death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity. They stepped out into the space of time and will return back to eternity. Eternity is dropped down into a body called time. Then it goes right back up. [Music] This time we're going to just have to repeat after another. Gideon, will you have this woman Hannah to be your wed wife to live with her in the holy covenant of marriage? Will you love her, comfort her, honor and protect her in sickness and in health, in joy and in sorrow, and forsaking all others? Anna, will you have this man Gideon to be your wed husband to live with him in the holy covenant of marriage? Will you love him, support him, respect and stand beside him in sickness and in health, in joy and in sorrow, and forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live. I do. I want you to repeat after me. I Gideon take you, Hannah. I Gideon, take you Hannah, to be my wed wife. to be my wed wife. According to all of God's holy ordinance. according to all of God's holy ordinance. I promise to lead you to the leadership from the Lord. with the leadership from the Lord. with love and humility from this day forward. with love and humility from this day forward. To have and to hold. To have and to hold. To love and to cherish. To love and to cherish. For better or for worse. For better or for worse. For richer, for poor. For richer. And sickness and health. And sickness and health. I take that. Repeat after me. I am to I am to be to be my wed husband. to be my wed husband. According to God's holy ordinance according to God or to submit myself to your leadership to submit yourself to your leadership as unto the Lord and unto the Lord. And to walk beside you as my covenant to [Music] walk in this [Music] sickness until death do [Music] Maybe that's [Music] [Music] These rings are simple in design but rich in meaning. They're circles without an end symbolizing love that is unending and eternal. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessing on these rings, symbols of your eternal love. Lord, may they be a host of the sacred promises that are made this day. Bless this Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Repeat after with this ring I be wet in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ with this I the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's pray Jesus nameus that cannot be broken. Seal this covenant, Lord, by your spirit. May their marriage be a testimony of your grace in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Because Gideon and and Anna have made their vows to each other, have sealed them with rings, and have committed yourselves to this covenant before God. These witnesses, by the authority given to me as a servant of the Lord, I now pronounce you husband and wife in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh yeah, you can kiss your [Music] Family and friends, it is my great honor and joy to present to you Mr. and Miss Gideon [Applause] Watkins. Work on the road. They took forever on the road like memories of the miles we shared between the place you learn to say your prayers. The place I took to praying in breaking down my road dreams. Come before we ever made a direction and never so my arms get And I ain't a lion and I'm all yours. You're all mine. There ain't two ways around it. There ain't no trying about it. I'm all yours. You're all mine. [Music] [Music] boards. If you're able, you please bring your chair with you to the reception area. Also, the outhouse restroom is located right behind the garage. Yes, absolutely. or you can actually you guys want Hey, bro. in your chair. Good. I agree.
