[22:24] less what the world may do or say

[31:26] but you can I do have it running tonight
[31:28] so you can send it by that send it
[31:31] directly to me amen or by text is just
[31:34] fine also amen want to in fact is when I
[31:38] think about the streaming audience I I
[31:41] think I I should probably greet all of
[31:44] our friends who were formerly bethl
[31:47] Tabernacle Phoenix that was a thing and
[31:50] it was a thing I didn't even know it
[31:52] existed and U somebody told me said you
[31:54] know there's a bethl Tabernacle in
[31:55] Phoenix and I said don't play what are
[31:58] you talking about and sure enough we had
[32:01] uh Saints out there meeting and
[32:02] Gathering and you all know them well and
[32:05] fact is um sister Nicole Jackson will be
[32:07] here with us this weekend and um brother
[32:11] Mike Alderson and his family amen him
[32:14] and sister Jennifer and their children
[32:16] and uh her parents amen um brother Dale
[32:20] and sister Darlene brother John sister
[32:23] Nicole all of that gang that was out
[32:25] there we got to see them while I was
[32:28] they're ministering they go to brother
[32:29] Aaron uh mcgary's now there in Phoenix
[32:32] and so we're I could see they're happy
[32:34] and that made me happy amen so uh just
[32:38] in a conversation talking with them I
[32:40] realized they either figure out a way to
[32:42] stream live or they figure out how to
[32:44] get every single archive because uh you
[32:47] know Sister Darlene she's uh just as
[32:50] adorable as you could imagine as you
[32:52] would know and we're hoping they will
[32:54] come here and visit but she was telling
[32:56] sister Debbie she was saying saying
[32:58] where is stepen
[33:00] Emily and she said oh it was so good to
[33:03] see sister Jean come in and she and we
[33:05] realized you know she was asking about
[33:07] this one and about that one and she
[33:09] pretty much knows everything about us so
[33:11] amen we should all probably turn around
[33:12] wave at the camera but uh we want to
[33:15] greet them in the name of the Lord
[33:17] tonight we had a really wonderful time
[33:19] there with them had a marriage banquet
[33:22] kind of a Sweetheart's banquet on this
[33:24] Saturday night and uh I got to thinking
[33:27] man it's time we have one of those here
[33:29] again amen praise the Lord and uh we got
[33:32] we got uh old married folk that that
[33:35] need some adjustments we got young
[33:37] married folks that uh could probably use
[33:40] some inspiration and we got those who
[33:42] are almost about to get married and are
[33:44] desperate for some instructions so amen
[33:47] we're happy in the Lord Amen brother
[33:49] Caleb's given me the the pump sign back
[33:51] there you knowen he's he's ready amen
[33:54] praise the Lord so so we're looking
[33:57] forward that we might um have some
[34:00] thoughts along that line coming up here
[34:02] pretty soon I want to continue reading
[34:05] in Exodus chapter 7 and uh let's let's
[34:09] read verse three again and then we'll
[34:11] carry on down from there let me get to
[34:14] where I need to
[34:17] be all
[34:20] right so Exodus 7
[34:23] and3 and I will harden Pharaoh's heart
[34:27] and mult multiply Now Catch what he's
[34:29] going to multiply my signs and my
[34:33] wonders in the land of Egypt I'm
[34:37] speaking to you tonight on a title why
[34:40] does God perform the
[34:44] supernatural why does God perform the
[34:48] supernatural verse four but pharoh shall
[34:53] not hearken unto you that I may lay my
[34:56] hand upon on Egypt and bring forth my
[35:00] armies and my people the children of
[35:03] Israel out of the land of Egypt by great
[35:07] judgments so you know Moses you're uh
[35:11] you're going to be so equipped that
[35:14] you're going to be a
[35:16] God and in fact is so strong is going to
[35:19] be the body Ministry at the time of The
[35:21] Exodus that Aaron will be your prophet
[35:26] and so so we realize then that that you
[35:29] say my goodness there's nothing going to
[35:32] stop these these guys I mean this is God
[35:36] and a prophet in the form of a prophet
[35:39] and his brother who's going to end up
[35:41] being in the priesthood you'd think
[35:43] there's no power on Earth that can stop
[35:45] this my goodness when he walks in there
[35:47] the hammer drops the Israel's goingon to
[35:50] they're going to chase Israel out of
[35:52] there and nothing could be further from
[35:54] the
[35:55] truth and in fact is as strong as that
[35:59] dynamic duo were we're not talking about
[36:01] Batman and Robin as strong as that duo
[36:05] were God actually had a greater
[36:09] purpose than just empowering his church
[36:12] he actually was going to get great glory
[36:15] to himself and bring Israel out he
[36:19] doesn't just want him to go out he
[36:22] actually wants to bring them out under
[36:24] judgments see because so so ful had been
[36:29] those ancient Egyptians so you know uh
[36:33] so evil and so wicked and and you don't
[36:35] get by with things like that God
[36:39] talk Amores Not Yet full and that was
[36:43] going to be a judgment on a certain
[36:45] different kind of class but just
[36:47] understand this that God keeps a book of
[36:49] remembrance and he has WR memory when it
[36:53] comes to remembering sin and who's
[36:55] deserving of a thumping
[36:59] amen ironically he has an incredibly
[37:02] short memory once things go under the
[37:05] blood of the
[37:06] lamb and in fact is it goes completely
[37:10] out of existence and even God himself
[37:13] the one and only can't remember it
[37:17] anymore so we read on here but Pharaoh
[37:21] shall not hearken see verse five and the
[37:24] Egyptians shall know that I I am the
[37:28] Lord when I stretch forth my hand upon
[37:32] Egypt and bring out the children of
[37:35] Israel from among them I to me and this
[37:39] is just completely brother Jason there's
[37:41] no quote anywhere even indicating a
[37:43] third cousin to this but I just wonder
[37:46] being a a history Especial student of
[37:49] history of the ancient world
[37:50] particularly you know I wonder if if God
[37:53] took special exception you know to the
[37:55] fact that these Egyptians claimed to
[37:58] have built Enoch's
[38:00] pyramid and I know that they didn't
[38:02] build them They Came Upon them after the
[38:04] flood those things were built uh by an
[38:07] anad deluvian people and Enoch built the
[38:10] greatest one of all of them and for
[38:13] Egypt to you know uh to to usurp that
[38:17] that thing to say we are the greatest
[38:19] culture because look what we did and all
[38:21] they did was stumble upon Enoch's work
[38:23] left behind amen and I wonder sometimes
[38:26] if God took exception to that and and
[38:29] maybe this is exactly why he would even
[38:31] say concerning Pharaoh for this reason
[38:34] have I raised thee up now again that's
[38:36] just brother Jason speculating as a
[38:38] history student so uh you don't have to
[38:41] put that one in your bag at all I mean
[38:43] it it is it is uh I it I am absolutely
[38:47] convinced to my satisfaction
[38:49] historically speaking and I've looked at
[38:51] the evidence in depth they absolutely
[38:54] Came Upon those pyramids they did not
[38:55] build them amen I know egyptologist is
[38:59] that what they're called JD that's what
[39:00] they want to claim but it's not true the
[39:03] actual history and the findings that
[39:06] archaeologists have found already refute
[39:09] that claim see so but you know when you
[39:12] tell a lie long enough the same way
[39:14] after a while it becomes accepted as the
[39:17] truth verse six and Moses and Aaron did
[39:21] as the
[39:22] Lord
[39:24] um let me read five again and the
[39:26] Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord
[39:29] when I stretch forth mine hand upon
[39:32] Egypt and bring out the children of
[39:34] Israel from among them verse six and
[39:36] Moses and Aaron did as the Lord
[39:38] commanded them so did they so the fact
[39:41] that he still won't let him go is not
[39:45] because somebody
[39:47] failed Moses and Aaron did exactly what
[39:52] God told him to do listen friends you're
[39:54] nearing a Third Exodus and I and I know
[39:57] that the devil sometimes looks like he's
[39:59] winning and it looks like we're losing
[40:01] you're
[40:02] not losing and it has not about oh well
[40:06] if if I had just been stronger if I
[40:08] hadn't had this weakness forget that
[40:10] nonsense you're perfectly in the plan of
[40:14] God say but I got mistakes you think God
[40:17] don't know how to deal with that you
[40:19] he's your heavenly father friends I knew
[40:23] my children made mistakes I didn't set
[40:25] them at the
[40:26] curb
[40:28] I disciplined them and trained them and
[40:30] used them for teachable moments who who
[40:32] was the original
[40:34] daddy who is the original Papa see so
[40:39] everything here is just a shadow of that
[40:42] verse verse six again and Moses and
[40:45] Aaron did as the Lord commanded them so
[40:47] did they and Moses was four score years
[40:49] old and Aaron Four score and three years
[40:51] old when the people spoke unto
[40:54] pharaoh and the Lord spoke unto Moses un
[40:58] unto Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall
[41:01] speak unto you saying show a miracle for
[41:04] you then Thou shalt say unto Aaron take
[41:07] thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and
[41:10] it shall become a
[41:12] serpent and Moses and Aaron went in unto
[41:16] pharaoh and they did so as the Lord
[41:19] commanded so Aaron is
[41:23] now manifesting the word of the prophet
[41:27] amen Aaron is now demonstrating Aaron's
[41:32] demonstration is a final voice after
[41:35] Moses has already said
[41:37] it I'm here to tell you something
[41:39] friends at that Exodus at the second
[41:41] Exodus and at this Exodus God is
[41:44] engaging this family God is engaging you
[41:48] why does God uh perform the supernatural
[41:51] because he's a supernatural being and
[41:53] he's got a supernatural plan and you're
[41:56] a supernatural f
[41:58] family and we go out of here by a
[42:01] Rapture it's going to be a supernatural
[42:03] event you're not going to be able to put
[42:04] yourself in it but neither can you keep
[42:07] yourself out of it
[42:12] Hallelujah and Aaron cast his Rod before
[42:16] pharaoh and before his servants and it
[42:18] became a serpent okay that's going to
[42:20] for sure do it now no okay no no more
[42:23] need to do anything after that well
[42:24] they'll surely get to go verse 11
[42:26] everybody get packed up we're leaving
[42:28] then Pharaoh also called the wise men
[42:31] and the sorcerers huh wait what now the
[42:34] M now the M magicians of Egypt they also
[42:38] did in like manner with their
[42:40] enchantments for they cast down every
[42:42] man his right and they became
[42:45] serpents what do we do
[42:47] now MAA thought the message was the
[42:50] greatest thing out there and now it just
[42:52] looks like everybody can make a claim
[42:54] and it even looks like people can now do
[42:56] things that look like maybe the message
[42:58] isn't the thing that it's supposed to be
[43:01] but just to understand this understand
[43:03] this Aaron's Rod swallowed up their
[43:07] rods and he hardened Pharaoh's heart
[43:11] that he hearkened not unto them as the
[43:14] Lord had said
[43:16] amen so why does God perform the
[43:21] supernatural why would he perform the
[43:24] supernatural God does not always do
[43:27] Supernatural signs and and he does not
[43:31] want us to demand them or depend on them
[43:36] a at least not not demanding and
[43:39] depending in the way that we might think
[43:42] we need the supernatural God is
[43:44] constantly doing the supernatural that
[43:46] you're alive and a believer in an
[43:48] impossible age is
[43:50] Supernatural you're already a walking
[43:53] conundrum to the devil the harder he
[43:55] makes it the more you love God the
[43:57] rougher it gets the harder you push
[44:00] Hallelujah poor old guy can't win for
[44:04] losing I've often said devil could
[44:07] actually win if he wasn't always
[44:09] losing but God does not want us to
[44:12] demand miracles signs or the
[44:14] supernatural or wonders he doesn't want
[44:17] us to depend on them as the world would
[44:19] consider them he expects us to trust him
[44:24] based on what he has already done
[44:28] not something he needs to do I've got
[44:31] faith in him for what he's already done
[44:34] if he never does another thing for me I
[44:36] will leave this world as a
[44:40] Believer
[44:42] see we are to have faith in what he's
[44:44] already done faith in what he has
[44:47] already revealed in his word Matthew
[44:51] 164 says a wicked and an adulterous grab
[44:56] that one for me brother brother Caleb
[44:57] Matthew 16:4 a wicked and adulterous
[45:01] generation seeketh after a sign and
[45:05] their shall Now Catch who's seeking
[45:09] them amen amen so we don't want to be
[45:12] sitting here tonight trying to put God
[45:15] over a barrel to give us something
[45:18] Supernatural see we're we're to believe
[45:20] that he's what he's already done we're
[45:22] to believe what he's already revealed we
[45:24] are to be at peace we are to be in cont
[45:26] contentment in whatever situation we
[45:29] find ourselves in Because He Lives I Can
[45:34] Face tomorrow before I get there I
[45:37] already know I can and I don't even know
[45:39] what it holds but I already know I can
[45:41] because of what he's already
[45:44] been
[45:45] see a wicked and adulterous
[45:48] generation seeketh after a sign and
[45:52] there shall no sign be given unto it but
[45:56] the sign of of the prophet Jonah and he
[45:59] left them and
[46:02] departed he just left you want a sign
[46:06] I'm not doing it
[46:09] bye is he actually leaving yeah he's
[46:12] there he goes over the hill I thought he
[46:13] was going to no he just said no and he
[46:17] left the Lord wants us and he warns us
[46:20] to be careful in Matthew
[46:24] 24:24 he warns us to be be careful of
[46:27] false signs and false Wonders that will
[46:32] deceive the world and actually would be
[46:35] so deadly that they would deceive us if
[46:38] that were possible friends don't don't
[46:41] underestimate the devil I'm here I I've
[46:45] already given you a number of things and
[46:47] you've already roared out amens and
[46:49] we've rejoiced around but
[46:53] understand and this ain't a game life is
[46:56] happening and we're being perfected in
[46:59] real time and we don't have all the
[47:01] answers but I but I know who does and I
[47:04] just know this I just want him in
[47:07] control
[47:10] Hallelujah he he warns us to be careful
[47:12] Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise
[47:15] false Christ and false prophets and
[47:18] shall shall they shall show great signs
[47:23] and wonders so it's not just smoking
[47:26] mirrors are tricks they're actually
[47:28] signs and
[47:29] wonders they're going to demonstrate
[47:32] some things in so much that if it were
[47:35] possible they shall deceive the very
[47:38] elect so so as as happy as we are
[47:42] tonight and we're rejoicing sister
[47:44] Chassidy God bless you oh my goodness I
[47:47] didn't notice y'all sitting here praise
[47:49] the Lord interrupt my whole sermon
[47:51] praise the Lord
[47:54] amen
[47:55] wow
[47:57] I seen a sister paying Keen attention
[47:59] and saidh she she's
[48:04] familiar all right where was I let me
[48:06] get my thoughts back in gear here praise
[48:08] the Lord sis I'm thrilled to see you
[48:11] amen so here's my point that yes we are
[48:18] his chosen people but these are
[48:20] dangerous
[48:22] times yes we do have the word but you
[48:25] got to be careful let me tell you
[48:27] something young people teenagers and and
[48:30] the older ones in here could could give
[48:31] you a a a quick lesson just by telling
[48:34] you the history of their life this is
[48:38] serious I mean the you know even the
[48:40] Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[48:42] under this day and the violent have to
[48:44] take it by force if you want a blessing
[48:46] go take it if you need something for God
[48:49] to do go get it I promise you the devil
[48:53] was going to resist you but greater is
[48:55] he that is in
[48:58] you and your only concern the only thing
[49:02] you have to worry about is is your life
[49:05] worthy of the
[49:07] Gospel that's it after that it will be
[49:11] the Lord that gives the devil the beat
[49:13] down on your behalf if your life is
[49:16] worthy of the Gospel but even when the
[49:18] Lord does that to him it might not look
[49:19] like what you
[49:22] thought
[49:25] amen I think tonight that the greatest
[49:30] sign of the
[49:32] Supernatural is found in John chap 3
[49:36] veres 14-1
[49:39] 17 and as Moses John 3 14-1 17 and as
[49:44] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[49:47] wilderness even so must the son of man
[49:50] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[49:54] him should not perish but have Everlast
[49:57] but have eternal life so so already you
[50:02] already know that who doesn't believe in
[50:05] him's got a big problem
[50:08] amen can did you read that that
[50:11] whosoever believeth in him should not
[50:14] perish so apparently whoever's not
[50:17] believing in him have a
[50:20] problem they will not perish but have
[50:23] eternal life I'm here to tell you if you
[50:25] have made a decision to not follow the
[50:28] lord Jesus you got a big
[50:31] problem and it's not one you can solve
[50:34] and it's not one you can escape and
[50:37] there's no turning back and there's not
[50:39] going to be any type of of reprieve you
[50:43] have one way to to eternal life and
[50:46] that's through Jesus Christ through the
[50:48] Willing Acceptance from your heart to
[50:51] say Lord I don't want to be me anymore I
[50:54] want to be you and I want you to come
[50:56] come and live in my
[50:59] life that is the only hope of Salvation
[51:02] otherwise you're doomed to a
[51:06] tribulation whatever happens to you at
[51:08] the Judgment bar that's up to God you'll
[51:10] get a fair trial but for sure you are
[51:12] doomed to a tribulation I promise you
[51:15] don't want to be there
[51:18] am that whosoever believeth in him
[51:21] should not perish but have eternal life
[51:23] verse 16 for God so loved the world that
[51:26] he gave his only begotten son that
[51:30] whosoever believeth in him should not
[51:32] perish it's a double warning but have
[51:35] everlasting life for God sent not his
[51:39] son into the world to condemn the world
[51:42] but that the world through him might be
[51:46] saved so ultimately friends tonight the
[51:50] greatest sign that God has given us that
[51:54] God has ever given the world is his son
[51:58] that's the greatest supernatural act the
[52:02] Earth will ever know of is that he gave
[52:06] his only begotten son Jesus Christ who
[52:10] died and rose again for our
[52:17] justification we find out you're talking
[52:20] about supernatural power you're talking
[52:22] about a
[52:24] miracle if we believe in him
[52:27] we have eternal
[52:30] life that ain't a small
[52:33] thing he must not have been a small
[52:36] person I mean imagine just believing in
[52:39] a person and that's what he was a human
[52:42] believing in a human gives you eternal
[52:45] life this was more than a man this was
[52:48] quite a man and more than a man as
[52:51] brother brandham said he was the god man
[52:53] oh what a privilege oh what a
[52:55] supernatural that God would reveal this
[52:58] person to
[52:59] you no wonder brother Brandon would say
[53:02] what is the new birth you say well
[53:04] brother Brandon what is the new birth it
[53:06] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[53:09] personally to
[53:12] you it's that just that language alone
[53:15] means it ain't happening to
[53:18] everybody otherwise where's the
[53:20] privilege that he does it to say you're
[53:23] privileged you're
[53:25] right you're right I am before the
[53:28] foundation of the world I was chosen in
[53:30] Christ amen hallelujah say what are you
[53:33] going to do about it try to get
[53:35] everybody I can to believe like I do
[53:39] Hallelujah but if we believe in him we
[53:42] have eternal life and then we have the
[53:45] promise in Ephesians chapter 1 the very
[53:48] first chapter of Ephesians we have the
[53:51] promise that the that the Holy Ghost who
[53:54] is the guarantee he's actually a
[53:57] guarantee of our inheritance if you
[54:00] believe on Christ then you're you're and
[54:02] you repent and you believe on him and
[54:04] you're baptized in the Holy Ghost then
[54:07] you have a guarantee Ephesians 1 13 and
[54:11] 14 in whom you also
[54:15] trusted why am I you know tonight as I
[54:18] was putting this sermon together I was
[54:19] thinking about all these scriptures I'm
[54:20] going to go to and I almost did a
[54:22] PowerPoint but I didn't want to do it
[54:23] because it's Wednesday and so I just
[54:25] told the I didn't know who would be
[54:26] Manning it's brother Caleb tonight
[54:28] getting a workout but I said just be
[54:30] ready cuz I want to cover a bunch of
[54:31] scriptures and as I was putting that
[54:33] together this afternoon I was thinking
[54:34] yes sir I'm just going to Chuck this
[54:36] thing full of scriptures because I was
[54:38] so impressed with Brother JD on Sunday
[54:41] in that thought my goodness I was blown
[54:44] away by that and just scripture after
[54:46] scripture after scripture after
[54:48] scripture after scripture and he built a
[54:50] whole case and by the time he got done I
[54:51] was a
[54:52] Believer Hallelujah I said who could out
[54:56] that it was so biblical one two I mean
[54:59] the devil's just taking punch after
[55:01] punch after punch after punch oh I tell
[55:04] you something brother Jason I was so
[55:05] thrilled I told sister Debbie honey you
[55:07] got to get this archive I I I I thought
[55:09] to my that statement you made about God
[55:12] does not pour out his wrath upon his
[55:14] children don't ever let the devil tell
[55:16] you that Jesus Christ took the wrath of
[55:19] God he might pour out loving correction
[55:22] on you but the wrath of God was taken in
[55:25] Christ on my
[55:28] behalf oh that just shuts the devil
[55:35] down verse 13 in whom we all in whom you
[55:38] also trusted after that you heard the
[55:40] word of
[55:41] Truth The Gospel of your
[55:45] salvation in whom also after that you
[55:48] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[55:50] Spirit of
[55:51] Promise so being sealed by the Holy
[55:55] Spirit of promise is receiving is
[55:57] attached to the receiving of the truth
[55:59] for your hour I don't just mean mentally
[56:02] but in your heart heart to heart with
[56:05] God which is the earnest we made you we
[56:09] we told you that that this Holy Ghost is
[56:11] our guarantee and this is what Paul is
[56:13] saying which is the earnest of our
[56:16] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[56:18] purchased possession unto the praise of
[56:21] his glory now to me I am just I'm just
[56:25] uh I'm just laid
[56:27] uh you know back in the day when when
[56:30] brother Eddie and I we were traveling we
[56:31] were on the road doing a lot of painting
[56:34] and we were on the interstate a lot i'
[56:35] had been on by the time I was 18 I had
[56:37] been on at that time it's probably not
[56:39] true now I'm quite sure because there's
[56:40] been more interstates built but there in
[56:43] the late 70s and early 80s by the time I
[56:45] was 18 I had been on every every us
[56:49] interstate in the United States at least
[56:51] once I'd been multiple times all the way

[56:56] states by the time I was 18 we traveled
[56:58] a lot and one of the things we did to

[57:05] truckers talking and and you had a you
[57:08] had a lead trucker and then you had the
[57:10] guys in the rear and these guys up here
[57:13] were watching out for cops ahead these
[57:16] guys were watching out for sneaky cops
[57:18] sneaking up behind and the guy in the
[57:20] middle they said he's in the rocking
[57:22] chair cuz he's just he just rocking he's
[57:25] got lemonade he ain't got worry about
[57:26] nothing he's got a bird dog up front

[57:31] can sneak up on him nobody can surprise
[57:33] him I'm here to tell you that if I've
[57:35] got an inheritance that's in Earnest
[57:38] until my until the Redemption of the
[57:40] purchased possession there's nowhere in
[57:41] the middle for the devil to get me from
[57:43] the time I'm sealed to the time I'm gone
[57:47] Hallelujah there's no chance for him I'm
[57:49] just in the rocking chair
[57:52] hallelujah oh
[57:55] my to the until until the Redemption of
[57:59] the purchased possession under the
[58:00] praise of his
[58:03] glory one of the greatest
[58:06] meetings that brother brandham ever had
[58:10] was held in India 300,000 people and you
[58:14] say well what about Durban Durban was a
[58:16] tremendous meeting 30,000 coming to the
[58:19] Lord in one alter call 25,000 notable
[58:23] Miracles stood on their feet in one
[58:24] single prayer there eyewitnesses to that
[58:27] I've heard their eyewitness testimony
[58:28] we're not just talking about what
[58:30] William brandham said I've heard the
[58:32] eyewitness testimonies of people who
[58:34] were there I talked personally to George
[58:37] zad Cliff before he passed away I
[58:40] interviewed him over the phone and ask
[58:42] him about the certainty of his book I
[58:44] said it your book seems incredible pass
[58:46] myself off as maybe I'm not a full
[58:48] believer you know sir what you wrote
[58:51] what you wrote in a prophet visit South
[58:52] Africa seems in incredible I'm sorry I
[58:55] don't mean to impune your integrity but
[58:57] it what you're saying just seems almost
[58:59] impossible and that old man about come
[59:02] through the phone on me I'll tell you
[59:03] young man every bit of it was true I was
[59:06] there I saw
[59:08] it you know I've I've heard uh brother
[59:12] Bosworth on tape recording talking about
[59:15] that meeting and saying he never
[59:16] imagined 25,000 people could be healed
[59:19] with one prayer he'd never thought to
[59:20] try
[59:21] that he thought you just had to pray for
[59:23] people one at a time and he said brother
[59:25] brandham just prayed one prayer and he
[59:26] said we watch 25,000 people notable
[59:30] Miracles we're not talking about
[59:31] somebody got a sniffly
[59:37] nose and the de being raised I'm telling
[59:40] you something friends that was quite a
[59:41] meeting and yet India and and I know
[59:45] there's there's all this nonsense about
[59:47] oh well there was never a 300,000 people
[59:49] I went to the very spot where the
[59:51] meeting was held I went into the church
[59:53] and stood in the pull pit when I was in
[59:54] India I talked to the man who's the
[59:57] pastor whose grandfather was the was one
[1:00:00] of the team leaders as an organizer of
[1:00:02] that
[1:00:03] meeting and and I and he he said
[1:00:06] absolutely there were 300,000 people
[1:00:08] here he said it was my family has known
[1:00:10] that for years and he said I said well
[1:00:13] sir I'm looking at all these buildings
[1:00:14] and you say it was right here and he and
[1:00:17] that's what people don't realize they
[1:00:18] say oh where's 300,000 people going to
[1:00:20] gather but he said sir and when William
[1:00:24] Brandon was here none of these buildings
[1:00:26] were here they were all this was all
[1:00:28] open field and I said Glory Hallelujah I
[1:00:31] want to tell you something friends
[1:00:32] you've come too late to tell this old
[1:00:33] boy it ain't real i' done been around
[1:00:36] the Seven Seas I already proved this
[1:00:38] thing I've already went I've seen God do
[1:00:40] it I've not only heard what he did but
[1:00:43] I've seen him do it in my own
[1:00:46] Ministry so so we find that that that
[1:00:51] that when he was there he he he talked
[1:00:54] about and a lot of times if you if you
[1:00:56] hear him you know discussing India and
[1:01:00] you hear him discussing Durban meetings
[1:01:02] and you almost hear language that sounds
[1:01:05] like well which one's India and the
[1:01:07] reason for that is if you've ever been
[1:01:08] to Durban it's almost a completely I I
[1:01:12] would say conservatively it's three4
[1:01:14] East Indian
[1:01:15] culture and uh I was it was there not in
[1:01:18] India where I saw the the festivals and
[1:01:21] I saw where brother bradam said they put
[1:01:22] those hooks in their body and pulled
[1:01:24] chariots I saw that I witnessed it
[1:01:26] and where they walked on fire I actually
[1:01:28] was standing right there and watching it
[1:01:30] happen and so so a lot of times you can
[1:01:33] get the language a little bit confused
[1:01:35] uh as to what was happening where but
[1:01:38] but but we realize that when brother
[1:01:40] brandham one of the things that he
[1:01:43] encountered is that he was told you know
[1:01:47] by the leaders of both of those meetings
[1:01:50] to say uh you know brother brandham
[1:01:53] we've had dead theology for
[1:01:58] Generations what we need is a living God
[1:02:03] we've had theology if all you've done is
[1:02:05] come over here William brandham to bring
[1:02:08] us more dead theology I'm here to tell
[1:02:10] you our Bible schools are turning them
[1:02:13] out like crazy it's just all dead
[1:02:15] theology there's no real power of God we
[1:02:18] need to see a living
[1:02:21] God and you know the story I'm not here
[1:02:23] to to to go down that rabbit Trail
[1:02:26] tonight but you know when when you think
[1:02:29] about the that Indian culture that East
[1:02:32] Indian culture and how steeped they are
[1:02:37] in heathenism when I was there and they
[1:02:40] they have 33 million different
[1:02:46] gods that they worship and burn incense
[1:02:48] to 33
[1:02:51] million Madness this is madness amen and
[1:02:56] I I walked through their shrines and it
[1:02:59] just endless caverns and under it's like
[1:03:02] an underground and every every dark cave
[1:03:05] likee Corridor you go down there's
[1:03:07] there's incense burning here and incense
[1:03:09] burning there and painted images here
[1:03:11] and sculpted images here and and people
[1:03:13] prostrating and and you know you've got
[1:03:16] you've got cows and they're starving and
[1:03:18] they won't sacrifice the cows because
[1:03:20] they're holy and some of them are so so
[1:03:23] religious that when they when they walk
[1:03:27] when they walk from point A to point B
[1:03:30] they walk like this Shing possible
[1:03:34] insects out of their path lest it be
[1:03:36] some distant relative who's
[1:03:40] reincarnated that's that's I mean that's
[1:03:43] that's that's
[1:03:46] torture can you imagine having to be
[1:03:49] steeped in that kind of of of idolatry
[1:03:54] and and I'm here to tell you something
[1:03:55] friends when you go into a place like
[1:03:58] that you've got to be able to
[1:04:00] demonstrate the supernatural why does
[1:04:03] God perform the supernatural a lot of
[1:04:06] times it's to confirm the message and
[1:04:09] the messenger that he sent amen we've
[1:04:12] seen it happen I I I've seen all kinds
[1:04:14] of Miracles I could stand here tonight
[1:04:17] and tell you from Decades of traveling
[1:04:19] around the world and seeing incredible
[1:04:21] Miracles but we find that you you've got
[1:04:24] to have the reality ities of the Living
[1:04:26] God and brother Brandon facing the
[1:04:29] challenge you know of of dead theology
[1:04:32] but but now remember remember brother
[1:04:35] brandham teaches us that when God
[1:04:38] performs the supernatural he has a
[1:04:41] reason to do
[1:04:43] it he said God doesn't entertain
[1:04:47] us this isn't baram and Bailey he's not
[1:04:51] a a circus
[1:04:53] performer he's not as I've said to you
[1:04:55] many times he's not Santa Claus you
[1:04:58] don't give him your wish list you don't
[1:05:00] he's not a vending machine you get in
[1:05:02] trouble you're not very spiritual you
[1:05:04] don't ever think about God you got your
[1:05:06] whole life and all your priorities
[1:05:09] wrapped up in leoa and the devil gets
[1:05:12] almost all of your time and God can't
[1:05:14] even get you into the house of
[1:05:16] God until you're in
[1:05:19] trouble and then you're looking for 75
[1:05:22] cent to go to a to go to the god Vending
[1:05:25] machine and drop three quarters and Lord
[1:05:28] give me some Deliverance I'm here to
[1:05:30] tell you I'm here to defend him tonight
[1:05:32] he's not that kind of a God he deserves
[1:05:35] more out of you and I than that he gave
[1:05:38] his life he deserves everything you have
[1:05:42] you have no chance if he didn't love
[1:05:47] you he's not here to entertain
[1:05:50] us he has very specific reasons for
[1:05:54] demonstrations of his super Supernatural
[1:05:56] power and signs and wonders are in his
[1:05:59] personal presence as he said to as we
[1:06:02] read in our in Exodus he he said I'm
[1:06:06] doing it for this reason I'm going to do
[1:06:07] signs and wonders he's I'm then I'm
[1:06:09] going to harden his heart so that then I
[1:06:12] can I can actually bring judgments upon
[1:06:14] him and be just be justified in it
[1:06:16] because he I won't force him to reject
[1:06:18] it but he
[1:06:20] will see and in and then you say no God
[1:06:24] hardened his heart that's not scriptural
[1:06:26] God hardens your heart after you reject
[1:06:29] him God never even sends a man to
[1:06:32] judgment without first giving him a fair
[1:06:34] trial Paul Paul Paul clears that up in
[1:06:37] the New Testament that when the ancient
[1:06:39] people made a choice when they knew
[1:06:43] God they chose not to worship him as God
[1:06:48] but made of him winged creatures and
[1:06:50] forf footed and therefore God turned
[1:06:53] them over to a repeate mind see to to
[1:06:57] believe the lie and be damned by it and
[1:07:00] if all you hear is that part that God
[1:07:03] calls them to believe a lie so they'd be
[1:07:04] damned by it then the critic says see
[1:07:07] God God did that God didn't do it they
[1:07:09] did it over
[1:07:11] here see so so God God gives everybody a
[1:07:16] legitimate opportunity even starting
[1:07:18] with
[1:07:19] Cain see so don't don't confuse don't
[1:07:21] make the scriptures jam into each other
[1:07:23] like that you can't turn the got into
[1:07:26] something like that he's not he's not uh
[1:07:29] there's no Injustice in
[1:07:32] him in Mark
[1:07:34] 16 we find that sometimes God performs
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:39] supernatural in order to confirm the
[1:07:41] truth of his message and his Messengers
[1:07:45] I've made that statement to you already
[1:07:46] I'd like to read the scripture Mark 161
[1:07:48] 19 to20 so then after the Lord had
[1:07:52] spoken unto them he was received up into
[1:07:56] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[1:07:59] and they went forth and preached
[1:08:02] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:08:06] and confirming the word with signs
[1:08:10] following am and I'm a witness today
[1:08:13] brother Jason is a witness today brother
[1:08:15] Brad is a witness today any men who have
[1:08:18] taken this gospel especially overseas in
[1:08:21] America it's hard uh it's not that God
[1:08:24] can't do it but God just won't when he
[1:08:26] feels that resistant arrogant American
[1:08:28] Spirit he's not here to entertain us and
[1:08:31] I promise you he ain't got nothing to
[1:08:33] prove to
[1:08:34] you you can serve him or you'll perish
[1:08:38] you can give your heart to him or you're
[1:08:39] finished those are your options you're
[1:08:42] born with a death sentence and he loved
[1:08:44] you enough to die for you if you don't
[1:08:46] accept it it ain't on
[1:08:49] him so we find that but but when there
[1:08:53] are people who believe then God does do
[1:08:56] and I'm a witness that God does the
[1:08:59] supernatural I've seen Devils cast off
[1:09:02] I've seen blinded eyes open I've seen
[1:09:04] the lame walk I know it's
[1:09:06] real there's no p no power of the enemy
[1:09:09] that can withstand God's family when
[1:09:12] they're praying in faith and believing
[1:09:14] God's
[1:09:15] word I'm a eyewitness to that around the
[1:09:19] world so why does God do and perform the
[1:09:24] supernatural
[1:09:26] it's many often often times it's to
[1:09:29] demonstrate his love and his compassion
[1:09:32] for those who are suffering John 11:4
[1:09:36] give me that one right quick brother
[1:09:38] Caleb we'll read that I'm just going to
[1:09:39] try to not spend much time on it here
[1:09:42] John 11
[1:09:44] and4 then said Jesus unto them yeah
[1:09:48] thank you when Jesus heard that he said
[1:09:51] this sickness is not un death but for
[1:09:53] the glory of God that the son might be
[1:09:56] glorified now you're familiar with that
[1:09:58] story because you know his friend
[1:10:01] Lazarus had died he said I'm going to go
[1:10:03] wake him but the whole the whole point
[1:10:06] was that God is going to receive some
[1:10:08] Glory say well you know M seemed like a
[1:10:12] sad case and even even you find that
[1:10:14] Jesus comes along and Jesus says Where
[1:10:17] have you laid him and and they said Lord
[1:10:19] show and the place where we laid him and
[1:10:21] the Bible says shortest verse in the
[1:10:23] Bible Jesus wept and I'll taste me
[1:10:25] friends I read some commentary some
[1:10:26] years ago that I kind of lean into a
[1:10:29] little bit I don't I you know I know
[1:10:31] that Jesus was a man but he already
[1:10:34] knows he's about to be raised from the
[1:10:36] dead so then what's the point why would
[1:10:39] he be crying and they said oh see how
[1:10:41] the see how he loved him now that was
[1:10:43] the humanistic oh poor Jesus of Nazareth
[1:10:48] see how he loved him he did love him but
[1:10:51] he wasn't there to leave him in a grave
[1:10:53] he already knew he's going to be raised
[1:10:54] up already said it see and he says to
[1:10:58] Martha you know if if you had been here
[1:11:01] my son my brother not died and he said
[1:11:03] You Know Thy son shall live again yay
[1:11:05] Lord in the resurrection and Jesus Jesus
[1:11:09] immediately makes her stop looking
[1:11:11] forward he he didn't say in the
[1:11:14] resurrection he'll raise he said I am
[1:11:17] the
[1:11:18] resurrection so the resurrection is just
[1:11:21] not a calendar event he said I am the
[1:11:28] Resurrection this is the model of his
[1:11:33] bride have authority because the
[1:11:36] resurrection is already in you it's
[1:11:38] already started in your soul your Soul's
[1:11:41] already in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:11:45] Jesus so why is he crying and I read one
[1:11:48] commentator said one time because of all
[1:11:51] the unbelief around
[1:11:53] him I thought that makes a lot of sense
[1:11:55] to me after all he had done everything
[1:11:59] he had said and after it so showed so
[1:12:02] many miracles and yet they still the
[1:12:05] Bible even says that in another place
[1:12:07] that yet he did so many things yet still
[1:12:09] they did not believe him and to think
[1:12:12] I'm G to tell you something you want to
[1:12:13] talk about breaking his heart disbelieve
[1:12:15] his word when you ought to believe
[1:12:18] it when you're his child you're his son
[1:12:21] you're his daughter and if anybody ought
[1:12:23] to take the word of God it ought to be
[1:12:26] us and sometimes we let the devil string
[1:12:29] us out with this trial and that trial
[1:12:30] and this up and down and this problem
[1:12:32] and this and that and the other and and
[1:12:34] you lose confidence in God you me me
[1:12:36] tell you the opposite of that brother
[1:12:37] Brandon now look at the opposite of it
[1:12:39] in case you doubt this side of it let me
[1:12:41] show the the the contrast brother Bram
[1:12:43] says you believe his word and that makes
[1:12:46] him love you and you get what you ask
[1:12:49] for see so so we find that that he
[1:12:55] doesn't he doesn't always show his
[1:12:58] compassion in the way we
[1:13:01] expect but could I say to
[1:13:04] you it's still
[1:13:07] him
[1:13:09] hello I I know that he doesn't always
[1:13:13] show his compassion like like you had it
[1:13:16] written down on your
[1:13:18] prayer he might not be showing you his
[1:13:22] love like the prayer requests you sent
[1:13:24] in
[1:13:26] he might actually be showing you his
[1:13:28] love by doing the
[1:13:30] opposite almost like wow did you read
[1:13:32] that to God upside down no he heard it
[1:13:35] read and he's answering it in the way he
[1:13:38] knows
[1:13:39] best so I just want to say to you
[1:13:41] tonight that's a I know that's a short
[1:13:44] direct way to say it but that's how I I
[1:13:47] felt inspired to say it when I read John
[1:13:50] 11 that story in John 11:4 I realized
[1:13:53] that he doesn't always show his
[1:13:54] compassion
[1:13:56] in the way we expect but it's still
[1:14:01] him it's still
[1:14:03] him so why does God perform the
[1:14:07] supernatural sometimes to fulfill his
[1:14:12] promises and his prophecies Luke 24
[1:14:16] brother Caleb back to Luke 24
[1:14:19] 44-49 so wh watch this now Luke uh 2444
[1:14:24] to 49
[1:14:25] and he said unto them these are the
[1:14:27] words which I spake unto you while I was
[1:14:30] yet with you that all things must be
[1:14:34] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:14:36] of Moses and in the law and in I'm sorry
[1:14:38] and in the prophets and in the Psalms
[1:14:42] concerning
[1:14:43] me then opened he their understanding
[1:14:47] that they might understand the
[1:14:49] scriptures he's got Copus and his
[1:14:51] companions on the road to EMAs you're
[1:14:53] familiar with this and he said unto them
[1:14:55] thus it is written and thus it behooved
[1:14:57] Christ to suffer see they didn't
[1:14:59] understand why' he suffer why' he die
[1:15:01] they're all downcast and he walks out
[1:15:03] among them and says you know why is it
[1:15:05] that you walk and you're
[1:15:07] sad and they said are were you a
[1:15:10] stranger you haven't heard the things
[1:15:12] that have happened and he said what
[1:15:14] things well of Jesus of Nazareth a
[1:15:17] mighty man approved of God and we
[1:15:19] thought it had been he that should save
[1:15:20] Israel and now he's dead and this the
[1:15:22] third day and some crazy women said they
[1:15:24] saw him we don't know what to do and you
[1:15:26] know what Jesus could have just repeated
[1:15:29] his same line if he'd have wanted to he
[1:15:31] could have said yeah like I said what
[1:15:34] things well all of these yeah what
[1:15:36] things well death and terrible yeah
[1:15:38] exactly what
[1:15:40] things sometimes we have to get that
[1:15:42] through our head I know things go wrong
[1:15:44] and things get upside down the world
[1:15:46] gets crazy your home gets crazy your
[1:15:48] life gets crazy your family gets crazy
[1:15:50] you say oh all these things and I say
[1:15:52] what things say well this that and the
[1:15:54] other I say again what things Jesus
[1:15:57] Lives he's got a plan he's in control
[1:16:00] yeah but this and that what things there
[1:16:03] aren't anything things except this this
[1:16:05] is the only thing that
[1:16:07] matters Hallelujah and you've got the
[1:16:09] choice to live in that level of
[1:16:13] Victory the devil don't want you to live
[1:16:16] in that level of Victory he wants you to
[1:16:18] live roll around in the dust and throw
[1:16:20] dust in the air and and woe is me and
[1:16:22] I'm here to tell you somebody above you
[1:16:25] is in
[1:16:26] control
[1:16:29] Hallelujah and said un them thus it is
[1:16:32] written or that's fine go ahead the next
[1:16:35] one and that repentance and remission of
[1:16:38] sins you see guys this is why it had to
[1:16:41] happen so that remission of sin should
[1:16:44] be preached I know you didn't understand
[1:16:46] it but it had to be preached in his name
[1:16:49] among all nations it had to begin in
[1:16:52] Jerusalem I know you think it's all
[1:16:54] wrong but you're all wrong it's all
[1:16:57] right
[1:16:59] see and so verse
[1:17:02] 48 and ye are witnesses of these
[1:17:05] things and behold I send the promise of
[1:17:10] my father upon you but carry in the city
[1:17:13] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:17:15] power from on
[1:17:16] high so Jesus now has made them a
[1:17:20] promise he's cleared up a a lot of their
[1:17:24] Miss understanding and prophecy and on
[1:17:27] the Mount of Olives they're they're
[1:17:29] asking him a question you know uh you
[1:17:32] know Lord will you now will you now
[1:17:36] restore Israel I mean when when the
[1:17:39] prophet even you know they they had that
[1:17:42] wrong they thought okay now you're gonna
[1:17:46] okay you died we got it well we we
[1:17:49] didn't see that one coming and then you
[1:17:51] Rose we heard you Rose and then we were
[1:17:54] all depressed
[1:17:55] and then you opened us the scriptures
[1:17:57] and then you opened our understanding
[1:18:00] and then you opened our eyes and we saw
[1:18:01] it was you and then you
[1:18:02] disappeared and then you met us in a
[1:18:04] room and you met us by the
[1:18:06] seashore and and and okay we think we're
[1:18:09] figured this out now okay now we're on
[1:18:11] the Mount of Olives all right woo okay
[1:18:15] we got it Lord I'm sorry we doubted you
[1:18:17] now are you gonna restore
[1:18:20] Israel they still weren't getting
[1:18:23] it they still thought they had the
[1:18:26] Rapture all figured out and they were a
[1:18:28] million miles
[1:18:30] off all they get told is to go in and
[1:18:33] and expect to be filled and and I mean
[1:18:38] goodness goodness when when he fulfilled
[1:18:41] this prophecy it's not like they
[1:18:43] expected it's it when John's life didn't
[1:18:46] happen like they expected and and in
[1:18:49] fact is and in fact is that even the the
[1:18:52] promise of the Holy Ghost coming upon
[1:18:54] them didn't come like they expected
[1:18:57] brother brandham talks about that
[1:18:58] they're in the upper room and they're
[1:18:59] saying Peter you think we got it now you
[1:19:02] know I think maybe we got it boys I
[1:19:04] think we can just go ahead we've been up
[1:19:05] here three and a half days now you know
[1:19:07] and uh and and and if that crowd kind of
[1:19:09] lost the argument they resurfaced at day
[1:19:12] seven and and then day eight okay we are
[1:19:14] really done here it's been eight days
[1:19:17] and they still got two more days of
[1:19:18] waiting to
[1:19:20] go you see friends sometimes God does
[1:19:24] the super natural because we need a
[1:19:26] little bit of guidance we're so
[1:19:28] desperate for it but then sometimes he
[1:19:30] won't on purpose because he's wanting
[1:19:32] the the greater Supernatural and that is
[1:19:34] for you just to believe his
[1:19:37] word take him at his word and believe
[1:19:41] him and confess what he said see so you
[1:19:46] know the the the Lord is simply not
[1:19:48] going to let you figure things out in
[1:19:51] advance you've got to face a situation
[1:19:55] even when you don't understand it and
[1:19:57] either you have
[1:19:59] faith or you
[1:20:03] don't pretty cut and dry either you have
[1:20:07] faith or you don't have it you know even
[1:20:11] the uh as I said even the promise of the
[1:20:13] spirit coming upon them would be would
[1:20:15] be different than what they thought you
[1:20:17] know and when they're on the Mount of
[1:20:18] Olives it's different than what they
[1:20:20] thought they as I said I kind of
[1:20:22] interrupted myself they thought his
[1:20:24] Kingdom for Israel is going to be
[1:20:26] restored at that point and
[1:20:30] actually there's not anything they could
[1:20:32] have said that would have been more
[1:20:35] opposite of the
[1:20:36] truth will you now restore
[1:20:40] Israel no but boy really
[1:20:44] no I mean 2,000 years are going to have
[1:20:48] to transpire seven contiguous Church
[1:20:51] ages are going to have to go forth seven
[1:20:54] there's going to be seven spirits of God
[1:20:56] there's going to be four living
[1:20:58] creatures there's going to be the
[1:20:59] falling away and the restoration of the
[1:21:01] brid tree am I going to restore Israel
[1:21:05] yeah but not like you
[1:21:08] think oh my goodness can we learn a
[1:21:11] lesson tonight friends oh Hallelujah so
[1:21:15] so you know I mean our parents and our
[1:21:17] grandparents thought that they had the
[1:21:20] Rapture uh figured out when brother
[1:21:22] Brandon was here and even even brother
[1:21:25] Brenham I can say this now you don't
[1:21:27] have to throw something at me I'm not
[1:21:28] committing a terrible transgression we
[1:21:30] can say it now because of the history
[1:21:33] but but even brother brandham says
[1:21:35] things that seem to propose it would be
[1:21:37] different from what he thought in many
[1:21:39] ways and and ultimately but now
[1:21:43] ultimately it it would be everything he
[1:21:47] thought cuz it always is when a prophet
[1:21:50] says those things it is what he thought
[1:21:53] only sometime times it's not in the way
[1:21:56] we think the way we think is not maybe
[1:21:59] what God meant see and that those times
[1:22:03] come where you just have to say I've
[1:22:05] overturned every stone and all I know is
[1:22:07] that I know God is real and I know I
[1:22:10] believe him and I know I'm never leaving
[1:22:12] him and I know I'm going forward and
[1:22:14] that's all I know that's all I
[1:22:17] know
[1:22:20] see this is clear in the message today
[1:22:23] we can we can can make these kinds of
[1:22:25] statement as the as the fourth
[1:22:27] generation from the prophet now Rises
[1:22:30] into adulthood my own children sister uh
[1:22:34] uh my my my grandchildren my children's
[1:22:36] children my grandchildren sister Jean's
[1:22:38] great-grandchildren and we see them
[1:22:42] already growing into adulthood why does
[1:22:46] God perform the supernatural sometimes
[1:22:49] it's to draw people to repentance and to
[1:22:52] draw them to faith in him as he did in
[1:22:55] Acts 2 we won't turn to it brother Caleb
[1:22:57] cuz I'm running out of time but we're
[1:22:58] familiar with the story anyway we we
[1:23:00] read there in Acts 2 and 37 where the
[1:23:04] the Bible says they were pricked in
[1:23:05] their
[1:23:07] hearts sometimes God has to just plain
[1:23:10] old hurt your
[1:23:13] feelings sometimes he has to make you
[1:23:16] mad I I was testifying in Arizona and we
[1:23:20] were talking about a situation and
[1:23:21] somebody was talking about you know um
[1:23:25] the the subject of indiffer indifference
[1:23:27] to the word of God came up because
[1:23:28] that's the the
[1:23:31] sad ands by the wayside and it just lays
[1:23:35] on the ground the people they don't
[1:23:37] really care it's just it's doesn't mean
[1:23:39] anything to them and then the fouls of
[1:23:41] the air come and pick it up and that's
[1:23:42] the demons that come you said in a
[1:23:44] church service like this one here and
[1:23:46] the gospel went forth and okay fine it's
[1:23:49] really great for y'all okay great have
[1:23:51] had it but to you it means nothing it's
[1:23:53] not even that you're rejecting it you
[1:23:55] just are
[1:23:56] indifferent you're just okay I'm just a
[1:23:58] good old person whatever you know and
[1:24:01] and here and here we are talking about
[1:24:04] the words of eternal life and your
[1:24:06] opportunity is right in your hands to
[1:24:09] receive eternal life and you're just
[1:24:11] going to let it like water run through
[1:24:12] your fingers and whole
[1:24:14] well and that's indifference and I said
[1:24:17] that's that's the saddest part I I I was
[1:24:19] witnessing to a sister one time who his
[1:24:21] mother was very angry she's trying to
[1:24:23] witness the message meage to her which
[1:24:26] when we say that witnessing the message
[1:24:27] we're just witnessing the gospel that's
[1:24:29] what the message is nothing just the
[1:24:31] gospel and it's just the gospel returned
[1:24:34] back to its pure form like it was in the
[1:24:35] original that's all it is it's not
[1:24:38] another gospel it's the original one and
[1:24:41] so so she's witnessing the gospel the
[1:24:44] message to her mother and her mother is
[1:24:46] a you know real staunch denominational
[1:24:49] and thinks she already knows it all but
[1:24:51] her life proves it doesn't and that's
[1:24:52] why the daughter is trying to witness to
[1:24:54] her mom you need to think about I mean
[1:24:56] if you really say you had the spirit of
[1:24:57] God would you do that would you live
[1:24:59] like that would you dress like that
[1:25:00] would you go there would you say things
[1:25:02] like that isn't the spirit of God
[1:25:05] holy fair question people don't like
[1:25:07] that but it's a fair question see
[1:25:10] brother Brandon would say sisters you
[1:25:12] get out here and he here's a gentleman
[1:25:14] gave him the courtesy of calling him
[1:25:16] sisters said you get out here and he's
[1:25:18] in decent clothes out here mowing your
[1:25:20] grass and say you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:23] he said Just remember sister he's a holy
[1:25:27] spirit not a filthy
[1:25:30] Spirit you can't claim to have the Holy
[1:25:33] Spirit when you dress
[1:25:36] immorally that that that is that that
[1:25:39] becomes almost an oxymoron I guess
[1:25:41] that's not even possible see that's why
[1:25:45] the Bible says without Holiness no man
[1:25:46] shall see God period end of story Case
[1:25:49] Closed see so so even even the foolish
[1:25:53] virgin who don't get the message yet
[1:25:56] find Acceptance in God cuz they were
[1:25:59] righteous and they lived as Saints
[1:26:01] Sanctified ones the Bible calls them
[1:26:04] that calls them righteous and calls them
[1:26:06] saints so so we find that you know when
[1:26:10] it comes down to it that that that
[1:26:13] they're they're pricked in their
[1:26:15] heart and they say to Peter and the rest
[1:26:18] of the Apostles what must we do and
[1:26:19] Peter Peter doesn't tell him to go join
[1:26:22] a Bible College he just says repent
[1:26:24] he doesn't tell them to go do Penance
[1:26:26] and crawl on
[1:26:27] glass and whip yourself he just says
[1:26:30] repent amen repent stop thinking like
[1:26:33] the world start thinking like the word
[1:26:36] see and and so so the this this was to
[1:26:40] bring them Christ and the remission of
[1:26:42] sins so so why does God sometimes
[1:26:46] perform the supernatural sometimes it's
[1:26:49] to draw people to repentance and faith
[1:26:51] in
[1:26:52] him see so so he gave them the
[1:26:55] demonstration those people saw them
[1:26:56] coming out of the upper room and they
[1:26:58] heard every man speak in his own
[1:27:01] language see and so and so sometimes he
[1:27:05] you know here let me let me go let me
[1:27:07] come full circle tonight for I close
[1:27:10] I'll come back to my text in Exodus
[1:27:14] 7 because sometimes God performs the
[1:27:19] supernatural to reveal his power and His
[1:27:23] glory glory to his people I said this at
[1:27:27] the beginning and to the
[1:27:30] world and we're looking for a short
[1:27:32] quick powerful demonstration we're
[1:27:34] looking for the fresh for the fresh
[1:27:37] dynamics of this church to be a
[1:27:39] refilling of the Holy Ghost we're
[1:27:41] looking for that we're promised that and
[1:27:43] I'm I'm hanging on to that promise but
[1:27:46] I'm also not unaware that a lot of it's
[1:27:49] happening
[1:27:50] now I already see it happening in my
[1:27:53] life it's it listen friends you you say
[1:27:56] oh but my if you just knew my problems
[1:27:58] and if you knew my weakness if you knew
[1:27:59] my failures could could I if you knew my
[1:28:02] past life I'm in no shape listen friends
[1:28:05] it should be noted in this first Exodus
[1:28:08] and it's also true in the second Exodus
[1:28:09] I time to break it down tonight but it's
[1:28:12] certainly true in the first and the
[1:28:13] second and the third Exodus that that
[1:28:16] that God you know involves his family
[1:28:21] God involves his family in this
[1:28:24] Supernatural he's got Moses I'll make
[1:28:27] you a God and Aaron's going to be like
[1:28:28] your Prophet I'm going to put you in the
[1:28:30] model of like of like me and my Prophet
[1:28:33] you'll be God and he'll be the prophet
[1:28:35] oh friends you think that this bride is
[1:28:37] hopeless since a prophet went home
[1:28:39] nothing doing the ministry of the son of
[1:28:41] man is still here and stronger than it's
[1:28:43] ever been and more capable because now
[1:28:46] it's got an elect lady has risen in
[1:28:49] maturity and is ready to take her stand
[1:28:52] on the word of God Amen in the first
[1:28:55] Exodus it should be noted that when by
[1:28:58] the time you come to Exodus 7 where we
[1:29:01] read and God is saying you'll be like a
[1:29:05] God and Aaron will be like your
[1:29:07] Prophet you you need to realize that
[1:29:10] this was after Moses had come to the end
[1:29:13] of himself and finally stopped running
[1:29:17] this was the time when he came to the
[1:29:19] end of his own abilities it was then
[1:29:22] that God found him wandering in a
[1:29:25] Wilderness like he found you like he
[1:29:28] found me wandering in a Wilderness tired
[1:29:31] of being who we were uh feeling like our
[1:29:33] life was a failure we wasted all those
[1:29:35] years but the the truth of the matter
[1:29:38] was Moses hadn't wasted one of them
[1:29:40] brother bradam said God needed him to be
[1:29:42] there 40 years and then he needed him to
[1:29:44] be in the desert 40 years and then he's
[1:29:46] going to use him 40 years don't think
[1:29:48] the devil has anything on you I don't
[1:29:50] care what you ever failed or gave into
[1:29:53] God has always been in
[1:29:57] control and he's ready now to sweep it
[1:30:00] all into the sea of forget one us and
[1:30:02] start this world over with a millennial
[1:30:05] Reign and a righteous King on the throne
[1:30:07] and it's his family you're talking about
[1:30:10] a supernatural Miracle he's going to
[1:30:12] demonstrate the supernatural one last
[1:30:16] [Applause]
[1:30:22] time
[1:30:24] Exodus 7 is after he returned to
[1:30:27] Egypt and begin to work for the
[1:30:30] Lord among the
[1:30:33] people Exodus
[1:30:35] 7 is after things didn't go as they
[1:30:40] thought Exodus 7 is after it
[1:30:44] seemed to have gotten
[1:30:48] worse Moses cried to God because of the
[1:30:53] situation
[1:30:55] but it was
[1:30:56] all always all under God's
[1:31:01] control and his plan was not actually
[1:31:06] being
[1:31:07] hindered at
[1:31:11] all whose
[1:31:13] perspective yours or theirs or God's
[1:31:18] well which one should count amen which
[1:31:22] one should you live by yours are his

[1:31:33] next day because you'll to need it again

[1:31:36] counseling if you keep looking at your
[1:31:38] life through your own lens I'm here to
[1:31:41] tell you look through the lens of
[1:31:42] almighty God he has already done so much
[1:31:46] miraculous oh let me tell you something
[1:31:48] friends no matter what we see happening
[1:31:51] before Exodus 7 during Exodus 7 and
[1:31:54] after Exodus 7 Israel's Exodus from
[1:31:57] Egypt was always going to
[1:32:01] happen Pharaoh was always going to cave
[1:32:04] in eventually and let God's people go
[1:32:08] but God is determined to work through
[1:32:11] his family as he did in the example of
[1:32:14] Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh so just raise
[1:32:18] a volunteering hand and say me I'll I'll

[1:38:40] hallelujah amen you want to see the
[1:38:43] supernatural hand of God in our lives I
[1:38:47] love the fact that you know God don't
[1:38:50] ask anybody's permission to help
[1:38:52] me he helps me because he loves me when
[1:38:55] he's going to perform the supernatural
[1:38:58] for you and your life and meet your need
[1:39:00] he don't ask for anybody's
[1:39:03] permission neither does he accept
[1:39:05] anybody's resistance he just walks right
[1:39:07] past it you know they the old saying is
[1:39:11] it's it's easier to ask for forgiveness
[1:39:14] than it is for permission yeah he don't
[1:39:16] do that
[1:39:18] either he just moves like he wants to
[1:39:21] move I'm glad to know that he's my
[1:39:24] father brother Travis writes in prayer
[1:39:26] requests for Marcus
[1:39:28] Humphrey the man who God miraculously
[1:39:31] healed from cancer last year he has not
[1:39:33] been able to digest food well and has
[1:39:35] slowly lost his strength over the last
[1:39:37] several months they are now giving him
[1:39:39] only a week or so to live doctors don't
[1:39:41] have any answers or remedies that's the
[1:39:44] man that was in stage four with probably
[1:39:49] days to live and they took another CAT
[1:39:52] scan after prayer
[1:39:54] and he was clean as a whistle you know
[1:39:57] it's obvious that the devil has it in
[1:39:58] for this guy and the Lord's already
[1:40:00] saved his life one time that's a perfect
[1:40:02] example if he passes away that's a
[1:40:04] perfect example brother Brandon was
[1:40:05] saying said you know what's the greatest
[1:40:07] Miracle is your salvation he said say oh
[1:40:10] heal somebody of cancer he said he could
[1:40:12] heal you of cancer this year and you die
[1:40:13] of cancer next
[1:40:14] year that here we have no continuing
[1:40:17] City just because God heals your body of
[1:40:19] something don't mean you won't get sick
[1:40:20] again so the greatest miracle that God
[1:40:23] can do is the Salvation of your soul so
[1:40:26] we're going to pray for this man again
[1:40:28] but we're going to pray that the Lord
[1:40:29] will reveal himself to him he's already
[1:40:31] a wonderful Christian man but I think
[1:40:34] that brother Travis has really spoken to
[1:40:36] him you know about the systems of
[1:40:38] religion today and tried to get him to
[1:40:40] see a clearer picture in the in the
[1:40:42] message of the hour so let's be praying
[1:40:44] for that Amen Brother Richard noise
[1:40:46] requests prayer um oh my um Brother
[1:40:51] Richard having some mental battles there
[1:40:54] poor brother devil fighting him like
