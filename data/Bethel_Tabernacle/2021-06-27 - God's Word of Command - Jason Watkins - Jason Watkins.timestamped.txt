[0:00] merely you know a prophecy that would
[0:03] later
[0:03] be understood you know as the oil
[0:06] represented the holy ghost and
[0:08] the wine represented stimulation from
[0:10] revelation
[0:12] but actually it's more than just a
[0:14] prophecy for future understanding
[0:17] it's actually a word of command
[0:20] the same creative word uh
[0:23] that had spoken the heavens and the
[0:25] earth into existence and brought light
[0:27] out of nothing
[0:29] amen so it because it was that
[0:32] then there was no way that the enemy
[0:36] would ever be able to stop it regardless
[0:38] of what it looked like in real time
[0:41] no matter what when it's spoken here in
[0:43] this
[0:44] age to the church we find that under
[0:47] that black horse rider under that third
[0:49] seal
[0:50] you know he had had the effects of the
[0:51] white horse of deception and now it was
[0:53] teamed up with the red horse of
[0:55] martyrdom and tyranny and slaughter now
[0:58] teamed up with the black horse and he
[0:59] takes the bibles and makes a one one uh
[1:02] universal church and
[1:03] only the preachers only the the the
[1:06] clergy have the word of god
[1:08] and and he's oppressing by laws and
[1:10] putting people to death
[1:12] but god is simply saying you know satan
[1:15] it doesn't matter what you do
[1:17] you're not going to prevent me from my
[1:20] oil and wine
[1:22] because it looked like if you just read
[1:24] it on the surface of the scripture
[1:26] it looks like the devil just flaunting
[1:28] what god said god said hey don't touch
[1:30] that oil and wine
[1:31] and the devil goes right in and takes
[1:32] the word of god from them
[1:34] and began it looks like wow the devil
[1:36] just ignoring god but he's not because
[1:39] what god was saying at a deeper level is
[1:41] there was going to be suffering and
[1:43] those horse riders were going to look
[1:45] like they had success but regardless of
[1:47] however much success they would have
[1:50] nothing could stop god from revealing
[1:52] himself through his messenger
[1:54] to his people and they would get a dip
[1:56] of the holy ghost and be brought into
[1:57] the first resurrection
[1:59] so that he was able to lay his bride
[2:02] away
[2:02] in sleep with every age and there was
[2:06] nothing that satan can do and whatever
[2:09] it looked like he was doing
[2:10] was not stopping that because why
[2:13] touch not my oil and wine was a word of
[2:16] command
[2:17] that it was part of god's word and
[2:20] had to come to pass now when we look in
[2:23] job
[2:23] let's look at job our next slide i think
[2:26] i have it in the in the powerpoint
[2:27] so job 3 2 3-6 and the lord said
[2:31] unto satan has thou considered my
[2:34] servant job that there's none like him
[2:36] in the earth a perfect and upright man
[2:38] one that feareth god and issue with evil
[2:40] this is even
[2:41] before the holy ghost is given all right
[2:43] so i mean there's a way
[2:45] to to learn the the bible talks about
[2:48] even nature teaches us certain things
[2:51] about righteousness and we're made in
[2:53] the image of god so we come with a
[2:55] conscious to not lie to not steal to not
[2:57] kill we know
[2:58] to not do that see so we find then
[3:01] that he says he issue with evil and
[3:04] still
[3:05] he holdeth fast his integrity although
[3:08] thou movest me against him
[3:10] to destroy him without cause and satan
[3:13] answered the lord and said skin for skin
[3:15] yea all that a man hath will he give for
[3:18] his life
[3:19] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[3:22] his bone and his flesh
[3:24] and he will curse thee to thy face and
[3:27] the lord
[3:28] said unto satan behold he is in thine
[3:30] hand
[3:31] but save his life now here's a word of
[3:34] command
[3:35] the lord is saying i'm going to give you
[3:37] permission you
[3:39] you already have brought every kind of
[3:41] calamity on him
[3:43] because you challenged me and and now
[3:45] he's held his integrity and now you're
[3:47] saying
[3:48] oh if i touch his flesh well have at it
[3:51] but
[3:52] save his life so now we realize then
[3:55] that we
[3:55] we tend to think if we just read on the
[3:58] surface kind of like
[3:59] in the third seal if we just read touch
[4:02] n
[4:02] you know touch not the oil in the wine
[4:04] it looks like satan touched it plenty
[4:06] but actually god wasn't saying you're
[4:08] not going to be able to come against it
[4:10] he was simply saying my word is still
[4:12] going to prevail
[4:13] and so when he says to job you can have
[4:16] at him
[4:17] but you cannot take his life save his
[4:19] life so it
[4:20] in our when we read it from the surface
[4:23] it looks like that job was quite
[4:26] protected that would be the sense that
[4:28] we would get wow
[4:29] praise the lord job is protected satan
[4:31] can't take his life
[4:32] but i'm going to tell you something
[4:33] friends in the midst of his day-to-day
[4:36] life with all of his calamities i doubt
[4:39] job felt very protected
[4:42] i doubt very seriously that if job went
[4:45] around saying wow i've got this
[4:46] wonderful protection from the lord i
[4:48] think he probably
[4:50] felt there's anything but protection on
[4:52] my life
[4:53] but there was a mystery unfolding
[4:56] because
[4:57] a conversation had taken place in heaven
[5:00] a challenge had been thrown down by
[5:02] satan and god had taken the challenge
[5:05] just like in arkansas remember when the
[5:07] maniac jumped on the platform
[5:09] said i'll knock you out into that audi
[5:10] middle of that audience and brother
[5:12] branham said he was well able to do it
[5:14] his towering man brother branham was a
[5:15] small man about 145 pounds
[5:18] and and he said he was well able to do
[5:20] it but
[5:21] he says but the but the anointing came
[5:23] on brother branham
[5:24] says because you've challenged the
[5:26] servant of the most high god you'll fall
[5:28] at my feet so i'll show you whose feet
[5:30] all fall out and he
[5:30] went to swing and and the brother and
[5:33] said come out of him satan
[5:34] and he whirled around and his eyes
[5:36] rolled back and he collapsed on his feet
[5:38] and they had to pry him off of his
[5:39] brother ram's feet brother branham
[5:41] explains it that
[5:42] satan made a challenge and the holy
[5:45] ghost accepted the challenge
[5:47] oh i want to tell you something friends
[5:48] today there's a there's a war going on
[5:50] in another realm
[5:52] and angels are moving to interdict on
[5:54] behalf of your life don't ever doubt
[5:56] that that god
[5:57] remains in control of our lives
[6:00] but we find that job was unaware of any
[6:03] of this
[6:04] god didn't run ahead and uh you know
[6:07] ahead of satan and warned job he didn't
[6:09] even send an angel
[6:10] he didn't even give him a dream like he
[6:12] did joseph in the days of the
[6:15] young child jesus remember he come to
[6:17] him in a dream says take the child and
[6:18] flee
[6:19] because herod's trying to kill him and
[6:21] so we realized that god didn't do that
[6:24] he job was caught completely unaware
[6:27] but job but god knew that job
[6:31] would hold on and that job would pass
[6:34] the test
[6:36] but there's but i want to point out to
[6:38] you today that there's
[6:39] more in that mix than just
[6:42] for knowledge it wasn't just that god
[6:46] you know can look back and sit back and
[6:48] see see how it all works out and by his
[6:50] foreknowledge he knows job's going to
[6:51] hold
[6:52] he knows you know god is literally
[6:55] proving to satan
[6:56] a kingdom principle that someday
[6:59] he he's going to live inside of his
[7:02] people
[7:02] and god is going to accomplish his will
[7:05] just like he did in jesus
[7:07] only in mrs jesus and that mrs jesus
[7:10] will be a continuation of mr jesus
[7:14] and so he god is now giving a word of
[7:17] command
[7:17] don't touch his life so we realize that
[7:20] god
[7:21] in this awareness remember that jesus
[7:24] remember that jesus brother branham says
[7:28] in is your life worthy of the gospel and
[7:30] he says
[7:31] jesus never screamed at devils because
[7:33] he didn't he didn't have to he never
[7:35] felt the need to do that
[7:36] he said he just spoke because and they
[7:39] fled and he said jesus knew here's what
[7:42] he knew
[7:43] he knew two things one was based on the
[7:46] other
[7:46] he knew as a man as a result that his
[7:50] word couldn't fail
[7:52] and he knew as a cause of that was he
[7:54] knew who he was
[7:56] see so his his revelation of who he was
[8:00] this is why brother branham would say
[8:02] what is the new birth
[8:03] he said it is a revelation of jesus
[8:07] christ
[8:08] personally to you so it is
[8:12] god is giving you to understand who you
[8:14] are
[8:15] job didn't understand all of his
[8:16] circumstances and in fact is if you
[8:18] follow the story
[8:20] job continues to hold continues to hold
[8:23] even his wife turns against him
[8:24] and he says woman you speak like a
[8:26] foolish woman she said oh curse god and
[8:29] die
[8:29] you speak like a foolish woman and the
[8:31] three wit his three friends you know
[8:33] miserable comforters he said you're all
[8:34] miserable comforters and they're
[8:36] they're trying to accuse him and he he
[8:38] can't make sense of everything he
[8:40] knows he hasn't done anything wrong and
[8:42] he knows god is just
[8:43] and he won't let that slip he won't let
[8:46] the devil tell him he's guilty of
[8:48] something he knows he's not guilty of
[8:50] and he won't defy god because he knows
[8:52] that god is just in all things
[8:55] and so based on that job his revelation
[8:58] that far thus far was holding him
[9:02] now i'm going to tell you something
[9:03] friends brother branham said you know
[9:05] you should pray for
[9:06] revelation above all things because when
[9:09] god reveals his word to you you can make
[9:11] sense sometimes of your life which
[9:13] doesn't make a lot of sense
[9:15] sometimes we go through things and joel
[9:17] was going through things
[9:18] and and and right at the point where job
[9:21] you know where satan is making a very
[9:23] true statement
[9:24] no no this last stage he'll curse you
[9:27] see satan knows mankind he knows
[9:29] that man can only hold so far until god
[9:32] increases the revelation
[9:34] and when god comes down to job what does
[9:36] he do he comes just in time
[9:38] to say job where were you when the
[9:41] morning stars sang together and the sons
[9:43] of god shouted for joy as i've preached
[9:45] to you before
[9:46] god's not being you know he's not he's
[9:48] not browbeating job he's not
[9:50] being a smart aleck he's giving job a
[9:52] revelation
[9:53] job where do you think you were before
[9:56] the morning
[9:56] when the morning star is saying do you
[9:58] think you started here job i'm here to
[10:00] tell you when sons of god shattered for
[10:02] joy job your identity's back
[10:04] there and that's when job could rise up
[10:07] and it didn't matter
[10:08] satan had done his worst and yet job
[10:11] could rise up and say i know
[10:13] my redeemer liveth and at the last day
[10:15] i'll see him and
[10:17] with my own eyes i'll see him amen so
[10:19] job knew
[10:20] it didn't even matter what happened in
[10:22] this life even if his life went to the
[10:24] grave
[10:25] he knew that he would resurrect and see
[10:27] god in his flesh with his own human eyes
[10:30] see so so we realize this principle
[10:34] of god's word of command that that is
[10:37] wrapped up you know in the identity so
[10:40] jesus
[10:41] knowing who he was and you know i i've
[10:44] often thought about how that and my
[10:46] monitors are getting a little hot
[10:47] brothers
[10:47] i've often thought about how that that
[10:50] jesus
[10:51] as a as a 12 year old boy and he's
[10:54] confounding the doctors in the temple
[10:57] and i
[10:57] i've often wondered when he when he
[10:59] turned to isaiah
[11:00] and he read all we like sheep have gone
[11:03] astray and god had laid on him the
[11:05] iniquity of us
[11:06] all and he was led as a you know dumb
[11:09] as a lamb he opened not his mouth led to
[11:11] the slaughter
[11:12] i wonder how old jesus was as a boy
[11:16] when he opened those verses and read
[11:18] them and it
[11:19] dawned on him that's me this is me
[11:22] this is my life i'm here to tell you
[11:24] something friends
[11:25] by that by the time he's entering into
[11:27] his ministry he doesn't have to scream
[11:29] at devils he already knows who he is god
[11:32] has already identified him this is my
[11:34] beloved son
[11:35] make no doubt this is my beloved son
[11:38] inside of whom i'm dwelling and pleased
[11:40] to be here
[11:41] see and so jesus with the with the
[11:44] strength
[11:45] knowing that knowing watch now because
[11:48] here's here's a real point that i want
[11:49] to make
[11:50] knowing not only that
[11:54] who he that that not only that god's
[11:56] word of command
[11:58] couldn't fail because he's god and his
[12:01] word can't fail
[12:02] that he had that knowledge god's word
[12:04] can't fail
[12:06] but jesus also began to realize
[12:09] that he was the word of command as a
[12:12] human
[12:14] he was that same word that's why john
[12:16] says in the beginning was god with god
[12:18] and was god that logos
[12:20] and jesus knew i am merely an expression
[12:23] of that same word of command
[12:24] i can't be stopped and that's a
[12:27] revelation your confidence just isn't in
[12:29] god
[12:30] it's in the identity of who you are that
[12:33] you realize i'm a continuation of the
[12:35] word of command
[12:36] i can't be stopped there's nothing it
[12:39] doesn't matter what's happening in my
[12:41] life i'm sorry to be preaching on a
[12:42] sunday school class
[12:43] it doesn't matter what's happening in my
[12:45] life i'm a word of command
[12:48] i am the word and a human i'm the
[12:51] extension i'm the continuation of that
[12:53] same ministry
[12:55] that dwelt in jesus and by that
[12:57] revelation
[12:59] not only was his confidence in god
[13:01] that's where job job already had
[13:03] confidence in god
[13:04] but when job began to realize who he was
[13:07] and
[13:07] what that actually meant then he
[13:10] realized that his word
[13:12] that his life can't be stopped that
[13:14] satan can't
[13:15] can't prevent him from going forward i'm
[13:17] here to tell you something friends
[13:19] that was under the third seal that was
[13:21] under a black horse rider
[13:22] and and now we have the pale horse
[13:25] riding which is a
[13:26] which is a conglomeration of the white
[13:28] horse the red horse the black horse all
[13:30] combined
[13:31] and you say this world is impossible and
[13:33] rightly so
[13:34] because we have the convergence of the
[13:36] days of noah and the days of lot
[13:38] we have 6 000 years that satan has had
[13:40] to build his eden so now it's satan's
[13:42] eden
[13:43] we have satan according to paul in this
[13:45] age who's now the god of this evil age
[13:48] worshipped as the god people in churches
[13:51] singing the songs of zion don't realize
[13:54] according to scripture they're
[13:55] worshiping the devil
[13:57] because they've given their life over to
[13:59] him and they've missed the revelation
[14:01] of the word of the hour to them
[14:03] personally which would have given them
[14:05] the right kind of worship
[14:08] and so here you are today and i know a
[14:09] pale horse rider and i know the world's
[14:11] crazy and i know it's
[14:12] it's breaking apart at the seams but i'm
[14:14] here to tell you god released an eagle
[14:16] anointing in this hour
[14:18] to lift us up above the shadows you
[14:20] can't survive in the darkness why it's
[14:22] too dark it's impossible
[14:23] get out of there let the eagle anointing
[14:25] lift you up into the light of god's word
[14:28] see because that's where our strength is
[14:31] that's how we are continuing
[14:33] to be the word made flesh jesus just as
[14:36] jesus was the fullness of the godhead in
[14:40] a single human body
[14:42] now that same god is now manifested
[14:45] in the fullness of his word in a
[14:47] mini-membered body
[14:49] many member body so you have mr jesus
[14:52] mrs jesus
[14:52] as the bride would call as the as as the
[14:55] bible would call her
[14:57] the bride of christ see she and and
[15:00] she's born of his bone
[15:01] flesh of his flesh these two shall be
[15:03] one
[15:04] amen and so so we realize then
[15:07] that that we're we're looking at this
[15:10] world
[15:11] and we can't just look at it on the
[15:13] surface
[15:14] you can't just look at your life on the
[15:16] surface you can't just look at
[15:18] trials and tribulations and even
[15:20] sometimes your own human failures
[15:22] and you say i'm never going to make it
[15:25] can i use my double
[15:26] negative you can't not make it
[15:30] you can't not believe because why
[15:33] because you're smart no i i can figure
[15:36] out the message of this hour because i'm
[15:38] intelligent enough no
[15:40] has nothing to do with it it has to be a
[15:42] revelation of god not just revealing
[15:44] theology to you but revealing to you
[15:47] you're part of that word and that you
[15:50] and that's why
[15:51] satan can't stop you touch not the oil
[15:54] and the wine it's a word of command
[15:56] god is going to have a bride he's
[15:58] already foretold it
[15:59] he's going to he sent a word that would
[16:02] gather her around the world
[16:03] and it's happened say can you explain it
[16:05] to me here's what i can explain
[16:07] an eagle screamed and i heard it and
[16:09] i've gathered around the carcass of the
[16:11] word today
[16:12] yeah but you're a minority well i can't
[16:13] explain that seem like to me the whole
[16:15] world should believe this
[16:16] they don't but i know that i believe it
[16:20] and there's nothing that the enemy is
[16:22] going to do in this day
[16:23] in this life i don't care how dreadful
[16:25] it becomes that's going to
[16:27] there's no way that he's going to be
[16:30] able to destroy the revelation in my
[16:32] heart
[16:33] and there's no way he's going to
[16:34] dislodge my position as a son of god
[16:38] and in this i have confidence say how do
[16:41] you know that you will always be
[16:42] a son of god because i'm part of the
[16:44] word of command
[16:46] see that has to come to pass brother
[16:48] branham finishes with this
[16:50] with this quote from the sumerian church
[16:52] age do we have that josh i think we
[16:54] raced through job
[16:55] let's see let's start it right there now
[16:57] watch
[16:58] brother brahm says in the sumerian
[17:00] church age
[17:01] i know there he is walking in the midst
[17:03] of his people there he is
[17:05] the chief shepherd of the flock i got to
[17:07] hurry
[17:08] chief shepherd of the flock but does he
[17:11] hold back the persecution
[17:13] does he stem the tribulation look at
[17:15] history did he no
[17:16] 68 million were martyred
[17:19] 68 million has a minimum well some
[17:22] estimates are 120 million
[17:24] christians down through seven church
[17:26] ages were martyred for the cause of
[17:27] christ
[17:28] by an entity calling itself the church
[17:33] so a group calling itself the true
[17:35] church slaughtered the true church
[17:38] see so so so we find he says here
[17:41] so does he stem the tribulation no he
[17:44] does not
[17:45] he simply says i know your tribulation
[17:48] i'm not at all unmindful of your
[17:50] suffering what a stumbling block that is
[17:52] to so many people
[17:54] like israel they wonder if god really
[17:56] loves them how can god be just and
[17:59] loving
[17:59] if he stands by and watches his people
[18:01] suffer that is what they asked
[18:04] in malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word
[18:08] of the lord to israel by malachi
[18:11] i have loved you saith the lord yet you
[18:14] say
[18:15] wherein has thou loved us look at this
[18:18] well and god hears god's answer was not
[18:21] he saw jacob's brother
[18:23] saith the lord yet i love jacob and i
[18:25] hated his soul
[18:26] and laid his mountains and his heritage
[18:28] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[18:30] you see they could not figure out god's
[18:34] love
[18:34] they thought that love meant no
[18:37] suffering
[18:38] they thought that love meant like a baby
[18:40] with parental care
[18:42] but god said that his love was elective
[18:45] love
[18:46] the proof of his love is election that
[18:49] no matter what happened
[18:50] amen just think of that no matter what
[18:53] happened
[18:54] his uh his love was proven
[18:58] truly by the fact they they were
[19:01] chosen unto salvation because as the
[19:03] scripture says god hath chosen you to
[19:05] salvation
[19:06] through sanctification of the spirit and
[19:09] belief of the
[19:10] truth he may commit you to death as he
[19:13] did paul
[19:14] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[19:16] job that is his prerogative
[19:18] he is sovereign but it is all with a
[19:21] purpose
[19:22] if he did not have a purpose then he
[19:23] would be the author of frustration and
[19:25] not of peace
[19:26] his purpose is that after we have
[19:29] suffered a while we would be made
[19:31] perfect
[19:31] be established strengthened and settled
[19:33] as job said
[19:34] he put strength in us in job 23.
[19:37] you see himself suffered this is christ
[19:40] himself suffered he learned obedience by
[19:44] the things that he suffered he was
[19:46] actually made perfect by the things that
[19:48] he suffered hebrews 5
[19:50] 8-9 though he were a son yet learned the
[19:52] obedience by the things which he
[19:54] suffered
[19:54] and being made perfect he became the
[19:57] author of eternal salvation
[19:58] unto all them that obey him in plain
[20:00] language the very character of jesus was
[20:04] perfected by
[20:04] suffering and according to paul he has
[20:07] left his church a measure of suffering
[20:09] that they too
[20:10] by their faith in god while suffering
[20:12] for him
[20:13] would come to a place of perfection he
[20:16] he
[20:17] why did he want this james 1 2-4 my
[20:20] brethren
[20:21] count it all joy when ye shall fall into
[20:24] divers temptations knowing this
[20:26] that the trying of your faith worketh
[20:28] patience but
[20:29] let patience you have to let it you have
[20:32] to allow it
[20:33] see or you can get bent and twisted
[20:37] complexed it's your choice but james is
[20:40] saying
[20:40] let patience have her perfect work
[20:44] see that you may be perfect an entire
[20:48] wanting nothing i want to tell you
[20:50] something friends no matter what happens
[20:52] to us in our day you can take that down
[20:54] brother josh no matter
[20:56] what happens to us in our day
[20:59] the creative word of command stands sure
[21:04] and i'm here to tell you we don't know
[21:06] how much more
[21:07] crazy the world will become how much
[21:10] more twisted or perverted i can't
[21:12] imagine it could be
[21:13] more than it already is where mankind as
[21:16] a specie
[21:17] has lost his ability to discern between
[21:19] right and wrong that's prophecy
[21:21] that he said that would happen and it's
[21:23] happened but i know this that i have a
[21:26] divine word of command
[21:27] that assures me that even if he commits
[21:30] me to death as he did paul if he commits
[21:32] me to suffering as he did job
[21:34] nevertheless paul said second timothy 2
[21:37] 19 nevertheless
[21:38] the foundation of god standeth sure
[21:41] having this seal
[21:43] the lord knoweth them that are his
