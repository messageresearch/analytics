[41:20] could think or ask granite Lord may you
[41:22] grant it I've seen you do it Lord many
[41:24] times even testifying of one time but
[41:27] I've seen you do it many times Lord in
[41:29] my experience so I commit it to you now
[41:31] and bless the reading of the word bless
[41:34] the speaker and hers and Lord if there's
[41:36] any other prayer request that I'm just
[41:38] forgetting I I know you're aware of it
[41:41] Lord and so I pray father there are a
[41:44] couple of things you know that are on my
[41:46] heart that I won't speak out here at the
[41:48] pulpit but I'm praying for those and
[41:50] assured people that I would be praying
[41:51] and so I'm committing that to you Lord
[41:54] in the name of Jesus that you will make
[41:57] all of these things Lord just beautify
[41:59] it all lay your hand and bless it Lord
[42:02] look toward it and it'll be blessed of
[42:04] the I commit it now to you in Jesus name
[42:06] Amen and in Revelation chapter 10 we're
[42:14] very familiar reading to us but I'm
[42:16] gonna read a little further than you
[42:17] would normally read beginning verse 7
[42:20] and I think I sent brother Kevin I think
[42:24] I sent you verse 9 but we're actually
[42:26] starting in 7 I apologize but in the
[42:29] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[42:31] when he shall begin to sound the now I
[42:35] want you to catch these next words the
[42:37] mystery of God should be finished it's
[42:41] finished as he hath declared to his
[42:44] servants the prophets and the voice
[42:46] which I heard from heaven spake again
[42:49] spake unto me again and said go and take
[42:52] the little book which is open in the
[42:54] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[42:56] the sea and upon the earth and I went
[42:59] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[43:02] the little book and he said take Heat he
[43:05] said unto me take Heat
[43:07] I take it and eat it up I'm sorry and it
[43:10] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[43:13] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I
[43:16] took the little book out of the Angels
[43:17] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[43:20] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[43:22] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[43:25] said unto me again thou must prophesy
[43:28] again before many peoples and nations
[43:30] and tongues and kings and there was
[43:33] given me a reed like unto a rod and the
[43:36] angel stood saying arise and measure the
[43:39] temple of God and the altar and them
[43:43] that worship therein but the court which
[43:46] is without the temple leave out and
[43:48] measure it not for it is given unto the
[43:50] Gentiles and the Holy City shall be
[43:53] tread under foot forty and two months
[43:55] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[43:57] word as you're seated god bless you
[44:08] now you'll notice that I read straight
[44:13] out of chapter 10 and just carried on
[44:16] into chapter 11 and so I went from
[44:19] chapter 10 verse 11 straight into
[44:22] chapter 11 verse 1 we read verse 1 and 2
[44:24] you need to remember that chapter and
[44:28] verse segmentation was added to the
[44:30] Bible years later many years later and
[44:33] actually when John wrote it it was a
[44:36] continuous letter just like Paul's
[44:37] letters they're continuous sometimes you
[44:40] know when you're reading something and
[44:42] you read a chapter and something Paul
[44:44] teaches and Paul teaches in abstract
[44:46] ways anyhow and you don't fully get it
[44:49] sometimes if you just read a little bit
[44:51] of the chapter ahead and a little bit of
[44:53] the chapter following you'll catch it
[44:55] more clearly because understand Paul
[44:58] didn't write it in chapters and verses
[44:59] Paul just wrote a letter and later on
[45:02] translators decided arbitrarily you know
[45:06] but we believe that our Bible is
[45:07] inspired of God but they put the chapter
[45:11] and verse in so so I I read to you this
[45:15] morning about how that we he goes from
[45:20] the eleventh verse of chapter 10 because
[45:23] if you if you'll notice that that
[45:26] chapter 10 kind of ends in a cliffhanger
[45:30] it doesn't really conclude anything it
[45:34] just simply says I was told to go and
[45:36] ask for the book I went and asked he
[45:38] said to eat it here's what will happen I
[45:40] did and it happened and then he said to
[45:43] me verse 11 thou must prophesy again
[45:45] before many peoples and nations and
[45:47] tongues and kings okay okay and okay so
[45:55] what does that mean and but but you you
[45:58] realize that God is going to make a very
[46:01] clear line between that Gentile church
[46:05] that's taken from the earth and his two
[46:08] prophets Moses and Elijah which go forth
[46:11] during the tribulation so as soon as the
[46:15] bride is taken the tribulation begins
[46:17] the time of Jacob's trouble the last
[46:19] half of the 70th
[46:21] week three and 1/2 years 42 months and
[46:24] so but but you you want to realize that
[46:28] that with what brother Branham taught us
[46:31] from the scripture and in numerous
[46:34] places we're going to look at today
[46:35] that you will see that that chapter one
[46:39] I'm sorry chapter 11 verse 1 and there
[46:43] was given me a reed like unto a rod and
[46:46] the angel stood saying rise and measure
[46:49] the temple of God and the altar and them
[46:52] that worship therein so now he's got to
[46:55] measure a people who worship in the
[47:02] temple and who are in fact the temple so
[47:07] the Bride of Christ the New Testament
[47:10] church she is the tabernacle of God's
[47:14] dwelling place
[47:15] so you're still what you're reading is
[47:18] is you're reading the final measurable
[47:22] perfection of this bride who ate the
[47:26] book amen so she didn't just eat the
[47:29] book and go off preaching listen friends
[47:32] we didn't just get the seals and this
[47:33] thing's just going to go on and on and
[47:35] on and on and on and on and on and on
[47:38] and on we as I read to you when the
[47:42] seventh angel comes the mysteries
[47:43] finished and so there's got to come an
[47:47] end game to this there's got to come a
[47:49] time where where you know that seventh
[47:52] and last star he only had seven and that
[47:56] last star has already been deployed did
[48:00] its mission and recalled you understand
[48:03] and now the last thing is for the bride
[48:05] to eat that open book because she's got
[48:08] a prophesy she's going to be the final
[48:10] voice to the final age but but now does
[48:13] she just go from here on and how long do
[48:16] we say well we're just the final voice
[48:18] well we're just to find a voice well we
[48:20] got to lay in the presence of the Sun
[48:22] and ripen well how long do you think you
[48:23] got to ripen how long do you think this
[48:26] is going to last I mean let me let me
[48:27] tell you something you got to get it out
[48:29] of your mentality that we're just going
[48:31] on and on and on you can't just go on
[48:33] and on and on this thing
[48:34] has to come to a conclusion and I
[48:36] believe and we don't know but I believe
[48:38] that what we're seeing already might be
[48:40] the very catalyst that sets up one thing
[48:43] after another till the world is spinning
[48:45] off into chaos and the Lord comes and
[48:47] extracts a bride in a secret catching
[48:49] away so we're seeing here the and you'll
[48:55] notice that when he differentiates
[48:57] between in verse two but the court which
[49:00] is without the temple leave out and
[49:02] measure it not see because because
[49:05] that's given to the Gentiles the holy
[49:06] city shall be tread under foot forty two
[49:08] months so now you've got the the remnant
[49:10] the unwise virgin who were who never
[49:14] made it into the Holy of Holies do you
[49:17] understand they never were born again
[49:20] they believed unto salvation amen that's
[49:24] that's what the Bible teaches and
[49:25] brother Branham makes it clear the
[49:27] foolish virgin are saved they don't get
[49:29] saved in the tribulation they're already
[49:32] saved from destruction but they're not
[49:35] born again they haven't passed from
[49:37] death to life like you have they still
[49:39] come to the judgment in chapter 25 of
[49:42] Matthew's Gospel of the Gospel of
[49:45] Matthew they in chapter 25 they stand
[49:47] before the throne to be judged and be
[49:49] separated from the unbelieving world
[49:51] because they were believers and they're
[49:53] granted eternal life at that judgment
[49:56] bar but the bride who are in the who are
[49:59] in the temple worshiping they're in the
[50:01] Holy of Holies they've went beyond the
[50:03] veil and they themselves in fact are the
[50:06] temple of God's presence they are
[50:09] measured because the bride listened the
[50:11] bride is coming to her perfection and
[50:15] this signals that she's been taken home
[50:18] in the last the last night the last idea
[50:21] that we get the last description is
[50:24] she's a measured perfection of the
[50:27] presence of God's dwelling amen now now
[50:30] let's look at that as we go on down all
[50:32] right now any fees and 610 um let me get
[50:40] that brother Kevin I didn't send that
[50:41] but see if you can put that up for me
[50:43] real quick Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10
[50:47] Paul says here to the Ephesian Church
[50:50] finally my brethren be strong in the
[50:54] Lord and in the power of his might if
[50:58] you don't get it brother markets alright
[50:59] because I'm getting ready to switch over
[51:01] to my powerpoint at any rate but finally
[51:04] my brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[51:08] the power of his might you know I when
[51:12] we talk about this thing coming to its
[51:15] finish and and now I've got to move into
[51:18] a very precarious take some very gentle
[51:22] steps here so that I don't give the
[51:25] wrong idea and I want to be very
[51:26] circumspect at how I say this you know
[51:29] we're in unprecedented times and
[51:32] uncharted times the whole world is
[51:35] saying that it's there's never you know
[51:37] we've had global pandemics but never to
[51:40] the point where the world was such an
[51:42] interconnected one world that a global
[51:45] pandemic goes around the world by jet
[51:48] airplanes and crashes the economies of
[51:50] the world and and and literally now it's
[51:54] already this pandemic has been has been
[51:57] so politicized I'm gonna take something
[51:59] friends it's hard to know who to believe
[52:02] of course there's an illness of course
[52:05] there is there always has been but but
[52:07] but to say what level should it be and
[52:10] what level should we worry and what
[52:12] level should we fear and what's really
[52:13] working and what's really not because if
[52:15] you've been tracking it what we should
[52:18] do and shouldn't do has changed what
[52:20] what should be allowed and shouldn't be
[52:22] allowed has an altered and they're
[52:23] literally figuring it out as they go in
[52:25] that's fine I get it it's it's it's
[52:28] they're having two world economies you
[52:31] know where the medical community they're
[52:34] having to figure this out as they go and
[52:35] they can rely on some some old trusted
[52:39] and true methods of science and it's
[52:41] panning out good but then some are
[52:43] saying but hold on that might not be a
[52:45] hundred percent we got to wait and see
[52:47] we don't have all the data I'm here to
[52:48] take something friends uh we're in a
[52:51] time where this word is to come to it's
[52:53] finished cycle and I'm here to tell you
[52:55] something friends that the word of this
[52:57] hour will demonstrate itself so
[53:00] there comes there must come a difference
[53:03] you know there the the balance is that
[53:06] you know it's it's it's not ah then this
[53:10] whole idea of operating in prudence
[53:13] which you should versus operating in
[53:18] fear which you should not and it's
[53:21] particularly bad to operate in fear
[53:25] especially after you've been told don't
[53:28] fear Jesus told us what would happen at
[53:34] the end time and he said this will
[53:36] happen and this will happen and this
[53:38] will happen and this will happen and
[53:39] brother Branham comes along and says
[53:40] it'll be this this this this and Jesus
[53:42] said you know even when Peter doesn't
[53:45] understand he said you don't understand
[53:46] now but you'll know later and and you
[53:48] know and so we we we now see things and
[53:52] Jesus said I tell you this now so that
[53:55] when it happens you'll know that I've
[53:57] told you so I'm gonna tell you something
[53:59] friends what we're seeing what the world
[54:01] is just in a panic-stricken and and now
[54:06] it's already polarized politically and
[54:08] you don't even know who's trying to work
[54:10] behind the scenes for a political agenda
[54:11] you don't even know I'm not suggesting I
[54:14] know I'm just simply saying I I know
[54:17] that I know this is true I know he's
[54:21] real I know faith is real I know that
[54:24] this word of this hour in all of this
[54:26] time of uncertainty will demonstrate
[54:29] itself and I know that we can put faith
[54:32] in it and put confidence in it and
[54:34] you're going to have to you think that
[54:38] this you think I mean you've got some
[54:41] scientists saying you know it's the
[54:43] second third wave no it's not going to
[54:45] happen and then you've got other
[54:46] scientists with more letters following
[54:48] their name than these guys who are
[54:50] saying it's not only going to get worse
[54:53] it's going to get much worse you've got
[54:58] the head of the World Health
[54:59] Organization saying it's going to get
[55:01] much worse
[55:01] you've got former CDC former Surgeon
[55:05] General's are testifying to Congress no
[55:08] question it's going to get much worse
[55:11] and you know
[55:13] one side of politics can say this the
[55:16] other side can say that this doctor can
[55:17] say this another one you got this one on
[55:19] YouTube saying this and this one on
[55:20] youtube saying this I mean I mean the
[55:23] madness you can see the chaos that the
[55:26] people face and everybody is running in
[55:28] fear because of fear of the unknown
[55:30] which is what's happening is a fear of
[55:33] the unknown and and so look so so now
[55:37] now they've already got this new strange
[55:41] by-product or after effect of Cronus now
[55:45] striking down children when they
[55:47] formerly told us children are pretty
[55:49] much immune from it well now there's
[55:50] they're finding out oh that's actually
[55:52] not true and and I hear them say the
[55:55] fact it is what they literally the woman
[55:56] when I just heard recently by that
[55:58] Governor of New York said we're
[55:59] understanding that that fact is no
[56:01] longer a fact like great so it was a
[56:05] fact and then it does suddenly a time
[56:07] and now it's not a fact anymore well if
[56:10] it's not a fact anymore it never was a
[56:11] fact and the fact is you don't know what
[56:14] the facts are that's a fact
[56:18] I'm here to tell you something friend
[56:20] but here's a fact
[56:21] this word is true and his presence is
[56:24] here and I am his family and I do have
[56:26] faith and I do have the Holy Ghost
[56:29] because what are you going to fear next
[56:32] anyway as soon as this one's over
[56:34] another one's coming and another one's
[56:35] coming they say when they caught me they
[56:37] don't even know what's yeah well you
[56:38] know a president saying I can turn
[56:39] around and another and other economists
[56:41] saying no way it's happening this year
[56:42] maybe a year maybe two maybe three maybe
[56:44] 10 I don't know I don't care I'm not
[56:46] staying hallelujah I'm just here to tell
[56:50] you today I get prudence we have been
[56:52] operating in prudence there are people
[56:54] here today who are who decided not to
[56:56] come in prudence and that's perfectly
[57:00] perfectly fine god bless everyone who is
[57:03] acting in a prudent all things by faith
[57:06] pray yeah and and make up your decision
[57:09] it were totally okay with it I'm just
[57:12] saying don't be afraid be prudent but
[57:16] don't be afraid because there's one
[57:18] thing coming and then another and then
[57:20] and then another and you're gonna have
[57:22] to finally put your foot on the word and
[57:24] put your back against Calvary and say
[57:26] this far and no further
[57:28] and I will not back up any more because
[57:33] this word do you believe we have a
[57:35] message do you believe the seals are
[57:37] open do you believe a messenger finished
[57:39] his course then this thing has to
[57:42] demonstrate itself and that's brother
[57:46] Branham says that over and over and over
[57:47] it the word will demonstrate itself if
[57:49] you just believe it so this message I
[57:55] mean think about it friends come on this
[57:58] you say oh that's just a nice idea well
[58:02] is it I say to you the word will
[58:05] demonstrate itself you can put
[58:07] confidence that the word will be there
[58:10] when you need it say oh well we speak
[58:14] this into existence and speak that and
[58:16] restore missing limbs and brother
[58:17] Brandon believe we might see all of that
[58:20] understand but but but catch it now in
[58:23] every case of the third pull it was
[58:26] never brother Brandon making a decision
[58:28] I think I'll operate the third pool even
[58:31] Jesus didn't do that Jesus only moved by
[58:34] what the father showed him and it was
[58:36] time it demonstrated Jesus didn't make
[58:39] it demonstrate Jesus just simply stepped
[58:41] in and cooperated with the vision and
[58:43] God's Word begin to manifest that's all
[58:45] brother Branham did he's in the woods
[58:46] yeah what are you here for honey
[58:48] squirrel how many you need to need a
[58:49] mess how many's a match-three ok say
[58:51] where they'll be and brother Branham
[58:53] said I was just there I guess he did it
[58:57] you know he's the one who said brother
[59:00] Branham was running for the camp and God
[59:03] said stop turn around and go back up
[59:05] into that storm and speak to it so it's
[59:10] never been about you having to figure it
[59:13] out what your mission is is to fill your
[59:16] mind so full of the word that the devil
[59:19] can't get in there he don't have any
[59:21] room to cause you to down to cause you
[59:23] to be carnal to cause you to live in
[59:25] fear to live in failure
[59:27] fill up your mind with this word because
[59:32] when it gets ready and needs to
[59:34] demonstrate itself it will if it can
[59:38] through you I can tell you right now
[59:42] there's no way it can demonstrate itself
[59:45] if you're operating in fear say well
[59:49] listen to a fine line between acting and
[59:51] four how do I know it's the same Act
[59:53] I'm not gonna do this certain thing and
[59:54] how do I know if it's prudent I don't
[59:56] know if it's fear I mean come on friends
[59:57] you pray you know I mean you ever hear
[1:00:01] the saying you know somebody you make a
[1:00:04] statement to them and they say look me
[1:00:07] in the eye and tell me that again now
[1:00:10] what are they doing they're looking you
[1:00:11] in the eye and and if you are telling
[1:00:13] the truth you can look them square in
[1:00:16] the eye and repeat what you just said if
[1:00:19] you're not confident of what you're
[1:00:21] saying you think you're shading a little
[1:00:23] bit your eyes will dart around even
[1:00:24] psychiatrists know that you'll you'll
[1:00:27] stumble you'll pick it you'll deal
[1:00:29] you'll you'll cross your legs you look
[1:00:31] sideways they have they know when people
[1:00:33] are lying they have psychological ways
[1:00:35] but when you can look look that person
[1:00:38] in the eye and with no even on a lie
[1:00:40] detector that's measuring your pulse and
[1:00:42] measuring your heart rate and it
[1:00:44] wouldn't change and you can repeat that
[1:00:46] again we say well then how do I know if
[1:00:48] I'm operating in fear or if I'm
[1:00:51] operating in prudence look God in the
[1:00:53] face have that kind of a prayer life now
[1:00:56] you never knew that if you ain't got
[1:00:58] that kind of a prayer life if your mind
[1:01:00] is filled with the world you'll never be
[1:01:02] able to have that kind of confidence but
[1:01:04] I'm here to tell you I know that I can I
[1:01:07] can look God in the face and I can say
[1:01:09] Lord I'm doing this because I think it's
[1:01:12] prudent it has nothing to do with fear
[1:01:14] and I'm here to tell you I can look him
[1:01:15] in the eye and say that now if I look
[1:01:18] him in the eye and I and I realize that
[1:01:20] I'm gonna realize and I'm not unique
[1:01:24] you'd realize looking God in the face
[1:01:27] when you're in prayer and you know how
[1:01:29] to pray and you're used to being in the
[1:01:31] presence of God you know if you're
[1:01:33] afraid
[1:01:35] you say I don't want him to see that he
[1:01:37] might rebuke me no he'll heal you of it
[1:01:40] if you're afraid be honest and say Lord
[1:01:44] turn my fear to prudence it might be the
[1:01:46] exact same action I might take the exact
[1:01:49] same action but the motive behind it's
[1:01:51] gonna be different the fuel that this
[1:01:54] engine is burning is either going to be
[1:01:56] prudence and wisdom or fear might be the
[1:01:59] same action I'm not I'm not here to tell
[1:02:01] you what action you need to take or not
[1:02:03] take knew not do go not go have not have
[1:02:06] I'm here to tell you have your mind
[1:02:09] filled with this word that God finished
[1:02:13] and gave to an angel who gave it to you
[1:02:16] and you're feeding upon it listen
[1:02:18] friends you say oh that's that's fine I
[1:02:21] get it we had a message seals are open a
[1:02:22] word came we got a message it's the
[1:02:24] bleeding word it's Christ it's word I
[1:02:25] get in all the cliches all the cliches
[1:02:27] but it still seems like a metaphor to me
[1:02:29] well let me just point something out to
[1:02:31] you that that the word that might just
[1:02:36] seem like a a nice thought to you do you
[1:02:39] realize that had that word not come the
[1:02:43] whole earth was doomed to be destroyed
[1:02:47] with a curse from God but God said I'll
[1:02:51] send Elijah before I do that and here we
[1:02:55] are believing Elijah's message and
[1:02:57] you've become a believer of it and I
[1:03:00] mean come on open your understanding and
[1:03:03] say wow it's true I I have been redeemed
[1:03:07] from that certain destruction I know
[1:03:09] that this word has actually saved my
[1:03:13] life it saved my soul it opened my mind
[1:03:16] it gave me the realities of heaven then
[1:03:19] why would it not demonstrate itself in
[1:03:22] our world when we needed to come on the
[1:03:24] scene if it's already saved you from a
[1:03:27] certain destruction it's already
[1:03:31] separated you from the world why would
[1:03:34] it suddenly go oh well you know I could
[1:03:36] do the harder thing I could save your
[1:03:38] soul and open your mind and open your
[1:03:39] understanding so you see the word but as
[1:03:41] far as these viruses and things that are
[1:03:42] coming I'm sorry I can't help you with
[1:03:44] those really it's already done the
[1:03:47] greater work
[1:03:49] how would we not imagine it can do the
[1:03:52] lesser work say and and again I'm not
[1:03:57] here to say yeah I've already taken a
[1:03:59] stain on this way this isn't tribulation
[1:04:02] citizen treatise just for the illnesses
[1:04:04] the virus might have another one extra
[1:04:06] we had some other years they come
[1:04:08] through people get sick I get sick you
[1:04:10] can say any one of us are apt to get
[1:04:12] sick so what do we do we wash their
[1:04:14] hands we've got a particular strain
[1:04:16] that's making a lot of people sick and
[1:04:18] people are dying so we're social
[1:04:20] distancing where we're taking extra
[1:04:22] measures of steps we're hoping the
[1:04:24] summer well we'll see it abate and we're
[1:04:26] hoping by the winter if it comes back
[1:04:27] we'll have some treatments or vaccines
[1:04:29] or whatever I don't even know
[1:04:30] I haven't even determined how I feel
[1:04:33] about all that stuff but I'm just here
[1:04:35] to tell you that that in my mind I'm
[1:04:38] already saying Lord I've got to trust
[1:04:41] your word at some point because this
[1:04:44] ain't going to get better it's already
[1:04:46] only getting worse now they got want
[1:04:48] something with small children well
[1:04:51] what's next
[1:04:52] say well that's pessimistic well what
[1:04:56] what what these small kids wasn't a
[1:04:57] reality a couple weeks ago it is now
[1:04:59] what's to say in a couple more weeks
[1:05:01] don't seat some other kind of I don't
[1:05:02] know reality I'm just here today
[1:05:05] something friends God sent us a message
[1:05:07] that he said when it comes it will
[1:05:09] finish it will finish in a profit ran a
[1:05:13] profit finished it and we have the word
[1:05:16] and I can see in my Bible that we come
[1:05:18] to the measurable perfection of his
[1:05:21] dwelling place so I think today that
[1:05:25] that when we talk about Christ in the
[1:05:28] kingdom of Saints I could say to you
[1:05:30] today that this is Jesus and his temple
[1:05:33] Christ and his kingdom of saints is
[1:05:36] Christ living inside of his temple which
[1:05:38] is you amen
[1:05:43] so I want to fill up my mind with
[1:05:46] discernment you're gonna need that the
[1:05:52] world is a shaking place and shaking
[1:05:54] harder and harder every 24 hours it's
[1:05:56] not gonna stop as I said when this thing
[1:05:59] first started I don't even know what we
[1:06:00] might even see some
[1:06:02] some measure of normalcy we're already
[1:06:04] trying to get back to that today's more
[1:06:06] normal than we were last Sunday and
[1:06:08] hopefully in a few more Sunday's it will
[1:06:10] just look like nothing ever happened
[1:06:12] but I'm here to taste something friend
[1:06:14] there's been a wound on the psyche of
[1:06:15] mankind around the world it ain't gonna
[1:06:17] heal it ain't gonna go away and the next
[1:06:20] little thing is going to put more fear
[1:06:21] on him than this one did and I'm here to
[1:06:24] tell you I don't plan to be that guy I
[1:06:26] don't plan to be part of that gang that
[1:06:28] gets into more fear than we already have
[1:06:31] to deal with here I'm just saying I want
[1:06:34] to fill my mind up with discernment real
[1:06:37] discernment say how do I do that I'm not
[1:06:39] a prophet the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:06:43] is the spirit of prophecy and so breath
[1:06:47] my brother Brendan would say the real
[1:06:49] prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:06:51] really Liza is the Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:06:54] so we have the word that comes to us
[1:06:56] fill up your mind with his word and
[1:06:59] you'll fill up your mind with
[1:07:01] discernment and you'll fill up your
[1:07:03] heart with prudence and you drive out
[1:07:06] confusion from your mind and you'll
[1:07:09] drive out fear from your heart and I'm
[1:07:14] gonna tell you something your families
[1:07:16] brothers men listen you need to be able
[1:07:19] to look like the Rock of Gibraltar to
[1:07:22] your wife and children and to your
[1:07:23] family you know you know the Bible says
[1:07:26] quit yourselves like men in other words
[1:07:28] you know buckle up come on I mean let's
[1:07:31] let's let's be men about this God called
[1:07:33] us as men and Paul said I write unto you
[1:07:36] young men because you're strong see and
[1:07:39] the old man because he's wise so so
[1:07:43] let's fill up our mind with discernment
[1:07:46] by filling up our mind with his word
[1:07:49] empty out a lot of the world that's in
[1:07:52] your mind empty out all the things that
[1:07:57] Laodicea don't be about Laodicea be
[1:08:00] about that Jerusalem which is above have
[1:08:03] your citizenship have your mind let let
[1:08:06] your let your your your hope motive and
[1:08:09] purpose in life be to say Lord we're at
[1:08:12] a climactic moment
[1:08:14] and I can see today that this thing
[1:08:17] can't just keep going on and it's gonna
[1:08:19] continue to get worse and I plan to dig
[1:08:21] in right now and put my feet on the Word
[1:08:23] of God and say I believe the word and I
[1:08:27] am I am taking steps to fill my mind
[1:08:31] with this word so that I push out all
[1:08:33] the poisons of Laodicea and in so doing
[1:08:36] I will push out any fear that's in my
[1:08:38] heart and prudence and wisdom and faith
[1:08:41] will arise and faith got muscles all
[1:08:46] amen muscles are not a whole lot of
[1:08:49] value on the physical frame I've I've
[1:08:52] seen I mean you can you can see all
[1:08:54] kinds of videos of little small guys who
[1:08:57] probably weigh a third or half you know
[1:09:01] fighting some big guy two and a half
[1:09:03] times their size but but they're not
[1:09:05] afraid at all not afraid at all they go
[1:09:08] right and take that big guy right to the
[1:09:09] ground all they say is the bigger is the
[1:09:11] harder he falls and they knock them out
[1:09:14] and they put them in submission and they
[1:09:15] put them on the ground and I mean you
[1:09:17] know what does that because their
[1:09:18] confidence it's never been the size of
[1:09:20] the dog in the fight it's the sight of
[1:09:22] the size of the fight that's in the dog
[1:09:24] and so I'm gonna taste something friends
[1:09:26] fill up your heart with God's Word fill
[1:09:28] up your mind with God's Word because
[1:09:30] you're more than a match for anything
[1:09:32] Satan can try be prudent use wisdom
[1:09:36] these sensible pray use discernment but
[1:09:39] whatever you do don't let fear rule in
[1:09:42] any of your decisions even if your
[1:09:44] decision is identical doesn't matter if
[1:09:47] it if it's a fear if this is the
[1:09:48] decision whether it was prudence and
[1:09:50] wisdom or fear it's the same decision
[1:09:53] but let but at the end of the day be
[1:09:55] able to say to the Lord and look him in
[1:09:57] the eye and say Lord I'm doing this
[1:09:59] because I believe it's what you would
[1:10:01] have me do it has nothing to do with
[1:10:03] fear and if you can't look the Lord in
[1:10:07] the eye and say that then stay down and
[1:10:09] pray stay down and pray some more and
[1:10:12] say Lord take this fear out of my heart
[1:10:15] see doesn't mean you'll make a different
[1:10:18] decision it just means the motive the
[1:10:20] engine the fuel that's making it will be
[1:10:23] different
[1:10:27] if I I'm gonna taste something friends
[1:10:30] personally if you want this a little
[1:10:33] personal advice from brother Jason if I
[1:10:35] detect fears driving me out on purpose
[1:10:37] do the opposite on purpose
[1:10:40] I'll do it or die if I find myself
[1:10:44] afraid to do something that I think the
[1:10:46] word is calling for me to do and I'm
[1:10:48] afraid to do it I will close my eyes
[1:10:50] grit my teeth and go forward if I fall
[1:10:52] off a cliff I don't care I'm not brother
[1:10:55] branham said that brother branham said
[1:10:57] I'd rather go down in defeat than be a
[1:11:00] coward I'd rather lose the fight then
[1:11:03] then be a coward and just like when they
[1:11:06] when they challenged Billy Graham you
[1:11:08] know and that and that that guy said I
[1:11:11] tell you what dr. Graham you know you
[1:11:13] line up 50 or however many 30 or 50 sick
[1:11:16] people over here and I'll line up 30 or
[1:11:18] 50 sick people over here and every time
[1:11:20] you hit one out he'll one and the man
[1:11:22] knew he couldn't heal anybody but he
[1:11:24] also knew the Billy Graham couldn't and
[1:11:25] Billy Graham wouldn't take the challenge
[1:11:27] wouldn't take the challenge said I don't
[1:11:30] have that you know God don't work like
[1:11:31] that in the morning brother branham said
[1:11:32] oh my goodness he said I wish that I
[1:11:35] called me said I wish that a clay
[1:11:36] sadhana took it he said Otto a brother
[1:11:38] went down in defeat them to let that
[1:11:39] infidel pipe off like that we're gonna
[1:11:41] tell you something friends it's time to
[1:11:43] be bold and have faith in the Word of
[1:11:45] God hey man I will we might need to be
[1:11:49] more prudent than we're being now I
[1:11:50] don't know I'm not suggesting what we
[1:11:53] should do and we don't even know yet
[1:11:55] what we're gonna face I'm just simply
[1:11:57] saying when we get there let's have
[1:11:59] faith let's have wisdom let's fill up
[1:12:03] our mind and our heart with the word so
[1:12:06] that wisdom and faith have a way to
[1:12:07] operate through us hey man we are the
[1:12:14] temple we're the measurable perfection
[1:12:17] I've taught you this out of Revelation
[1:12:19] 11 but I've never I thought it occurred
[1:12:21] to me the other day I said you know I've
[1:12:22] never really connected all the dots for
[1:12:24] the people with the quotes in the
[1:12:25] scripture so watch so let me let me show
[1:12:28] you uh how brother Branham covers this
[1:12:33] ah let me see if I think I've got it I'm
[1:12:37] trying this for the first time all right
[1:12:41] so let me do that and then I guess I can
[1:12:46] do that
[1:12:46] yes perfect that works so Christ and the
[1:12:50] key and the kingdom of Saints part 3 the
[1:12:53] tabernacle of his dwelling place the
[1:12:57] tabernacle of his dwelling place working
[1:13:00] brother Kevin okay did that go to my
[1:13:04] next one it it it did all right putting
[1:13:08] on the whole armor of God now watch
[1:13:10] because I'm gonna go quote scripture
[1:13:13] quote scripture I'm gonna show you
[1:13:14] brother Branham didn't pull this out of
[1:13:15] thin air
[1:13:15] he's a word prophet all right putting on
[1:13:19] the whole armor of God just like the
[1:13:21] word in the beginning was spoken to us
[1:13:23] in the Garden of Eden spoken word and I
[1:13:26] got that in the Garden of Eden catch
[1:13:28] this he's gonna make a he's gonna he's
[1:13:30] drawing a picture there was a spoken
[1:13:32] word in the Garden of Eden the second
[1:13:36] time it was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:13:38] us you get that the third time it become
[1:13:43] part of us when the Holy Ghost dwelling
[1:13:45] in us God coming into the man you get
[1:13:49] that all right so now so so we looked in
[1:13:54] here he says again first spoke the word
[1:13:57] the enemy tore it down remember in the
[1:14:00] Garden of Eden don't read ahead of me
[1:14:01] let me dummy let me read at my pace
[1:14:03] remember the enemy tore it down in the
[1:14:05] Garden of Eden right then the Word was
[1:14:08] made flesh say praise the Lord well he
[1:14:12] was crucified so it was spoken word he
[1:14:15] tore it down it was made flesh he
[1:14:17] crucified it but now amen there's a
[1:14:20] difference in the word the word has
[1:14:23] become the church and the church is the
[1:14:27] word all that God was important to
[1:14:29] Christ all Christ was poured into the
[1:14:31] church the Holy Ghost now the enemies
[1:14:33] got something see then he isn't fighting
[1:14:36] something back there I'm here to tell
[1:14:37] you some friends are supposed to be a
[1:14:39] fight happening God didn't come into the
[1:14:42] church to not fight jesus said my if my
[1:14:47] kingdom my subjects were here they would
[1:14:48] fight for me they weren't there at the
[1:14:50] moment the holy
[1:14:51] satting come but it was common and when
[1:14:54] they came out of an upper room it's not
[1:14:55] we're not fighting we don't beat the air
[1:14:57] we're not are our weapons aren't
[1:14:59] Warfare's of swords and spears but we do
[1:15:01] have a sword of faith we do have a
[1:15:04] shield of faith we do have a helmet of
[1:15:06] salvation hallelujah and so where to arm
[1:15:11] ourselves and fight so many people
[1:15:13] aren't fighting too many of God's family
[1:15:17] are like Samson who was God's family and
[1:15:20] they're laying in bed with Delilah
[1:15:23] and too many of God's family are laying
[1:15:26] in bed with Laodicea come on that's a
[1:15:30] strong statement but it's the truth and
[1:15:32] that's that's a lot of times why you
[1:15:34] don't have the discernment you need
[1:15:35] that's a lot of times why you don't have
[1:15:37] the wisdom you need and you get in the
[1:15:39] spot and you need it to demonstrate
[1:15:40] itself and it would if it could a man
[1:15:47] all that God was reporting Christ all
[1:15:49] Christ was important in church the Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost now the enemy's got something see
[1:15:53] then he isn't fighting something back
[1:15:55] here all right now let's look at first
[1:15:58] Corinthians 3:16 no you're not that you
[1:16:01] are the temple of God and that the
[1:16:04] Spirit of God dwelleth in you now I read
[1:16:07] to you revelation 11
[1:16:09] he's measuring the temple and all those
[1:16:13] who worship therein not the outer that's
[1:16:16] given to the Gentiles they're headed
[1:16:18] into a tribulation 42 months they're not
[1:16:21] even measured because they're not born
[1:16:22] again they're not the perfection of the
[1:16:23] word only those who are there in
[1:16:26] dwelling therein that's the temple of
[1:16:29] God 2nd Corinthians he says when he
[1:16:32] writes to him again and what agreement
[1:16:34] has the temple of God with idols for ye
[1:16:38] are the Temple of the Living God as God
[1:16:41] hath said I will dwell in them and walk
[1:16:44] in them and I will be their God and they
[1:16:48] shall be my people now a lot of people
[1:16:52] love the idea of him dwelling in you but
[1:16:58] he's not interested in merely dwelling
[1:17:01] in you he wants to walk in you
[1:17:04] you understand so he doesn't just want
[1:17:07] to be a nice idea or a correct teachable
[1:17:10] doctrine he wants to be able to live and
[1:17:13] manifest himself brother brother Jason
[1:17:15] was speaking on that this morning in his
[1:17:17] Godhead teaching that it's God
[1:17:19] manifesting himself and here he comes
[1:17:22] now he wants to be what agreement hath
[1:17:25] the temple of God with idols for ye are
[1:17:27] the Temple of the Living God as God hath
[1:17:28] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[1:17:30] them and I will be their God and they
[1:17:33] shall be my people
[1:17:34] all right you still with me he's still
[1:17:38] with me all right now brother branham
[1:17:41] comes to a hidden life he says now this
[1:17:45] 1955 this setup and I'm gonna do this in
[1:17:48] chronological order the setup of God's
[1:17:50] Tabernacle in the wilderness the first
[1:17:53] was the congregation then the holy place
[1:17:55] then the holiest of Holies that's that's
[1:17:59] the part that got measured in revelation
[1:18:01] 11 that's God's house that's God's
[1:18:06] dwelling place that's your dwelling
[1:18:10] place so in revelation 11 the last thing
[1:18:14] we see of the Gentile church in verse 1
[1:18:18] and going into 2 is God measuring his
[1:18:22] dwelling place and not on purpose not
[1:18:26] measuring outside of that ok so now
[1:18:30] watch that's your dwelling place now you
[1:18:33] only live in three room house remember
[1:18:35] you may have two bedrooms you may have
[1:18:37] three kitchens but whoa and women love
[1:18:39] that three kitchens but you only live in
[1:18:42] a three room house God lived in a three
[1:18:46] room house when God was here on earth he
[1:18:49] occupied a three room house the soul
[1:18:52] body and spirit of Jesus Christ in the
[1:18:57] temp in the tent in the temporal temple
[1:18:59] see in the temporal temple he's in a
[1:19:04] congregation holy place and holiest of
[1:19:08] Holies that the holy the holy of holies
[1:19:12] isn't actually a scriptural term it's
[1:19:14] called the most holy place but it's the
[1:19:16] same thing
[1:19:17] each one of them was separated one from
[1:19:21] another you see he measured those who
[1:19:23] dwell in but he's separated he didn't
[1:19:25] measure those out you understand each
[1:19:28] one of them was separated from one
[1:19:30] another and each one had different
[1:19:31] furniture in it to show the dwelling
[1:19:34] place now look at that a very beautiful
[1:19:37] type of the church this is that's why
[1:19:42] when I look at 11:1 I'm seeing the
[1:19:45] church I'm seeing the last testimony of
[1:19:48] you all right now watch or go to back to
[1:19:52] Paul Ephesians 2 now therefore ye are no
[1:19:56] more strangers and foreigners but
[1:19:58] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[1:20:02] the household of God and are built upon
[1:20:05] the foundation of the apostles and
[1:20:07] prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the
[1:20:09] chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[1:20:12] building fitly framed together groweth
[1:20:15] unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom
[1:20:19] he also are builded together for a
[1:20:22] habitation of God through the spirit
[1:20:26] right now brother Branham comes to 1962
[1:20:29] we were in 55 now let's look in 62 he
[1:20:32] comes to the message the stature of a
[1:20:35] perfect man and I'm always cautioning
[1:20:37] the people not statue
[1:20:39] we got enough statues in the message not
[1:20:42] looking to establish you as statues
[1:20:45] statues don't move in there lifeless a
[1:20:47] man if you become a statue will sit you
[1:20:50] out in the road amen we want people in
[1:20:53] the stature of the of a perfect man but
[1:20:58] now watch because it got titled that and
[1:21:02] with brother branham's blessing but it
[1:21:05] but that but brother Branham announces
[1:21:07] his subject then this morning here's
[1:21:10] what the subject is about this morning
[1:21:13] we want to speak on the subject the
[1:21:16] building the Living Tabernacle building
[1:21:20] the building the living tabernacle of
[1:21:24] the Living God's dwelling place the
[1:21:27] perfect man
[1:21:29] so you're when you come to revelation 11
[1:21:32] 1 you're seeing a perfect man you're
[1:21:35] seeing the bride in her perfection so
[1:21:39] perfect so perfect she's measurable why
[1:21:42] she measured to prove to the devil to
[1:21:44] the world that she fit every measure of
[1:21:47] the Word of God no wonder we had to have
[1:21:50] seven seals open no wonder we had to
[1:21:52] have the word become a lie because we
[1:21:55] couldn't go as a deformed bride we had
[1:21:58] to be the perfection of the word if
[1:22:02] you've got the perfect word making you
[1:22:05] the perfection of the word then why
[1:22:08] would you live in fear over things that
[1:22:10] are happening in the earth see the
[1:22:16] perfect man the living Tabernacle of the
[1:22:19] Living God
[1:22:20] where he dwells the Holy Ghost here he
[1:22:24] comes to the end of the message he's
[1:22:26] going to some it's a summation the Holy
[1:22:28] Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy
[1:22:32] Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism
[1:22:34] of the Holy Ghost and you got all these
[1:22:37] virtues sealed in you then God lives in
[1:22:41] a tabernacle called the building the
[1:22:45] living tabernacle of the Living God's
[1:22:48] place isn't that beautiful Paul comes to
[1:22:52] Hebrews 3 for every house is builded by
[1:22:55] some men but he that built all things is
[1:22:59] God and Moses verily was faithful in all
[1:23:02] his house truly he was as a servant for
[1:23:06] a testimony of those things which were
[1:23:09] to be spoken after but Christ as the son
[1:23:14] over his own house whose house are we if
[1:23:18] we hope if we hold fast the confidence
[1:23:21] and the rejoicing of the hope Fermin to
[1:23:24] the end it doesn't do me any good to
[1:23:28] have a house if if squatters and
[1:23:30] trespassers are living in it God doesn't
[1:23:33] want Leo to see our living in his house
[1:23:36] he wants his house to be filled with
[1:23:39] film see brother branham comes now to
[1:23:45] 1964 the future home I love that title
[1:23:49] the future home of the heavenly
[1:23:52] bridegroom and the earthly bride see the
[1:23:57] this is the earthly bride it's finishing
[1:24:01] out he doesn't leave us chapter 10 you
[1:24:04] know and like I said mankind made it ten
[1:24:07] eleven and then eleven one jaundice
[1:24:10] wrote it continuously and if you stop it
[1:24:13] verse 11 of chapter ten you're left with
[1:24:16] an uncertain there's no ending it's just
[1:24:18] it's just out there it's a it's a
[1:24:20] cliffhanger
[1:24:20] how does this end what happens well read
[1:24:24] the next verse that she's now become the
[1:24:28] perfect tabernacle of the Living God's
[1:24:30] dwelling place watch future home but
[1:24:35] there was the Redeemer on earth at that
[1:24:37] time to redeem those attributes of God
[1:24:40] and she received it she never questioned
[1:24:42] it she said when Messiah cometh he'll do
[1:24:45] this and that settled it and she's seen
[1:24:47] it done so he said I'm the Messiah so
[1:24:50] that settled it no more question she
[1:24:53] just went telling everybody come see
[1:24:56] what I found these processes make us
[1:25:00] clean a temple for his dwelling place
[1:25:04] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:25:07] the Holy Ghost with fire that does the
[1:25:09] cleansing of our this temple so so we we
[1:25:17] realized that when when when eleven one
[1:25:21] speaks of a temple being measured I go
[1:25:24] back to my Bible and back to the message
[1:25:26] to figure out what's this temple he's
[1:25:29] talking about I think I've made my case
[1:25:32] this morning and I'm here at a friend's
[1:25:34] it's a challenge to you to say put me
[1:25:37] down I want to be in that number I want
[1:25:40] to become the measurable perfection I
[1:25:42] want to be the dwelling place the
[1:25:45] fullness of his presence in my life
[1:25:48] here's another one look at what Peter
[1:25:50] says here now I before I turn to Peter
[1:25:54] I've been saying to you how that that if
[1:25:57] we're preaching on Christ and the
[1:26:00] kingdom of Saints then when we so many
[1:26:04] places in the Bible I haven't spent a
[1:26:06] lot of time doing it but what I'm about
[1:26:09] to read does it a lot and that is that
[1:26:13] it literally gives us if we're if we're
[1:26:17] if we're Christ and the kingdom of
[1:26:20] Saints then there ought to be Kingdom
[1:26:22] principles for this life if we're going
[1:26:26] to be part of a kingdom then there's got
[1:26:28] to be what makes us a kingdom you know
[1:26:31] because you're prettier than the
[1:26:33] denominations because you got better
[1:26:35] teaching than denominations the devil
[1:26:37] don't even care about your teaching it's
[1:26:40] not a bit worried about that than
[1:26:41] anything he's not afraid of how much
[1:26:44] knowledge you have and understand and
[1:26:45] unable to unlock you know symbolism and
[1:26:48] types and shadows in the Bible and put
[1:26:50] it all together what he's afraid of is
[1:26:52] you becoming the temple of God's life
[1:26:54] that's what he fears is that you will
[1:26:58] literally not know the word but be the
[1:27:00] word hallelujah
[1:27:02] that's why Jesus never had to never need
[1:27:05] to carry a Bible he didn't need to carry
[1:27:07] an Old Testament Bible he was the word
[1:27:08] walking around when he stood against
[1:27:10] those doctors of divinity he just he
[1:27:12] just started it starts coming out of him
[1:27:14] it what came out of him as natural as
[1:27:16] anything why because he was the fullness
[1:27:18] of the word watch so brother so Peter
[1:27:23] says here wherefore now here's some
[1:27:26] kingdom principles there's some kingdom
[1:27:29] principles this ain't all about just you
[1:27:31] know a thorough preaching where we all
[1:27:34] just have a big big big joyous dance and
[1:27:37] we don't never come down and put it down
[1:27:39] into the gears because he said I want to
[1:27:41] dwell in you and I want to walk in you
[1:27:43] see now here's how he walks in you
[1:27:46] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:27:49] all guile and hypocrisy and envies and
[1:27:53] all evil speakings as newborn babes he's
[1:27:57] telling you how to be a kingdom how many
[1:27:58] more to be a kingdom member
[1:27:59] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:28:02] of the word that you may grow thereby
[1:28:04] how many want to grow if so be you have
[1:28:08] tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom
[1:28:10] coming as unto a living stone disallowed
[1:28:14] indeed of men see they don't like the
[1:28:15] word they never have
[1:28:17] they've always been against it as unto a
[1:28:19] living stone disallowed indeed of men
[1:28:21] but chosen of God and precious ye all so
[1:28:25] he's not just talking about Jesus ye
[1:28:29] also as lively stones are built up a
[1:28:32] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[1:28:35] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:28:38] to God by Jesus Christ so God was God
[1:28:44] never lived you know in the end the man
[1:28:48] Christ Jesus just to stay in one single
[1:28:50] body he's now moving into a temple see
[1:28:53] that that's why you remember we read the
[1:28:56] quote here just a few frames before
[1:28:58] where he said in the Garden of Eden it
[1:29:01] was spoken word he tore it down and then
[1:29:04] it became flesh and then he crucified it
[1:29:05] and brother and said but now it's in the
[1:29:08] body that's what I was telling you a
[1:29:09] couple services ago they've been trying
[1:29:12] to kill the Holy Child since since
[1:29:14] Genesis they've been after the golden
[1:29:16] child well they'll never find the holy
[1:29:18] child because the holy child is now the
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost living inside of a church
[1:29:23] hallelujah he's living in me oh is he
[1:29:27] living in you today say Lord living me
[1:29:31] help me to get all these trespassers out
[1:29:34] of your house and out of my mind and out
[1:29:36] of my heart make my temple clean for the
[1:29:40] Holy Ghost I have oh I don't know how to
[1:29:46] end it brother Kevin that's that's my
[1:29:48] last slide um there you go
[1:29:52] you know I I've lived you know a
[1:29:55] Christian life for many years and I I
[1:29:57] was looking I I pulled this note and
[1:30:00] I've amended it a little bit because I
[1:30:01] pulled it out of an old file and it just
[1:30:03] meant so much to me in this sermon as I
[1:30:06] read it again and I and I and I I said
[1:30:10] some years ago about how that I've lived
[1:30:13] the
[1:30:13] Christian life for many years and you
[1:30:16] know something friends there the world
[1:30:18] is full of doubters full of atheists and
[1:30:21] agnostics who just who'd just stand in
[1:30:24] your face and defy the name of the
[1:30:26] Living God
[1:30:27] see and but to which to which I say to
[1:30:31] them they've written they've written
[1:30:32] songs about it you know one of the one
[1:30:35] of the most famous songs john lennon
[1:30:37] ever wrote was you know about you know
[1:30:40] what if there's no heaven above us no
[1:30:42] Hell beneath us you know and and I
[1:30:44] guarantee he don't think that anymore
[1:30:45] and and I I just said this that I
[1:30:50] declare that whether or not I'm right or
[1:30:52] wrong
[1:30:54] whether I'm revelaed adore deluded I'm
[1:30:57] still the winner I'm stiff there was no
[1:31:02] heaven or hell I'd still want to live a
[1:31:04] Christian life see I'd rather live by
[1:31:08] the principles that Jesus left us even
[1:31:12] if there's no heaven or hell even if
[1:31:15] there's no life after this life and this
[1:31:17] is it I still win because I have lived a
[1:31:23] better life than all those who have not
[1:31:26] lived for him I've been happier by far
[1:31:30] than many others who have had much more
[1:31:34] of this Earth's Goods than me many
[1:31:37] people with with a hundred million
[1:31:40] dollars in the bank and lose ninety nine
[1:31:44] of those million jump out of a 50-story
[1:31:47] building because they're down to only a
[1:31:49] million dollars I've only got a million
[1:31:53] dollars left I better just kill myself
[1:31:56] I'm here to taste something friends I've
[1:31:58] been happier by far have not having that
[1:32:03] I didn't you know what i'ma tell you
[1:32:04] something friends here's something as
[1:32:06] since I've been a Christian that I
[1:32:08] haven't had to deal with
[1:32:09] I haven't give my hard-earned money to
[1:32:11] the enemy for partying and fancy living
[1:32:13] hey man I'm not in a doctor's office
[1:32:17] today because of a hard fast sinful
[1:32:19] lifestyle that wrecked my body and burn
[1:32:22] up my mind and I'm
[1:32:23] there nobody can help me I don't know
[1:32:25] I'm better having been a Christian I'm
[1:32:30] better in even when I've had to go to
[1:32:33] the doctor's office I've had a
[1:32:35] supernatural care over me to this day
[1:32:40] I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:32:43] Christ I'm here to tell you it's the
[1:32:45] power of God unto salvation and I'm
[1:32:47] happy to be a Christian I only wish I
[1:32:49] would have always been a Christian I
[1:32:53] have a happy home a happy marriage happy
[1:32:58] children happy grandchildren who all
[1:33:01] love the Lord
[1:33:02] I have happy friends all over the world
[1:33:04] who share my joy and share this faith I
[1:33:07] have a happy ministry associates who
[1:33:10] share the same common denominator that I
[1:33:13] possess I'm here to tell you something
[1:33:15] friends I'd be a Christian if there was
[1:33:18] no heaven or hell I didn't go to bed
[1:33:20] with emptiness I didn't go to bed with
[1:33:22] longing and searching and trying to
[1:33:24] figure my life out I already figured it
[1:33:27] out hallelujah
[1:33:29] and I'm fully satisfied I love declaring
[1:33:37] that to the Lord because when I say it I
[1:33:40] mean it I can look him right in the eye
[1:33:43] say Lord I want you to know you are more
[1:33:46] than enough for me
[1:33:48] you're more than enough for me
[1:33:51] and I'm only sorry for my miserable
[1:33:54] failures and weaknesses and I don't want
[1:33:57] them and I'm repenting afresh and fill
[1:33:59] me up again and clean out everything in
[1:34:01] the world let my mind be filled with
[1:34:03] your word because I want to have a life
[1:34:06] of the word I don't it doesn't matter if
[1:34:08] there's not a heaven or hell if it
[1:34:09] doesn't matter if this is yet I want it
[1:34:11] anyway it's a better life see we all
[1:34:17] come into the world dying the day you
[1:34:20] breathe air the clock's ticking you've
[1:34:22] got a you got her an expiration date I'm
[1:34:24] sorry
[1:34:25] only those who are alive and remain it
[1:34:28] is coming don't die so we're all dying I
[1:34:32] can't stop it it's eventual it's a
[1:34:33] certainty
[1:34:36] so I just want to keep my life in his
[1:34:38] hands and be grateful for everything I
[1:34:42] just want to keep my life in his hands
[1:34:44] and be grateful for everything when it's
[1:34:50] all been said and done and I you know I
[1:34:54] still have this crossing date and and I
[1:34:57] realized that say that's a morbid
[1:35:00] thought it's actually not because it
[1:35:02] brings me to a very positive thought
[1:35:04] I've very let me say a different word it
[1:35:06] brings me to a very productive thought
[1:35:09] because if I realize my mortality and I
[1:35:11] realize no matter what I do I can try to
[1:35:14] keep this body healthy but it's still
[1:35:15] dying I can do everything the doctor
[1:35:17] says and take all the vitamins I need
[1:35:19] but I'm still dying unless I go in the
[1:35:22] rapture I'm gonna die you understand so
[1:35:25] so then if that's if that's true then
[1:35:29] then here comes my question my
[1:35:31] productive question well then what am i
[1:35:33] doing about this short life that I've
[1:35:36] been given what am I doing with this
[1:35:39] short temporal temporary life that God
[1:35:44] has given me what do I expect my
[1:35:47] earnings to be on the other side I want
[1:35:54] to know when I reach my expiration date
[1:35:58] I want to know I counted for something
[1:36:01] eternal if it if your life isn't living
[1:36:07] for this purpose you have no meaning
[1:36:10] you're just going in a circle you're
[1:36:14] just you know you're just chained to
[1:36:16] Pharaoh's chariot and you're pulling him
[1:36:18] around you're his slave you're you you
[1:36:21] you're born in sin you you pull the
[1:36:23] devil around in his chariot like a slave
[1:36:25] and then you die and then you go to hell
[1:36:28] really and and and so you'd rather you'd
[1:36:31] rather be an atheist you'd rather be a
[1:36:33] sinner not me I'd rather turn to the one
[1:36:36] who who offers me life I'd rather talk
[1:36:39] not just life coming but life now life
[1:36:42] with purpose today and when I wake up
[1:36:45] tomorrow I have a purpose when I go to
[1:36:47] sleep
[1:36:48] night I have a purpose I want to know I
[1:36:52] counted for something more than chasing
[1:36:54] lair Tasya I want to know that I rose
[1:36:56] above mediocrity that I lived in the
[1:36:59] upper atmospheres where an eagle ought
[1:37:01] to live hallelujah
[1:37:08] Shakespeare is very famous for the
[1:37:10] statement to be or not to be his
[1:37:15] character Hamlet is literally
[1:37:16] contemplating death and suicide and you
[1:37:22] know bemoaning the pain and unfairness
[1:37:24] of life because life is filled with pain
[1:37:27] and unfairness I'm here to take some
[1:37:29] young people get this get this straight
[1:37:31] life ain't fair and if you just sit
[1:37:34] around sniffling and sulking in a corner
[1:37:36] because you got treated unfair you'll
[1:37:38] sit in that corner till you're dead
[1:37:40] cause life ain't fair at all life was
[1:37:44] meant to be a struggle brother man said
[1:37:45] people don't want to struggle he said
[1:37:47] struggles is good
[1:37:48] you need to struggle otherwise you don't
[1:37:50] never gain any strength you don't never
[1:37:52] do anything you don't never accomplish
[1:37:54] anything you don't ever overcome
[1:37:56] anything and Hamlet's it's contemplating
[1:38:00] death and suicide because of all the
[1:38:02] pain and the unfairness of life but he's
[1:38:05] acknowledging to be or not to be he's
[1:38:09] acknowledging that yeah wow there's lots
[1:38:11] of pain and unfairness uh should I kill
[1:38:15] myself I don't know to be or not to be
[1:38:17] because the alternative might be worse
[1:38:20] yeah it's pretty bad right here and
[1:38:22] maybe I should just end it all but jeez
[1:38:24] that the alternative might be worse and
[1:38:26] that's his that's his dilemma that's
[1:38:27] Hamlisch dilemma to be or not to be this
[1:38:33] is pretty bad I get treated pretty
[1:38:35] unfair all this bad stuff but this I
[1:38:38] really might make me I might go from the
[1:38:40] frying pan to the fire he tries to
[1:38:45] decide if living or dying is best all I
[1:38:47] wish you know where I was Shakespeare
[1:38:49] would have read Paul in Philippians
[1:38:50] chapter one for me to live is Christ and
[1:38:53] to die is gain I'm here to tell you it's
[1:38:56] not about to be or not to be it's I am
[1:38:58] because he made me and I'm here because
[1:39:01] he put me here
[1:39:01] and I got a purpose because he lives
[1:39:04] hallelujah and when this life's over
[1:39:06] it ain't over hallelujah when this life
[1:39:11] is over it ain't over it's just starting
[1:39:14] hallelujah
[1:39:15] Oh some glorious morning when we sit
[1:39:20] across that table thousands of miles
