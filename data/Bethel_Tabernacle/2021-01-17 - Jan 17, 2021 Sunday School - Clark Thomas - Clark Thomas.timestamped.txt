[0:28] so
[0:42] so
[0:56] do
[1:08] [Music]
[1:24] so
[1:38] so
[1:51] [Music]
[1:52] do
[1:58] [Music]
[2:06] so
[2:19] god bless you amen let's stand and
[2:23] bow our heads in the word of prayer
[2:30] dear lord i thank you for this
[2:31] opportunity
[2:33] to express what's on my heart and we
[2:36] just pray that this will help us to be
[2:37] more sincere
[2:39] border in our testimonies have a greater
[2:42] faith in you
[2:44] a greater faith in your word a greater
[2:46] faith in your promises
[2:48] and by doing so have a greater faith in
[2:50] one another because we do know
[2:52] that this is a relationship
[2:56] it's a relationship between
[2:59] the god of heaven and his elect and lord
[3:03] we just want to grow
[3:03] in that and
[3:07] so lord we just commit this service this
[3:10] uh sunday school lesson to you
[3:11] in jesus christ's name amen
[3:18] the scripture i would like to speak on
[3:21] this morning
[3:22] is first john chapter four
[3:30] and just the first four verses i think
[3:33] we're going to
[3:34] just start with the first verse
[3:41] first john 4 verse 1 beloved
[3:45] believe not every spirit but try the
[3:47] spirits
[3:49] whether they are of god because many
[3:51] false prophets
[3:53] are gone out into the world and you may
[3:56] be seated
[3:58] i want to stop here in just a moment
[4:03] the question is not whether you follow a
[4:06] prophet
[4:08] because everybody in a sense follows a
[4:12] prophet
[4:14] most everybody has somebody that they
[4:17] turn to
[4:19] when they want to make sure that they're
[4:20] on track spiritually all right
[4:23] so the real question is who is your
[4:26] prophet
[4:29] now in a general sense it could be your
[4:31] pastor
[4:33] or your mentor or your pastor's mentor
[4:38] or some general overseer whoever it
[4:41] might be
[4:44] in other words it may be somebody who
[4:47] doesn't even
[4:48] actually have the office of a prophet
[4:51] nor claims to yeah and we know
[4:54] throughout history
[4:57] where there have been people who were
[4:59] not prophets martin luther
[5:01] william tyndale george whitfield
[5:04] john wesley charles finney are examples
[5:06] of that
[5:07] they were not prophets but they had the
[5:10] right vision to direct others
[5:14] then there have been those who've had
[5:15] the wrong visions
[5:18] a modern day example of that is ed
[5:20] sullivan
[5:21] who presented elvis presley in the
[5:23] beatles as wholesome entertainment
[5:27] and not to mention our hollywood culture
[5:30] that caused good evil and evil good
[5:34] and even good people with bad visions
[5:38] are not people you want to be following
[5:40] amen
[5:43] and sometimes it's those people who will
[5:45] deceive you the worst because you expect
[5:47] better things of them
[5:50] but remember a counterfeit can only hurt
[5:54] you
[5:55] if you are counting on there being a
[5:56] genuine oh yeah wow
[6:01] i can't be deceived by russian rubles
[6:04] because i'm not going to accept them
[6:05] anyway right bring me some american
[6:08] currency and we'll talk
[6:11] but now you come along with a
[6:12] counterfeit 20 bill you can hurt me
[6:14] because i think i have something of
[6:15] value and i really don't
[6:19] then i'll have something i need to
[6:20] verify so there we go to verse 2.
[6:27] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[6:30] spirit that confesseth
[6:31] that jesus christ is coming the flesh
[6:35] is of god and every spirit
[6:39] that confesseth not that jesus christ
[6:42] has come in the flesh
[6:44] is not of god and this
[6:47] is that spirit of antichrist whereof
[6:51] you have heard that it should come and
[6:54] even now
[6:55] already is in the world many people
[6:59] read right past this scripture satisfied
[7:02] that they have the spirit of christ
[7:04] simply because they believe jesus came
[7:06] in the flesh
[7:08] and that he was the son of god that's
[7:11] their testimony
[7:13] straightforward reading right
[7:18] if you profess to be a christian you go
[7:19] to heaven and if you die without
[7:21] becoming a christian
[7:22] you're eternally lost but everybody
[7:26] knows it's not that simple
[7:28] james 2 19
[7:32] states thou believest that there is one
[7:35] god
[7:37] they'll do us well the devils also
[7:40] believe and tremble
[7:44] now after jesus gave the devil a
[7:46] whipping there in the wilderness
[7:48] no demon ever said if thou be the son of
[7:49] god
[7:52] no spiritual demon anyway rather
[7:56] they said jesus thou son of god they'll
[7:58] come to
[7:59] hither to torment us before our time
[8:04] so it can't be that right
[8:07] and so in our carnal thinking we try to
[8:10] change it into doctrinal statements
[8:13] an intellectual belief in the historical
[8:16] accuracy of the bible for example
[8:18] or at least that jesus actually existed
[8:20] as he's portrayed in the bible
[8:22] and that he was actually the son of god
[8:24] that he was actually god himself
[8:26] the son of god
[8:30] but then we turn it into a certain model
[8:32] of the godhead
[8:33] and it doesn't really matter
[8:37] what that consensus is whether it's a
[8:39] oneness model
[8:40] a trinitarian model a unitarian model
[8:44] it's only a model all right
[8:48] you know in science a chemist has the
[8:53] intellectual honesty
[8:55] to know that he's never seen an atom he
[8:57] only has a model for it
[8:58] and so science has enough humility to
[9:02] realize
[9:02] that model could be wrong but it works
[9:04] and so we have models that work for us
[9:06] and what we
[9:08] always need to be growing in our
[9:09] understanding of god
[9:12] you can't place your faith in a model
[9:14] because it's only a model
[9:16] it's not a final understanding of who
[9:18] god is
[9:20] if you're married you know you never get
[9:21] figure your own spouse out
[9:24] how are you going to figure god out
[9:27] but you can believe every scripture
[9:29] without trying to force some carnal
[9:32] understanding yes here's the challenge
[9:37] how can the father-son relationship be
[9:40] greater
[9:41] than the bridegroom relationship when
[9:44] the scripture says that a man must leave
[9:45] his father and mother
[9:47] so that he can cleave his wife and
[9:48] become one flesh you got a real problem
[9:50] if you've got godhead wrong on that one
[9:55] so there's a real problem with these
[9:56] doctrinal issues
[9:58] and the problem is that it takes
[10:01] absolutely no revelation
[10:03] to agree with somebody else on doctrine
[10:07] all we have all we ever have to do is
[10:08] find that one person we believe to be
[10:10] more spiritual than anybody else and say
[10:12] you're right
[10:14] goodness end of story
[10:17] we can go home do whatever we want to do
[10:21] and wait for the lord to take us home
[10:22] either by the grave or by the rapture
[10:27] that's not too far from people's
[10:30] theology
[10:32] that attitude god doesn't care what we
[10:34] do he only cares what we think
[10:38] if we're not careful we fall into this
[10:41] doctrinal legalism
[10:43] in which we gravitate to those who think
[10:46] the way we do
[10:48] regardless of how they act
[10:52] when we need to be considering that
[10:54] member of the body of christ
[10:56] who may be just as sincere as we are but
[10:59] sees things a little differently
[11:03] for an analogy
[11:07] just to give myself an extra challenge
[11:09] by doing a visual here
[11:14] i think this will work
[11:18] okay i have a
[11:22] i brought a jigsaw puzzle with me and on
[11:25] the box
[11:26] here's this nice i don't know if the
[11:29] camera can see it well i don't know if
[11:30] you can
[11:30] there might be a reflection or something
[11:31] right here but there's this dolphin
[11:34] on the picture like flipper not
[11:38] the waihewahi but it's got this nice
[11:40] trim around it
[11:42] it's a very neat picture very pleasant
[11:45] picture
[11:47] so open this box and this is what i find
[11:54] wait what are you gonna do with that
[11:58] the picture is nice and rectangular but
[12:01] the pieces
[12:02] have all these rough edges
[12:06] now we don't like rough edges
[12:10] let me find a couple pieces here where i
[12:11] can make my point
[12:16] i think that's it or maybe that's it
[12:19] we don't like our rough edges so what do
[12:21] we do we try to hide our rough edges
[12:27] we go around acting like we have it all
[12:29] together
[12:32] so the people like us people respect us
[12:34] people follow us
[12:36] but that's exactly the opposite of what
[12:38] the bible tells us to do
[12:41] okay james 5 16 confess your faults one
[12:43] to another
[12:45] and pray for one another that you may be
[12:47] healed
[12:48] if we want healing that's the way to do
[12:49] it in other words
[12:52] let's admit that we all have rough edges
[12:56] and without the other pieces of the
[12:58] puzzle
[12:59] other members of the body we're not
[13:02] going to be complete
[13:05] here's my confession i need a revival
[13:13] without even having to be specific i'll
[13:15] just tell you i have things i have to
[13:16] overcome
[13:18] in a way that i haven't overcome them
[13:20] the way that i want to
[13:23] and i need people with the same burden
[13:25] that i have
[13:30] you know so that we can minister to one
[13:31] another and if i can light your fire
[13:33] then maybe you can light mine
[13:36] maybe we can help light each other's
[13:37] fire i need more faith
[13:40] i need to be more sincere i need to be
[13:44] delivered from this body of flesh
[13:47] and i thrive on encouragement from
[13:49] others who have that same vision
[13:53] and if it's true of me then maybe it's
[13:55] true of you
[13:58] but so often we don't confess we act as
[14:01] though we alone
[14:02] have it all together or our own little
[14:04] our own little group has it all together
[14:06] we'll get a few pieces and we'll just
[14:07] trim it off to where there's this one
[14:09] box nothing else connects to
[14:11] we hide our rough edges and by hiding
[14:14] our rough edges by by
[14:16] not acknowledging our rough edges we
[14:17] fail to connect with the rest of the
[14:19] body of christ
[14:19] my goodness
[14:23] the bible speaks of the lamb
[14:26] jesus christ having a bride
[14:29] can anybody show me where it says he has
[14:31] a harem
[14:36] just as every piece of this
[14:40] puzzle in this box here is part of the
[14:43] same puzzle
[14:44] yeah wow so is every member of the bride
[14:46] of christ part of a single functioning
[14:48] body
[14:50] beautiful there is no competition
[14:54] wow it's good because i'd probably lose
[14:56] anyway
[15:01] so as
[15:07] we can't take one another's place you
[15:08] can't you can't swap pieces here
[15:12] as long as there's one member of the
[15:14] body who is not in his or her rightful
[15:17] position
[15:18] there will be rough edges and that's
[15:22] okay
[15:25] that is why ministries that are not all
[15:28] smooth
[15:29] and polished don't bother me
[15:33] it is the rough edges that connect us to
[15:35] one another
[15:38] being all proper and polished does not
[15:40] bring jesus christ on the scene
[15:43] on the other hand if you have the holy
[15:47] ghost then by definition
[15:48] god dwells in you and that's the jesus
[15:52] christ
[15:53] that's come in the flesh that john the
[15:54] apostle spoke of
[15:57] now it's easy to say that about the
[15:59] apostles and the prophets
[16:01] but it's even true of that member of the
[16:05] body of christ whom we esteem
[16:07] the least whoever that might be
[16:14] that is exactly where we need to be the
[16:15] most careful all right
[16:17] we must never make one person outside of
[16:19] jesus christ himself the entirety of the
[16:21] body
[16:24] it is not that person that you esteem
[16:25] the most
[16:28] but jesus said as you have done it
[16:31] unto one of the least of these
[16:35] that's what judges us not the greatest
[16:39] the least
[16:42] once the puzzle is complete talking
[16:44] about the body of christ
[16:45] there will be no rough edges if there
[16:48] are any pieces left over
[16:51] they weren't part of the puzzle to begin
[16:52] with
[16:54] it's not because we threw them out wow
[16:57] it's because they didn't line up
[17:00] they just refused to join themselves to
[17:02] christ
[17:04] and then by their own choice they're
[17:06] left outside
[17:09] so it is essential that we discern the
[17:11] lord's body
[17:12] amen it's all about growth
[17:18] we ourselves must grow and we must allow
[17:22] others to grow
[17:24] and that's why both repentance and
[17:26] forgiveness are so important
[17:31] there's certainly a shortage of that in
[17:32] the country in our country right now
[17:34] amen
[17:38] my favorite most
[17:42] most recently really becoming my
[17:43] favorite book of the bible is the book
[17:44] of job
[17:46] job was a righteous man who looked out
[17:49] for everybody and he just could not
[17:51] understand
[17:52] why god did not seem to be looking out
[17:54] for him and to make matters worse
[17:57] god wasn't answering any of his
[17:58] questions
[18:00] and job actually had a case
[18:04] yet we get all pouty because god doesn't
[18:06] answer all of our questions
[18:07] as though it's is over entitled to that
[18:10] more than job was
[18:14] it was those very unanswered questions
[18:16] that gave job most of his growth
[18:20] meanwhile it was those around him that
[18:23] were coming up with answers but they
[18:24] were the wrong answers
[18:27] so don't fear the hard questions fear
[18:30] the answers that come too easily
[18:35] the one strike job had against him was
[18:38] thinking he was more righteous than god
[18:39] was because
[18:41] based on his limited understanding here
[18:42] he was he would do things for other
[18:43] people and god was just letting him
[18:45] suffer and perhaps the main purpose of
[18:49] this test
[18:50] was to bring job to a place of
[18:51] understanding that god had all things
[18:54] under control
[18:55] even when he seemed not to and that his
[18:58] ways are perfect
[18:59] even when it seems they aren't and it
[19:02] finally
[19:03] shook job to the place where he realized
[19:06] he couldn't be holding a grudge against
[19:08] god of all people
[19:11] so job had to repent by forgiving god
[19:14] let that sink in and then everything was
[19:17] restored to him
[19:19] even more so so if job outside of
[19:24] christ perhaps the most righteous man
[19:26] ever
[19:28] could not experience victory without
[19:30] reconciling himself to god
[19:32] who has never been guilty of anything
[19:35] how much more do we need to reconcile
[19:37] ourselves to one another through
[19:38] repentance
[19:39] and forgiveness
[19:43] one of the greatest hindrance hindrances
[19:46] to unity in the body of christ is our
[19:50] failure to forgive
[19:53] and often it's not that person who's
[19:54] completely betrayed you
[19:56] it's that person who merely irritated
[19:57] you
[20:00] you know you know what i'm talking about
[20:02] that person whose heart you're always
[20:04] blessing because you can't bring
[20:05] yourself to actually respect him
[20:08] well bless his heart bless her heart and
[20:10] then you're going to describe how that
[20:11] person was 15 years ago
[20:14] we've got to let people grow come on
[20:17] we've got to have grace for one another
[20:20] so maybe it's that person who's just a
[20:21] little more legalistic than you are
[20:22] maybe not legalistic enough
[20:24] or has some doctrinal difference with
[20:27] you over some
[20:28] relatively minor point
[20:34] if you want to take that approach of
[20:36] agreeing to disagree
[20:37] and break fellowship that's totally up
[20:40] to you
[20:42] but let's be very clear in doing that
[20:46] you are making a declaration that you
[20:48] and that other person are not part of
[20:49] the same body
[20:51] wow and we
[20:54] we need to be very careful about being
[20:55] on the wrong side of that division
[20:58] particularly right now
[21:01] the problem with the pharisees of jesus
[21:04] day
[21:05] is not that they called sin sin sin is
[21:08] sin
[21:09] the problem was they labeled the sinner
[21:11] a sinner without any opportunity to
[21:13] reconcile
[21:15] there's nothing wrong today with
[21:16] preaching against sin
[21:19] and we have standards of holiness sure
[21:22] so let's discuss where those standards
[21:23] of holiness came from
[21:26] now everything we believe is based on
[21:27] the bible
[21:31] that's true and yet
[21:35] the bible leaves a lot of room for
[21:36] interpretation
[21:40] okay the bible says that a woman should
[21:42] have long hair
[21:44] how long it says a man should have short
[21:48] hair
[21:49] how short it says men and women should
[21:52] should dress certain ways but what
[21:54] constitutes a man's dress or a woman's
[21:56] dress
[21:58] women are to be modest but how do you
[22:00] measure that
[22:02] all right which activities
[22:05] are associated with sin and worldliness
[22:07] and which ones aren't
[22:10] so if the bible does not specifically
[22:11] say then the correct answers can only
[22:14] come by the holy ghost
[22:17] yet if i read the bible and you read the
[22:19] bible
[22:20] we get two different interpretations
[22:22] think about it
[22:24] even if we have the same profit we end
[22:27] up with two different interpretations
[22:30] i may put the more strict interpretation
[22:32] on things you may put the less
[22:34] strict interpretation on things or the
[22:35] other way around so how does the holy
[22:38] ghost resolve this
[22:40] the answer is through our influence on
[22:43] one another
[22:46] throughout the reformation
[22:50] beginning of the reformation the bible
[22:51] was the only book in the home
[22:53] and mothers would read it to their
[22:54] children and these questions would come
[22:57] up
[22:59] what do i make of this how do i how do i
[23:01] apply this
[23:04] and these mothers would be wanting to do
[23:06] what was best for the home
[23:09] and so by their example
[23:13] they would live it and they would
[23:15] inspire somebody else who would see
[23:16] their life
[23:17] and it would have an effect on them and
[23:18] they would they would watch each other's
[23:21] testimony and
[23:22] and take notes of what what was leading
[23:24] to holiness and what wasn't
[23:27] and the more spiritual people were the
[23:29] clearer it became to them what was right
[23:30] what
[23:31] was wrong that's why it took so long for
[23:33] slavery to become an issue was because
[23:34] people had to be had to have their
[23:36] awareness brought to the
[23:38] see things as they were
[23:42] if the man is the head the woman is the
[23:43] backbone
[23:47] women played an essential role in
[23:51] helping
[23:51] and helping both their husbands and
[23:52] their sons to become men
[23:55] and boy we could use a lot more of that
[23:56] today
[24:00] now everybody needs to know this the
[24:02] reason women wanted to vote in the first
[24:04] place
[24:05] was to abolish slavery to outlaw liquor
[24:09] to make the home better talk about
[24:12] buyer's remorse
[24:18] that is not what they're doing today
[24:21] amen things were not perfect during the
[24:23] victorian age
[24:24] and i'm not saying that they were there
[24:27] were a lot of inconsistencies that
[24:28] needed to be worked out
[24:31] but at least they were thinking about
[24:33] how to make the next generation better
[24:35] [Music]
[24:37] and that is all gone by the wayside
[24:40] so as a nation we started abandoning all
[24:42] moral progress
[24:44] that the victorian age represented and
[24:46] instead we became self-absorbed
[24:48] as though god would bless us simply
[24:50] because we were american
[24:53] as a warning all these things we just
[24:56] discussed were confirmed
[24:58] to us once again through a holy ghost
[24:59] ministry
[25:01] the same holy ghost is still alive today
[25:03] and with us
[25:04] and without in any way diminishing the
[25:06] offer the office that restored the
[25:09] fivefold ministry
[25:10] of ephesians 4 11-13
[25:14] which talks about apostles prophets
[25:15] evangelists pastors teachers
[25:17] until we all come in the unity of the
[25:19] faith not just the ministry
[25:21] every single one of us
[25:26] i'm going to say this from personal
[25:27] experience
[25:30] i'm holding two pieces of of the puzzle
[25:32] that
[25:38] that fit together perfectly these two
[25:41] pieces fit together perfectly now there
[25:42] are 15 ways that they don't
[25:48] my wife and i came from very different
[25:52] backgrounds
[25:53] and there were a lot of things that we
[25:55] had to work out
[25:57] for our relationship to proceed
[26:01] we couldn't even we couldn't even think
[26:03] about getting married we had we had to
[26:04] get these things worked out
[26:06] it took years of
[26:09] and it took years it took a lot of work
[26:12] but we finally broke through
[26:16] with heavy tears we came to
[26:20] understand one another's viewpoint
[26:23] and once that happened something
[26:26] supernatural took place
[26:28] circumstances began working themselves
[26:32] out
[26:33] before i could even do anything about
[26:34] them wow
[26:36] i mean it was just it was a domino
[26:39] effect
[26:40] and i was a spectator
[26:44] and to me that's a taste of what could
[26:47] happen
[26:48] if we as a body of believers could
[26:50] humble ourselves
[26:52] and reason together
[26:55] if something bothers one of us that
[26:56] doesn't bother the other then maybe one
[26:59] of us is overly sensitive or the other
[27:00] or the other one is too undersensitive
[27:05] or both but if we are in christ
[27:09] we should be able to get on the same
[27:11] page
[27:16] we should have enough respect not just
[27:17] to blow the other person off
[27:20] if that person is a sincere believer
[27:26] and what is probably more important is
[27:28] not that we would agree on everything
[27:30] but that we would be willing
[27:31] that the holy ghost could speak to us
[27:34] through one another
[27:36] which brings us to verse four year of
[27:40] year of god little children and have
[27:41] overcome them
[27:43] because greater is he that is in you
[27:44] than he that is in the world
[27:49] let us stand then as we bow our heads
[27:51] one more time
[27:58] our heavenly father there is a body of
[28:01] christ
[28:02] and i am thankful to be
[28:06] counted part of a group of believers
[28:09] that
[28:11] are desiring to be completely
[28:13] surrendered to you
[28:16] and lord even as i speak this i know
[28:18] there's a
[28:19] invisible audience that is uh
[28:24] probably larger than the audience that i
[28:26] see here made of
[28:27] people with maybe entirely different
[28:31] viewpoints
[28:32] and i pray that even those will be
[28:33] struck by some of the things that were
[28:34] said here
[28:35] that that everything here is scriptural
[28:39] everything here is
[28:41] is a is a challenge to everyone who
[28:43] would call himself a christian
[28:45] because we this is not
[28:49] some sort of mental idea it's not a
[28:52] it's not a list of rules it's not a set
[28:54] of doctrines it is a relationship
[28:56] between
[28:58] you and your people and lord we just are
[29:01] amazed how identified you are with your
[29:03] elect
[29:03] yes if you were if you were our father
[29:07] and that was all that it was that would
[29:08] be
[29:08] that would be wonderful enough to be you
[29:12] to be our father
[29:13] and we to be your children and yet you
[29:15] also came to be our brother
[29:18] and so we are your brothers and sisters
[29:20] we are your friends
[29:23] those are those are those are great
[29:26] relationships there
[29:28] but even more so we have a bright
[29:30] bridegroom relationship with you
[29:34] and beyond that you have made new
[29:37] jerusalem
[29:38] you have you you declared as jesus
[29:41] christ as
[29:42] as the man you said who are my who are
[29:45] my mother and my brethren
[29:47] and you identified your elect with both
[29:49] of those making
[29:51] new jerusalem the mother of us all also
[29:53] the mother of that word that's being
[29:55] restored
[29:56] so four of the greatest i mean the four
[29:59] greatest relationships we could ever
[30:00] have with another human being are
[30:01] represented in our
[30:02] you're our father you're our brother
[30:04] you're our husband you are our son
[30:07] and if that weren't enough you have made
[30:09] us your body
[30:11] so lord help us to recognize one another
[30:13] to respect you to respect one another
[30:15] and to see the holy ghost have liberty
[30:18] to move
[30:19] like we've never seen it granted we ask
[30:23] amen in jesus christ's name amen
