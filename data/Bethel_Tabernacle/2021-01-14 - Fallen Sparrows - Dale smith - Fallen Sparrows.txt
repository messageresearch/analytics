matthew chapter 10 and we want to bring you greetings from all the believers there in flagstaff this evening and they're waiting on the coming of the lord and they're expecting his imminent appearing at any any moment amen and so we just had some of them come by to visit you the other day but it was a there was a outbreak or something and so they canceled the service and so they they really wanted to come to church but they got to stay and visit for a little while with deborah and travis so amen uh you can cut me back on these monitors i don't need that much by the way um matthew chapter 10 and we want to read a couple of verses here you can thank your pastor for this message uh he he was talking the other day and he he made a statement uh quoted brother ln stanley and it so inspired me i just uh i just had to preach on i said i can't wait to get to beaufort so i can preach this so we just want to preach a little bit this evening starting at verse 29 matthew chapter 10 and verse 29. are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered and fear ye not therefore ye are more of more value than many sparrows and may the lord bless the reading of the word this evening as you have your seats amen i want to get a good look at you god bless you brother you kind of come down here warm up a bit did you okay yeah i know it is yeah and uh so just wanna see sister debbie amen all of you i would just um get to missing you all pretty bad but i don't want to talk about it or else i won't be able to see my book and so sister gene i i'll leave her for a while all right amen but we just trust the lord too that whatever we do it won't be for very long and i i trust it will that the ransomed host of god be gathered amen with our people and trying to hold it together it's not doing very well but we just just truly truly appreciate you all and your your your prayers for us and the lord has been very very good to us uh there in flagstaff and uh has given us souls for our labor and the first year we've baptized i think four or five uh 4 4 we baptized and we've had a couple of graduations where we send a few off to be with the lord and and that was very painful for us and but as a first year of a pastor i've i've baptized them i've married them i'm buried them so you know we're just doing everything we're supposed to do dedicated them and we've had a few born and a few that went on to be with the lord and so we we've uh just trusting the lord to give us many souls for our labor good to see brother jason and he come out and ministered for us and and people really appreciated him to come out and and hold some services for us and so my wife says don't say that but y'all come see us you know and and she says every time you say that they end up showing up right when we get there so maybe we'll be there for a little while and get the yard mowed before you get there but uh if not why you just have to help us mow grass by the way and uh but we appreciate you and love you dearly and want you to know that we you're you're not you're not forgotten we love you with all of our hearts and think about you pray for you on a regular basis amen it's mutual woes friend we have when things happen the body here when they go through their struggles and things you know brother you know different ones empty seats that won't be filled on this time again and uh that's always hard you know you you know you leave and and someone goes on to be with the lord and you come back and then now they're they're not with us anymore and that's that's hard to to you know to uh to realize sometimes but you know uh you know my seat will be empty if the lord tarries someday you know your seat will be empty but on this side and there'll be others that'll trust that'll carry the gospel out to the next generation but i have to believe with all of my heart that there won't we're not we're not those that are saying you know what the lord he delays us coming and so forth i say even so lord jesus yes come quickly amen i i i really believe with all of my heart that we are those in whom the ends of the earth have come upon and and it doesn't take much research to see that amen you can just look around and sharing with brother jason uh just the other day that you know i've always been kind of a politically savvy you know always try to stay abreast of what's going on in in major politics you know none of this nonsense but the major movements and what's you know what what to expect you know and things like that watching you know real estate in the stock market and all these kind of things you know just keep abreast of those things well you know the other day it just got it became nauseating to me i just said you know not interested in that anymore uh doesn't matter if the stock market crashes it doesn't matter if real estate goes you know to zero or negative interest you know it is absolutely have no meaning to me whatsoever uh i have uh i've signed out amen i've uh i'm looking for uh as brother david gadman said i'm not looking for a hole in the ground i'm looking for for a hole in the sky amen not looking for an airplane ride i'm looking for a plein air ride amen amen just uh just gonna take a little trip on the old gospel ship and wave this world goodbye amen this evening i would like to just maybe just encourage you a little in the lord as we read our text here this was the um inspiration for a little story i i'm sure brother jason has told it here but i i want to just reiterate it because i want to take a whole thought on it but brother stanley had made a statement and i we we haven't definitively decided whether it was actually him that did this or if it was someone that he knew that did this but he told the story originally but that and we'll just i believe it was him that they were driving along and uh the the uh a sparrow hit the car and the brother backed up and went back to where the the sparrow was they asked him well what are you doing he said i'm going back to where that sparrow is and they got out and stood by the by the little bird and and they said well what are you doing that for he said because i know that the bible says that not one of these little fellows can fall to the ground but what out the father knows it he said i want to be standing somewhere god is looking and that's so so became so relevant to me because the bible is uh tells us that this that this little fellow here that this little bird that is that though it could be one place that says that you could well here it says that uh two could be uh sold for a farthing is about a penny and uh i think another one where it says that uh uh five can be sold for two pennies and so you get a bargain if you buy more you know but but even then it's it's at such a insignificant amount of money to buy these little insignificant birds now the the sparrow was uh also was classified based i could see in the old testament were class they didn't have no gaul and so they were like a dove they they were a clean bird they were actually edible and uh that you they could actually be uh the offering for leprosy uh for the poor or or well a leper uh would not have anything to offer anyways and so just for a few cents uh uh in our thinking uh that you could get these birds and uh two birds and one they would uh take its head and ring its head and sprinkle the blood of the one on the other and you know the story about the speckled bird and and this actually could be applied to the sparrow in some translations it actually uses the sparrow as the bird and and some it just leaves it generically and then another translation it says turtle doves so it could be uh either or and so uh this this little bird here that the bible tells us that you are worth more than many of these birds and so when we begin to think of what the prophet of god tells us of what the the value of of a human soul is worth to god then we begin to realize that he says that it's worth ten thousand worlds and so uh your value is very great in the eyes of god and so much that uh the that we realize that god shed his own blood amen the bible says you are not your own but that you've been bought with a price amen the precious blood of the lord jesus christ brother brown tells us that that god thought more of you than he did of his own blood and that you are the purchase of his blood amen and so uh so the where we could spend a lot of time on the value of a soul but i just want to focus more on the uh the attention and i'm going to use that word attention what gets god's attention we're preaching tonight on fallen sparrows and so the bible here in matthew's gospel chapter 18 and verse 10 it says take heed that you despise not one of these little ones amen do i got any little ones in the house tonight amen amen i believe we're all one of god's little ones and he says uh be uh take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven that their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven he goes on to say here and he says and again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven the thought and the narrative of the scripture continues to go down and he said for where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them so now then we have this little sparrow that falls from heaven uh for whatever reason and and uh you know in our day you know maybe an automobile or in that day maybe it was an old stray cat or or or something like that that that little bird is going to uh for whatever reason uh a hailstone or i've seen where birds get uh you know fly into uh you know a bad storm and they get uh they get they get uh they get killed you know because of the bad weather or whatever it might be and so that one of these little birds if it would fall to the ground that the eye of god would that he is so omnipotent he's so omniscient that he would look down into the midst of all the chaos and the things that are going on in the world and the wars and the earthquakes the typhoons and and and people's lives and and and and and all the uh the human trafficking and all the heinous crimes that are being committed in the earth but yet god is able to look down through all the myths of all of that and see a little insignificant bird when it would fall to the ground and i began to think about that if god would would do that and that would get god's attention amen a little bird that would fall to the ground and that would get god's attention to the point that he would focus on that little bird amen and it would so inspire a man that he would he would think i want to be in the presence of god so much i want to i want to be in the focus of god that i would want to horn in on the death of a little bird and i would want to i would want to get myself close to where i know scripturally where god's looking at i would want to get right there and stand by that because i want to be in the attention of god i want to catch god's attention some way somehow i want god to look down and see me and to know that i'm thinking about him and that i'm looking for his attention and for his approval and for his love and for his understanding in my life i want god to look down and see i want to be near one of those fallen sparrows and he said where two or three of these little ones are gathered in my name there i will be in the midst of them friend i got to thinking about that and i said you know how many times have we looked out over a congregation where you know we got half the church not here this evening when the whole church ought to be here they really ought to be here because the bible says where two or three are gathered in his name he said to forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and so when i think about that and the bible says tells us that they're they're they're they're where these two are gathered or three are gathered jesus is going to be there now you know that may be an excuse for a small congregation or just a small gathering but to me it's it's an invitation amen into the presence of god it's an invitation to get his attention because i want to be this i don't know about you but i just want to be spoilt i want to be one of those little spoiled children in the house of god that's always got daddy's attention willing to do anything anytime i want the attention of god i want him looking at me all the time thinking about me all the time that whatever hey you know that deal boy he's something else you know where two or three earth that he's always there [Music] you know where a sparrow's fallen he's always there where they're sick and someone's hurting he's always there oh my whether there's a where there's pain or suffering uh i hope i'm not the cause of it but but they're always nearby because i want to be in the in i want to be where god's doing something when god's doing something i want to be nearby when there's a gathering brother brown tells us that if the holy ghost is in your soul he said you just can't wait for the church doors to open i believe that we should gather even the much more as we see that day approaching the much more if there's ever any place you know they can have their rally out here they can sit on the courthouse steps they can walk up and down the street with their picket signs they can go to washington dc they can break in the capitol building they can do whatever they want to but at the end of the day friends i want to be where jesus is i want to be gathered right in the middle of where the attention of god is focused well he said he would be in the midst of them where two or three are gathered in his name i want to be somewhere close by the bible says in psalms chapter 33 and verse 18 he said behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him now then that word their fear is not like afraid like scared or petrified or terrified or or something like that but it literally means that it it means respect is the bait is the basic word for that that word is upon them that respect him that reverence him that are humbled in his presence i want to be near somebody like that why because the eye of the lord is upon those that are respectful to god you've got so many today that are disrespectful you've got so many comedians that are supposed to be you know christian comedians i i i guess you know some of the things that they say are funny and funny things happen in church but let me tell you a lot of the things they say are sacrilege a lot of the things that they say just are are are not worth repeating or are not edifying but what but and many times we find that there's uh you know there's just uh uh people that will say derogatory things about church and church people and god and and the holy spirit and and the bible and these kind of things i don't want to be around people like that i don't want to be gathered in that kind of an atmosphere i want to be gathered around those amen that are reverent before god that are humbled in his presence that'll that'll reverence himself and say amen to the word of god watch what it says here his eye is upon them that fear him and watch right here comment there upon them that hope in his mercy [Music] my as i begin to look at that the english word hope there is really uh it's not it's not really it's not adequate because not so much because the bible's wrong but because men's mind's wrong because they're hoping hope is brother said it said hopes on the outside looking in he said but faith on the inside looking out you see faith's already possessor and so this word the the english word hope there but i i thought it was striking when i went back and looked into the he and the hebrew uh uh definition there the word there is actually weight those that wait upon the lord and actually means to patiently wait and so the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him and upon them that patiently wait and that word mercy there it literally means loving kindness so those that patiently wait in you notice the language there in his mercy and so they're patiently they're in that loving kindness they're they're patiently waiting in it so they're now they're already possessers and so to get when you're in that loving kindness his eyes are on you yeah because the bible says his eye beholds them that fear him and upon them that are are in their their that are patiently waiting within that loving kindness that word their mercy specifically means in redemption from enemies and troubles his loving-kindness is his redemption from enemies and troubles his eye is upon them that are that when they're surrounded by on every side when the when the enemy is coming in like a flood when plagues and pestilence when when political upheaval when there's wars and and and violence and everything all around us oh let me tell you his eyes upon them that are patiently waiting in his loving kindness that are waiting patiently within the realms of redemption that they have found their kinsmen redeemer they have found amen their bow has and they're resting patiently amen for him to do his work he said wait here amen and she and naomi said wait here because he will not rest until he has performed amen what he said he would do and i'm patiently waiting amen for god to do what he patiently amen what he said that he would do i'm waiting patiently lord why when i do his eyes are upon me oh i thank god amen that i'm waiting patiently because i know he will perform what he said he will do amen redemption from my enemies and from my troubles it goes on to say here that men should trust in it trust in his lovingkindness trust in his mercy amen oh my they have a uh they have a thing where you uh i i don't know where it's uh they do it in like business meetings and motivational type things and in in uh marriage seminars and things like this and they and they actually have a person to stand on a box or on a chair and they blindfold them and then now they they have to say now then you have to trust us you have to trust your husband you have to trust your wife you have to trust this person and or this group of people and you're going to blindfold it now you're just going to fall backwards and these people are going to catch you and you have to trust us and so they have to get over that that fear that that fear of falling that fear of injury that fear and they're going to fall into the these arms that are that are there and they're there and they're told that they would they would be there to catch them and and and so so they have to they have to break you know that that so they have to put their trust in that person that's going to catch them but there's the possibility that that person would not be there there because maybe at that moment it would be there but maybe the next time they wouldn't be or maybe that person because of human weakness or because of death or because of of uh you know backsliding or whatever the case might be that there's going to come a day that that person you would lose confidence in that person that they wouldn't be there even though it may be your dearest friend or your your most your soul mate in this world or whatever the case may be people are going to fail you amen and the bible says that it's not wise to put your confidence or your trust in the arm of the flesh even though we want to trust one another we want to have confidence that that person will be there or they'll pray for it when they say they will or whatever those things might be but the but the scripture here it tells us that his eyes upon them that that uh patiently wait for his loving kindness and and and that men should trust in it trust in the lord put your confidence there he won't fail you he's never failed me yet he won't fail you he can't fail you why because his eye the one that's on the sparrow he's on the he's on the needs of his children he's on the needs of his of these ones that you're much more valuable than many sparrows men should rejoice in it rejoice in the lord always in first peter chapter 3 and verse 12 the bible says for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous amen all right think about that that what gets god's attention is the eyes of the lord and his ear is open unto their prayer but did you notice here in this scripture that these other the other side of the coin is not invisible to god we wonder about you know these other things the what the you know the the the the ungodly the bible says if the righteous scarcely be saved where will the sinner and the ungodly appear they appear right here in the face of god god sees these you think that god doesn't know that they they they rigged an election it's not the first time [Music] they did it before in the days when brother branham voted for richard nixon he said they rigged it he said they knew that they voted for kennedy four times to the one of richard nixon he said the fbi investigated and proved it he said but they didn't do anything about it so do you think this day is any different it's not any different this is not our world the kingdoms of this world shall sin before him fall amen i'm not looking for uh of some sort of vindication that that this uh administration was good bad or otherwise i'm not interested in that i'm interested in one thing let me be in the center of god's attention nothing else matters but you think that god didn't see these things before they happened what kind of god do we serve if they just caught god off guard you think the lord jesus didn't know before the foundation of the world that we were going to have a bunch of criminals a bunch of whoremongers a bunch of liars and deceivers in the politics of this government don't you think that god already knew before there was ever amen specus stardust that he knew but he also knew that he was going to have a righteous seed upon the earth and his eye was going to be on him hallelujah and he said i'll get you through this persecutions will come tribulation will come amen amen i'll be with you even in you glory to god watch this but the face of the lord is against them that do evil they're not getting away with anything those those people that they they rigged the election that did those that cast all those illegal votes and that that counted all those uh that that perversion and all that stuff that went on there they ain't getting away with anything oh but they're gonna put a bad man in the office they had a bad man in the office to start with there's no difference it's pot calling kiddo black on this deal you know one's gonna you know i just i just don't believe in this news and politics is a bunch of nonsense get your eyes on the thing that matters the reveal word of the hour that's where god's attention is wow he said i will see my word brother jason and i will bring it to pass i will perform it amen hallelujah i want to inject something here peter was actually quoting from the old testament if you want to go and read that it's in psalms 34. and uh he he quotes it verbatim but then verse 16 says this i'll i'll finish up there he said but the face of the lord is against them that do evil watch what he says in verse 16. the face of the lord is against them that do evil to what amen amen we're uh i'm at uh 3416. uh to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth i might give you a wrong chapter and verse probably maybe i don't know 32. psalms 34 16. i i might i sometimes i yes there we go look what it says here the face of the lord is against them that do evil what have we been saying what to cut off the what the remembrance of them from the earth i'm here to tell you church that his eye is on the righteous his eye is on amen those that call upon his name his eyes upon those that gather in his name his eye is on them and they shall establish amen blessed are they merciful amen for they shall obtain mercy oh let me tell you friends there's going to be a people that will inherit the earth but those that do wickedly the bible says that at one point there they won't even be remembered on the earth amen so it just depends on what kind of attention you want to get from god where do you want to be standing i got to thinking about that you know the bible says that if you're if you're sick call for the elders of the church now that is one of the great benefits of being a preacher that's right think about it that every time we get a little wounded sparrow that the preacher gets to stand next to him amen every time there's a sick person brother jason i can stand by every time there's a hurting person that needs prayer every time there's a mother that's praying for his children i get to stand next to him they asked for the preacher to come and to lay hands on i get to sit next to him i get to stand next to him i get to pray for him amen god's eye is on that person and somehow or another there we go so then now then we realize that uh you know when somebody asks you to pray for them how important that is for that person to get prayed for but let me tell you friends there's a benefit to that that you get to get next to that little fallen sparrow it's your opportunity to be next to that one that's afflicted oh my you get you you know uh uh you get you get a a mother that's uh that's agonizing for lost children oh my get next to that sister god's looking down there you'll get that brother that's that's that's been afflicted with a with this coveted or something like it's an opportunity that we have to get next to them and to pray for them and to agonize with them and feel their pain with them why because god knows and god's looking down when somebody's hurting god knows when you're suffering his eye is on the sparrow how much more is he on you or me i wonder sometimes if we don't miss an opportunity we miss an opportunity to be in the center of god's attention brother brown tells a little story and god keeps his word in 1957 he says he was up in the arm of the of the uh of the statue of liberty and that's back when you could go up in the arm and look in the viewing uh there at the where the light is and as they were brother bam was looking there he looked out on there's like a gangplank around the outside of that and there was a bunch of little birds that were laying there dead and brother brown asked if they got killed during the storm and the the guide there says no he said there was a storm there last night and in the storm these little birds flew into the light and instead of using the light to go to safety they tried to beat the light out with their little wings and they beat their brains out brother brown goes on he says now don't try to beat your brains out to make god's word say something that it doesn't don't try to cope with societies of this day can we say amen to that we're not here to cope with societies and and political parties and and movements of this earth you know and and whatever uh you know uh someone align themselves with the you know the nra and boy if you're not a nra member while you're you know you're you're not even american another one over here is want to be with the blm and this and all the lbg rst or whatever they are and all these different things and you've got to align yourself somehow with one of these alphabets nice brother man said it's he said don't try to cope with these societies of this day because if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god isn't in you he said why not just take the gospel light and use it to fly to safety instead they're trying to beat their brains out trying to stop the light to close down the church to you know to to keep us all at home in quarantine or whatever the case might be and social distance that and whatever more and you know no doubt there's certain health benefits to some of those things i don't argue with that kind of stuff but what i do say is we ought to take the word of god and use it to fly to safety all right amen instead of trying to beat the thing out we'll beat our brains out and the light will still be shining amen god knows so little sparrows tonight use the light to fly to safety the bible says amen the bible the bible is is is full of precious promises and he said it's a light to your feet it's a lamp to your feet it's a light to your path what is it use it to fly to safety brother man says this i just love this quote he says now maybe the devil has caught you out somewhere and give you a disease or some sickness or you're backslid or something like that remember he climbed the ramparts of glory and sitting on high his eye is on the spiral and i know he watches me he goes on here he is from everlasting brother matthew to everlasting [Music] he steps up and he watches you he sees where you're at come on you backslid computer there you go thing trying to get on get a mind of its own i love this this is this is exactly the way that he reads this and i or that he quotes this or says this i'm quoting the way he said it he steps up and he's watching you he sees where you're at amen well i can see where you're at but jason's sitting over here in the corner these folks sitting right here on the second row these folks are sitting on the second row and they got i know where these ones are and you're and that's geographically where you're at right that doesn't mean that i'm omnipotent or omnipresent but this one that sets on high whose eye is on the sparrow and he is from everlasting to everlasting his alpha and omega is the beginning of the end he's everything in between as brother matthew said on sunday he's all those kind of things but what is so amazing to me he knows exactly where you're at amen and he's not talking about your geographics he's not talking about your posture but he knows where you're at he knows what you're thinking right now he knows where you want to be right now he knows where you're going to be tomorrow he knows everything about everything about you he knows where you're at spiritually emotionally physically amen medically he knows everything that there is to know the inside the outside he's the word of god and he's sharper than any two-edged sword he's cutting asunder to the bone the moral he's getting rid of all the filth and all the fluff and he's getting down right down and the bible says he discerns the thoughts and the intents of your heart let me tell you god knows where you're at tonight he knows where you're at he knows where he knows what you're what you're thinking he knows what your attitude is towards the word of god come on now amen you think i'm not i'm not reading the quote he says he knows we're having this meeting tonight this didn't catch god off guard it didn't god knew we were going to be here before there was ever a a stardust or anything else he knew we were going to have this meeting he knew who was going to be here so we have a full church tonight amen we have a full house and whoever is not sitting in those seats i'm telling you there's angels sitting there because your angels behold the father they're with you always they're round about them that fear him and we we have a full house and if we had every seat filled with a human body then the angels would take amen the mezzanine amen hallelujah amen watch this he knows this is these are the things that god knows he knows where you're at he knows we were having this meeting tonight he knows how concerned each one of us are about it he's very he knows how concerned you are he knows that you know that he knows that he knows [Music] and he knows if you're concerned or not because remember he said convinced and concerned amen are you convinced and if you get convinced that this word is the truth and that it is eagle food and when you're convinced of it you'll leave that other thing behind you'll leave all your your sports and you'll leave all your worldly nonsense and you'll leave everything in your politics and all these uh you'll leave that all behind why because you're convinced and when you're convinced you'll be concerned amen he knows your interest and i could put a plural in that your interests but that's not what he said he knows your interest in him yes amen a singular interest in him he knows if you're interested in him he knows remember brother batman there in the shalom message he begins to talk about this great symphony and the sympathy and he begins to interact with those words and he and he begins to talk about how that uh uh you know what the sheep music is and and and and how that what the sheet music means and if you're if you he said but if you're not interested in that he said then all it is is a bunch of racket to you but he said if you're interested and you know what the sheep music is and you're in tune you're in harmony with the composer and the director is directing he said then you you can close your eyes and live in the music you can live in the symphony why because you know what the story is and you're interested in what it means and what it says and i'm here to tell you friends he knows tonight if you're interested in the things of god or if you're just here to pass some time or just to hold a good standing in the neighborhood or to keep the deacon from calling you or the pastor from you know giving you an email or a text i'm here to tell you friends that god is interested in you and he knows whether you're interested in him or not he knows your interest in the kingdom hello amen he knows if you're interested in the kingdom of god well everybody well i want to go to heaven but you know all this missionary stuff i don't know i don't know if i want to invest in that or not i got other things i could be doing with my money we're talking about the kingdom right you say well well the kingdom having a bigger church or a bigger building or expanding or a building or whatever and and having a bigger organization and having a church bus and all this other no friends i'm not talking about that i'm talking about the kingdom of god and that that kingdom will be inhabited with people and those people will get there because they heard the gospel and they heard the gospel because somebody was sent and there was people that couldn't go so they sent somebody yeah right and then and that's the kingdom of god amen it comes many times without observation but the bible amen shows us that that we must be witnesses in our jerusalem in our samaria and into the uttermost parts of the earth and this church i know for years and years has been a missionary missionary-minded church they've supported missions and things around the world and many souls will be attributed to the direct amen work and the responsibility that this church took to send missionaries into the foreign fields and that's never been a a criticism but only appraised to this church but individually we must have the bible brother adam tells us that every soul that is without christ is a mission field you're all called to be missionaries there's just not near enough people in this church and that you're responsible to get them brother man said you haven't got any right to call yourself a christian if you're not winning souls to christ and that don't mean you're going out here witnessing handing out flyers and all those kind of things but the life that you live in the face of this community is preaching a louder sermon that many times that we'll ever be able to do from this pulpit god is concerned about the smallest things is concerned i love this quote enough to make god is concerned enough to take pity on an ignorant possum how much more does he think about a son or daughter of god who is in need watch this brother brown says this this really blessed me today felt to share it that's what he said i am told that a snake can catch the eye of a bird and charm that bird with its enchantments and the stare of its eyes until in such a way that if that bird will give the snake its attention for just a few minutes that bird will flutter and completely become paralyzed and the snake will take that bird he says and i can believe that why because brother baby's first bible was nature is that right he said i can believe that because that i know another serpent the devil that if he can ever catch the eye with his enchantments with your modern rock and roll and all your fandangles now we could put a definition on fandangle but i'll let you use your imagination the the fandangles of the world what is that it's it's whatever enticement that the devil can use to get your attention just for a moment amen we have to protect our children from the fandangles of the world because they're helpless little birds and they don't know many times they don't even have the holy ghost and so when when those fandangles and all these uh you know video games and all this uh you know hollywood and all these kind of things they it catches their little eye brother baby says that just one time that a child can hear the beat of that rock and roll music and they'll catch them and put a spirit on amen that's why we have to be careful amen what we listen to he said if he can catch your eye why do you think that the devil he couldn't just have simple old-fashioned sassafras two-by-four you know kind of preaching spitting and slobbering and beating on the pulpit and calling sinners to repentance that's what god does the the the the word can only produce an acts 2 38 a shouting crying tongue-talking bunch of miserable creatures that's what the world that's the only thing the word can produce amen 1965 by the way uh uh but but what does the devil do the devil takes him down and and put some crazy looking haircut on some wild child preacher up there puts him in a t-shirt and a pair of flip-flops and puts him out there with no pulpit carrying a little bitty bible around and got all kinds of smoke and lights and all kind of a rock and roll band behind him and backing him up and what is it it's catching the eye of the people it's a bunch of entertainment it's not preaching the gospel pulling the gloves off and bare fists preaching the word of god and telling sinners to repent but they don't want that kind of preaching no more they don't want that kind of singing old-fashioned down-home type uh congregationals oh no no no that's way too what brother brown says too far out of the realms of their modern worldly society but you look what's pulling in the big crowds the big names and the big numbers it's fandangles that catches the eye of the people watch what brother brown says if he can ever catch you young lady or young man long enough to get his charm in you you'll flutter but you can't get loose he'll hold you until he swallows you up in sin the quote goes on the only way i'm told that a little bird ever has a chance are you listening little birds is to get his eyes off of the serpent and he cannot look at anything else because he stands there staring but if he'll take his eyes from the serpent and look upward and flutter his wings he'll fly plum out of the reach of the snake and if you ever got the charm of the world of the things of the world and unbelief charming around your heart and tells you oh live modern shake your head tonight and look up to the unseen one the lord jesus and flutter your wings of prayer and until you fly plum out of his reach and out of his clutches all by the world is all around us just look up children your your redemption draweth now and begin to flutter your little wings amen of prayer and begin to fly out of his presence sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i am come and i will dwell in the midst of these saith the lord zechariah 2 10. brother talks about his eye being on the sparrow and his eye on the hebrew children listen to what brother says he said i can hear him say i can't let you go you he's talking about those those angels and michael came and wormwood came and they and they and they come or gabriel and they wanted to come and go down and set the children of israel free or the the hebrew children shadrach meshach and abednego he said but i can't let you go brother baby says i can see him rise oh let me tell you i don't know if he can literally see him rise or if he was just in his mind's eye but i'm i'm seeing what he was seeing tonight he said i can see him rise i can see him drop those he i can see him rise from his throne his garments drop around him gets out there way back over there in the north country i can see a big thunderhead we around here we know what the big thunderheads look like oh big old cumulus nimbus cloud up there oh my i could hear him say come here oh my i can hear him say east wind and west wind and north and south come here everything minds him that's right i can hear him say go over there and get under that thunderhead a couple of big old cat5 tornadoes up underneath a big cat5 hurricane what a monster oh but my jesus steps off on top of it he said i'm going to drive you like horses this morning i'm going down to babylon i can see him reach up and get a hold of a big zigzag lightning with his hands and pass the tree of life and pick off a branch as they make their last step trusting god's word about the time they stepped in there was one like the son of man standing there by their side with a palm fanning away even the hot breezes down from there nebuchadnezzar said how many did we put in there he said three said there's four and one looks like the son of god watch he said and he's the same yesterday today and forever his powers cannot fail he cannot god is in his son yes you believe that god is in his people god is here tonight the bible says in psalms 102 and verse 16 he says and when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory listen to what he says he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer he said wow david really had something going on there he really knew what was going on he really knew that god would hear the prayer of the righteous god would always hear you know the children of israel and god heard moses and god heard david well let's keep reading this shall be written for the what the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord brother branham comes over and he picks up the laodicean church age and they only see in church ages chapter 3 and verse 14 of revelation he said he says and these sayings saith the amen these things saith the beginning of the creation of god what was it there was going to be a people that were going to come on the earth at the last days there were going to be a special creation they were going to be a created people for the last day they were going to be created under good works they would be going to be created under the new birth they were going to be they were going to be the ones that god himself was going to give the final uh image the final picture was going to be this people david spoke about him but there was going to be a generation that was to come which would be a people that created shall praise the lord and first peter chapter 2 and verse 9 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth his praises unto him who has called you out of darkness into this marvelous life watch what it says here which in time past were not a people but are now a people of god which was which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained what the lovingkindness have obtained that that that particular attention of god at the end time brother brahma goes on here he says the holy ghost and the god is the same see it comes down and claims a body for the resurrection he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost i'll raise him up in the last day not one hair of their head shall perish that is the beginning of the creation of god and this is the continuation of the creation of god amen he goes on here in proving his word he makes a statement he said he proved the word by saying that he was jehovah made manifest he was the beginning of the creation of god god in creation watch god with a little part of creation here that god was living in himself he was the beginning of that creation and from him begat many sons oh let me tell you friends amen god said he was going to hear the cry of the righteous he was going to have his eye upon those that would call upon his name and he was going to create a special designated people at the end time that were specially equipped to get the center of his attention the rest of the world would be atomic fodder for an atomic age but he said my eye is on the spiral [Applause] and i'm watching over you oh my we could spend a lot of time in the church age book here but i want to get down to this last quote he said now we find there's trouble what's the matter something has took place the ship is rocking the wind is blowing can you say that tonight the ship is rocking and the wind is blowing i believe it's a message called god is uh oh i forget the name of

just like we are today but you know what he hadn't really left them as our musicians come he hadn't really left them and that's what he did when he left us at calvary when they crucified him he never left us he did he didn't climb the highest hill but he he climbed calvary and then he kept on climbing hallelujah past the moon in the stars and plum out into the heavens of heavens higher you go the further you can see and he got so high until he could look down on heaven the bible says he way up in heavens of heavens ascended on high his eyes on the sparrow and i know he's watching us tonight

presidential and parliamentary elections we're now trying to connect via vpn there's a lot of tension and certainly in the country because of the campaigns have been marred with much violence and death pray for us you'd think that only happened in uganda here we got it right in our own backyard let's pray for them because what you see here in a small measure they have in widespread amen it's just a very very very difficult place over there and you can imagine with no internet things like that my daughter and mariah has a real good friend named some of her sister in her 30s as it has heart failure her heart's operating at five percent so they sent an urgent request um to remember her her name is um i don't have it here her name is marisela marisela maddie that's right maddie sella heart
