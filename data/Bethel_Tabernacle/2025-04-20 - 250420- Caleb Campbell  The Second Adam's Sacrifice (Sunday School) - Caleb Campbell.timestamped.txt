[0:05] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[0:07] Good to be in the house of the Lord here
[0:09] this Easter Sunday morning.
[0:12] Um if you just want to all stand to our
[0:15] feet if you don't mind
[0:20] on this day a little over 2,000 years
[0:23] ago the tomb was emptied. Amen.
[0:26] and uh Jesus 40 40 days on earth prior
[0:29] to his ascension um back to heaven
[0:32] began. I've always been so fascinated by
[0:35] that span of time, that 40 days. I mean,
[0:37] you know, seeing Jesus as a man, as a
[0:40] young man, that would have been amazing.
[0:41] Seeing his earthly ministry, watching
[0:44] him through the miracles and the signs
[0:46] and the wonders and even listening to
[0:48] him preach firsthand. But to see Jesus
[0:51] come back in his glorified body and you
[0:53] know this was think about this is the
[0:55] god of god of the world. This is our
[0:57] this is our savior tabernacled himself
[1:00] in a body and then chose to appear to a
[1:02] certain group of people during that
[1:04] time. And I just think that's amazing.
[1:06] Um my lesson this morning has been
[1:08] dealing with my heart this last week and
[1:09] I I was praying the Lord would just
[1:11] inspire my my heart with something
[1:13] special kind of along the lines of
[1:14] Easter this morning. So um it's right
[1:18] along those lines. If you turn in your
[1:19] Bibles to Leviticus chapter 1,
[1:24] we have two readings. Leviticus chapter
[1:26] 1. We're going to catch the first few
[1:29] verses and then turn into 1 Corinthians
[1:31] 15. So it says, "And the Lord called
[1:34] unto Moses, and spake unto him out of
[1:36] the tabernacle of the congregation,
[1:38] saying, Speak unto the children of
[1:40] Israel, and say unto them, if any man of
[1:42] you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye
[1:44] shall bring your offering of cattle,
[1:46] even of the herd and of the flock. If
[1:49] his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the
[1:51] herd, let him offer a male without
[1:54] blemish. He shall offer it of his own
[1:56] voluntary will at the door of the
[1:58] tabernacle
[2:00] of the congregation before the Lord. And
[2:01] he shall put, and I want you to catch
[2:04] this specific verse, and he shall put
[2:06] his hand upon the head of the burnt
[2:09] offering. And it shall be accepted for
[2:11] him to make an atonement for him. And he
[2:15] shall kill the bullock before the Lord.
[2:17] and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall
[2:20] bring the blood and sprinkle the blood
[2:22] round about upon the altar that is by
[2:25] the door of the tabernacle of the
[2:28] congregation.
[2:30] Um, and we're going to actually just go
[2:32] ahead and go into 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:35] 15.
[2:37] 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[2:43] this morning.
[2:47] And we're going to catch the last five
[2:50] verses of that chapter. 1 Corinthians or
[2:53] I'm sorry, not the last five verses, but
[2:54] ch uh verses 45. Starting at 45, we're
[2:57] going to read down to 50. And it says,
[2:59] "And so it is written, the first man,
[3:01] Adam was made a living soul. The last
[3:04] Adam was a made a quickening spirit."
[3:06] Amen.
[3:07] How be it, that was not first which is
[3:10] spiritual, but that which is natural,
[3:12] and afterward that which is spiritual.
[3:14] The first man is of the earth, earthy.
[3:17] The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[3:20] As is the earthly, such are they also
[3:23] that are earthly. And as is the
[3:25] heavenly, such are they also that are
[3:27] heavenly. And as we have borne the image
[3:30] of the earthly, we shall also bear the
[3:32] image of the heavenly. Now this I say,
[3:35] brethren, in the flesh and blood cannot
[3:36] inherit the kingdom of God, neither do
[3:39] corruption inherit incorruption. Let's
[3:42] just bow our heads this morning.
[3:43] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[3:45] the reading of your word, Lord. We know
[3:47] that this is, Lord, a Sunday school
[3:49] lesson, Lord, but we still consider it,
[3:51] Lord, just a sacred time to come before
[3:53] your throne, Lord, and just hear from
[3:55] you, Lord. There's an opportunity,
[3:57] Father, for ears to hear your word. I
[4:00] just pray that you could open it up to
[4:01] us, Lord. Father, be with the entirety
[4:03] of the service. We love you. We commit
[4:05] ourselves to you, Lord. Thank you for
[4:07] what this day means, Lord. It's more
[4:09] than just a celebration in our hearts,
[4:11] Lord. It's everything to us. We ask it
[4:13] now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[4:15] this morning as you take your seats.
[4:19] So most of us understand that referring
[4:22] back to Leviticus there that the Old
[4:24] Testament law here that we read was how
[4:28] uh the believer in that time would atone
[4:31] for their sins. Sin from the very
[4:34] beginning of time was what separated man
[4:37] from God. You know God is holiness. The
[4:39] very essence of God is holy. And when
[4:42] the first separation took place there
[4:44] there in the garden, the original sin,
[4:46] what it did is it broke the connection
[4:48] that God had with us. So in the great
[4:52] redemption story, God always had a plan
[4:55] to restore us back to that unfettered
[4:58] fellowship so that we could once again
[5:00] dwell in his presence. And you know, as
[5:02] brother Brandon would say, walk in the
[5:04] cool of the evening and fellowship with
[5:05] the creator. That's that's what God
[5:08] that's always what he had envisioned for
[5:10] us. But see, blood was the only way that
[5:13] it could be truly restored. And we're
[5:16] not going to get into this part of it
[5:18] very much this morning, but it had to be
[5:20] innocent blood. Um, so for a time, as we
[5:24] read there in Leviticus, it was the
[5:26] innocent blood of an animal that God put
[5:28] in place. It was a sacrifice. And really
[5:31] was what it was. It was a substitution.
[5:33] It was a way for man to make amends with
[5:35] the evil that they had done.
[5:38] And you know, I believe that the Lord
[5:39] does things in a a certain way for a
[5:41] reason. So you see, when it came time
[5:44] for those priests to make these
[5:47] sacrifices, there was something very
[5:50] personal about this process. Verse four,
[5:54] and I told you guys to I I told the
[5:56] class this morning to to think about
[5:58] that scripture. Verse four says, "He
[6:00] shall put his hand on the upon the head
[6:03] of the burnt offering." I found this
[6:05] point to be so incredible because I
[6:08] believe so often times in the the
[6:11] worldview of modern Christianity this
[6:13] concept is misunderstood. On the surface
[6:16] you read in the Bible that they put
[6:19] their hand upon the offering meaning
[6:21] that they made contact with the
[6:24] sacrifice.
[6:25] But it it was something it became
[6:28] personal to them. But if you start to
[6:30] really study this verse out in Hebrew,
[6:33] the word there that they use is
[6:34] actually, and I don't know if I'm
[6:35] pronouncing this right, but it's sach,
[6:37] which means that they leaned heavily
[6:40] into because it was more than just
[6:43] making con contact with this innocent
[6:46] animal. Amen. It was when when the tr it
[6:49] was a transfer of what you did upon this
[6:54] innocent animal. Amen. And that's what
[6:56] that's what the sacrifice is to us. It's
[7:00] the the Lord is is is innocent, but he
[7:03] chose to become the sacrifice for you
[7:06] and for I. And I want you to notice this
[7:08] morning that when you put your hand up
[7:11] when they put their hand upon that
[7:12] sacrifice in literal speaking back in
[7:15] those days, it wasn't that they just set
[7:17] their hand upon it and it was, you know,
[7:19] like they were petting a an animal. It
[7:21] was something that it was a personal
[7:24] connection that you were to make with
[7:25] this animal to let you know that this
[7:29] thing was about to die for what you did.
[7:31] It was a transfer of your sin upon this
[7:35] animal. And I thought that that verse
[7:39] you leaned heavily into it. It was a
[7:41] recognition, amen, that it was that sin
[7:44] that was being transferred and it was
[7:46] literally going to take your place in
[7:48] death because you were the one that
[7:51] deserved to die. Amen. Who whoever
[7:54] committed the sin was the one who
[7:56] deserved to die. But God made a way so
[7:58] they wouldn't have to die by a transfer
[8:00] of that sin upon the innocent animal.
[8:03] But because there had to be because
[8:06] there was a personal connection that you
[8:08] were going to make with this animal.
[8:09] Amen. and it was literally going to take
[8:11] the place uh for you. And then this poor
[8:15] innocent creature was giving its life
[8:18] for yours. So, you know, it wasn't just
[8:20] about
[8:22] kind of bringing it back to our our time
[8:24] now because that's just spiritually
[8:26] speaking. It's not just about making
[8:28] contact with the creator. It's not just
[8:31] about a surface level religion where you
[8:33] have an idea, an understanding, a
[8:35] concept of what Jesus did for you. You
[8:38] need to lean heavily into the sacrifice
[8:41] that was made for you. Amen. You have to
[8:44] personally identify yourself that there
[8:46] was a lamb that was slain from before
[8:49] the foundation of the world. And all of
[8:51] the the scriptures that we read are
[8:53] types until we get to Jesus Christ.
[8:55] They're types of what Jesus was going to
[8:58] do. Amen. As a sacrificial lamb for us
[9:01] on our behalf. Amen. So it was it was
[9:04] more than making contact and touching.
[9:06] You would lean upon it with sincere
[9:08] conviction. You would weep and you would
[9:10] cry over this this animal. You'd be
[9:14] sorry. You'd be sorrowful for it because
[9:16] it was taking your place. And you know
[9:19] what I'm what I'm I'm I'm afraid that
[9:22] too many people do today is they've
[9:25] never fully identified themselves with
[9:28] the sacrifice.
[9:29] They've never fully leaned into the
[9:32] sacrifice. They've they've made contact
[9:35] with it. You know, you come to church
[9:36] and you make contact with it. You you
[9:39] see that there's a God. You see that
[9:41] he's going to take away the sins of the
[9:43] world, but have you ever fully
[9:45] identified yourself with that sacrifice
[9:47] and made it something personal? I
[9:49] believe we all have here this morning.
[9:51] But just as a refreshing, I want you to
[9:53] refresh yourself in that tonight that we
[9:55] are to fully identify with the sacrifice
[9:59] that Christ made for us because we were
[10:02] guilty. We were we were we were
[10:05] completely guilty. He was completely
[10:07] innocent. But the transfer took away the
[10:11] guilt. And one one thing I think I have
[10:13] actually this in my notes a little bit
[10:14] later, but one thing that's amazing is
[10:16] is even though that you're going to you
[10:18] were going to be the priest was going to
[10:20] look at this animal and maybe be sorry
[10:23] for what it was about to do, it knew
[10:25] that it would take away because that was
[10:28] what God had in store had in place. it.
[10:30] He knew that after after the the the
[10:33] atonement, after the blood was was shed
[10:35] and it was poured upon the altar that
[10:37] there would be an atonement. So even
[10:40] though it was a hard thing because
[10:41] sometimes, you know, repenting of your
[10:44] sins, you know, you you feel so so crept
[10:48] into it, but you know that there's going
[10:50] to be something take place, a release of
[10:53] that guilt. Amen. Because he takes away
[10:56] the sin. He takes away there's a
[10:58] transfer. Amen.
[11:00] and and uh these are some words of
[11:03] Spurgeon I think it was that he says
[11:05] believer do you remember that rapturous
[11:08] day when you first realize that pardon
[11:11] through Jesus Christ the sinbearer
[11:14] can you not make glad confession and
[11:17] join this is like poetry and join with
[11:19] the writer in saying that my soul
[11:22] recalls her day of deliverance with
[11:25] delight laden with guilt and full of
[11:28] fear years. I saw my savior as my
[11:32] substitute and I laid my hand upon him.
[11:36] Have you seen your savior as your
[11:38] substitute and laid your hand upon him?
[11:41] How timidly, he says, at first, but
[11:43] courage grew and confidence was
[11:46] confirmed until I leaned my soul
[11:50] entirely upon him. And now it is my
[11:53] unceasing joy to know that my sins are
[11:57] no longer imputed to me but laid on him
[12:01] and like the debts of the wounded
[12:03] traveler Jesus like the good Samaritan
[12:06] has said that all of my future
[12:08] sinfulness set that to my account
[12:12] blessed discovery he says eternal solace
[12:16] of a grateful heart that's what we are
[12:18] to do when we recognize that we need
[12:21] that sacrifice in our lives. Amen.
[12:24] I know we've all done this this morning.
[12:26] I just had this thought, you know, have
[12:28] we ever have we today have we fully
[12:31] leaned into Christ the way that those
[12:33] priests were instructed to lean into
[12:36] their sacrifice with true conviction?
[12:39] Amen. With all your heart because it's
[12:41] more than making contact with that
[12:43] understanding or with a concept. Amen.
[12:46] It's got to go, it's got to go further
[12:48] than that because one will never
[12:52] understand
[12:54] full and true freedom until they've
[12:56] recognized that they are living in sin,
[12:59] separated from God. Because the amazing
[13:02] thing about this process and I we just
[13:04] we touched on this is that even though
[13:06] you would feel guilty and low down and
[13:08] no good, you knew that once that
[13:10] transfer was made and the blood of that
[13:12] animal was on the altar, your sins were
[13:14] covered and that meant more to you than
[13:17] anything else. It meant more to you than
[13:20] the love that you might have had for
[13:21] that animal. You might have been a
[13:22] shepherd and this might have been your
[13:24] friend, but it meant more to you to be
[13:27] back into contact and fellowship with
[13:29] your creator. Amen. And now because
[13:31] Christ Jesus has become the lamb upon
[13:34] the altar for you, it was more than a
[13:36] covering. Amen. At that point it was a
[13:38] covering. But now it was a true
[13:41] atonement. When we come to Christ, you
[13:44] know, something significant takes place.
[13:46] It's more than just it's more than just
[13:48] a surface level contact. Amen. It's it's
[13:51] we come to Christ with our burdens
[13:53] because whether whether you're a
[13:55] Christian or not, you've got burdens.
[13:57] Amen. But but the Christian has
[13:59] somewhere to place those burdens. Let me
[14:02] just express that to you today. You're
[14:04] going to have burdens in this life.
[14:05] You're going to have trials whether
[14:07] you're a Christian or not. But if you're
[14:09] a Christian and you have made contact
[14:12] with the Savior, you have someplace to
[14:14] put those things. Amen. And he has he
[14:16] has an atonement. And he doesn't just
[14:18] have an atonement. He makes a a way for
[14:21] fellowship with you. Amen. He chose you
[14:24] as his habitation. Amen. Glory to God.
[14:28] And we're instructed to lean into those
[14:32] loving arms.
[14:34] Uh my heart was just on fire when I
[14:36] began to think of this. Um I was
[14:38] listening to the prophet. We're going to
[14:39] play a clip here in just a minute as my
[14:41] last few minutes from a sermon Brother
[14:43] Brandon preaches. Um but my heart was on
[14:46] fire for this. I was listening to him
[14:48] and he he just began to talk about the
[14:50] second Adam there in 1 Corinthians where
[14:52] we read. And Paul there in his letter to
[14:55] the Corinthians, he catches the
[14:57] revelation that Christ was the second
[14:59] Adam and not second in the way that our
[15:01] natural minds would perceive it. But
[15:04] Christ did what Adam longed to do. You
[15:07] know, you brother, he makes this clear.
[15:09] You know, Adam wasn't deceived by the
[15:11] serpent. Eve was deceived. But Adam had
[15:14] such a love for Eve that he didn't want
[15:17] to live without her. So, he sinned
[15:20] willfully, separating that fellowship.
[15:22] But when Jesus Christ came, he did what
[15:25] Adam could not do. You know, and this is
[15:28] just I like to think about this. This
[15:30] isn't there's no prophet doesn't say
[15:32] this that I know of, but I like to think
[15:34] that Adam longed to redeem Eve. I like
[15:37] to think that before he willfully did, I
[15:39] I I like to think that he had thoughts
[15:41] in his mind that he longed to have that
[15:43] time back where where before Eve was
[15:47] beguiled.
[15:48] But he he couldn't. He He didn't have
[15:50] that. He didn't have it. But there was
[15:52] something in him because part of Christ
[15:54] was in him. Amen. And Christ came to do
[15:57] what Adam could not do. Amen.
[16:01] So he his only choice was to go to
[16:04] torment with her. Brother Bandom says
[16:06] that. And then Jesus came. Amen. And he
[16:10] knew that no one else could do what he
[16:14] had to do. He went to hell. Let me tell
[16:16] you this this morning. He went to hell
[16:17] so you would not have to. I'm so glad
[16:21] for that.
[16:22] He went to hell so you would not have
[16:24] to.
[16:25] I've always thought it was so incredible
[16:27] when when you read of that and when you
[16:29] read about even with David and with
[16:31] Abselon and you know he he just kept
[16:33] have he had this heart for him and I
[16:35] believe it was because Christ was living
[16:37] in him. There was a part of Christ in
[16:39] him. It was a shadow and he longed to
[16:41] redeem him but he but he but he
[16:43] couldn't. There there was just something
[16:44] that couldn't do it because that was
[16:46] Christ in him. That was that was a part
[16:48] of Jesus living in him. And he longed
[16:50] because he that was his son. That was
[16:53] part of him. Amen. But God came to do
[16:56] what he could not do.
[16:59] Glory to God. It's always it was a
[17:00] shadow. It's always been Christ through
[17:03] through the scriptures. When when when
[17:05] you hear that that Jesus Christ is all
[17:07] through the Old Testament, it's because
[17:09] he is in shadow and type. Amen. If we
[17:12] can get that that clip going. Um, we go
[17:15] ahead and we hopefully play it on the
[17:17] screen. Just enjoy this with me.
[17:23] In the Garden of Eden,
[17:25] I see Adam back there when he put his
[17:27] arms around his little sweetheart to
[17:29] walk out with her. But God had condemned
[17:32] him.
[17:33] And he started out with his arms around
[17:35] his darling and was not deceived. He
[17:38] didn't have to walk out, but he walked
[17:40] out because he loved his wife. That's
[17:43] right.
[17:44] He walked out with both eyes wide open.
[17:46] No matter if she had to go to torment,
[17:49] he had go with her.
[17:50] When God looked down and seen that love
[17:53] of a human being, it was so great that
[17:55] he couldn't stand it himself.
[17:58] That's right. He said, "I'll come and go
[18:01] to" and he said, "I'll put image between
[18:03] her seed and the serpent's seed." Listen
[18:05] closely.
[18:06] 4,000 years later, y'all are in the city
[18:10] of Jerusalem. Let's change our scenes
[18:13] and look there. Come down the streets of
[18:16] Jerusalem. Bumpity bumpity bump out the
[18:19] gates of Damascus go towards Ga. A
[18:23] little fella with a crown and all the
[18:26] thorns on his head and across over his
[18:28] shoulder. Look all over his back, his
[18:31] little red spots. Where are they? Look
[18:34] back at when Adam was leaving with his
[18:36] sweetheart going out under condemnation
[18:38] with a shadow. a shadow of redemption
[18:42] somewhere because there was blood
[18:43] running over him somewhere. That was a
[18:45] shadow. He knew it. And I hear something
[18:47] going, "What is it?" It's the old bloody
[18:50] sheep skin beating up down his leg.
[18:52] Speaking of some There's a lamb beyond
[18:56] the river that they call the sweet
[18:58] forever. And we only reach that shore by
[19:02] degrees,
[19:03] knowing it someday they get back into
[19:05] Eden again.
[19:07] Now I just see him going down there now.
[19:09] The second Adam going up the yellow
[19:11] little spots on his back. They get
[19:13] bigger, bigger, bigger as he walks on.
[19:15] What is it? As you all go into one spot,
[19:18] I hear something beating again. What is
[19:20] it? There goes a second Adam no more
[19:23] than Jehovah himself who come down and
[19:26] was made. What? He'll go to hell with
[19:29] his sweetheart and redeem it back
[19:34] to redeem his bride. Hallelujah. He's
[19:37] seen Adam and he come down with flesh in
[19:40] thunder that he might marry the human
[19:43] race to himself.
[19:45] There he is going out to Calvary as he's
[19:48] moving up the hill and his poor old
[19:50] shoulder rubbing the old bee of death
[19:53] humming around him. It ain't going to be
[19:54] long till I'll get him buzzing all
[19:57] around and around. I had to had to sting
[19:59] him. But friend, you know, if a bee ever
[20:02] stings anybody deeply, he can't sting no
[20:06] more. He pulls his stinger out. So, he
[20:09] hasn't got no more stinger. And I'll
[20:11] tell you, that's the reason God was made
[20:13] flesh here on earth in order to hold the
[20:15] stinger of death. And now the death has
[20:18] no more sting. The beacon harm
[20:22] death free
[20:24] where is our victory but Christ the king
[20:27] and redeemer has made a way of escape
[20:30] our universe believer on this earth
[20:32] today.
[20:34] The bee might harm. The bee might buzz.
[20:38] The bee might try to make you afraid.
[20:40] But I can point G to Calvary where God
[20:43] himself has made flesh. where he helped
[20:45] the stainer of death and took my place
[20:47] as a sinner and paid the price.
[20:49] And he laid out the welcome mat of me to
[20:51] come home. Whosoever will, let him come
[20:53] and drink from the fountains of the
[20:55] waters of life freely.
[20:57] He that comes, I will in no wise cast
[20:59] out.
[21:01] Oh my, no wonder what Paul could say
[21:03] when he heard the axes out there being
[21:05] sharpened. Oh,
[21:06] when I stood in his cell a few days ago
[21:09] where he chopped his head off and he's
[21:11] bringing the axe in, the old bee hung
[21:13] around. He said, "Now I got you." He
[21:15] said, "Death worries your stain."
[21:18] Amen.
[21:18] It was left in Calvary on earth.
[21:21] Grace is a victory. But thanks be to God
[21:25] who gives us the victory through our
[21:27] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[21:29] God so loved the world that he gave so
[21:35] love. Adam so loved Eve that he went out
[21:38] with her. Christ so loved the church
[21:40] that he went with her.
[21:42] God so loved the world. Adam went with
[21:46] Eve in her wrong. She was wrong. He
[21:48] knows you're wrong. He was innocent but
[21:50] she was guilty. But Adam said, "I'll go
[21:52] with her." And Christ looked at the
[21:54] church and knowing it was wrong. Yet
[21:56] Christ went with us to take our place
[21:58] hunter as a sinner to die for us to take
[22:01] the sting out of death for us. Sinner,
[22:04] how can you reject such matchless love?
[22:08] No wonder Job said, "I know my redeemer
[22:10] liveth. At the last days he's going to
[22:12] stand upon the earth. And though the
[22:14] skin worms destroys this body, yet in my
[22:16] flesh shall I see God. I'll see him for
[22:19] myself. My eyes shall behold and not
[22:21] another." Do you believe it tonight? are
[22:24] times of swayed from us. Oh, how the
[22:27] Holy Spirit seem to be moving in my
[22:28] heart. I can't think of nothing,
[22:32] friends. Nothing no greater than how
[22:35] that Jesus come down here on earth and
[22:37] made the way of redemption and fulfill
[22:39] every plan come from the garden of Eden.
[22:42] Way before that, before the foundation
[22:44] of the world, Jehovah spoke and here
[22:46] comes Jesus taking his taken a spot and
[22:48] went out here and come and died was made
[22:51] sin that you could be saved. How could
[22:53] you reject such matchless love as that
[22:56] blessed redeemer hanging out of the gods
[22:58] of spit in his face, mockery and
[23:00] scandalized and a crown of thorns on his
[23:03] head, an innome man dying under the
[23:05] blood dripping from Emanuel's veins.
[23:08] Where sinners can plunge beneath the
[23:10] flood, lose all their guilt and shame.
[23:13] Shall we bow our heads? Heavenly Father,
[23:17] oh God, with my heart turning around and
[23:19] around it seems.
[23:21] Amen. knowing that you're here that this
[23:24] morning
[23:25] some someday that they'd get back to
[23:27] Eden again. That's what he said. Amen.
[23:29] The the plan of redemption. There's
[23:31] that's the grand plan. Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:34] There there is a way of escape. You
[23:37] know, don't miss that this morning when
[23:39] we're in service today. Let it be fresh
[23:41] for you. Amen. Go further than making
[23:44] contact with the sacrifice. Lean heavily
[23:48] into it this morning. Amen. Don't let
[23:51] that sacrifice lose its value in your
[23:54] life. Let it be fresh this morning.
[23:56] Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we
[23:59] thank you for this day, Lord. We're so
[24:01] grateful for the sacrifice that you made
[24:03] for us, Lord. Lord, it's just fresh in
[24:06] our hearts this morning. We're just
[24:09] asking that you'd come and move upon the
[24:10] service, Lord, in a special way, Lord.
[24:13] Grace us once more with your presence.
[24:14] We pray. Be with your people. We love
[24:16] you and we commit the service to you in
[24:18] Jesus name. Amen.
[24:20] Amen.
