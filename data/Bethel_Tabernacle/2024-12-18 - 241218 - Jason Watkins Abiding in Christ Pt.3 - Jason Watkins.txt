the Lord we're happy to have you in the house of God Amen praise the Lord got a number of prayer requests we'll get to here just shortly uh but we want to look into the word and looking forward to carrying on this evening amen um the Lord has really touched my heart in this thought abiding in Christ and my I it just seems like it just keeps unfolding and unfolding and so Gideon was asking me today he said P you think I'll I'll be married before you finish this series I said I don't know we'll see how it goes amen praise the Lord but um we we to see how much the Lord has that be all right amen I'm trying to um I hate to be hog in the pull pit but hey I gave up my Sunday for brother Paul which we enjoyed wow and I enjoyed the fellowship the next day amen with brother Paul such a good friend we got to talk quite a bit about what he's been preaching and what I've been preaching on this series and we were both having a jubilee amen around the word of God so I'm trying to uh get all my preaching in I'm going to take a little vacation at the the beginning of the year take a couple weeks off and uh I've already informed brother Matt to be ready to uh handle things and so I'm going to probably turn my phone off and go to the Wilderness amen praise the Lord he don't know it yet but I'm going to hit up brother Rodney to take me in the woods for a few days sometime in January amen and not leave me but uh stay with me I would go by myself but sister Debbie won't let me so I have to go with somebody that knows what they're doing amen praise the lord well brother Rodney is probably hearing that so now cat's out of the bag Amen brother Rodney sister Debbie ain't signed off on it in blood yet but I'm working on it amen praise the Lord God bless you friends uh Proverbs chapter 18 you know you know that uh you found the mind of the Lord when you you got to turn to your text and you just open your Bible at random and it opens to your text amen so praise the Lord amen Proverbs 18 and I just have one verse ver verse 10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe is that good news there's a strong tower you can run into it and you're safe amen let's pray father we thank you now for your word that we're looking at tonight master I'm have so much confidence in my heart that you're in this Lord and I'm just going to relax myself I've looked it over and and and sat quietly Lord in your presence for many days just noting here noting there moving this changing that adding this Lord and I just feel father tonight with such a confidence in my heart that you're here to speak to us in your word Lord I know it's just a Wednesday night but there are no common nights in your presence Lord your presence always brings the things that we need father in this life it's a very troubled world that we live in and I'm glad Lord that we have a strong tower a place of safety that we can run into we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated praise the Lord some fiend had stolen my mic and it wasn't in my office so I told them it's gone and they got it to me but it was already too late I was already ready to step forward so I'm going to be a good boy tonight stay right here behind the microphone amen and if I move um I'll grab a handheld but I think brother Jackson you should be able to get me pretty good this mic works pretty good amen Amen brother Matt won't like it but amen I didn't have a mic so praise the Lord Proverbs chapter 18 verse 10 now I want to just say tonight that I I'm going to read quite a a few statements that brother Brandon made and the reason I'm doing this is because I can hardly improve on it and say it better than he has said it so I'm glad we have a church who loves the message of the hour amen praise the Lord so I I'm just I don't know that I'll read all of these verbatim I'm going to uh look through them and kind of read the parts that I have highlighted and if I read on a little bit it's for context I have one quote that is quite lengthy and so I've put that on the overhead we won't pull that up just yet uh we'll get to that just in a little bit amen I'll have this ready to go and we'll catch that just in a little bit all right so now our our our title tonight or I'm sorry our text our opening text was Proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe now I either I some somehow had not ever caught it and maybe because it wasn't so burning in my heart concerning abiding in Christ either I either I never caught it or I had forgotten until I read this quote that brother brandham is actually actually links Proverbs 18 verse 10 this Strong Tower and he links it to where we've been reading in St John 15 where Jesus said abide in me and you're going to hear brother brandham say he's that strong tower abide that's the Strong Tower that you run into and are safe he says from 1962 letting off the pressure what a consolation it is this hour when the people of the world church members running from place to place trying to find a refuge and they say now here's what here's what is commonly said one will say well you have to recite our Creed the other one will say you have to join our church but but for that believer who comes now catch this language for that believer who just comes calmly and receives the Holy Ghost and watch every promise of God made manifest among them they don't have to run from here to there they can just let off the steam see they don't have to run from here to there they that's right sit down catch this language set down it's all over God got it made then letting off the pressure is that amazing in this hour where men's hearts are failing for fear there's a place where you can just calmly come to the holy spirit let off the pressure just oh he loves me I am my beloveds and he is mine what does it matter anyway and the brother brandham said you can just calmly come to the Holy Ghost and and take every promise and Christ will make it manifest you don't have to run good news good news you don't have to run from here to there you don't have to recite a Creed you don't have to belong to a certain church you can just sit down and relax in Christ so here's where he makes the connection he goes on the name of the Lord this this is our text the name of the Lord is a mighty tower when the righteous run into it are safe what kind of a tower did you ever know brother Brandon's going to identify the tower what kind of a tower it's a tower of Refuge we can go in there and he says his in the very next paragraph if ye abide in me the Tower if you abide in me the Tower when the righteous run into it they're safe what kind of a tower see so he he's going on my if you abide in me the Tower my words abide in you now that's when you're on the inside abide in see not when you're out there looking in but when you're in here looking out when if you abide in me my words abide in you you can ask what you will we are living in a day where you're going to need access to that kind of power where you're going to have to find yourself in situations it's in Prophecy we're not going to escape at all we are going into a Rapture the tribulation can't come until uh this bride is gone brother brandom's seventh vision of annihilation cannot happen till we're gone but there are things that you're going to need to be able to go to God and say I need this and and and because you're abiding in Christ you're safe you're calm you're relaxed when the world is falling apart you're not I remember reading to you and I gave you the the math and the statistics from Annie Jacobson on nuclear Deton and we did we we went through her her material on what a just a one Megaton nuclear detonation falling on Washington DC would would the effect that would have and it left us a gas and we I remember we we sat here and I knew it was coming cuz I had already listened to it I knew you didn't know and I watched the shock hit your face and some of you even commented to me after the most shocking part is after she takes probably 10 minutes and starts talking about about the almost unimaginable destruction and death and the Heat and the annihilation and the buildings and the atmosphere and millions of people are dying and the and the and the and the energy is is moving out and it's crossing the Beltway it's moving on out into Virginia up into Maryland and it's still going and after about 10 minutes of death in Mayhem she says we're now three seconds after detonation amen and that blew my mind 3 seconds in brother brandham says because he was living in an age where there was a big nuclear scare and everybody was wanting to build you know cellers and build bomb shelters down into the ground and brother brandham said an atomic bomb would ever blast this place it would go so deep into the ground it would break every bone in your body there would be no safety in a bomb shelter there'd be no there's going to be no safety in Mount Shasta I'm sorry but everything is going to Ash and Cinder I'm glad there's a tower of safety that's nuke proof bomb proof destruction proof penetration proof I can go in there and I can look out on the Mayhem of the world and I can rest in peace and safety this is actually the sermon where you've heard me say many times that tremendous judgments are rushing to meet us and the only way out is up you've heard me say that that's actually brother Bram say says that here in this sermon There's No Escape only up there's no Escape only up get away from me yes sir how how do you get up that's what I need to know okay you've convinced me the only way out is to go up how do I go up he says go down first amen that's right go down confess your sins believe on the Lord Jesus Christ be buried with him in baptism rise in his resurrection with the Holy Spirit lifts you up above the cares above the worries above the unbelief of the world it doesn't just Lift Me Up Above the sin and the unbelief it lifts me up above the cares and above the worries and above the stresses and above the problems I'm lifted up above the shadows of this broken world the name of the Lord the spirit lifts you up above it yes that's it the name of the Lord is a mighty tower a mighty rock in a weary land amen we live in a very very weary land oh yeah the righteous run into it and are saved we thank God for that what a contrast what what contrast and how very different it is from having to recite a Creed or having to join a church brother venom goes on here in the message God keeps his word part one in 1957 he says listen brother now catch this this this quote meant a great deal to me at a very personal level and I know it'll you'll appreciate it as well he says listen brother you're never saved by any sign amen amen you're never saved by any sensation when you're saved your life will be a sign you might have experience all kinds of Sensations and Jubilee time in the presence of the Lord I love that I like that every day I want that every day amen amen but you're not saved by any sign you're not Sav saved by any sensation you are saved when you meet God's condition in his of his word now brother brandham you're you're about to learn something here brother brandom is not rebuking the people he's actually about to give you such an ultimate encouragement because I thought my goodness if a prophet can say that and not just a prophet an actually a dispensational angel amen who's coming at at a change of dis dispensation and if he could make this kind of a statement There's Hope for you and me say get to the statement brother Jason I'm about to listen you're saved because you meet God's condition of his word and nothing else are you saved by amen that's right God's word has made a way you're not saved because you feel like you're saved I'm not saved here it is you ready to relax in the Holy Spirit brother brandham says I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved cuz lots of times I don't feel that way I just said what did he say I ran it back and he said you're not I'm not I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way but I'm saved because God gave a promise I met the condition and upon God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights because it's God's word I'm here to tell you now we're Way Beyond a Creed or joining a church you're living in a tower hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you Lord um who do I got Z is that you honey give me Psalms 103 Zoe Psalms 103 and I want to catch verses um let's catch verses 10 to 14 Psalms 10310 to14 I love this watch this now verse 10 Psalms 103:10 he hath not dealt with us after our sins boy am I glad amen you say and how am I ever glad he hath not dealt with us after our sins now if David is admitting the first thing David is admitting in that statement is I make mistakes I have failures we got sins thank God he's not dealing with me after my sins nor rewarding us according to our iniquities iniquities is a pretty bad thing that's things you know you should do but you don't do it or things you know you should not do but you do it and let's just look each other in the eye and say where I I I need God's grace and I need God's mercy I want you to know that this kind of Mercy is what accompanies abiding in Christ he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities verse 11 for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him amen as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions brother ROM said he cast them in the sea of his forgetfulness never to be remembered even God cannot remember your sins that are in his sea of forgetfulness it is filled with the blood of Emmanuel and that and a sinner once plunged beneath that flood Lo loses all his guilty stains as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us love this verse 13 and 14 like as a father pth his children so the Lord pith them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he rememberthe are dust so so God so there's something God remembers I'm glad he forgets my sins but I'm glad he remembers I'm just dust Hallelujah friends he forgets all your transgressions he forgets your iniquities they're in the blood of Christ but he remembers not just forgets my sins but he also remembers I'm trapped in this death body Hallelujah I didn't come this way I was subjected to it by by the Creator but I'm glad there's a tower that I can run in I'm glad I can abide in Christ so that every day when I need some of that Mercy every day when I need to say Lord remember I'm just dust take away all my sins and and iniquities amen that's the reality of the Strong Tower that's the reality of abiding not just come unto me abide in me he forgets my sin and he remembers I'm trapped I just thought what a deal I know a good deal when I see one what a plan I'll take it sign me up Hallelujah brother Ernie was years ago he was in the fellowship hall and he was test testifying to us hey come up through the religious Mary got around and he was an alter boy and a Catholic and then he was a Baptist and then he was a UPC and then he was you know he was with PTL and then he came to the message and and and he said when he first came into Catholicism he come in he said he said man he said I was about as runchy as you could possibly get and he said I heard the priest up there talking about how that I could have all my sins and and and done away with in Christ and he said I I'd never heard anything like that in my life he said I would he said I walked up there as brother Ernie wood he said now let me make sure I got this straight you're telling me that if I'll accept Christ all my sins everything I've ever done is gone and the priest said yes and brother Ernie said sign me up and we all started laughing just like that and we said Ernie what did you mean he goes no no that's what they did they made you sign it they you're going to accept Christ okay sign right here he said sign me up oh Hallelujah I'm glad he my heart is signed with his signature and it's signed in blood hallelujah thank you Lord It's a truth that unlocks this great mystery of abiding in Christ this this mystery this truth that unlocks this mystery I want to say to you tonight friends that abiding in Christ is often simpler than we think amen and if I if there's one thing that I have desired to accomplish is to let you know the access that you have to to it by faith in Christ by faith in the word that he's sent in this hour that he has unfolded his mystery to us he had to do that it was it was it was the mysteries of Christ it was the revelation of Jesus Christ that was going to perfect the bride that was going to dress her in the garments of the word this is the very thing that the 10 virgins awoke to arise the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him and and that of course connects right to because that's the message come out of her my people the Midnight Cry has come come out of the church go into Christ see so he's going to have to dress Us in the garments of his word you're your the garments of your opinions are worth almost nothing and we know that it's worth less than nothing to the age because they're found naked miserable poor blind and naked see but there is a Tru truth that unlocks this mystery of abiding in Christ and it's often simpler than we think it's it's very natural for a Believer H at least it has been with me I'm sure it is with you very natural for a Believer to long for that closeness and that richness of his presence friends I to me I once was young and now I'm old and I can tell you there's nothing so satisfying as living in that presence with Christ there's nothing so refeshing nothing so safe nothing so comforting nothing so so and strengthening and empowering and helping you Face Tomorrow When the world has to face it with drugs and alcohol and fast living and every kind of distraction and every kind of thing to numb their senses I don't have to have mine numbed my I I have the Holy Spirit it renews me it refreshes me say are you glad you got it I'm so glad I got it I want more of it and and if he gives you more more of it will he yes he is tonight giving you more of it right now and I'm going to want more of it tomorrow and the next day and the next day and I I I I constantly want to move into abiding in Christ that's the truth sure it is that's how we feel genuinely yes but the busyness of life life being what it is too often in our busy lives we find ourselves strayed from him amen we amen look at your neighbor and say we we are all in this together the business of life is a plague upon all of us the distractions of leoda are a plague upon all of us and I'm here to tell you it's filled with fears and anxiety and you and and I could start down a list and I could start down a list of this that you'd say I'm not afraid of that and I'd hit another I'm not afraid of that I I'd get to one eventually I promise you we'd get down the list far enough I'd hit something you're afraid of I'd hit something that might not bother me but bothers you and something that bothers might not bother you but bothers me and and and and and I know that that's the enemy doing that in fact is he he his whole the Satan eats sleeps drinks thinks constantly his every waking moment is how can I distract the bride of Christ he doesn't not worried about the rest of the world he already has them how do I distract the bride she's the only one who can defeat meall this is not abiding in him like he told us to do we get too busy we find Our Lives straight from him see that's not abiding in him now I'm not saying you and and I dealt with this a little bit in Parts one and part two because we and I don't want to jump ahead of myself for tonight but but we we know that he he died to save Sinners he died for the sins of the whole world he said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden I give you rest Jesus offers salvation a legit it's it's a nonous offer he offers a legitimate opportunity for every human to save himself from this destructing this world that's falling apart amen but but and that's something that they have to choose to do but we have taught and shown and proven in the Bible year after year that let me tell you something friends Jesus said to his own you have actually not chosen me I have chosen you and I chose you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah my job my what what is upon me I do have to be born again but my life's goal is to is to relax into the vision and begin cooperating in the vision that he already knows is a vision of me amen and that is the and the and so the only one that can abide many can come many are called few are chosen many of the world can come to Christ and and actually the unwise Virgin they come to Christ and they they encounter a Salvation experience now it's not a new birth because they have to go through the tribulation it's obvious that they're not born again because Jesus had promised whoever is in St John 5:24 would not go through the tribulation and they would not come to the judgment and since the foolish virgin do both they're in the tribulation and they stand before the Judgment where he divides them as a Shepherd would divide sheep from goats they're in Matthew 25 so we know that's not the bride because the bride is Seated on the throne with him amen so the world has an invitation to come to Christ and save themselves from this unto generation but I'm here to tell you something friends you can't not choose the word because you're a part of the word and it's a part of you and God comes and reveals himself to you and it it fits it's you it's him it's the word no wonder we say Amen to every word no wonder we're the ones who can abide in him see the only way you can abide in him is you have to be in him and the only ones who actually get in him are the ones he gets into and the only ones he gets into are the redeemed of the lord they're not just Sav from destruction they are redeemed they are born again by the spirit of God Amen so the whole message of abide is just to the the predestinated elect that's right it's the only ones who are considered in Redemption amen only the predestinated are considered in Redemption right see cuz that's beyond just common salvation so it's to us as I said to you and I I so I so you know as the old term is cabbage down on that hard because I wanted you to understand I'm speaking to Born Again people and I'm saying Jesus said to you you born again people you redeemed you see Gene of my loins you need to abide in me if you don't if you let the busyness of life get you at distance from me then then then you're you're you're limiting what I can do through you you're not losing your Redemption you've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb but you need to abide in me because only by abiding in me you I am the vine you are the branches amen without me you can do nothing you who you redeemed amen you genes of God that's right you can do nothing unless you abide in the fine we know there are some who don't abide because they've never been born again we talked about that brother Bradon made that clear he said you've never come far enough that's right amen but we're talking about the the other side of that as we as we showed you on part one and so so it is to us friends we do have to take ownership of the fact and realize that sometimes the busyness of Our Lives can pull us away and and I my heart breaks with Agony to see people of my flock people who I've dedicated my life to people who I've tried to preach to and tried to live it and I see the busyness of Life carrying them away at distance are are they lost I don't believe they're lost but they're carried away and God cannot work through them like he needs to work through them and it's heartbreaking because I I see it you I mean you look look at look at how many times people allow Career School yeah money the pursuit of worldly pleasures social uh acceptance and that is prioritized even over the most fundamental thing of a Christian is being at church yeah amen am assembling yourselves at the house of God they're not here their families aren't here their children it teenagers facing an impossible situation and parents have no more care than to let the cares of the world draw them at distance amen amen as we said to you before applying the token is not a cliche applying the token is bringing your family into contact with the token that's what you do when you apply you apply something you bring it into contact a prophet the Holy Spirit was warning him when it was Kindergarten days of the 1960s the nation the world was Kindergarten compared to now and he was saying you're going to have to apply the [Music] token [Music] amen so this is this is the burden of my heart this is not a time to be at distance you Brothers and Sisters You teenagers this is not a time to be at distance the world is ending the bride is going home this is a time to be on fire this a time to be abiding in Christ it happens to us too often I appreciated brother Paul using Peter I I I actually had that in my notes for weeks because you know perhaps like Peter sometimes we we take our eyes off of him yeah we get our eyes on the on the cares of the world and that's what happened to Peter as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus those waves meant nothing amen I mean and that's what brother Paul was talking about how that you know they're they're all worried about these waves we're going to die don't you care we're about to drown and when Jesus wakes up and looks around he completely ignored their question because the the the problem was not the waves the problem was not the lifethreatening situation the problem was Their Fear how is it that you're so afraid why would they be afraid for goodness sake Jesus is in the boat the creator of the Winds and the waves the creator of the whole world you've got the word of God in your life in your heart you believe him what would you be afraid of the world and the cares of the world the problem is a lack of faith the problem is too much fear and that's a consequence of living at distance Amen on yeah instead of Abiding and it starts small and Satan takes you just a little bit away a little bit away the next thing you know you're way off away and you're sinking oh you know something friends I I I remember saying to you in part one how that that that I wanted you to understand and I and I remember saying to you you know we have these things in our lives and if we're honest we know that they're true but I wanted you to understand I said if you don't remember anything I want to put this indelibly in your heart that that this is what's so important to understand is that you're failures and we have them but that is that is not a reflection of your Worth to him it's not a reflection of your faith in the word of God you remember that well I want to say to you tonight can I Lodge this this this thought in your mind indelibly place it in your heart is that he is always inviting you back to a deeper relationship Hallelujah where you can find renewed joy and renewed strength he'll never stop drawing you into that Hallelujah that feeling you have even right now where the Lord is speaking to you that's him that's him right while I'm preaching that's him inviting you back to that refreshing time oh I love that song as as sister Brenda wrote the more that I Surrender Hallelujah the lighter my load the more that I release my cares the more he takes control amen hallelujah amen friends that's what you're feeling even right now amen I remind you that brother brandham had and I gave you this as as part of the foundation of why everything that I've been preaching on is true why is everything that I've been in this series on why is it true what's driving it why does God care that I abide amen why such a big deal that I don't live at distance because he had a three-fold plan to to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by his by this his church which is his body the bride till he could have preeminence to express himself through them again and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adom here it is to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people with them fellowshipped with them you understand I know you want to go to heaven I know you want to Fellowship God can I say to you he wanted to Fellowship you before there was startup he had the whole plan of a kingdom why won't he leave me alone because he desires to restore you back to the rightly position where he had fellowship with you and he walked with you in the cool of the day this is why he said to his family abide in me so we when we when we think of this as I jumped ahead of myself a few minutes ago this abiding is the level that God's redeemed family and only God's redeemed family can enjoy or let me say it like this this is you are the only people in the earth who are given the opportunity to choose to abide amen that being true then that makes then that gives you the ability to choose how close you will abide how much Fellowship you would like I'm here to tell you something friends my whole heart's burden that if I could p take my heart and put it into you we'd have a whole church that wants him Night and Day Day and Night every moment I want him more and more and more and more and however much room brother brandham said however much room you'll empty out and make room for him he'll fill that place I say Lord Empty Me Empty Me Oh God come in fill up all of those places in my life however much you will empty out he will fill it give me my PowerPoint Z it's about 17 minutes after I think I can get through this in about 13 minutes I'm just going to read this quote abiding in Christ and and for our subtitle of course this doesn't surprise you the continuing Journey now I I want you to pay close attention this is a lengthy quote it has a lot of frames not as many as it needs to have but I like putting the letters big so everybody in the back can read them it it hurts my feelings when I'm sitting at the back and the rewards are too small in I camera like what is it saying and so I I because of that I get a lot of extra frames so don't don't don't don't panic I'm fixing the clothes don't get nervous that's what it is don't get nervous I'm fixing the clothes with brother digs that means nothing but with me I really am this this quote I I can't improve on it when you see this tonight it's from 1955 Fellowship by Redemption you're going to understand from a prophet's language everything that I'm trying to get across to you all right this is this represents the process of coming from sin to Christ the door Christ is the door to coming through the blood coming into Christ being born again and abiding in the whole process amen all right now Feast your eyes this is beautiful brother brandham says now the next thing he's speaking about the Tabernacle in the wilderness that Moses built all right the next thing the blood off of this innocent substitute was struck seven times like that as a public testimony that that screen went out if somebody can get that for me so I can look that way excuse me like that as a public testimony seven is God's complete number seven Church ages the seven last Church ages Church of Philadelphia the Church of Lea the church every Church age must come through that same blood now the man's come he sets in the congregation he's heard the word now watch he wants Fellowship that building is the only place of Fellowship the only place they could come was in this building to have fellowship with God cause God only met them in there now watch close now what a type of Christ today God hasn't promised to Fellowship through the Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal he has promised to Fellowship he has promised to Fellowship amen but not in a Creed or denomination but he has promised to Fellowship in Christ Jesus here he is see you see why we had to have a message that restored this because he wanted Fellowship I wanted Fellowship see that's where your fellowship is it's amazing how many people who actually believe what God has done in the this day and absolutely have had an experience of the Holy Ghost but who have very limited to almost no fellowship with this because we live at distance and the devil has pulled us aside and distracted us so bad come on come on people you can have fellowship with your men of mankind to join the Moose the elk the odd fellas I don't know what that is those lodges that's right they're fine that's not what I'm talking about this morning I'm talking about the fellowship with Christ the Eternal one amen now then when the blood has been sprinkled the waters the washing of the Water by the word the word went forth you say well look I've joined Church I've done this but really I haven't had that experience what is it it's the Waters of Separation well I thought I was all right if I joined mother's church that isn't it brother no sir someone died for you that was Christ Jesus you must accept him then you receive that then the next thing you start toward the fellowship here you go well brother bradam where can I Fellowship in Christ in the temple the Tabernacle of his dwelling how do I do it first you walk to the door you've heard the word then you walk to the door you've got a mental Faith you say yes I've heard the word I believe it remember friends that you we've got to get past this anomaly at the end time it's been in every age but it's pronounced particularly pronounced at the end time where people because they uh they admire the fine qualities of Jesus they emulate certain parts of the gospel and they talk about that day on Calvary and they talk about the love of God nothing really changes in their lives amen but they brother BR said but they are a Christian because they espouse the Christian teaching but he says that's a mental conception that's not a real Spirit born Christian this is this is where they stop at right here see he said you've heard the word then you walk to the door you've got a mental Faith you say yes I've heard the word I believe too many times that's where people go I got it and walk away right amen watch now before you can enter this place oh wait you mean I haven't entered yet no no you haven't entered yet you've walked to the door You' believe the word you you've got a mental Faith you say yes I've heard the word I believe it now before you can enter into this place there's a blood Veil hanging there for your for the cleansing and you must recognize that blood as an innocent substitute through the preaching of the word brought down the veil of blood in there you see that someone died in your place then then here's what happens then you'll throw down down all your Earthly possessions all your Fandango ideas all your dancing your moreal living and all the things that you've thought up that you've thought up in your own self that you go to church and your new rules your Ten Commandments you're not meeting non- meating non non- meat eating and all these things you lay them aside say wow this is getting good he's just getting started plunge holy into the blood and say Here's what here's my sermon to you tonight friends plunge holy into the blood and say Lord wash me and cleanse me then the holy spirit inside this blood cell where the fellowship is draws you through the blood of the cleansing into the Lord Jesus by the Holy Spirit then you're in the fellowship then you're in the fellowship amen come on we go home now no keep watch old things has passed away then you're in the fellowship by the Holy Spirit drawing you into a relationship with God is that happening do you feel something drawing you say but I've got so many mistakes I know that remember he forgets your sins under the blood he remembers Your Dust do you feel the pull amen then would just say to you if you feel the pull respond to it just say Lord I don't know how I can get there but I feel you pulling on me see drawing you into a relationship with God and then there is only here it is only one meeting place that any man can ever meet and worship today in True Fellowship that's in Christ Jesus do you see it church do you see it church amen I'm been lengthy this morning don't think didn't aim to stay this long but I hope you see what I've tried to present to you you may be ever so good you may belong to a fine church that's all good nothing against that but have you ever come down to the fellowship yet with him coming and only way you'll do it is through the blood of his suffering then you come to the place and hear the word and say yes Jesus died in my stead it's not just Jesus died for me it's Jesus died instead of me I believe that now I've got to be cleansed from all this temper and I've got to be cleansed from all this temper and all this stuff that I can that I go on with Hey listen friends we got things in our flesh that we go on with rather naturally and if you're living at distance that natural flesh is still alive and those things if you live at distance and you're not abiding in him I'm not saying you haven't come in and got cleansed and had a holy ghost experience I'm saying if you're not abiding in him you're still living in a death body and it'll rear its ugly head tomorrow and the next day at work in your home you you can't the only way to keep this flesh under the word is to abide in Christ yes sir amen that temper and all this stuff that I go that I go on with now Lord take me through the blood here I am and after a while after a while the sweet peace that passes all understanding will come into that human heart then you'll look up there and you'll say now I'm living in the fellowship wherever I go whatever I do I'm in his wonderful Fellowship peace that pass is all understanding the holy spirit is living in me I live every day if death comes what can it do to me can't harm me your soul Longs for something out there daily you're looking for it and seeing where's it at Daily I'm looking where is it at Lord where is your presence at what do I got to get rid of out of my life that's blocking me from seeing you what have I allowed to make me live at distance from you your old Tabernacle here aches and groans and squeaks man and oh my as the old birth pangs are coming upon it that's right what does it mean this old lump of clay someday is going to fade away thank God but there is something inside of that little lump of clay there that's trying to get out trying to liberate itself oh what is it it's a little bird called The Soul I'm trapped In This Old House of clay but there's something trying to get out say why won't he just let me go here's why here's why here's why you can't leave yet and the only way it can free itself one morning the clay will break away and will drop and rise and seiz the Everlasting prize when the soul goes to meet its lover Yonder both arms out the only thing that's keeping you here is this little old rackety bunch a clay and the only way that God can preach the gospel today is through that lump of clay and that's why he's keeping you here and that's why you sick people has a right to come to Christ say Lord Jesus if you'll only heal me now I'll go I may not be a preacher but I'll talk about it I'll do everything that I can do amen amen you are the Vine I'm one of the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit the branches bear fruit not the vine the branch the vine only puts the energy into it the gospel can be preached by Christ if you will open up yourself to be a branch that'll bear forth fruit amen did you know he hung the whole thing on you and I others can see Christ in you by your testimony by your life and the way you live He's the energy but you're the show picture you're the walking Bible amen I love that my I love that God bless you friend I trust that you'll take these brokeup words this morning as I've been weak in my body and so forth and you'll take them into your heart and realize that I brought them from my heart to get on that Foundation back to fellowship with Christ then you'll never have to run from here and there and Over Yonder and around you're in constant fellowship with him all the time amen you're in constant fellowship with him all the time this is the level that God's redeemed family only can choose from why should Jesus deepen the invitation from come unto me to abide in me amen come unto me goes to the whole world and it's good on the check for anybody who believe it can be saved whosoever will can be saved amen amen but we're going be Beyond come unto me to abide in me and the simple truth friends as you've seen here with me in this long lengthy quote the spirit of the Lord knows that saving your soul isn't just about you making a decision from your intelligence it's about experiencing God's very life entering our hearts two omnipotents met brother br talks about that Gene of God in you and the omnipotent Holy Spirit comes to omnipotence meet I'm here to tell you friends what is the new birth two omnipotent forms of life unite and stay in that perfect Oneness forever and that's where I want to live I hope that's where you want to live say Lord I Want To Live abiding in you stand up

are you enjoying this friends this is a journey through through the word of God we're going to continue the weekend the Lord willing to continue journeying in it it has meant so much to me at a personal level I have found myself and I've known the Lord for so many years now so many decades serving God and all around the earth carrying the gospel I've seen God do such miraculous things I better keep this open so I can see the prayer request I've seen him do such miraculous things that defy the human mind I I've seen it with my own eyes I've seen instantaneous healings right in front of my eyes or I've seen I I've seen blinded eyes open I've seen epilepsy demons come off of people I've seen lying demons come off of people and saw the demon come off of them and run off into Oblivion I've seen God deliver I've seen him fill with the Holy Spirit and yet and yet even Within my own self as I'm studying this St John 15 I've just said Lord I realize that there's even more that I can attain there's even a higher place there's even a deeper richer relationship with Christ I want it friends I want it for me I want it for you I want it for your children I hope you want it for your family as bad as I do oh let's bow our heads now before we take up our prayer requests Lord [Music] I managed to get down to the point where I thought I could I was hoping to make it there and I did I thank you for that I thank you for honest hearts in here tonight Lord and honest hearts that have pulled on the word of God have agreed and amen the word Lord and in their hearts I know that they believe it we need you Jesus there's sometimes Lord in our lives where and it might be so in here tonight I know there's been times it's been true for me for sure more times than I'd be comfortable admitting Lord when when I found myself at distance and I and I I I I said I I I've remember too many times saying Lord I I don't know how I can even get back close again I love you but I'm so drawn away I'm so caught and and and and Lord if we just be honest there's many times where we just say I just need God to come and do it I just need him to come and help me and bring me back

I need you I need you Lord we need you Lord I need you right now right now amen praise the Lord anybody got a testimony before we go we give you an opportunity cut us on here brother Brad and brother Caleb is going to start us off [Music] amen for the last few weeks I've been in a certain kind of mood where I feel like I'm not living up to the way the Lord wants me to as I'm sure everyone does and got that right and the sermon today before brother Jason spoke on his um verse I opened up directly into it same as him and I was just like okay that's pretty cool and then brother Jason had the same thing happen I was like that's double cool so I know the Lord's going to speak through me or speak to me through this sermon and if it was for anybody else it was for me I definitely needed that exact verse I have a strong tower to go to and the Satan I will not admit that he has victory in any part of my life and he's been trying to give me the spirit of depression and I'm not accepting that Amen brother I'm just claiming Victory that's right that's [Applause] right the reason the reason that brother Caleb is claiming that kind of Victory is because he can you have the right to be free that's what that day on Calvary means to the believer I have a right to be free I have a right to any Redemptive blessing that that day on Calvary purchased I have a right to it and the devil listen friends it becomes an inalienable right when you're born again of the spirit God an inalienable right means that you don't need anyone's permission to have it it's yours it can't even no one needs to tell you it's yours it's yours inalia it's in it's intrinsic to you it comes with the new birth whatever Christ purchased he now lives inside you Hallelujah you've got the purchase price and the purchaser living inside you amen anybody else got a testimony tonight before we go praise the Lord all right who is it I see a hand [Music] well every time I give a testimony it's usually about a vehicle so I got another one okay um a couple months ago I gave a testimony about the Lord giving me a truck it was that white you know the first Ford I bought um well I drove it for a day after I fixed it and the motor blew up so I won't buy another Ford but it was just kind of a really really hard time to kind of go through Vehicles would get fixed go down get fixed go down and I was just kind of felt like I was beating my head against the wall but the last couple weeks couple month or to a month it was just like okay Lord I will do I'll keep fixing it I I'll keep doing whatever you want me to do but I have to have a vehicle I have to have a truck to work to pull my trailers to do everything that I'm doing that he gives me the work to do you know so I was just praying hard for not just a specific truck or anything like that just a truck and I kind of knew what I liked but he gave me another truck kind of just beyond what I could ever have asked for I mean I wasn't looking for the nice and shiny thing but he gave it to me and I'm really really really happy about it soise the [Applause] Lord amen praise the Lord we're going to let you go it's starting to get up toward 9 o' turn around shake hands with somebody greet them in the name of the Lorden wish them God's great blessing we'll see you this weekend Lord bless you you can be dismissed in Jesus name God bless you thank you for
