[7:05] no no no no no no no no no no no
[7:10] I will never go back anymore
[7:16] [Music]
[7:37] so I guess I got to I get to give her
[7:40] testimonies through my voice
[7:42] and so then I get to make a little bit
[7:44] more personal to how I felt
[7:47] um 15 weeks ago to the day
[7:50] um
[7:52] I saw my mom and at that point she just
[7:54] had first her first surgery for bladder
[7:58] cancer and the biopsy results had come
[8:00] back and they said that she had high
[8:02] grade
[8:04] carcinoma they weren't sure what they
[8:06] were going to do because she had gotten
[8:09] that bladder cancer
[8:11] as a result of her breast cancer
[8:13] treatment 12 years prior
[8:15] so
[8:17] the chemo they would normally use was
[8:20] the chemo that had caused it so that
[8:21] made a little bit more complicated
[8:24] um
[8:25] but the Tuesday night I worked a full
[8:28] day
[8:29] and then hirama and I went and drove 18
[8:32] hours straight
[8:33] and went and saw her she was at my
[8:35] sister's at that point you know getting
[8:37] her post operative Care at my sister's
[8:40] and she wasn't doing well we weren't
[8:43] sure how that was going to go
[8:45] but one of the things that stood up
[8:47] stood out to us and that stood out to
[8:49] her and I told her about that too is
[8:51] an angel got medicine away it was a man
[8:54] that had said I survived a snake bite
[8:57] and I just wanted to stop by and tell
[8:59] you that I've prayed for you and your
[9:00] journey will be all right
[9:02] and at that point in time it's probably
[9:04] 11 o'clock at night and stopped at a gas
[9:06] station somewhere in North Georgia at
[9:07] that point
[9:08] and
[9:11] I didn't fall asleep I drove all the way
[9:14] you know and um
[9:16] Ram was trying to work in the back seat
[9:17] and
[9:19] but her symptoms started in on Mother's
[9:22] Day you know my brother had bought her a
[9:26] um a two-hour massage and she gone to
[9:28] that and came back and started she had
[9:31] blood in her hearing and she didn't she
[9:33] kind of said okay it's because of
[9:35] massage she was expecting her fourth
[9:37] grandchild at the time my sister was
[9:39] having her first baby in the middle of
[9:42] May so she was looking forward to that
[9:45] um
[9:46] so fast forward my sister had her baby
[9:49] she went to go stay there for a couple
[9:51] weeks and had found out you know she'd
[9:54] gone to the doctor she had the same
[9:55] symptoms went to doctor twice they said
[9:56] it was nothing
[9:58] she came home and
[10:01] um
[10:02] went for a walk and came back and she
[10:04] had let a new urine again so she was in
[10:07] Urgent Care that was two minutes down
[10:08] the road she sat there by herself
[10:10] and they did a CT scan and they said we
[10:14] think you might have something
[10:15] suspicious going on
[10:17] and uh so she got that news by herself
[10:20] drove herself home and at that moment in
[10:23] time I think I called right mom I called
[10:26] um I had called her on the way home and
[10:28] she had told me that's what was going on
[10:32] and that started the cycle of course but
[10:35] she
[10:37] she had great faith through the whole
[10:38] thing
[10:40] um
[10:41] I remember looking you know at some one
[10:44] of the nights I was just looking through
[10:46] the sermons and I just typed in bladder
[10:48] cancer and it was only one quote that
[10:50] came up specifically for bladder cancer
[10:52] and it was from
[10:54] the message the way of a true Prophet
[10:56] preaching 63 or 119 and the cult
[11:00] basically said you know Sister belief or
[11:03] your healing it's gone
[11:05] and she took that and believed upon that
[11:08] and
[11:09] um irama had also sent her a sermon by
[11:11] uh brother Donnie about we don't want no
[11:13] snakes and she took those two things and
[11:15] really took that to heart and said that
[11:18] is not my confession
[11:20] so
[11:22] they scheduled a follow-up surgery a
[11:25] couple weeks earlier and the cancer that
[11:29] went from
[11:31] the surgeon calling my brother who was
[11:33] an uncle who was an oncologist a
[11:35] pediatric oncologist and apologizing
[11:37] because he found so much cancer he
[11:39] wasn't sure that he got it all to say
[11:41] the doctor's note said
[11:43] your recent bladder biopsy showed no
[11:45] evidence of cancer and is normal
[11:48] so
[11:50] [Applause]
[11:56] okay
[12:16] he's good
[12:20] when you feel weakest
[12:24] dangerous around
[12:28] subtle Temptations

[29:52] amen tonight
[29:54] happy to be here in the house of the
[29:56] Lord
[29:58] and
[30:00] man thank you amen for all that worship
[30:03] that was wonderful
[30:05] second Kings chapter 2 verse 4 we'll
[30:07] just begin reading I would like to just
[30:08] minister to you tonight if the Lord
[30:10] would help me on anointed by the
[30:13] Supernatural Part Two this will be part
[30:16] two of where we left off last time
[30:19] Elijah said unto and Elijah said unto
[30:23] him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for
[30:26] the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he
[30:29] said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[30:32] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[30:35] came to Jericho we can skip some of this
[30:37] all the way down to verse six Elijah
[30:40] said unto him again
[30:42] Terry I pray thee here for the Lord hath
[30:45] sent me to Jordan and he said as the
[30:48] Lord liveth and has thy soul liveth I
[30:51] will not leave thee and they too went on
[30:55] verse 9. let's just begin actually just
[30:58] reading the verse 8 we'll read a few
[30:59] more Elijah took his mantle and wrapped
[31:02] it together and smote the waters and
[31:04] they were divided hither and thither so
[31:06] that they too went over on dry ground
[31:08] and it came to pass when they were gone
[31:11] over that Elijah said unto Elisha asked
[31:14] what I shall do for thee in other words
[31:16] whatever you want is what's going to be
[31:19] granted much like brother Branham Mass
[31:21] sister Hattie
[31:22] before I be notice what he says here ask
[31:25] what I shall do for thee before I be
[31:27] taken away from thee and Elisha said I
[31:30] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[31:33] Spirit be upon me
[31:36] and he said thou has asked a hard thing
[31:38] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[31:42] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[31:45] but if not it shall not be so
[31:49] and it came to pass as they went on and
[31:52] talked that behold there appeared a
[31:53] chariot of fire and Horses of fire and
[31:57] parted them both asunder and Elisha went
[32:00] up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha
[32:03] saw it and cried my father my father the
[32:06] Chariots of Israel and the horsemen
[32:08] thereof and he saw him no more
[32:13] that's important
[32:15] and he saw him no more
[32:18] and this means that that promise that
[32:20] Elijah had promised him was going to
[32:21] come to pass he said if you don't see me
[32:24] if you see me no more it shall be unto
[32:26] thee and if not it won't
[32:28] and he says here in in verse uh find my
[32:32] place again in verse 12. and Elijah saw
[32:34] it cried father my father saw him no
[32:36] more and he took hold of his own of his
[32:38] own clothes and rent them in two pieces
[32:40] he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[32:44] that fell from him and went back and
[32:48] stood by the bank of Jordan and he took
[32:51] the mantle of Elijah that fell from him
[32:53] and smote the water and said where is
[32:56] the Lord God of Elijah and when he had
[32:59] all had and when he also had Smit in the
[33:02] waters they parted hither and thither
[33:04] and Elisha went over lord we're so
[33:07] grateful to be here Lord in your house
[33:09] Lord now we've all not one of us are
[33:11] here Lord without some need Upon Our
[33:13] Heart Lord some prayer father maybe that
[33:17] we're praying we're all standing in need
[33:18] of you me Lord as the minister here
[33:21] tonight along with these people how we
[33:23] need you Lord God to come and speak to
[33:25] us Lord and break the bread of life to
[33:27] your children would you come now Lord
[33:29] and give us the words of life that
[33:31] you've intended for our church here God
[33:34] on this Wednesday night service Lord I
[33:36] just give you full control now Lord as I
[33:39] Just Surrender my vessel and my self
[33:42] even all my notes Lord and everything
[33:44] that I've prepared Lord and labored for
[33:46] and dwelled on and throughout the day
[33:49] Lord I Lord I'm laying those now and I'm
[33:51] just bringing them to your feet and
[33:53] saying Lord if if you change me on
[33:55] anything Lord let me be uh Lord just a
[33:58] microphone that you could speak through
[34:00] to your children Lord I pray God you
[34:02] take complete control and Authority now
[34:04] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:07] amen you can be seated
[34:10] it's amazing when you study this book of
[34:12] Kings
[34:13] and we don't have really a lot of time
[34:16] to get to
[34:18] um to really give a good lesson on this
[34:20] book of Kings here tonight but I think
[34:22] it's important
[34:24] that this is where our story of Elijah
[34:26] and Elisha comes from and I almost
[34:29] titled this sermon the transfer of
[34:33] anointing and you understand that here
[34:36] in a moment that's really what's on my
[34:38] heart here tonight my burden that I'll
[34:39] come back to
[34:41] is the transfer of the anointing and you
[34:45] can see why when you read the story of
[34:48] Elijah thank you brother Matthew and
[34:50] Elisha that it was a transfer of an
[34:53] anointing that was coming from Elijah
[34:56] that would come on to Elisha it's
[34:59] incredible when you parallel the two
[35:01] lives and the anointing that he's asking
[35:03] for when he says give me a double
[35:05] portion if you look through the Hebrew
[35:08] Jewish historians who show you what it
[35:12] actually means when you ask for a double
[35:14] portion he was asking for the
[35:17] inheritance of this man so in other
[35:20] words what Elijah has has his ministry
[35:24] his inheritance Elijah's Elisha's asking
[35:27] let that same inheritance and anointing
[35:31] come upon my Ministry come upon my life
[35:34] and you find this at an interesting time
[35:37] in the book of Kings when they are in
[35:39] you we we can take just a few minutes
[35:41] just to lay some groundwork here but
[35:44] you'll find this history of these men
[35:47] whether it was a good man or a bad man
[35:49] you can go all the way through the book
[35:51] of Kings especially First Kings and the
[35:54] writer would begin to list if it was a
[35:56] man who was good and it was a man who
[35:58] was evil and it was it was a history you
[36:01] know it's incredible that the entire
[36:03] Bible is the history of the nation not
[36:07] of the entire world it's a history book
[36:09] you don't find the history of China in
[36:12] the Bible you don't find the history of
[36:15] America
[36:16] in the Bible you don't find the history
[36:18] of Europe in the Bible you find the
[36:21] history of one people and one nation
[36:24] because it would be this one elected
[36:27] group that would be the most important
[36:30] to God
[36:32] and so you notice this here when he
[36:34] begins to list this King whether he was
[36:37] a ruler and he ruled uh as a good King
[36:40] he did that which was right or he did
[36:43] that which was evil and there was one
[36:46] measuring line one metric that you could
[36:49] use if the man was good or if he was
[36:52] evil was he like David or not
[36:56] he only had one metric he either walked
[36:58] like David or he didn't and if you walk
[37:01] like David like the early days of David
[37:03] then you were a good King if you didn't
[37:06] live like David you were not a good King
[37:08] you were an evil king and the Bible
[37:10] begins to list this and it's incredible
[37:12] when I studied this just this afternoon
[37:14] that in the Hebrew Bible you have your
[37:17] English Bible here and you open your
[37:19] Bible to the book of kings and you have
[37:21] First Kings and second Kings and what's
[37:23] amazing is that in the Hebrew Bible it's
[37:26] not called Kings but it's actually
[37:28] called the kingdoms
[37:32] and so he uses this word the kingdoms
[37:35] though we talk about the Kings who ruled
[37:37] the kingdoms it's amazing that it's
[37:39] actually called the kingdoms of Israel
[37:43] because they were going to be led by
[37:46] Kings but in the in this book it's
[37:49] actually called the kingdoms of Israel
[37:51] not the Kings it's an interesting just
[37:54] to note just enough that in English a
[37:57] kingdom means a piece of land that's how
[37:59] you relate to the word Kingdom you use
[38:02] this word later and you see it laced
[38:04] throughout the entire Old Testament of
[38:06] Kingdoms all the way to Jesus when he
[38:09] begins to speak about the kingdom of
[38:13] heaven
[38:15] and you'll hear you'll find the the Lord
[38:17] referencing that in Parable after
[38:19] Parable after Parable the kingdom of
[38:23] heaven and if there was going to be a
[38:24] kingdom of heaven there would have to be
[38:26] a king and if there was a kingdom and a
[38:28] king there would have to be a people who
[38:31] were the people of the kingdom and so
[38:33] this is really who Jesus is speaking to
[38:36] the people who were of the kingdoms of
[38:39] the kingdom and the people who were not
[38:41] of the Kingdom this goes all the way
[38:43] through the Book of Revelations speaking
[38:46] about the New Jerusalem it would be a
[38:48] kingdom and there would be a king over
[38:50] that domain and then there would be
[38:52] people who were part of that Kingdom and
[38:54] that domain and it's incredible because
[38:57] what they were on that side in heaven in
[39:01] eternity if they lived in the Kingdom
[39:04] there it was only a representation that
[39:07] they were part of the kingdom here on
[39:10] Earth
[39:10] and if you're a part of the kingdom of
[39:12] God here you're a part of the kingdom of
[39:15] God there and if you're not a part of
[39:17] the kingdom of God here you live on the
[39:19] outside of the Kingdom so what is it
[39:21] representing in that Kingdom there was
[39:23] no sun there was no moon for the Lord
[39:26] was the light of the city what is it
[39:28] representative of that if the Lord is
[39:31] the light of the city there that meant
[39:33] that if you're there he was the light of
[39:36] your city here
[39:39] so you didn't live by the moon or you
[39:41] don't live by the stars or the storm or
[39:43] the uh the cloud or the day or the night
[39:45] but your life as a Believer filled with
[39:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[39:49] representing that you're already living
[39:52] where the lamb is the light
[39:55] it's incredible it goes all the way
[39:57] through this to show that in English and
[39:59] a kingdom would mean but if you have an
[40:01] English to understand and you won't
[40:03] understand what Jesus is meaning when he
[40:05] says the Kingdom of Heaven is likened
[40:07] unto the Kingdom of Heaven is like it
[40:09] unto a man who goes to sow seeds and and
[40:12] he goes and sowed seeds and then after
[40:14] then another man comes beside behind him
[40:16] and and he sows tears right behind those
[40:19] seeds and then the at the the servants
[40:21] come and say Lord should we pick up and
[40:24] pluck up the the tares that have been
[40:26] planted with the wheat and the and the
[40:29] Lord says no let them grow together and
[40:32] at the end the angels will come and do
[40:34] the separate and so all of these all of
[40:37] these examples Jesus gives you can find
[40:40] that it's all part of the plan or the
[40:43] economy that God had in his mind before
[40:47] Adam fell
[40:49] before man was ever cursed God already
[40:52] was moving towards this Kingdom
[40:55] of where you'll be not just servants not
[40:58] just peasants but you'll be Kings and
[41:00] Priests also
[41:03] do you believe that here tonight and so
[41:05] we think of this term of Kingdom as as a
[41:08] as a as a land or a or a piece of
[41:12] property you could say that to us it's
[41:14] like something on a map it's a it's a
[41:17] it's a piece of land or we would say in
[41:19] kings and queen days it was a realm and
[41:23] then that king would be over that realm
[41:25] but it's amazing because in the Hebrew
[41:28] mind a kingdom was not looked at as land
[41:31] or or or or a piece a parcel but it was
[41:36] actually looked at as a Reign rather
[41:39] than a room in other words it was
[41:41] something that was defined in Authority
[41:45] not in terms of area
[41:48] so to the king to the Jewish mind a king
[41:52] was a king not because of how much land
[41:55] he had but by how much Authority he had
[41:58] over that Dominion
[42:01] and so when we talk about the kingdom of
[42:03] God let me just say this we're not
[42:05] talking about a place we're talking
[42:07] about a power
[42:08] hello is somebody with me can you help
[42:10] me preach her tonight when we talk about
[42:12] the kingdom of God we're not just
[42:14] talking about a place somewhere beyond
[42:16] the misty blue we're talking about a
[42:18] power or an authority that Jesus had
[42:22] that has been transferred to his people
[42:26] and so if you say I'm a king I'm a king
[42:29] and a priest it's not about a king over
[42:31] a piece of property it's about an
[42:33] authority that you have over your home
[42:36] over your mind over your body hello
[42:40] that is a Son of God you have an
[42:42] authority that's been transferred from
[42:44] Jesus and he said Greater Works shall
[42:48] you do for I go to my father and until
[42:50] you recognize the authority that's been
[42:53] given to you you'll never run your home
[42:55] like a king you won't run your mind like
[42:57] a king you won't run your family hello
[42:59] somebody but when you realize that power
[43:02] has been given and Authority has been
[43:04] given to you as the Church of God then
[43:07] you won't let the devil run all over you
[43:09] and all over your mind and
[43:11] trespass in your home and trespass in
[43:13] your family and trespass in your body
[43:15] that's why when we pray for someone we
[43:17] say Satan I rebuke you you're a
[43:20] trespasser because this is the kingdom
[43:23] of God and I've been given authority
[43:25] over you
[43:28] Jesus spoke this way and they didn't
[43:30] understand how does he speak he speaks
[43:33] like one who has Authority
[43:36] yet he was so little and humble and so a
[43:39] true Kingdom and a true Kingdom the king
[43:42] is the absolute
[43:45] he's the absolute power
[43:47] and a real Kingdom
[43:49] I'm talking about the United Kingdom
[43:52] the United Kingdom is not United and
[43:54] it's not a kingdom
[43:56] we're talking about the kingdom of God
[43:59] and so in a true Kingdom the King has
[44:03] the absolute power he makes the laws
[44:06] there's no Parliament there's no
[44:08] opposition party there's no Democrats
[44:12] and Republicans there's no votes
[44:15] the king rules
[44:18] and he Rules by decree it's what he
[44:21] speaks
[44:22] that's why uh uh
[44:24] Ezekiel or not not it's not Ezekiel um
[44:27] I'm looking for Ecclesiastes Solomon in
[44:30] the Book of Ecclesiastes Solomon says
[44:32] where the word of a king is there's
[44:36] power
[44:37] so in other words not where the army of
[44:39] the king is it's not by how many nukes
[44:42] you have it's not about how many planes
[44:44] you have but the king it wasn't about
[44:47] his about his wealth it was about how
[44:50] much Authority and power he had
[44:53] and so there's there's no opposition
[44:55] party he spoke by decree there was no
[44:58] debate
[45:01] he makes a law and everybody has got to
[45:04] come in line under that law
[45:06] now I ask you a question here good old
[45:08] uh United States of American citizens
[45:10] would you like a king
[45:14] would you like a king
[45:16] where we have not a president not a
[45:18] parliament and not a not a not a a
[45:20] senate not a house of Congress but we
[45:24] have just a king and there's no votes he
[45:26] rules and some of you are thinking whoa
[45:28] where's this go
[45:31] would you like it King well let me tell
[45:33] let me ask you what if I can find a king
[45:35] who's absolutely just in everything he
[45:39] does what if I told you about a king who
[45:42] was so great he would lay his own life
[45:45] down for his people he would see that
[45:49] there were no poor in his kingdom there
[45:51] were no sick in his kingdom there were
[45:53] no one that was uncared for there was no
[45:56] outcast in his kingdom but everybody
[45:58] would eat at the king's table now do you
[46:00] want a king
[46:01] what about a king who had a kingdom
[46:04] where there was no fear there was no son
[46:06] there was no stress there was no worry
[46:09] you see the the key you see you say
[46:12] brother Matt what is the kingdom the
[46:13] kingdom depends on who's the king of the
[46:15] kingdom and let me just tell you there's
[46:17] a people who are ready to Crown King
[46:19] Jesus and say that's the king I'll take
[46:22] for my life who makes the law he Rules
[46:25] by his word and I'll obey that word
[46:30] so the kingdom
[46:32] depends entirely on the character of The
[46:37] King
[46:39] so you need to understand from the
[46:41] Hebrew title these books uh is the
[46:43] Kingdom of Israel and the kingdom was
[46:46] the rule of a man and his kingdom ceased
[46:49] when he ceased his kingdom was over when
[46:52] he when he died and then another kingdom
[46:54] again and Kings begins to record
[46:57] this so we talk about the Kingdom of
[47:00] Israel or the kingdoms of Israel and he
[47:04] would begin to list the care the conduct
[47:07] and the character and really it was the
[47:11] king's conduct and character that
[47:14] determined the fate of the entire nation
[47:20] isn't it incredible that before Kings
[47:23] for a thousand years before their ruled
[47:26] their first ruled by Patriarchs and then
[47:28] they're ruled by prophets and then
[47:30] they're ruled by Kings by priests
[47:34] but did you really do you do you do you
[47:36] do you realize that before Kings God
[47:38] would always talk about the people and
[47:41] whether it was a good thing he had to
[47:42] say about the people or or a bad thing
[47:44] to say about the people but when kings
[47:46] came along God refers to the evil King
[47:49] or the good King
[47:51] because it was presumed that however
[47:54] that whoever the King was whenever the
[47:56] character of the King was would identify
[47:59] the character of the people
[48:01] that's why Ahab being a king was
[48:04] representative of the evil heart of all
[48:07] of Israel
[48:09] as we said here before Ahab didn't it
[48:11] wasn't just bad luck that a bad King got
[48:13] in but Ahab was literally the
[48:16] representation of their heart
[48:20] [Music]
[48:21] and so it was important what his
[48:25] character was it decided the fate of the
[48:27] nation and so until Israel had the Kings
[48:30] uh I mean this move through some of this
[48:32] so don't get too bogged down here
[48:34] tonight
[48:35] so you could assume that what the king
[48:38] did everybody else would do they would
[48:41] follow him and what he would say and how
[48:44] he would live and how he would act and
[48:46] how he would react don't you see that
[48:48] that transcends that brother Brandon
[48:50] would even come to a church and say this
[48:52] the pastor depended on the pastor of the
[48:55] church the people if they're not careful
[48:57] they take on the spirit of the pastor
[48:58] that can be a good thing or that could
[49:00] be a bad thing say let's get off the
[49:02] pastor okay let's move to fathers do you
[49:05] realize that the character of the father
[49:07] would be representative to the character
[49:10] of the rest of the family that whatever
[49:12] the conduct of the of the man was the
[49:15] leader this is how God designed the
[49:18] family this is how he designed the home
[49:21] it's how he designed his kingdoms
[49:23] however the husband was whatever his
[49:26] character was it would ultimately be a
[49:28] reflection his family would be a
[49:31] reflection of what was on the inside of
[49:33] him
[49:36] watch the man here just a few years ago
[49:40] and I was with another pastor and we
[49:42] were going to a tour a tourist spot
[49:44] where I was preaching and there's a late
[49:46] young lady there in front of us and a
[49:47] man and she just you couldn't even
[49:49] hardly look she was uh uh just hardly
[49:52] had nothing on I mean the just every
[49:55] part of her showing to the entire world
[49:57] as they walked and I watched that man
[49:59] who was walking beside her and me and
[50:01] the pastor just began to talk and I
[50:03] thought here this is his wife
[50:05] and I thought it's incredible because I
[50:08] can't look into the heart of that man or
[50:11] see what's in his mind I don't have that
[50:12] power but all I've got to look at is the
[50:15] woman he chose and it will reveal to you
[50:18] everything that's in his heart
[50:25] Lord I don't know where you have me but
[50:26] I'm going to keep going
[50:32] for whatever his case it's a good king
[50:34] or bad King it's a good King they they
[50:35] followed the king and and they lived in
[50:38] peace if he was a bad King they lived in
[50:40] war and so in the book of Kings the
[50:43] emphasis is on the king it's on the
[50:46] ruler what he did and whether he was
[50:47] good as we said they measured it by by
[50:49] David if he was like David and and so
[50:52] David becomes the metric by which every
[50:54] king of Israel is judged and so and so
[50:59] we go on through this and and let me
[51:01] just let me just find my place here and
[51:04] so what would happen is is that it's
[51:07] it's so interesting because this isn't
[51:10] as you look through these examples there
[51:12] was a man called Omri and and you can
[51:15] read about Omri historically for Israel
[51:18] and he was politically one of the most
[51:22] successful Kings over Israel
[51:26] and politically he brought he brought
[51:29] more they got more gains under Armory
[51:32] than I think it was the the accumulation
[51:35] of six Kings before him
[51:37] and so he was a man who had an
[51:40] outstanding reign as a king you could
[51:42] say his his resume was Flawless he was
[51:47] he broke wealth as far as economically
[51:50] goes they they more soared and had a
[51:54] better economy under Armory because he
[51:56] was a genius under Armory than any other
[51:58] king he lifted the Armory lifts them
[52:01] economically out of poverty and it had a
[52:04] tremendous success but what's so amazing
[52:07] is in the book of Kings there's seven
[52:10] verses written about him and then he's
[52:12] dismissed
[52:15] what does it tell you that to God
[52:18] because why if you read the Kings and
[52:19] said eek Armory did that which was evil
[52:21] and the sight of God so what was it
[52:24] showing you about God's perspective
[52:26] whatever he did in wealth whatever he
[52:28] did economically meant nothing to God it
[52:32] meant Zero to God he said almost nothing
[52:36] about Armory and dismissed him off
[52:37] because he was evil so in God's
[52:40] perspective it doesn't matter what you
[52:42] do in this Earthly life how successful
[52:45] you are what you build up economically
[52:47] or politically to in God's mind it only
[52:50] matters what you're sowing into the
[52:53] kingdom of God I just read that and said
[52:55] Lord let my life be a life that's
[52:57] representative not of great success
[53:00] around me but let me live like David let
[53:02] me have a heart like David Lord
[53:05] let me be looked at as successful in
[53:09] your eyes Lord
[53:12] so we when you come all
[53:15] through all of this uh all of these
[53:17] achievements of all of these men who did
[53:19] Evil and God brings them all the way
[53:21] through the history all the way to this
[53:24] time to where the Kingdom's divided
[53:26] under Solomon and now you have these two
[53:28] prophets who come on the scene Elijah
[53:31] and Elisha Second Kings is incredible
[53:33] turn there with you with me in your
[53:35] Bible if you could we're going to take a
[53:37] turn here
[53:38] notice here in Second Kings where we've
[53:40] read from and we're just going to read
[53:42] just a few more verses out of here where
[53:45] we where we picked up before we had to
[53:47] be seated I want you to notice here in
[53:50] Second Kings
[53:51] chapter 2. this is the story of Elijah
[53:55] and the ministry of Elijah
[53:58] and Elisha
[54:00] and it's incredible because Elijah you
[54:04] could imagine Elisha was just so
[54:07] enamored by the ministry of Elijah just
[54:11] to be a have a front row seat
[54:14] to Carmel Mount Carmel and to see the
[54:18] just the spectacular anointing that
[54:21] Elijah operates under
[54:22] and the the the supernatural that
[54:25] accompanies the ministry and the
[54:27] Miracles that that happened through the
[54:30] life of Elijah he sees him you know you
[54:33] can you can go through the Miracles and
[54:35] and show the supernatural that was done
[54:38] in the life of Elijah and then
[54:40] transferred on to Elijah look at verse
[54:42] one and it came to pass when the Lord
[54:44] would take up Elijah into Heaven by a
[54:46] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah
[54:49] from gilgal Elijah said unto Elisha Tara
[54:53] here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent
[54:56] me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as
[54:59] the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I
[55:03] will not leave thee so they went down to
[55:07] Bethel
[55:10] you go all the way through this entire
[55:12] story I'm going to slow down just here
[55:13] for a moment
[55:15] and you come all the way through the
[55:17] Earthly Ministry of this man
[55:20] and God is totally lined you that he's
[55:22] going to take him home and that his
[55:24] ministry is over and and now there's
[55:27] this journey that Elijah brings to serve
[55:31] and Elisha through and they go to two
[55:33] cities Bethel and Jericho and it's
[55:36] incredible because in both of these
[55:38] cities
[55:39] God had done miraculous things through
[55:42] Elijah's Ministry and in the times of
[55:45] Elijah these cities both of them are
[55:48] serving the lord they're both you would
[55:50] say on fire for God but now that
[55:54] Elijah's Ministry is going off and
[55:57] fading off the sin of Elisha's coming on
[55:59] the scene now Bethel has backslidden
[56:02] it's at a very different place than when
[56:04] Elijah was in the full swing of his
[56:06] ministry and they're backslidden Jericho
[56:10] you'll find is the same exact way to
[56:12] where the people has turned their hearts
[56:14] from God they were dry and and Barren
[56:17] and and dead you could say that they
[56:19] were it was a dryness and a deadness
[56:21] that had came over this this city of
[56:24] Jericho and so he goes over and he's
[56:28] across the Jordan River and we know the
[56:31] story that a chariot is going to come
[56:33] down
[56:34] from heaven and it's going to pick up
[56:36] Elijah and it's going to translate him
[56:39] from this Dimension into another
[56:42] dimension and Elisha is going to witness
[56:45] all this he's going to see the the the
[56:47] the the the the the the
[56:49] crescendo you would call it the capping
[56:52] of Elijah's Ministry and he watches all
[56:55] the way through his entire life and all
[56:57] the Miracles and then he this old
[57:00] Prophet you would say this this man
[57:02] who's now at the end of his journey
[57:04] brings Elisha this young prophet and he
[57:08] brings him to his here's his last day on
[57:11] Earth here's the here's his last
[57:14] few hours the last day then it turns
[57:17] into the last hours he has to be in this
[57:20] Dimension the last few moments I got
[57:22] this to thinking of this over the last
[57:24] week and week and a half that it's
[57:26] incredible when you start looking at
[57:28] some of the last words this is some of
[57:32] the last thoughts that Elijah is going
[57:35] to speak and utter out of all of the
[57:37] mighty powerful things Elijah's voice
[57:39] has been used to say and now here he's
[57:42] coming to his last words what's the last
[57:45] things on his heart what's the last
[57:48] thing in his mind before he leaves this
[57:51] world and he goes into the other world
[57:54] and it's incredible you can read this
[57:56] about David and as David on his deathbed
[57:59] and and he begins to speak about his
[58:01] last words and then you can read about
[58:03] Solomon and the Bible records these last
[58:06] words the last few things that they had
[58:09] to say
[58:11] and he he decides Elijah to bring him
[58:14] through these two towns Bethel
[58:16] and Jericho and he tells Elijah to to
[58:19] come with him and so the Bible picks it
[58:21] up here and they carry together and he
[58:24] comes to this city and he visits both
[58:26] towns and and and and he gets to the
[58:29] bank of the River Jordan after all the
[58:31] all of this journey and Elijah takes off
[58:34] his mantle and and and and and here's a
[58:37] here's a here's a mantle which is just
[58:39] like a loose-fitting garment that he has
[58:41] over him you can imagine what it would
[58:43] look like or what it would be use your
[58:45] imagination but you have this long maybe
[58:47] robe flowing down and here here's Elijah
[58:51] and this this mantle is going to
[58:53] represent his anointing it's going to
[58:56] represent something to Elisha because
[58:58] it's what Elisha uses on the Jordan
[59:01] River just a few verses later so in this
[59:04] mantle you could say though the cloth or
[59:06] the the clothes the fabric had nothing
[59:10] really unearthly about it it was very
[59:12] much like any other piece of garment
[59:15] but it wasn't the guard it wasn't the
[59:17] fabric or how it was stitched or how it
[59:19] was sewed but it was The Inheritance or
[59:23] the blessings that God had saturated
[59:27] this mantle with in Elijah's life
[59:29] it was representative of an anointing
[59:32] that it had came upon the ministry of
[59:35] Elijah and you you we we we know as we
[59:39] spoke on last time that that word that
[59:41] anointing it's it's representative of
[59:44] something it's not like the charismatic
[59:46] would use the word anointing and and
[59:48] then people you know feel a shake or a
[59:51] shiver but an anointing what in the
[59:54] Bible meant a smearing that's so
[59:56] important when you look at this and then
[59:58] a smearing it was they would take olive
[1:00:01] oil and they would smear it or they
[1:00:03] would rub it rub it and and what was it
[1:00:06] doing it was anointing or it was placing
[1:00:11] or transferring
[1:00:13] something that was Supernatural
[1:00:16] to a vessel that was very natural
[1:00:20] and so it was transferring a blessing or
[1:00:23] transferring a promise this is father's
[1:00:25] Patriarchs would do this you find it
[1:00:28] with Jacob and and Esau and with their
[1:00:30] father it was a transfer the birthright
[1:00:32] it was an anointing it was it was an
[1:00:34] inheritance it was it was something that
[1:00:37] they were they were taking from one uh
[1:00:41] place and placing it on someone else
[1:00:44] brother Brandon picks this up here and
[1:00:46] I'm just going to pause just for a
[1:00:47] moment to read this brother Mark if you
[1:00:49] just display that PowerPoint and have it
[1:00:50] just for the rest of the time would be
[1:00:52] good and then brother Brandon begins to
[1:00:54] pick this up and he says may the Holy
[1:00:56] Spirit teach us and why Christ speak
[1:00:58] that the things we ought to know that we
[1:01:00] may and then in return listen closely to
[1:01:03] every word weigh it deeply and then may
[1:01:06] those who are listening by the way of
[1:01:08] tape may they listen close and may we be
[1:01:11] able to catch what the holy spirit is
[1:01:13] trying to reveal for we realize if he
[1:01:17] should anoint us
[1:01:18] then the anointing is not in vain it's
[1:01:22] for a purpose that it might work to the
[1:01:26] good to the Lord so that anointing was
[1:01:29] for a purpose he anointed him for a
[1:01:32] reason and let me just let me let me go
[1:01:34] a little bit further so your mind gets
[1:01:36] with my mind here when I say the
[1:01:38] anointing was for a purpose what I'm
[1:01:40] meaning is is that there was a purpose
[1:01:42] that was on the anointing and what was
[1:01:46] important is that not just that the oil
[1:01:49] that you would get oily
[1:01:51] it wasn't just that you would feel a
[1:01:53] sensation I hope you catch this here
[1:01:55] when I'm preaching it wasn't just for a
[1:01:57] sensation or for something that was
[1:02:00] bright and shiny but there was a purpose
[1:02:02] that God had placed on the anointing and
[1:02:06] when you receive the anointing the per
[1:02:08] the the point was that that purpose was
[1:02:12] transferred unto you
[1:02:16] that's why we anoint someone when we
[1:02:18] come up for prayer in the Book of James
[1:02:20] tells us to to anoint those with oil
[1:02:23] those that are sick let the Elders of
[1:02:26] the church anoint them with oil it's not
[1:02:29] that the oil itself has any special
[1:02:31] magic power or potion but there's a
[1:02:34] purpose
[1:02:35] in the scripture of a promise that Jesus
[1:02:39] gave and so we represent that purpose in
[1:02:44] that oil so that when we put it on your
[1:02:46] head that promise that Jesus gave is
[1:02:50] transferred from the Bible into your
[1:02:53] body
[1:02:58] we could use that about any any of the
[1:03:00] promises of God the point of the purpose
[1:03:02] is that there was a transfer of that
[1:03:05] promise that Jesus gave
[1:03:07] to come upon you
[1:03:10] so that anointing that he was sending
[1:03:13] from Elijah to Elisha was that there
[1:03:16] would be a transfer of the purpose that
[1:03:19] God had placed in Elijah the purpose
[1:03:22] that he had sent Elijah far behold I
[1:03:24] sinned unto you Elijah the prophet and
[1:03:28] here's the purpose that he would turn
[1:03:30] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:03:33] children and the children to the fathers
[1:03:36] so when brother Branham receives that
[1:03:38] anointing of Elijah it isn't just so he
[1:03:41] can do Supernatural Miracles it isn't
[1:03:43] just so that he could speak squirrels
[1:03:46] into existence it's so that the purpose
[1:03:49] that was in God's mind would be
[1:03:52] transferred unto the prophet and the
[1:03:54] prophet would fulfill brother random
[1:03:56] would fulfill literally
[1:03:58] but it wasn't his message
[1:04:03] that's where brother random said it
[1:04:04] wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio
[1:04:06] River I was only standing there when he
[1:04:09] showed up
[1:04:11] and so what was his ministry it was the
[1:04:13] purpose of the anointing that was on
[1:04:15] Elijah and then moved to Elisha and then
[1:04:18] moved to John the Baptist
[1:04:21] and that that Ministry or that anointing
[1:04:23] would come upon and be transferred to
[1:04:25] brother Branham so his anointing was not
[1:04:28] his own anointing it wasn't an emotion
[1:04:31] it wasn't a sensation it was something
[1:04:33] from the mind of God when he placed it
[1:04:35] in the first man Elijah the tishbite
[1:04:40] and that same anointing would be passed
[1:04:42] on from Elijah to Elijah to John the
[1:04:45] Baptist all the way to brother bran
[1:04:48] and so when you hear the ministry of the
[1:04:50] tape and you're hearing what brother
[1:04:52] random saying on tape you're hearing the
[1:04:54] anointing of Elijah and that's important
[1:04:58] because it didn't rest on any other man
[1:05:00] you couldn't get that from Benny Hinn
[1:05:02] you couldn't get that from Oral Roberts
[1:05:05] you couldn't get that from Billy Graham
[1:05:08] they had an anointing and that anointing
[1:05:10] was to transfer to a certain people but
[1:05:13] when you're hearing I remind you you're
[1:05:16] hearing the anointing that was
[1:05:17] specifically sent for one group of
[1:05:21] people it wasn't for the whole world not
[1:05:24] the whole world can hear it they can't
[1:05:25] receive the anointing but when you hear
[1:05:28] that Prophet speak it speaks to you more
[1:05:30] than just a language or a story but it's
[1:05:33] an anointing that comes from the tape
[1:05:35] and it goes on to the seed and there's a
[1:05:38] transfer of that promise to the bride
[1:05:41] out over here
[1:05:43] and so brother William says if he's
[1:05:44] going to anoint us we know it's for a
[1:05:46] purpose what was it representative of
[1:05:48] that anointing that would flow David
[1:05:50] speaks of it in Psalms 133 how precious
[1:05:53] it is for Brethren to dwell how
[1:05:55] beautiful it is for Brethren to dwell
[1:05:57] together in unity it's like the
[1:06:00] anointing that flowed from Aaron's head
[1:06:05] down to his beard
[1:06:07] from his beard onto the urum thummem
[1:06:12] and from the eurom Thurmond the thumb
[1:06:14] down onto his skirts and from his skirts
[1:06:17] all the way you say brother Matt why is
[1:06:19] that important because on that urum was
[1:06:21] all of the representation of all of
[1:06:24] Israel of the topaz and the carbuncle
[1:06:27] and the and the jasper stone and the
[1:06:29] Sardis what were all those stones
[1:06:30] representative those brother Brandon
[1:06:32] says those mothers when they gave birth
[1:06:34] he said there was an anointing that Came
[1:06:36] Upon that mother and she would call out
[1:06:39] the name of that child what was it going
[1:06:41] to do the prophet said because there
[1:06:43] were to be an anointing that was upon
[1:06:45] the life of a Simeon that wasn't on the
[1:06:48] life of Benjamin that's why brother
[1:06:50] random says it's important what sign
[1:06:52] you're born under in Earth it's
[1:06:54] representative of an anointing or
[1:06:57] something that God has placed in you
[1:06:59] before you ever breathed your first
[1:07:01] breath there's an anointing he's given
[1:07:03] you there's a purpose
[1:07:07] that he has for your life
[1:07:09] and so on that urum it would represent
[1:07:12] all of the 12 tribes
[1:07:15] and so when that anointing came on Aaron
[1:07:18] who was who the high priest it didn't
[1:07:21] just stay bottled up on Aaron's head but
[1:07:25] it had to be transferred from his head
[1:07:28] to his beard to all of Israel
[1:07:34] and now that same anointing that was on
[1:07:36] Aaron Came Upon the entire nation
[1:07:40] what was it representing brother Matt
[1:07:42] that God did not intend to bottle up all
[1:07:46] of the authority of Jesus into brother
[1:07:49] Branham it would have to move from
[1:07:52] Brother Branham to the priest and let me
[1:07:54] just say this message is not a Revival
[1:07:57] of just brother Branham it's not just a
[1:07:59] Revival of what God did through in the
[1:08:02] in the life and Ministry of William
[1:08:04] Branham that's wonderful there was an
[1:08:06] anointing but that anointing moved from
[1:08:08] a prophet and it had to be transferred
[1:08:11] to a people
[1:08:15] and let me go further this message this
[1:08:18] anointing this revival is not just a
[1:08:20] Revival of preachers it's not just a
[1:08:22] Revival of ministers but it's got to
[1:08:25] move from the prophet to the preachers
[1:08:27] to the people
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:31] and you receive the anointed word
[1:08:34] brother random I heard him say that
[1:08:36] today and who do you say this is he says
[1:08:38] what is a messiah it's the anointed you
[1:08:41] become
[1:08:42] the anointed word
[1:08:56] we're going to go through some of this
[1:08:57] let's just go just a little bit further
[1:09:00] listen to what brother random says here
[1:09:02] and I want to go to slide eight if I
[1:09:04] have control do I have that up here the
[1:09:06] clicker up here somewhere
[1:09:08] looks like I don't you'll just have to
[1:09:10] go to slide eight that's fine notice
[1:09:12] what brother Brandon says here and why
[1:09:13] Christ speak just as we know now as a
[1:09:16] man asked me a few moments ago about the
[1:09:18] coming in the rapture we know we've
[1:09:20] lived the time out at the time of the
[1:09:23] and he says and the time of the Rapture
[1:09:25] is at hand you believe that
[1:09:29] so brother I was talking about
[1:09:30] supernatural strength he's talking about
[1:09:32] Moses in this message and he says we've
[1:09:34] lived the time out can someone bring me
[1:09:36] that clicker if you have it if the
[1:09:37] PowerPoint remotes back there if someone
[1:09:39] could bring it that'd be wonderful
[1:09:41] notice here he says we've lived the time
[1:09:43] out
[1:09:44] at the time and he says and the time of
[1:09:46] the Rapture is at hand and where notice
[1:09:50] not just inclusive to him not just
[1:09:54] inclusive to us but just as you're
[1:09:56] looking for Rapture and Faith God's
[1:09:59] Prophet was also looking for Rapture and
[1:10:01] faith
[1:10:01] we're looking for a Rapture in faith
[1:10:10] it's not working that's fine that's
[1:10:12] right you can control over the mark
[1:10:14] and he says that can pull the church
[1:10:16] together and give it some Supernatural
[1:10:20] strength
[1:10:22] that can change these bodies that we
[1:10:25] live in when we see a God that can raise
[1:10:28] the dead so what's he saying there's got
[1:10:30] to come an anointing
[1:10:33] they got to come and anointing because
[1:10:35] with an anointing comes a purpose and
[1:10:37] because there's a promise there's a
[1:10:39] purpose what is the promise we shall not
[1:10:42] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[1:10:44] the moment and the twinkling of an eye
[1:10:47] so that was the promise which gave us
[1:10:49] the purpose but there's got to be a
[1:10:51] people who can be Anointed with that
[1:10:53] scripture
[1:10:57] listen the entire Bible there's
[1:10:58] scriptures that were written in here
[1:11:00] that aren't about you and have nothing
[1:11:01] to do with you
[1:11:03] when it talks about the foolish virgin
[1:11:05] it ain't got nothing to do about you
[1:11:08] when it talks about the sons and
[1:11:10] children of Disobedience I don't find my
[1:11:12] place in the Bible there
[1:11:13] are people who are fulfilling Luca do
[1:11:16] Revelations 3 of the church that kicks
[1:11:18] Jesus out of his own church there's a
[1:11:21] church that's lukewarm in Lydia Sia
[1:11:23] who's cold and starchy and indifferent
[1:11:25] intellectually minded and don't have any
[1:11:28] of the spirit of God let me just say
[1:11:30] that's not your anointing that's not
[1:11:34] your promise that's not your scripture
[1:11:36] but there was something written about me
[1:11:38] that said he that to him that overcometh
[1:11:42] shall I grant to sit with me on my
[1:11:44] throne even as I overcame and sat down
[1:11:46] with my father on his throne
[1:11:49] there's there's a there's a promise here
[1:11:51] notice he says a rapturing faith and he
[1:11:54] said they can give it some Supernatural
[1:11:56] strength that can change these bodies
[1:11:59] that we live in when we see a God that
[1:12:03] can raise the dead off the floor or out
[1:12:07] of the yard and bring him back to life
[1:12:10] again and present him before us when we
[1:12:14] see a God who can take a cancer that eat
[1:12:18] a man to a shadow
[1:12:21] and raise him up to a strong healthy man
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] that ought to make us rejoice
[1:12:34] that ought to bring excitement
[1:12:36] that ought to bring Revival
[1:12:38] that ought to brings Supernatural
[1:12:40] strength but listen to what brother
[1:12:41] random says it ought to do that ought to
[1:12:44] give rapturing faith
[1:12:46] to the people
[1:12:49] what
[1:12:51] ought to give
[1:12:53] I was reading the countdown this at this
[1:12:55] evening before coming out here and
[1:12:57] brother random comes to the end of that
[1:12:58] message and he says Lord
[1:13:00] I pray that you create a crave
[1:13:05] in those people and I thought about that
[1:13:08] I said yes Lord
[1:13:10] if I don't have the right crave I think
[1:13:13] that I do
[1:13:15] I crave for the Lord I crave for his
[1:13:17] word but I just want to stop and say
[1:13:19] Lord if I don't have the right craving
[1:13:21] then put it inside me
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:25] oh that's so simple but I just want to
[1:13:27] ask you is that your desire to say Lord
[1:13:29] he says Let It Be A crave
[1:13:32] and he says Christ will be so real
[1:13:37] in their bodies
[1:13:40] until he can change their body
[1:13:43] I am more convinced than ever before it
[1:13:47] is the same power that heals your body
[1:13:49] of disease is the same power that will
[1:13:53] change your body one day Christ will be
[1:13:57] so real in their bodies
[1:14:00] say what does that mean we ought to have
[1:14:02] faith to believe God can heal you if
[1:14:04] you're sick he can heal you if you're
[1:14:06] depressed he can deliver you if you're
[1:14:09] addicted come on do I got a church that
[1:14:10] believes that we still believe in the
[1:14:13] transforming power that God can take a
[1:14:16] man from the nothing from nothing from
[1:14:18] the uttermost the gutter most and can
[1:14:20] lift him up out of the Mirey clay
[1:14:24] brother Madam said that ought to give us
[1:14:26] rapturing Faith to the people I put
[1:14:28] these photos to the next slide just to
[1:14:30] think here just in our own assembly here
[1:14:33] it was a man with a tumor on his neck
[1:14:35] the size of a grapefruit then me and
[1:14:38] brother Travis went in his living room
[1:14:39] and witness this is just months ago go
[1:14:41] to the next one brother Mark here he is
[1:14:43] with a tumor ate up in his body
[1:14:46] further than that go on further than
[1:14:49] that it goes from that large black mass
[1:14:51] you see of that tumor spread to his
[1:14:53] entire body and it's eating up his
[1:14:56] entire body and he's told he's going to
[1:14:58] die
[1:15:01] but there's an anointing
[1:15:03] Upon A promise and there was a promise
[1:15:06] made oh come on somebody there was a
[1:15:09] promise made and somebody believed that
[1:15:12] promise
[1:15:14] and somebody accepted that promise and
[1:15:18] that promise was transferred from
[1:15:21] Jesus's word to Ink on paper to a person
[1:15:25] reading it to a heart that believes it
[1:15:27] and a faith that's anointed what does it
[1:15:30] do it transfers and you shall lay your
[1:15:33] hands upon the sick and they shall
[1:15:36] recover
[1:15:37] you shall say to this mountain be thou
[1:15:40] removed and cast into the sea and don't
[1:15:42] doubt in your heart and you shall have
[1:15:44] what you ask for what is that proof of
[1:15:47] there's no cancer in his body
[1:15:49] the only dark spot is his heart and his
[1:15:51] lungs and his organs why President says
[1:15:55] that ought to give you rapturing faith
[1:15:58] that if God could heal a man of cancer
[1:16:00] God can change your mother your vile
[1:16:03] body into a body that is unliken unto
[1:16:06] his with no sickness and no depression
[1:16:09] and no anxiety and no nothing whatever
[1:16:11] you need in this life the prophet of God
[1:16:14] said is already inside of the seed
[1:16:16] that's laying down inside of you all it
[1:16:19] takes is a Believer to believe that
[1:16:21] promise and to say I believe everything
[1:16:23] I need in this life is already in the
[1:16:27] seed
[1:16:28] oh don't you realize friends when a
[1:16:30] preacher's preaching to you he's not
[1:16:32] there to give you something new he's not
[1:16:34] there to put something inside of you
[1:16:36] he's stirring what's already down on the
[1:16:39] seed and when I preach the word
[1:16:41] something says amen I believe it Lord I
[1:16:44] accept it what is it it's not something
[1:16:47] from outside of you it's down on inside
[1:16:49] of the seed God placed in you
[1:16:53] and you can accept it you say what does
[1:16:56] that mean you can ask for anything
[1:16:58] that's according to his word and that
[1:17:01] promise transfers from the Bible to your
[1:17:04] life
[1:17:08] Hallelujah
[1:17:09] I'll give the Lord Jesus a handclap of
[1:17:11] Praise he's worthy of it
[1:17:15] Hallelujah
[1:17:18] you say why did that happen
[1:17:21] to give a little church in Beaufort
[1:17:22] South Carolina faith I pray for Marcus
[1:17:25] that God does more than just a miracle
[1:17:27] in his body but does a miracle in his
[1:17:29] heart
[1:17:29] but even if it never does and he's came
[1:17:31] as far as God has ever made him to come
[1:17:33] then let that Faith be transferred not
[1:17:36] just from a testimony of a man who was
[1:17:38] healed of cancer but I say let it anoint
[1:17:41] our faith here in this church tonight
[1:17:42] let us anoint it let it anoint in our
[1:17:45] let it anoint our faith to ask for
[1:17:47] anything in my name and don't doubt and
[1:17:50] you shall have what you ask for
[1:17:52] listen to what brother random says here
[1:17:54] and I'm just going to go through these
[1:17:55] and I know we got to close this 8 24.
[1:17:57] from some of the earliest listen
[1:18:00] and let's go to that one that's good
[1:18:01] that's when the light flashes from the
[1:18:03] sky trumpet sounds the body Christ will
[1:18:05] be quickly gathered together and changed
[1:18:07] in a moment taken in Heavens yes there's
[1:18:10] got to be something like that happen
[1:18:14] just heard him say that I can hear his
[1:18:16] word still in my mind
[1:18:18] yes there's got to be
[1:18:22] something like that
[1:18:28] and our schools of theology can never
[1:18:31] produce that yet they're intellectually
[1:18:33] are all right but you've got to meet
[1:18:36] that light
[1:18:37] you've got to find that something
[1:18:41] listen what was on his heart from the
[1:18:43] earliest recorded sermons that we have
[1:18:46] of brother Branham as I did scoured
[1:18:48] through this and put these quotes
[1:18:50] together and even still in a study to
[1:18:52] find as you find the last words of
[1:18:54] Elijah speaking to Elisha and he said
[1:18:57] he's saying to Elisha if you if you come
[1:18:59] to Jericho and and he's speaking some of
[1:19:02] his last words and he tells him you know
[1:19:03] Elisha just just Pastor here and it'll
[1:19:07] be a good church you can pastor this
[1:19:09] group of people and you know what Elisha
[1:19:11] said Elisha said nope
[1:19:15] you mean it wasn't enough Elijah to have
[1:19:17] to witness what Elijah did in the
[1:19:20] ministry of Elijah come on you've seen
[1:19:22] the Miracles
[1:19:23] of Elijah and here's even the prophet
[1:19:26] telling you stop at Bethel build a
[1:19:28] church get your kids here plan build a
[1:19:31] house
[1:19:31] come on Elijah you'd make a good pastor
[1:19:37] takes him from Bethel to Jericho here's
[1:19:39] Jericho now in Elijah's Ministry it was
[1:19:43] uh it was a Revival
[1:19:44] and now you come to the end of Elijah's
[1:19:47] Ministry and they're not only
[1:19:49] backslidden and cold and hardened Hearts
[1:19:52] they're worse
[1:19:56] than before Elijah's Revival
[1:19:59] bethel's the same I could read you we
[1:20:01] had it in our notes and I won't take the
[1:20:02] time to do it I could read you about the
[1:20:05] miraculous that God did in bed in the
[1:20:06] city of Bethel and they were backslidden
[1:20:09] people God sends a Prophet Elijah and
[1:20:11] there comes a Revival now at the end of
[1:20:13] Elijah's Ministry that same city is
[1:20:15] backslidden but not only are they
[1:20:18] backslidden they're twice dead
[1:20:20] plucked up by the roots it's a more
[1:20:23] impossible situation than when Elijah
[1:20:25] was there and now the prophet is saying
[1:20:28] to the Next Generation come on Elijah
[1:20:31] stay here Terry here wait here just you
[1:20:34] just live here what's he doing he's
[1:20:36] testing his he's testing Elisha he's
[1:20:39] bringing him through some tests to see
[1:20:40] will you stay with the word do you
[1:20:43] recognize what's in my Ministry because
[1:20:45] Elisha here's what Elisha was aware of
[1:20:47] until I have that mantle
[1:20:52] I'm staying right here
[1:20:57] oh Hallelujah
[1:20:59] Elijah recognized I might be good I
[1:21:02] might have seen a lot I might have got I
[1:21:03] might be a good preacher
[1:21:05] but until I have what you have
[1:21:09] what was it he wasn't going to stop I
[1:21:11] had a good sensation he wasn't gonna
[1:21:13] stop at a good Ministry or good sermon
[1:21:15] he wanted what Elijah had on his life to
[1:21:19] be transferred to him because he knew he
[1:21:22] could never face the challenge of
[1:21:25] Jericho and Bethel unless he had the
[1:21:28] mantle of Elijah
[1:21:32] and he says as the Lord liveth and as my
[1:21:36] soul liveth
[1:21:39] 2022
[1:21:41] he would have said I ain't going nowhere
[1:21:47] I'm staying right here
[1:21:50] right beside you why because he
[1:21:52] recognized there was an anointing upon
[1:21:55] this ministry that wasn't on any other
[1:21:57] Ministry not at any other denomination
[1:21:59] not at any other church not at any other
[1:22:02] camp meeting not at any other convention
[1:22:06] there was a power there was an anointing
[1:22:08] that was upon this man and Elisha said
[1:22:10] I'm going to stay right beside you I'm
[1:22:12] not going anywhere I'm going to stay
[1:22:14] right beside you and he takes him all
[1:22:16] the way to Jerry to Jordan it's
[1:22:17] incredible because the Bible doesn't
[1:22:19] record that Jordan's flooded it's not
[1:22:21] Waters aren't raised there's no reason
[1:22:23] to part Jordan oh but there is
[1:22:27] there's no reason they could have got a
[1:22:29] boat they could have went across Jordan
[1:22:31] but for Elijah it was important
[1:22:35] to the ministry of Elisha
[1:22:38] that Elisha was with Elijah when he went
[1:22:43] through the Jordan and part of the
[1:22:44] Jordan why because Elijah knew Elisha
[1:22:49] would come to the same exact challenge
[1:22:52] in his life
[1:22:54] he would challenge the same Devils who
[1:22:57] said the days of Miracles are passed he
[1:22:59] would Challenge and be challenged by the
[1:23:01] same intellectual demons he would be
[1:23:03] challenged by the same evil spirits he
[1:23:06] would have the same powers of Darkness
[1:23:08] that was trying to attack and stop the
[1:23:11] ministry of William Branham is the same
[1:23:13] exact Spirits because Spirits never die
[1:23:17] is that what brother random taught us
[1:23:19] people die Spirits never die
[1:23:22] and the same challenges that would face
[1:23:25] his ministry would now face Elijah's
[1:23:29] Ministry
[1:23:33] and you're going to have to come here
[1:23:34] again Elisha
[1:23:36] and when you come to this Jordan
[1:23:38] tapes and books are wonderful and
[1:23:40] pictures and photographs are wonderful
[1:23:43] watching video of deep Cola to the Deep
[1:23:45] that's wonderful you get Faith by
[1:23:47] watching that but until that same mantle
[1:23:50] of anointing that is on those tapes and
[1:23:53] was on those books and was on those
[1:23:55] videos oh can somebody help me preach
[1:23:57] here tonight
[1:23:58] until that same faith comes off of those
[1:24:01] tapes and off of those stories and goes
[1:24:05] from promise to purpose to anointing
[1:24:10] you'll never Park Jordan
[1:24:14] and he comes and the Bible says he goes
[1:24:16] and he comes to this here and I just
[1:24:19] want to say that we'll just save that
[1:24:20] here just for a moment notice what
[1:24:22] brother randoms in The Firm of the sum
[1:24:24] of the earliest recordings
[1:24:26] in his ministry and that these didn't
[1:24:28] come through very good so I'm going to
[1:24:29] read them to you and you'll just have to
[1:24:30] trust me that I'm not adding anything to
[1:24:32] what brother Brandon said here they
[1:24:34] didn't come they didn't come out exactly
[1:24:35] right
[1:24:36] brother Brandon says this I know the
[1:24:38] next thing to happen now this is the
[1:24:41] message the angel of God
[1:24:45] in 1948
[1:24:48] so some of the earliest
[1:24:51] I know the next thing to happen is the
[1:24:54] restoration of the gifts to the church
[1:24:57] it's the hardest thing I've had to do I
[1:25:01] sit on an airplane when I read this
[1:25:03] it's the hardest thing I've had to do in
[1:25:06] this pioneering work
[1:25:10] so wait a minute what was brother random
[1:25:12] doing he was pioneering the way
[1:25:15] not so that we could say that's not the
[1:25:17] way anymore
[1:25:19] hello somebody
[1:25:21] he was pioneering he was Blazing do you
[1:25:24] know the hardest thing is not to walk
[1:25:25] down the trail but to blaze the trail
[1:25:30] and so he created the trail and he and
[1:25:33] brother Adam said it's been the hardest
[1:25:34] thing I've had to do in this pioneering
[1:25:36] work is to do is to see this now he says
[1:25:39] in this pioneering work is to do this as
[1:25:42] to see the people that notice but if all
[1:25:46] the Full Gospel people would come in one
[1:25:48] heart and one Accord
[1:25:50] there would be a Revival that would
[1:25:51] shake the whole world and every
[1:25:54] spiritual gift would be in the church
[1:25:56] within an hour's time after it took
[1:26:00] place
[1:26:01] signs and wonders that was done by the
[1:26:03] apostles
[1:26:04] would be a minor thing
[1:26:07] to what we would do if we could get just
[1:26:10] get the church together it's got to
[1:26:13] happen
[1:26:15] let me read you what's not on the screen
[1:26:17] it will happen
[1:26:21] it may be after I've passed off the
[1:26:24] scene but I want to put my word in this
[1:26:28] that you might know that my voice
[1:26:33] it's this
[1:26:35] I love the way brother Branham says that
[1:26:37] I want to just put my word on magnetic
[1:26:40] tape so that it's never lost
[1:26:43] this is what I support
[1:26:45] this is what I believe
[1:26:48] you say what is it brother Matt this
[1:26:50] pioneering work to see the gifts flowing
[1:26:52] in the body of the church as I read that
[1:26:55] on the plane I typed out I said what a
[1:26:57] slap in the face it would be then after
[1:26:59] a brother Brandon Pioneers the work for
[1:27:02] a church to come later and say we don't
[1:27:04] need those gifts anymore we don't need
[1:27:06] the supernatural anymore we just got a
[1:27:08] tape player we just press play
[1:27:10] and Obey listen it's so clear and
[1:27:14] brother branham's Ministry it was never
[1:27:17] his intention to bottle up the gifts the
[1:27:20] anointing the supernatural in one person
[1:27:25] it was clear his desire was to see the
[1:27:28] book of Corinthians the book of
[1:27:30] Ephesians the book of Acts
[1:27:32] bursting out of the church bursting out
[1:27:35] of the pews breathing out of the people
[1:27:38] where it was a body Ministry not just a
[1:27:41] prophet not just five preachers a five
[1:27:43] gifts a five-fold Ministry
[1:27:47] but the entire body
[1:27:50] and he says every spiritual gift would
[1:27:53] be in the church so it's got to happen
[1:27:55] it will happen
[1:27:58] it's to my humble belief that we're
[1:28:00] living in the end time or may I make it
[1:28:03] a little more personal to that saying he
[1:28:06] says let me restart the quote he says
[1:28:08] this is my humble belief that we're
[1:28:09] living near the end time or may I make
[1:28:11] it a little more personal than that
[1:28:12] saying we're living in the end time and
[1:28:15] if I believe it's time for the
[1:28:17] restoration of the church that was
[1:28:19] promised that God would sin in the last
[1:28:22] day and I believe that this is the day
[1:28:25] when the word has been preached so much
[1:28:27] and the days getting so dark so evil
[1:28:30] till according to God's word he was to
[1:28:32] restore all that the caterpillar had
[1:28:34] eaten I know this is on your screen so
[1:28:36] this listen the Palmer worm had eaten
[1:28:39] and he says and it would be restored
[1:28:42] back and this is the day of the
[1:28:46] restoration of the spiritual gifts given
[1:28:50] unto the church
[1:28:53] I'm not just preaching on gifts not just
[1:28:55] preaching on the right just the
[1:28:56] restoration of the gifts what I'm
[1:28:58] preaching to you is that it was brother
[1:29:00] branham's Ministry that the anointing
[1:29:03] that was on the Bible
[1:29:06] would come off the Bible
[1:29:09] and it would live in men and it would
[1:29:11] live in women and it would live in
[1:29:13] teenagers it would live in
[1:29:15] five-year-olds and seven-year-olds and
[1:29:17] 30 and 60 year olds it was his desire
[1:29:20] that that promise of that anointing
[1:29:22] would come upon the whole church
[1:29:28] wise we said this last time that's why
[1:29:31] he spoke to a little woman brother
[1:29:33] Branham says God bypassed all of the
[1:29:36] celebrities he bypassed all of the
[1:29:39] riches fam rich and famous and he came
[1:29:42] to a little illiterate woman named
[1:29:44] Hattie Wright
[1:29:46] and brother random says he says brother
[1:29:48] Brandon that's nothing but the truth
[1:29:53] did she pass some kind of degree did she
[1:29:56] pass some kind of test of conduct was it
[1:29:59] because of how much of how many tapes
[1:30:01] she listened to that morning or how much
[1:30:03] of the Bible she even read her how good
[1:30:05] she was or how and was it based upon
[1:30:07] anything no it was based upon simple
[1:30:10] faith
[1:30:12] they could say I believe it
[1:30:16] that's nothing but the truth brother
[1:30:18] Brandon
[1:30:19] and brother Branham says those words
[1:30:21] when Hattie Wright uttered those words
[1:30:23] that's nothing but the truth brother
[1:30:25] Brandon
[1:30:27] brother Branham says those words moved
[1:30:29] heaven
[1:30:32] and words that might have seemed so
[1:30:34] simple
[1:30:35] you know sometimes it's the simple
[1:30:37] things you say in prayer everyone's
[1:30:39] looking for the big extravagant things
[1:30:41] you could say to God God's just looking
[1:30:43] for a little simple heart that'll say
[1:30:46] that's nothing but the truth I believe
[1:30:49] it with all of my heart I believe it
[1:30:52] with everything that's within me oh how
[1:30:55] many could identify and say that I've
[1:30:58] got simple enough Faith to say I believe
[1:31:00] it with all of my heart
[1:31:03] that's nothing but the truth don't try
[1:31:06] to complicate it it's not complicated
[1:31:08] hello somebody
[1:31:10] he said that moved heaven and brother
[1:31:13] Brandon says sister Hattie
[1:31:15] you ask for whatever you want right now
[1:31:20] whatever you have need of and brother
[1:31:22] Branham says and she had one thing on
[1:31:24] her mind
[1:31:25] her Lost Boys
[1:31:28] two lost children
[1:31:30] brother Adam said she could have asked
[1:31:32] for anything but she thinks she's
[1:31:33] thinking of not of things in time but
[1:31:36] things in eternity
[1:31:40] you say brother Matt why is that such a
[1:31:43] why is that so important because that
[1:31:45] same faith that was on Hattie Wright has
[1:31:49] to be transferred for from a promise to
[1:31:52] a woman
[1:31:53] to a people
[1:31:55] and you can have faith to ask for your
[1:31:58] unsaved children and your lost daughter
[1:32:00] and your lost son and your loss whoever
[1:32:04] it is here tonight why did Brother
[1:32:06] random speak to a storm it was not so
[1:32:08] that we could say look at what the power
[1:32:10] of God that he did in brother Van's
[1:32:12] Ministry but so that you could speak to
[1:32:14] your storm
[1:32:16] you can speak to your cancer and your
[1:32:19] disease and your sickness
[1:32:21] and that anointing that Supernatural
[1:32:24] faith
[1:32:26] would come off that page and come to a
[1:32:29] person
[1:32:31] he says and when the church puts forth
[1:32:33] another church this is from the earliest
[1:32:34] tapes that we have
[1:32:37] notice this is 1960 it wasn't so from
[1:32:40] the beginning when the church puts forth
[1:32:41] another church it'll be a Pentecostal
[1:32:44] church not 1906 but Acts
[1:32:48] hello
[1:32:51] with signs with the signs of the acts in
[1:32:55] the Apostles doing the same thing with
[1:32:58] the same Jesus
[1:33:00] working the same
[1:33:02] because he's the same yesterday and
[1:33:05] forever
[1:33:06] a Pentecostal Branch filled with the
[1:33:09] Holy Ghost signs and wonders of the
[1:33:12] Resurrection great things taking place
[1:33:14] among them they who know their God in
[1:33:17] the last day shall do exploits yes we're
[1:33:20] at the end time
[1:33:22] we go to some of the last recorded
[1:33:24] sermons that we have now we find out
[1:33:26] that in the time that when this great
[1:33:28] thing has been brought up find out that
[1:33:30] we're missing something in our churches
[1:33:32] wait a minute
[1:33:33] that the seals in 1963 have already been
[1:33:36] opened
[1:33:38] and now you have the prophet coming uh
[1:33:41] in the message does God change his mind
[1:33:43] what a title
[1:33:46] does God change his mind
[1:33:50] 1965.
[1:33:52] or at the end there's Elijah and his
[1:33:55] last words
[1:33:57] the last few things on his heart
[1:33:59] here he is in 1965. we find out we're
[1:34:03] missing something in our churches
[1:34:06] and that is the power of Christ now look
[1:34:10] I don't want to criticize I love you in
[1:34:13] genuine true love always is corrective
[1:34:15] now we're missing Christ
[1:34:19] in our church
[1:34:21] I stopped right here reading this quote
[1:34:24] and in my mind immediately left this
[1:34:27] church or any church
[1:34:29] and it brought it a little bit further
[1:34:32] and I brought it right to my home
[1:34:35] and then I went a little bit further and
[1:34:37] then I went right to my home
[1:34:41] and brother Brandon says now we're
[1:34:43] missing something we're missing Christ
[1:34:45] in our church
[1:34:46] we're missing Christ amongst our
[1:34:48] Pentecostal people and brothers and
[1:34:50] sisters there's something wrong listen
[1:34:53] and he says the old-fashioned prayer
[1:34:55] meetings they used to have all day and
[1:34:58] night
[1:34:59] they don't have them no more
[1:35:02] our women used to wear long hair they
[1:35:05] don't do it anymore it would be a
[1:35:06] disgrace for a woman to paint and use
[1:35:08] paint back in the early days
[1:35:11] and act the way that these women do
[1:35:14] something went wrong
[1:35:16] nothing's wrong with Christ
[1:35:20] see but something went wrong you
[1:35:22] remember the quote we heard on Sunday it
[1:35:24] wasn't the Bible it was the
[1:35:25] interpretation that was wrong
[1:35:27] it was Eve's interpreter
[1:35:30] and he says something went wrong
[1:35:32] something is somewhere the pulpit used
[1:35:34] to wouldn't permitted such a thing as
[1:35:36] that but it does now see the crisis is
[1:35:38] on and we're missing something
[1:35:42] or missing power that we ought to have
[1:35:46] where the big machine
[1:35:49] ought to be running up in great signs
[1:35:51] and wonders well that's building ought
[1:35:53] to be sitting so full of the power of
[1:35:56] God now till a sinner couldn't stay in
[1:35:59] here the Holy Spirit condemning it right
[1:36:02] quickly like that like ananias and
[1:36:05] Sapphira and we're missing something
[1:36:11] now we've taken you all the way from the
[1:36:13] early
[1:36:14] to summon 6062 now we're all the way in
[1:36:18] April of 1965 and brother Brandon's
[1:36:21] going to come to the God of this evil
[1:36:23] age in August and he says now she has
[1:36:25] caused the whole world to accept the
[1:36:27] scientific leadership of the educational
[1:36:29] program that Satan has given her
[1:36:32] given to her under the name of a church
[1:36:35] the leadership of an educational
[1:36:38] scientific program I'm picturing to you
[1:36:41] the God of this world when she as Eve
[1:36:45] had the very feeling of God's word in
[1:36:47] her hand she could have took God's word
[1:36:49] but what did she do to that instead of
[1:36:53] tarrying for the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:57] Ghost let science prove to her that the
[1:37:01] Holy Ghost was only for the disciples
[1:37:06] I'm reading this slow intentionally
[1:37:07] because this is the words of Elijah to
[1:37:10] Elisha
[1:37:12] and this is what's on his heart
[1:37:14] she's ten instead of tarrying she let
[1:37:17] science prove to her it's it's only for
[1:37:20] the disciples notice this instead of
[1:37:23] keeping Divine Healing going when she
[1:37:27] ought to now raising now and he says
[1:37:29] when she ought to be now raising the
[1:37:32] Dead
[1:37:34] and doing great miracles
[1:37:39] now brother Branham is referring to the
[1:37:42] church
[1:37:43] who has put Christ out of his own church
[1:37:46] he's referring to the Church of laodicea
[1:37:51] we're not the Church of laodicea
[1:37:54] hello
[1:37:57] we've heard a voice come up come out of
[1:37:59] her my people don't be a partaker of her
[1:38:04] so you be not a partaker of her plagues
[1:38:08] then let me just say this than anything
[1:38:10] he said to condemn or to rebuke the
[1:38:13] false church should never be guilty in
[1:38:16] the true church
[1:38:18] I just want to put my voice here and say
[1:38:20] God don't ever let us be guilty
[1:38:24] don't ever let us be guilty of the God
[1:38:26] of this evil age of what he explained
[1:38:27] away to Eve we ought to now be raising
[1:38:30] the dead and great Miracles taking place
[1:38:34] you say brother Matt what are you
[1:38:35] preaching I'm preaching what your
[1:38:37] expectation should be
[1:38:39] if it's not here friends if we we don't
[1:38:42] see the word manifesting in our life
[1:38:44] what ought we to do
[1:38:47] yeah brother Matt were to explain it
[1:38:49] away and say it was just for another age
[1:38:51] and it's the I mean do you realize when
[1:38:54] you place the promises of God just heard
[1:38:57] brother random my brother had sent this
[1:38:58] quote just to me the other day it was
[1:39:00] actually to a group and he says that
[1:39:02] when you place the promises of God
[1:39:05] that are in the Bible on any other age
[1:39:09] than present day you're under a delusion
[1:39:12] of Satan
[1:39:15] so when we explain away the promises of
[1:39:18] God brother random says it was for
[1:39:20] another it's and she's believed it
[1:39:21] listen to this here I still got you
[1:39:25] eight of you do I still got you
[1:39:27] 13 of you do I still got you
[1:39:30] I heard somebody on the internet say
[1:39:32] Amen praise God
[1:39:34] when the Bible said
[1:39:36] this is the Bible
[1:39:37] the things that I do
[1:39:40] shall you do also
[1:39:43] amen Jesus said that
[1:39:45] go you into all the world and preach the
[1:39:48] gospel to Every Creature I love this
[1:39:50] we're still creatures
[1:39:53] these signs shall follow not brother
[1:39:57] Branham
[1:39:58] hello
[1:40:01] these Sons shall follow not brother
[1:40:03] Bosworth I'm reading a quote here
[1:40:04] brother Adam saying that not brother
[1:40:06] Bach not brother not brother Bosworth
[1:40:08] not brother Roberts
[1:40:10] but these shall these signs shall follow
[1:40:12] every one of them that belief
[1:40:17] I believe
[1:40:19] I'm a Believer
[1:40:21] I may not have much but I have this I
[1:40:23] believe I believe the promise of God I
[1:40:26] accept it for my life
[1:40:29] but she denies every bit of it
[1:40:32] she denies all the Supernatural and she
[1:40:35] swapped it for his intellectual
[1:40:36] conception of the Bible where priests
[1:40:39] and Holy Father so-called were Bishops
[1:40:41] archbishops District presidents General
[1:40:43] overseers so for us to put their own
[1:40:45] interpretation to it and God has left
[1:40:46] them set their dead as 12 o'clock
[1:40:49] and I believe the same thing we live in
[1:40:52] today God bearing record of his word by
[1:40:54] vindicating what he said he would do now
[1:40:57] we know that this is the day of
[1:40:58] salvation I believe that where God is
[1:41:01] calling men from the world from a life
[1:41:03] of sin into a life of service and in the
[1:41:06] day that God has poured out a spirit
[1:41:07] from on high great signs and wonders are
[1:41:11] to accompany the ministry of this day
[1:41:16] for the matter you preaching that we
[1:41:18] ought to look for signs yes
[1:41:24] let me just kill and squash that
[1:41:26] cockroach devil right here yes
[1:41:30] you say why well you're preaching them
[1:41:32] we're looking for signs and wonders yes
[1:41:36] why because the Bible said they would be
[1:41:38] here and I believe the Bible
[1:41:41] you say brother Matt what are we to do
[1:41:43] we're to lay aside every weight and
[1:41:45] every sin that does so easily beset us
[1:41:48] every thought and every idea that we
[1:41:50] have and believe every word
[1:41:53] that has been spoken all of it
[1:41:59] and he says great signs and wonders are
[1:42:01] to accompany the ministry of this day
[1:42:03] this is when the former and latter rain
[1:42:06] are falling
[1:42:07] together
[1:42:09] the farmer and the latter rain are
[1:42:12] falling together
[1:42:17] what was it the former Reign the
[1:42:19] teaching rain that's still happening now
[1:42:22] if we just have the latter rain why do
[1:42:24] you have this quote of brother Adam
[1:42:25] saying they fall together we're still
[1:42:27] teaching word that's why we're preaching
[1:42:30] what is that latter rain brother random
[1:42:32] says that latter rain was only to anoint
[1:42:35] what was in the ground that was sown by
[1:42:38] the former ring
[1:42:40] so that's why brother random says if you
[1:42:42] sow denominational seeds when the latter
[1:42:45] rain comes which is the rapture rain
[1:42:48] which is the Harvest rain which look
[1:42:50] around you it's the rain that's falling
[1:42:52] right now it's the rain of Revival it's
[1:42:55] the reign of rejoicing it's the the
[1:42:58] reign of shouting on the tares and the
[1:43:01] wheat
[1:43:02] listen just because the terror
[1:43:04] Pentecostal Terrors are shouting don't
[1:43:06] mean we ought not to shout
[1:43:09] the wheat shouts right with the dares
[1:43:13] the latter rain the farmer the latter
[1:43:16] rain only anoints what you've put in the
[1:43:18] ground
[1:43:19] so the methodists have sowed Methodist
[1:43:21] seed so they've reaped Methodist the
[1:43:24] Baptists have sowed Baptist seeds so
[1:43:26] they reap in the latter rain a Baptist
[1:43:28] lifestyle and a Baptist preaching and a
[1:43:31] Baptist Church
[1:43:33] you say then what did we sow we sowed
[1:43:36] The Original Seed from the original God
[1:43:38] and if you sow the original word when
[1:43:41] the latter ring comes you'll reap the
[1:43:43] original benefits and promises and words
[1:43:46] to your family and your children and
[1:43:49] your children's children
[1:43:53] he says this is when they're supposed to
[1:43:55] be great signs and wonders which in many
[1:43:57] great and many great denominations this
[1:44:00] is turned down
[1:44:04] days of Miracles are passed that's what
[1:44:06] they told you brother Travis
[1:44:08] days of the Apostles are over that don't
[1:44:10] happen no more
[1:44:14] they sow denominational seeds and they
[1:44:18] reap denominational Harvest
[1:44:21] that's why they go through the
[1:44:22] tribulation
[1:44:23] but we didn't put listen I'm going to
[1:44:25] say it right here we don't sow
[1:44:27] denominational seeds
[1:44:29] we don't sow the Creeds of men and the
[1:44:31] ideas of men we sow the original word
[1:44:34] into the hearts of people in the hearts
[1:44:36] of our children why brother Matt so that
[1:44:39] we can get a harvest
[1:44:41] of the Original Seed
[1:44:44] I'm gonna close don't get scared
[1:44:48] but I'm very thankful I love this things
[1:44:51] that are to be December 5th
[1:44:56] 1965. he's coming down to the end
[1:45:01] here's Elijah
[1:45:03] and Elisha and the mantle of Elijah has
[1:45:07] got to be passed to Elijah Elisha I'm
[1:45:10] very thankful for these open doors that
[1:45:14] I've had he just got through saying look
[1:45:15] here he just got through saying that the
[1:45:18] nominations have turned it down
[1:45:20] but I'm very thankful for these open
[1:45:22] doors that have had to go into and the
[1:45:26] inspiration it's give to young men like
[1:45:31] your pastor here
[1:45:34] brother random believe in pastors
[1:45:36] apparently so
[1:45:38] that's calls them as I'm beginning to
[1:45:41] get old and know that my days are
[1:45:43] numbered and know now that these young
[1:45:46] men can take this message
[1:45:50] not another message not added to the
[1:45:53] message come on help me preach not taken
[1:45:55] away from the message not just the parts
[1:45:57] you like or the parts you don't like or
[1:45:58] you cut this out you take scissors and
[1:46:00] cut that but these young men will preach
[1:46:03] the message the whole message
[1:46:08] and he says these young men can take
[1:46:10] this message and sweep it on to the
[1:46:13] coming of the Lord
[1:46:15] if he doesn't come in my generation
[1:46:17] which I'm hoping to see him
[1:46:21] I look daily for him
[1:46:23] watch keeping myself prepared
[1:46:26] for that hour
[1:46:29] to the last recorded sermon we have on
[1:46:31] tape you know the hour will soon arise
[1:46:33] there's 12 12 1965.
[1:46:37] the hour will soon arise when right
[1:46:39] Among Us will be the holy spirit will
[1:46:41] speak out like it did in ananias and
[1:46:44] Sapphira remember see the hour is
[1:46:47] arriving
[1:46:49] and we now you just remember that see
[1:46:51] this is the emphasis God is going to
[1:46:56] dwell among his people
[1:47:01] that's what he wants to do now
[1:47:05] so that I say don't let me hinder you
[1:47:13] I just want to repeat that Lord
[1:47:16] if that's what you want to do then don't
[1:47:19] let anything I do hinder you
[1:47:23] from dwelling among your people
[1:47:26] I say let's give the Holy Spirit free
[1:47:28] reign in this church
[1:47:30] let's give his let's give the Holy
[1:47:32] Spirit Liberty listen friends don't
[1:47:35] restrict him or constrict him with any
[1:47:37] of your ideas of they ought not to do
[1:47:40] this and the music ought to do that and
[1:47:41] the music ought not to do this and we
[1:47:43] ought not to go there we ought not to
[1:47:45] say that listen to you know you can
[1:47:47] restrict the Holy Spirit by your
[1:47:49] attitude I say lay aside all our
[1:47:51] attitudes and say holy spirit move
[1:47:54] freely and our church move freely in our
[1:47:57] youth group we've moved freely in our
[1:47:59] homes let's turn the Holy Ghost loose in
[1:48:02] our churches and in our bodies and in
[1:48:04] our spirits and in our minds and give
[1:48:06] him full control
[1:48:13] I'm going to just skip this this is the
[1:48:16] last quote I'm going to read there's so
[1:48:18] much I could have read here but we're
[1:48:19] out of time
[1:48:21] his desire for the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:48:23] this was incredible go to the next slide
[1:48:25] because he comes to Tucson has one of
[1:48:28] his last places he preaches these
[1:48:30] sermons The Last Place
[1:48:32] and he preaches the message the message
[1:48:34] what house
[1:48:36] will you build me
[1:48:39] one of the last sermons brother Brandon
[1:48:41] comes to and I'm just gonna skip down
[1:48:43] let me find brother Mark where I want to
[1:48:45] go before I have you go
[1:48:47] uh there he says here and in this third
[1:48:50] slide after that go next one yes here I
[1:48:54] know that each of you
[1:48:55] if you feel like I do Paul stop reading
[1:49:01] if you feel like I do
[1:49:03] this is a good moment
[1:49:05] because now we can put a barometer on
[1:49:07] God's prophet
[1:49:08] in November 21st
[1:49:11] of 1965. what did you feel listen what
[1:49:15] was on your heart I know that each of
[1:49:17] you if you feel like I do I am so hungry
[1:49:24] 1965 November you're leaving the scene
[1:49:27] you've went around the world seven times
[1:49:29] you've watched God raise the dead a dead
[1:49:31] boy in Finland you've watched God you
[1:49:34] you've watched the miraculous happen and
[1:49:36] the dead raised come out of wheelchairs
[1:49:38] and throw their crutches down and here's
[1:49:40] brother Brian I'm saying I'm so hungry
[1:49:44] to see the spirit of God moving
[1:49:47] I just can't hardly stand it
[1:49:52] I don't know about you friends but that
[1:49:54] resonates with something down on the
[1:49:56] inside of my inside
[1:49:57] that says I'm so hungry how many mothers
[1:50:01] would raise their hand and say I'm so
[1:50:03] hungry to see the spirit of God move how
[1:50:07] many fathers how many brothers we have
[1:50:10] here and sisters and men that would say
[1:50:12] I'm so hungry
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:16] oh can God see that hand here tonight
[1:50:18] see my hands Lord
[1:50:21] I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God
[1:50:25] moving I just can't hardly stand it I
[1:50:28] want to see you move Lord what I've seen
[1:50:30] you doing in Miracles that you've done
[1:50:32] here I want to see more of it Lord oh
[1:50:34] some are standing could you stand and
[1:50:36] say Lord I'm so hungry to see the spirit
[1:50:39] of God move
[1:50:41] I want to see the power of God I want to
[1:50:43] see the power of the Gospel living in
[1:50:45] men living in women living in teenagers
[1:50:48] living in our church
[1:50:51] I'm so hungry
[1:50:53] I just can't hardly stand
[1:50:57] [Music]
[1:51:02] some experiences have had just up on the
[1:51:04] mountain
[1:51:05] just to feel that once again that's
[1:51:07] something that when I was first Saved
[1:51:09] was So Glorious to my heart and we can
[1:51:11] come into a place we can sit and we see
[1:51:15] it among us
[1:51:16] that we're drying
[1:51:19] as we sit here in the desert I get among
[1:51:21] my brother and they talk with me I talk
[1:51:23] with them always in a little way of
[1:51:24] watching feeling out there with the
[1:51:26] spirit as it was to see just the
[1:51:28] condition of that brother to see what's
[1:51:30] wrong I begin to fill us all reclining
[1:51:33] the next slide I begin to fill us all
[1:51:36] reclining getting away from the spirit
[1:51:39] it's become too natural a thing to us we
[1:51:42] must we must we must we we this Church
[1:51:46] Believers
[1:51:48] we must Worship in the spirit
[1:51:54] where the spirit of God brother Adam is
[1:51:56] going to say is this the spirit of
[1:51:57] there's liberty not only our message
[1:52:00] should be the flame of the hour
[1:52:03] it should be the flame of our hearts
[1:52:06] oh I just want to raise a hand and
[1:52:08] identify again let the message not just
[1:52:11] be the flame of the hour let it be the
[1:52:13] flame of my heart
[1:52:15] got to be in our heart the spirit has to
[1:52:19] pack the message
[1:52:21] here's his last words
[1:52:24] he's going to speak now just hold on
[1:52:26] musicians could play something Softly
[1:52:29] here's his last things he's gonna say
[1:52:33] this is the heart of my message I'm
[1:52:35] going to say it
[1:52:37] last things
[1:52:39] I'm so hungry
[1:52:42] to see the spirit of God move
[1:52:45] just can't hardly see
[1:52:49] now that desire
[1:52:51] has to transfer from Elijah
[1:52:54] to Elisha Elisha you're going to have to
[1:52:58] part the Jordan again
[1:53:00] Elijah ask anything ask anything
[1:53:02] whatever you ask me
[1:53:05] whatever you want
[1:53:07] will be given to you
[1:53:09] and Elisha says
[1:53:12] a double portion
[1:53:15] in other words your inheritance your
[1:53:18] promise the purpose that has been on you
[1:53:20] my desire is that purpose now that
[1:53:23] you're leaving would come upon me
[1:53:24] because I've got challenges in Jordan
[1:53:26] I've got a face I've got difficulties
[1:53:29] and impossibilities of Jericho I've got
[1:53:33] I've got a calloused and cold listen to
[1:53:36] me I've got a calloused and cold
[1:53:38] generation of people so callous that the
[1:53:41] teenagers mocked him
[1:53:44] these are hardened hearts these are
[1:53:46] people that are so foreign diseased with
[1:53:49] sin and Elisha's realizing they're worse
[1:53:53] than when you were here brother random
[1:53:55] it's gotten worse it's darker than 1965.
[1:53:59] the age has gotten worse the trouble has
[1:54:02] gotten worse the pressure for a Believer
[1:54:05] to live in 22. is greater than the
[1:54:10] pressure of a believer in 1965.
[1:54:13] the challenge of the fathers raising
[1:54:17] children and boys and mothers raising
[1:54:20] daughters there was a challenge then the
[1:54:23] challenge today that we Face my brother
[1:54:25] and my sister is greater than any other
[1:54:28] challenge
[1:54:30] I'll go further and say the trials that
[1:54:33] you're facing today is Hell Unleashed
[1:54:38] all of hell
[1:54:40] all of the all of the powers of of
[1:54:43] Darkness
[1:54:45] you face
[1:54:46] every day
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] hello
[1:54:53] hello anybody
[1:54:55] you feel that way
[1:54:57] do you realize that do you feel that way
[1:54:59] Believers you're facing we're literally
[1:55:02] living in Satan's Eden we Face a greater
[1:55:05] pressure even just coming to church on a
[1:55:08] Wednesday night and and having to fight
[1:55:11] through the demon Spirits we've went
[1:55:13] through through just the little bitty
[1:55:14] city tiny city of Beaufort and the
[1:55:17] pressure and the the stress listen it's
[1:55:20] a greater challenge than what was on
[1:55:22] Elijah's Ministry Jericho's hearts are
[1:55:24] hard and bethel's even more sinful
[1:55:28] Jericho's even worse
[1:55:31] What's it gonna take it's going to take
[1:55:33] the same mantle the same anointing the
[1:55:36] same Faith the same expectation the Same
[1:55:39] Heart the same Supernatural brother
[1:55:41] Brandon spent his ministry blazing the
[1:55:44] trail to get a church to believe that
[1:55:47] the god of the Bible was the same God
[1:55:50] yesterday today and forever he spent his
[1:55:54] ministry pioneering a people to raise
[1:55:56] their faith up to believe that God is
[1:55:59] can do anything that you ask
[1:56:05] and now Elisha asks for anything I want
[1:56:08] a double portion of your spirit okay
[1:56:13] you've asked a hard thing
[1:56:15] heart heart heart
[1:56:18] for God no
[1:56:21] hard for you
[1:56:23] Elijah is it hard
[1:56:25] no I'm about to leave
[1:56:28] amen now who's a heart for you
[1:56:33] Elisha
[1:56:35] it's gonna be hard
[1:56:37] you want this anointing
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:56:42] it's going to be a hard way
[1:56:44] but I'm going to give you a promise and
[1:56:46] this was so amazing when I've read this
[1:56:49] I'm going to give you a promise if you
[1:56:51] see me
[1:56:52] when I leave
[1:56:56] it'll come to pass
[1:56:58] if you don't see me
[1:57:01] when I go
[1:57:03] if you see me when I'm gone then it'll
[1:57:06] come to pass
[1:57:08] if you don't see me gone
[1:57:11] then it won't
[1:57:13] do you know
[1:57:15] if you try if you literally I got a
[1:57:18] literal translation of the Hebrew
[1:57:20] what Elijah's saying to Elijah and I
[1:57:22] hope you're spiritual enough to catch
[1:57:23] this
[1:57:24] Elisha when I leave
[1:57:27] if you Elisha see me Elijah as gone
[1:57:34] in other words if you see my ministry as
[1:57:39] over and finished and done and
[1:57:42] responsibilities met I completed my task
[1:57:46] and you recognize Elijah's gone but
[1:57:49] they're still yet a work to be done
[1:57:52] if you see me as gone you're not sitting
[1:57:55] here waiting on me to come back crying
[1:57:58] over me where's Elijah where's Elijah I
[1:58:00] just need Elijah
[1:58:02] do you realize friends how enamored
[1:58:05] people became over the ministry of
[1:58:06] brother random that we have churches now
[1:58:08] today that don't believe in Preachers
[1:58:10] they don't believe in pastors they
[1:58:12] believe a pastor gets a tape player and
[1:58:14] presses play to a tape to an entire
[1:58:15] group of people don't believe in live
[1:58:17] Ministry don't believe in the preaching
[1:58:19] of the word of God there's people that
[1:58:20] believe that say you criticizing those
[1:58:22] people no I'm not here to Banter or
[1:58:24] criticize or tear some of them are
[1:58:26] wonderful sincere Believers that are
[1:58:28] trapped in a system and trapped in an
[1:58:30] idea what is it it's a people who were
[1:58:33] waiting for Elijah and they don't see
[1:58:36] him it's gone
[1:58:39] but for Elijah to receive his Commission
[1:58:42] he's got to see Elijah has gone if you
[1:58:45] see me gone Elisha then that mantle and
[1:58:49] that anointing will come upon you and
[1:58:52] you'll part your Jordan
[1:58:54] and it won't be Elijah doing it for you
[1:58:56] it'll be the mantle of Elijah and the
[1:58:58] promise and those promises I'm just
[1:59:01] going to close have to come off of those
[1:59:03] tapes
[1:59:04] and they've got to be transferred to me
[1:59:08] can you say that and raise a hand and
[1:59:11] say Lord I'm just going to raise my hand
[1:59:13] now and say let those promises transfer
[1:59:18] let that faith
[1:59:20] transfer let that Supernatural God
[1:59:25] that moved in the ministry of Elijah let
[1:59:28] it transfer and move in my little home
[1:59:31] in my little Tabernacle in my church and
[1:59:35] my family in my mind let it operate Lord
[1:59:38] and every facet could you close your
[1:59:40] eyes and just raise a hand and say Lord
[1:59:42] that's my desire here you see our hands
[1:59:44] raised up everywhere Lord Jesus you see
[1:59:47] both of my hands up now God lord as I'm

[2:00:34] hungry I've watched him fill some of the
[2:00:36] young people with the Holy Spirit but
[2:00:38] I'm so hungry to see him do it to

[2:11:38] know I did spoke to me at such a deep
[2:11:42] and profound level amen we've got a
[2:11:45] product of last Sunday service and our
[2:11:49] dear little brother Evan
[2:11:51] Johnson is coming to be baptized you all
[2:11:54] saw him come up Sunday told me he wanted
[2:11:57] to dedicate the rest of his life to the
[2:12:00] Lord Jesus amen and he wanted to be
[2:12:03] baptized I thought he'd I thought little
[2:12:05] brother probably wait till Sunday and I
[2:12:06] got a text from sister Jennifer saying
[2:12:09] he won't he's ready for Wednesday amen I
[2:12:12] told Brother Kenneth we'll take him
[2:12:13] Wednesday if that's what he wants and
[2:12:15] that's what he wants amen so we're going
[2:12:17] to take him to the water tonight and uh
[2:12:20] bury him are you ready to go praise the
[2:12:23] Lord all right
[2:12:24] amen let's see it normally I have a I'm
[2:12:27] wired up for sound let me take this
[2:12:29] jacket off so I can hold a microphone
[2:12:37] come on in here God bless you so let me
[2:12:41] step down ahead of you if I can do this
[2:12:43] without falling

[2:12:48] about two steps down and then dad's
[2:12:50] gonna come down and give us a hand and

[2:13:00] let's just have a seat have it turn
[2:13:03] around sit right there praise the Lord
[2:13:04] so brother Evan you met me at the altar
[2:13:07] on Sunday after the service
[2:13:09] told me you wanted to dedicate the rest
[2:13:11] of your life to serving the lord is that
[2:13:13] correct
[2:13:14] amen and you understand that
[2:13:16] baptism is an act that identifies you
[2:13:19] with the death and the burial and the
[2:13:22] resurrection we're going to bring you
[2:13:23] back up amen the death burial and the
[2:13:26] resurrection of the Lord Jesus so you're
[2:13:28] identifying yourself with him this is
[2:13:30] your way of saying hey world I'm a
[2:13:32] Christian amen amen you understand that
[2:13:35] don't you man I have little doubt praise
[2:13:38] the Lord
[2:13:39] my friends you know
[2:13:41] the Bible doesn't say in vain there's
[2:13:45] the value of thousands ten thousand
[2:13:49] worlds
[2:13:50] it would take to equal one soul
[2:13:53] and Heaven rejoices when one Soul comes
[2:13:57] because then from one the order of the
[2:14:01] kingdom of God is tonight just like
[2:14:02] brother Matt was preaching the order of
[2:14:04] the kingdom is that it passes on to
[2:14:06] another and another and another because
[2:14:09] remember that it is it is sheep who bear
[2:14:13] Sheep amen so praise the lord it's up to
[2:14:17] you to let your light shine and pass
[2:14:19] this gospel brother Evan you'll be
[2:14:22] charged by the Holy Spirit to tell
[2:14:24] others about what God has done in your
[2:14:26] heart all right you accept that
[2:14:28] challenge my brother praise the Lord
[2:14:30] amen well let's stand back up and let me
[2:14:32] pray for you stand back up and let's
[2:14:34] have a word of prayer father
[2:14:36] we're thanking you for the life of our
[2:14:38] little brother Lord the sincerity that's
[2:14:41] in his heart is so real and Lord we're
[2:14:45] asking you now that as we take him down
[2:14:47] in baptism lord it's not the water that
[2:14:49] saves him it's his confession in Christ
[2:14:51] Lord his faith that you gave him to
[2:14:53] believe every word of God now we come
[2:14:56] Lord in obedience to the word to baptize
