book you ready for the word this morning amen amen you know we're supposed to leave church better than we came amen but I'm just so glad it's not by how you feel it's by faith because without faith it is impossible to please God and I know I say that a lot but it's such a profound thing if you don't have faith you can't please God that's the scriptures says that in the word it is impossible to please God without faith you know Christianity true Christianity it's living for others Y and that doesn't necessarily mean you're only living for your family and the ones that you love but you see somebody that's hurting and you got extra money you're supposed to give to them you're supposed to live for others and if we're not living for others if we're not doing the things that Christ commanded us to do come on now let's just repent Lord just touch my heart do something for me today Lord I should have given that $10 that guy driving on the road the other day I didn't need those those coca-colas I I could have given that money to that man who you told me to give it to and I didn't do it cuz I wasn't listening that's still Small Voice friends inside we've got to listen to that

the Lord today the Lord godess bless you happy to see all your smiling faces there's a number who are out of town we want to be remembering them this morning amen we're certainly continuing to remember sister Kathy holding her up in prayer amen sister Jean also needs a touch from the Lord this morning at home not feeling well talk to uh brother Tony and um he's there with uh his mom and U it's hard to say what'll happen we know what came can happen uh we know the Lord is able to add life and years back to our sister or he's able to bring her on to her reward I I think I probably know what he would rather do and what she would rather have happen but sometimes on this side we we want to hold on so long amen but sister Smith is a wonderful sister we've loved having her here visiting many times amen amen praise the Lord I I was talking to brother Tony this morning and and well it was hard he was broke up and sister Debbie and I we were truck we were broke up and I know that pain all too well but he he told me he said his mother you know as she she seems to be slipping away and he said that um you know even her mind is starting to drift a little bit and he said she in her Hospital hospital bed earlier this morning I think it was she reached over and got her pocketbook and she reached in it brother Tony said she pulled out a dollar and she said please put this in the offering plate for me I just thought wow as the last thing on that sister's mind is to give it to the Lord amen to help the kingdom of God Amen I was I was reminded of that as brother Brad was making those comments this morning about giving my my my my we're going to go right to the word of God I'm glad to have you all here we don't want to start calling names but we're happy to have you all here amen praise the Lord amen so I'm sure you can see what's going on outside amen speaking of offerings we're going to need some praise the lord we got a lot going on and uh I think the brothers are of the mind your representatives and the trustee board are of the Mind to try to build back up our funds so that when our so that when we our next thing we'll be able to get it to you know frame it sighing roof and dry it in have it dried in amen we're going to need a little more than what we have probably twice what we have left over this Foundation was a lot of work but it looks beautiful amen I'm sure happy for the blessing of the Lord amen praise the Lord Brother Kenny has a report coming soon so I'm not going to take any time with it today Genesis chapter 2 amen we want to hopefully by the will of the Lord at least the way it feels in my heart now we will conclude with our series and uh concluding the East Wind that's even my subtitle today this will be part 10 the 10th installment um The Voice in the East Wind don't have any time today to recap so I trust that you've kept up with the archives amen Genesis 2 verses 1 to3 the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which he had created and made Revelation chapter 20 start you out at the beginning take you all the way to the backs side of it Revelation CH 20 verses 1-4 and I saw an angel come down from heaven Heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years is that beautiful let's pray pray father we thank you for your word today and Lord my heart and my mind are full with the thoughts of your word and so we're asking now that you give us your anointing that we might be concise and go through this as you have laid it out to us Lord and I pray you'll make up for my human frailties in the attempt we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless you friend you can be seated man brother Brad if you'll make sure that the back hallway speaker and the U outdoor speakers are turned up good and Loud normally I try to spend a few minutes uh with some opening comments to give the musicians and what more time to make their way around I won't have time to do that today amen so we've read read about a time that we have come to that is soon going to be upon the Earth it is certainly a new age of man that is ready to cover the Earth and we think about a we think about a a Rapture of the church and just remember friends that it's not end all it's not even it's not it's not the full event it's a it's an event and it's an epic event and it is the culmination of thousands of years of God working among the Gentiles so it's not nothing and it's not to be undervalued but just remember that he he there's going to be three and a half more years there's a reward ceremony there's the banquet supper there's Moses and Elijah's Ministry there's the calling of the 144,000 there's Christ coming back with the bride after 42 months once the bride leaves the Earth the the the planet Earth and all of its Humanity have 42 months in counting and every 24 hours they have less like an hourglass that's losing its sand it won't be extended it can't be extended prophecy's in place the word has been given the stage is set and the script is playing so we realize that today that while it is called day this is is the time to turn to the Lord if you haven't this is the hour to have the Holy Spirit dwelling Within You by a new birth that's far more than joining a church as we know we're going to deal with that a little bit today and and so we find that that the Earth is coming toward a new age a new a new world order the Earth is not ending the world is not ending people say oh the world is ending that's not true the Earth is Eternal attribute of God and can never be annihilated but we do find out that the order of things are passing away and there's going to be a new order there's going to be a new king there's going to be a new people there's going to be a new there is going to be a one world government but it's not going to be the pl the laid plans of mice and men it's going to be the plans of almighty God and Christ will rule and Reign from his throne for a thousand years a new age of man is ready ready to cover the Earth I'm looking forward to it amen it is the restoration of a former time from the beginning the world will come back to begin again that 1,000 years of rest that we read in our Genesis text see but you remember that that seventh day never got to finish out because sin came in the God's enemy slipped in all part of the Plan of Redemption sin broke the world broke nature man fell everything under him fell and since then Nature has been groaning waiting for the for the reoccurrence where the sons of God Sons and Daughters of God rule the Earth again in righteousness so we know that the world is going to come back to begin again that 1,000 years of rest but I want to point out to you today that that the restoration of Eden in Revelation won't be exactly like the Eden of geneses in one all important part in these thousand years of rest Satan will be bound and there won't be anybody slipping under the under the gate and breaking the Earth again all will be peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore Revelation chapter 10 Zoe uh we're going to go verses 8- 11 Revelation 108-111 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me verse 11 thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings now we realize that this is the ministry that immediately falls on the he heels of the Revelation 10:7 messenger which has already came already ran already went back to his reward and now John representing the bride has received the book is eating the book is becoming the book because she must prophesy again and that's your life happening right now with the token on display if the token is not on display you don't have the right message amen wow amen you're not preaching the correct message your life is preaching A variation of the truth which cannot and will not redeem anyone you have to be the final voice it's not that you're need to get up here in a pull pit with me it's that you have a greater Ministry and that is the voice of I lived life to the world we must preach among Kings he says here thou must prophesy again before many peoples the Elijah doesn't need to come back and do it you're doing it many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings that is all Humanity you have a mission I say we get to it amen amen we're not leaving here till it's finished so the living bride at the end of this this you you know when you realize that that Revelation 10 takes the bride sees the bride go home and that once our ministry is over then Revelation 11 begins in Earnest to bring up bring forward Moses and Elijah the bride goes home the eagle anointing lifts up it doesn't go back to Heaven it lifts up and flies East and picks up two prophets because they will carry the same message that you're believing and they'll bring they'll be and that will bring the same holy ghost that you're receiving and it will cause people to become part of the first resurrection just like you and they'll be in the Millennium amen so we realize then that the living bride at the end time she is then according to the this prophecy according to the way the Bible lays it out in the Book of Revelation the living bride at the end is the last vestage of Hope to a dying history amen what irony it seems to me that God would put the most important task of Eternity upon the shoulders of people I immersed in the most wicked day of all ages and it's happening in real time at the most critical juncture of human history amen wow the history of God's 6,000 year Plan of Redemption is coming down to this moment this is happening friends it's a Mount Zion Showdown it won't be turned back it can't be it won't be extended the Apostle has the the Apostle has talk talks about in the scripture I believe it's either James or John talks about how that that the one that's coming right here at the end time he won't T I know it sometimes it feels like he's taring but he says in plain language he it will not t I'm here to tell you and that's why the the another Apostle tells us you know don't think of it as God being late to the party that he's just longsuffering but I I promise you that Jesus said that time is exactly in the father's mind he knows exactly when he's going to do it and I'm here to tell you it's going to happen just as sure as a prophet came it's going to happen just as sure as a bride is here it's going to happen just as sure as the seals are open it's going to happen just as sure as the token is here hallelujah and it's upon us that foundation of the New Birth when it comes into the believer's heart we've talked a lot about this the the Lord has really been driving it home this this point home in the pull pit not only under my Ministry but the other brothers as well I thought Brother JD preached probably the best sermon I've ever heard him preach Wednesday night was so stunning and my brother gidon and I were talking about it and trying to recommend anybody who wasn't able to come make sure you get that it's so instructional so we find out that the foundation of the new birth what does it do and we could read quotes today where brother brandham talks about you know you know and I and I've got a hundred quotes today that I'm not going to get to and that's on Purpose By Design I probably save it for a different sermon that won't be part of this series but he he makes a reference to the emotional sight of things and signs and gifts and things that can operate he said we've had all of that it's wonderful it's all part of it so I don't want to take away any part that's a part understand but it's not the end all the end all is Christ in you the hope of glory and the fullness of adoption is the change of your bodies so we brother Bram says you say will I shout he said you might but you also might not you know will this happen will that happen will this happen will I speak in tongues well I do this he said you might but also you might not but one thing you will do and that is that your life will come subject to every word of God and that's how you know you've been born again because your life is in line with the will of God and it's by your choice that you live it it's by your desires that have been changed it's not gritting your teeth and struggling it's I want this life that's how you know you've passed from Death un life when go when Christ becomes supernaturally your first priority the new birth controls your actions going forward from now to the day that you get home to glory amen where where you began this journey from amen you believe that you began this journey as a little Spirit of Life brother brandham I think in one quote refers to it like a little angel Spirit uh a little life waiting that was waiting to enter a body that was dropping from the womb of your mother a little a little Spirit of life that you have no memory of being but the mother felt it as a sweetness that suddenly came across her amen even in the midst of her her suffering to bring forth children somehow something dropped in upon her a sweet spirit and and brother brandham says it it it was noticeable and so so we find then that you know that when we come to the birth and Christ becomes a revelation to you personally uh you know often a great burden can I say it this way and this is kind of a Direction I want to go in today often times a great burden especially here in Satan's Eden a great burden can come on those who although children of God although a seed Gene of God although Born Again by a revelation of Christ personally to them and the soul and yet often times that that child of God that recreated child of God that Born Again child of God because we still live in a unconverted body with an unconverted Spirit see don't forget it's not just your your flesh and your spirit go together because it's 10 senses that your if if your spirit leaves your body none of your five senses In the Flesh will function see so so it is your sight and your hearing and it is your taste and your touch all of those elements of the flesh but it's also your memories and your reasons reasoning your conscience your affection your imaginations and Satan plays with all of those to try to control he he he has access to your spirit so that he can control your flesh the holy spirit in the soul is the counter to that amen you understand and it's the holy spirit that is the counter to that amen amen the holy spirit in your soul is the counter to that Fallen life that's still in your flesh Amen Brother Don Hoffman spoke about it very very eloquently when he was here two Wednesdays ago that that that we have been the old man that old nature and our soul has certainly been annihilated he's gone he's never coming back he doesn't even exist anymore but we at the same time we still do have to Grapple with this flesh and even though we're Sons and Daughters of God and even though we're born again of the spirit you still need to read your Bible and pray even though you've been born again you still need to come to church even though you're born again you still need the Fellowship of the Saints even though you're born again you still have to turn your head from Evil you have to turn away from wickedness you can't just walk around you're not impervious to those things so we find then that that this is a sometimes a great burden now without the new birth I just want to hit it briefly and then we're going to move on quickly because I'm really trying to deal with those who are born again but without the new birth you will just live in varying degrees of sanctification which aren't bad that's good that's awesome you know as I've said even if there was no heaven and there was no nothing I would still want to live the lifestyle of a Christian because it's just healthier and I I have a much better chance of staying sane I have a much better chance of keeping my money I have a much better chance of staying healthy I have a much better chance of staying married you see amen so so I it's a wonderful lifestyle regardless but if if you haven't had the level of experience in the you brother brand say it like this you haven't even started yet now he said a lot more than that so don't just cabbage down on that because we do know that even the unwise Virgin are labeled as righteous Saints by the great king but they're not born again and they go through the tribulation and they stand and have to be judged and I I don't like going to court I've been to court for traffic tickets and I didn't like it I didn't like the fact that I had to stand there and try to explain myself and and my fate is in the hands of some man sitting behind there and think of the King sitting on the throne and you've got to give an account for your life and he's going to be asking you like brother Ernie said when he saw that dream he said he said everybody that came before him he would say what did you do with your life when you knew I was coming coming oh I want to be on the throne with him I want all my sins to be dealt with before I even arrive there Hallelujah I don't want to try to answer that question am I don't know what I would say now to say nothing of what I would say then if you're in that position friends you'll set in a message church or any church but even a message Church and God's word to you without the new birth will be good and useful and practical but it'll be letter only and and and and it would and then then whether you have some kind of experience of emotion or maybe you just have some kind of drye confession right amen with no emotion and it's just a mental thing or maybe you shouted and ran all over the building if you haven't really been Born Again In Your Soul whether it's a a dry-eyed confession or all the emotion in the whole world poured upon you you know and and and even you'll sit uh in a Vindicated word of this hour and and and but but even even if it's the Vindicated anointed word really all it can be to you is really good effective Christian psychology amen amen and that's there's some benefit in that but but that's all that's the limit of it it'll never change the sin nature down in your soul it'll never put you on the other side in the first resurrection you certainly won't go up in the first resurrection you'll come up every man every woman will get a fair trial thank God I'm glad he's the judge not me amen so you must be born again by a full and unequivocal surrender of your whole self to Christ and Christ is the word there's nothing around that that's right you can't go around that there's no end around right on that you have to receive the word for your age let me say it like this you have to receive the word for this age amen you say why is that true because that's been true in every age that wasn't not just New Testament that true in the ages of the Old Testament every time God brought forth a new truth you had to advance you had to accept that it had to become a part of you what we're saying today is not new novel or strange to say to say it's not that breaks every pattern in the Bible see so so so you must be born again the Holy Ghost is the power of God upon those who wish to live in the beauty and it is beautiful those who wish to live in the beauty of overcoming daily I vote for that the process of course now you know to to to to be born again we've dealt with this quite a bit it's got to begin of course with with with the thoughts of your of your mind which is now we're not talking about your gray matter we're talking about as a man thinketh in his heart we're talking about in the spirit that mind that's in the heart that when you hear the anointed word and that anointed word is ministered to you and it ministers the instructions of life for the way that you are to live and how you are to have a token on on display it begins with you agreeing with God's word for to take effect now that's true before during and after the new birth that's an an eternal principle you have to agree with God's word brother Bram talks about that in the greatest battle he said if he can just get that your mind to agree with his word see then he said then that old nature dies and you're born again so now you can't do that on your own because your human mind is enmity against God and that's why it's always the grace of God you can't the Salvation is a free gift but you can't steal it it's the love of God it's the grace of God it's the mercy of God it's all God it's God and God and God and that's it it's the love of God that sent Christ into the world see it's it's a god whose Throne is established in Mercy David taught us and that God comes to you and begins to deal with you and gives you the ability to see his word now you got to make a choice amen amen and you should make the good one because he don't ever have to come back and do that again now the love of God causes him often to constrain people for years time and time and time again but he's not required to do that and I've known of cases where young people had already just teenagers and yet had already craw had already burned up all their chances and the tank was empty and they were never getting any of them back they were already had they had had already sealed their own destiny by their own choices that they did or didn't make but now as I said today we're trying to figure out what about you and I what about the believer who truly loves God and who truly believes the word but yet we struggle amen sometimes we find ourselves and we're even astonished at our own self could I have said that or thought that or did that or went there or had this and what am I doing see that's also the love of God who won't leave you alone that's also the love of God who'll drive you back to your knees because he frankly he loves you far too much to leave you like he finds you am why people who say they've come to him and there's no effective change they've never they've never met the one that came to me right right because his love is too great he wouldn't do that I'm not saying they didn't come into contact with the spirit I'm not even saying they didn't come into contact with the true anointing I'm just simply saying they didn't make the same choices I made because when I decided for Christ he he had one goal and I was all too happy to let him have it and that is that he became the ruler of my entire life and he changed say what did he changed he changed whatever he wanted to I didn't know what to change I just gave it all to him said you know the end from the beginning just just make me like I I need to be made Hallelujah that's why when a Believer comes to him and really they want Christ that's why we sing the song You Know take my houses my lands change my dreams and my plans for I'm placing my whole life in your hands take the dearest things to me if that's how it must be to Draw Me Closer To Thee see if the disappointments come lonely days without the sun you know yet yet in sorrow it it's you lord it's it's the Lord who's in control of my life so now this is this is an absolute requirement before this is a requirement to obtain the new birth this is a requirement in having the new birth but to be an overcomer this is a requirement to be a being born again being an overcomer yet to you've still got to have faith on that morning to change this body and and and I'm and God will use whatever Catalyst he has to do he has to use and I I'm grateful for that as well so we find then that regardless of it whatever position and today we're focusing on believers who are trying to overcome it begins with you agreeing with God's word for it to take effect I've said that now twice and I'm probably going to say it a few more times if you want the word of God to take effect in your life now if you don't want it okay then carry on and good luck with that but if but if you're here today and you want God's righteousness and you want to be an overcomer then I'm telling you it's going to require you to say today I will take every word no matter what it is and no matter what it says and no matter what it costs me and I won't just mentally believe it I'll go out of here and put wheels to it and I'll move it up the highway in faith I'll actually do it you must hear and recognize and act upon the word of God he sends it to be believed and lived he doesn't send the message to give us better Doctrine come on then manage thinkers amen he gives us an eagle anointing so we can get off the Earth Hallelujah so you have to begin by agreeing with God's word for every aspect of your life and what it's directing you to do what it's what it's calling for you to remove from your life and your activities it might lead you to a reconsideration of the friends you have the relationships you may be in your goals in life even your career path amen see which could need changing amen your friends might need changing your relationships might need changing your career path might need changing amen see the Holy Ghost can lead you and and and let me just say it like this the Holy Ghost can only lead you to the vision that God had of you before the foundation of the world Amen and there's no getting around that and that's that's unequivocal he can only lead you he can only lead you I want to say it like that he can only lead you with the vision that God had of you before the foundation of the world and he will not deviate from that for no one amen see frankly the bottom line is that as I said before he just loves you too much sometimes to allow the path of life or the elements in your life uh that you have chosen and you know I mean if you look back in the Old Testament even even things that you can see that when they got time to cross over under Joshua how many believe we're crossing over under Joshua that's the Holy Ghost take taking us in the promised land we realize that's the Holy Ghost but we also realize it's a it's it's a it's a it's a type of Crossing out of this world into a new world but I I get that brother Ram talks about they still had Wars and things so it's a type of the Holy Ghost not the Millennium not perfectly so so we find out the M the type of the Millennium came later under Solomon and so so so are you on your way to the Millennium well then let me tell you what happened to them when they were on their way see there were things in their life that Moses remember he was the meekest man on Earth wrote that himself about himself that there were things that Moses tolerated in the lives of the people that Joshua would not tolerate Joshua made them rededicate the whole Camp before they he would lead them across things that Moses allowed let me tell you something friends the closer we get to the Rapture of the thing that God required there was an increase it wasn't a time to go easy and move the ancient landmarks there wasn't a it wasn't a time to take the message that brought them out of Egypt and water it down it was a time to rededicate and reconsecrate as we get closer to crossing over the anointing from Heaven is here to establish the same standards of godliness because your type is Enoch yeah amen who walked with God and had this testimony that he pleased God and then God took him he was not because God took him brother brandham says now everything I've just said I'm going to prove to you in this quote in 1961 and brother brandham is preaching on the Book of Revelation chapter 4 part three and he's talking about chiefly coming to the new birth but as I said it's demon demonstrated that this is a an eternal principle before during and after the New Birth if you you want victory in your life and he says the only way that you can get this thing fixed in here is your own self will Hallelujah and he repeats himself your self-will W you have to will to do God's will good you have to get rid rid of your own will wow to let God's will come in amen for this is the only channel that leads to the heart so if you need a nature change you and you've never had it but you need it then you've got to be able to say Lord from today not my will come into my heart change my whole life and if that's already happened to you and you're a Believer today but you want to live overcoming and you wonder exactly why you can't You' got to say Lord change my will I'm going to empty out me so that you can be more this is in fact a greatly overlooked element in my view in the power of transformation and is precisely why although you may have a new birth this is precisely why even with the new birth and your continued growth this is exactly why God cannot and will not as a prophet taught push you through a pipe or a form or a mold amen and then you know push you through a form and shape you pour you into a mold take you out push you through a you know something and then pull you out and say oh what a wonderful Overcomer he's not going to push you through a a a forming pipe called an overcomer pipe he doesn't have a mold that says I'm just going to pour you in into it and let you dry and open up you'll be an overcomer that's not how it works see you've got a you've got a a part to play in this you've got to be willing to get things out of your life and get things out of your home and get things out you've got to be willing to change those friends if he needs you to change those relationships if he needs you to change that career path if he needs you to amen amen praise the Lord you know did you just notice why I didn't stop when someone went out because that's a pregnant lady who needs to go out but teenagers don't need to be running in and out amen see don't do that stop doing that amen am little sweeties thank you brother Luther it's awesome when the next hit man still loves you hallelujah amen don't make sister Melissa shout amen so so this is a greatly overlooked element in the whole power of transformation because a lot of times people have have repented and and they have offered their hearts to the Lord Jesus and they are True Believers of every word of God for this hour amen but day after day their their Earthly Journey and I and and there's been I I I can I can so relate to what I wrote myself cuz I can I can I can painfully remember times when this was me I can painfully painfully remember times when this is too close to me now yes amen see but we find that sometimes day after day even as Believers our Earthly journey and our service to the Lord we have sometimes such struggles in our flesh and we wonder why yes amen we wonder why the power of transformation does not seem to do its Supernatural work in us we read stories of other great people and the power of God that made them Overcomers don't don't lose sight of the fact friends that you're living in an impossible age and you're living in a time where it's so wicked and it's so evil I'm just so glad there's such a Grace that can still look at my life and it can still say grace and grace and grace and grace in fact is it is his constant Grace that causes me to want to be an overcomer even more see and then of course then Satan comes along and uh and he and he whispers to that person that well it's because the word isn't true or it's because the message isn't true or it's or it's because well the supernatural doesn't work like that anymore and even if it does it doesn't work like that see but the real problem friends the the the real problem is not that the Supernatural is just a myth the real problem is within the person yes amen and it begins with a refusal to surrender to the will of God's word at the onset of hearing it amen amen and I'm talking about something as simple as you said in church and you hear anointed preaching I've been right there and had the Lord come across the pull pit from a preacher who knows nothing that I'm in that struggle with that certain thing and the Lord is saying the reason you're struggling is because this is feeding it if you get rid of these you wouldn't have that struggle and then I got to make a decision will I get rid of them or will I not and it's really that simple it's not rocket science to be an overcomer you're already halfway there with the New Birth you already got a head start on the devil Stop Believing his lie that you can't give those things up you can amen and then when you're willing to then the supernatural power will give you the ability to keep them out of your life so when you sit under anointed Ministry year after year but you're simply not willing to accept and follow God's instructions from his word with all of your heart whether that comes from hearing the scriptures read reading them yourself whether it comes from a a message book or or whether he sent a or the fact that you listen to a Vindicated Prophet or or a Vindicated Pastor the power of transformation that comes from the Holy Ghost it cannot have full controlling power in your life he wants that yes amen but you're blocking it amen wow amen amen and I've heard some people say well it's because they're not born again I'm living evidence that's not true not in every case it might be true it's not true in me I've had times where I wouldn't listen to his voice and paid a price but I knew I was born again I knew I'd pass from Death to life because I have no more conscience of sin all my desire for the world is gone I don't even desire to desire it I desire to not desire it I desire to be free of it amen there's no workarounds for this friend I'm going to read it again the only way you can get this thing fixed in here is your own self-will Hallelujah your self- willll you have to will to do God's will you have to get rid of your own will to let God's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart 19 then a year later 1962 the spoken word is Original Seed now others will go by and say well you know what I believe I'll try it a while he says you'll choke I believe I'll try it a while I'm going to give that a try you'll choke amen but when you really empty out amen wow when you really empty out say Lord Jesus no more me but you from this on then it's going to bring forth a 100 F amen he comes about 8 months later in the message dedication and if we if we'll come back to the original dedication and we'll open our heart now he's talking to Believers people who are born again of the spirit and he's saying if we'll come back to the original dedication and we'll open our hearts and here it is again empty ourselves God in dedication as we give it to him as we give it to him as we give it to him will fill our temple with his shise God that's me Glory he says then the Living God then the Living God will be moving in a Living Church among a living people and it will spread forth his glory then you'll be a witness to Nations and peoples and kings and tongues because now we find out that it's a living God in a Living Church living in living people amen and that's when it'll spread forth his glory that wonderful anointing that we feel from the word of God settling in on this bride and creating in her and I know you have an affinity with this it it seems like every day and I've had the testimony of so many people even recently that that testify to a to a deepening to a to a growing desire to be lifted up you know uh into this new day that we see Dawning we we sense that the that the change is coming we sense that the age is about to recycle we sense that this Earth is passing away this world's order is passing away we sense that there's going to be a marriage supper and soon we sense that Moses and Elijah are ready to go to Israel we sense that the Saints are ready for hundreds of years oh come back among us and we sense that nearness I'm here to tell you friends I sense it I trust you sense it and there's a deepening anointing that is calling for a greater dedication a greater consecration that's why the Holy Spirit has been has has even preached this whole series and we've dealt so much with the token and it's not hardship amen as I said uh one or two uh sermons ago you know and it's not because of promised Treasures I I you know I read a long time ago an advice from U from a theology professor and he was counseling young ministers and he said was almost like a sales pitch and he said if you ever want to have plenty of people to preach to he said just preach to Broken Hearts now that's there's not I'm not saying that's bad in and of itself I'm just simply saying that you can see in their mind that that psychological only approach that that doesn't really take in the real the real dynamics that can make Christian psychology live is the Holy Ghost it can make it in said Christian psychology that oh psychology psychology that's that's on tape that's brother ad's words he talks about things that are in the mind and psychology and things like that you know so we're not we're not saying that that stuff's not valid I'm just simply saying without the dynamic of the Holy Ghost that only has its it's like Brother JD said it's just training from the outside in but we're trying to get it from the inside out amen it's instructions on how to live instructions how to have a healthy marriage instructions on how to have a healthy home and children and church and a testimony so who could possibly be against that see so so it's it's not that I want to preach to Broken Hearts it's not about I it's not because we're here today and oh I just want to go to heaven because I have such hardships and I have such trials and oh poor me and oh I just need out and it's not that amen nor is it like glory to God streets of gold walls of Jasper mansion on the hillside Liv in a palace fly like jump Cloud to cloud like Super Mario right your it's none of that I'm I'm quite sure I'll love our Dwelling Place amen but it's not about hardship wanting out it's not about Treasures unseen it's about a land where everything is Holiness and everything is righteousness and everything is clean and everything is pure and Satan is Bound for a thousand years [Music] amen and we can walk freely through the Earth and love and love one another and never have to worry be in a body impervious to Temptation see so it's a deepening desire for righteousness and Purity and and and I'll just tell you something friends you know and I and if this is you I I I I'm gonna pray harder for you I mean you might be here today and here I am talking about this this deepening this anointing and and you might not sense it at all but I just want to say to you it's all around you it's around you right now some brother Brown talks about people raising their hand sometimes we he would say how many want me to pray for you raise your hand he said and he talks about how raise up that hand up into those Angelic atmospheres almost like an antenna plug you into the supernatural give you what you need amen those things are real a prophet saw into those Realms he knew those anointings moving across he he talks in one place where you turn around in a great anointed meeting and this is a total paraphrase I remember brother Matt uh Watkins talking about it sometime and he said you you turn around and bump into somebody and turn around and nobody's there he said you don't realize just bumped into an angel who's moving up and down passing out blessings I just say come on up here Lord move up here move in these aisles move among these people hallelujah it's all around you brother brandham says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed this is if you're born again this is a true statement about you why do you hunger Church yes why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you wow Glory see this is what is what I'm preaching I'm preaching this hidden secret that it's here now and it's happening in real time and you can be a part of it see he says why do you thirst it's the why do you hunger it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you now you're going to find out what the hidden secret is at the end here it is you want me to go ahead and give you the secret at the end of the paragraph the last day is here that's the secret it's not just going to go on and on and on and on so he says why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you born again people who love the Lord with the gene of God and been born by the Holy Spirit but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungering it's God trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation the last day is here amen now it's not just limited to that it's the whole revelation of Jesus Christ and and that that indicates to you the last day is here because that was a promised restoration when it was the last day amen and there's no substitute I want to say to you today that there is no substitute of this world Amen that will give you that kind of fulfillment that the Life of Christ brings amen Paul sums it up well Zoe let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 I'm quickly Running Out of Time Ephesians chapter 2 Paul sums it up well beginning in verse 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved amen and hath raised us up together and made us to sit made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now here's why he did it here here's the here's what's behind it all that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus amen see so there's a purpose behind so that so that so that we should not allow Satan now Paul is is giving you who you are this is your identity he's got a great love by which he loved us even when we he loved us even when we were dead in sins and trespasses and he hath quickened us together with Grace by grace or with Grace uh by grace are you saved and he ha he didn't stop there and he's raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the whole purpose is so you can know who you are so you can know what the program is so you can get with it eat the book be a living testimony and and and understand who the bride is and and separate it clearly in your mind that this m message is not like any other message in the earth and this bride is not like the rest of the Christian World she's not like her in fact is with every day that that uh nominal Christian world gets further and further into ungodliness and we're getting higher and higher into righteousness the more distinction there is and we should never allow Satan to steal our identity in Christ amen because if the enemy if he can obscure who you are to you who you are why you're here and what you are to do and most importantly what you are to be amen amen if he can do that then you will never you'll never reach the level of living in the the image of God that you were made for placed here for you'll never get in the position to fulfill the words in Revelation 10 thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings and that's what it comes down to today friends is that God has indeed sent us a word that can change our hearts change our lives change our minds am but you've got to be willing you've got to be willing brother brandham talks about in the restoration of the brid tree I don't have time to get to it today we're GNA going to hit a pause button here in a few minutes but brother Bram talks about in the restoration of the brid tree and that it is coming back and and I would say today not just is has amen where all all of the fruit is back in the top of the tree ripening in the presence of the Sun and I'm here to tell you something friends if the world has you thinking if the world has you thinking that it's just going to go on and on and on and on please don't fall for that delusional lie of the devil because the world around you is collapsing the world around you is in Anarchy the world around you uh Law and Order are F failing Justice is failing political uh uh thinking has failed governments have failed the church has failed families have failed it's it's a whole world filled with naked vulgarity and it and it's it has every sign that God said would be of perilous times and every description that was to be and not only just to be but to be loud and to be out there and to be at a high level of of men who are truce Breakers and false accusers and incontinent and Fierce and despisers of those that are good men and women who are heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than they are lovers of God this is what this is why you exactly why you find in nominal churches their their the the the vulgarity of even their worship services that go on and the vulgarity of how they live and how they conduct themselves I was reading the other day somebody posted and and I and I and I thought you know I I'm while at the same time this person you know the unbeliever is just going to find reasons to unbelieve the heathen's going to rage the heathen's always going to rage you're not going to stop him you know even God ask the question why does the Heathen rage you know and so and the question is almost rhetorical because God is basically saying it ain't going to do you no good you know you're not going to overthrow me why why you rage you know why why will you die he asked some people he asked his own Nation why will you die why why will you not come to me and live Jesus comes around and identifies himself with that same being who asked Israel that from above through a prophet Jesus comes in the flesh and says you won't come to me that you might receive life he's the same one back there said why why will you not come to me see so so so we we see these patterns in the world friends and and we realize that it's passing away and the reason that you see the degradation in nominal Christianity is you say but they love God uh yes they do the problem is they're lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God remember I said to you there's a a grand there's a Grand Canyon siiz difference between having a love for God and having the love of God those are not even in the same ballpark having a love for God people have wonderful warm fuzzy thoughts about God and they talk about him and they they sing songs about him and I'm not against that I'm not against those people maybe they've just never heard the message of the hour we you should pray if you love them and you want to try to help them then you've got a commission to eat the book and become the book and then you can testify to Nations and peoples and tongues and kings then you can be an effective witness but you're never going to be an effective witness if you sit in a message church year after year after year and the word of God calls for elements in your life that need to go and you won't obey that you you are never going to get to the top of the mountain because you are breaking the First Fundamental rule that is the foundation the foundation of getting to the top of the pyramid is Faith amen you've got to to believe and accept every word even if you can't muster the strength to do it you've still got to acknowledge it own it and say Lord God help me Lord God help me how many want to do that today say Lord I I I I I'm weak but Thou Art strong and the Bible says let let the redeemed of the Lord say so let the weak say I'm strong amen I'm not going to keep giving credit to the devil I already the devil tells me I got this weakness and that one no kidding I already know that but I also got a word that promised me I could be an overcomer I've already been converted I've already passed from Death to life and I already have an anointing coalescing around me that's Lifting me Higher and I want that in my life friend I want that in my life let's stand to our feet amen amen praise the Lord might need a part 11 definitely going to need another sermon prise god um brother Bradley I want that old him of the church pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling is I always come to that part and I say Lord Do not pass me by while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by is that your desire today amen let's bow our heads Lord I stand here and I I have a little better understanding of to go I felt determined to try to manipulate it Lord I've waited months to get to a certain part of the material and you've held me back yet again today oddly strangely to my own mind but yet at the same time Spirit now enough's been said and hearts are open and evil spirits are driven back so that Faith Can strike Lord I commit this audience into your hands this audience who are here today have come here they've listened to the foolishness of preaching they've sat patiently and kind L Lord and they pulled on the word of God now would you reward them Lord reward them for their obedience to come to your house because the word says that you ought to do that would you reward them Lord for their patience and their diligence to say Amen to the word and to make the Holy Spirit feel welcome to make me feel like I had a liberty to preach Lord I'm committing them into your hands there's great needs Lord I have needs they have needs needs the the invisible audience out across the air they have needs lord they're holding them up to you right now so I pray master that you'll do that that work that power that Wonder
