[5:40] idea or thought that we would have had
[5:42] to but Lord that we would meet to hear a
[5:45] word from you Lord that you could speak
[5:47] to us and speak to our hearts bring
[5:51] forth uh a a word father that would
[5:54] encourage us that would energize us Lord
[5:57] that we could take hold of it and build
[5:58] our faith that our faith Faith could
[5:59] grow with the hearing of the word Lord
[6:02] we could recognize you in every chapter
[6:03] and
[6:04] verse as we go and father that we could
[6:08] fight back against the enemy in this day
[6:11] and age in which all the world has
[6:14] United to come against you father that
[6:17] we would stand against it all in your
[6:19] name so father we ask you would be here
[6:22] with us we invite you here Lord knowing
[6:25] that knowing and expecting you to come
[6:27] we ask these things in the name of the
[6:29] Lord Jesus Christ
[6:30] amen if you would turn in our Bibles
[6:35] to um Genesis chapter
[6:40] 1 and verse 26 it's going to be
[6:44] continuation of last week's material
[6:49] um pull it up
[6:53] here Genesis chapter 1
[6:59] verse
[7:02] 26 it says and God said let us make man
[7:06] in our image after our likeness and let
[7:09] them have dominion over the fish of the
[7:11] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[7:13] over the
[7:14] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[7:16] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[7:18] the Earth so God created man in his own
[7:21] image and the image of God created he
[7:23] him male and female created he them and
[7:26] God blessed them and God said unto them
[7:28] be fruitful and multip mly and replenish
[7:30] the Earth and subdue it and have
[7:33] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[7:35] over the fowl of the air and over every
[7:37] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[7:40] amen y'all could be seated so as a quick
[7:44] review I hopefully we'll make it a quick
[7:46] review I am the worst when it comes to
[7:49] reviews um they're oftentimes not quick
[7:54] um but uh just quickly go over what we
[7:57] dis uh spoke on uh last Sunday how um
[8:04] this quote right this quote from
[8:06] marriage and divorce um we'll just read
[8:08] it again now it says remember Adam was
[8:10] both masculine and feminist in the
[8:13] original creation one but then he was
[8:15] separated by a rib notice but a
[8:18] byproduct and notice the only one of all
[8:19] God's creation of every animal and
[8:21] anything else she was the only one
[8:23] designed this way every other female was
[8:25] in the original creation every other
[8:27] female was in the original creation but
[8:29] Eve was not in the original creation see
[8:33] that had to be made that way we'll get
[8:35] to it after a while notice in this
[8:37] creation that she was not in the
[8:40] original but a byproduct and in this
[8:42] creation now I don't want to hurt your
[8:44] feelings but I want to tell you the
[8:45] truth and you just sit still you're
[8:47] doing nice okay so I would again like to
[8:52] point out that even brother branom
[8:53] recognized that when he said it a lot of
[8:56] people were going to choke on it right
[8:59] this is not something that is going to
[9:02] naturally you're just going to
[9:03] immediately read this and go ah this
[9:05] makes me feel nice
[9:08] right um and you know after spending a
[9:12] lot of time studying this it you know
[9:14] honestly what it it reminded me of is
[9:16] when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh
[9:18] and drink my blood you'll have no part
[9:20] with me right and so
[9:23] when all of his all these people who are
[9:27] following him packed up and left they
[9:29] said this guy's crazy he's a cannibal
[9:30] vampire weirdo and we're not going to
[9:32] follow this be elub this guy who's
[9:35] talking about some weird flesh eating
[9:38] cult that's hideous we're not going to
[9:39] be part of that right well but then when
[9:43] he turns to the to the 12 and says
[9:45] aren't you going to leave also notice
[9:46] what they did not say was that it didn't
[9:48] bother
[9:49] them right they didn't understand it
[9:52] very well either but what they
[9:54] recognized was in spite of the fact that
[9:56] it bothered them that they didn't
[9:58] understand it right even they might not
[10:00] have even recognized that they didn't
[10:01] understand it they just knew that it
[10:02] bothered
[10:03] them but they also recognized that this
[10:05] man had the words of eternal life and so
[10:07] they weren't going to walk away from
[10:08] that no matter how much it bothered them
[10:10] right and so that's kind of you know so
[10:12] many people will see a quote like this
[10:14] and it'll it'll get under their skin and
[10:16] they'll go oh well I'm not going to
[10:17] stand for this this is some sort of
[10:19] misogynistic you know woman hating thing
[10:22] and so I'm not going to be part of that
[10:23] like I'm I'm you
[10:25] know and so or or or and this is the
[10:29] other side of it and hopefully I'll get
[10:30] to this here in a minute what people
[10:33] will do is they'll read a quote like
[10:34] this and then very conveniently skip
[10:35] over and say I just won't think about
[10:37] that quote too much I'll accept all the
[10:39] message except for quotes like this
[10:41] right it's like well okay well now you
[10:43] also have a problem right you got to
[10:44] accept the whole message everything you
[10:47] know when brother Bram says it makes a
[10:49] statement like this he's he's not making
[10:51] the statement on his own authority he's
[10:52] making it because it came directly out
[10:53] of what we just read right came directly
[10:56] out of Genesis chapter 1 so it's not
[10:59] brother brandom's opinion on this point
[11:01] it's directly it is it is the word of
[11:04] God it's from Genesis right
[11:06] so you know when people want to reject a
[11:08] statement like this and say well I don't
[11:10] like that it doesn't make me feel good
[11:12] um what they're saying is Well there's
[11:15] part of the word that I don't want to
[11:16] accept that's right okay so but if you
[11:20] stick with it right it because the
[11:22] disciples were willing to stick with
[11:23] brother brandom or I'm sorry stick with
[11:25] uh the with with Christ rather am um
[11:28] sorry um um the uh because they were
[11:31] willing to stick with Christ even though
[11:33] he said something that bothered them
[11:35] ultimately they got to the Fulfillment
[11:36] of that scripture and it was something
[11:38] wonderful and beautiful they that that
[11:40] is still an ordinance in in the church
[11:42] today right it it it it has become you
[11:45] know it became a beautiful thing once
[11:47] they caught the revelation of what he
[11:48] was talking about but you got to stick
[11:51] with him through the
[11:53] misunderstanding to get to the
[11:55] Revelation right
[11:57] so um anyway so uh we talked about how
[12:02] um if my oh I got to turn it on first it
[12:04] works better if you turn it on um so we
[12:07] talked about this this is just a quick
[12:09] just a example right you could nothing
[12:12] too complicated
[12:14] um the uh if you uh but you know
[12:17] hopefully you can just at least see that
[12:18] the colors are just represented
[12:20] different different chemicals in the
[12:21] reaction and that you can track it all
[12:22] the way through and you can see that in
[12:24] any chemical reaction the byproducts are
[12:26] an inevitability of the reaction anytime
[12:29] you have a reaction you will have
[12:30] byproducts it is just the way it works
[12:33] right it is like saying I'm going to cut
[12:35] a 3ft 2x4 out of a 1ot 2x4 well guess
[12:38] what you're going to have a one or a 3ft
[12:41] 2X out of a 4ft 2x4 you're going to have
[12:42] a 1ot 2x4 at the end of that no matter
[12:44] how you want to do it right there's no
[12:46] way to do that um you will end up
[12:50] with two halves of this right well if
[12:53] Adam is the product and Eva is the
[12:55] byproduct the result she was the
[12:57] byproduct because she was in the
[12:58] original creation as well right when it
[13:01] said let us make man in our image male
[13:04] and female created he them Eve was in
[13:06] that right Eve was the female in that
[13:09] amen right and they and she's not an
[13:13] afterthought she's not a waste product
[13:16] she's not trash to be disposed of she's
[13:19] not something to be trotten on she is as
[13:23] much an intended result of this process
[13:26] as Adam was okay
[13:30] the the
[13:35] um right so uh
[13:39] when uh my notes
[13:43] here and the reason she was this way
[13:46] right is because they were both made
[13:48] together in the image of Christ or in
[13:50] the image of God now hopefully I'll be
[13:54] able to Circle back to this it's a point
[13:55] I want to dwell on a little bit um but
[13:58] we also talked about how you know when
[13:59] people in this modern society
[14:03] people don't want to be you know we see
[14:06] it as some sort of hideous thing right
[14:08] people get get you know get their
[14:09] hackles up when you say oh a woman is a
[14:11] byproduct of a man oh well how dare you
[14:14] I a strong independent woman don't need
[14:16] no man right and it we don't like the
[14:19] idea that a woman has to be subservient
[14:21] to a man because of you know a hundred
[14:23] years of of feminism that that teach us
[14:26] things that are literally contrary to
[14:28] the order that God has laid out and so
[14:30] it it it's built into the into the
[14:32] subconscious of of the modern world that
[14:35] anytime a woman is seen as submissive
[14:40] that it's seen as belittling or or or
[14:43] wrong and that we shouldn't stand for
[14:45] that but the reality is that it was the
[14:48] it was the way God intended that's the
[14:50] way God created people right and so of
[14:54] all the females that God created in the
[14:56] beginning the woman was the only one
[14:59] that was created as a byproduct she's
[15:01] the only one that makes her special
[15:03] right that means it was important that
[15:06] means it wasn't just something that we
[15:07] shouldn't just move past that we should
[15:10] think about that for a minute why was
[15:12] she intentionally made that way on
[15:15] purpose as opposed to all the other
[15:17] animals right and so you know we look at
[15:20] all these other animals in which you
[15:23] see a single
[15:25] male and a bunch of females right
[15:27] there's one rooster many hens one bull
[15:30] elk many cow elk one male lion many
[15:34] lionesses right why because these are
[15:37] all animals that were in which the
[15:39] females were in the original
[15:42] creation and they organized themselves
[15:45] this way and we can see here in Isaiah
[15:47] chap 4:1 and in that day seven women
[15:49] shall take hold of one man saying we
[15:51] will eat our own bread and wear our own
[15:52] apparel and let us be called by thy name
[15:55] to take away our reproach
[15:57] okay when when we move away from a
[16:01] society in which you have one man being
[16:03] the leadership of his home and one woman
[16:05] being the wife in that home and being
[16:07] submissive to the man's Authority when
[16:09] we move away from that when we move away
[16:11] from the marital structure that God laid
[16:12] out then we end up with a beast a
[16:15] beastial relationship structure we we
[16:18] end up with an animalistic system
[16:21] because after all if you want a pattern
[16:22] your if if the women want to be like all
[16:25] the other females in the original
[16:27] creation well then they're going to end
[16:28] end up like all the other females in the
[16:30] original creation right you're going to
[16:31] end up with a with a a system like we
[16:34] have today that the scripture prophesied
[16:37] would happen Okay we would end up with a
[16:39] system in which you have you know you
[16:42] have a a a small group of men who in
[16:46] that all these women chase after and you
[16:48] end up with a single motherhood epidemic
[16:52] that is breaking the family structure of
[16:54] the entire world right um and and the
[16:59] reality is uh okay we'll get to that in
[17:03] a
[17:05] second this
[17:08] thing's there we go all
[17:11] right what ends up
[17:13] happening is that because men and women
[17:15] were not designed to live this kind of
[17:17] way right because men were built to be
[17:21] the leaders of their homes and women
[17:23] were built to be able to depend upon
[17:26] their men
[17:27] as leaders and providers and protectors
[17:31] and be able to submit to that Authority
[17:33] and be comfortable in doing so and not
[17:36] afraid of what that man is going to do
[17:39] to
[17:41] her because we've gotten away from that
[17:45] system well it's no wonder that
[17:48] we're uh we're having massive mental
[17:50] health problems oh yeah right you know
[17:53] it's not a all right just some
[17:57] statistics and um so I I actually read
[18:00] this today um in preparation for
[18:03] this in so they did a study in which
[18:07] they showed that in N they compared the
[18:09] the uh teenagers and college age
[18:13] people um high school and college age uh
[18:16] people from 1936 to
[18:19] 2007 and what they found was that the
[18:22] children or the you know young people in
[18:24] that age range were seven or eight times
[18:28] more likely to be diagnosed with
[18:30] depression than in
[18:32] 1936 in 2007 they are seven or eight
[18:35] times more likely to be depressed than
[18:37] they were in
[18:37] 1936 okay in the last 25 years alone
[18:41] okay this is from the year 2000 to the
[18:43] year
[18:44] 2004 suicide has gone up
[18:46] 36% am okay any other disease any other
[18:50] major fatal disease and that went up in
[18:53] 36% in 25 years people would be ripping
[18:55] their hair out trying to figure out what
[18:57] is happening what what's in the food
[18:59] what's in the water what is in our
[19:01] environment that's causing this kind of
[19:03] massive spike in in in fatal mortality
[19:07] right like mortality rates it's not okay
[19:10] um we know that mental health has
[19:13] declined over the last 100 years we know
[19:15] this it is you like researchers have
[19:17] been able to prove this unequivocably
[19:20] today if you walk into any crowded place
[19:23] right go to go to Walmart on a nice
[19:25] crowded day in Walmart and walk through
[19:26] Walmart and just know you can just know
[19:29] because based on statistics that when
[19:30] you walk through Walmart every third
[19:32] woman that you see will be diagnosed
[19:35] with
[19:36] depression one out of three one out of
[19:39] three women are diagnosed with
[19:40] depression one out of four are diagnosed
[19:42] with diagnosed with an anxiety disorder
[19:45] am okay that's a problem that's a
[19:48] massive problem think of any other
[19:50] disease and think yeah at any given
[19:51] point one out of three you know people
[19:54] are going to be diagnosed with that
[19:55] disease and we call that a massive
[19:58] problem
[20:01] right um and we wonder why are women
[20:05] anxi have uh oh this is another another
[20:07] statistic I don't have the exact I
[20:09] didn't have time to pull the exact
[20:10] number on this but one of the things
[20:12] that they found with the um explosion of
[20:14] the transgender movement right you know
[20:19] men having confusion and thinking
[20:20] they're women has been a problem for a
[20:22] long time that's not a new phenomenon
[20:24] per se though it might be a little bit
[20:26] more prevalent today it was always kind
[20:27] of known to
[20:29] exist but young girls thinking they're
[20:32] boys is kind of new it's it has exploded
[20:36] in the last year to the point where
[20:37] we're talking like you know
[20:39] 10,000% increases in in reported
[20:43] incidents of this
[20:44] happening why why is this new thing
[20:47] suddenly happening out of the
[20:49] blue and if you if you look at the if
[20:52] you look at the um what they call
[20:55] comorbidities right where they say all
[20:57] right here's a girl who is been
[20:58] clinically diagnosed with gender
[21:00] dysphoria what else was going on in her
[21:02] life well typically one of the core
[21:06] fundamental princip like things that is
[21:08] you that is uh shared across all of
[21:10] these cases is that there are young
[21:12] girls who have severe issues with um uh
[21:18] uh lost the lost the word um like uh um
[21:22] insecurity body
[21:24] insecurity which by the way is also this
[21:27] same pattern follows the U self harm
[21:31] epidemics that we've seen it follows the
[21:33] um anxiety and eating disorder epidemics
[21:35] that we've seen and they all have share
[21:36] the exact same
[21:37] coties so it's it's not a Myster like
[21:41] it's what we're seeing is that we're is
[21:43] that these mental health problems where
[21:44] we're seeing insecurities and anxieties
[21:46] and depressions and all of these things
[21:48] attacking people in this Modern Age that
[21:50] didn't happen a 100 years ago and it's
[21:53] almost as if it's almost as if the
[21:56] structure that God set up in which a man
[21:59] a headship could make his wives and his
[22:03] wife and his daughters feel secure and
[22:06] protected and provided for and safe and
[22:10] and and when she's feeling miserable
[22:12] about herself he can he can be the
[22:14] Romantic one to make her feel better and
[22:17] feel desired and wanted and pretty this
[22:21] this is what a man does this is what his
[22:22] purpose in life is to do right like this
[22:25] is what drives a man I mean because why
[22:28] cuz he's made in the image of God and
[22:30] what God did was that when his bride was
[22:35] feeling rejected he made sure he got
[22:38] crucified to make her feel
[22:40] forgiven right because because God is
[22:43] romantic God is the most romantic person
[22:45] that has ever existed oh yeah right and
[22:49] when a man is who is made in the image
[22:51] of God is operating in the way that he
[22:53] was intended to be intended to operate
[22:56] amen he's going to fulfill all of those
[22:58] needs in his wife and in the and and and
[23:01] he's going to be that headship for his
[23:02] daughters and be the pattern of the men
[23:04] that she's supposed to seek after right
[23:07] and he's going to fulfill those needs
[23:08] for his daughters so that you don't deal
[23:10] with these problems yeah right I mean
[23:12] sure every every woman's going to feel
[23:15] insecure but that's why she has a man to
[23:16] help her feel
[23:17] secure right like you know I you know
[23:21] and and
[23:22] likewise young men or or just men in
[23:25] general only function correctly when
[23:28] they're have a responsibility of a wife
[23:31] and a family to provide and protect
[23:34] right when men have a purpose of being
[23:37] then they perform well right they will
[23:40] go to work when they feel like they have
[23:42] a wife to take care of right when they
[23:44] have children to take care of they will
[23:47] go to work and they will provide because
[23:49] they bet they there's something inside
[23:51] that makes them do it
[23:53] right
[23:56] there's it's not a so look in in in in
[23:59] suicide statistics 80% of suicides are
[24:02] men
[24:04] 80% and they have gone up radically over
[24:07] time and I guarantee you I guarantee you
[24:10] and because we have the data on this
[24:13] that the vast majority of the men who
[24:14] are committing suicide are doing it when
[24:16] they lose their family yeah when they no
[24:19] longer have a family to provide for and
[24:21] protect when they are removed from their
[24:23] god-given role and responsibility when
[24:25] they no longer have someone to lay their
[24:27] life down for then they have no purpose
[24:29] of being and it's not a mystery because
[24:32] even God didn't want to exist without a
[24:35] bride even God said my existence is
[24:38] pointless and meaningless unless I have
[24:39] a
[24:40] bride right so when we when we blow up
[24:43] the nuclear family and we say well we're
[24:45] not going to pattern our lives and our
[24:47] marriages and our lifestyles after the
[24:49] word of God after Humanity was designed
[24:51] to be it's not a mystery why we're
[24:54] suddenly dealing with all these mental
[24:55] health problems it's not a mystery why I
[24:58] mean look we're designed where our
[25:00] brains are wired to operate in a certain
[25:01] kind of environment if you take a fish
[25:03] out of the water and put them in a
[25:05] bucket full of chocolate pudding he's
[25:07] not going to function correctly right if
[25:09] you take humans out of the environment
[25:11] and the structure in which they were
[25:13] designed to be they're not going to
[25:15] function correctly they're going to be
[25:17] depressed anxious and
[25:25] suicidal and I didn't mean to get off on
[25:27] that as long as as I did but
[25:31] um I but it all wraps back I want to I
[25:34] want to pick up Ephesians chapter 5 here
[25:36] I'm going to read read it very quickly
[25:38] um you don't have to turn because I I
[25:39] have very little time left and I want to
[25:41] keep keep moving here um so Ephesians
[25:43] chapter 5:22 it says wives submit
[25:44] yourselves to your own husbands as unto
[25:46] the Lord for the husband is the head of
[25:47] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[25:48] the church and he is the savior of the
[25:51] body therefore as the church is subject
[25:52] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[25:54] own husbands in everything okay why why
[25:59] why does this this did Paul say this
[26:00] because he's he's recognizing that that
[26:02] that that Adam and Eve were patterned
[26:04] after Christ and the bride right that's
[26:07] who Adam and Eve were patterned after
[26:09] because before the foundation of the
[26:10] world there was a lamb slain right and
[26:12] if there was a slain lamb then there was
[26:14] redeemed of that blood as well right you
[26:17] you're not going to slay a lamb unless
[26:18] there's something to slay a lamb for
[26:20] right so if Christ existed before the
[26:22] foundation of the world and so did the
[26:23] bride okay where was job before the
[26:25] found you know when the sons of God
[26:26] Sayang for for joy you know
[26:29] where um and so because they're meeting
[26:33] that same pattern therefore we don't we
[26:36] don't look at God and say well God you
[26:38] have to submit to my authority as the
[26:39] church no we submit to God as the as
[26:42] Christ is the masculine Christ is the
[26:44] dominant figure in the or the the um the
[26:48] um uh the the leadership he's Christ is
[26:51] the headship in this relationship and so
[26:53] the church submits to the headship not
[26:56] the other way around and likewise wives
[26:59] should submit to their husbands because
[27:00] he's the leadership in the situation
[27:02] when there's a great quote I don't I
[27:04] didn't have it with me it just came to
[27:05] me now where brother bandham says you
[27:07] know talking about a a woman trying to
[27:09] take leadership over a man and he tells
[27:10] that he says boys you better not let her
[27:13] she'll uh he said she'll rule over you
[27:16] if you let her and she'll hate you for
[27:17] it okay women are not designed to be
[27:21] leaders be in leadership positions in
[27:23] the home they would prefer the man to be
[27:25] the leadership position right but if in
[27:28] so if you make her be the leadership
[27:29] position guess what she'll do it and
[27:31] she'll hate you for it right and
[27:36] so the wife would rather allow the man
[27:39] to be the leader allow him to be the
[27:41] hero right allow him to be able to to to
[27:45] lay his life down for her it makes her
[27:47] feel loved okay in in verse 25 it says
[27:51] husbands love your wives Jesus Christ
[27:53] also loved the church and gave himself
[27:54] for it that he might sanctify and
[27:56] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[27:58] the word uh What uh yeah um I'm going to
[28:02] kind of skip down a little bit um for
[28:05] this
[28:06] cause for no man shall ever yet um hate
[28:09] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[28:11] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[28:13] church for we are members of his body of
[28:15] his flesh and of his bones for this
[28:16] cause shall a man leave his father and
[28:17] his mother and shall be joined unto his
[28:19] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[28:21] this is a great mystery but I see but I
[28:23] speak concerning Christ in the church
[28:25] nevertheless let every one of you in
[28:27] particular so love his wife even as
[28:29] himself and the wies see that she
[28:31] reverence her husband now I would like
[28:33] to point something out here it says
[28:35] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[28:38] husbands as unto the Lord and then in
[28:41] verse 25 it says husbands love your
[28:43] wives even as Christ also loved the
[28:45] church and gave himself for it hm that's
[28:48] interesting the Commandment to the women
[28:49] is to submit and the Commandment to the
[28:52] men is to
[28:54] love hm all right so I had somebody
[28:57] there there's a kind of a thought
[28:58] experiment that you can do ladies when
[29:00] you next time you have a a minute with
[29:03] your man ask your husband whether he
[29:06] would rather be loved or
[29:10] respected okay and I guarantee you I I I
[29:14] say guarantee nine times out of 10 okay
[29:16] vast majority of the time the man is
[29:18] going to is going to say that's the same
[29:21] thing you I do not feel loved if I do
[29:24] not feel respected right when a woman
[29:28] woman respects her headship that's how
[29:30] she makes him feel loved right and she's
[29:34] got three
[29:35] verses Paul gives her three verses of
[29:37] commentary on love on how to a woman can
[29:41] properly make her man feel loved and he
[29:43] gives him like eight verses right
[29:47] because for her it's simple just submit
[29:50] to the headship that's what you do to
[29:52] make him feel cared for for him he's got
[29:55] a that's a little bit of a different
[29:57] project because now is it's it's not as
[29:59] simple as that it's you better provide
[30:01] you better protect you better go a whole
[30:03] bunch of extra miles right there's you
[30:06] better sacrifice why because it's all
[30:10] going back to the relationship of of
[30:14] Christ and the
[30:18] bride and it notice here that here's
[30:20] here's Paul saying that there's a great
[30:22] mystery in all of this he says um this
[30:25] is a great mystery but I speak
[30:27] concerning Christ in the church so
[30:29] here's Paul saying recognizing that when
[30:31] we're talking about marriage and divorce
[30:33] we're not talking about human Affairs
[30:35] per se we're talking about spiritual
[30:38] Affairs that are only playing out in the
[30:40] natural
[30:41] world right because the natural types
[30:44] the spiritual what we see in the natural
[30:46] world 100% is a reflection of what's
[30:48] happening in the spiritual world when we
[30:50] see a modern environment in which the
[30:52] authority of men is completely cut
[30:55] down right that the men are no longer
[30:57] expected to be leaders in their
[31:00] homes then it's not any wonder why God
[31:04] is removed his leadership over the
[31:06] church okay it's the same spirit it's
[31:09] doing the same thing okay what and so
[31:12] when we do not pattern Our Lives after
[31:13] the word and we do not pattern our
[31:15] marriages after the word then guess what
[31:17] it's not going it's not a reflection of
[31:19] of what God intended it's not going to
[31:21] be um it's going to be a direct
[31:24] reflection of our spiritual
[31:26] well-being right
[31:28] and when
[31:29] we there's a lot of times that women or
[31:33] our sisters want to go well
[31:36] I'll
[31:38] obey I'll I'll uh you know submit to the
[31:41] authority in my home in all the places
[31:44] that I like and the places that I
[31:46] disagree with that I don't think are
[31:48] very healthy I'm just going to ignore
[31:51] that right the parts of the parts of my
[31:53] husband's Authority that I agree with
[31:54] I'll I'll submit to and the parts of my
[31:56] husband's Authority that I disagree with
[31:58] will just sort of H bypass and you'll
[32:00] see this I man people you keep open your
[32:03] eyes and people you'll see it a lot
[32:06] right A lot of times you know you you
[32:10] get you'll get parents with differing
[32:13] opinions on how to raise children and so
[32:15] kids learn pretty quick go to Mom for
[32:18] this and go to Dad for that right well
[32:21] no ultimately what should be happening
[32:23] is when you go to mom she's going to say
[32:25] what did your father say right there's
[32:28] not going to be a difference of opinion
[32:29] and I understand there's
[32:30] miscommunication and she thinks one
[32:31] thing and he thinks another thing and
[32:33] they didn't get together first on the
[32:34] topic so you're going to get different
[32:35] outcome that's not what I'm talking
[32:37] about right but every kid knows that you
[32:40] can
[32:41] absolutely get a a difference of opinion
[32:43] based on who you go to well ultimately
[32:45] there should be a Unity there and why
[32:47] it's because a lot of
[32:49] times look when when a woman is willing
[32:51] to submit to the authority everywhere
[32:54] but the places that she disagrees
[32:56] with it's
[32:58] it's it is a woman saying I will wear my
[33:02] long hair for the glory because it is it
[33:05] is it is the glory it is my glory and it
[33:07] speaks of my headship but I'm going to
[33:09] trim the split ends off because I don't
[33:10] like that
[33:12] part yeah right I mean brother brandom
[33:15] said you don't take scissors of your
[33:16] hair and so when you're saying well I
[33:18] don't like this part of my hair so I'm
[33:19] just going to clip the ends off because
[33:21] I mean I think it would be healthier if
[33:22] I just you know okay that's great but
[33:26] what you're doing is you're trimming the
[33:27] authority the the edges of the Authority
[33:29] off of your husband where you don't like
[33:31] it right that's the spiritual that's
[33:33] spiritually speaking that's what you're
[33:34] doing and it's going to show a lot of
[33:37] places in that marriage right once you
[33:39] start looking at it in that angle
[33:41] suddenly you start seeing all the places
[33:43] in which that woman doesn't respect her
[33:44] husband where she doesn't
[33:47] agree right and it's I know that's
[33:51] hard right nobody likes to hear that
[33:54] kind of preaching I guarantee you nobody
[33:56] likes to hear that kind of preaching
[33:58] right and if you notice what brother
[34:00] brandom said you know sit still I know
[34:02] this is going to be hard the preacher
[34:04] doesn't like preaching that kind of
[34:06] material either I promise am right no
[34:09] one likes to hear that why because it
[34:10] hits us where we live it hits us where
[34:13] it hurts but it's a but it's because
[34:16] it's ultimately what it's saying is
[34:17] listen we we have to line up with the
[34:20] word everywhere and that's that's the
[34:23] hardship in this day and age it's not
[34:25] about well getting you to be a complete
[34:26] apostate it's getting you to compromise
[34:28] one tiny
[34:29] percentage right he getting you to
[34:31] compromise one tiny percent you know
[34:34] it's it throughout the entire Bible we
[34:37] can see that God recognizes sin as
[34:39] spiritual fornication that's how he sees
[34:41] it okay and if I say well you know
[34:44] there's how many hours in the day 24
[34:46] hours in a day and there's 365 days in a
[34:48] year that's you know how many thousands
[34:50] of hours of a year if I spend one hour
[34:52] out of every year having an
[34:55] affair does that make me a bad person
[34:57] really I mean Don't Judge Me based off
[34:59] of my worst 1% look at all this 99%
[35:01] that's really
[35:03] great no that 1% makes you a
[35:07] wretch right that 1% destroyed your
[35:11] relationship yeah it's 1% ruins
[35:15] everything right you know if if if
[35:18] you're start you know sit down to a fine
[35:20] meal you know surf and turf whatever I
[35:22] don't know I I like I like my mom's red
[35:24] chili cheese and chiladas if I got a big
[35:26] old plate full of that and I'm scarfing
[35:28] it down it's 99% delicious and 1%
[35:32] cyanide right it's delicious and
[35:37] deadly right it you know we this idea
[35:41] that we can
[35:43] compromise
[35:45] 1%
[35:47] no it's not
[35:49] okay right that 1% will ruin you and you
[35:55] know because
[35:57] the the relation
