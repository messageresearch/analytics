[4:14] burdens that we have for loved ones
[4:17] Lord for those that are struggling. We

[13:56] A long, long time ago, I did not know
[14:02] about Jesus and his love.
[14:07] You see, I heard about it, but I never
[14:11] felt it. This mana that comes from
[14:17] above.
[14:19] When this life was sin, I could no
[14:22] longer stand.
[14:24] I asked my mother, "How do I get to know
[14:29] this man?" She said, "Can't you see? You
[14:32] must see. You have to be born
[14:37] again."
[14:40] Well, you must have that fire and Holy
[14:44] Ghost, that prayer will turn and keeps

[15:12] name. Filled within free from sin. You

[15:20] again.

[15:24] So many troules and dangers
[15:29] that my Lord has brought me through.
[15:35] Well, Jesus opened the blinded eyes and
[15:37] he made the lame to walk. There's
[15:40] nothing too hard for him to do.
[15:46] So now's the time you must seek him.
[15:51] He'll heal your soul in Jesus name.
[15:56] Well, he'll make you whole, fill your
[15:59] soul. Then you'll know you're born
[16:03] again.

[16:10] Ghost that prayer will turn it. Keep the

[22:43] moments and just praise the Lord.
[22:48] Oh,

[24:10] Amen. Thought of me, thought of you
[24:14] above all.
[24:16] Amen. And brother Brandham talks about
[24:17] how that if you had a charger with the
[24:20] blood of Christ, the literal blood of
[24:22] Christ that you'd be more valuable than
[24:25] that because he paid that and ransom to
[24:28] get you. Amen. Praise the Lord. God
[24:32] bless you. We're going to invite you
[24:33] back with us to Daniel chapter 12. We're
[24:35] going to continue from Sunday. Amen.
[24:39] Wanted to just um keep making my tracks
[24:42] through here. I think this will be the
[24:44] uh fourth installment of our future
[24:47] section, future events becoming clear in
[24:50] prophecy. I've really enjoyed it. I hope
[24:52] you have too. It's been wonderful to as
[24:55] a study and to look at the things that
[24:58] are happening and my goodness, the world
[25:00] is moving at such a incredibly fast
[25:03] pace. Wow. So, uh, we're not, um,
[25:07] probably get into some more of that
[25:09] Sunday, some new updated things, but,
[25:12] uh, I want to just really solidify in
[25:15] our hearts where we were finishing up on
[25:18] Sunday where we hit a pause button. So,
[25:19] we're going to look back at our original
[25:21] text and then we've got a number of
[25:23] requests we'll get to here. If you've
[25:24] got a prayer request, make sure you get
[25:26] it to me. I've got a number of them
[25:29] already and uh, we'll be looking for
[25:31] more near the end. Amen. Daniel chapter
[25:35] 12
[25:39] verse one.
[25:42] And at that time Michael shall stand up
[25:44] the great prince which standeth for the
[25:46] children of thy people. And there shall
[25:49] be a time of trouble such as never was
[25:52] since there was a nation even to that
[25:55] same time. And at that time thy people
[25:58] shall be delivered everyone that shall
[26:01] be found written in the book. And many
[26:04] of them that sleep in the dust of the
[26:06] earth shall awake, some to everlasting
[26:09] life, and some to shame and everlasting
[26:12] contempt. And they that be wise shall
[26:16] shine as the brightness of the
[26:17] firmament, and they that turn away many
[26:20] to righteousness as the stars forever
[26:23] and ever. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up
[26:26] the words and seal the book, even to the
[26:29] time of the end. Many shall run to and
[26:31] fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
[26:34] Let's keep reading. Then I, Daniel,
[26:36] looked, and behold, there stood other
[26:38] two, the one on this side of the bank of
[26:41] the river, and the other on that side of
[26:43] the bank of the river. And one said to
[26:45] the man clothed in linen, which was upon
[26:47] the waters of the river. Brother Ram
[26:49] said, this one standing on the water was
[26:51] the Holy Ghost. How long shall it be to
[26:54] the end of these wonders? And I heard
[26:57] the man clothed in linen, which was upon
[26:59] the waters of the rivers, when he held
[27:02] up his right hand and his left hand unto
[27:04] heaven, and swear by him that liveth
[27:07] forever, that it shall be for a time,
[27:10] times, and a half. And when he shall
[27:13] have accomplished to scatter the power
[27:16] of the holy people, all these things
[27:19] shall be finished. Amen. Let's pray.
[27:23] Master, we thank you for your word this
[27:25] evening. And it's a ominous text that we
[27:28] read, but yet Lord, there's glorious
[27:31] hope uh for your family as we read these
[27:34] words, Lord, because it lets us know
[27:36] that the change of administration must
[27:39] come. The millennium must come. The
[27:42] world must move to a a whole new
[27:45] civilization, Lord. And so, we know that
[27:47] that day is upon us. We are that last
[27:50] generation, Lord. We have arrived. We
[27:52] are at the end of the end time, Lord.
[27:56] And so this is the generation upon whom
[27:59] the ends of the world have come. Lord,
[28:02] we commit ourselves aresh to you tonight
[28:05] and ask you to feed us your word as we
[28:07] need it so bad. We commit it to you in
[28:09] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[28:12] Friends, you can be seated.
[28:15] I have my title slide. Sister Sarah.
[28:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. And I'll power
[28:21] this up and control it from up here.
[28:24] Amen.
[28:26] We were I've got a couple of quotes that
[28:29] I want to read several here that are
[28:31] brief and I read them to you on Sunday.
[28:35] And so I'm going to put just those up
[28:38] and then I've got some that I'll refer
[28:40] to, but we're not going to have them on
[28:42] the slides. Amen. Do you have that?
[28:45] Yeah. Okay. So, it should have been in
[28:47] the booth email or in the one uh one
[28:50] drive lobby. Amen. If you don't get it,
[28:52] I'll just I'll read it again, Sarah.
[28:55] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Got a got
[28:58] always different crew members back
[29:00] there. Amen. Praise God. Brother
[29:02] Brandham, we were one of the things that
[29:04] we were finishing with on Sunday as we
[29:08] drew to the end of Sunday's sermon is
[29:11] that brother Brandham said, "If you have
[29:14] eternal life, you have uh you always
[29:19] was. If you have eternal life, you
[29:21] always was." And so we were commenting
[29:24] on there and showing you how that
[29:26] brother Brandham developed that thought
[29:29] uh leading in the last number of of
[29:31] years of his ministry, especially
[29:33] particularly the last couple of years.
[29:36] And we're picking up a quote here. It's
[29:39] all right, guys. I'm just going to carry
[29:40] on if you catch up to me. Uh you can
[29:42] just catch up to me with the first one.
[29:44] We we read this to you Sunday from 1964.
[29:48] Sir, we would see Jesus. And then
[29:51] remember, if you ever was in God's
[29:54] thinking, you'll always be there.
[29:58] If you've got eternal life, you are the
[30:01] expression or the attribute of his
[30:04] thought for this age. Now, that's an
[30:06] amazing statement, for this age. All
[30:09] right? There is only one eternal life.
[30:13] So, you know, I I I want to emphasize
[30:16] tonight. I think I may have it down in
[30:17] my notes somewhere. There you go,
[30:20] sister. Amen. Let me turn on right here
[30:22] so I can control it. Amen. Thank you.
[30:25] Uh, let me make sure I'm working here.
[30:27] Oh. Oh, let's We're going to start right
[30:29] there. Remember, let me start again. If
[30:32] you ever was in God's thinking, you'll
[30:35] always be there. If you've got eternal
[30:37] life, you are the expression or the
[30:40] attribute of his thought for the age.
[30:44] Amen.
[30:45] Amen.
[30:47] Amen. for this age. So, could I could I
[30:50] just say to you tonight, just to kind of
[30:53] prod you, you're here on purpose.
[30:58] I want you to absorb that for a minute.
[31:01] You're definitely not an accident. And
[31:03] nothing that's ever happened to you was
[31:05] an accident. You're here on purpose. All
[31:09] right. Now, I may say that again, but I
[31:12] want to just drop that in as you read
[31:14] those words. There is only one eternal
[31:17] life. Um
[31:19] that ex it always existed. I guess that
[31:22] screen is not working, brother Brad. So,
[31:25] okay. All right. So, I'll just trust
[31:27] that this one's up here. And if it's
[31:28] not, somebody wave at me. Amen. Looking
[31:31] back. Looking back, it keeps distracting
[31:33] me. There's only one eternal life, and
[31:36] it always existed. And you in his mind
[31:40] existed before there was a world. Now,
[31:42] the reason that I read these for you
[31:44] Sunday and I'm read I'm actually showing
[31:46] them to you tonight is because things
[31:49] that we're preaching on are out there.
[31:52] Amen.
[31:52] And I mean, it would take a prophet to
[31:55] be able to make these kinds of
[31:57] statements. Uh I promise you, you're
[31:59] you're hearing things that you are
[32:02] guaranteed to not hear in the average
[32:04] Sunday morning pull pit. Amen. So, you
[32:08] you you you must be a special people.
[32:10] There's only one eternal life and it
[32:12] always existed and you in his mind
[32:15] existed before there was a world. That's
[32:18] the reason he said he chose you before
[32:20] the foundation of the world. It isn't
[32:22] what we think what somebody else thinks.
[32:25] It's what God eternal you always was.
[32:28] See in his thinking
[32:31] from proving his word eternal life you
[32:34] always was. See you have eternal life.
[32:38] There's only one form of it. That's God.
[32:42] You were his attribute. He thought of
[32:44] you and knowed you before the foundation
[32:48] of the world in his mind.
[32:50] Amen.
[32:51] Now when you remember that when we read
[32:54] something about in his mind, don't think
[32:57] of it as just figment of thought like
[32:59] your mind. Your your thoughts are just
[33:02] figment of thought. They have no
[33:04] expression at all until it you actually
[33:07] bring it to a manifestation in God's
[33:10] thoughts. That is a actually a form of
[33:13] reality that already exists. All right?
[33:16] And that's an important point. All
[33:18] right? So, and and again, uh our our so
[33:22] our earthly existence
[33:25] um as I said to you Sunday as we were
[33:27] going off the air, our earthly existence
[33:30] therefore is not the beginning of our
[33:35] story. Say, "Oh, I was born on a certain
[33:37] day and so began my story." Not so.
[33:41] You are actually just a chapter in an in
[33:45] an eternal unfolding book of life. Amen.
[33:49] That represents all of God's family and
[33:51] all of God's plan and all of his
[33:53] redemption. And therefore, your life
[33:56] here is a chapter to be lived out and
[34:00] fulfilled. It's not that you chose it,
[34:03] it's that he chose it.
[34:04] Amen.
[34:05] All right. So, we've got to get this
[34:07] established in your mind because I've
[34:09] got some statements I want to make based
[34:12] on what he is saying. some things that
[34:15] for me I'm looking at it going, "Well,
[34:17] then if if he said this and this and
[34:20] this, if that's true, then this is
[34:24] true."
[34:25] And we're not just making things up.
[34:28] This isn't just esoteric preaching. This
[34:30] isn't just Eastern mysticism.
[34:33] This is real.
[34:34] This came from a a vindicated prophet.
[34:37] Watch.
[34:38] Yes.
[34:39] So he So So all right. He thought of you
[34:41] and knowed you before the foundation of
[34:44] the world in his mind. Then from God who
[34:48] is rich in mercy.
[34:50] Now if you've got eternal life, if we
[34:53] have eternal life, then we always were
[34:57] because there is only one form of
[35:00] eternal life. We always were. And the
[35:03] reason we were because we are a part of
[35:07] God. And God is the only thing that's
[35:11] eternal.
[35:11] Amen.
[35:12] All right. Now, I'm I'm going to put
[35:15] that many up and I got a few more that
[35:17] I'll make a reference to. So, we always
[35:20] were and the reason we were because we
[35:24] are part of God and God is the only
[35:26] thing that's eternal. So then, so then
[35:29] conversion, we could all sit here today
[35:32] and go back and say, you know, uh uh I
[35:35] remember the day that I made my firm
[35:37] dedication to the Lord and something
[35:39] changed in my life. And some people can
[35:42] testify of some great supernatural
[35:44] outpouring. Some people just say, you
[35:47] know, it it didn't accompany a lot of
[35:49] thunder and lightning, but I came to a
[35:51] determination in my heart, and all I can
[35:53] say is I've never been the same person.
[35:56] Hallelujah.
[35:57] So we don't look to any certain
[35:59] sensation. You're looking to faith in
[36:01] God's word where you know that your
[36:04] nature is now changed and you are no
[36:08] longer at all comfortable in the world.
[36:11] So conversion let take I want you to
[36:14] think about that for a moment.
[36:17] Brother Brandham saying what he is
[36:19] saying and teaching what he is teaching.
[36:22] Then it is apparent to me that
[36:24] conversion becomes, and I said this to
[36:27] you Sunday, less about becoming
[36:29] something new and more about returning
[36:32] to what we always were.
[36:35] Amen.
[36:36] Wow.
[36:38] Amen to that. So when brother Brandham
[36:40] makes this statement that we always were
[36:44] and the reason we were is because we are
[36:47] a part of God then then that literally
[36:50] then that literally I mean you have to
[36:52] realize this is collapsing the
[36:55] distinction between you know just God's
[36:59] fornowledge and our existence as if as
[37:03] if God had a fornowledge and then we are
[37:05] here existing in the earth. It's all
[37:07] part of the same thing. Our existence
[37:09] here is all part of God's fornowledge.
[37:12] So, brother Brandham is doing away with
[37:14] that the idea that you became a son or
[37:18] daughter of God. So, eternal life then
[37:21] is not something that we acquire at our
[37:24] conversion. It's something we return to.
[37:28] It's something we recognize as our
[37:31] original state.
[37:33] Amen. Now, that's what Paul was showing
[37:36] us when he freely admits that at one
[37:39] time we all had our conversation in the
[37:43] lust of the flesh.
[37:48] And we were by very nature the children
[37:51] of wrath even as everybody else. It was
[37:53] God who was rich in mercy. See, and so
[37:57] when Paul talks about we all, you know,
[37:59] were uh had that conversation and were
[38:01] by nature, then we're realizing that
[38:04] that that fallen nature, that fallen
[38:07] nature of your spirit when you're born,
[38:10] that's not your original nature.
[38:13] Amen. And so conversion destroys that
[38:16] sin birth nature and you come back to a
[38:19] new nature but it's it's new in the
[38:22] sense that you've never had it but it
[38:24] you've all but you've always been in
[38:25] possession of it.
[38:31] Wow. Say it backwards.
[38:36] So then we are not accidental beings
[38:39] but we are intentional expressions.
[38:42] Amen.
[38:42] Now, sometimes, you know, that makes us
[38:45] uncomfortable because we're we're aware
[38:47] of our our our fallacies and our our
[38:50] failures and we're we're aware of hurts
[38:52] and things that happen to us in life.
[38:54] I'm just here. All I can tell I can't
[38:56] there's there's some wise that that you
[38:59] have a why that I can't give you an
[39:01] answer to.
[39:02] There's some questions that the answer
[39:04] lays on the other side.
[39:06] Hallelujah.
[39:06] But, uh, so I can't I can't explain
[39:09] everything that's happened to you. I
[39:10] can't explain everything that's happened
[39:11] to me in my life. Uh but I do know this
[39:15] that I'm here on purpose.
[39:17] That I'm an intentional expression of
[39:19] God because I'm part of his eternal
[39:23] attributes.
[39:24] Amen.
[39:25] Say, did he make me fail?
[39:27] I'm part of his eternal attributes.
[39:30] Amen.
[39:30] Wow.
[39:31] Well, then then whose fault? I'm part of
[39:34] his eternal attributes.
[39:36] Did sometimes you just go, "Shut up,
[39:38] devil. I'm part of his eternal
[39:40] attributes.
[39:42] Amen.
[39:44] So, we've been placed here. As I said to
[39:46] you already, and I want to say it again,
[39:49] we've been placed here,
[39:52] not just here, but here in this age, the
[39:55] worst one,
[39:56] right?
[39:57] Amen.
[39:58] the most vile,
[40:00] the most deceptive,
[40:01] the most sleazy,
[40:03] the most gross,
[40:05] the darkest.
[40:06] You're living in an unprecedented era of
[40:10] darkness. The world has never, not even
[40:12] in the days of Noah had this much uh
[40:15] that to have to deal with. We have to
[40:18] deal with the days of Noah and the days
[40:20] of Lot simultaneously.
[40:22] And Satan is now the god of the evil
[40:24] age.
[40:25] That's right.
[40:27] This is now Satan's Eden.
[40:30] Wasn't that in Noah's day? Not at all.
[40:33] Because God because God was going to
[40:35] give him 6,000 years like God took 6,000
[40:38] years to create his Eden. He was going
[40:40] to give Satan 6,000 years. And Satan
[40:42] made a pledge and a promise that he
[40:44] would ascend. He would be worshiped like
[40:46] the most high God. He pulled it off.
[40:49] He accomplished it. See, but and and
[40:53] I've said to you so many times, it it it
[40:56] it surely must burn the devil so bad
[41:00] that he's got all society, all
[41:03] entertainments, all government, all
[41:05] laws, all all churches, all families,
[41:10] all pullpits. But what he cannot get is
[41:13] that little sliver of a bride, that
[41:16] elect lady that's just moving through
[41:18] the earth. And the wor the darker it
[41:20] gets, the closer she gets to the Lord.
[41:22] And the more he presses her, the more
[41:24] she loves God. And the greater her
[41:26] trials, the greater her faith.
[41:30] Hallelujah. That's inexplicable.
[41:32] Satan cannot figure you out.
[41:35] And I'm glad.
[41:36] Amen.
[41:37] Cuz I got him figured out.
[41:40] I'm ahead of him.
[41:43] We were conceived before time began.
[41:47] Just just own that.
[41:50] I I was not I was my my conception was
[41:53] not my earthly birth.
[41:55] Amen.
[41:56] I was conceived before time began, but I
[42:00] was brought into this temporal
[42:03] condition.
[42:03] Amen.
[42:04] And it's temporal.
[42:06] It's just temporary. Thanks be to God. I
[42:10] don't I would not want eternal life in
[42:13] this broken down body, in this broken
[42:15] down world. That's right.
[42:17] I want it. I want a new body. I want a
[42:19] new world. I want a new king. I want a
[42:21] new atmosphere.
[42:23] Amen.
[42:25] So, so then so then we're we're brought
[42:29] into this temporal existence
[42:32] to fulfill a purpose.
[42:35] Amen.
[42:36] Now, that's what we read in the quote.
[42:38] It this is all about God having a
[42:40] purpose.
[42:42] So, so then my life is not here just to
[42:44] make my way through life and get to
[42:46] heaven. My life is a temporal existence.
[42:50] It I it was conceived before time and
[42:53] it's a temporal existence and I'm here
[42:56] to to accomplish a purpose. So this then
[43:00] this takes our understanding to the next
[43:03] level of who we are in Christ.
[43:06] Amen.
[43:07] And the purpose that we're here for. uh
[43:10] the thing that we're here to achieve.
[43:12] And I would even say even the true
[43:14] meaning of salvation itself.
[43:17] The world thinks they understand what it
[43:19] means to be saved. They they don't
[43:21] understand that it's it's not just
[43:23] salvation from destruction. It's
[43:26] redemption. That we're I'm not just
[43:28] saved from destruction and then I get
[43:31] granted eternal life at the judgment
[43:33] bar. We were somewhere before we were
[43:35] here.
[43:38] And we're a part of something eternal.
[43:42] That we came from that great fountain
[43:46] that was eternal.
[43:49] I would say that that's probably the
[43:52] last thing in the world the devil would
[43:54] want you to know
[43:56] and certainly would not want you to
[43:58] believe.
[43:59] Amen. But if I come from God, I go back
[44:03] to God.
[44:04] Amen.
[44:06] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[44:08] When we think of redemption, we realize
[44:10] that redemption,
[44:14] and I've thought a lot about how to say
[44:16] this.
[44:18] So, and and even as I'm looking at my
[44:20] own notes, I I'm still struggling and
[44:22] thinking of better ways to say it. But
[44:25] redemption becomes then for you and I,
[44:28] not what we learned in Sunday school at
[44:31] a Lutheran church or Baptist church or
[44:33] Catholic school or anything like that.
[44:35] Redemption uh becomes a recognition of
[44:38] something that's in play. It's already
[44:41] in play. It it's it's it's the same
[44:45] recognition that Jesus had about
[44:47] himself. Yeah.
[44:49] See that? That that that that he being
[44:51] the word, he was the word before he was
[44:54] flesh. And that's what gave him will
[44:57] conquering power. I'm here to tell you
[44:58] something, friends. You can have that
[45:00] same will conquering power when you
[45:02] begin to realize and you begin to
[45:04] recognize that you were somewhere before
[45:06] you were flesh.
[45:11] It's the thing we bypassed
[45:14] for the elect. Then the day of our
[45:16] conversion
[45:19] marks the beginning not of my existence
[45:23] but of a journey.
[45:24] Amen.
[45:25] Amen.
[45:29] Amen.
[45:30] It marks the beginning of a journey.
[45:34] Are you hanging on?
[45:35] Oh yeah.
[45:36] My life
[45:39] marks a journey to return to my original
[45:44] state.
[45:47] So our identity then as the elect of
[45:51] God, our identity becomes a matter of
[45:55] recognition rather than something you
[45:57] acquire.
[45:59] Rather than something you go get say, I
[46:01] went to a church and I got saved. Oh,
[46:04] you acquired salvation. Yes, I acquired
[46:07] salvation. I did not acquire salvation.
[46:11] I recognized who I was in Christ and I
[46:15] had always been him. Friends, that blows
[46:17] fuses. This took a prophet. Do you
[46:19] realize what you're hearing tonight? Do
[46:22] you realize why you are so secure
[46:26] in your faith in the word of God that
[46:29] incidentally you didn't even conjure up
[46:31] yourself.
[46:32] Not only I love how brother Richie
[46:34] Douglas says it. Not only did he give us
[46:36] the word to take us in a rapture, he
[46:38] gave us the faith to believe it.
[46:41] Think of that, friends. He gave you the
[46:42] word you need and the faith to believe
[46:44] it.
[46:45] Amen.
[46:46] Amen.
[46:48] So therefore then my purpose
[46:51] if if if if if if my identity is a
[46:54] matter of recognition rather than that I
[46:56] go and acquire something uh that I'm
[46:59] recognizing who I have always been in
[47:02] God's mind then I have to conclude the
[47:05] next obvious conclusion must be that my
[47:08] purpose is just a temporary expression
[47:12] of an eternal attribute. That's why I'm
[47:14] here. That's why I'm a Christian. That's
[47:17] why the Holy Ghost came. That's what the
[47:19] Holy Ghost is given for. So that my
[47:22] temporal existence manifest an eternal
[47:25] expression.
[47:27] So it never has been about trying to
[47:30] keep rules and regulations and check
[47:33] boxes. I'm here to say, Lord, it's
[47:35] written of me in the word. I've come to
[47:38] do thy will, oh God.
[47:39] Yes. Amen. Amen.
[47:42] Whatever his plan for me is,
[47:46] my purpose becomes, my temporary life,
[47:50] my temporal existence is here to be an
[47:54] expression. I could not say that to you
[47:56] had I not read it from a prophet.
[47:58] That's right.
[47:59] I would have no authority to give you
[48:02] that kind of hope. I would like to give
[48:04] you that kind of hope, but I could not
[48:05] have any authority to say it except a
[48:08] prophet comes and takes the scriptures
[48:10] that they've studied for 2,000 years and
[48:12] puts it all together and dovetales it
[48:14] and makes it one continuous love story
[48:17] given to us by God.
[48:20] When I realized that I didn't start on
[48:22] any certain day, I was always a part of
[48:25] Christ.
[48:27] And I take that into my temporary
[48:29] existence, whatever his plan for me is.
[48:32] So, it's not about I mean, it's not it's
[48:34] not about him telling me, you know, I'm
[48:37] going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a
[48:38] lawyer, you're going to be a farmer. Uh
[48:41] but but it's it's that wherever your
[48:44] pursuits take you, you're here to
[48:46] express something beyond this world.
[48:50] Whatever in whatever fashion, whatever
[48:52] he's uh gifted you with, you you gain a
[48:55] career, you gain an education, go ahead.
[48:57] My goodness, be all you can be. But just
[49:00] understand that one principle that
[49:02] you're here in whatever he's called you
[49:04] to do, you're here to express something
[49:06] beyond being a doctor or a lawyer or a
[49:09] farmer or whatever. You're here to
[49:11] express an eternal quality.
[49:14] That's why you're an oddball.
[49:16] That's right. Amen.
[49:18] You wouldn't be an oddball being a
[49:20] doctor or lawyer or farmer.
[49:22] But you're an oddball even if you are a
[49:24] doctor, lawyer, or farmer, whatever you
[49:26] are. You're an oddball because you're
[49:28] not expressing something temporal.
[49:30] You're already privy to a a great
[49:33] knowledge that you didn't start here and
[49:36] you're not finishing here.
[49:37] Amen.
[49:40] So,
[49:42] you know, brother Brandham used the
[49:44] example of the royal prince who had who
[49:48] got captured and was sailed to the
[49:50] Americas and forced into slavery and but
[49:53] but brother Brandham says but he knew he
[49:55] knew he was a prince. He knew he was
[49:57] royalty and he knew that because he knew
[50:01] who his father was. He didn't there was
[50:04] nothing different. He didn't have an
[50:06] extra armor, extra fingers or extra
[50:08] intelligence. Uh he wasn't above his
[50:10] fellows in that way. But he knew the
[50:12] origin of his g of his genealogy and
[50:15] that he knew across the sea. It didn't
[50:17] matter that he couldn't see him. He knew
[50:19] he was the son of a king. And therefore,
[50:22] knowing he would never see him until
[50:24] death set him free, he lived his
[50:26] temporal life like he was a son of a
[50:28] king.
[50:29] Amen.
[50:30] And they noticed it in his lifestyle.
[50:34] Amen. So I will return to where I came
[50:36] from. Will you?
[50:39] I will return
[50:42] oh my to all that I was uh before this
[50:49] temporal life.
[50:50] Amen.
[50:51] Amen.
[50:52] So then I say Lord let my life
[50:56] let me live. And I I I mean this when I
[50:59] say it to the Lord I mean it at such a
[51:02] deep level. Lord, let my life be an
[51:05] example of my true identity.
[51:09] Let let the expression and in whatever
[51:12] career uh you achieve, whatever
[51:15] relationship you take part in, however
[51:18] your life goes, make sure that you're
[51:20] living as the son of royalty or the
[51:23] daughter of royalty. And you know that
[51:27] just as soon as death sets you free or
[51:29] the rapture comes, you're going back to
[51:32] something, friends, that's almost beyond
[51:34] description. Brother Brandham tried to
[51:36] describe it. He says here, he says in
[51:38] thinking man's filter, when you're born
[51:41] of the spirit of God,
[51:44] then you are a son of God and you always
[51:47] was a son of God and you always will be
[51:49] a son of God. No way to separate it. So
[51:53] you say, "Well, what about your ups and
[51:55] downs?" I've always been a son of God. I
[51:58] always will be a son of God. There's no
[52:00] way to separate it.
[52:02] But what about your failures? I've
[52:04] always been a son of God. I will always
[52:06] be a son of God. And there's no way to
[52:08] separate it. You need to say that in
[52:10] your sleep. You need to wake up tomorrow
[52:12] and say, "I'm a child of God, and I can
[52:14] never separate it, and no one can ever
[52:16] separate me."
[52:17] Glory to God.
[52:19] Hallelujah.
[52:19] God's power to transform. September 65.
[52:23] That life that's in you always was. See,
[52:28] I'm I keep coming back to these quotes
[52:29] because we're making statements that are
[52:31] astonishing.
[52:33] Amen.
[52:34] That life that's in you always was. And
[52:37] you were in the loins of God before
[52:40] there even was a world. That's thus
[52:43] sayaeth the Lord.
[52:46] That's thus sayeth the Lord. You were in
[52:48] the loins of God before there was even a
[52:51] world.
[52:53] So how is anything that happens to you
[52:54] in this world going to upend what you
[52:57] were before there was a world?
[53:00] See, so when the Holy Ghost finds you,
[53:04] he changes you. And you know, it's it's
[53:07] Mrs. Jesus that that uh that recognizes
[53:11] who she is in him and and that and and
[53:14] that he's not only he's not only turning
[53:16] you into something a as much as he's
[53:20] turning you back to something
[53:22] and that to me now I don't know about
[53:24] you but to me that is such a relief that
[53:28] because then I'm not it's not that I'm
[53:30] in a life or death struggle to achieve
[53:33] something. I'm not trying to go get
[53:35] something or achieve something. I'm
[53:37] trying to get restored back to
[53:38] something.
[53:39] See,
[53:42] so he's turning me back. Thi this
[53:44] changes everything. I would say that
[53:47] this changes when I as I begin to study
[53:50] this. And I'm just going to say it like
[53:51] I like I felt it. For me, this changes
[53:56] everything that that I thought or we
[53:59] would have thought. And I I'm not saying
[54:01] that just just now at the study of this
[54:03] message, studying it for years, I've
[54:05] realized, but I never would have
[54:07] realized. You'd be right out there with
[54:08] out in the world with everybody else and
[54:11] you'd have a concept of what life and
[54:13] death was. But now, as a member of the
[54:16] bride, this changes everything that we
[54:18] thought about life and death.
[54:20] Amen. See,
[54:22] it it it it it's everything that we
[54:24] thought we knew because the implications
[54:27] are are so profound. Is that death is
[54:31] that death? Now, here comes another
[54:33] heavy statement. Is that death for the
[54:37] believer,
[54:38] Oh, yeah.
[54:38] isn't entrance, you know, into some
[54:42] incomplete spiritual state.
[54:44] Come on. Amen.
[54:45] Where you're just a cloud floating. You
[54:47] just go back to some energy.
[54:49] Come on. I I don't know some energy up
[54:52] there and I just go back to some energy.
[54:54] I came from an energy. I go back to an
[54:56] energy. But we're finding that that
[54:58] death for the believer isn't an end is
[55:01] not an entrance into some incomplete
[55:03] spiritual state or some unknown uh form,
[55:07] but it's actually a reunion with my
[55:11] theophony.
[55:12] Yes, sir.
[55:13] Amen.
[55:14] You have a theophony? Yep.
[55:17] And so I'm reunited. And when that's why
[55:20] brother Brandon would say you go to your
[55:22] theophony if you die but if you're alive
[55:24] and remain your theophony comes to you
[55:27] and and when that unit 19 comes then
[55:29] you're glorified. You're changed in a
[55:30] moment in the twinkling of an eye. We're
[55:32] not talking about Harry Potter. We're
[55:34] talking about heavenly power.
[55:38] Amen.
[55:39] Hollywood's uh cheap knockoff
[55:42] of what God has been doing for
[55:43] centuries.
[55:46] So it's a it's a the theophony then is a
[55:49] perfect spiritual body that brother
[55:52] Brandham taught us that we bypassed in
[55:56] our journey to earth.
[55:58] Amen.
[55:59] Now,
[56:01] I'm just going to have to say um
[56:06] even after all these years of study, I
[56:10] cannot say to you tonight that there's a
[56:14] form of me walking around under the
[56:17] altar in the sixth dimension just
[56:19] waiting. I don't know if that's true. I
[56:22] kind of think it might be,
[56:24] but I don't know because because brother
[56:28] Brandham says it ambiguously and says it
[56:30] in one way and it looks like maybe. And
[56:32] the Bible says if our if the earthly
[56:35] house of this tabernacle be dissolved,
[56:37] we have one already waiting.
[56:40] And the Bible says, you know, concerning
[56:43] children, they always do behold the face
[56:44] of their father. So, but but but now you
[56:48] say, well, then that seals the deal. No,
[56:49] it doesn't. because I already know that
[56:51] God's thoughts are real.
[56:53] Right?
[56:54] You understand? So, you can't say that
[56:56] definitively. And a prophet didn't say
[56:57] it definitively. So, I have no authority
[56:59] to say it. At least I've never found him
[57:01] saying it definitively.
[57:03] But he he does he does say to a living
[57:06] audience on tape. He says, "I see you
[57:09] all over there."
[57:14] Okay. So, I just want to make it clear
[57:15] tonight because when I when I say that
[57:18] that it that it's a per a perfect
[57:20] spiritual body that we bypassed in our
[57:23] journey to earth, then you know friends,
[57:26] let me just say it to you like this
[57:28] because now when I think of life and
[57:30] death, I I think of it as different. The
[57:33] more I study this, I realize that that
[57:36] when we die, we simply leave the land of
[57:39] the dying and enter into the land of the
[57:41] living.
[57:42] [Music]
[57:43] So the loved ones we've lost, we haven't
[57:45] lost and they didn't go anywhere. They
[57:47] they left the land of the dying and they
[57:50] stepped into the land of the living.
[57:53] Oh, that comforts my heart. That
[57:55] comforts my heart.
[57:58] Amen.
[57:58] Brother Brandham says in Who is this
[58:00] Melzdc?
[58:02] I This is heavy for a Wednesday night. I
[58:04] apologize, but I just it's I can't think
[58:07] of anything else right now. It's just
[58:08] consuming me. And who is this Melzdc?
[58:13] But when this life is finished here,
[58:16] if this earthly tabern quotes the
[58:18] scripture, if this earthly tabernacle be
[58:20] dissolved, we have one already waiting.
[58:23] That's where we go. That is the word.
[58:27] Then we can look back and see what we
[58:30] done. Now we don't understand it.
[58:34] I'm so glad he said that. Now we don't
[58:38] understand it. We have never become the
[58:41] word. We've just become the flesh man,
[58:44] not the word.
[58:45] Amen.
[58:48] So I but I think I can say it like this
[58:51] that death
[58:54] does is not a a diminishing.
[58:58] It's a completing.
[59:00] It's not a diminishing. Brother Eddie
[59:03] didn't diminish. He ran his race and he
[59:06] finished his course. Sister Seal didn't
[59:08] didn't diminish. She she didn't suffer a
[59:10] diminishment. Brother Mark, she she
[59:12] accomplished. She completed something.
[59:16] Hallelujah. Oh, on and on and on. I
[59:18] could go. I I get naming him. I'd start
[59:20] crying.
[59:22] So, death then is a reunion.
[59:25] Can you Can you take this without
[59:28] passing out? Then death is a reunion
[59:32] with an aspect of our spiritual identity
[59:36] that we've never experienced yet.
[59:38] That's right. Amen.
[59:41] Amen.
[59:42] But I have heard from it.
[59:45] I have heard from it.
[59:46] Praise God.
[59:50] Oh, we're so far out there. I got to
[59:51] keep going.
[59:52] Amen.
[59:55] before passing beyond the curtain of
[59:57] time. Brother Brandham reveals and they
[1:00:00] put it in the uh little magazine there.
[1:00:04] Brother Brandham wearied himself with
[1:00:06] thinking that, you know, he would just
[1:00:08] be a little cloud maybe floating around
[1:00:10] in the cosmos and and he and it bothered
[1:00:13] him because he said, you know, I if he
[1:00:16] met Brother Neville and then to think,
[1:00:18] well, there goes brother Neville. He
[1:00:19] said, but I couldn't I couldn't hug his
[1:00:21] neck. I couldn't shake his hand cuz his
[1:00:23] hand is in a grave somewhere.
[1:00:25] And even his dream uh that he had after
[1:00:29] losing hope and Sharon Rose. Now I I say
[1:00:33] it was a dream. Let me give you brother
[1:00:35] Brandham's exact words and I must have
[1:00:38] went to sleep.
[1:00:40] But then he comes right his next breath.
[1:00:42] I don't know whether I was asleep or
[1:00:44] what happened. Right.
[1:00:48] He tells in his life story there in
[1:00:51] California
[1:00:52] at Angelus Temple 1959. My favorite
[1:00:55] version of his life story.
[1:00:58] He tells of seeing Sharon Rose and and
[1:01:01] he saw hope and he saw his home and
[1:01:04] seeing his charity. Remember he said, "I
[1:01:05] I saw an old wagon and and there was a
[1:01:08] broken wagon wheel." He said, "That
[1:01:10] represented my broken family." And he
[1:01:11] said, "I saw a very beautiful young
[1:01:12] woman." And as I walked past her, she
[1:01:14] said, 'Hello, Dad. And he said, I turned
[1:01:17] around, "Dad, well, young lady, you're
[1:01:19] I'm you're as old as me." She said,
[1:01:20] "Dad, you just don't know where you're
[1:01:22] at." And she said, "I was in the earth.
[1:01:25] I was your little Sharon." He said,
[1:01:27] "Well, Sharon, you was just a little
[1:01:29] baby." She said, "No, we're not babies
[1:01:30] up here, daddy.
[1:01:32] Not babies anymore." And he said, "Well,
[1:01:34] you've made a beautiful young woman."
[1:01:37] and and you know she and you know the
[1:01:38] story she goes on mother's waiting for
[1:01:40] you at your at your home and that
[1:01:43] stabbed his heart because brother
[1:01:45] Brandham knew the family history of the
[1:01:46] Brandoms
[1:01:48] and Brandoms were fighters drinkers
[1:01:51] killers and had it not been for the new
[1:01:54] birth in the Holy Ghost brother Brham
[1:01:56] would have just been a
[1:01:57] Brham
[1:02:00] now I'm not casting shade on the Brham
[1:02:02] lineage the love of Christ
[1:02:06] broke that cycle.
[1:02:08] Amen.
[1:02:10] And and and I didn't know brother Bill
[1:02:12] Brandham personally, but I knew Brother
[1:02:14] Doc Brandham very personally. And I've
[1:02:16] known Billy and I knew all the
[1:02:18] grandchild children and I know Brother
[1:02:20] Joseph and I know all them. And I'm here
[1:02:21] to tell you that the Holy Ghost broke a
[1:02:23] cycle.
[1:02:25] Amen.
[1:02:26] And so so we realize and we love that
[1:02:28] family and have for many years.
[1:02:31] And so he he goes on and he describes
[1:02:35] those stairs running up. You remember
[1:02:36] that? And I was going to read it, but
[1:02:38] I've got so much I want to I want to
[1:02:39] read in a minute that and he sees her
[1:02:43] and he says, "There she was." And she st
[1:02:45] lifted her arms out and he said, "I ran
[1:02:47] up to meet her and and he said, "Honey,
[1:02:50] I saw Sharon down there. She made a
[1:02:51] beautiful young woman and come in, Bill.
[1:02:54] This is your home." And he thought, you
[1:02:55] know, Brandhams are vagabons. They don't
[1:02:57] have homes.
[1:02:58] and he's all broke up and he's worried
[1:03:01] and he's distressed and he, you know,
[1:03:03] he's lost his baby and lost his wife and
[1:03:06] he's got a little baby boy. He's crying
[1:03:07] for his mother and he's having a nervous
[1:03:10] breakdown. And there's a quote that I
[1:03:12] that I didn't put on here tonight. Uh my
[1:03:14] sister Lisa found it some years ago and
[1:03:17] sent it. She sends it out sometimes when
[1:03:19] when someone loses, you know, per
[1:03:21] perhaps a spouse of many years and it's
[1:03:24] always been a comfort to many many
[1:03:26] people. And brother Brandham in one
[1:03:28] place where he's telling Hope that and
[1:03:31] he says,"Well, I Billy cries for you and
[1:03:34] I'm so lonesome for you." And and she
[1:03:36] says, "I know, Bill. I've seen it all."
[1:03:42] Amen.
[1:03:42] Now, you tell me what that means.
[1:03:44] I know. I've seen it all. I've seen it.
[1:03:47] See, Brother Brandon makes statements.
[1:03:49] Maybe maybe they'll let him look over
[1:03:51] the banister today. Friends, I'm here to
[1:03:54] tell you something. This life ain't
[1:03:56] about this life. Oh, we're just, if you
[1:03:59] could just get your mind around it
[1:04:00] tonight, you'll stop worrying about this
[1:04:03] temporal little existence. You'll just
[1:04:05] say, "I got one purpose, and that's to
[1:04:07] be a manifestation of a life that I used
[1:04:10] to be and that I'm returning back to."
[1:04:13] Amen.
[1:04:14] You'll put the devil under your feet
[1:04:16] doing that.
[1:04:18] And so, you know, and and then and I
[1:04:21] don't know how to fully explain this,
[1:04:23] but when he comes back into the room,
[1:04:25] she's still sitting on the bed beside
[1:04:27] him, patting his shoulder.
[1:04:28] Yeah.
[1:04:29] Amen.
[1:04:30] Talking to him, "Bill, you're going to
[1:04:31] make me that promise." See, Brother
[1:04:32] Brandham would later explain that the
[1:04:35] reason Hope was determined to make him
[1:04:37] promise because she knew he wouldn't
[1:04:38] promise and break it. Cuz she knew him.
[1:04:41] She knew if she could get him to
[1:04:42] promise, he wouldn't promise unless he
[1:04:44] knew he wouldn't break it. And so she
[1:04:46] keeps saying, "You going to make me that
[1:04:48] promise, Bill? You're going to make me
[1:04:49] that promise? Promise me you won't worry
[1:04:51] no more." And she's patting him there
[1:04:54] and he says, "I promise." And she patted
[1:04:57] me two or three more times and she was
[1:04:58] gone. And he jumped up and now the the
[1:05:02] the realms have separated
[1:05:04] because brother Random said, "You can't
[1:05:06] see a theophony. A theophony is
[1:05:07] something you don't you can't see."
[1:05:09] Meaning in this form,
[1:05:11] I promise you, they see each other over
[1:05:13] there. And so, so, but I I said all that
[1:05:17] to say that somehow that dream or
[1:05:19] whatever it was, it didn't accomplish
[1:05:23] taking away that weariness. Brother
[1:05:25] Brandham still carried that weariness
[1:05:27] because he wasn't sure was that just a
[1:05:29] dream. And he carried a weariness that I
[1:05:32] don't want to just be a disembodied
[1:05:34] cloud. And so to think that he might be
[1:05:36] a cloud with nobody to live in. And if
[1:05:39] well listen, if I crossed over, I
[1:05:42] wouldn't want to think that that I would
[1:05:44] see a cloud and it would be my dad and I
[1:05:46] couldn't run and jump into his arms and
[1:05:48] put my arms around him and hug him. I
[1:05:51] wouldn't want to think that either.
[1:05:55] But it took going beyond the curtain of
[1:05:57] time. And when that opened and that
[1:06:00] opened up his his understanding to a
[1:06:04] whole new reality.
[1:06:05] Yes. Amen. And he starts telling the
[1:06:08] story, and I'm not going to retell it.
[1:06:09] You've heard it many times. I'm not
[1:06:11] going to read it either tonight. I'm
[1:06:12] just going to read some of the things
[1:06:13] that he said at the end of it. But he
[1:06:16] describes that world. Oh, you mean
[1:06:19] they're real? Oh, yes. And Brother
[1:06:22] Brandham said, "I held them. They were
[1:06:24] real. They weren't little clouds."
[1:06:28] And I I came across a quote that I had
[1:06:30] never somehow never caught. I'll read it
[1:06:32] for you here in a minute. He made a
[1:06:34] statement. Somehow I missed it all these
[1:06:36] years.
[1:06:37] He says in the rejected king, "Oh my
[1:06:41] precious friends, my beloved, my
[1:06:45] darlings in the gospel." Now listen to
[1:06:47] me, young people. My darlings in the
[1:06:49] gospel, my begotten children unto God.
[1:06:53] Listen to me. You I wish there was some
[1:06:58] way I could explain it to you. There's
[1:07:00] no words. I couldn't find it. It's not
[1:07:03] found anywhere. that just beyond this
[1:07:05] last breath is the most glorious thing
[1:07:09] that you ever and he just trails off.
[1:07:12] There is no way to explain it. There's
[1:07:15] no way. I just can't do it. But whatever
[1:07:20] you do, friend, lay aside everything
[1:07:24] else.
[1:07:28] Five years later, he comes in God's only
[1:07:31] provided place of worship.
[1:07:33] And as I see all of us the the getting
[1:07:37] creeping up toward the aged, the end,
[1:07:41] it'll be a very sad thing if if we
[1:07:44] didn't have placed within us that great
[1:07:47] thing, what we know is truth. We're just
[1:07:50] fixing to turn back one of these days
[1:07:53] back to our young manhood again. To
[1:07:56] never our bodies transformed, made into
[1:07:59] his likeness to stand.
[1:08:02] For when this earthly, he quotes the
[1:08:04] scripture, when this earthly tabernacle
[1:08:06] of our habitation be dissolved. There's
[1:08:08] one already waiting.
[1:08:10] One morning about 8 o'clock, let me see
[1:08:14] that land. Now, it wasn't a vision or I
[1:08:17] don't know what to say that ever what it
[1:08:20] was. It was just as real as I'm speaking
[1:08:23] to you here now. I seen the faces of
[1:08:27] those people and I couldn't recognize
[1:08:29] them. They had turned back young again.
[1:08:34] And they was just as real as I'd hold
[1:08:37] their hands and things just as real. And
[1:08:40] it helped me because I used to have an
[1:08:42] idea when a person died just their soul
[1:08:45] went off. But when but then when he
[1:08:47] quoted that to me if this earthly
[1:08:50] tabernacle of our habitation see so the
[1:08:53] the person speaking with him is quoting
[1:08:55] the scripture because brother Brandham
[1:08:58] what you mean they're real? Sure.
[1:09:00] Remember if the earthly house of our
[1:09:01] tabernacle be dissolved and he said he
[1:09:03] quoted it to me. See we already have
[1:09:07] one. See it's not a myth. Amen.
[1:09:10] It's not an idea. It's not a spirit.
[1:09:14] It's a man and a woman like you are just
[1:09:18] exactly.
[1:09:19] Amen.
[1:09:20] And heaven or this place, wherever it
[1:09:23] was. I don't I didn't I don't know what
[1:09:26] to call it. He referred to it there as
[1:09:29] souls under the altar. And I'd never
[1:09:31] caught that. So that makes sense to me
[1:09:34] because Jesus was up higher and souls
[1:09:36] are under the altar. And we know that
[1:09:38] there's many categories, many uh
[1:09:40] locations under the altar, the remember
[1:09:42] the under the fifth seal, the Jews who
[1:09:44] had who because of the testimony they
[1:09:47] held, they were true Israelites and they
[1:09:49] had died down through the ages and they
[1:09:51] were under under the altar in the fifth
[1:09:52] seal. Well, when brother Brandon went to
[1:09:54] where he went, he didn't see Wesley or
[1:09:56] Luther or any of those. He saw his
[1:09:58] people. See,
[1:10:00] so so he says here, heaven or this
[1:10:03] place, wherever it was, I don't know
[1:10:04] what to call it. He referred to it there
[1:10:06] as souls under the altar. But it but
[1:10:08] when it was I have never
[1:10:12] there's no way to explain how great that
[1:10:14] is. There is now you just have to take
[1:10:17] my word. Whatever you do, if you miss
[1:10:22] everything else,
[1:10:25] health, strength, your eyesight,
[1:10:28] whatever it is, don't miss that.
[1:10:33] There's nothing can compare with it.
[1:10:36] There's no word in the English language
[1:10:38] that I know that could express it. If
[1:10:41] you'd say perfect, it's beyond that.
[1:10:44] Superb, it's beyond that. Sublime,
[1:10:47] there's no words that I know that could
[1:10:49] express it because it was so. And then
[1:10:53] to think that it isn't the end of it
[1:10:55] yet. I thought me be afraid to come to
[1:10:59] this.
[1:11:00] Amen.
[1:11:02] I'm here to tell you the loved ones we
[1:11:04] lost went somewhere
[1:11:05] and they're there now
[1:11:07] and they're coming back here and we're
[1:11:09] all going to be together
[1:11:11] because I didn't start here. I'm not
[1:11:13] finishing here. I came from the mind of
[1:11:15] God. They came from the mind of God.
[1:11:18] Where is it? Death or nothing could ever
[1:11:20] separate us.
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:24] I said
[1:11:25] do you eat? Said not here. See that
[1:11:29] that's why you can see the the
[1:11:30] difference between when Melzdc met
[1:11:33] Abraham coming back from the slaughter
[1:11:34] of the kings. You notice he served
[1:11:36] Abraham communion but he himself didn't
[1:11:38] partake. He didn't need anything because
[1:11:40] he's in theophony. But when he comes to
[1:11:42] Abraham to confirm the promise he's in a
[1:11:45] human body that he built out of the 16
[1:11:47] elements and stepped into it and ate a
[1:11:49] calf sandwich and drank buttermilk.
[1:11:51] See?
[1:11:53] So he says I said do you eat? He said no
[1:11:56] not here. We don't eat here, but when we
[1:11:58] go back to earth, we'll receive a body
[1:11:59] we eat in. Well, I could feel them. They
[1:12:04] was just like that. See, and they I
[1:12:06] said, "Well, you Well, you have Oh, yes,
[1:12:10] they have a body. It's not just a myth.
[1:12:12] It's a body. We know one another. They
[1:12:15] all know me. Were hugging me. Millions
[1:12:19] of them."
[1:12:23] Think of it, friends. a word body. If
[1:12:26] you go there tomorrow, you'll have a
[1:12:28] word body.
[1:12:29] And I want to tell you something. You'll
[1:12:31] get your answer to all the wise.
[1:12:35] You'll finally get your you'll have your
[1:12:36] wise and you'll have the answer to your
[1:12:39] wise.
[1:12:41] Oh, I'll get all the answers and the all
[1:12:44] the answers that all the questions and
[1:12:46] the answers that so eluded me in this
[1:12:48] life. Think of a body free of weakness
[1:12:51] and free of sin and free of of and free
[1:12:53] of every kind of complex. Free of it. It
[1:12:56] doesn't exist there.
[1:12:58] Oh my. I'm going to tell you something.
[1:13:00] That's why that's why our earthly
[1:13:03] journey is about overcoming our flesh on
[1:13:04] a daily basis because I'm I'm putting
[1:13:07] the devil in his proper place. Not my
[1:13:11] equal. The devil is not my peer. He's
[1:13:14] under my feet.
[1:13:17] That's right. You understand? We're
[1:13:19] going to be kings, but we're already
[1:13:21] kings over sin, over the world, over
[1:13:24] flesh, and over the devil.
[1:13:28] Hallelujah.
[1:13:29] So, so our our life is about growing in
[1:13:32] faith. It's about maturing and
[1:13:34] developing. Quit letting your failures
[1:13:36] hold you back. Repent, stand up, go
[1:13:40] forward. because that your whole life is
[1:13:42] a journey of allowing the virtues that
[1:13:45] are in Christ to come forward. And and
[1:13:47] and you you might have some more uh some
[1:13:50] more grinding down to do.
[1:13:52] Amen.
[1:13:53] You might have some more dying out. You
[1:13:55] might have to spend some more time in
[1:13:57] prayer. I would say spend it.
[1:14:02] There's virtues in the Holy Ghost. New
[1:14:04] birth, friends. Peter talked about them
[1:14:07] things and he made it so clear. We're
[1:14:09] adding to this and we're adding to that
[1:14:12] and adding to this. I can I admit to you
[1:14:14] tonight, I still got some adding to do.
[1:14:16] Come on.
[1:14:18] Come on, Bethl Tabernacle. I still got
[1:14:20] some adding to do. You still got some
[1:14:22] adding to do. We're not gone yet. I want
[1:14:24] to keep adding. I want to keep
[1:14:26] manifesting.
[1:14:28] Yes, sir.
[1:14:28] Amen.
[1:14:29] Hallelujah.
[1:14:30] Just like Jesus, he learned obedience.
[1:14:33] Amen.
[1:14:33] You know how he learned obed you know
[1:14:35] what? You know what his greatest thing
[1:14:37] was? that he gave himself over to the
[1:14:40] will of the father.
[1:14:42] Amen.
[1:14:43] That's a mouthful.
[1:14:45] That's heavy. He gave himself over. And
[1:14:49] I actually changed that to he
[1:14:51] surrendered himself because we say that
[1:14:52] it's almost become a cliche. He gave
[1:14:55] himself over to the will of God. He said
[1:15:00] he let let me say it like this. He gave
[1:15:03] himself over to the will of the word
[1:15:07] because he said he quoted the Old
[1:15:10] Testament prophet. It's written in the
[1:15:12] scrolls. It's written in the word
[1:15:14] concerning me. Sacrifices and offerings
[1:15:17] thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[1:15:18] prepared me. It's written in the word
[1:15:21] concerning why I'm here. What I'm to do.
[1:15:23] I know who I am. I know where I came
[1:15:26] from. I'm here to do thy will, oh God.
[1:15:29] I'm a human, but I'm going to give over
[1:15:31] my human will.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:33] To the will of the word.
[1:15:36] I have come to do thy will, O Lord.
[1:15:40] So, we are
[1:15:43] granted this understanding tonight.
[1:15:47] That our that our life and I want you to
[1:15:50] really go forth tomorrow and I want you
[1:15:52] to ponder this right here. I'll take I I
[1:15:56] I'll probably take off from this again
[1:15:57] on the weekend.
[1:15:59] But we are granted this understanding
[1:16:02] when a prophet comes and he starts
[1:16:03] preaching all these quotes and he starts
[1:16:05] telling about all this. We are granted
[1:16:08] this understanding
[1:16:10] that that our life is about becoming
[1:16:13] aligned with our theophony.
[1:16:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:16] That's what the Christian life is.
[1:16:18] That's what your journey is all about.
[1:16:21] So I'm here to tell you something,
[1:16:23] friends. You don't have to figure it out
[1:16:25] as you go. Your theophony is a word
[1:16:29] body. You already know what the word is.
[1:16:33] And therefore, it's not some some
[1:16:36] eastern mysticism. Oh, I'm thinking of
[1:16:38] some phantom and another thing and I'm
[1:16:39] going to try to imagine myself being
[1:16:41] him. That's nonsense. That's not what it
[1:16:44] is. It's a word body. I have the word
[1:16:46] that I'm feeding on. I'm bringing this
[1:16:49] fallen body subject to this body.
[1:16:52] Hallelujah. Friends, it's not Eastern
[1:16:55] mysticism. It's thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:16:57] And we have learned that that's what our
[1:16:59] earthly journey is really about.
[1:17:02] Something beyond. I I'm ordained to be
[1:17:05] something beyond what I showed up here
[1:17:08] tonight as. You're ordained tomorrow to
[1:17:11] be more than you are right now.
[1:17:13] Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] a life we had in Christ before the world
[1:17:18] was to to walk the journey of this life
[1:17:21] to live daily
[1:17:24] in this fallen world
[1:17:27] as a spiritual expression a perfect
[1:17:30] spiritual expression
[1:17:32] of my true identity.
[1:17:35] Now, I'll be the first to admit, I don't
[1:17:39] always pull it off perfectly in my
[1:17:41] flesh. But I will tell you what the
[1:17:44] devil hates. My faith is flawless.
[1:17:49] My faith is perfect.
[1:17:51] Say, "Wait a minute. I thought we were
[1:17:53] waiting on perfect faith. You're telling
[1:17:54] me you have perfect faith tonight?" You
[1:17:56] better believe it.
[1:17:57] I have perfect faith in this book. Amen.
[1:18:01] I will bank my soul and the soul of
[1:18:04] everybody I love on this book.
[1:18:07] Amen.
[1:18:08] I have perfect faith in the word of God.
[1:18:11] I I don't just believe it. I'm not just
[1:18:13] talking about intellectualism. I'm
[1:18:16] talking about everything that this calls
[1:18:18] for a human to be. I want everything,
[1:18:20] every fiber in me. I detest the
[1:18:23] weaknesses. I detest the slipping. I
[1:18:25] detest the failures. I daily want to be
[1:18:27] more like this and tomorrow more than I
[1:18:30] was today and the next day more than I
[1:18:32] was than the day previous. That's how I
[1:18:35] know that I'm connected to something in
[1:18:38] another realm
[1:18:40] and I'm not just figuring life out as I
[1:18:42] go through here some sad state trying to
[1:18:44] hope I can make it back to heaven. I
[1:18:46] can't not make it back.
[1:18:48] That's right. Amen.
[1:18:49] Think of it, friends. to be an
[1:18:51] expression of our true identity,
[1:18:53] something that already exists in the
[1:18:56] heavens, as Paul said. What that fully
[1:18:59] means, as I said to you at the
[1:19:00] beginning, I don't know. But I do know
[1:19:01] this, that spiritual maturity means
[1:19:04] increasingly
[1:19:05] manifesting in my flesh what we what I
[1:19:09] already am in a theophony.
[1:19:12] Amen.
[1:19:14] To me, that's what spiritual maturity
[1:19:17] is. It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:20] I'm going to close right here, man. I'm
[1:19:21] getting good at this.
[1:19:23] It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:27] working in our bodies.
[1:19:31] And I've I I spent a lot of time this
[1:19:33] afternoon trying to
[1:19:36] get my mind around what I'm about to
[1:19:40] say.
[1:19:43] And I I may stick with what's on my line
[1:19:45] or but I I I I I feel this so deeply
[1:19:50] when I think about the working of the
[1:19:52] Holy Ghosties.
[1:19:56] We need it, don't we?
[1:19:59] But it's but it's not if I'm I'm just
[1:20:03] going to go ahead and say it. I think
[1:20:04] I've got enough quotes to back it up.
[1:20:06] It's not merely,
[1:20:09] you know, preparatory for a
[1:20:11] resurrection.
[1:20:13] It's it's not about that because the
[1:20:15] rapture because the rapture is not
[1:20:17] predicated on your individual readiness.
[1:20:22] It's it's predicated upon the age that
[1:20:25] we live in.
[1:20:26] So that had to be ready. Brother,
[1:20:28] there's quotes where brother Brandham
[1:20:30] talks about the readiness of the church.
[1:20:31] And that's just simply as a group, as a
[1:20:34] church, when we reach the right age,
[1:20:36] when we've come to the end of Leodysia,
[1:20:37] when the seals have been broken, when
[1:20:39] the invisible union has taken place,
[1:20:41] that's the readiness of the church.
[1:20:42] She's ready to leave the earth. When the
[1:20:44] headstone comes down and connects,
[1:20:47] that's not depending on your or my
[1:20:49] individual readiness. The rapture is not
[1:20:51] predicated upon that. the the the
[1:20:54] rapture is is not uh the the so the Holy
[1:20:57] Ghost is not just merely it's to do with
[1:21:00] it but it's not merely preparing me for
[1:21:03] resurrection. Uh I would say it's not
[1:21:05] even chiefly about that. The real true
[1:21:08] life found in the new birth is in of
[1:21:12] itself the very first installment of the
[1:21:15] resurrection.
[1:21:16] Amen.
[1:21:17] That's right.
[1:21:18] You understand? It's literally the first
[1:21:20] installment. The same power uh that will
[1:21:23] raise our bodies in perfection is
[1:21:27] already working.
[1:21:29] It's already in process of
[1:21:32] transformation. You say, "Will I be
[1:21:34] changed at the rapture?" Of course, I'll
[1:21:36] be changed. I'm already being changed.
[1:21:40] It's already happening to me. Oh,
[1:21:43] precious friends, stand to your feet
[1:21:45] with me tonight and lift up those hands
[1:21:47] and say, "Lord God, we rejoice in you.
[1:21:49] We rejoice for your word and what you
[1:21:51] have revealed to us in this hour.
[1:21:54] Oh my friends, I I I I can't go any
[1:21:58] further tonight. I want to I want to
[1:22:01] connect the dots because it because
[1:22:03] listen, let me just let me just give you
[1:22:04] a preview.
[1:22:06] Th this is this is where brother
[1:22:08] Brandham was trying to get us to
[1:22:10] understand
[1:22:12] in the future home of the heavenly
[1:22:16] bridegroom and the earthly bride. And
[1:22:19] he's trying to get you to understand
[1:22:20] that it's the Holy Ghost is to it's to
[1:22:26] it's the be it's the redemption of all
[1:22:29] creation
[1:22:31] that he redeemed the earth just like he
[1:22:34] redeemed your body
[1:22:36] and the whole creation has been groaning
[1:22:40] waiting for the manifestation of sons of
[1:22:43] God.
[1:22:44] Amen.
[1:22:45] Sons of God. Thank you sir. sons of God
[1:22:47] who are who rec and daughters of the
[1:22:50] kingdom who recognize that my life here
[1:22:54] is not acquiring something or checking a
[1:22:57] box or getting enough ribbons or getting
[1:23:00] enough trophies. I it's not even about
[1:23:02] that. It's I'm not even acquiring
[1:23:04] something. And I've something came to me
[1:23:07] and something was born inside of me. And
[1:23:10] now my whole existence and every every
[1:23:15] dream I have, every motive I have, every
[1:23:18] objective that I everything I want to
[1:23:20] accomplish is now I have a completely
[1:23:24] different world view. I don't even look
[1:23:27] at the world like the world does. I
[1:23:29] don't look at the Bible like the world
[1:23:31] does. I don't look at this at the new
[1:23:33] birth like the world does. I don't I
[1:23:34] don't I have a I have now been been made
[1:23:38] privy to what Jesus knew.
[1:23:40] Amen.
[1:23:41] Not by knowledge, by revelation. I came
[1:23:44] from God.
[1:23:46] I go back to God.
[1:23:47] Jesus knowing St. John 13 that he was
[1:23:50] come from God. And that he went back to
[1:23:52] God. He laid aside his garments and took
[1:23:55] a a basin and began to wash the
[1:23:56] disciples feet. You understand? So it
[1:23:59] was his knowledge of where he was from
[1:24:02] and why and that he would have to return
[1:24:04] back there. Then then here he is taking
[1:24:08] another step that's closer to his
[1:24:09] crucifixion.
[1:24:11] I mean at any minute he could have just
[1:24:13] stopped and said no uh ain't doing this
[1:24:15] cuz if I do that then the next thing
[1:24:16] then I'll be in the garden and then I'll
[1:24:18] get arrested and then I'll be on trial
[1:24:20] and then I'll be beaten and then I'll be
[1:24:22] crucified. No no I'm just going to stop
[1:24:23] right here. But because he knew who he
[1:24:27] was, that he was come from God and went
[1:24:30] back to God, he laid aside and began to
[1:24:33] take the next step.
[1:24:34] Amen.
[1:24:34] And he took the next one and the next
[1:24:36] one and the next one and the next one.
[1:24:38] And he went to Calvary so you would
[1:24:40] never have to do that. And he went into
[1:24:43] hell so you would have never have to go.
[1:24:45] And he ascended up and he ascended on
[1:24:47] high. And he gave back his life back
[1:24:49] into the church. Oh, I'm redeemed.
[1:24:53] Hallelujah, friends. Oh, do you love
[1:24:56] him? Tonight, friends. Amen. Hey, come
[1:24:58] on and gather. Otherwise, I'll keep

[1:28:12] Sister Phyllis writes,
[1:28:15] "The Lord was with us from beginning to
[1:28:18] end."
[1:28:19] Amen.
[1:28:20] Speaking of her sister, she did
[1:28:22] incredible
[1:28:24] and is up and around with a lot of
[1:28:26] limitations due to the surgery, but it's
[1:28:28] amazing her state of mind when they were
[1:28:31] preparing a week or so ago for the
[1:28:33] surgery. They injected her lymph nodes
[1:28:37] on the left side
[1:28:39] and when there's an indication of
[1:28:41] cancer, the lymph nodes will light up
[1:28:44] bright blue. And one of the nearest the
[1:28:47] tumor, one nearest to the tumor did
[1:28:50] light up bright blue. So they were going
[1:28:53] to take out that lymph node on the left
[1:28:55] side along with a few others during
[1:28:58] surgery as a precaution and to have them
[1:29:02] tested to make sure there was no cancer
[1:29:04] present. The doctors said, this is after
[1:29:07] they did it, after they came out, they
[1:29:10] they said she didn't have to take out as
[1:29:12] many as she expected. And when they
[1:29:16] tested the ones they took out, they came
[1:29:18] back no cancer.
[1:29:21] Phyllis, Sister Phyllis says Susy, she's
[1:29:24] got in parenthesis her testimony, smiled
[1:29:28] and said it was the prayer cloth.
[1:29:32] That's right where I put the prayer
[1:29:35] cloth. She laid it right on that left
[1:29:37] side left nose. That's where I put the
[1:29:40] prayer cloth. She definitely wants to
[1:29:43] keep the prayer cloth and she's thankful
[1:29:46] for all the prayers for it. It was so
[1:29:48] much appreciated. Sister Phyllis says,
[1:29:51] "God is good."
[1:29:53] Amen. Sister Anelise has a unspoken
[1:29:57] prayer request tonight. Sister Lauren
[1:29:59] Gurgle is sick and needs a touch from
[1:30:01] the Lord. Brother Mark Lowry writes,
[1:30:04] "Deborah pulled something in her back
[1:30:05] and needs prayer tonight, please."
[1:30:08] Brother George Buckman is requesting
[1:30:09] prayer for sister Andrea who is at home
[1:30:11] tonight with what is an ongoing stomach
[1:30:13] issues which have recently gotten worse
[1:30:15] perhaps the return of the H. pylori.
[1:30:20] Brother Chris is asking uh prayer for
[1:30:22] traveling mercies this weekend. Him and
[1:30:24] Katie are uh going to Yuseite and so on
[1:30:27] a little trip and uh want the Lord to
[1:30:30] bless that. Sister Princess streaming
[1:30:32] writes u I always need prayer and got
[1:30:34] her her hands raised. Amen. Me too,
[1:30:37] Sister Princes. I need prayer. Don't
[1:30:39] you, friends?
[1:30:40] Oh my. I don't seem to uh have any
[1:30:42] others. I hope sometimes I get in the
[1:30:44] back office and see one I missed or it
[1:30:46] came in too late and I didn't catch it.
[1:30:48] But join with that one standing near
[1:30:50] you. Let's take these to the Lord in
[1:30:52] prayer. Father, we're thanking you for
[1:30:56] Sus's successful procedure tonight,
[1:31:00] Lord, and Sister Phyllis giving glory to
[1:31:03] God and Susie giving glory. Lord, all
[1:31:06] you you keep all your promises. Lord,
[1:31:09] we're thanking you. Now, may you
[1:31:11] completely recover her and let this
[1:31:14] procedure be with rapid healing. Lord,
[1:31:18] may she return back to normal, giving
[1:31:20] God the glory at all times. Lord, it was
[1:31:23] so wonderful in speaking to her on the
[1:31:25] phone and just to be able to gather
[1:31:27] there with my wife and my mother and
[1:31:30] just to pray for her over the phone and
[1:31:31] the whole church praying, Lord, she's

[1:31:54] prayer. Father, in the name of Jesus,
[1:31:56] may you meet their needs tonight. Break
[1:31:59] the power of the enemy. Lord, may
[1:32:01] sickness depart. May blessings, may it
[1:32:03] be replaced with the blessings of God.
[1:32:06] May your mercy go with these saints of
[1:32:08] God. Lord, everywhere they go, may you
[1:32:11] go before them. May you go before us
[1:32:12] all, Lord God. We are thrilled to think
[1:32:15] what we heard tonight. Lord, I'm so glad
[1:32:18] for a message of this hour that can
[1:32:20] reveal these dynamic truths to us and
[1:32:23] give us strength and give us courage
[1:32:26] to press on. Oh God, they give us
[1:32:29] courage to press on. I ask Lord for your
[1:32:33] mercy in all of these cases tonight and
[1:32:36] all those uh different ones Lord who may
[1:32:39] also have requests and ones that we even
[1:32:42] prayed for last week. Lord, we're asking
[1:32:45] for your mercy in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:32:49] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

[1:32:55] fire in the hole here, Jackson. All
[1:32:57] right. I think you're on the air, sir.
[1:33:00] Um about a half a week and a half ago, I
[1:33:04] was um working and I was washing dishes
[1:33:07] and I was transferring all the dishes to
[1:33:10] the dishwasher and uh I was getting all
[1:33:12] the silverware out and just when I
[1:33:14] grabbed all the silverware and I put it
[1:33:16] in in the dishwasher, I looked to see if
[1:33:18] there was anything else and I saw glass
[1:33:20] in there and I picked it up and it was
[1:33:22] already broken. Oh my.
[1:33:23] And I I looked and there were shards of
[1:33:25] glass all in that sink and I didn't get
[1:33:28] a cut on my hand or anything. So I just

[1:33:44] as long as it's Brother Jason preaching.

[1:33:50] it. You should see how studious he was
[1:33:51] in Poland. Man, he was like, I was so
[1:33:54] proud of him. I said, "Wow, that boy is
[1:33:56] really improving. He keeps practicing.
[1:33:58] He's going to make quite a preacher."
[1:34:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. Turn around and
