to we're going to do our service a little different tonight we have the lord's supper and uh so i'm going to not preach very long and then we'll just take up our prayer request and then we will go straight into the communion supper amen um i think that's how i do it amen praise the lord matthew chapter 26 god bless you while you're finding your place in matthew 26 just let me give you um some announcements for the weekend so there's a couple of things i want to say first of all i suppose we should dispense with the schedule and um it's cut we've kind of i've deliberated quite a bit about that and i came to the decision that we're going to start it at 3 p.m and part of the reason for that is because the weather looks like it might rain all morning and maybe even past noon and that will give it a little bit of time to dry up 3 p.m is generally the warmest part of the day and so that will give us a couple hours of sunshine to eat our meal and have some fellowship and there'll be some activities and different things like that we're going to it's usually dark around 5 30 so we'll have the fires going and we're gonna we've got that one rack thing out here that you see i might get another one so we can have a little bit bigger bigger fire and uh the little kids will have their own uh fire running mason all right brother amen you have your own fire man praise god and so i knew i knew that'd make him smile and so we're going to let them have a little bit of fire brother jd is going to be in they're coming in i don't know how they're going to pull it off but they're planning to drive in saturday and make it to the gathering and so brother jason is planning to have a little something for the for that junior youth group over a way at their own little camp fire while brother richie gathers around the bigger fire with us and i think if the lord doesn't change his mind he's going to give us his testimony and i just want to say again that i would implore every uh one that wants to be amazed at the glory of god and what god can do to a man's life uh come and hear that testimony and especially all the senior youth i'm gonna send them out uh um an invitation and i'm gonna send the cops to their house and beat on the door amen i wanna i wanna try to get them all there because it is so so very impacting and then of course we're gonna probably go from like three to seven thirty because we have church the next morning and then you know it's dark so quickly and i don't want the cleanup teams to have to be cleaning late into the night so probably run from about 3 p.m to 7 30 p.m somewhere around in there that time so we'll be we'll we'll be eating at three now my girls have figured out a whole system they're going to do my daughter-in-law's along with sister debbie trying to help them and sister jean also have her popcorn machine there and so we're looking forward everybody wants to come now praise the lord so amen i don't know if she'll dress up in her prairie dress or not you're going to do that sister mom praise the lord so if you haven't seen her in her prairie dress it is it is a sight to behold amen make you want to go back and live in the old days again and so uh we'll have that going and then um so uh they're they're gonna we're what we what we're going to need to do is you know be prudent concerning the pandemic and the virus going around we're going to take some extra steps now granted it's outdoors so we gain a little bit because you know the science tells us that outdoors there's a lot less risk however on the flip side you know inside here you know when you're seated you're you're masked up we're not doing handshaking all that well at a fellowship dinner almost all of that's going to go on so so we almost lose what we gain or it equals out so we are going to do some other things where my girls are going to have it all prepared and we're going to have barbecue and the fixins but it'll all be prepared individually we'll even have individual canned beverages so that we're not everybody grabbing one bottle or everybody grabbing one ice scooper so we're trying to think ahead and be proactive and uh and then the servers will have gloves on and masks and so we're just trying to be safe as is prudent and as i've said here and i say it without any hesitation we have not operated in fear at all but we have been prudent and the lord has honored that we have not had there's been a number of churches with terrible outbreaks that went through and so far the lord has spared us from that as far as we know no one has contracted it by coming to service here they get it going other places so the people who go other places but don't come to church this is the safest place you can be amen so uh we have a we're we're undefeated amen in assembly so praise the lord so we're going to take extra steps because we do want to be prudent and you know and be sensible be smart about it and so we are going to take and there might be some other little things that i'm forgetting but we are i just want you to know that we are thinking ahead proactively about ways to do it more safely being that it's a church dinner function slash gathering amen so that's going to be three to roughly 7 30 on saturday this coming saturday amen you love the lord and we're here tonight we're going to have the lord's supper and uh i know that there's you know we've got a number of prayer requests of people who are sick and uh who wanted to be here in church but i wouldn't let them and they asked me you know you think it'd be all right if i come and i just said nope the rule is if you're sick at all if you think if you even think that you have an illness just please don't come and those are some of the things that we've done uh also to keep we've installed air circulation systems that destroy um those the the virus and things like that and a host of other microorganisms so we're trying to do everything that we can and so we don't have everybody here tonight to be able to take communion so i'm considering strongly doing it every wednesday night for the rest of this year amen and and uh you know the catholics do it every weekend they have mass every sunday so my goodness how hard can it be amen and so you know at least at least you if i do that at least you'll know on wednesday nights you're going to get a short sermon amen so amen praise the lord i can hear brother eddie amen and from heaven amen so we're we're going to go right to the word of god tonight and we're going to have the lord supper i'm sorry we can't do the foot washing but that's again that's a step of prudence why we're not doing that uh so what's inside the fellowship hall it's too close in proximity and blah blah so we're going to wait and wait till we can get a little bit past this and we'll pick it back up but i'm seriously considering doing that if we don't do it every wednesday might do it every other wednesday for the rest of the year at least a man so you know i i think friends that god would honor something like that i do believe that i don't think it would become ho hum to us i think it might it might create a sincerity that we've needed amen so praise the lord to keep you living clean anyway that's for sure amen well you should be living clean anyway right amen the holy spirit produces a holy life um i don't think i'm missing any of my announcements if i am somebody can let me know and i've got all my prayer requests if somebody streaming has any other prayer requests let me know oh lastly also and i'll announce this again sunday we are still receiving uh special earmarked missionary offerings for central america and the philippine islands we've already sent funds in both directions uh there's still quite a need we'd like to be able to send some more and we will be doing that with what's already coming in and so if you still want to do that you can use the church paypal you can put it in the offering basket you can hand it to me however you want to do it just make sure you put a special note on the memo for um the catastrophe in central america and and the philippine islands so we're trying to help out with that number of other churches are we want to be able to do our part amen god bless you now i've really used up half of my 20 minutes and so let's look at matthew chapter 26. and beginning at verse 26 we'll read down through verse 30. matthew chapter 26 verses 26 through 30. and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to the to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink all of it for this is my blood in the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins isn't that wonderful but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom and when they had sung a hymn they went out unto the mount of olives let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and i you see the special purpose that i have in my heart and i just stand before you humbly because i owe you everything lord i owe you every thought every word that i'm going to say tonight i owe it all to you you gave it to me lord and you gave me a special purpose and you and i have had quite a bit of discussion on it lord for weeks now and so tonight lord is for me somewhat of a of a new beginning a new front that we're we're drawing weapons to bear on the enemy and father so we're asking for your help now tonight in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends you can be seated i'm speaking tonight as i sent you the title out earlier today the surety of security bound up in the love of god the surety of security bound up in the love of god there's quite a bit to say about the love of god and i'm gonna have to go quickly tonight i have a uh kind of a special thing on my heart that i want to not that this is a part of a series but it's it is it is tonight i was explaining to brother bruce i said tonight i'm going to take my first full broadside volley right into the heart of the enemy uh you know and i have a special purpose in that you know i believe friends that we are near the coming of the lord and i believe that that that that the bride around the world really needs god to come on the scene and many churches need fresh revival and i'm going to tell you this church needs some fresh revival and i need some and you need some how many want it amen you remember that you know the thing about revival is that you can't make it happen brother branham teaches us you can't make that happen he said god has to do that what you can do is pray for god to do it and you can try to prepare yourself now what you actually can do is once god does bring a revival he says then it's up to you to keep it going and so uh you know we we want to begin to prepare our hearts because we live in a very calamitous hour and i'm just a little bit loud by the trav not a whole lot down but maybe just a little bit might be the monitors if you hear me find out there it might just be monitors up here amen praise the lord that does sound a little better maybe a little more monitors back though not just find the happy medium where you were between where you are and you have it amen so you know jesus here in in in our we don't normally take it the communion service from matthew 26 usually i'm in john chapter 13 and we go from there but i was led here by the lord and and i think that it's it's because of this particular two particular sentences in matthew's rendering where he said for this is my blood in the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins and and i just think that that's an important statement i think that his broken body and his shed blood friends is a remedy for any disease amen it doesn't matter what it is it doesn't matter if it's cancer or covet it doesn't matter what disease it is his broken body and shed blood is a remedy for any disease it is a remedy for any condition of life no matter how critical and i i want you to absorb that tonight as we take the lord's supper i want you to remember the words of the lord jesus that this bread and this wine represents my body broken for you and my blood which is the life in the blood in the new testament by the holy ghost and i'm here to tell you something friends there is no disease that can take you when god decides to heal you and there and you can you can believe for the uh a healing of every affliction it doesn't matter what it is if if god decides not to well then that's just god's love anyway and and brother branham said he might commit you to suffering as he did job he might commit you to death as he did paul we've lost people praying for them that doesn't change god's word that doesn't undo calvary that doesn't take the efficacy of of what his broken body i'm here to tell you don't let the devil tell you that any situation is an evidence that god is suddenly can't keep his word that i don't care what your condition in life is i don't care what it is it doesn't matter how critical it is his blood and his broken body is sufficient a sufficient remedy for everything any affliction any sickness whether physical or emotional or spiritual so whether it's in your body in your spirit or in your soul i'm here to tell you his broken body and his shed blood can fix anything there is nothing beyond the reach of god's power when you you know when you need healing for the the weakness that this age has caused and we have it we have it this age is as has arrived at such a time in the atmospheres that it has it is a laodicea has a poison and a toxin in its in its atmospheres you say oh i don't i don't have this in my home and i don't participate in that brother branham said the lid's torn off of hell and demon powers are streaming through the earth it doesn't matter where you go what you're doing let me tell you something friends even coming to church you've got a battle against satan even sitting here right now hearing the word of god you've got a battle against satan and him trying to make you doubt everything i want to tell you tonight don't doubt god the bible teaches us that we're never to limit the god of israel don't despise the day of even small things amen little as much if god is in it any affliction i want to repeat it any sickness all the weakness that this age is causing you know when you need maybe you just are here tonight and you just need a replenishing of the energy that laodicea has taken from you that spiritual energy that spiritual feeling that moistness of the holy ghost i'm going to tell you something friends we'd like to all imagine that we never have those kinds of problems but we do we have problems where sometimes we we feel like our prayers get no higher than the ceiling we feel dry we feel alone well you're never alone good news you're never alone and and i'm here to tell you that all it takes is a prayer and a willingness to pray until you break through because god will respond to that jesus promised that i you know you you you i was speaking to a brother one time a very fine brother very good brother and the enemy had tricked him into believing that you know that god wouldn't wouldn't answer his prayers and he said i said well you should praise and i pray brother jason and he's not he you know i pray and nothing's happening i pray some more and nothing happens and i pray some more he's not he's not responding to me and i said listen oh friend that's contrary to his promise his promise is is that if you seek you'll find and if you knock it will be open now that's his word are you going to believe you are you're going to believe yourself you're going to believe the devil you're going to believe laodicea are you going to believe the lord jesus i'm going to tell you something friends he keeps all of his appointments he keeps his word and this this age this world this this world has taken something from us the word of god is what you need don't ever let the devil tell you otherwise jesus already proved it in the wilderness he proved that in the wilderness that all he needed was the word so this has already been certified friends it's already beyond question jesus already proved it three's a witness and he allowed the devil to come three times and three times jesus smacked him with the word and you know what it worked one time didn't do it two times didn't do it but three times did it amen you have to realize this and here is a very helpful thought that i believe the lord will help you with tonight if you can get if you can get your mind around this is that we are becoming something amen and you've got to realize that you're not here idling time you're not here figuring it out you're not here just being a christian until the lord comes that's not it it's not okay you're born again see you in heaven it's not about that you're becoming something god is doing a work in our lives and you need to remember that lest you get wearied unless this draining age and the trials that we face and the disappointments and and we do feel worried we do this is an age and brother branham you know brother brother brother uh brother williams i mean brother williams talks talks about that sunday remember and he said he said you know i'm i'm tired of wearing a mask he said i'm tired of thinking about a mask and i want to tell you something friends covid has taken something from us now i'm coming to my burden we have fought this thing as a nation and as a global population probably you know almost the entire year probably solidly the last nine to ten months and it has and we've had you know it's caused church services to be limited fellowship to be limited everything's strained everything's limited everything's hindered we can't we don't that that freedom we used to have you know we a lot of times we took it for granted and now we're always we're under always thinking about i got to do this there's i just would i just like to go and have a day where i could just go and be free and not have to worry about it and and it has taken something from us as a church listen bethel tabernacle i'm going to tell you it's taken something from us as a church amen it's hindered a lot of our lives it's hindered mine it's hindered yours it's taken a toll but you know i i i have a word for you tonight and that is that the grace of god in his word not only can restore it it's here to restore it and i suppose i could almost just stop preaching right there on that one thought and just say don't fear little flock it's the lord's pleasure to give you the kingdom and he has a word here and he has an anointing here and he has a grace here i know you're tired i'm tired we're weary the whole world is weary but i'm here to tell you we ain't got much further to go and god is looking for a bride to stand up and be rugged amen not to be whiny not to be prickly and sticky and and our and our fellowship is hindered and our church serves are hindered and and i and i have had to to stand back and through sadness see the spiritual toll that it has taken on many people many of my flock because just the very ability to come to church is hindered and some hardly can muster enough wherewithal to come at all thank god for streaming i'm so glad i'm so glad for your if you're at home tonight and that's 90 of of how of your church service is streaming i'm glad you have it but me and jesus would rather you be here see how do you know he feels that way because he said that in his word the grace of god in his word is here to restore us and it will i want to look you in the eye right now and assure you it will it's what's keeping you alive now it's what's keeping you going now it can it can and it will and it is bringing you to the image god saw of you before the foundation of the world and i'm here to tell you something friends that's the only image that counts and that's the only image i care about i i just want to i want to get back to that place that god saw me before there was ever stardust and i had fellowship with him that's where i'm trying to get to and i'm here to tell you that's the word that we have in this hour hallelujah before the foundation of the world it will bring you to that it already is bringing you to that you're already standing in an age of impossibility and yet you're still standing when the world is falling apart i'm still here when the world is filled with fear the bride has shalom [Music] amen you are standing and god is doing it god is doing it amen god is doing it you know hear me out now don't anybody throw anything at me i'm about to make a statement there's a great many things god can't do say what's a that's anathema that's heresy that's blasphemy no it's not i'll have you agree with me in the next few minutes there's actually a lot of things god can't do say an all-powerful omniscient omnipresent god there's things he can't do there's quite a few amen there's a a nice number of things that god can't do you know the bible teaches us god can't be tempted amen you ever thought about that god can't be tempted you know it's it's amazing how the devil operates in this world i mean sometimes i think devil do you honestly do you really think that you can tempt god into acting irrational do you think you could just make him mad enough to where he'd just lose it you'd think you could just where god would just you know get so frustrated and i say to the devil do you do you honestly believe that that i could do something bad enough and you go tell on me and god gets so mad that he would kick me out of his family i got news for you satan god can't be tempted amen and it doesn't matter what you do i'll always be in his family i love that the devil cannot tempt god into making rash judgments or snap decisions and that's what satan anoints people to do that's what laodicea is all about irrational thinking rash snap shoot from the hip you know somebody blow a horn get out and shoot him dead you know irrational things and you know do things that don't make sense i've always said it it proves it's an evil spirit because it makes you do things that don't even make common sense and and but god is immune god is immune from the influence of laodicea he is immune from temptation by the devil amen amen how would you like to be you're his family you're his family i'm here to tell you something friend god has a vaccine god has a vaccine you know what it is faith in his word hallelujah it'll meet every challenge it'll keep you sane it'll keep you sensible keep you rational keep you believing keep you confessing keep you pressing and let whoever once jump out i'm pressing on if they don't want their seat on the old ship of zion fine i'll take it hallelujah god has a vaccine and i want to tell you something friends he has the ability to inoculate you and and and it doesn't matter what the devil does say you know like i said earlier well haven't we had haven't we had losses haven't we had deaths haven't we prayed when people still died anyway those weren't defeats those were victories you can't defeat god you can't defeat the family of god you can't defeat the purpose of god if we were praying and god took them anyway blessed be the name of the lord you see friends we look at life all together different from this insane world the whole earth is terrified about a virus that has a mortality rate ranging anywhere from they're saying like and this is all the latest as of today i've looked it up fresh and it and it ranges the best best science from the world health organization says if it's a infant up to like a year or two old it's like a 0.0001 mortality rate if it's a five-year-old and then if it moves up to a ten-year-old and by a ten-year-old i think it becomes a 0.01 and then if it's a 25 year old then it's like you know one point something and then if it's a 30 you know and it just keeps and by the time you get to 85 and above 85 years old it ranges from 0.0001 all the way up to 15 depending on your age and even at even at 85 and above the mortality rate averaging globally is about 15 and the whole world is locked down in fear over a virus with a mortality rate of 15 percent you say brother jason are you trying to diminish it no i'm trying to give you a comparison isn't it amazing that the world is running with fear and they're passing laws and politics and courts and judges and politicians and presidents and premiers and kings and queens and they're making all these decisions when you've got a mortality rate ranging from less than one up to 15 when when the virus of sin has a hundred percent mortality rate the virus of sin has a 100 percent mortality rate and there is no human vaccine against it you cannot save yourself you cannot heal yourself sin is going to take you out it's it's sure that as soon as you're born you've got a death sentence on you the the virus of sin that satan tricked eve with in the garden of eden is here today and the world is running crazy over a 001 to 15 and they have no concern at all about 100 mortality they seem completely unconcerned well imagine that a god who can't be tempted imagine being able to be immune from temptation and all the vices of laodicea immune from the insanity that mankind is descending into i'm here announcing to you tonight god has a vaccine for that he can inoculate you against all the vices of laodicea he can inoculate you against the against the descending insanity he can inoculate you from the fear that is causing men's hearts to fail how many want that vaccine the whole world men's hearts are failing for fear and listen we're not just talking about a coronary you know where they shock you and they can't get you back and you're dead and let's let's go from the physical into the spiritual realm you know there there are things that are happening in the world where men's hearts are failing in their mind and in their emotions to the degree that suicides are is going through the roof and i was telling you sunday i think in japan suicide is several times over what covet is doing because people are locked away i'm here to tell you something friends there's a vaccine that comes in the word of god that can inoculate your heart and keep you strong and keep you healthy and keep you happy and keep you in victory physically emotionally spiritually hallelujah god offers your mind a place of safety and peace to do always that which pleases the father and i think there's nothing i could accomplish more valuable in life to been to be able to say that there's a lot of things god can't do he can't be tempted you know what else he can't do he can't be defeated is there a risk is there a risk satan can stop him nope you think there's a risk you can stop him i can't stop him you can't stop him elections can't stop him governments can't stop him vatican can't stop him lgbtq can't stop him liberal agenda can't stop him no one can stop him he can't be defeated amen that's the god you're serving tonight a god who is immune from the irrational temptations of the world a god who cannot be defeated it doesn't matter what they do in politics it doesn't matter what rome does it doesn't matter what russia does it doesn't matter what our community does our god cannot be defeated you know what else he can't do he can't lie amen i thought to myself when i wrote that down i thought to myself is there anything more comforting in the world a god that can't lie is there anything that you can think of more comforting than than the then the inability to lie in a world where lying is the norm lying is the norm it's so the norm that the politicians on both sides admit we do it we do it to get elected they even are unabashedly shamelessly admit that you know and they ask one you know you said this in the primary debate and you know what the answer is that was just a debate okay that's what my point is you you said this in the debate yeah but it was just a debate like in other words it didn't matter it didn't count i'm thinking why do we have it then if it doesn't matter it doesn't count why even bother with it where everyone seems to have an agenda and and and and that's in the world we live in everybody's got an agenda and i'm here to tell you that you're serving a god who's always honest and never lies never is deceitful never deceives and in a world where everyone has an agenda and every move and i don't care how how good the move might look there's always a rub or a caveat or a however it you never get it you know how about a friend who'll just tell you the truth how many want that in your life and just say the whole truth and nothing but the truth if it's good news i want it if it's bad news i want it if it hurts me i want it if it helps me i want it whatever it is i want the truth and it's so hard to find this is the kind of word that i want to live by the whole truth nothing but the truth no buts no doubts no conditions just truth in case you don't think that's important let me tell you your life depends on it billions of people are going to perish because they're believing a lie and here you have the truth and you have the truther i just invent a word god is the ultimate truther amen your family's lives depend on it everything you love everything you love depends on you hearing the truth and believing the truth think of everything that's dear to you if you don't have the truth you can't save you and you can't save them now how valuable is it to you that we have a god who's here in his word who cannot lie you know what else god can't do oh there's a bunch more things he can't do he can't break a promise now that's different than lying because you know lying requires an intent to deceive you can't accidentally lie so you can't accidentally lie because to lie it requires an intent to deceive or mislead that's why guile is the same thing and so guile is just where you tell just enough truth to mislead someone and so it's still a lie brother branham used goll and called it a lie see and and so you you find that you know the whole world is with their agenda always telling things in order just enough to telling you just enough truth selling you on just enough of the truth having no it knowing that you're never going to get the payoff and so i want to offer you someone tonight to control your life i got a deal you can't refuse i want to introduce you tonight church to someone who was willing to control your life if you let him who never breaks a promise ever amen you'll never have to worry about a disappointment you can wake up in the morning without suspicion you can go forward through the day without looking you can fall asleep at night without checking this is a dependable faithful truthful can't be defeated can't be tempted god in his word and it's offered to us tonight how many takers do i got who'll say i'll take that one who can't be tempted who can't lie who can't break a promise who can't be defeated you know what else he can't do he can't fail hallelujah well you know when you can laugh and brother branham said if your faith is right and you're sitting in the doctor's office and he says you got three months to live you can laugh in his face it's not disrespect to the doctor who you appreciate it's just that it doesn't matter because if god wants to take me home fine but the devil sure ain't gonna take me out because by his stripes i'm already healed think about it friends imagine when you can laugh in the face of your enemy no matter what it is every challenge any adversity when an enemy when an enemy jumps in your face and says i'm going to destroy you and i'll give you three minutes to surrender and you look right back at him and say you're gonna give me three minutes yes i don't require one i don't need 30 seconds to make up my mind i don't believe you i believe him hallelujah take your best shot devil because i don't care i don't care i've already been sold out to the word of god and there is no weapon formed against me that can prosper hallelujah we look at it completely different in different ways from the world the world is fighting flesh and blood i'm not here fighting flesh and blood i'm conquering devils that's the real enemy flesh and blood's not your real enemy devils are your real enemy you know what else he can't do i got to hurry i got so many things god can't do it might take me a little bit you good give me another give me another seven or eight minutes i like this one he can't change his mind about his word amen all i have to do is see how he acted in the past and i don't need him to tell me the future i don't need him to tell me the future all i got to do is see how he acted in the past and when i get into the future i'll already know what he's going to do why because he can never change his mind about his word because that's true i don't need him to explain every little thing that happens to me in my life i don't need him to do that i'm not the first child of god to encounter trials i'm not the first child of god to have failures i won't be the last one say listen friends satan is going to fight until he's destroyed just own that get over it satan is going to fight until he's destroyed so don't ever think well he's going to take a holiday he's not going to take a holiday i'm here to tell you something he's increasing his efforts he's like a roaring lion because he knows he only has a little while and so if i got to fight him well then let's fight him with faith let's fight him without fear let's believe a god who can't change his mind i'm glad that i can say with all sincerity that the devil does not matter anything he does is allowed and nothing he does is permanent not even death his greatest weapon his greatest weapon imagine how sad it must be to be the devil that his greatest weapon has no effect on god's family amen amen see it doesn't even matter jesus said if you believe on me you'll never die ever and that a beautiful promise no weapon formed against me can prosper man you talking about a you know here here here here's here's let me come to this last one i love this one the best and we're going to go to the lord's supper here's something he can't do he can't remember sin cast into his sea glory i thought you might like that when i saved the best one for last he can't be tempted he can't be defeated he can't lie he can't break a promise he can't change his mind about his word but the to me the most beautiful thing is he can't remember sin cast in to his sea no wonder no weapon formed against you can prosper you you're talking about a reset button you're talking about a respawn you're talking about a redo you know you you you have an enemy we have an enemy here say my brother jason if you only knew what an enemy satan is okay can i adjust your thinking you have an enemy that took a beating in the wilderness amen you have an enemy that took a beating in his own house a few hours after calvary when jesus kicked the front door in and walked into his party and brother brown i love the way brother branham says you can tell he used to be a boxer he said he grabbed satan by the neck and slapped him knocked him to the ground and and put his foot on him and jerked the keys off of his hip and went and unlocked paradise and let captivity captive i'm here to tell you he took a beating on resurrection morning he took a beating in the book of acts he took a beating listen he took a beating on ohio river he took a beating in the arizona desert hallelujah he took a beating in south africa he's taking a beating right here in beaufort friends that's the kind of god that we serve do you understand do you understand why a prophet could say to you in the middle of satan's eden in the middle of a world falling apart he could look at a bride and go shalom brother branham i thought you said the world's falling apart well it is and actually i preached it twice it's again falling apart so what what should i do rest little bride all is well but it's satan's eden right just rest but he's the god of this evil age shalom good morning yes it's a dark day for the world but arise shine light light has come oh my do you understand friends we're fighting an enemy that's totally defeated an enemy that it's already too late for i love saying that to him satan the truth is it's actually already too late fight on i'm just telling you it's already too late you've actually already passed the opportunity to beat me and you'll never get it again because why i serve a god who can't be defeated so jesus took bread and he blessed it and he broke it and he gave to his disciples and said take heat this is my body and he took the cup and he gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it now can you imagine in that cup was going to be his blood in the new testament he knew what that blood meant for him in just a few hours and when he takes it and knows what it means the bible said he gave thanks he gave thanks can you understand friends can you just say tonight it doesn't matter what happens to the world or what the devil does i'm going to give thanks to god for everything of his love and his grace in my life for this is my blood in the new testament take this friends this is a medicine you ready for a bat you ready for a vaccine this is my blood in the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom so jesus went away corporally but he returned in spirit to live in us and and and and you know just just like just like you know the world can't see that and and that's fine because that's just like we were saying as brother branham said you know about sister bell he said sister bell is asleep to us but awake to god see sister seal brother eddie all of them they're asleep to us but they're awake to god amen and so they're awake we can't see them but they're awake and god is in you the world can't see it but he's alive and he lives inside me he's in me he's with me all the way to the end he said i'm going away you keep doing this till i come back and when i have this meal with you again we'll be home forever you keep doing this i'm going away you keep doing this till i get back and when i have this meal with you again we'll be home we'll be home we'll be home ain't that wonderful we'll be home friends home free oh hallelujah come musicians i gotta stop i turned a 20-minute sermon into 40 minutes praise the lord amen praise the lord god bless your friends don't you love him

healing for your soul healing for your mind healing for father your physical body this blood representing the new the the covenant of the holy spirit in the new testament there's no virtue lord in the wine but the symbolism of what of what it stands for and as we take it this is our opportunity lord to come in a public way much like baptism to declare i want to be identified with the body and blood of the lord jesus christ we don't turn this bread into your body that's not even scriptural amen first of all it couldn't be your body because i'm your body we're your body we're the body of christ and i pray father that'll be a reality to us tonight as we come we commit it to you in jesus name amen sister deborah just continue to play um we won't be singing but just keep playing sister deb and

there's nothing we could pray greater than that consume me lord let the fires of god consume everything contrary so that when it's done with its cleansing there's nothing left standing but an image of your word every element of the world in our minds and our hearts our souls driven from us lord consumed by the fires of god so that we stand pure clean holy worthy under the blood of christ usable by the holy spirit it's what we want lord i don't want to just pass my my time here in life without a purpose but i realized lord that the plain truth is no matter how bad we want it you require dedication you require consecration you won't you won't operate so freely in someone who's not it doesn't take away the gene of god it doesn't take away their experience but my how it limits the glory that you could gain through their life [Music] help us lord help me we stand here lord in humility before you having taken your supper lord the bible says having loved them he loved them unto the end and we thank you for that we look forward to that day when you'll take this supper with us again we'll be home free oh my home free thank you for that promise i know you'll keep it [Music] go with us
