[33:04] man god bless you this morning greets in
[33:08] the name of the Lord we're happy to be
[33:10] in service again today I trust that
[33:13] you're reaping out there on the
[33:15] streaming the labor of the brothers
[33:18] they've worked tirelessly to make sure
[33:19] that stream is working good we are
[33:22] certainly still aware that we still have
[33:24] more work to do so we continue to ask
[33:27] you to pray for us and to be patient
[33:29] amen as we're fixing a number of things
[33:32] on on all ends but we're working hard on
[33:36] it the brothers have worked tirelessly
[33:38] all day yesterday even some of them here
[33:40] after midnight last night so just keep
[33:44] them in prayer amen but Anthony I got a
[33:47] they were hitting the chat saying
[33:49] brother Anthony's singing like there's
[33:51] 500 people a man and brother Diggs and I
[33:54] were in the back we concurred Amen
[33:56] praise the Lord
[33:58] we're happy to have brother Diggs with
[34:00] us today and he was scheduled I was
[34:03] supposed to be in Phoenix cuz we had
[34:04] those meetings so we scheduled him to be
[34:06] in here to cover base for me and so we I
[34:10] talked to him several weeks ago we
[34:12] decided this to carry on he said he
[34:13] don't mind at all preaching to a few
[34:15] brothers here and preaching to the
[34:16] Internet audience so we want to invite
[34:18] brother Diggs to come onto the platform
[34:20] give us what the Lord has forced today
[34:23] how many enjoyed by the Jason's Sunday
[34:25] school class I thought I don't know
[34:27] maybe it's because it was cumulative but
[34:29] I thought part six was that was the best
[34:32] so far I've enjoyed every one of them it
[34:34] just keeps building and keeps building
[34:36] keeps getting gooder and gooder as we
[34:39] say I did I get astounded every time
[34:41] that brother Jason just goes right in
[34:44] and makes it so incontrovertible by the
[34:46] history by the verifiable history you
[34:51] you can't deny what the brother you
[34:54] can't sensibly deny what the brother is
[34:57] bringing out about how the whole
[34:59] misconception and the Trinity and
[35:01] everything became such a political
[35:04] movement today said about by men who
[35:06] weren't even Christians mind and history
[35:09] is is replete with evidence like that
[35:11] amen so I sure
[35:13] appreciate that a man with brother Jason
[35:15] we had to send him home right after his
[35:17] Sunday School class because we can't
[35:19] have more than ten in the in the
[35:22] sanctuary we want to obey that very very
[35:25] strictly and also social distancing
[35:28] brothers please remember for prudence
[35:31] for wisdom and - so that we can honestly
[35:34] say we are complying with the request of
[35:38] the federal government and CDC makes
[35:40] sure that we have no more than two
[35:42] brothers in the booth they're keeping
[35:44] distance apart
[35:45] we're not shaking hands are embracing
[35:47] we're fist and elbow bumping or even
[35:49] virtual bumping say man so we're trying
[35:53] to monitor that very closely appreciate
[35:56] all of you brothers being here to make
[35:57] the service possible let's sing some
[35:59] more that Ruth Andrews brother Diggs
[36:01] comes
[36:03] [Music]
[36:10] [Applause]
[36:16] [Music]
[36:23] right
[36:27] [Music]
[36:34] [Music]
[36:48] ha
[36:51] [Music]
[36:55] a man praise the Lord it's good to be in
[37:01] the house of God and to know that God is
[37:03] in control of everything in our lives as
[37:07] always we certainly appreciate pastor
[37:09] Jason and you know for allowing us to
[37:12] come having us and and we give on and
[37:15] thanks to Jesus Christ and we want to
[37:17] greet everyone again on the streaming or
[37:21] higher your getting the service but we
[37:24] pray that your heart is not settled with
[37:28] being away from church that we're
[37:30] praying and we're doing everything we
[37:32] can do to gather together again you know
[37:36] because the Bible says as we see these
[37:37] things approach that we want to
[37:39] fellowship the more so our heart should
[37:42] be longing to be in the presence of one
[37:44] another if you are okay with not coming
[37:49] to church you need to search yourself
[37:51] amen amen because you actually if we all
[37:56] got Jesus in to us why wouldn't you want
[37:58] to be around Jesus amen so we we
[38:01] appreciate God and again like bruh jason
[38:04] said you know you want to render to
[38:05] Caesar what is Caesar's but let's have a
[38:08] word of Prayer and we'll get right into
[38:09] the Word of God Lord Jesus father we
[38:12] know that these are perilous times Lord
[38:15] and many people are troubled and many
[38:18] things are taking place but Lord we know
[38:20] that we serve a God who's never taken by
[38:23] surprise we know that you're always on
[38:26] your throne and your all-seeing eye is
[38:28] always looking at your children and
[38:30] father we know that you've never lost
[38:32] one and you even leave the 99 to go get
[38:35] that one so father we put all our hope
[38:37] and trust in you for you our Jehovah
[38:40] Jireh and we know that you're still upon
[38:42] the mercy seat and your blood is still
[38:45] atoning for our lives Lord so father we
[38:48] pray that our minds are steadfast on the
[38:52] Lord that we concentrate on the will of
[38:54] God and the purpose of God in these
[38:56] times lower than we bind the spirit of
[38:59] fear in a very presence of fear that are
[39:02] trying to take our focus from what you
[39:04] are doing Lord to live in
[39:07] natural rim when we are supernatural
[39:08] beings Lord no we thank you we give you
[39:11] honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name
[39:13] we pray amen
[39:14] you know I just feel sorry for one
[39:18] person and that's that's the no no I'm
[39:22] gonna brought my useless okay okay um by
[39:28] the grace of God you know I just feel
[39:30] sorry for one brother's cameraman he's
[39:34] not gonna get a break today so he's just
[39:38] gonna do what God call us to do a man we
[39:41] certainly enjoyed the worship amen
[39:43] you know I think God for brother Tony a
[39:46] man just coming out here and set the
[39:48] atmosphere right and all the musicians
[39:50] and everyone so let's turn to Luke the
[39:53] 14th chapter Luke 14 st. Luke 14 let's
[40:01] start reading at the start reading at
[40:05] verse 25 the Bible says and there where
[40:10] great multitudes with him and he turned
[40:15] and said unto them if any man come unto
[40:18] me and hate not his father and mother
[40:21] and wife and children and brothers and
[40:24] sisters yay and his own life also he
[40:30] cannot be my disciple my though that
[40:34] sounds kind of rough God is saying don't
[40:37] put nobody before me he says and
[40:40] whosoever does not bear his cross and
[40:43] come after me cannot be my disciple for
[40:48] which of you intending to build a tower
[40:52] sitteth not down first and counted the
[40:56] cost whether he have sufficient to
[40:58] finish this happily after he have laid
[41:03] the foundation and it is not able to
[41:05] finish it all that behold it began to
[41:10] mock him oh my let's go to Romans
[41:13] chapter 8 Romans
[41:20] Chapter eight
[41:22] I'm gonna read a familiar verse out of
[41:26] here Romans eight and let's just reverse
[41:30] well that's God at verse 18 the Bible
[41:33] says Romans eight and 18 for I reckon
[41:37] that the sufferings of this present time
[41:39] are not worthy to be compared with the
[41:42] glory which God shall the glory which
[41:46] shall be revealed in us for the earnest
[41:50] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[41:53] the manifestation of the sons of God
[41:55] they made a lot of blessing to read of
[41:57] his word you didn't have your seats amen
[42:01] you know by the grace of God today I
[42:04] want to use for a subject the cost of
[42:07] being positionally placed or you can say
[42:12] the cost of being put in place but we
[42:15] wanna we wanna count what I want to do
[42:20] today I want to take the authority of
[42:25] covet 19 completely away and I want to
[42:30] take the focus of that completely away
[42:33] and what I want to establish today
[42:36] something that we should all be aware of
[42:39] is that God is in control amen
[42:42] if there's any sickness God has allowed
[42:45] if someone in your family is affected by
[42:49] the sickness God has allowed oh yeah but
[42:53] the question I want to expose what is
[42:56] God doing for us what do we see hey man
[42:59] where are you in this journey haruya of
[43:03] these of this troubling time and I want
[43:07] to say it if I can say it like this
[43:09] there is a cost to be paying haruya
[43:13] there is something that somebody has to
[43:17] answer for amen
[43:18] but I wouldn't when I say it like that
[43:22] there's a cost to be paid when we read a
[43:25] loop the 14th chapter Jesus is saying
[43:29] we're here he says you got to forsake
[43:31] your children
[43:32] you got to forsake your wife your
[43:35] husband oh your kinfolk to walk with me
[43:38] oh yeah
[43:39] now there is a cost to walk with God but
[43:43] how many of us are looking at earlier
[43:45] that cost of walking with God as being a
[43:49] blessing oh yeah because whatever you
[43:51] lose you get back a hundredfold if you
[43:55] stick with God earlier but to no tension
[43:58] when we look through the scriptures and
[43:59] we we run down that that the people of
[44:03] God heylia serving him it always cost
[44:08] him something oh yeah and we hear that
[44:11] brother Branham saying we're not high
[44:13] bad plants every wheel has to be sanded
[44:16] and all these things basically saying
[44:19] that it will cost you to serve God
[44:21] Georgia will go back into history in the
[44:24] church agents and you'll get the
[44:25] churches before us it cost them great
[44:28] things to walk with God and we are
[44:31] standing on their shoulders right now oh
[44:33] yeah and we should we should not be
[44:37] afraid to say Lord pretty girls are
[44:40] suffering because instant suffering that
[44:45] makes you follow into your adoption oh
[44:48] yeah this is the calling of the cows
[44:52] that puts you in prayer earlier and
[44:55] desperation oh yeah with a slow
[44:58] desperation with astral tribulation
[45:00] they're still suffering there's still
[45:02] Haggerty there's no pain earlier you
[45:05] have no reason to get closer to God so
[45:09] God allows things to happen just two
[45:12] jaws closed up clearly God allows things
[45:15] to happen hardly just so he can show up
[45:19] and show all of his greatness I oh yeah
[45:23] sighs I don't know about you earlier but
[45:25] in our church we've been experiencing
[45:27] some of the best services you might say
[45:31] we're brothers in this time of adversity
[45:32] in this time of trial
[45:34] you should yes you should be
[45:38] experiencing the goodness and greatness
[45:40] of God so I want to use for my mama my
[45:45] mama
[45:46] subject or inspiration my my subtitle
[45:49] refocus let's refocus for a minute
[45:53] earlier let's take our eyes off code 19
[45:57] and let's look behind the scenes we know
[46:01] haruya through through a prophet of the
[46:04] hour that all these things are already
[46:07] prophesied
[46:09] even in the Bible that there be
[46:11] pestilence
[46:12] they'll be sickness they'll be famine
[46:14] hunger in the land so turn move be
[46:20] shaking holy we should be looking in the
[46:22] Bible looking at our surroundings oh
[46:26] it's time to get out of here let's
[46:30] refocus huh
[46:33] but what we're doing we're running back
[46:38] and forth
[46:38] I need hand sanitizer we're running back
[46:41] and forth I need this I need that now do
[46:43] what you got to do according to your
[46:44] faith but let me tell you something hey
[46:47] your pretty little sanitized in heaven
[46:51] and when the real tribulation come you
[46:55] ain't gonna give me
[46:58] so this persecution that we're
[47:01] experiencing the things that I have now
[47:03] I know some of you gonna say yeah
[47:05] brother
[47:05] we wanna be right well I say it like
[47:07] this let's refocus are you with me let's
[47:11] refocus for me now if if I were Jason if
[47:16] I was outside and I was working in the
[47:18] yard or playing with my dog or whatever
[47:20] first thing I would do when I come back
[47:22] here before I eat or my family or
[47:26] whatever I wash my hands
[47:28] cuz that's something we naturally feel
[47:31] ugly so if it's something you naturally
[47:34] do why is the government hire you
[47:36] pushing these things with fear cuz they
[47:40] wanna steal the focus highly and make
[47:43] something that's normal
[47:44] not normal we normally do this we
[47:50] normally wash our hands oh yeah before
[47:53] we eat before we do different things but
[47:55] you look earlier the enemy is always
[47:57] push
[47:59] in the narrative Harley and I let me let
[48:01] me get away from this because I don't
[48:03] wanna I don't wanna give it no more
[48:05] credit than what it deserves oh yeah
[48:08] as far as I'm concerned hariya just
[48:12] disease honey just sick this is no more
[48:15] than what has always been and that's a
[48:18] lie spirit it's never been any more do
[48:24] we not understand focus thousand seven
[48:29] hundred people estimated that's 1
[48:39] million people here is the government
[48:43] talking about that this we focus there
[48:50] are over thirty eight huh
[48:51] Oh 38 million people sick every year
[48:55] over the flu is the government talking
[48:57] about that and we talk about how many
[49:04] people died from the flu every year it's
[49:07] the government talk about that so what
[49:11] is this all about
[49:12] it's about stealing your focus oh yeah
[49:16] taking your eyes of God earlier and
[49:19] you're missing earlier that the cost of
[49:22] this the cost of all these things that
[49:24] are taking place is really persistently
[49:28] placing people who a church it took a
[49:35] world a nation earlier the whole world
[49:38] to get in a back sitting condition a
[49:42] condition with God look there's eight
[49:44] hearts and sand that is no more than
[49:46] evil for God hurry to find grace in
[49:49] North it took the wickedness of the
[49:55] world for an ark to be born but Noah had
[50:01] to pay the costs Church their father of
[50:05] many days he wanted to just you know
[50:08] it's nice and sunny like this what he
[50:10] wanted to just go sit on the porch
[50:12] family and sit down but the cost to
[50:14] escape judgment he had to build that
[50:17] boat honey so he could always go ahead
[50:20] take his wife at the dealer because
[50:22] always who I did with his children go to
[50:24] the park he had to pay a cost her Lea
[50:27] just to be persistently placed whatever
[50:33] Church hallelujah don't lose focus you
[50:39] know what in times like this we ought to
[50:43] be enjoying it you say oh my brother you
[50:50] talk about look look at this I want to
[50:53] cover 94 miles per hour and I'm gonna
[50:57] keep saying it let's look at what God
[50:59] has given us the ability to do God is
[51:03] giving us the ability to stay home early
[51:07] spend time with your family
[51:10] don't worry about a job your jobs gonna
[51:12] be there oh yeah
[51:14] stay home spend time with your family
[51:16] spend time with your wife honey
[51:18] hey man you now brothers you get the
[51:21] opportunity to sit down with your
[51:22] children and pick their brains you
[51:27] probably couldn't do that huh a couple
[51:29] months ago when you were so busy on the
[51:31] job but God has allowed us to enter into
[51:34] his rest but always looking at it oh am
[51:41] I gonna have a job after this when God
[51:43] is giving you a time harder to interact
[51:46] with something that means way more than
[51:49] a job
[51:51] you can sit down you know and you know
[51:53] uh uh I'm uh I'm not good at this but I
[51:58] know my daughter pilot watching listen
[52:00] and you know my kids and uh uh uh uh
[52:02] my baby girl she likes just take top
[52:05] stuff you know going around doing all
[52:08] the stuffing called us so when she ain't
[52:10] ready I get the camera huh and I make a
[52:15] video she ain't ready for honey but what
[52:18] does that do
[52:19] I couldn't do that earlier months ago
[52:22] when I was so busy her
[52:24] God's given me holy by His grace he's
[52:28] giving me special time with my children
[52:30] hallelujah just to come on a level and
[52:33] reconnect let's look at the calls church
[52:40] holy and you know we're having some of
[52:43] the some of the best times you know
[52:45] riding the biking going to play ball and
[52:48] all these things we're connecting and
[52:50] people are worried about germs when the
[52:54] real germ is coming forth the germ of
[52:57] life that's what we ought to be paying
[53:00] attention you pay attention sit your
[53:04] family down you better sit down go take
[53:06] a walk with them fathers sit down with
[53:11] your boys
[53:11] I still watch their future plans let's
[53:15] refocus this is not for us as Christians
[53:21] this is not about Korea or co19 we've
[53:25] always had diseases on the arts God is
[53:31] trying to show us something
[53:33] let's refocus let's take that time
[53:37] earlier and bring forth life because
[53:40] when every cost is supposed to bring
[53:42] forth life oh yeah you take her what
[53:46] does a bear do honey
[53:48] a bear goes into a hibernation
[53:51] what does salmon do they go back to
[53:53] their birthplace struggle preach love
[53:56] life
[54:00] but look at the cost you get the cost of
[54:03] a salmon to go back to his birthplace he
[54:05] has to go upstream church and as it's
[54:08] diving as it's going it's coming down
[54:10] the rocks it's so hurt and so damaged by
[54:16] producing that birth going back to his
[54:18] birthplace it ruses his life to give
[54:21] life so look at the cost look at the
[54:27] cost of that mother salmon honey that's
[54:29] giving birth hallelujah to reform or
[54:32] salmon what is the cost it's a life for
[54:34] life
[54:38] and I'm not being insensitive about
[54:39] people that lose their life he said in
[54:44] the Bible he says look you don't think
[54:46] God has already counted the cost
[54:50] he knows whose families are gonna be
[54:52] affected you don't think God has already
[54:55] carried the cost for those of you
[54:57] brothers and sisters who's worried about
[54:59] losing your jobs you don't think God
[55:01] when this is over already got another
[55:03] job waiting on you oh my brother Jason
[55:08] said this morning are we believers or
[55:11] not I don't know about you but in these
[55:17] times I've been seeing earlier my god
[55:20] come on the scene he steals Jehovah
[55:23] Jireh holier he's still Joe Marasco he's
[55:27] still a banner he's still a sail he's
[55:29] still a shepherd let's count the cost if
[55:36] I can I don't want y'all know me I'm
[55:38] about to close oh yeah but if I can
[55:41] let's look at a church you know let's
[55:43] look in the scriptures in look at what
[55:46] it cost no one to build that boat 420s
[55:49] huh he probably didn't have the to do is
[55:53] that he wanted to sit down with his
[55:54] family why because the burden hallelujah
[55:57] to build that boat was something greater
[55:59] didn't he put there he didn't put that
[56:02] burden there God did you know he he
[56:11] probably lost precious moments oh yeah
[56:14] but what was more important fulfilling
[56:17] the thoughts of God do you do we
[56:20] understand honey
[56:22] that Ark came out of the minds of God
[56:26] and as long as Noah was building that
[56:30] boat oh yeah what he was doing shouldn't
[56:33] affected him in a negative way because
[56:36] he was right in the will of God
[56:38] so sometimes we look at the things that
[56:41] we buy the seeds that we are going to
[56:46] gain but you can't measure the grace of
[56:48] God like that because the things you
[56:52] gonna change might not be in the will of
[56:54] God for you so as long as Noah's
[57:00] building that boy boy boy I say come on
[57:03] dad let's go shoot some ball he's that
[57:05] caked hunger the pitch is getting cold
[57:12] let's keep going but what it cost Noah
[57:17] and in his old family in that moment you
[57:25] think about his neighbors huh I know
[57:27] some of us got neighbors who are
[57:28] watching us I was talking to my buddy
[57:32] I'm sorry my Crosby honey god bless him
[57:35] and sister Flo they in London right now
[57:38] and you know their laws are a little bit
[57:40] stronger than ours they can't even walk
[57:42] the streets can't even out say it was
[57:45] trying to do the live streaming and he
[57:47] he finished upon to do live streaming
[57:49] and they open the door what are you
[57:51] doing what are you going you're not
[57:54] supposed to go the threat of the
[57:57] neighbors calling the law on him does
[58:00] that sound like religious persecution to
[58:03] you see touch let's refocus someplace
[58:07] somewhere the Bible is being fulfilled
[58:12] but we look like we're we're in America
[58:14] we're not experiencing the squeeze when
[58:17] somebody else can be experiencing the
[58:19] squeeze some places they can't tote day
[58:27] Bibles some places they can't even go to
[58:31] church and it isn't a kakoen virus to do
[58:34] that let's refocus but what is it
[58:39] sometimes things happen just so God can
[58:43] put you in position
[58:46] Berner God and it might be something
[58:50] that you can't explain it might be
[58:52] something you lost dear to your heart it
[58:55] might be a child going in the world it
[58:57] might be a wife
[58:58] it might be a husband but all it is
[59:00] God put you in position remember
[59:09] remember Jacob Jacob's wife couldn't
[59:16] have any children
[59:17] holy you know he probably really wanted
[59:24] her to have children because we feel
[59:29] like I pop up my papa right how many
[59:32] want ba ba ba
[59:33] I believe she bought that fall huh well
[59:36] Rachel huh
[59:38] Rachel Rebecca wanted to she could have
[59:40] anything you know but look at the cost
[59:46] look at what it costs her so that Jacob
[59:51] might get in position she had to share
[59:56] her husband oh yeah with women she
[59:59] probably would have never done if she
[1:00:02] could have children can you imagine it
[1:00:07] but that was God putting Jacob
[1:00:11] in position and sometimes you'll be a
[1:00:15] part of something and you'd be hurt by
[1:00:18] what going on and it's God put you in
[1:00:22] position not able to have children but
[1:00:34] she's like my sister outdo me but are
[1:00:37] you brother to just give you a wife to
[1:00:38] your brother cuz you're not able to have
[1:00:42] kids
[1:00:42] think about the cost think about her
[1:00:45] emotional state oh yeah and what it felt
[1:00:49] like you want to know what it felt like
[1:00:51] let's go back to Sarah and Hagar Sarah
[1:00:57] her Leah she paid a cost for wanting the
[1:01:02] Word of God to be fulfilled huh but she
[1:01:06] didn't even realize because she had the
[1:01:10] enemy take a
[1:01:12] off of the streets of God so she got her
[1:01:18] own self and she said you know what I'm
[1:01:20] gonna make this happen
[1:01:22] she said you know what I'm gonna give
[1:01:23] you Hagar and we're gonna bring four
[1:01:25] children like that and didn't once it
[1:01:28] happened her real feelings the cost of
[1:01:31] how she felt he came out but was it it
[1:01:37] was God putting Abraham in position so
[1:01:44] sometimes at your expense
[1:01:47] at my expense at the pastor's expense
[1:01:50] somebody behind the scenes is being
[1:01:53] blessed somebody's being blessed by the
[1:02:01] cost you might be paid you look it had
[1:02:10] to go down like that because it was
[1:02:12] gonna be a type from Abraham to run out
[1:02:15] through history that there would be two
[1:02:19] seasons i oh yeah there'd be a spiritual
[1:02:21] serum natural seed oh yeah and they'd be
[1:02:24] warring against each other but think
[1:02:26] about what it cost era to let it happen
[1:02:35] look look now you have Rachel you have
[1:02:39] Leah you have the two hands means and it
[1:02:42] looked like it's four women fighting
[1:02:44] over one man but let me ask some who you
[1:02:47] think felt the most hurt out of that
[1:02:50] whole thing I guarantee you one Jacob
[1:02:57] you see Rachel hallelujah because it
[1:03:00] wasn't it wasn't Rachel idea that Leah
[1:03:03] kills huh me
[1:03:04] leah was a wife now Rachel couldn't stop
[1:03:06] that huh so here comes Leo huh
[1:03:10] Rachel keeps humming hallelujah she has
[1:03:13] children so real say you know what you
[1:03:14] ain't gonna outdo me earlier I'm gonna
[1:03:17] give my honey now everybody's having
[1:03:19] children but Rachel look at what it
[1:03:24] costs her
[1:03:25] so that a husband may get in position
[1:03:32] but all of that was the plan of God God
[1:03:39] allows suffering so that someone may be
[1:03:43] blessed Church I'm speaking from
[1:03:50] experience and aggression the grace of
[1:03:56] God honey you know what my whole my
[1:04:00] whole thing is now church I want to be
[1:04:03] built in such a way so that the words of
[1:04:06] Paul when he says hooyah he joy count it
[1:04:12] all joy in the thing she saw earlier
[1:04:15] that day he says if he glory in anything
[1:04:19] let it be in the things he suffered he
[1:04:25] look at he is rejoicing in what it cost
[1:04:30] him huh Paul was a man no doubt hariya
[1:04:34] could've had children couldn't have a
[1:04:36] wife but he forsook all for the gospel
[1:04:40] can you imagine Paul going out to
[1:04:43] witness and Families coming up to him
[1:04:45] tell him Paul we appreciate your
[1:04:47] ministry the children of the Brotherhood
[1:04:49] you probably look at some of those kids
[1:04:51] and had these old feelings and probably
[1:04:53] said I wish I had a family but that was
[1:04:58] his cost for the gospel buddies what are
[1:05:07] you saying I'm saying in moments like
[1:05:11] these let's not be fear for us and it's
[1:05:16] just God God is the great harlot God is
[1:05:19] the greatest chess player ever oh yeah
[1:05:24] and let's let's understand this one
[1:05:26] thing honey it's the devil on one side
[1:05:30] and gods on the other side you know his
[1:05:32] chips are all his horses are white huh
[1:05:36] well I want you to understand his
[1:05:38] God on his side Satan on his side
[1:05:41] God is never playing defense he's never
[1:05:50] playing defense because he's the author
[1:05:54] and creator of life every position and
[1:05:58] you achieve God already nobody it's the
[1:06:00] devil playing defense because it's the
[1:06:02] enemy tried to stop God's plan and like
[1:06:08] I say like this the enemy is a part of
[1:06:11] God's plan his whole life doesn't belong
[1:06:18] to him Church let's look at the cost a
[1:06:26] little bit more not not now we step up
[1:06:30] earlier and we look at oh yeah
[1:06:33] let's just say uh-uh we look in the
[1:06:37] scriptures and we look at the children
[1:06:38] and let's let's back up to Jacob and
[1:06:41] Esau and you'll get Isaac twice earlier
[1:06:44] oh yeah you look at her and Isaac begin
[1:06:49] to pray Lord let my wife have some kids
[1:06:53] she's not she's not she don't feel
[1:06:56] complete let my wife has never better
[1:06:58] please Lord then I have some kids so you
[1:07:02] know what because of his prayer Rebecca
[1:07:06] gets pregnant honey honey but go back
[1:07:09] and read it
[1:07:10] her pregnancy is not a normal pregnancy
[1:07:16] she starts to question God why do I feel
[1:07:19] like this what's going on inside of me
[1:07:22] and God comes back and tell her there's
[1:07:24] a war going on inside of you honey your
[1:07:28] husband acts that you get pregnant but
[1:07:30] he didn't know the cost he didn't know
[1:07:35] there were gonna be two nations inside
[1:07:37] of you and they were gonna fight in the
[1:07:40] womb to the time therefore they didn't
[1:07:46] understand the cost honey
[1:07:48] but even after they're born honey Jacob
[1:07:51] comes out grab
[1:07:52] he loved he saw somebody had to pay the
[1:07:57] price but look huh if we if we go all
[1:08:03] the way into the life of Jacob Padilla
[1:08:06] and God positionally placed him little
[1:08:08] church what did it cost take him to get
[1:08:10] your birthright you might say well he he
[1:08:15] you know he has a paper right birth
[1:08:17] right here favor with God let's let's
[1:08:19] drop down to the just to the human real
[1:08:22] church do you know holy following God
[1:08:24] and having and getting that birthright
[1:08:28] it cost him his family how many y'all
[1:08:33] got siblings that you love and you grew
[1:08:35] up with and you became tight Jacob
[1:08:39] didn't get that chance Esau became his
[1:08:43] enemy his blood brother whom he probably
[1:08:46] loved he became enemies why for the cost
[1:08:51] of being positionally price and you'll
[1:08:58] understand he saw you understand oh yeah
[1:09:02] it even got by isaac the cost of
[1:09:09] tricking his dad the cost of tricking
[1:09:13] his brother earlier cost him his family
[1:09:16] cost him his childhood he had to grow up
[1:09:19] fast
[1:09:23] church so don't give me that I don't
[1:09:26] know what I'm gonna do to my heart my
[1:09:28] job is my job you don't know what God is
[1:09:30] about to do in your life maybe he's
[1:09:34] putting you in position
[1:09:35] huh no Church hey you know me and my
[1:09:38] brothers we grew up together earlier and
[1:09:40] by the grace of God I'm the youngest of
[1:09:43] four so it didn't cost me any of those
[1:09:47] relationships when I came into the
[1:09:49] ministry because they were already older
[1:09:51] than me huh oh yeah but can you imagine
[1:09:53] if we twins huh if we twist you door and
[1:09:58] say some twins can finish each other's
[1:10:00] sentences let's just say that I was
[1:10:02] Jacob and Esau
[1:10:05] and now God is positionally placing her
[1:10:08] these two boys he's gonna let East I'll
[1:10:11] go out this day and not be able to
[1:10:13] finally food and Jekyll's in the kitchen
[1:10:16] Harley cooking up something and now he's
[1:10:18] being motivated huh he'd been motivated
[1:10:21] by any so suffering but it was gone but
[1:10:31] look at what it cost him it cost him the
[1:10:37] fellowship with his family it cost him a
[1:10:42] real brother just to get in position but
[1:10:50] was it God so let me listen to like I
[1:10:56] say I want a strip covert like G from
[1:10:58] all this power now the question would
[1:11:01] easy access out selves is do we see God
[1:11:03] in the midst of this ain't worried about
[1:11:08] what Trump saying I ain't worried about
[1:11:09] what seeing in saying I'm worried about
[1:11:12] what God is trying to get out of me just
[1:11:18] I don't know about you but it's it's
[1:11:19] causing me to search myself oh yeah
[1:11:22] because we as the bride are supposed to
[1:11:25] be higher yeah the manifestation of God
[1:11:27] hurry up
[1:11:28] a city set on a hill for this in time
[1:11:31] evangelism what are we doing ain't
[1:11:38] saying be rebellious I'm not saying go
[1:11:42] do the complete opposite of what the
[1:11:44] world is doing no what I'm saying is
[1:11:46] refocus refocus Oh Church I give you I
[1:11:54] give you know only count the cost
[1:11:56] remember remember Abraham's seed it was
[1:12:00] put into bondage a man put into bondage
[1:12:03] over 400 years but somebody has to pay
[1:12:06] the price for their deliverance there
[1:12:11] was a couple people that paid the price
[1:12:13] huh for one honey
[1:12:16] Josephine holy Moses
[1:12:18] mom and daddy they had to pay the price
[1:12:22] why because Pharaoh sit down Cody could
[1:12:25] decree that every young child from to
[1:12:28] another must die male and they got this
[1:12:33] fine handsome two-year-old precious
[1:12:37] Hebrew with something special oh it's
[1:12:41] like the momma saw that at birth but she
[1:12:43] don't know what it is yet so can you
[1:12:45] imagine the cost what it costs her to
[1:12:48] give up her child who she'd already saw
[1:12:51] something supernatural over his life Oh
[1:12:56] God already she gave us something
[1:12:59] supernatural her experience with her
[1:13:02] child and she had to give him up not
[1:13:06] knowing what his future holds and so
[1:13:14] were some of us we had to give up loved
[1:13:18] ones we have to give up children and
[1:13:20] different things so that they could go
[1:13:22] the path that God already planned for
[1:13:24] them and it made her Leah it may look
[1:13:27] like instruction to us
[1:13:29] it may look wrong to us but all it's
[1:13:31] doing we know what it could be doing
[1:13:32] putting you in position they could be
[1:13:38] putting you in position Joseph and they
[1:13:47] had to give up their child sitting on a
[1:13:49] river and they don't know what's going
[1:13:51] to come of him and now you look who else
[1:13:53] had to pay a price Miriam had to pay a
[1:13:56] price honey she couldn't just be just a
[1:13:59] little innocent little girl she had to
[1:14:01] go be a spy can you imagine her free is
[1:14:07] like they're planning they having a good
[1:14:09] time they play pattycake no baby baby no
[1:14:15] no no can you imagine all her friends
[1:14:19] doing it and she and my uncle's hey I
[1:14:22] need you go follow Moses go follow him
[1:14:24] down the river and she has to get in the
[1:14:29] river earlier or on the sides of the
[1:14:31] River or whatever on the banks of the
[1:14:34] river and forget about her childhood
[1:14:36] it'd be a spot for Mama huh and not only
[1:14:41] that church
[1:14:42] she hung had to be willing to go into
[1:14:46] enemy territory
[1:14:47] Oh a little young girl the cost just to
[1:14:58] please her parents and you might not
[1:15:02] want to believe this but some of your
[1:15:05] children are doing things just to please
[1:15:06] you and you don't understand what it's
[1:15:09] costing them estas mother pastor says
[1:15:15] the preacher sailors why don't you take
[1:15:17] this time sit down with them and see
[1:15:19] what they really cuz I had one of my
[1:15:25] kids hallelujah
[1:15:26] tell me how some years ago they were
[1:15:28] doing a certain thing and I said why are
[1:15:30] you doing that and they said well cuz I
[1:15:32] don't want to disrespect you and I'm
[1:15:35] like I appreciate that
[1:15:37] I appreciate you not wanting to
[1:15:39] disrespect me but were you doing is God
[1:15:42] looking at you forget about me and just
[1:15:47] that conversation alone allowing them to
[1:15:50] have their own conviction when it comes
[1:15:51] to God even though I know what they
[1:15:53] doing is wrong
[1:15:54] it made our relationship even that much
[1:15:56] better cuz sometimes that's parents
[1:16:01] let's stop trying to play God and let's
[1:16:04] just be parent huh this would be prayer
[1:16:09] let's stop being God let God be God you
[1:16:12] Delta G 1 of my consolation is if you
[1:16:14] God did this are you with me with my
[1:16:17] oldest Harley he said hey you dedicated
[1:16:20] her to me not take your hands off and
[1:16:25] God is God is faithful God is good at
[1:16:27] church I'm looking I'm looking back on
[1:16:29] it now and like I said honey I've
[1:16:31] learned to appreciate to shut your mouth
[1:16:35] ministry how best ministry ever came in
[1:16:40] contact with its decision my ministry
[1:16:42] some of us need to prank
[1:16:45] that ministry at home hold the job and
[1:16:47] especially in church shadow mouth if you
[1:16:52] don't know what's going on cuz you look
[1:16:54] at something you can say this happening
[1:16:56] that happens but you don't know what is
[1:16:58] costing that person just to go through
[1:17:01] it just to bear with it just to come to
[1:17:04] church and let you look at him with you
[1:17:06] downgrading eyes and I ain't above know
[1:17:14] about this but you know what some of the
[1:17:16] nasties people can be church people so
[1:17:20] the most uncompassionate people can be
[1:17:22] church people especially in this message
[1:17:30] because with knowing truth there is an
[1:17:34] element of pride that comes along and
[1:17:37] you need the Holy Ghost
[1:17:39] to contain it cuz y'all know we didn't
[1:17:44] heard somebody preaching something and
[1:17:51] he don't know what he talking about you
[1:17:53] know what that is do you know what that
[1:17:55] is that's right but it takes the Holy
[1:18:00] Ghost holy for you to see without God
[1:18:04] you'd be in that same position so church
[1:18:11] I try not to judge what's going on in
[1:18:14] somebody else's house whether they
[1:18:16] message believe it or not God is in
[1:18:19] control honey and well it looks like
[1:18:22] something like oh my I can't believe he
[1:18:24] did this
[1:18:25] oh my I can't believe she did that best
[1:18:28] minister in the world is the sex on my
[1:18:30] ministry especially you preaches let me
[1:18:39] lead hello let's look at the cost look
[1:18:44] at what it costs honey I take them just
[1:18:49] to get the birthright to keep the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost it costs him his fellowship with
[1:18:52] his twin
[1:18:55] it cost him hooyah being fully tulitt by
[1:18:59] his daddy church he didn't have the
[1:19:06] chance to be adopted under his father's
[1:19:08] ministry do you realize that you need to
[1:19:15] receive his adoption under his father's
[1:19:18] ministry he received it at Pannell all
[1:19:22] alone here we go he had to wrestle for
[1:19:24] it he had to wrestle for that adoption
[1:19:29] huh
[1:19:30] think about if he would have been home
[1:19:32] earlier as he had people already set up
[1:19:35] for his boys to teach them and show them
[1:19:38] right from wrong huh that say was coming
[1:19:41] to that adoption but he had to leave his
[1:19:45] family running from his life look at the
[1:19:47] cost you know the devil the devil is and
[1:19:58] I look a little fight but I want to say
[1:20:00] this the devil is so dumb he's so dumb
[1:20:04] Church he he allowed this teacher going
[1:20:07] to the masses and he's taking over the
[1:20:11] world you know what it's doing huh he's
[1:20:13] making a bride pull for more of God it's
[1:20:18] making the anointing in our churches
[1:20:20] more pure honey because I guarantee you
[1:20:24] the people that are streaming the people
[1:20:26] that are coming are the people that
[1:20:27] really want to so it's making it more
[1:20:34] let's refocus hey hey if you sit at home
[1:20:43] and you think about going count alone
[1:20:50] don't blame it on me it's a universal
[1:20:55] pool hallelujah it's a pool in the
[1:20:58] fourth dimension
[1:21:01] one of my buddies takes me before
[1:21:03] service say he's gonna be watching he's
[1:21:05] in Louisiana and I guarantee he pulling
[1:21:08] I can feel it bro oh wow let's refocus
[1:21:17] God is placing us oh you look at Jacob
[1:21:21] all the stuff he gave up Church you know
[1:21:24] I love these I love when God give me
[1:21:26] stuff like this progestin because it's
[1:21:29] like brothers Jews saying it takes away
[1:21:32] my wives and wives he will it takes away
[1:21:37] my complaining it takes away my feeling
[1:21:39] sorry for myself
[1:21:41] it takes away all the channel everybody
[1:21:43] else is saying about me just to know
[1:21:45] that God is in control of my life
[1:21:53] Church looking sometimes God is trying
[1:21:57] to place you and you will do things that
[1:22:00] you couldn't imagine you doing but God
[1:22:03] allowing just to get you in position
[1:22:06] just to get you position church you
[1:22:09] couldn't tell me honey Moses got to
[1:22:12] desire hallelujah now he's looking at
[1:22:15] one as people being being beat up in all
[1:22:17] the stuff and he has a desire to see
[1:22:20] hurry the Hebrews go free but look at
[1:22:23] what it cost him because he would've
[1:22:25] been pop somebody's neck he didn't visit
[1:22:30] himself doing it but God allowed him to
[1:22:34] get in that position earlier why because
[1:22:37] he had to go in the desert where
[1:22:38] Jethro's that and the only place he
[1:22:41] could get there is if he has a
[1:22:42] reputation of a murderer look at what it
[1:22:46] costs him to build an era before he was
[1:22:51] literal he had the testimony of a
[1:22:53] murderer but why was he grabbed he
[1:23:05] grabbed Egyptian pull some is something
[1:23:07] pop-pop
[1:23:12] and word gets out Moses didn't kill
[1:23:14] somebody who was once the Great Prince
[1:23:17] now he's a murderer he was next in line
[1:23:19] to be on the throne now he's a murderer
[1:23:21] now he has to run from his life run for
[1:23:24] his life what was it that was God's plan
[1:23:27] y-you said birdies how was that God
[1:23:30] playing because before the foundation of
[1:23:32] the world God had a bush on the backside
[1:23:35] of desert that he had already tested
[1:23:37] they could he could speak out of it he
[1:23:44] had a bush already in place all he
[1:23:47] needed was Moses to be in position oh
[1:23:51] yeah okay what it cost him because Moses
[1:24:00] Moses being delivered it costs him
[1:24:04] hallelujah
[1:24:05] it's real identity he grew up on the lie
[1:24:10] lie with me church he grew up huh
[1:24:13] nothing I want a woman as his mother who
[1:24:16] really wasn't his mother huh he grew up
[1:24:21] not knowing his father like a son would
[1:24:24] he grew up not knowing his natural
[1:24:27] siblings that's what it costs him to be
[1:24:32] put in position what do you think God is
[1:24:38] doing Church I'm rejoicing because what
[1:24:44] gives me strength brother Jason is death
[1:24:46] you can go through things that it seemed
[1:24:49] like it would break you apart and
[1:24:50] strength comes from somewhere to keep
[1:24:53] serving him another day huh the average
[1:24:58] person with a bit of quit and made every
[1:25:00] excuse to go live some old crazy kind of
[1:25:03] life but God has put stabilizing power
[1:25:06] inside of you that is a mist of every
[1:25:10] suffering every trial used to remain
[1:25:12] strong listen hey bud all right I know I
[1:25:21] need
[1:25:23] I need to wrap this up Holly if y'all
[1:25:27] don't mind let me read something the
[1:25:33] church Facebook listen this is a message
[1:25:37] this morning turkeys listen he says now
[1:25:42] the Lord God Almighty since I know just
[1:25:47] we are to live by that God is already
[1:25:50] saying I know nothing is catching him by
[1:25:53] surprise I know in 2020 hallelujah April
[1:25:58] of 2020 God still remains to say I know
[1:26:04] will you need a job God says I know you
[1:26:08] need food of your house I know the Holy
[1:26:11] Ghost I know using your body I know
[1:26:15] whatever it is God is already proclaim
[1:26:18] over two thousand years ago that he is
[1:26:22] hung up Nishat he says I know that there
[1:26:32] he is walking in the midst of his people
[1:26:35] there he is the chief Shepherd of the
[1:26:38] flock but does he hold back the
[1:26:41] persecution does he steam the trip to
[1:26:46] the tribulation no he does not he simply
[1:26:51] says I know your tribulation I am NOT
[1:26:54] holy at all holy unmindful of your
[1:26:58] suffering what is holy he says I'm not
[1:27:02] at all unmindful of your suffering
[1:27:05] these are prophecies what a stumbling
[1:27:07] block hallelujah keep this so many
[1:27:10] people
[1:27:11] he says suffering is a stumbling block
[1:27:15] to the believer because we think we
[1:27:20] supposed to go to nothing
[1:27:22] let's narrow it down to Abraham go
[1:27:25] through something amen
[1:27:39] hey Rebecca anyway he says what a
[1:27:53] stumbling-block Holly this is to so many
[1:27:56] people he said like Israel they wasn't
[1:27:58] if God really loves them how can God be
[1:28:01] just as loving if he stands by and
[1:28:04] watches his people suffer you know why
[1:28:07] cuz he's put you in position God allows
[1:28:16] it because he knows that suffering is
[1:28:18] going to put you in position G that is
[1:28:24] what they ask
[1:28:25] in Malachi 1 1 & 3 he says the burden of
[1:28:28] the word of the Lord to Israel by
[1:28:30] Malachi I have loved you said the Lord
[1:28:33] yet we say wearing has now left us was
[1:28:37] not Esau Jacob's brother said the Lord
[1:28:42] yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and
[1:28:46] ladies Mountains and his heritage waste
[1:28:49] to the dragons of the wilderness you see
[1:28:52] is that you see they could not figure
[1:28:55] how God's love see Church how does God
[1:29:00] shows his love by just as much by agony
[1:29:06] by pain the prophet of God say you wanna
[1:29:09] love you worthy
[1:29:10] he said it's when God sees you through a
[1:29:12] trial anybody going through something we
[1:29:20] ought to be giving our praise listen he
[1:29:31] says I thought that love meant no
[1:29:34] suffering they thought they loved made a
[1:29:37] baby with parental care but God says
[1:29:40] that his love was effective elective
[1:29:42] love the proof of his love is
[1:29:45] election that no matter what happened
[1:29:48] his love was proven highly truly by the
[1:29:52] fact they were chosen unto salvation
[1:29:54] because God have chosen you hurry to
[1:29:58] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:30:00] Spirit hungry belief of truth now listen
[1:30:04] he says he may commit you to death as he
[1:30:07] did all that was God's love oh and did
[1:30:15] he not put Paul in position to suffering
[1:30:19] so he's suffering I want you to catch
[1:30:22] this what the enemy thought he was
[1:30:24] getting on God was really God putting a
[1:30:26] weapon in Paul's hand he says he may
[1:30:33] commit you to suffering as he did told
[1:30:35] Jobe loved his children always always
[1:30:38] always
[1:30:39] he says this is his way people looked at
[1:30:43] him is his status he lost his family he
[1:30:46] lost his wife he lost everything but was
[1:30:49] not God with him in the thing about Joe
[1:30:55] what we have to realize is sometimes God
[1:30:59] will never tell you why you went through
[1:31:01] what you went through he never came back
[1:31:06] to job as a job you know what this
[1:31:08] happened because the devil tested me he
[1:31:14] just restored him with that whole part
[1:31:17] of his life just being a question mom
[1:31:21] but really it was asset because God came
[1:31:24] back and begin to replenish so Joe
[1:31:26] should've knew the question mark was God
[1:31:28] was in control huh
[1:31:32] he said that is his prerogative he is
[1:31:35] sovereign but it holier he said but it
[1:31:38] is with a purpose purpose like Esther's
[1:31:41] church he said if he did not have a
[1:31:44] purpose seeing he would be the author of
[1:31:47] frustrations and not a peace so if you
[1:31:52] going through something and it's
[1:31:53] aggravating is trying trust me
[1:31:55] God has to have a purpose
[1:31:57] because if he didn't have a purpose the
[1:32:00] public I say he'd be the author
[1:32:01] frustration and not of peace and the
[1:32:04] Bible says that he's not that all he's
[1:32:06] not no other frustration he says his
[1:32:13] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:32:16] while we will be made perfect holier be
[1:32:20] established strengthening settled as
[1:32:23] Joel said he pushed treating us so what
[1:32:27] is this all about God positions us so
[1:32:30] that we may walk before him perfect
[1:32:33] remember he told Abraham before he went
[1:32:36] to eat easy walk before me and be thou
[1:32:39] perfect hull so like being there was
[1:32:42] God's perfection holy him goes out there
[1:32:45] fighting the three kings was God's
[1:32:47] perfection holy king I almost taken his
[1:32:53] wife was God's perfection every child he
[1:32:59] was walking before God and be made
[1:33:01] perfect Jace rotates forgive me they got
[1:33:11] a whole world song when I was coming I
[1:33:13] used to say you made me feel like this
[1:33:16] feel like dancing that's what the Word
[1:33:22] of God does for me church I hope you
[1:33:28] catching it wholly refocus we all like
[1:33:33] to be things me whirring hold on
[1:33:35] we can't go out I can't go to wall my
[1:33:37] like I won't do it I can't do it I can't
[1:33:39] go to work if I had a full-time job and
[1:33:42] they told me stay home you still keep
[1:33:44] your child and we gonna pay you you
[1:33:53] think I'll be worried I'll be there
[1:33:54] praise God you know what I said when I
[1:33:56] heard top saying we will sit on some
[1:33:58] kings as they thanked God for Trump
[1:34:01] first time those words I became my mama
[1:34:08] so I take that real quick thank God for
[1:34:10] that man no he don't I couldn't read all
[1:34:21] this brother I'm here the clothes he
[1:34:26] says the purpose is after a while your
[1:34:28] stuff in a while then he will make you
[1:34:30] perfect be established strengthen itself
[1:34:32] as he did Joe listen y'all go back and
[1:34:36] read that cuz that's a powerful from 17
[1:34:39] to 18 that's powerful that whole thing
[1:34:42] in there but I want to get to this and
[1:34:44] I'm a close by God's grace church let's
[1:34:48] realize this for us to be here soundly
[1:34:54] still living you know there's people all
[1:34:57] over the world have turned their back on
[1:34:58] this truth what is it that's keeping us
[1:35:02] because we have to go through the
[1:35:05] persecution they call us a cult they
[1:35:08] call us just a car that you know and we
[1:35:11] have to go through that persecute they
[1:35:12] got us online all this other stuff
[1:35:14] and as soon as somebody who was in your
[1:35:16] church something happens it's blast out
[1:35:19] all over the place
[1:35:19] then go tell the good that's going on
[1:35:23] then go tell her brother Jason supports

[1:37:25] respected and now her Lea he he has a
[1:37:29] word from God to go down a word from God

[1:37:51] know the story he says what the
[1:37:54] mother-in-law saw to be trashed was
[1:37:56] really the cream of the crop he say hope
[1:38:01] she went but she really didn't want to

[1:38:07] there and he was stuck in between going
[1:38:10] and his wife and loving her and
[1:38:12] everything and then he goes on down you

[1:38:18] after that once he was gone so he was
[1:38:25] being sweet earlier off the path of
[1:38:28] perfection he took all those things out

[1:44:58] but yet I have a thousand words I want
[1:45:01] to say my goodness
[1:45:05] I'm just looking back over everything
[1:45:08] the brother said and my notes as he went
[1:45:11] along I just feel like I need to go
[1:45:14] somewhere in the world and preach that
[1:45:16] sermon amen you know you know something
[1:45:20] brother Diggs when you that last point
[1:45:23] you made there
[1:45:24] what is our attitude towards God while
[1:45:28] he's making you perfect you know I was
[1:45:33] thinking about where you was talking
[1:45:34] about there in Genesis 17 where he had
[1:45:37] said to Abraham walk before me and be
[1:45:40] thou perfect I went and grabbed it and
[1:45:44] pasted it into my notes when Abraham was
[1:45:47] ninety years old and nine the Lord
[1:45:49] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:45:53] the Almighty God walk before me and be
[1:45:56] thou perfect now he's only Abram here
[1:45:59] he's not even had the H added to be
[1:46:01] Abraham that's going to come because H
[1:46:04] means deity God's gonna add deity into
[1:46:06] his name and bring him to something but
[1:46:08] that was never gonna happen unless
[1:46:10] Abraham agreed to this covenant right
[1:46:12] here and the Bible says in verse three
[1:46:16] Abram fell on his face he humbled
[1:46:20] himself to that but what struck me is
[1:46:22] that Abraham fell on his face and he
[1:46:27] humbled himself and he had no idea what
[1:46:32] all he would have to face and endure to
[1:46:35] be all that God already said he made him
[1:46:39] for me
[1:46:39] God said in the fifth verse he says you
[1:46:43] know neither shall thy name be any more
[1:46:46] Abram because now he's humbled himself
[1:46:49] he said but you should be called Abraham
[1:46:51] for a father of many nations have I made
[1:46:53] thee God had already made him I already
[1:46:55] had all of that everything out there in
[1:46:58] front of him Abraham didn't have a clue
[1:46:59] he didn't have a clue what that meant to
[1:47:03] be perfected because remember what
[1:47:05] brother Diggs read out there judge book
[1:47:06] that you're perfected through your
[1:47:09] sufferings and so God just comes down
[1:47:11] and says here's his promise I'll
[1:47:13] multiply the exam for him amen my
[1:47:19] covenant is with thee amen
[1:47:21] you should to be a father of many
[1:47:23] nations and here Abraham is agreeing and
[1:47:25] humbly and he and walk before me and be
[1:47:28] thou perfect and Abraham's might be
[1:47:30] thinking well I'll try to be good no it
[1:47:33] was going to be way more than that and
[1:47:36] wasn't gonna be about being a good boy
[1:47:39] are you gonna walk before me Abraham I'm
[1:47:42] prophesying to you I'm not really asking
[1:47:45] you a question Abraham I already made
[1:47:47] you a father of many nations I already
[1:47:49] done this the backside of this already
[1:47:50] finished amen
[1:47:53] I just need you to cooperate in the
[1:47:57] vision Abraham a vision and go ahead and
[1:48:00] and admit it and fall on your face and
[1:48:02] humbler now I'm going to add H to your
[1:48:04] name I'm gonna put DeeDee inside you and
[1:48:06] I'm gonna make you everything that I
[1:48:09] already determined you're gonna beat Wow
[1:48:11] Wow you know some friends man I feel
[1:48:16] like preaching Wow brother Diggs oh my
[1:48:20] goodness I'm gonna tell you something
[1:48:21] friends now this is a straight-up fact
[1:48:22] there's the straight truth there's no
[1:48:24] way a man can preach something like that
[1:48:26] who ain't had to walk some path of
[1:48:29] hardship and trials that brother Diggs
[1:48:32] has went through I was telling some
[1:48:34] ministers the other day but they come up
[1:48:35] conversation I said brother Diggs ain't
[1:48:37] even same man since all these trolleys
[1:48:39] been through ain't even the same
[1:48:40] ministry he still brother Diggs
[1:48:42] he's still gonna be up he gonna be a
[1:48:44] nervous breakdown for the devil and
[1:48:46] brother Diggs is still gonna walk the
[1:48:47] aisles and still gonna sniff out but I'm
[1:48:49] gonna tell you brother Diggs has hit a
[1:48:51] whole new level
[1:48:51] because of the suffering now I guarantee
[1:48:54] if you'd asked him years ago you willing
[1:48:57] to go through this brother digs mite had
[1:48:58] to say hold on now what what all is this
[1:49:00] I wanted to face but I'm gonna tell you
[1:49:03] because the brother stood faithful and
[1:49:05] has come out the other side of all of
[1:49:07] that trials faithfully he can stand here
[1:49:10] today I'm gonna tell you you can take
[1:49:11] this sermon and go home with it because
[1:49:13] the man that was preaching it wasn't
[1:49:15] preaching something just off of theology
[1:49:18] man was preaching something he's lived
[1:49:20] and he's seen God keep his word amen how
[1:49:23] many witnessed that Amen we've been
[1:49:26] hearing brother Diggs you know even
[1:49:28] before and then during and then after
[1:49:31] and just praying for him all the way
[1:49:32] along you don't go through something
[1:49:34] like that and come out you know it
[1:49:36] without in victory without going through
[1:49:39] some things and then when you do and you
[1:49:41] endure and you keep going and you come
[1:49:43] out I'm gonna tell you you become
[1:49:45] something altogether brand new you
[1:49:47] become a tool in the hands of God amen

[1:50:15] Jacob to become everything the word had

[1:50:23] suffering to allow our husband the word
[1:50:26] Christ to be seated on the throne to be
