[11:45] it's Old-Timers set ninja sorry about
[11:47] that
[11:49] amen praise the Lord amen any other
[11:52] visitors here today we've got a lot of
[11:54] families traveling
[11:56] um several probably four or five
[11:57] families out traveling and I just want
[12:00] to say today that this is kind of an
[12:03] unusual
[12:04] Christmas Sunday Christmas Sundays are
[12:07] unusual we've only in 28 years I think
[12:10] this would be our fourth one maybe you
[12:11] seemed like we had one right on the
[12:13] first year so this might be our fifth
[12:14] one but
[12:16] um
[12:17] because
[12:19] that families travel at Christmas but
[12:22] then also visitors
[12:25] come to visit all of us who are here and
[12:27] we have here's an example of it today we
[12:29] have visitors and for that reason I very
[12:32] intentionally always make sure I'm
[12:34] speaking and I never give up I've never
[12:38] given up my Sunday Christmas service
[12:41] ever uh and that's and that's on purpose
[12:44] and but we have a very unusual one today
[12:48] because the Lord
[12:49] prompted me strongly to ask our dear
[12:54] friend and family member brother Burley
[12:56] to speak for us today so I am looking
[12:59] forward eagerly to the content of what
[13:02] will come across this desk today I want
[13:04] you to open your hearts and Minds
[13:06] because I didn't expect to do it I had a
[13:09] sermon I lined up wanted to preach it
[13:12] bad
[13:14] and uh amen we've got visitors here
[13:17] today so I know it's probably a shock to
[13:20] our visitors that I'm not going to be
[13:21] speaking but neither is brother Burley
[13:23] the Lord is going to be speaking amen so
[13:26] you just take it from me if you have
[13:28] confidence in brother Jason I felt
[13:30] directly directly very unusually so
[13:34] directly prompted to have brother Burley
[13:37] he tried to get out of it and he tried
[13:38] every way to get out of it but I said
[13:40] brother Burley it's it's the will of the
[13:42] Lord I know it as good as anything happy
[13:44] to have Niecy here in the family amen
[13:46] God bless you all amen you got a song
[13:49] you want to sing
[13:51] how
[13:53] I love you
[13:56] Jesus
[13:58] [Music]
[14:19] because
[14:21] he first
[14:24] love me

[14:33] How I Love
[14:36] Jesus

[15:10] hearts

[15:22] and that's always our hearts desire
[15:25] Lord that you could just use the gift
[15:27] that you placed in Upon Our Lives
[15:30] to be used for your glory to feed your
[15:33] people
[15:35] see that your people who will be drawn
[15:37] closer into you
[15:38] father has always and always will be our
[15:42] desire so we come to hear from you this
[15:45] morning oh God we didn't come to hear
[15:47] from a man
[15:48] but Lord we all privileged people to be
[15:51] able to assemble here this morning
[15:52] around the words of life around the
[15:55] revealed word of the hour oh God that
[15:57] have you have sunk to us
[16:00] so that everything could be made clear

[17:08] First Corinthians chapter 15.
[17:14] I I've been
[17:17] studying something in the last three
[17:19] days oh
[17:21] unusual a little strange but
[17:25] couldn't seem to get away from it but
[17:27] we'll just see what the Lord will do
[17:30] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 31 he
[17:33] said I protest
[17:35] by rejoicing which I have in Christ
[17:37] Jesus our lord I Die daily amen you may
[17:41] be seated
[17:45] and also like to turn to First Samuel
[17:47] chapter 8.
[17:49] once again appreciate brother Jason for
[17:51] having us and uh
[17:55] pray that the Lord will bless you in
[17:56] this word this morning
[17:59] First Corinthians chapter I mean first
[18:01] Samuel chapter eight
[18:06] I would like to say um
[18:11] as we go into the scripture just the
[18:14] last few months of many things done took
[18:16] place
[18:17] I don't see in God do some wonderful
[18:19] things in my life we've been through a
[18:22] lot of uh trials and hard trials but you
[18:27] know one thing about trials if you deal
[18:29] with it correctly they only strengthen
[18:31] you
[18:32] they don't break you they only
[18:34] strengthen you
[18:35] so we thank God for that and I would
[18:38] just give a I'm just going to give a
[18:40] little
[18:41] just a little quick testimony try to
[18:44] blend it in with my service here amen uh
[18:48] August 3rd I had a accident pretty bad
[18:52] accident happened to my eye
[18:55] and uh and and and who was on the job
[18:58] working
[19:00] anybody here in construction you know
[19:02] sometimes you can get into a hurry
[19:03] sometimes and don't put your safety
[19:06] glasses on and just think that you're a
[19:08] Superman or something and just go
[19:10] but you know it was an unusual day
[19:13] I actually had a sermon it was a
[19:16] Wednesday I had a sermon on my heart
[19:18] and I was going to preach on eyes
[19:21] and it was just burning me up and I
[19:23] wanted to preach on my eyes
[19:25] I actually had started preaching in that
[19:27] on the weekend at Mike Wall's church but
[19:30] when I got that home that Wednesday I
[19:33] just wanted to preach on eyes
[19:34] and then I was the granite guys was
[19:37] coming I had to shoot some quarter
[19:39] around down but this particular quarter
[19:42] round was Walnut so it's hard and uh
[19:45] when I shot I shot the gun a couple
[19:48] times Nails kind of flew
[19:51] I just keep going
[19:53] God was giving me my warning then I
[19:55] believe but I just kept going
[19:57] but then all of a sudden
[19:59] I shot and Bam hit me right in the eye
[20:02] it literally felt like somebody drew
[20:05] their hand back far as they can get it
[20:06] and just punched me
[20:08] and so I failed when I was already down
[20:11] and uh so the guy that was working with
[20:13] me he said you're all right I said I
[20:15] think so
[20:16] until I got up when I got up and when I
[20:19] opened my eye the nail was still in
[20:22] there and I told him I said man I said I
[20:25] think he's still in there I said can you
[20:26] pull it out for me
[20:27] and he came up to me he said let me see
[20:30] it and I showed it to him he said nah I
[20:33] don't think I'm gonna pull that out
[20:35] I said wow I said so what I did I took a
[20:38] selfie
[20:40] because I actually wanted to see where
[20:42] the nail was I was gonna pull it out
[20:43] myself
[20:45] so when I took a selfie and I looked at
[20:47] the picture and I seen the nail
[20:49] I said no I'm not gonna pull that out so
[20:51] that's when I called 9-1-1
[20:54] and uh when the paramedics come and get
[20:57] me
[20:57] uh they looked at it and they said
[21:00] you're a pretty tough fella because I
[21:02] wasn't panicking
[21:04] screaming or nothing
[21:05] I said well yeah I said well okay when
[21:09] they carried me to the doctor when I got
[21:12] into it the paramedics got me there uh
[21:15] you know
[21:16] I knew I knew it was a reason for
[21:19] everything
[21:20] but when I was in there the doctor came
[21:22] down and people would cut the paramedic
[21:25] they put I could put a cup over my eye
[21:27] and taped it up so that I couldn't hit
[21:29] it
[21:30] so the doctor come in there and said let
[21:31] me take this off and he took it off and
[21:33] he looked in there and he said oh you
[21:37] know when people start going oh oh
[21:40] my God if you ain't careful you listen
[21:42] to that it just pulls you down
[21:45] so uh and then out of all the things the
[21:48] doctor can say he said yo I look bad
[21:51] he said I just removed the man uh he's I
[21:55] just come from removing a man's eye and
[21:58] I'm like really
[22:00] really you're gonna say something like
[22:03] that but anyway I just stayed there and
[22:06] then because on the way to the hospital
[22:09] I was actually talking to the paramedics
[22:12] about I was going to preach on eyes so
[22:14] evidently they told the doctor
[22:17] so when they told the doctor he said I
[22:19] don't understand
[22:20] you're a preacher no no let me back back
[22:23] so I asked the doctor I said
[22:26] what I said can we get this over with I
[22:29] said how long this is going to take
[22:31] he said well you got somewhere to go
[22:33] I said actually I do got somewhere to go
[22:35] I said I want to preach tonight
[22:37] he said well I don't I don't think
[22:39] you're going to be able to do that
[22:41] he said I understood you was talking
[22:43] about eyes
[22:45] I said yeah yeah I was going to preach
[22:47] on my eyes tonight I said that's what I
[22:49] was going to preach on and he said well
[22:52] you can preach to me
[22:56] he probably shouldn't have said that
[23:01] because
[23:02] this is what I want to say
[23:06] God
[23:08] speaks to you
[23:10] in different things in your life
[23:12] something that you can relate to
[23:16] he used your surround he used
[23:17] surroundings things you familiar with he
[23:20] used those things to get your attention
[23:24] so this is how this message came up with
[23:26] eyes
[23:28] so I began to talk to the doctor I said
[23:31] I'm telling him what I'm telling you I
[23:33] said God speaks I said sir he speaks to
[23:36] you you're a doctor I said God could use
[23:38] medical terms to catch your attention he
[23:41] said true true I said he used carpentry
[23:45] terms he can speak to me do carpentry
[23:47] terms he said okay I said well let me
[23:50] give you an example how God works
[23:52] if you know Peter in the Bible was an
[23:56] expert fisherman
[23:58] and I said then one night they toilet
[24:00] all night they didn't catch nothing and
[24:03] I said Jesus told them to cast their net
[24:06] to the right I said now Jesus was doing
[24:09] something to catch Peter's attention
[24:12] I said now Peter could have said who
[24:15] does this man think he is I'm an expert
[24:18] fisherman he's not a fisherman and he
[24:20] gonna tell me to cast The Net to the
[24:22] right which I know ain't nothing there
[24:26] but that ain't what Jesus was doing he
[24:28] was using that because he wanted to
[24:31] catch Peter's attention
[24:33] and then Peter said nevertheless at Thy
[24:35] word and when you wrote a story and
[24:37] Peter did it and they come out with
[24:39] abundance of fish I said so Jesus used
[24:42] that sir to catch Peter's attention I
[24:45] said the same thing with Jonah the
[24:47] people in that time they worship a fish
[24:49] God I said so God used prepared a
[24:52] special fish to let Jonah I said what
[24:54] more would make the people more eager to
[24:57] listen see in their so-called God spit a
[25:00] man out and they're going to say wow
[25:02] this have to be of God our God sinning
[25:05] is a man I said no the real God was
[25:07] sending them a man but he used something
[25:09] they could relate to and the doctor said
[25:12] that is that's that's good that's good I
[25:15] said so God speaks to us through
[25:17] terminology so we can understand him and
[25:21] then he said and I said now sir I said
[25:23] but what I was going to preach on is
[25:25] Revelation chapter 3. I said dealing
[25:27] with the Revel uh the layout of the sea
[25:29] in church age he said well we're
[25:32] actually studying that now amongst the
[25:34] doctors I said okay I said well I said
[25:37] do you understand that we're in an age
[25:39] are called laodicea he said okay I said
[25:42] we're in this age it's allowed to see an
[25:44] age I said but if you listen to the
[25:46] scriptures what God was saying he's
[25:49] talking about delay of the sins and so
[25:51] forth that he wanted to anoint their
[25:53] eyes with Isaiah he said right now
[25:56] that's what I was going to preach on I
[25:58] sound what sparked my attention in the
[26:01] church aid book brother Branham talked
[26:03] about laodicea how advanced they were in
[26:06] medical and he said the great medical
[26:09] institutions and so forth so that would
[26:11] sparked me to go study it I went and
[26:14] looked up the history of laodicea and
[26:16] can and then I come to find out one
[26:19] medical thing that they advanced in it
[26:22] was ourselves and people would travel
[26:25] they say in history people would come
[26:28] from all sorts of parts of the world
[26:30] they said it was like Miracles how they
[26:33] would do things miraculously when people
[26:35] would come there they would use this
[26:37] Asaf and they were opening people's eyes
[26:39] and people could see I said so sir God
[26:43] told them I want to know your eye what I
[26:46] said I said so God used something in
[26:48] that age they was familiar with I said
[26:51] but he was letting them know you can
[26:52] open the eyes on people in medical terms
[26:55] but you know what your situation is you
[26:58] need some eye sound from me to open your
[27:01] spiritual eyes wow and I said so doctor
[27:04] so I said the age that we're living in
[27:07] there's no science there's no medicine
[27:09] there's nothing can open your spiritual
[27:11] eyes like the word of God and I said not
[27:14] even the things that you can do you
[27:16] adopted I said still spiritually you can
[27:18] help me physically but you cannot do
[27:20] what our Lord can do what he's offering
[27:22] to this age
[27:24] I said he has given us a word in this
[27:26] age so our eyes could be open so that we
[27:28] can see him and I said sir and I believe
[27:30] with all of my heart right now God
[27:32] allowed this to happen to me just to
[27:34] preach to you goodness and he said you
[27:36] are he said I think you are right
[27:39] so I sat down on a recovery I mean
[27:43] operating get ready to send me into the
[27:45] operating room preaching the gospel so
[27:48] that gave me peace yeah that this is for
[27:52] a purpose this is for a reason amen and
[27:54] then I remember the prophet I was
[27:56] listening to him this morning brother by
[27:57] him said that's one thing the devil I
[28:00] want to do he want to put out your right
[28:02] eye he said because that's your
[28:04] spiritual eye but he hit me in my left
[28:06] eye so I still had my right eye all
[28:09] right so the devil lost all right I won
[28:13] he lost so the devil actually tried to
[28:17] because uh I went completely blind uh
[28:20] the next day I could not see I was just
[28:22] completely blind some from just a month
[28:25] ago I wasn't able to see out of my left
[28:28] eye at all until I had surgery because a
[28:30] cataract had grown over and I read
[28:32] everything the prophet said about
[28:34] cataracts he said it comes from a bruise
[28:36] I said yeah I got a bruise and a
[28:38] cataract grew over it and then the devil
[28:40] tried to get me to accept he said well
[28:43] at least you can see with one eye once
[28:45] you be happy with that I said Satan
[28:47] that's a lie I'm gonna get both of them
[28:48] back all right that's it because they
[28:50] belong to me so and all of those things
[28:53] what happened to me it actually brought
[28:56] me closer to the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:59] I'm so thankful I I uh uh the calls that
[29:04] I got the messages that I got I didn't
[29:06] realize a lot of people know me I really
[29:08] didn't and I just thought my phone going
[29:10] crazy and it humbled me like it really
[29:13] humbled me people say we're praying for
[29:15] you praying for you and and I really
[29:17] appreciate that and you know we had
[29:20] surgery I guess it was a month ago
[29:23] and when I come out of the surgery that
[29:25] even the eye doctor told me he said I
[29:27] was expecting the worst for you he said
[29:29] but God hand is upon you but I do know
[29:33] it was nothing but the prayer of the
[29:35] saints that allowed me to be able to go
[29:38] through what I went through and then on
[29:40] the top of all of that I had surgery in
[29:44] my mouth two weeks after the eye surgery
[29:46] I got eight implants put in my mouth and
[29:49] it was just been a dramatic situation
[29:51] but I've been drawn closer to God in all
[29:54] of it because you know even it was rough
[29:58] I taught my own church
[30:00] and you know sometimes uh people can
[30:04] talk to you and and don't help you
[30:08] it was right in the church don't help
[30:10] you when you're going through something
[30:13] somebody go
[30:17] that don't help
[30:20] that don't help
[30:22] I told my church don't don't be old poor
[30:25] poor brother birdless don't do me like
[30:27] that
[30:28] I don't like doing that I see it's the
[30:30] same thing dealing with a child if you
[30:32] get another child if that child was to
[30:34] fall if you wasn't to go oh oh no
[30:37] they're gonna stop pause look at you
[30:40] then they'll cry
[30:42] you helped him cry yeah but if that
[30:45] child was to fall you could get up champ
[30:48] you talk he'll just brush it off yeah
[30:51] you know yeah yeah they're brushing off
[30:53] so it's the same thing when it comes to
[30:56] a Christian Life sometimes we feel so
[30:58] sorry for one another till we weaken one
[31:00] another fate
[31:02] we must encourage one another not weaken
[31:06] one another encourage one another say
[31:08] brother I'm praying for you not only I'm
[31:10] praying for you I'm praying with you
[31:12] amen that's strengthening one another
[31:15] can we say praise the Lord
[31:18] so in all of these things uh I begin to
[31:21] learn to Die daily and God has really
[31:24] blessed me and he has really helped me
[31:27] but I want to just preach something and
[31:30] I'll try not to go along and and it's a
[31:33] it's a it's a little strange subject but
[31:36] you have to really listen to the whole
[31:39] thing to the end then you'll see what
[31:42] God has put upon my heart
[31:44] I want to take a subject and I want to
[31:47] title it Saul which we're going to read
[31:49] here in first time you ate Saul had to
[31:53] die
[31:54] Saul had to die
[31:58] but I want you to follow why he had to
[32:01] die because we're going to find out Saul
[32:05] even though he was a hindrance to
[32:08] himself he also was a hindrance to the
[32:11] gods Warriors that he had ordained to be
[32:14] Warriors
[32:15] so I want to show you this if you go
[32:17] with me in first Samuel chapter eight
[32:19] I'll try to go fast as I can
[32:22] I I can't really
[32:24] go too hard because I got a lot of
[32:27] pressure still upon my eye and I asked
[32:30] the doctor a couple weeks ago I said can
[32:33] I preach he said yeah you go ahead and
[32:34] preach I said well I ain't kind of like
[32:37] maybe you think he said oh you you
[32:39] really get it yeah let me get it he said
[32:42] well you maybe not want to do that just
[32:44] for a week or so like that but uh so I
[32:47] I'm just gonna kind of hold back a
[32:49] little bit but just I hope the holy
[32:51] spirit will keep your attention not me
[32:53] keeping your attention but I'm not used
[32:56] to going too slow I'm just not used to
[32:58] it but I'm gonna try now we want to talk
[33:02] about Saul but as we talk about Saul you
[33:06] remember in the prophet said scriptures
[33:08] have compound meanings
[33:10] so it depends on what subject you take
[33:13] but I want to take Saul's life as an
[33:17] influence to believers
[33:20] because that's exactly what he was but
[33:22] the good thing about the story of Saul
[33:24] we know even though he got an evil
[33:27] spirit on him he still went to heaven
[33:31] because some people say
[33:33] he went to heaven I said well he had to
[33:35] because Samuel told Saul by this time
[33:38] tomorrow you and your sons going to be
[33:40] where I'm at and we know Samuel went to
[33:42] heaven
[33:43] right so so but but I like that God put
[33:48] it that way because it still can show
[33:50] you can be a born-again believer but you
[33:53] can still get an evil spirit on you
[33:56] some of us don't want to admit things
[33:58] like that but yes you can get spirits on
[34:01] you but the thing of it is when you know
[34:03] when you were born again when the spirit
[34:05] get on you you're going to be convicted
[34:07] God is going to deal with you and you
[34:09] know it's wrong and you're going to get
[34:11] it off of you amen but I want to show
[34:14] you now I'm taking some thoughts even
[34:17] from the message reject the king but I
[34:19] want to build up Saul's life show you
[34:22] how he became the man that he is because
[34:24] Saul the spirit that was on Saul even
[34:28] before the evil spirit come upon him it
[34:32] was a spirit that I'm the big guy I am
[34:35] the man and I'm going to have my way and
[34:37] I'm gonna do what I want to do that
[34:40] Spirit was already on Saul before the
[34:43] evil spirit come on him so I want you to
[34:46] know this in the scripture let's go to
[34:48] verse 7 first Samuel chapter 8 verse one
[34:50] it said and it came to pass when Samuel
[34:53] was old that he made his sons judges
[34:57] over Israel amen now Samuel is a prophet
[35:00] notice he said he made his son judges
[35:04] over Israel God didn't
[35:06] Sam you did so he even showed that a
[35:09] prophet could make a wrong judgment
[35:11] can we say praise the Lord praise the
[35:13] Lord because now we can go a long way in
[35:16] that one but we ain't gonna go there he
[35:17] said now the name of the firstborn was
[35:19] Joel the name of the second avian they
[35:22] were judges in Beersheba and his sons
[35:25] walked not in his ways but turned aside
[35:28] after Luca and took brides and perverted
[35:30] judgments so that goes to show you even
[35:32] because he's a prophet that don't mean
[35:34] his son was going to go his way
[35:37] verse 5 and then it said I'm sorry verse
[35:40] 4 then all the Elders of Israel gathered
[35:42] together and came to Samuel and to Rhema
[35:44] and said unto him behold they are old
[35:47] thy Sons walk not in thy ways nor make
[35:50] now make us a king to judge us like all
[35:54] the nations one thing we have to
[35:56] understand about the scripture God did
[35:58] not get offended but the children of
[36:00] Israel when they did not want to follow
[36:02] Samuel's son that's what not that didn't
[36:05] offend God what hurt God was that they
[36:08] wanted a king
[36:10] amen but the thing displeased Samuel
[36:13] when Samuel said when they said give us
[36:15] a king to judge us and Samuel prayed
[36:18] unto the Lord and the Lord said it to
[36:21] Sam you're hearkening to the voice of
[36:22] the people and all that they saying
[36:24] today for they have not rejected thee
[36:27] but they have rejected me that I should
[36:29] not ring over them amen now let's go and
[36:33] uh for example I want to go down I want
[36:35] to go to verse 11.
[36:40] now verse 11
[36:43] I I put me a little heading to remember
[36:45] my thought
[36:47] uh versus starting at verse 11.
[36:51] Samuel is going to start telling them
[36:53] the type of person that they're going to
[36:55] get before it even happened he already
[36:57] gonna tell them everything that this
[36:59] guy's gonna do but here's what I want
[37:02] you to catch a lot of times when you
[37:05] have a desire for something
[37:07] that desire can actually be your trap
[37:11] God has given them their desire
[37:14] they wanted a king God was already their
[37:17] King but now he's going to give them
[37:19] their desire and Samuel's going to tell
[37:22] them exactly what your desire is going
[37:24] to do to you
[37:28] let's listen to it verse 11. he said
[37:32] this would be the man of King that shall
[37:35] ring over you
[37:36] he will take your sons
[37:38] and appoint them for himself
[37:41] for his chariots to be his Horseman and
[37:44] some shall run before his chariots verse
[37:47] 12 he would appoint unto him captains of
[37:50] a thousands Captain's over 50s and he
[37:53] will set them to ear his ground and to
[37:56] reap his Harvest and to make his
[37:57] instruments of war in his instruments of
[38:00] his chariots for the sake of time and
[38:03] I'm not going to read all of this if you
[38:06] read from verse 12 all the way on down
[38:10] to verse 17 there's a the main word you
[38:14] need to catch in this is h-i-s his
[38:18] it's listed through the whole thing
[38:21] so we're gonna see what the desire of
[38:25] the king that they're getting
[38:26] he ain't it's nothing
[38:29] he wants to do for them
[38:31] everything is listed where he want them
[38:35] to do for him
[38:37] his chariots his armor his his Horseman
[38:40] hit everything take your daughter
[38:42] everything is for his pleasure
[38:45] that's the whole thing with Saul life
[38:47] but you know that comes from somewhere
[38:50] now let's just follow along with me I
[38:53] want to show you where that comes from
[38:54] even in Saul's life go to First Samuel
[38:58] chapter nine
[39:02] verse 1. now there was a man of Benjamin
[39:06] whose name was Kish the son of able the
[39:09] son of zero and the son of bachelorette
[39:12] the son of Athea and a benjamite a
[39:15] mighty man of power now this is Saul's
[39:18] daddy a mighty man of power so himself
[39:23] come from a family that got power
[39:27] now watch this right here it's so now
[39:30] let's go to verse two and he had a son
[39:33] whose name was Saul a choice young man a
[39:36] goodly and there was not among the
[39:38] children of Israel a good leader person
[39:40] than he from his shoulders and upward he
[39:43] was higher than any of the people so
[39:46] Saul influence actually comes from his
[39:49] family by being in his family with power
[39:52] now he already a good looking fellow
[39:54] head and shoulders Above the Rest so he
[39:56] already got a spirit of Pride on it
[39:59] that ain't nobody going to tell me
[40:01] nothing I'm gonna do what I want to do
[40:02] but this is what the people chose
[40:05] this is what they wanted and God gave it
[40:08] to them amen so his influence comes from
[40:12] his father no I promise you Saul walked
[40:15] around do y'all know who my dad is
[40:18] my daddy is a man of power so you don't
[40:21] you don't want to mess with me hello
[40:23] this is kind of influence this man
[40:25] already had upon him so it was hidden
[40:28] down in him but eventually it begins to
[40:30] come out that's why he was able to
[40:33] disrespect the word of God what Samuel
[40:35] was telling him because he already got
[40:37] it in him but he just took a time for it
[40:39] to come out
[40:40] but this is what the people wanted
[40:44] can you follow me
[40:46] praise the Lord now if you will I want
[40:49] to turn to First Chronicles chapter 10.
[40:56] I want to tell you Saul had to die
[41:00] but my subtitle
[41:02] my saw
[41:03] had to die
[41:08] let me slow down a little bit
[41:14] remember
[41:17] Saul was over God's Army
[41:21] we can call him the commander-in-chief
[41:23] however you want to put it he was the
[41:25] king
[41:27] these were men Warriors you were finding
[41:31] Chronicles it would list different
[41:34] Warriors in their tribes the gifts that
[41:37] they had each one of them had a
[41:39] different gift each one of them had a
[41:41] battle tactic each one of them
[41:43] specialized in something
[41:44] and Saul was over those gifts
[41:48] now as we go down I want you to stay
[41:51] with my thought
[41:52] I like how God did it he knew they chose
[41:55] the wrong man God knew David was the man
[41:58] but what God had to do first a lot of
[42:00] times when we read about uh uh uh David
[42:04] and Goliath all of that is for a reason
[42:06] remember Saul they had a few victories
[42:09] before they got up to Goliath
[42:12] so the people no doubt watching Saul say
[42:15] oh we got a good King remember what was
[42:17] the purpose for this King to be like the
[42:20] other nations to fight our battle and to
[42:22] judge us
[42:24] that's what the purpose right you
[42:25] remember the prophecy in the message
[42:27] reject the king he said the Holy Spirit
[42:29] God want the Holy Spirit to be your king
[42:32] he wanted the Holy Spirit to be your
[42:34] judge
[42:35] but they wanted Saul but what God had to
[42:38] do to let them see uh at first like they
[42:41] was having victories but God had to get
[42:44] it to a place to let them see what you
[42:47] have chosen it's going to fail you
[42:50] all right so that's why we see when
[42:53] Goliath come up at that time and you see
[42:56] the children of Israel afraid even Saul
[42:58] was afraid himself that was for a
[43:01] purpose that I call that God set them up
[43:04] so he can let the people know this man
[43:07] that you chose is gonna fail you but I'm
[43:10] gonna show you the one that I chose for
[43:12] you so that's why sometimes and things
[43:14] in life when we get so attached to it
[43:17] God have to let it fall
[43:19] because it can be a wrong influence to
[43:21] you he has to let it fall
[43:24] can we say praise the Lord so then we
[43:26] see Saul the king himself afraid the man
[43:29] afraid because they lead it with friends
[43:31] but God had a perfect scenery because
[43:34] God want to bring David on the scene to
[43:36] let them know what I choose for you
[43:38] won't fail you so now let me let the
[43:41] other man fall
[43:42] and that's exactly what happened even
[43:45] though they misunderstood what David was
[43:48] doing because what David was trying to
[43:50] do is unveil God to them unveil Christ
[43:52] to them they missed it because they
[43:54] started lifting up David not God Saul
[43:58] killed this thousand David kills his
[44:00] tens of thousands no David wanted them
[44:02] to see that there is a true Living God
[44:04] in Israel and it's not by my might not
[44:07] my power God done this that's what David
[44:09] was trying to reveal to them and they
[44:11] missed the whole thing
[44:13] amen
[44:23] praise the Lord
[44:25] but as The Story Goes
[44:31] the very men
[44:34] the Warriors of God which is they had
[44:38] different gifts
[44:40] hey I ever thought about it
[44:42] these men was hunting David
[44:47] which saw
[44:49] but they didn't know why
[44:53] they was under an influence
[44:56] so much they didn't realize they're
[44:59] trying to kill David
[45:01] and as long as Saul was alive they
[45:05] couldn't see it
[45:06] but Saul had to die so they could
[45:09] actually see
[45:11] are you with me now let's go to First
[45:14] Chronicles chapter 10.
[45:18] so you got to understand by the spirit
[45:20] of Saul a spirit of Saul will not seek
[45:24] counsel from God
[45:27] it'll seek counsel from all other kind
[45:30] of different areas but it won't seek
[45:32] counsel from God that's a spirit of Saul
[45:35] we'll see that in the scriptures here
[45:37] now
[45:38] verse 10 I mean first Chronicles 10 11.
[45:41] it said when all jebished LED heard all
[45:45] that the Philistine had done to Saul
[45:47] this is where Helen died
[45:50] Bell Rose all the valid man took away
[45:54] the body of Saul and the bodies of his
[45:57] son brought them to jabish and buried
[45:59] their bones under the Oak and jabish
[46:01] fasted seven days
[46:03] Saul died
[46:05] for his transgression
[46:07] which he committed against the Lord even
[46:10] against the word of the Lord which he
[46:13] kept not
[46:14] and also for Action counsel a one that
[46:18] had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it
[46:21] so there's a certain reason God had to
[46:22] wipe him out
[46:24] and not inquired of the Lord that's why
[46:28] I said the spirit of Saul won't seek
[46:30] counsel from the word it won't seek
[46:32] counsel from God but it'll seek counsel
[46:34] from all other places that's a spirit of
[46:36] Saul
[46:38] amen and be quiet inquired not of the
[46:41] Lord therefore he slew him and turned
[46:44] the kingdom into David the son of Jesse
[46:48] now let's go to First Chronicles chapter
[46:50] 11.
[46:55] and let's go to verse one
[47:01] listening all Israel gathered himself to
[47:03] David into Hebrew and saying behold
[47:06] where are thy bones and thy flesh
[47:09] now I want you to watch verse two
[47:12] now what you got to get because I'm
[47:14] trying to not get into all of it the
[47:16] scriptures because it takes too long but
[47:19] I need you to keep this thought
[47:21] these men just talking to David right
[47:25] now
[47:26] all the same men that was hunting David
[47:29] uh
[47:30] chasing him down
[47:32] but now they come to David
[47:34] because Saul is dead
[47:37] by Soul dying
[47:40] extra spiritual Amnesia wow off of them
[47:43] watch what they say verse two
[47:47] they talking to David moreover
[47:50] in time past
[47:53] even when Saul was King thou was he that
[47:57] led us out and brought us in Israel as
[48:01] the Lord thy God said it to thee Thou
[48:03] shalt Feed My People Israel and thou
[48:06] shall be ruler Over My People Israel but
[48:09] when they was hunting David trying to
[48:11] kill David they was not thinking about
[48:13] this but now because their influence had
[48:16] died now they can see what the true
[48:19] perfect will of God is
[48:22] see a song spirit gives you Amnesia a
[48:26] song spirit makes you selfish a song
[48:28] Spirit make you only one what your
[48:30] desires are what feels right to you
[48:33] yeah
[48:36] amen
[48:37] verse three
[48:39] therefore all the Elders of Israel came
[48:41] to Hebrew David made a covenant with
[48:44] them in heaven before the Lord and they
[48:46] anointed David King over Israel
[48:48] according to the word by Samuel now
[48:52] let's go down to verse 23.
[48:57] I think I'm in
[48:59] First Chronicles 12 verse 23.
[49:03] yeah I'll give you the wrong scripture
[49:06] First Chronicles 11 verse 1.
[49:10] that's what I read okay now I want to go
[49:13] to First Chronicles 12 verse 23.
[49:20] they said these are the numbers of the
[49:22] Bands
[49:23] that were ready on to war
[49:26] came to David to Hebrew
[49:28] to turn the kingdom of Saul to him
[49:31] according to the word of the Lord so all
[49:34] of them Warriors when they come to David
[49:36] it was one purpose is to turn the
[49:38] kingdom of Saul over to David according
[49:42] to the word of Lord other words to put
[49:44] everything
[49:46] in this right place
[49:49] these was gifted men God predestinated
[49:52] gifts but under Saul the gifts was used
[49:56] to kill David
[50:00] that's why God sent a message
[50:02] go ahead and send a prophet all right
[50:04] yeah amen the Pentecostals the
[50:07] restoration of the gift true gifts of
[50:09] God
[50:10] but they got to a place they put the
[50:11] gifts over the word it began to hurt the
[50:14] kingdom of God not to help the kingdom
[50:16] of God so God had to give the prophets
[50:18] and the prophets in this day to put the
[50:21] gifts under the right administration of
[50:23] the message of the hour
[50:26] to break the amnesia
[50:28] it's the same parallel actually what I'm
[50:31] reading to you first Chronicles 12 is
[50:35] First Corinthians 12 in the New
[50:38] Testament
[50:39] amen because it deals with gifts
[50:42] just watch just watch
[50:45] first let's go to verse 38.
[50:49] all these Men of War
[50:52] that could keep rain came with a perfect
[50:54] heart to Hebron to make David King over
[50:57] all Israel and all the rest of us of
[51:01] Israel were a one heart to make David
[51:04] King I just really loved that
[51:07] now since Saul had died
[51:10] this influence is gone they're all under
[51:13] David now come together to do what make
[51:17] David King
[51:19] that's why every gift in the body of
[51:22] Christ
[51:23] when it's in the right perspective where
[51:25] it's supposed to be it's going to make
[51:27] Jesus king
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:33] I love it
[51:35] ah I guess I got a good little personal
[51:37] I'm sorry you're at home
[51:41] my song Gotta Die
[51:45] that's all Gotta Die
[51:47] you said what in the world are you
[51:48] talking about oh you got them
[51:50] oh yeah you got them you got to
[51:53] understand what the song is remember his
[51:55] his his oh
[51:58] for himself
[52:00] look what don't happen in ministries
[52:03] every ministering gift is ordained of
[52:07] God to make Jesus king
[52:10] when a minister remember even in the
[52:14] scripture Saul when they told them he
[52:17] Saul had a buddy Club
[52:20] the scripture tells us for his chariots
[52:23] for his Warriors he want everything for
[52:25] them so everything so everything that
[52:28] was in Saul's Circle he wanted to make
[52:30] sure they was taken care of see that's a
[52:33] spirit don't got into the ministry if
[52:35] you're not in my circle you're not in my
[52:37] Soul Caliber you don't care you don't
[52:40] matter
[52:41] see we managed to get to that place
[52:43] their fall got to die and realize every
[52:47] ordained Ministry that is called of God
[52:49] is me for for the body of Christ and not
[52:52] just no one and two or three no we're
[52:55] all supposed to work together by the
[52:57] spirit of God
[53:00] when you see this Minister fight with
[53:03] that one that's what they did what they
[53:04] do it's a Saul Spirit on God in the
[53:06] midst of it and it's on them and they
[53:08] need to let it die
[53:12] amen
[53:14] Hallelujah
[53:16] praise the Lord amen can we keep going
[53:19] yeah just a few more minutes
[53:24] I love it
[53:26] now
[53:27] when you read first Chronicles 12.
[53:31] you're going to read so many different
[53:32] qualifications
[53:35] expertise there are lists with each
[53:38] tribe Warriors had some could throw bows
[53:42] some could throw rocks with different
[53:44] hands and Spears swords it's just naming
[53:47] what each one of them can do
[53:50] but when they was on the song they were
[53:52] trying to kill David
[53:53] but when they come up on the Davis
[53:54] Administration they fought the right
[53:56] Wars
[53:58] so it's the same thing like I would have
[54:00] said earlier that's why this message had
[54:02] to come plenty of gift was out there in
[54:04] Pentecost so brother Brandon faced that
[54:07] challenge coming to those Pentecostals
[54:09] they could it could not deny what
[54:11] happened on the Zuzu Street
[54:15] hell brother Brown the pillar fire came
[54:18] down all of these things happened then
[54:20] he would have to come and tell them but
[54:22] it's more
[54:23] than that
[54:25] so that was a big challenge for him and
[54:28] they looking at him what you mean that's
[54:30] more than that he said it's the word why
[54:32] do you think he began to teach debate on
[54:34] tongues and things like that what was he
[54:37] doing taking it from a denominational
[54:38] Administration bringing it to the right
[54:41] Administration the word the gift
[54:43] supposed to be placed
[54:45] that was a challenge
[54:47] you and I we are thankful we don't have
[54:50] to worry about those things
[54:52] trying to put something in the right
[54:54] place because God knows some of the
[54:55] prophets to do those things we just keep
[54:57] following it because I believe this
[55:00] there are gifted people in every Church
[55:02] you got gifts in your lives but until we
[55:05] humble ourselves let the soul die in our
[55:08] lives let God put us in the right place
[55:11] that we're supposed to be it'll be more
[55:13] effective the way he wanted to be done
[55:16] yes
[55:18] but when you say me my gift my way my
[55:23] desire what I want to do God cannot use
[55:25] you to the potential that he wants to
[55:28] amen that's why we have to look into our
[55:31] own life and find my soul
[55:34] to Saul
[55:36] you gotta go buddy
[55:38] it could be Saul Pride
[55:41] Soul self
[55:43] because that's what that Spirit actually
[55:45] is
[55:48] but what was so interesting to me
[55:51] in first Chronicles 12. when it started
[55:54] listening all of the great things that
[55:57] each Warrior could do that's exciting
[56:00] it's exciting but then as you go down go
[56:03] to verse 39
[56:06] and they that were with David three days
[56:08] eating and drinking for their Brethren
[56:12] had prepared for them
[56:14] moreover they that would not them even
[56:17] into issachar Zeppelin Natalie brought
[56:20] bread and Ashes on camels and Mews and
[56:23] on oxen and meat milk cake spit Bunches
[56:26] of raisins and wine oil and oxen sheep
[56:29] abundant for there was joy in Israel
[56:31] notice it talking about Nestle and
[56:33] issachar even though they had some uh
[56:36] battle skills but it's talking about
[56:38] other things that they brought bread
[56:41] raisins and cakes see they're going to
[56:44] show everybody's not a fighter
[56:46] everybody's not a dangerous go out and
[56:48] just fight but these when they brought
[56:51] those raisins they brought the bread
[56:52] that was just as much important
[56:55] can we say man so sometimes you can feel
[56:58] it sit in church I ain't doing nothing
[57:01] ain't worth nothing what am I doing I
[57:03] ain't singing I ain't playing the
[57:05] instrument I ain't got no office that
[57:07] ain't got nothing to do with it friends
[57:08] you can bring a cake
[57:10] you can do something so simple and it'll
[57:13] benefit the body of Christ so that's why
[57:16] I wanted to point that out people want
[57:17] to do the great things but what about
[57:19] the small things
[57:20] wow
[57:23] bread cakes of figs Bunches of raisins
[57:28] and there's no less worry
[57:31] praise the Lord because there's a time
[57:33] to eat remember they had to be there the
[57:36] Warriors couldn't fight if they starve
[57:38] him
[57:39] they won't have no energy so you got to
[57:41] have something to feed feed the Warriors
[57:43] so they can fight so every one of us has
[57:46] a part in the body of Jesus Christ
[57:49] amen
[57:52] but you gotta let your soul die
[57:57] your own family
[57:59] you gotta let your soul die in your
[58:01] marriage
[58:03] here's my my huh you gotta let it die
[58:08] it's not what I want to benefit myself
[58:11] what can I do to benefit my wife what
[58:13] can I do to benefit my children what can
[58:15] I do to benefit the church what can I do
[58:17] not all about me
[58:20] Saul has such a selfish Spirit on him
[58:23] you remember when uh they wouldn't tell
[58:25] the uh when uh I'm sorry when one I
[58:29] can't remember the guy's name I think I
[58:32] know do egg but it was another guy
[58:37] Jason you probably can find that
[58:39] scripture for me right quick
[58:40] what part what Saul said
[58:43] it's right there in the scripture with
[58:46] do egg and Paul Saul told them nobody
[58:49] felt sorry for me
[58:51] to tell me
[58:53] that the son of David have come here
[58:54] nobody felt sorry for me
[58:57] when Saul said that look how selfish
[59:01] that man is
[59:03] he was telling the Warriors none of you
[59:07] feel sorry
[59:08] for me
[59:11] did not put some Spirit on there we were
[59:14] sorry we're sorry that's selfish
[59:18] when you get a person always want to act
[59:20] like they are the victim
[59:23] [Applause]
[59:25] every time you hear him talk
[59:27] they are the victim
[59:30] you don't know what people say about me
[59:32] you don't know what I'm going through
[59:34] you just don't understand
[59:37] talking like the victim and a lot of
[59:39] time you find they are the one that is
[59:41] the victimizers
[59:48] are we all right brother we're good yeah
[59:52] I'm just telling you songs and your life
[59:55] got to die
[59:57] if you want God to use all of the
[59:59] potentials that he put in your life
[1:00:01] correctly them songs they got to die
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:11] oh there we go first Samuel 2 20 28 22
[1:00:14] and eight he said that all you have
[1:00:17] conspired against me
[1:00:19] there's none shows me that my son had
[1:00:22] made a lead with the son of Jesse
[1:00:24] there's none of you
[1:00:26] that is sorry
[1:00:28] for me
[1:00:30] a show unto me that my son has stared up
[1:00:33] my servant against me to lie and wait
[1:00:36] as this day by them being on the song
[1:00:39] spirit all those years he was able to
[1:00:42] influence them
[1:00:44] to make them fall under his desires his
[1:00:48] wants
[1:00:50] so God said those are my gifts
[1:00:53] those are my Warriors they don't cross
[1:00:55] Cannon I don't gave them their place of
[1:00:57] Duty I don't gave them the plot of land
[1:00:59] those are my words under the wrong
[1:01:01] influence I gotta get this from up under
[1:01:03] that
[1:01:03] I gotta get them under David where they
[1:01:05] need to be so I can use those gifts the
[1:01:07] way I want them it's all you got to die
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:14] hello what about a preacher I'm only
[1:01:18] gonna I don't want to go preach for that
[1:01:20] brother I don't want to go preach there
[1:01:21] I don't want to preach there but I
[1:01:22] preached there I preach there that's a
[1:01:24] song Spirit on you
[1:01:26] come on you don't made your ministry
[1:01:28] your personal Ministry and not realize
[1:01:31] God is the one give it to you and
[1:01:32] whatever he not you to go he wants you
[1:01:34] to go you go
[1:01:41] I'm almost done
[1:01:45] but my purpose is
[1:01:47] each one of us can look down in our
[1:01:49] lives
[1:01:50] see where's my song
[1:01:54] the very thing you desire want so bad it
[1:01:57] could become your influence
[1:01:59] and that is what hindering your life all
[1:02:02] along
[1:02:07] turn me to First Corinthians 12 please
[1:02:15] you just don't know how bad I want to
[1:02:17] preach
[1:02:27] when I had surgery in my mouth and I got
[1:02:30] excited
[1:02:33] uh a brother was preaching for me kicked
[1:02:35] me I think it was brother Jewel
[1:02:37] preach for me and uh I got up behind him
[1:02:40] I got so excited
[1:02:43] next day it's pretty rough
[1:02:46] if my mouth
[1:02:48] Satan say uh-huh and I look at you now
[1:02:52] I said it's okay I'll be back
[1:02:55] you get your turn right now but I'm
[1:02:56] gonna be right back I'll come back at
[1:02:58] you again that's just the way it has to
[1:03:00] be friends we don't retreat we don't
[1:03:03] surrender we keep pressing on
[1:03:06] but we got to Die daily
[1:03:09] but the prophet said if Paul could say I
[1:03:12] Die daily
[1:03:14] he said what about you and me
[1:03:16] I have to Die daily
[1:03:21] in the daily the daily diet
[1:03:24] turns into weeks
[1:03:26] the weeks turns into months and the
[1:03:28] months turn into years so clearly
[1:03:31] continue to keep dying until you just
[1:03:33] completely die
[1:03:34] and like the prophet said stay dead
[1:03:40] amen praise the Lord
[1:03:44] I'll read the scripture and I'm going to
[1:03:46] quit God bless you
[1:03:49] First Corinthians chapter 12. he said
[1:03:51] now there are diversities of gifts
[1:03:55] but the Same Spirit if you read first
[1:03:58] Chronicles 12. it is talk about
[1:04:00] diversities of warriors
[1:04:03] but Same Spirit same as a diversity
[1:04:07] gifts in the body but for them to
[1:04:09] operate correctly got to fall up under
[1:04:11] the Same Spirit
[1:04:13] are you with me
[1:04:15] and there are different administrations
[1:04:17] but the same Lord song had a bowl song
[1:04:21] had a spirit song could make them
[1:04:22] weapons some couldn't make weapons some
[1:04:24] know how to use and I'm so thankful they
[1:04:27] said some of them was expert in all of
[1:04:28] them
[1:04:31] but
[1:04:32] to be under the Same Spirit it would be
[1:04:34] able to make David King
[1:04:36] but in our place it'll be able to make
[1:04:38] Jesus king
[1:04:41] that's the way it's supposed to be so to
[1:04:45] me
[1:04:46] it doesn't matter to me what somebody
[1:04:48] what how how good they preach
[1:04:51] which I'll enjoy
[1:04:53] I always listen
[1:04:55] where are they trying to take the people
[1:04:59] right closer to Jesus Christ
[1:05:02] are closer to themselves
[1:05:04] that's what I listen for because
[1:05:06] everything is supposed to be pointed to
[1:05:09] him
[1:05:11] people can say whatever they want to say
[1:05:13] about brother brown but you can't find
[1:05:15] me one's quote you can't show me one
[1:05:18] quote where he led us to himself
[1:05:22] it was always to Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] always
[1:05:29] and that's what should be the desire of
[1:05:31] every Pastor every minister they want to
[1:05:33] see people get closer to Jesus Christ
[1:05:39] we're on different levels in churches
[1:05:41] so I Don't Preach like everybody's on
[1:05:43] the same level I just preach because
[1:05:46] wherever you at the holy spirit will
[1:05:48] meet you there and bring you where you
[1:05:50] need to be that's God's business to do
[1:05:52] that it's not my business praise the
[1:05:56] lord I can't be like well let me just
[1:05:58] make sure I make it so simple you know
[1:06:00] what
[1:06:01] I heard a statement
[1:06:04] and it to me you got to be careful
[1:06:08] they asking questions now about the
[1:06:10] youth what could be done and the
[1:06:13] concerns of the youth today
[1:06:15] I can solve that for you
[1:06:19] if you ain't careful you're gonna start
[1:06:21] making programs for used
[1:06:24] then you're gonna get yourself in
[1:06:26] trouble
[1:06:27] I used to be a youth
[1:06:29] I used to be young it was no program for
[1:06:32] me but one when I come in the message
[1:06:35] that's come to this altar get the Holy
[1:06:38] Ghost be born again and grow
[1:06:42] so you want to make all these programs
[1:06:45] and forget the main thing get them down
[1:06:46] to God get them down to get the baptism
[1:06:48] of the Holy Ghost then most of your
[1:06:51] worries is gone because they'll grow
[1:06:53] but if you're going to create a certain
[1:06:55] thing duh friend that's just jumping
[1:06:58] over to a song denomination of spirit
[1:07:01] yeah
[1:07:03] before you know it
[1:07:06] a lot of young people what are we going
[1:07:08] to do preach to him
[1:07:10] live a life before her tell them about
[1:07:12] Jesus Christ tell them to study this
[1:07:14] message tell them to keep believing it
[1:07:17] you remember the prophet said what the
[1:07:20] devil want to do with this young
[1:07:21] generation and get them to lose
[1:07:23] confidence in the word
[1:07:25] because if you can get her to lose
[1:07:26] confidence in the word he got some
[1:07:28] that's why I tell them study pray what
[1:07:31] are you doing don't understand it that

[1:07:40] minister I read a lot of things I don't
[1:07:43] understand nothing I'm reading
[1:07:45] but you know what I don't get
[1:07:46] discouraged because I know it's the word
[1:07:48] of God I just believe it and somewhere
[1:07:52] down the road could be 10 years later
[1:07:54] somebody could say one thing that I've
[1:07:56] been pondering for 10 years and all of a
[1:07:58] sudden the light just turns on and let
[1:08:01] me tell you something when that light
[1:08:02] turns on ain't no devil Out of Hell

[1:08:42] hey man I was sitting behind him going
[1:08:44] careful careful
[1:08:46] oh my
[1:08:48] well you know I told sister Debbie at
[1:08:51] home this morning I said you know this
[1:08:53] this service is so unusual to me there
[1:08:55] was only really a handful of people here
[1:08:57] who knew brother Burley was going to be
[1:08:59] ministering today
[1:09:00] I kind of kept it close to the vest as
[1:09:03] they say but I told my wife I said you
[1:09:06] know
[1:09:07] I I hardly know what to make of it I
[1:09:10] felt so directly led to the Lord I said
[1:09:11] but I here's my expectation here's what
[1:09:13] I'm believing I said when I hear the
[1:09:16] sermon it'll make sense
[1:09:18] and I heard it today uh oh my my eyes
[1:09:22] have seen in my ears I've heard and I
[1:09:24] understand the mind of the Lord today I
[1:09:27] tell you what I I so appreciate a sermon
[1:09:30] like that I don't appreciate you outing
[1:09:32] me like that to my old church but
[1:09:35] amen my soul's got to die your Soul's
[1:09:38] got to die how about how about do we
[1:09:40] have a mass death of Saul to say oh my
[1:09:44] you know Saul he was uh he was the son
[1:09:46] of God but he had all these issues and I
[1:09:49] tell you if we're gonna I love the I'd
[1:09:52] never caught that parallel between first
[1:09:55] Chronicles 12 and First Corinthians 12.
[1:09:58] that was beautiful that was straight
[1:10:00] beautiful and
[1:10:02] um one is to make David King
[1:10:06] and it had a diversity of gifts A
[1:10:10] diversity of people and not all of them
[1:10:12] were Mighty Warriors of battle some of
[1:10:14] them were just good pastry chefs
[1:10:18] but everybody had a gift and everybody
[1:10:20] had a part once Saul got out of the way
[1:10:22] in the Amnesia evaporated they had one
[1:10:24] unified thing and that was to make David
[1:10:26] King when you get into the New Testament
[1:10:28] Church we all have many diverse gifts
[1:10:31] but it's all one spirit and that's to
[1:10:33] make Christ King
[1:10:34] how many feel unified today to say I
[1:10:37] want to make the Lord Jesus king over
[1:10:40] all of our Lives praise the Lord I
[1:10:43] enjoyed that today brother Burley wasn't

[1:11:08] Jews when they were dispersed throughout
[1:11:11] the world before they became a nation
[1:11:14] and brought back under their own flag uh

[1:11:20] saying every year when when they would
[1:11:23] come down to their to their feast and
[1:11:25] they would say next year Jerusalem and
[1:11:29] they said that for hundreds of years
[1:11:32] hundreds of years since the dispersion
[1:11:35] under Rome when they got scattered
[1:11:38] around the world they always had a
[1:11:40] testimony and that'd be one of the last
