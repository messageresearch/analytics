[37:44] these kind of times in the lord amen
[37:46] when we get so caught up we just
[37:48] lose ourselves amen thank you jesus
[37:51] let's go to
[37:52] uh saint john chapter one
[37:56] and i wanna i wanna start reading that
[37:57] verse ten
[38:00] he was in the world in the world
[38:03] was made by him and and the word
[38:07] and the world knew him not he came unto
[38:10] his own
[38:11] and his own received him not
[38:16] but as many as received him to them gave
[38:19] he power to become the sons of god
[38:22] even to them that believe on his name
[38:26] which were born not of blood not
[38:29] of the will of the flesh nor of the will
[38:33] of man but of god
[38:37] hallelujah amen let's go to romans
[38:40] chapter 8.
[38:46] romans chapter 8
[38:53] let's uh start at verse 18.
[38:58] romans 8 18 the bible says for i reckon
[39:01] that the sufferings of this present time
[39:03] are not worthy
[39:04] to be compared with the glory which
[39:06] shall be revealed in us
[39:08] for the earnest expectation of the
[39:11] creature
[39:12] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[39:16] sons of god
[39:18] hallelujah may the lord have a blessing
[39:19] to the reading of his word
[39:21] you can have your seats amen
[39:24] by god's grace um we want to use for a
[39:27] subject tonight quicken
[39:29] to manifest quicker to manifest and
[39:33] just to give you a little insight uh i
[39:36] believe the last time i was here i i i
[39:38] spoke about
[39:39] um god's expectation
[39:42] and you know this message right here is
[39:45] you know how you have a
[39:47] a hurricane right and the hurricane out
[39:50] on the ocean is full speed and it's
[39:52] maybe uh uh 200 miles per hour but as it
[39:56] hits land
[39:57] it begins to break off into other storms
[40:00] but all those storms are part of the
[40:02] initial hurricane
[40:03] and that's what this message is tonight
[40:06] this message is kind of a
[40:07] a tropical storm breaking off
[40:10] from god's expectation but if we can
[40:14] kind of
[40:14] if you kind of want to say a part two i
[40:16] don't i don't really
[40:18] know if it's a part two or not but we're
[40:20] kind of gonna be
[40:21] dealing with the same area so to speak
[40:24] but quicken to manifest you know the
[40:26] bible says that we were once dead and
[40:29] trespassed and sin
[40:30] but thee we were quickened amen quicken
[40:33] means to be made alive
[40:35] so church there's no reason why if we
[40:39] say we're being quickened by god
[40:41] god has given us a messenger and the
[40:43] word has
[40:44] has come to to make us live and we're
[40:47] alive
[40:48] there's no reason why we should have
[40:50] dead services
[40:52] there's no reasons why our worship
[40:54] should be dead
[40:55] our anything we do for god should be
[40:58] dead because
[40:59] we've been made alive there's there's a
[41:01] reason why god has quickened us
[41:04] and it's simply to manifest his life
[41:07] amen
[41:08] but you know as as i look and we think
[41:11] that
[41:11] you know just coming to churches because
[41:13] no coming to church is not good enough
[41:16] you have a purpose amen god created you
[41:20] with the purpose of a seed being inside
[41:23] of you hallelujah
[41:24] and just saying like this that uh
[41:27] the condition of the world from the
[41:30] beginning of time
[41:32] it made parts of god manifest hallelujah
[41:35] you know the prophet of god said that
[41:38] the condition of the
[41:39] sin it brought out more of the
[41:42] attributes of god
[41:43] you know there was no sickness so uh god
[41:47] being a healer he had to allow that
[41:50] so the attribute of who he was could
[41:52] come out hallelujah
[41:53] see god is all about demonstrating his
[41:56] life
[41:57] hallelujah but what i love about it he's
[42:00] made
[42:00] us a part of his life so who's the worst
[42:03] demonstrate now
[42:05] hallelujah you got something to do you
[42:08] got something to manifest
[42:09] if you are part of god's attributes this
[42:13] world this
[42:13] hour is calling for you to manifest god
[42:18] hallelujah we got to be more than just
[42:20] good christians sitting in a message
[42:22] believing church
[42:23] but there are people who need the
[42:25] attributes of god
[42:27] like there were people who needed
[42:28] healing there were people who needed
[42:30] salvation
[42:31] there were people that needed
[42:32] deliverance and the condition of the
[42:35] world
[42:35] made god unveil himself hallelujah so
[42:39] i'm saying if that same attribute of god
[42:42] has been quicker than you
[42:43] it will cause you to manifest who god is
[42:48] hallelujah oh my oh
[42:51] wow holy i feel like i'm in the park
[42:53] hallelujah
[42:54] glory and you just think about it
[42:57] quicken made alive
[42:59] church we're in a place where uh
[43:02] god told abraham he said there's nothing
[43:04] that i'll hide from abraham hallelujah
[43:07] because abraham went through all the
[43:09] testings of god
[43:11] to manifest the character of god and you
[43:14] think about a church
[43:15] all the things we go through it's very
[43:17] simple
[43:18] god is bringing us back into his image
[43:21] hallelujah
[43:22] so don't look at your trials as oh my
[43:24] like brother jews say why
[43:26] is he rousey wu no what he's doing is
[43:28] he's bringing forth
[43:30] a real live manifestation of his person
[43:33] hallelujah
[43:34] hallelujah and what a privilege it is
[43:37] hallelujah
[43:38] to not be just in the catholic church or
[43:41] or
[43:41] pentecostal church but we have the word
[43:45] of the hour
[43:46] hallelujah you know we say that so much
[43:49] that it doesn't even arise us anymore
[43:53] the message of the hour the message of
[43:55] the hour
[43:57] the message of the hour what does that
[43:59] mean
[44:00] that means that this message for this
[44:03] hour is here to manifest
[44:06] the character of god because in every
[44:09] hour there was a message and for that
[44:12] hour
[44:13] the people were quickened to manifest
[44:16] the life of god
[44:17] hallelujah and every age church if we
[44:20] could go as far back
[44:22] as let's just start let's just say
[44:23] luther hallelujah
[44:25] when the word was manifest in his hour
[44:28] what did he do
[44:28] he brought forth the character of faith
[44:32] hallelujah so he was quickened he was
[44:35] made alive
[44:36] even though he was in a dead church
[44:40] you see how powerful your calling is oh
[44:44] my
[44:44] let's read a little bit amen um
[44:49] i don't know if i have this one up there
[44:51] but uh let's go with it
[44:54] by the grace of god
[44:59] listen we're talking about is there's
[45:02] another scripture
[45:04] you know where it says if the spirit
[45:08] that raised up christ from the dead
[45:10] dwells in you
[45:12] it will also quicken your mortal body
[45:16] it will make your mortal body hallelujah
[45:19] do things supernatural
[45:22] wow hallelujah that spirit inside
[45:24] hallelujah
[45:26] if it raised up christ from the dead it
[45:28] has the same ability in you
[45:31] to do the same thing you did in christ
[45:33] we're not dealing with a different god
[45:35] we're not dealing with a different holy
[45:37] ghost we're not even dealing with
[45:38] different circumstances
[45:42] because god remains the same holy he
[45:45] created hallelujah
[45:46] everything around you to bring forth
[45:48] more of himself
[45:50] so what we ought to do is say lord here
[45:52] am i use me
[45:54] but look church he said if that spirit
[45:56] that raised up christ from the dead
[45:58] dwells in you it shall also quicken your
[46:01] mortal body
[46:02] that's the part that catches us we're
[46:04] waiting on a rapture no
[46:06] hallelujah you're going to manifest god
[46:08] on this side
[46:09] because that's the only way the rapture
[46:11] is going to take place
[46:13] is if god sees himself down here on this
[46:15] earth first
[46:16] hungry it's not going to take place
[46:18] because everything is right in heaven no
[46:20] it's going to take place because
[46:22] everything is right on earth
[46:24] in the believer that is hallelujah but
[46:27] we think about it the same god
[46:29] we should look for the same
[46:30] manifestation
[46:32] the same attributes the same character
[46:35] the same nature hollywood
[46:37] if you are quickened it will manifest
[46:39] the same god hallelujah
[46:43] don't let that go over your head now
[46:46] think about what god has done in your
[46:47] life
[46:49] has he been a healer to you talk to me
[46:52] church
[46:53] amen has he been your joy has he been
[46:56] your deliverance
[46:58] has he been your all in all and now he's
[47:01] saying that
[47:02] you are his attributes so it's time for
[47:05] you to be a deliverer
[47:10] church think about this i'm here because
[47:13] somebody i know got saved and
[47:14] demonstrated life before me
[47:21] it wasn't that i sat down and i read the
[47:23] book and
[47:24] the book started glowing and i was like
[47:26] wow god is calling me
[47:28] no i saw a converted parrot hardly i saw
[47:32] a converted mama hallelujah
[47:34] who was dedicated her to let god
[47:36] manifest himself
[47:38] out of her and that same life her
[47:41] would captivate me
[47:45] her being made alive she was quickened
[47:49] to manifest god as a savior
[47:52] and i saw god in her and i wanted to be
[47:55] saved
[47:57] and it's the same thing hallelujah life
[48:00] hallelujah
[48:01] breeds life so if you're quickened
[48:04] hurry it's for you to manifest more of
[48:07] god
[48:08] but we look we get we get we get we get
[48:11] stumped
[48:12] but we think about how powerful god is
[48:14] and all the things that we that he does
[48:16] and
[48:17] we say lord not me you're exactly right
[48:19] not you
[48:20] the seed in you
[48:23] amen i just love how brother jason put
[48:26] it on the bible study one day
[48:28] he said hear people say all the time i'm
[48:30] predestinated i'm predestinated
[48:32] i'm predestinated before the foundation
[48:34] of the world i'm predestinated why
[48:36] i'm predestinated he says no you're not
[48:39] it's that seed inside that's
[48:41] predestinated holy
[48:42] remember the bible says flesh and blood
[48:45] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[48:48] so what is god coming back for his very
[48:50] own life
[48:52] the seed that he planted in you and i
[48:55] before the foundation of the world
[48:57] once it starts to manifest the character
[48:59] of god it gets god's attention
[49:03] you notice that mother eagle didn't
[49:06] search
[49:07] into the eggs
[49:13] she didn't go looking for an egg
[49:15] hallelujah until there was something to
[49:17] look for
[49:18] until there was something to respond to
[49:20] the eagle's cry
[49:22] glory hallelujah
[49:26] cause look the prophet of god let me
[49:28] read this for you
[49:30] y'all know me it don't it don't take 500
[49:33] people for me to get excited
[49:37] it don't even take 10 holidays
[49:40] because when i start to think about what
[49:43] god has done for
[49:44] me and you know my i can feel god
[49:47] bringing me to a place
[49:49] you know where my heart's desire is to
[49:51] manifest the words that paul said
[49:54] if i glory i'm a glory of the things
[49:57] i've suffered
[49:58] knowing that those things are bringing
[50:00] me to the light of christ like
[50:02] perfection
[50:04] oh holy church did joseph know
[50:09] that all his trials and tribulation was
[50:12] leading him to the throne
[50:13] hardly here second in charge
[50:16] he had to fight jealousy he had to fight
[50:18] lies
[50:19] he had to fight pride he had to fight
[50:21] her sexual demons all kind of stuff
[50:24] he even had to fight loneliness but all
[50:26] of that
[50:27] put him at the top of his sprint his
[50:29] place
[50:31] and all those spirits that he had to
[50:33] fight god put it all back in the palm of
[50:35] his hand
[50:38] wow reason why you don't give it to some
[50:41] of us right now
[50:42] because we can't handle it holy there
[50:45] are gifts
[50:46] of the spirit land in the church but the
[50:48] reason why they don't operate for one
[50:50] hallelujah we're not sold out enough
[50:53] hallelujah
[50:54] for two hallelujah if god was to show us
[50:57] some things
[50:58] that's going on amongst our sisters and
[51:00] brothers we'll treat them different
[51:03] because we don't have the character yet
[51:05] so god lets you go through things why to
[51:08] develop compassion wow
[51:10] hallelujah hallelujah so when you see
[51:13] somebody's child
[51:14] go to the world you have compassion why

[51:32] and the person come to tell you
[51:33] they'll be like well i'm struggling

[51:52] there yet but
[51:53] i'm trusting and believing oh you
[51:55] trusting and believing now
[51:56] when there's somebody else by the devil
[51:58] to pat him up
[52:04] see what i love about god we're in a
[52:07] time right now
[52:08] holly where god is dealing with the
[52:10] person in the mirror
[52:13] we got to take our eyes off the people
[52:14] that left take your eyes on the people
[52:17] that's criticizing
[52:18] and look at what you're manifesting

[52:22] do you realize that your life could be
[52:24] so powerful enough
[52:26] it can make all the people behind you
[52:28] get courage
[52:30] david's life was so powerful a army that
[52:33] was paralyzed
[52:35] david set everybody free when the life
[52:37] went down
[52:38] why because he came to manifest that god
[52:41] was a warrior
[52:47] goliath was created so david could kill
[52:50] him
[52:51] wow
[52:54] that was his only purpose
[52:57] and he was created hallelujah as a
[53:00] legend hallelujah

[53:04] land that land
[53:05] he had a great reputation god let him
[53:08] get really big
[53:09] so he can make david bigger
[53:15] and you're wondering why you're here
[53:17] because there's
[53:18] parts of god there's parts of god's
[53:20] attribute
[53:21] that this hour is calling for
[53:24] god is calling for a people that will
[53:27] restore the rainbow
[53:28] not for pride day they will restore the
[53:32] covenant hallelujah
[53:33] say that coveted rainbow belongs to the
[53:35] bride
[53:38] wow you were created in this day
[53:42] hallelujah
[53:43] where you have to fight those kind of
[53:44] spirits and not
[53:46] fight the people
[53:49] look church there are things that only
[53:52] you
[53:53] will quicken so you can manifest
[53:56] nobody else could beat goliath but david
[54:00] saul was about six nine two hallelujah

[54:12] if the whole nations are eight feet ten
[54:14] feet where are they now

[54:33] as a 10-foot giant hallelujah and you
[54:35] look at that you'll be like
[54:37] god i can't kill somebody 10 feet but
[54:39] let's bring them down to 6
[54:40] 9.
[54:45] that's still a giant to me hallelujah
[54:47] because he because he was 10 centimeters
[54:49] taller than me
[54:50] so in my in my face he's a giant
[54:52] hallelujah but if he's a giant
[54:55] god manifests me he quickened me holly
[54:57] to understand
[54:58] that there's nothing too tall or too big
[55:01] for my god
[55:03] hallelujah but you look church just i i
[55:06] feel my helper brother jason hallelujah

[55:14] kingdom and his reputation went
[55:16] throughout the whole
[55:16] earth and he was so confident in who he
[55:19] was hallelujah
[55:20] his confidence was spewing out of his
[55:22] mouth
[55:23] he'd go down to the army and say bring
[55:26] me a man
[55:29] one of the greatest trash talkers that
[55:31] ever lived
[55:36] i hope you all ain't afraid of a little
[55:38] devil trash talk
[55:39] because god is already dealt with his
[55:41] trash talk
[55:43] somebody gonna cut your lights off he
[55:45] gonna take your children
[55:46] you ain't gonna pay your bills god
[55:48] didn't already dealt with spiritual

[55:53] and he was so bold harley see he was
[55:56] manifesting the life of his father
[55:59] here hallelujah all talk
[56:02] and no substance in the presence of god
[56:08] notice i said in the presence of god
[56:10] around unbelievers he was somebody big
[56:13] but to david he was just another man
[56:16] he was just another man notice one time
[56:19] david never called him a giant
[56:27] wow he never called him a giant david
[56:31] said it just like he was supposed to be
[56:33] saying you're an unbeliever
[56:36] right and you going down right i'm gonna
[56:38] cut your head off
[56:39] and i don't even have a sword
[56:44] come on church david was mad if david
[56:47] was quickened
[56:48] to manifest faith hallelujah in the
[56:50] unseen realm
[56:52] david was quick and hardly to speak
[56:54] things into existence
[56:56] that looked like it shouldn't be
[56:59] in that hour that was his hour
[57:03] it was none of his brothers and some of
[57:05] them were bigger than he was
[57:06] it wasn't saul and none of the other
[57:08] mighty men that were there
[57:10] it was only david david was there
[57:13] hallelujah why because goliath was on
[57:15] the scene
[57:16] so when goliath was born david had to be
[57:19] born because in god's mind
[57:21] only david could take care of him
[57:25] oh hallelujah so you had to be in this
[57:27] day
[57:28] to fight a covet all right
[57:32] i just heard a testimony from a friend
[57:34] of mine in london
[57:35] church he he uh uh constructed
[57:39] i can't think of the right contract or
[57:40] whatever they call it
[57:42] covet and it messed up his respiratory
[57:45] system
[57:46] and he started breathing real bad his
[57:48] wife was you know they were sitting at
[57:50] home and they were saying
[57:51] well let's pray about let's pray about
[57:52] it then it got to a place i think she
[57:54] was a nurse
[57:55] where she tested his chest and full of
[57:57] fluid
[57:58] and it's when that happened you go on
[58:00] your way out
[58:01] and she said i can't take it no longer
[58:04] let's go to the hospital talk to the
[58:05] hospital
[58:06] they put them on a respirator and they
[58:07] say look you got to be on this
[58:09] respirator
[58:10] for a couple hours the couple hours
[58:12] turned into 12 days
[58:15] and in those 12 days when he got there
[58:18] he slipped into a coma
[58:20] so 12 days he was in a coma
[58:23] fighting coven how was he fighting by
[58:25] the prayers of the saints
[58:29] wow there were people in his church that
[58:32] would manifest for that hour
[58:34] just to pray for him
[58:38] they might not they might not never do
[58:40] anything else
[58:41] hallelujah but god heard their prayers
[58:44] holly
[58:44] they were quickened quicker to what
[58:46] hallelujah
[58:47] to believe that god asked his prayer
[58:50] and they had to be in their position
[58:53] praying for that brother
[58:54] because he couldn't pray that's why the
[58:56] scripture calls us
[58:57] kings and priests because somebody had
[59:00] to be there
[59:01] to step in the role of an intercessor
[59:06] he's still the same god remember
[59:10] that scripture because jesus said holy
[59:13] the devil desires to sift you as weak
[59:15] but i have prayed for you
[59:17] hallelujah before it even happens god
[59:19] says i have prayed for you
[59:22] hallelujah and luke church they were
[59:25] looking for him to die
[59:27] but the saints kept praying and then all
[59:29] of a sudden
[59:31] he woke up amen what did you expect when
[59:34] believers pray
[59:38] i don't know about y'all but look
[59:41] joshua was manifest to come after moses
[59:46] holly because he was going to do things
[59:48] in his church
[59:49] that them hard-headed believers wouldn't
[59:51] do in moses church
[59:53] so joshua had to have an attitude that
[59:55] i'm not going to put up with all the
[59:57] slandering of a prophet
[1:00:00] when you act up we're gonna kill you and
[1:00:02] your whole family your cousins everybody
[1:00:08] remember god told them do not touch your
[1:00:11] cursing things
[1:00:12] and again say well uh was it
[1:00:15] was he a prophet before 63 or after 63.
[1:00:20] you couldn't do that in joshua church
[1:00:22] was no reasoning in that church
[1:00:24] whatever the prophet said it was a
[1:00:25] prophet speaking
[1:00:27] hallelujah but you know now we're in a
[1:00:29] day where we have a reasoning spirit
[1:00:31] where people say well did he say that
[1:00:33] before 63 or after 63.
[1:00:35] i know i was preaching someplace i ain't
[1:00:36] going to say the name but a brother came
[1:00:38] up to me after church and i still called
[1:00:39] him a brother
[1:00:40] he came with me out of church he said
[1:00:42] well brother this and that this
[1:00:43] he said you kind of lost me and i was
[1:00:46] talking about the god of the universe
[1:00:48] before there was ever a universe he was
[1:00:50] just self-existing
[1:00:52] he was just he wasn't even god yet
[1:00:54] hallelujah
[1:00:55] he was just a great eternal he was like
[1:00:57] oh brother you know this and that blah
[1:00:59] blah blah you know
[1:01:00] he said you just kind of lost my saying
[1:01:01] what and he started saying what i said i
[1:01:04] said you believe the prophet
[1:01:06] he said yeah i believe the prophet so i
[1:01:08] showed him the direct
[1:01:10] quote i was quoting so you see that
[1:01:11] you're a believer huh there go
[1:01:13] huh you believe it look at it look at it
[1:01:15] he said well uh
[1:01:17] i believe him after 63. i looked him
[1:01:20] straight in his face
[1:01:21] and i said you know what you ain't a
[1:01:23] believer wow
[1:01:26] right there in this church and let me
[1:01:29] tell you something
[1:01:29] people will respect you when you're
[1:01:31] honest with them
[1:01:34] you need to tell me i'mma get there and
[1:01:35] preach my heart out and then you're
[1:01:37] gonna come to me and tell me it wasn't
[1:01:38] god
[1:01:39] you think i'm gonna sit there and let
[1:01:40] you bark at me like that
[1:01:43] and you haven't noticed honey i'm a
[1:01:45] bloodhound but sometimes i can turn into
[1:01:47] a lion
[1:01:52] oh man all this just you think about
[1:01:53] preachers that you like to criticize and
[1:01:56] brother i'm telling my real preachers
[1:01:57] holy those field preachers that stay in
[1:02:00] labor and
[1:02:00] and praying do all these things and even
[1:02:03] get in the pulpit and afraid
[1:02:04] that they're going to say something
[1:02:06] wrong and you got the courage to walk up
[1:02:08] to them and say that wasn't god
[1:02:14] you heard what god told miriam and aaron
[1:02:16] he said are you afraid of god
[1:02:18] you're going to talk to moses like that
[1:02:20] he said i talk to others
[1:02:22] through dreams and and different things
[1:02:24] he said but it ain't so with moses
[1:02:26] i speak face to face lift the ear with
[1:02:28] him
[1:02:30] and you don't go up there and judge a
[1:02:32] man by his mistakes
[1:02:33] or you're gonna judge him by his trials
[1:02:35] you're gonna judge him by his family

[1:06:24] verse
[1:06:26] this paragraph 86 gideon he says
[1:06:30] uh now the holy spirit
[1:06:33] is here on the earth looking out for
[1:06:36] those individuals
[1:06:37] that god has ordained to life in this
[1:06:41] age hallelujah think about that church
[1:06:44] now what he's doing is he just got
[1:06:46] finished talking about the the eagle
[1:06:49] and he says how that eagle knows how
[1:06:51] many eggs it had had
[1:06:54] he said but some kind of way one gets
[1:06:56] lost so he takes the one
[1:06:57] hallelujah and it goes and sits on that
[1:07:00] and hatches
[1:07:01] and once that one hatches that mother
[1:07:03] eagle starts searching for the other egg
[1:07:05] and he says the holy spirit hallelujah
[1:07:08] is here
[1:07:09] looking out holy those individuals that
[1:07:12] god has a day to life
[1:07:14] in this age so the holy spirit is
[1:07:17] searching for you
[1:07:20] that's what these anointings is in
[1:07:22] church holy god is trying to quicken
[1:07:24] that life
[1:07:25] so the real you can come out
[1:07:28] this ain't about just gathering in
[1:07:30] bethel tabernacle no
[1:07:31] there's a quicker thing going on the
[1:07:35] word is here
[1:07:36] to make you alive a baptist doctrine
[1:07:39] couldn't do it
[1:07:40] a catholic doctrine couldn't do it a
[1:07:42] pentecostal couldn't do it it has to be
[1:07:44] the word for your power
[1:07:48] what kind of word for your hour remember
[1:07:50] luther's hour
[1:07:51] the word was faith whether it's
[1:07:55] the world was satisfication and there
[1:07:57] were individuals quickened
[1:07:59] to manifest what they were preaching i
[1:08:01] hope you're with me church
[1:08:03] there were people hallelujah who didn't
[1:08:05] even know who they were
[1:08:07] to those reformers started preaching the
[1:08:09] word
[1:08:12] they look like just ordinary people holy
[1:08:15] you know that you're so special you can
[1:08:18] make preachers preach on your trial
[1:08:24] it just happened several times
[1:08:28] and you heard and i can't get this out
[1:08:30] of my system
[1:08:31] every time i get down in prayer all i
[1:08:34] can hear is
[1:08:36] rachel putting restore all over the
[1:08:38] house
[1:08:40] now i think that happened just for us to
[1:08:42] say my she's close to god
[1:08:44] that happened for all of us so we could
[1:08:47] see that god hears our prayer
[1:08:49] we just got to get desperate
[1:08:54] holy and you know what i do for man you
[1:08:57] know what i do i get down in prayer
[1:08:58] i say lord you did it for rachel and
[1:08:59] matt
[1:09:01] you did it for them you can't be a
[1:09:03] respected person
[1:09:04] right and i know we believe the same
[1:09:07] thing so i said god you heard her prayer
[1:09:09] holy when you said our restored you
[1:09:12] weren't just talking to her
[1:09:13] you were talking to all of us
[1:09:15] [Applause]
[1:09:19] but that's what we do we look at god
[1:09:20] answering the prayer of one of our
[1:09:22] brothers and sisters and we think it's
[1:09:24] just for them
[1:09:25] no she was quicker to manifest that in
[1:09:28] your ears
[1:09:32] what is it really saying what it's
[1:09:34] really saying is that the word
[1:09:36] that's coming over this pulpit this
[1:09:39] pulpit
[1:09:39] holy is producing real believers that
[1:09:42] can get in contact with god
[1:09:50] and don't get jealous and you just sit
[1:09:51] there and say well god ain't asking my
[1:09:53] prayer
[1:09:53] ask yourself why
[1:09:57] there's nothing wrong with god if
[1:10:00] prayers are not being answered the
[1:10:01] problem
[1:10:02] always relies with that person in the
[1:10:03] mirror
[1:10:05] but he says the walking he's even showed
[1:10:07] it to me a different way
[1:10:08] that church even sometimes when you pray
[1:10:12] the answer may not come simply because
[1:10:14] it's not time
[1:10:17] because remember it took 21 days god
[1:10:20] already had the answer coming
[1:10:21] but it took 21 days hallelujah the
[1:10:24] angels just had to fight some demons
[1:10:27] hallelujah but what i love about it when
[1:10:30] they got through
[1:10:31] hallelujah the angel said he said dale
[1:10:34] as soon as you turn your face holy
[1:10:36] rachel as soon as you turn your face god
[1:10:38] was putting it on brother john's heart
[1:10:40] to preach our restore
[1:10:46] and that's a message hold you that's a
[1:10:49] message to all your children hallelujah
[1:10:51] everything that you love hallelujah
[1:10:53] y'all better pay attention because your
[1:10:55] parents got contact with god
[1:10:59] don't try to live your own life holly
[1:11:01] because they sitting there hardly
[1:11:03] they were created hardly to stand guard
[1:11:05] over you
[1:11:12] hallelujah listen
[1:11:15] he says now the holy spirit is here on
[1:11:17] earth looking out
[1:11:18] for those individuals that god has
[1:11:20] ordained to life in this age
[1:11:22] and as soon as it finds it it
[1:11:26] does look at us now it does just like it
[1:11:29] did on jesus christ
[1:11:32] so when the holy spirit finds you it has
[1:11:34] to manifest the same thing it did in
[1:11:38] christ
[1:11:40] i know that went over some of y'all
[1:11:41] heard but i want you to put your big
[1:11:43] gloves out
[1:11:46] look this is not a playoff we in the
[1:11:48] world series right now
[1:11:50] holy you got to put your gloves up
[1:11:52] hallelujah you got to catch everything
[1:11:54] god is saying to you
[1:11:58] if it looks like it's going over the
[1:11:59] fence ask god to let you fly
[1:12:02] yeah come on go up there and get it
[1:12:06] hallelujah there was a song that said i
[1:12:10] believe i can fly
[1:12:17] listen he said it does just like it did
[1:12:20] in jesus christ
[1:12:21] the great super son of god who redeemed
[1:12:24] us all
[1:12:25] it comes down and takes his place of a
[1:12:28] bold into the human life
[1:12:29] now he's talking about the holy spirit
[1:12:32] he's talking about the same life of
[1:12:33] christ
[1:12:34] once you're quickened the word of god
[1:12:37] the spirit of god the life of god
[1:12:39] comes down in you and it takes it abold
[1:12:42] now you tell me hallelujah if god comes
[1:12:45] inside of you what should it manifest
[1:12:49] god cause brother branham said if i had
[1:12:51] the spirit of john diliger
[1:12:53] you expect me to be shooting guns cause
[1:12:55] i got his spirit
[1:12:57] he said if i had a spirit of some super
[1:12:58] mechanic you expect me to be able to fix
[1:13:00] things he said if i had the spirit of
[1:13:02] beethoven you expect
[1:13:04] me to orchestrate but i ain't got none
[1:13:06] of those spirits i got the spirit of
[1:13:08] jesus christ
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:10] hallelujah so when we pray we should
[1:13:13] expect demons to
[1:13:17] when we move we should expect creation
[1:13:20] to listen
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:22] because we're quickened to manifest the
[1:13:24] life of god
[1:13:35] he said it comes down and takes his
[1:13:36] abode in the human life now notice
[1:13:39] how you brought the quickening power he
[1:13:42] said now
[1:13:43] that quickening power that comes upon
[1:13:45] jesus
[1:13:46] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:13:49] of the word of that day so why did god
[1:13:52] send a message
[1:13:54] for us to manifest every promise for our
[1:13:58] day
[1:14:01] you know church i'll be looking at the
[1:14:04] titles of the message sometimes
[1:14:08] and god has shown me that more than just
[1:14:10] titles
[1:14:13] spoken word is the original seed
[1:14:19] that's an event given to the believer
[1:14:23] her christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:14:28] that's a manifestation in the believer's
[1:14:30] life
[1:14:32] and i got i just got one that just sets
[1:14:34] me on a rooftop holy
[1:14:36] the prophet of god here was inspired he
[1:14:38] was quickened
[1:14:39] to preach a message called the mighty
[1:14:41] god unveiled
[1:14:43] hallelujah church that's not a title god
[1:14:46] was actually showing the believers
[1:14:48] i'm here
[1:14:51] i'm here and then he didn't got the
[1:14:54] prophet to say
[1:14:54] holy god says things hallelujah that
[1:14:57] fears down the crowd
[1:15:01] because some people can't see god being
[1:15:03] god
[1:15:04] inside of their weak flesh but let me
[1:15:07] tell you something
[1:15:08] the flesh of jesus was just as weak as
[1:15:11] yours
[1:15:11] but what made it strong was the spirit
[1:15:13] inside
[1:15:15] his flesh could bleed his flesh could
[1:15:18] hurt
[1:15:18] his flesh could black style but what
[1:15:20] stopped all that spirit inside
[1:15:26] he didn't put you in a different body of
[1:15:27] flesh it's the same flesh
[1:15:29] that's why he had to give us the same
[1:15:31] spirit
[1:15:33] wow hallelujah
[1:15:38] he said oh but jesus you know his flesh
[1:15:40] was stronger than ours
[1:15:42] no flesh is flesh
[1:15:46] it was the character and nature of god
[1:15:49] holy without sin
[1:15:53] living in that body that's why i could
[1:15:56] overcome
[1:15:56] every temptation it could overcome every
[1:15:59] reasoning spirit hallelujah
[1:16:02] why because of that spirit inside holy
[1:16:05] look jesus holy let me finish reading it
[1:16:10] he had a purpose amen he said now the
[1:16:13] quickening power
[1:16:15] that came up on jesus quicken him listen
[1:16:18] the prophet god said jesus was quickened
[1:16:23] wow he was made alive
[1:16:29] house ago that the first adam was a
[1:16:33] was it was a was it was a hyper
[1:16:36] rejection the first adam was living so
[1:16:38] the second album was a
[1:16:39] quickening spirit
[1:16:44] y'all keep pulling it's coming to me
[1:16:48] see he's trying to tell us hallelujah
[1:16:50] this is not just a body
[1:16:52] that god created to be a trophy
[1:16:55] he didn't want adam to be a trophy he
[1:16:58] let adam go his own way make his own
[1:17:00] decisions hallelujah
[1:17:01] to show us that no matter what you do
[1:17:03] hallelujah he'll still call your name
[1:17:05] and put you back in position
[1:17:10] i know about y'all i did some things
[1:17:12] that are not worthy of this gospel holly
[1:17:15] but it's too late god has already fell
[1:17:17] in love with me
[1:17:19] it's too late he's already given me the
[1:17:21] holy spirit and he can't take it back
[1:17:25] with all my mistakes with all my
[1:17:27] shortcomings hallelujah
[1:17:31] i'm gonna read you something else and he
[1:17:32] gonna shake your boots
[1:17:35] he said quicken him to manifest every
[1:17:37] promise of the word
[1:17:38] of that day think about that church god
[1:17:41] gave us a message for this
[1:17:43] hour we were quickened to manifest every
[1:17:46] word for our day
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:51] and i know sometimes you think he said
[1:17:53] oh god use brother brethren he wants to
[1:17:54] use you
[1:18:00] he said so does the holy spirit that
[1:18:02] comes upon us
[1:18:03] this day if it's not a mockery holy
[1:18:06] spirit
[1:18:07] if it's not the devil mark in the holy
[1:18:09] spirit but
[1:18:10] it's but is the real true holy spirit
[1:18:12] it'll manifest the promise of this
[1:18:15] hour of this hour
[1:18:20] so that means hallelujah every revealed
[1:18:23] word belongs to us
[1:18:26] hallelujah everything that that prophet
[1:18:29] preached
[1:18:29] by revelation for our day belongs to you
[1:18:32] and i
[1:18:33] yeah everything
[1:18:38] hallelujah events taking place
[1:18:41] hallelujah you know i was even thinking
[1:18:43] about the seventh seal
[1:18:45] earlier you know uh the real mystery of
[1:18:48] the seventh seal
[1:18:49] is is is is is you know god incompletion
[1:18:53] hallelujah
[1:18:54] it's not necessarily i mean there is a
[1:18:56] seal that had to be opened and loosed
[1:18:58] and all these things
[1:18:59] but there's a greater seal hallelujah of
[1:19:02] the seven seals
[1:19:03] that we go over hallelujah remember the
[1:19:05] bible said hallelujah
[1:19:07] that in that capstone there was a
[1:19:09] ceiling starting with virtue
[1:19:12] hallelujah and it took all of those
[1:19:14] seals hallelujah
[1:19:15] to get us to the top hunley but see the
[1:19:18] thing about those seals
[1:19:20] nobody knows you got it or not but you
[1:19:22] and god
[1:19:30] nobody knows if you got real patience so
[1:19:34] god will put you in place to manifest it
[1:19:36] hallelujah
[1:19:36] nobody knows if you got temporary
[1:19:38] self-control so god will put you in a
[1:19:40] position
[1:19:41] where you can manifest that ceiling
[1:19:47] oh my thank god for the opening of the
[1:19:49] seals
[1:19:54] no the service seal has been opened is
[1:19:57] not silent
[1:20:01] because i can feel godliness brotherly
[1:20:03] kindness and all these things working in
[1:20:05] my life
[1:20:09] oh my look i'm gonna try to move kind of
[1:20:13] quickly
[1:20:14] because i want to hold y'all too long
[1:20:16] look give me give me eight or seven
[1:20:17] gideon
[1:20:19] he says now um what i'm talking about
[1:20:21] when the word came
[1:20:22] in a particular hour we believe we got
[1:20:24] the message of the hour right
[1:20:26] now you what what we're gonna show you
[1:20:28] how the prophet preached that
[1:20:30] for every hour a word came in and
[1:20:31] manifested to a people
[1:20:33] hallelujah and it and it and it
[1:20:36] fulfilled
[1:20:37] what that word was saying he said when
[1:20:38] it fell upon luther
[1:20:40] it manifests that promise of that hour
[1:20:43] when it fell upon wesley
[1:20:44] it manifests the promise of that hour
[1:20:46] when it fail when it falls in this day
[1:20:49] it manifests the promise of this hour
[1:20:53] when it fail upon moses it manifests
[1:20:56] the promise hallelujah of that hour
[1:21:00] he says fell upon knowing now this is
[1:21:02] where i want to stop hardly
[1:21:05] god created noah because noah was the
[1:21:08] only one that could make it rain
[1:21:16] was the only one that could make it rain
[1:21:18] there were people all over the earth
[1:21:20] but god chose noah because noah was the
[1:21:23] only one
[1:21:24] that could be quicker and hallelujah to
[1:21:26] manifest rain
[1:21:30] why did the rain come because noah
[1:21:33] stayed with his message
[1:21:36] that's the only reason why the rain came
[1:21:38] because he was quickened
[1:21:40] to believe in what god said holy nobody
[1:21:44] else could do it hallelujah
[1:21:45] and you know i believe the prophet said
[1:21:47] that there were other boats in that day
[1:21:49] hollywood but noah was the only one that
[1:21:52] could
[1:21:52] understand what god was really calling
[1:21:54] for
[1:21:56] he was calling for a life that could be
[1:21:58] judgment proof
[1:22:04] hallelujah and you know
[1:22:08] look noah was made alive
[1:22:12] he was given the grace of god just so he
[1:22:14] could preach
[1:22:16] it's gonna rain he'd have to take
[1:22:19] another text
[1:22:21] it's gonna rain his children back up he
[1:22:23] says hey
[1:22:24] didn't i tell y'all it's gonna rain
[1:22:26] white bears say no we're gonna have a
[1:22:28] date night he said honey it's gonna rain
[1:22:31] we'll go to olive garden some other time
[1:22:32] but right now it's gonna rain
[1:22:35] hallelujah the teacher's calling from
[1:22:37] school and he said son
[1:22:39] daughter it's going to rain holy people
[1:22:42] acting up in church
[1:22:43] it's going to rain and he stayed with
[1:22:45] that message why
[1:22:47] he was going to manifest something where
[1:22:49] did the rain come from
[1:22:50] it came from noah's belief
[1:22:55] wow god would have never let it rain if
[1:22:58] noah didn't believe god
[1:23:01] so why did it came why did the rain come
[1:23:03] because noah believed
[1:23:09] and it'll be the same thing in your game
[1:23:11] where is this rapture coming from
[1:23:13] from your faith
[1:23:17] where's the body change coming from from
[1:23:19] what you believe
[1:23:23] hallelujah he said no it manifests the
[1:23:26] promise of that our will
[1:23:28] it fell upon jesus it manifests the
[1:23:30] promise of that hour
[1:23:32] what was the promise for his hour or
[1:23:34] resurrection
[1:23:38] jesus came he was quickened hallelujah
[1:23:41] just stripped satan from all his power
[1:23:45] but look how he had to go through he had
[1:23:46] to be whipped
[1:23:48] he had to be rejected by the people he
[1:23:50] loved he had to be talked about hashtag
[1:23:53] all kind of stuff earlier but that was
[1:23:55] the only way
[1:23:57] he could manifest hallelujah the promise
[1:24:00] of god in his day hallelujah
[1:24:03] for his hour his calling remember
[1:24:06] hallelujah
[1:24:06] he even said lord if it be possible
[1:24:08] please let this cup pass for me
[1:24:12] but god put something in him hallelujah
[1:24:15] that he cast down reasoning and he said
[1:24:18] lord nevertheless not that will
[1:24:20] thy will be done he was quickened
[1:24:25] to manifest resurrection power
[1:24:29] for that day and then the scripture
[1:24:31] comes and says
[1:24:32] if that same spirit that deals that that
[1:24:34] that that raised jesus up from the dead
[1:24:37] dwells in you will do the same thing so
[1:24:39] in our day we have a message of
[1:24:41] resurrection power
[1:24:46] but we got a prophet hallelujah listen
[1:24:48] church i want you to catch this
[1:24:50] we had a prophet that manifests a
[1:24:52] message in our day hallelujah
[1:24:54] to tell us hallelujah we got everything
[1:24:56] that all the mother churches had
[1:24:58] we got faith we got sanctification we
[1:25:01] got gifts
[1:25:02] and we're going to make a rapture happen
[1:25:09] what does that sound like brother jason
[1:25:11] don't that sound like a super church
[1:25:14] huh dude that sounds like a super church
[1:25:19] see we're looking at it as oh oh
[1:25:21] manifestations of
[1:25:22] natural things no it's a manifestation
[1:25:25] of a life
[1:25:27] that's what make it super remember he
[1:25:29] called jesus the super son
[1:25:31] why was he a super son by his life
[1:25:35] remember he could easily cast satan down
[1:25:39] but he said it is written
[1:25:42] and he just lived in front of him
[1:25:45] hallelujah oh my
[1:25:51] he said manifest the promise of the hour
[1:25:52] when it fell upon jesus manifest
[1:25:54] the promise of that hour 88
[1:25:57] he says it's the holy spirit
[1:26:01] coming down to quicken make alive those
[1:26:04] people
[1:26:06] that's for ordained of god to be
[1:26:09] in the rapture
[1:26:16] the sole reason why a prophet came
[1:26:21] it's because of us
[1:26:24] he had to send a word hallelujah
[1:26:28] that would quicken us so we could take
[1:26:31] our rightful spot
[1:26:33] in god's mind god didn't see any of us
[1:26:37] lost hallelujah
[1:26:38] if he for ordained us to be with him
[1:26:41] sitting in heaven
[1:26:42] he had to send a word that could wake us
[1:26:44] up
[1:26:47] wow that's why that's why i don't get
[1:26:50] into all those debates of
[1:26:52] you know the prophet he made mistakes
[1:26:53] and didn't get a bear and all that stuff
[1:26:55] and i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna be
[1:26:57] honest i'm gonna be very very
[1:26:58] transparent right now
[1:27:00] you know did he get a beard to go to
[1:27:01] india and all the stuff look
[1:27:04] i'm gonna say this as nice as i can as
[1:27:05] simple as i can
[1:27:07] i don't care
[1:27:11] what the bear got to do with me what a
[1:27:14] trip that india got to do with me
[1:27:16] his whole job was to introduce jesus
[1:27:20] hallelujah now if you got jesus you got
[1:27:23] the earnest
[1:27:25] who cares about a bear who cares about a
[1:27:28] trip to india
[1:27:29] jamaica or wherever else they say he
[1:27:30] supposed to go who cares about
[1:27:32] some old dirty rotten plane sitting up
[1:27:35] in the mountains who cares
[1:27:38] it was all about the meeting with you in
[1:27:40] christ
[1:27:42] and that prophet hallelujah the word
[1:27:45] quickened you enough
[1:27:46] to be able to see christ in your day his
[1:27:49] job is done with you
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:54] i ain't looking for him to do nothing
[1:27:56] else because it wouldn't be scriptural
[1:28:03] his whole purpose was to come and turn
[1:28:05] my heart back to the faith of the
[1:28:06] fathers
[1:28:08] now you go every time elijah the spirit
[1:28:10] of elijah came
[1:28:11] there was a turning point every time he
[1:28:15] came there was a turning hallelujah
[1:28:17] remember when elijah was standing there
[1:28:20] hallelujah
[1:28:21] with the prophets of baal hallelujah he
[1:28:23] said lord
[1:28:24] so that their hearts may be turned back
[1:28:26] let the fire come
[1:28:30] hallelujah every time
[1:28:33] god comes and identifies himself by fire
[1:28:37] in your heart he's burning out
[1:28:39] everything else that you don't need
[1:28:45] you know it's it's church let's grow up
[1:28:49] this ain't the time to be debating
[1:28:50] whether brother brennan was a prophet or
[1:28:52] not
[1:28:54] it's done it's over
[1:28:58] if you heard a word holy that
[1:29:01] quickened you that gave you life they
[1:29:03] had to be a prophet
[1:29:04] right hallelujah because the word of god
[1:29:08] comes to a prophet first
[1:29:10] then up did that same word of god comes
[1:29:12] to the believer hallelujah
[1:29:14] so it's not the prophet coming to you is
[1:29:16] god coming to you
[1:29:19] amen and that's what they doing that's
[1:29:21] what the devil does
[1:29:22] the devil always wants to put it on
[1:29:23] flesh you know brother branham said
[1:29:26] brother brown
[1:29:26] brother brother branham
[1:29:31] and you know what's so special about us
[1:29:34] besides maybe
[1:29:35] some some of us harley but jason's kind
[1:29:38] of privileged
[1:29:39] he's been there in the tabernacle as a
[1:29:41] little boy right
[1:29:42] holly i ain't never been there to this
[1:29:45] day
[1:29:46] and being in jeffersonville everything
[1:29:47] just kept on i just ain't really had no
[1:29:49] big desire
[1:29:50] because those things don't excite me
[1:29:52] what excites me is that my name is
[1:29:54] written in heaven
[1:29:58] i've been to sabino kane going up the
[1:30:00] mountain to my who the anointing and all
[1:30:02] the stuff only thing i felt is heat and
[1:30:04] sweat

[1:30:10] he the boy brother still say me too
[1:30:12] brother i've been to the cave all i got
[1:30:13] is a dirty shirt
[1:30:17] what's your expectation of this life
[1:30:19] that god has given you
[1:30:20] it ain't just for the relics of a
[1:30:22] prophet it's for that life remember what
[1:30:24] elisha said
[1:30:25] he said i want a double portion of your
[1:30:27] spirit
[1:30:28] i don't want i don't want just the
[1:30:30] miracles you did the relics of your life
[1:30:32] he said i want that god you got amen
[1:30:37] and you know what we get to heaven you
[1:30:39] know what me and brother brother go
[1:30:40] fellowship about
[1:30:41] our god i ain't gonna talk to him about
[1:30:45] like the caribou and all these things
[1:30:47] i'm talking to brother biscuit about
[1:30:48] that
[1:30:54] what's the attraction on the mountain i
[1:30:55] told the brother brady about that
[1:30:59] but when we get on the other side we're
[1:31:01] going to talk about what he did for us
[1:31:05] we're going to talk about what it means
[1:31:07] to be redeemed
[1:31:08] i am redeemed by all with the pride
[1:31:14] jesus
[1:31:17] hey man we gonna be up there talking
[1:31:19] about squirrels
[1:31:21] we're gonna be talking about only when
[1:31:22] you shot the lion and all no
[1:31:26] we're gonna be talking about that
[1:31:27] quickening power that got us here
[1:31:31] and i know some people get offended
[1:31:32] because you take it away from the
[1:31:34] private no i ain't
[1:31:35] right but jason you know what i say i
[1:31:39] say if the prophet was here
[1:31:40] some of these these radical believers
[1:31:42] they out quote him with his own quotes
[1:31:47] he comes well brother i didn't i didn't
[1:31:48] mean it like that was what i mean no but
[1:31:50] you said over here
[1:31:52] on this page
[1:31:56] that's what's going on right now we show
[1:31:59] people direct quotes
[1:32:00] of the prophets showing what they
[1:32:02] believe is wrong and they still won't
[1:32:03] receive it
[1:32:06] you know why because they're born to
[1:32:09] manifest another life
[1:32:11] but like i say kiara when i be at the
[1:32:13] gym if somebody ain't working out like
[1:32:14] they're supposed to i say coach
[1:32:16] i'm just minding my business
[1:32:20] i'm gonna keep on working out i'm just
[1:32:21] minding my business if you won't teach
[1:32:23] yourself you go ahead and cheat yourself
[1:32:24] but i ain't cheating myself
[1:32:26] i came here to sweat hallelujah like one
[1:32:28] of my one
[1:32:29] one of one of my friends in there a
[1:32:30] female hallelujah she be working out
[1:32:32] hallelujah she take a picture hallelujah
[1:32:34] and i like this little slogan huh
[1:32:36] it may be kind of congo but i like it
[1:32:38] she take the picture all of us be all
[1:32:39] sweaty and everything's taking picture
[1:32:41] and she put on the caption sweat like a
[1:32:44] pig
[1:32:45] but look like a fox
[1:32:52] oh yeah cause there's something you're
[1:32:54] gaining by all the things you're going
[1:32:56] through
[1:32:57] i know some of that somebody i know that
[1:32:59] through some of y'all for a loop
[1:33:02] hallelujah oh my let me keep reading
[1:33:05] what time we got with tommy
[1:33:07] oh my where we at where we at
[1:33:12] no i'm looking for the time it was
[1:33:14] o'clock ready
[1:33:21] that's one of the hidden clouds right
[1:33:22] here i don't know what kind of clock
[1:33:24] this is
[1:33:24] one of the mystery clocks
[1:33:28] okay all right all right listen
[1:33:31] um you didn't give me 92.
[1:33:34] listen he says but he that understand
[1:33:38] that he have
[1:33:39] known his place in this hour
[1:33:43] if you got understanding you know your
[1:33:45] place in this hour
[1:33:46] there's nothing that any of these
[1:33:48] unbelievers can say hello
[1:33:50] that will take you off your stand holy
[1:33:53] because why
[1:33:54] it's a personal experience and that's
[1:33:57] what people have been lacking holly
[1:33:59] they've been lacking a personal
[1:34:01] experience so they want to blame it on
[1:34:03] the preacher
[1:34:03] they want to bring on brother bradley he
[1:34:05] preached he had a hole in his shirt
[1:34:06] all kind of stuff and about the bridge
[1:34:08] and who cares about a bridge
[1:34:15] i thought some of y'all looking at me
[1:34:17] like bro really the prophet said that
[1:34:21] but notice i'm not making
[1:34:24] light of those things but you think i'm
[1:34:27] gonna base my salvation on whether a
[1:34:29] bridge fell or not
[1:34:32] huh hey base my salvation on that
[1:34:36] i'll base my salvation on the grave
[1:34:38] being empty right
[1:34:41] amen hallelujah holy
[1:34:45] hold my church
[1:34:48] and and i'm i'm gonna blow y'all away
[1:34:50] right quick
[1:34:51] i know a brother i ain't gonna call this
[1:34:53] thing i know a brother who said his
[1:34:55] sister was a nurse to an elderly lady
[1:34:58] up in jeff and she was like her 90s or
[1:35:01] whatever
[1:35:02] and she asked this elderly lady did that
[1:35:05] ever happen and she says yeah baby that
[1:35:07] happened back in the day
[1:35:08] and this brother preached that all over
[1:35:10] the world and now he say he don't
[1:35:11] believe it
[1:35:16] that's why you can't base your salvation
[1:35:18] on things you heard
[1:35:19] it has to be a god-given understanding
[1:35:26] because somebody built the bridge and
[1:35:28] somebody can tear the bridge down
[1:35:31] but if nobody gave you this christ
[1:35:33] nobody can take this christ
[1:35:41] boy bro jakes i know some people didn't
[1:35:42] cut me off online
[1:35:45] we'll see how they end up
[1:35:48] oh my church i'm just surrealist amen
[1:35:52] hallelujah this he said but he that
[1:35:55] that he knoweth and i'm not making light
[1:35:57] of the things in the prophet's life
[1:35:58] i believe holy all the things that he
[1:36:01] say happened happen
[1:36:03] i'm not here to reason any of that i'm
[1:36:06] here to put the silence hallelujah
[1:36:08] those who try to make me believe is not
[1:36:12] amen and that's why i say i don't care
[1:36:15] what you got to say about it
[1:36:17] hallelujah because i'm not basing my
[1:36:19] salvation on any of that
[1:36:22] i'm basing my salvation on what that
[1:36:24] word the prophet did
[1:36:25] preach did in my life
[1:36:29] amen can i get an amen church that's
[1:36:32] what we're living by
[1:36:33] because you remember when he went beyond
[1:36:35] the curtain of time he said i preached
[1:36:36] what paul preached and everybody said
[1:36:39] we're resting on that right
[1:36:42] he didn't say i gave a vision hill or
[1:36:44] caribou or bear and all these things
[1:36:46] he said no i preach what paul preached
[1:36:48] and if paul group is here
[1:36:50] my group gonna be here how it's a
[1:36:52] revelation
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:57] i'm sorry y'all i'm trying to quit but i
[1:37:00] love a church that can pull
[1:37:02] hallelujah listen he says he that
[1:37:05] heareth my word
[1:37:06] and believe on him that sent me
[1:37:09] present tense eternal life shall not
[1:37:12] come into the judgment
[1:37:13] but has already passed from death unto
[1:37:15] life then when this
[1:37:17] new eternal life dwells in you somebody
[1:37:20] say amen
[1:37:21] it is the potential or the earnest
[1:37:24] hallelujah
[1:37:25] of you being quickened from mortal to
[1:37:28] immortality
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:31] whoa the holy ghost is my earnest
[1:37:37] now you know what earnest money is when

[1:37:41] piece of property to show them people

[1:38:08] we
[1:38:09] got a spot in heaven
[1:38:12] it's a part of the contract he was
[1:38:14] serious about
[1:38:16] you
[1:38:19] he said the holy ghost hallelujah is the
[1:38:22] earliest of you being quickened from
[1:38:24] mortal
[1:38:25] to immortality now i'm here to shock you
[1:38:28] because i got the holy ghost that means

[1:38:37] rejoice
[1:38:39] you mean i'm the only one who got a
[1:38:40] little ache or a little pain in his body
[1:38:43] holy but my holy ghost overrides that
[1:38:50] remember he said if you want a acorn

[1:39:36] it looked like hallelujah that the tree
[1:39:38] is not growing but it's growing it's
[1:39:40] growing through the wet season
[1:39:41] it's going through the dry season he's
[1:39:43] even growing with scars in his life
[1:39:50] hallelujah he says
[1:39:53] no tree just comes up overnight it's got
[1:39:56] to grow
[1:39:57] as we grow hallelujah as we grow in the
[1:40:00] grace and
[1:40:01] knowledge of god hallelujah listen

[1:43:24] you're hearing something that can
[1:43:26] quicken you
[1:43:28] through all your trials through all your
[1:43:30] mistakes the devil may have told you
[1:43:32] you're going to turn out to be nothing
[1:43:33] god said uh
[1:43:35] i see you sitting in church
[1:43:39] hallelujah
[1:43:42] hallelujah
[1:43:45] oh my let me come on down
[1:43:49] listen i want to kiss the back end of
[1:43:51] this quote
[1:43:53] and i'm gonna close no i'm gonna read
[1:43:54] the whole quote i'm gonna close listen
[1:43:57] this is uh adoption 1960.
[1:44:01] he said inside of that was the
[1:44:02] attributes which meant that he was
[1:44:06] inside of his great lli elohim
[1:44:10] was the attribute of or
[1:44:13] you know what an attribute is or let me
[1:44:17] say it like this
[1:44:18] was a nature think about that church
[1:44:23] if we um now this this ain't no skin
[1:44:26] milk now
[1:44:28] this vitamin d is real
[1:44:31] milk you got a weak stomach you're gonna
[1:44:33] make it bubble
[1:44:37] listen he said that his
[1:44:40] attributes are the nature of god
[1:44:45] so if we are his attributes who are we
[1:44:48] we are his very own nature
[1:44:53] that's why when you go back and you read
[1:44:54] about hallelujah the virtues
[1:44:57] he said if these things be in you and
[1:44:59] abound you will
[1:45:00] never fail that's why i called it a
[1:45:04] silly hallelujah
[1:45:06] hallelujah oh my why it's the nature of
[1:45:10] god
[1:45:10] show me in the bible where god's nature
[1:45:12] ever failed
[1:45:15] you know they came up they came up to
[1:45:16] god they looked like they had accusation
[1:45:18] against him
[1:45:18] they said we caught this woman in
[1:45:20] adultery she was an adultery no she was
[1:45:22] in it this and that
[1:45:23] jesus just kept writing see his nature
[1:45:25] wasn't too accused
[1:45:27] but his nature was to always find grace
[1:45:32] and even more grace she did it yes she
[1:45:35] did it
[1:45:36] but he wasn't going to get those
[1:45:37] accusers of satisfaction
[1:45:42] he said daughter where are your accusers
[1:45:45] first let's deal with them he said if
[1:45:47] you be if any of you be without sin
[1:45:49] and you know some of them were some big
[1:45:51] boys in church now there was some big
[1:45:53] boys and they came to jesus you know
[1:45:54] they probably had on their phylacteries
[1:45:56] you know there's there was sadducees and
[1:45:58] pharisees they sitting there talking to
[1:45:59] jesus
[1:45:59] you know the woman we caught her she did
[1:46:01] it i saw it she did it
[1:46:04] but what i hate about those kind of
[1:46:05] spirits they single people out
[1:46:08] why didn't they bring the man too
[1:46:13] i hate these single out spirits i always
[1:46:16] want to do believe one story
[1:46:19] god know the truth
[1:46:23] oh my i'm sorry y'all don't blame me
[1:46:26] blame the pool
[1:46:29] holiday i still see if you sitting at
[1:46:33] home watching it
[1:46:35] it's not the same effect
[1:46:40] ain't nothing like being here hearing
[1:46:43] this
[1:46:44] loud black preacher sweating ringing in
[1:46:46] your ears
[1:46:48] ain't nothing like it see what you don't
[1:46:50] see on the internet is that
[1:46:51] everybody in this room feel the same way
[1:46:53] i feel like
[1:46:54] [Applause]
[1:46:55] you don't feel that charge hallelujah
[1:46:57] the only difference is
[1:46:59] they build that hole in theirs back than
[1:47:01] i am hallelujah
[1:47:02] they feel the same way hallelujah but if
[1:47:04] they could they cut loose and we turn
[1:47:06] over some chairs in here
[1:47:08] you ain't gonna feel that on the
[1:47:10] internet
[1:47:18] can i get a witness now if you got this
[1:47:21] if you
[1:47:22] you know if you can't get here you got
[1:47:23] to stay home i ain't talking about you
[1:47:26] i'm talking about you people who just
[1:47:27] say well just another wednesday night
[1:47:29] think honey think we're going to stay
[1:47:30] home
[1:47:35] the power of decision what if jesus said
[1:47:38] that
[1:47:39] you were using me well no you didn't
[1:47:40] come with it so i think i'm going to
[1:47:42] stay home
[1:47:47] my church our example is in the
[1:47:50] scripture
[1:47:52] when those disciples got together on one
[1:47:54] accord
[1:47:55] god had no choice but to come down
[1:47:59] and that's always been his way when the
[1:48:01] people get on the same accord god
[1:48:04] has to pay attention because they got
[1:48:07] the power to make something happen
[1:48:09] you go to genesis chapter 11 where
[1:48:11] they're building the tower of babel
[1:48:12] hallelujah
[1:48:13] the bible says god came to take notice
[1:48:16] of what they was doing
[1:48:17] he said look the people have become one
[1:48:20] and there's
[1:48:20] nothing that they won't be able to do
[1:48:22] now he said so i got to stop this what
[1:48:25] were they gonna do
[1:48:26] they're gonna build a tower up to heaven
[1:48:31] he had to stop it and confound their
[1:48:33] languages
[1:48:34] because we can do it when we get
[1:48:36] together
[1:48:38] if we come here prayed up on the same
[1:48:40] accord
[1:48:41] we'll see the supernatural every time
[1:48:46] in one place the prophet of god say if
[1:48:48] we get on the same accord
[1:48:49] he said everybody be here from sickness
[1:48:52] within the next five
[1:48:58] minutes
[1:49:00] they made this good quotes to me i
[1:49:02] believe that
[1:49:04] because i believe we get on the same
[1:49:06] accord hallelujah
[1:49:08] hey man we can pray things into one
[1:49:10] another's life
[1:49:11] and it'll happen like that honey we can
[1:49:13] pray against financial depression huh
[1:49:16] we can pray against natural depression
[1:49:18] we can pray against all these other
[1:49:19] demon powers
[1:49:20] that try to upset us we can pray against
[1:49:22] stress and anxiety holy
[1:49:25] and believe us and god will hear our
[1:49:27] prayer
[1:49:28] why because if that spirit that raised
[1:49:30] up christ from the dead
[1:49:31] dwells in you it will also quicken your
[1:49:34] mortal body
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:40] joshua wasn't no different from you he
[1:49:42] just believed in the promise
[1:49:44] god told him nothing to be able to stand
[1:49:46] before you not even the son
[1:49:48] of the moon
[1:49:53] oh my listen
[1:49:56] well he said uh you know what an
[1:49:59] attribute is
[1:50:00] or let me say it like this was a nature
[1:50:03] this so little fellow will get it
[1:50:05] he said oh my he said so the little
[1:50:07] fellas again
[1:50:08] all you young people you babies
[1:50:12] this is plain enough for you to say i'm
[1:50:14] a child of god
[1:50:17] who are you talking to i'm a little baby
[1:50:22] jesus
[1:50:26] he says that's so the little fellows can
[1:50:28] get it and i'm one of the little fellas
[1:50:30] that has to get it that way inside of
[1:50:32] him was the nature
[1:50:34] to be a father but he's self-existent
[1:50:37] there ain't nothing
[1:50:38] for him to be a father by and now down
[1:50:41] inside
[1:50:41] that was something else that he was god
[1:50:44] and god is an object of worship
[1:50:46] oh my if he's an object of worship why
[1:50:49] is it so hard for us to worship when we
[1:50:51] come here
[1:50:54] that's the whole reason why we call him
[1:50:55] god we come here to worship
[1:50:58] hollywood it ain't just a song leader's
[1:51:00] job to sing songs
[1:51:01] it's your job to worship
[1:51:09] or not you need to come here saying i'm
[1:51:11] the song leader
[1:51:13] whatever he's saying i'm going to take
[1:51:15] over
[1:51:17] i'm going to say everybody bro jason i
[1:51:19] hate to say it i haven't been in some
[1:51:20] churches
[1:51:21] and they didn't provoke me to worship
[1:51:25] they sing a song about how great is our
[1:51:28] god
[1:51:28] and then they like this hungry
[1:51:32] he's our god sing with me
[1:51:38] i'm like y'all can't be single by the
[1:51:40] same god i know
[1:51:45] name above all names
[1:51:49] worthy of praise
[1:51:53] my heart will say how great
[1:51:57] is our god
[1:52:02] and don't get me started with we make a
[1:52:05] miracle worker promise keeper
[1:52:08] light in the darkness my god
[1:52:12] that is who you are
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:21] don't get me started you think you're
[1:52:22] going to sing songs like that and i'm
[1:52:24] going to sit in there and bite my nails
[1:52:25] and look down at the float
[1:52:28] i had cancer he's a wifemaker
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:34] diabetes not once but twice he's a
[1:52:37] miracle worker
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:42] that song start off saying you are here
[1:52:48] wow what is it church it's a promise to
[1:52:51] us
[1:52:51] wherever two or three believers are
[1:52:54] there will i also be in the midst
[1:53:07] he said he was god and god is an object
[1:53:09] of worship but he was self-existent
[1:53:12] eli ella elohim so there was
[1:53:15] nothing to worship him inside of that
[1:53:18] he was a savior and there was nothing
[1:53:20] lost to be saved see
[1:53:23] inside of that he was a healer but there
[1:53:26] was nothing sick
[1:53:27] to be healed or nothing nothing to be
[1:53:30] sick
[1:53:31] now do you get the picture somebody say
[1:53:34] man
[1:53:35] do you get the picture all these things
[1:53:38] were out of place because god's nature
[1:53:40] was calling for that
[1:53:43] so sickness hallelujah projected him to
[1:53:46] be a healer
[1:53:47] so he had to turn it loose
[1:53:53] oh my he said so his attributes
[1:53:57] his nature produce what is today
[1:54:03] wow the nature of god
[1:54:07] produce what we have right now
[1:54:11] the nature of god produce homosexuality
[1:54:15] running wow why
[1:54:16] because he is a deliverer
[1:54:22] his nature produced a covet ebola
[1:54:26] aids all these things why because he's a
[1:54:28] healer
[1:54:33] but where is he doing the healing
[1:54:36] through you
[1:54:40] because he said if you lay hands on
[1:54:41] anything it'll be healed
[1:54:45] catch it catch how simple that is he
[1:54:47] said just lay hands on him say pray
[1:54:52] the anointing in your life should be
[1:54:55] that the demons recognize who you are
[1:55:00] you know many times when jesus stepped
[1:55:03] in the room the demons recognized who he
[1:55:05] was he said shut up don't say nothing
[1:55:08] don't tell nobody who i am be quiet he
[1:55:11] didn't even have to pray and have to do
[1:55:12] nothing he said shut up be quiet
[1:55:14] and then demons say we know who thou are
[1:55:19] thou art the holy one of israel
[1:55:23] shut up don't tell nobody i got
[1:55:25] something to do in here be quiet
