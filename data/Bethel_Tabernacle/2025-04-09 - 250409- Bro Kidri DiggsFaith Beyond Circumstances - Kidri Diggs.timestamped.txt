[31:15] pray. Let church say, "Amen."
[31:16] Amen.
[31:17] Amen. Praise the Lord. If you um have
[31:21] your Bibles, let's turn to um Romans
[31:27] Romans chapter 12
[31:31] and um
[31:33] from there. Amen. We're going to kind of
[31:36] jump around a little bit. Romans chapter
[31:39] 12. I want to read a verse out of there.
[31:44] Um, let's just read verse three and then
[31:48] we're going to go to Matthew 14.
[31:53] Romans 12 and three.
[31:56] The Bible says, "For I say through the
[32:00] grace given unto me to every man that is
[32:03] among you, not to think of himself more
[32:06] highly than he ought to think, but to
[32:09] think soberly."
[32:12] Amen. And that's a word we don't hear
[32:13] often in church,
[32:16] but to think soberly
[32:19] according as God have dealt to every man
[32:23] the measure of faith.
[32:25] Let's go to uh Matthew
[32:28] uh chapter 14.
[32:32] Matthew 14. And I want to I want to
[32:35] start reading I believe at verse 26.
[32:38] Matthew 14 and 26.
[32:44] Matthew 14 and 26,
[32:48] the Bible. Well, let's back up. Let's
[32:49] back up. Let's back up to um so we can
[32:52] get the content. Let's back up to 22.
[32:55] Matthew 14 and 22.
[32:58] And straightway Jesus constrained his
[33:01] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[33:05] before him unto the other side while he
[33:08] sent the multitude away. And when he had
[33:12] sent the multitude away, he went up into
[33:15] a mountain apart to pray. And when the
[33:19] evening was come, he was there alone.
[33:23] But the ship was now in the midst of the
[33:26] sea, tossed with waves,
[33:30] for the wind was contrary.
[33:33] And in the fourth watch of the night,
[33:36] Jesus
[33:38] went unto them walking on the sea. Now,
[33:42] this is something. This is a phase of
[33:45] the ministry the disciples never saw
[33:47] before.
[33:48] Now, they saw him heal the sick, raise
[33:50] the dead. They saw him do miracles.
[33:53] So, miracles wasn't a thing to them. But
[33:56] now, they're seeing something that can't
[33:59] be explained. Amen.
[34:03] All right.
[34:05] It say, "But the ship was now tossed in
[34:08] the midst of the sea."
[34:10] I mean, the ship was the ship was now in
[34:14] the midst of the sea, tossed with waves,
[34:16] for the wind was contrary. And in the
[34:19] fourth watch of the night, Jesus went
[34:21] unto them walking on the walking on the
[34:23] sea. And when the disciples saw him
[34:26] walking on the sea, they were troubled,
[34:30] saying, "It is a spirit."
[34:33] And they cried out for fear. But
[34:36] straightway Jesus spake unto them,
[34:38] saying, "Be of good cheer. It is I. Be
[34:43] not afraid." And Peter answering him,
[34:46] and said, Lord, if thou bid me, come
[34:50] unto thee on the water. and he said,
[34:52] "Come."
[34:55] Amen. May the Lord have a blessed
[34:56] reading of his word. You can have your
[34:58] seats.
[35:00] And when Peter was come down out of the
[35:02] ship, he walked on the water to go to
[35:05] Jesus.
[35:07] Today, by the grace of God, I want to
[35:09] encourage your faith. But my my my
[35:12] subject tonight is faith beyond
[35:14] circumstances.
[35:16] Now, when we think of when we all have
[35:18] an idea what faith is. Amen. Amen.
[35:21] You know the prophet of God say faith is
[35:23] a revelation.
[35:25] He also said faith is the six sense.
[35:28] He also said that faith is the CEO of
[35:30] the company. Amen.
[35:32] So if we understand he says faith has
[35:34] hands on it.
[35:36] He said faith has hair on his chest.
[35:39] Hallelujah. So when he talks about
[35:41] faith, you know, like we used to say
[35:43] when we were growing up, if you were if
[35:44] you if you were say you were a football
[35:47] player or basketball player and you
[35:49] wasn't that good, we would call you a
[35:50] scrub.
[35:54] Hallelujah. And that comes from the term
[35:57] of a bush, a little scrub.
[35:59] So what we would say, if you ain't good,
[36:01] like, ah man, you ain't you ain't
[36:02] nothing but a little scrub. But when the
[36:05] prophet talked about faith, he never
[36:07] made it something small.
[36:10] He always made faith to be something
[36:13] great.
[36:14] But then he would come back and say,
[36:16] "You have it." Hallelujah.
[36:18] It's yours. It's very easy.
[36:21] But he he he when he talked about faith,
[36:23] he talked about levels of faith. Amen.
[36:27] Now when we look right here, when we
[36:29] look right here in the scripture, you
[36:32] know, there were times where Jesus came
[36:34] to the disciples and he said, "Oh, ye of
[36:36] little faith."
[36:38] You know, and then there were then there
[36:39] was times when he said, "Uh, where is
[36:41] your faith?"
[36:42] You know, he always was dealing with the
[36:44] faith of the believer. So he always
[36:48] wanted to show the church that there was
[36:50] another level. Amen.
[36:52] Amen. And what I want to talk about
[36:54] tonight, church, that the level of faith
[36:57] that you and I should be operating in
[37:01] has nothing to do with what you see.
[37:05] Hallelujah.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:07] Because what you see will hinder.
[37:09] Hallelujah. What you can believe.
[37:12] Amen.
[37:14] If you operate solely about what you
[37:16] see.
[37:17] And we know that the prophet of God say
[37:19] that God gave us five senses to contact
[37:21] this world. But then he gave us a sense,
[37:24] hallelujah,
[37:26] to contact things that are here, but we
[37:29] can't see it.
[37:33] I love that. Hallelujah. He say it's
[37:35] here, but the natural eye can't see it.
[37:38] But faith can proclaim it.
[37:40] Faith can produce it. Faith can make the
[37:43] evidence of things not seen become
[37:45] tangible.
[37:46] Hallelujah.
[37:48] So when we think about circumstances,
[37:51] when I begin to look at circumstances,
[37:53] and I and I'm not going to go into the
[37:55] full definition of it, but when I begin
[37:57] to look at the word circumstances, it
[38:00] talked about a condition detail.
[38:04] A detail condition of facts.
[38:10] Circumstances deals with facts.
[38:14] But faith doesn't care what the facts
[38:17] are. Amen.
[38:19] Hallelujah.
[38:20] We we we're not dealing with facts.
[38:23] We're dealing with truth. Amen.
[38:26] Hallelujah. So church, when it comes to
[38:28] faith and we look at circumstances of
[38:31] faith, we have to go back to Genesis.
[38:34] Amen. Now, let's go to Genesis chapter
[38:37] one
[38:39] just to look at the kind of faith God
[38:42] gave us.
[38:44] Hallelujah.
[38:47] Now, Genesis chapter one. Now, I'm I'mma
[38:50] just I'mma just breeze over the top of
[38:52] this and I pray maybe one of the
[38:54] brothers will catch the inspiration and
[38:56] make it more plain to you. But right
[38:59] now, I'm I'm I'm shooting with a 47.
[39:03] Hallelujah.
[39:05] And and and and and I'm aimed at the
[39:08] devil
[39:10] and we're not looking for any survivors.
[39:12] Hallelujah. So I want your faith to be
[39:15] anchored in him tonight. Genesis 1 27.
[39:19] Now the Bible says, "So God created man
[39:23] in his own image." Let's just stop right
[39:25] there. Man was created in the image of
[39:28] God. The God who said, "Let there be and
[39:32] it was." Everything he spoke came to
[39:34] pass. Then the scripture down in Hebrews
[39:37] say, "We understand that the worlds were
[39:39] framed how?" By the word of God. So God
[39:43] put his own faith out there to show what
[39:45] I got is the real thing.
[39:48] Hallelujah. And then he allowed man to
[39:51] be created with that same substance of
[39:54] faith
[39:55] in his image. Amen.
[39:57] He said, "So, so God created man in his
[40:00] own image." Hallelujah. In the image of
[40:03] God created he him. Male and female
[40:06] created he them. And God blessed them.
[40:08] Now look now. Hallelujah. When God
[40:11] created man, he put certain things,
[40:14] hallelujah, in place in their life.
[40:17] Amen.
[40:17] Oh my. He said, "And God blessed them
[40:21] and God said unto them, be fruitful."
[40:24] First two things, you're supposed to be
[40:26] walking in blessings and not curses.
[40:29] Hallelujah. So if any circumstances in
[40:32] your life produces anything else but
[40:34] blessings, you're not walking in the
[40:37] image that God created you in.
[40:48] Thank you, bro.
[40:51] He said when he made us in in in his
[40:53] image, he blessed man. He said, "And God
[40:57] blessed them and God said unto them, be
[40:59] fruitful." Hallelujah. We are the image
[41:02] of God is supposed to be fruitful. Amen.
[41:05] We're not just supposed to be benchwmers
[41:07] or churchgoers. Hallelujah. But when we
[41:09] speak, hallelujah, something is supposed
[41:12] to take place.
[41:14] Hallelujah. Look, church, when Adam
[41:16] talked, all creation paid attention.
[41:20] God.
[41:21] Hallelujah.
[41:23] Hey. Be fruitful and multiply and
[41:26] replenish the earth and subdue it.
[41:29] Oh my. and have dominion over the fish
[41:33] of the sea and over the fowls of the air
[41:36] and every living thing that moveth upon
[41:38] the face of the earth. So man,
[41:40] hallelujah, could operate under any
[41:43] circumstance and be a god.
[41:49] Am I in the book?
[41:52] He He was to multiply. He is blessed.
[41:56] He's to be fruitful. He's to subdue.
[42:00] Hallelujah. You know, uh, a lot of times
[42:02] they use that word subdue when you're
[42:05] going against an enemy. Hallelujah. They
[42:07] walk out there, we come to subdue the
[42:10] enemy. We come to bring him under
[42:12] control.
[42:14] Hallelujah. God created man to bring
[42:18] every situation under control.
[42:21] Hallelujah. There's nothing in your life
[42:23] that's out of control. Hallelujah.
[42:26] Unless you don't know who you are.
[42:31] Because under the image of God,
[42:34] hallelujah, Adam controlled the weather.
[42:38] He controlled the fish, the sharks, the
[42:40] whales. He controlled the lions, the
[42:43] tigers, the bears. Hallelujah. He
[42:45] controlled pet life, bartney life.
[42:47] Hallelujah. The mineral kingdom. He
[42:49] controlled everything.
[42:52] every circumstance that came his way, he
[42:55] was the controller of it.
[42:58] And that's how we were created in God's
[43:02] eyes.
[43:04] Let me help you out a little bit.
[43:11] Hallelujah.
[43:13] I'm not just talking fairy tale
[43:15] language.
[43:16] But what I'm speaking to you tonight is
[43:19] reality.
[43:21] We were created in the image of God,
[43:24] in his likeness. Hallelujah. And I don't
[43:27] know about you, but sometimes I get up
[43:28] and I say, "I'm blessed." Because that's
[43:31] what the Bible says about me.
[43:33] That's what God said about me.
[43:35] Hallelujah.
[43:37] He said, "When he created me, he blessed
[43:40] me."
[43:43] Yes, sir.
[43:44] Oh my.
[43:45] Amen.
[43:50] faith beyond circumstances.
[43:53] But look church, just to kind of make it
[43:56] a little bit more clearer.
[43:59] Now, Adam and Eve were walking
[44:02] under the dominion of God, the image of
[44:05] God. Hallelujah. They had God's own
[44:08] faith. And you know, I I I wanted to put
[44:10] this quote up, but I I I forgot. I ran
[44:12] out of time. But there's a quote in in
[44:15] in the deity of of Jesus Christ. I
[44:18] believe that's the message where the
[44:20] prophet of God says, hallelujah, the
[44:23] faith. Now, this is heavy.
[44:26] He said, well, he didn't say the faith.
[44:29] He said, the power that created the
[44:31] world is the same power in every Holy
[44:35] Ghost fil believer.
[44:46] The power that created the worlds. How
[44:50] did he create it? He said, "Let there
[44:52] be."
[44:53] Amen.
[44:53] Just spoke the word. And he said that
[44:56] same power of the spoken word is in
[45:00] every Holy Ghost fil believer. How many
[45:04] got the Holy Ghost tonight? So you got
[45:06] the same power in you that God used to
[45:09] create the world.
[45:12] Amen.
[45:15] If you're not subject to the
[45:17] circumstances of your flesh,
[45:23] but look, church, we know Adam and Eve
[45:26] fell into sin, but let's make it real
[45:28] clear. When Adam fell into sin, God
[45:32] never had to create another Adam.
[45:38] He didn't go and make another man. He
[45:41] didn't go and make another woman.
[45:42] Hallelujah. He didn't even make another
[45:45] soul.
[45:52] What did he do? He told that man, "If
[45:56] you get back, Hallelujah. in the right
[45:59] atmosphere, in the right channel,
[46:00] everything that you are will come out
[46:03] again.
[46:04] Hallelujah. So I say that to you. When
[46:07] your sins are forgiven and you know your
[46:09] sins are forgiven, you can walk in the
[46:11] places that Adam walked in.
[46:14] You can walk in dominion. You can
[46:16] replenish. You can subdue. You can
[46:17] multiply. You can control your
[46:20] environment.
[46:25] Now I'm preaching to eagles tonight.
[46:32] Notice I said I didn't say
[46:38] he said when you receive this message as
[46:40] eagle food you have what heard from your
[46:44] theophony. What is a theophony? A word
[46:47] body that comes from the presence of
[46:49] God.
[46:51] Amen.
[46:52] Oh my I feel my helper coming on. I feel
[46:54] good now. Woo! Oh my church. Look, when
[47:00] Adam fell into sin, God never had to go
[47:05] and create or make another atom and
[47:07] destroy that one.
[47:09] No. Everything that was in the seed
[47:13] would come out
[47:15] at the provided time.
[47:16] Yes, sir.
[47:17] Amen.
[47:18] Hallelujah. Oh my.
[47:22] Listen. All right.
[47:26] Let's go to uh let's read this quote.
[47:30] This is in the message, the fundamental
[47:31] foundation of faith. I love that
[47:33] message. Probably within the past six
[47:35] months, I didn't listen to it maybe 20,
[47:37] 25 times.
[47:38] Hallelujah. Because there's so many
[47:40] nuggets in it.
[47:41] That tells us who we are.
[47:43] Hallelujah. Listen, the prophet of God
[47:45] says, he says, he says, "Now, here's
[47:49] something that's wrong. And in the
[47:51] beginning, God created you to be what?
[47:54] the master of every circumstance.
[47:57] God created you to be the master of your
[48:00] circumstances. So I say to you tonight,
[48:03] if your back hurt, you are the master of
[48:05] your healing.
[48:07] Hallelujah.
[48:08] If if if your pockets are a little
[48:10] tight, you are the master of your
[48:12] riches.
[48:13] Hallelujah. If you a little depressed,
[48:15] you are the master of your happiness.
[48:18] You are the master of every
[48:19] circumstance. Hallelujah. If your
[48:21] children in the world, you are the
[48:23] master of their deliverance. You're the
[48:25] master of their hallelujah redemption.
[48:28] Amen.
[48:29] It's up to you to let your faith reach
[48:32] out beyond the circumstances of what you
[48:34] see.
[48:38] Hallelujah.
[48:40] Circumstances.
[48:43] How many of us when we have to go to
[48:45] work, if it's raining, those
[48:46] circumstances don't stop us?
[48:50] Amen.
[48:50] You can believe beyond that rain.
[48:53] Hallelujah.
[48:55] The law of rain cannot stop you from
[48:58] going forward.
[48:59] Hallelujah. And even church, sometimes
[49:02] things will happen, certain
[49:03] circumstances will happen where other
[49:05] people will feel handcuffed and you'll
[49:08] be a little happy about it.
[49:10] Hallelujah. A couple months ago, we had
[49:13] snow all over South Carolina. Some
[49:15] people like
[49:18] and your children were out there
[49:22] having a ball. Hallelujah. So don't
[49:25] worry about somebody else's
[49:27] circumstances and how they handle it.
[49:29] Worry about how you handle the
[49:31] circumstances.
[49:32] Amen. Rain may stop some people. Snow
[49:36] may stop some people. But hallelujah.
[49:39] Some people it may unlock a measure of
[49:42] faith.
[49:47] He said to everyone that's given a
[49:49] measure of faith. So I'm here to
[49:51] proclaim tonight that there is a measure
[49:54] of faith in you
[49:55] for every situation you come across.
[50:01] I ain't going to be long. Y'all know I'm
[50:02] about to close. Hallelujah.
[50:05] Oh my. Listen.
[50:07] He says God created you to be the master
[50:09] of every circumstance. He said, "That's
[50:12] the origin. That's authentic. That's
[50:15] God's word."
[50:18] That's your origin.
[50:20] Hallelujah. That's how the Bible, this
[50:23] is what he's saying is authentic. That's
[50:26] how the word of God should be being
[50:28] preached.
[50:30] Authentic. Amen.
[50:31] That's the original seed word right
[50:34] there.
[50:35] Oh my. He said that's God's word. Now
[50:39] listen. He said there was nothing
[50:41] nothing could happen unless you was the
[50:45] master of it. That's what you were
[50:48] created for.
[50:49] Amen.
[50:52] So nothing can happen to you
[50:54] except first before it gets to you,
[50:57] you're already the master of it.
[51:07] Okay. Okay. All right. All right.
[51:11] Hallelujah.
[51:12] Now, what we what I want you to
[51:14] understand what I'm preaching. I'm
[51:16] preaching perfect faith.
[51:19] Hallelujah. The prophet of God say we
[51:21] should be able to preach it a little bit
[51:23] deeper and get some of the unbelief out
[51:25] of the church.
[51:27] Hallelujah. Why would a vindicated
[51:29] prophet say that to a church?
[51:32] Because some of us have intellectual
[51:34] faith which lies on the circumstances.
[51:37] But then he said, "We got to have hard
[51:39] faith." When you believe from your
[51:41] heart, no matter what the circumstances
[51:43] is, I got God's word
[51:47] and the circumstances can't change that.
[51:49] If you sick in your body, I don't care
[51:51] what the circumstances are. I got a word
[51:53] for you. And it says by his stripes,
[51:55] you're already healed. And the
[51:57] circumstances can't stop that.
[52:04] Hallelujah.
[52:06] Oh my church. He said, I'm going to read
[52:09] that again. He said, there's nothing
[52:11] nothing could happen unless you was the
[52:14] master of it. That's what you were
[52:17] created for.
[52:20] Hallelujah. So God is trying to get our
[52:24] minds right to believe in the origin of
[52:28] who we are.
[52:29] Hallelujah. And my origin, your origin,
[52:33] doesn't make me the student, it makes me
[52:36] the master.
[52:37] Amen.
[52:40] Some of you are satisfied with being the
[52:42] student. No, I want to be the master.
[52:44] Because if I'm the master, I'm in
[52:46] control.
[52:48] If I'm the master, everything around me
[52:50] has to listen to my voice.
[52:53] Now, you need to be the master of your
[52:55] situation.
[52:56] You be the master of your circumstances.
[52:59] Hallelujah.
[53:01] But look, let's dive into it a little
[53:02] bit. Just a little bit. Hallelujah.
[53:05] Let's look at the scene.
[53:08] Now, the disciples,
[53:10] they saw Jesus do a lot of things.
[53:14] To a certain extent,
[53:17] they believe he was God.
[53:20] But the revelation of God they had was
[53:23] on earth.
[53:27] And he wanted to show them a God that
[53:30] earth couldn't explain.
[53:32] Hallelujah. He wanted to show them a
[53:34] life behind skin that circumstances
[53:37] couldn't stop.
[53:40] Hallelujah. So he told them, he said,
[53:42] "Hey, let's get it. I want y'all to get
[53:44] in the ship and go to the other side."
[53:47] He said, "And then he dealt with the
[53:49] crowd and so forth, but before we get
[53:51] there, hallelujah, he had 5,000 out
[53:54] there." In the same chapter, 5,000 out.
[53:57] They only had two fish and five loaves.
[53:59] And Jesus said, "Let's feed the people."
[54:02] He wasn't looking at the circumstances
[54:04] of how much he had.
[54:06] He knew who he was.
[54:10] The circumstances only brought out who
[54:13] he was.
[54:16] And that's what your circumstance is
[54:19] supposed to do. It's supposed to bring
[54:21] out that you are the master.
[54:24] Hallelujah.
[54:25] Amen.
[54:27] Hallelujah.
[54:30] And Jesus, he says, "Oh my." Now, I
[54:36] marvel at this because the disciples who
[54:38] were believers,
[54:40] they walked with him, but Jesus knew
[54:45] they weren't there yet.
[54:47] They saw so many mighty things and he
[54:49] knew they weren't there yet. That's why
[54:52] the prophet could preach the seals and
[54:54] then say, "I knew half of the people
[54:55] didn't understand what I preach."
[54:58] But he had to preach it. Why?
[55:00] Hallelujah. So it could be unlocked.
[55:04] The circumstances of the people hearing
[55:06] couldn't stop that word from coming
[55:08] forth.
[55:09] Amen.
[55:10] Listen
[55:12] now. They said Jesus say, "Sit the
[55:15] people down. Let's feed the people." And
[55:17] then one of the disciples come up and
[55:19] say, "Lord, master." He's looking at the
[55:21] circumstance. Lord, we ain't got
[55:24] nothing. We ain't got nothing to feed
[55:25] all these people. It's 5,000 people out
[55:27] here
[55:28] looking at the circumstances. Now, God
[55:31] didn't heal the sick, raised the dead.
[55:33] He He didn't did all kind of stuff, and
[55:35] they still looking in the natural realm.
[55:40] They still are are looking at God as
[55:44] just a God of the earth.
[55:46] Yeah.
[55:48] and they say, "Lord, we we we all we got
[55:51] is a a lad. He come and brought us five
[55:54] fish and I mean five loaves and two
[55:57] fish." Jesus said, "Give it to me.
[56:02] I'mma show you what I think of your
[56:04] circumstances. Give it to me."
[56:06] Hallelujah.
[56:07] I'mma show you what I think of your
[56:09] circumstances. Give it to me. I'mma show
[56:12] you what I think of your sickness. Give
[56:14] it to me. I'm going to show you what I
[56:16] think about the troubles in your mind.
[56:18] Give it to me. I'mma show you about
[56:20] what's going on in your house. Give it
[56:22] to me. If you ain't got a job, he said,
[56:24] "Give your job search to me."
[56:28] Hallelujah. Church, they give it to
[56:31] Jesus. Jesus bless it. Hallelujah. And
[56:34] then what does he do? He gives it to the
[56:36] disciples.
[56:38] Amen.
[56:38] So where was the multiplying of the fish
[56:41] and the bread?
[56:43] As they trust in the Lord, when he gave
[56:46] it to them, the blessing from their
[56:49] hands were multiplied unto whom all they
[56:51] would give.
[56:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Notice it didn't
[56:58] go straight from God to the people, but
[57:00] it came from God to the disciples.
[57:03] Then the disciples took what God gave
[57:05] them and let him use it. Hallelujah.
[57:10] Take what God has given you and let God
[57:12] use it. He's already blessed it.
[57:16] He's already blessed your hands. Let God
[57:19] use it.
[57:22] Now they feed 5,000 and I believe they
[57:25] took up 12 basket after that.
[57:29] Man, what happened to the circumstances?
[57:35] washed up. The circumstances were washed
[57:38] up
[57:39] in the actions of God.
[57:42] Hallelujah.
[57:44] But now later on in the chapter, Jesus,
[57:47] hey, y'all go to the other side. I'm
[57:48] going up here to pray. He pushed the
[57:50] crowd away. Jesus, go pray. And next
[57:53] thing you know, the Bible says, now the
[57:56] ship is being tossed.
[57:58] It's being tossed and the wind and all
[58:00] these things is is in a storm. Y'all
[58:04] think Jesus didn't know that the storm
[58:05] was coming?
[58:09] That's the reason why he didn't go with
[58:11] them.
[58:13] Cuz he wanted to see what they would do
[58:15] in the storm of their life.
[58:18] And sometimes you may not feel like God
[58:21] is with you. He's trying to see what you
[58:23] will do in your storm.
[58:28] Hallelujah. Even the other time when
[58:30] they were out in the boat. Hallelujah.
[58:32] The Bible says that the winds were
[58:34] blowing so much to that water was in the
[58:37] boat. Now,
[58:38] waters in the boat. And the Bible says
[58:41] Jesus was in the back of the boat sleep.
[58:43] Hallelujah. He wasn't thinking about the
[58:45] conditions.
[58:46] He wasn't thinking about the
[58:48] circumstances. He's a God of what? Rest.
[58:52] So no matter what you're going through,
[58:54] God always has rest for you.
[58:57] Amen.
[58:58] Amen. Amen.
[58:59] In our church, oh,
[59:02] think about it. Anybody ever been DC
[59:03] fishing?
[59:05] Couple of us. Amen. You get out there in
[59:08] that water
[59:09] and the winds are going and waves are
[59:11] going and all these things and now it's
[59:14] coming in the boat and they
[59:19] I guarantee you what nobody nobody in
[59:21] that boat was saying. I got God in me.
[59:25] The Lord is with me. We got a third
[59:27] pulled ministry.
[59:31] No, they were looking at the
[59:32] circumstances
[59:33] and they were thinking about I guarantee
[59:36] you they were thinking about their life,
[59:38] their soul, whether they need to repent,
[59:39] whatever because of a storm. And
[59:42] sometimes God would allow storms so you
[59:44] can stop playing games with him.
[59:49] Hallelujah. So look, storm coming,
[59:52] everything is in the boat and not Jesus.
[59:55] They Peter go back and say, "Lord, Lord,
[59:57] you care that you don't care that we
[59:58] perish. He's the father of life."
[1:00:02] They've never seen anything around him
[1:00:04] die. So where were those thoughts coming
[1:00:06] from?
[1:00:07] Where were the thoughts of death coming
[1:00:09] from? It wasn't coming from God.
[1:00:13] It was the circumstances that was
[1:00:15] bringing forth contrary thoughts.
[1:00:18] Amen.
[1:00:22] Thoughts of unbelief.
[1:00:24] while they were in God's presence.
[1:00:28] How often God, we come to church and the
[1:00:31] word is being preached and we have
[1:00:32] thoughts of unbelief while we're in
[1:00:34] God's presence.
[1:00:38] We're too busy dwelling on the
[1:00:39] circumstances.
[1:00:43] Yeah. The fact of the matter was water
[1:00:46] was in the boat, but that didn't change
[1:00:48] who Jesus was.
[1:00:51] Amen.
[1:00:52] But he and and I found this part very
[1:00:54] funny.
[1:00:56] Jesus gets up,
[1:00:59] walks to the front of the boat,
[1:01:03] and he's not shaking one bit.
[1:01:09] Now, the Bible don't say this, but I
[1:01:11] believe when he put his foot up, the
[1:01:14] whole boat stopped shaking
[1:01:19] cuz he was God.
[1:01:22] How's the devil going to shake up his
[1:01:24] own makeup?
[1:01:29] Let's understand something. Whenever you
[1:01:32] going through something, God is never
[1:01:34] worried.
[1:01:35] Amen.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:37] He's trying to unlock something that he
[1:01:39] know is there.
[1:01:41] Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] And I've been saying just talking about
[1:01:44] faith a little bit where we say, "Lord,
[1:01:46] give me more faith. I don't have enough
[1:01:47] faith. Lord, please give me some more
[1:01:48] faith." He can't do it.
[1:01:52] God can't give you more faith. That
[1:01:55] means when he created you, he was un you
[1:01:58] were unfinished.
[1:02:01] But think about it. You go through a
[1:02:02] hard trial, then God said, "Oh, I forgot
[1:02:05] to add some patience.
[1:02:09] Let me put some patience in it."
[1:02:11] You go through a hard trial with a
[1:02:13] brother, sister here, and you get angry.
[1:02:15] God say, "Oh, I forgot to put some love
[1:02:16] in Chris.
[1:02:21] That mean he wasn't God.
[1:02:23] Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] And I've been saying it like this.
[1:02:26] Hallelujah. You take a farmer. Forgive
[1:02:30] me camera people. Y'all know I'm a
[1:02:31] walker. Y'all should be used to this by
[1:02:33] now.
[1:02:34] You know they making them they making
[1:02:35] them kind of cameras now. They just
[1:02:37] rotate when you move. Hallelujah.
[1:02:39] I need one of them.
[1:02:42] Look church, you take a farmer just to
[1:02:45] show that God doesn't have to add
[1:02:48] anything to you.
[1:02:49] You take a farmer who who wants Gayla
[1:02:53] red apples. So what does he do? He finds
[1:02:56] a seed and he plants Gayla red apples.
[1:03:00] Now when that apple starts to grow,
[1:03:02] hallelujah, he doesn't have to go to
[1:03:04] each apple with some red 40.
[1:03:10] He doesn't have to go to each each apple
[1:03:12] or put it in a sprinkler and spray some
[1:03:15] red 40 over the whole harvest so he can
[1:03:18] get red apples. Where does the color
[1:03:20] come from? It's already in the seed.
[1:03:26] And as the sun does its job by faith.
[1:03:30] Hallelujah. The farmer doesn't dig it
[1:03:32] up. He knows what the seed is supposed
[1:03:34] to produce. So he depends on the
[1:03:37] elements around it to unlock the life
[1:03:39] that's inside.
[1:03:41] So he lets the sun do its job.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah. And he lets the rain do its
[1:03:47] job. He even lets the dirt
[1:03:52] do its job.
[1:03:54] Sometimes you feel a little embarrassed.
[1:03:55] You do something wrong like, "Oh my
[1:03:57] gosh, I don't know why I did that. Oh, I
[1:04:00] just feel so convicted."
[1:04:03] We all have had a little dirt,
[1:04:06] but it's that dirt that helps the real
[1:04:09] you come out.
[1:04:13] Woo! Hallelujah. It ain't It ain't per
[1:04:16] se the contact of the sun first. No, it
[1:04:19] ain't per se the contact of the water
[1:04:22] first. No, it's the dirt, the darkness
[1:04:24] of the dirt that compacts that seed.
[1:04:27] Hallelujah. And dries it out. Amen.
[1:04:30] Where the real life that's inside can
[1:04:33] come out. So that situation is needed to
[1:04:36] unlock another level of life.
[1:04:39] So there are situations of dirt in our
[1:04:41] life that God allows us to go through to
[1:04:44] unlock another level of life.
[1:04:50] Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] I almost feel like we at a camp meeting.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] But look, that farmer,
[1:05:04] he trusts
[1:05:05] what's in the seed.
[1:05:08] He doesn't come back and add anything to
[1:05:09] it. What if what if he say, "Man, I want
[1:05:11] I want these apples to be juicy."
[1:05:16] What does he do? He come back and get
[1:05:18] some some some some some herbs of juicy.
[1:05:24] Get some herb I need juicy apples. Let
[1:05:26] me go find some herbs of juicy.
[1:05:30] Put it in the sprinklers and spray it
[1:05:31] over the whole harvest and all the
[1:05:34] apples come out juicy.
[1:05:37] No, it's already in there.
[1:05:41] Hallelujah. What if he wants some sweet
[1:05:44] some sweet red apples? They come back
[1:05:46] and say, "Man, let me find me some
[1:05:48] herbs, some of sweetener. Let me add in
[1:05:51] some some equal."
[1:05:55] No. And for those of you who fighting
[1:05:58] these this old age some what it is. What
[1:06:02] is it called?
[1:06:04] What is it?
[1:06:05] Stevia. For all y'all I can't I ain't
[1:06:08] eat no sugar. You know that sugar so
[1:06:10] bad. But give me some ski.
[1:06:16] Control your health.
[1:06:20] N ain't telling everybody go eat snooker
[1:06:22] balls. No, that's not what I'm saying.
[1:06:25] What I'm saying is don't let the
[1:06:27] circumstances move you to be something
[1:06:29] that God didn't create you to be.
[1:06:31] And God didn't create any of us to be
[1:06:34] afraid. That's not in the image of God.
[1:06:37] That's look as as as we read the patent
[1:06:40] of man. Hallelujah. Fear is no way in
[1:06:43] that patent.
[1:06:47] So where is fear coming from? Your eyes.
[1:06:51] Amen.
[1:06:52] Oh my. Look.
[1:06:55] Jesus gets everybody all right.
[1:06:58] Don't get too nervous. Jesus gets to the
[1:07:01] the front of the boat and he says,
[1:07:03] "Peace be still." He didn't call it
[1:07:06] hurricane.
[1:07:08] He didn't call it tornado. He didn't
[1:07:10] call it tsunami. He called it what he
[1:07:13] created it to be. Peace.
[1:07:19] Is that really really brother Diggs? How
[1:07:21] many of you ever been on a hot day in
[1:07:23] Buford? Hot day in Buford where
[1:07:25] mosquitoes are buzzing and and and the
[1:07:28] humidity is 100% and then a breeze come.
[1:07:34] Don't that make you feel good?
[1:07:39] So the wind was never created to be your
[1:07:44] enemy.
[1:07:47] Amen.
[1:07:49] That's why when Jesus spoke to it, he
[1:07:51] spoke it in original condition. Peace.
[1:07:56] Amen.
[1:08:00] Oh my.
[1:08:01] Hallelujah.
[1:08:06] And then he he puts his foot up there
[1:08:07] and this is this is me. He put his foot
[1:08:09] up there and say, "Peace be still." And
[1:08:10] then the disciples look at say, "Wow,
[1:08:16] what manner of man is this where the
[1:08:19] winds and the sea obey him?"
[1:08:22] Wow.
[1:08:25] And then Jesus say,
[1:08:29] "Where's your faith?"
[1:08:32] You supposed to calm the storm.
[1:08:35] Talking about something wild. I don't
[1:08:36] want to hear no wild.
[1:08:39] Where's your faith? You supposed to
[1:08:42] speak to this situation.
[1:08:44] And you know what? Like us,
[1:08:49] we'll receive a rebuke from God because
[1:08:51] of where we are spiritually.
[1:08:53] Amen.
[1:08:54] But then we start blaming the conditions
[1:08:57] or the the circumstances. Now you look
[1:09:00] at these disciples. Jesus saying,
[1:09:01] "Where's your faith?" They like, "Huh,
[1:09:03] man? You see all this water in this
[1:09:05] boat?
[1:09:07] All this water in the boat. the the the
[1:09:09] the the what what you call the thing the
[1:09:11] life bags what they call
[1:09:13] life vest man the life vest has been
[1:09:16] gone and you want us to speak to
[1:09:18] something
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:24] that's how we talk to God sometimes
[1:09:27] he's telling us what we are supposed to
[1:09:30] do and we reminded him of the
[1:09:32] circumstances
[1:09:34] but he didn't care about those
[1:09:36] circumstances he said where's your faith
[1:09:38] faith.
[1:09:40] Hallelujah. He put them Oh my. He put
[1:09:42] them in a storm to show them that they
[1:09:45] could calm the storm.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] Amen.
[1:09:50] And now over here on the other side.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] They out in the midst of the storm. The
[1:09:56] boat is being tossed and everything. And
[1:09:58] and and Jesus come walking. Hallelujah.
[1:10:01] He going to walking on the water.
[1:10:02] Something they've never seen before. A
[1:10:05] whole another level of faith.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah. Jesus come walking on the
[1:10:09] water and then looking at Hallelujah. A
[1:10:13] man walking on the water and they say
[1:10:17] it's a spirit.
[1:10:22] How often JD things happen in our life
[1:10:25] and we say this ain't nothing but the
[1:10:26] devil.
[1:10:29] How often we do that? Certain things
[1:10:32] happen with this the devil. things
[1:10:34] happen in house. This the devil lose
[1:10:36] your job. This the devil, brother Jason,
[1:10:39] get up and preach on you. Heat up.
[1:10:48] You better not say it.
[1:10:52] But we look at things a lot of times, a
[1:10:55] lot of times because of the
[1:10:56] circumstances and we give the enemy the
[1:10:59] credit versus God
[1:11:01] when it could be God trying to unlock
[1:11:03] another level of life that's already
[1:11:05] laying inside of you. But it'll take
[1:11:07] this situation to bring out who you are
[1:11:13] it wasn't the devil hallelujah that was
[1:11:15] that was making Pharaoh's heart hard. It
[1:11:18] was God.
[1:11:22] It wasn't even the devil that led Rahab
[1:11:25] into prostitution. It was God.
[1:11:32] Hallelujah.
[1:11:33] You say, "Really, brother D?" Yes. She
[1:11:35] had to be there
[1:11:36] and she had to be raised there. She had
[1:11:39] to go through something. She had to
[1:11:40] spend at least for Oh my
[1:11:43] Oh my. She had to mature and grow up
[1:11:45] there. Why? Because if the children of
[1:11:47] Israel would have got there in five to
[1:11:49] seven days like it was supposed to take,
[1:11:52] hallelujah, Rahab wouldn't have been
[1:11:54] there.
[1:11:56] So God allowed circumstances to take
[1:11:58] place. He allowed people to rise up in
[1:12:00] church. H he allowed the golden calf,
[1:12:03] all these things. Why? So Rahab can get
[1:12:06] in position.
[1:12:06] Wow.
[1:12:07] Amen.
[1:12:08] Amen.
[1:12:10] And God would allow things in your life
[1:12:13] to linger just so you can get in
[1:12:16] position.
[1:12:17] Praise God.
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:19] Hallelujah. But what we do too often, we
[1:12:22] look at a certain man, God, God, Lord,
[1:12:25] this doesn't
[1:12:27] just can't help me.
[1:12:32] God is not concerned about the
[1:12:33] circumstances.
[1:12:34] He's trying to show you that you are the
[1:12:36] master.
[1:12:38] Nothing can happen. Remember the quote I
[1:12:40] just read. He said, "Nothing can happen
[1:12:43] except first you were already the
[1:12:45] master."
[1:12:46] Amen.
[1:12:47] Amen.
[1:12:48] Anybody going through something?
[1:12:52] What is he doing? He's unlocking the
[1:12:55] life that he knows inside of you.
[1:12:59] So, he allows trial after trial to
[1:13:01] unlock more faith. Trial after trial to
[1:13:04] unlock more faith. No, he's not giving
[1:13:07] it to you. He's unlocking what he's
[1:13:09] placed in your seed. And it takes
[1:13:11] situations and circumstances to bring it
[1:13:13] out. Abraham, hallelujah, had to lose
[1:13:16] Lot to go down there to to learn he
[1:13:19] don't need an old army. All he need is
[1:13:21] God and 318 servants. And he went down
[1:13:24] there and whipped up on some kings.
[1:13:29] Hallelujah. God allowed Joshua to get in
[1:13:33] a battle where the sun was going down.
[1:13:35] Hallelujah. Just so he could speak to
[1:13:38] the son.
[1:13:40] The very thing he was losing, God
[1:13:42] allowed him to speak to it so it'll
[1:13:44] stand still.
[1:13:47] What about you?
[1:13:48] Come on.
[1:13:49] Amen.
[1:13:49] What about us?
[1:13:51] Hallelujah.
[1:13:53] Listen, church, let me read something to
[1:13:55] you.
[1:13:57] You know, I I I I think about Abraham,
[1:14:01] and the Bible says, let's go. Let's go
[1:14:03] to uh Romans chapter 4.
[1:14:06] I want to read a little bit of this if
[1:14:08] you don't mind.
[1:14:13] Romans
[1:14:14] chapter 4.
[1:14:21] Now listen, the Bible says in verse 17,
[1:14:24] Romans 4:17,
[1:14:27] it says, "As it is written, I have made
[1:14:29] thee a father of many nations before him
[1:14:33] whom he believed, even God, who
[1:14:35] quickenth the dead, and calleth those
[1:14:38] things which be not as though they are
[1:14:42] or as though they were already taken
[1:14:45] place,
[1:14:46] were came to pass. It already didn't
[1:14:49] happen in God's eyes. Let me tell you
[1:14:51] something, church. In God's eyes, we've
[1:14:54] already made a rapture.
[1:14:58] In God's eyes, we're already perfected.
[1:15:01] Amen.
[1:15:02] Listen, don't put your faith based upon
[1:15:05] what somebody else has done to call it
[1:15:07] perfect. Look, I don't need to speak
[1:15:10] squirrels. I don't have a need for
[1:15:11] squirrels.
[1:15:13] Hallelujah. So, those circumstances may
[1:15:15] not apply to my life.
[1:15:17] Hallelujah. But if God put me in a
[1:15:19] certain situation where I need something
[1:15:21] else, the same power that the prophet
[1:15:23] used to speak squirrels is the same
[1:15:25] power that he have in me to speak what I
[1:15:28] need.
[1:15:30] Yes, sir.
[1:15:31] Or what you need. So the third pull is
[1:15:35] not based upon only squirrels and
[1:15:38] caribous and silver tipsmen,
[1:15:41] but it's based upon the need of the
[1:15:43] believer.
[1:15:46] Amen.
[1:15:49] Hallelujah. How many of you need a
[1:15:51] silver tip? Anybody?
[1:15:57] Anybody need a caribou? Don't raise your
[1:15:58] hand, Tony.
[1:16:02] I take one right now. I have a big old
[1:16:04] 42 inch horn just like he said. Give it
[1:16:07] to me.
[1:16:10] But it's according to the situations in
[1:16:12] your life, the circumstances. God allow
[1:16:14] us to come into certain circumstances to
[1:16:17] unlock the level of faith that's already
[1:16:19] there.
[1:16:21] Hallelujah. That's why y'all hear me
[1:16:23] say, "I thank God for cancer."
[1:16:29] Cuz without cancer in my brain, he
[1:16:32] couldn't unlock the revelation of
[1:16:34] Jehovah Rafa. Come on.
[1:16:38] And by that revelation, I fight every
[1:16:40] sickness with
[1:16:42] because it's been proven.
[1:16:44] I've been cancer free 30 plus years.
[1:16:47] I don't like to use remission and all
[1:16:49] that stuff. Remission means that it
[1:16:52] could come back. Uh it might come uh
[1:16:55] is on the way. No, I'm healed.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:00] Because I got a word says by stripes you
[1:17:03] were healed.
[1:17:05] already
[1:17:06] already happened in the mind of God. God
[1:17:09] just wanted me to come to the
[1:17:11] circumstance and show how to show me
[1:17:13] that I'm the master of my body.
[1:17:17] How? By faith.
[1:17:20] And by the grace of God, I've done that
[1:17:22] with diabetes. Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] Whatever type they come up with,
[1:17:29] right?
[1:17:33] How they know if it's a type one and
[1:17:34] type two?
[1:17:37] They make this stuff up as they go.
[1:17:39] Forgive me. Forgive
[1:17:42] forgive me doctors and nurses. Forgive
[1:17:45] me. But that's just the kind of person I
[1:17:47] am. Hallelujah. Like one one brother
[1:17:49] told me one time, he said, "Brother, you
[1:17:51] can't give the people faith. You can't
[1:17:53] you can't preach it like that." I said,
[1:17:56] "Huh?" He said, "Brother, you can't make
[1:17:58] the people have faith." I said, "That's
[1:18:00] true. that I can't make nobody have
[1:18:02] faith, but I can show them I believe it.
[1:18:08] Hallelujah. And I told him, I said,
[1:18:10] "Well, brother, medicine and doctors and
[1:18:12] all these things wasn't my experience."
[1:18:15] So, I had to preach my experience. The
[1:18:17] prophet of God say faith is an
[1:18:19] experience.
[1:18:20] Hallelujah. Yeah. And then you have
[1:18:22] people intellectually, they come and
[1:18:23] say, "Well, you know, brother Brandham,
[1:18:25] brother Brandham say the do the Lord
[1:18:27] gives doctors." Yes, he does. But he
[1:18:29] also gives miracles.
[1:18:32] Amen.
[1:18:36] Which would you
[1:18:41] Which would you rather have
[1:18:45] a $80,000 bill,
[1:18:50] a lead on your house
[1:18:54] or a miracle?
[1:18:59] give you the miracle anytime, any place,
[1:19:02] anywhere.
[1:19:05] Don't get me wrong. Now, like I said, I
[1:19:07] appreciate the doctors. They they got
[1:19:08] they, you know, they got this they got
[1:19:10] their space in this economy of God.
[1:19:13] Hallelujah. Cuz you know, I love a good
[1:19:14] doctor that come and say, uh, well, we
[1:19:17] don't know what's going on, so we just
[1:19:19] going to depend on the Lord.
[1:19:22] Hallelujah. Some of them talk like that.
[1:19:25] Amen.
[1:19:26] But church, you look at what God is
[1:19:29] doing in this time, in this hour. What
[1:19:32] he's doing is he's he's he's raising the
[1:19:36] bar.
[1:19:37] He's allowing things to happen that we
[1:19:39] have no answers for.
[1:19:42] And all you can do is believe.
[1:19:47] Before I before I uh before I come down,
[1:19:50] cuz right now I'm flying real high.
[1:19:53] Listen, I want to read something to you.
[1:19:56] Listen, this this this is oh my I'm
[1:20:00] running out of time. If we if we if we
[1:20:03] look at this real quick,
[1:20:06] the prophet says this is in the message
[1:20:08] uh perfect faith. He says, "Now, the
[1:20:10] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:20:13] faith in what you are. Have faith in
[1:20:16] what the word says you are." And Jesus
[1:20:19] had faith in the word of God. That said
[1:20:23] he that says what he was. It is written
[1:20:27] of me. Didn't David in the Psalms and
[1:20:30] the prophets and all them that speak of
[1:20:32] him? I am the bread of life that cometh
[1:20:35] from God out of heaven. Amen. I am the
[1:20:38] tree of life from the garden of Eden. I
[1:20:40] am these things. I am that I am. And he
[1:20:43] knew what he knew with that perfect
[1:20:47] faith that he was the anointed Messiah
[1:20:50] that the spirit of God was upon him. He
[1:20:53] said now I in myself do nothing but it's
[1:20:58] my faith. Hallelujah. But it's my faith
[1:21:01] in God and God was in him. The word made
[1:21:05] manifest. Now this is our part.
[1:21:09] And when the word of God comes in you,
[1:21:12] it's made manifest.
[1:21:15] For you are a believer. See,
[1:21:18] and a believer is the faith of God.
[1:21:23] Amen.
[1:21:26] A believer is the faith of God that
[1:21:29] moves in you.
[1:21:30] So we call ourselves what? Believers.
[1:21:33] And the prophet of God say for you to be
[1:21:35] a believer that means that you are the
[1:21:38] faith of God.
[1:21:43] Hallelujah. Oh my. Listen,
[1:21:47] before I before I get out of here, I
[1:21:49] want to narrow some things down. First,
[1:21:50] I want to stump on the devil a little
[1:21:52] bit.
[1:21:53] Everybody all right?
[1:21:54] Can we stump on him just a little bit?
[1:21:56] Let's strip him from his power.
[1:21:59] Right now I want to say to you, the only
[1:22:02] power the devil got is what we surrender
[1:22:05] to him.
[1:22:14] Fundamental foundation of faith. Now
[1:22:18] Satan by the laws of sin and death makes
[1:22:22] everything that sin and death bought
[1:22:24] operate. And Satan sends a cancer, the
[1:22:29] man recognizes it.
[1:22:34] In order for cancer to be alive in your
[1:22:37] body, you must believe in it.
[1:22:40] Amen.
[1:22:43] So you by believing in it, you give the
[1:22:47] enemy your faith.
[1:22:53] He said the man recognizes it, receives
[1:22:56] it. Satan sends heartaches. We recognize
[1:23:00] it and receive it. And if Satan by his
[1:23:03] power can make his laws work in men, how
[1:23:07] much more ought God with his power make
[1:23:11] his laws work in man? If Satan can make
[1:23:14] his laws be sure and us recognize it,
[1:23:18] how much more ought God through his
[1:23:21] children to make his laws be recognized
[1:23:24] among his people?
[1:23:26] Amen.
[1:23:29] How much more we get up and say,
[1:23:33] I think
[1:23:35] my throat kind of raspy. I think I think
[1:23:39] I'm coming down with something. You
[1:23:40] recognizing it?
[1:23:44] You're giving it power to live.
[1:23:46] What about when you feel that little
[1:23:48] scratch? You say, "The Bible says, "I'm
[1:23:51] healed."
[1:23:55] See, you recognize the law of God then
[1:23:58] versus the law of Satan
[1:24:00] because the law will work according to
[1:24:02] how you believe.
[1:24:06] Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:24:07] Amen.
[1:24:08] Listen. He says to make the law of his
[1:24:10] recognizing meaning in people by divine
[1:24:12] healing, revelation, power, gift,
[1:24:14] manifestations of the spirit. Now before
[1:24:18] I get out of here,
[1:24:22] let's talk about circumstances.
[1:24:31] In John chapter 11,
[1:24:35] a friend of the family of Jesus died.
[1:24:39] And Jesus was trying to give them uh he
[1:24:44] sent word after word trying to raise
[1:24:47] their faith above the circumstances.
[1:24:50] They came to Jesus said, "Jesus,
[1:24:51] Lazarus, my brother, he's sick. This
[1:24:53] that Jesus said, "Okay, all right. I'm
[1:24:55] coming."
[1:24:56] They come back and they say, "You know,
[1:24:58] I'm paraphrasing." They come back, oh
[1:24:59] Lord, father, he dying. He he he he his
[1:25:03] heart is fluttering. Jesus said, "Don't
[1:25:04] worry, I'm coming."
[1:25:07] And they kept it. They kept on it. Kept
[1:25:08] on it. Kept on it. Jesus said, "Look,
[1:25:13] I'm allow this to happen so you can see
[1:25:16] the glory of God."
[1:25:18] Amen.
[1:25:20] That's what all it's about.
[1:25:21] Circumstances. It's so that you can see
[1:25:24] the glory of God. But let's look at the
[1:25:27] circumstances and let's see if the
[1:25:29] circumstances can stop God.
[1:25:34] Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:25:36] Now, we're going to the tomb of Lazarus,
[1:25:39] but we're going to pull out some
[1:25:40] circumstances.
[1:25:43] Jesus gets there. Mary falls down and
[1:25:46] starts to worship and and mother say,
[1:25:49] "Lord, we're so glad you're here." And
[1:25:50] this and that and on and on and and then
[1:25:52] Martha says, "Lord, if you'd been here,
[1:25:55] my brother wouldn't have died." And then
[1:25:57] Jesus said, "This is for the glory of
[1:25:59] God."
[1:26:00] He's trying to raise her up.
[1:26:03] Hallelujah. You know, sometimes you go
[1:26:04] through something and you ain't told
[1:26:06] nobody. You get to church and the man of
[1:26:08] God start preaching on it. What is he
[1:26:10] trying to do? He's trying to get you to
[1:26:11] rise above the circumstances.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah.
[1:26:16] So now they say, "Oh Jesus, he's been
[1:26:20] dead four days."
[1:26:24] How many ever seen a body decompose
[1:26:26] after four days?
[1:26:28] It ain't a good sight.
[1:26:33] worms coming out of it. All kind of
[1:26:35] stuff.
[1:26:37] That's a little bit of circumstances.
[1:26:41] But then they say, "Master, by now he
[1:26:43] stankketh."
[1:26:45] That what the Bible say.
[1:26:48] Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] Where I'm at.
[1:26:58] Verse 17. He said when Jesus came and
[1:27:01] found him and laid him in the grave,
[1:27:03] four days already dead. Four days
[1:27:07] stanking, rotten,
[1:27:09] face sinking in
[1:27:12] ears probably fall. He ear probably like
[1:27:18] the body was decomposing
[1:27:21] and they talked to Jesus a little bit
[1:27:23] more. And then mother then mother says
[1:27:26] Lord
[1:27:29] I know my brother raised again
[1:27:31] in the day of the resurrection.
[1:27:35] Before she got there she says Lord if
[1:27:37] you would have been here my brother see
[1:27:40] Martha started to look beyond the
[1:27:42] circumstances
[1:27:44] and she started to exalt God where he
[1:27:46] couldn't resist her praise.
[1:27:50] She was changing the circumstances.
[1:27:54] What do you do when God comes in the
[1:27:55] room?
[1:27:57] Do you keep looking at what's in front
[1:27:59] of you
[1:28:00] or looking at what he can do?
[1:28:03] See, faith cause those things that are
[1:28:05] not seen as though they are.
[1:28:07] So Martha started to say, "Lord, if you
[1:28:09] was here, he would have died. But even
[1:28:12] now, Lord,
[1:28:16] she's changing the atmosphere."
[1:28:19] She's changing the circumstance. She
[1:28:21] says, "Even now, Lord, you can raise him
[1:28:24] up."
[1:28:26] And I can I I can I can see Jesus now
[1:28:29] like, "Oh, girl, girl, you get Oh, you
[1:28:32] give me God up in here."
[1:28:34] Don't talk to me like that.
[1:28:40] Sister, you know how it is. Your husband
[1:28:41] come home and you say, "Hey, my big
[1:28:43] teddy bear.
[1:28:44] He might have been fighting all that
[1:28:46] day. When he see that, he like
[1:28:53] He turned into a pile of mush
[1:28:56] because of those words of adoration,
[1:28:59] those words of praise. It changes the
[1:29:02] circumstances. Hallelujah. That wallet
[1:29:04] might have been tight, but now it didn't
[1:29:05] got loose.
[1:29:14] See, sister, y'all was loud enough.
[1:29:15] Y'all supposed to say, "Amen."
[1:29:18] Change the atmosphere.
[1:29:21] But look now,
[1:29:24] she begins to speak words
[1:29:26] and call her faith is her faith is being
[1:29:29] unlocked. And she's not worried about
[1:29:31] her brother being dead. All she can see
[1:29:34] before her now is God. And she starts to
[1:29:37] put him in position with her words.
[1:29:41] How many of us know how to put God in
[1:29:43] position with our words?
[1:29:46] Hallelujah. And now she says, "Lord, I
[1:29:50] know he'll raise again in the day of the
[1:29:53] resurrection." And Jesus said, "I
[1:29:58] am the resurrection."
[1:30:02] Where have you laid him?
[1:30:06] Jesus start walking through the walking
[1:30:08] walking that way. probably I don't know
[1:30:09] how long it was but sun beating down and
[1:30:12] everything. The sun the conditions of
[1:30:13] the weather couldn't stop him.
[1:30:15] He was getting there. Hallelujah. And
[1:30:17] then he get to the get to the tomb. It's
[1:30:20] stank and smelly and everything. The
[1:30:22] decomposing body couldn't stop him.
[1:30:26] None of the circumstances could stop
[1:30:28] him. Why? Because he was the word.
[1:30:31] He was the power of God made manifest.
[1:30:35] Hallelujah. What was he showing him? I
[1:30:37] put a measure in man that can control
[1:30:41] death.
[1:30:43] Amen.
[1:30:47] He said, "Roll a stone away." They
[1:30:49] rolled a stone away and that scent came
[1:30:51] out there like
[1:30:53] and I can see all the unbelievers
[1:30:58] running.
[1:30:59] Jesus looked stood up in front of that
[1:31:01] tomb and he said, "Lazarus,
[1:31:09] and skin start to come back,
[1:31:15] hair start to come back,
[1:31:18] pupils start to come back. Everything
[1:31:20] that everything that identified with a a
[1:31:23] living man responded to the voice of
[1:31:26] God. Everything that death took away.
[1:31:30] Hallelujah. The circumstances of death
[1:31:32] couldn't stop the calling of God when he
[1:31:35] calls your name.
[1:31:39] Hallelujah.
[1:31:41] He called Lazarus.
[1:31:43] Even bound up Lazarus stood up.
[1:31:47] None of those circumstances could stop
[1:31:49] it
[1:31:51] once God called his name. Amen.
[1:31:55] Not the the stench,
[1:31:58] not the unbelief.
[1:32:01] Hallelujah. Not the the deadness of the
[1:32:04] tomb,
[1:32:06] not the Hallelujah. the stone, none of
[1:32:08] that.
[1:32:10] When Christ came, it was a situation
[1:32:13] under control. Why? Because the master
[1:32:16] was there.
[1:32:17] And then the prophet of God says, "Oh
[1:32:20] my,
[1:32:21] if you got the Holy Ghost, that same
[1:32:25] power
[1:32:27] that raised Lazarus from the grave will
[1:32:30] also do what? Quicken your mortal body."
[1:32:36] Hallelujah. There's people on the earth
[1:32:39] right now that can't control death
[1:32:43] by knowing who they are.
[1:32:46] Come musicians. cuz I'm closing.
[1:32:48] Hallelujah.
[1:32:51] The circumstances.
[1:32:54] And you can respond by saying, "Amen."
[1:32:57] The circumstances.
[1:32:59] Facts. Was Lazarus dead.
[1:33:07] He was dead.
[1:33:08] That's a fact.
[1:33:10] Hallelujah.
[1:33:11] Was he in the tomb? Yes.
[1:33:14] Was he dead for four days?
[1:33:16] Amen.
[1:33:17] Hallelujah. All that's facts,
[1:33:21] but did that stop Jesus?
[1:33:24] None of those circumstances
[1:33:26] could stop the faith of God because he
[1:33:30] knew who he was.
[1:33:31] What about us, church?
[1:33:35] What about you and I knowing who we are?
[1:33:39] Whether it be a storm, whether it be a a
[1:33:41] sickness, whatever, there's a measure in
[1:33:44] you that God has put in you specifically
[1:33:47] for whatever you're going through.
[1:33:49] There was a measure of faith in Noah.
[1:33:52] Hallelujah. To build a cruise liner.
[1:33:56] Yeah.
[1:33:59] I say it like that cuz most of us have
[1:34:01] been on cruise boats and we marvel like,
[1:34:03] "Wow,
[1:34:07] no boat was bigger than that."
[1:34:08] Come on.
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:13] Hallelujah.
[1:34:15] It Noah boat was holding the world.
[1:34:18] Hallelujah.
[1:34:20] And this boat, hallelujah, had no
[1:34:22] blueprint. It was built by faith.
[1:34:27] God put a measure of faith inside of him
[1:34:30] just to hear the word and operate in it
[1:34:34] and take the people to safety.
[1:34:35] Hallelujah. But Moses didn't need a
[1:34:38] boat. There was another measure in
[1:34:41] Moses. Hallelujah. He wasn't escaping by
[1:34:43] a boat. He was going to speak to it.
[1:34:47] Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] So I say this to say this. Hallelujah.
[1:34:52] Somebody might operate this way.
[1:34:54] Somebody might operate that way, but
[1:34:56] your situation is for you.
[1:34:59] And God's put a measure of faith in you
[1:35:01] for that situation, for those
[1:35:04] circumstances.
[1:35:05] And the fact of the matter is, we got a
[1:35:07] word for anything the devil would dish
[1:35:09] out.
[1:35:10] Amen. Let's pray.
[1:35:16] Lord, we love you and we thank you. We
[1:35:19] praise you, Lord.
[1:35:21] And Lord, no doubt some of us are going
[1:35:23] through things right now. And Lord, you
[1:35:26] you allow those things to come to us,
[1:35:28] come close to us just to unlock a
[1:35:31] measure of faith that's already there
[1:35:33] for that situation.
[1:35:36] So Lord, help us to trust you, Lord, and
[1:35:38] to walk in life that you've placed
[1:35:40] inside of us.
[1:35:42] Lord God, forgive us for any measures of
[1:35:45] doubt, Lord. Lord, we pray that the
[1:35:47] quickening power will continue to
[1:35:49] quicken
[1:35:51] that which is in us day by day, hour by
[1:35:54] hour, minute by minute. Lord, bless this
[1:35:56] church and the ministries within, the
[1:35:58] people within. And Lord God, let this
[1:36:00] word, Lord, be recycled in our hearts,
[1:36:04] not in our minds, in our hearts, Lord,
[1:36:07] and let it drop down in a safe place.
[1:36:10] and let it produce that in which you've
[1:36:12] already provided before the foundation
[1:36:14] of the world. In the name of Jesus
[1:36:16] Christ, we pray.
[1:36:18] The church say amen.
[1:36:19] Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:36:20] Amen.

[1:46:30] are healed Lord and we are saved Lord
[1:46:32] and we are delivered because that's how
[1:46:35] you made us. You gave us dominion Lord
[1:46:37] and you told us to subdue and multiply
[1:46:40] Lord and we are the creation of your
[1:46:42] image Lord God and we knew no fear Lord
[1:46:45] in that image Lord. So Father you've
[1:46:48] already brought forth a restoration in
[1:46:50] Jesus Christ. And as we have received
[1:46:52] Jesus Christ in our life, that image has
[1:46:55] restored in us. So, Father God, we just
[1:46:58] ask that the faith of God be unlocked in
[1:47:01] every situation,
[1:47:03] every prayer, every need in this moment

[1:49:40] So, um
[1:49:42] um I went through the first one

[1:49:50] And I just finished my second one today
[1:49:52] and I got my scores back too. pass with
[1:49:55] flying colors again.
[1:49:57] Lord,
[1:49:58] so um two good grades and I'm hoping for
[1:50:00] more.
[1:50:01] Amen, brother.
[1:50:03] Anybody else?
[1:50:05] Sister Sarah, we'll pass that back to
[1:50:07] her.
[1:50:09] Just wanted to thank the Lord for
[1:50:10] another successful surgery on dad's
[1:50:12] other eye today. So grateful that's
[1:50:14] over.
[1:50:15] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:21] Anybody else? Before we go, Sister
[1:50:23] Melissa, I'll I'll tell Can I interrupt
[1:50:25] you just one before you? Um, and uh, you
[1:50:28] can hand that back. Maybe some of you
[1:50:31] already seen it and heard about it. I
[1:50:32] happened to be there and, uh, Brother
[1:50:34] Ron Spencer, who's been battling in
[1:50:36] 2020, uh, was diagnosed with cancer and
[1:50:40] then they, uh, they found, uh, he had
[1:50:42] five, I seen the scans of it, five brain
[1:50:44] tumors, um, in his head. He had gave him
[1:50:48] five months to live from that moment.
[1:50:51] And that's been that's been 5 years ago.
[1:50:53] So he's been a miracle ever since.
[1:50:55] They've been just praying and believing
[1:50:57] and he has to have scans routinely uh
[1:50:59] constantly to scan to to judge the size
[1:51:02] of that tumor and and etc. And it and it
[1:51:04] started giving him some trouble there. I
[1:51:06] think even those tumors started giving
[1:51:08] him some uh different uh just different
[1:51:10] complications with that. He went there
[1:51:12] Friday. I think it was last Friday for a
[1:51:14] scan. And I you'd have to see the whole
[1:51:16] testimony. It's uh it's pretty powerful.
[1:51:18] But I'll just say that I remember this
[1:51:20] part of it that the doctor walked in
[1:51:22] with this scan and said, "I want you to
[1:51:24] know this is a miracle. You don't have
[1:51:26] this is your first in five years, your
[1:51:28] first clean scan. No tumors in your
[1:51:31] brain at all." We ought to give the Lord
[1:51:33] a hand clap of praise for that. Amen.
[1:51:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:38] Amen.
[1:51:41] Amen. Brother Digs, you know what that's
[1:51:42] all about. Amen. Same God. Sister
[1:51:45] Melissa, go ahead. I just want to thank
[1:51:47] God for um last Wednesday I had a little
[1:51:50] girl get sick and um she's been
[1:51:52] coughing. The whole class has been
[1:51:54] coughing. You know, all this going
[1:51:56] around and she's been coughing for like
[1:51:57] three weeks. Well, um the class is very
[1:52:01] chatty under the best of circumstances
[1:52:03] and with spring break right around the
[1:52:05] corner, they're just all over the place.
[1:52:07] And so this particular day had been a
[1:52:10] day where they were just completely off
[1:52:11] task all day. And so lunchtime comes and
[1:52:15] you know they completely forget
[1:52:16] everything you teach them at lunch and
[1:52:17] they just do their own thing. And so
[1:52:19] there's consequences to that and they're
[1:52:21] well aware of those consequences. So
[1:52:23] that particular day those consequences
[1:52:25] would have been to go to the classroom
[1:52:26] instead of recess and stand at their
[1:52:28] desk. Um we're limited as teachers what
[1:52:31] you can do to you know put those little
[1:52:35] boats in the right direction. So that's
[1:52:38] one of ours. So um anyway I didn't
[1:52:41] change my mind. my mind was completely
[1:52:43] changed for me and instead of there was
[1:52:46] nothing in myself that said well maybe
[1:52:48] I'll let him go and you know have a
[1:52:50] little free time or whatever my mind was
[1:52:52] changed for me and I took them outside
[1:52:55] and normally when I take them outside
[1:52:57] from the cafeteria and I'm saying all
[1:52:59] these details because it meant so much
[1:53:01] to me when the events unfolded and even
[1:53:05] after I started to think about it but
[1:53:08] instead of um I always take them from
[1:53:10] the cafeteria to the classroom so they
[1:53:12] can use the restroom and then go outside
[1:53:14] and um put their lunch bags and stuff
[1:53:16] away. And this time I came downstairs
[1:53:19] and I just took them straight outside
[1:53:21] and I even told my co um my the other
[1:53:23] first grade teachers like if we go to to
[1:53:26] the classroom I know you know we're just
[1:53:27] going to stay in there. It had been that
[1:53:28] kind of day and so but I I didn't do
[1:53:30] that and my intentions were that they
[1:53:33] were going to have their consequence.
[1:53:34] So, one of the other consequences that
[1:53:36] we have to keep the kids, you know, um,
[1:53:39] where we need them to be is they'll walk
[1:53:41] the fence line. And so, that's what I
[1:53:43] told him. I was like, you know, you're
[1:53:44] going to go outside, you're going to
[1:53:45] walk the fence line. And so, they were
[1:53:46] walking the fence line. And as they
[1:53:48] walked about two little laps around the
[1:53:50] fence, and as they were coming back
[1:53:52] towards me, I would ask them a math
[1:53:54] question, and if they could answer it
[1:53:56] correctly, they could go. So, you know,
[1:53:58] as they were coming around, that's what
[1:54:00] was happening. And, um, there was a
[1:54:02] couple of kids that were kind of
[1:54:03] struggling. They hadn't made it around.
[1:54:05] And the next thing I know, the some of
[1:54:06] them that had went to play came to me
[1:54:09] and they said, "Miss Jordan. Miss
[1:54:10] Jordan." And they said the little girl's
[1:54:13] name. She went blank. And I was like,
[1:54:16] "What?" And you know, and I'm looking
[1:54:17] across the playground and she's on the
[1:54:19] ground. And I could tell from a distance
[1:54:22] that things were not right. So I rushed
[1:54:24] over to her and when I did, I screamed
[1:54:27] for my other teacher or, you know,
[1:54:29] called out to her, "Get the nurse now."
[1:54:31] And uh she was comp I've never really
[1:54:34] seen anything quite like it, but she was
[1:54:36] totally not there. She didn't know where
[1:54:38] she was. She didn't know her name. She
[1:54:41] her actually I have seen something like
[1:54:43] it, but it was when Jesse was in the
[1:54:46] hospital. But anyway, she just she
[1:54:48] couldn't there was she had no control of
[1:54:51] her body. So as soon as the nurse got
[1:54:52] there, she's like, she's, you know,
[1:54:54] she's having a seizure. So we um called
[1:54:57] the ambulance and they came and guide
[1:54:59] her and turned out she had a fever even
[1:55:01] though it wasn't very high. They think
[1:55:04] that's what had caused it. But the thing
[1:55:06] and my co-teer when she, you know, the
[1:55:08] other first grade teacher when
[1:55:10] everything settled down, she's like,
[1:55:11] "Miss Jordan, thank God they wasn't
[1:55:14] playing."
[1:55:15] You know, because she's a Christian,
[1:55:16] too. And she's like, "If she'd have been
[1:55:18] playing, she would have been on the top
[1:55:19] of the like jungle gem thing and she
[1:55:22] probably would have, you know, fallen."
[1:55:24] It was all the little details. Even if
[1:55:26] I'd have went to the classroom, and I
[1:55:28] know this isn't short. I'm sorry, but it
[1:55:30] means so much to me because if id have
[1:55:31] went to the classroom and they had been
[1:55:33] standing at their desk, we have hard
[1:55:35] floors. If she'd have fallen, you know,
[1:55:38] I think it would have been much worse.
[1:55:39] It's all the little things that God put
[1:55:42] in to make the best case of a bad
[1:55:45] scenario, you know, and uh she's fine
[1:55:47] now. She came back to school yesterday
[1:55:49] and she's doing very well. And I just
[1:55:51] want to thank God because it could have
[1:55:52] been very different.
[1:55:53] Yeah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:55:56] Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:00] Amen. We're going to let you go remember
[1:56:02] service this weekend. Amen. How many
[1:56:05] will be remembering our brother Diggs?
