just say it's great to have my son Timothy we heard from last night it was wonderful message that we heard from the Lord and amen the spirit of God moved and I believe he did amen and my daughter-in-law sister Ruth my granddaughter Katie my son-in-law brother Michael uh Dexter um Bethany stayed to the house with the children they got a little bit of colds that's going on so um see F to kep them keep them in so just remember of them in prayer if you'll turn with me to Ezekiel CH 37 I want to read from verse one amen Ezekiel 37 verse1 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord thou knowest and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye dried bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God un these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I will lay senu upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and beholding a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld L the news and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them and he then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus said the Lord come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army amen amen godess you you can be seated amen my it's uh great to be here back here in Buford again and amen have this time of Fellowship together amen great to see you sister Debbie God bless you we hadn't seen her amen see son she does have favorites she came out to hear me tonight so anyway we're we're glad for that you know that you're recovering and do better we prayed for you amen and we know that the Lord is a provider for every need that we have in the body and we thank God for that now tonight I am going to take a text here from these scriptures that we have read and I'm going to speak on all ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord and as we look upon the this scripture tonight tonight I I know there are many descriptive words within the Bible that describe the last age in its move of God and what we see in this passage of Ezekiel is the word of the Lord bringing restoration and it looks hopeless as you you read there they were not just bones but they were very dry you know and and in fact when he asked the prophet is asked can these bones live he actually had to refer back to God and say Lord th knowest but you see the word the Lord restores he's a restoring God Amen and God is doing much more than restoring Doctrine in this day although he has certainly um an important part of what God is doing in this last days but God is also restoring homes he is also Healing The Sick So PR for restoring health he is um he's restoring our pouring out the the original outpouring of the Holy Ghost he's restoring a book of Acts Church he's restoring homes and marriages and reuniting families you said well my problem today brother Tim is my job well you know this economy is not too good well you know he is a god who's concerned about every situation well my problem is my Health well God is a restorer of health and it don't even make it a difference if you're age today remember God is a restorer irregardless of age you know it was Abraham who received restored Health when he was a very old man and then God healed Sarah when she was past 90 because God has no limits on him amen and as far you ask is there anything too hard for the Lord now you know God's Prophet would rush to the bedside of a 90-year-old Bill da and see God come on the scene and heal him so that he would live years after that you see there's just no limits on this God no matter how far you have strayed or how de deep down you have gone in sin or what wickedness you have committed this God is a restorer amen no matter how bad off your family is or how far away they stray from God no matter how bad it looks they may be a houseful of infidels unbelievers but this God is a God that can reach further down than what you can look up amen he can bring a restoration when only bones are left because he is a God who said I will restore sayeth the Lord when we think about the the the the restoration of Israel in this day the land was a a very dry and a desolate place it had long went back to thistles and and Briars and its inhabitants had been dispersed throughout the world but the word said I will restore and God looked upon the valley of dry bones and said these bones hear the word of the Lord and the and they will become a great and a mighty Army and and God's word is brought about his restoration until today the nation of Israel is a mighty Army and a thriving Nation yes with great expectation in the hearts of many as they look for the Messiah to come that's right now when you look upon this and you see the natural fulfillment you know if they are being restored so is her spiritual counterpart the bride is reaching her fulfillment even ahead of them because we have to get out of the way before they can receive their Messiah and we are actually Advanced Beyond in restoration we have we have advanced beyond what Israel has and because we have seen the Messiah amen we have come back to the original atonement we have healing in our midst salvation in our midst the the Holy Ghost every part of the outpour of the Holy Ghost is with us in this hour I say what a privileged people we are Amen to have heard the word of the Lord I'm looking upon people today amen that that has HT it that were dry bones that lived many of you sitting right here tonight were dry bones that the word the Lord brought to life dry bones that lived amen and I'm also looking upon on some that are here that are still dry bones amen but the word of the Lord is still going to bring forth and bring to life amen even those who have just been Justified or Sanctified or gathered with the s new and the the flesh has come upon them but there today is the wind of the Holy Ghost that is coming from Glory that can make dry bones to live and to breathe amen I say tonight oh breathe breath of good oh breathe upon this church breathe upon this people breathe on these Dry Bones yes Lord amen this word can go out into distant lands this word can reach out into brothels into prostitute Deans down to drunkard to those who are addicted no matter who they are amen this word can find them he will find every predestinated seed he will not leave one of his behind that's amen amen it don't matter how far they've strayed that's right and look like they've turned down their day of grace and the mercy that was given to them this is a god of not just Second Chances but third chances and fourth chances and F Chan this is a God who will never give up Amen brother I think of a young boy in our church his name is Justin he was out living in sin you know he'd been raised up in the house of God and pulled out into the world and sin had got him and taken him out and and and took him into an awful life of of drugs and alcohol and sex sins and all kinds of things that was going on in his life living in that kind of condition you know and it broke his family apart and and and disunified the family there was Brokenness and heartache in the home and his young his young sister about 16 years old at the time you know come down to to to the in a in a prayer line and said I want my brother saved I want him brought back to God you know before that prayer line was over the Holy Spirit went and got that boy got him up out of his bed he came to church in his pajamas amen exactly right man came to church in his pajamas there and showed up at the house of God Amen come down to the altar gave his heart to God and still is serving God hallelujah amen because this God is a restorer he can make drones to live yes sir Hallelujah I'll tell you what we can have a Justin wear moment right here in this church tonight where you can see God move on the behalf of your children amen this is a God who specializes in impossibilities to man amen things that you gave up on I gave up on Pastor gave up on but God never gave up on amen that's a truth now another of these descripted words promis and restoration is the latter rain the latter rain brings to harvest all the seeds since Genesis and it is here that seeds are are sown by both sers and they will both come to maturity the tear and the wheat will both come to maturity in this age because of the outpouring of the latter rain he tells us in Hosea 6 and one what he will do in Israel as a natural nation and as upon the bride as a spiritual Nation So reading from Hosea 6:1 he says come and let us return to the Lord for he torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight amen now from hosea's time a prophecy that that now Israel is is well into the third day in other words it's been 2500 years or more since Hosea spoke these words you know a thousand years be a day and in the third day they have they have compassed 2,000 years and now they're here where as Hosea has prophesied after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight amen then we shall know if we follow on if if with we with seal go on to know the Lord that his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain and as a latter and former rain upon the Earth notice how he says he will come yes as unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain up on the earth now brother bam tells us in spoken words Original Seed he said what's the matter now she's waiting for the latter rain now he's right here on the cusp of the Mysteries of the seven seals being open and the latter rain to fall and that he says now she's waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruits I hope you get her then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denominations wants more members are going to get it that's what they've gotten Pentecost once more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get right but the word is going to produc Sons and Daughters of God Amen watch look at that great latter rain that's supposed to be done how they would run over the wall and leap over and how there would be an army coming amen just wait a minute the kind of crop you'll get is the kind of seed you put in your field so aren't you glad that the son of man went forth in this day sewing seed so that there could be Sons and Daughters of God God in this age that would be sons of the word offspring of the word not offspring of denomination but a word Offspring amen this latter rain or this outpouring here in the seventh age is an outpouring of the spirit amen that has brought back sons of God back to the promised land of the Bible they are return with wave after wave after wave and they are taking the land and the dry bones are coming to life until ultimately the dry bones of the Saints of The Seven Ages also Will Rise by the word of this prophecy amen son of man can these bones live the instruction comes speak prophesy and prophesy again yes amen there's a principle I want you to get from the words of Jesus that I'm going to look at um here a a principle Matthew chap 11 and verse 12 maybe you can turn in your Bible or they can put it on the screen Matthew 11:12 for and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence in other words used force and the violent or the strong take it by force now notice it's a principle that I I want to get to you because you cannot be lukewarm about this right you cannot be complacent every man every woman every boy every girl has to put on the armor and fight in this battle this is a battle for our lives even in service today is not just the preacher that has to bring has to bring the word you got to help me preach amen you got to respond you got to do your part you have to create an atmosphere around you so so that someone next to you will start believing and and be able to receive something from God so from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence are used to force and the violent the strong take it by force you see there are things you must do there are parts that you must play in this God wants you to participate in his work this is not a denominational meeting where you just are a spectator and come and just to be entertained for a little bit you're here to to participate in his work he said to like to those little women there Mary and Martha roll away the stone amen he could have spoke that word and broke that stone into a million slivers but he didn't he called for weak Little Women to step up and roll away the stone and when they did their part god did his part amen you've got a part to do also you must stand there and speak the word and prophesy and prophesy [Applause] again now some of the translators say this is one of the most difficult passages of scripture to to translate because the uh the words used in Greek they had to translate them back to Hebrew and then and then to English to get the meaning from them because it was so difficult to translate and this is the translation they came up with from the moment John stepped onto the scene until now the realm of Heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and passionate people have taken hold of its PowerAll amen so from the moment John stepped on the scene until now the realm of Heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and passionate people have taken hold of its power and I just want to say from the days of our Forerunner our John the bapti amen this Elijah he has used force and even now we must use Force the realm of Heaven's Kingdom bursted open under that Ministry and those that are passionate have taken hold of its power amen I I hope there's someone here tonight that has a passion that has a drive that has a Zeal a zealousness for this message amen young people old people didn't matter what age you are married whatever single it that matter of zealousness yes yes people who won't quit who won't stop who won't back up who won't Retreat amen who will not give up the land Who Won't Give Up on a promise of God Amen but one that will take it by force stand Toe to Toe with the devil and say give it back amen Souls of men that he's taken away from God give back our children give me back my house give back the Holy Ghost to the church oh Breath of God breathe and let the word come from your breath [Applause] Hallelujah from the days of our Forerunner how many believes that we've had a John the Baptist am amen this Elijah from the days of this Elijah he used Force and we must use Force demons fell by force the maniac fell by force it was not William Brandon but it was the man that that the maniac was contesting it was God's word the devil had contested and it's not you that the enemy has come again it's the word that he come against and this battle is not that you are in is not your battle it's the Lord's battle amen and it's not a flesh and blood battle it's a spiritual [Applause] battle blind eyes and deaf ears came open by force you know it wasn't too long ago I was driving down in in Little Rock and I came by a place and and it just joged my memory just jogged my memory as I looked at at school for the death and I remembered I remembered the the testimony that came out of there where brother brandham was there preaching in a Little Rock and they took him to that to that Death School and not just a few not just one or two but A2 deaf and dumb in Little Rock Arkansas began to hear hallelujah amen brother what was God doing taking it by force amen oh my think about that seven angels bursted forth from Heaven's realm yes by force and Seven Seals were open the book was taken by force no Jesus didn't wrestle you know the lamb didn't wrestle it from God but the lamb had been in battle for this book The Lamb got all bloody by doing it amen he wrestled the inheritance from the grip of Satan's claim and he claimed the book for us and now passionate people have taken a hold of his power I'm going to tell you what we are armed with a powerful word tonight yes the sword of the king is back in the hands of men amen amen amen come on church that day when brother brandham was in sabinaa Canyon there was a sword came into his hand what did it show it showed that the sword is back in the hands of a man once again amen hallelujah ah you say now wait a minute brother Tim that was brother brandom's sword no it wasn't it was the sword of the king amen and even as Moses went and got ten commandments that was Israel getting Ten Commandments and as brother bradam received the king's sword that was the receiving the king's sword and it's back in the hands of man again the power of the word is in your mouth for the way you handle a sword is by the mouth amen but how did those bones live they live by the word the Lord spoken by the mouth of a man that's the way dead bones live that's how they come to life yes now brother brandham talks about this in warning than judgment I'm using an old title there said Lord Jesus we are people who are trying our best with all that's in US amen that's passionate to walk in the light of the Gospel of of the your great gospel that you died to make right we're so thankful in this dark evil day that we're living now in this hour that we see the signs appear and oh God as it is a handwriting on the wall and we thank thee Lord that we can see it and know that Deliverance is close at hand amen know that Deliverance listen signs signs of his Deliverance Among Us things that are happening that we should know that deliverances are near for your loved ones every time God heals a cancer every time he brings in the loss every time a a prodal comes in those are signs of Deliverance that Deliverance is near for

great signs and show yourself daily every year there's not a year passes but what great his Supernatural signs is striking the earth oh we see it knowing that the great Army of God marches onone oh not many in number but what a powerful group that's got eternal life that said they shall run to a troop and leap over a wall yes the troop of death will have no holders to it she'll run right through it leap over the wall between the natural and the Supernatural and go into the arms of God into that great eternity Lord we thank you for this we know that time is approaching at hand yes that's me amen I'm going to run to a troop of death leap over the wall amen the devil may have given you a death no notice and I'm saying and you know and and and it's saying that I'm going to take you into death but I if it was me I would run through that troop of death I would leap over the wall right into the promises of God hallelujah you see it's coming in waves of Glory it's coming as an outpouring of the Holy Ghost you ever see rain coming huh sometimes it just comes in wave after wave after wave the realm of Heaven's kingdom is breaking forth into this age yes an angel broke through the clouds of unbelief and from Heaven's Dimension came an angel descending out of a pillar of fire amen from that the sick were healed blind eyes were open they were they were able to Proclaim Bible days are here again I just want to tell you Bible days are not over amen amen we're still in Bible days here come seven angels bursting through the portal Between Heaven and Earth as a lamb tore off the seals and handed down the Revelation to the seventh angel on Earth making the Bible a new book because it's no longer closed it's open Hallelujah I'm standing here tonight proclaiming that Bible days are here again amen amen we have returned to Paul's gospel with the same word and the same power amen you know when when that happened with brother brandom that caused waves after waves of Glory when the angel appeared to him many he got swept up and moved moved by the power of God it just didn't just affect brother brandom it affected other Ministries as well oh yeah you see the wave of God is not just about a prophet that's right although that is very much involved it's a very integral important part of it an angel of God came to the prophet an angel of God came to you as well yes so there was wave after wave after wave as the Holy Ghost be to be poured out and it would be poured out upon such men not not only brother brandom but there would be others like that would try to pick up and and and ride on the wave of that outpour men like Jack Cole and or Roberts am man and and they would ride on the wave of that outpouring I'm I'm what I'm trying to tell you is that you also must ride on the wave of that [Applause] outpouring amen now Jack Co was an assembly God preacher he had attended uh some of brother B Bron's meeting he had some doubt in his heart he didn't believe what he was seeing was real he spoke about how he was in a meeting and he watched brother Bram prayed for a blind man and brother bradam told him that he was healed but because he had no eyeballs it would take three days for them to form but in three days he would be able to see and Jack Cole thought ah anybody can say that you know the blind man will leave and go home nobody ever know that he whether he received his healing or not anybody can say that and his brother bradam leaves a platform he stops and speaks to Jack and says what are you so skeptical about you're a preacher yourself you're sick too but you're sickness because you run down from so many Revival meetings but don't be skeptical about this God's got a work for you to do too well Jack was was thrilled by those words but he waited three days for that blind man for the blind man before he was convinced sure enough on the third day eyeballs had formed in the man's head and by evening he could see as good as anybody Hallelujah and that so inspired him that he got under that anointing and begin to believe God and rode on the wave of Divine Healing these men would tap into Heaven's outpouring amen they knew you could sit though right under the flow of the spirit right in the spout where the glory was coming out and miss it because of unbelief or unconfessed sins yes Jack had to be stirred from his unbelief in order to start believing once he started believing then the power began to work for him and healing Miracles started to take place and then he too would ride on that Divine Healing wave you said well brother Tim I don't have any unconfessed sins I'm not a sinner or maybe you didn't go out and rob a bank maybe you hadn't murdered somebody but every one of us deal with a measure of unbelief in our heart you got to come passionate about what you have amen and when you come to the house of God get rid of your unbelief and these men knew you could not W ride on this wave with unbelief and unconfessed sins in your life amen Jack would say and give testimony about this and and maybe this will give you a key to some of to some of you for your healing he said you just can't let Envy malice and strife come in your heart and that thing will rob you from the thing that God has for you it will take the blessings of God right out of your life know you can have every kind of all kinds of things I don't know what your hang up is you can have a spirit of possessiveness that you possess your wife and your kids and you hold them under bondage or some kind of spirit of jealousy or envy and that evil spirit will keep you from the glory of God as it comes to the church maybe maybe some of these things aren't outward sins but they're inward hidden things there are things that we wrestle with because of our flesh when you come in the presence of God you want to examine Yourself clean yourself up in his presence and let him deal with your unbelief in your life yes that's the trth so Jack said you can let envy and Malice and strife come in your heart and that thing will rob you from the thing God has from you will take the blessings of God right out of your life and he and he tells he said how much have I heard this in the healing line that people say I I don't understand sister so and so uh don't get healed and then and if she doesn't get healed well then nobody get healed because she's a saint of God well how do you know he is he asked maybe man looks on the hour ped but God looks on the heart you don't know what sister so and so's got in her heart quit judging yourselves by by yourselves judge yourself by him the perfect one you've heard it hundreds of time their sister so and so and she's an invalid she doesn't get healed nobody get healed I can't go by sister so and so there's only one thing I can go by and that's this book that he's promis to heal all of my diseases take away all my iniquities he said a host of angels encamp around those that fear the lord he didn't tell me to pattern my life after sister so and so he told me to pattern my life after him said be you therefore perfect as I'm perfect somebody said brother Co do you believe you can reach Perfection yes and you can reach Perfection you don't even know your own wife's heart because you look at her faults all her shortcoming you don't know your own husband's heart you don't know the thoughts that run through his mind what right do you have to stand up and say if God don't heal him then nobody will get healed then he then he tells how he was at a meeting down in Texas one time and on the way home a Pastor said I I just don't understand you know you prayed for a woman tonight in the church she is the worst drunkard in this town and everybody knows she's a habitual drunkard and she sat down the Altar and gave her heart to God and you prayed for that after that and she dropped her crutches and went all over the building praising godall now tell me why God will heal somebody like that when there's a sister in my church with a Waterhead baby and she's a Deacon's wife and they pay their tithe and they come to church and there's not a more Godly couple in the world than that couple why is it that God don't heal that baby and I said to the pastor I said look I don't know her life he said but I do he said no you don't oh yes I do he said she's the only woman he's the only man that I can put uttermost confidence in my church and look what they have to go through carrying that Waterhead baby at 8 years old and can't walk and great big head and little bitty body and that child cries all hours of the T night that mother has to be up with it now you tell me why God won't heal that baby so I don't know her heart you don't either oh yes I do so he said they said no more about it but the next morning in the prayer line the spirit of God got to moving and the sister stood on her feet with tears rolling down her cheeks and said I've missed God said I I have murmured and complained because God gave me a Waterhead baby you see a lot of times people murmur and complain against God because of the grab bag of Life maybe you lost your wife or your husband or or you've been through a divorce or maybe somebody did something to you that was wrong or or the church failed you or the pastor didn't come to see you when you thought he should have and you developed a bitterness in your heart you know you see you've got to deal with sin no matter what it is if you want the blessings of God Amen that sin will keep you from the house of God keep you from The Fellowship of Believers amen it'll keep you from the presence of almighty God and the blessings that should follow and should flow your over your life I know what bitterness will do Amen brother amen bitterness and a heart turned against God happened to a lady because she couldn't have a baby and she held it in her heart until it continued to grow and it drove her insane she took her life that's what bitterness will do you got to deal with sin no matter what form is in if you want to ride on the wave of God's glory if you want the benefit of his healing power if you want to see God move for your family if you want God's blessings on your life you got to deal with sin no matter where it comes from what form it's in that's it might come from the gossip of somebody else who had bitterness in their own heart against the church or against the pastor as to why you don't attend church yourself and the reason why you don't have any confidence in the ministry but it's sin yes could be bitterness against a parent oh yes maybe a broken home or maybe you were sexually abused but it hindered you and it bound you from moving on with God and even receiving the Holy Ghost and being a Christian that you know you ought to be and and then that bitterness begins that root of bitterness begins to defile many oh yes oh yes it'll work right quietly right in your home and it'll defile your kids and there'll be an attitude in the home against God and then you wonder why they straight away uh-huh I tell you right now if I were you and I wanted to ride on this wave of the glory of God I would start right now saying God Purge me Lord I would start right now saying let the blood cover me Lord amen wash away this unbelief this doubting this criticism in my life let me be pure before you yes Lord because only the pure and heart shall see God you want to see God tonight you want to see God in these meetings amen only the pure and heart so sanctify your life yes Lord It's Time let the blood flow over and this pastor told Jack said well I don't know a more saintly couple than this woman and her husband with the Waterhead baby he's my he's a deacon in my church and they pay their tithe Faithfully they've stood by me in difficult times but here this next morning she stands up and says I have missed God I have murmured and complain because God gave me a Waterhead baby let me just correct a little something here first of all God doesn't send sickness sickness is of the devil God didn't cause your children to stray Satan did that God didn't cause you to be born in a dysfunctional family you can't blame God for what your circumstances of Life are you got to realize that this we are living in is not the Millennium it's a world of sin and unbelief and doubting and fear and dark amen unfortunately we weren't born none of us in God's Eden this ain't the Millennium that's right you were born in Satan's Eden and you got to overcome it amen and God has confidence in every predestinated seed that matters not what circumstance or situation they brought up been brought up under they're going to come through anyway like that woman at the well the Devil Couldn't do enough to stop a predestinated seed because there was a Divine appointment for her life am Hallelujah it would cause Jesus to go out of his way by Samaria yes and wait on her to come that's right send his disciples away brother Brandon said about it said she probably wasn't a bad girl she's probably sold by her father for monetary reasons started out with that kind of life but you see no matter what the devil can't hide a predestinated seed from his God he came to seek and to save that which is lost he's here today to uncover the mud and the Darkness of your life so that you can ride on the wave of God's glory this woman said I blam God in my heart nobody ever knew this the pastor didn't know it my husband didn't know it I've been bitter against God I found fult with the pastor now here it comes out and she said brother I want to ask you to forgive me in my heart I criticize you cuz you did not pray the prayer of faith to make my baby well I'm pretty sure the man had prayed many prayer of faith but because of unconfessed sin in her life she could not receive that blessing she was asking for faith comes by the by the person who has been prayed for it is the man that healed you or even in his faith that healed you it's your faith in Touching God through that man's prayer you got to believe amen and she said at home I've criticized everybody in this church in my heart not outwardly in my but in my heart here's here's the reason I wasn't healed such and such in the church this is the reason why you know my kids went astray such and such in the church the pastor this this that and he said down on the inside of me he said I've been one of the most bitter people that ever was and this morning I prayed through and said if God never heals my baby never let it get SW I'm going to walk with God and that night she brought that baby in the prayer line and I anointed it and I prayed for it and when she went out the door I couldn't tell a bit of difference in the baby and I said sister God will heal and answer your prayer if you're clear before God she said brother Co if I carry this baby To My Grave I'm going to walk with God I have cut the bitterness out and it's going to stay out I'm not blaming anyone I'm just seeking God's face and seeing how close I can get to him hallelujah amen now that's something somebody that heaven will open to when they become passionate about God whatever you have to do God I just want this one result let me come closer to you Lord I'm just seeking God's face just to see how close I can get to him yes I wonder if you could do that tonight oh my forget about your need and the request in your heart that need for a job that need for your healing that need for your husband's healing that need for financial blessing your loved one that's lost to be saved and get one thing in mind Lord I'm seeking your face to see how close I can come to you amen I want to be a friend of God one that is sensitive to the move of the spirit and this bitterness this hindrance that has kept me from the blessings of God yes to be gone from my life yes Lord that woman took her little baby home that night set it down on the floor to go make the beds while the baby was on the floor it reached down and untied its own shoes it took its stockings off and stuck it up underneath the the the crib and and put the and carried his shoes in there and was putting his shoes there under the crib and the mother turned around and saw that baby you know setting those those uh shoes there under the bed and there was she ran clean out of the house there screaming at the top of her voice and praising and magnifying God she came back to church the next night and burst up the whole service showing how her child could walk well still had the Waterhead but you know what happened as that woman grew closer to God the whole head began to shrink and shrink and Shrink and in less a year's time that child's head was back to normal sometimes you know you want it to be instantaneously you want microwave healings but you see you you want instantaneous Miracles but God is a God that heals in many different ways you just you just draw closer to God and see if he w't honor his word amen we get prayed for nothing happened to me I didn't feel the thing it didn't work that's not the true confession of Faith get that unbelief out of you God can't heal you with that amen I witnessed a brother one time that was so stoved up with arthitis so bad he could hardly get around and he was prayed for and his joint snapped and his joints limbered up and he was healed he jumped up and down all around the building his bones free completely healed amen he came back the next service and said we got to find something that that that last something that really works and today he sits and still in a pitiful condition because he let unbelief Rob him of the blessings of God yes he rode on that wave for just a few minutes and sunk back down in despair we got to have something at'll work something that last healing that just that that will last that may be you but I can remember a man by the name of Peter yes that one time walked on water and then sunk but that wasn't his end amen he turned around and cried Jesus save me lest I perish and he got his eyes back on the Lord and He Walked on Water twice amen are you with me amen if you have fallen down and you're seeking and you feel all is hopeless and you're just going to drown in that anger or that bitterness or whatever it is get your eyes back on Jesus and call out to him and say save me l i perish and he'll make you to walk on water twice get ready to walk on water again that's what I'm saying to you tonight you that are weary despondent think you for forgotten get ready to walk on water again amen so well I hadn't had the joy of the Lord in my life for a long time get ready for it to come back he said I will restore sayith the Lord these bones shall live again let me continue that little child's story in less a year that child's head was normal another evangelist came back and and you know the child could not hear or speak and the Evangelist prayed for the child and God loosed his tongue gave his hearing back Jack said the last time I saw that woman her child was in the third grade was a normal healthy well child running and playing with the rest of the children she got everything out of the way if you will confess your heart out before God and get everything out of the way you can press through and touch the HM of the Garment it'll make you whole the Bible said confess your faults one to another pray for one another that you may be healed do you want to be healed do you want Deliverance do you want to be free yes Lord then press through and touch the hym of His Garment Amen in order to touch the hym of His Garment you got to bow down to get the Hy come on you got to humble yourself before God and he'll lift you up amen the Bible said confess your false one another pray for one another that you might be healed do you want to be healed amen you want that Deliverance in your life then it's time to deal with the bitterness in your heart the secret sins that are there that are holding you back that backsliding condition that keeps you out of church well I know someone who was you might say I know someone that was sinful and full of pride and arrogance and God healed them anyway listen God will heal right over your stupidity oh yeah yeah amen he'll sometime heal ride over your ignorance to show you that he's God but that bitterness has to get out of the way for you to be able to ride on the wave of God's grace and Glory I ask you again do you want God's favor amen amen listen Heaven is open right healing came when Heaven is open Miracles come the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost is right back here again today the Eternal prescription Heaven is open but you decide whether or not you're going to be a recipient of the opening because it is a passion of people who lay hold of its power in the message of seven Church Jesus brother brandham says his great glorious presence shall strike the Earth he cometh in clouds oh my we saw him come in cloud with seven Mighty Angels opened up to Seven Seals seven Thunders have uttered their voices that makes you a people of power come on you have tapped into Heaven's power and Heaven's anointing amen oh his great glorious presence shall strike the Earth he cometh with clouds oh I love that clouds there will be wave after wave of his glory will come across the earth and the resurrection of the Saints shall come when that bless said the Holy Spirit that's lived in their hearts and they died with their with their corpses laying there and the tear stains on their cheeks and

fellow my dad will know his people his grandfather his people on down like that wave after wave after wave and the Saints arising from everywhere won't it be wonderful that makes old people feel young again hallelujah amen glory to God in this age there has been wave after wave of his Spirit as he pours it out yes 1906 the last Church age began and it will end with the resurrection and the Rapture Dry Bones will live again the Saints of all ages will arise wave after wave has been poured out by his Spirit prophecy after prophecy revelation after Revelation amen amen we begin with theusa Street and then again you know actually would actually begin in Kansas and then isza Street and then Louisiana and God poured out his spirit and and would finally you know would would go out into all nations people thought it was Pentecost they did they called it so and and so it was the beginning yes but the day of Pentecost would not fully come until the full word was restored am amen amen isusa Street was not the complete it however was greater than Luther's justification it was greater than Wesley sanctification because it was accompanied with an you know and ausa Street was accompanied with a Outburst of emotion and speaking in tongues and people thought it was the real but it went right back into organization proved it wasn't the real but there is another people in the land amen who are the final wave of the spirit it's more than it's more than forgiveness of sins it's more than sanctification where one puts sins off of their flesh it's it's more than an outburst of emotion and a gift of the spirit it's our word the very very Life of Christ himself is on display I tell you what it's time for another wave yes and you know what you have to do to become clean before God you need to purify your heart yes you need to need to prepare for the blessings of God to come amen so you can be a recipient of that divine grace yes sir amen we sang the song I Saw love mercy and Grace amen don't you need more of that amen amen well you got you got to get a bit a bigger capacity for the word than that little jug that fills up after about 40 minutes and you're through and ready to go home you got to get a bigger capacity that when the word Goes Forth then you water it with praises instead of getting restless and wanting to go home and you know but you because you can't wait on the spirit of God to move in the church you got to get a bigger capacity for the word of God than what you have amen yes amen listen I I I I hear your pastor sometime I I fussed at him here while back I said quit quit saying this about time and and and and again and I got to hurry on and and I I got to I've got a schedule to again I said quit saying that preach don't worry about time preach amen I just say to you people get a bigger jug in your life get more capacity for the word sir it's all right even if you don't have enough capacity to let it overflow all right amen let it overflow out of your cup to your drink it out of your sauca do you have enough to give to the neighbors to the friends you can't contain all the glory of God in your life that's right that's right Hallelujah am you're that final way before the dead in Christ rise yes there's a resurrection promised in the end time amen yes sir there is a spiritual resurrection that precedes uh the the physical amen did you hear me yes amen before there's a physical Resurrection there has to be a spiritual Resurrection this bride will not be a leot toan she will be by no means a lukewarm she will be on fire for God she will be an overcoming church with a fire of zealousness in her bosom that rises up and says that the enemy has to fall that says I am not living with that monkey on my back not one more day I'm not carrying this the rest of my life and I'm not going to allow the devil to ride on my shoulder the enemy is not going to torment my family another day the Jubilee trumpet has sounded and says you are free it says throw down your ho throw down your unbelief throw down the spirit of darkness and call Heaven down because heaven has been [Applause] opened it's time for another wave where the Life of Christ will be on display the full word has been restored Paul's gospel is here by the opening of The Seven Seals it is returned to us back to the very gospel that Paul preached Pentecost could not preach that ausa street failed Amen brother BR would tell them in their 50th Jubilee why pen why I think Pentecost fell it's because they didn't go far enough with God they stopped with speaking in tongues and didn't press on amen amen even in your life with just revealing the mystery amen even in your walk Christ has to be made real to you yes you say well I I know predestination and serpent seed and I can out debate the best but I want you to know this I want to ask this do you know Jesus that's it that's it do you really know Jesus do you know the power of his resurrection do you know the quickening power of the life of God that will Quicken your mortal body and make it subject to the word of God that will cause you to live an overcoming life it's it's not knowing his Doctrine it's life it's knowing him that is life Pentecost sought the gift and not the giver and we received the gift of the word and many have got the form of the letter but left the spirit far behind amen that's the truth what will the full word do it brings a people to full age yes to maturity yes Hebrews 5:13 says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is obeyed that means he is unskillful he's inexperienced right you know prior ages drank the milk of the word in the age of justification that was a word but it was just milk Wesley still milk sanctification unskillful in the word of righteousness ausa Street drank the milk of emotion and gifts and that excited the human spirit and its emotions but it was still milk yes amen but verse 14 of Hebrews 5 said but strong meat remember the strong take it by force amen but strong meat belonging to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised or their perception invigorated to discern both good and evil full age yes there's a people coming to full age that's why this is called the bright age it's the marriage age it's the time of marriage it's the Rapture age it's the climax it's the grain age it's the hardest time is a you see it's the age that goes into the Garner yes truth brother full age see the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 13:10 but when that which is perfect has come and the the word perfect here is full age amen when the word comes to its fullness then that which is in part shall be done away with now let me just say then having just part is done away with because when you have the fullness you have it all amen yes amen that's it come on yes want to go back over that again the word perfect here is full age when the word comes to its fullness then that which is in part is done away with so then just having part is done away with because when you have the fullness you have it all yes amen amen now of course we've used that scripture to do away with emotion or gifts of the Spirit today we don't want tongues or gifts of the Spirit we don't want emotion you know yeah so they don't deny justification but they've but but they've even reduced sanctification just except accepting a bunch of rules it's just a law they're afraid they might get a little emotional or something you say well that's because we're growing up brother Jim we're full age because we're mature now this this jumping up and down and trying to speak in tongues is over with and I agree I agree jumping up and down like a kid and trying to speak with tongues is over with it's not the evidence of a spirit filled life it's not what we're seeking after we're not trying to speak with tongues that's all over with the full word has come in a manifestation and with the full word all of it all of it is here amen and if you ever get born of the word you will be a tongue speaking acts 238 screaming yelling younging because that's the only kind the word can bring [Applause] forth amen Hallelujah so when I was a child I spoke as a child we had childishness in ages past I understood as a child and that's true they didn't have full understanding I thought as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things let me give you an example right I read a I read a a book of one of the Pentecostal fathers um from isusa Street John G Lake many of you may have heard of him he was he died in the 1930s he was called an apostle disci South Africa he was a great man of Faith but he understood as a child when the spirit broke forth in a camp meeting in 1916 spiritual fire broke out there was a man that was up during the night reading his Bible and he saw that the apostles baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and and then they turned to another place and saw they were B baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he read another place everywhere in the Bible in the New Testament in the book of Acts who were all baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he went running through the camp of that bunch of trinitarians spreading the word that there was one God righten and you were to baptize in his name yes of course later they made a denomination out of it right but John G Lake understood as a child and he said now listen to him listen to him today there's a lot of questions about baptisms and some are taking Peter's words in the book of Acts but I'd rather believe the words of Jesus more than anybody else's words and he said to baptize in the name of the father and of the and and the Son and the Holy Ghost so I'll just take what Jesus said how could he do that he was a child right right amen he was mature in his thinking amen he ought to been mature enough to know that scripture cannot fight scripture and that Peter also had the words of Jesus all right when he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but but John G Lake thought as a child and he spoke as a child and when he did he spoke foolish things amen we don't have to speak foolish things we can speak as mature adults as a mature church we know that word doesn't fight words amen amen scripture doesn't fight scriptures quote don't fight quotes amen that's amen somebody here the other day you know I I shared a few things and and then and they in turn you know you know you know sent a bunch of other quotes I said hey I love quotes you can't hurt me with quotes amen I love every one of them yes but they got to be placed correctly yes that's the truth amen so you see we know that word don't fight word scripture don't fight scripture quotes don't fight quotes but you must find the continuity of it all you just can't build a Doctrine on one quote Amen brother Bram tells us at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was on the earth manifesting the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on the earth amen J Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Luke 17:30 in the days as it was and the days of Sodom when the son of man be revealed himself it be the same thing we are in the day when the full word has been revealed and that's the wave we are riding on yes yes amen well our is not on speaking in tongues anymore that's right but we can still have speaking in tongues because it's in the word and this is a day when just having part is done away with that's right are you with me well we don't need that brother Tim that's not what Paul said he said in 1 Corinthians 145 I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied well we prophecy either well that's another story so then when he concludes his discourse you know when he he says you know I I'd rather have you yes gifts are wonderful whatever but but without love what does it Avail yes and love is a very basic element of God it's it's his nature so without the nature of God what is it if we speak in tongues to prophesy or know all the Mysteries but when he sums it all up he says wherefore brother C to prophesy and forbid not to speak in tongues amen amen amen well our emphasis brother Tim is not on Divine Healing and that Great Divine Healing move is over well that might be right but as long as we got needs in this body we need Divine Healing yes sir and it's part of the word sure the emphasis is on having the fullness of the word but with the full word comes the fullness of his power that's right so the full word is to be born in manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in full strength as it was when he was here on the earth Hallelujah doing the same things it did when he was here on the earth you see the son of man is revealing himself today in bright F that's right that's right and the living will not preva vent amen this is the only age that will not prevent there was other ages that prevented from taking the full and complete Authority but we are in the days of the full age where we take it by force Hallelujah now Ephesian AGS lost their first love and they were losing out that's right I'm talking to people today who will have their first love yes amen did you hear what I said they lost their first love I'm preaching to people tonight that will have their first love amen amen yes sir amen now some of you it's not there but I have a promise for you it's being restored amen you can have your first love again amen you can have a fresh and up to-date experience with God again yeah absolutely the theasian age lost it but you can regain it cuz this is the hour of restoration amen like a seed that is planted and begins to deteriorate and the life changes form from seed to sprout and even so Ephesus would deteriorate and she loses her first love and and by and and then there was another reason why they were not raptured and then there there were other names that were on the book that were not yet manifested the Earth and one by one the early church was laid in the ground they had to go to sleep and wait for the time of the manifestations of the sons of God but let me tell you dry bones shall live again amen but here now comes the full word in the bride amen God told Brother Bron pick up your pen and start writing yes pick up your pen

amen amen I I don't know what you thought we entered into but we have entered into yes sir that kind of ministry we're way up the road soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have Rapture

worry brother Matt it'll be there amen that's the ministry we're entering into and we got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go but don't worry it'll be here it'll be there and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring its Brethren when the power of that church Rises it'll bring its Brethren and the power of that church will bring the other Brethren and there will be a general Resurrection amen hallelujah when the power rises in this church in the body of Believers and the bride it'll bring the dead in Christ when that when that the Lassa went down the grave come up they'll call their Brethren and they will called their Brethren and they will call their Brethren and then there will be a general resurrection of all the Seven Ages now we're in this end time end of this time each man has looked at the end of his Junction for the coming of Christ but they got a lot to look forward to the return of the Jews and the flying saucers and the sky and all things that we see but we're at the end we are here now they knew the church was to receive power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because as a shadow becomes deeper and deeper and reflects more you can take a shade further away from the shade the least reflection you get of the shade and while the shade gets closer and closer to the tree the the shade is made the same thing and then in other words the negative becomes a positive now the spirit of God has worked under justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the very same things it did when it was in Christ what is it Christ and the church has become one and as soon as they connect together that last link hey you may be here tonight the last [Applause] link amen you may be the very one that needs to get on board and start hi in this wave of glory amen and as they as soon as they connect together the last link she'll go through the sky shouting and up will come Wesley Luther and all the rest of them back in the days there he that is first will be last and he that last to be first then will come the resurrection we're at the end time that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification just a light shadow of it San Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the holy goes by baptism of it a a deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of its very person being in here forming signs and wonders like he did in the beginning Glory going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow you might as well get started all I asked is when the last time you were called a Holy Roller Amen brother Bron preached the whole sermon on why I'm why I am a Holy Roller amen then then in Elijah in a meal offering he said that and this is after that that he comes along he said that during the days of Luther we live by justification during the days of Wesley we live by sanctification the church becoming the minority in the days of Pentecost we have lived down through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts now we're really in the minority the coming of the Son of God here they believe by faith here they shouted under sanctification here they spoke in tongues as a gift but now the negative and the positive the cap is coming on the pyramid it is the end time when Christ and his church is so much alike till it's going to call the Dead from the Methodist Lutheran and all back there and there will be a resurrection those that fell asleep in the first 2 third fourth fifth sixth and seventh watch will rise one of these days to meet Jesus in the sky the hour has arrived hallelujah amen now listen as long as God's got a church he's going to have somebody that's that's got the Holy Ghost marching with it amen intellectuals will rise but God's got a minority somewhere that will ride there on the move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost claiming that light amen as he said the first will be last and them that are last will be first I won't know nothing about sanki and Moody and their Resurrection they know nothing about me and L one but I'll Stand in this one to give testimony and through that by the scattering of your light and the baptism of the Holy Spirit by the lives that you live and the things that God has done to prove that he's moving here with their intellectuals walked away from it they'll be judged by the Saints they are already judged they're already passed it Jesus here confirmation of his commission Jesus is so close to coming to the earth now amen until his power is begun to catch the people and winding them up getting ready for the bride get him ready to be caught up in the Rapture a church that a fit just exactly to be taken up through its power will draw the rest of them that's born again out of the earth hallelujah amen aren't you glad for that listen to him in three kinds of believer that's the reason I believe when the bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life there come a sound from Heaven that it take such a baptism of the holy spirit in that bride that had take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace amen hallelujah amen the holy spirit is moving yes sir amen the Dynamics of this church is a refilling of the Holy Ghost yes sir get the betterness out of your life get the doubt the fear the unbelief get purged by the Holy Ghost let him wash and make you clean amen get aware that the spirit of God can flow to this church and flow in the songs flow in the preaching Hallelujah we wave after wave after wave of the glory come until that wave reaches the dead in Christ and they rise wave after wave

that possible he didn't say if he said he said no if you say yes and he and and he he's struggling all that time is g a revelation said when you know the secrets to people's heart you think that's you that knows that when you're able to predict this and say that and prophesy and this comes to pass and know this about that person you think that's you doing that and brother brandom called it said no Lord that's not me that's you and he said I thought right then that any child of God how many children of God we got in here tonight any child of God all you had to do was be willing to live up there in those fears with God and it wouldn't be you thinking it wouldn't be you speaking it it would be God thinking it and speaking it through you yes is that what you desire tonight friends that's the freedom that you're entitled to why shouldn't you have it am you're entitled to it Christ purchased it for you Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost is given for amen my goodness I better sing some more before I start preaching you know something that really struck my heart night I thought about brother Tim just mentioned it now you go back there and you you go back into 2 Samuel and Samuel records the words of King David and that's where David come down there and said you know I I I ran through a troop and I leapt over well he's not saying I could do it he said I did do it yes I did do it I'm telling you I've done it yes and if you go right up above that you'll read why David said he could do that he said because I kept your word I walked in righteousness and you judge me by my righteous heart I kept your statutes and that's that's why I could do that let me tell you something friends don't run away from the enemy because the presence of God might be waiting on you in that troop the presence of God might be waiting on for you at that wall oh I say we are to charge forward and take everything back that the enemy has ever taken from us how many believe it that way oh my Eli Elisha was so troubled that the king he said take your arrow said aim it out Eastward and the King did so and he said now shoot and he shot and he said you have victory over Syria and he said now take the take the quiver and strike it on the ground and the king one two three and stopped and the prophet was so angry he said you should have struck it five or six times then you could have annihilated your enemy completely completely instead you're only going to get three victories now that's a sad case because there was nothing the king could do about it you know why cuz Elijah Elisha died that's right there's no way to come back and read couldn't go back to the grave and say Elisha oh please come back and and tell me to do it again this time I'll strike five or six times you have an advantage tonight friends the Holy Ghost is still alive the Holy Ghost is still alive and he's in this building tonight and if you only ever struck three say Lord give me another chance oh strike till my enemy is completely destroyed oh blessed be the name of the Lord that's just that's our testimony tonight say Lord I want to strike that enemy till he's completely destroyed in my life father we thank you we thank you Jesus for this wonderful word that we've had oh God yes L father it's true and we believe it we're Believers tonight Lord yes Lord we take the name of Jesus we put it upon our lips we speak it in faith if you say to this mountain oh Lord God how many things in our lives look just like a mountain unmovable oh wow but Lord if there's anyone in here willing to live in those spheres with God yes Lord oh Lamb of God if any if anyone's willing to take God at his word and just believe it and dedicate their life consecrated consecration to God that's the secret to power friends Lord Lord I pray you'll help us tonight father take every promise of God bring it into a reality we'll bring it we'll speak it into a reality because it won't be me speaking it'll be Christ speaking won't be my thought about it won't be me saying my children will all be saved it'll be Christ saying all of my children to be saved it won't me be saying my cancer is gone it'll be Christ saying my cancer is gone oh Lamb of God move in that way Lord anoint the people to believe it just like that Lord oh May there be fresh dedication in our hearts tonight Lord God we love you Lord we
