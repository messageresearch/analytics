[6:27] this morning amen amen let's turn into
[6:30] the Bible we're going to start at St
[6:32] John chapter 14 and then we're going to
[6:36] go to Genesis after that Genesis 32 so
[6:39] St John
[6:40] 14 and we're going to just read two
[6:44] verses St John
[6:47] 14 16 and
[6:52] 17 and it says and I will pray the
[6:56] father and he shall give you another
[6:57] comforter that he may abide with you
[6:59] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[7:03] the world cannot receive because it
[7:05] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[7:09] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[7:13] shall be in you amen and then let's turn
[7:16] over into the Book of Genesis the 32nd
[7:21] chapter Genesis 32 we're going to read a
[7:26] good portion of this chapter this
[7:27] morning Genesis 32 we'll start at verse
[7:29] one and it says and Jacob went on his
[7:31] way and the angels of God met him and
[7:35] when the Angels saw him he called the
[7:37] name of that place
[7:40] mahanahan and Jacob sent Messengers
[7:42] before him to Esau his brother under the
[7:44] land of sear the country of Edom and he
[7:47] commanded them saying thus shall ye
[7:49] speak unto unto my Lord Esau thy servant
[7:53] Jacob saith thus I have sojourned with
[7:56] laben and stayed there until now and I
[7:58] have oxen and ax asses and flocks and
[8:00] Men servants and women servants and I
[8:03] have sent to tell my Lord that I may
[8:05] find Grace in thy sight and The
[8:07] Messengers returned to Jacob saying we
[8:11] came to thy brother Esau and also he
[8:13] cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him
[8:16] then Jacob was greatly afraid and
[8:18] distressed and he divided the people
[8:20] that was with him and the flocks and the
[8:21] herds and the camels into two bands and
[8:23] said if Esau come to one company and
[8:27] smite it then the other company which is
[8:30] left shall escape and Jacob said oh god
[8:33] of My Father Abraham and God of my
[8:35] father Isaac the Lord which saith unto
[8:37] me return unto thy country and to thy
[8:39] Kindred and I will deal well with thee I
[8:42] am not worthy of the least of all thy
[8:44] mercies and of all thy truth which thou
[8:46] has showed unto thy servant for with my
[8:48] staff I passed over this Jordan and now
[8:50] I am become two bands deliver me I pray
[8:53] thee from the hand of my brother from
[8:55] the he from the hand of Esau for I fear
[8:58] Him lest he will come and smite me and
[8:59] the mother with the children and thou
[9:02] said I will surely do thee good and make
[9:05] thy seed as the sand of the sea which
[9:07] cannot be numbered for the multitude and
[9:09] down we're going to skip some verses go
[9:11] down to verse 22 and he rose up that
[9:13] night and took his two wives and his two
[9:15] women servants and his 11 sons and
[9:17] passed over the
[9:18] for Jabbok and he took them and sent
[9:21] them over the brook and sent all that he
[9:23] had and Jacob was left alone Jacob was
[9:26] left alone and there Wrestled a man with
[9:28] him until the waking of the day and when
[9:30] he saw that he prevailed not against him
[9:32] he touched the hollow of his thigh and
[9:34] the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of
[9:36] joint as he wrestled with him and he
[9:38] said let me go for the day breth and he
[9:41] said I will not let thee go except thou
[9:44] blessed me and he bless me and he said
[9:47] unto him what is thy name and he said
[9:48] Jacob and he said thy name shall be
[9:50] called No More Jacob but Israel for as a
[9:53] prince hast thou power with God and with
[9:55] man and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked
[9:58] him and said tell me I pray thee thy
[10:00] name and he said wherefore is it that
[10:01] thou do ask after my name and he blessed
[10:04] him there and Jacob called the name of
[10:07] that place pineal for I have seen God
[10:09] face to face and my life is pre
[10:12] preserved and as he passed over penuel
[10:14] the sun rose upon him and he halted upon
[10:17] his thigh therefore the children of
[10:19] Israel eat not of the senu which shrank
[10:22] which is upon the hollow of the thigh
[10:23] under this day because he touched the
[10:25] hollow of Jacob's thigh in the senu that
[10:27] shrink God bless you as you take your
[10:29] seats this morning sorry that was a
[10:31] lengthy reading but this example in
[10:34] Jacob's life has really been dealing
[10:36] with me lately just these past several
[10:38] days how many times in our life does God
[10:42] have to wrestle with us in things Amen
[10:45] to bend us from and Shake us from our
[10:49] will in certain situations amen you know
[10:51] and when you go read this circumstance
[10:54] in Jacob's life the win that from that
[10:57] wrestling match was it signifying that
[11:00] he somehow overpowered the angel of the
[11:03] Lord cuz when you you know when you
[11:04] wrestle God the only way to win is in
[11:07] complete submission amen so God God
[11:10] wasn't looking for him to prove his
[11:12] strength he wasn't looking for Jacob to
[11:15] prove his physical strength amen and you
[11:17] know when you read at the beginning of
[11:19] that chapter even earlier in his life
[11:21] you know God had encounters or Jacob had
[11:25] encounters with God and with angels amen
[11:28] the title for this morning his
[11:29] encounters with God but none of those
[11:32] encounters that he had was able to shake
[11:35] Jacob enough to rid him of that old
[11:38] nature to change his name to change the
[11:42] way that he walked until one day God let
[11:45] him into a position and he backed Jacob
[11:48] into this corner you know God wasn't
[11:50] just going to hand it over to him on a
[11:52] silver platter amen he he wanted to make
[11:55] sure this time that Jacob was willing to
[11:58] truly surrender you know I believe that
[12:00] God knows all things amen we all believe
[12:02] that this morning and he knew that Jacob
[12:05] was terrified of the future you know he
[12:07] he was meeting his brother Esau and and
[12:09] he had just left one moment of fear if
[12:11] you go read and and he had just left
[12:13] laan and and left I think in the middle
[12:15] of the night and took his flocks and
[12:17] then laan ended up catching up with him
[12:20] and so he find one situation where he
[12:22] was running and right now now he's in
[12:24] another situation so he had one critical
[12:26] juncture to another amen and he ran into
[12:28] this situ ation with his brother who you
[12:31] know 20 something years earlier Jacob
[12:33] had deceived and then he ran from
[12:35] because he was afraid that Esau was was
[12:37] going to kill him you know but God
[12:39] always has the right timing in our life
[12:41] amen and it was at this time in Jacob's
[12:44] life that God could finally appear to
[12:46] him and make known unto him the promise
[12:50] that was always ordained for his life
[12:53] you know Jacob was always ordained to
[12:55] life he was always Isaac's son he was
[12:58] always a son of ab Abraham God always
[13:01] had plans for his life but you watch in
[13:03] his life how some how that old nature
[13:06] kept bleeding through into his decisions
[13:09] and into into the way that he walked
[13:10] into the into the things that he did and
[13:12] how that fear was the thing that that
[13:14] drove him in so many things until he
[13:17] came to pineal and came face to face
[13:20] with God as the scripture says you know
[13:23] God is always trying to show you and I
[13:26] who we are really supposed to be you
[13:28] know he said sends he sends his word you
[13:30] know when when Pastor give delivers the
[13:32] sermon you know he sends some of us
[13:34] parents that that train us the word of
[13:36] God and and show you what it means to be
[13:39] a believer and show you train you in the
[13:41] way that you should go you know and he
[13:43] sends bits of inspiration throughout
[13:45] your life you know if you go back and
[13:47] you read about Jacob you know just a few
[13:49] chapters earlier he had come to that
[13:51] experience at bethl where he saw the
[13:54] angels
[13:56] of he had encounter with God he had
[14:00] encounters with angels and he had that
[14:03] vision and and at that point God had
[14:06] actually told him the truth about his
[14:08] lineage and when he came to this this
[14:10] point in this chapter he had actually
[14:11] reminded him God Jacob was reminding God
[14:14] of that of that of that promise but that
[14:17] experience at Pinel wasn't until four
[14:20] chapters later a place where finally
[14:23] Jacob was ready for a total submission a
[14:26] full submission he wasn't willing to
[14:29] leave that place until God blessed him
[14:32] amen he wasn't willing to let go of the
[14:35] presence of that angel until he knew
[14:38] without a shadow of doubt that he had
[14:40] received something from it amen he had
[14:44] received something f it so it's not
[14:46] until you come to a critical place in
[14:49] your life you know you could you could
[14:52] accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[14:54] savior but have you come into a place in
[14:56] your life where you haven't had just had
[14:58] an encounter with God but you've had
[15:01] this kind of an encounter with God where
[15:03] you can say that I've set face to face
[15:05] and now it's changed the way that I walk
[15:08] it's changed my name it's changed my
[15:10] nature
[15:12] amen even um you know he was always
[15:15] meant to be that patriarch but so many
[15:18] of his decisions reflected that old
[15:21] nature you know and when you go read uh
[15:22] the book of Hosea it even says that from
[15:25] his very birth that he was that he was
[15:27] grabbing the heel of Esau you know it
[15:29] was inherent in his very nature to be
[15:31] that way but once he came face to face
[15:34] with God something really changed amen
[15:37] something changed the way that he walked
[15:40] amen you know and when when that old
[15:43] nature that we're all born with is still
[15:47] in control of your life it bleeds
[15:49] through into your actions it bleeds
[15:51] through in the way that you think it
[15:53] bleeds through in the way that you live
[15:55] amen it it's still in your character you
[15:58] know you know the prophet of God is two
[16:01] specific places if you go and listen to
[16:03] these sermons two specific places but he
[16:05] says it several times says the evidence
[16:07] of the Holy Ghost is saying Amen to
[16:09] every word Feast of trumpets and church
[16:11] the church age book were two places he
[16:13] makes that so clear but with your life
[16:16] amen it's displayed in your actions not
[16:20] just by letter or word I believe you say
[16:23] I believe okay well now put put take the
[16:26] letter from the speech and make it a
[16:28] living reality that's what is the
[16:31] identification amen cuz he changes the
[16:34] way that you live from the inside out
[16:37] not a manufactured thing amen um you
[16:40] know much of the world this has just
[16:42] been really heavy on my heart especially
[16:44] last two days much of the world I
[16:45] believe is deceiving themselves to say
[16:49] that you believe in Jesus amen because
[16:52] to truly believe in something it's
[16:54] evident in the way that you live it's
[16:56] evident in the actions you take it's
[16:58] evident in the speech you use it's
[17:00] evident in every aspect of your life so
[17:03] to say that I believe something but then
[17:05] the actions of your life aren't
[17:07] measuring up with what you believe then
[17:09] you don't truly believe that thing you
[17:12] say I believe the message of the hour
[17:13] well if your life isn't measured up to
[17:16] everything God says in that message then
[17:18] you don't believe it
[17:20] amen I believe a key a key difference is
[17:24] that once you have what John 14
[17:27] describes as the spirit of truth
[17:29] dwelling within you it's no longer you
[17:33] trying to fit God into some box in your
[17:36] life amen into a category like he's some
[17:40] material possession that you carry
[17:42] around with you like just for an example
[17:45] you you kick your keys with you right or
[17:47] you take your phone with you but then
[17:50] when you go somewhere and you leave that
[17:52] thing in the car then it's really not
[17:53] with you it's more of a it's more of a
[17:55] possession and I believe that that
[17:57] sometimes is what Jesus is to a lot of
[18:00] people because it's just it's just a
[18:02] possession you take him with you
[18:04] sometimes but then sometimes you leave
[18:06] them in the car or sometimes you leave
[18:08] him at home amen it's important to know
[18:10] that it is not a material possession to
[18:13] have a relationship with Jesus it is an
[18:15] actual Fellowship that you have he lives
[18:18] within you he indwells inside of you
[18:21] amen it is something that you take with
[18:23] you everywhere you go in everything you
[18:25] do amen you know sometimes you know when
[18:29] you you go you go somewhere you go to
[18:31] work or you go to school or you're in
[18:32] your Recreation and you know he's
[18:35] probably maybe staying in the car
[18:36] because is he comfortable where you are
[18:39] amen that's that's that's a it's a
[18:41] crucial question to ask because there's
[18:44] there's experiences with God and then
[18:46] there's a pineal experience that each
[18:49] one of us have to have where we take
[18:51] experiences and we make them a living
[18:53] reality within our soul
[18:57] amen we can't we can't put him into an
[19:01] area where he's something rather than
[19:04] being someone amen because there's a
[19:08] clear distinction between the two much
[19:10] of the world I believe is deceiving
[19:12] themselves because to him to them he's
[19:15] something rather than someone
[19:19] amen he becomes the the very driving
[19:23] point of every decision you make not
[19:26] because he has not because it has to but
[19:28] because you want to amen it becomes the
[19:31] very core of your being Amen to to to
[19:34] see what the word says about it and and
[19:37] to match up with what the word says
[19:38] because I am that word amen we are that
[19:41] word I I always have some quotes I want
[19:44] to go through this morning you know
[19:47] um just to refresh uh Refresh on that
[19:52] 1417 that even the spirit of Truth whom
[19:54] the world cannot receive because it
[19:56] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[19:59] know him for he dwelleth in you and
[20:00] shall be in you and with him the spirit
[20:02] of Christ Living in you and his actions
[20:06] are living through you you know nobody
[20:08] nobody knows nobody knows the heart
[20:11] except for God right you know but the
[20:13] manifestation of your actions in your
[20:16] everyday nature in your church
[20:17] attendance in the way that you act and
[20:20] the way that you dress and the way that
[20:21] you talk even the way you react makes it
[20:23] known which nature is ruling and
[20:25] reigning in your heart and I have this
[20:27] in my notes later on in in here but this
[20:29] isn't for someone to look at your
[20:31] brother or your sister and say well they
[20:32] don't have it they don't have this is
[20:33] all for self introspection you look at
[20:36] something like this and you say not not
[20:38] my brother not my sister but me oh Lord
[20:41] do I have that right now I'm not looking
[20:43] at everybody else it's not about
[20:45] everybody else it's about you
[20:47] individually recognizing amen what it is
[20:50] that you need to be doing um it's it
[20:52] it's is it the nature of Christ or is it
[20:55] the nature of Caleb Campbell amen which
[20:58] one one is really ruling right now he
[21:01] says in going beyond the camp 1964
[21:04] paragraph 89 he says now brother sister
[21:06] do you know that each one of us each one
[21:08] of you all must sacrifice you must be
[21:11] God's sacrifice you sacrifice the things
[21:14] of the world you sacrifice your own
[21:16] pleasures of this world you sacrifice
[21:18] everything uh you sacrifice the things
[21:20] of the world you know the reason that
[21:23] people won't do it he says you know a
[21:25] sheep a sheep don't have one thing to
[21:27] offer and that's War
[21:29] and now he's not asked to produce or to
[21:31] manufacture some wool for this year he's
[21:34] asked to Bear wool so we're not asked he
[21:37] says to manufacture something we're
[21:39] asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit
[21:42] that is inside of the sheep what he is
[21:44] on the inside makes the wool on the
[21:47] outside and when a man has got Christ on
[21:50] the inside it makes him Christlike on
[21:53] the outside not some artificial put on
[21:56] and it's so important because I
[21:59] you have to recognize that it's from the
[22:01] inside out amen that those things happen
[22:04] because if you try to manufacture and
[22:06] it's from the outside in you're going to
[22:07] be straining he always I can't remember
[22:09] where the quote is but he says you're
[22:11] going to be straining your whole life
[22:12] because it's a it's a legalist style of
[22:15] things you're trying to manufacture
[22:17] something when you just need to get him
[22:19] on the inside and then naturally it
[22:21] comes out
[22:23] amen but making the valley full of
[22:25] ditches 1956 he says show me your
[22:27] company and I'll I'll tell you who you
[22:29] are let me walk into your house let me
[22:31] see what's laying open on your table let
[22:32] me see what what the Bible's marked up
[22:35] let me see where where it's the old
[22:36] stories let me listen to what kind of
[22:39] music you're playing on the radio let me
[22:41] see what kind of pictures you got in
[22:43] your house and I'll Tell You What You're
[22:44] Made Of yes sir that's what your soul is
[22:47] feeding on regardless of what your
[22:50] testimony is and your your fruits prove
[22:53] what you are right oh it's the truth
[22:55] your soul feeds on something and
[22:57] whatever the Char characteristics of
[22:59] your soul is that's what it'll show
[23:01] forth that's the reason Jesus said by
[23:05] their fruit you shall know them amen by
[23:10] your fruit you shall know them and I
[23:12] have just been listening to um the
[23:15] sermon right after going beyond the camp
[23:17] it's the Feast of trumpets you go listen
[23:19] to that sermon because there's so many
[23:21] things in there where he's showing that
[23:23] when the son of man comes to reveal
[23:25] himself how are we going to know that
[23:27] it's the son of man revealing himself
[23:30] unto you it's because you're going to be
[23:32] constantly in the word amen you're going
[23:34] to be constantly in the word to be able
[23:37] to recognize that when he comes oh I
[23:39] know because I'm like him amen you know
[23:42] because you're like him go listen to
[23:43] that sermon because he makes it so
[23:46] clear brother random had this situation
[23:49] in his life um he he he was home one day
[23:53] and and the phone rang and you know he
[23:55] was right in the middle of this
[23:56] situation where there was some attorneys
[23:59] and they were bothering him so bad about
[24:01] some case that that they were in and
[24:03] they wouldn't they wouldn't leave him
[24:04] alone and they were continually calling
[24:06] his house and on this particular day he
[24:09] was actually getting ready to go pray
[24:10] for this sick little child in the
[24:12] hospital so he tells me to to tell them
[24:15] that he wasn't there and in doing that
[24:17] he he says well I'm going to go run
[24:19] around the back of the house and when I
[24:21] do that when I'm outside tell them that
[24:23] I'm not here amen and you know because
[24:26] that's sometimes what people do when
[24:29] even when you have the Holy Ghost and
[24:30] you make mistakes you you can justify
[24:33] certain things that you do in your life
[24:35] amen amen I'm so glad we have these
[24:37] things as examples because we're all
[24:39] guilty of that amen and you know Ma kind
[24:42] of looked at him funny but he but did
[24:44] what he said and when she hung up the
[24:46] phone and he came inside she told him
[24:48] that she didn't feel right about doing
[24:50] that and you know but then he started he
[24:53] started
[24:54] justifying you know the his actions
[24:56] there and who's ever who's ever been
[24:58] guilty of that amen but when he got to
[25:02] the hospital to go pray for that sick
[25:05] little child the Lord began dealing with
[25:07] him how can you pray for this sick
[25:10] little girl after you did what you did
[25:13] see he had to make things right before
[25:16] he could go on you know and he makes
[25:18] this reference in this sermon I'm going
[25:20] to quote a few things here but he makes
[25:21] this reference to 1 John 3:21 if our
[25:24] hearts condemn us not then we have
[25:27] confidence in in God and when the
[25:29] prophet was telling that story he quoted
[25:31] that scripture he said that's what's the
[25:33] matter today with the Christian Church
[25:35] they can't get anything done is because
[25:36] our hearts are condemning us for
[25:39] unconfessed sin it's not easy for him
[25:42] he's saying about this story it's not
[25:44] easy for me to tell this it's not easy
[25:48] for us to make those things right but
[25:50] it's the truth and that's the way to be
[25:54] truthful he says you know it's such a
[25:56] simple thing but it's so powerful here
[25:59] God was trying to get Jacob to recognize
[26:01] his position amen and God in
[26:05] this us recognize your position amen
[26:09] that there's nothing that can stand
[26:11] between you and your prayers but you
[26:13] have to come to a place where you're in
[26:15] complete submission where when you have
[26:17] a situation like this brother mat
[26:19] preached that condemnation versus
[26:20] conviction as Christians there's no
[26:22] condemnation but there is conviction
[26:24] amen and so when you have a conviction
[26:27] placed in your heart you need to make
[26:28] that thing right you know because we're
[26:30] going to read this because brother
[26:32] brandom when he did that and he had to
[26:34] go make that thing right it wasn't just
[26:36] oh you know Lord I'm sorry for this that
[26:38] there's no sincerity in that he went to
[26:40] MAA he went down to the attorney's
[26:42] office he knocked on the door then he
[26:45] went and the most important part of this
[26:47] is he went into his cave and he prayed
[26:49] for eight hours about a situation where
[26:52] he was just justifying something that
[26:54] most of us maybe wouldn't even think
[26:56] twice about but it is in important that
[26:58] we recognize that the spirit of truth
[27:01] that lives inside of you knows that
[27:03] these things are so important because if
[27:05] our hearts condemn us not then we can
[27:07] have confidence in God and nothing can
[27:09] stand in between our prayers
[27:11] amen there's there's two classifications
[27:14] here that that I'm that I'm trying to
[27:16] identify in this teaching and like I
[27:19] said earlier not for us to look at
[27:21] everybody else or anybody else really
[27:24] and try to identify but for each of us
[27:26] to do some self-reflection and really
[27:28] look at where you're at cuz one there's
[27:32] the two classifications there's ones
[27:34] that have already had a changed nature
[27:38] amen yet they make mistakes amen like
[27:41] what brother random did I believe he was
[27:42] born again of the spirit of God and he
[27:44] made that mistake but God corrected him
[27:46] amen but then two the ones that have had
[27:49] experiences with God like Jacob did at
[27:52] bethl but hadn't come to their pineal
[27:55] experience yet and truly had their
[27:58] nature changed amen they haven't come
[28:01] face to face with God and wrestled until
[28:05] they've fully submitted to his word amen
[28:08] and allowed him to change their name
[28:12] amen and change the way that they walk
[28:15] amen those things they're for our
[28:17] example amen he changed the way he
[28:19] walked that's a spiritual uh spiritual
[28:22] type of you changing the way that you
[28:24] walk it's it's you're going in One
[28:26] Direction God gets a hold of your life
[28:28] you're going in the other direction from
[28:30] now on Amen everything you do is now
[28:32] revolved around what God is doing for
[28:34] you amen and that's so important because
[28:38] it's important to know what place that
[28:41] you're in amen it's important because
[28:43] it's the difference having un experience
[28:46] with God and having that experience with
[28:48] God where your nature is completely
[28:50] changed is so important it's the
[28:52] difference Saints between making a
[28:54] Rapture and not you know because a lot
[28:55] of people I believe are going to be
[28:57] surprised the ible says surprised on
[28:59] that day when the dead Saints rise the
[29:01] Lord takes his family home to the
[29:03] marriage supper and it's time to go into
[29:05] a resurrection when they didn't make it
[29:07] and they'll find themselves in a
[29:09] tribulation period because they've never
[29:11] met God face to face and fully submitted
[29:14] they've had experiences of God they've
[29:16] had that experience but remember in that
[29:18] experience he came to that angel and
[29:20] that angel tried to leave but Jacob said
[29:23] no I'm not letting you leave until I
[29:25] know for sure that I've been blessed
[29:28] amen you've got to come to a place in
[29:29] your life where you know that you know
[29:32] that I've had that nature change amen
[29:36] wow many people have experiences with
[29:39] God Amen all the time all throughout
[29:42] their life but until they come to a
[29:44] place where they let the word have
[29:46] dominion in their life see Jacob was
[29:50] tired of his old nature taking control
[29:53] so what did he do he stayed all night
[29:57] because he was was ready he would have
[29:58] stayed all week he would have stayed all
[30:00] month because he was ready for God to
[30:03] change his very nature and it I believe
[30:06] the Bible is particular about how they
[30:08] word thing how it words
[30:10] things when he came in Genesis
[30:14] 32:26 he says the Ang and he said the
[30:17] angel he said let me go for the day
[30:19] break and he said I will not let thee go
[30:21] except thou bless me and many people I
[30:24] was fellowshipping with my dad about
[30:25] this many people get this far in their
[30:27] walk with God God that they get close to
[30:30] that baptism of the Holy Ghost and they
[30:32] may walk the line for a time but then
[30:35] they allow the enemy to come in and
[30:37] settle their mind down to think that
[30:40] this is as far as you need to go but
[30:42] there was further that Jacob needed to
[30:44] go there amen I know that that there
[30:46] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[30:48] Ghost but that at that time but this is
[30:50] an examples they we use the Bible as
[30:52] examples for the for for the New
[30:53] Testament amen and he said unto him what
[30:55] is thy name and he said Jacob it was
[30:58] until the two verses later that he
[31:00] changed his name from Jacob to Israel am
[31:03] two verses later that is the difference
[31:06] you brother brandom makes this he makes
[31:08] a statement my dad sent me this quote a
[31:11] few months ago I was trying to find it
[31:12] last night finally found it St Augustine
[31:15] had an opportunity once so says the
[31:17] history to become a great man and be
[31:19] filled with the Holy Ghost he sit in the
[31:22] back of the yard there in Lion's France
[31:24] at that great
[31:26] school yard and the whole the Holy Ghost
[31:28] came to him but he refused to accept it
[31:33] then what did he become a two-fold more
[31:35] child of Hell than he was to begin with
[31:36] he was right down to hippo Africa where
[31:38] he sat down and it was I can take you to
[31:40] the history he was the one who
[31:41] sanctioned the word to do it that it was
[31:44] all right to put to death any heretic
[31:46] who would disagree with the dogmas of
[31:47] the Roman Church St Augustine of Hippo
[31:50] is there a Bible brother this is brother
[31:52] brandom saying this in Christianity
[31:53] versus idolatry is there a Bible scholar
[31:55] here raise up your hand you um see there
[31:57] they St Augustine of Hippo he was the
[32:00] one who passed the verdict that said it
[32:02] was all right to kill Heretics who
[32:04] disagreed with the Roman Church shaning
[32:06] them Pagan doctrine of getting away from
[32:08] the Bible and establishing a son God
[32:10] worship he came to a place where he had
[32:13] an opportunity to receive the baptism of
[32:15] the Holy Ghost the prophet said and he
[32:17] turned it
[32:19] away and you know what what brother
[32:22] Brenham did we just talked about this he
[32:24] didn't just say that he was sorry he it
[32:28] it was at the very core of his being
[32:30] that he needed to make this thing right
[32:33] amen and he went and I just want to I
[32:35] just want to go through this quote here
[32:37] just a few more minutes uh thinking on
[32:39] our way 1959 and he says and I prayed
[32:41] all day long I said Lord God I did wrong
[32:44] and I caused my wife to do wrong don't
[32:46] hold it against her Lord please forgive
[32:48] us I want to stay clean before you Lord
[32:49] that's what I'm called to pray for the
[32:51] sick children and there'll be no
[32:53] condemnation in my heart I want to be
[32:55] right and that condemns me I couldn't
[32:56] pray for that little baby
[32:58] will you forgive me and I prayed and
[33:00] wept in there from about 7:00 one
[33:02] morning till about 3:00 or 4 in the
[33:03] afternoon there's a big rock layer that
[33:06] leaves at the M thee and it faces the
[33:07] East way back in the jungles and woods
[33:09] and I came out and got on this rock
[33:11] raised up my hands and just praised the
[33:12] Lord and I was standing there thinking
[33:14] on my ways amen we ought to stand there
[33:16] and think on our ways sometimes said
[33:18] Lord did I why did I ever do such a
[33:20] thing why could a man get so bothered
[33:22] but I'm so glad that you love me that
[33:24] you let me think of it that you revealed
[33:27] it to me that told me I was wrong that
[33:29] means you want me to do right that you
[33:31] loved me you ought to thank God when he
[33:33] condemns you for your sins and the
[33:35] things as you're thinking on your ways
[33:37] amen um we just have a minute here so
[33:41] I'm going to skip the rest of that quote
[33:42] but he said you know
[33:45] there's you know when you have that
[33:47] nature change you can still make
[33:51] mistakes amen but something is different
[33:54] from that time in your heart because
[33:56] that situation
[33:58] you know to the average Joe just was a
[34:02] situation that happened and they
[34:03] Justified it but to a Son of God it
[34:06] meant everything amen it's so important
[34:09] to examine our lives and see which
[34:14] nature is truly controlling you not the
[34:17] Sunday Morning View that people see it's
[34:19] the Monday afternoons the Tuesday nights
[34:21] the Friday nights the friends you choose
[34:24] the job you choose the things you wear
[34:25] yes I know that those are outward manif
[34:27] EST but brother renom said water baptism
[34:30] is also outward manifestation of an
[34:33] inward work amen so the outward
[34:34] manifestation is also important because
[34:37] it reveals what's on the inside amen and
[34:39] it has to be something so personal that
[34:41] takes place with you you know and you
[34:43] know Jacob had brought his family with
[34:46] Him scripture says this specifically but
[34:49] he was left alone when he wrestled with
[34:52] that
[34:53] Angel sometimes it's time to just get
[34:55] alone with God to think on your ways and
[34:58] have a pineal experience to encounter
[35:00] face that means encountering God face to
[35:03] face you know and it was always thought
[35:05] in the Old Testament if you ever came
[35:07] face to face with God you would die but
[35:10] God didn't want that he he couldn't be
[35:12] in your in your presence without that
[35:15] blood atonement that's why the Holy
[35:16] Ghost came so there was always a plan to
[35:19] reconcile you back to fellowship with
[35:22] him to have his spirit indwelling inside
[35:24] of you amen and when you're and when you
[35:27] have have that face-to-face encounter
[35:30] don't leave that place until you walk
[35:33] different until you talk different until
[35:35] you know that your name has been changed
[35:38] you know what Jacob was doing when he
[35:39] wrestled wasn't showing his strength I
[35:42] know I'm a little over time just another
[35:43] minute he was he was showing his
[35:46] weakness through submission amen some
[35:49] people think that Christian experience
[35:51] is is just pure grit hold on to
[35:53] something until you can't hold on
[35:54] anymore but it's the opposite of that
[35:56] amen he's wanting you to let let go
