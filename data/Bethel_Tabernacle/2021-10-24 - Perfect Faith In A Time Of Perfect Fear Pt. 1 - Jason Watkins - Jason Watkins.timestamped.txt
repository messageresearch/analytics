[25:57] requests here we're going to take up
[25:59] some prayer requests and then i'm going

[26:05] abbreviate
[26:06] his worship service today
[26:08] and then i'm going to uh preach a
[26:10] shortened sermon it's a little bit of a
[26:13] it's okay i'll get to finish it on

[26:16] announcement that our wednesday service
[26:18] on the 28th is moved uh one day forward
[26:21] to the 27th on tuesday so our midweek
[26:24] service will be this tuesday because
[26:26] much of our av team and a lot of our
[26:28] equipment is going to be gone
[26:30] to the camp
[26:31] and so i'll be sending out a whatsapp
[26:34] reminder uh in the first part of the
[26:36] week so the midweek will be this tuesday
[26:39] and then uh after i finish up we've got
[26:42] to have some really
[26:44] good testimonies we've got
[26:48] brother jack
[26:49] here who's going to give
[26:51] his testimony today
[26:53] and i should i should probably call it
[26:55] his explosion today
[26:58] because brother jack is a 220 volt uh
[27:01] plug and i'll tell you what if you grab
[27:03] a hold of him you know it amen so but i
[27:06] appreciate somebody who's excited about
[27:08] his christianity who loves serving god
[27:10] brother jack loves being a christian
[27:13] amen he enjoys it thoroughly and you get
[27:16] around him and you'll start enjoying it
[27:18] amen so amen and and uh what the lord
[27:22] did marvelously supernaturally for
[27:24] sister kathy
[27:25] and uh you you you know the you were
[27:28] living it with us you were in prayer for
[27:30] our sister and she goes from an
[27:32] emergency life flight and 48 hours later
[27:35] they can't even find anything wrong with
[27:37] her so
[27:38] that's just god amen

[27:53] uh also have brother mark uh come
[27:57] and give a testimony for us
[27:59] and um
[28:01] and and i'm gonna have to skip over it
[28:03] quick because if i get to talking about
[28:05] that i won't hold up but
[28:07] amen you know to to have lost such a
[28:10] dear friend
[28:11] three times
[28:13] amen the devil took his took him three
[28:15] times and the lord gave him back every
[28:18] time
[28:19] and so i think the devil finally got
[28:21] discouraged and left

[28:27] supernatural experience with brother jd
[28:31] amen who will then

[32:01] several
[32:02] that have come through our prayer lines
[32:04] there at home
[32:05] and to my knowledge the lord has healed
[32:08] every single one of them
[32:11] and uh the one that he uh
[32:15] healed ultimately he took him home to
[32:16] glory amen and so
[32:19] that was the ultimate healing but the
[32:20] lord did take one of ours
[32:22] uh from us but uh that was
[32:25] orchestrated of the lord and so but the
[32:28] lord has healed every person that's come
[32:30] through our prayer line since i've been
[32:32] there it's just an amazing the people's
[32:35] faith is so high and so

[40:50] this morning and
[40:53] i'm going to be exceptionally studious
[40:55] today i'm not even going to try to get a
[40:58] whole thought out because i can get
[40:59] enough to be sufficient
[41:02] amen we're going to do
[41:03] amen i'm going to have one of those rare
[41:05] times where i'm going to fulfill what
[41:07] brother branham said and preach about a
[41:08] 30-minute sermon amen so and then we
[41:11] want to give plenty of time for our
[41:13] testimonies amen
[41:15] um and let's remember our prayer request
[41:18] as we
[41:19] get ready to go so we want to
[41:23] come this morning to first in romans
[41:25] chapter 8
[41:26] and we're going to catch a couple of
[41:28] verses there and then we'll catch a few
[41:31] in 2nd peter
[41:33] and we'll let you be seated and we'll
[41:34] continue to read a little bit
[41:36] amen
[41:39] i want to speak today on a title that
[41:42] i've chosen
[41:43] faith versus fear
[41:46] i didn't really expect to preach that
[41:49] today i actually had another sermon that
[41:52] i'm working on i told my wife i said i
[41:54] said you know just because we don't have
[41:55] church schedule i said that doesn't turn
[41:58] the gift off i said i got four or five
[42:00] sermons that have just been piling up
[42:02] and i've just been making notes in all
[42:04] of them it's not like you can just turn
[42:06] that off
[42:07] and so it just keeps coming and so amen
[42:10] we've got a lot of preaching we need to
[42:11] do here
[42:12] right after we get back after camp
[42:15] amen romans 8
[42:17] 14 to 15 for as many
[42:20] as are led by the spirit of god
[42:23] they are what
[42:25] the sons of god for ye have not
[42:28] received the spirit of bondage again to
[42:32] fear
[42:33] but ye have received the spirit of
[42:35] adoption
[42:36] whereby we cry
[42:38] abba father isn't it amazing
[42:41] that he would label the spirit of fear
[42:45] with bondage
[42:47] and i can tell you that is a
[42:49] universal truth that is an eternal
[42:52] principle fear hath torment
[42:56] fear is a bondage see and so
[43:00] i want to take today a title faith
[43:03] versus fear
[43:04] and i believe if i'm not mistaken i have
[43:07] a subtitle
[43:08] perfect faith in a time of perfect fear
[43:11] let's turn to second peter
[43:15] chapter one
[43:17] one of my favorite teaching places in
[43:20] the bible i've
[43:21] loved this for many years and have
[43:23] studied it and expounded it many times
[43:27] and
[43:28] first i'm sorry ii peter
[43:30] chapter 1 verses 8 through 12.
[43:34] now peter is going to make a case for
[43:37] the
[43:38] characteristics uh that are in christ
[43:41] see that are in the gene that is in you
[43:45] so when you're born again that's why
[43:47] brother branham would say
[43:48] everything you have needed for a rapture
[43:50] is in you
[43:52] it's not like god's got to put something
[43:53] to it what you've got to do is
[43:55] strengthen those things
[43:57] you've got a responsibility to make
[44:00] faith and virtue knowledge and
[44:01] temperaments and all these things strong
[44:04] these are the seven notable
[44:05] characteristics of deity that are to be
[44:08] living in as an expression through you
[44:11] that's what it means to be living for
[44:13] the to not miss the mark by missing the
[44:16] glory of god in your life we've been
[44:18] preaching on that so he says now
[44:20] concerning these characteristics verse 8
[44:23] for if these things be in you and abound
[44:26] here's the benefit they make you that ye
[44:29] should neither be barren nor unfruitful
[44:31] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[44:33] christ
[44:34] but he the watch he that lacketh these
[44:37] things in other words it's not saying
[44:40] that you've lost your salvation or
[44:42] you've lost your gene of god
[44:44] these things have just taken a backseat
[44:46] and you're not working on them
[44:48] all right
[44:49] the and here's what happens to you when
[44:51] you do that all right
[44:53] says but he that that is lacking in
[44:56] these things here's what happens to him
[44:58] he's blind
[44:59] he cannot see afar off and hath
[45:02] forgotten that he was purged from his
[45:03] old sin so you actually start dabbling
[45:06] back around in carnality forgetting god
[45:08] delivered you from that kind of stuff
[45:09] see
[45:10] wherefore the rather brother and give
[45:12] diligence
[45:14] to make your calling and election sure
[45:17] for if we if you do these things you
[45:19] shall never fall not a fringe benefit
[45:22] for so here's another one for so an
[45:23] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[45:25] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[45:28] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[45:30] wherefore i will not be negligent to put
[45:33] you always in remembrance of these
[45:35] things though you know them and be
[45:36] established in the present truth
[45:39] father we thank you for your
[45:42] word today master and we're asking for
[45:45] your great grace we've read it but now
[45:48] it will take you to come and deliver it
[45:50] father we're so thrilled to be here
[45:52] today give us of your spirit as we look
[45:54] into the bread of life we commit it to
[45:56] you and master for brother stephen
[45:58] buckles who even right now is struggling
[46:01] with hus with covid in the hospital a
[46:04] desperate wife asking for prayer lord we
[46:06] bind together as you've saved our
[46:09] brothers save this brother lord you're
[46:11] no respecter of persons reach out o god
[46:13] as brother dale was testifying you've
[46:15] saved their lot lord save this brother
[46:17] father i pray for our little
[46:20] brother mason that you will be with
[46:21] those doctors may it be a perfect repair
[46:24] a flawless repair that he wouldn't have
[46:26] any residual effect going forward lord
[46:29] first sister smith our dear sister smith
[46:32] lord strengthen her and we know that
[46:35] she's
[46:36] well aged and well stricken in years but
[46:38] you're still god you're still god
[46:41] there's not there's no scripture that
[46:42] says we have to leave the world sick
[46:45] lord many of your saints just age out
[46:47] and go home to their reward that doesn't
[46:49] mean they have to be sick we're asking
[46:51] for her deliverance today lord
[46:53] father you will call her home at her
[46:55] appointed hour as you will all of us so
[46:58] what if the devil now lord we know that
[47:00] he tries to run in sometimes and take
[47:03] take lives prematurely but that's not
[47:05] going to work for us lord we're not
[47:07] going to abide that we're not going to
[47:08] stand by and watch that happen we rebuke
[47:11] the enemy in the name of the lord jesus
[47:14] christ and ask for her complete
[47:16] deliverance in jesus name lord bless us
[47:19] all now one and all we pray in jesus

[47:49] is strong amen i'm just got to get mind
[47:51] and body re-completely rejuvenated
[47:54] amen now we want to also
[47:57] read while we have you seated ephesians
[48:00] chapter 6
[48:01] verses 10 to 18
[48:04] and then i'm going to
[48:06] give you some breakdowns from other
[48:08] translations on our reading from 2nd
[48:11] peter on my powerpoint but i want to get
[48:13] these texts read to you first so that
[48:15] you can be established in what we're
[48:16] trying to teach you this principle today
[48:19] ephesians 6
[48:21] 10-18
[48:23] finally my brethren
[48:25] be strong in the lord and in the power
[48:28] of his might
[48:29] put on the whole armor of god that you
[48:33] may be able to stand against the wiles
[48:35] of the devil now
[48:37] the first thing i want you to get your
[48:38] mind wrapped around
[48:40] is that paul in ephesians
[48:43] and peter in his epistle second peter
[48:46] chapter one where he's saying add to
[48:48] your faith virtue and add add to virtual
[48:50] knowledge and add to knowledge terms and
[48:52] add an ad and add and add an ad and and
[48:55] be fruitful and multiply these things
[48:57] and be strong this is what these are
[49:00] these are the exact same type of rubber
[49:03] meets the road lifestyle uh
[49:06] teaching that the apostles can give you
[49:09] today that
[49:10] it's not adding and adding faith and
[49:12] adding virtue and adding knowledge for
[49:14] the sake of knowledge and virtue there's
[49:17] a purpose behind it and the purpose
[49:19] behind it is that it puts on the armor
[49:21] of god and the purpose of having the
[49:24] armor of god is so you can defeat the
[49:25] devil
[49:27] and what i need to explain the purpose
[49:29] of defeating the devil
[49:31] i don't think anybody in here would need
[49:33] an explanation of why we need to be
[49:36] strong in our faith why we need to keep
[49:39] the devil under our feet
[49:42] do you realize friends that when the
[49:43] mighty angel descended in revelation 10
[49:46] 1 that he put his feet on the sea and on
[49:49] the land because showing that the old
[49:51] beast system that came up out of the sea
[49:54] and the and the last day beast that came
[49:56] up out of the land that christ had both
[49:58] of them under his feet
[50:01] both of them were under his feet there
[50:03] is no beast system today that has any
[50:05] jurisdiction over the bride of christ
[50:08] we are above that and every tyranny of
[50:11] the devil is under our feet
[50:15] that's why it even says he comes as a as
[50:17] a living cloud as a rainbow about his
[50:19] head because that's a covenant and his
[50:21] feet as pillars of fire not the pillar
[50:23] of fire his feet as pillars of fire
[50:26] because that's how he appeared in the
[50:28] upper room in the book of acts because
[50:31] that's a representation of christ
[50:33] dividing himself into his body and he
[50:35] comes in his body not corporally
[50:38] corporally comes at the end of the of
[50:40] the tribulation but he's here now in a
[50:43] mini-membered body uh the pillars of
[50:46] fire to show that every tyranny of the
[50:48] devil is under our feet
[50:51] [Applause]
[50:52] i thought the other day i'm gonna get a
[50:54] piece of scratch paper and i'm gonna
[50:56] write every need that i have that the
[50:58] enemy is attacking me on i'm gonna write
[51:01] a detailed request and i'm gonna slip my
[51:03] shoes off put it in my shoes put my feet
[51:05] back in it and i'm gonna walk around to
[51:07] show the devil that everything he's
[51:10] trying is under my feet
[51:12] [Music]
[51:12] [Applause]
[51:14] i'd invite you to do the same go home
[51:15] today write down every request stick
[51:17] them in your shoes wear them day and
[51:19] night
[51:20] and no matter what you see happening
[51:22] remind the devil you're under my feet
[51:24] buddy
[51:27] so this is why we put on the whole armor
[51:30] of god this is why you're encouraged to
[51:33] add to your faith don't just have it add
[51:35] to it
[51:37] because if these things be in you and
[51:38] abound the greek diaglot says if these
[51:41] things be in you and super abound
[51:44] then they not allow you
[51:47] to be
[51:48] to never be unfruitful they make you
[51:51] that you would never be unfruitful
[51:54] they make you have victory in your lives
[51:58] so verse 12 for we wrestle not
[52:01] against flesh and blood
[52:04] but against principalities
[52:07] against the i love the scripture watch
[52:09] this is so enlightening against
[52:11] principalities against powers
[52:14] against the rulers of the darkness of
[52:16] this world see they're not rulers of us
[52:19] they rule in darkness
[52:20] we're not we're not of the night as paul
[52:23] said to the thessalonian church in the
[52:25] fifth chapter we're of the day
[52:27] we're not of the night remember that
[52:29] we're of the day
[52:31] see we're we're not drunken in the night
[52:33] we're sober in the day amen and so we're
[52:36] not under his jurisdiction
[52:38] against spiritual wickedness in high
[52:40] places verse 13 wherefore wherefore
[52:43] see where peter said add to your faith
[52:45] virtue add your virtual knowledge paul
[52:46] says wherefore take unto you the whole
[52:48] armor of god they're saying the same
[52:49] thing
[52:50] that you may be able to withstand in the
[52:54] evil day and having done all to stand
[52:57] stand therefore having your loins girded
[53:00] about having your virtue added to your
[53:03] faith having knowledge attitude virtue
[53:04] having temperance added to your
[53:06] knowledge you're you're having having
[53:08] done all then stand there for having
[53:10] your loins gird about with truth and
[53:12] having on the breastplate of
[53:14] righteousness have brotherly kindness
[53:16] strong have temperance strong amen
[53:20] have your faith strong
[53:23] see
[53:24] your feet shod with the preparation of
[53:27] the gospel of peace verse 16 above all
[53:30] taking the helmet of faith wherewith ye
[53:34] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[53:36] darts of the wicked so
[53:38] peter is showing you that faith is in
[53:40] the foundation of your experience and
[53:43] paul is saying now take that faith and
[53:45] let it be your crowning helmet
[53:47] amen so that you're the complete man the
[53:50] whole man you're ready to face the enemy
[53:53] and it doesn't matter what he comes at
[53:55] you with you're ready to face him and
[53:57] take on any and every challenge
[54:01] do you see the simplicity of the word
[54:03] do you see the disciples knowing the
[54:05] evil day that would come the holy spirit
[54:08] was mindful so that we could come in
[54:10] here today and read these principles and
[54:11] say wow so this is how i have victory at
[54:14] the end time
[54:16] verse 17 take the helmet of salvation
[54:18] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[54:19] word of god praying always
[54:22] not two times a week
[54:26] not in a midweek and a sunday service
[54:28] praying always
[54:30] with all prayer and supplication in the
[54:33] spirit
[54:34] see
[54:36] watching there unto with all
[54:38] perseverance and supplication for all
[54:41] the saints all right now i want to give
[54:43] you peter's uh teaching that we read for
[54:46] our text in my powerpoint if you go
[54:48] ahead and switch me out there brother
[54:50] matt to my powerpoint we're going to
[54:51] take 2 peter 1 8 to 12. this first
[54:54] version is going to be from the
[54:57] amplified amen
[54:59] amen we'll have it here in a second
[55:04] all right i'm gonna start reading and
[55:06] you guys get it uh just as soon as you
[55:07] can and just uh scroll it with me so
[55:10] listen carefully this is what peter said
[55:12] from the amplified version
[55:14] all right
[55:15] let me okay so here's faith versus fear
[55:17] and perfect faith in a time of perfect
[55:20] fear all right
[55:21] for as these qualities
[55:24] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[55:26] meekness amen amen for as these
[55:28] qualities are yours
[55:30] and increasingly abound in you they will
[55:34] keep you from being idle or unfruitful
[55:37] unto the full personal knowledge of our
[55:40] lord jesus christ now don't read yet if
[55:43] does that make sense to you because
[55:45] remember that paul
[55:46] speaking to i believe the i believe it
[55:49] was the galatian church
[55:50] he says i would that you come into all
[55:53] the knowledge of the glory of god and
[55:54] they were they had been believers for 30
[55:56] years
[55:57] they've been believers for decades and
[55:59] paul is saying i want you to come to all
[56:01] the fullness he uses that word the
[56:03] fullness of the knowledge see so so it's
[56:06] not as you've heard me say
[56:09] god meeting you at an altar and say all
[56:11] right you're saved see you in the
[56:13] millennium come on see yes as i've said
[56:16] yes we are going home on the old ship of
[56:18] zion but he didn't save you to go down
[56:20] to the docks and sit on your luggage
[56:23] amen
[56:24] so
[56:25] so from being idle or unfruitful unto
[56:28] the full personal knowledge of our lord
[56:30] jesus christ young people you want to
[56:32] know how you can be victorious in school
[56:35] you want to know how you can keep your
[56:36] testimony brothers sisters you want to
[56:39] know how you can keep your testimony on
[56:40] the on the on the job or in the markets
[56:42] right here here's how you can be strong
[56:45] here's how you can overcome the wows of
[56:46] the devil see
[56:48] it'll bring you to a full personal
[56:50] knowledge of our lord jesus christ the
[56:52] messiah the anointed one for whoever
[56:55] believers god's family who have a gene
[56:58] of god that's who he's talking to
[57:01] listen if you doubt that go back and
[57:03] read the beginning of that chapter
[57:05] peter is clearly talking to those who've
[57:08] had the same new birth experience as him
[57:11] that's evident when you read it who he's
[57:13] talking to
[57:14] so these are born again children of god
[57:16] with the gene of god or well it's why
[57:18] you couldn't become redeemed like that
[57:20] so for whoever lacks these qualities in
[57:24] other words if they're not strong in you
[57:26] you get blind
[57:27] spiritually short-sighted this is
[57:30] extremely critical for fathers who
[57:33] oversee households because if you've got
[57:36] short-sightedness the devil can slip
[57:38] things into your home and the next thing
[57:40] you know it's a seat of discrepancy you
[57:42] didn't catch it and the next thing you
[57:44] know it's infected your wife your
[57:45] children your activities and you say man
[57:48] where did all this carnality where's all
[57:50] this rebellion where's all this anger
[57:51] where's all this resentment where's all
[57:53] this conflict coming from you were
[57:54] short-sighted
[57:56] and you let the devil come knocking at
[57:58] your door and you thought he was a ups
[58:00] man but he was actually in disguise
[58:03] see and he actually gave you a package
[58:05] you should have sent back
[58:07] all right watch
[58:09] this is the the disadvantage when you
[58:11] don't when you don't take peter's advice
[58:13] when you don't take paul's advice this
[58:14] is what is what happens
[58:16] you're spiritually short-sighted seeing
[58:19] only what is near to him and has become
[58:21] oblivious
[58:22] to the fact that he
[58:25] uh
[58:26] somehow missing part of 9 i think
[58:29] because of this brethren
[58:31] uh let me read it for you the last part
[58:34] of verse 9 i don't know why that got cut
[58:36] off you have become oblivious to the
[58:38] fact that he was cleansed from his old
[58:40] sins
[58:41] because of this brethren be all the more
[58:45] solicitous
[58:47] uh that and eager to make sure
[58:51] to ratify to strengthen to make
[58:54] steadfast that's what it means it's this
[58:57] practical teaching
[59:00] that's how you make your calling and
[59:02] election sure
[59:05] you make it vibrant you make it strong
[59:07] you make it healthy it has nothing to do
[59:10] with the fact that you're born again or
[59:11] you're not this is a born-again person
[59:14] who god is saying now be strong in the
[59:16] faith see
[59:18] all right
[59:19] see so
[59:21] you're calling an election for if you do
[59:23] this you will never stumble or fall lord
[59:26] let me live there
[59:29] thus there will be richly and abundantly
[59:32] provided for you entry into the eternal
[59:34] kingdom of the lord and savior jesus
[59:36] christ so i intend always to remind you
[59:39] about these things now we come to the to
[59:42] the holman version for if these
[59:44] qualities are yours and are increasing
[59:48] they will keep you from being useless or
[59:52] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[59:54] jesus christ there's few things more sad
[59:58] than an unusable christian
[1:00:02] don't read ahead of me they'll say it
[1:00:03] again there's few things more
[1:00:06] uh sad i mean in a home as you've heard
[1:00:10] me say before a home only has two kinds
[1:00:12] of peoples two kinds of people that live
[1:00:14] in every home consumers and contributors
[1:00:18] now when you got a little bitty baby of
[1:00:21] course it's just a consumer it's gonna
[1:00:23] consume food and your time and and the
[1:00:26] family's attention it's going to consume
[1:00:29] everything you're going to have to
[1:00:30] change it bathe it feed it care for it
[1:00:32] swaddle it hold it comfort it you have
[1:00:35] to get up all hours of the night and
[1:00:38] amen amen where's brother john amen
[1:00:39] brother john
[1:00:40] amen so
[1:00:42] uh
[1:00:43] it was so funny that brother louie he's
[1:00:45] always got this sense of humor and any
[1:00:47] time a sister has a baby and goes all
[1:00:49] that labor hey brother louis would have
[1:00:51] stood up here and said it all came out
[1:00:53] good brother john is home resting amen
[1:00:58] so so he says
[1:01:00] so the person who lacks these things is
[1:01:03] blind short-sighted is forgotten
[1:01:06] he's forgotten the cleansing of his past
[1:01:08] sins now i know what i was saying that
[1:01:10] that that finally that baby grows into
[1:01:13] some age and now it's time to start
[1:01:16] blending in uh not that he's not just
[1:01:18] our she's not just a consumer but a
[1:01:21] contributor
[1:01:22] and the older they get the more that
[1:01:24] balance should go like that until by the
[1:01:26] time they're teenagers they should be
[1:01:28] completely contributing and that and
[1:01:31] i've i've
[1:01:32] the worst situations i've ever seen in
[1:01:34] counseling homes that were in chaos was
[1:01:37] i went in and the first thing i could
[1:01:38] see was that the kids were all just
[1:01:40] consumers
[1:01:42] and the mom was basically a slave
[1:01:45] that's not scriptural
[1:01:47] that's not pleasing to the lord be up
[1:01:49] and at it
[1:01:50] amen amen you got you got a home you're
[1:01:52] raised in in the truth be grateful show
[1:01:55] your appreciation see
[1:01:58] amen don't know why i'm on that
[1:02:00] but but but anyway the the principle is
[1:02:02] now just extrapolate that to god's
[1:02:04] kingdom how useless are you
[1:02:06] to god if you're just always a consumer
[1:02:09] and all you do is treat him like santa
[1:02:11] claus
[1:02:13] see you're never willing to give never
[1:02:16] willing to stretch out never willing to
[1:02:18] take up your duty see stand shoulder to
[1:02:21] shoulder with the rest of the saints
[1:02:23] bear the burdens of christ see that's
[1:02:24] what paul said that i may know him in
[1:02:26] the power of his resurrection and being
[1:02:28] made conformable even unto his death i
[1:02:30] want to know him in the fellowship of
[1:02:31] his sufferings even so therefore
[1:02:34] brothers make every effort to confirm
[1:02:37] you're calling an election because if
[1:02:39] you do these things you will never
[1:02:40] stumble for in this way entry into the
[1:02:43] eternal kingdom
[1:02:44] entry into the eternal kingdom and it's
[1:02:47] cut off on me again
[1:02:49] of our lord and savior jesus christ will
[1:02:52] be richly supplied to you
[1:02:56] all right you can you can take that down
[1:02:59] so now
[1:03:01] so i i'm already well into teaching and
[1:03:03] i've got to really hurry i want to try
[1:03:05] to finish in the next 10 to 12 minutes
[1:03:07] so
[1:03:08] i want to say this today that we are in
[1:03:11] an age
[1:03:12] in in that is that is in such contrast
[1:03:16] i would say that it's actually in
[1:03:18] perfect contradistinction one to the
[1:03:20] other
[1:03:21] faith is now perfect and fear is now
[1:03:24] perfect
[1:03:26] because and what has brought that about
[1:03:29] is that what brought us perfect faith
[1:03:31] god unsealed a book
[1:03:34] thank god
[1:03:36] and now you you're eating the body word
[1:03:38] of the son of man
[1:03:39] and it's you're becoming what you eat
[1:03:41] you're being transformed into what you
[1:03:43] gaze at
[1:03:45] but also this is satan's eden and the
[1:03:47] lid has been torn off of hell and now he
[1:03:49] has perfected fear
[1:03:52] in the world
[1:03:53] and this is the titanic battle this is
[1:03:56] the great epic that's going on right now
[1:03:58] god's family a little persecuted
[1:04:00] minority in the world who's saying i
[1:04:02] believe god i believe every word of god
[1:04:06] and i will not acquiesce to the devil's
[1:04:09] intimidation
[1:04:10] [Applause]
[1:04:12] that's the
[1:04:14] and that's why the devil hates you
[1:04:16] because you already got the whole world
[1:04:18] he can't but he can't stand it that he
[1:04:19] don't have you
[1:04:24] so fear
[1:04:26] i want to say this friends make some
[1:04:28] statements today before i pause and
[1:04:30] we'll pick it up on tuesday
[1:04:33] so fear
[1:04:35] to the level of unbelief
[1:04:37] and perfect faith are perfectly at odds
[1:04:41] one with another they are polar
[1:04:43] opposites now i get it i get paul spoke
[1:04:45] of in second corinthians 7 how that you
[1:04:48] know when he was there in macedonia and
[1:04:50] all the trials and the things that he
[1:04:52] went on there and paul talks about
[1:04:54] fightings without and within or fears
[1:04:56] i get that
[1:04:57] life is real
[1:04:59] i do get that we are human beings i do
[1:05:01] get that we come up on terrible
[1:05:03] situations and we are sometimes
[1:05:05] alarmed even even though jesus said be
[1:05:08] anxious for nothing we are humans
[1:05:11] so i'm not talking about you know just
[1:05:13] your your mortality and and this body of
[1:05:16] death that paul
[1:05:18] talked about we're always going to be
[1:05:19] battling this guy
[1:05:21] but i'm talking about that fear to the
[1:05:24] level of unbelief when you are failing
[1:05:27] to take god at his word
[1:05:29] that is the original sin was unbelief in
[1:05:32] god's word that's the original sin
[1:05:34] the act that took place was only a
[1:05:36] result of that
[1:05:38] you understand so so what was the lie
[1:05:41] that the world is to believe at the end
[1:05:42] time because it's not just eli
[1:05:45] where the king james word said that they
[1:05:47] should believe a lie and be damned by it
[1:05:48] brother branham said no that's actually
[1:05:50] the original lie
[1:05:52] and the lie was that you could reason
[1:05:54] away god's word and be okay well that's
[1:05:57] not true you can't do that
[1:05:59] if you reason away god's word you die
[1:06:02] period soul so so fear
[1:06:07] to the level of unbelief
[1:06:09] and perfect faith are at perfect odds
[1:06:12] one with another
[1:06:14] and so you know this
[1:06:16] this human fear notwithstanding i get
[1:06:18] you know what's in our flesh and we're
[1:06:20] mortal beings
[1:06:21] but but i'm talking about fear to where
[1:06:24] you're afraid to act upon god's word and
[1:06:27] i want to make this statement that that
[1:06:29] fear
[1:06:31] to the level of unbelief perfect let me
[1:06:33] just say this way perfect fear
[1:06:35] or perfect faith
[1:06:37] those are
[1:06:39] mutually exclusive terms
[1:06:41] they can't both be true in a person
[1:06:46] you understand they're mutually
[1:06:47] exclusive brother branham taught us that
[1:06:49] that he said now you've got all kinds of
[1:06:51] senses you've got five in your flesh
[1:06:53] five in your spirit but he says down in
[1:06:55] the soul that only has one sense faith
[1:06:57] or doubt
[1:06:58] it's either born again or it's not
[1:07:00] there's no half christian you're either
[1:07:01] all born again or you're not born again
[1:07:04] and so therefore that that perfect faith
[1:07:08] which is a revelation sovereignly given
[1:07:10] to you by god and and and fear that
[1:07:14] dominates the age or unbelief in god's
[1:07:16] word they're mutually exclusive you
[1:07:18] can't they can't both be true in you
[1:07:21] amen so so we find then that
[1:07:25] when we think about what should
[1:07:27] encourage our faith well to me
[1:07:32] one of the things that i think all by
[1:07:34] itself
[1:07:35] that should encourage our perfect faith
[1:07:38] is that
[1:07:40] is that i am serving
[1:07:42] a being
[1:07:44] i want you to think about this with me
[1:07:46] a being who
[1:07:48] with just his word
[1:07:50] created everything
[1:07:53] the entire universe and all of its
[1:07:56] innumerable galaxies
[1:07:58] and the galaxies have a nearly
[1:08:00] innumerable stars
[1:08:02] and there's more galaxies than there are
[1:08:04] grains of sand on all the beaches in the
[1:08:08] earth that's a scientific fact
[1:08:12] and there's a god that did all of that
[1:08:14] and it all works synchronously and
[1:08:16] harmoniously and he did it all with
[1:08:18] nobody to help him
[1:08:20] he didn't need anybody's help he just
[1:08:22] spoke it and it became
[1:08:25] that's the kind of god whose child i am
[1:08:29] that's the being that i came from and if
[1:08:32] that's how he operated why would i think
[1:08:34] to not operate that way
[1:08:37] brother branham said he spoke and then
[1:08:39] god had to turn around and believe his
[1:08:40] own word
[1:08:42] oh hallelujah then let us speak the word
[1:08:44] of god let us put it on our lips and let
[1:08:46] us believe it today
[1:08:49] it can surmount any obstacle it can
[1:08:51] defeat any devil any time any place
[1:08:54] under any circumstance
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:09:00] see now
[1:09:02] i'm talking something deeper than just
[1:09:05] i get there's human
[1:09:07] spiritual gymnastics that we're given
[1:09:09] for instance the right mental attitude
[1:09:12] toward every promise of god will bring
[1:09:14] it to pass well that's true on sinner or
[1:09:16] saint
[1:09:19] the right mental attitude brother
[1:09:20] branham would see
[1:09:22] ill-famed women come through the line
[1:09:23] and get their healing
[1:09:25] because the right mental attitude toward
[1:09:26] any promise of god will bring it to pass
[1:09:28] in anybody
[1:09:29] amen you believe that
[1:09:32] and and that's why there are certain
[1:09:34] laws of nature you know giving if you
[1:09:37] give the bible says if you give god will
[1:09:40] cause men to give under your bosom
[1:09:43] it's a law of reaping and sowing
[1:09:45] ties and offerings we we took up our
[1:09:47] ties and offerings here as we normally
[1:09:49] do that's a promise of god that works in
[1:09:52] nature that could no more fail than the
[1:09:53] sun could refuse to come up tomorrow
[1:09:56] just as sure as the sun comes up if you
[1:09:58] faithfully bring the lord back his
[1:10:00] portion over everything you have
[1:10:02] because he gives you everything you have
[1:10:04] then then it's impossible for the enemy
[1:10:06] to keep the blessing from you and if he
[1:10:08] tries god will rebuke him
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:11] in contradistinction fail to give god be
[1:10:14] a thief keep god's portion for yourself
[1:10:18] then there's no way to keep the cursing
[1:10:20] coming from coming upon you and praying
[1:10:22] to god to take it off won't do you any
[1:10:24] good
[1:10:25] i'm not preaching on that today
[1:10:27] preaching on faith but i'm just trying
[1:10:29] to show you by examples in the word of
[1:10:31] god and so the same being that created
[1:10:34] the universe
[1:10:35] the whole heavens and the earth and all
[1:10:37] life on it by his word alone who needed
[1:10:40] no help from anybody that's the same one
[1:10:44] that calls you by the message
[1:10:47] and purifies your life
[1:10:50] i don't just want forgiveness for my sin
[1:10:54] i want sanctification
[1:10:57] i want to be purified i don't just want
[1:11:00] to be forgiven i want to be cleaned
[1:11:02] i want to be empowered i want to be
[1:11:04] strengthened i want to have faith
[1:11:09] see
[1:11:10] amen so how then would we not want to
[1:11:13] lay aside this is a fair question i
[1:11:15] think
[1:11:16] how would we not want to lay aside every
[1:11:18] weight that hinders us
[1:11:20] from this access
[1:11:22] and this result
[1:11:25] how would we not
[1:11:27] give all of our
[1:11:28] life to that now that we see it taught
[1:11:31] so clearly in the word of god
[1:11:35] you see to me
[1:11:37] and this is just brother jason this is
[1:11:39] just the angle and maybe i'm weird but
[1:11:41] to me
[1:11:42] this is why i connect
[1:11:44] second peter
[1:11:46] to
[1:11:46] when
[1:11:48] in our text when we read from second
[1:11:49] peter in ephesians six and we read from
[1:11:52] romans eight to me they all go together
[1:11:55] you're not given the spirit of fear
[1:11:57] you're giving the a sound mind
[1:12:00] you're given the spirit of adoption
[1:12:03] we're we're adding to our faith
[1:12:05] knowledge and adding adding to virtue
[1:12:07] and adding to virtual knowledge and
[1:12:08] we're we're putting on the whole armor
[1:12:10] of god we're sho our feet are being shot
[1:12:13] our helmet is being put on our
[1:12:14] breastplate is being readied because we
[1:12:16] want to have that same god that created
[1:12:20] the whole world with just his word
[1:12:22] operating in me
[1:12:24] see by his word
[1:12:26] and and then here's a here's a fourth
[1:12:28] connection i make to me i could have
[1:12:30] read the text and i'm going to close
[1:12:32] with this
[1:12:33] this is what i see
[1:12:35] as the most valuable aspect of the
[1:12:37] command to redeem the time
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:41] to me what we're talking about that is
[1:12:42] redeeming the time
[1:12:44] and and and i i heard a wonderful
[1:12:46] recording and i shared it with my whole
[1:12:49] family in fact
[1:12:50] and it was on this particular scripture
[1:12:52] redeeming the time did you know that
[1:12:54] that time is the most valuable thing
[1:12:57] redeem the time time is the most
[1:12:59] valuable thing you have
[1:13:01] time is more valuable than money
[1:13:05] you can make more money but you can
[1:13:07] never make more time
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:12] and i mean if somebody said to you today
[1:13:15] i'm gonna i'm gonna deposit 86
[1:13:18] 400 into your bank account every day
[1:13:22] every one of us would be jumping up and
[1:13:23] down
[1:13:24] we wouldn't even need the spirit to hit
[1:13:26] us
[1:13:27] we'd be running the aisles whether
[1:13:29] brother anthony was singing or not
[1:13:34] what's the catch there's no there's no
[1:13:36] catch it's free it's yours and i'll do
[1:13:39] it every day the only rub the only
[1:13:41] caveat is
[1:13:43] that at the end of each day
[1:13:45] every bit of that money you haven't
[1:13:46] spent i take it back
[1:13:49] you don't get to carry it over and
[1:13:50] double up the next day now don't worry
[1:13:53] the next day i'll give you another 86.4
[1:13:56] but the 86 400 that i put in your
[1:13:58] account today if you don't spend it all
[1:14:00] i'm reclaiming it and it's not going to
[1:14:02] carry over we love carryover plans we
[1:14:04] love for verizon to give us carryover
[1:14:06] plans there's no carryover plan buddy if
[1:14:09] somebody told you that
[1:14:11] you you talking about going on a
[1:14:13] spending spree you wouldn't let one cent
[1:14:16] of that go to waste you would you'd
[1:14:18] spend your whole eight or ten or twelve
[1:14:20] a week waking hours making sure every
[1:14:23] day you spent eighty six thousand four
[1:14:25] hundred dollars
[1:14:27] well you see
[1:14:28] you're actually given in every 24 hours
[1:14:32] 86
[1:14:33] 400 seconds of time
[1:14:37] and god deposits in your life every day
[1:14:41] six thousand four hundred seconds
[1:14:43] the only caveat is you don't get to
[1:14:46] carry it over into the next day he'll
[1:14:47] give you another eighty six four but
[1:14:50] what are you doing with the 86 four he
[1:14:53] gave you today
[1:14:55] to me
[1:14:56] this is redeeming the time
[1:15:00] to me i mean
[1:15:01] to me you know i mean what what real let
[1:15:04] me ask you this question
[1:15:06] what reel

[1:15:18] gonna do it by yourself
[1:15:20] okay all right
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:26] i want to ask you this question
[1:15:32] redeeming the time
[1:15:35] it's not just about i want to say this
[1:15:37] real clear
[1:15:38] it's not just about
[1:15:42] making my time more valuable or
[1:15:46] taking some classes on prioritizing and
[1:15:49] maximizing efficiency it's not that's
[1:15:51] not the bible redemption of time
[1:15:55] because
[1:15:56] i want you to think about this what real
[1:15:59] and eternal good
[1:16:02] would it do you to redeem
[1:16:04] your fixed time
[1:16:06] that you have in the earth
[1:16:08] to redeeming to to to redeem
[1:16:12] your fixed time that would not
[1:16:15] maximize
[1:16:17] the opportunity to put on the whole
[1:16:20] armor of god what real good would that
[1:16:23] do you
[1:16:24] if you tried to redeem your cronus time
[1:16:29] and you never
[1:16:31] took it and part of that redemption was
[1:16:33] not
[1:16:34] putting on the whole armor so that you
[1:16:36] could defeat the enemy
[1:16:38] your redeeming of your time had nothing
[1:16:40] to do with adding to your faith virgin
[1:16:42] virgin knowledge and knowledge
[1:16:43] temperance
[1:16:44] you just decided yeah that's a good
[1:16:46] point i heard the preacher say today i
[1:16:48] get 86 400 seconds i'm going to i'm
[1:16:50] going to be more i'm going to go take a
[1:16:51] college class on maximizing efficiency
[1:16:56] oh you say wouldn't that be a benefit
[1:16:58] sure to your fixed time but why do i
[1:16:59] care so much about my fixed time
[1:17:01] i'm looking for my eternal time
[1:17:04] i want to have something in the on this
[1:17:06] side of eternity that counts on the
[1:17:08] other side
[1:17:10] i want to live for the purpose that god
[1:17:12] has put me here that's how i'm going to
[1:17:15] redeem my time
[1:17:17] so i'm so i'm going to stop giving so
[1:17:20] much of my fixed time to the nonsense of
[1:17:23] laodicea and i'm going to go back to
[1:17:25] god's word remember remember the thing
[1:17:27] that created everything remember the
[1:17:29] thing that created all the universe and
[1:17:30] all those galaxies
[1:17:32] and and put vegetation on the earth and
[1:17:34] gave you life i'm gonna give my i'm
[1:17:36] gonna redeem time with him
[1:17:39] i'm gonna redeem time
[1:17:41] i'm gonna spend more time with him
[1:17:45] i'm going to redeem
[1:17:47] my valuable
[1:17:48] time
[1:17:51] god bless you let's stand to our feet
[1:17:53] and give you a change of position
[1:17:57] let's pray
[1:18:00] father we thank you
[1:18:03] for your wonderful word today
[1:18:05] and i i know lord that in an audience
[1:18:09] father of this size and no doubt across
[1:18:11] the airwaves
[1:18:12] many lord of your children i would say
[1:18:15] all of your children are
[1:18:16] are always
[1:18:18] greatly affected
[1:18:20] by the ministry of the word
[1:18:22] lord we preached it as
[1:18:25] passionately as i felt it i preached it
[1:18:27] with the same faith that i believe it i
[1:18:29] i i was serious lord i'm i'm in this
[1:18:32] pulpit today and everything that i
[1:18:34] preached i stand by it and i say lord
[1:18:37] grant it to me
[1:18:38] grant that the power of god could be
[1:18:40] more alive in my life grant my
[1:18:42] determination that i redeem my time more
[1:18:45] and spend more time with the one who all
[1:18:47] by himself with no other help just his
[1:18:50] word created everything
[1:18:53] how would i neglect spending time with
[1:18:56] that being
[1:18:58] who in the right mind would do that
[1:19:02] it goes to show lord because the reality
[1:19:04] of the work
[1:19:06] of the world is that the overwhelming
[1:19:09] majority so much so that those who who
[1:19:12] redeem their time are almost an
[1:19:14] imperceptible
[1:19:15] number on a graph
[1:19:17] so it seems so upside down it proves
[1:19:21] definitively
[1:19:22] that the world has gone insane
[1:19:26] that there is no concern about these
[1:19:28] kinds of things
[1:19:30] people look upon the promises of god's
[1:19:33] word cursorily just conveniently i'll
[1:19:36] try to fit it in i got a pretty busy
[1:19:38] life don't let that be true lord
[1:19:41] help us one and all help these fathers
[1:19:43] and mothers help these teenagers lord
[1:19:45] we're coming up on a camp i want to see
[1:19:47] them go into the camp with faith i want
[1:19:49] to see them
[1:19:50] go into the camp with the determination
[1:19:52] to redeem the time and put on the whole
[1:19:54] armor of god and add to their faith
[1:19:56] virtue
[1:19:57] and build up all of these things so that
[1:19:59] they can take that foundation of faith
[1:20:01] and set it on their head as a helmet
[1:20:04] oh god granite today we love you i thank
[1:20:07] you for your word
[1:20:08] lord if there be any here today
[1:20:11] who know father with all heads bowed and
[1:20:14] even out across the the airwaves please
[1:20:16] bow your head don't even be looking at
[1:20:18] your screen right yet

[1:20:26] to raise up both of mine lord i want to
[1:20:28] pay more attention to these things i
[1:20:31] want to be able to operate perfect faith

[1:22:36] heavenly father lord jesus i'm nothing
[1:22:38] god
[1:22:40] you're everything to me lord you mean oh
[1:22:42] and all to me lord i'm forsaken
[1:22:44] everything for you lord
[1:22:46] me and sister kathy we burn all our
[1:22:48] bridges lord and i am going on with you
[1:22:51] lord i'm going upward lord
[1:22:54] next time my family sees me lord they'll
[1:22:56] see me standing there with you and the
[1:22:58] prophet and all of them standing there
[1:22:59] together lord they'll see that i told
[1:23:01] them the truth then lord
[1:23:03] god bless your word lord may go forth
[1:23:05] lord in jesus christ's name amen
[1:23:08] anyway he woke me up at
[1:23:10] two o'clock and i sat there and talked
[1:23:12] to him and cried because i'll tell you
[1:23:13] about i thought it was about to lose the
[1:23:15] precious precious thing to me besides
[1:23:17] him he's the most precious of my life
[1:23:20] and that she's next
[1:23:21] and i tell you what i wasn't going to
[1:23:22] give her up by reminding god what me and
[1:23:24] sister kathy had done for him we forsook
[1:23:26] just about everything for him
[1:23:28] hauled the tv away 35 years ago and you
[1:23:31] couldn't give me a million 10 million
[1:23:32] dollars to put that thing back in my
[1:23:34] house
[1:23:35] and i'll tell you i didn't know this
[1:23:36] until i went back and played the prophet
[1:23:38] about the token he said you even got to
[1:23:40] give up in nasty newspapers and i've
[1:23:42] done that six years ago and i don't care
[1:23:43] i'm gonna be enough for jesus christ
[1:23:45] because i'm going upward this is one nut
[1:23:47] just threaded to jesus christ i don't
[1:23:49] care what anybody else does i'm going up
[1:23:53] now we're going to play the prophet let
[1:23:54] y'all hear what god showed me
[1:23:58] now along this journey he's promised to
[1:24:01] supply everything that we have need of
[1:24:03] whatsoever you will ask the father in my
[1:24:05] name that will i do
[1:24:08] whatsoever things mark 11 24 whatsoever
[1:24:11] things you desire when you pray believe
[1:24:13] you receive it you shall have it now he
[1:24:15] gave us the strongest weapon that there
[1:24:18] is in all the world
[1:24:20] and that's prayer
[1:24:22] prayer is what changes things
[1:24:25] the christian doesn't realize what a
[1:24:27] force he has when he kneels on his knees
[1:24:30] before
[1:24:31] almighty god in the name of jesus christ
[1:24:34] he doesn't realize what what power that
[1:24:36] is
[1:24:38] if the people can only
[1:24:40] realize that the that what is given
[1:24:43] right unto them
[1:24:45] anything that you ask for will be given
[1:24:47] if you can appropriate the faith to
[1:24:48] believe it
[1:24:50] for god's word is true
[1:24:52] and our god's word will defeat satan
[1:24:54] anywhere any place any
[1:24:57] amen it will that will give you all
[1:25:00] testimony i don't told everybody about
[1:25:01] the milkman but if i can run into the
[1:25:03] milkman he's going to hear it too i got
[1:25:05] it memorized
[1:25:06] but anyway tuesday kathy got to her
[1:25:08] lowest i mean and i said babe i got to
[1:25:10] take you to the merch room you don't
[1:25:11] want to go but i've got to take you i've
[1:25:13] done all i can do
[1:25:15] and she don't even remember me taking it
[1:25:16] but i placed her in the hands of jesus
[1:25:18] christ the best hands i could place her
[1:25:20] in and i left her there and i didn't
[1:25:21] take her back out of his hands you hear
[1:25:22] me
[1:25:23] and uh so i took her there twos and i
[1:25:25] run back to work and went to work about
[1:25:28] an hour away and then i come back home
[1:25:29] that evening i was gonna go in my kayak
[1:25:31] and just praise the lord and talk to him
[1:25:33] a little bit
[1:25:34] and the hospital they said they're
[1:25:35] trying to call me 10 or 12 times they
[1:25:37] couldn't get me i believe god blocked
[1:25:39] all them calls but anyway that evening i
[1:25:42] went and i called about five o'clock the
[1:25:44] hospital i said
[1:25:46] i just want to see how my wife's doing
[1:25:47] and they said well we tried to call you
[1:25:49] 10 or 12 times we put her on a
[1:25:51] helicopter 70 dollar ride for 45 minutes
[1:25:55] she had an aneurysm in the back of her
[1:25:57] neck that was about to bust they said it
[1:25:59] was just like a water hose we talked to
[1:26:00] him kathy talked to him so it was just
[1:26:02] like a water hose swelled up real big it
[1:26:04] was about the bus
[1:26:05] and about seven months ago she
[1:26:07] complained about her neck hurt and i
[1:26:08] prayed for one two three times i said i
[1:26:10] don't like to keep praying i believe god
[1:26:12] to take this thing away
[1:26:14] and she reminded me what brother brandon
[1:26:15] when he prayed for sister immediate
[1:26:16] about that tumor he kept they kept
[1:26:18] praying and believing god and i said
[1:26:20] that's fine babe and then that the pain
[1:26:22] just left her never to bother no more
[1:26:25] but then they flew her to gainesville
[1:26:27] florida
[1:26:28] and then uh
[1:26:30] their doctor was examined that evening
[1:26:32] tuesday evening before i called her
[1:26:35] and said yeah you got an aneurysm about

[1:37:14] we went through a really low period
[1:37:15] there but uh
[1:37:17] god is good he brought us through it and
[1:37:18] i just want to tell you what happened in
[1:37:20] the way god miraculously moved for us
[1:37:24] so every every year about this time we
[1:37:26] uh go on vacation up into pigeon forge
[1:37:29] gatlinburg area and we're kind of we get
[1:37:31] in a rut we we're happy with it you know
[1:37:34] being from up north
[1:37:38] being from up north one thing we miss is
[1:37:40] the leaves and the fall and the colors
[1:37:42] and all so we go up there every year and
[1:37:44] uh
[1:37:46] we enjoy there's a lot to do if you've
[1:37:47] ever been up there it's a beautiful area
[1:37:48] and um so that we were going again this
[1:37:50] year we've been the last four years we
[1:37:52] missed last year because of the pandemic
[1:37:54] but uh
[1:37:55] i fully intended to go again this year
[1:37:57] and i was online you know
[1:37:58] booking an airbnb hotel researching what
[1:38:01] what was the best option for us
[1:38:04] and i hadn't have thoughts of going
[1:38:05] anywhere else i had no idea but uh
[1:38:08] just out of the blue a memory came to me
[1:38:11] when i was 12 years old back in 1982 my
[1:38:14] parents took us to colonial williamsburg
[1:38:17] uh busch gardens
[1:38:19] and uh i just got to thinking i said i
[1:38:21] would be nice to go there that's a
[1:38:22] really pretty area so i went to the
[1:38:24] family and asked them and they were yeah
[1:38:26] we're fine with that so go ahead
[1:38:28] so i went ahead went online booked it
[1:38:30] bought the tickets and um
[1:38:32] we started planning the trip well the
[1:38:34] day we were going to leave
[1:38:36] i started feeling really really bad i
[1:38:38] mean worse as bad as i've ever felt in
[1:38:41] my life
[1:38:42] but
[1:38:43] i didn't want to ruin the vacation so
[1:38:45] i'll just power through it'll get better
[1:38:47] and um
[1:38:48] we'll go ahead and make the trip so
[1:38:50] i um i did and all the way there i was
[1:38:52] feeling really bad that night we checked
[1:38:54] into the hotel and it was probably one
[1:38:56] of the worst nights of my life i felt
[1:38:58] horrible it's hard to describe how bad
[1:39:00] it felt so um
[1:39:02] got up the next morning still feeling
[1:39:04] bad but
[1:39:05] we went ahead and went to the park
[1:39:08] took a trolley ride to the entrance and
[1:39:11] we made it in the park and we probably
[1:39:13] were in there probably
[1:39:14] 150 200 feet
[1:39:17] and we came to the first ride and it was
[1:39:19] a really big roller coaster and sarah
[1:39:21] wanted to ride it she loves those the
[1:39:23] rest of us
[1:39:24] not so much but sarah loves them so
[1:39:28] there was a wood pavilion down there
[1:39:29] with some picnic tables and i told sarah
[1:39:31] you go ahead and ride it and we'll wait
[1:39:32] here for you
[1:39:33] and uh so the ride took it was a long
[1:39:36] long line it took about 45 minutes
[1:39:38] and um so we were sitting there and i
[1:39:41] just kept feeling worse and worse
[1:39:43] and by the time sarah came down i told
[1:39:45] him i said look y'all i don't want to
[1:39:46] ruin the day
[1:39:48] um you all go ahead and have a good time
[1:39:49] i'm gonna go back out to the car and
[1:39:51] just uh
[1:39:52] lay down for a while and hope i'll feel
[1:39:53] better
[1:39:55] and it's a good thing i didn't
[1:39:57] as soon as i said that
[1:39:59] i had a heart attack it was bad
[1:40:01] everything they say is that's exactly
[1:40:03] how it is
[1:40:04] i fell back on the bench where i was
[1:40:06] laying and it literally felt like a
[1:40:09] grown man was standing on my chest on
[1:40:11] one foot and the pain in my arm all the
[1:40:14] way up into my
[1:40:15] jaw
[1:40:16] and i was just drenched from head to
[1:40:19] foot in sweat
[1:40:21] and uh i told tammy call 9-1-1 i'm
[1:40:23] having a heart attack
[1:40:25] and
[1:40:26] thankfully she didn't
[1:40:27] she jumped up and ran to an information
[1:40:30] booth about
[1:40:31] 30 feet away
[1:40:32] and told the lady there i need an
[1:40:34] ambulance my husband's having a heart
[1:40:36] attack
[1:40:37] well by the grace of god
[1:40:39] there was a fully equipped paramedic
[1:40:40] team standing 30 feet away
[1:40:43] right there within two minutes maybe
[1:40:46] three
[1:40:47] of me having a heart attack they were
[1:40:49] there had ekgs on me the paddles
[1:40:53] and they said yep you're having a heart
[1:40:54] attack try to relax
[1:40:56] they started putting nitroglycerin in my
[1:40:58] mouth the aspirin and it helped
[1:41:00] immediately i started you know just it
[1:41:02] relieves something
[1:41:04] and
[1:41:07] i was laying there looking at my
[1:41:08] daughters and
[1:41:11] you know they were crying
[1:41:12] but
[1:41:14] they were praying
[1:41:16] and
[1:41:17] i was thinking to myself
[1:41:18] if they had any natural abilities what
[1:41:21] more could they do than what the
[1:41:22] paramedics are doing
[1:41:24] but they had
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:30] they had a connection to almighty god
[1:41:33] and tabitha
[1:41:36] my rock
[1:41:39] being the trooper she was she was right
[1:41:41] in there with the paramedics she got a
[1:41:42] towel she was in her wife in my head
[1:41:44] wiping my face telling me it was going
[1:41:46] to be okay
[1:41:48] so after about 15 minutes i guess a crew
[1:41:51] showed up from the hospital in an
[1:41:53] ambulance another another paramedic crew
[1:41:56] and they quickly switched over took over
[1:41:58] from that team loaded me on a stretcher
[1:42:00] and they were able to bring the
[1:42:01] ambulance right into the park almost to
[1:42:03] where i was
[1:42:04] so they loaded me up and um
[1:42:07] they said real quick we're going to
[1:42:08] transmit an ekg and then we're going to
[1:42:10] get going to the hospital
[1:42:11] which they did and they were very
[1:42:12] proficient they were very professional
[1:42:14] calm
[1:42:15] and um
[1:42:17] so we started from the hospital
[1:42:19] and i don't know if anybody's ever
[1:42:21] fainted or
[1:42:22] has something like that happen there's
[1:42:24] always a moment of where you're fading
[1:42:26] out and you're fading back in
[1:42:29] when your heart stops that doesn't
[1:42:30] happen
[1:42:31] it's like somebody just
[1:42:33] cuts the film
[1:42:34] it's like you're gone instantly because
[1:42:37] i was sitting there looking at them and
[1:42:39] then instantly
[1:42:41] the scene changed
[1:42:43] and they were saying to me uh hang in
[1:42:45] there mark hang in there we're almost
[1:42:47] there hang with us you'll be all right
[1:42:49] we're almost to the hospital
[1:42:51] and i said what's going on i had no
[1:42:54] recollection of anything
[1:42:55] and they told me
[1:42:56] your heart stopped
[1:42:58] and you were going for about two minutes
[1:43:00] we had to shock you twice to bring you
[1:43:01] back
[1:43:03] and the enormity of what i was
[1:43:06] in the middle of hitting me and i i was
[1:43:08] just overcome
[1:43:10] they had my right left arm you know
[1:43:11] strapped down with the cuff and the iv
[1:43:13] but i just i couldn't even pray i just
[1:43:16] i just reached my arm up towards the
[1:43:18] roof of that ambulance
[1:43:20] reaching out to god lord help me
[1:43:23] and and the paramedic was like what's
[1:43:24] wrong what are you doing i was like
[1:43:26] i'm just praying he was like well that's
[1:43:28] a good thing to do right now
[1:43:30] so so they they got me to the hospital
[1:43:33] they quickly unloaded me and rushed me
[1:43:35] in they took me into this big room
[1:43:37] bigger than what you would normally see
[1:43:38] in an emergency room and there was about
[1:43:40] 10 or 12 people waiting there for me so
[1:43:43] they quickly started
[1:43:44] working and
[1:43:46] they said we need to get an x-ray of
[1:43:47] your chest so they brought in this
[1:43:48] machine
[1:43:50] took an x-ray and uh it happened again
[1:43:54] my heart stopped again
[1:43:56] and um
[1:43:58] this time i came to myself hollering to
[1:44:00] the top of my lungs from the pain
[1:44:03] of the defibrillator
[1:44:05] and i once again what's going on they
[1:44:07] said your heart stopped again we had to
[1:44:08] do cpr
[1:44:10] and we had to shock you again to get
[1:44:12] your back
[1:44:13] and um
[1:44:14] so i you know i
[1:44:16] i'm not going to kid you i was scared i
[1:44:18] was really scared it's a
[1:44:20] you can't know what that feels like till
[1:44:22] you're in the middle of it knowing
[1:44:24] how close you are
[1:44:25] to leaving this mortal coil
[1:44:29] so anyway they quickly
[1:44:32] rushed me down a hall and into an
[1:44:33] operating room
[1:44:35] and uh it sedated me i was awake the
[1:44:37] whole time but they tried to go into my
[1:44:39] arm to do
[1:44:40] they couldn't get in so they went
[1:44:42] through my leg
[1:44:43] and they went in and the doctor said
[1:44:45] there was a 99 blockage
[1:44:48] in the circumplex artery which is
[1:44:51] covers the left side of your heart and
[1:44:52] feeds it so he said i'm gonna go ahead
[1:44:54] and take care of that you've got another
[1:44:56] blockage in the lat artery but it's too
[1:44:58] complicated for me to do right here
[1:45:00] so i'm gonna get you stable and then i
[1:45:02] want you to
[1:45:03] either we're gonna send you to our heart
[1:45:05] hospital
[1:45:06] or i'm gonna let you go home and
[1:45:08] you get it taken care of as soon as you
[1:45:10] can so i was like all right
[1:45:12] so they did that they released me
[1:45:15] i recovered quickly they said i was fine
[1:45:18] two days later they released me
[1:45:20] so wednesday morning we were going to
[1:45:21] head home
[1:45:22] and i was sitting
[1:45:24] in the lobby of the hotel there i just
[1:45:26] ate a yogurt
[1:45:28] i wasn't hungry but needed something
[1:45:31] and that feeling came back again as i
[1:45:33] was sitting there it wasn't as bad but i
[1:45:35] started sweating i was drenched in sweat
[1:45:37] so i laid down on the bench i told have
[1:45:39] you got to call 9-1-1 and i really
[1:45:41] believe that
[1:45:43] the enemy wanted me to make that trip
[1:45:45] home without having that
[1:45:48] taken care of
[1:45:49] because it turns out it was a bit worse
[1:45:51] than what that first doctor thought it
[1:45:52] was
[1:45:54] so they took me back and then um
[1:45:56] so that first cardiologist came in and
[1:45:58] said look i'm just gonna send you down
[1:45:59] to our um heart hospital in norfolk and
[1:46:02] we're gonna go ahead and get this taken
[1:46:03] care of while you're here
[1:46:05] which i was very happy to hear
[1:46:07] and um so they did they went in and i
[1:46:09] ended up getting a total of seven stents
[1:46:12] four in that circumflex artery and three
[1:46:14] in the lead artery
[1:46:16] and he told me while he was doing he
[1:46:17] said the blockage in your lat artery was
[1:46:19] substantially more than what that first
[1:46:21] doctor thought
[1:46:22] so it was a good thing you came here
[1:46:25] and uh i was laying there in that
[1:46:27] hospital room that night looking at the
[1:46:29] ceiling
[1:46:31] thinking about it all and the gun just
[1:46:33] he revealed something to me
[1:46:36] he said
[1:46:38] maybe this is just for me but
[1:46:42] he brought that memory to my mind
[1:46:46] that
[1:46:47] about that trip we made when i was a
[1:46:49] little boy
[1:46:50] so that i could be where i needed to be
[1:46:53] when that happened
[1:46:56] brother andrew cobb sent me a message of
[1:46:58] encouragement told me he was praying for
[1:46:59] me but
[1:47:00] he said in his opinion
[1:47:02] which is extensive he works in an
[1:47:04] emergency room he would know if anybody
[1:47:06] does
[1:47:08] he told me brother mark i'm just going
[1:47:10] to tell you that
[1:47:12] if this had happened to you at home or
[1:47:14] probably anywhere else you would not
[1:47:15] have made it there's no way first
[1:47:17] responders could have got to you in time
[1:47:19] you would have died
[1:47:22] then uh brother caleb campbell told me
[1:47:23] um afterwards in a chat he said that uh
[1:47:27] the last two years with hardieville fire
[1:47:29] department he's been on literally dozens
[1:47:33] of heart attack calls
[1:47:35] and in every one
[1:47:37] where cpr was initiated
[1:47:39] one person has made it
[1:47:41] one
[1:47:42] i'm a walking breathing miracle
[1:47:46] and i just want to give god
[1:47:59] wow
[1:48:01] god is good isn't he
[1:48:03] my goodness you know why should i worry
[1:48:05] why should i fear
[1:48:07] the very same jesus walking right here
[1:48:10] hallelujah amen we've got another one
[1:48:12] that we want to give god all the glory
[1:48:15] i'm going to ask brother jason to come
[1:48:16] we're going to set a chair out because
[1:48:18] he probably isn't strong enough to stand
[1:48:19] the whole time and so he'll stand as he
[1:48:22] can and seats be seated as is needed
[1:48:25] amen so god bless you brother god bless
[1:48:27] you we'll just keep this one on
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:42] god bless you all
[1:48:48] on
[1:48:49] at about 2 a.m on wednesday i couldn't
[1:48:51] get my
[1:48:53] breath and
[1:48:55] brother travis came and picked me up
[1:48:58] and
[1:48:59] brought me to
[1:49:00] beaufort memorial
[1:49:03] and um
[1:49:05] i i got in and they
[1:49:08] did all kinds of tests and
[1:49:11] so i had double covered pneumonia was in
[1:49:14] the er they brought me up to the
[1:49:16] pcu
[1:49:17] and
[1:49:19] started treating me
[1:49:21] and
[1:49:22] that was and then into thursday
[1:49:26] my mind began to slip
[1:49:28] away into delirium
[1:49:31] and
[1:49:33] didn't really know what was going on
[1:49:36] and with that i will
[1:49:38] turn it over to
[1:49:39] amy to talk thank you well pray for me
[1:49:44] um
[1:49:46] so i had been able to be in touch with
[1:49:48] him by text
[1:49:50] through the week
[1:49:51] and
[1:49:53] i was not worried
[1:49:56] i just i had faith but
[1:49:58] came to um
[1:50:00] friday night late i'd been in touch with
[1:50:03] him through
[1:50:04] friday evening and then it just stopped
[1:50:07] and it was about midnight and i couldn't
[1:50:08] go to sleep i just i had the feeling
[1:50:10] something was wrong
[1:50:12] and
[1:50:13] that whole night i couldn't sleep i woke
[1:50:16] up kept checking my phone there was just
[1:50:18] nothing
[1:50:19] and i was finally able to
[1:50:23] get a hold of his doctor saturday
[1:50:24] morning learned that he was he was
[1:50:26] really struggling with anxiety and
[1:50:29] i know him
[1:50:30] and he couldn't sleep and i know that
[1:50:32] that was an attack from the devil and
[1:50:35] so
[1:50:36] um i woke up i was i was a mess on
[1:50:39] saturday i just really was amber had
[1:50:41] texted me and asked if
[1:50:43] she needed me to come sit with her and
[1:50:44] just right away said yes i'd
[1:50:47] lord told me that i was going to need
[1:50:48] somebody that day
[1:50:50] she came over and sat with me and i just
[1:50:52] waited and waited and waited and finally
[1:50:54] i think it was about
[1:50:56] 4 30 and she's like just call so i
[1:50:58] called up i got a hold of the nurse and
[1:51:01] she had been in the room with him and i
[1:51:02] could hear the exhaustion in her voice
[1:51:05] and she gave me that update that he was
[1:51:07] delirious he didn't know who i was who
[1:51:10] the girls were where he was what his job
[1:51:12] was
[1:51:14] and they said they've got him down and
[1:51:15] see teaser this isn't normal with kovid
[1:51:18] we're working really hard to try and
[1:51:19] find out what's going on
[1:51:21] i hung up the phone and i just fell
[1:51:23] apart
[1:51:24] and as soon as i could get myself
[1:51:26] together i told amber we got text
[1:51:29] messages out to everybody i could think
[1:51:31] of to pray
[1:51:33] and the lord really spoke to me through
[1:51:35] two people brother don gurgle
[1:51:37] texted me back right away and he said
[1:51:39] don't worry about that sister amy that's
[1:51:41] just the devil trying to scare you
[1:51:44] and amber had been sitting there praying
[1:51:46] with me and she said amy and god's
[1:51:49] telling me one thing
[1:51:50] that's it you have to choose to believe
[1:51:52] him you have to choose to believe that
[1:51:54] he's going to be okay
[1:51:56] and through those two people the lord
[1:51:58] calmed in my spirit
[1:52:00] and
[1:52:03] we just kept praying
[1:52:04] there was still something that wasn't
[1:52:06] settled in me though i believed
[1:52:08] but
[1:52:11] the lord still had something to do for
[1:52:13] me and it's you preached on perfect
[1:52:15] faith that was what god used
[1:52:18] to speak to me and he spoke to me in
[1:52:20] just an amazing way
[1:52:24] sunday my niece flew in to help us and
[1:52:29] i had to go pick her up at the airport
[1:52:31] in hilton head and
[1:52:36] i was on the way there i was driving
[1:52:38] and also and i get a text from him and
[1:52:40] this is the first text that i've gotten
[1:52:42] since um
[1:52:45] friday night
[1:52:46] and it was letters
[1:52:48] he couldn't his mind was still not there
[1:52:50] it was letters
[1:52:52] and one word
[1:52:53] and i just started crying because i said
[1:52:55] lord thank you he's trying at least he's
[1:52:57] got enough thought to try
[1:53:00] and the only thing that was pressed on
[1:53:03] me
[1:53:04] to try and somehow
[1:53:06] activate his faith so to get him
[1:53:10] looking to the lord because i knew with
[1:53:12] that delirium that he couldn't
[1:53:16] so i started texting him and i started
[1:53:19] sending him
[1:53:21] just asking jason do you believe do you
[1:53:24] believe and he couldn't answer me and i
[1:53:26] was like if i can just get him to
[1:53:27] respond yes that's all i need
[1:53:30] and
[1:53:32] that i will that morning um i had we had
[1:53:34] streamed our church in minnesota and
[1:53:36] there was a
[1:53:37] guest
[1:53:39] minister who was reading from perfect
[1:53:41] faith
[1:53:42] and he read this quote and it was what
[1:53:45] the lord
[1:53:46] grabbed to start
[1:53:53] and it's this first one and watch a
[1:53:55] perfect god with a perfect heart
[1:53:57] keep a perfect promise by his perfect
[1:53:59] word
[1:54:00] and that just reached out and grabbed me
[1:54:04] and the lord started to work so when i
[1:54:05] got in the car to go to pick up my niece
[1:54:09] i put on perfect faith and we listened
[1:54:11] to it the whole way there
[1:54:13] i got to
[1:54:14] a store to run an errand and i was just
[1:54:16] sitting in the car and he texted me
[1:54:20] one word and it was miracle and it was
[1:54:22] followed by another word need
[1:54:25] and that was when i was impressed lord i
[1:54:27] gotta get his faith on you i gotta get
[1:54:29] him to somehow if he can't see anything
[1:54:31] else
[1:54:31] to see you
[1:54:34] and he couldn't respond to me he
[1:54:35] couldn't respond to me couldn't respond
[1:54:37] to me so we kept driving
[1:54:40] and
[1:54:41] um
[1:54:42] i was just i was kind of wrestling this
[1:54:44] out with the lord
[1:54:46] and
[1:54:47] we were bluffed in and it was impressed
[1:54:49] in my heart that i needed some time
[1:54:51] by myself with god and so
[1:54:53] the girls were hungry and
[1:54:56] we
[1:54:57] i pulled into a chipotle and i didn't
[1:54:59] even have to say a word my niece piped
[1:55:00] up and she said hey
[1:55:02] why don't i take the girls in for you
[1:55:04] and you can just have some time and i
[1:55:05] said that's exactly what i need thank
[1:55:07] you so she took the girls in
[1:55:09] and brother branham came on on this next
[1:55:11] quote
[1:55:12] in
[1:55:13] perfect faith
[1:55:15] and spoke to my heart
[1:55:17] and said
[1:55:18] if he can lift me up with a faith this
[1:55:21] way even for the people even if they
[1:55:23] can't climb to that bracket
[1:55:25] if he can't they can't do it he can use
[1:55:27] my faith
[1:55:28] he can lift me up to that place and i'm
[1:55:30] climbing for you i'm believing for you
[1:55:33] i'm speaking for you
[1:55:35] i'm your brother standing as you
[1:55:37] standing as your brother and intercessor
[1:55:39] trying my best to hold you before god
[1:55:42] and i'm standing here right before the
[1:55:44] white throne now and staking that
[1:55:46] pointing my finger to that bloody
[1:55:47] sacrifice there
[1:55:49] and speaking through his name that it's
[1:55:51] done it has to happen it has to happen
[1:55:54] you know what's happened and i know it's
[1:55:56] happened
[1:55:57] so do you know that it's happened
[1:56:00] and right there i said lord it's okay if
[1:56:02] he can't believe because i can
[1:56:04] i can do it
[1:56:07] and the very next thing
[1:56:10] that came up and this is why we're all
[1:56:12] here today he says when you get back
[1:56:14] here next sunday you give the testimony
[1:56:16] of how you are healed
[1:56:18] and what happened this week watch and
[1:56:19] see what happened it's over
[1:56:23] and
[1:56:24] i just sat in my car in the parking lot
[1:56:26] and just worshiped lord i had my hands
[1:56:28] in the air and i was bawling
[1:56:31] and then at the very
[1:56:32] two minutes to the end of perfect faith
[1:56:35] and brother branham is about to close
[1:56:38] and there's this tongues
[1:56:39] and an interpretation afterward
[1:56:42] and we know that god isn't limited by
[1:56:45] time and space
[1:56:47] and all he can tell you
[1:56:49] is 58 years ago god spoke to me
[1:56:52] for him
[1:56:53] because i heard this interpretation
[1:56:56] and it was god's voice to me
[1:56:59] and i'm going to try to get through it
[1:57:02] is not my word real in the hearts of
[1:57:04] those in whom i will reveal it saith the
[1:57:06] lord thy god
[1:57:07] yea and is not my word sharp even as i
[1:57:09] have spoken this night yea sharper than
[1:57:12] a two-edged sword
[1:57:13] yeah i say unto thee my arm is not
[1:57:15] shortened that i cannot heal and yea my
[1:57:18] heart is not dull that i cannot hear thy
[1:57:19] prayer see us lord thy god
[1:57:21] yay look into me
[1:57:24] and know that yes that shall be
[1:57:26] performed which i have promised unto
[1:57:27] thee saith the lord thy god
[1:57:29] ye know ye
[1:57:31] that the truth was broken unto you this
[1:57:33] night
[1:57:34] yea that the miracle that i have
[1:57:35] promised the yea
[1:57:37] are already taking place
[1:57:39] yea they are coming to pass saith the
[1:57:41] lord thy god
[1:57:42] know ye and let this word be confirmed
[1:57:44] in thy heart
[1:57:45] that i have dealt with thee and will be
[1:57:48] with you saith the lord
[1:57:50] and i sat and just left and praised the
[1:57:52] lord because from that point on it was
[1:57:56] finished i had no doubt
[1:57:58] not as i
[1:58:00] took a note from sister rachel and i
[1:58:01] pray i had to transcribe that because it
[1:58:03] wasn't transcribed in the book
[1:58:05] i printed it off and it is plastered all
[1:58:07] over my house so that everywhere i could
[1:58:10] see and i
[1:58:11] could point to that promise that was
[1:58:13] mine
[1:58:14] and there was nothing that could cause
[1:58:16] me to doubt it after that i
[1:58:20] i
[1:58:21] he took it over and then i came home and
[1:58:23] i knew there was some point in there
[1:58:25] that um
[1:58:26] brother branham had talked about the
[1:58:28] prayer cloth and it was right here and
[1:58:30] said also with my hands upon these
[1:58:31] handkerchiefs laying here i've been
[1:58:33] watching it close and i'm believing that
[1:58:35] they'll produce just exactly what the
[1:58:36] people requested
[1:58:38] i believe it and i called i think i
[1:58:42] texted sister emily and just said
[1:58:44] can i get you guys a prayer cloth for
[1:58:46] andrew to bring him and she said
[1:58:48] absolutely i came and brought it to her
[1:58:50] and she said you know what yeah andrew
[1:58:51] and i are going to pray over it that
[1:58:54] brother branham had a great tradeoff it
[1:58:55] was one of brother brandon's class and
[1:58:57] she said um andrew and i are going to
[1:58:59] pray over it before he brings it up and
[1:59:03] i saw that too and i texted her
[1:59:05] that it'll happen just exactly what the
[1:59:06] people requested
[1:59:08] so for me
[1:59:10] this was settled last sunday but there
[1:59:12] was a huge work
[1:59:14] that the lord how he did it was up to
[1:59:15] him and jason
[1:59:17] and he did
[1:59:18] something just unbelievable through
[1:59:20] jason then
[1:59:21] satan brought a perfectly
[1:59:24] coordinated
[1:59:25] terrorist strike against every weakness
[1:59:30] he wanted to manipulate in me
[1:59:35] something that he
[1:59:38] this this was like
[1:59:40] a
[1:59:41] a demonic
[1:59:43] plan that was put together
[1:59:46] i don't know over a decade
[1:59:49] with
[1:59:50] pieces of the puzzle
[1:59:52] that he had worked on
[1:59:53] slowly
[1:59:55] in my life to create
[1:59:57] weaknesses to create complexes
[2:00:01] to create
[2:00:03] difficult
[2:00:04] uh
[2:00:05] ways of of handling things
[2:00:09] in order to bring it to this point to
[2:00:11] take me
[2:00:14] i went i went into that hospital and
[2:00:17] before i went into the hospital
[2:00:20] there was a very
[2:00:22] heavy darkness over
[2:00:24] me
[2:00:25] my faith was
[2:00:27] almost
[2:00:28] gone
[2:00:30] i was
[2:00:32] at the weakest point
[2:00:36] i
[2:00:38] i don't see brother andrew and i'm
[2:00:39] really glad that i don't see him because
[2:00:41] i think i would
[2:00:43] fall fall to pieces i see his brother
[2:00:45] there so
[2:00:46] that's just a little help but
[2:00:48] um
[2:00:50] brother andrew
[2:00:51] is god's softest handed angel
[2:00:56] i
[2:00:57] god used him
[2:00:59] to bring light
[2:01:01] i was in a dark
[2:01:03] tunnel
[2:01:04] i did not know what was happening
[2:01:07] that there was
[2:01:09] i could sense the presences presence of
[2:01:12] p nurses and i know that
[2:01:16] i know that everyone was trying to help
[2:01:20] everyone was trying to assist me
[2:01:22] so when you hear me talk
[2:01:24] i'm not trying to say that
[2:01:26] the nurses were devils or
[2:01:29] anything like that i understand they
[2:01:31] were trying to help but this was a
[2:01:34] personal torment created by
[2:01:38] satan as a terrorist strike
[2:01:41] against me
[2:01:46] there was
[2:01:48] a doctor that was just like a
[2:01:51] when he came in the room it was just
[2:01:52] like a tool it seemed like i couldn't
[2:01:55] understand
[2:01:56] what
[2:01:57] um
[2:01:58] i couldn't i could i couldn't connect to
[2:02:00] him i couldn't understand what was what
[2:02:02] he how he was communicating i don't want
[2:02:05] to
[2:02:06] dwell on that but
[2:02:08] what i'm trying to say is there was a
[2:02:09] nurse
[2:02:10] very soft presence trying to help
[2:02:13] there's another nurse
[2:02:15] this is just in delirium very harsh hard
[2:02:18] presence i was
[2:02:19] they had to restrain me they had to put
[2:02:22] white
[2:02:24] like gloves
[2:02:25] that were instead of
[2:02:27] putting the straight jacket on people
[2:02:29] they put these things on
[2:02:31] and i was
[2:02:32] i was burning and ripping them off
[2:02:34] and
[2:02:36] i was
[2:02:37] screaming for my wife
[2:02:39] and my family
[2:02:41] and i was just totally totally delirious
[2:02:44] and when all this is happening
[2:02:48] i think we're done with the powerpoint
[2:02:50] brothers it's all right
[2:02:52] when this was happening
[2:02:54] uh
[2:02:56] different times brother andrew would
[2:03:05] it it was there was a light that came
[2:03:07] into the room
[2:03:08] and i could come to myself and i was
[2:03:10] andrew
[2:03:12] andrew
[2:03:14] and
[2:03:15] i don't
[2:03:16] know much of what transpired until
[2:03:19] sunday night when he brought the prayer
[2:03:21] cloth
[2:03:23] on sunday night when he brought the
[2:03:24] prayer cloth
[2:03:26] the i did not yet come in contact with
[2:03:32] the promise but the promise
[2:03:34] came in contact with me
[2:03:36] through the prayer cloth
[2:03:38] and brother andrew praying
[2:03:40] over me and i went from being
[2:03:44] delirious and uncooperative to being
[2:03:47] cooperative
[2:03:49] and coming
[2:03:50] into my right mind however i was heavily
[2:03:53] heavily sedated
[2:03:56] during all this
[2:03:58] my personality i'm i'm very independent
[2:04:01] and i don't there's
[2:04:04] i don't want to be helped with lots of
[2:04:06] different things so this is this is
[2:04:09] it was just
[2:04:10] i don't want to go into too many details
[2:04:12] it's hospital stuff
[2:04:14] but
[2:04:15] there was many things that i feared over
[2:04:17] my lifetime
[2:04:19] that have came upon me during this time
[2:04:22] i was extreme they had to keep me dry
[2:04:24] because of my lungs
[2:04:26] covered pneumonia
[2:04:27] i was extremely dry they
[2:04:30] they it felt like
[2:04:32] they sent person after person to
[2:04:35] use needles to chew on my arms i'm just
[2:04:38] bruised all up and down my arms because
[2:04:40] they couldn't get
[2:04:42] couldn't draw blood
[2:04:45] these are all things were happening now
[2:04:47] after i remember
[2:04:49] from sunday night
[2:04:51] on
[2:04:52] i'm still not i'm still not in contact
[2:04:55] with god
[2:04:56] yet god's in contact with me
[2:04:59] through my because my wife
[2:05:02] and and all the saints around the world
[2:05:06] praying
[2:05:08] brought me
[2:05:10] and
[2:05:11] opened the roof
[2:05:13] and lowered me to jesus
[2:05:16] but especially my wife did that
[2:05:19] but
[2:05:24] um
[2:05:25] on monday and into tuesday i kind of
[2:05:27] don't remember anything tuesday i start
[2:05:29] coming
[2:05:31] back
[2:05:32] and the strangest thing is god was going
[2:05:34] to use anything to get
[2:05:36] back in contact with me
[2:05:38] and someone said why don't you turn the
[2:05:40] tv on
[2:05:41] and watch something
[2:05:43] and so i turned the tv on and i started
[2:05:45] dialing around i was looking for a
[2:05:47] cooking show to watch
[2:05:49] or
[2:05:49] news or weather or something and it came
[2:05:52] and it stopped
[2:05:54] i stopped somehow on a spider-man
[2:05:59] show and but it's funny but you have to
[2:06:01] understand
[2:06:04] this
[2:06:05] this was god
[2:06:07] going to talk to me in a very strange
[2:06:09] way
[2:06:11] spider spiderman was
[2:06:13] being
[2:06:14] directly attacked to be destroyed
[2:06:18] and this mysterio person
[2:06:22] was using
[2:06:24] a.i to
[2:06:26] deceive his
[2:06:28] eyes
[2:06:29] he put him in another
[2:06:31] dimension and he was
[2:06:35] trying to
[2:06:36] destroy the character and he was trying
[2:06:39] to destroy the life
[2:06:41] of spider-man
[2:06:45] and
[2:06:47] he almost did
[2:06:49] but then
[2:06:52] spider-man came came back and he he
[2:06:55] realized he had to see he had to
[2:06:59] remember
[2:07:00] what was real
[2:07:02] and then he could fight
[2:07:05] mysterio and defeat him
[2:07:07] i'm just watching this i'm like what am
[2:07:08] i watching this for
[2:07:13] and that and and then all of the all of
[2:07:15] it and it was finished and the it was
[2:07:18] over with and i was still
[2:07:20] quite delirious
[2:07:22] and then the the next day it just struck
[2:07:25] me as a revelation you have to get come
[2:07:28] back
[2:07:29] to what is real and see what is real so
[2:07:32] that you can fight
[2:07:34] in the afternoon on wednesday amy
[2:07:37] sent me a text because she had already
[2:07:40] sent me all this information and i did
[2:07:41] not connect with it at all
[2:07:45] by by text
[2:07:47] and
[2:07:49] so
[2:07:50] i am in
[2:07:53] it's in the afternoon on wednesday she
[2:07:55] sends psalm 34 has been rolling through
[2:07:58] my mind
[2:07:59] a lot
[2:08:01] and
[2:08:03] that struck an accord i was coming to
[2:08:07] enough
[2:08:09] that i saw this poor man cried and the
[2:08:11] lord heard him
[2:08:13] and delivered him
[2:08:14] from his enemies and
[2:08:18] that just rolled and rolled and rolled
[2:08:20] in my mind so i pulled up shane and
[2:08:22] shane on
[2:08:23] youtube and listened to it
[2:08:25] and then
[2:08:27] um
[2:08:28] the next song that came up is the one
[2:08:30] that sister is gonna sing for us
[2:08:32] here soon i was thinking of the goodness
[2:08:35] of god
[2:08:37] and
[2:08:39] god started
[2:08:40] showing me
[2:08:42] speaking to me
[2:08:43] the purpose behind all of all of
[2:08:45] this happening that satan meant it for
[2:08:48] evil but god means it for good
[2:08:50] and that god has a purpose in all of it
[2:08:53] and that through suffering
[2:08:54] god
[2:08:56] that through this suffering god is going
[2:08:57] to be glorified
[2:09:00] and
[2:09:01] all of a sudden the picture of my father
[2:09:05] and how he would handle
[2:09:07] situations
[2:09:09] in his life came and came in front of me
[2:09:12] and i said
[2:09:14] to myself i am going home
[2:09:17] i am healed
[2:09:19] and i am going home
[2:09:22] and i
[2:09:24] i um all of this
[2:09:26] they're
[2:09:28] they're still working on my arms i'm
[2:09:29] still
[2:09:30] basically tethered to the bed
[2:09:33] because they're worried about blood
[2:09:35] blood clots and you so you can't hardly
[2:09:37] move your legs you can't hardly move
[2:09:38] your body
[2:09:40] i i'm in my own personal torment
[2:09:44] at the time with no freedom no
[2:09:47] ability to get out of the bed and
[2:09:49] not nothing
[2:09:51] and so so weak
[2:09:52] and pain everywhere
[2:09:54] and
[2:09:55] um
[2:09:56] the the doctors are even coming in and
[2:09:58] saying are you are you an alcoholic
[2:10:00] because they're looking at my
[2:10:02] numbers in my liver and saying you must
[2:10:05] be an alcoholic
[2:10:06] and
[2:10:08] i i can't tell you how many times they
[2:10:10] asked do i drink
[2:10:12] do you drink do you drink do you drink
[2:10:13] do you drink do you drink do you drink
[2:10:14] do you drink
[2:10:17] and um
[2:10:20] let me
[2:10:21] slow myself down so
[2:10:23] the doctor
[2:10:24] came to talk to me on
[2:10:27] wednesday that's one of the things that
[2:10:29] he talked to me about but he saw that my
[2:10:32] covet was getting better
[2:10:34] and
[2:10:35] he said we're gonna we we if you start
[2:10:38] if you keep improving we're gonna move
[2:10:40] you from icu to pcu
[2:10:43] i'm so delirious i don't even know what
[2:10:45] in the world that means
[2:10:46] it must be a good thing i guess
[2:10:51] so then
[2:10:53] i i improved so much on wednesday they
[2:10:55] did they moved me through wednesday
[2:10:58] i was still really struggling about how
[2:11:00] to put sentences together
[2:11:02] um how to talk amy has
[2:11:04] um
[2:11:06] voice texts for me that are just
[2:11:08] probably are so ridiculous
[2:11:10] that
[2:11:11] i don't know you know i would say a word
[2:11:14] and then 5 seconds 10 15 seconds later i
[2:11:16] would say another word but it wouldn't
[2:11:18] be the right word
[2:11:19] and so that's just how everything was
[2:11:22] going but i think it was that day that
[2:11:25] andrew came and i asked him about the
[2:11:27] wedding and he almost fell over
[2:11:30] um
[2:11:30] he was so shocked that i was had come
[2:11:32] too he said told amy i was a brand i was
[2:11:35] a new new man
[2:11:37] but
[2:11:38] i think i'm i'm fuzzy here but i i think
[2:11:42] the doctor did come to speak to me or
[2:11:44] that or the nurse
[2:11:46] told me about moving to pcu
[2:11:48] perhaps on
[2:11:50] um
[2:11:52] on
[2:11:53] wednesday night and they they actually
[2:11:55] ended up late wednesday night moving me
[2:11:57] to
[2:11:58] pcu
[2:11:59] and
[2:12:00] that's when really the spiritual
[2:12:02] a new form of spiritual warfare
[2:12:05] started happening when i moved to that
[2:12:07] other
[2:12:08] room is it's strange but it was a it was
[2:12:11] a full moon and when i was in that room
[2:12:14] um the hospital was like
[2:12:17] an explosion
[2:12:19] it was so crazy
[2:12:21] i i would call and people i wouldn't get
[2:12:24] help it would take hours for
[2:12:26] the um
[2:12:29] the nurses to come and help me sometimes
[2:12:31] with different things that i needed help
[2:12:32] with it was very difficult they or
[2:12:34] because of the elevated liver numbers
[2:12:36] they ordered a uh ultrasound and it was
[2:12:39] it was like someone was taking a knife
[2:12:42] and
[2:12:42] rubbing it all around my body it hurt so
[2:12:45] bad and it which made me so
[2:12:48] scared the devil said see you got cancer
[2:12:51] you got cancer in your liver and it was
[2:12:53] just
[2:12:54] it was i was terrified
[2:12:56] i didn't know what was happening and the
[2:12:57] doctor was so busy because every time a
[2:13:00] nurse said you got to go talk to him
[2:13:01] you've got to go talk to him he
[2:13:03] couldn't he couldn't get there he got
[2:13:05] called to another emergency well
[2:13:07] throughout the day
[2:13:08] i'm saying i'm i'm going home tomorrow
[2:13:12] i'm going home i'm going home tomorrow
[2:13:14] i'm done i need to heal at home with my
[2:13:17] family
[2:13:18] and
[2:13:20] so on
[2:13:23] about about five o'clock i decided i'm
[2:13:26] going to stand up and walk around the
[2:13:27] room
[2:13:29] so i stood up and i started walking
[2:13:30] around the room because that was one of
[2:13:32] the things they said you're gonna have
[2:13:33] to have to walk for six minutes before
[2:13:36] we let you
[2:13:37] go
[2:13:38] so i stood up and walked up and around
[2:13:40] the room
[2:13:41] for 15 minutes sat down five minutes
[2:13:43] later the doctor came in
[2:13:45] he's he started talking to me and i said
[2:13:48] i'm go i need to go home
[2:13:50] and he kind of was had a smirk on his
[2:13:52] face like
[2:13:54] probably monday he'll go home
[2:13:57] and i i said no
[2:14:00] i want to go home tonight or tomorrow
[2:14:03] and he said well tell me about your your
[2:14:05] day so he started talking about the
[2:14:08] alcohol again
[2:14:09] and then he started asking about my
[2:14:13] lungs and he said what's that thing that
[2:14:15] i
[2:14:16] there's a spirometer that's like a it
[2:14:18] tests and also helps you
[2:14:22] with breathing but no one can find it
[2:14:24] and i didn't have it so i was just doing
[2:14:26] my own
[2:14:27] uh lung exercises throughout the day
[2:14:30] and
[2:14:31] he came and gave it to me and he was
[2:14:33] hit
[2:14:34] he his eyes got big and said you what
[2:14:37] your lungs are really strong right now
[2:14:39] really strong
[2:14:41] so he said we started talking and i was
[2:14:44] just i my my dad could convince people
[2:14:48] so easily of
[2:14:49] what he wanted he just asked for it he
[2:14:52] said just ask for it that's what i i
[2:14:54] texted my dad what do i say to this
[2:14:55] doctor he says just ask tell him you
[2:14:58] need to go home and recover with your
[2:14:59] family she said i told him i need to go
[2:15:02] home
[2:15:03] and recover with my family i'm good
[2:15:05] enough to do that now
[2:15:07] he's he said
[2:15:10] and he looked at my breathing and he
[2:15:11] said
[2:15:12] i will order a six minute walking
[2:15:15] test tomorrow and if you pass it you'll
[2:15:18] go home
[2:15:20] and
[2:15:21] i was so happy
[2:15:24] but there was still spiritual battles
[2:15:26] going on i
[2:15:28] um
[2:15:29] that that evening i've i finally fell
[2:15:32] asleep with a deep sleep from 9 30 to
[2:15:34] about 12 30 but god woke me up
[2:15:37] 12 30
[2:15:39] and
[2:15:40] told me to started speaking to me
[2:15:43] he told me take off your oxygen
[2:15:47] and stand up
[2:15:48] so i took off my oxygen but i thought
[2:15:50] why do i need to stand up
[2:15:52] so then
[2:15:54] it was just a spiritual battle taking
[2:15:55] place
[2:15:56] and i took off my oxygen
[2:15:59] and i was just talking to the lord and
[2:16:01] he was he was giving me songs and he was
[2:16:04] he was encouraging my faith
[2:16:06] and
[2:16:08] throughout this throughout this
[2:16:11] time
[2:16:12] i just had my oxygen up i think i texted
[2:16:14] a few different people in the middle of
[2:16:16] the night a selfie with my oxygen off
[2:16:19] said i'm going home
[2:16:21] um
[2:16:24] and so they
[2:16:27] um
[2:16:28] about
[2:16:30] it was through the night 12 between 12
[2:16:32] 30 and
[2:16:33] 4 30 that i was awake
[2:16:35] worshiping and
[2:16:37] praising the lord and thanking him for
[2:16:39] my healing
[2:16:40] and with all the time with my oxygen off
[2:16:42] and i kept looking at my numbers and
[2:16:44] that oxygen levels kept staying between
[2:16:47] 92 and 95
[2:16:49] my heart rate's elevated because it's
[2:16:52] that that all that stills figuring
[2:16:54] itself out but
[2:16:56] the the oxygen saturation levels were
[2:16:59] just
[2:17:00] fine
[2:17:01] no no problem so then finally i stood up
[2:17:04] i felt so
[2:17:06] strong
[2:17:07] when i stood up i didn't feel that
[2:17:09] weight weakness or dizziness or anything
[2:17:11] and i was just like
[2:17:13] rejoicing
[2:17:14] so i sat down
[2:17:16] and
[2:17:18] you know through all of this there's so
[2:17:19] many different things that happened in
[2:17:21] the middle of the night
[2:17:23] a brother from israel sent an offering
[2:17:26] to me that was
[2:17:29] such the perfect amount that we needed
[2:17:32] that it was absolutely
[2:17:34] incredible and i said god what are you
[2:17:36] doing this is this is amazing

[2:17:42] and
[2:17:44] so but all the time battling you better

[2:17:54] take that keep that off what are you
[2:17:56] doing keep that off
[2:17:58] so all this time this is happening
[2:18:01] all of a sudden a vision happened
[2:18:04] and
[2:18:05] this little
[2:18:07] demonic
[2:18:08] had uh like like it looked like just a
[2:18:12] sith
[2:18:14] it started just the head walked into the
[2:18:16] room
[2:18:17] and it said
[2:18:19] the dark lord has demanded you
[2:18:21] and i i immediately fear
[2:18:24] seized me and i said
[2:18:27] i said lord
[2:18:29] take your mighty hand
[2:18:31] and and destroy the enemy and i i saw
[2:18:34] a hand with with a light
[2:18:37] at the end of it come and struck down
[2:18:40] and it was like a
[2:18:43] and
[2:18:44] the
[2:18:45] the enemy left
[2:18:47] and i said lord cover this
[2:18:49] room with your angelic
[2:18:51] light
[2:18:52] and i didn't see any light
[2:18:54] but the presence of the lord was there
[2:18:57] dro driving back the enemy the enemy
[2:19:00] spoke again i said this room is covered
[2:19:02] by the blood of jesus christ i am
[2:19:04] covered by the blood of jesus christ
[2:19:07] and i am going home
[2:19:11] a sweet peace came over me over the room
[2:19:15] and i went to sleep
[2:19:18] the story is not finished yet
[2:19:22] i went to sleep
[2:19:24] not long after that i was awoken by
[2:19:30] someone in my room
[2:19:32] worshiping and praising god
[2:19:36] a faithful
[2:19:37] gullah
[2:19:38] sister was in my room a nurse
[2:19:42] and she said oh sweet jesus
[2:19:45] hallelujah praise the lord
[2:19:49] god sent me to this room
[2:19:52] i knew i was going to come and speak to
[2:19:54] someone
[2:19:55] today
[2:19:56] and i
[2:19:58] i woke up and i felt a spiritual warfare
[2:20:02] taking place
[2:20:04] i said what is happening
[2:20:06] who is in my room i thought there was an
[2:20:08] angel in my room
[2:20:10] i was still coming to finally i realized
[2:20:12] it was a gullah woman and she was
[2:20:14] worshiping she was praising she was she
[2:20:17] said you're healed
[2:20:19] you took your oxygen off i said i took
[2:20:22] my oxygen off i am healed hallelujah and
[2:20:25] she said
[2:20:26] i see you took it off hallelujah jesus
[2:20:29] healed you
[2:20:31] he
[2:20:32] i don't know who you are
[2:20:34] i don't know what purpose god has for
[2:20:36] you but he has healed you he is sending
[2:20:39] you home today when you get home you
[2:20:42] listen to god because he has something
[2:20:45] for you to do
[2:20:48] but you wait on him and you listen to
[2:20:50] him only
[2:20:52] now earlier in the night
[2:20:56] the lord told when he when the lord was
[2:20:57] waking me up he said drink your healing
[2:21:01] and breathe me in and breathe me out
[2:21:05] so i was just drinking water i drink
[2:21:07] water drink water i called the nurse i
[2:21:10] dr i probably drink they have those big
[2:21:12] things of water with
[2:21:14] ice in them i probably drank four or
[2:21:16] five of those and i did i felt as i was
[2:21:19] growing in strength as i was getting
[2:21:21] more of those
[2:21:23] i think at 3 30 a woman came to take my
[2:21:26] blood she came in and was out in a
[2:21:29] minute and a half
[2:21:31] so fast before they couldn't even get my
[2:21:33] blood but because the lord was telling
[2:21:34] me to drink water
[2:21:37] it was it was easy no problem so through
[2:21:40] all of this this lady comes in can you
[2:21:42] imagine
[2:21:44] this lady comes into the room
[2:21:47] and just starts worshiping and praising
[2:21:49] and it
[2:21:50] it was like
[2:21:52] it i don't know if any of you have read
[2:21:54] or heard this present darkness or
[2:21:57] piercing the darkness but
[2:21:59] god satan had a
[2:22:01] a perfect strike planned against me
[2:22:04] to take me out
[2:22:06] and god was
[2:22:08] a hundred steps ahead of him the whole
[2:22:10] time
[2:22:11] and hidden he was hidden
[2:22:13] from satan's view most of that time
[2:22:16] and at the very end he chose a little
[2:22:18] gull of woman from ridgeland south
[2:22:21] carolina as the final blow
[2:22:24] against the enemy
[2:22:25] that woman
[2:22:27] that woman
[2:22:28] which when i
[2:22:30] called and said so then i didn't finish
[2:22:33] the story
[2:22:34] so then
[2:22:35] in the morning
[2:22:36] after that woman came she encouraged me
[2:22:39] spoke to spoke to me
[2:22:41] the
[2:22:42] respiratory nurse came
[2:22:44] and said
[2:22:46] um
[2:22:47] well you're looking they're looking good
[2:22:49] stand up and start marching and i just
[2:22:52] said start march why would she even use
[2:22:54] that terminology so i stood up
[2:22:56] i had no oxygen on she's like why don't
[2:22:58] you have your oxygen on i said i don't
[2:22:59] need it
[2:23:00] wow
[2:23:01] i said yes praise the lord she said yes
[2:23:04] praise the lord
[2:23:06] god has strange purposes but he works
[2:23:09] so i stood up and started marching and
[2:23:11] she's just like this look at your
[2:23:12] numbers they're not even changing
[2:23:15] and of course my heart rate was like 140
[2:23:17] but
[2:23:18] my oxygen level
[2:23:21] stayed the same the whole time she's
[2:23:23] like okay you can stop put you put your
[2:23:25] hands up and down then my oxygen numbers
[2:23:27] went higher
[2:23:29] and she said all right you're going home
[2:23:33] praise the lord
[2:23:36] and
[2:23:39] so then the doctor came and the the
[2:23:42] doctor came and spoke to me and he was
[2:23:44] he was amazed at the turn around
[2:23:46] everyone was amazed at the turnaround
[2:23:49] then they they got me
[2:23:51] i was able to get dressed and
[2:23:53] that one i called and said
[2:23:56] my um
[2:23:57] my ride is here that do you know that
[2:23:59] gullah woman i it was like somebody was
[2:24:02] beaten down
[2:24:03] the hallway to get a uh
[2:24:06] a wheelchair
[2:24:08] and she came and brought me out to my
[2:24:11] family

[2:24:33] purpose for your life
[2:24:35] and i want the last thing that i want to
[2:24:37] say is

[2:24:40] that this is not
[2:24:42] a family
[2:24:44] does not know what they're talking about
[2:24:47] this
[2:24:49] people took
[2:24:51] time
[2:24:52] out of their schedule they dropped
[2:24:53] everything
[2:24:55] to help us
[2:24:57] they came in the middle of the night
[2:24:58] they answered calls in the middle of the
[2:25:00] night
[2:25:01] andrew while he's preparing
[2:25:04] for his
[2:25:05] family's wedding
[2:25:09] even when he wasn't supposed to be

[2:25:18] people brought meals
[2:25:21] people ordered groceries for us

[2:25:27] and if god had to
[2:25:30] just about kill me
[2:25:32] in order to manifest that and to bring
[2:25:35] something out of it this was not
[2:25:37] something that was coordinated by anyone
[2:25:40] but the holy spirit
