[40:01] there's the the application side of it
[40:04] amen every time well god bless you again
[40:07] amen happy to be back here in the pulpit
[40:09] this morning had a nice time in the
[40:13] sunday-school class and so just looking
[40:15] forward to what the Lord has for us
[40:18] further amen and want to take a subject
[40:21] today the end of the eden compromise
[40:24] want to invite you into your Bibles to
[40:26] Genesis chapter 3 I've got some
[40:34] announcements I want to make and so let
[40:40] me just set you down for a minute while
[40:42] I make these announcements and just stay
[40:43] where you are musicians want everybody
[40:45] to hear this and especially online all
[40:49] others also so I was kind of notifying
[40:55] you this morning there's some things
[40:56] that look like they're coming down the
[40:58] pipe from the government there's been a
[41:01] question between the governor of our
[41:03] state and the Attorney General about
[41:06] requiring face masks by mandatory
[41:10] requirement when you're in public now of
[41:14] course there's the whole can of worms
[41:15] what does that mean you know in your own
[41:17] private business is a church a business
[41:20] all these kind of legal questions and
[41:22] you know there's a certain amount of a
[41:26] certain amount of compliance that you
[41:31] require that you that we need as a
[41:34] church to go along otherwise we lose our
[41:37] nonprofit status and then none of your
[41:41] contributions are tax deductible anymore
[41:43] sudden
[41:43] they can charge property tax to this
[41:46] property this would be a big financial
[41:49] hit on us as a church because we are in
[41:53] fact a church and we have one purpose
[41:57] here and that's to lift up Christ to the
[41:59] to the world so the governor was
[42:02] thinking that there is no way to make
[42:04] that legal that it's against our
[42:06] constitutional rights the Attorney
[42:08] General South Carolina weighed in to
[42:10] said it's perfectly legal now that
[42:11] doesn't mean anything because then
[42:13] judges can overrule him so you know the
[42:16] nation the world is in chaos right now
[42:18] and you know you can have governors and
[42:23] turny generals doing one thing and then
[42:25] you know here the governor of New York
[42:27] and the mayor of New York City just came
[42:31] under a federal federal judge ruled
[42:34] heavily against them to say you know you
[42:36] can't force that you know all these
[42:38] things you're trying to force on
[42:39] churches when you yourselves are out
[42:40] there marching in the streets you know a
[42:44] thousands of people shoulder to shoulder
[42:45] then you're gonna come around and tell
[42:46] churches that they can't worship you
[42:49] know with more than a few people so
[42:51] these kinds of things right now are just
[42:54] topsy-turvy there is we don't know
[42:56] what's going to happen it may come
[42:58] Buford City
[42:59] I think Buford City Council was voting
[43:02] on whether or not to require that inside
[43:04] the city limits which we are inside the
[43:07] city limits this this is the street that
[43:10] divides Beaufort from Port Royal however
[43:12] you have to go all the way up a little
[43:14] ways to get back over into Port Royal we
[43:16] are in Beaufort city so we'd be subject
[43:19] to that I don't see how that could be
[43:20] managed
[43:21] you know we so we've thought about are
[43:24] we going to have to go back to broadcast
[43:25] only the answer is we'll see we'll see
[43:30] we don't know what we do know is that
[43:33] right now we can continue gathering
[43:35] right now we're gathering by using 50
[43:38] percent of the alphabet ironically and
[43:41] thankfully I didn't really have to do
[43:42] much math because it just so happened
[43:45] when I looked at the church director
[43:46] sister Wanda built for us the it
[43:49] literally divided almost to a person
[43:50] like within two people of being a
[43:53] perfect division down the middle so
[43:56] today so this weekend
[43:57] k2z and Wednesday night that'll carry
[44:00] again then next Sunday to be back to a
[44:02] through J and then that'll carry into
[44:04] the Wednesday so we've made you know now
[44:07] let me just speak to the reality some
[44:10] things that we can also see definitely
[44:12] this virus is spiking definitely there
[44:16] are more hospitalizations which is
[44:19] really the only hard number I look at
[44:21] anyway
[44:21] that you're gonna have more positive
[44:23] results if you test more and there's
[44:26] quite a quite a growing medical opinion
[44:30] for many doctors that we're all going to
[44:32] contact it eventually you can't stop it
[44:35] and we're all and the many people that
[44:37] probably already have it and don't ever
[44:39] know they had it they were completely
[44:41] asymptomatic and and even have some
[44:44] immunity to it now so but at the same
[44:46] time there are increasing
[44:48] hospitalizations our own hospital here
[44:51] with the normal people that they have
[44:56] admitted knock Ovid just admitted for
[44:59] various things plus now some some new
[45:04] spiking in kovat hospitalizations our
[45:09] Hospital here is running pretty near
[45:11] capacity according to birth Andrew
[45:13] working out of the ER there they're
[45:14] running pretty near capacity and so you
[45:18] know it's unusual to have a flu bug I
[45:22] mean what kind of flu bug survives into
[45:24] the summer that's unheard of and this
[45:26] thing here we are almost in July and
[45:28] this strain is not only surviving it's
[45:31] it's surging so naturally we have some
[45:35] concerns good Christian people have died
[45:40] it does true it is true that it's a very
[45:42] low mortality rate it's much seems to be
[45:45] much more contagious from the best
[45:47] evidence they can find so we've had
[45:50] different things in in place here like
[45:52] you know suspending half the
[45:54] congregation's that way we can set
[45:56] generally with families and social
[45:57] distance we want to be in compliance
[46:00] because that is what they're asking us
[46:01] to do plus it's the prudent thing to do
[46:04] not just our testimony that's half of it
[46:06] but the other half is what is prudent
[46:08] we've said we don't want to do anything
[46:09] in fear but we do want to be
[46:12] for this reason because that it does
[46:15] seem to be surging and in fact the hard
[46:17] number of hospitalizations does seem to
[46:20] be increasing to a certain degree I
[46:22] don't think it's the hype that the
[46:23] media's making of it but friends it
[46:26] would devastate me too you know for
[46:29] anyone in here to have a critical you
[46:32] know we we prayed brother Charles
[46:33] through a near-death experience and you
[46:37] know I just don't want to see us go
[46:38] through that again
[46:39] we've we've closed the fellowship hall
[46:42] from afternoon fellowship so that's a
[46:46] little bit it's all about an odds game
[46:47] it's all trying to end it to decrease
[46:50] the odds that it could be spread to
[46:52] increase the odds that it won't so we've
[46:55] we've closed the fellowship hall and we
[46:56] love that I hate that but I think with
[46:58] it surging like it is and it's not
[47:00] abating even though summer heat is upon
[47:02] it in Arizona they're dealing with a
[47:04] hundred and eleven degrees to talk to
[47:06] brother Michael Alderson 111 and it's
[47:08] still surging so this is that what flu
[47:12] bug does that so we're just going to
[47:15] have to take some tighten up a little
[47:17] bit again at at present we're going to
[47:21] continue to to hold our Sunday school to
[47:26] hold the regular Sunday service and to
[47:29] hold Wednesday night services there are
[47:32] some other things that we want to to
[47:35] announce today after today the Sunday
[47:39] school class will be streaming only ok
[47:42] so so again it's all it's all playing
[47:46] the odds it's limiting the exposure if
[47:48] we can cut your exposure down from two
[47:50] and a half hours down to you know hour
[47:52] and forty-five minutes or two hours then
[47:54] that's a plot that's a plus that's a
[47:55] game so the Sunday school class the
[47:59] adult Sunday School class will still be
[48:02] held it'll just it'll just need a
[48:05] minister and some booth personnel we
[48:08] won't even need the musicians for the
[48:10] Sunday school class so just whatever
[48:12] your your team leader whatever whichever
[48:15] worship leader wants you here at
[48:16] whatever time just meet at that time but
[48:19] I'm even cautioning the team leaders to
[48:20] not bring you in too early and we're
[48:22] trying to limit the time that we're
[48:25] proximity look friends you know I there
[48:29] some people say you should stop holding
[48:30] church well I mean we go to Walmart we
[48:34] go to restaurants so I mean come on you
[48:37] know and and I get that good people have
[48:40] perished God's family God in His wisdom
[48:42] has allowed it there they're members of
[48:45] gods family who die of cancer even
[48:47] though jesus healed us all at Calvary
[48:50] there are those who died the seasonal
[48:53] flu this is not many are the afflictions
[48:54] of the righteous but the Lord delivers
[48:57] us from them all whether I'm healed here
[49:00] I get heal beyond the grave who cares
[49:02] none of this is gonna matter ten
[49:04] thousand years now I'm not gonna care so
[49:07] you know I'm living for the other side
[49:10] and um my my hope is in the Lord and so
[49:14] our Sunday School will switch to
[49:18] streaming only so my advice to you would
[49:21] be you know I know that some of you and
[49:23] and it's good it's wonderful love to get
[49:25] here early some twenty thirty minutes
[49:28] early well you know let's let's just try
[49:30] to limit that to maybe don't come in
[49:32] you know until maybe 10 minutes before
[49:34] the service starts make sure the Sunday
[49:37] school is dismissed you know and then
[49:41] then if you want to come in after that
[49:43] you'd be fine because there's only about
[49:45] a 10 minute intermission anyway and that
[49:47] wouldn't be coming in too soon but don't
[49:50] come into the sanctuary with the with
[49:54] the Sunday school going on in fact is
[49:56] don't enter the building so even to the
[49:58] even to the restrooms are the musicians
[50:00] I'll give them a little bit of a pass
[50:01] and the booth personnel and officers
[50:03] sometimes they have to get in here and
[50:05] do what they do to make the service go
[50:07] so I get that but please we are going to
[50:11] keep the Sunday school to streaming only
[50:13] the fellowship hall as I've said is
[50:15] going to be closed until further notice
[50:17] Sunday school will be streamed until
[50:18] further notice we are going to continue
[50:20] to meet for the regular Sunday service
[50:23] for now and we are going to continue to
[50:25] meet for the Wednesday I consider moving
[50:27] that streaming but I've decided against
[50:29] it we're still going to continue to use
[50:32] half the alphabet now the Deacons and
[50:36] the trustees are forming up a team
[50:38] together
[50:38] because it would quickly overwhelm the
[50:40] Deacons trying to do it all what I'm
[50:41] about to announce the trustees are going
[50:43] to help them we're we're beginning
[50:47] Wednesday we're we are insisting
[50:50] insisting on very strict social
[50:54] distancing as bad as we hate it we live
[50:58] in the south but no more handshaking no
[51:01] more no more physical contact of any
[51:04] kind
[51:04] when church is over please if you go out
[51:08] front only stay out there a few minutes
[51:11] and stay distanced do not if you want to
[51:14] use the World Health Organization of
[51:15] three feet fine that's fine but don't be
[51:19] inside of that and don't linger out
[51:21] there you should just leave the property
[51:23] after I know we're southern I know we
[51:26] love that we love greeting we love
[51:28] talking we love seeing each other that's
[51:30] who we are it's what we are and you know
[51:33] I don't think we ever foresaw a day that
[51:36] this would come but I don't think we'll
[51:38] ever go back to totally normal friends
[51:40] we're at the end you know and and that's
[51:44] not a dreadful thing to us Paul said
[51:46] people say oh you're McCarver you're
[51:48] negative no I'm just quoting the Apostle
[51:50] Paul for me to live as Christ but to
[51:52] dies gain to go on to glory would be
[51:55] gain so if I'm gonna have to stay here
[51:57] I'm for sure gonna live for Christ I'm
[52:00] gonna make my I'm gonna make every
[52:01] second count for his kingdom and also
[52:05] the the Deacons with the assistance of
[52:08] the trustees are going to implement a
[52:11] practice of of we're going to have a
[52:17] whole monitor and when musicians people
[52:22] come in for the restroom musicians come
[52:23] in when I come in to go to my office
[52:25] there's going to be a deacon or trustee
[52:27] back there with chemicals gloves and a
[52:30] rag he's going to every time you touch a
[52:32] handle he's gonna wipe it behind you you
[52:34] go in and out of a restroom don't go in
[52:36] till the till the monitor can wipe that
[52:39] down and and and it's all about reducing
[52:43] the odds that's all it is we can't be a
[52:45] hundred percent there's no way there's
[52:48] no way we can't you know
[52:50] put off some fogger in the bathroom
[52:52] every time somebody comes out to you
[52:55] know disinfect everything just you can't
[52:57] do it and there's going to be things
[52:59] that slip between the cracks this is
[53:01] only about reducing the odds you get
[53:04] that now and then when you go out of
[53:08] that door when you when you when you
[53:12] before service deacons are going to be
[53:14] outside to open the door for you if you
[53:17] open it ahead of them then they're gonna
[53:19] clean it off before the next person
[53:21] touches it and we're gonna have a person
[53:23] in the back hallway monitoring now
[53:25] friends running to the restroom during
[53:30] service III don't want to we don't want
[53:34] to police state here goodness no this is
[53:37] a church all right
[53:38] we're not trying to form a police state
[53:40] but just know this you know that that
[53:44] that it is it is I've seen it my whole
[53:47] life it just seemed like no matter what
[53:49] you say you know about you know running
[53:53] in and out teenagers running in and out
[53:55] mothers taking children in and out I
[53:57] understand it has to happen sometimes
[54:01] sometimes a mother has a little baby
[54:04] they've gotta go she's gonna take them
[54:06] that's what that's the reality I'm not
[54:08] against that if you have a medical
[54:10] condition if you have a situation and
[54:13] you just have to go to the restroom then
[54:16] go that's what we have them for this is
[54:18] your church you understand it's not my
[54:20] church but you have set me up as a
[54:23] pastor in the we have elders here who
[54:26] make some of these group decisions for
[54:27] us so that we don't have to poll you for
[54:29] everything we do and and just know this
[54:32] that if you run to the restroom during
[54:35] service a deacon he's not gonna follow
[54:37] you they're not gonna stalk you but when
[54:39] you come back in he's gonna have to go
[54:42] out that door go to the bathroom clean
[54:44] everything off he's not even gonna know
[54:45] what you touched he's got to clean
[54:47] everything he's gonna have to come back
[54:49] to the door wipe the door down again
[54:51] wipe the striker pad down again so my
[54:54] request to you on their behalf is don't
[54:56] do it
[54:57] please it's it's it literally is to the
[55:02] point where I
[55:04] I won't do it but I could put a list of
[55:06] names on a board of teenagers and this
[55:11] has been historical it's not just in the
[55:13] present but we have had and have
[55:15] teenagers who go out by schedule and I
[55:21] don't have to go to the bathroom they
[55:22] just go out by schedule you can set your
[55:24] watch by I've sit in the back and said
[55:26] okay we've been going about thirty it's
[55:29] just about two oh yeah there they go
[55:30] mmm okay and wait another 20 minutes
[55:33] okay it's just about time for there they
[55:36] go
[55:36] and I've sit back there and watched it
[55:38] take place I don't want to you know
[55:41] browbeat you today but that's that's
[55:45] ridiculous I've seen little children not
[55:49] little little I get little little ones
[55:51] have to go out but I've seen you know
[55:54] grown-up children big boys and big girls
[55:56] but still children and like clockwork
[55:59] mommy I gotta go to the bathroom and
[56:01] here goes mommy taking him out two and
[56:03] three at a time it is not necessary I
[56:05] say that by experienced I wasn't raised
[56:08] that way sister Jean did not play that
[56:10] you went to the restroom before service
[56:13] and you didn't go again till afterward
[56:14] unless you had an emergency and being a
[56:16] mother she could tell what was it
[56:18] emergency mothers have a way of knowing
[56:20] and don't understand that but they have
[56:23] a way and I know that raising kids you
[56:29] know my boys were strictly they went
[56:31] before church they didn't go during
[56:32] church and if they had a crisis they
[56:35] knew better than to even ask so if they
[56:36] ask I kind of figured they must really
[56:38] need to go and I would let them go but
[56:40] it was so rare now you say brother Jason
[56:42] you didn't raise girl well I married a
[56:44] girl who doesn't run in and out my
[56:47] mother's a girl who doesn't run in and
[56:49] out so my sister wasn't allowed to run
[56:51] in and out so I am speaking
[56:55] qualitatively to you today it's not
[56:58] necessary and you should stop doing it
[57:01] now and in the future hopefully now
[57:04] because we're in a pandemic and the
[57:07] Deacons are going to have to go behind
[57:09] you it's it's it's really going to be
[57:12] extra bad if you continue to do that so
[57:15] we're asking you nicely
[57:19] every man wants to always wants to lose
[57:21] weight but they don't want to lose
[57:23] weight that way running in and out of
[57:25] the door chasing everybody going behind
[57:27] everybody so please try your best
[57:30] they're going to begin that Wednesday
[57:32] night they have a lot of trepidation we
[57:35] talked it out you know there was even a
[57:38] suggestion look if we got to go to that
[57:40] link we should just stay home but I said
[57:43] brothers I think we can pull it off I
[57:44] will good them I will get in the pulpit
[57:47] I will speak up for you to let the
[57:49] people know don't do your deacons and
[57:51] trustees that way because they're under
[57:52] a mandate they'll have to go if you go
[57:54] out they will have to go behind you and
[57:56] so and every time you do it they all
[57:59] have to do it so so please let's have
[58:01] cooperation because right now we're in
[58:04] unsettling uncertain times the only
[58:07] thing that we have certain as we were
[58:09] speaking in the sunday-school class
[58:10] today is God in His Word are the only
[58:12] certain things and so we have peace and
[58:14] confidence in that praise the Lord and
[58:19] so if I accidentally cuz I do it all the
[58:23] time if I accidentally all the time I do
[58:26] it on purpose but now I'm gonna try to
[58:27] not say turn around shake hands if I
[58:30] accidentally do that just smile at me
[58:32] and just wave at each other and just
[58:36] looking wave and do a virtual handshake
[58:38] but don't actually do it let's even not
[58:41] do it among families I'm gonna try to
[58:43] resist not saying that amen I know we're
[58:46] southern I know we love that but we're
[58:48] just going to have to hey maybe in
[58:50] another month this'll all you know
[58:54] settle down we don't know but then you
[58:57] know before before long the fall is
[58:59] coming back in flu season seasonal flu
[59:00] season starts so we're just taking this
[59:04] as we go we're figuring it out as best
[59:07] as we can
[59:09] amen god bless you let's stand now I'm
[59:12] gonna I've used up half my preaching
[59:14] time so you're gonna get a Sunday School
[59:18] lesson sermon and I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[59:22] fast so so just let's look in our Bibles
[59:26] to Genesis chapter 3 and I am
[59:31] gonna watch the clock very closely I'm
[59:33] not determined by any means to finish
[59:35] today I probably won't be in fact as I'm
[59:38] quite sure I can't years of experience
[59:41] looking at my notes I'd know I can't so
[59:43] I'm not gonna try so just give me your
[59:45] undivided attention for 30-40 minutes
[59:47] okay
[59:49] all right amen I ever tell you all about
[59:52] my old doctor when I first moved here
[59:54] doc doc brown great doctor great it was
[59:59] a color dr. gray and thank you sister
[1:00:02] mom and and dr. gray he was he was we're
[1:00:07] talking about you know the gospel and
[1:00:09] preaching and you know he was bragging
[1:00:11] that he had never fallen asleep in in
[1:00:13] during a sermon in his life and he was
[1:00:15] an old man I was impressed and I said
[1:00:18] Wow dr. gray that's he went to the
[1:00:19] Episcopal Church I think and you know
[1:00:21] I've heard of Pisgah poles are basically
[1:00:24] Catholics who vote Republican but they
[1:00:28] don't they don't always appreciate that
[1:00:29] joke but but he was a good guy I like
[1:00:33] dr. gray he was a real Christian man
[1:00:34] real no kidding
[1:00:35] he was a Christian gentleman and I
[1:00:37] really liked him and and and so he he he
[1:00:41] said he said I've never fall asleep
[1:00:43] during a sermon I said dr. gray that's
[1:00:45] amazing I am so impressed to hear you
[1:00:47] say that I said well I don't I don't I
[1:00:50] don't preach very long I said I I try to
[1:00:52] be make it interesting as best I can and
[1:00:54] I said I'd usually try to stop in about
[1:00:57] maybe an hour at most and you'd have
[1:01:00] thought lightning hit him he literally
[1:01:02] jolted in his body said oh my goodness
[1:01:04] I've never heard a sermon more than 15
[1:01:07] minutes and suddenly I was less proud of
[1:01:11] me than I had been but I sure loved him
[1:01:15] he was a good old guy I don't know if
[1:01:17] he's even still living but he was he was
[1:01:19] a Christian gentleman and I sure
[1:01:21] appreciate Oh doc gray amen
[1:01:24] alright friends let's get into the Word
[1:01:26] of God amen we probably shouldn't have
[1:01:28] that much humor in the pulpit
[1:01:30] approaching the word so let's read a man
[1:01:32] in Genesis chapter 3 now the serpent was
[1:01:37] more subtle than any beast of the field
[1:01:40] which the Lord God had made and he said
[1:01:42] unto the woman
[1:01:44] yayyyy hath God said you shall not eat
[1:01:46] of every tree of the garden and the
[1:01:49] woman said unto the serpent we made of
[1:01:51] the fruit of the trees of the garden but
[1:01:52] of the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:01:54] midst of the garden God hath said you
[1:01:57] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:02:00] touch it lest you die it's very obvious
[1:02:02] it was a different kind of a tree that
[1:02:04] it wasn't the kind that was planted in
[1:02:06] the ground and grew fruit because God
[1:02:08] had already told him every tree is good
[1:02:10] for fruit now he's not changing what he
[1:02:12] said he's just simply talking about a
[1:02:14] different kind of a tree all right so
[1:02:16] the symbolism changes from literal to
[1:02:19] symbolic and he says and so the serpent
[1:02:23] continuing now verse 4 and the serpent
[1:02:26] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:02:27] die for God doth know that in the day ye
[1:02:31] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:02:33] opened and ye shall be as God's knowing
[1:02:35] good and evil and when the woman saw
[1:02:37] that the tree was good for food and that
[1:02:39] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[1:02:41] to be desired to make one wise she took
[1:02:44] of the fruit thereof and did eat gave
[1:02:48] also unto her husband with her he did
[1:02:50] eat and the eyes of them both were open
[1:02:52] and they knew that they were naked and
[1:02:54] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[1:02:55] themselves aprons and they heard the
[1:03:00] voice of God walking in the garden and
[1:03:02] the cool of the day and Adam and his
[1:03:04] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[1:03:07] the Lord God amongst the trees let's
[1:03:10] pray father
[1:03:11] now we come Lord and we want to focus
[1:03:14] our hearts and minds we had
[1:03:16] announcements to make Lord and these are
[1:03:18] vital announcements and I'm sorry to
[1:03:21] have had to cut in on your time in the
[1:03:23] ministry today but they were necessary
[1:03:25] Lord to make it I'm sure you understand
[1:03:28] and father help us now to sober our
[1:03:31] minds and be serious as we look at your
[1:03:33] word we commit ourselves into your hands
[1:03:35] for the reading the hearing and the
[1:03:38] obedience to your word in Jesus name
[1:03:41] Amen god bless you as you're seated and
[1:03:43] we're going to have the brothers put up
[1:03:45] second Corinthians 11:1 to 4 Paul
[1:03:52] speaking now I would to God Paul now is
[1:03:55] going to go back and reference the
[1:03:57] historical account of what happened in
[1:03:59] the Garden of Eden I would to God he
[1:04:02] could bear with me a little in my folly
[1:04:04] and indeed bear with me for I am jealous
[1:04:07] over you with the godly jealousy for I
[1:04:10] have espoused you to one husband that I
[1:04:13] may present you as a chaste virgin to
[1:04:15] Christ but I fear lest by any means as
[1:04:19] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:04:22] subtlety so your minds should be
[1:04:26] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[1:04:28] Christ for if he that cometh preaches
[1:04:32] preach a--the another Jesus whom we have
[1:04:36] not preached or if you receive another
[1:04:39] spirit which he have not received or
[1:04:41] another gospel which he have not
[1:04:43] accepted you might well bear with him
[1:04:46] that was Paul's fear that they might
[1:04:50] bear with it and that would be a
[1:04:52] horrific mistake his whole point is that
[1:04:56] look when Eve was in the garden she
[1:05:00] followed another Jesus you understand
[1:05:03] and and she followed now this other
[1:05:06] Jesus that's that Paul is referring to
[1:05:08] there's only one true Jesus the other
[1:05:11] Jesus is a fake Jesus called the
[1:05:14] Antichrist that tries to mimic Jesus we
[1:05:19] saw him coming out on a white horse in
[1:05:21] the book of Revelation and it looked
[1:05:23] like Christ but it wasn't it was a
[1:05:24] deceiver
[1:05:25] he had a bow but he had no arrows and so
[1:05:29] we realized that God had to send forth
[1:05:31] in the book of Revelation the anointing
[1:05:33] of the lion to combat him because the
[1:05:35] lion was the pure Word of God this was
[1:05:38] what Paul was preaching under under the
[1:05:40] lion anointing and he was warning the
[1:05:43] church or not tik-tok preaching on the
[1:05:45] original sin today the only thing I want
[1:05:48] to connect to is that that Eve heard the
[1:05:52] words of the Lord you shall not eat it
[1:05:55] you shall not touch it Eve even it even
[1:05:58] adds we're not even to look at it which
[1:06:01] was probably good advice and and but now
[1:06:04] another another one not her husband not
[1:06:08] the first Adam not the one
[1:06:10] would become the second Adam not either
[1:06:12] one of those they had given her the word
[1:06:15] her husband Adam the first Adam who was
[1:06:18] the son of God kept the Word of God
[1:06:20] would not transgress and the devil had
[1:06:23] no way to talk him into it but we find
[1:06:27] out that because that the woman came
[1:06:30] from the man that she's literally a
[1:06:32] result taken from him a byproduct of him
[1:06:36] then she had a vulnerability to her
[1:06:39] reasoning and now another Jesus a false
[1:06:43] one operating through the serpent a
[1:06:47] subtle beast not a snake crawling on the
[1:06:50] ground yeah you ever seen a talking
[1:06:52] snake so so this wasn't a snake that's
[1:06:57] what he became this was a beast of the
[1:06:59] field that stood upright like a man he's
[1:07:02] the missing link that science can't find
[1:07:04] today that stands between men and the
[1:07:07] ape or the chimpanzee God cursed his
[1:07:10] form and put him on his belly but at
[1:07:12] this time he had did not have a soul but
[1:07:15] he had a place for one so Satan could
[1:07:17] enter him and actually talk to Eve and
[1:07:19] convince her she's listening to another
[1:07:22] Jesus now and it's causing the fall of
[1:07:25] all men now Paul is coming to say look
[1:07:28] now the real Jesus has come and now we
[1:07:32] have the the the the complete restored
[1:07:36] Word we now have the we now have access
[1:07:39] to what Adam lost Paul had that in his
[1:07:42] day that's not unique to our day our
[1:07:44] days only been restored to Paul's day
[1:07:46] Paul had that restoration of fellowship
[1:07:50] with God like Adam had and so we realize
[1:07:55] then that that that that when we we see
[1:07:58] the trick of the enemy now I'm I had a
[1:08:00] PowerPoint Caleb I'm gonna I'm not gonna
[1:08:03] use it because it slows me down I got to
[1:08:04] go too fast today I'm just gonna read
[1:08:06] some of these quotes so brother Brent
[1:08:08] says and a greater than Solomon is here
[1:08:10] do you believe that we are living in one
[1:08:12] of those wicked and adulterous
[1:08:13] generations say amen to that certainly
[1:08:16] we are as I've said many times this
[1:08:17] nation can never escape the damnation
[1:08:19] and wrath of God I'm an American
[1:08:22] an important point we've been making a
[1:08:24] lot of things talking about politics I
[1:08:25] want you to get a Prophet's position I
[1:08:28] he says certainly we are an adulterous
[1:08:33] generation as I've said many times that
[1:08:36] this nation can never escape the
[1:08:38] damnation and wrath of God and he says I
[1:08:41] am an American
[1:08:42] many of the Brennan's are buried yonder
[1:08:45] out on the fields blowed up in the wars
[1:08:48] and if it was to come tonight to make a
[1:08:50] choice America's my country I love it
[1:08:53] but I don't love the sins that it's
[1:08:56] doing god loves America
[1:08:59] this is 1958 now this is a key actually
[1:09:01] after they've they've rejected the
[1:09:04] gospel in 1950 after 1956 and he still
[1:09:07] says God loves America but he hates her
[1:09:10] sin all right so you know I'm I've been
[1:09:14] heavily emphasizing that as believers
[1:09:19] while we do love our country amen we
[1:09:24] love our flag we love our freedom we
[1:09:27] pray for our leaders but in a spiritual
[1:09:30] sense in a spiritual sense we're not
[1:09:33] Americans we are more than that we are
[1:09:36] Christians you understand
[1:09:39] so we're Christians so so we're we're
[1:09:43] not of this world's order if if they're
[1:09:46] if the testimony of your lived life as
[1:09:50] the Bible calls your chaste conversation
[1:09:52] if your testimony agrees with any
[1:09:56] portion of this world's system then
[1:09:59] you've got the wrong message
[1:10:01] there's something coming out of you
[1:10:03] that's not because the world system from
[1:10:06] top to bottom inside and out is contrary
[1:10:09] to the Word of God and so the real
[1:10:12] Christian is certainly different than
[1:10:15] the world now so there are no longer now
[1:10:19] here's something we know because as
[1:10:21] Jesus said in the Gospels as the
[1:10:23] Lightning travels out of the east even
[1:10:25] unto the West so shall it be at the
[1:10:26] coming of the Son of Man you can see
[1:10:28] that historically we've done it before
[1:10:29] we've studied the church ages and you
[1:10:32] know I say you say well do you believe
[1:10:35] that those angels that those were local
[1:10:37] churches in those seven churches agent
[1:10:40] of Asia Minor and that they were seven
[1:10:42] pastors to seven churches well of course
[1:10:44] there were seven churches there's a lot
[1:10:46] more than seven you understand I don't
[1:10:48] deny that but the greater implication
[1:10:52] that God was saying was to the church
[1:10:54] ages and that it that becomes it becomes
[1:10:59] silly to argue against that I've heard
[1:11:01] theologians try and and they try to
[1:11:04] argue it simply from the scripture and
[1:11:06] all you have to do is go back in history
[1:11:09] and look at the actual history of of the
[1:11:14] world coming from the early church in
[1:11:17] Jerusalem all the way up through the
[1:11:19] Roman Empire the collapse of the Roman
[1:11:21] Empire the Dark Ages coming out through
[1:11:24] through the gospel coming into Germany
[1:11:26] the inventing of the press and Martin
[1:11:28] Luther comes on the scene with the
[1:11:29] Reformation it jumps the channel hits
[1:11:31] England John Wesley rises up then that
[1:11:33] then it comes to America what's it doing
[1:11:35] it's coming west just like Jesus said it
[1:11:37] would do when you look at how history
[1:11:40] went and you take those prophecies and
[1:11:42] just overlay them on the history it just
[1:11:45] literally fits perfectly every point
[1:11:48] hits that is that is unmistakable it is
[1:11:53] unmistakable
[1:11:54] to anybody who will just look at the
[1:11:55] Bible plainly and not try to make it say
[1:11:58] something it's not saying and so so we
[1:12:01] find then that the gospel as its calm
[1:12:04] westward as Jesus said it would that
[1:12:07] every time a nation rejects it it moves
[1:12:10] on he drops a temporary judgment on that
[1:12:12] area and when you know and and I'm not
[1:12:15] here to preach on the ages today we know
[1:12:17] this is all rudimentary to us that we we
[1:12:20] find that it came to the west it came to
[1:12:22] America it's Revelation chapter 13
[1:12:25] prophecies about America the beast that
[1:12:28] rose up out of the land not out of the
[1:12:29] water not in the old world it rose up
[1:12:32] out of the land where there was no
[1:12:34] people and there was just scattered
[1:12:36] native culture and so it rose up like a
[1:12:38] lamb under the under the pretense of
[1:12:42] godly and we had godly men we had true
[1:12:45] Christian character that's for real and
[1:12:47] God but you know
[1:12:49] as always a mixed multitude because you
[1:12:52] always had that even moses had that
[1:12:54] going out of the children taking
[1:12:55] children out of Egypt there's a mixed
[1:12:57] multitude you had believers make
[1:12:58] believers and unbelievers that's always
[1:12:59] the case and so here you've got our
[1:13:02] founding fathers trying to establish a
[1:13:04] constitution and Jefferson's writing a
[1:13:06] declaration of independence that is is
[1:13:09] thought by most scholars to be the
[1:13:10] greatest the greatest document
[1:13:13] concerning freedom of mankind that's
[1:13:15] ever been pinned now it's well thought
[1:13:18] of that but yet at the same time it's
[1:13:20] filled with flaws because you know
[1:13:22] there's slavery still being allowed and
[1:13:25] even Jefferson himself is having slaves
[1:13:26] I'm here to preach politics today I'm
[1:13:29] just saying this is our history because
[1:13:36] men his best effort with good motives
[1:13:40] and good intentions it's been a mixed
[1:13:42] bag and it's given mixed results and it
[1:13:45] can't last no nation can last they all
[1:13:48] end up collapsing and another world
[1:13:50] power comes in that's historically
[1:13:53] incontrovertible as well oh you look at
[1:13:56] Daniels prophecy and you can follow the
[1:13:57] Gentile kingdoms to a tee they literally
[1:14:01] describe the characteristics thousands
[1:14:03] of years in prophecy that you can read
[1:14:05] in history that happened thousands of
[1:14:06] years later and so so now we find then
[1:14:10] that that as each nation as the gospel
[1:14:14] kept coming west to this nation then
[1:14:16] this nation has a rejection of it what's
[1:14:19] it gonna do it goes back east again
[1:14:21] that's Bible prophecy why it's going
[1:14:23] back to the Jews it's going to go back
[1:14:25] and pick up the 144,000 out of Israel
[1:14:28] it's not going to convert the whole
[1:14:30] nation of Israel it's going to convert a
[1:14:33] very small they're just shy of nine
[1:14:36] million people and only a hundred and
[1:14:39] forty four thousand out of almost nine
[1:14:41] million are going ah with Moses and
[1:14:44] Elijah in into the new world into the
[1:14:47] Millennium alright I was going to crunch
[1:14:49] the number and do a percentage on that
[1:14:50] but I but I didn't do it but it's a very
[1:14:54] small percentage it's twelve thousand
[1:14:56] out of each tribe and and so Paul said
[1:14:59] remembered not all Israel's Israel
[1:15:03] but though just like all Christians
[1:15:04] aren't real Christians it's those who
[1:15:06] are born of the Spirit of God that's a
[1:15:09] Christian it's it's those who have the
[1:15:11] faith of Abraham that's a real Jew
[1:15:13] that's a true Israelite those with the
[1:15:16] faith of Abraham so as nations then
[1:15:19] every time a nation rejected it then
[1:15:23] judgment is on that nation it came to to
[1:15:25] Germany to England to here now and now
[1:15:28] all nations of the world have rejected
[1:15:31] God's message of their hour including
[1:15:33] this one and so we find out then that
[1:15:37] that all nations of the earth now
[1:15:40] there's a big statement all nations as a
[1:15:42] nation all nations are under judgment
[1:15:45] including Israel I know that might be
[1:15:52] foreign to you you might think wait a
[1:15:53] minute I thought Israel was being
[1:15:55] blessed of God not as a nation not as a
[1:15:59] nation there's true Israelites under
[1:16:01] there living in that system who are
[1:16:03] under the blessing of God just like you
[1:16:04] and me we're still here we're living in
[1:16:06] a curse that Israel was it trapped in
[1:16:08] Babylon 70 years Babylon was judged by
[1:16:11] God but yet God blessed his family and
[1:16:13] brought him out according to prophecy so
[1:16:16] God has restored Israel as a nation who
[1:16:19] did that God say well isn't that a
[1:16:21] blessing it is in a sense but you have
[1:16:23] to understand that the Jews as a nation
[1:16:26] when they rejected their Messiah they've
[1:16:29] been under the judgments of God ever
[1:16:31] since anything that you see them
[1:16:33] becoming a nation 48 the 67 war Yom
[1:16:37] Kippur War they've survived it all
[1:16:39] they're now a global power in the Middle
[1:16:42] East God is blessing them okay look
[1:16:44] friends you got under you got to
[1:16:45] separate what God does for prophecies
[1:16:48] sake God in 1957 this nation was sealed
[1:16:54] under judgment and as a nation she
[1:16:57] rejected him for the last time but his
[1:16:59] bride was still here
[1:17:00] the seal still had to come a prophet
[1:17:03] still had to go so he say man God is
[1:17:05] blessing us in that in that he is
[1:17:07] because his family is still here but as
[1:17:10] a nation
[1:17:12] we're not under his blessing as a nation
[1:17:14] Israel is not under his blessing they
[1:17:16] are not under his blessing until the
[1:17:18] gospel goes back to them when the day of
[1:17:20] the Gentiles is over and then then the
[1:17:23] bride is gone and then nobody other than
[1:17:26] those who are following Moses and Elijah
[1:17:29] are living under the blessing of God
[1:17:31] brother man talks about that uh and I'll
[1:17:34] just give you the reference the 70th
[1:17:36] week of Daniel he makes it very very
[1:17:37] clear you know and I'm just trying to
[1:17:40] save some time I got to go so quickly so
[1:17:43] we find that that if you want to read
[1:17:46] the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:17:47] you can catch paragraph 97 through 101
[1:17:51] and brother Branham teaches that very
[1:17:53] very clearly you can read it for
[1:17:54] yourself that they are as a nation under
[1:17:58] the judgment of God so so then I I've
[1:18:01] said so then I said talk about race
[1:18:04] relations and I've said you know in the
[1:18:05] family of God
[1:18:07] you know Paul said there's neither Jew
[1:18:08] nor Gentile there's neither bond nor
[1:18:11] free there is neither male or female so
[1:18:13] I'm not a race we've said that
[1:18:16] why is there no racism in the family of
[1:18:18] God and there isn't there isn't and
[1:18:22] through Holy Ghost field people there is
[1:18:23] none not a not a bit naughty not a
[1:18:26] sliver because the Holy Ghost would
[1:18:28] never tolerate that it wouldn't matter
[1:18:31] how you were raised what kind of
[1:18:32] background you had or what you how you'd
[1:18:34] been brainwashed
[1:18:35] when you get the Holy Ghost you are a
[1:18:37] brand new creature in Christ all old
[1:18:41] things are passed away and so when you
[1:18:43] when the Holy Ghost is on display there
[1:18:46] is no racism because you're no longer a
[1:18:49] race you're a child of God it's like I'm
[1:18:53] not exactly an American I'm a Christian
[1:18:56] I'm not a race I'm a child of God you
[1:18:59] understand I'm not a politic we've said
[1:19:03] that we're not Republicans Democrats
[1:19:05] libertarians are even independence we
[1:19:08] bear no political identity or social
[1:19:13] identity of this world's order at all
[1:19:18] Paul says you're not of them you're
[1:19:21] you're of the day you're not of the
[1:19:23] night the world moves in those things we
[1:19:25] do
[1:19:25] our mission here is to try to try to
[1:19:29] show the gospel to everybody we can and
[1:19:33] say come up out of that world system
[1:19:35] order it's only chaos it's only getting
[1:19:37] worse you can't fix it by passing new
[1:19:40] laws you can't fix it by spending more
[1:19:42] money it doesn't matter who you elect
[1:19:44] the world is ending jesus said it must
[1:19:47] there's a rapture the good news is you
[1:19:50] don't have to be in a tribulation Christ
[1:19:52] is coming to take a bride out of the
[1:19:54] earth so so so in that vein then so
[1:20:01] we're not a political identity we're not
[1:20:03] a social identity I'm not a racial
[1:20:06] identity we are we are the global bride
[1:20:12] family of Jesus Christ and our
[1:20:16] citizenship and our full allegiance is
[1:20:19] to God you understand we preach to all
[1:20:25] we try to compel all we pray for all so
[1:20:29] so we find then that that why do I keep
[1:20:33] emphasizing you might ask brother
[1:20:34] Jason's four weeks in a row why do you
[1:20:37] keep emphasizing and touching on these
[1:20:38] polarizing political and social issues
[1:20:41] and this that our nation is facing
[1:20:44] here's why I've been preaching to you
[1:20:47] about being the final voice to the final
[1:20:50] age once more the world will hear direct
[1:20:51] from God as at Pentecost so therefore
[1:20:54] it's and I and I said for me it's a lot
[1:20:57] to do with preaching words because I'm a
[1:21:00] preacher but all of you are preachers to
[1:21:03] a degree all of you have a voice of your
[1:21:05] life and the world needs to hear that
[1:21:08] voice because right now right now listen
[1:21:12] friends according to the Bible you
[1:21:15] believe the Bible according to Bible
[1:21:20] teaching at the end of the world we are
[1:21:25] that that that according to Bible
[1:21:28] teaching at the end of the world only
[1:21:31] the Bride of Christ who have received
[1:21:35] the revelation of the restorer
[1:21:37] word are even qualified to speak to
[1:21:41] inequities only according to Bible
[1:21:45] teaching the the Bride of Christ around
[1:21:48] the world not just Americans around the
[1:21:51] world we are aware that that you say
[1:21:54] well you think you're in well I think
[1:21:56] I'm part of that group I know for sure
[1:21:58] that prophecy is that only that group
[1:22:01] whoever it is if it's not me there is
[1:22:03] somebody whoever that group is they are
[1:22:07] the only ones qualified to speak truth
[1:22:10] to inequities because everybody else
[1:22:13] can't reason they lose their ability to
[1:22:16] discern right from wrong according to
[1:22:17] Bible prophecy the only way that you can
[1:22:20] find true legitimacy in any truth is
[1:22:23] when you have the mind of Christ
[1:22:25] can't be man's opinion you can't go on
[1:22:28] something that sounds nice only the mind
[1:22:31] of Christ every other opinion outside of
[1:22:35] the mind of Christ is illegitimate now
[1:22:39] how important they only think of this
[1:22:41] friends that if you believe you're in
[1:22:43] that number of the less JOHN CARTER the
[1:22:46] elect lady and she's prophesied to go in
[1:22:48] a rapture she's prophesied to have the
[1:22:50] mind of Christ right at the end then
[1:22:52] only that family only that selected
[1:22:55] elected family of God who have accepted
[1:22:57] the message and have been baptized in
[1:22:59] the Holy Ghost and who have the token on
[1:23:01] display there are the only ones who can
[1:23:03] speak truth to injustice now how
[1:23:07] important is your life lived by the
[1:23:12] control of the Holy Spirit if the world
[1:23:15] can't hear it from you there's no other
[1:23:18] resources they have say well they got
[1:23:22] their Bibles and that's why we have
[1:23:24] thirty thousand different denominations
[1:23:27] because this can't be discerned by the
[1:23:29] human mind Jesus taught us that Jesus
[1:23:33] said it's not revealed you can't this is
[1:23:35] a this a locked up book it's written in
[1:23:38] a way that it can't you can't get the
[1:23:39] whole picture you can probe at it you
[1:23:41] can come up with some truth something
[1:23:43] close and kind of look like it and men
[1:23:45] have done that and thank God for it but
[1:23:48] but we've had many many errors and
[1:23:50] that's
[1:23:50] the only time it was ever taught
[1:23:52] perfectly was when Paul and the
[1:23:54] disciples and the apostles were teaching
[1:23:55] it and that's why God said now they're
[1:23:57] gonna lose that it's gonna go off in the
[1:23:59] Dark Ages I'm gonna give an extra grade
[1:24:01] of mercy because you you can't
[1:24:03] disbelieve what you don't know and it's
[1:24:04] not gonna be revealed so I'm gonna
[1:24:05] weaken a lot of ignorance and a lot of
[1:24:07] God's family went to heaven even even
[1:24:11] with misunderstandings of his word but
[1:24:13] he promised in the last day I'm gonna
[1:24:14] completely restore it back I'm gonna
[1:24:17] send a messenger and he'll have the
[1:24:20] opening of the seals
[1:24:20] it'll be fed to the people and now the
[1:24:22] world can hear once more direct from God
[1:24:25] as at Pentecost that's what this message
[1:24:29] is all about so only the Bride of Christ
[1:24:33] sealed by the original token they're the
[1:24:36] only people who are fully qualified to
[1:24:39] speak to injustice because everything
[1:24:41] else is a mixed multitude so now so now
[1:24:47] when we start talking in global
[1:24:49] understanding like that then then now we
[1:24:53] move beyond nationalism and American
[1:24:57] pride you understand as I said I love
[1:25:02] America I'm glad I'm here if push comes
[1:25:04] to shove this is my nation I would fight
[1:25:07] and die for it to protect its freedoms I
[1:25:09] would do it tomorrow my dad served in
[1:25:11] the military I would take my place you
[1:25:14] understand great men of God have taken
[1:25:16] their place I would do it today but this
[1:25:18] moves beyond American pride this moves
[1:25:20] beyond a national spirit this message
[1:25:23] first of all you need to understand this
[1:25:24] message has gone around the world this
[1:25:28] is a global bride a global people and
[1:25:32] inspiring people who are capable of
[1:25:36] receiving inspiration you have to be
[1:25:40] elected to that God you have a gene
[1:25:43] inside you are that's a receiving set
[1:25:45] that can hear that word of God
[1:25:47] you you hear man-made systems of
[1:25:49] religion none of its quite right your
[1:25:50] things you appreciate about it
[1:25:52] I like this movement that denomination
[1:25:54] this church it's all seems pretty good
[1:25:56] but there's too much of it I don't know
[1:25:57] it does it just seemed like surely
[1:25:59] there's more how many times have I heard
[1:26:00] the testimony
[1:26:02] people have come to this message and
[1:26:03] said you know I tried this one in this
[1:26:05] church in that church in this
[1:26:06] denomination that independent this one
[1:26:08] over here my mama said this my daddy
[1:26:10] said this and the preacher said this and
[1:26:11] but I just knew somehow there had to be
[1:26:15] more there just had to be more somewhere
[1:26:18] there had to be more and then they heard
[1:26:20] an Eagle scream oh my and inspiring
[1:26:25] people capable of being inspired now
[1:26:31] that that's what the word inspire Abul
[1:26:34] means not has a two-part meaning i want
[1:26:36] you to get this in spiral because
[1:26:40] inspiration for this word only comes to
[1:26:45] the inspiring jesus gave that in the
[1:26:49] india and the parable of some seed falls
[1:26:52] by the wayside some seed falls among
[1:26:55] stony ground some seed falls among
[1:26:57] thorns this is all humanity represented
[1:27:00] there and he's giving the gospel to the
[1:27:02] wayside it meant nothing the fouls come
[1:27:04] the demons come to take it away they
[1:27:06] don't even care they're indifferent to
[1:27:07] the truth you say well was Jesus being
[1:27:11] selective Jesus was just an all-knowing
[1:27:13] with his omniscience he knew that was
[1:27:15] going to be the case and so he tells it
[1:27:17] in advance here's what's gonna happen
[1:27:18] you're gonna go and you're gonna preach
[1:27:19] the gospel to every creature you're
[1:27:21] gonna teach all of them nations
[1:27:22] baptizing them in my name but but
[1:27:24] understand that to a large part of them
[1:27:27] is gonna be seed at the wayside just
[1:27:29] letting you know now so you don't get
[1:27:30] discouraged there's gonna be some who
[1:27:32] like stony ground they hear it they are
[1:27:34] non with joy but because the ground that
[1:27:37] because it's soil a thin layer of soil
[1:27:39] on top of rock and therefore whatever
[1:27:43] grows can't put in deep roots and so the
[1:27:46] only thing that can grow there is
[1:27:47] something in in the shade moss and
[1:27:49] things like that little small plants but
[1:27:51] but but any but if the Sun comes up and
[1:27:54] beams down hard on that heats up that
[1:27:57] rock underneath there that thing's gonna
[1:27:58] wilt and die because it doesn't have
[1:28:01] deep soil to put its roots down and you
[1:28:03] follow me and so Jesus is saying that
[1:28:05] there's gonna be some people who hear
[1:28:07] the gospel and anon with joy but by and
[1:28:10] by because of persecution they become
[1:28:12] offended they forget they get offended
[1:28:13] at the word it's too straight for me I
[1:28:15] don't
[1:28:15] want to live like that well if you don't
[1:28:17] want to be a Christian then you
[1:28:18] shouldn't try
[1:28:20] you shouldn't even try and and and you
[1:28:23] know I say why are you a Christian
[1:28:25] because I want to be because I love
[1:28:27] holiness I love righteous what has done
[1:28:29] that to me was I born that way goodness
[1:28:31] no I was born a filthy sinner I was born
[1:28:33] with every desire of the world dislike
[1:28:35] Paul said we all had our conversation at
[1:28:37] one time it but but then when God
[1:28:40] revealed himself to me
[1:28:41] I wasn't that way side or that stoning
[1:28:44] ground or those thorns I was the good
[1:28:46] ground say how do you know cuz I'm a
[1:28:47] believer and I it's of no merit of my
[1:28:51] own it's not because I was smarter
[1:28:52] because I was better I was neither but
[1:28:55] God rich in mercy oh my but now watch
[1:28:59] this because so inspiring means a
[1:29:04] capable of being inspired but the other
[1:29:07] the other half of it is fit for
[1:29:11] inspiration that is to say wow while it
[1:29:15] is still in spiral it is inspiring with
[1:29:19] a sense of responsibility a lot of
[1:29:23] people come under the inspiration of the
[1:29:25] word they never adopt a sense of
[1:29:27] responsibility they feel no
[1:29:29] responsibility at all there's even
[1:29:32] people set right in message churches and
[1:29:35] you watch their lives they never really
[1:29:38] take on the responsibility of what it
[1:29:40] means to to stand with the to stand with
[1:29:43] the body of Christ and be different they
[1:29:46] believe the doctrines they're convinced
[1:29:48] of the teachings they don't want to go
[1:29:51] to hell they don't want to go on a
[1:29:52] tribulation so they they they stay in
[1:29:54] this quagmire this no-man's land always
[1:29:56] going around never really getting rooted
[1:29:58] never really growing I'm not saying that
[1:30:00] children of God I'm just saying that
[1:30:02] even as a child of God you still got to
[1:30:05] accept him you've still got to allow him
[1:30:08] to change life and you got to allow him
[1:30:11] to be the to be the Lord over your life
[1:30:14] he's never going to force himself on you
[1:30:18] Jesus Christ you know that that's a term
[1:30:21] women appreciate you know a woman
[1:30:24] walking in a dark alley and suddenly a
[1:30:25] strange man steps out if he's a
[1:30:28] he's a gentleman she has no fear he
[1:30:31] would never touch her because he's a
[1:30:32] gentleman he would never force himself
[1:30:34] on her but if he's not a gentleman
[1:30:36] she's got a problem if he thinks he can
[1:30:39] get away with something so brother Ram
[1:30:41] says Jesus Christ is a perfect gentleman
[1:30:44] he will never force himself on you he
[1:30:48] won't force you to be a Christian he
[1:30:52] will liberate you and allow you to love
[1:30:55] being a Christian he will change your
[1:30:58] inside heart and you will never it's not
[1:31:01] about it's not about quitting things
[1:31:03] it's about you know say well I don't
[1:31:05] know if I can quit this I don't know if
[1:31:07] I can quit that I don't I kind of like
[1:31:08] doing this it's not even about that I
[1:31:10] you know I I just say if you just can
[1:31:12] fall in love with him I promise you
[1:31:14] those those desires will go away you
[1:31:17] won't care - oh my there there's no
[1:31:20] there's I don't struggle to not go to
[1:31:22] the bars I don't struggle to to run
[1:31:26] around and and lascivious lifestyle I
[1:31:28] don't struggle I I love righteousness I
[1:31:31] love being a Christian my mind my trauma
[1:31:36] comes when I fail to be when I slip and
[1:31:40] make a mistake down on my knees I go how
[1:31:43] many believers believe it like that down
[1:31:45] on my knees I don't want to be that Lord
[1:31:47] see so it's somebody who's fit for
[1:31:51] inspiration there's a sense of
[1:31:52] responsibility it's a people capable of
[1:31:56] receiving the signal of Revelation that
[1:31:58] comes down from God's throne it's an
[1:32:00] elected people an elected people to hear
[1:32:04] the revelation can I say it this way not
[1:32:07] just to hear the revelation but to
[1:32:09] become the revelation otherwise hear me
[1:32:13] otherwise it's just doctrine it's just
[1:32:16] teaching that you agree with that's not
[1:32:18] the new birth it's not the new birth
[1:32:21] Satan a Great Satan knows this is true
[1:32:24] he knows the will of God but he refuses
[1:32:27] to do it he's not he believes but he
[1:32:30] does he's not converted by that he knows
[1:32:33] who God is he knows God's never failed
[1:32:35] that doesn't make him converted listen
[1:32:37] friends it's not just about being
[1:32:40] convinced of its teaching but
[1:32:42] it's not about believing the word only
[1:32:44] it's becoming the words all purpose of
[1:32:47] the Holy Ghost is to anoint from within
[1:32:50] you a word of the message that you hear
[1:32:53] and the Holy Ghost its to omnipotence
[1:32:55] meet and you become a child of God and
[1:32:58] the world hears direct from God again
[1:33:00] through you through your life I got to
[1:33:06] close here in a second give me eight
[1:33:10] minutes so the masterpiece brother
[1:33:14] Branham says a beautiful sermon Wow I
[1:33:15] love that sermon July 5 1964 prophet
[1:33:20] says but the great sculptor took a
[1:33:23] prophet to see this the great sculptor
[1:33:26] when he seen the fall of his family now
[1:33:29] he's back in our text now he's back in
[1:33:31] Genesis where we started the great
[1:33:34] sculptor when he's seen the fall of his
[1:33:36] family the masterpiece he wasn't willing
[1:33:41] just to leave it lay there face down in
[1:33:45] ruin he went to work immediately to
[1:33:49] build it up again listen here's his
[1:33:52] heart here's the heart of God he wasn't
[1:33:55] willing that it should perish lay there
[1:33:58] like that all for all time because he's
[1:34:01] God and he will not be defeated so he
[1:34:05] went to work immediately and begin to
[1:34:09] build it back unto his own image oh I'm
[1:34:14] so thankful he didn't leave me laying
[1:34:16] there face down howl oh you're friends
[1:34:18] he wouldn't leave me laying there he
[1:34:20] wouldn't leave you he wouldn't leave his
[1:34:22] his creation laying there listen let me
[1:34:24] say this to you it's like why as I come
[1:34:27] to a close I got out another clip I want
[1:34:29] to play you and we'll end with this if
[1:34:37] you're the quote I just read where he
[1:34:42] talks about when he's seen the fall of
[1:34:45] his family the masterpiece he wasn't
[1:34:47] willing to just leave it laying there
[1:34:48] facedown in ruin he went to work
[1:34:51] immediately to build it up again he
[1:34:52] wasn't willing that it should perish lay
[1:34:54] there like that for all time be
[1:34:55] he's God he will not be defeated so he
[1:34:58] went to work immediately to begin to
[1:35:00] build it again into his own image that's
[1:35:01] why he gave Adam and Eve skins because
[1:35:04] it spoke of a he God slew the first lamb
[1:35:07] he gave them skins bloody skins their
[1:35:10] fig leaves of manmade religion couldn't
[1:35:12] cover them it took blood and God was in
[1:35:16] doing that speaking of the Lamb of God
[1:35:20] that in thousands of years the Lamb of
[1:35:23] God would be hung on a tree and that
[1:35:26] Lamb of God would be the atonement in
[1:35:28] the propitiation not only the atonement
[1:35:31] but the total satisfaction because Mara
[1:35:34] I've taught you on that he wasn't just
[1:35:36] the atoning he didn't just expiate your
[1:35:38] sin and make you sinless in the presence
[1:35:40] of God because if he only did that as
[1:35:44] soon as you sinned again you'd be right
[1:35:45] back in the lurch
[1:35:47] right back in jail you follow me so he
[1:35:50] expiated all of your past sins but he
[1:35:53] also knowing that you're a frail human
[1:35:56] being that you're gonna make mistakes
[1:35:58] that you're like you lied to the Bible
[1:36:00] says a man of like passions you've got
[1:36:01] your ups and downs then Jesus also lived
[1:36:05] the preceptive side of God's commandment
[1:36:09] remember precept upon precept line upon
[1:36:12] line Jesus lived every precept of God on
[1:36:17] my behalf so that when I failed to do it
[1:36:20] I still get credit for doing it because
[1:36:23] he did it in my stead he's not just my
[1:36:26] atonement he's my total satisfaction he
[1:36:31] expiated all my past expiated my fallen
[1:36:35] birth the way I came into the world born
[1:36:37] in sin X baited me of all of that
[1:36:39] because he was the atoning lamb his
[1:36:41] blood did that but he also satisfied the
[1:36:44] preceptive side of God's laws and lived
[1:36:47] it on my behalf therefore therefore when
[1:36:50] I do make a mistake and I do therefore
[1:36:55] when you make a mistake and you
[1:36:58] understand then you can then you say
[1:37:01] done finished well you could be finished
[1:37:04] if it wasn't for Paul writing to you in
[1:37:06] the book of Romans and telling you
[1:37:09] under inspiration there is their noun
[1:37:11] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:37:13] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:37:17] Paul Paul made it so clear Paul said
[1:37:20] it's not either died I'm not the one
[1:37:23] died Christ died how are you gonna
[1:37:25] accuse me I'm not the one saying this
[1:37:27] he's the one did it he's the one who
[1:37:29] gave me his life he's the one who said
[1:37:31] there's no condemnation because you've
[1:37:34] passed Jesus said in Saint John 5 you've
[1:37:36] passed from death to life you can never
[1:37:39] come into the judgment blessed be the
[1:37:43] name of the Lord
[1:37:44] so here when a prophet says immediately
[1:37:48] to build it back up again he wasn't
[1:37:50] willing that it should perish lay there
[1:37:53] like that for all time because he's God
[1:37:55] and he will not be defeated he went to
[1:37:57] work immediately and began to build it
[1:38:00] again unto his own image
[1:38:01] you know something friends manure sinful
[1:38:06] life and failures mean they mean nothing
[1:38:10] to you then this quote means nothing to
[1:38:13] you if say that again here I'm reading a
[1:38:17] prophet saying he went to work
[1:38:19] immediately you were you had no chance
[1:38:21] you were laying facedown his masterpiece
[1:38:23] was ruined but he wouldn't leak he
[1:38:25] wouldn't leave it that way he started
[1:38:26] building it back immediately you know
[1:38:28] something if your if your sinful life
[1:38:30] and your failures mean nothing to you
[1:38:32] then that quote no matter how beautiful
[1:38:34] it is means nothing to you but for those
[1:38:40] who don't want sin it's everything for
[1:38:45] those who don't want to be sinful for
[1:38:47] those who lament their weaknesses how
[1:38:49] many I got in here today say I don't
[1:38:52] want to be sinful I lament my weaknesses
[1:38:55] those who weep over their failures this
[1:38:57] quote is everything it means everything
[1:39:00] to me because I can see that jesus
[1:39:02] promised what he would do and he's done
[1:39:04] it inside my life oh it means everything
[1:39:09] to me friends I have the weapon I love
[1:39:12] all men if you weren't here Wednesday
[1:39:13] night if you hadn't heard that sermon

[1:39:58] the fivefold ministry amen
[1:40:01] I believe that friends and so you know
[1:40:05] that I was saying that how I so enjoyed
[1:40:07] I told Matt brother Tommy that was the
[1:40:11] song leader that was my son my middle
[1:40:13] son he's a minister here too he would
[1:40:15] have normally been preaching that Sunday
