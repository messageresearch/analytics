[11:25] want to see him in you, but I also want
[11:27] to see him in me [music] right here.

[11:51] can create our own world [music] outside
[11:53] of this world cosmos. We can walk in joy
[11:56] and peace and victory because of what
[11:59] you've done. We look to you this evening
[12:02] to break the bread of life, Father, and
[12:04] [music] feed our souls. Help us to walk
[12:07] closer to you when we leave this
[12:08] building tonight. I pray that you would
[12:11] bless the tithes and offerings. We want
[12:13] to remember our sick, those that are
[12:14] battling illnesses and sickness this
[12:17] evening. We want to remember those that
[12:19] are streaming that may [music] not be
[12:21] able to come to a service like this, but
[12:24] I pray that you would bless and be with
[12:26] them. Reveal yourself in a great way. We
[12:30] love [music] you this evening, Lord. We
[12:32] pray that you bless the tithes and
[12:33] offering. Bless that cheerful giver. In
[12:36] Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[26:28] might do to flights and things, but um
[26:31] looks like it might go above us as the
[26:33] latest forecast just above us. And uh
[26:36] [clears throat] I think I'm a little
[26:38] concerned over the boys over in
[26:40] Greenville, but I think it'll just go
[26:42] just above them as well. Amen. Noah
[26:45] [clears throat] was saying it's pretty
[26:46] cold over there today, so u I told him
[26:48] to stay inside. Amen. Praise God.
[26:52] [cough and clears throat] Want to be
[26:53] praying. There's going to be um I think
[26:55] that a lot of the ice is headed up right
[26:57] over where Sister Debbiey's family is
[26:59] there and Brother Richard and her
[27:00] sisters Roger there. And so they're
[27:03] looking at maybe some ice and brother
[27:05] Richard drives quite a ways from
[27:07] Statesville to from Conover to
[27:09] Statesville uh for diialysis. And so
[27:12] we're hoping he'll get back quickly.
[27:14] Don't know exactly if if he's going to
[27:16] be driving up or back Friday. I think it
[27:18] might be Thursday hopefully. Amen. We're
[27:20] trying to get him to get him up there,
[27:22] get him back, and Amen. get him get him
[27:24] hunkered down. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:27] Ephesians chapter 4. Guess what? I
[27:31] thought I was finished Sunday with the
[27:34] um um with the series on demonology in
[27:37] the spiritual realm. But I don't get to
[27:40] choose that. [laughter]
[27:41] That ain't that ain't up to me. So, I
[27:44] was finished as far as I knew. And uh lo
[27:47] and behold, the Lord began to really
[27:48] stir my heart yesterday, you know, with
[27:51] uh quite a bit more. Not quite a bit
[27:53] more. I should be able to finish it
[27:55] tonight. Amen. [laughter] Amen. Well, I
[27:58] mean, I could be wrong. The rapture
[27:59] could come in the next five minutes.
[28:00] Wouldn't that be wonderful? Praise the
[28:03] Lord. Wouldn't have to preach
[28:04] [clears throat] this at all. Amen. Could
[28:06] lay our uh lay our burdens down. Amen.
[28:09] Amen. Happy for that. What a what a
[28:11] morning that'll be. Ephesians chapter 4
[28:14] verses 1. We're going to read 1-6. We'll
[28:17] just read a few and let you be seated.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[28:22] &gt;&gt; I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
[28:26] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[28:29] vocation wherewith ye are called, with
[28:32] all loneliness and meekness,
[28:35] with longsuffering,
[28:37] forbearing one another in love,
[28:41] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[28:44] spirit in the bond of peace. There is
[28:48] one body and [clears throat] one spirit.
[28:51] Even as you are called in one hope of
[28:53] your calling, one Lord, one faith, one
[28:56] baptism, one God and Father of all, who
[28:59] is above all and through all and in you
[29:03] all.
[29:04] Now, [clears throat]
[29:06] it's amazing that in the continuation of
[29:10] of our reading,
[29:12] it's very clear in these first six
[29:14] verses, it should be clear to you by now
[29:17] that Paul is speaking to born again
[29:20] believers
[29:22] &gt;&gt; who are he says that full of the spirit
[29:24] of God, one God and father of all who is
[29:26] above all and through all and in you
[29:29] all. So, is there any doubt this these
[29:31] are believers? But yet he's
[29:34] [clears throat] going to go on down in
[29:35] our reading as we continue after we pray
[29:38] and seat you. And he's going to start
[29:40] talking about the necessity
[29:43] uh to to come into the unity of the
[29:45] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[29:48] God and unto a perfect man under the
[29:50] stature under under the measure of the
[29:54] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[29:56] we hence be no more tossed about like
[29:58] children.
[30:00] And he's talking to born again people.
[30:02] Amen.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; All right, let's pray. [clears throat]
[30:06] Father, we thank you for your word. And
[30:09] I just am eager, Lord, to get into the
[30:13] material tonight. And so, Father, we're
[30:16] just calling you on the scene and asking
[30:18] you now to be with us, everyone. We have
[30:21] number of sick requests that have come
[30:23] in tonight. And so, we're asking for
[30:25] your mercy for them, Lord. And we'll
[30:27] take up prayer requests just shortly in
[30:29] a more expansive way. But for now Lord
[30:32] may you help us and reveal the word to
[30:34] us. These are important hour important
[30:36] time that we live in. So we commit it to
[30:39] you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You
[30:42] can be seated.
[30:48] All right let's carry on in our reading
[30:50] verse seven.
[30:53] But unto every one of us is given grace
[30:56] according to the measure of the gift of
[30:59] Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he
[31:03] ascended up on high, he led captivity
[31:05] captive, and gave gifts unto men.
[31:10] [clears throat] Now that he ascended,
[31:12] what is it? But that he also descended
[31:15] first into the lower parts of the earth.
[31:18] He that descended is the same also that
[31:21] ascended up far above all heavens that
[31:25] he might fill all things.
[31:28] And he [clears throat] gave some
[31:29] apostles. Now he's going to he's going
[31:31] to break down the gifts. He gave gifts
[31:32] unto men. We just read that. And he he
[31:36] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[31:38] unto men. Now the reason that he gave
[31:41] part of the reason he gave these gifts
[31:43] unto men is expressed in that seventh
[31:46] verse. He unto every one of us is given
[31:49] grace according to the measure of the
[31:51] gift of Christ. So we're all different.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; But we all have one faith, one Lord, one
[31:58] baptism, one spirit. We're gifted
[32:00] severally. We're, you know, we're, you
[32:04] know, different in our nature, different
[32:06] in our temperaments. You know, we're
[32:08] we're different in our gender. We're
[32:10] different in our zodiac. We're different
[32:11] in our raising. We're different in our
[32:13] culture. and and but yet we're all one
[32:16] spirit, one faith, one body. So So the
[32:20] way that he's going to bring all of
[32:23] these these
[32:26] various parts that are all supposed to
[32:28] fit together, ONLY NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO
[32:31] FIT THEM TOGETHER. SO, he's going to
[32:34] bring forth the Holy Spirit, give us a
[32:36] new birth, and then send forth ministry
[32:39] of the word to to put it all together
[32:43] everywhere where it's supposed to go and
[32:45] fit it close together so that we operate
[32:48] as one unified body of Christ. G God
[32:53] dwelt in the unified body of Jesus
[32:57] Christ.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; And that's always the goal. Just because
[33:02] that there were 120 on the in the upper
[33:05] room and then 3,000 and then thousands
[33:08] more and then it spread to all the
[33:09] world. HE STILL WANTS IT. His goal has
[33:12] always been to get oneness.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; To reestablish
[33:17] oneness.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; And so he says and he gave some apostles
[33:21] and some prophets and some evangelists
[33:23] and some pastors and teachers. Now catch
[33:25] it. Catch it. These bornagain people
[33:28] full of the Holy Spirit, but they still
[33:31] need this ministry for the perfecting of
[33:34] the saints,
[33:36] &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the
[33:39] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[33:43] all come into the unity of the faith and
[33:44] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[33:46] a perfect man, unto the measure of the
[33:49] stature of the fullness of Christ. Why?
[33:52] that we henceforth be no more children
[33:56] tossed to and fro, carried about with
[33:58] every wind of doctrine by the slight OF
[34:01] MEN. YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT COULD
[34:03] HAPPEN.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THE OLD THING IS JUST GUESS
[34:06] JUST JUST GET THE HOLY GHOST AND IT FIX
[34:08] ALL THE PROBLEMS.
[34:11] We're finding out that THE HOLY GHOST
[34:13] OPENS YOU UP TO THE HOLY SPIRIT NOW
[34:16] BEING ABLE to grow you and mature you
[34:20] and BRING YOU INTO THE STATURE OF THE
[34:23] FULLNESS of Christ.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[34:29] That we henceforth be no more children
[34:31] tossed to and fro. carried about with
[34:34] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[34:36] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[34:38] lay and wait to deceive. But speaking
[34:40] the truth in love, catch this language.
[34:43] May we may grow up into him.
[34:47] GROW UP INTO HIM in all things, which is
[34:52] the head, even Christ, FROM WHOM THE
[34:55] WHOLE BODY FITLY JOINED TOGETHER and
[34:58] compacted
[34:59] by that which EVERY JOINT SUPPLY to each
[35:03] other.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; We're all in this together.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; All right. [clears throat and cough]
[35:10] EVERY JOINT SUPPLY ACCORDING TO THE
[35:12] effectual working. See, now we're back
[35:14] to verse seven. the effectual working
[35:16] and the measure of every part. It maketh
[35:19] increase of the body UNTO THE EDIFYING
[35:23] OF itself
[35:26] in love. All right. Now, [clears throat]
[35:30] I'm going to invite you to Matthew
[35:31] chapter 18.
[35:36] Matthew chapter 18. We're going to catch
[35:39] these first four verses.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[35:45] [snorts]
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Now Paul has just said we've got to grow
[35:50] up into all things so that we're not
[35:53] like children.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[35:57] Now Jesus in Matthew 18 at that at the
[36:00] same time certain at at that at the same
[36:04] time came the disciples unto Jesus
[36:07] saying who is the greatest in the
[36:10] kingdom of heaven? [clears throat]
[36:12] And Jesus called a little child unto
[36:14] him, and set him in the midst of them,
[36:18] and said, Verily, I say unto you, except
[36:22] ye be converted, and become as little
[36:26] children, ye shall not enter into the
[36:29] kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore
[36:33] shall humble himself
[36:36] as this little child, the same is
[36:40] greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S ADVOCATING THAT WE BE SPIRITUAL
[36:46] ADULTS,
[36:48] but in our faith and in our and in our
[36:51] observance of God's word, we act we
[36:54] humble ourselves like little children.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to go
[36:59] somewhere. Now, let me just say
[37:04] that, you know, when you're talking
[37:07] about uh humbling ourselves as children,
[37:11] very little tiny children, very little,
[37:14] don't really have to do that. They don't
[37:16] even, you know, it it it and it takes a
[37:19] very a very young little child uh before
[37:22] they begin to recognize even that they
[37:26] are
[37:27] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY SUDDENLY NOTICE THEIR HANDS.
[37:29] YOU I I seen I remember raising kids AND
[37:32] SUDDENLY YOU SAW THEY NOTICED THEIR
[37:34] HAND. WOW, I HAVE HANDS. AND THEY'RE
[37:35] BECOMING AWARE AND and they they you
[37:38] know BUT BUT WHEN YOU CATCH THEM very
[37:41] young uh somewhere between infant and up
[37:44] to about you know it's in months old YOU
[37:46] KNOW NOT QUITE A YEAR SOMETIMES BY THE
[37:48] TIME THEY'RE A YEAR AND A HALF THAT'S
[37:50] WHY THEY CALL THEM terrible twos.
[37:53] Amen. It's okay mothers breathe. You'll
[37:55] get through it. I promise.
[37:58] Brother Eddie said listen grandkids are
[38:00] God's reward for not killing your kids.
[38:02] So, don't just just wait. Amen.
[38:07] But I I was uh I was I WAS IN A IN A
[38:09] PARKING LOT THE OTHER day and and I
[38:12] noticed um just sitting there and Sister
[38:14] Deb had went into a store and I was
[38:15] sitting there and there was a young
[38:16] mother who got out of the car and she
[38:19] went around and she uh took a very small
[38:22] baby. Couldn't have been more than about
[38:24] maybe six months old, six, seven months
[38:26] old at most. AND UH JUST JUST THE KIND
[38:29] THAT YOU WANT TO PINCH THEIR CHEEKS
[38:31] completely off and and she just TAKES
[38:34] THE BABY OUT AND YOU KNOW THE BABY'S
[38:35] JUST okay I'm being lifted out of a car
[38:38] I'M BEING CARRIED THE THE BABY'S NOT
[38:41] SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHY DID YOU
[38:42] WHY PUT ME DOWN SEE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A
[38:46] VERY LITTLE infant and she's she gets
[38:49] around back she pulls out a stroller you
[38:52] know her husband's coming around this
[38:53] way he's got a couple more little
[38:54] children they're older he's got them by
[38:56] the hand and he's helping her erect the
[38:58] stroller and AND SHE JUST SETS THE
[39:00] LITTLE GUY IN there and and I JUST
[39:03] NOTICED THAT SHE JUST PLOPPED HIM DOWN
[39:05] AND HE JUST, YOU KNOW, he's looking
[39:06] around. Okay, this is what we're doing.
[39:09] AND AND I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, HE
[39:12] DOESN'T EVEN HE'S NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH
[39:14] YET TO KNOW HE HAS A will
[39:16] &gt;&gt; and that MAYBE HE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
[39:18] SEE, NOW, BROTHER BAM TALKS ABOUT THE
[39:20] LANGUAGE OF CRYING. IF THEY'RE HUNGRY,
[39:22] they they cry. That's how that's their
[39:24] language. That's how THEY GET FED. BUT
[39:26] THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS HIM
[39:27] DECIDING, HEY, YOU KNOW, MOM, I CAN I
[39:30] CAN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY WANT TO
[39:31] SIT in that. I mean, NOT ONLY IS SHE
[39:34] SETTING HIM IN IT AND HE'S COMPLETELY
[39:36] LIMBER TO IT, SHE'S ACTUALLY READJUSTING
[39:39] HIM AND FIXING HIM AND HE'S JUST LIKE,
[39:41] "OKAY, OKAY, IS THIS GOOD?" You know,
[39:43] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, AND SHE'S GOT HIM
[39:44] AND SHE PUTS HIS LITTLE CAP ON AND HE'S
[39:46] LOOKING around and all of a sudden here
[39:48] she goes into the store. And I just
[39:50] thought about this scripture, Jesus
[39:52] saying, "Except you humble yourself and
[39:56] become like a little child."
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; BY THE TIME THEY'RE ALMOST any age at
[40:02] all, you know, they they don't exactly
[40:05] sometimes they you feel a little bit of
[40:07] resistance when you take them by the
[40:09] hand. Sometimes you have to show some
[40:11] authority. Who's in charge here? But
[40:14] when it's a very LITTLE CHILD, THEY JUST
[40:17] PLOP DOWN WHEREVER YOU SET THEM OR YOU
[40:20] lay them on the bed, they lay there and
[40:21] they just look around. You know, YOU SIT
[40:23] THEM IN A HIGH CHAIR. THEY THEY'RE JUST
[40:25] SITTING THERE. They're waiting and and
[40:27] they and AND IT'S IT TAKES A LITTLE
[40:29] WHILE FOR THEM TO START TO DEVELOP THEIR
[40:31] OWN LITTLE PERSONALITY BEFORE THEY
[40:32] SUDDENLY REALIZE, I GOT HANDS AND I'M A
[40:34] PERSON AND I THINK THEREFORE I AM AND I
[40:36] got a will and maybe I don't like that
[40:38] and I and I'M GOING TO, YOU KNOW, I'M
[40:40] GOING TO LET THE PARENT KNOW. BUT WE'RE
[40:41] NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF A CHILD.
[40:43] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A a a little child.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus, I promise you, isn't saying you
[40:49] should be like a rebellious little
[40:51] terrible two.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Some of his children unfortunately are,
[40:56] but you're not supposed to be.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[41:03] &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE THE CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO
[41:05] recognize its own desires by I guess by
[41:08] being aware of its own life and its
[41:10] surroundings and as it becomes more
[41:12] self-aware and this then OPENS UP THE
[41:16] CHILD TO ITS own desires and and and and
[41:19] then you can see some resistant to the
[41:21] parent you know when the when the
[41:24] parents direction conflicts with the
[41:28] child's desires All right. Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; So, so Jesus said, you know, PAUL IS
[41:39] SAYING, DON'T BE LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN
[41:40] TOSSED ABOUT. THAT THAT'S SPIRITUAL
[41:42] IMMATURITY.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
[41:45] BUT DON'T BE SPIRITUALLY IMMATURE.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS LOOKING FOR MATURE, A
[41:51] MATURE BRIDE. JESUS WAS NEVER COMING
[41:53] BACK TO MARRY a little girl. HE'S COMING
[41:56] BACK TO MARRY A MATURE BRIDE.
[41:58] UH UH UH READY TO BE UH SIT BESIDE HIM
[42:02] ON THE THRONE AND RULE AND REIGN WITH
[42:04] CHRIST. BUT YET WHEN IT COMES TO OUR BUT
[42:07] BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SPIRITUAL
[42:09] MATURITY, A REAL SIGN OF SPIRITUAL
[42:13] MATURITY is a humility to act like a
[42:16] child.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; As it relates to your will
[42:20] &gt;&gt; versus God's will.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] Brother Brandham in the message oneness.
[42:31] It was a, you know, he had he had been
[42:34] in he spent, you know, in early 1962,
[42:38] he' he'd just come back in from Arizona
[42:41] and he had been all over Phoenix and
[42:44] Tempe and and preaching and and got home
[42:47] and he tells ON THE TAPE, YOU KNOW, I
[42:49] JUST got home last weekend, last Sunday.
[42:52] HE HE HE GOT INTO JEFFERSONVILLE JUST IN
[42:54] TIME FOR A SUNDAY NIGHT communion
[42:56] service there in the early first weekend
[42:58] of February. And then and then the very
[43:01] next Sunday now he's back in the pull
[43:04] pit. HE SAYS, "NOW LAST week we had
[43:06] communion showing that you know it's a
[43:08] IT'S A COMMUNION BUT IT'S FELLOWSHIP.
[43:11] IT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN CHRIST.
[43:13] IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TAKING THE articles
[43:15] of communion."
[43:16] &gt;&gt; And he SAYS BUT NOW TODAY HE SAYS AND HE
[43:18] AND HE GOES ON HE HE HE STARTS TALKING
[43:21] ABOUT HOW THAT HIS SPIRIT IS TROUBLED
[43:24] over the age that he is seeing and he
[43:27] feels VERY MOVED.
[43:29] UH BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AND HE SAYS,
[43:32] "NOW TODAY I WANT TO COME AND I WANT TO
[43:34] TAKE MY time and I want TO BEGIN TO SHOW
[43:36] YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS EARLY ' 62.
[43:40] THIS IS UH JUST YOU KNOW A LITTLE MORE
[43:42] THAN A YEAR MAYBE 13 or 14 months at
[43:45] most before the nation has already
[43:49] crossed the judgment.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; 56 WAS IT AS A NATION AND AMERICA WAS
[43:55] THE LAST NATION. AND ALL THE OTHER
[43:56] NATIONS ARE ALREADY UNDER JUDGMENT. IN
[43:58] THE 20TH CENTURY, 1956, THE UNITED
[44:00] STATES CROSSES THE LINE BETWEEN JUDGMENT
[44:02] and mercy. Brother Brandham said,
[44:03] "You'll never bring it back. PUT AN
[44:05] ABRAHAM LINCOLN and a GEORGE WASHINGTON
[44:06] IN EVERY COUNTY AND YOU WON'T TURN IT
[44:08] AROUND."
[44:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; BUT YET NOW THE CHURCH IS STILL, YOU
[44:13] KNOW, LIVING ON A SHADOW OF WHAT IT USED
[44:15] TO BE. BUT IT'S LESS THAN 14 MONTHS,
[44:18] MAYBE 15 MONTHS AT THE MOST BEFORE IT'S
[44:21] ABOUT TO CRUCIFY THE WORD OF GOD THE
[44:24] SECOND TIME AND BE INDICTED BY A PROPHET
[44:27] THAT'S GOING TO PUT CHRIST OUT. HE HE'S
[44:29] GOING TO BE OUTSIDE OF HIS OWN CHURCH
[44:30] FOR THE FIRST TIME in 2,000 years.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO THAT THEN THE THE CHURCH
[44:37] BECOMES NO LONGER HIS MOUTHPIECE. AND
[44:41] THEREFORE NOW HE'S GOT A A A MESSAGE IN
[44:43] THE LAND CALLING A BRIDE OUT OF
[44:46] ORGANIZED RELIGION BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO
[44:49] HAVE A MOUTHPIECE.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BRIDE. AND IF THE
[44:53] CHURCH KICKS HIM OUT, HE'LL CALL HIS
[44:55] BRIDE OUT WITH HIM AND SHE'LL COME OUT
[44:57] WITH HIM EVERY TIME.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:01] AND SO HE HE TAKES HIS TEXT OUT OF OVER
[45:05] IN IN [clears throat] HEBREWS, you know,
[45:07] GOD WHO AT SUNDAY times and and you
[45:09] know, AND AND AND TIMES PAST AND SPOKE
[45:11] TO THE um through the prophets AND AND
[45:14] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS BRINGING ON DOWN HOW
[45:16] HE NOW HE'S SPOKEN TO HIS BY HIS SON
[45:18] WHO'S HE'S BEEN MADE HEIR OF ALL THINGS
[45:20] who express image of his person and
[45:22] upholding ALL THE THINGS BY THE WORD OF
[45:24] HIS POWER AND HOW HE'S seated and risen
[45:27] TO THE THRONE. AND THEN HE DOUBLES BACK
[45:29] TO GENESIS 1. LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR
[45:33] IMAGE AFTER OUR LIKENESS AND LET HIM
[45:35] HAVE DOMINION. AND SO NOW HE'S SHOWING
[45:38] THAT CHRIST HAS COME AND HAS BEEN
[45:40] ELEVATED. AND WHAT'S WHAT'S THE GOAL?
[45:43] WHAT'S THE ENDGAME? IS TO TURN
[45:45] EVERYTHING AND GO BACK AND TAKE HIS
[45:48] FAMILY BACK TO WHERE GOD WALKED WITH HIM
[45:51] IN THE COOL OF THE DAY. WHERE HIS FAMILY
[45:53] HAD DOMINION OVER ALL CREATION.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:57] AND THERE WAS NO IMMATURITY IN ADAM, NO
[46:00] DISOBEDIENCE IN ADAM. HE DID ALWAYS THAT
[46:03] WHICH PLEASED THE FATHER.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; The second ADAM DID THAT. THE FIRST ADAM
[46:08] DID THAT AS WELL.
[46:10] SEE,
[46:12] SO HE HIS HIS WHOLE POINT IS NOW THAT
[46:15] GOD HAS SENT A WORD IN THIS DAY TO
[46:19] RESTORE US BACK to oneness
[46:23] &gt;&gt; where the body of Christ and Christ
[46:26] become Mr. and Mrs. Jesus
[46:30] where she is him.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; It's not literally him. She didn't You
[46:37] didn't die for me. uh you I DON'T GET
[46:39] BAPTIZED IN YOUR NAME.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO, BUT BUT IT BUT
[46:44] HEBREWS 13:8 GIVES US THE KEY TO THE
[46:47] STATEMENT. SHE IS HIM. THREE WORDS. She
[46:50] is him. Hebrews 13:8 EXPLAINS IT. JESUS
[46:54] CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND
[46:56] FOREVER. SHE'S NOT LITERALLY HIM. SHE'S
[46:58] THE same as him.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; You understand? HE'S THE BEGINNING OF
[47:02] THE CREATION OF GOD. THE BRIDE IS THE
[47:04] CONTINUATION OF THAT SAME CREATION. IT'S
[47:07] JUST EXTRAPOLATION AND IT'S STILL GOING
[47:10] AND IT'S BEEN GOING FOR 2,000 YEARS AND
[47:12] IT'S ABOUT TO BE WRAPPED UP.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; I'M IN THAT NUMBER. ARE YOU IN THAT
[47:16] NUMBER?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; SO, WE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE
[47:21] FACING and and and and THE CHURCH WAS
[47:25] GETTING READY TO CROSS A LINE THAT THEY
[47:27] COULDN'T COME BACK FROM. AND AND BROTHER
[47:29] BRANDHAM SAYS, "I'M I'M VERY MUCH
[47:30] CONCERNED WITH THE TIME THAT WE'RE
[47:32] LIVING IN. I'M VERY," HE SAYS, "VERY,
[47:34] VERY VERY MUCH concerned when I see the
[47:37] things happening. I SEE THEM TAKING
[47:39] PLACE AND THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN ME
[47:40] that's stirred." AND [snorts] SO HE HE'S
[47:44] GOING TO BREAK THIS SERMON DOWN, HOW
[47:47] THAT a true believer,
[47:50] YOU KNOW, UH HE'S GOING TO GIVE US THE
[47:51] PATH. HOW DO WE GET BACK TO ONENESS? ONE
[47:53] OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE'S GOING TO
[47:55] LAY OUT IS THAT A TRUE BELIEVER WILL NOT
[47:58] COMPROMISE on any word of God. BECAUSE
[48:01] TO DOUBT ONE WORD OF GOD IS TO ACCEPT
[48:04] THE DEVIL'S LIE AND YOU BREAK THE CHAIN.
[48:07] Immediately you BREAK THE CHAIN. AS SOON
[48:09] AS YOU DOUBT GOD'S WORD, THEN YOU BREAK
[48:11] THE CHAIN. AND PEOPLE EVEN EVEN GOD'S
[48:14] FAMILY SOMETIMES GET IN IN A HORRIBLE
[48:16] FIX. WONDER WHY DID GOD LET LET ME GET
[48:19] HERE? GOD IS STANDING THERE GOING, "GET
[48:21] BACK ON THE PATH."
[48:24] &gt;&gt; WHY'D YOU LET ME GET DOWN HERE? I
[48:26] DIDN'T. BUT YOU'RE YOU WALKED OFF THE
[48:28] PATH. NOW GET BACK ON THE PATH.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; WILL YOU HELP ME? I'LL HELP YOU. BUT
[48:33] THIS TIME, STAY ON IT ALREADY.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[48:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; SO, HE GOES ON TO SHOW THAT THE WAY BACK
[48:41] COULD NEVER BE intellectual wisdom. And
[48:45] I REALLY WANT THAT CLEAR TONIGHT. THE
[48:48] WAY BACK, AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD
[48:49] DESCRIBE IT, COULD NEVER be intellectual
[48:53] wisdom, but it had TO BE THROUGH A TOTAL
[48:57] UNCOMPROMISING
[48:58] ADHERENCE to God's word and the
[49:01] indwelling of the Holy Ghost. He makes
[49:05] that so clear in that oneness message
[49:08] to brother Brham. PERFECT ONENESS WAS
[49:12] NOT MERELY mental agreement
[49:16] with the word,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A SPIRITUAL UNION
[49:21] &gt;&gt; WHERE ALMIGHTY GOD LIVES INSIDE THE
[49:24] PERSON.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[49:28] [clears throat]
[49:29] WELL, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY. BECAUSE
[49:31] WITHOUT THAT, any works you did would
[49:34] just be man-made works.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; See? and and even and AND THEY MIGHT BE
[49:38] NOBLE WORKS BUT EVEN IF NOBLE THEY COULD
[49:41] NOT UH GIVE ETERNAL LIFE BACK TO FALLEN
[49:46] HUMANITY. See friends, REFORMATION
[49:49] WITHOUT REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; REFORMATION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
[49:56] SUNDAY. REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION
[49:59] IS STILL DEATH.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? SO, SO YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN
[50:06] WHEN HE DEFINES ONENESS WITH GOD AS
[50:10] HAVING GOD'S SPIRIT IN you and agreeing
[50:13] with the word and THEN THE THIRD THING
[50:16] THAT WILL BE AN EVIDENCE THAT HIS SPIRIT
[50:18] IS in you and that you agree with the
[50:20] word IS THAT YOU WILL MANIFEST HIS KIND
[50:23] OF POWER HIS KIND OF LIFE. WE'RE NOT
[50:26] TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WALKING ON
[50:28] WATER. IF THAT'S IF THAT'S WHAT HE
[50:30] DECIDES FOR YOU, THEN YOU'LL WALK ACROSS
[50:32] THE ENTIRE PACIFIC OCEAN AND BACK. BUT
[50:34] THAT'S NOT IT. BUT DO YOU HAVE POWER TO
[50:37] ALWAYS DO THAT WHICH PLEASES THE FATHER?
[50:40] AND IF THE ENEMY COMES IN, DO YOU HAVE
[50:42] POWER TO CAST HIM OUT? DO YOU OPERATE
[50:44] THE POWER OF LOOSING AND BINDING? I'M
[50:46] HERE TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU HAVE A LIFE
[50:48] FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU LIVE AN
[50:51] ADHERENCE TO EVERY WORD, THEN EVERY
[50:53] DEVIL IS AFRAID OF YOU, NOT THE OTHER
[50:55] WAY AROUND.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:58] AMEN.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS SAID UNTO THEM,
[51:03] "VERILY I SAY TO YOU," THIS IS MATTHEW
[51:05] 19:28, "THAT YE WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED me
[51:10] in the regeneration
[51:13] WHEN THE SON OF MAN."
[51:21] &gt;&gt; YES. CORRECT.
[51:24] SO HE SAYS JESUS [clears throat] SAID,
[51:26] "VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU THAT YE WHICH
[51:28] HAVE FOLLOWED ME in the regeneration
[51:32] when THE SON OF MAN SHALL SIT IN THE
[51:34] THRONE OF HIS GLORY, YE ALSO SHALL SIT
[51:37] UPON 12 THRONES JUDGING THE 12 TRIBES OF
[51:40] ISRAEL." SO TO FOLLOW CHRIST, AND I WANT
[51:45] TO SAY IT LIKE THIS, YOU MUST follow
[51:48] Christ in in the regeneration
[51:50] &gt;&gt; or you're nowhere. YOU'RE NOT EVEN OUT
[51:52] OF THE GATE
[51:53] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVEN'T FOLLOWED HIM IN THE
[51:54] REGENERATION.
[51:56] BECAUSE REMEMBER, REFORMATION WITHOUT RE
[51:59] REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND SO WHEN WE HAVE
[52:05] FOLLOWED HIM TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE
[52:08] REGENERATION
[52:10] without a willingness FOR DAILY
[52:14] TRANSFORMATION
[52:16] BY THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD, IT'S
[52:19] STILL IMMATURITY. AMEN.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAID, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
[52:23] like children, immature, tossed about."
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "YOU GOT TO HUMBLE YOURSELF.
[52:30] BE LIKE A CHILD IN THAT YOU HUMBLE
[52:32] YOURSELF TO EVERY WORD OF GOD." BECAUSE
[52:34] THIS IS THE REAL RUB. WE HAVE OUR OWN
[52:36] WILL. WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY. AND A LOT OF
[52:38] TIMES THE PARENTS WILL AND THE CHILD'S
[52:41] WILL CONFLICT.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE CHILD WANTS TO STAY HEALTHY,
[52:46] FED, AND DRY, IT NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE
[52:48] WILL OF THE PARENT. YOU HAVE A HEAVENLY
[52:51] PARENT.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[52:55] SO SO REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION
[52:59] IS STILL DEATH. BUT EVEN IF YOU COME
[53:01] THROUGH THE REGENERATION,
[53:03] BUT IF YOU DO THAT WITHOUT A FIRM
[53:05] COMMITMENT TO A DAILY TRANSFORMATION
[53:09] BY APPLYING
[53:11] THE WORD, WE APPLY THE TOKEN. THAT'S NOT
[53:14] A A WORD SALAD. APPLY the token. THAT
[53:18] MEANS TO BRING SOMETHING IN CONTACT
[53:21] WITH. PARENTS APPLY THE TOKEN TO THEIR
[53:24] HOME. THAT MEANS THE CHILDREN COME INTO
[53:26] CONTACT WITH THE token in their home.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. See,
[53:32] SO CLAIMING TO HAVE A DESIRE FOR
[53:35] transformation and I WOULD DARE SAY EVEN
[53:37] TO PRAY AND ASK THE LORD TO GROW YOU,
[53:40] BUT WITHOUT A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN
[53:44] DAILY WARFARE
[53:47] &gt;&gt; AND TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH.
[53:49] YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
[53:51] OVERCOME? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO OVERCOME
[53:52] THAT VULNERABILITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
[53:55] a couple of services ago. THAT BEING A
[53:57] HUMAN YOU YOU'RE VULNERABLE BECAUSE YOU
[54:00] HAVE CHOICE
[54:02] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S A HUMAN VULNERABILITY THAT
[54:05] YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY DAILY SURRENDER
[54:08] TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. THIS IS WHY THIS
[54:11] MATERIAL IS SO RELEVANT TO DEMONOLOGY
[54:14] BECAUSE EVERY DEMON OUT OF HELL WHO HE
[54:17] HE CANNOT DECEIVE YOU. SO HE TRIES TO
[54:20] HINDER YOU FROM BECOMING EVERYTHING THAT
[54:23] GOD WANTS YOU TO BE IN HIS WORD BECAUSE
[54:25] AS YOU ARE BECOMING THE WORD THAT'S
[54:27] SOMEDAY GOING TO BRING THE SAINTS OUT OF
[54:29] THE GRAVE.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US AS THE
[54:32] CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN AND THAT BRIDE
[54:35] AND CHRIST BECOME SO INTO ONE TILL THE
[54:37] GRAVES AND THE DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF
[54:38] YEARS WILL COME. SEE,
[54:43] SO JUST AS DESIRING THE CHARACTER OF
[54:46] CHRIST, BUT YOU HAVE NO WILLINGNESS TO
[54:49] SUFFER WITH CHRIST,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; that's a non-starter
[54:53] &gt;&gt; with God.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; You understand? See, NOW LISTEN FRIENDS,
[54:58] THIS KIND OF PREACHING IS, YOU KNOW, I I
[55:00] I JUST WANT TO I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
[55:02] THAT
[55:04] THIS KIND OF PREACHING AND TEACHING,
[55:07] HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THIS SEVEN-PART
[55:09] SERIES, IT'S VERY PURPOSE- DRIVEN. AND
[55:12] AND THE AND THE PURPOSE, THE BEST WAY I
[55:14] CAN DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IS I'M NOT HERE,
[55:16] FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU
[55:17] COMFORTABLE.
[55:19] I'M HERE TO CONFRONT I'M HERE TO
[55:22] CONFRONT DEMON SPIRITS.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; That anoint PEOPLE WITH SUPERFICIAL
[55:28] CHRISTIANITY.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And these things a lot of times live too
[55:36] close to us, too close in our homes, too
[55:38] close in our daily lives. AND I'M NOT
[55:41] HERE SAYING I FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND I
[55:43] SEE IT IN TOO MANY'S LIVES. I LOOK IN
[55:45] THE MIRROR AND I GO, "YOU BOY, YOU'RE
[55:47] YOU GOT TOO MUCH SUPERFICIAL GOING ON
[55:49] HERE. YOU NEED TO HAVE A YOU NEED TO BE
[55:51] MATURE BY HUMBLING YOURSELF LIKE A
[55:53] CHILD."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; SO, I WANT TO TAKE IT HEAD ON AND and
[55:59] the and the whole reason IS, FRIENDS, IS
[56:01] TO CALL US TO A HIGHER FULLNESS IN THE
[56:04] POWER OF GOD. I WANT TO SEE US OPERATE
[56:06] IN THOSE HEAVENLY ATMOSPHERES. HOW ABOUT
[56:08] YOU? DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR FAMILIES
[56:10] AND YOUR HOMES AND YOUR CHURCHES AND
[56:12] YOUR CHILDREN? WE WANT TO OPERATE IN
[56:13] THOSE HIGH ATMOSPHERES.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S A GREAT DESIRE OF MY HEART. SEE,
[56:20] AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT REALLY
[56:22] EVEN WHAT I WOULD CALL TEACHING
[56:24] DOCTRINE, BUT IT'S IT'S MORE DIAGNOSING
[56:26] A SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF THE age that we
[56:29] live in.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; But God has a prescription and a cure.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; AND SO, IF MY IF MY TONE SOUNDS URGENT,
[56:39] THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE IT IS. YES.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; If it's BEEN URGENT OVER SEVEN
[56:43] INSTALLMENTS, IT'S BECAUSE I FEEL
[56:46] URGENT. YOU KNOW, I I THERE THERE
[56:48] THERE'S A THERE'S A CRISIS OF OF OF doom
[56:51] that is THAT IS GROWING AND IT'S GROWING
[56:53] EXPONENTIALLY. BROTHER MATT SMITH WAS
[56:55] JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE SUNDAY
[56:56] SCHOOL LAST WEEKEND. YOU KNOW, THAT THAT
[56:58] EVEN AMONG THE CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVE
[57:01] conservatism
[57:03] and AND THEY'RE EVEN SAYING THAT IT IT'S
[57:05] WHAT ACTUALLY ELECTED TRUMP. YOU KNOW,
[57:07] JUST LIKE THE VOTE OF THE WOMEN ELECTED
[57:09] JOHN KENNEDY
[57:11] &gt;&gt; ON ON THE DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL SIDE AND
[57:13] NOW THE VOTE OF YOUNG MEN HAVE ELECTED
[57:17] DONALD TRUMP AND IS WHAT PUT HIM WITH
[57:19] ALL THOSE EXTRA MILLIONS AND WHY IT WAS
[57:20] SUCH A LANDSLIDE. HE LIKELY WOULD HAVE
[57:22] WON ANYWAY. BUT BUT BUT IT WAS SUCH A
[57:24] LANDSLIDE THAT IT WAS OVERWHELMING. IT
[57:27] WAS HISTORIC THE AMOUNT HE WON BY AND
[57:29] THE POPULAR VOTE AND THE AND THE AND THE
[57:32] and and and the and my goodness the the
[57:35] electoral college and IT WAS IT WAS
[57:36] CONSIDERED A A THROTTLING OF THE OTHER
[57:39] SIDE AND BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE OF
[57:42] CONGRESS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
[57:43] THE SENATE WON ALL OF THAT.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; And what IS IT? IT'S IT WAS YOUNG MEN
[57:49] FEELING ENTHUSED AND AND NOW THEY'RE ALL
[57:52] Christians
[57:54] and AND AND AS I WAS AS I WAS EXPLAINING
[57:57] LAST TIME, I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THIS
[57:58] THIS KIND OF A PATH AGAIN. WE'VE COVERED
[58:00] IT BEFORE, BUT IT'S JUST ALL SUPERFICIAL
[58:03] BECAUSE THEY GLORIFY GOD IN ONE MINUTE
[58:05] AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS THEY'RE DROPPING
[58:07] SWEAR WORDS.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; And they they they AND YOU CAN SEE THAT
[58:12] THEY HAVE NO COMPULSION AT ALL TO NOT DO
[58:15] THAT. IT'S AS NATURAL AS BREATHING.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; THAT AND THAT IS SUPERFICIAL. THAT'S THE
[58:21] DECEPTION THAT SATAN HAS SWN OVER THE
[58:25] WORLD.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS
[58:29] FRIENDS THAT THAT THAT THAT THE PIED
[58:31] PIPER IS IS GATHERING THEM ALONG WITH
[58:34] THE UNWISE VIRGIN WHO ARE SEEKING THE
[58:37] OIL. AND AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF
[58:39] SOMETIMES THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE REVIVAL.
[58:41] THAT FOOLISH VIRGIN ARE SEEKING THE OIL
[58:44] &gt;&gt; AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS GETTING
[58:46] CAUGHT UP IN THAT HYSTERIA AND THEY'RE
[58:48] ALL CHRISTIANS AND IT'S ALL IT'S THEY'RE
[58:50] NOT CHRISTIANS.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; CHRISTIAN MEANS TO BE CHRISTLIKE.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO IT'S A IT'S APPROACHING AN
[58:58] INFLECTION POINT UH TO A PERMANENT
[59:00] TRANSITION THAT HUMANITY IS NOT GOING TO
[59:02] BE ABLE TO COME BACK FROM. THEY'VE GOT A
[59:04] LITTLE BIT OF AN OPPORTUNITY WHILE THE
[59:06] BRIDE IS STILL HERE.
[59:08] OH, HOW WE OUGHT TO BE ON FIRE IN THE
[59:10] ATMOSPHERES OF GOD. HOW WE OUGHT TO BE
[59:13] HAVE A LIFE WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL. YOU'RE
[59:15] THE LAST VOICE. YOU'RE THE LAST
[59:17] [screaming] HOPE. ONCE IT CROSSES THAT
[59:19] LAST INFLECTION POINT AND THE BRIDE
[59:20] LEAVES, THERE'S NO MORE MERCY FOR THE
[59:23] WORLD.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; AND IT PLUNGES HEADLONG INTO A
[59:26] TRIBULATION PERIOD.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; My
[59:30] many inflection points in prophecy have
[59:32] already been crossed. And you KNOW TH
[59:35] THIS AS I CALLED IT SUNDAY THIS
[59:37] SYNTHETIC IMPERSONATION OF CHRISTIANITY.
[59:40] It's a trap.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; It's a trap according as I said to you
[59:45] Sunday. If the book of revelation is to
[59:47] be believed
[59:49] &gt;&gt; now if you don't okay but if the book of
[59:51] revelation is to be believed it's a trap
[59:54] that will lead them to the mark of the
[59:56] beast
[59:56] &gt;&gt; and destruction in the tribulation
[59:59] sadly. And I say that sadly.
[1:00:02] Oh, why were we we are still here and
[1:00:05] they still have a chance. Oh, friends, I
[1:00:09] I feel like I want to say with Paul, I I
[1:00:11] must I must not cease to warn every man.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; With urgency, thank God for the revealed
[1:00:20] word of the hour.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God for spiritual eyesight
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; that we're able to overcome. SAY, "I
[1:00:29] DON'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE MUCH OF AN
[1:00:31] OVERCOMER." THE ONLY OVERCOMING THAT GOD
[1:00:34] IS LOOKING FOR YOU to overcome is to
[1:00:37] overcome the deception to the age.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? JESUS ALREADY OVERCAME
[1:00:43] ON BEHALF OF your life.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; YOU GET HIM INSIDE YOU AND THEN YOU GET
[1:00:47] FULLY CREDIT FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE. I'M
[1:00:49] HERE TO OVERCOME THE LIE. I'M HERE TO
[1:00:52] OVERCOME THE DECEPTION OF THE AGE THAT'S
[1:00:55] TAKING THE AGE WITH IT. NO WONDER I SAY
[1:00:58] THANK GOD FOR EYES TO SEE.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; SEE, not only NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW, UH THE
[1:01:04] BELIEVER MUST YIELD TO GOD'S VISION FOR
[1:01:08] THEIR FOR THEIR LIFE, YOU KNOW, UH BUT
[1:01:11] BUT I I DON'T WANT TO BE I'M GLAD FOR
[1:01:13] HEARING, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A HEARER
[1:01:16] ONLY AND NOT A DOER
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; of the word of God.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; See, SO I'M GLAD FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE
[1:01:24] IN OUR LIVES. THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:01:27] Ghost is what GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO
[1:01:31] be this.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES BACK TO IT
[1:01:34] AGAIN AND AGAIN. He won't do it all for
[1:01:37] you. He's not going to push you through
[1:01:39] a pipe.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; See, the believer must yield to God's
[1:01:45] vision for their lives. I'm going say
[1:01:48] that again. The real believer like a
[1:01:51] child must humble themselves and must
[1:01:54] yield to the vision God has
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; for their life.
[1:02:00] See,
[1:02:02] we are participants. Do you believe
[1:02:05] that?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; It's all for the perfecting of the
[1:02:08] saints. We read it in our text. It's for
[1:02:10] THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY. IT'S FOR THE
[1:02:11] EDIFYING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. WHY?
[1:02:13] WHY? WHY? WHY DOES WHY DOES PAUL SAY
[1:02:15] THAT? THAT WE HENCEFORTH BE NO MORE
[1:02:17] CHILDREN TOSSED TO AND FRO. I'D SAY
[1:02:19] THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; SEE, SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE, WE MAY
[1:02:25] GROW UP INTO HIM. GROW UP INTO HIM IN
[1:02:28] ALL THINGS. AGAIN, HE'S ALREADY TALKING
[1:02:32] TO BORN AGAIN PEOPLE
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; WHO AND HE'S SAYING TO THEM, I WANT YOU
[1:02:36] TO GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS.
[1:02:39] THE BODY OF CHRIST. SEE, IT'S THE BODY
[1:02:42] OF CHRIST AND AND THEREFORE IT'S YOUR
[1:02:45] BODY. SO, THE BODY OF CHRIST GLOBALLY,
[1:02:48] BUT YOUR BODY YOUR BODY PHYSICALLY FITLY
[1:02:53] JOINED TOGETHER AND COMPACTED FOR WHAT?
[1:02:57] FOR WHAT? WHY? WHAT? WHY AM WHAT'S MY
[1:02:59] BODY? WHY DOES HE NEED MY BODY? FOR THE
[1:03:02] EFFECTUAL WORKING OF THE MEASURE OF
[1:03:05] EVERY PART MAKETH INCREASE OF THE BODY
[1:03:08] UNTO THE EDIFYING OF ITSELF IN LOVE.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; THIS IS HOW THE GOSPEL ROLLS. THIS IS
[1:03:14] HOW HE ACCOMPLISHES HIS PLAN.
[1:03:18] In love. Not love for the world
[1:03:23] but for the word and for one another.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; So, so when we're covering these kinds
[1:03:32] of things where, you know, you've heard
[1:03:35] it called, you know, nuts and bolts
[1:03:37] preaching, you've heard it called where
[1:03:38] the rubber meets the road. And I I THINK
[1:03:40] THAT'S PROBABLY FAIR OF THE KIND OF
[1:03:43] SERIES THIS HAS BEEN. BUT I I JUST WANT
[1:03:46] TO SAY THAT THAT WHEN I'M PREACHING
[1:03:49] ABOUT OUR LIVES AND WHERE WE LIVE, JUST
[1:03:51] REMEMBER I'M IN IT with you. Yes. Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm And I'M NOT I'M NOT ATTACKING
[1:03:55] PEOPLE. AND CAN I SAY, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:03:57] WASN'T ATTACKING PEOPLE.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; HE I'M NOT ATTACKING PEOPLE. HE WASN'T
[1:04:03] ATTACKING PEOPLE. We're exposing A
[1:04:06] SYSTEM AND DOCTRINE THAT PRODUCES A
[1:04:09] COUNTERFEIT COMFORT.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE BECOME COMFORTABLE
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR COUNTERFEIT EXPERIENCE.
[1:04:22] SO, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU
[1:04:24] COMFORTABLE. Is that okay?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not here TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE BY
[1:04:28] TELLING YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE covered if
[1:04:31] if you believe God sent a prophet. The
[1:04:34] devil BELIEVES THAT. YEAH. I'M NOT HERE
[1:04:35] TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE AND AND SAY,
[1:04:37] "WELL, AS LONG AS YOU believe the
[1:04:39] teachings." Let me tell you something,
[1:04:40] FRIENDS. I IF IF THIS MAKES YOU
[1:04:43] UNCOMFORTABLE, I GOT TO SAY IT ANYWAY.
[1:04:45] YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A
[1:04:49] PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE LORD JESUS
[1:04:51] CHRIST. WELL, IF YOU DON'T GET THAT,
[1:04:54] THEN YOU'LL GO TO YOU'LL TRY TO SERVE
[1:04:56] GOD AND IT WON'T BE VERY FAR. YOU'LL BE
[1:04:58] BROKEN. YOU'LL BE DISILLUSIONED AND
[1:05:01] YOU'LL BE WALKING AWAY WONDERING WHY GOD
[1:05:03] DOESN'T LOVE YOU.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. That's true.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Satan will eventually you're in church
[1:05:11] and you love God and you believe the
[1:05:12] word and you know what God did in this
[1:05:14] day. But I'm here to tell you, it's got
[1:05:15] to start with an experience with Christ.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, Satan will eventually put
[1:05:20] together. You hear me? I was once was
[1:05:23] young and now I'm older.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; I can hear to TELL YOU THAT SATAN WILL
[1:05:26] EVENTUALLY PUT TOGETHER the right
[1:05:28] combination. He's just trying to get the
[1:05:30] right get you IN THE RIGHT SPOT AT the
[1:05:32] right time. PUT TOGETHER THE RIGHT
[1:05:34] COMBINATION OF TEMPTATIONS, TRIALS, AND
[1:05:36] TRAGEDIES, AND HE'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT OUT
[1:05:38] of the game.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So my direct aim has been to
[1:05:44] emphasize over and over the necessity OF
[1:05:49] BOTH THE SPIRIT BAPTISM and disciplined
[1:05:53] thoughts and plans towards God's word.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] Yeah,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; I'm teaching you to refuse
[1:06:05] the false choice
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; between curtain A, just get the Holy
[1:06:11] Ghost and everything will fix itself
[1:06:14] OR CURTAIN B, JUST TRAIN YOUR MIND AND
[1:06:17] YOU'LL SOMEHOW OVERCOME.
[1:06:21] THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN BOTH OF THOSE
[1:06:23] THINGS, BUT BY THEMSELVES, THAT'S NOT
[1:06:26] THE FULL PLAN OF GOD. YOU MUST BE BORN
[1:06:29] AGAIN BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:06:31] AND THEN THAT OPENS UP YOUR CAPACITY TO
[1:06:33] BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF GOD AND TO APPLY
[1:06:36] THE TOKEN IN YOUR DAILY LIFE.
[1:06:40] [screaming]
[1:06:40] LISTEN FRIENDS, THE RAPTURE IS NOT A
[1:06:42] LAYAWAY PLAN. IT'S NOT EASY, REYNOLDS.
[1:06:45] IT'S THE SAME THING THAT ENOCH HAD. AND
[1:06:47] ONE DAY YOU'RE JUST WALKING AND THE
[1:06:50] RAPTURE IS THE SHORT STEP THAT HAS YOU A
[1:06:52] LITTLE HIGHER THAN YOU WERE THE DAY
[1:06:54] BEFORE. AMEN.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW ENOCH WENT IN A RAPTURE.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY HE STEPPED A LITTLE HIGHER THAN
[1:07:03] HE HAD THE DAY BEFORE.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; SO IT TAKES A SPIRITFILLED EXPERIENCE in
[1:07:11] your heart.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And a determination
[1:07:16] in your mind TO BRING YOUR UNCONVERTED
[1:07:20] FLESH SUBJECT to every word that's
[1:07:24] balanced. THAT'S BIBLICAL AND IT'S
[1:07:27] DESPERATELY needed in our ranks.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying]
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE DOES NOT TELL US in vain
[1:07:36] to cast down vain imaginations.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. PAUL DID NOT TELL THE PHILIPPIAN
[1:07:42] CHURCH, YOU KNOW, HE HE WASN'T VAGUE
[1:07:46] WHEN HE SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE
[1:07:49] TRUE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE HONEST TO
[1:07:52] BELIEVERS, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE JUST TO
[1:07:55] BORN AGAIN PEOPLE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE
[1:07:58] PURE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE LOVELY,
[1:08:00] WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE OF A GOOD REPORT,
[1:08:02] IF THERE BE ANY VIRTUE, IF THERE BE ANY
[1:08:05] PRAISE, THINK ON THESE THINGS."
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:10] SOLOMON DOES NOT MINCE WORDS IN PROVERBS
[1:08:13] 4. UH BRAD, GIVE ME PROVERBS 4:23-27.
[1:08:19] Let me GIVE YOU SOME OLD TESTAMENT
[1:08:20] GOSPEL. Is that all right?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON
[1:08:25] BEING VERY CLEAR, PROVERBS 4:23
[1:08:28] through 27, KEEP THY HEART WITH ALL
[1:08:33] DILIGENCE, for out of it ARE THE ISSUES
[1:08:36] OF LIFE. PUT AWAY FROM THEE A FRO MOUTH,
[1:08:40] AND PERVERSE LIPS PUT FAR FROM THEE. LET
[1:08:43] THINE EYES LOOK RIGHT ON, AND LET THINE
[1:08:47] EYELIDS LOOK STRAIGHT BEFORE THEE.
[1:08:49] PONDER THE PATH OF THY FEET, AND LET ALL
[1:08:51] THY WAYS BE ESTABLISHED. TURN NOT TO THE
[1:08:54] RIGHT HAND, OR TO THE LEFT. REMOVE THY
[1:08:57] FOOT from evil.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's not a word salad.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; That's not a word play.
[1:09:07] That's that's part of the gospel of the
[1:09:09] Old Testament. I
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; want TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS.
[1:09:12] IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART, YOU KNOW, IT'S
[1:09:15] JUST AS MUCH A PART OF ALLOWING THE MIND
[1:09:17] OF CHRIST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AS IT IS
[1:09:20] in the New Testament.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART OF ALLOWING THE
[1:09:24] MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST JESUS, WHETHER
[1:09:27] IT'S IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, SOLOMON IS
[1:09:29] PREACHING IT, WHETHER IT'S IN THE NEW
[1:09:30] TESTAMENT, PAUL IS PREACHING IT. YES.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; SEE, WHETHER IT'S THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:09:35] BRIDE OR THE NEW TESTAMENT [screaming]
[1:09:37] BRIDE, SHE HAS ALWAYS NEEDED TO LET THE
[1:09:40] WORD OF GOD DWELL IN HER RICHLY.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; SEE, the Holy Spirit
[1:09:48] is aware
[1:09:51] that your human desires
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; are not always aligned with what God
[1:09:57] wants for you.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's aware of that.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; It's why
[1:10:05] the Bible says, "Lord, remember we are
[1:10:07] but dust."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I've just had to fall on my
[1:10:11] knees and say, "Lord, just remember I'm
[1:10:12] dust. I'm so sorry. Just don't forget
[1:10:15] I'm just dust." Yes.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; he's very much aware that our human
[1:10:21] desires are not always aligned with, you
[1:10:25] see, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
[1:10:27] THE DESIRE in your soul cuz that's for
[1:10:30] God's word when you're born again by the
[1:10:31] spirit of God.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And that's a definite experience.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW YOUR FLESH IS STILL UNCONVERTED.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And it's GOT TO BE BROUGHT DAILY. THAT'S
[1:10:41] THE ONE THAT HAS TO CAST DOWN VAIN
[1:10:42] IMAGINATIONS. THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS to
[1:10:45] let the word of God dwell richly. THAT'S
[1:10:47] THE ONE WHO HAS TO CLAIM EVERY WORD AND
[1:10:49] APPLY THE TOKEN CONSTANTLY. SEE, THAT'S
[1:10:52] THE ONE WHO HAS TO TURN HIS FEET AWAY
[1:10:54] FROM EVIL. YOU KNOW, GOD UNDERSTANDS
[1:10:56] THAT SOMETIMES OUR FLESH IS NOT ALIGNED
[1:10:59] WITH WHAT HE WANTS. I MEAN, WE TALK
[1:11:01] ABOUT IT. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.
[1:11:03] HOW OFTEN, YOU KNOW, THE THE LORD
[1:11:05] DOESN'T LET US HE DOESN'T LET US KNOW
[1:11:08] WHAT'S DOWN THE PATH. BECAUSE IF WE KNEW
[1:11:11] AHEAD OF TIME WHAT'S DOWN THE PATH, WE
[1:11:13] PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE PATH.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:19] [laughter]
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; So Jesus
[1:11:23] instructs us to become his little
[1:11:28] children
[1:11:30] willing to be led by our heavenly parent
[1:11:35] in everything. Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Not just children, but little children.
[1:11:42] The ones who who will sit where the
[1:11:44] parent sits them and
[1:11:47] turn be willing to be turned any way the
[1:11:50] parent wants to turn them. Very little
[1:11:52] children don't resist. They really don't
[1:11:54] know to resist for a while. BUT BUT SEE,
[1:11:58] WE'RE NOT babes in Christ,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; We're not baby. I MEAN, IF YOU IF YOU
[1:12:02] WERE IF YOU EVER GET AROUND A PERSON WHO
[1:12:04] COMES OUT OF THE WORLD AND THEY'RE JUST
[1:12:06] A BRAND NEW BRAND NEW SPANKING BABY BOY,
[1:12:11] brand new born again, it don't even
[1:12:14] matter. YOU COULD TELL THEM YOU HAVE TO
[1:12:15] JUMP OFF THE ROOF TO GO TO HEAVEN.
[1:12:17] THEY'D GO JUMP OFF the roof. THEY ARE
[1:12:19] WILLING. THEY'RE SO THEY'RE THEY'RE SO
[1:12:21] HAPPY TO BE CLEAN. THEY'RE SO HAPPY TO
[1:12:23] BE SAVED. THEY'RE JUST READY TO DO
[1:12:25] ANYTHING. THEY WANT TO BE AT CHURCH
[1:12:26] EVERY SERVICE. [screaming] THEY SIT
[1:12:27] RIGHT UP ON THE FRONT ROW, YOU CAN'T
[1:12:29] PREACH IT HARD ENOUGH FOR THEM. AMEN.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T STAY BABES IN CHRIST. WE
[1:12:34] GROW AND WE BEGIN TO REALIZE, YOU KNOW,
[1:12:36] I STILL DO HAVE A will
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; and I still do have some plans.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; We're grown adults who have to humble
[1:12:45] ourselves.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And this is where we must get to. I just
[1:12:50] want to say this to you friends.
[1:12:53] This is really the the summation of the
[1:12:56] whole burden of on my heart tonight.
[1:12:58] come back on here and take this seventh
[1:13:01] installment on a Wednesday night. And
[1:13:03] I'm so glad it's a Wednesday night
[1:13:05] because I wanted to follow Sunday and
[1:13:06] and a lot of times Wednesdays you can
[1:13:08] just come and and there's just an
[1:13:10] atmosphere, simple faith, simple people
[1:13:13] who love God simply and they want his
[1:13:16] word.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; A lot of times you you can you can tell
[1:13:19] who your most spiritual people are
[1:13:21] because they'll be at church on
[1:13:22] Wednesdays.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:13:25] Amen. I'm not attacking. I'm I'm
[1:13:28] fighting against superficiality.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED YOU'RE BORN
[1:13:33] AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU WANT? [laughter]
[1:13:38] I'M TELLING YOU, YOU GOT TO GROW. SEE,
[1:13:41] YOU'VE GOT TO THROW OFF THE
[1:13:42] SUPERFICIALITY. UH THAT THAT LISTEN,
[1:13:45] IT'S A PLAGUE. IT'S IN THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:13:48] IT'S OVER THE WHOLE WORLD.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT. I
[1:13:52] WANT TO LIVE IN THOSE HEAVENLY
[1:13:53] ATMOSPHERES. I WANT TO BE ON FIRE FOR
[1:13:56] ALMIGHTY GOD. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE
[1:13:58] POWER OF GOD AND THERE'S NO HINDRANCE
[1:14:00] THAT IT CAN FLOW THROUGH ME. I WANT TO
[1:14:02] SEE IT FLOW THROUGH YOU.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; I hope this weekend, Sunday, I, you
[1:14:11] know, every year at the beginning of a
[1:14:12] new year, I kind of give, you know, what
[1:14:15] I've traditionally called my quote
[1:14:18] unquote state of the union address. you
[1:14:20] know, where we are as a church, what is
[1:14:22] our vision, the beginning of a new year,
[1:14:25] and and some things that I'm preparing
[1:14:27] that I want to open my heart up to you
[1:14:29] as an assembly.
[1:14:32] But but this is where we must get to
[1:14:36] if WE'RE GOING TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And do you want to
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; we're going to navigate and we're going
[1:14:44] to operate IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD AS
[1:14:47] USEFUL. I WANT TO BE a useful grown
[1:14:51] child.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; A child of God who who who has put on
[1:14:59] the armor and is ready to serve at the
[1:15:01] pleasure of the king. How many are ready
[1:15:03] to serve at the pleasure of the king? I
[1:15:06] want to tell you something friends. The
[1:15:08] Lord wants us to be wise and he wants us
[1:15:12] to be cunning and instructed and mature
[1:15:16] AND AND IN FACT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE ARE I
[1:15:19] I JUST WILL SAY TO YOU AND THIS AND I'VE
[1:15:21] LEARNED THIS BY EXPERIENCE and I I you
[1:15:24] know, I I I I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MYSELF
[1:15:27] SOMETHING ABOVE YOU. WE'RE ALL IN THIS
[1:15:29] THING TOGETHER. I SAY THAT all the time.
[1:15:31] But I'm I'm HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT
[1:15:33] THAT THIS IS WHEN WE ARE THE MOST USEFUL
[1:15:36] to him. UM YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN BE
[1:15:40] SPIRITUALLY MATURE BY HUMBLING OURSELVES
[1:15:43] AS A LITTLE CHILD.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE, BROTHER
[1:15:48] BRANDHAM SAID, THEN YOU'LL HAVE MORE
[1:15:50] POWER than the man that RUNS ALL OVER
[1:15:53] THE BUILDING AND MAKES A BIG BUNCH OF
[1:15:55] noise
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; because you have learned
[1:16:00] to conquer yourself.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; The edifying of itself
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; in love.
[1:16:11] Brother Brandham says finally in oneness
[1:16:13] 1962, here we are
[1:16:17] in the end time
[1:16:19] coming from the east and west,
[1:16:22] north and south. What are we doing?
[1:16:27] We're getting ready for a rapture.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. M getting ready for holding
[1:16:35] ourselves steady for a few minutes till
[1:16:39] every fiber is filled with the Holy
[1:16:42] Ghost. Then she'll go up.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Calling his people together to
[1:16:49] himself into in the true oneness with
[1:16:53] himself because it's his one Holy
[1:16:57] Spirit. By one spirit we are all
[1:17:01] individually baptized into one body
[1:17:04] collectively. The body of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:08] And Jesus Christ living with his spirit
[1:17:12] in our flesh is serving the church and
[1:17:16] doing the same things he did as a as an
[1:17:20] end sign to the world and that we're in
[1:17:23] the last days getting ready for rapture.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] So it comes down to this, friends.
[1:17:32] God's goal is to restore us back to
[1:17:35] oneness.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; God's goal is to see us living in this
[1:17:40] last day, this impossible DAY. WHAT HE'S
[1:17:43] ASKED of us is quite impossible
[1:17:46] if it were not for his Holy Spirit
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; ready, willing, and able to live through
[1:17:51] you and me.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Why is this demonology? because every
[1:17:56] evil spirit is will tell you the exact
[1:17:59] opposite of what you've heard tonight
[1:18:01] and heard across these seven
[1:18:03] installments. I'm here to tell you we're
[1:18:05] pressing towards something, friend. I'm
[1:18:07] pressing toward a mark. I'm growing. I'm
[1:18:09] maturing. I'm gaining ground. I'm
[1:18:11] gaining speed.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and you say, "Oh, why
[1:18:15] aren't you satisfied? I'll be satisfied
[1:18:17] when I'm on the other side." Hallelujah.
[1:18:20] Oh, that morning when that morning
[1:18:22] breaks eternal bright and fair. OH, WHEN
[1:18:25] THE REDEEMED FRIENDS, WHAT A WHAT AN
[1:18:27] HOUR THAT IS UPON US NOW. AND IT'S IT'S
[1:18:29] it's racing to meet US AND THE WORLD
[1:18:32] FALLING OFF A CLIFF. I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:18:34] YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I DON'T WANT TO
[1:18:35] I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ANY OF my any

[1:25:37] family, members of his family, James
[1:25:38] [music] and different ones needing
[1:25:39] prayer. Um, brother Tony writes in,
[1:25:42] "Remember my daddy's been feeling pretty
[1:25:44] um been following [music] um remember my
[1:25:48] daddy's been following pretty often." I

[1:25:55] Oh my poor brother George. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:58] Let's pray. Father, we are asking now

[1:26:07] him. Lord, in his in his aging now, his
[1:26:11] aging years falling. And Lord, I'm
[1:26:13] asking for strength for our dear brother
[1:26:15] George. I'm asking right now, Lord, mend
[1:26:17] and heal. If any there's any injury,
[1:26:19] [music] I pray you'll mend him up
[1:26:21] quickly. Put strength in him. Lord,
[1:26:23] don't let that happen. Father, that's
[1:26:24] just a cruel enemy that would do
[1:26:26] something like that. We're praying for
[1:26:28] your servant and [music] we're asking
[1:26:29] for your mercy. Lord, I'm reaching out
[1:26:32] for brother Bruce's family and members
[1:26:34] of his family. We were in a discussion
[1:26:36] today needing [music] prayer. Oh God,
[1:26:38] you're still the God of the impossible.
[1:26:41] Move on the scene. I pray for those
[1:26:43] young men. I pray for [music] brother
[1:26:45] Mark, Sister Tabitha, Lord, that you'll
[1:26:46] touch them in body. I pray, Father, for
[1:26:50] uh brother Anatoli Stell. You woke me up
[1:26:52] early this morning, Lord. Heard his name
[1:26:54] go through my mind. began praying for
[1:26:56] him, Lord, finding out, Father, [music]
[1:26:58] that he's uh having talked to his son,
[1:27:01] that he's he's been having some problems
[1:27:03] and [music] trouble, and you walked me
[1:27:05] up, Lord. Perhaps it was on my mind,
[1:27:07] Lord, as I went to bed, but when I woke
[1:27:09] up, I could just hear his name [music]
[1:27:11] coming through my mind, and I'm
[1:27:12] believing that you're going to touch
[1:27:13] him, Lord God, and that you're going to
[1:27:15] strengthen him [music] and meet the
[1:27:17] challenge. Lord, you know all about it.
[1:27:19] You know the challenges our brother
[1:27:20] Straov is facing there in Bellarus.
[1:27:22] Lord, I pray you will help him now. be
[1:27:25] near [music] him, Father, now tonight,
[1:27:27] Lord Jesus, this word that is going
[1:27:29] forth. God, may it be so that in
[1:27:31] tomorrow and days to [music] come, we'll
[1:27:34] continue to ponder these things. Help us
[1:27:36] now, Lord Jesus. We love you. Give us
[1:27:39] the strength that we need. We sit in
[1:27:40] this service tonight, Lord, and we heard
[1:27:42] your word, and it [music] challenges us,
[1:27:44] Lord, how it challenges us at such a
[1:27:47] deep level. And I just want to say,
[1:27:50] Father, I want to raise up both my hands
[1:27:51] to you and say, Lord God, put strength
[1:27:53] in us all. Help us, Lord God, to raise
[1:27:56] up into higher atmospheres, [music]
[1:27:58] meeting the challenge to be insign
[1:28:01] to a dark and dying world. May you grant
[1:28:03] it, Lord. We commit it to you in Jesus'
[1:28:06] name. Amen. Let's sing it again. [music]
[1:28:10] Reaching out to you, dear [music] Lord.
[1:28:15] I'm reaching out to you.
[1:28:20] I know [singing and music]
[1:28:22] your arm is not too short
[1:28:26] and it can [music] reach me too.
[1:28:31] So as I pray and press my [music] way
[1:28:37] into [singing] your kingdom true,
[1:28:42] I'll grow [music and singing] to be more
[1:28:45] like you. Just by reaching [music]
[1:28:49] out to you.
[1:28:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't have a
[1:28:56] microphone. We're going to need a mic to
[1:28:57] uh
[1:29:00] Anybody got a testimony? Okay, we got
[1:29:02] [music] several. We're going to grab a
[1:29:04] microphone real quick. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:07] Amen.
[1:29:14] Okay. All right, Sister [music] Mom,
[1:29:17] come on up here and get this.
[1:29:20] Amen. And I know, preaching, the
[1:29:22] battery's almost dead. Okay. All right.
[1:29:26] I just want to thank the Lord for last
[1:29:28] week. Y'all all prayed for me. I had
[1:29:30] [music] two uh heart tests last week.
[1:29:33] Doctor wouldn't let me out of them. So,
[1:29:34] I went they all went very well.
[1:29:38] I have to say it was kind of rough, but
[1:29:40] [music] I got through it for because of
[1:29:42] y'all's prayers. Another prayer y'all
[1:29:44] prayed was for my neighbor Ruth, who is
[1:29:47] just a blessing to me.
[1:29:49] on Friday, she had had uh went to the
[1:29:53] doctor and he sent her word, "Go to the
[1:29:56] ER right now." She went to the ER. She
[1:29:59] was scared. I prayed for her. She
[1:30:01] [music] went to the ER and they kept her
[1:30:03] for two days, I believe it was. And when
[1:30:06] she was ready to come out, it was
[1:30:09] diverticulitis. [music] She's had it
[1:30:10] before. When she was ready to come out,
[1:30:13] they thought she had COVID.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; They give her [music]
[1:30:16] tests and she had the flu.
[1:30:19] She's my age. She's 85.
[1:30:22] She come home extremely sick. After
[1:30:27] y'all prayed for her, that was amazing.
[1:30:30] [music] She was just almost healed
[1:30:32] perfectly.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Wow. Hallelujah.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; So, that's some prayer.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. [applause]
[1:30:40] Sister Melissa back there all the way
[1:30:42] back. There you go.
[1:30:45] I've been meaning to give this testimony
[1:30:47] since Christmas, but it just hasn't
[1:30:49] [music] worked out. Um, y'all have been
[1:30:51] so faithful to um pray with me about my
[1:30:53] testing. We did extremely well. Um, so I
[1:30:56] want to thank God for that. And [music]
[1:30:58] then over the holidays um I was um going
[1:31:02] to it was actually right before we were
[1:31:04] um going to be out for um the Christmas
[1:31:07] break. I was going to Bluff and I don't
[1:31:10] drive very often by myself, just to work
[1:31:13] and that's about it. And um I [music]
[1:31:15] had went to merge onto 170. And I guess
[1:31:18] I just really misjudged um maybe didn't
[1:31:21] accelerate as [music] fast as I should
[1:31:23] have, but what I thought was plenty of
[1:31:25] room was not. And how it was not a
[1:31:29] [music] serious accident. I don't even
[1:31:31] know. But three trucks was in a two lane
[1:31:36] road. I don't know. I can't explain it.
[1:31:38] But God kept me safe and I'm so
[1:31:41] thankful. And um you know, you get in a
[1:31:43] hurry, you don't really you're not very
[1:31:45] careful sometimes. And I was had a lot
[1:31:48] to do in a short period of time. So I
[1:31:49] was on the the ladder [music] and um
[1:31:52] it's just a step ladder, just a small
[1:31:54] ladder, but I wasn't being as careful as
[1:31:56] I should. [music] And I missed a step,
[1:31:57] fell off and not even I mean nothing. I
[1:32:03] could have, you know, really stove
[1:32:05] myself up, but God is just faithful in
[1:32:07] the little things. And I don't want it
[1:32:09] may sound [music] silly and but I don't
[1:32:11] want to ever let these things become
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; just common. I want him to know [music]
[1:32:16] I appreciate all that he does.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen, sister. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:32:20] [applause]
[1:32:22] [music]
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; It's kind of a praise um and testimony.
[1:32:28] I just want to thank God for helping us
[1:32:30] and helping me get through everything.
[1:32:32] But I'm on the other end of the spectrum
[1:32:34] now with blood sugar and insulin and and
[1:32:37] now my numbers are dropping into the 80s
[1:32:39] and the 70s like where they're supposed
[1:32:41] to be. And um I thank God for it. I
[1:32:44] haven't taken insulin in 10 days.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Um so I just need his wisdom on on how
[1:32:52] to deal with this end of that spectrum.
[1:32:54] And I just appreciate all y'all's
[1:32:56] [music] prayers. They mean very much to
[1:32:57] me. So thank you for praying for me. and
[1:33:00] I really genuinely appreciate.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise [music] the Lord.
[1:33:03] [applause]
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I [music] just want to thank you for the
[1:33:08] prayers for Sister Pam Kronite.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Um she came through the surgery. The
[1:33:12] doctor said everything went well. She
[1:33:14] was home the next day. The worst part,
[1:33:16] she was worried because they were going
[1:33:18] through her throat um to [music] do a
[1:33:21] spine um three and four I think and the
[1:33:25] surgery and she was worried about
[1:33:27] swallowing after and she said there's
[1:33:29] been no issues.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Wow. Praise God.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; So she's home and recovering and thanks
[1:33:32] for your prayers. [music]
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love it to know God answers
[1:33:40] prayer. Okay, brother Caleb, we give you
[1:33:41] the last word right back there.
[1:33:46] just want to thank the Lord. We were uh
[1:33:48] going home like it's been like eight
[1:33:50] weeks ago now, seven [music] weeks, but
[1:33:52] we were coming home. The kids were not
[1:33:54] with us and we got and somebody pulled
[1:33:56] out right in front of us and [music]
[1:33:58] um ended up totaling our car. Um but
[1:34:01] everybody was okay. Wasn't really a
[1:34:03] serious accident, but the insurance
[1:34:05] totaled [music] it. Um I just want to
[1:34:06] thank the Lord that the kids weren't
[1:34:07] with us and that he protected us in
[1:34:09] that. And then also having to deal with
[1:34:11] the insurance company. I was just
[1:34:13] praying [music]
[1:34:14] cuz I didn't want to have to deal with
[1:34:16] that and uh so I was just praying that
[1:34:18] everything would go smooth and it was
[1:34:20] definitely the Lord. I mean it was a
[1:34:22] five minute conversation and they were
[1:34:24] all very very helpful and it was it had
[1:34:27] to be the Lord. So I just want to thank
[1:34:28] the Lord for that Lord. Amen.
[1:34:31] [applause and music]
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around and shake hands.
