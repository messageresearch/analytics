happy to have you all in the house of God on a beautiful sunny Sunday morning amen praise the Lord looking forward to uh preaching this little sermon today it I think it'll stand on its own and um I

chapter 3 and verses 1 through six amen the Lord seems determined to stay in the Practical side of things today I find that that comes in Seasons as it were and uh I think my last series dealt a lot with practical applications of life amen that's part of what the gospel is for amen the holy spirit's purpose is to lead you and guide you into all truth amen if it feels a little stuffy to you the AC was down Amen brother Gideon and brother Ethan jumped on it and got it running for us so we're happy amen it'll it'll start cooling off here in just in a little bit amen praise the Lord oh I love the these verses here here from Solomon Proverbs 3:1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee I don't really think you could get more of a practical lesson than that I mean that's like a that's like a blanket life insurance policy that you get to collect on while you're alive for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck well these things must be important write them upon the table of thine heart wow this is really important so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not oh listen lean not unto thine own understanding Amen in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths amen let's pray father we thank you than you for your word this morning thank you that we can stand here Lord and I I guess I would best describe Lord I I thought this is an odd way Lord all week long I've pondered this thought you dropped it from the heavens start to finish in its entirety in in in in 20 minutes early early last Monday and all week Lord I've ruminated and all week I've added and tweaked and moved and sat and took the scriptures Lord because everything must go back to the scriptures we can say something is from you but we've got to be able to take it back to the word and prove that it's from you we can't trust just our own feelings and emotions Lord we've got to be established on your word so I've just Lord been able to go through the scriptures Point by point and every bit of this Lord is established in thy word father we won't it won't be necessary to read every single there's so many scriptures I have we'd spend the whole time but Lord I know that these are believers and I know Lord that the holy spirit will make it real and so we will give the references that we feel are necessary Lord and we'll track it back and connected to the word at all times I feel this morning Lord as I pondered this thought I thought I feel like Simeon who who was who was led by the Holy Spirit and he came to the to the word he came to Christ to the little babe Lord as Mary brought him in that day Lord and he was led of the Holy Ghost Lord and I just feel like all this week that's where I've arrived to Lord I've come now to the word lord to bless the word and to be blessed by the word and to say it's true and pledge my allegiance to the word of God lord I want to have a fresh Allegiance Lord in my heart to your word today may it be so may you be our portion we commit it to you in jesus' name amen God bless you as you are seated as I said there are so many passages that I could have um read today we're going to read a number of them so bubs just stay ready because we're going to give you a workout today amen praise the Lord Advantage is something that I would say is has a universal appeal I I certainly would say that we definitely don't want to find ourselves disadvantaged you know as soon as you know as soon as you start to come up on an idea you know the human mind mind automatically begins to work on well is this going to be good or bad is this going to be to my advantage or to my disadvantage and we make decisions all the time based on that we make business decisions amen we make family decisions we make you know uh we we make where where where we're going to live is this going to be to my advantage or to my disadvantage will this job be to my advantage or to my disadvantage and you know will this relationship will this friendship will this activity will will this Venture will this investment is this going to work to my advantage I'm pretty sure that we would have 100% agreement that we like advantage and we don't too much like disadvantage amen and there's nothing wrong with that that's human nature and and the Lord you know even even said that he says I would that you prosper and be in health we'll read that just in a few minutes I would that you prosper and be in health I remember you know some time ago way back in the day actually when I was just a young Minister you know I had a little bit of a struggle you know I hadn't been uh preaching in the pull pit all that long I'd been working in Ministry for years ahead of preaching in the pull pit but I remember that when I finally St St behind the pull pit it was a it was a whole new world and it was next level and I realized that and and and I you know and I I wouldn't do it for a long time until I felt fully equipped and ready for that so I I stayed in in in in lower levels of ministry and public Bible studies and Sunday School classes and things like that not that there's uh lower and Le and higher levels of ministry it's all Ministry I'm just talking about that you know you've got a different kind of an audience when you're standing behind a pull pit there's expectations and that's not wrong and I I think that if somebody comes behind a pull pit he ought to have something to say and I'll tell you something friends I appreciate the ministry God has given us at bethl Tabernacle I I I will confess openly that high octane delivery will entertain me for about 15 minutes but after that you better have something to say or I'm going to be very much impatient and I over the years I've been very zealous and guarded the pull pit here at bethl Tabernacle we don't want to see you come here and waste your time this is not a social gospel you being here is not a social experiment this is the house of God this the house of God's bread this is bethl Tabernacle and we believe that we are coming it's a house of correction it's a house of of instruction it's a house of judgment it's a house of encouragement it's a House of Prayer it's a house of the presence of God and it is a privilege to come to it for me for you and it is a great privilege to hear the word of God and find within you an amen that's beyond you I love the fact that that even when I even when I hear things preached across the pull pit that might scald me a little bit might might you know really bring some correction and and and and in my own human Spirit I'm a little bit quiet it but I hear another voice down inside of me saying amen amen amen I'm here to tell you friends that's that's what a new birth is that there is a being other than you living in you Hallelujah and so that we were we were dealing with the young people on that the other night at the at the minister I mean at the youth service Brother Brad was teaching on what is the Holy Ghost and we were just in our wrapping up comments showing that it is the new birth it is the spirit of Christ living inside you and here's the beauty that was always the plan yes am that was always the plan God was always after that he was never going to just stay God above us he wanted to be God Among Us and God with us and that's what Jesus was he was God with us but even even Jesus wasn't prep even Jesus was never going to be willing and God was never going to be willing to stay bottled up in the body of one man walking the shores of Galilee uh because he wanted to not just be in Christ he wanted through Christ to be in all of us and so what is the Holy Ghost it is the new birth what is the new birth it's being born again of the spirit of God and that is a beautiful thing and that that is what begins to challenge us to push us forward and drive us with Zeal to allow the word because that's where you know brother Brandon made it so clear concerning we we've told you know don't ever don't ever try to put God in a box don't ever dictate to him how he must answer your prayer don't do that he's a king and he's not he's not accustomed to being dictated to you understand we'll get to more of that in a little bit I'm getting ahead of myself but I'm already feeling like preaching and so so we we that that it is it is Christ taking the head the position of headship in your life that's what being a Christian is I want you to know he's earned it I want you to know he's worthy of it he deserves to be first in your life he has earned first place in your life he doesn't want to be second he does not deserve to be second and it's to your disadvantage to make him second say well why don't he just make himself first cuz he's a gentleman he won't do that it's like a young lady wouldn't want wouldn't want some young man to force himself on her Christ is a he she'd want him to be a gentleman Christ is a gentleman he will not force himself on uh even his elect lady as as the possible calls or even the bride of Christ it's and he has every right to do it because he gave his life to purchase you and therefore you are no longer yours you're his you belong to him and that's an advantage because that means you have eternal life so so what if the world has to reject me and Scorn me and ridicule me I'll still be alive 20 million years after they're gone Hallelujah so what does it matter anyway I'll be alive 20 million years after Lucifer's gone and when I'm a 20 million years past him I won't be one day older or have one day less to be past luer I'm going to be glad had to be past him so there are so many advantages of loving the true God it doesn't do you a lot of good I'm not saying it doesn't do you some good to be a church member to clean up your life to appreciate the fine qualities of Jesus to try to emulate some of his uh decent moral ways of honesty and integrity uh those things are fine but you understand friends that none of your works of your flesh will ever gain you eternal life you can't earn eternal life like that you have to die and be reborn again that's how the Holy Spirit comes it's got to be a willing death it's got to be you know Christ in you the hope of glory so when you when you're willing to go the way of the word all the way fully cuz that's the only way the Seal of the Holy Spirit comes and it's you got to be willing like Jesus to die be buried and then resurrected amen see so so when you when you won't do that then you you live you know in in just varying degrees of sanctification there's value in that uh but there's but really to pass from Death un life you must be born again you must be go living you know going to a church is good but you know parking your car in a garage is a good thing but parking it in a garage didn't ain't what made it a car you can't sit in a garage and become a car so going to church can be a good thing although the devil can use that against you you know it I mean whenever you refuse let me just put it this way say well how how can how can let me just take that side of it for a second how can go going to a church be a bad thing well brother ROM talks about that there's this principle that sometimes can happen it's not in every case but it can happen is that you you bring unconverted people and set them in a church and tell them they're okay right and they really know they're not but they take your word for it and then God can't deal with them anymore cuz they already think they're okay and they're not okay and brother said all you're doing is piling up Stones he said you'd have been better to left them out there then they knew what they were and then God could deal with them I I heard brother Glenn Miller many years ago a former pastor of mine gone on to be with the Lord he said you cannot convince a man that he needs salvation if you first can't convince him that he's lost you can't convince him to be saved and be found unless you can first prove to him that he's lost see and so as preachers we go through the the word of God and we make that case we prove that you're born in sin the Bible proves that you're conceived and you're shaped in iniquity uh the Bible proves in in in separate places I know people daisy chain that together that's actually not grouped together like that in any verse born in you know born in sin shapen in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's a daisy chain of of truths that are found in various places of the scripture it's certainly true and and so the Bible proves these things and it proves that there's none good no not one it proves that we're we're all Sinners and we all need to be reborn so so there there there comes then this this Advantage so there's advantages and disadvantages to joining a church to being a better just to being a better person but just being a better person right does that make sense so there's advantages and there's disadvantages when I'm when I'm thinking of something that would certainly have to be the most important thing to any human being is eternal life amen and so if if it's something that's not important but the most important thing then I want to I would like to know that I have the version that is all Advantage completely Advantage say well but don't Born Again people make mistakes that's the advantage they do and it don't count say but but but do do they get do they get punished also they do because because Godly Parents will correct children and he's first a heavenly father and he will correct his children see but and that's why brother Ram said you'll do wrong as a Believer you're still in the flesh you'll even willfully do wrong you'll make mistakes but it's not in your heart to do it and that's why you repent I mean otherwise then why did you repent because it means you didn't want to do that you didn't want to be that and you go to the Lord you say I didn't I don't want that in my life and if we're and if we're faithful to confess our sins then he's faithful to forgive our sinsen so the prophet said you will do wrong as in making stumbles and mistakes he says but that doesn't mean you're not a son it just means the rod of Correction is on the way now it's hard to pray for the rod of Correction but I can pray Lord I want to be like you and whatever it takes I want to I want to know that I have every Advantage you say what is the most advantageous position you could be in to believe every word of God because if you believe every word of God then all Heaven is behind you and all hell and demons are subject to you and they're all under your feet I would say that's an epic Advantage amen amen John 15:15 Noah Jesus speaking here in St John chapter 15 verse 15 henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you so you know having Jesus as a close friend is a wonderful thing you know the Bible talks about how that Abraham in James chapter 2 Noah James chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture uh wait I'll wait till he till he pulls that up and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the most ad advantageous thing you could be called what a an advantage to be called the friend of I mean I'm glad if I'm your friend but I'm really glad if I'm his friend amen see because I might do things so AG es to you that you wouldn't want to be my friend anymore but if I do that to him he'll he'll correct me and remain my friend and as long as as long as he's my friend the devil's my enemy right so you don't want to be friends with the world Jesus showed how impossible that friendship with the world does not work for the Kingdom of Heaven it does not work that will put you at an extreme disadvantage because you're following the devil who's lying to you and you're outside of the reliable protection and support of the holy spirit because you're holding hands with the world you're you're I mean you're in a really bad position when you do that so so then we find then that that having faith in God from our scripture here in James 2:23 you notice the context of it that the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God all right and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so having faith in God and living a life of righteousness leads to a friendship with God is that easy and I would say to you today that the only kind of friend God has our close friends Rejoice because you're a close friend I got friends and I got close friends you got friends you got we got close friends we got we got acquaintances then we got friends and we got close friends but With God all of his F the ground is level at the foot of the cross and he loves us all equally Hallelujah he loves a faithful listen he loves a faithful housewife as much as he loves a faithful Prophet amen what a beautiful thing you have just as much access to him as as a as a ditch digger as you would if you were a prophet to the ages you you have the ability to lift yourself up into his presence and say father and have a father say yes my child see so there's there's Great Value in knowing Christ as a close friend when we look at Genesis chapter 13 and we we'll catch Genesis 13 and we'll read 14-1 17 this is the Lord speaking to Abraham or Abram at the time Genesis 13:14 and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now Thine Eyes now that's the second time that a that a person does this in recorded in the Bible the first time someone lifted up their eyes they it was lot and Abram said to him look where you'll go and choose and wherever you choose I'll go the opposite direction CU our we we we need to separate and that was God separating out his family to walk alone with him I'm here to tell you something God has an elected family and they are separate from the rest of the world they're separate from the unwise Virgin they're not even that they are they're separate from just good people they're separate from just church people they are the Holy Ghost filled Born Again family of God a gene of God before the foundation of the world the only ability to be fully redeemed and say Amen to every word that's Bible teaching only the predestinated are considered in Redemption God offers a legitimate opportunity for everyone to be saved from destruction that doesn't mean he doesn't have a family whose names were recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and so so we we find that that they are to be separate and and it took Abraham listen it took Abraham a a while and some hardships to finally do that amen God had already told him separate yourself and leave and I'll take you to a place and I'll show you where just leave and I'll show you and when he obeyed the Lord started leading and and SP and kept kept kept with him as soon as Abraham halted first of all he didn't make a clean uh cut he took family with him that were holding him back you know and kin folk that were holding him back and and God was trying to get him to this point right here God was trying to get him to Genesis 13 and Abraham took a longer than he needed to to get there amen see but finally after Abraham went through enough disadvantage from trying to serve god listen trying to serve God but not willing to separate himself from everything and after he went through finally enough hardship and and and difficulty and disadvantage Abram finally separated himself and fact is he never would separate himself from one part God had to take him home to Glory he just wouldn't make the choice and sometimes God does that sometimes you just won't let something go and God has to rip it from you and it hurts but he will and then finally it got to the point where he has to separate from the last vestage of connection now he's still he's still in a close association with a type of the unwise Virgin lot lot's a righteous man but lot's not the part of the elected he's never going to get Abraham's promise he's going to get a promise he's going to get God's going to take care of him God's got something for him God's got something for the they're all virgins whether they're wise or unwise you're never going to make the unwise Virgin the Harlot Daughters of the Book of Revelation they're not they're virgins unto God but they never get the Holy Ghost they never get born again they they never can quite see completely the message of the hour of any hour they've been in every age there's always been a Remnant uh and and God has a place for them and they'll be in heaven but they that's that's different than living in the Royal City and being part of the royal family I'll take it but I'd much rather be where I'm at it's an advantage so so we find that finally he's willing to separate and now the first time these words got said he lifted up his eyes was when Abra Abram offered him to say you choose which way you'll go and here is where that righteous man showed his exact colors he the Bible says he lifted up his eyes first time in the scripture he lifted up his eyes and he looked toward the what he thought was an advantage the fertile Plains looked toward Sodom he looked toward that Metropolis that Cosmopolitan City he looked toward that that that modern version you know where where he could actually intermingle to the degree that he became like a mayor of the city and became a judge and sat in the gate and judged people became accepted in high society and his wife was a society woman cost her her life cost her her life that was a that would that was a hard lesson for brother lot because he had to there was no way to escape feeling responsible that that all of his family didn't get out and even his wife didn't make it out see and that that's hard on a father and on a husband when you when you have to uh face the music on that and I I don't wish that upon anybody but his mistake was he lifted up his eyes and looked toward what he thought was an advant vage which was actually a disadvantage and then once that was done now the Lord said to Abram now lift up your eyes now now the beauty of it is is because that Abram had stayed separated and had not made that choice to go down there then God is simply saying to him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou Thou Art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if any man could number the dust of the earth so shall thy seed also be numbered now this is not just going to be Israelites in the natural this is going to be the family of God spiritually Jew Gentile both sides of it Hallelujah Bond free male female is are all going to be the firstborn of the family of God they're all going to be priests and kings and and of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no end I'm telling you something friends we got some Advantage coming arise see now this is the beauty of it once Abram had finally hear me once Abram finally got tired of the of the things God had to do to get him to separate everything and he actually did it then Abraham didn't have to Abraham didn't have to even figure out his future God said all I need you to do is look in every direction everything around you that you can see is yours I created I built it and I'm deeding it to you and to your family [Music] forever arise verse 7 walk through the land now brother bradam taught us in a trumpet giving an uncertain sound he taught us that footsteps means possession I'm going to read it here in a moment so he says arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee so brother brandham picks this up in in now the now the next time let me let me let me let me give you this first then that's what he says to Abram walk through it then he comes to Deuteronomy chap 11 and verse 24 single verse Deuteronomy 1124 every place wherein The Souls of your feet first time that phrase is used The Souls of your feet he said every Place whereon The Souls of your feet shall tread speaking to Moses to the children of Israel shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall be your Coast all right now now we go to Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 verse three here it is again second time it's in the script scripture every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses and he said it unto Moses in Deuteronomy 11 and he had before he had said it to Joshua he said it to Moses and before he said it to Moses he' said it to Abraham see so so Moses then brought the first Exodus right he brought them out of of Egypt and then Joshua which was a type of the Holy Ghost took them into the promised land to possess it they didn't go in there to hang out they went in there to possess it that's right why what what what audacity there were people already living there right but God had already been warning them you need to clear out because this land is already titled and deeded to my people and they've sojourned for 4 UND years but they're coming home and you either get out or you'll be driven out or you'll be destroyed and so we find that when Moses brings them out and Pharaoh tried to stop him and that didn't work and then the Holy Ghost under Joshua took them into the promised land to possess it and it began now listen this possession which look like a complete Advantage you're being given the Promised Land would you call that an advantage but it began with possessing the Gate of the enemy under Joshua so now you say wait a minute I thought I thought this was pure Advantage It is Well then why do we got to fight because that's the way God has it for you in this life and you God brought you out of the world and God brought you into the Holy Ghost and you're headed for a millennium but you're here to fight you're not here for a picnic you're here to fight you're here to prove God's word you're here to prove the devil's a liar that's why I'm a Christian that's why you have the advantage of the Holy Ghost so that you have weapons of of warfare and those weapons are Mighty to the pulling down of strongholds so we find that literally they've got to possess the Gate of the enemy and that that begins under Joshua and it ends with Solomon because in Solomon's day all the enemies were conquered all the land was taken everything was under his feet his very name meant peace he's the son of David and that's a type of Christ in the Millennium and so I'm here to tell you from The Upper Room experience to the millennial rain Hallelujah we are possessing the Gate of the enemy amen amen see we're all the children of Abraham today and we're still taking the land and taking every enemy until the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ oh there's Great Value in knowing Christ as a close friend there's great advantage in knowing him in this way you are carrying on that today you are brother and I want to give you that quote brother I promised it to you trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother brandom says God told Joshua every place The Souls of your foot Treads upon that I give you so footsteps meant possession so from the very earliest time God said to Abram walk through it amen don't just stand here and look at it don't just talk about it and read about it walk through it Abram I'm teaching you a lesson footsteps mean possession I'm giving it to you but you're only going to get an advantage when you go take it and you might have to fight cuz there's enemies but go take it the advantage Joshua had was the captain of the Lord's host was among them that was an advantage never has an army had that kind of Advantage where they said you're going to have Supernatural power so much so that every enemy will be destroyed and you won't even lose a soldier you won't need a field Hospital you won't need a medic first Army never needed a medic now they end up needing a medic and and a mortician because they failed to keep God's word and 30 some odd of them perished and the after taking Jericho oh a little bitty city AI it was more than 30 men trying to do that see because when you're walking through the land you're not here to just to just you know we're not here to just have so everything oh a little Jubilee there there's Jubilee after the fighting there's Jubilee after the victory say how do I know I have the victory I promise you you'll have the victory if you'll fight the right way see so we find then that we are no wonder we're the children of Abraham today that's part of why because we're walking through the land of the word possessing the Gate of the enemy see so there's Great Value in knowing Christ as a close friend he's The Sovereign ruler of a great Kingdom there's an advantage yeah and knowing a sovereign ruler of a great Kingdom not only is he a sovereign ruler of a great Kingdom but he actually wants to share he wants to share that Kingdom with all of his family and friends he says to his disciples I don't call you servants anymore because a servant doesn't really know what his master's doing the servant doesn't really he's not on the inside he's not privy but but but the master tells his friends things that he would never tell the ser so Jesus said I'm not going to call you servants anymore because I have told you everything my father I've given you the most Insider secrets of the Kingdom say why are you doing that to empower you to believe God like I do that's what that's why Jesus did it see and so he wants to share it with his family and with his friends you know I I I would a lot of lot of times and boy I have to be so careful here so you you you know okay first let me say nobody's done this to me okay and I just had a big family shindig last night they definitely haven't done this to me although we have a running joke about well I going to go into Family Jokes but but let me just say this has not happened to me by anybody uh here today uh or that I can think of but the but the Bible talks about not to weary your neighbor with your often coming see but that's a scripture you know so so there's all there's always balance and so but you know the Lord wants to share his kingdom with his family and with his friends and he wants everybody to come over all the time Rejoice that's an advantage this great Monarch this great king this great Sovereign of this great Kingdom wants everybody to come over come over any time he's always up he doesn't sleep he's never tired you know we have a we have a lot of sayings here in the South they all mean the same thing y'all come see us or sometimes it gets shortened y'all come and people in the north go what does that mean what does that even mean like oh it's I'm sorry it's a southern way of saying come see us you know and so you know so so the a lot of times in the South you know when we'd leave you know friends or family I grew up hearing that kind of language hey y'all come see us and we're we're there now we're just leaving and they're already saying y'all come back you know and so that's kind of a southern way I'm here to tell you that he wants everybody over all the time he doesn't sleep he's always up and and and that means that means that he's instant in season and out of season he but the Bible says he's a very present help in time of trouble now that's great because since since since job has said that a man born of a woman is full of trouble I'm glad he's a present help in trouble I have an advantage because I have a friend in Jesus what a friend we have have in Jesus all our sins and griefs to bear so we find then that Hebrews 13 watch this now Hebrews 135 Paul speaking to his own countrymen the Hebrews Hebrews 13:5 keep your lives uh well that's I've actually got a different translation Noah give me the uh King James version so I'll read it read it from there Hebrews 13:5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so in this translation I have here I don't have it noted which one it is but it says keep your lives free from and there because it says keep your lives free from the Love of Money and be content but I don't want to I just don't I don't want to cabbage down on on the love of money and riches there not there's there's nothing wrong with that per se it's the love of it see it it's trying to get an advantage when actually often times many men James said have pierced themselves through with riches I've seen that happen so many times people who just their Church their Church schedule was so regular their prayer life was so regular they were living in the tape they were always in their Bible they weren't just religious they were spiritual and then a career change come along and the next thing you know they come to church half the time pray about a third of the time read their Bible you hope and maybe hear a tape and you can see the effect in their lives are they God's children yeah but they're not living to the advantage of the word they're piercing themselves through with what they thought was an advantage and it wasn't so so the point is I'm keying on these two words keep your lives free from amen from what anything that makes you have a disadvantage from having the advantage it says he the Love of Money be content with what you have because God has said here's the beauty here's why you can do here's the advantage of letting God orchestrate your life and not chasing the American dream God has said never will I leave you never will I forsake you so what are you chasing what are you running after why are you why are you trying to win the rat race and still be a rat see what a disadvantage what a trick the devil is playing on God's family so I'm here to tell you keep your lives free from free from the things free from the things that are not of the truth tree of life now I I I get I I I certainly get give me First Corinthians 713 bubs 1 Corinthians 7:13 I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 7:31 and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away 1 Corinthians 7:31 I want everybody to read it with me so we're just going wait a second they that use this world as not abusing it the new King James says misusing it same thing and they that use this world as not misusing it for the fashion of this world passes the way I'll leave that there for a second Noah so I'm going to give you two other versions of it I'm going to give you from the ESV and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with the world from the whis translation and those who are making use of this world the things of human existence as not making excessive use of the same for the temporary fashion of this world is passing away so the Bible understands the Apostle Paul understands you live here and it understands that there are items that come from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the tree of knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree of knowledge of good and the tree of knowledge of good the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so we do live here you've got a we've got parking lots on both sides filled with fruit from the Tree of knowledge you understand so he he's not he's not he's not trying to say oh go live in a commune you know just go go go live in the wilderness somewhere but he's saying while you live here yeah you do live here but don't live here like you live here live here like you're passing through here I'm going to tell you something friends this world is not my home I'm just passing through and that informs my thinking of what I chase after and how hard I go after trying to get it see so keep yourselves free from whatever you're chasing in life whatever you have to en encounter in the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil just remember you might use it but don't abuse it or or or could I say it this way don't let it abuse you don't you misuse it and it won't misuse you understand see it for what it is see so there so there's something then to be said uh for not being overly attached to this life there there there's something we're going to go to Colossians 3 no get ready for that Colossians 3 and I'll give you the verses in just in a minute so there's something to be said about not being overly attached to this life you know I could say Holding On Loosely there are things in this life that are dear and precious and there's nothing wrong with holding the things that you love that are wholesome that are to your advantage that are based on the word of God you want to hold on to that very tightly but you just want to live in the world you young people you're in school you're you're going to have careers just understand what Paul is saying this world is passing away amen you can't stay here it's like a house burning down and you're you're sitting stubbornly in your rocking chair and the house is burning down around you and the fireman is in your face screaming you got to get out you can't stay here it's burning down and just bear that in mind friends that you you need to start thinking about there and not so much about here see so Colossians 3 addresses that chapter 3 verses let's read uh verse two set your affection on University and a new job now it's not a Prohibition to University in a new job it's not prohibiting it it's it's asking you where's your heart where are your affections what do you see that as you know it doesn't say you know don't have those things it's asking you where your heart is set your affections on things above not on things of the earth you do live here you do use it but don't misuse it see second Peter uh yeah second Peter brother Noah chapter 3 and we'll catch verses um 11 to 12 is this okay all right second Peter 3: 11 and 12 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved here's a very good question what manner of person are ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening to my next pay raise it's amusing isn't it it's on purpose I'm I'm being amusing on purpose I'm trying to draw contrast trying to get you to actually go wait a minute no it brother Jason didn't say that looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God looking for and hastening so this means this is where your activity is this is where your heart is this is where your mindset is you do live here that's true we when Paul told you know I think it was the I believe uh I want to say the Thessalonian Church how that they you know should live separate from the world they wrote him up they wrote him back because Paul in his second later says now as you wrote unto me asking because you you took off on my comment where I said don't be a part of the world and you wrote back and said Paul what do you mean we have jobs we have careers we're in school we got kids what to go live in a commune and Paul writes back in his second later saying no what I meant was you live in the world but you don't abuse the world you don't you don't you don't let it manipulate you Paul said it like this he said I mean if you were going to obey what I said literally you'd have to go out of the world and some day we're going to go out of this world and but right now right now I'm here right now I'm conquering right now I'm fighting right now right now I'm pressing the mark right now I'm pressing the battle I'm Conquering the enemy see so so Peter just like here Peter is not suggesting you know that we live in fear he talks about hastening under the coming of the day of God and he goes off into some very ominous language he's not suggesting that we live in fear he's trying to get us to understand what a small window of existence this life is amen it is so small so short especially compared to Eternity I've showed you many times we've talked about this recently numerous times about you've got if you've got a promise 70 years that's 3652 weeks you're done so what are you chasing see it's it's just a little over 3600 weeks for 70 years and you're out so this life is like not even that that not even that compared to what's coming so Peter is not trying to get us to live in fear he's trying to get us to understand the that what this life this Fallen life really is because what is your life as we heard uh I believe brother Chris uh preaching here when he was here uh the other service what is your life it's just a vapor it's one little blip on the radar and and and and little more than that yeah no matter how much you think of it it's just little more than a blip on the radar see and so its purpose is singularly for God to fulfill his Plan of Redemption in Saving you and then to express his attributes through you because you're now a born again vessel full of the Holy Spirit and the love of God is shed abroad to the world through youen see amen so First Peter chapter 5 and verse 7 here's a beautiful scripture 1 Peter chap 5 verse S casting all your care upon him for he carth for you that that should be such a comforting scripture to us today you want an advantage how many want an advantage I'm going to give you a life tip cast all your care upon him amen that'll serve you way better than any stock market tip I could give you or any trade I could teach you or any words of wisdom I could say the best thing that you could ever do in this life is find yourself in a position to be friends with God so you can cast your care upon him for he carth for you Psalms 461 Psalms 461 God is our refuge and I want you to notice the two words together God is our refuge and strength see so we go to him for trouble but it's all it's also where we abide because he is not only he's not just here to help you he's here to sustain you see he's our refuge and our strength he's a very present help in trouble so look to him for all things look to him for all things and abide in him it's just like it's just like in marriage when we when we have the vow to have and to hold that's the same thing a refuge and strength it's it's it's it's provision and it's abiding it's to have to hold that's where the whole term of cherishing you've heard me talk about the The Vow that gets broken the soonest is is the vow to cherish and that that a lot of times in marriage ceremonies that word cherish is not even in the vows but it's it's contained in the meaning of to having to hold see so I'm not just marrying this person but this person is going to belong to me and I'm going to belong to them and I'm going to hold on to them and they're going to hold on to me and it's going to sustain me so it's it's an advantage on both sides and you you don't want to to let things happen in a marriage that break that apart say well we're still married yeah but you're at a disadvantage see you're at a disadvantage when you let the things of the world come between you and Christ there's no simpler way to say it you are a you are living in a disadvantage when you do that see so when we read our text today let's go back and take a look at our original text Noah in Proverbs chapter 3 because we're talking about God's guidance and God's wisdom in Proverbs chapter three verse 5 and and six trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding we didn't read that from my text I yeah we read Proverbs right okay we read Proverbs 3 okay correct all right let me get back to my spot here all right so so Pro again Proverbs 35 and 6 trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding and all your ways submit to him and he will make he shall direct thy paths another version says he shall make your paths straight you know this King that we're speaking of this wonderful king of this wonderful Kingdom the Lord Jesus Christ he's very much unlike uh arrogant monarchs that we have seen down through history who tend to make you gravel first and you know uh before you can even approach them you have to gravel and you have to crawl and they do it all just to boost their own ego and their own arrogance you know I I when I read about ancient Kings doing humans that way I just think my goodness if I'd have been standing there I'd have probably lived about two seconds because I would have said what what do you you think like you H you put the breath in your lungs sir you think you can keep it there you think you're in control you think you won't they won't even find a spoonful of your ashes a thousand years from now you know sometimes people just need a reality check I'm sorry but this is what it is if you don't have eternal life your life is just that and then later you're just a spoon of Ashes there's there's there's more material in your grave marker than you amen there there's more material in some of the the things that they put up over people's tombs than the person what good is the person what good was their life if you don't have eternal life life is so beautiful and so wonderful that I mean if I don't get to live for forever then it's like wow invite me to a seven course meal and tell me and let me see it and smell it I don't get to eat it I mean why' I even have life if I don't have eternal life for me friends it's heaven or nothing I'm going all the way I'm serious about this I want to be there I want to live with him forever this life is too short too hard there's too many trials it's not worth it life a man born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble and comes to nothing your life is Vapor a blip on a radar oh but if you have eternal life see so these arrogant Kings you know King Jesus does not require any of that I want to say to you today that he is the kind of King who doesn't need any buttering up he doesn't need any coaxing he doesn't need you to work anything up he doesn't need you to jump up and down and throw dirt in the air to get his attention he's always always awake he's always listening he's always full of love he's always ready to hear a prayer he's all now he's ready he's ready to hear a prayer of repentance amen so so so we find that he's not he's not a pushover I want to say that he's not a pushover he's not right for abuse you've heard me say uh many times maybe if you're a visitor here are listening on the internet you've never heard this my church has heard me say it over the years many many many times you don't he's not Santa Claus he's not Santa so you don't just give him a wish list he's just Santa he's and you've heard me talk about that he he's not Social Services he's not a vending machine he he's not a god of convenience now brother branham's language was he's not a doie grandpa I can't use that one because I am one of those but but God is not like that he's not a doie grandpa he's not a pushover he's he he he Jesus Jesus has a very generous Spirit but he also has a royal heart he knows who he is see he he has a very generous Spirit but he has a royal heart he is a king I realize you know say well the lowly Nazar sure he took the form the Bible says he took the form of a servant and he moved in the earth and he moved while he was in the earth he moved as a lowly Nazarene he did that for a season see but but but he rejects today this King rejects all dictation he's not going to be dictated to he maintains his sovereignty in all action and I'm here to tell the world yes he was a lowely Nazarene yes he took the form of a servant yes he laid his own life down you didn't take it from him but I'm here to tell you he is a king and you're not going to crucify him again you're not going to take up B to Stone him for declaring the true word you're not going to arrest him in a garden because you don't like his teaching those days are over that time is passed and that window is closed Romans 6:9 says knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him I'm here to tell you friends the next time unbelievers stand before him they'll be bowing the knee and they'll be begging for mercy he's a real person he's a real king he's a he he has a real personality listen let let me let me turn change gears and turn a corner and head for the Finish Line I'm running out of time his Humanity when God became a human and walked among us as one of us it gave him it gave him every Advantage you would need see because that he was a real person with real emotions Jesus had tons of emotions he was a human Jesus had tons of feelings he invented them amen so emotions and feelings he invented them he he he was not a robot he was was not he was the Bible says he filled with compassion for the people so he had lots of emotions he had lots of feelings but he but his emotions and his feelings were always in control you've heard me say before that he do he the the the that the Holy Spirit never wakes up on the wrong side of the bed like we do look at your neighbor and say we don't say you say we do men were afraid to do that to their wives but he never wakes up on the wrong side of the bed he never has a bad mood see but here's the ad here's the advantage he's not inhibited in his Relationships by complexes so he's he's never complexed he he could have been he had all kinds of emotions he had all kinds of hurts but but he Jesus human beings have this fantastic ability to to live in the past and feel hurts and pains that are long ago gone humans are amazing at that to live in places of pain and and and disadvantage that are long ago gone and they're still living there bound trapped by that their emotions inhibited they you know I I'm so glad that he's not locked up he's not he's never unable to express his love sometimes that happens in marriages people husbands can't this happened or wife and this happened or people under a certain preacher and this happened let it go let it go I'm here to tell you Jesus already experienced and got the victory on that for you and you can live under the under the blessing under the advantage of Freedom today he's loving he's kind he's full of compassion he has supreme power he Soares of everything the devil ever tries to bring upon him he Soares right over the devil and if you have him in your life so can you in fact is I would say to you today that this is part of the high call calling this is part of the high calling not just to clean your life up and live a Sanctified life but to set your affections which the devil wants to trap up take them off the world and put them up on heaven let go of complexes let go of those pains let go of that stuff you can be free you're Eagles you're meant to soar in the heavens this king is loving he's kind he's full of compassion he even loves The Sinner he loves the people who sin against him and do him dirty and and and and cheat on him he you you think he wasn't there you think he he didn't experience in the Garden of Eden when his very first family betrayed him you think he doesn't know what betrayal feels like he knows what that feels like he knows what Satan he knows what Satan has done to us in the disadvantage of being born in sin Paul deals with that in the Book of Romans Satan took advantage of the law Paul said that which was meant for my good ended up being for my death because Satan went hm okay so they got a law I already know they can't keep it because they're born in sin so I'm going to make it to where every mistake they make I'm going to use it to disqualify them and it was working but I'm here to tell you the beauty of the new birth is is that that Satan can't do that after you're born again because when you're born again he's not accusing you he thinks he's accusing you of making a mistake but because it's no longer you that live it's Christ he's accusing Christ and that don't hold up in court so when God looks at you he doesn't see you he looks at your sacrifice which was Christ which was perfect in the case is dismissed see so so he he knows what Satan tries that you know the I mean the Lord loved us even when we were Sinners and he gave his life for us he gave his life long before you were ever born and trapped up in sin he's so faithful to us he's so faithful that even when Adam and Eve brother brandham deals with this that when when God saw his creation laying face down in in ruin and he said he wouldn't just leave it there I have I'm so glad I'm so glad that when I'm laying on my face in ruin before God he won't leave me laying there he said he went he said he because he's God and he won't be defeated I'm glad I'm so glad CU I get defeated but he's never defeated and he doesn't leave us laying there he he said he went to work immediately building back not just building me up to what I was he's never he's never trying to get me to me he's trying to get me to him he's building back an image in His image oh that's the beauty you talking about it an an advantage that we have he's already made that way at Calvary and the price has already been paid on the cross the earnest young people listen the earnest the deposit is ready to be deposited into your soul that's going to make you a new creation in Christ Jesus he's ready to save to the uttermost he's ready to forgive and to forget every transgression you've ever committed who wants an advantage like that today he's willing to forgive and forget everything you've ever done against him and strike the record off and make you clean what a friend we
