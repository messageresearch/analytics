TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is that we hear the word holiness and we have a reaction right and uh we have to make sure that that reaction is scriptural and many and that's that's in any in any teaching in anything that's what we have to do uh I think there's certain topics that you can look at and say maybe more so for others but it's across the board for anybody you you may have a bad church experience you may have had uh super uh righteous so-called uh people, not really, [clears throat] but that's how we would term it, that are breathing down your throat and constantly trying to force you into their mold and their shape of what they think is the most important things. If you follow these outward things, then you are achieving holiness. And I I think it's it's key from the scripture that we just read that we need to follow we need to pursue holiness. Without that, no one will see the Lord. But without a right understanding of holiness and what that means, how can we pursue it? Amen. 1st Chronicles 16 verse 29. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name. Bring an offering and come before him. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. A lot of uh different translations bring that word beauty and instead of saying beauty, they say splendor. It's an interesting word. If you look up the um history of this word in ancient Hebrew, it's it's very strange. I don't want to get into that. But let's just say that this word splendor or beauty means a whole lot more than what we look at it at just first glance. It speaks of brightness. It speaks of brilliance. It speaks of supremacy. Um, I'll leave it at that. This this holiness, if we don't understand holiness with this added to it, we're mistaken. There's a brightness, there's a brilliance, there's a supremacy, there's a beauty, there's an awesomeness to holiness. Amen. 1 Peter 1 15 and 16. But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation, because it is written, be ye holy, for I am holy. And we can all recall in Isaiah chapter 6 where the cherubims cover their face and cover their feet and they with two more wings they fly. And what is their what is their song that they sing? Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty. The whole earth is full of his glory. Three times holy. It's speaking of he's infinitely holy. So what does holy mean? It simply means to be set apart. Another way you could say to be different. When you talk about for us sanct the the act of making us holy is to be cleansed and set apart for service. But the word holiness is a is a word simply you're set apart for God. But really it it's way more than that. So much more than that. It's that's such a simple statement. Set apart. God is set apart, so you be set apart. What does that look like? I found a couple quotes from writers that I thought express this idea. Well, JC Riyle writes, "Holiness is the habit of being of one mind with God according as we find his mind described in scripture. It's the habit of agreeing in God's judgment, hating what he hates, loving what he loves, and measuring everything in this world by the standard of his word. All right. CS Lewis writes this. If we let him, for we can prevent him if we choose, he will make the feeblest and filthy of us into a dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly, though of course on a smaller scale his own boundless power and delight and goodness. So when God is we see see that God is holy, we're not speaking of something that should make us go, "Oh man, that's boring." You know, holiness is boring. No, holiness, that word holy should strike such an awe in your heart. It's understanding that God is other. He's different than this world. But then don't stop there because he says, "You be the same." Amen. He made you in his image and likeness. That's such a he wants us to express him. Those things become such trit words sometimes. What does that actually mean? Well, we want to have the life of Christ in us. What does that mean? You are going God is shaping you and forming you into a being of splendor. Amen. You yourself are being shaped and he is bringing us to this purpose. And in many ways, you already are that. You're already reflecting that. There is a sinful nature that we're biting fighting against, probably biting against, too. One that we're fighting against and battling against. But in I inside of that, beyond that, there is a being of light and energy and power and wisdom and love that's seeking to break forth from you that is so incredible that if we actually saw ourselves, we might be tempted to fall down and worship. Think about that for a minute. the the incredible glory that he's called us to and what kind of person you're going to be. A person that speaks and everything stops. Why? Because of your connection with him. Before the foundation of the world, he's chosen you. You're a part of his life, a part of his being. something inside of you that down deep down the inside of the inside on the soul. It's there and the new birth comes, the Holy Spirit comes and that life begins to be unleashed and something's going to be born. It's like a It's like a a caterpillar. You look at it, it's it's not beautiful. It It's something that we maybe look at in disdain, but we carry in our minds. That's going to go into a cocoon. Amen. and it's going to come forth as something grand and beautiful that can just lift itself on the wind. And that's what God is doing in us. Ultimately, we're not going to get there until we have that new body, right? But we're at the same time, we're already there by the new birth. You can identify you've heard from your theophony, right? Before the foundation of the world, there's a there's a body that you have that's eternal in the heavens. 2 Corinthians chapter 5, we have a building from God, a housetop not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. And it's a body that's incredibly glorious. And it is radiating the brilliance of God through it. Say, I don't feel that. I don't think that. I don't care what you feel. We're talking about what the word says. That's what God is shaping you into because that's what he created you to be. A perfect reflection. What is a reflection? God looking in the mirror. When he looks in the mirror, that reflection is you. Amen. That is what that is what he's made you to be. So when you think about a holy life, don't just think about, man, I got a lot of rules to follow. I shouldn't have a TV. I shouldn't watch this. I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't do this. It's not a negative that we're trying to express. It's a positive that God is trying to manifest through us. And let that positive life dictate and direct how you live. That's what between what J uh CS Lewis is saying and what JC Riyle is saying, you'll get the picture. This is not a drudgery. To be holy is not a drudgery. Amen. It it's it's not a list of rules. It's who you who he makes you to be. I want to be careful and make that distinction. It's not merely who you are because we can look at that and see our own sinfulness, our own weakness, but it's who he has designed us to be. We fell. That's what redemption was for. That's why Christ came and shed his blood to restore us back to the original purpose God had in making us. to make us beings of light and splendor and glory and power. Go God has called us to live a holy life. This kind of life, like I said, it's not a negative, it's a positive. It's not drudgery. It's not continual sorrow. It's joy in the midst of trials and troubles and pain. I don't know who I was speaking to, [snorts] brother Brad, I think it was, yesterday about joy. Joy is is is like something that you can't really grab your grab a hold of. It's something that God brings into your life. [snorts] It's not happiness because you can have joy when there's tears coming out of your eyes. Amen. When you're feeling great pain and you're suffering and dealing with with heartache, you can feel joy. What is it? I don't know what it is. [snorts] It's the presence of God. It's his love. It's something that sweeps over you that you say, "I want to live in this eternally. I don't ever want to leave this thing." Amen. And God says, "But you can only have it in part now. You're going to have it in fullness when you come over here with me. But I'm giving you a foretaste. We've all had that experience where you see something or you experience something or you're in a place in nature and joy comes over you. You I I don't maybe you haven't, but I've had it where I've been so sorrowful and in pain and suffering over something that I'm going through and the joy of the Lord sweeps over and tears come and thankfulness and gratefulness come over me. That's joy. That and holiness is much like that. Holiness is not a mere feeling. It's not based on how you feel, but it's him sweeping over you and using you and moving through you and shaping his life in you. It's it's you and yet it's other than you. It's different. It's distinct from you. This isn't a life that says, you know, the the the the the new age movement is out there trying to mimic with false teaching what the Bible teaches about who we are. You're gods. You're you just have to recognize that spark of life of who you are. But what is it? It's all pride. It's self- pride. There's no room for that. A person who is truly holy is humble. He recognizes that this is not of himself. This is from God to us as a great gift. So real and real recognition of the power of who we are in him would lead us to a life of self-examination before God's throne. wouldn't leave us to justify ourselves. Well, I'm th I'm this, so I can live any way I want. You can, but you better be careful because the any way you want will express what life source you're coming from. Amen. The life that he places in us is a life that is so earnestly and continually desiring and and and and like a a mother giving birth, seeking that kind of life to be birthed in us on a daily basis. A life that follows hard after the word to be cleansed from all worldliness from all ungodliness anything contrary to the message that would be the heart's desire of this holy person. Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." You can get this verse and you could say, "What a hard pill to swallow. What a bitter root to chew on. Take up your cross. deny myself, follow me. But for a believer who is participating in the life of Jesus, this isn't a bitter root. It's not a hard pill to swallow. Is it difficult? Is it all life consuming? Absolutely. But it's not a hard pill to swallow. It's our great delight. It's our joy. It's our passion. That's the root of holiness. We're we've forsaken everything to follow Jesus. We have seen a person, not a set of rules, not a set of facts. We have met a person and he's sh displayed himself to us and revealed himself to us personally and that we desire to give everything of ourselves to him. everything that we have need of. And he is infinitely worthy of our worship and submission. So we with delight forsake all to follow him. We're set apart from this world unto Jesus. A person, not a set of rules, not a lifestyle to live, not the message doctrine. We're set aside to live for a person. Amen. We're not pursuing holiness as an end in itself. We are pursuing a person that loves us beyond all measure. That has called us to forsake all and that he himself has forsaken all himself in order to win us in order to save us. And so this is beyond so far beyond holiness is not a set of rules. It's not well if I if my dress my if my skirt is so long well let's debate about it. How long long should your skirt be? That's not what this is. This is a life of holiness. This is being set apart to a person and he leads and he guides and he teaches and he show he shows you and he convicts you. Are we are we so dull that we're seeking after living a life of rules and not offending people. That's what our desire and our greatest passion is. Not offending people. Come on, get saved. Get saved. Meet Jesus. It's not about following a set of rules. It's about living your life the for the mo the loveliest, most awesome, incredible person in the world. Psalm 63. Look at David. This is not a life of drudgery to a set of rules. Oh God, thou art my God. Early will I seek thee. This is this is what's birthed in a believer that's [snorts] seeking after holiness. Amen. Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsts for thee. My flesh longs for thee. In a dry and thirsty land where no water is. One pursuit. One desire. Not six, not two, not three. When you're looking for water, you're not worried about if the mortgage is going to be paid. You're not worried about anything besides one thing, and that's I'm seeking for water. If I don't get water, I'm dead. Okay? This is David's heart towards God. God, I'm looking for you. My longing is for you. My one great passion is for you. For what? Verse two. To see thy power and thy glory. So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary, a living God. A true and living God. Not a statue, not an idol, not a mental conception, but he's looking for a living, manifested God. Verse three, because thy loving kindness is better than life. my lips shall praise thee. So this is the reason for his pursuit. That is the reason for David's pursuit is because God's love and kindness is better than this human life. All the things that we have in it, the good times, the bad times, the suffering, the thing that everybody's trying to avoid is dying, right? They're try they're trying to stay alive. They're pursuing staying alive. A and David says, you know what? God's love is better than that. Amen. Amen. And he says, my lips shall praise thee. Verse four, thus will I bless thee while I live. I will lift up my hands in thy name. This is seeking a life of holiness, right? This this is this is a heart set on fire and passion for God. That's what seeking a life of holiness is. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips. Amen. So if you're if you're if you're having a if you're you're eating a diet that's low in fat, your soul won't be satisfied. Your flesh won't be satisfied. So we want to be as Christians, we want to be eating marrow and fatness, something that has sustains and strengthens life. Amen. Joyful lips. Amen. Joy. Think about what I mentioned before about joy. The importance of that. Seeking after joy. Seeking after joy is what? Seeking after God. You can't create joy in yourself. God does that inside of you. When I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches my because thou has been my help. Therefore in the shadow of thy wings in your presence will I rejoice. My soul follows hard after thee. Thy right hand upholdeth the me. So he says early will I seek thee. And then he says in my on my bed and in the night watches will I meditate. This is someone who is continuously all day seeking after God. Amen. You know, we we can claim I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't curse. I I I I I don't wear makeup, sisters. I don't cut my hair. Uh you can go on and on over the list of things that you don't do. A and those things can then become matters of pride, self-ride, self-justification. I don't do this, I don't do that, therefore I'm okay. This is not the kind of life of holiness that God's calling us to. Again, that's the ne that's looking at the negative. Looking at the negative that we're avoiding is pride. The purpose of God is not for us to avoid things. Amen. He's not coming and saying, "Hey, I want you guys to be miserable. I want you to have a horrible life because you have to avoid everything." No, he's asking us and telling us, "Find your joy in me. Recognize who I am and recognize that I'm trying to make you like me." And there's a transforming power. And of course, God has a standard. God has a law. God has God has many things in the New Testament that he tells you if you do this, you're not going to the kingdom of God. But again, this is not to be pursued like the Jews pursued the law. Too many times this happens in Christian circles because we know the standard then the standard then becomes a law and it becomes follow this do this do this do this and I'm okay with everybody but are you okay with God? That's what's most important. Why are we looking at are we okay with everybody? Just go find a movement where you can be everything's okay if that's your attitude. We're we're looking and seeking after God. Amen. That's the purpose. And and the the things that are written are written by by Paul and the apostles to to demonstrate this is the kind of life that Christ lives through his people. Yeah. This is the kind of holiness that comes into a person from God and is manifested in their life. So therefore, you could see if this is happening and this is happening and this is happening, it shows that Christ is not in you. Amen. Right? That's that's the vision that God has for his people in this day. It's not a list and set of rules. The standard has been restored by the word. We know the standard. I'm not up here telling you we don't need a standard. What I'm telling you is if you don't pursue it right, you're not experiencing God's salvation. God's salvation is his spirit coming and living in you. You'll find quotes. Brother Brandham says, "None of us are holy. It's the Holy Spirit living inside of us and changing us and making us into that that that that son or daughter that God had in his mind before the very foundation of the world. Amen. All right, I'm out of time. Let's stand and pray. Gracious Father, we come to you now, Lord, and our desire is to enter into the vision that you had of us before the foundation of the world, Lord, that we would be holy even as you are holy, and that we would see what that the beauty and grandeur and majesty of what holiness really is. and that you are seeking to place those same uh uh titles and attributes upon us and in us and through our lives. Help us to enter into that vision, Lord, of the word. Let us lay aside the things that are trying to beset us and and and pull us aside. Let us not look to the negative and see I'm not doing this. I'm not doing that. But let us look to you and say, Lord, bring bring your life in me more and more that I would be an expression of of your holiness. Lord, we will commit ourselves, we commit the service, commit each one into your hands. Use us for your glory. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
