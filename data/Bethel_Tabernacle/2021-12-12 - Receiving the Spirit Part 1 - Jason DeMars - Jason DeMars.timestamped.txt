[4:02] [Music]
[4:12] god bless you let's stand and pray
[4:17] gracious heavenly father we come before
[4:19] you now lord and we're so thankful for
[4:21] your goodness and mercy in this hour
[4:22] lord
[4:24] we understand it's
[4:25] satan's eden
[4:28] there's a there's a darkness
[4:31] pressing in lord
[4:33] in this age
[4:35] and yet
[4:36] while all that's happening lord you've
[4:38] called a bride and you're pressing
[4:41] her into light
[4:43] and we're so thankful for that lord we
[4:45] know
[4:46] as the scripture said what whatsoever
[4:48] doth make manifests is light
[4:51] lord and the bride is to be the
[4:52] manifestation of this hour
[4:55] lord i pray you help us to that end lord
[4:57] we have
[4:58] believe we're still here because we have
[5:00] more to surrender
[5:02] more to grow into to mature into lord
[5:04] help us to do that father help us to lay
[5:07] aside the things lord that are coming
[5:10] against us and
[5:12] and that
[5:13] we're allowing
[5:15] to have half place lord help us to fight
[5:18] help us to engage in the spiritual
[5:19] warfare that's taking place in this day
[5:22] we thank you for your goodness and mercy
[5:24] lord be with us this morning bless the
[5:26] word as it comes forth
[5:28] bless the hearers as they hear lord may
[5:30] you be glorified in it all we ask in
[5:32] jesus name
[5:34] amen
[5:35] i'm going to go on to a
[5:37] new subject this time
[5:40] receiving the spirit
[5:42] and the first scripture i want to look
[5:44] at is john 3 verse 3.
[5:55] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[5:57] merely i say unto thee except a man be
[6:00] born again
[6:02] he cannot see the kingdom of god may the
[6:05] lord have the blessing to the reading of
[6:06] his word he can be seated
[6:12] specifically i want to look at
[6:15] um
[6:17] is is the look at the biblical evidence
[6:22] is the baptism the holy ghost a
[6:23] different act than the new birth or is
[6:25] it the same thing
[6:28] and then the neck and the next part of
[6:29] that is how did
[6:31] let's look in the scripture and how did
[6:32] they receive the holy spirit
[6:34] because how they received it god in
[6:36] action in the book of acts should be the
[6:38] same way that we receive it in in our
[6:41] day and age because he's the same
[6:42] yesterday today and forever
[6:44] and when god makes a promise he can't go
[6:46] back on his promise but that works in
[6:48] one way these are message principles
[6:51] that we've gotten god works in one way
[6:54] to start the age he has to finish the
[6:56] age working the same way
[6:57] now that there's different dispensations
[6:59] there's different ways
[7:01] god dealt with abraham differently than
[7:03] he dealt with the children of israel
[7:05] right under the dispensation of the law
[7:07] before the law the children of israel
[7:10] were dealt with differently until the
[7:11] law was given and they accepted it and
[7:13] god dealt with them differently that's
[7:16] the old covenant then a new covenant
[7:18] comes he dealt with adam and eve
[7:19] differently than he dealt with
[7:21] their their generation after that
[7:24] right
[7:25] each dispensation seven dispensations of
[7:28] time
[7:29] you know we're in the sixth one right
[7:31] now seventh one is coming we're looking
[7:33] forward to that millennium amen
[7:35] and so we're thankful for the word in
[7:37] this day to clarify all these things i
[7:39] think we all know the answers to the
[7:41] questions i post but i think it's good
[7:43] to go into the scriptures and look and
[7:45] see
[7:46] how does it speak of it so the first one
[7:48] we see
[7:49] where the man says this is jesus first
[7:51] doctrine
[7:52] is the new birth except a man be born
[7:55] again
[7:56] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[7:59] brothers it's in the reason why it's
[8:00] coming like that is it's in presenter
[8:02] view so you got to go up into the
[8:04] settings and change that
[8:07] all right
[8:09] so read the
[8:10] context to that we read verse 3 we'll
[8:13] read verse 5 and 6 as well in john
[8:15] chapter 3
[8:16] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[8:19] thee
[8:20] except a man be born of water
[8:23] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[8:26] the kingdom of god
[8:28] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[8:31] that which is born of the spirit is
[8:34] spirit amen
[8:37] matthew 3 11 i'm i'm just going to go
[8:39] quickly over a bunch of different
[8:40] scriptures in the new testament
[8:43] and just pose that question the question
[8:45] again
[8:46] um
[8:47] matthew 3 11 i indeed baptize you with
[8:50] water under repentance but he that
[8:51] cometh after me
[8:53] is mightier than i whose shoes i am not
[8:55] worthy to bear
[8:56] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[8:59] and with fire
[9:02] so
[9:04] if you look
[9:05] if if you're not aware there's there's
[9:09] i would probably say most
[9:11] reformers
[9:12] believe that
[9:14] in the old testament
[9:16] there were certain disciples and and or
[9:19] certain
[9:21] certain heroes of the faith
[9:23] that were born again
[9:26] so they believed that the new birth was
[9:27] in effect
[9:29] during the old testament
[9:32] and then in the when the new covenant
[9:34] comes something new came
[9:36] but it was
[9:37] more perfect because it was through the
[9:39] blood
[9:40] so that basically
[9:42] is there evidence even even if you look
[9:44] at um
[9:46] not one is pentecostals but assemblies
[9:48] of god and charismatic they believe that
[9:51] the new birth comes when you believe
[9:54] and then the baptism of the holy ghost
[9:56] comes when you speak with tongues
[9:58] so there are two separate
[10:00] distinct acts and so you look at that
[10:02] and they say
[10:04] in the old testament they were born
[10:06] again but they didn't receive the
[10:07] baptism of the holy spirit
[10:09] the new thing was the baptism of the
[10:11] holy spirit
[10:12] all right
[10:14] so is there evidence
[10:16] to demonstrate that there's a few
[10:18] scriptures but i think the overarching
[10:21] theme will prove that out
[10:24] numbers 14 24 but my servant caleb
[10:27] because he had another spirit with him
[10:30] and and followed me fully him will i
[10:33] bring into the land wherein he went and
[10:35] his seed
[10:37] shall possess it
[10:39] so that's the first one that is
[10:40] typically brought up he had another
[10:42] spirit with him there's therefore he
[10:44] must be
[10:45] born again
[10:46] okay
[10:47] it doesn't say that number one that's
[10:50] that's a big that's a huge leap
[10:52] to say
[10:53] caleb was born again
[10:55] it doesn't say that it said there was
[10:56] another spirit with him
[10:58] and that's absolutely the teaching of
[11:00] scripture that the great heroes of the
[11:02] faith had the holy spirit
[11:04] upon them
[11:06] they were anointed with the holy spirit
[11:09] all right
[11:11] deuteronomy 10
[11:13] 16
[11:15] says circumcise therefore
[11:18] the foreskin of your heart and be no
[11:20] more
[11:21] stiff net
[11:23] so notice that scripture
[11:25] he says
[11:27] to the children of israel
[11:29] circumcise therefore the foreskin heart
[11:32] in other words you do it
[11:34] you do you circumcise yourself
[11:38] did they do it
[11:41] could they do it
[11:43] well that wasn't fair that god says that
[11:45] they were supposed to do it they're
[11:47] unable to do it many many times god
[11:49] tells his people to do something
[11:52] in order to just illustrate the point
[11:54] you're unable
[11:57] they can't circumcise their own heart
[11:59] can you circumcise your heart
[12:02] well if you reinterpret it to mean one
[12:04] dedicated rededicating my heart
[12:06] rededicating my life if you take it to
[12:08] mean that sure you can
[12:10] but the reality is this is a cutting
[12:13] cutting when you certain circumcision
[12:15] something is cut away
[12:17] can you change your nature
[12:21] can you change your disposition
[12:25] you can change your disposition a little
[12:26] bit but usually what happens is you go
[12:29] right back
[12:31] you go right back
[12:32] so this is talking about something that
[12:34] is a permanent change change your heart
[12:37] stop being stiff-necked can you do that
[12:40] in your own power
[12:41] does scripture teach us that we can do
[12:43] that in our own power
[12:44] absolutely not
[12:46] deuteronomy 30 verse 5 and 6
[12:50] and the lord thy god will bring thee
[12:53] into the land which thy father has
[12:54] possessed
[12:55] and thou shalt possess it
[12:58] and he will do the good and multiply
[13:00] thee above thy fathers
[13:02] now now notice verse six and the lord
[13:04] got thy god
[13:07] will circumcise thine heart and the
[13:09] heart of thy seed
[13:11] to love the lord thy god with all thy
[13:13] heart and with all thy soul that thou
[13:16] may live so there's two different things
[13:19] you circumcise your heart and now here's
[13:21] a promise
[13:22] that god says i will circumcise
[13:25] your heart so that you will love me
[13:28] amen
[13:30] all right so there's two two separate
[13:31] things there's a there's a command to do
[13:34] it you do it
[13:35] that's the old testament right
[13:38] you have to live by the law
[13:40] you have to do it within your own power
[13:42] i want to ask a question
[13:45] we find any old testament
[13:47] king
[13:48] patriarch prophet
[13:51] who lived a hundred percent by the word
[13:54] he never could
[13:57] they never could
[13:59] one of the greatest
[14:00] men of god of the old testament was
[14:02] david
[14:04] and look at his life
[14:06] thank god he lived by grace
[14:10] they lived
[14:11] there for god's elect there's grace
[14:14] right
[14:16] there was a sacrifice that they made
[14:20] but the reality is the blood of bulls
[14:22] and goats could never take away sins
[14:25] so the old covenant
[14:27] was something
[14:28] that was simply demonstrating this is
[14:30] your need
[14:32] that's the reality is
[14:34] it says
[14:35] that it was the new covenant is a better
[14:39] covenant
[14:42] what
[14:47] the fault isn't with the old covenant
[14:49] the fault is with the people
[14:51] following the old covenant and i think
[14:53] that's isn't that the point
[14:56] by the law is the knowledge of
[14:58] sin
[15:00] there's no new birth in the law
[15:02] there's no changed heart in the law
[15:04] there's no transformation in the law
[15:06] there was there was
[15:08] grace provided a sacrifice which just
[15:11] pushed forward the sin
[15:13] pushed forward the sin it was always a
[15:16] remembrance always remembering this
[15:18] joint it doesn't actually take away
[15:21] it just pushes it forward what does it
[15:22] push it forward
[15:24] if there's a if there's a sincere heart
[15:27] a repentant heart
[15:29] along with that sacrifice it pushed it
[15:31] forward towards the blood of jesus
[15:33] christ
[15:38] ezekiel 36 26 and 27
[15:43] a new heart also will i give you and a
[15:45] new spirit will i put within you and i
[15:47] will take away the stony heart
[15:49] out of your flesh and i will give you a
[15:51] heart of flesh
[15:53] and i will put my spirit within you and
[15:55] cause you to walk in my statutes
[15:57] and you
[16:53] although i was a husband unto them saith
[16:55] the lord it's the new covenant is not
[16:58] like the old covenant it's a different
[17:00] covenant
[17:01] how is it different verse 33 but this
[17:04] shall be
[17:05] the covenant that i will make with the
[17:07] house of israel after those days saith
[17:09] the lord
[17:10] i will put my law
[17:12] in their inward parts it's not just
[17:14] written on tables of stone and say you
[17:15] must obey them but he's going to take
[17:18] that law and by the holy spirit write
[17:21] that law in their hearts
[17:23] and he says and and i will write it in
[17:25] their hearts and will be their god
[17:28] and they shall be
[17:29] my people
[17:32] again
[17:33] covenant
[17:35] it's not an old covenant reworked over
[17:38] it's a new covenant where he takes
[17:41] god's laws in the old testament you take
[17:43] the ten commandments that's an
[17:44] expression of god's heart
[17:47] expression of god's nature
[17:49] okay so he takes those laws
[17:52] and he writes them on the inside of our
[17:54] hearts so what does he do
[17:56] we read that i'll give you a new heart a
[17:58] new spirit and i'll put my spirit inside
[18:02] of you so how does he write his law in
[18:04] our hearts by changing our heart
[18:06] changing our spirit
[18:08] changing and giving us his spirit a new
[18:11] a new nature
[18:12] inside of us his nature inside of us
[18:15] the old testament didn't give you access
[18:18] to that
[18:19] yes there was access to grace
[18:21] but not access to a new heart
[18:24] a new spirit
[18:26] and his spirit
[18:27] there was an anointing
[18:29] that but it didn't change the heart
[18:35] again
[18:37] why a new covenant
[18:39] if caleb and other jewish heroes were
[18:41] already born again
[18:43] why the future promise of circumcising
[18:46] the hearts and the minds if they already
[18:49] were
[18:50] circumcised in heart and mind
[18:54] it doesn't make sense does it
[18:56] there's a future promise that he makes
[18:59] that they did not have access to in the
[19:01] old testament
[19:02] what did they have access to in the old
[19:04] testament they were elect they were the
[19:06] seed of god they had a seed in their
[19:08] heart
[19:08] but they couldn't perfectly follow the
[19:10] law
[19:12] they couldn't they couldn't they
[19:14] couldn't walk in a new nature
[19:17] they didn't have access to that
[19:19] that's what jesus promises you must be
[19:22] born again there's one coming after me
[19:25] who will baptize you with the holy ghost
[19:27] and with fire
[19:29] so looking at the gospel in action
[19:32] does peter
[19:33] or paul speak of two different
[19:36] works of the spirit one in the new birth
[19:39] and one in the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:41] does peter offer that on the day of
[19:43] pentecost
[19:46] no
[19:48] no he sure doesn't
[19:49] for by one spirit first corinthians 12
[19:52] 13
[19:53] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[19:55] into one body
[19:57] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[19:59] we be bond or free and have been all
[20:00] made to drink into one spirit so can you
[20:04] be
[20:04] born again and not a part of the body of
[20:07] christ
[20:10] because here it's saying it's the
[20:11] baptism of the holy spirit that puts you
[20:14] as a part of the body of christ if
[20:16] that's a separate act from the new birth
[20:18] then yeah you can be born again and not
[20:20] a part of the body of christ does it
[20:22] make any sense
[20:23] it doesn't make sense
[20:28] acts 2 33 says therefore being by the
[20:31] right hand of god exalted and have
[20:34] having received of the father the
[20:36] promise of the holy ghost
[20:38] he hath shed forth
[20:40] this which you
[20:42] now see and
[20:45] hear
[20:46] so again
[20:47] it's saying jesus
[20:49] received from the father in other words
[20:51] the prophecies of the old testament
[20:54] jesus received the explanation the
[20:56] revelation of what those are and he was
[20:58] going to bring them forth upon the
[21:00] people through his death burial
[21:02] resurrection ascension
[21:04] to be the mediator of a new covenant
[21:07] now he is shedding forth what you see
[21:09] what did they see
[21:10] a bunch of people
[21:12] speaking in another language
[21:15] that was their language
[21:18] so they they saw the promise of the holy
[21:20] ghost
[21:24] acts 2 37-38 now when they heard this
[21:28] they heard the gospel preached by peter
[21:31] when they heard this they were pricked
[21:33] in their heart and said unto peter and
[21:35] to the rest of the apostles men and
[21:36] brethren
[21:37] what shall we do then peter said unto
[21:39] them
[21:40] believe and be born again and then go on
[21:42] and receive the holy ghost and speak in
[21:43] tongues
[21:47] then peter said unto them repent
[21:49] so repent
[21:51] so they already believed they wouldn't
[21:53] have asked the question if they didn't
[21:54] believe
[21:55] so they already believed
[21:56] then peter said unto them repent and be
[21:58] baptized
[22:00] speaking of water baptism every one of
[22:02] you in the name of jesus christ for the
[22:04] remission of sins and you shall receive
[22:06] the gift of the holy ghost that which
[22:08] that was shed forth
[22:11] through jesus
[22:12] that they saw and witnessed
[22:15] now peter's saying this is how you get
[22:17] what we got
[22:19] repent and be baptized in the name of
[22:21] jesus christ and the promise is to you
[22:24] to receive that gift of the holy ghost
[22:27] he's not talking about three different
[22:29] two different acts of the spirit he's
[22:31] talking about receiving
[22:33] the holy spirit that's what the new
[22:34] birth is
[22:36] it's being born of the spirit it's being
[22:38] baptized in the spirit it's the new
[22:40] testament talks about it in many
[22:42] different ways
[22:43] many ways that this one act in our lives
[22:47] is described
[22:50] acts 8
[22:51] 14-17
[22:53] now when the apostles which were at
[22:55] jerusalem heard that samaria i want you
[22:58] to notice also
[23:00] the first one was to jews
[23:03] right so he's preaching to jews
[23:06] they heard the message that was preached
[23:09] but the spirit didn't fall on them did
[23:11] it
[23:12] they heard it they said what should we
[23:14] do
[23:15] and peter gave them the prescription of
[23:17] what to do
[23:19] now when the apostles which are at
[23:20] jerusalem heard that samaria had
[23:23] received the word of god so they they
[23:25] believed the word
[23:27] they sent unto them peter and john
[23:30] who when they were come down prayed for
[23:32] them that they might receive the holy
[23:34] ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none
[23:36] of them
[23:37] only they were baptized in the name of
[23:39] the lord jesus
[23:41] then laid they their hands on them and
[23:43] they received
[23:44] the holy ghost
[23:46] now we don't want to think we don't want
[23:48] to look at this and say god only works
[23:52] like acts 2 38.
[23:54] we don't have a perfect formula every
[23:56] single time
[23:58] it's different
[23:59] for samaria
[24:00] they heard it they were baptized
[24:03] they didn't receive the holy ghost right
[24:05] away until those apostles came it laid
[24:07] hands on them
[24:09] another what am i trying to say is it's
[24:11] not a cookie cutter
[24:12] same every time
[24:14] it's different in each of these
[24:15] situations
[24:18] acts 9 17
[24:22] this is the gentiles and ananias went
[24:24] his way and entered excuse me this is
[24:26] paul
[24:27] ananias went his way and entered into
[24:29] the house and putting his hands on him
[24:31] said brother saul
[24:32] the lord even jesus that appeared unto
[24:34] thee in the way that thou camest has
[24:36] sent me
[24:37] that thou mightest receive thy sight and
[24:39] be filled with the holy ghost so here's
[24:41] paul
[24:43] he meets jesus
[24:44] he struck blind
[24:46] he believes the message that he heard
[24:50] then ananias comes lays hand on on him
[24:52] he receives the holy ghost after that
[24:55] he gets baptized
[25:05] acts 10 44 and 45 while peter yet spake
[25:09] these words the holy ghost fell on all
[25:11] them this is the gentiles
[25:13] the holy ghost fell on all them which
[25:15] heard the word
[25:16] and they of the circumcision which
[25:18] believed were astonished as many as came
[25:20] with peter because that on the gentiles
[25:22] also was poured out the gift of the holy
[25:25] ghost now here's believers who received
[25:27] the holy ghost while they were listening
[25:29] to
[25:30] the message that was preached they
[25:32] believed in their heart and it dropped
[25:34] right in to them
[25:36] amen so it it isn't a cookie cutter the
[25:39] way god gives you the holy ghost
[25:41] every person's journey is different
[25:44] experience is different but it is an
[25:45] experience
[25:47] that you have to have with god it isn't
[25:48] merely saying i believe the message
[25:52] you hear that today that the token is
[25:54] just believing the message
[25:56] why did brother branham say
[26:00] you say i believe the message that's
[26:01] just being able to read
[26:03] you must have the token why because it's
[26:05] an experience
[26:07] a person can believe the message
[26:09] intellectually
[26:11] and fall away from the message
[26:13] right but if you believe the message
[26:16] and god then you have an experience with
[26:18] god and he gives you the holy ghost
[26:20] you're not going to fall away
[26:22] you're not you're not gonna go by the
[26:24] wayside
[26:25] it's two different things
[26:27] the token is not the tapes
[26:30] the token is not merely believing the
[26:32] message
[26:33] the evidence of the holy ghost
[26:35] you know we talk about this terminology
[26:37] the initial evidence
[26:40] can someone find me in scripture the
[26:42] term initial evidence
[26:46] it's not in there
[26:48] it's not in there
[26:49] what what is the ongoing evidence
[26:54] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[26:56] will guide you into all truth
[26:58] all right it's guiding you into all
[27:00] truth
[27:01] my my personal experience from the lord
[27:05] was
[27:07] i was
[27:08] i heard the gospel i
[27:11] believed it
[27:12] i wasn't living it
[27:14] all right
[27:15] there was a time my friends were
[27:17] confronting me and talking to me and i
[27:18] just eventually said lord i i just want
[27:21] i'm so tired of this i just want to live
[27:23] for you
[27:24] and he changed my heart he filled me
[27:26] with the holy spirit
[27:28] and my whole every desire changed
[27:31] and then
[27:32] little by little god started showing me
[27:35] doctrines of the message before i ever
[27:37] heard the message
[27:39] and then
[27:41] somebody
[27:42] my friends who led me to the lord
[27:44] introduced me to
[27:46] another guy who who introduced me to the
[27:48] message
[27:49] and after four or five months i accepted
[27:52] it was from god
[27:53] but that holy spirit that i received
[27:56] what did it do it it was the spirit of
[27:58] truth that led me into all truth
[28:01] he was leading me from into truth from
[28:03] the beginning from the very minute even
[28:05] though i knew nothing
[28:07] about the prophet about brother branham
[28:09] but god led me to
[28:11] the message
[28:13] that's the spirit of truth
[28:15] that's the quote unquote evidence of the
[28:17] holy spirit
[28:19] but it's not it's not really evidence
[28:21] for you and i to say
[28:23] look on the outside and say oh brad has
[28:25] the holy spirit
[28:26] because he has the evidence and i see
[28:28] this
[28:29] you could have said that about many of
[28:30] the people that left the message
[28:33] the evidence is not like that it's not a
[28:35] pentecostal thing
[28:38] it's not it's not a
[28:40] initial evidence oh praise god he
[28:42] believes the message he has the initial
[28:43] evidence of the holy ghost
[28:45] where does brother branham say that
[28:48] see our concepts
[28:50] the way we look at things planted there
[28:52] from a denominational way of thinking
[28:55] that's not how that's not how the word
[28:57] of god speaks it that's what brother
[28:58] branham
[28:59] was trying to change us from that
[29:01] mentality
[29:03] and again it's a balance what's the
[29:05] what's the evidence that the spirit of
[29:07] truth leads you into all truth which
[29:08] means you're believing the message
[29:11] but it's not merely that because you can
[29:13] believe the message and not have the
[29:15] holy ghost
[29:16] you say hey you're talking in double
[29:17] speak
[29:18] no
[29:20] no that spirit of truth inside of you
[29:22] guides you into all truth
[29:24] let's ask another question how many of
[29:26] you believe the message the teachings of
[29:29] the message exactly the same way you do
[29:31] 25 years ago
[29:34] 20 years ago 15 years ago 10
[29:37] why because the holy spirit is teaching
[29:40] us
[29:41] is correcting us there's a five-fold
[29:43] ministry
[29:44] people people when they first
[29:47] received the message in the 60s 65
[29:52] they
[29:53] heard about serpent seed water baptism
[29:55] and there's a prophet and we're not
[29:56] trinitarians
[29:58] how much more did they understand
[30:01] not much more
[30:03] how much more do we understand than that
[30:04] we would consider that baby
[30:06] stuff
[30:09] why are you just staying on that baby
[30:10] stuff
[30:11] we've got strong meat now it was all
[30:13] there in 1965 nobody had any clue what
[30:16] the prophet was saying
[30:18] and he knew that
[30:20] he spoke to his son and said do you
[30:21] understand what i said yes sir no you
[30:23] didn't
[30:27] it wasn't for that hour but it was
[30:29] laying something down brother branham
[30:31] said that i hope
[30:32] these men that come after me will pick
[30:35] this up and make more sense to it
[30:39] amen we thank the lord for fivefold
[30:41] ministry that would break open the word
[30:44] it isn't merely just pressing the tape
[30:46] we've got to understand the revelations
[30:48] that are contained in the tape
[30:50] the tape's a wonderful thing the books
[30:53] are a wonderful thing
[30:54] but it doesn't do any good sitting on a
[30:56] tape in a book this isn't a catholic
[30:59] religion
[31:00] this is a living god living inside of
[31:03] living people
[31:04] that's what the holy ghost is given for
[31:06] amen let's stand and pray
[31:11] gracious father we thank you so much for
[31:13] this beautiful balanced word that you've
[31:15] given to us in this hour
[31:17] lord help us to live it walk in it
[31:19] help us to glorify you with our lives
[31:21] lord forgive us of our sins
[31:24] cleanse our hearts and minds from from
[31:27] wickedness lord we want to be more like
[31:29] jesus christ
[31:31] every day father
[31:32] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[31:35] god bless you
