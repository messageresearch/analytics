[0:00] gracious Heavenly Father we come before
[0:01] you Lord and we ask that your Holy
[0:03] Spirit would just take control of the
[0:04] Sunday school this morning I pray Lord
[0:07] that you'd take your word and write it
[0:08] upon our hearts father we commit
[0:10] ourselves and Commit This Time To You
[0:12] For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen
[0:15] God bless you can be seated we're going
[0:18] to continue with the subject of the
[0:20] truth about our future home it's part
[0:23] five if you want to bring up the
[0:24] PowerPoint for
[0:26] me first scripture we're going to look
[0:28] at is in Psalms
[0:33] 37:1 and read that but the meek shall
[0:36] inherit the earth and shall Delight
[0:38] themselves in the abundance of
[0:42] Peace the truth is that an unearthly
[0:46] Heaven is not our future home but Heaven
[0:50] and Earth United together again will be
[0:53] our future home we are destined
[0:56] predestined to inherit this Earth God
[1:00] created the Earth he put us on it to
[1:02] have dominion over it this was his
[1:05] original plan original intention Satan
[1:09] came in mixed himself this is where the
[1:11] Plan of Redemption comes but the the
[1:13] plan has not changed it's just the plan
[1:16] has become restoration back to the
[1:19] original in a multiplied form with God's
[1:22] attributes fully on
[1:24] display God intends to show his glory on
[1:28] this very planet
[1:30] Earth he plans on redeeming it
[1:39] completely brother brandom says in
[1:41] future home no beasts will be there to
[1:44] destroy you again when you walk down the
[1:47] road in the flower gardens there will
[1:48] not be any serpent there to hiss at you
[1:50] and bite you with his poison Venom oh my
[1:52] won't it be wonderful listen there will
[1:54] be none of that new Earth ever mounted
[1:57] up to a little yellow sod bank for a
[1:59] grave be none of them there man and God
[2:03] Has Come Together bride and bridegroom
[2:04] Heaven and Earth heavens and earth
[2:07] embraced each other God has come down to
[2:09] dwell among men his Tabernacle is with
[2:13] them there will be no more sin no more
[2:15] sorrow never will there ever be a tear
[2:18] drop off of a mother's cheek over her
[2:20] baby amen it won't be on that new ground
[2:23] no it's redeemed it belongs to him and
[2:26] for his that was redeemed out of it see
[2:29] and look you are a part of that ground
[2:31] is that right and when he redeemed you
[2:33] he redeemed the earth and the same thing
[2:34] and you are together again oh how much
[2:37] pler can it be see you have to be
[2:39] redeemed cuz you're a part of it and if
[2:41] the blood didn't drop on you you ain't
[2:42] redeemed yet you're not called then he
[2:44] cleanses it that's the same thing he
[2:46] does in the fire even the blood blood
[2:49] dropped it's yet got to be cleansed by
[2:52] fire that's right for a dwelling place
[2:54] for
[2:57] God go God already took up his AB
[3:00] potentially the kingdom of God is in the
[3:01] earth now in the hearts of his Saints
[3:04] it's his attributes that he begin in the
[3:06] beginning now his attributes is redeemed
[3:08] what's he what's he waiting to redeem
[3:10] the Earth to set his attributes on it to
[3:13] fulfill exactly he's predestinated plan
[3:16] do you see
[3:17] it all
[3:21] right so we see there it's it's clear
[3:24] Redemption is for this Earth our bodies
[3:28] but it's also for it's not just for the
[3:30] inside of us and that's the thing where
[3:32] so many people get it confused and
[3:34] muddled up within the Christian realm as
[3:36] we talked at the end of last time is
[3:39] this philosophy of Plato and Aristotle
[3:43] comes in where spiritual is good and and
[3:48] physical is bad but that's not what God
[3:50] Said in the beginning did God when he
[3:53] created Adam and Eve in the in a body of
[3:56] Flesh what did he say that was bad no he
[3:59] said it was very
[4:01] good right so this is important to
[4:04] understand is that the physical the
[4:06] heaven is not merely a spiritual place
[4:09] like we think of it God is a spirit he
[4:11] covers all space and time we can't touch
[4:14] him we can't see him no it's you're not
[4:16] going to be like that and Heaven is not
[4:18] going to be like that and that's the
[4:19] problem is that concept has permeated so
[4:22] much in our culture and around the world
[4:25] that heaven is an unearthly spiritual
[4:27] place and even brother brandham was
[4:29] stumbled by that so bad and it took the
[4:31] Lord really dealing with him
[4:32] supernaturally to get it out of his
[4:34] mind it's a it's a place where it's
[4:38] physical it's real you can touch it
[4:41] heaven heaven is not unearthly it's not
[4:44] a cloud it's just as real it's more real
[4:48] than what you are here today amen and so
[4:51] the Earth is the place that God created
[4:55] for his glory to be seen on again
[4:58] because of sin that's separate separated
[5:00] but God's purpose is to bring it back
[5:02] together again and we're going to look
[5:03] at some
[5:04] scriptures Ezekiel 43:2 and behold the
[5:07] glory of the god of Israel came from the
[5:08] way of the East and his voice was like a
[5:11] noise of many Waters and the Earth
[5:14] shined with his glory god is going to
[5:16] create this Earth so that it shines with
[5:19] his glory Psalms 859 surely his
[5:23] salvation is nigh them that fear Him
[5:26] That Glory May dwell in our land god
[5:29] wants glory to dwell in the land of his
[5:34] people Psalm 24:1 the Earth is the Lords
[5:38] and the fullness thereof the world and
[5:40] they that dwell therein it all belongs
[5:42] to God and God is not going to go he's
[5:45] not going to let Satan win right he's
[5:50] not going to let Satan win and say you
[5:52] know what you corrupted this thing and I
[5:54] just give up I'm going to start all over
[5:56] again he he never does that that's not
[5:58] God that's not in that's not in God's
[6:00] mind that's not in his plan that's not
[6:02] how he works that's not how he operates
[6:04] he takes that which belonged to him that
[6:06] was lost and fixes it he repairs it he
[6:11] restores
[6:13] it Revelation 11:15 and the seventh
[6:15] angel sounded and there were great
[6:17] voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of
[6:19] this world are become the kingdoms of
[6:22] our Lord and of his Christ and he shall
[6:25] reign forever and ever this hasn't
[6:27] happened yet but it's going to happen
[6:30] the governments of this world are going
[6:31] to change who who their allegiance is to
[6:35] it's going to be transferred when Christ
[6:36] and the Saints return back to this earth
[6:39] will take over every government of the
[6:42] world second Peter
[6:45] 3 and of course you know this is the
[6:48] part of the text that brother brandham
[6:49] took for the future home and we'll talk
[6:52] about it whereby the world that then was
[6:54] being overflowed with water perished but
[6:57] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[6:59] by the same word are kept in store
[7:02] reserved under Fire against the day of
[7:04] judgment and predition of ungodly
[7:08] men but beloved be not ignorant of this
[7:10] one thing that one day is with the with
[7:12] the Lord as a thousand years and a
[7:14] thousand years as one day the Lord is
[7:16] not slack concerning his promise as some
[7:18] men count slackness but his
[7:20] longsuffering to usw not willing that
[7:23] any should perish but that all should
[7:24] come to repentance but the day of the
[7:27] Lord will come as a thief in the night
[7:29] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[7:32] with a great noise and the elements
[7:33] shall melt with fervent heat the Earth
[7:36] also and the works that are therein
[7:39] shall be
[7:40] burned seeing then that all these things
[7:43] shall be dissolved what manner of
[7:46] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[7:48] conversation and godliness looking for
[7:50] and Hasting under the coming of the day
[7:52] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[7:55] shall be dissolved and the elements
[7:57] shall melt with fervent heat
[8:00] nevertheless we according to his promise
[8:02] look for new heavens and a new Earth
[8:05] wherein dwelleth righteousness all right
[8:07] so this is where many people take they
[8:10] take these verses and they say God's
[8:13] going to destroy the Earth the entire
[8:16] Earth Heaven everything completely
[8:19] dissolve it and then he's going to
[8:21] recreate a new heavens and a new Earth
[8:24] but remember what Peter starts with at
[8:26] the very
[8:27] beginning the world that then was he's
[8:30] using past judgment to tell us and give
[8:33] us an understanding of future judgment
[8:36] the world that then was so what is a
[8:38] what is the world that then was the
[8:40] world
[8:41] order the Earth
[8:43] structure is there it completely changed
[8:46] the geology of the earth totally changed
[8:49] because of the flood but the structure
[8:52] of the earth is the exact same earth
[8:55] right it just changed from one form to
[8:59] another right well that's the same thing
[9:02] the elements melting with a fervent heat
[9:05] things being dissolved does not mean
[9:08] that God totally destroys his entire
[9:11] creation and does red does a six- day
[9:14] creation or something to that effect
[9:16] that idea no what it is is this Earth
[9:20] this Earth is held in
[9:23] judgment is there and and this Earth
[9:26] these elements will melt with fervent
[9:28] Heat
[9:29] and it speaks of uh grab that word it
[9:33] says where it will pass
[9:35] away brother Bram says it means it's
[9:38] changing from one form to another it's
[9:41] not go out of EX existence but to be
[9:44] changed from old to new it's the same
[9:46] word and same terminology that's used of
[9:50] the new birth
[9:52] amen uh Matthew
[9:55] 19 27 then answered Peter and said unto
[9:58] him behold we have forsaken all and
[9:59] followed thee what shall we have
[10:03] therefore and Jesus said unto them
[10:06] verily I say unto you that ye which have
[10:08] followed me in the Regeneration when the
[10:11] son of man shall sit in the Throne of
[10:12] his glory ye also shall sit upon 12
[10:15] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[10:19] so this is referring to the Millennium
[10:21] the millennial Reign and now we're
[10:22] talking about our future home we went
[10:24] through that whole picture the the
[10:26] Millennium isn't the restoration of the
[10:28] new heavens and the new Earth right that
[10:30] comes after the Millennium nevertheless
[10:33] as you'll find this in scripture when
[10:35] when when we're talking about our future
[10:37] home and even brother brandham does this
[10:39] the Millennium and the new Earth begins
[10:41] to blend together why does it do this
[10:43] why do they do that why do the writers
[10:45] of the Bible why does brother brandham
[10:47] do that I believe it's this here because
[10:49] the Millennium is a
[10:52] regeneration of the
[10:54] earth there's a there's a process we
[10:57] understand also that that just as the
[11:01] fire burnt up Sodom the fire will burn
[11:05] up this
[11:06] present
[11:08] age when when when the leodan age
[11:11] finishes the tribulation sets in at the
[11:13] end of that comes the day of the Lord
[11:15] and that is where there's a fire that
[11:17] comes that's one fire that but there's
[11:20] another fire that will come at the end
[11:22] of the Millennium when Satan is loosed
[11:25] for a little season and gathers together
[11:27] the people to fight against
[11:29] the the lamb and the Saints then the
[11:32] fire comes from Heaven again so and even
[11:35] Peter goes back and forth between that
[11:37] the coming of the day of God that's not
[11:40] the end of the Millennium that's the end
[11:42] of the tribulation period but he jumps
[11:45] directly then to the new heavens and the
[11:46] new Earth so you see what I'm saying
[11:48] when when we talk about this there is a
[11:50] blending the Bible talks of it
[11:52] distinctly brother brandham talks about
[11:54] it distinctly and the Bible talks about
[11:56] it separately uh uh
[11:59] uh in a United Way so it talks it both
[12:02] both directions so the Regeneration is
[12:05] what's happening what when Christ and
[12:07] the Saints come back to earth things
[12:10] will be slowly set back into order just
[12:14] like when you and I are regenerated the
[12:16] fire of the Holy Ghost brother Bram
[12:18] talks about the fire of the Holy Ghost
[12:19] is like the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:21] see the fire comes and then what are we
[12:24] we're we're not a finished product when
[12:25] we get the Holy Ghost there's a process
[12:28] that takes place we're transformed from
[12:30] glory to glory adding word on top of
[12:33] word so the Millennium does that and
[12:36] then that that comes to then the new
[12:38] heavens and the new Earth and there's a
[12:40] lot there and you can go completely go
[12:42] to seed when you look at types yeah and
[12:45] there's always a danger of that when you
[12:47] do that so you have to be careful how
[12:48] far you want to take it because you look
[12:50] at a type and you start creating a new
[12:52] doctrine because you're looking at a
[12:54] type and that's that's the danger that
[12:57] you have to be careful about types types
[12:59] confirm the doctrine that's there types
[13:02] don't make the
[13:05] doctrine uh Revelation 215 and I think
[13:07] probably many of our
[13:09] problems around the message over the
[13:13] history of the last how many ever years
[13:14] have come because people have taken a
[13:16] type and tried to fit it over the top of
[13:19] a clear simple basic doctrine of the
[13:23] Bible Revelation 215 and he that sat
[13:26] upon the throne said behold I make all
[13:28] things knew and he said unto me right
[13:30] for these words are true and faithful
[13:33] again easy to take this and
[13:36] say he must destroy it all completely no
[13:41] atoms left and he recre recreates at the
[13:44] atomic level completely no look at what
[13:48] Redemption is he went to the Cross to
[13:51] make all things new
[13:53] right and he started that process I go
[13:57] to my father's house I prepare prepare a
[13:59] place for you etc etc so the process
[14:02] started at the cross what what is he
[14:04] doing
[14:06] renewing making all things new is the
[14:08] exactly the same way of saying
[14:10] regenerating renewing bringing it from
[14:14] Death To
[14:16] Life Revelation
[14:18] 211 and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[14:21] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[14:23] Earth were passed away and there was no
[14:26] more sea again same same terminology
[14:30] going from one form to another passing
[14:34] from one form to another from Death to
[14:39] life all right let's look at some of the
[14:42] Old Testament
[14:43] promises Psalms 10215 so the Heathen
[14:46] shall fear the name of the Lord and all
[14:49] the kings of the earth thy Glory so
[14:52] every nation is going to come under the
[14:54] Dominion of Christ
[14:57] amen Psalm 10216 when the Lord shall
[15:00] build up Zion he shall appear in his
[15:04] glory so he's going to appear in his
[15:06] glory and he's going to reveal himself
[15:08] to the kings of the Earth to the Heathen
[15:10] think about that you could say well
[15:12] that's that's me that's us that's the
[15:14] Gentiles yes that's true but remember he
[15:16] reveals himself first the son of man in
[15:20] spirit formed to who first to the he
[15:23] revealed him before in flesh form to the
[15:26] Jews he reveals it in spirit form form
[15:29] to the Gentiles then when the Gentiles
[15:32] are taken up what does he do he reveals
[15:35] himself in spirit form to the Jews
[15:38] through the two two witnesses amen right
[15:41] but then he's going to come and he's
[15:43] going to reveal himself to the whole
[15:45] earth to all the heathens to all the
[15:47] nations his he shall appear in his glory
[15:50] and bring destruction to the world so
[15:52] that's that's coming he's going to
[15:54] reveal himself on Earth here to the
[15:57] Heathen amen
[16:00] Hallelujah I want to be with him I don't
[16:02] want to be here cuz his Revelation then
[16:05] if you're here then it's it's a
[16:09] problem all right Isaiah 11 familiar
[16:13] scriptures of course again this is this
[16:15] is speaking about the Millennium but
[16:17] again it's it's giving the picture an
[16:20] understanding that this is a
[16:22] restoration of the earth it's part of
[16:24] the process the wolf also shall dwell
[16:27] with the lamb and the Le shall lie down
[16:29] with the kid and the calf and the Young
[16:31] Lion and the fatling together and a
[16:33] little child shall lead them and the cow
[16:36] and the bear shall feed their young ones
[16:37] shall lie down together and the lion
[16:40] shall eat straw like the ox and the
[16:42] suckling child shall play on the hole of
[16:45] the ASP and the wean child shall put his
[16:47] hand on the cockatrice
[16:50] den they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[16:52] all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall
[16:55] be full of the knowledge of the Lord as
[16:57] the waters come cover the
[17:01] Sea The Curse is
[17:04] lifted there's no
[17:07] longer now you put a calf together with
[17:10] a lion the lion has supper right but in
[17:14] in that the curse is lifted it's not
[17:17] supper anymore they're they're eating
[17:19] together they're playing together and it
[17:22] even of course it's a millennial scene
[17:24] it's speaking of little children and so
[17:25] forth wean children and nursing children
[17:28] and so on you know this is this is not
[17:31] the new Heaven and the new Earth but it
[17:34] is the start of the release of the curse
[17:37] that's finished in the new Heaven and
[17:39] the new Earth
[17:41] amen Isaiah 65:17 for behold I create
[17:45] new heavens and a new Earth and the
[17:47] former shall not be remembered nor come
[17:50] into
[17:52] mind right so here he is once again
[17:56] taking it from one form to another and
[17:59] and even if you look at this verse the
[18:02] word create there's two tenses in Hebrew
[18:06] one is a
[18:07] finished process and one is a a pro a
[18:11] work in
[18:12] process and this this the tense of this
[18:15] word create is the process so he says
[18:19] for behold I am creating new heavens and
[18:22] the new Earth and then it goes on to
[18:24] describe the Millennium right brother
[18:26] Bram says this is referring to the
[18:28] Millennium so the Millennium is a part
[18:30] of the
[18:31] recreation
[18:34] process Revelation 21:25 and the gates
[18:37] of it shall not be shut At All by day
[18:39] for there shall be no night there
[18:43] 26 and they shall bring the glory and
[18:45] honor of the Nations into
[18:49] it all right we're going to we're
[18:51] looking at that but I want you to know
[18:53] that this is an Old Testament prophecy
[18:56] it's in Isaiah 60
[19:00] brother brandham in Christ is the
[19:01] mystery of God revealed says now notice
[19:03] again now what's his three-fold purpose
[19:06] manifest itself in Jesus Christ to come
[19:08] into the body by Jesus Christ to have
[19:10] the preeminence to what restore Back to
[19:13] Eden bring back to that which was lost
[19:15] that was the only thing out of order all
[19:17] the rest of his things was in order so
[19:20] the three-fold purpose manifest himself
[19:22] in Jesus Christ come into the body by
[19:24] Jesus Christ to have preeminence and to
[19:27] restore it back
[19:28] to Eden so three parts of that purpose
[19:31] the Millennium is that start of that
[19:34] process the new heavens and the new
[19:35] Earth is the completion of that
[19:38] process that's what we're coming to
[19:40] restoring Eden again all right
[19:46] so Isaiah 6011 therefore thy Gates shall
[19:49] be open continually they shall not be
[19:52] shut day nor night that men may bring
[19:54] unto thee the forces of the Gentiles and
[19:56] that their kings may be brought
[19:58] for the nation and Kingdom that will not
[20:00] serve thee Shall Perish ye those Nations
[20:02] shall be utterly wasted the glory of
[20:05] Lebanon shall come unto thee the fur
[20:07] tree the pine tree and the box together
[20:09] to beautify the place of my sanctuary
[20:11] and I will make the place of my feet
[20:13] glorious the sons also of them that
[20:15] Afflicted thee shall come bending unto
[20:17] thee and all they that despise thee
[20:19] shall bow themselves down at the souls
[20:21] of thy feet and they shall call Thee the
[20:23] city of the Lord the Zion of the Holy
[20:25] One of Israel whereas thou has been
[20:28] Forsaken and hated so that no man went
[20:30] through Thee I will make thee an eternal
[20:33] Excellency a joy of many
[20:35] generations Thou shalt also suck the
[20:37] milk of the Gentiles and shalt suck the
[20:38] breast of Kings Thou shalt know that I
[20:41] the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer
[20:43] the mighty one of Jacob for brass I will
[20:45] bring gold and for iron I will bring
[20:47] silver and for wood brass and for Stones
[20:49] iron I will also make thy off officers

[20:54] righteousness violence shall no nor no

[21:30] people also shall be all righteous they
[21:33] shall inherit the land forever the
[21:35] branch of my planting the work of my
[21:37] hands that I may be
[21:40] glorified again these verse from this
[21:43] these
[21:46] verses are put forward in Revelation
[21:49] speaking of the new heaven new heavens
[21:52] and the new Earth quite an Earthly
[21:55] scene this is not a picture
[21:58] of living off in outer space on a
[22:01] cloud this is I mean look at it ships
[22:05] silver gold Kings flocks Rams camels fur
[22:10] trees pine trees that's
[22:14] Heaven it's clear that this Earth is our
[22:17] Eternal destination a perfect
[22:20] Earth I want you to think of all the
[22:22] great things that you
[22:24] enjoy and and I I especially I wish I
[22:27] wish the young people I see a few young
[22:29] people are with me but I feel like this
[22:32] is so important when I was a kid the
[22:34] thought of Heaven Was terrifying because
[22:36] it sounded so incredibly boring in my
[22:40] idea it was of course I was a Lutheran
[22:43] so church was boring we're sitting there
[22:47] you're sitting there you're going
[22:48] through and you're doing um you're
[22:51] you're reading off something in
[22:52] responsive reading and the minister gets
[22:55] up he's not even interested in what he's
[22:56] talking about so your idea about worship
[22:59] and Heaven is so perverted and clouded
[23:03] that there's no way to understand these
[23:06] things correctly so what why would you
[23:08] long for heaven why would you desire
[23:11] Heaven as a young person and that's
[23:14] that's wrong there's a I mean it's a
[23:16] place of Joy rejoicing our services
[23:20] church services should be a place of joy
[23:22] and rejoicing as well but that is going
[23:25] to be a reflection of that because we we
[23:28] we love God and we love his presence and
[23:31] it's it's a a you know think think of
[23:34] the things that you enjoy cuz it's not
[23:35] going to be just a worship service for
[23:37] all of eternity though that's wonderful
[23:39] and there will be enormous amounts of
[23:42] that continuous amounts of that but the
[23:47] things that you enjoy now they'll never
[23:51] end hiking art painting carpentry poetry
[23:57] writing reading music mountains camping
[23:59] cabins family vacations Sports Etc you
[24:03] say sports not the modern worldly Sports
[24:06] there'll be something on a different
[24:07] totally different level we love enjoy
[24:10] and and enjoy moving our bodies and we
[24:13] get as you get older you get more and
[24:15] more limited in that right but you'll be
[24:18] the full Vibrance of Youth in that body
[24:22] and you'll be enjoying things uh you you
[24:25] say oh I like soccer I like baseball I
[24:27] like this there be things like that
[24:29] only so much better so much more
[24:33] enjoyable and not in a competition of
[24:36] anger and frustration with one another
[24:39] see this is so
[24:41] important to understand these things
[24:44] especially I believe for the young
[24:45] people a perfect Earth is our Eternal
[24:48] destination and it's a place of
[24:51] unbelievable Joy I mean think about the
[24:54] the times you're traveling or or some of
[24:57] people people hate travel so I'll just
[24:59] think about the times you're at home in
[25:00] your backyard in your garden or the rest
[25:02] of us who like to travel think about the
[25:04] times you're seeing some incredible
[25:07] amazing place whether it be the ocean
[25:10] that doesn't have to now it has to end
[25:12] we got to go back to work we got to go
[25:13] back to our responsibilities that will
[25:15] never
[25:17] end that will never stop that joy that
[25:21] that sense of connection with God and
[25:25] His creation that will never end
[25:28] there's nothing to Cloud there's nothing
[25:29] to destroy that
[25:35] whatsoever being holy is not being a
[25:40] monk sedentary stuck in a Cell
[25:44] someplace that's not what it is and you
[25:46] know if we we present that idea that the
[25:48] only way to the only way to pray and the
[25:50] only way to be holy is just to be stuck
[25:53] in some little boring cell and and
[25:57] that's that's not God's idea that's not
[26:00] God's
[26:03] heart all of those things of course
[26:05] getting on your knees and praying now
[26:07] brother brand says that's the true
[26:08] expression of manhood is wearing out the
[26:11] floor and wearing out your the knees of
[26:13] your pants in prayer but that he didn't
[26:16] say that was the only expression and the
[26:19] only way see look at brother brandom
[26:22] himself how much he loved being in in
[26:24] nature and in the wilderness and
[26:26] connecting with the Lord out there that
[26:28] will that is that is the reality of what
[26:32] heaven is going to be like am nothing to
[26:35] hinder no devil to hinder you from your
[26:37] fellowship out in the woods or on the
[26:39] top of a mountain and you could just
[26:42] you'll be able to just by thought be on
[26:44] the top of a mountain or if you don't
[26:46] want to you'll be able to run as fast as
[26:48] you can up that
[26:54] mountain I mean you you think about the
[26:57] things that that are
[26:58] expressed in in those verses and in a
[27:02] number of other verses is you know
[27:04] there's there's farming in
[27:07] heaven some people love farming they
[27:09] think that's the absolute greatest thing
[27:12] and they they maybe they maybe they
[27:14] dreamt of being a farmer well maybe that
[27:17] dream is going to be fulfilled over
[27:19] there because they be beat their swords
[27:21] into plowshares plow Shares are used for
[27:24] farming in case you'd ever wondered so
[27:26] there's work and there's there's there's
[27:29] work that's horrible and there's work
[27:32] that we love and enjoy and that's the
[27:35] kind of work that's going to be over
[27:38] there I want you I want you to
[27:40] understand something uh in closing God
[27:43] made you the way that you are to enjoy
[27:47] what you enjoy and it's not a mistake
[27:51] you don't have to be like somebody else
[27:53] so this this teaching applies here but
[27:56] it also applies over there he made you
[27:58] in a certain way and
[28:01] sometimes sometimes he calls you to
[28:03] something and you have to surrender
[28:05] everything to the Lord and it becomes
[28:08] you feel now like it's a sacrifice
[28:11] because you're so bound to time I wish I
[28:13] could do this I have it in my heart to
[28:15] do this and you can never quite get
[28:18] there I believe that there you'll get to
[28:22] that because here is just a fleeting
[28:26] passing moment there it it's unending
[28:30] hard for us to
[28:32] comprehend on the new Earth you'll be
[28:34] the very same person with the same gifts
[28:36] the same likes the same things that you
[28:37] enjoy but you'll be free to pursue
[28:40] exactly what God designed you to pursue
[28:43] without the hindrance of sin and
[28:48] time amen let's stand and
[28:55] pray heavenly father thank you so much
[28:58] for all the good things that you've
[29:00] given to us Lord even even
[29:02] now Lord you made us in the bodies that
[29:06] we're in Lord with lungs with the heart
[29:09] with the ability to run and leap and
[29:12] dance and
[29:14] laugh and all those different things
[29:16] that you've created us to be Lord
[29:18] and you've you've created us to
[29:22] desire to enjoy life Lord and the true
[29:27] path of enjoyment is a full surrender to
[29:31] you father because knowing that this is
[29:34] just
[29:35] temporary the things that we're going
[29:37] through the suffering and the trials
[29:39] that we Face they're just
[29:41] temporary and and in in surrendering and
[29:45] offering ourselves up completely to you
[29:47] there lies a reward at the
[29:50] end Lord a perfect body on a perfect
[29:54] Earth with a perfect life Lord to joy
[29:58] and be the person you created us to be
[30:01] for your glory Lord radiating your very
[30:04] Glory your
[30:06] attributes yourself on display Lord we
[30:10] commit ourselves to you Lord we ask that
[30:12] you be with us ask that you'd be
[30:14] glorified in our worship and in the word
[30:16] that would go forth we commit ourselves
[30:18] to you in Jesus name
[30:26] amen
