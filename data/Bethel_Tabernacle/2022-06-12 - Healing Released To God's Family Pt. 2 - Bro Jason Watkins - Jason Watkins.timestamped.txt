[36:00] i wouldn't stand a chance
[36:02] amen praise the lord greet you in the
[36:04] name of the lord today i'm going to
[36:06] make just a few quick announcements
[36:09] um
[36:10] write right fast before we turn into the
[36:12] book of revelation
[36:14] amen amen
[36:17] pause that right quick while i make
[36:18] these announcements
[36:20] um
[36:21] i want to first thank the lord that
[36:23] we're in service today amen
[36:25] uh thankful to the lord for all the
[36:27] testimonies i've had quite a few
[36:29] testimonies even some more coming in
[36:32] this morning from
[36:33] brother bruce and different ones and
[36:35] over
[36:36] previous days and
[36:38] uh thankful to the lord that he's
[36:40] brought everybody uh through this recent
[36:43] virus
[36:44] outbreak and it wasn't too severe it was
[36:47] a pretty much of a mild case most
[36:50] everybody got through it in a few days
[36:51] and
[36:53] but we've still we've got a few still um
[36:56] with a handful just a small handful
[36:59] kind of following the
[37:01] uh the new recommendation from the cdc
[37:04] they've lowered it from 10 days now to
[37:06] five days i think they realize that we
[37:08] pretty well all contacted it amen it's
[37:10] pretty well i think everybody around the
[37:12] world has probably come into contact
[37:13] with it and
[37:15] and people who have been vaccinated
[37:16] still get it people who aren't get it
[37:20] so what amen
[37:21] so we we just realized that
[37:24] these things are coming upon the world
[37:26] and i think that they realized that um
[37:28] the the part that was really lethal when
[37:31] it first came out and human bodies
[37:33] weren't used to it and we lost a number
[37:35] of very precious people in the message
[37:37] but it was all in god's control it was
[37:39] all in god's hands and so that's why we
[37:42] made a decision we would never operate
[37:44] in fear
[37:45] uh we would always do what was prudent
[37:47] and try to use the better part of wisdom
[37:49] but and so we we suspended wednesday and
[37:51] i hated doing that i always hate doing
[37:54] that
[37:54] um but
[37:55] uh i i do think it was the right
[37:57] decision elsewise i wouldn't have done
[37:59] it
[38:00] and so um
[38:02] we want to just uh be praying for those
[38:04] who are still
[38:05] on the last parts of recovery most of
[38:07] them i've got reports doing good but
[38:09] they're
[38:10] just um just continuing uh to wait out
[38:14] those five days so it's all good
[38:16] amen i want to give you a reminder so we
[38:19] want to be praying for them don't forget
[38:21] that and i want to give you a reminder
[38:24] that today
[38:25] i i think we've called it for 4 p.m
[38:29] uh sister jean will be continuing her
[38:31] amazing journey into the message of the
[38:34] hour and so she she left us last time as
[38:38] a young 21 year old mother uh receiving
[38:40] the holy ghost and just giving her
[38:42] testimony and so we we're it's uh kind
[38:46] of aimed at the senior youth but
[38:47] everybody's invited we let everybody
[38:49] that wanted to come last time we just
[38:51] keep uh the adults toward the back and
[38:53] we set all of the senior youth up here
[38:55] on the side near the front we put sister
[38:57] gene over here

[39:21] brother eddie came in and how he got the
[39:23] holy ghost and and how they came to hear
[39:26] the message of the hour and they were
[39:28] living in texas and up through 1964 uh
[39:31] when they came to uh be in the meetings
[39:33] there with brother branham so i'm
[39:35] looking forward to that she'll need a
[39:36] third party amen to take it from there
[39:38] to now
[39:39] i want to know how she made it to here
[39:41] amen he said well you're a son you
[39:43] should know you can't believe how many
[39:44] things i heard her say in part one i
[39:46] thought wow i never knew that
[39:49] so we've been thoroughly enjoying it the
[39:51] young people have been the older people
[39:53] have been and so it's really wonderful i
[39:56] want to announce a senior youth
[39:58] gathering
[39:59] uh on this coming saturday
[40:02] uh june 18. uh we're going to have it
[40:04] out at brother michael and sister wanda
[40:06] gonzalez home amen that's a great place
[40:09] to do it i've i've actually got some
[40:11] plans when the weather cools off to do
[40:12] some campfire stuff out there brother
[40:14] mike and sister wanda live in an amazing
[40:17] it's a paradox
[40:19] it's like the wilderness but yet it's
[40:21] there's a modern home and you're driving
[40:23] out this road brother kenneth i don't
[40:24] know if you've ever been to their house
[40:25] but you're driving out this road and you
[40:27] think nobody could even live out here
[40:29] this is this is swampy and it's like a
[40:32] primitive campground back here and only
[40:34] cavemen would live back here
[40:36] and suddenly you round up you round a
[40:38] curve and boom there's a house like who
[40:40] who put a house back here
[40:42] and so it's a wonderful way to get away
[40:44] and feel like you're in the wilderness
[40:45] and you're actually 15 minutes from
[40:47] walmart amen
[40:49] so i uh we we're looking forward to some
[40:51] of that so this saturday
[40:54] i'll announce the time i don't have it
[40:55] worked out with mo just yet i want to
[40:57] see what's going to be best for them
[40:59] but that'll be this saturday and uh i've
[41:02] got a
[41:03] a film that i want to show you that i
[41:05] got from sister emily cobb uh and it
[41:08] deals with uh it's a documentary on life
[41:10] and dna and things like that and i'm
[41:13] going to tell you something friends i
[41:14] was told
[41:15] that
[41:16] this thing would bring you to tears and
[41:17] it pretty well did it was astonishing
[41:20] how god makes science prove his word
[41:25] and it it left me speechless at times
[41:27] and i i was thought of so many places in
[41:29] the scripture where if they just took
[41:31] god's word for it they could have saved
[41:33] billions of dollars in research and and
[41:35] just said well this is what happened and
[41:37] here's why here's how we're here and
[41:38] here's why we're here amen and then
[41:41] uh brother matt smith is gonna follow up
[41:43] the film with a bible lesson related to
[41:46] uh he's got a topic that he's been
[41:48] studying that's going to marry up to
[41:49] that really well so matt and i worked
[41:51] that out together
[41:53] and so we're looking forward to that
[41:54] this saturday
[41:56] at the gonzalez's home
[41:59] amen
[42:00] we want to be praying for brother jason
[42:03] uh his upcoming missionary trip leaving
[42:06] tuesday gonna be gone from june 14 to
[42:08] june 29 visiting turkey egypt and norway
[42:12] and so that's wonderful we're just uh
[42:14] thanking the lord that things are
[42:16] starting to open back up and brother jd
[42:18] getting back to the nuts and bolts of
[42:20] his ministry we even enjoyed having him
[42:23] here uninterrupted
[42:25] and i know the the his wife and kids
[42:28] have enjoyed that and uh but amen the
[42:31] lord is calling our brother overseas so
[42:34] we want to keep him in prayer and we've
[42:36] um helping to try to sponsor some of
[42:38] that so god bless you um in all of that
[42:41] let's turn in our bibles
[42:43] to the book of genesis chapter 1
[42:48] praise the lord
[42:49] you love him say amen
[42:52] all right
[42:55] genesis chapter 1
[42:57] and we're going to begin reading
[43:00] from verse
[43:02] 29
[43:04] amen
[43:07] let me get myself to the right spot
[43:11] i i'm wanting to continue today
[43:14] with uh the sermon that i started i was
[43:17] shocked when i looked on the website
[43:19] saying how long it's been since i've
[43:20] stood here preaching and it's been quite
[43:22] a while so i i tried to start preaching
[43:24] behind brother abraham the other service
[43:26] and boy i sure could have done it but
[43:28] but uh it i was my fox's tale was on
[43:32] fire amen so
[43:34] we want to get back into it today and i
[43:36] want to continue this thought from weeks
[43:39] ago uh a tithe i titled it healing
[43:42] released to god's family genesis 1 29 we
[43:47] begin
[43:49] and god said behold i have given you
[43:53] every herb bearing seed
[43:56] which is upon the face of all the earth
[43:59] and every tree
[44:01] which is in which
[44:03] is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to
[44:07] you it shall be for meat and to every
[44:10] beast of the earth and to every fowl of
[44:12] the air and to everything that creepeth
[44:15] upon the earth wherein there is life
[44:18] i have given every green herb for meat
[44:21] and it was so
[44:22] and god saw that everything that he had
[44:25] made
[44:26] behold it was very good and the evening
[44:30] and the morning were the sixth day
[44:32] thus the heavens and the earth were
[44:34] finished and all the host of them and on
[44:37] the seventh day god ended his work which
[44:41] he had made and he rested on the seventh
[44:44] day from all his work which he had made
[44:46] and god blessed the seventh day
[44:49] and sanctified it because that in it he
[44:52] had rested from all his work which god
[44:56] created and made
[44:59] let's go to the back of your bible to
[45:01] revelation chapter
[45:02] 16.
[45:04] we're going to catch
[45:06] just one single verse which is the 17th
[45:09] verse
[45:14] amen
[45:20] revelation chapter 16
[45:23] and verse 17
[45:26] and the seventh angel poured out his
[45:28] violin to the air
[45:30] and there came a great voice out of the
[45:32] temple of heaven from the throne saying
[45:35] it is done
[45:38] want to also as we go to prayer be
[45:40] remembering brother brad is away
[45:42] ministering and the devil was battling
[45:44] his throat this morning want to keep him
[45:47] in prayer
[45:48] this morning and so
[45:50] let's let's just be remembering god's
[45:52] servants

[45:55] thank you

[46:10] your word that we need at this hour lord

[46:16] lord it's been even a struggle to try to
[46:19] figure out exactly what can be covered
[46:22] today and so we give it into your hands
[46:25] lord we're asking for your mercy on the
[46:28] traveling ministry team members father

[47:05] commit ourselves into your hands in
[47:07] jesus name amen god bless you amen you
[47:10] can be seated
[47:24] now
[47:25] i i'm
[47:27] i want to
[47:29] just
[47:30] kind of
[47:32] take maybe 15 or 20 minutes
[47:34] to build
[47:35] a foundation
[47:37] so that that will enable me to
[47:40] refer back to my foundation you're going
[47:42] to hear me do that you understand how
[47:43] brother jason works i'm very structured
[47:46] and i'm not a teacher per se
[47:50] but i i am a subject preacher and i'm
[47:53] generally very focused and i have things
[47:55] laid out i don't always get to follow
[47:56] them sometimes the lord we get hijacked
[47:59] and the lord takes things in the way he
[48:01] wants it to go i'm only trusting that
[48:04] that as i have it laid out in front of
[48:06] me it seems to be the way the lord has
[48:07] anointed me thank you brother anthony
[48:09] and uh as i said that i've had a lot
[48:12] that i want to say from being out of the
[48:15] pulpit for some time now and i'm not
[48:17] going to try to say it all today so you
[48:20] know me you know my way i i like to make
[48:23] sure you retain and i don't over tax
[48:26] your attention span or oversponge your
[48:28] mind with information so don't worry
[48:31] just sit tight and uh and we're going to
[48:34] come to the real burden of my heart
[48:37] today but i
[48:39] i want to just weigh in
[48:41] with connecting genesis to revelation
[48:44] for a few minutes is that okay
[48:46] is that okay all right
[48:49] so i i was noticing
[48:51] on uh on a leading science magazine that
[48:54] i have read for years uh from a very
[48:57] young man
[48:58] and i i've noticed that one of the the
[49:01] themes that they kind of established a
[49:04] theme almost like a mission statement
[49:06] and i thought that's uh rather odd the
[49:09] first time i read it but i i realized
[49:12] that they're actually keeping it at the
[49:14] forefront it's as if it's what they want
[49:16] to be in the front of everyone's mind
[49:18] and all their subscribers they want this
[49:20] to be in the front of your mind and the
[49:24] statement goes like this
[49:26] this is the most exciting time to be
[49:30] alive in history to which i rarely can
[49:33] read a magazine and say amen but i could
[49:35] say amen to that
[49:36] now not for the same reason
[49:39] that they're believing that it's the
[49:41] greatest most exciting time to be alive
[49:44] in history but for
[49:46] time meeting prophecy and our part that
[49:49] we see
[49:50] our lives are literally walking through
[49:52] the bible right now i
[49:54] it is my great goal in this small series
[49:58] to try to tie some things together for
[50:01] you so that my aim is that by the time i
[50:04] get finished you're going to realize
[50:07] that there is nothing happening that's
[50:10] an
[50:10] accident there is nothing that has
[50:13] happened that is an accident and there
[50:16] is you know we we we we find that i want
[50:20] to make this statement that by being
[50:23] obedient to the word that we can destroy
[50:28] everything that satan comes against our
[50:31] lives with
[50:32] and that's an important point because
[50:35] satan now has reached a time where a
[50:38] prophet would identify that he's now the
[50:40] god news flash world here listen up
[50:43] earth satan is the god of the age
[50:46] this is actually now
[50:48] satan's eden brother branham says as god
[50:51] took 6 000 years to build his eden now
[50:54] satan has had 6 000 years to build his
[50:58] and he's built it methodically he's
[51:01] built it with with with intent he's
[51:04] built it with a lot of malice and a lot
[51:06] of forethought and you say what are what
[51:10] is the motive and the objective of
[51:13] lucifer he goes about like a roaring
[51:16] lion seeking whom he may devour
[51:19] he comes only for one reason and that's
[51:21] to steal
[51:22] and that's to kill and that's to destroy
[51:25] now he has a notion that he wanted to
[51:28] have a kingdom and be worshipped like
[51:31] god
[51:32] and a prophet
[51:34] discerned the very secret of lucifer's
[51:37] heart lucifer didn't like that he got
[51:40] outed by the prophet when the prophet
[51:42] said satan here's what you said in your
[51:45] heart and i'm gonna write it in a book
[51:47] and i'm gonna and god's gonna see that
[51:49] the whole world gets to read it that you
[51:51] said in your heart i will ascend and be
[51:53] like the most high
[51:55] i will
[51:56] put up my throne in the in the in the
[52:00] north uh and and this will be uh satan's
[52:04] attempt i realize i have this in my
[52:06] pocket i've set it out here to make an
[52:07] announcement this is somebody's watch
[52:09] it's been sitting back there for three
[52:10] months someone please claim it or it'll
[52:12] go to the lost and found and from there
[52:15] someone some strange will be wearing it
[52:17] so if it's your watch uh you can come up
[52:19] here at the end of service and get it
[52:20] it's an incline watch like a nice ladies
[52:22] watch so there you go
[52:24] all right let's leave it sitting there
[52:25] brother so we keep that reminded um and
[52:28] and we'll we'll put it lost and found
[52:29] soon all right now
[52:31] so we find then that that everything
[52:34] that we see happening
[52:36] satan has desired now he cannot
[52:40] and you want to be real aware of this
[52:42] satan
[52:43] you you shouldn't imagine that he's
[52:46] trying
[52:48] to build a kingdom alongside the kingdom
[52:51] of god
[52:53] it's not like he's saying to god you
[52:55] know you got your kingdom and your
[52:57] family and your people but hey i don't
[53:00] really want to be a part of that i want
[53:01] to go over here and build up my own
[53:04] kingdom now you could almost you you'd
[53:07] be excused for making that assumption
[53:09] the world seems to think of it that way
[53:11] but the prophet gives gives him away
[53:15] in that he wants to put his kingdom in
[53:17] the north exactly where the kingdom of
[53:18] michael was established so he's not
[53:21] saying i want to have a kingdom along
[53:23] with your kingdom and let the people
[53:25] choose which which kingdom they want to
[53:26] live in he doesn't want a two kingdom
[53:29] system he wants to destroy he wants to
[53:33] replace
[53:34] the kingdom of christ you get that so
[53:38] now you wanna you're gonna wanna be
[53:40] aware that everything he does has the
[53:45] main
[53:46] objective oh please hear these words
[53:51] his main objective
[53:54] is to destroy god's kingdom and since
[53:58] you
[53:59] happen to be
[54:00] god's kingdom then he wants to destroy
[54:07] every
[54:09] every move he makes
[54:12] every morning when he wakes up that's
[54:14] his plan
[54:15] to wipe to destroy the wisdom of parents
[54:19] to destroy the discernment of ministers
[54:22] to destroy the pursuit of young people
[54:26] to to set goals and dreams and he he's
[54:29] very crafty and he's very cunning and he
[54:33] can make it look like it you'll have an
[54:35] advantage but but you just remember
[54:39] every motive and every objective he has
[54:43] is the uh
[54:45] is the establishment of his kingdom
[54:49] at the cost of the annihilation
[54:53] of christ's kingdom
[54:55] if you
[54:56] if you lose sight of that
[54:59] then this is why too often times we find
[55:03] and i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and
[55:04] give you i'm gonna go ahead and put a
[55:05] ribbon on you i'm gonna go ahead and
[55:07] give you a medal today and to say i'm
[55:09] gonna believe by faith that every one of
[55:11] us in here are sons and daughters of god
[55:14] and yet you might find it strange to
[55:16] hear me say god sent me to preach this
[55:19] sermon to sons and daughters of god and
[55:22] say to you that this is exactly why you
[55:24] don't always find yourself having the
[55:27] victory you know you ought to have
[55:30] being seeing the promises of god come to
[55:33] pass in your life and i'm going to tell
[55:35] you something friends it's it's almost
[55:38] entirely if not entirely the fact that
[55:41] we lean towards you know towards satan's
[55:44] economy and it at the at the cost of
[55:48] dedicating ourselves to god's economy in
[55:51] god's kingdom
[55:53] and i've seen that have devastating
[55:55] consequences
[55:57] i've seen young people
[55:59] with that that go down
[56:02] the the way and
[56:04] they
[56:06] for reasons that are many sometimes
[56:09] they pick a path
[56:11] young people pick a path going forward
[56:13] they have a certain goal certain things
[56:15] they want to accomplish in the world
[56:17] something they want to be there's some
[56:18] image
[56:19] in their mind and
[56:22] it's not always that they can articulate
[56:24] exactly what the image is
[56:27] and and it's not that they have a poster
[56:29] on their wall
[56:31] and saying i want to be like this person
[56:33] or i want to be like this situation but
[56:36] it's it's the satan is oftentimes too
[56:38] crafty for that it just comes across
[56:41] sometimes as a as a desire
[56:44] to pursue the excellence as it's
[56:47] measured by the world standards
[56:50] and i can tell you something friends the
[56:52] way the world measures success and the
[56:53] way god measures success are
[56:55] they are they are completely opposite
[56:59] and and in fact his brother branham said
[57:01] if you're going to be uh if you if
[57:04] you're lusting to to have success in the
[57:07] world and you want to be you know uh
[57:10] that in the world he said you might as
[57:11] well forget this
[57:13] because this this is going to ruin your
[57:15] chances
[57:17] of being globally accepted
[57:19] this is going to ruin your chances of
[57:22] being globally popular this book will
[57:25] destroy
[57:26] all of your dreams to be somebody famous
[57:30] and admired among humanity
[57:33] but but the the beauty of it is that
[57:36] you're gonna want it to do that because
[57:39] everything in this world is going
[57:42] irreversibly irretrievably no way to
[57:45] stop it it's plunging off the abyss and
[57:48] going to ash and cinder and only those
[57:50] who made this their goal
[57:53] are going to be looking at a world after
[57:56] this world is over
[58:00] you got me
[58:03] so
[58:04] so we find then that
[58:06] this is satan's goal and
[58:09] it brings upon us
[58:11] a responsibility
[58:13] that we have to take the responsibility
[58:16] of our portion now this is where the the
[58:18] problem so often comes i said a few
[58:20] minutes ago how that you know young
[58:23] people and we have a lot of senior youth
[58:25] our senior youth group is pretty large
[58:27] more than now now nearly 30 and and so
[58:31] uh or more and so
[58:34] it's very relevant what i just said
[58:36] concerning the the pursuit of success in
[58:39] this world young people don't live in a
[58:42] mirage
[58:43] under a delusion of the devil
[58:45] thinking that the success of the world
[58:47] is your goal it's not your goal is
[58:49] eternal life
[58:51] because that's the only thing that'll
[58:52] last it's the only thing that matters
[58:54] everything else is going to destruction
[58:55] but then but then there's the sometimes
[58:58] it's it's not even that sometimes a you
[59:01] know a young person will make that
[59:02] choice no matter how what church they
[59:06] were at no matter who their parents were
[59:07] no matter what kind of raising no matter
[59:10] you you can't you can we can't save our
[59:12] children
[59:14] all we can do is train them up in the
[59:16] ways of the lord and try to live an
[59:18] example and pray for them and apply the
[59:21] token to them say well that sounds
[59:23] pretty feeble that's that's more power
[59:25] than than a nuclear reactor
[59:28] that has more power prayer and love and
[59:32] the holy spirit are the are the
[59:34] strongest forces and the strongest
[59:36] weapon and and too often times we we we
[59:40] find ourselves even parents and
[59:42] ministers and leaders we don't avail
[59:45] of all the opportunity that is right in
[59:48] front of us to have that kind of power
[59:51] and have that kind of influence
[59:53] sometimes you're gonna you're gonna go
[59:55] to the wall and you're gonna hit on all
[59:56] eight cylinders and the preacher's gonna
[59:58] do everything he can and everybody's
[1:00:00] gonna be praying and sometimes that
[1:00:01] young person will still stray
[1:00:03] sometimes they'll go a long ways and
[1:00:05] finally the holy spirit will bring him
[1:00:06] back because everybody kept praying and
[1:00:09] everybody kept believing and we kept
[1:00:10] loving and we kept hanging on to god and
[1:00:13] god brought them back and they come back
[1:00:14] cut up scarred and bruised and wounded
[1:00:16] and burnt and blistered
[1:00:18] and and you say needlessly yeah in one
[1:00:21] sense but maybe maybe god had to put
[1:00:23] them through that to make them useful
[1:00:26] somewhere down the road you know i i'm
[1:00:29] not saying it can't happen i'm just
[1:00:31] simply wanting you to open your eyes to
[1:00:33] understand what's happening
[1:00:35] see
[1:00:36] and then sometimes the it really becomes
[1:00:39] very bad because you know the
[1:00:42] sometimes ministry sometimes parents
[1:00:46] don't take the responsibility
[1:00:48] they they themselves aren't very
[1:00:50] spiritual and so they still want to live
[1:00:52] with one foot in the world and one foot
[1:00:54] in the holy spirit and children of god
[1:00:57] remember i already put a medal on you
[1:00:58] today don't think i'm not calling you a
[1:01:00] child of god
[1:01:01] you know you you you you still lusting
[1:01:04] for the things of the world you believe
[1:01:06] god you believe the message you're true
[1:01:07] you love the lord you really do for real
[1:01:09] no kidding but yet there's there's not
[1:01:12] that taking of that responsibility of
[1:01:14] resisting the enemy of and you can't
[1:01:16] resist the enemy until you surrender
[1:01:18] yourself to god
[1:01:20] that nobody ever successfully resisted
[1:01:22] the devil shall resist him and he'll
[1:01:23] flee from me no he won't
[1:01:25] you first the first part of that verse
[1:01:27] is that you humble yourself that you
[1:01:30] submit yourself unto god resist the
[1:01:32] devil it's a it's a two-stage process
[1:01:35] and and there's where people they don't
[1:01:37] mind saying oh i'll just resist the
[1:01:40] devil and i'll i'll just keep my family
[1:01:42] away from the really bad things but
[1:01:43] where's the where's the real total
[1:01:46] surrender
[1:01:47] that that can allow god to come down
[1:01:51] into a home and find order and get
[1:01:54] behind order and drive the order of his
[1:01:57] word forward and you begin to see
[1:01:59] miracles in your home and in your life
[1:02:00] and in your family i'm here to tell you
[1:02:02] something friends that that that that if
[1:02:05] we are willing to be obedient to the
[1:02:08] word you say well this happened this
[1:02:10] happened this happened this happened i
[1:02:11] got this disadvantage this disadvantage
[1:02:13] this is this disadvantage
[1:02:15] that's a lie of the devil to make you
[1:02:18] live in a pity party the you are the
[1:02:21] most privileged people that have ever
[1:02:25] walked the earth
[1:02:27] god revealed his word to you
[1:02:32] you are such a microscopic
[1:02:34] minority in in billions and billions and
[1:02:38] billions and billions and billions and
[1:02:41] billions of people and there's a little
[1:02:44] sliver of the elect lady and god has
[1:02:47] revealed to you and your eyes have come
[1:02:50] open
[1:02:51] amen see
[1:02:54] oh this happened to me that happened to
[1:02:55] me it's happened to all of us but let us
[1:02:57] rejoice in all things let us give thanks
[1:03:01] let us let the bride hath made herself
[1:03:04] ready
[1:03:07] stop giving yourself the excuse for
[1:03:09] carnality
[1:03:12] stop blaming it on someone else
[1:03:16] say it's me o lord
[1:03:18] standing in the need of prayer
[1:03:20] you are
[1:03:21] phenomenally privileged
[1:03:24] phenomenally
[1:03:26] uh advantaged
[1:03:29] and all god is simply trying to get you
[1:03:31] to understand
[1:03:34] is he started it perfect
[1:03:37] by the time we get to revelation 16
[1:03:40] a seventh vial is working in the world
[1:03:42] pouring out judgments
[1:03:44] and the bride is on the cusp of going
[1:03:46] home and the world is on the cusp of
[1:03:48] going into a tribulation
[1:03:50] and god is going to restore it all the
[1:03:52] way back and i just say i intend to be a
[1:03:56] part of that restoration
[1:03:59] i don't intend to go down with laodicea
[1:04:03] i intend to step on a millennial world i
[1:04:06] intend for that for my family and i'm
[1:04:09] willing i'm willing to say i will do
[1:04:11] what is necessary to submit myself to
[1:04:14] god humble my heart to his word give up
[1:04:17] all my dreams set my motives and
[1:04:19] objectives for his kingdom and teach my
[1:04:22] children and teach my grandchildren and
[1:04:24] be an example to christ of christ in the
[1:04:26] world
[1:04:29] and when you see that lacking when you
[1:04:31] see
[1:04:33] disorder in families and homes and
[1:04:35] marriages and young people and preachers
[1:04:37] and churches and ministry
[1:04:38] when you see things that are out of
[1:04:40] order and you see that god can't bless
[1:04:42] it god can't prosper it
[1:04:45] then it becomes
[1:04:48] careful how i say this it
[1:04:50] i don't want to diminish
[1:04:54] being right
[1:04:56] but you know you can
[1:04:59] you can be right
[1:05:01] in your understanding of a certain thing
[1:05:04] but if you go about it
[1:05:06] out of god's order
[1:05:08] then god can't get behind it
[1:05:10] even though what you're doing is right
[1:05:12] even though your motive your objective
[1:05:13] is pure but if you don't but if you
[1:05:16] don't submit yourself to god's order
[1:05:20] god's way of doing it see
[1:05:24] and and and this is why paul deals with
[1:05:27] families say my it's almost like paul's
[1:05:30] a third of his ministry is psychology
[1:05:32] well
[1:05:33] he's dealing with people
[1:05:34] who have a psyche
[1:05:37] he's dealing with people who have minds
[1:05:40] so it becomes necessary for paul to say
[1:05:42] things like you know cast down vain
[1:05:44] imaginations
[1:05:46] anything that exalts itself in your mind
[1:05:49] against god's word say well what is that
[1:05:51] what does that even mean it means that
[1:05:52] when the enemy comes along enticing you
[1:05:55] with some advancement in life or some
[1:05:57] entertainment or some recreation that
[1:05:59] you that you know is not according to
[1:06:01] god's character that's the time where
[1:06:03] you cast that down and say i will not do
[1:06:06] that i will not go that way i will
[1:06:09] submit myself to the word of god i will
[1:06:12] resist the devil and i will have victory
[1:06:16] because it's super sad to see young
[1:06:18] people
[1:06:19] who almost don't even get to get out of
[1:06:21] the gate
[1:06:23] there's no i've seen that so many years
[1:06:25] i
[1:06:26] i've had my heart broken more times
[1:06:29] you know trying to
[1:06:31] see young people that come up and i
[1:06:32] dedicate them as babies and
[1:06:34] baptize them as a as a tween and and and
[1:06:38] and then see them see that see the
[1:06:40] parents just not care enough
[1:06:43] because they still themselves are still
[1:06:45] caught between lusting for god and
[1:06:46] lusting for the world
[1:06:48] and and and the children are just left
[1:06:50] to go and then and then see them blow
[1:06:52] out and see them go into the world and
[1:06:53] they're out there even today and i pray
[1:06:55] for them constantly they're still out
[1:06:56] there today and even if they come back
[1:06:58] they're coming back wounded burnt
[1:06:59] blistered scarred scratched scorched
[1:07:02] and he say oh brother jason you you're
[1:07:05] trying to step on parents toes i'm not
[1:07:07] trying to step on anybody's toes if i'm
[1:07:09] stepping on toes i want to step on my
[1:07:10] own and say lord i want to press harder
[1:07:12] and i want to be even more of an example
[1:07:14] and i want to i want to preach it harder
[1:07:17] and i want to try to warn you that we're
[1:07:19] we're at the time where elements under
[1:07:22] the trumpets and vials and seals are
[1:07:24] pouring out into the earth and there's
[1:07:26] no remedy for it this earth is burning
[1:07:29] down but god is taking a bride home
[1:07:32] and god has has victory for you
[1:07:35] right now in satan's eden at his zenith
[1:07:39] god can still establish his throne and
[1:07:42] his authority in your home and in your
[1:07:45] children and in your marriage and in
[1:07:47] your job and in this church and we can
[1:07:49] see the supernatural
[1:07:53] i don't know what you want out of a
[1:07:54] church but that's what i want
[1:07:57] i i can't i can't
[1:07:59] account for people who just want a
[1:08:01] social gathering i can't even relate to
[1:08:03] that
[1:08:04] i that that's nauseating to me i've been
[1:08:06] in churches where just a social affair
[1:08:09] and
[1:08:10] and had to go for various reasons and
[1:08:13] oh my goodness get me out of here
[1:08:16] hallelujah that's a it's it's makes
[1:08:18] sometimes the things you see are just so
[1:08:21] now i i i i understand that people have
[1:08:25] been
[1:08:26] years under misinterpreted theology so
[1:08:28] you got to watch your attitude you got
[1:08:30] to keep your spirit right to pray in the
[1:08:32] right way but let me just say at the end
[1:08:34] of the day
[1:08:35] i'm glad
[1:08:36] that i have a church of believers
[1:08:39] i'm glad i get to preach to people who
[1:08:42] believe every word of god i can't
[1:08:44] account for the world i can't even get
[1:08:46] my mind around it anymore i've been
[1:08:48] serving god too long i've been in the
[1:08:50] presence of the sun too long and maybe
[1:08:52] it's baked my brain i hope it has i hope
[1:08:55] it's baked out all the notion of the
[1:08:57] world and put the love of god down in my
[1:08:59] heart and i hope it's putting it in your
[1:09:01] hearts
[1:09:04] god has released healing
[1:09:08] to his family
[1:09:10] and boy do we need it
[1:09:14] not just speaking physically
[1:09:17] we need it emotionally we need it
[1:09:19] mentally we need it spiritually
[1:09:24] we take our portion of the
[1:09:26] responsibility to become overcomers
[1:09:30] see there's uh
[1:09:34] yeah
[1:09:36] you just keep me in prayer i'm just just
[1:09:38] trying to follow the
[1:09:40] the lord i've got so much here that i
[1:09:41] don't want to get bogged down in i'm
[1:09:43] watching the clock
[1:09:45] and i'm determined to deliver my burden
[1:09:47] it's been on my heart for so long
[1:09:51] and and and and i and i may even i may
[1:09:54] even
[1:09:55] wait for a next installment to
[1:09:58] give you the foundation that i promised
[1:10:00] you to
[1:10:01] to show you how we got to here and
[1:10:04] uh because i feel like i'm already uh
[1:10:07] pouring out my heart and the holy spirit
[1:10:09] seems to be anointing it so we're just
[1:10:10] gonna keep going and i'll but i do wanna
[1:10:12] i do wanna back up and show you how the
[1:10:15] unfolding drama
[1:10:17] because that's what brother branham
[1:10:18] called it that's his word
[1:10:19] it's all a great to god it's a drama
[1:10:22] and and oh my if i would just take the
[1:10:25] time today
[1:10:26] to but i will
[1:10:28] and show you how we got to where we got
[1:10:30] to
[1:10:31] and that
[1:10:32] that there's nothing you know that that
[1:10:34] there's nothing accidental and there's
[1:10:37] nothing that's in disorder in god's
[1:10:39] prophecy or that or that somehow you
[1:10:42] know the world is is is spun out of
[1:10:44] control of god's word or that god has
[1:10:46] somehow let it get away from him that's
[1:10:48] that's not happened
[1:10:51] no god's not say the world's crazy
[1:10:54] it's just spun out of control god let it
[1:10:56] get away from him that's what the world
[1:10:57] thinks they're wrong
[1:11:00] they couldn't be more wrong
[1:11:02] everything is working the in fact is the
[1:11:05] exact opposite is true
[1:11:08] and and if i if i get a chance in
[1:11:10] another installment we can we can show
[1:11:12] you that through the history and through
[1:11:13] through the through what god shows us in
[1:11:16] prophecy i just feel i'm gonna skip that
[1:11:17] today uh because i i want to keep moving
[1:11:21] and
[1:11:22] you know we
[1:11:23] we have been given in this
[1:11:26] in this healing
[1:11:29] that is released to god's family it's
[1:11:32] it's very oftentimes hard say brother
[1:11:34] jason you know why do preachers just
[1:11:38] hammer at carnality and sin so much
[1:11:40] because there's no way i can get a man
[1:11:42] to a doctor unless i can join me sick
[1:11:46] you understand i can't get a man to
[1:11:48] salvation unless i can show him he's
[1:11:49] lost i have to prove it to him
[1:11:52] see and so that's why a lot of times you
[1:11:54] think you're fine and as a minister of
[1:11:56] the gospel i know you're not fine
[1:11:58] you're good you're a child of god but
[1:11:59] you're not fine
[1:12:01] and things aren't fine and and the holy
[1:12:04] spirit anoints preachers to come to a
[1:12:05] pulpit and say press harder
[1:12:08] strive
[1:12:10] let's let's move up let's let's keep
[1:12:12] pressing there's a there's a there's a
[1:12:14] mark and there's a high calling and
[1:12:16] here's the good news there's a prize
[1:12:19] hallelujah i like prizes i i like to
[1:12:23] know i haven't labored in vain i haven't
[1:12:25] ran in vain and you say i'm running for
[1:12:28] my life you're running to life
[1:12:30] hallelujah running for your life means
[1:12:32] you're running away from death and
[1:12:34] there's nothing better to do
[1:12:36] than run away from death
[1:12:41] and so we have to
[1:12:43] realize that god has sent a word in this
[1:12:45] hour so that we can take back every
[1:12:47] possession that god
[1:12:49] gave us in the garden of eden
[1:12:52] and everything he intended for us
[1:12:55] in the garden of eden said i've given
[1:12:56] you every tree
[1:12:58] i i've given you the ability brother
[1:13:00] branham said as they as they as they ate
[1:13:03] of those trees
[1:13:05] and said it he said it renewed their
[1:13:06] youth
[1:13:08] it renewed the adam and eve it renewed
[1:13:10] their youth daily
[1:13:12] and and you know they they would even go
[1:13:14] to sleep at night and
[1:13:16] father would come down and brother
[1:13:17] branham nobody can dramatize it like him
[1:13:20] he says that here he would come and he
[1:13:21] would say now children did you enjoy
[1:13:25] your day
[1:13:26] in my paradise oh
[1:13:28] yes father we learned so many things oh
[1:13:31] well now it's time to go to sleep now
[1:13:33] you've got to rest your bodies and
[1:13:35] you're going to eat of the tree it's
[1:13:37] going to renew your youth and brother
[1:13:40] ram said he would kiss them on the cheek
[1:13:42] kiss them good night tuck them in and he
[1:13:45] said he would just step back this is
[1:13:47] part of his thinking that
[1:13:49] that god looked on everything that he
[1:13:51] has had made and said well that's just
[1:13:54] that it's well it was very well
[1:13:58] so just understand friends when you're
[1:14:01] laying in your bed at night in slumber
[1:14:04] and you're asleep there's an all-seeing
[1:14:06] eye watching you
[1:14:08] and i want to know that he's standing
[1:14:10] there going this is very well
[1:14:13] this is very well this son of mine this
[1:14:17] daughter of mine this church this family
[1:14:19] this parent this young person this
[1:14:21] preacher oh it's not only good it's very
[1:14:25] good don't you
[1:14:27] don't you friends don't you want god to
[1:14:29] have that opinion of you and i
[1:14:32] you see preaching like this
[1:14:35] makes you cognizant of the fact that
[1:14:37] you're not just here
[1:14:39] you're not just a human life you know a
[1:14:41] little blip on the radar and you're just
[1:14:43] part of some you know uh
[1:14:46] part of humanity and millions and
[1:14:48] billions that have been down through the
[1:14:49] age and well what's after this and
[1:14:50] nobody knows and they got all kinds of
[1:14:52] terms for it and whatever you know the
[1:14:54] afterlife they call it and and then some
[1:14:56] of them they don't even know what if
[1:14:58] that's true and they just say well
[1:14:59] whatever's next i'm so glad i don't live
[1:15:01] in that kind of blindness i'm so glad i
[1:15:03] know what's next and since i know what's
[1:15:05] next i know where i came from and that
[1:15:07] and since i know where i'm going and
[1:15:09] where i came from then i know why i'm
[1:15:10] here
[1:15:11] and then that gives me purpose in my
[1:15:13] life and and gives me a drive to strive
[1:15:16] for these things
[1:15:18] and this is why paul would say
[1:15:20] whatsoever things are lovely and of a
[1:15:22] good report these are the things you
[1:15:23] think on him and and you know you don't
[1:15:25] you don't entertain the notions of the
[1:15:28] devil because that's gonna that's gonna
[1:15:29] harm you because he said you can eat of
[1:15:32] every tree but now there is one tree
[1:15:35] that if you eat off of it it'll kill you
[1:15:39] i've given you every tree for your life
[1:15:43] i've given you everything that you need
[1:15:46] for life
[1:15:47] to have life
[1:15:49] and more abundantly that's what jesus
[1:15:52] desire for us
[1:15:53] that you might have life and that you
[1:15:55] might have it more abundantly but
[1:15:57] there's a warning there's a contrast
[1:15:59] there's an enemy lurking
[1:16:03] who wants the annihilation of this
[1:16:05] kingdom you're part of and and since the
[1:16:07] kingdom is not a geographical piece of
[1:16:10] dirt the kingdom is the people you don't
[1:16:12] have a kingdom if you don't have people
[1:16:15] and so his goal then
[1:16:17] is to destroy the people what does he
[1:16:19] care if a millennial world is here and
[1:16:23] it's going to be here what does satan
[1:16:25] care if the millennial world is here and
[1:16:28] none of god's people make it
[1:16:31] and all he's got to do is wait out the
[1:16:33] thousand years and then he gets released
[1:16:34] and then it's just all his
[1:16:36] see so so so there's there's this whole
[1:16:40] idea then
[1:16:42] of removing hindrances now let me give
[1:16:44] you an example
[1:16:46] when we talk about removing hindrances
[1:16:50] we're all aware it's not a secret
[1:16:55] that
[1:16:56] through brother eddie's
[1:16:58] gene pool i inherited a tendency to
[1:17:02] build up a cardiovascular disease and
[1:17:05] that's not it's a condition it's not
[1:17:07] like a disease like a virus or something
[1:17:08] it's a it's simply that my body produces
[1:17:12] um a lot of different things that can
[1:17:14] plug up my arteries i brother eddie was
[1:17:16] like that he had triple bypass surgery
[1:17:19] at 64. uh his mother died at 50 years
[1:17:23] old suddenly and really uh no one really
[1:17:26] understood why until we understand it
[1:17:28] now it was coming down that strain i
[1:17:29] actually thought it had skipped me
[1:17:32] until a year ago i found i had a funny
[1:17:34] little feeling and went and found i was
[1:17:36] almost dead
[1:17:38] and i was i was the doctor according to
[1:17:40] his report i was i was minutes or hours
[1:17:44] from crossing
[1:17:46] i'm glad i didn't
[1:17:48] not that i wouldn't have enjoyed being
[1:17:50] there but i wouldn't have wanted to
[1:17:52] leave you all
[1:17:53] i wouldn't wanted to leave my family i
[1:17:55] wouldn't wanted to leave my wife and my
[1:17:56] children and my grandchildren i love
[1:17:58] life but like brother branham said jesus
[1:18:00] didn't want to die he he was young he
[1:18:02] had his brother and he he loved him and
[1:18:04] he he loved life and and i'm and i i
[1:18:08] have spent many an hour thanking god for
[1:18:11] preserving me
[1:18:12] when when it when the enemy was lurking
[1:18:15] unknown no one knew
[1:18:17] that he was working undetected
[1:18:20] and and he was trying to snuff me out
[1:18:22] but what i found out was that in a realm
[1:18:25] i couldn't see angels were moving to
[1:18:27] interdict
[1:18:28] every time the devil would do it here
[1:18:29] something would happen and i caught a
[1:18:31] symptom i went to a doctor they did a
[1:18:33] test oh no you're fine all the tests
[1:18:34] looked fine all tests looked fine well
[1:18:36] let's just do one last thing and they
[1:18:38] caught it
[1:18:41] and then and then i've had to keep up
[1:18:42] with that i had to have a recent another
[1:18:44] continuing procedure and i i've had to
[1:18:46] make lifestyle adjustments because i
[1:18:48] know this that until the god is finished
[1:18:51] with me i'm immortal
[1:18:54] i know that i can't i can't be killed
[1:18:57] until god is finished with me amen
[1:19:00] neither can you hallelujah
[1:19:02] so this is what to say the devil ain't
[1:19:04] nobody listen you're you're hearing a
[1:19:06] man say that who looked in the face of
[1:19:08] death a couple of times and i'm telling
[1:19:10] you i've been to the edge and my
[1:19:13] testimony is satan ain't nobody
[1:19:16] he ain't nobody he don't run nothing but
[1:19:19] his mouth
[1:19:20] he has no jurisdiction
[1:19:22] over me or you we don't live by the
[1:19:25] mercies of lucifer
[1:19:27] we live by the mercy and the grace of
[1:19:30] jesus christ amen hallelujah
[1:19:34] so
[1:19:36] so what did they have to do
[1:19:39] to save my life
[1:19:42] they
[1:19:43] all they did
[1:19:45] was
[1:19:46] remove
[1:19:47] hindrances
[1:19:50] you understand
[1:19:52] my heart was beating strong
[1:19:54] all my organs are functioning perfect i
[1:19:56] didn't have some kind of abnormality
[1:20:00] some
[1:20:01] disease i didn't have any of that i
[1:20:03] didn't have none of that i was a healthy
[1:20:05] man
[1:20:06] but i had unknown
[1:20:08] hindrances
[1:20:09] that was that were blocking the flow of
[1:20:13] life-giving blood
[1:20:15] and so all they did they didn't go in
[1:20:18] and rebuild my heart they didn't go in
[1:20:21] and pump some some some you know some
[1:20:23] futuristic thing in me all the doctor
[1:20:26] did was go in and whoop open up and
[1:20:28] remove the hindrances
[1:20:30] and then you know what happened my body
[1:20:32] just did what it does my heart kept
[1:20:34] right on beating now blood can flow now
[1:20:36] oxygen is moving and now i'm i'm gaining
[1:20:38] my health back i'm gaining strength back
[1:20:40] i'm gaining endurance back and all i did
[1:20:42] was remove blockages you see once that
[1:20:45] happened
[1:20:47] then the divine healing that's built
[1:20:49] into me
[1:20:51] took over
[1:20:53] see
[1:20:55] so
[1:20:56] when you
[1:20:57] become willing
[1:20:59] to remove hindrances
[1:21:02] hindrances that keep you
[1:21:04] from having a fervent prayer life
[1:21:09] hindrances that limit the power of god
[1:21:12] moving through your life hindrances that
[1:21:14] block god's vision for you that he had
[1:21:17] in genesis
[1:21:18] when he says i've given you all of these
[1:21:20] things to do what for life
[1:21:23] i've given you my word so you can live i
[1:21:25] put you here and saved you from from
[1:21:27] your fallen condition and i i made you
[1:21:30] so that you're a light you know so that
[1:21:32] so that you go out into a dark world and
[1:21:34] that your your light shines and the
[1:21:36] devil wants to put that out and all he's
[1:21:38] got to do all he's got to do to
[1:21:40] interrupt god's plan in your life he
[1:21:42] can't do anything about your gene
[1:21:45] you're a gene of god
[1:21:47] you're going to believe the word you
[1:21:49] can't not believe it
[1:21:50] there's no way to not say amen because
[1:21:52] there's an alien life inside you that'll
[1:21:54] start screaming amen
[1:21:56] and it'll bring your body subject to the
[1:21:58] word and and and if you want then god
[1:22:01] will then god will god will take other
[1:22:03] means
[1:22:05] but he will bring you to his word
[1:22:08] but you know
[1:22:09] i don't want to i i regret now saying my
[1:22:13] why did i let that come on me why did i
[1:22:15] not why did i not pay attention when i
[1:22:17] was young and now i have to have
[1:22:19] doctor's intervention i got to have
[1:22:20] procedure now i got to have another
[1:22:22] procedure i got to do all these things
[1:22:23] because there's no there's no
[1:22:25] roto-rooter there's no drano to get that
[1:22:27] out
[1:22:28] all they can do is try to keep it from
[1:22:30] getting worse and they can open it up
[1:22:32] with the stents and things like that but
[1:22:34] but but there's regret within my life as
[1:22:36] much joy as i have that god that had
[1:22:39] medical science that could save my life
[1:22:40] or otherwise y'all had a different
[1:22:42] pastor but but i but but i do have a
[1:22:45] sense of regret and i said i've said to
[1:22:46] my sons and i said to my grandsons and i
[1:22:49] say to all you don't don't get there
[1:22:51] because you can't reverse it so while
[1:22:53] you're young and while you're healthy
[1:22:55] stay healthy
[1:22:57] and and make sure because i told my boys
[1:23:00] as you're aging you can't believe how
[1:23:01] hard that becomes and so you're you're
[1:23:04] healthy now stay that way because you
[1:23:05] can't reverse it
[1:23:09] you can improve your health you can
[1:23:10] improve your fitness but when it comes
[1:23:13] to cardiovascular blockages you can't
[1:23:15] reverse that
[1:23:17] he said i'm saying so so so many times
[1:23:20] i've seen in the spiritual world and
[1:23:22] people be so wonderfully gifted and so
[1:23:24] wonderfully talented and and they don't
[1:23:26] remove the hindrances in fact is they
[1:23:28] allow hindrances and satan fills up
[1:23:30] young people with hindrances and fills
[1:23:32] up homes with hindrances and fills up
[1:23:34] parents with hindrances say oh my well
[1:23:37] we're doing a pretty good job i don't
[1:23:38] deny that i don't i've already given you
[1:23:40] a medal for being a son and daughter of
[1:23:42] god but i'm here to tell you if you want
[1:23:44] to really see the power of god moving
[1:23:47] all you have to do is get rid of
[1:23:49] hindrances
[1:23:51] that's what you say well based that on
[1:23:53] scripture easy paul said that we should
[1:23:56] run the race that we should lay aside
[1:23:58] lay aside those things that so easily
[1:24:02] hinder those things that so easily beset
[1:24:05] you and run that you may run this race i
[1:24:08] want to run this race
[1:24:12] see
[1:24:15] so when you become willing to remove
[1:24:17] hindrances from your life when you're
[1:24:18] willing to take up the responsibility
[1:24:22] of emptying out
[1:24:24] then divine power will take it from
[1:24:26] there
[1:24:28] just like divine healing built into my
[1:24:30] body took over once they removed the
[1:24:32] hindrances that's all i needed to do
[1:24:34] see and i i thought to myself that god
[1:24:37] takes the best things out of our control
[1:24:39] and it's a good thing
[1:24:40] i because i don't have to spend one
[1:24:43] minute
[1:24:44] regulating
[1:24:46] the functions
[1:24:47] of my body i don't have to make the
[1:24:50] divine healing work
[1:24:51] you understand it just works
[1:24:54] because god put it in me
[1:24:55] and so all i all i need to do is
[1:24:58] regulate the intake
[1:25:02] physically emotionally mentally
[1:25:05] spiritually regulate the intake
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:10] and exercise and that's why that's why
[1:25:12] the bible would say we're to exercise
[1:25:13] our faith you don't exercise your faith
[1:25:15] if you don't have a prayer life
[1:25:17] you never do
[1:25:18] you never do come into church coming to
[1:25:20] church friends is is where it's a house
[1:25:22] of correction you get corrected you get
[1:25:24] you learn about god you learn about the
[1:25:25] bible but i'm here to tell you something
[1:25:27] prayer is where you have the
[1:25:28] relationship
[1:25:31] and it's it's very amazing how that
[1:25:34] that that that brother branham talks
[1:25:36] about prayer
[1:25:37] and i i could go into so many examples
[1:25:39] today
[1:25:40] that prayer to a prophet was not some
[1:25:43] willingly thing it was not just saying a
[1:25:45] prayer that's almost become a cliche
[1:25:48] that's almost like you know
[1:25:50] be blessed
[1:25:52] have a nice day say a prayer
[1:25:55] and brother ram said christians don't
[1:25:57] say prayers catholics do that
[1:25:59] they say prayers we pray
[1:26:02] it's a big difference
[1:26:03] see
[1:26:04] and but the whole world is say a prayer
[1:26:06] for me you know you know uh you pass
[1:26:09] somebody yes be blessed what does that
[1:26:11] even mean okay you want me to be blessed
[1:26:12] so explain to me how do you want me to
[1:26:14] be blessed
[1:26:16] you know
[1:26:17] i'd like for you to be blessed too let
[1:26:18] me tell you how you need to you need to
[1:26:20] go home and clean up and become a real
[1:26:22] lady become a real man become a real
[1:26:24] gentleman give your heart to god repent
[1:26:26] of your sins get the holy ghost and then
[1:26:28] you'll be blessed
[1:26:30] then you'll be blessed
[1:26:32] there's no way god can bless disorder
[1:26:35] god doesn't do that he's not santa claus
[1:26:38] see
[1:26:39] and so
[1:26:40] so we find out that when you're willing
[1:26:42] to take the responsibility
[1:26:44] and empty out then divine power takes it
[1:26:47] from there and and and and when you
[1:26:50] establish order
[1:26:52] in your life
[1:26:53] then that's what god can get behind and
[1:26:57] so
[1:26:58] and that's exactly why the natural types
[1:27:00] of spiritual it's always the natural
[1:27:01] typing the spiritual it's never the
[1:27:03] other way around because the spiritual
[1:27:04] is the more real
[1:27:05] you see the natural's just a shadow
[1:27:08] so the premise of life from genesis i'm
[1:27:10] i'm i'm gonna hit my pause place here in
[1:27:13] just a few minutes you okay
[1:27:15] you okay
[1:27:16] okay
[1:27:17] i've only been going about 50 minutes
[1:27:19] so
[1:27:20] let me get these last 10 and i'll we'll
[1:27:22] push paul's stan pull the chute and jump
[1:27:25] out
[1:27:26] or jump out and pull the chute
[1:27:29] you know don't open the chute in the in
[1:27:31] the plane
[1:27:35] so the premise of life is built on the
[1:27:38] foundation that you made of every tree
[1:27:40] for sustaining your life for your youth
[1:27:43] to renew itself
[1:27:44] daily and this friends this is exactly
[1:27:47] why his mercies are new every morning
[1:27:51] and you should avail yourselves every
[1:27:53] morning of those new mercies don't pass
[1:27:55] them my goodness you're going to need
[1:27:56] them
[1:27:57] see brother branham would talk about
[1:27:59] prayer
[1:28:00] you know when uh
[1:28:02] when the when welch evans come to him
[1:28:05] and he is his car is stolen
[1:28:08] and brother branham
[1:28:10] didn't say well brother welch let's say
[1:28:12] a prayer
[1:28:14] no he said well now let's pray
[1:28:16] and if you go read the testimony you
[1:28:18] know what you're going to find brother
[1:28:20] branham thought this through he this
[1:28:22] wasn't just lord we we we love you thou
[1:28:25] great illuminating father and we hope
[1:28:27] you'll give his car back to him brother
[1:28:29] branham actually got down and presented
[1:28:32] a case
[1:28:33] he realized that on his knees he was in
[1:28:36] the throne room of god suddenly and
[1:28:39] that's where prayer takes you
[1:28:42] if you don't you know that this is often
[1:28:45] times why husbands
[1:28:47] don't treat their wives correctly
[1:28:48] because they don't they don't understand
[1:28:50] the husband wife because they don't have
[1:28:51] relationship with christ in prayer
[1:28:54] and and that's why sometimes wives don't
[1:28:56] reverence their husbands that's why
[1:28:58] homes get out of water a lot of times
[1:29:00] that's why you get homes where you know
[1:29:02] the wife is the spiritual leader which
[1:29:03] is upside down as brim or brother
[1:29:05] abraham brothers remember brother
[1:29:06] abraham teaching us that
[1:29:08] how many men are not ashamed to raise
[1:29:09] your hand remember their brother abraham
[1:29:11] was teaching us that
[1:29:13] and he takes deborah in the bible and he
[1:29:15] shows us how that you know why why did
[1:29:17] god have to have a woman
[1:29:19] because he you know why why isn't there
[1:29:21] a man somewhere that he can follow the
[1:29:23] order of his word with and and he's got
[1:29:26] to have a woman now she's not leading
[1:29:28] the church god there's a woman trying to
[1:29:29] say that to brother brandon said no
[1:29:30] that's politics deborah wasn't leading
[1:29:33] the church
[1:29:34] that but she was in politics and these
[1:29:36] men come to her and she and she's the
[1:29:38] daughter of god and she gives them a a a
[1:29:40] a prophecy
[1:29:41] and you're going to have victory go
[1:29:43] fight them go kill them that's the enemy
[1:29:44] and they said okay we'll do it but not
[1:29:45] let you go with us
[1:29:47] and here's men afraid to go into battle
[1:29:48] as the woman's leading
[1:29:50] them brother abraham broke it down how
[1:29:53] that that's an upside down home
[1:29:55] i'm here to tell you something brothers
[1:29:56] you're the spiritual head of your home
[1:29:58] not your wife and it's a shame on you if
[1:30:01] she has to be and i've seen i've seen
[1:30:03] too many sisters forced into that role
[1:30:06] and they're not designed for it and
[1:30:08] they're and they're gonna misguide the
[1:30:09] family and i've seen families run it run
[1:30:11] run shipwreck here and go over here and
[1:30:13] get shipwrecked here and go get
[1:30:15] shipwrecked here because a woman is not
[1:30:17] designed to do that i'm not saying she's
[1:30:19] not smarter
[1:30:21] a lot of times she's smarter in many
[1:30:23] things than the man which is why he's
[1:30:25] kind of crazy to not to not take her
[1:30:27] advice a lot of times
[1:30:29] i think a man's ridiculous that thinks
[1:30:31] he can figure everything out for himself
[1:30:33] why'd god she's got the other half of
[1:30:34] your wisdom man
[1:30:37] you're you're running to half speed are
[1:30:38] you kidding me and you think you can
[1:30:40] make the best choice and she's just
[1:30:41] nobody well that's stupid i'm sorry
[1:30:43] children i'm sorry sorry mothers i
[1:30:46] didn't mean to use that word
[1:30:48] i'm so sorry
[1:30:50] i don't want to get on a roll but but
[1:30:52] but but but i'm trying this is what
[1:30:54] brother abraham was showing us brothers
[1:30:56] we need to have spiritual men
[1:30:58] who know how to pray who know how to
[1:31:00] lead a family who i want to tell you
[1:31:02] something as i've said to you before and
[1:31:04] brother branham says it on tape if
[1:31:06] you'll be in abraham she'll be a sarah
[1:31:09] but he said if he won't be how can she
[1:31:12] see so we need strong men warriors of
[1:31:15] faith and warriors of prayer who take
[1:31:17] the word of god and take the leadership
[1:31:20] and take the responsibility and remove
[1:31:22] hindrances from the whole
[1:31:26] see
[1:31:27] it it's it otherwise it becomes upside
[1:31:29] down otherwise it becomes out of order
[1:31:31] and god can't bless it even if your
[1:31:33] principle is right even if your doctrine
[1:31:35] is right even if what you're saying is
[1:31:37] right if you're if it's a woman leading
[1:31:39] it then it's out of water it's contrary
[1:31:41] to god's word and there's no way god can
[1:31:44] get behind that
[1:31:46] anything that's a direct tape quote
[1:31:49] anything
[1:31:50] is there anything outside of anything
[1:31:53] anything would include everything
[1:31:57] am am i wrong
[1:32:00] anything
[1:32:01] outside of the line and order of god's
[1:32:04] word will fail
[1:32:07] that's thus saith the lord that's a
[1:32:09] prophet it will
[1:32:11] fail it has to fail because god can't
[1:32:14] bless disorder
[1:32:17] and so brother branham gets down
[1:32:19] now here's an example for you brothers
[1:32:22] he gets down
[1:32:24] on his knees
[1:32:25] and he gathers the brother with him
[1:32:27] and he starts to build a case and he
[1:32:29] says he doesn't just say oh in jesus

[1:34:42] to fish and enjoy nature and the devil
[1:34:44] has come and now my brother's laying
[1:34:46] here in agony and i mean brother branham
[1:34:48] goes into this whole deep narrative
[1:34:50] telling god everything he already knows
[1:34:52] and and now lord we we
[1:34:54] we kind of have an emergency and what we
[1:34:56] need you we need you to come like right
[1:34:58] now right now

[1:35:05] kind of like an emergency i need you to
[1:35:07] come right now
[1:35:08] and brother branham goes into this
[1:35:10] detail and he says when he when he
[1:35:12] opened his eyes he said the brother's
[1:35:14] laughing at him said brother bill he
[1:35:16] said even the pain is gone
[1:35:18] even the pain is gone and just like that
[1:35:21] god kept his promise they'll take up
[1:35:24] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:35:25] thing it won't even hurt them but i'm
[1:35:27] here to tell you it took a man who knew
[1:35:29] how to pray it took a man who knew how
[1:35:31] to approach the throne of god it took a
[1:35:33] man who had spent a lifetime moving
[1:35:36] hindrances out of his life so the so the
[1:35:39] anointing could flow so the spirituality
[1:35:42] could could saturate his mind he could
[1:35:44] speak according to the word of god i'm
[1:35:46] here to tell you friends the world is is
[1:35:48] burning down around us and it's ready
[1:35:50] for a tribulation and a bride is ready
[1:35:52] to go home but while we're here god
[1:35:55] wants victory in my life and he wants
[1:35:57] victory in your life and he has released
[1:36:00] a healing to his bride
[1:36:04] the world is in a sickness
[1:36:07] it's in a disease a state of disease
[1:36:11] and
[1:36:12] and insanity and
[1:36:14] it's all neurotic and gone crazy and
[1:36:16] there's everything's upside down and
[1:36:19] families are blown apart and kids you
[1:36:22] know seven eight years old don't even
[1:36:23] know if they're a boy or a girl and and
[1:36:26] and and the sanctity of marriage is gone
[1:36:28] and and everybody's dismissing god the
[1:36:31] only one who can help
[1:36:35] the book of revelation said they would
[1:36:36] do that see
[1:36:42] so from that perfect life
[1:36:45] we come to the end of
[1:36:48] six thousand years of human history
[1:36:51] from genesis to revelation
[1:36:55] and the earth is ready now
[1:36:57] to plunge into judgment
[1:37:00] it's ready to renew itself
[1:37:03] and there's a
[1:37:04] the the earth is saturated with
[1:37:08] voices
[1:37:10] so many
[1:37:11] talking heads and
[1:37:13] so much
[1:37:14] polarization and
[1:37:16] and nobody's even listening anymore and
[1:37:18] man has just gone crazy
[1:37:21] and you know the whole atmosphere is
[1:37:24] is just saturated with opinions and
[1:37:27] and you know when god decided to send a
[1:37:29] voice into the earth to sin
[1:37:32] now i'm not talking about the gospel
[1:37:33] trumpet the gospel trumpet john said i
[1:37:35] heard one speaking sounded like a
[1:37:36] trumpet
[1:37:38] to the whole world
[1:37:40] moses on mount sinai
[1:37:42] you know the bible says
[1:37:44] the trumpet sounded and it whacks louder
[1:37:47] and louder and louder so i'm not talking
[1:37:49] about that i'm talking about that that
[1:37:51] when moses
[1:37:53] met him personally
[1:37:56] at the burning bush
[1:37:58] god didn't god didn't shout at distance
[1:38:01] hey come up here
[1:38:04] moses actually saw it and said i will
[1:38:07] turn aside and i will go see
[1:38:10] and by the time he got there it's not
[1:38:12] loud it's not shouting nobody down
[1:38:14] through the canyon nobody's still
[1:38:15] hearing it it's not a trumpet blast it's
[1:38:17] god saying no moses
[1:38:19] you're coming near don't come near until
[1:38:21] you take your shoes off this is holy
[1:38:23] ground
[1:38:24] which meant moses is coming near
[1:38:27] see
[1:38:27] and so it's it shows how it i mean
[1:38:31] elijah knew to wait for it when god
[1:38:33] when god
[1:38:35] god's remedy
[1:38:37] in a world
[1:38:38] where everybody's shouting
[1:38:41] and voices of every kind to give you
[1:38:43] your opinion they ask you a question and
[1:38:45] give you your answer
[1:38:47] to which i tell them you can ask me the
[1:38:48] question but you don't get to give me my
[1:38:50] answer
[1:38:51] you want to know what i think i will
[1:38:52] tell you but don't ask me and give me my
[1:38:55] give me my answer
[1:38:56] i've had people try to do that in my in
[1:38:58] my office coming for council and they
[1:38:59] give me a question and tell me the
[1:39:00] answer like why why are you here
[1:39:04] you know i already know you don't want
[1:39:05] to hear my answer you got your own
[1:39:08] and i know where this is going to go i
[1:39:09] know it's going to go 30 years have
[1:39:10] taught me where that's going to go
[1:39:12] i've seen it too many times i've never
[1:39:14] i've never seen it fail
[1:39:16] where people can't humble themselves
[1:39:18] as as paul talks about you know
[1:39:21] you know that
[1:39:23] don't don't make it and i'm paraphrasing
[1:39:24] the scripture don't make it hard
[1:39:26] on the ministry who god has put over you
[1:39:28] don't be worrisome to them
[1:39:30] humble yourself submit god has put them
[1:39:32] there for your soul
[1:39:33] god has put them there to guide you
[1:39:35] see and and and and and so i mean if if
[1:39:39] you're if you're going to be your own
[1:39:40] pastor why do you need one
[1:39:44] see
[1:39:45] so so so and i'm not even preaching on
[1:39:48] that today i'm just trying to i'm trying
[1:39:49] to get us to remove hindrances
[1:39:52] and some of the some of the let me tell
[1:39:54] you something friends some of the you
[1:39:56] know
[1:39:57] i i just i i
[1:39:59] i hate to think that
[1:40:01] you know your greatest hindrance lives
[1:40:03] between your two ears
[1:40:08] seen that too many times
[1:40:10] you know and that's not the way god
[1:40:12] designed our lives to be
[1:40:14] so
[1:40:15] you've got all these loud voices but
[1:40:17] when god brought his voice he brought it
[1:40:20] small and still by design
[1:40:24] elijah knew to wait on that
[1:40:27] and there's something to be said about
[1:40:29] having your spiritual sensitivity
[1:40:32] so unhindered
[1:40:34] so unshacked so unpoisoned
[1:40:39] say i i can't hardly hear god oh well
[1:40:42] get all the toxins out
[1:40:44] say well i'd like to do that but every
[1:40:46] time i every time i repent uh they come
[1:40:49] back to me well then get what's bringing
[1:40:51] them out
[1:40:54] get what you're feeding on this ain't
[1:40:55] rocket science
[1:40:57] get what you're feeding on out
[1:40:59] and it'll stop re-poisoning you how many
[1:41:01] i i mean i've experienced that where i
[1:41:04] went to the lord and the lord delivered
[1:41:06] me and i was free and then found myself
[1:41:08] back sometime later asking for the same
[1:41:10] thing and the lord just like you know
[1:41:12] this is gonna keep happening until you
[1:41:14] get that gone
[1:41:18] and that's where we are precious friends
[1:41:20] this this 21st century is full of stuff
[1:41:23] that poisons your spirit and your mind
[1:41:26] and your children and and don't don't
[1:41:28] think they'll be okay they won't be okay
[1:41:31] you're not okay
[1:41:33] and we'll never be okay as a church we
[1:41:35] gotta i just say let's take a stand for
[1:41:38] god's word and let's be real christians
[1:41:41] let's be real believers and then we can
[1:41:44] go to god and it doesn't matter nothing
[1:41:46] can stand in the way of our prayer
[1:41:48] [Applause]
[1:41:51] but we move these hindrances and then
[1:41:53] god can speak
[1:41:58] draw not an nigh hither
[1:42:01] put off thy
[1:42:03] shoes from thy feet
[1:42:05] let me give you this and i'll stop
[1:42:07] anthony come bring your team
[1:42:10] brother anthony
[1:42:14] this word nigh
[1:42:17] draw not nigh
[1:42:18] hither
[1:42:20] this is of course an action word it's a
[1:42:22] verb meaning
[1:42:24] to come near
[1:42:27] or to approach
[1:42:29] now don't let your attention this is
[1:42:31] just brothers and sisters coming to
[1:42:32] their instruments it's not a eighth
[1:42:34] wonder of the world okay
[1:42:36] pay attention
[1:42:39] it means to
[1:42:40] draw near
[1:42:42] it means to approach the basic concept
[1:42:46] of drawing nigh is
[1:42:48] is close
[1:42:50] spatial proximity of the subject
[1:42:54] and the object
[1:42:58] and although it is also possible
[1:43:01] for this word to introduce actual
[1:43:03] contact
[1:43:06] the the verb is also used in a temporal
[1:43:08] context to indicate the imminence of
[1:43:10] some event
[1:43:12] and i if there was ever a time when i
[1:43:15] can say to you there's an event that is
[1:43:18] imminent
[1:43:19] the the coming of the lord is imminent
[1:43:22] it's upon us
[1:43:24] if there was ever a time when you need
[1:43:26] to draw nigh and his promise is if
[1:43:29] you'll draw nigh to me i'll draw nigh to
[1:43:32] you could you think of anything better
[1:43:35] than to have a subject which is you and
[1:43:38] an object which is god coming together
[1:43:41] hallelujah friends that's the that's the
[1:43:43] real burden of my heart for today that
[1:43:46] god has sent a healing god has sent a
[1:43:48] remedy and what's it to do is it to
[1:43:51] teach you more doctrine no it's not
[1:43:53] limited to that is it to make you have
[1:43:54] better theology no it's not it's not all
[1:43:57] about that it's about an invisible union
[1:43:59] it's about a closeness it's about a it's
[1:44:01] about a a subject and an object coming
[1:44:05] together how many want to draw nigh unto
[1:44:08] him there's there's there's no way that
[1:44:11] that that is going to work alongside of
[1:44:14] hindrances and so i want to say to you
[1:44:16] today take the medicine take the healing
[1:44:18] get rid of the hindrances let god
[1:44:21] restore and renew and strengthen and
[1:44:23] build up your faith and exercise it
[1:44:26] thereof
[1:44:28] this is what god has offered to you and
[1:44:31] i
[1:44:32] even in a world
[1:44:34] that has gone completely
[1:44:36] and totally and effectively insane
[1:44:41] stand with me
[1:44:43] a world that has went
[1:44:45] off a cliff
[1:44:47] and over the edge
[1:44:50] and don't forget my
[1:44:52] my very beginning to show you that
[1:44:54] satan's whole motive and objective
[1:44:57] is to displace
[1:45:00] the holy spirit in your life
[1:45:04] you remember that today when you leave
[1:45:05] here when you go home when you get up
[1:45:07] tomorrow on the job when you go into
[1:45:09] schools or to the market or to the work
[1:45:10] or wherever you go
[1:45:12] you just remember that satan
[1:45:14] has a beat on you
[1:45:16] and he's his whole attempt
[1:45:19] is to displace
[1:45:20] god from the throne room of your heart
[1:45:24] so that he can have preeminence and
[1:45:26] that's why brother branham would say
[1:45:28] however much you're willing to empty out
[1:45:31] he said god is willing to come in and
[1:45:35] fill that place
[1:45:39] i i'm so glad i can come here today
[1:45:43] and though we can
[1:45:44] paint a dismal picture of the world
[1:45:47] i can tell you there's healing
[1:45:50] there's a medicine
[1:45:52] there's a medicine that not only can
[1:45:54] heal you but it has the power to
[1:45:56] inoculate you from further infection
[1:45:59] oh my i wish they had a wish they had a
[1:46:01] vaccination like this one
[1:46:03] my this one is free
[1:46:06] hallelujah and it works every time and
[1:46:09] it works for your whole life
[1:46:11] if you'll follow its principles
[1:46:14] if you will if you'll remove hindrances
[1:46:16] from your life it'll work automatically
[1:46:19] because this is an omnipotent your gene
[1:46:23] is an omnipotent and that's why brother
[1:46:25] branham said it's two omnipotents meet
[1:46:28] and when that happens friend life life
[1:46:30] comes forth is that what you want today
[1:46:33] amen bow your heads with me
[1:46:35] as we pray and
[1:46:37] i'm just gonna have to pause there's so
[1:46:38] much more to be said lord
[1:46:43] i thank you for your word today and as i
[1:46:47] stand here lord in the pulpit
[1:46:49] at this present moment standing here
[1:46:52] i feel
[1:46:53] satisfied
[1:46:55] that we can stop right here
[1:46:57] i feel satisfied that enough has been
[1:47:00] said
[1:47:01] i feel satisfied in what was said
[1:47:04] now i when i say i feel satisfied lord i
[1:47:08] feel
[1:47:09] your satisfaction in it all
[1:47:12] that therefore i'm satisfied if i didn't
[1:47:14] feel you were satisfied i wouldn't be
[1:47:16] satisfied
[1:47:18] but lord i feel that everything that was
[1:47:21] said today
[1:47:23] was set under the unction of the holy
[1:47:24] spirit
[1:47:26] and i'm quite positive that you always
[1:47:28] do you're always
[1:47:29] dealing with things that even i have no
[1:47:31] idea even why it said or
[1:47:33] barely remember what i said somebody
[1:47:34] said why did you say this i said i don't
[1:47:36] know okay well tell me what i said
[1:47:38] and then even when i hear what i said
[1:47:40] i'm not even
[1:47:41] remember why i said it
[1:47:43] lord but i know that you're a god in
[1:47:45] charge of all of our lives and you
[1:47:48] understand that the real
[1:47:50] me
[1:47:52] boy am i glad for that
[1:47:54] you understand the real me so lord it's
[1:47:58] quite an easy thing for me just to throw
[1:48:00] up my hands and say lord just take over
[1:48:03] just take over because you know me
[1:48:05] better than me you know me better than
[1:48:06] anybody you know what i need you know
[1:48:09] what i'm missing you know what i'm
[1:48:10] slacking you know what you know what my
[1:48:12] strengths are my weaknesses are my gifts
[1:48:13] are my talents are you build me i'm
[1:48:16] curiously made by you so lord why why
[1:48:19] would i not surrender my life to the
[1:48:21] all-knowing all-seeing all-powerful
[1:48:23] being
[1:48:24] who is the genesis of it all
[1:48:27] i commit myself to you today i commit
[1:48:28] this audience
[1:48:30] i commit the invisible audience who
[1:48:32] we're listening today i commit us all
[1:48:34] men and women married and single young
[1:48:36] and old
[1:48:37] father all throughout throughout
[1:48:39] everyone under the sound of my voice
[1:48:41] lord now
[1:48:43] all i can do is put the word out there
[1:48:45] follow your leading and drop the word
[1:48:47] lord as the as boaz in the image of in
[1:48:51] the in the uh the bible imagery of
[1:48:53] christ said to the servants drop
[1:48:55] handfuls of purpose for for ruth lord
[1:48:58] that's all i've done today at your
[1:49:00] command i've dropped these handfuls of
[1:49:02] purpose for your children but lord now
[1:49:04] you're the one who it was boaz who drew
[1:49:07] her into the tent it was boaz who
[1:49:09] reached her parched corn from his hand
[1:49:12] to her hand so lord now i pray that
[1:49:15] today you'll take the word that was said
[1:49:18] i feel satisfied in my heart that it was
[1:49:20] you i committed to you now in jesus
[1:49:23] christ's name amen amen you love the
[1:49:26] lord

[1:52:19] upside down thinking
[1:52:21] and and and and we're here to say
[1:52:24] to humble ourselves brother branham
[1:52:26] talks about that the
[1:52:28] that the real spirit
[1:52:30] that's all that's that's to be on his
[1:52:32] family at the end time you know what it
[1:52:34] is you know where it starts is to say
[1:52:36] i'm wrong
[1:52:38] i'm wrong
[1:52:40] that's the quickest way to get god's
[1:52:43] attention is when you will raise your
[1:52:45] hands in his presence and say lord i'm
[1:52:47] wrong and i've been wrong and i don't
[1:52:50] want to be wrong
[1:52:52] hallelujah friends
[1:52:54] oh as paul said you did run well
[1:52:57] what hindered you
[1:52:58] you did run well galatians what hindered
[1:53:01] you who bewitched you that you've left
[1:53:04] these principles that i saved your life
[1:53:06] on
[1:53:07] oh you want to raise up those hands
[1:53:09] today and say lord i'm i've been wrong
[1:53:11] and i don't want to be wrong i want to
[1:53:13] be right
[1:53:14] i want to have your blessing on my life
[1:53:17] i want to remove the hindrances from my
[1:53:19] life i want to march forward in victory
[1:53:21] i want to forget what i think and forget
[1:53:24] forget what the devil says and and lord
[1:53:26] dismiss those things from my mind and
[1:53:29] think on your word and think on your
[1:53:30] promise and think on the healing
[1:53:34] that you have given in this day lord
[1:53:37] that healing
[1:53:39] can only help those people
[1:53:40] who will take it
[1:53:43] if they won't take the medication then
[1:53:45] they can't get the benefits
[1:53:47] and brother brandon would say father he
[1:53:49] would say people say
[1:53:51] oh i said brother branham i took the
[1:53:53] medicine he said no you didn't
[1:53:55] oh no i did i know i no you didn't he
[1:53:58] said because i happen to know that the
[1:54:00] medicine cures that problem and i still
[1:54:02] see you with the same problem i know you
[1:54:04] didn't take it
[1:54:07] so father help us today
