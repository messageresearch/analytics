[32:04] Even when it feels like I'm surrounded,
[32:12] you will never [music]
[32:14] leave my [singing] side.
[32:18] Oh,
[32:20] [music]
[32:22] nobody loves me like [music] you love
[32:26] me, Jesus.
[32:30] I stand in all [music] of your amazing
[32:35] ways.
[32:37] [music] I worship you as long as I am
[32:42] breathing.
[32:44] God, you are faithful
[32:46] [singing and music]
[32:46] and true. Nobody loves me [singing] like
[32:50] you. Nobody loves me like you [music]
[32:55] love me, Jesus.
[32:59] I stand in all [singing]
[33:01] your amazing
[33:04] [music] ways.
[33:06] I worship you as [singing] long as I am
[33:11] [music] breathing.
[33:13] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[33:18] loves me like [music] you. I worship you
[33:22] as long as I [music] am breathing.
[33:28] God, you are faithful [singing] and
[33:30] true. Nobody loves [music] me like you.
[33:37] Give the Lord a great big hand. Amen.
[33:39] [music]
[33:40] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[33:42] Hallelujah. Amen. We have another
[33:45] special. You can be [music] seated this
[33:46] morning. Brother John, could you come?
[33:48] Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; More of that.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Going to try this one. I had a request
[34:03] to sing it.
[34:10] Brother Andrew is going to help me out.
[34:19] By the way, the land is laying. I think
[34:24] I'd be safe in saying
[34:28] that over the next hill we'll be home.
[34:37] It's a straight and narrow highway with
[34:41] no detours and no byways. [music] And
[34:46] over [singing] the next hill we'll be
[34:50] home.
[34:56] [music]
[35:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:23] [music]
[35:28] &gt;&gt; by our prophet. I've been hearing. I
[35:32] would say the end is nearing.
[35:36] For I see familiar landmarks all along.
[35:45] By the dream that I've been dreaming,
[35:49] there will come a great redeeming.
[35:54] And over [singing]
[35:55] the [music] next heel will be home.
[36:01] Oh, by the turn the tide is taken. I
[36:06] would say that there's no mistaking
[36:11] that [music] over the next hill will be
[36:15] home.
[36:19] There's a place [music] that we are
[36:22] nearing that so many have been fearing.
[36:28] And [music and singing] over the next
[36:30] hill
[36:32] will be home.
[36:35] Now, when we get there, we're believing
[36:40] that [music] we'll find that [singing]
[36:42] gate is open and there'll be a refuge
[36:47] from the [singing] coming storm.
[36:53] For this way's [music] been long and
[36:56] weary, but at last the end is nearing.
[37:02] And [music and singing]
[37:03] over the next hill will behold.
[37:09] Oh, and over [music] the next hill will
[37:15] behold.
[37:20] Amen. Let's all stand to our feet.
[37:24] Jesus, draw me close. KF, brother Andy,
[37:26] you ready for the word? Amen. How many
[37:28] come with an expectation that the Lord's
[37:29] going to speak to you? Why don't you
[37:31] raise a hand? Show me that. Show the
[37:32] Lord that. Say, Lord, I came today not
[37:35] just to see or to be seen, but I came to
[37:37] hear from heaven. Amen. Let's sing this
[37:40] as we invite our pastor to come. Jesus,
[37:43] draw [singing]
[37:45] me close,
[37:47] closer,
[37:49] closer, Lord, [singing and music]
[37:52] to you.
[37:56] And let [singing]
[37:58] the world [music]
[38:00] around me [snorts] fade
[38:04] away. [music]
[38:07] [singing]
[38:10] [music] Oh Jesus, draw [singing] me
[38:14] close
[38:18] closer [music and singing]

[38:45] [music] closeer, [singing]
[38:47] Lord, to you.
[38:52] And let [music] this world [singing]
[38:55] around me, let it fade [music]
[38:59] away.
[39:02] [music]
[39:04] Oh

[39:09] me closer. Is that your prayer? Oh,
[39:13] closer
[39:14] [music]
[39:15] every day [singing]
[39:19] for I desire
[39:22] to worship her. [music and singing]
[39:26] Oh, why don't you raise your hands to
[39:27] the Lord now? Sing it like a prayer just
[39:30] before the word. Oh [music and singing]
[39:32] my Jesus, draw me close,
[39:40] closer, [music and singing] Lord, to
[39:43] you.
[39:46] And [music] let this world [singing]
[39:49] around me fade [music]
[39:53] away.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; [music]
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, [singing]
[40:01] draw me close closer every day. [music]
[40:06] Oh, closer
[40:08] every
[40:10] day. [singing]

[40:13] For I desire,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; I desire
[40:16] [music] to worship.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's beautiful.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Sing it again. Amen. [music] Jesus, draw
[40:24] me close.
[40:27] Jesus.
[40:29] [singing]
[40:32] [music]
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, come Lord to you.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, let [music]
[40:42] this world
[40:44] around me fade [music]
[40:48] away.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, draw me close
[40:58] [music and singing]
[41:00] closer every day. Closer [music] every
[41:04] [singing] day.
[41:06] Here it is. For I desire
[41:11] to [music] worship you and
[41:16] obey. Give the Lord a hand this morning.
[41:19] Amen. [music and applause]
[41:24] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. God
[41:27] bless you today. Happy to have you in
[41:29] the house of the Lord. Amen. I heard
[41:32] some glad tidings being announced out
[41:33] here and some wonderful singing. And
[41:36] you're [clears throat] right. I'm about
[41:37] to become officially great.
[41:40] [laughter]
[41:42] And Sister Jean is about to be double
[41:44] great. [snorts] Amen. [clears throat]
[41:47] Praise the Lord. So, uh, we're happy for
[41:49] that. I my you know when my dad first
[41:53] became great grandpa and I told him I
[41:55] said dad you're a great grandpa. He said
[41:56] well I always knew I was great. Now I've
[41:58] got the evidence.
[42:01] Amen. And so we're [clears throat] happy
[42:03] for those announcements and um [cough]
[42:06] Amen. And happy to have uh brother David
[42:09] Sister and Andrea here with us. Amen.
[42:11] Amen. Happy to have them here. and we
[42:13] had a wonderful joyous time last night
[42:16] [clears throat] and got to see the the
[42:18] video replay of it all. It all turned
[42:20] out really nice and special. Amen. I
[42:23] told [clears throat]
[42:24] um you know the the family and I just
[42:27] kind tried to break it to them easy and
[42:30] um and and I said you know you're you're
[42:32] getting the the most rebellious
[42:34] granddaughter I have.
[42:37] And I said, she was the first one that I
[42:39] made promise me at five years old she
[42:41] would stop growing. And she promised me
[42:44] and she broke that. And when she got
[42:46] seven years old, I made her promise it
[42:48] again. And u she broke that one, too.
[42:50] And then at nine, she broke it. At 10,
[42:52] she broke it. And I finally gave up. I
[42:54] figured [laughter]
[42:56] her and Zoe and me were just going to
[42:58] keep growing. And all these boys. Amen.
[43:01] So, I'm glad to know that I get to start
[43:03] over. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:06] [clears throat]
[43:07] All right. I don't want to uh get too
[43:10] far down that today. I'll get talking
[43:12] about wonderful memories and Amen.
[43:15] Praise the Lord. We'll never get to our
[43:17] sermon. You love the Lord.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to invite you to
[43:21] Isaiah chapter 14. [clears throat]
[43:26] And we're going to carry on today. We're
[43:28] I'm circling back to my little
[43:31] miniseries on Lucifer's competing claim.
[43:36] [clears throat] And uh today would be
[43:37] the fourth installment I believe should
[43:39] be part four if I'm not mistaken. And I
[43:42] h have had these parts here.
[43:46] Um and I just I've had them all along.
[43:48] Just about everything I'm going to say
[43:50] today, I've had them all along. But
[43:52] somehow they're uh they just kept
[43:54] getting pushed back and pushed back. And
[43:57] so I just been waiting for the Lord. And
[43:58] we had a few sermons in between. Just
[44:01] been waiting for the Lord to allow me to
[44:02] go back, circle back, and kind of maybe
[44:05] today close out some of uh some of this
[44:08] thought here today. I've enjoyed it.
[44:11] Amen. I trust it's been a blessing to
[44:13] you as well.
[44:15] Amen.
[44:19] Isaiah 14 [clears throat] verse 12.
[44:24] We just catch 12, 13, and 14.
[44:28] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[44:31] Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[44:35] thou cut down to the ground, which dst
[44:38] weaken the nations? [clears throat]
[44:41] For thou hast said in thine heart, I
[44:44] will ascend into heaven.
[44:47] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[44:50] of God. I will sit also upon the mount
[44:55] of the congregation
[44:57] and the sides of the north.
[44:59] This is quite a list. I will ascend
[45:03] above the heights of the clouds.
[45:06] I will be like the most high.
[45:10] That's quite a lot.
[45:13] Let's pray. [clears throat]
[45:16] Father, we thank you for your word today
[45:18] and
[45:21] I now just focusing my mind. Lord, we
[45:25] have many friends here with us today and
[45:29] visitors and special events and how I
[45:32] would just love to talk a little while
[45:34] on that and the the great blessing that
[45:37] it all is to Sister [clears throat]
[45:39] Debbie and I to see how it's all
[45:40] unfolded. But if I do that, Lord, we'll
[45:43] go into the time that I owe to you and
[45:46] to your word. [clears throat] So
[45:48] there'll be plenty of time for that,
[45:49] Lord, in days to come. We're happy to
[45:52] have all of them gathered here with us
[45:54] today, Lord. And we're just trusting you
[45:57] now to take us into your word. And may
[46:00] we have a single focus for just a little
[46:02] while. The [clears throat] world will
[46:04] still be here, Lord. We'll still have
[46:07] the things that we've got to do tomorrow
[46:09] and next week. But how about Lord that
[46:11] we just take a little time, step off of
[46:13] the rat race of life and just listen to
[46:17] the word of God, Father, that it might
[46:19] instruct us and that it might help us,
[46:21] that it might strengthen us. We need the
[46:24] energy that the word gives us, Lord.
[46:26] Now, master, it's been quite a task for
[46:29] me to separate out everything that
[46:33] perhaps I wanted to include and
[46:36] narrowing it down to what I felt is what
[46:38] you want to say. So, we're just
[46:41] surrendering ourselves fresh to you this
[46:43] morning. And if there's yet parts that
[46:45] we don't get to today, well, we'll get
[46:48] to them in your good time. We commit it
[46:50] to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[46:54] you, friends. You can be seated.
[47:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to continue
[47:10] to have brother James and sister Faith
[47:12] with us as well. They're going to be
[47:13] here for a little while. So, journeying
[47:15] with us. Amen. And we'll do all that we
[47:18] can to keep them. Amen. [laughter]
[47:20] Praise the Lord. [snorts]
[47:24] When last we were
[47:26] covering this subject of Lucifer's
[47:28] competing claim, we spent a great deal
[47:31] of time contrasting it with the claim
[47:34] that God makes in the book of Revelation
[47:38] that there would come a new heavens and
[47:40] a new earth and that God himself would
[47:43] dwell with his people. We've noted in
[47:47] numerous [clears throat] at numerous
[47:48] points along the way, excuse my voice.
[47:51] I'll get I'll get blowed through it here
[47:53] in a minute,
[47:55] that [clears throat]
[47:56] that it was the first and only time that
[47:59] you see in the scripture where God would
[48:02] make that statement that God himself
[48:05] shall dwell. And brother Brandham makes
[48:08] a lot of reference to that about how
[48:10] that the earth, you know, is now a fit
[48:13] place because now everything has ran to
[48:17] its consummation.
[48:18] The the millennium is actually over in
[48:21] the new heavens and the new earth. The
[48:23] earth which lingered in its seventh day
[48:25] for a thousand-year millennial reign.
[48:27] And yet it was not in its eternal day
[48:30] [clears throat] until there would come a
[48:33] a a holy fire and you know that would
[48:37] rain out uh from heaven and we know that
[48:40] at the end of the millennium Satan would
[48:41] come and compass the camp of the
[48:43] redeemed. The Lord would raise them up
[48:45] upon the breath of the earth and rain
[48:47] down holy fire. And then there would
[48:49] come a judgment bar. And we can read
[48:51] about that in the book of Revelation. We
[48:54] can read how the the heavens departed
[48:56] like a scroll. The sea gives up its
[48:59] dead. The dead, both small and great,
[49:01] stand before the judge on the throne.
[49:04] The bride has taken her place with him
[49:06] on the throne. I think I mentioned
[49:09] [clears throat] last time it was either
[49:10] here in the pull pit or in my morning
[49:13] Bible study, online Bible study, I don't
[49:15] remember where, but I was talking about
[49:17] how that the bride uh need not worry
[49:21] that she won't be ready for that. She
[49:23] will have for a she will have been for a
[49:26] thousand years getting getting her seal
[49:29] legs under her and learning how to rule
[49:31] and reign and judge matters as nations
[49:34] are raised up in the millennial world.
[49:37] There's a lot of that that we don't
[49:38] know. There's still a lot of it that's
[49:40] am uh I don't want to say ambiguous.
[49:42] That's probably the wrong word, but
[49:44] there's some of it left um just untold.
[49:46] And brother Brandham said it's a it's a
[49:48] honeymoon. And so he doesn't tell us
[49:50] everything about it. doesn't give us
[49:52] every detail, but we know it's going to
[49:54] be great.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; We know troubles are going to be over.
[49:58] We know we won't weep anymore. We know
[50:01] uh I know that I'll have a glorified
[50:03] body. I'll have a body liken unto his
[50:05] glorified body. And uh you know, just as
[50:08] a as a student of the scripture and
[50:10] studying these things, you know, I don't
[50:13] I don't fully know if everyone in the
[50:15] nations will have that glorified body.
[50:18] Um um I don't know the answer to that.
[50:20] And brother Brandham uh doesn't make
[50:22] that clear himself. In fact, it's when
[50:24] he's asked some of those questions, he
[50:26] actually admits that he doesn't know it
[50:28] himself. And that's where he comes to
[50:31] that statement that he doesn't tell us
[50:32] everything. He said, "God doesn't tell
[50:34] his prophets everything." And then the
[50:36] prophets don't tell the people
[50:37] everything. So, so I I just wanna I just
[50:41] know I want to be there. Amen. I want to
[50:43] enjoy that. I And I just say, "Lord, let
[50:46] me uh you know, complete my assignment
[50:49] here, friends. I want to I want to run
[50:51] my race well. And I want to hear him
[50:53] say, "Well done, my good and faithful
[50:56] servant." And I'm glad that the only
[50:58] parts he'll see are the parts that I ran
[51:01] good. Amen. I'm glad that I won't have
[51:03] to worry about him saying, "Well done,
[51:05] except for no, because those things are
[51:08] all met in Christ. And when I arrive
[51:11] there to take my place on the throne, I
[51:13] won't I won't have to be, you know, the
[51:15] Bible tells us that that you don't want
[51:17] to be the one whose sins follow you to
[51:20] judgment because then you'll have to
[51:22] give an account for them at the judgment
[51:23] bar and there's no mercy. So there the
[51:26] mercy's over. So but you what you want
[51:29] to do is the one that be in the camp
[51:31] where your sins have went ahead of you
[51:33] to judgment and they've already been met
[51:35] in Christ. And when you arrive, it's
[51:37] already set. And here's your take your
[51:39] place on the throne. See, you're in seat
[51:42] 4,964.
[51:45] Row row Q and seat 4. Amen. Thank you.
[51:48] I'll be there. Amen. I don't know. I
[51:50] don't mean to bring it down to natural
[51:52] terms like that. We don't know what
[51:53] it'll be, but I just know it'll be
[51:55] grand. But when it finally when all of
[51:58] that washes out and and Satan is
[52:02] destroyed, Lucifer, his competing claim
[52:04] has been put to silence once and for all
[52:07] because don't forget he's still trying
[52:10] to pull this off at the end of the
[52:11] millennium.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; He still tries. He makes one final one
[52:14] final stab at it. See? [clears throat]
[52:17] And so, so when you when you think about
[52:19] all those things, and I don't want to
[52:21] get into the to the alleyways of all of
[52:23] that cuz we're not trying to teach on
[52:25] the book of Revelation today, but we've
[52:28] been looking long and hard at this
[52:30] competing claim of Lucifer that it is
[52:32] such a polar opposite of the claim that
[52:34] God makes that he would dwell with his
[52:37] people. And I I'm I'm glad the Lord's
[52:40] going to finally end that. I I'm glad
[52:42] he's going to finally put Lucifer, Amen,
[52:45] to the lake of fire. And then there the
[52:47] false prophet, the the anti the whole
[52:50] beast system uh you know even death and
[52:53] hell will be cast in uh and be
[52:57] completely annihilated. And God's the
[52:59] only one that can annihilate anything.
[53:01] He's the only thing that can he put it
[53:03] all together. So he's the only one that
[53:05] can really take it all apart. And
[53:06] brother Brandham said you can burn a
[53:08] piece of paper but you haven't
[53:10] annihilated it. All you've done is is re
[53:12] change it back to its original gases and
[53:14] and elements and cosmic elements that it
[53:17] was. And brother Ram said if time would
[53:19] go on long enough, I mean that could
[53:21] come back to paper again. It could come
[53:23] back as a tree and get harvested and get
[53:25] mil and become paper. Uh you know and
[53:28] and and and here in this life we have no
[53:31] continuing city. But we do seek one uh
[53:35] to come that won't have an end. and that
[53:38] and that you know when once that's once
[53:41] that's happened friends oh once we're
[53:44] gone in that third exodus I can give you
[53:47] this assurance you're never going to
[53:49] have to come back here to a broken world
[53:51] and do this again
[53:53] &gt;&gt; living in a fallen body and a broken
[53:55] world and Satan on the loose and the god
[53:58] of the evil age by popular demand he's
[54:01] the worship being I'm just glad that the
[54:03] Lord Jesus is going to put all of that
[54:06] under his feet forever.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; So, we we've been talking about the
[54:12] contrasting claims between the one that
[54:14] Satan would make and the one that Christ
[54:16] would make. And I want to zero in today
[54:19] on the fact as the prophet has taught us
[54:22] that Satan's attempt to ascend to the
[54:24] throne. Well, you can see it in the text
[54:26] we read, his attempt to ascend to the
[54:30] throne, to go above God through the
[54:33] bride. It goes through. He He's first
[54:36] got to get above the stars. See? Then
[54:38] he's got to take his his seat in the
[54:41] north. That's where God's throne is.
[54:42] Then he's got to be like the most high.
[54:45] And so you you understand that
[54:48] everything that he's doing, it's not
[54:49] about controlling the world. He already
[54:53] has control of the world. They've given
[54:54] him control.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; They've long ago the churches have
[54:58] kicked Christ out and seated control to
[55:00] the Antichrist system. And this is why
[55:02] you see the chaos in the world today and
[55:04] the madness on the streets and the
[55:06] hypocrisy and Christianity today and and
[55:09] and and you know it's just um it's um
[55:12] you you lose words. Uh you know I
[55:15] consider my vocabulary pretty rich being
[55:18] well read uh you know but but I I I come
[55:21] short of words. I don't know how to
[55:23] fully describe what, you know, when I
[55:26] see the the the blatant
[55:29] hypocrisy and nauseating blindness that
[55:32] it's I try not to I try not to let it
[55:34] affect me negatively because, you know,
[55:37] even brother Brandham was was cautioned
[55:39] by the Holy Spirit. you know, be careful
[55:42] who you're calling Rickys and Ricettas
[55:44] because I've got some people in there
[55:46] and and and and remember brother
[55:47] Brandham had the had the dream there
[55:49] where they're behind those bars and and
[55:51] that lady is saying, "Brother Brandham,
[55:53] you've misunderstood these people." And
[55:55] and so, you know, and they're and
[55:57] they're he said they're beating their
[55:58] heads against the bars and there stood
[56:01] Jesus at the top saying, "Deliver these
[56:03] people." And he thought, "How in the
[56:04] world? I'm with my little skinny arms
[56:06] and these big iron bars." But the Lord
[56:09] wasn't looking for him to use his
[56:11] physical might. The Lord was wanting him
[56:13] to have faith in the word of God. And on
[56:16] that alone and nothing else that would
[56:18] be needed is to bring the word of God.
[56:21] And that will set free God's people.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; All who can be set free will be set free
[56:28] by the word of God. I don't have to
[56:29] police you. I don't have to uh follow
[56:32] you home. I don't have to fly a drone
[56:34] around your house. I don't have to, you
[56:36] know, keep tabs on you. I come here and
[56:38] I preach the gospel. And I know that
[56:41] that for believers, the gospel, uh,
[56:44] Brother David and I were discussing this
[56:45] last night. The gospel that we see and
[56:48] we have today, isn't it true, friends?
[56:51] And I don't even have to convince you. I
[56:53] know you'll get what I'm about to say.
[56:55] When you hear that eagle scream and you
[56:58] hear this message and you see how it
[57:00] dovetales the scripture, it just you
[57:02] just there's something in you that goes,
[57:04] "Yeah, there's something in you." Even
[57:06] the parts you don't understand, there's
[57:09] still a part that just goes, "Amen. It's
[57:11] just right. That's just right. Well, how
[57:13] I explain how it's right. I'm not sure I
[57:15] can, but I know it's right." See, it's
[57:17] it's intrinsically right. It's uh and
[57:20] then and what you're what you're
[57:22] actually what's happening there in a in
[57:25] a realm that you can't see and the world
[57:27] can't see, God can see it. And that is
[57:30] that there's a deep calling to a deep
[57:32] and there's a gene of you responding to
[57:34] a gene in him. and that you realize you
[57:36] are a believer of the word because
[57:38] you're part of that word.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly why that you not only
[57:45] you don't obey it out of fear, you obey
[57:47] it out of because I want to obey it.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Because it's right and I want to be
[57:54] right.
[57:55] I cannot [clears throat] abide that, you
[57:58] know, and I know I'm not alone in that.
[58:00] A real believer, you cannot abide wrong.
[58:02] When you see it, you got to fix it. You
[58:04] have to fix it because the Lord is
[58:06] watching and the word is here and the
[58:09] word is here to bring you to perfection
[58:11] and there's no room for a believer to
[58:13] say I'm just going to get 80%. I'll I'll
[58:15] be comfortable right there. I will never
[58:17] be comfortable there.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; You see, and I and I and in as far as my
[58:21] wins and losses, I'm not sure I'm above
[58:23] 50%. But I know where my desire is. And
[58:27] I know a prophet told Sister Georgie.
[58:29] Bruce, God looks at your heart at what
[58:31] you want to be.
[58:35] I'm so glad for that.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; So, we found out that Satan's desire
[58:41] through the scriptures and the way
[58:43] brother Brandham describes it, and I
[58:44] don't have the time to go down all of
[58:46] the all of those quotes today,
[58:48] but Satan is desiring to ascend through
[58:51] you because he knows he cannot defeat
[58:55] Christ. He he's that's been tried.
[58:59] when Michael and fought with the dragon,
[59:02] Michael and his angels fought the dragon
[59:04] in the book of Revelation. Remember, he
[59:06] takes on titles Lucifer and Satan and
[59:09] that the dragon and and and you know and
[59:11] and and we we we talked about that last
[59:13] time. And so so he's already found out
[59:17] he cannot overthrow Michael with a
[59:19] direct frontal assault. But but somehow
[59:22] he was able to observe and we and I
[59:24] don't have all the answers to that today
[59:26] and brother Brandham doesn't lay it out
[59:27] and we're not dare going to go beyond
[59:29] what a prophet taught us. It's
[59:31] precarious to do that and it's not
[59:32] necessary. We have everything we need
[59:34] for our perfection in the message
[59:36] anyway. So I'm not out here to try to
[59:38] wow you with something. That's not what
[59:40] the gospel is about. The gospel is a
[59:42] person.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; It's not books and tapes and quotes.
[59:45] It's a person of Jesus Christ being
[59:47] revealed to God's people. And that is
[59:50] it. That's the attraction on the
[59:51] mountain.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; See,
[59:54] so so when we when we think about how
[59:58] that God is revealing himself in his
[1:00:00] word and and Satan knowing that his his
[1:00:04] best best pathway is to ascend through
[1:00:07] the bride. If he can defeat her, he
[1:00:09] defeats him because if she can't be
[1:00:12] perfected, his word is broken and then
[1:00:14] he has to seed authority. So this is
[1:00:17] what he tried in the book of Zechariah
[1:00:19] the third chapter. He tried to do that.
[1:00:21] Come into God's courtroom. Brought I um
[1:00:24] um brings the high priest there and and
[1:00:27] Joshua the high priest and is accusing
[1:00:31] the all of Israel. He doesn't need all
[1:00:33] of Israel standing there. See, Satan
[1:00:35] doesn't need to just Satan doesn't need
[1:00:38] um to defeat you. He needs to defeat
[1:00:41] Christ. See? And so Christ is your high
[1:00:44] priest. And and so therefore the the the
[1:00:47] charge was by bringing the high priest
[1:00:50] is you said and God seated on the
[1:00:53] throne. The judge is there. He's seated.
[1:00:55] Daniel saw him seated. And so the the
[1:00:58] act the accuser is there to accuse
[1:01:00] Israel. And to say, "Hey, judge, you
[1:01:03] said your word was these are your chosen
[1:01:05] people." But yet and you said they're
[1:01:08] the apple of your eye. You said they're
[1:01:09] perfect in all their ways. And and and
[1:01:11] and you said you could never forget
[1:01:13] them. and they're inscribed on the palms
[1:01:15] of your hands. But yet, I've got
[1:01:17] physical evidence that they are
[1:01:18] hypocrites, they're liars, they're
[1:01:20] adulterers, they're idolattors, they're
[1:01:22] liars, they're thieves, they're they're
[1:01:24] all of these things. And he wasn't wrong
[1:01:28] in his laundry list of accusations.
[1:01:31] But the but the judge dismissed all of
[1:01:35] his actual evidence on a single premise
[1:01:39] that that Israel was elected. Period.
[1:01:43] full stop. This is Jerusalem whom I have
[1:01:46] chosen. And therefore, the case was
[1:01:49] sumearily dismissed. No accusation would
[1:01:51] ever be heard again. And Satan was
[1:01:53] driven from the courtroom. And Paul
[1:01:56] would say, "There is now therefore no
[1:01:58] condemnation to them which are in
[1:02:00] Christ. You are unarrestable. You are un
[1:02:03] unindictable. You are unchargeable. God
[1:02:06] will not hear the case. uh his bride is
[1:02:08] as perfect as he is.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Because not because her wins and loss
[1:02:13] record is perfect, but because she has
[1:02:16] believed the report.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; She has believed. She has received the
[1:02:20] word for her day. And that is and God
[1:02:22] said, "If you do that," he told that
[1:02:24] middle age, that thyroid age, if you do
[1:02:26] that, I will I will put none other
[1:02:29] burden upon you just that you believe my
[1:02:32] word.
[1:02:34] And so we see those parallels coming in
[1:02:36] the day and hour that we live in just
[1:02:38] like that church age faced Jezebel
[1:02:41] religion and faced the total uh
[1:02:43] beginning of the dark ages. And that's
[1:02:45] where we are. That's why that fourth age
[1:02:48] has such a parallel to the seventh age
[1:02:49] because again here's Jezebel religion.
[1:02:52] Here's the the the dark ages. Christ is
[1:02:55] kicked out. It's it's darkness upon the
[1:02:57] whole world and gross darkness upon the
[1:02:59] minds of the people. But God had an
[1:03:02] event that he had been watching and
[1:03:04] waiting for centuries through millennia
[1:03:06] that finally he could say, "Arise,
[1:03:09] shine, thy light has come."
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; So this is where we are today. And so I
[1:03:17] was we were saying to you in our last
[1:03:20] installment that just as the gospel as
[1:03:23] Paul would say the gospel came not in
[1:03:26] word only but in power
[1:03:29] and demonstration of the word.
[1:03:33] So I I just I just I just said it this
[1:03:35] way in my own wording. I have come into
[1:03:39] the world as a believer not in election
[1:03:42] only. That's not why I'm here just to
[1:03:45] enjoy the fact that I'm elected. [gasps]
[1:03:48] But I'm here not in election only, but
[1:03:51] in power and demonstration
[1:03:54] of the election that I'm a part of.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; And that's your mission.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; That's what Christianity is all about.
[1:04:04] And to see the blatant hypocrisy today,
[1:04:07] what they call Christianity. And I,
[1:04:10] [clears throat] you know, I was watching
[1:04:11] um um a a clip um not that I not that
[1:04:15] I'm subscribed to this this channel and
[1:04:17] I wouldn't be subscribed to it at all.
[1:04:19] He's quite a popular podcaster, a number
[1:04:21] of podcasters and but he had a he was
[1:04:24] doing a particular thing that I had an
[1:04:26] interest in. I was studying on it
[1:04:28] [clears throat]
[1:04:29] and you know he he's he's in in in in
[1:04:33] [clears throat] one word he's saying you
[1:04:35] know all glory to God and we thank God
[1:04:38] and I pray you know I pray for this and
[1:04:40] I pray for that and you know I'm I'm
[1:04:42] here to tell you that prayer and he and
[1:04:43] he's just he's almost like giving a
[1:04:45] sales pitch for for Christianity
[1:04:47] you know and then it's not you you can't
[1:04:50] even get 10 words later and and he's
[1:04:54] throwing out the most horrible profanity
[1:04:58] and vulgar profanity and then circle
[1:05:01] back around to thanking God and blessing
[1:05:03] the name of God and his host doing the
[1:05:06] same thing. Yes, you know, if it wasn't
[1:05:08] for God, I don't know what I'd do and
[1:05:09] where I'd be. And then the next thing is
[1:05:12] profanity, profanity, profanity, you
[1:05:14] know, but thanks be to God. And I just
[1:05:15] thought, this is worse than sad. This is
[1:05:18] nauseating.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just so glad God sent us a clean
[1:05:23] message. and a clean messenger and a and
[1:05:27] gave us a clean word of God. And I'm I'm
[1:05:29] glad Jesus lived a clean life. I'm glad
[1:05:32] the apostles were overcomers because it
[1:05:35] tells me I can be an overcomer.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So Lucifer, of course, has been
[1:05:41] prosecuting his plan for 6,000 years
[1:05:45] since Eden. And you know the um
[1:05:51] I I appreciate that in the book of
[1:05:53] Revelation that the first act
[1:05:57] by Christ of calling it a new heavens
[1:06:02] and a new earth signals to me a finality
[1:06:07] of everything previous.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Now that means that means all the sin in
[1:06:13] the world it's all gone.
[1:06:16] any tangible
[1:06:19] evidential mistakes that I made gone,
[1:06:24] never to return, annihilated. They
[1:06:26] already are. But but when you come to
[1:06:29] the end of the millennium, there's still
[1:06:31] this this aspect of saying now I make
[1:06:35] all things new. I just want to say to
[1:06:39] you today, friends, I don't even uh I I
[1:06:42] don't know. I don't need I don't need
[1:06:44] your biography of the things you've been
[1:06:46] through, the ups and downs. I do know
[1:06:48] this. You've had them.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; I I don't need your successes and
[1:06:54] failures. I know you've had them. I
[1:06:55] don't need your joys and your sorrows. I
[1:06:57] know if you're a human being, you've had
[1:06:58] them. But I want you to know today that
[1:07:01] there's coming a day where all things
[1:07:03] will be made new
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; and Jerusalem will again rejoice and the
[1:07:07] bride will rejoice at the sound of the
[1:07:09] bridegroom. And I I just I I'm able to
[1:07:13] endure no matter what Satan throws at
[1:07:15] me. No matter what this world becomes, I
[1:07:17] know I can say, "Go ahead, Satan. This
[1:07:20] is your day, but my day is coming."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:27] God dwelling with his people in the
[1:07:30] fullness of his manifestation and in all
[1:07:33] categories. And and so so now I'm sure I
[1:07:38] wouldn't need to explain further or
[1:07:41] convince you. Uh I'm sure you understand
[1:07:44] that this is exactly the what and the
[1:07:47] why of Satan's attack when he because
[1:07:51] he's trying to to stop
[1:07:55] you as a manifestation of this.
[1:08:00] That's his plan. See, because that's
[1:08:02] when he can break God's word. Because
[1:08:05] God's word is is that he would have a
[1:08:07] bride like this. And so if Satan can
[1:08:11] hinder your manifestation, you say,
[1:08:13] "Well, I'm I'm eventually I'm eventually
[1:08:16] going to get there." And election tells
[1:08:18] me that that's true. But what about now?
[1:08:22] What about what am I doing for him right
[1:08:24] now? I already know I should be able to
[1:08:27] run free knowing that my destination is
[1:08:29] predetermined and I'm elected in God. I
[1:08:32] should be able to go full force and I
[1:08:33] say, "I don't care what the devil does.
[1:08:35] I'm going to serve the Lord and my life
[1:08:37] is going to be a manifestation of his
[1:08:38] word
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; because I want my life to count for
[1:08:42] something here and now. I already know
[1:08:45] what it's going to be there and then."
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; So, [clears throat] and it's and it's
[1:08:51] not just a a millennium, you know? I
[1:08:54] mean, my goodness, even I remember when
[1:08:56] Pope John Paul,
[1:08:59] you know, made his proclamations and and
[1:09:01] they were they were they they were not
[1:09:04] uncertain about it. They made it
[1:09:05] publicly known that they believed that
[1:09:07] the Roman church would be able if
[1:09:10] everybody would just line up under the
[1:09:12] Roman Catholic system, they could
[1:09:14] introduce a millennium to the earth. And
[1:09:18] I just thought to myself, but I don't
[1:09:20] want that kind of millennium
[1:09:22] because I've got enough history, a study
[1:09:24] of history. I know how it is when you
[1:09:25] guys are in perfect power and you have
[1:09:27] supreme power. That's not the kind of
[1:09:29] earth I want to live in. You say, "Well,
[1:09:31] but it it might be better than what we
[1:09:33] got now. It's it's not going to be as
[1:09:35] good as what I could have in Christ."
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's not about I'm not looking
[1:09:40] for, you know, I'm not looking for
[1:09:42] second, third, or fourth. I want first.
[1:09:44] If you're not first, you're last. So, I
[1:09:46] want to be first. See,
[1:09:50] so this is where we read how the morning
[1:09:52] stars came together. And and there's a
[1:09:55] number of things that we can look at
[1:09:57] today that we and we can't go further
[1:10:00] than what the scripture shows us. We
[1:10:02] can't go further than what a prophet
[1:10:03] explained it. But we do have some
[1:10:06] insight. And you know, we do know that
[1:10:09] morning stars sang together. We do know
[1:10:11] that. We do know there was a time in the
[1:10:14] aons where sons of God shouted for joy.
[1:10:17] And we do know brother Brandham, you
[1:10:19] know, um, kind of moving around in the
[1:10:21] language of of a of of asserting that
[1:10:24] that he and and there's some quotes
[1:10:26] where he actually is talking about how
[1:10:28] that, you know, you were somewhere else
[1:10:31] before you were here. Now, he did not
[1:10:33] believe in pre-existent souls as the
[1:10:35] Mormons teach that. We know that. That's
[1:10:38] something else we know. He didn't
[1:10:40] believe in the Mormon doctrine of
[1:10:41] pre-existing souls, but he did say,
[1:10:44] "See, you were somewhere else." He and
[1:10:47] he would say things like, and I'm
[1:10:49] paraphrasing somewhat, he would say,
[1:10:50] "You don't remember it now. There's a
[1:10:52] veil over your memory, but someday that
[1:10:55] veil is going to be lifted and you're
[1:10:57] going to be home and you're going to
[1:10:59] realize [laughter] I'm back home." See?
[1:11:04] So,
[1:11:05] so you know, brother Brandham would
[1:11:07] would make statements about how that,
[1:11:10] you know, when in Genesis when he says,
[1:11:12] "Let us make man in our image." And
[1:11:16] brother Brandham has taught us in pretty
[1:11:18] clear language that when he said, "Let
[1:11:20] us make man in our image," he made his
[1:11:22] whole family. In his mind, he had his
[1:11:24] whole family. So, so what we're doing
[1:11:28] today is just living out the vision that
[1:11:30] God had of you before the foundation of
[1:11:32] the world.
[1:11:35] This is why
[1:11:38] what it that that's a glorious thing to
[1:11:41] you is a teeth grinding frustration to
[1:11:46] Lucifer
[1:11:48] because he's never been able to figure
[1:11:50] out how that he makes it harder on you
[1:11:52] and you love God more.
[1:11:55] And the the hotter the trials, the
[1:11:57] greater your faith. And and when he
[1:12:00] knocks you down, you raise up stronger
[1:12:02] than before he knocked you down.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And and and and I and it it seems in
[1:12:08] congruous to him that how was it that he
[1:12:11] collapsed Adam in the way that he did?
[1:12:14] And yet when Adam, you know, a a a son
[1:12:18] of God, I'm going to say it like this, a
[1:12:20] son of God, born in sin, redeemed back
[1:12:24] to Christ, is of more value to God than
[1:12:27] when he was back there shouting for joy,
[1:12:30] looking at the plan of redemption.
[1:12:33] Because because now as long as all of
[1:12:36] that family sons and daughters just
[1:12:38] stayed there shouting over the plan of
[1:12:40] redemption, then he's never going to be
[1:12:42] it's it's like, "Okay, guys, we need to
[1:12:44] get on with it because the whole plan is
[1:12:46] for me to become a redeemer. The whole
[1:12:48] plan is I'm going to be a savior. I'm
[1:12:50] going to be a healer. I'm going to be a
[1:12:51] protector." And none of that stuff is
[1:12:54] going to be possible if he doesn't bring
[1:12:57] an earth, set it up to where he can't he
[1:13:00] can't entrap e Adam and Eve to fall, but
[1:13:03] he can build it and create it and create
[1:13:05] the serpent in such a way and and make
[1:13:07] Eve a certain such a way that she could
[1:13:10] fall. And so he didn't force them to do
[1:13:13] it, but but they made that choice on
[1:13:16] their own. But, you know, it's not like
[1:13:18] God was worried because Adam was not
[1:13:22] just a son of God. The Bible says Adam
[1:13:25] was the son of God.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And so, he was the first Adam. Jesus is
[1:13:28] the second Adam. So, God already knew
[1:13:32] that Adam would step forward to save her
[1:13:35] just like he already knew he would in
[1:13:37] Christ step forward and become sin.
[1:13:42] He who knew no sin, never committed a
[1:13:45] sin, became sin.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; This is why I've said for years that
[1:13:51] when brother Brandon would say, "You
[1:13:52] have to be able to read Christ in every
[1:13:54] verse. And if you can't, you can go back
[1:13:56] and read it again. You've missed it."
[1:13:59] But the problem is as human beings when
[1:14:01] we look at that, we read about some
[1:14:03] pretty heinous stuff, some pretty
[1:14:05] twisted stuff.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, God's family don't have a
[1:14:10] perfect track record. Only only Christ
[1:14:14] has the perfect track record. That's why
[1:14:16] there's only one elected son, and that's
[1:14:18] Christ. Well, how did you get elected?
[1:14:20] You were in him before the foundation of
[1:14:22] the world. So, election is origin.
[1:14:25] And and so, so we find out then that
[1:14:28] that when I read about those horrible,
[1:14:32] devious deeds, I just say, how am I
[1:14:35] going to read Jesus in that? Because
[1:14:37] Jesus never did all of these things, but
[1:14:40] you and me did. And he took our sin upon
[1:14:44] himself
[1:14:46] and became guilty. And God against all
[1:14:49] odds, against all what we would call
[1:14:51] common sense, against everything that's
[1:14:54] right and wrong. And in the name of
[1:14:56] everything that's right and wrong, God
[1:14:59] seemed to violate every possible thing
[1:15:02] that you that you would say this is
[1:15:05] wrong. God traded the innocent for the
[1:15:10] guilty.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And then people wonder why we sing about
[1:15:18] the love of God and weep tears. People
[1:15:21] wonder why the angels can't ever sing
[1:15:23] that song because angels are on a
[1:15:25] different order. They they they never
[1:15:27] were uh they're not his offspring per se
[1:15:31] like sons and daughters of God are. And
[1:15:33] so, so we realize then that that when
[1:15:37] when morning stars are singing together
[1:15:39] and God has his whole family in his mind
[1:15:41] and and as the plan of God's family, a
[1:15:45] plan of God for his family begins to
[1:15:49] form and it begins to come into focus
[1:15:52] and and you know it I think that at that
[1:15:55] point that Lucifer could certainly see
[1:15:58] that um you know he he could see that
[1:16:01] that he would be playing second fiddle
[1:16:04] to this family.
[1:16:07] Wow. Here I am, the right-hand man of
[1:16:10] God. I'm the first and highest angel.
[1:16:13] I'm the archangel. I stand at the right
[1:16:16] hand of the throne. And and that's why
[1:16:19] Jewish scholars e acknowledge and most
[1:16:22] Christian scholars even from the early
[1:16:23] ages believe that Lucifer was the very
[1:16:26] brother Ram said the first thing brother
[1:16:28] Ram said the first thing that God did
[1:16:29] was create angels. And so the first one
[1:16:31] he would have created was Lucifer. He
[1:16:33] was the highest. And then and he's the
[1:16:35] right hand. And so can you imagine
[1:16:38] having been that right-hand man, but
[1:16:41] you're you're an angelic being and
[1:16:44] suddenly you begin to see a plan. And I
[1:16:47] don't know how it all happened. We don't
[1:16:48] know where it how long it took. Brother
[1:16:50] Brandham said it might be aons and and
[1:16:52] and millions of years. We don't know.
[1:16:54] All I know is that there was a time when
[1:16:57] morning stars sang together and sons of
[1:17:00] God shouted for joy and it was viewable.
[1:17:02] A prophet saw it. Can you imagine for a
[1:17:05] moment how Lucifer began to observe that
[1:17:08] and say, "Wow, wait a minute. Hold on.
[1:17:11] Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that
[1:17:14] I thought it's just me and then God, and
[1:17:16] there's nothing in between me and God,
[1:17:18] and now I'm finding out there's a whole
[1:17:20] another expression of God's multiplied
[1:17:23] life that's going to be higher than me.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know if if that was, you
[1:17:32] know, I'm not a prophet. I can't I can't
[1:17:33] do like Isaiah and discern the secrets
[1:17:35] of Satan's of Lucifer's heart, but I
[1:17:38] know how I would feel. I'm think my
[1:17:40] goodness. Uh you mean wow what a
[1:17:43] discouraging thing you know no wonder he
[1:17:46] would maybe that would maybe that was
[1:17:49] the final straw that broke the camel's
[1:17:52] back. Maybe he that's what initiated his
[1:17:56] his desire to go into manifestation
[1:17:58] because remember every brother Brandham
[1:18:00] said a word is a thought expressed and
[1:18:02] the Bible teaches us that. And so Satan
[1:18:05] before he ever committed, you know, um
[1:18:08] those kinds of of deeds, uh he had it in
[1:18:11] his heart. That's what the prophet of
[1:18:13] you said in your heart.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; See, long before you ever showed your
[1:18:17] card, you were already that was already
[1:18:18] in your heart, thinking God didn't see
[1:18:20] it and God saw it the whole time. See,
[1:18:22] now I don't know. I I'm not a prophet. I
[1:18:25] can't say that's how Satan felt. But I
[1:18:27] do know that by the time I get to
[1:18:28] material that I can absorb, I do know
[1:18:31] that Satan has devised a plan to
[1:18:33] shortcircuit that by getting control of
[1:18:36] the family.
[1:18:38] See, and so this is then you've got a
[1:18:40] fall in the garden. And it's it's not so
[1:18:42] much about a a literal seed, but it's
[1:18:45] now about a spiritual seed because it
[1:18:47] doesn't matter that all of these sons
[1:18:49] and daughters of God who were shouting
[1:18:50] for joy, they're all going to come
[1:18:52] through a sex birth and they're going to
[1:18:53] be in Satan's pawn shop.
[1:18:56] and he'll have a right to them unless
[1:18:58] somebody comes and sets them free. Oh,
[1:19:01] hallelujah. My
[1:19:05] So, you know, I
[1:19:08] I I was looking at some research on the
[1:19:10] very name Lucifer. I found some
[1:19:12] interesting things that I hadn't been
[1:19:14] aware of before. Now, this part I was I
[1:19:17] was aware of. Lucifer, the name means
[1:19:19] lightbringer or morning star. And so
[1:19:22] originally it referred metaphorically to
[1:19:25] a bright star. In fact is the morning
[1:19:28] star. Remember we was preaching here
[1:19:29] some time ago and brother Brandham's
[1:19:32] talking about the morning star and the
[1:19:33] evening star. They're the same star. And
[1:19:35] we found out the morning star is the
[1:19:37] planet Venus. You remember that? And we
[1:19:39] found out that no man hath seen Venus at
[1:19:42] any time because it's surrounded by a
[1:19:44] cloud. All you see is the light of the
[1:19:46] sun shining off the cloud of witnesses
[1:19:49] that there's a planet down inside there.
[1:19:51] See? And so, so you know, just like no
[1:19:54] man hath seen God at any time, but the
[1:19:56] only begotten hath declared him. So God
[1:19:58] is a spirit. See, and that that's why
[1:20:00] Jesus would say, "The hour is coming and
[1:20:03] now is that they that worship must
[1:20:06] worship in spirit and in truth." God had
[1:20:08] for 4,000 years had his family
[1:20:09] worshiping him. But Jesus is trying to
[1:20:12] get it across to the to the woman at the
[1:20:14] well that the Holy Ghost is coming.
[1:20:17] God's whole plan is to get inside of his
[1:20:21] people and so that their life is a
[1:20:24] worship
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; as brother Diggs was preaching
[1:20:26] Wednesday. Then your life, the time is
[1:20:29] coming and now is when they that worship
[1:20:32] must worship in spirit.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; This was God's goal to turn you into
[1:20:38] him.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. To have a bride that are
[1:20:42] his offspring. to have a family that are
[1:20:45] made out of the same word that Jesus was
[1:20:47] made from.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; He's the beginning of the creation of
[1:20:50] God. He's a prototype for a brand new
[1:20:52] type of human.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; This is why they can't figure out the
[1:20:58] godhead because they look at it from the
[1:21:00] aspect of of their own humanity. And
[1:21:03] when you do it like that, sometimes it
[1:21:05] can look like multiple persons. But they
[1:21:08] they're constantly losing sight of the
[1:21:10] fact that Jesus wasn't just a man. He
[1:21:12] was a man, but he wasn't merely a man.
[1:21:16] See, he was 100% a man, but he wasn't
[1:21:19] merely a man. To use William Brandham's
[1:21:22] exact language, he was man plus.
[1:21:25] See, brother Brandon would say he was
[1:21:28] the God man. So now, that's a prototype.
[1:21:31] That's a brand new type of human being.
[1:21:33] And unless you look at the Godhead
[1:21:36] through that and and get away from your
[1:21:38] own human reasoning and realize this is
[1:21:41] this is not a normal human. This is man
[1:21:44] plus. See this is the God man. Then it
[1:21:47] begins to then you begin to understand
[1:21:50] expression. And then when you understand
[1:21:52] that he is an expression then you
[1:21:54] understand that as part of the word
[1:21:56] you're a further expression. And that's
[1:21:58] why a prophet would say him being the
[1:22:00] beginning of the creation of God, you
[1:22:02] are the continuation of that same
[1:22:03] creation.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; See, so so he's not coming to, you know,
[1:22:11] he he he when he comes into the soul,
[1:22:14] this is exactly why the soul, the old
[1:22:16] nature, brother Brandon would say, it's
[1:22:18] not your body that died or spirit that
[1:22:20] died. It's your nature that died, that
[1:22:22] fallen nature that you were born under.
[1:22:25] And God is not going to inhabit a temple
[1:22:30] and share that realm of the soul. One is
[1:22:34] going to have to die so the other can be
[1:22:36] born. See, because it would be illegal
[1:22:39] for him to do that. That's I mean,
[1:22:41] there's so many Old Testament laws that
[1:22:43] cover that. you you I mean the law of
[1:22:45] the Nazarite do you know the if a
[1:22:46] Nazarite took a vow and they let's say
[1:22:48] they took a 30-day vow and you know
[1:22:51] anybody could take a Nazarite a man or
[1:22:53] woman then for however long they said it
[1:22:54] was a time of dedication unto the Lord
[1:22:57] and and it was a vow that you took and
[1:22:59] if you're on your let's say you took a
[1:23:00] 30-day you know I'm going to have a
[1:23:02] Nazarite vow for 30 days and on the 29th
[1:23:04] day somebody beside you falls dead and
[1:23:07] falls into you you're contaminated and
[1:23:10] your whole vow is broken see because and
[1:23:13] That's why when they when the when the
[1:23:16] when the people are are are are
[1:23:17] suggesting the nonsense that they're the
[1:23:20] prophet comes to the priesthood and he
[1:23:22] says here's a question for you. If if
[1:23:25] something clean touches something
[1:23:28] unclean, does the unclean become clean
[1:23:31] or does the clean become unclean? And
[1:23:34] they immediately knew the law. They said
[1:23:36] the clean becomes unclean. So the clean
[1:23:39] touching the unclean doesn't make it
[1:23:41] clean. It makes the clean unclean. So,
[1:23:44] so it'd be legal for God to come and
[1:23:46] live inside your soul with a fallen
[1:23:48] nature. So, that old nature has got to
[1:23:51] die and a gene of God has got to come
[1:23:53] forward and it's got to be the literal
[1:23:55] brother Brandon would say Zoey life.
[1:23:58] That's not a different life or an
[1:24:00] additional life. That's the same life
[1:24:03] multiplied.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the new birth. And then now
[1:24:08] you've got now begins the greatest
[1:24:10] battle ever fought because the soul is
[1:24:13] in the presence of God. It's dwelling in
[1:24:15] heavenly places and it's living inside
[1:24:18] of a body and a spirit that are not
[1:24:20] converted. So there's where the warfare
[1:24:23] comes and there's where Satan is
[1:24:25] attacking. And and when you become born
[1:24:27] again, that's when the battle starts.
[1:24:31] You don't have a battle when all three
[1:24:32] of you of all three of the realms of you
[1:24:35] that make up you uh are all in darkness.
[1:24:38] You don't you don't even commit sin.
[1:24:41] Brother Brandham said it be he said he
[1:24:42] held up his Bible and he said it'd be
[1:24:44] like me saying there's black on this.
[1:24:46] Well, that would be silly. The whole
[1:24:48] cover's black. When you're when you're
[1:24:50] in sin before you're born again, uh
[1:24:53] you're you're just a sinner. You're in
[1:24:55] sin. Your sins aren't even counted
[1:24:57] against you. It's a mood point. You're
[1:24:59] going to die and go to hell unless you
[1:25:00] get born again.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; See, and then once you're born again,
[1:25:04] now becomes the greatest battle ever
[1:25:06] fought. Oh my, I got to keep moving.
[1:25:10] So, so then you can see why Lucifer was
[1:25:14] called the morning star. The the in fact
[1:25:17] is the use of Lucifer as a proper name
[1:25:20] for the devil actually developed more
[1:25:22] under Christian early church
[1:25:24] Christianity than it ever did. only the
[1:25:26] Jews never saw it like that at all
[1:25:28] really. They looked at Job and they
[1:25:31] looked at Zechariah 3 and they they
[1:25:34] looked at Satan, you know, the one that
[1:25:36] troubled David and numbered the people.
[1:25:38] So they looked at him at Lucifer. They
[1:25:40] knew the devil was real, but they looked
[1:25:43] at him as just an adversary and he's
[1:25:45] just an accuser or he's just a he's he's
[1:25:48] an obstacle. But it was, you know, only
[1:25:51] with within about probably the the the
[1:25:53] the first maybe first and part of the
[1:25:55] second century BC did some of the
[1:25:58] writers begin to, you know, prior to
[1:26:00] Christ begin to realize, hey, there
[1:26:02] might be more to it than this. And by
[1:26:05] the time you get to the to the gospel
[1:26:07] writers, by the time you get to Jesus,
[1:26:09] it's pretty clear there's a devil.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And it's pretty clear that the church is
[1:26:13] under his domain. And it's pretty clear
[1:26:15] that he's there to rescue people from
[1:26:16] the dominion of Satan.
[1:26:19] And so this why brother Brandon would
[1:26:21] say don't let anybody tell you the
[1:26:22] devil's not real. He's very real. See,
[1:26:25] but greater is he that is in me than he
[1:26:27] that is in the world.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; So so he it's developed under mainly
[1:26:33] under Christian tradition and uh there
[1:26:36] there was a you know they they didn't
[1:26:37] even u the the the Hebrew word is h e y
[1:26:41] l e l h as best I can pronounce it.
[1:26:44] That's probably butchering the Hebrew uh
[1:26:47] the way it sounds. But but we find that
[1:26:50] it just means light. And you remember
[1:26:53] was it James who talks about how that
[1:26:55] Satan can appear as an angel of light.
[1:26:58] See? And so there's all kinds of of of
[1:27:01] scriptures. I don't want to I I've got a
[1:27:03] bunch written down here, but but it but
[1:27:05] not originally was the devil given this
[1:27:09] name uh Satan or connecting that to
[1:27:14] Lucifer in Isaiah. To the Jews, they
[1:27:17] just thought Isaiah is a is a is a
[1:27:20] warning against the king of Babylon.
[1:27:23] See, and even if you go over into
[1:27:25] Ezekiel and you find out that he's the
[1:27:27] anointed cherub, well, they say, "Well,
[1:27:28] that's just God. That's a metaphor for
[1:27:30] God warning the king of Ty." And it and
[1:27:33] it really took the gospel and the gospel
[1:27:35] writers to really bring that together.
[1:27:38] And the apostles began to speak about
[1:27:41] spiritual wickedness in high places. And
[1:27:45] we wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[1:27:47] See, that's kind of new thinking to
[1:27:49] Jews. We wrestle not against flesh and
[1:27:51] blood, but we wrestle against powers,
[1:27:54] principalities, powers of the air. See,
[1:27:56] and and and and even Satan who can
[1:27:59] appear as an angel of light. And by the
[1:28:00] time John comes back with the book of
[1:28:02] Revelation, he's a dragon.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And he and remember we found that the
[1:28:06] verse where he's the dragon, he's Satan,
[1:28:08] he's the devil, he's all of the above.
[1:28:12] So these are things that developed in
[1:28:14] the early Christian church and and and
[1:28:17] and how that the whole concept that that
[1:28:21] Lucifer represented the the first or
[1:28:23] high ranking angel created in the
[1:28:26] heavenly realms. Um that that was kind
[1:28:29] of new when the when the New Testament
[1:28:31] writers looked at at Ezekiel 28 as the
[1:28:34] anointed cherub or they looked at Isaiah
[1:28:36] 14 as as Lucifer falling from heaven.
[1:28:39] And and there's where brother Brandham
[1:28:41] is going to to take under the trumpets
[1:28:45] and the vials and he's going to point
[1:28:47] back to the star that fell from heaven.
[1:28:49] Remember Jesus said that he said to the
[1:28:51] disciples, "I saw Satan fall from
[1:28:54] heaven." See, and so because what was
[1:28:56] doing that? The gospel was going
[1:28:58] forward. Do do you comprehend today that
[1:29:02] you're not here to just have better
[1:29:04] theology than the Baptists or the
[1:29:06] Lutheran? that you're actually a
[1:29:08] continuation of the book of Acts, that
[1:29:10] you're actually supposed to have a life
[1:29:12] of spirit and truth that honors God and
[1:29:14] worships the true God and and exhibits
[1:29:17] and exerts the power and the authority
[1:29:20] of the word of God.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; See, so just as Jesus backed down
[1:29:26] devils, you're to be backing them down.
[1:29:28] Jesus said that, "Go into all the world
[1:29:30] and preach the gospel to every
[1:29:32] creature." See, he tells them in the
[1:29:34] book of Mark, you know, they'll lay
[1:29:36] hands on the sick, if they drink any
[1:29:38] deadly thing, all of these different
[1:29:39] things. And you see when the book of
[1:29:41] Acts opens, they start doing that. So, I
[1:29:44] I you know, I just I get flabbergasted
[1:29:48] at times at people who who want to decry
[1:29:53] this message or the messenger and say
[1:29:55] the message is a cult and the messenger
[1:29:57] was false. And I'm like, well, how does
[1:29:59] it create people in this image? I mean,
[1:30:02] what's what's doing that? And and why is
[1:30:04] it if you have if what you have is so
[1:30:06] true, why are you full of such
[1:30:08] hypocrisy? And you're nothing even like
[1:30:10] your founding fathers. I can't even I
[1:30:13] can't even say the Lutheran are holy
[1:30:15] like Luther. I can't even say the
[1:30:17] Methodists, you don't even go back a
[1:30:18] couple hundred years to your founder.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And we're the ones that are a cult. Are
[1:30:24] you kidding?
[1:30:26] See, and and so but then you you begin
[1:30:28] to realize that that's the level of
[1:30:31] spiritual blindness.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; See, it's a spiritual blindness. And
[1:30:36] they brother Brandham's called it the
[1:30:37] saddest part of it because they don't
[1:30:39] you can't tell them anything. They they
[1:30:41] think they see. See, but they've long
[1:30:43] ago closed their eyes. And it's not God.
[1:30:46] You can't impugn him with that. We've
[1:30:47] proven that by the Bible many times.
[1:30:50] Jesus said their eyes they have closed.
[1:30:53] See, lest at any time they see with
[1:30:55] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[1:30:57] understand and then they and be
[1:30:59] converted and I should heal them. So we
[1:31:01] we know that when they knew God as God,
[1:31:04] they worshiped him not as God. We know
[1:31:06] that God hardened Pharaoh's heart. But
[1:31:09] the what most people don't want to tell
[1:31:10] you is that five times before God
[1:31:12] hardened his heart, Pharaoh hardened his
[1:31:14] own heart.
[1:31:15] See, so so you know, we we talk about,
[1:31:20] you know, uh Satan masquerading as an
[1:31:23] angel of light. See, I think I think I
[1:31:25] might have said James, it's actually
[1:31:26] Paul in 2 Corinthians. And Revelation
[1:31:29] 12, you know, depicts a a heavenly war
[1:31:31] with Michael and his angels fighting
[1:31:33] against the dragon identified as Satan,
[1:31:35] and he's cast out with his angels. I'm
[1:31:37] trying to move quickly. We can we find
[1:31:40] that we we know by clear implication in
[1:31:42] the scripture that he had been thinking
[1:31:45] about it prior to doing it because
[1:31:47] that's what brother Brandham showed us.
[1:31:48] A word is a thought expressed. And
[1:31:51] that's why the Bible would say
[1:31:54] listen I'm going to I'm going to tell
[1:31:55] you how to get better victory in your
[1:31:57] physical overcoming life. And that is
[1:32:01] bring every thought subject to the Holy
[1:32:03] Ghost.
[1:32:05] See, if you would do, as soon as Satan,
[1:32:07] he's got a right to bring the thought.
[1:32:08] But if you would just immediately bring
[1:32:10] that subject to the Holy Spirit, the
[1:32:12] whole I remember my daddy taught me that
[1:32:14] from a small boy. This is how you fight
[1:32:16] devils, Jason. This is how you do it.
[1:32:17] How do I do it, Dad? How do I get
[1:32:18] victory? I want to I want to have
[1:32:20] victory like you got victory. He said,
[1:32:21] "Here's what you do, son. Every time the
[1:32:23] devil comes at you with a wrong thought,
[1:32:25] you bring it to the Holy Ghost, and
[1:32:26] he'll kill it on the spot." Man, I
[1:32:28] thought the Holy Ghost must be the
[1:32:29] biggest, baddest dude I'd ever heard of.
[1:32:32] Wow. You mean I can just bring that
[1:32:33] thought and he'll just crush it? He
[1:32:34] said, "He will crush it. He will stomp
[1:32:36] it. He'll wipe it out and you'll you'll
[1:32:38] stay free." I said, "Man, whoa. That's
[1:32:41] what I'm going to do." And and that's
[1:32:43] where I found victory. And that's where
[1:32:44] I've also found failure when I don't do
[1:32:46] that.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:32:50] so we know that it starts in the heart.
[1:32:53] Um Jesus taught us in the 15th chapter
[1:32:56] of Matthew that what defiles a person is
[1:32:59] from the heart. that evil thoughts that
[1:33:01] murder, adultery, theft, all these
[1:33:03] different things, long before they're
[1:33:04] ever an outward action, they're an inner
[1:33:07] thought that got toyed and played with.
[1:33:09] See,
[1:33:11] um, here's that scripture I was trying
[1:33:13] to refer to in James 1 that was in my
[1:33:15] mind explaining how James 1:14 and 15.
[1:33:17] I'm not going to take the time to read
[1:33:18] it, but it explains how that each person
[1:33:22] is tempted when they are drawn away and
[1:33:25] enticed by their own lust. See, you're
[1:33:27] still in a fallen body. So, these are I
[1:33:30] I've got another series that I'm going
[1:33:31] to start soon. I've been building
[1:33:33] material for it and waiting for the
[1:33:35] Lord's uncction. But it but it's
[1:33:37] spiritual warfare 101 because God hasn't
[1:33:41] left us without a defense
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; and how to use it. And he's given us the
[1:33:46] key of understanding. See, and so
[1:33:49] demonology is real. And we want to take
[1:33:51] some lessons on that. Paul talks about
[1:33:53] putting off the old self in Ephesians 4
[1:33:56] which is corrupted by deceitful desires
[1:33:58] and putting on the new self which is
[1:34:00] created in righteousness. So we know how
[1:34:04] this works. So this is why brother
[1:34:06] Brandham would would would say how that
[1:34:08] a word is a thought expressed and in
[1:34:10] fact is if you if you go to brother
[1:34:13] Brandham's teaching when he comes over
[1:34:14] to the book of revelation there in
[1:34:16] chapter 12
[1:34:18] when Michael and Lucifer fought and
[1:34:20] Michael and his angels Lucifer the
[1:34:22] dragon and his angels and he took a a
[1:34:25] his tail caught a third of the stars of
[1:34:28] heaven and and and only you'd have to be
[1:34:32] a prophet to have the authority to do
[1:34:34] this. I certainly couldn't do it, but
[1:34:36] when I read it, it he he took his t a i
[1:34:40] l, his tail. Now, don't don't have a
[1:34:43] have a fainting spell because remember
[1:34:46] everything John's seeing is metaphorical
[1:34:48] symbolism. There's not a real red dragon
[1:34:51] flying around.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, he takes and brother Brandham
[1:34:55] is going to unlock the mystery of his t
[1:34:57] a i l and says what it was was his t a l
[1:35:02] e.
[1:35:03] that the red dragon's tail that deceived
[1:35:06] a third of the stars was the tale he
[1:35:08] told. He was telling it to Eve. He's
[1:35:10] telling it to the churches today. It's
[1:35:12] the same lie. It's the exact same lie
[1:35:15] that Eve fell for. See,
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; and and and and remember that the lie
[1:35:22] that Eve was told,
[1:35:24] look at it from a from a higher altitude
[1:35:26] than just getting right down and saying,
[1:35:28] "Well, you know, he told her she could
[1:35:29] eat fruit." But that's all part and
[1:35:31] parcel of the greater thing that he
[1:35:33] first got her mind to. And his original
[1:35:37] lie was you don't have to believe every
[1:35:40] word of God.
[1:35:43] God's word has variation and you can
[1:35:45] pick and choose.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You can kind of just, you know, uh have
[1:35:49] your own opinion. And I'll look, okay,
[1:35:52] tell me what a prophet said and I'll go
[1:35:53] home and think about it.
[1:35:56] You're going to destroy yourself, your
[1:35:58] family, your children, everything that
[1:36:01] you love. Satan is going to take from
[1:36:03] you because you have not got enough
[1:36:05] audacity to stand on the pure word of
[1:36:07] God and say, "God sent me a word and
[1:36:10] sent me a prophet and told me how to
[1:36:11] believe it and how to engage the powers
[1:36:14] of God."
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; See, everybody wants their own opinion.
[1:36:18] So, I think once Satan realized that he
[1:36:21] was only ever going to be temporarily
[1:36:23] God's right-hand man, eventually through
[1:36:25] the plan of redemption that God's family
[1:36:28] would be in that position above him. And
[1:36:32] so, you know, I think that maybe at
[1:36:34] least that's where he conjured up his
[1:36:37] plan. And so, how he would ascend to the
[1:36:40] throne through the family, I don't want
[1:36:41] to repeat myself. That was I'm I'm just
[1:36:44] trying to get you to understand that
[1:36:45] that was the ultimate inside play.
[1:36:48] Because Satan saw a way to do it. You
[1:36:50] say, "Well, how do you know he thought
[1:36:52] that?" Because I can see what he did.
[1:36:54] And I know that an action is a thought
[1:36:56] expressed. See? So, so, so in any case,
[1:37:01] a a place higher than where Lucifer
[1:37:03] stood was beginning to come in view. A
[1:37:06] place where without controversy, there's
[1:37:09] no doubt about this statement. For sure
[1:37:13] Lucifer
[1:37:14] would as an angelic being would never be
[1:37:17] in that place.
[1:37:20] He would never be a son.
[1:37:24] He's an angel. He would never be no
[1:37:27] matter how the original one, the highest
[1:37:29] ranking, it didn't matter. God's
[1:37:32] right-hand man, it didn't matter. Once
[1:37:34] the plan of redemption began to be made
[1:37:36] clear and the scene began to take shape,
[1:37:39] Lucifer knew that there under no
[1:37:41] circumstances
[1:37:43] could he ever be a son. The same way
[1:37:46] that the family of God knows that under
[1:37:48] no circumstances can you ever not be a
[1:37:51] son and daughter of God.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Just as sure as he couldn't be, you must
[1:37:56] be. You shall be. God will cause it to
[1:37:59] be.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:04] So our position then would be occupying
[1:38:06] this space that would open up in
[1:38:09] redemption wherein wherein although and
[1:38:13] I'll use brother Brandham's language I
[1:38:15] am not he.
[1:38:18] See he said I am not the son of man. I'm
[1:38:23] a son of man revealing the son of man.
[1:38:27] See, so although once this plan of
[1:38:31] redemption began to take place, it
[1:38:33] became apparent that the family was
[1:38:37] being formed for the express purpose to
[1:38:40] bring glory to God by being able just as
[1:38:43] Jesus did, just as Paul did, just as a
[1:38:46] prophet did to take every spirit under
[1:38:48] your control for the glory of God. No
[1:38:51] matter because listen, this is this is
[1:38:53] what's happening under redemption. And
[1:38:55] this is what Satan could never come to
[1:38:56] that no matter what would happen that
[1:38:59] although I am not he and neither am I
[1:39:02] the son of man but as a child of God
[1:39:05] when I put the word of God on my lips
[1:39:08] and the anointing of the Holy Spirit is
[1:39:09] upon me then I operate creation powers
[1:39:13] it's the same as God speaking and that's
[1:39:16] what Lucifer didn't have he didn't have
[1:39:19] the power of creation
[1:39:21] say oh I don't I don't see me creating
[1:39:23] anything a prophet already showed you
[1:39:25] under the third pull. It will create
[1:39:27] something out of nothing.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you something,
[1:39:30] friends. What you are to do is realize
[1:39:33] the position that you have being
[1:39:34] redeemed in Christ. And when you go to
[1:39:36] your home, I don't care what the devil
[1:39:38] invades your life, invades your home,
[1:39:40] invade your family, you are to walk in
[1:39:42] in faith and say under the authority as
[1:39:44] a child of God, I commit the Holy Spirit
[1:39:47] that he will take control of every foul
[1:39:50] spirit. Cast it out of your home. Cast
[1:39:52] it out of your life. cast it out of your
[1:39:54] family. You have the authority. And
[1:39:57] that's what Satan doesn't want you to
[1:39:58] know.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He was furious when Isaiah outed him in
[1:40:04] Isaiah 14. He didn't want anyone to know
[1:40:07] the desire that he had had in his heart
[1:40:09] because that exposes him.
[1:40:13] See, so
[1:40:15] it operates creation power and [snorts]
[1:40:18] with the tremendous stamina
[1:40:22] that it takes to you know in this
[1:40:26] impossible hour to remain
[1:40:30] constantly spiritually minded.
[1:40:33] Am I am is that true? It's a constant,
[1:40:37] this is such a dark, such an impossible
[1:40:40] time to constantly, you have to
[1:40:42] constantly, you can't afford to not read
[1:40:44] your Bible every day. You can't afford
[1:40:46] to not pray every day. You can't afford
[1:40:48] to miss church. You can't afford to not
[1:40:49] fellowship. You can't afford to live on
[1:40:51] an island. You can't you cannot afford
[1:40:54] to not come into contact with the moving
[1:40:56] real power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friend.
[1:41:01] get to where you can enter in and out
[1:41:03] and go in and out of the presence of God
[1:41:05] and let the let the word saturate your
[1:41:08] being and the world will look different
[1:41:10] to you when you do that. I'm here to
[1:41:12] tell you something friends that uh you
[1:41:14] know if you some sometimes I wonder if
[1:41:17] we have the courage today. I wonder if
[1:41:19] you do and if you don't I'm hoping that
[1:41:22] I can inspire you today and I would say
[1:41:24] to you do you have the courage uh you
[1:41:28] know to stand and say today I am a
[1:41:33] member of the divine family.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; I'm in that number robed in white.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Are you in that number? It's a
[1:41:47] bloodwashed number. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:41:50] we've had an example uh of the sheath
[1:41:53] waving in our day.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; We've had an example of the sheath
[1:41:58] waving in our day. Listen friends, that
[1:42:01] that let me say it to you. That wasn't
[1:42:02] just a mere consequence of his prophetic
[1:42:05] office. That was his dedication and his
[1:42:09] con consecration to God on a daily
[1:42:12] basis. And and and so when I when I look
[1:42:15] at it like that, I wonder if you have
[1:42:16] enough faith in your heart today to take
[1:42:19] authority over the powers of darkness
[1:42:21] that have invaded your life today. You
[1:42:23] don't have to leave here bound. You can
[1:42:25] leave here free. You don't have to worry
[1:42:27] about your home and your family. You
[1:42:29] have been given the authority. That's
[1:42:31] what the third pull is all about. Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; For a bride to come to her position,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; see
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; where we can walk into any situation,
[1:42:43] any situation that the Lord sees fit to
[1:42:46] thrust us into. Amen. And call on the
[1:42:49] Holy Ghost to take control over every
[1:42:50] spirit.
[1:42:54] [clears throat]
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know. And I'm I I'm watching my
[1:42:57] time. I'm going to finish up here in a
[1:42:59] minute. I don't know if I'll cover all
[1:43:00] this today. It's all right. If I don't,
[1:43:01] we'll have a part five.
[1:43:05] I just want to, you know, take this to
[1:43:08] and turn a corner with it. I don't want
[1:43:09] to a new, it's not a new thought. I'm
[1:43:11] just taking what we've just said. And I
[1:43:14] want you to think about this angle.
[1:43:18] I don't know today. I know for me, I
[1:43:22] don't know for you. I know for my wife
[1:43:24] probably because I live with her. I know
[1:43:27] pretty much for my sons, although
[1:43:28] they've lived independently for me for
[1:43:30] years. So, I know less now about this
[1:43:34] area of their life uh than I did when
[1:43:37] they were under my roof.
[1:43:39] I don't know where or how severely
[1:43:43] Satan
[1:43:45] may have caused you here today. And
[1:43:46] there might only be one person or the
[1:43:48] person might be on across the internet.
[1:43:50] I don't know. All I know is God burdened
[1:43:53] my heart to say it like that. that I
[1:43:56] don't know where or how severely Satan
[1:43:59] has caused you to doubt your identity in
[1:44:01] Christ. You haven't doubted Christ. You
[1:44:04] haven't doubted the word for your hour.
[1:44:07] You're a believer for real. See, but
[1:44:10] brother Brandham talks about a certain
[1:44:11] thing called spiritual uh amnesia.
[1:44:15] And a lot of times, and he said the
[1:44:17] thing that'll cause spiritual amnesia is
[1:44:19] halting between two opinions for too
[1:44:22] long.
[1:44:24] You're not just a, you know, it's like
[1:44:25] brother Matthew's sermon about, you
[1:44:27] know, uh, the the traffic circle. That
[1:44:29] traffic circle is not made for you just
[1:44:31] to drive around and around. It's meant
[1:44:32] to go in it and drive out of it. You're
[1:44:34] going somewhere. See? And so, a lot of
[1:44:38] times people lose the a sense of their
[1:44:40] spiritual identity. I don't know. Maybe
[1:44:42] it's been a a long trial that has left
[1:44:45] you feeling blasted and worn and, you
[1:44:49] know, more more dim days and long nights
[1:44:53] than you can count. And I just challenge
[1:44:56] you today on the authority of the word
[1:45:00] to to just once and for all throw all
[1:45:03] your reasoning out that your reasoning
[1:45:06] that sees all your own failures and all
[1:45:08] your own shortcomings and lift up your
[1:45:11] head. Your redemption draws nigh.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what we are coming to
[1:45:17] friends. That is what God is here to set
[1:45:19] you free from every condemnation and
[1:45:21] every weakness that keeps you bound. I
[1:45:24] just would say today, take courage and
[1:45:26] say, I am a member of the bloodwashed
[1:45:28] family. I am a member. I shouted around
[1:45:31] the throne and my my future is bright
[1:45:34] and my future is certain and I'm here to
[1:45:36] see the devil defeated. I'm not here to
[1:45:38] linger in Leodysa. [screaming] I'm
[1:45:40] recognizing who I am
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; and that I can do the greater works
[1:45:46] because of knowing who I am.
[1:45:49] See, whatever prisoners chain Satan has
[1:45:53] slipped on you, they can't hold you.
[1:45:55] You're predestinated
[1:45:57] not to fall and get left behind in
[1:46:02] Satan's Eden.
[1:46:05] I'm going to close with this quote
[1:46:06] today. I can feel the Holy Spirit giving
[1:46:08] me a green light
[1:46:12] to close.
[1:46:19] soul
[1:46:25] knowing that I have
[1:46:28] knowing
[1:46:30] that I have this authority over Satan.
[1:46:35] When my life,
[1:46:37] and this is a big if,
[1:46:40] if my life is guided and controlled by
[1:46:44] the Holy Ghost,
[1:46:47] then then the uh
[1:46:50] the the play here is not to
[1:46:55] see how I can exert superhuman willpower
[1:46:59] to be an overcomer. That's that's not
[1:47:02] the play. That's what Satan wants you to
[1:47:04] get trapped in because that's just a
[1:47:07] traffic circle. You know why? Because
[1:47:08] you'll never completely defeat that. And
[1:47:11] every time he trips you or stumbles you,
[1:47:14] even in the slightest, you'll realize
[1:47:15] you're still in a traffic circle. And
[1:47:17] that's just no place for a believer. Oh,
[1:47:20] I want to ascend the heights. I want to
[1:47:22] be like an eagle. I want to soar.
[1:47:24] Friends, do you understand that this is
[1:47:26] what the plan of redemption is to
[1:47:28] accomplish? And and it's not about
[1:47:31] trying to use maximum human willpower.
[1:47:34] Instead, here's what you can control.
[1:47:37] Remove anything or any person from your
[1:47:41] life that keeps you from moving closer
[1:47:44] to the Lord.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; See, you thought I was going to give you
[1:47:49] some super hard to understand
[1:47:51] prescription. I haven't. It's like
[1:47:53] Peter. What do we do? Repent. What does
[1:47:55] repent mean? Turn and go the other way.
[1:47:57] See that? It's not about using maximum
[1:48:01] human power. I'm reading my own line to
[1:48:03] you. Instead, remove anything or any
[1:48:08] person. And you know what they are.
[1:48:13] You might hide it from me. You can't
[1:48:15] hide it from him. It might be a person.
[1:48:18] You know who it is.
[1:48:19] say, see, you got to remove anything or
[1:48:22] any person from your life that keeps you
[1:48:25] away from moving closer to the Lord. If
[1:48:29] you will do that, he will take over your
[1:48:33] will.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And it won't be you exerting your will,
[1:48:37] you you know what you'll have? You'll
[1:48:39] have the same inside power that he
[1:48:43] exercised in the wilderness.
[1:48:47] Brother Brandham said he could have used
[1:48:50] his great power. Satan said, "You're
[1:48:53] hungry." That was true. Turn these rocks
[1:48:55] into bread. He could have done it. But
[1:48:57] brother Brandham says, "I'm so glad we
[1:48:58] had a prophet." Boy, we just there's so
[1:49:00] much we wouldn't know. I couldn't have
[1:49:03] preached 80% of this sermon today if I
[1:49:05] didn't have a prophet giving me the
[1:49:07] insider trading info
[1:49:11] [sighs]
[1:49:13] so that I can make the right investment.
[1:49:15] [laughter]
[1:49:16] Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] Say that's cheating. It's It's not
[1:49:19] cheating that I'm born a son of God.
[1:49:21] That's not cheating. That's not fair or
[1:49:23] unfair. It just is. See, I was born in
[1:49:26] the family of God. So,
[1:49:29] Brother Brandham said Jesus could have
[1:49:31] used his power for those things, but he
[1:49:33] didn't want to use his great power. He
[1:49:36] wanted to prove to his family coming
[1:49:39] behind him, the ones that would worship
[1:49:41] him in spirit and in truth once the Holy
[1:49:43] Ghost was given
[1:49:45] that that family could overcome no
[1:49:47] matter what the devil threw at him.
[1:49:49] Whatever he threw at Jesus in the
[1:49:51] wilderness, Jesus overcame it by simply
[1:49:54] two things. Standing on the word of God
[1:49:56] and knowing who he was.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Bon talks about that in Is
[1:50:01] worthy of the gospel. It's a question we
[1:50:03] need to ask ourselves every day we wake
[1:50:05] up. Is my life worthy of the gospel? And
[1:50:08] if it's not, fix it.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; See, and brother Brandham says, "Jesus
[1:50:13] never screamed at devils. He didn't have
[1:50:17] to."
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; See, I know I scream all the time. I I
[1:50:20] get loud. That's just me. This is who I
[1:50:22] am. But Jesus never screamed at devils.
[1:50:25] Brother Brandham didn't. Very few times
[1:50:28] do I You ever hear Brother Brandham
[1:50:29] raise his voice. A few times. You can
[1:50:30] hear it on tape where he literally yells
[1:50:32] out. almost takes you back when you hear
[1:50:34] like whoa wow he really meant that and
[1:50:36] you know Satan come out of him you know
[1:50:38] and wow wow what did did I hear that
[1:50:40] wrong running back you know usually he's
[1:50:42] just a very calm come out of him Satan
[1:50:45] you know oh here's one crying and you
[1:50:47] see that black streak now you're both
[1:50:48] delivered see and so you know here's a
[1:50:52] person and you've got this problem and
[1:50:53] that problem this problem are these
[1:50:55] things true yes you don't have them
[1:50:56] anymore go and praise the Lord amen
[1:50:59] hallelujah that's what I want my life to
[1:51:01] do is to praise and worship the Lord.
[1:51:03] But brother Brandham said he never
[1:51:05] screamed and yelled I I can't remember
[1:51:07] which word it uses exactly at devils bec
[1:51:12] because he knew who he was.
[1:51:15] So now
[1:51:17] now we come to this quote and with this
[1:51:21] I close
[1:51:25] prophet starts with now remember this.
[1:51:29] So, I can say to you today, if you
[1:51:32] forget, I know you won't because what
[1:51:34] I'm about to read is going to is going
[1:51:35] to augment everything I've said.
[1:51:39] But here's what a prophet wanted you to
[1:51:40] remember above all things.
[1:51:43] He's not saying, "Remember how many
[1:51:46] zeros are in your bank account,
[1:51:49] you know, remember how handsome you are.
[1:51:52] Remember how many friends you've got,
[1:51:53] remember how many likes you have,
[1:51:55] remember how many followers you've got."
[1:51:57] No, remember this. Christ, I'm gonna
[1:52:01] read it slow. Absorb the words. Christ
[1:52:04] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:52:09] the book of Acts.
[1:52:12] Remember that when you go from here
[1:52:14] today, remember that Christ in the true
[1:52:18] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:52:21] Acts. Thank you, brother Brandham. How
[1:52:24] does that how's that going to work? What
[1:52:26] would that look like? Glad you asked.
[1:52:28] The book of Revelation shows how that
[1:52:32] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:52:34] the church and how and defile it. Make
[1:52:39] it lukewarm man. Yeah. Formal
[1:52:43] powerless. Oh boy. It exposes what does
[1:52:48] revelation. It exposes Satan revealing
[1:52:53] his works. Now, what are his works? The
[1:52:56] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:53:00] and the discrediting of God's word. Do
[1:53:03] you see how that connects?
[1:53:06] The whole way that he's going to
[1:53:08] discredit God's word is the destruction
[1:53:11] of God's people. He already knows he
[1:53:14] can't beat Jesus.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; He already knows Michael already whipped
[1:53:19] him. That's that's been tried. It
[1:53:22] failed. He got tossed. See, so he he
[1:53:26] knows. Here's what he knows. It exposes
[1:53:30] Satan, revealing his works, his
[1:53:32] attempted destruction of God's people,
[1:53:34] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:53:38] down to the time he is cast into the
[1:53:41] lake of fire. That's why I said he's
[1:53:42] going to fight. He's going to make one
[1:53:44] last coup attempt at the end of the
[1:53:45] millennium. See, if you expect him to
[1:53:49] just leave you alone, you're going to
[1:53:51] have to become undesirable for him to be
[1:53:53] around.
[1:53:57] You're going to have to smell like
[1:53:58] righteousness. He don't like that smell.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; You're going have to smell like
[1:54:03] holiness. He You want a repellent? Live
[1:54:06] a holy life.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Stay in prayer. Read your Bible. Let the
[1:54:10] living image of the living word live
[1:54:11] through you. And that's when you'll walk
[1:54:14] down the street and demons seeing you
[1:54:15] coming will howl and faint run the other
[1:54:17] direction. That's when you'll take every
[1:54:19] spirit under the control of the Holy
[1:54:20] Ghost for the glory of God. Not your
[1:54:22] glory, but for the glory of God.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; His attempted destruction of God's
[1:54:27] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:54:29] word. Matt, bring your team and come on.
[1:54:32] Keep paying attention now. I'm reading
[1:54:33] this out slow.
[1:54:38] Right down to the time he is cast into
[1:54:41] the lake of fire.
[1:54:43] He fights that he cannot stand it.
[1:54:47] Fights what? Can't understand what
[1:54:50] revelation working in your life.
[1:54:53] Revelation of what? The word. And what
[1:54:56] is the revelation of the word? Who you
[1:54:58] are in Christ. Who you are always were
[1:55:01] going to be. See, write down. Okay. He
[1:55:05] knows. He fights that. See, so he
[1:55:08] fights.
[1:55:10] What he can't stand is you realizing
[1:55:13] what I'm preaching today and you
[1:55:16] believing it. And so he fights it. Do
[1:55:19] you know how he fights it? By stumbling
[1:55:21] you so that you go, man, everybody must
[1:55:24] have got it but me. It's not about that.
[1:55:26] I This isn't hocus pocus. I'm not
[1:55:28] reading out of a magic book. I'm not
[1:55:31] speaking magic words over you. I'm
[1:55:33] giving you the unadulterated word of
[1:55:35] God. And it has creation power inside of
[1:55:38] it. See,
[1:55:40] so he knows it. He He fights it. He
[1:55:42] cannot stand it. He knows. Here's what
[1:55:44] Satan knows. Boy, he did not like you
[1:55:47] knowing this. that if the people who the
[1:55:52] family, the redeemed family, that if the
[1:55:55] people get the true revelation of the
[1:55:58] true church and what she is, what she
[1:56:04] stands for and that she can do the
[1:56:07] greater works, she will be an invincible
[1:56:11] army
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:56:17] spirits within the framework. work of
[1:56:19] the Christian church. As long as you are
[1:56:23] seeing the the impersonation of
[1:56:26] Christianity is not real Christianity.
[1:56:29] That the message of the hour brought you
[1:56:31] real Christianity. As long as you can
[1:56:34] see that and discern the two spirits.
[1:56:36] See, and
[1:56:39] you want to talk about something that an
[1:56:40] alarms a pastor's heart is to see
[1:56:44] believers who I know are real believers
[1:56:47] for real.
[1:56:49] I know they're children of God. I know
[1:56:50] they are. Their many years and their
[1:56:52] testimony proves it. And and I and and
[1:56:54] their spirit, you know, um I feel it in
[1:56:57] my spirit. And and then to see them
[1:57:01] moving into areas and intermingling and
[1:57:03] rubbing shoulders with things that are
[1:57:05] the part of the false spirit of the
[1:57:07] false church. And they're getting easy
[1:57:10] around that. and they're getting
[1:57:12] comfortable around that kind of a uh you
[1:57:14] know because oh well it's the name of
[1:57:16] Christianity and it's really barely
[1:57:17] anything more than admiring as brother
[1:57:19] Brandham said admiring the fine
[1:57:21] qualities of Jesus who wouldn't is a man
[1:57:24] to be admired see but that's not the
[1:57:26] same as being born again see so I'm
[1:57:30] worried when I see you doing that that
[1:57:31] you're not discerning the true spirit
[1:57:35] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:57:36] the Christian church you already discern
[1:57:39] the spirit of Christ you know the
[1:57:40] message is true, but you're failing to
[1:57:42] understand that that spirit you're
[1:57:44] rubbing shoulders with that's causing
[1:57:46] you to dress like the world, act like
[1:57:48] the world, think like the world, chase
[1:57:50] after the world, that's the other
[1:57:52] spirit.
[1:57:56] So when she stands that she can do the
[1:57:59] greater works, she'll be an invincible
[1:58:00] army. If they get a true revelation of
[1:58:02] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:58:04] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:58:08] discern and
[1:58:10] withstand,
[1:58:12] say it with me, withstand
[1:58:15] the antichrist spirit. Satan, good news.
[1:58:19] Good news. Satan will be powerless
[1:58:23] before her.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; You ought to just rejoice. Satan will be
[1:58:29] powerless before you. He will be as
[1:58:33] definitely thwarted today in you. I'm
[1:58:37] add I'm adding that in you as when
[1:58:40] Christ withstood his every effort to
[1:58:42] gain power over him in the desert. See,
[1:58:46] Satan was simply not willing to play
[1:58:50] second fiddle to you, but he could see
[1:58:52] it coming. And thus, he's launched his
[1:58:56] plan today. But God has given you the
[1:58:59] remedy.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet, friends.
[1:59:03] Amen. Sing for us, brother Matt.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know who you are.

[2:04:06] I worship me.
[2:04:09] Glory. I was small [music] by Yes sir.
[2:04:13] Born
[2:04:16] to life. [music]
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. I was
[2:04:21] born. Sing it [music] again. Come on.
[2:04:26] Why would I make a pain in my shame when
[2:04:31] [music] a mountain of grace is running
[2:04:34] my way? I know I am.
[2:04:39] I [music] was made
[2:04:43] [singing]
[2:04:46] cuz [music] I wasn't made to be tending
[2:04:50] a grave. I was [music] called by name.
[2:04:53] Come on, voices.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Born and [singing] raised back to life
[2:04:58] again.
[2:05:00] I was [music]
[2:05:01] made for more. [singing]
[2:05:08] [applause and music]
[2:05:13] Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. You love
[2:05:18] the Lord. Are you a believer?
[2:05:22] Do you believe that you're more than you
[2:05:24] thought you were? Amen. [music]
[2:05:25] That's the last thing in the world the
[2:05:28] devil wants you to accept is what Christ
[2:05:31] has did for you abs absolutely as an
[2:05:33] absolute. It's irrevocable. It's
[2:05:37] unimpeachable.
[2:05:39] It's already finished in Christ. [music]
[2:05:41] And he has sent us a word today. And we
[2:05:43] are identified as believers because our
[2:05:46] whole life's cry, my whole crowd, my
[2:05:48] whole heart is Lord, bring me by
[2:05:51] whatever means necessary. That's a
[2:05:53] strong prayer. You got to have some
[2:05:55] faith to pray that because you don't
[2:05:56] know what all that might mean. Depends
[2:05:58] on how obstinate you are. But you know
[2:06:01] something I have found out? I don't
[2:06:04] trust me to lead me.
[2:06:06] I don't have confidence me can get me
[2:06:08] there. And so I just constantly say to
[2:06:10] the Lord, Lord, I know this. You're all
[2:06:12] wise. Whatever you do will be in your
[2:06:14] wisdom. Do whatever [music] you need to
[2:06:16] do. I just want to be exactly everything
[2:06:19] the word said I would be. I want to be
[2:06:22] that no matter what it [music] costs me.
[2:06:24] No matter what you say, well, what what
[2:06:26] if it's this? I don't know. But whatever
[2:06:28] it is, whatever he does, I know he has
[2:06:30] supreme wisdom and knows it's for my
[2:06:33] good. What difference will it make
[2:06:34] 10,000 years from now if you lose
[2:06:36] something that gets you there? If you
[2:06:39] have to, you know, make a change, you
[2:06:42] know, I promise you in 10,000 years,
[2:06:44] you'll be a happy camper.
[2:06:47] I promise [music] you, you'll never be
[2:06:49] sorry. You'll never be left holding the
[2:06:52] bag or get the short end of the stick
[2:06:55] when you when you trust in the Lord.
[2:06:57] Amen. Let's bow our heads across the
[2:06:59] building.
[2:07:03] I thank you Lord as I stand [snorts]
[2:07:05] here today and feel a peace in my heart
[2:07:07] that what was needed saying was said and
[2:07:12] I can confess that [music] it all came
[2:07:14] from you. Nothing came out of my own
[2:07:16] thinking. There's so much there that is
[2:07:19] precarious because we don't have all the
[2:07:21] answers. We have to just lean on what a
[2:07:23] prophet some of it we don't even
[2:07:25] understand. I don't even can't even
[2:07:27] fully get my mind around it. But I know
[2:07:30] what I'm taught in the scriptures. I can
[2:07:32] see what it says plainly. I know what a
[2:07:34] prophet said plainly. My confidence is
[2:07:36] in there. Why wouldn't it be when I've
[2:07:39] seen what it can do to my life and the
[2:07:41] lives of those I love when I've seen the
[2:07:43] change that it can make. Why wouldn't I
[2:07:45] trust it? How foolish I would be after
[2:07:49] everything that you've done and I see
[2:07:50] you doing on a daily basis to doubt you
[2:07:53] right here at the finish line. Lord, may
[2:07:55] it never be. May you increase our faith,
[2:07:57] Lord. increase our courage Lord. I don't
[2:08:00] want to be uh I don't want to be an
[2:08:03] obstacle to the flow of your life
[2:08:06] shining a light in the world. So do in
[2:08:08] me what is necessary. [music]
[2:08:11] I commit myself I commit all these
[2:08:13] people into your hands in Jesus name.
[2:08:16] Amen. Turn around and shake hands with
[2:08:17] somebody standing near your friends.
[2:08:19] We'll let you be dismissed.
[2:08:21] Go in the love of God. You will stay and
[2:08:25] worship.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; You want to worship. God bless you. You
[2:08:28] can [music] be dismissed at your
[2:08:29] leisure.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you see
[2:08:34] with eyes of love. [singing]
[2:08:39] A hopeless
[2:08:42] case,
[2:08:44] an empty
[2:08:46] place
[2:08:49] if not for grave.
[2:08:54] Where would I be? [music]
[2:08:58] You only know.
[2:09:03] I'm glad you see
[2:09:08] through eyes [singing]
[2:09:10] of love.
[2:09:12] [music]
[2:09:13] A hopeless
[2:09:15] case,
[2:09:17] [music] an empty
[2:09:20] place.
[2:09:23] If not for [music] grace.
[2:09:26] Amazing grace. Amazing grace.
[2:09:30] [music and singing]
[2:09:32] How sweet the sound.
[2:09:36] Oh, I once was lost. [singing and music]
[2:09:41] Thank God
[2:09:43] I'm found.
[2:09:45] Oh, I was a hopeless
[2:09:49] case.
[2:09:51] An empty [music]
[2:09:53] place
[2:09:56] if not for grace.
[2:10:01] Precious [music]
[2:10:02] Lord, [singing]
[2:10:05] please take my hand.
[2:10:10] Lead [music]
[2:10:11] me home [singing]
[2:10:15] and let me stand.
[2:10:19] was a hopeless
[2:10:22] case,
[2:10:24] an empty
[2:10:26] place.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; If not for grace,
[2:10:34] where would I be?
