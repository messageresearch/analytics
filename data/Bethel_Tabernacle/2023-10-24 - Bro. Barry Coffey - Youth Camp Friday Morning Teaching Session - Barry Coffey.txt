========================================

our eyes we want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him to say that we love [Music] open [Music] our and help us to open our eyes we want to see you can be seated morning God bless you this morning good to be in God's house my kind of church we have food and and uh and service all rolled up into the same event that's all right well God bless you uh it is uh really neat to see all of you and I don't know all of your names so I thought if you don't mind we'd start this morning by everybody saying their name yes that'll be all right okay but we're kind of crimped on time so I thought why don't we just go ahead and do it together so on the count of three tell me your name 1 2 3 God bless you my name is Pastor Bob shumu and I'm glad to be here today and uh we're going to have to go fast all right if you have your Bible take it we're going to go to the Book of Joshua chapter 2 if you don't have your Bible everything is on the screen I'll leave this PowerPoint with you so uh you can go back and look at it again but we're going to kind of go fast I normally talk 150 words a minute but I'll probably Guss to 220 today so stay with me and they're cleaning and so forth so uh just kind of bear with me uh I've talked at a lot of Youth Camps over my years I counted last night I was out as Andrew was preaching and it's been about a hundred years since I've been preaching Youth Camp so I probably spoke to most of your parents at some point in life and there's a couple of basic things that I think are good to talk about when it comes to meetings like this and uh they deserve more than what we're going to give it today but I'll give you some uh things maybe to think about all right so as we look in the Scripture it says uh in Joshua 2 10 therefore I pray you swear unto me this is Rahab and she's speaking to the two spies that have come she knows the city is going down she knows this this is not going to last and she's standing there in her house and she says I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token in other words she's saying I heard the exploits of your God and I know your God's going to roll through here and we're in the way and that's not a good place to be God is fulfilling his word he's bringing it to pass and Jericho stands right in the middle and they have an attitude and that's never a good place to be with God so I know this city is is the days of this city are numbered so you're saying that you have a token or uh a place where I can be that I'll I'll be exempt from the Judgment that's that's inevitable and she said give me that token but I want the real thing I don't want to make believe thing I want the real thing I want I want whatever it is that's going to help me to get through the Judgment here because I know it's an evitable we also believe that judgment is inevitable isn't that right and for me I don't know about you but but for me I want to have the real thing I don't want to come to the end of the road and I don't want to see judgment strike America in a fuller way and not have the real thing how many of you want to have the real thing I know all your names now so I saw those that didn't raise your hand but I I want to have the real thing I don't want to be climbing the ladder that's leaning against the wrong wall I want to be in the right place at the right time focused on the right things I want to have the right kind of faith and faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word and in order for your faith to be right you got to be hearing right and God sent us the right thing in order to believe right to get out of here before judgment strikes are we okay yes so brother bam said and uh in 1950 he said now uh by the way I'm probably not going to read all of these quotes what you'll have the PowerPoint if you want it brother Bam's talking about the day of Pentecost and Peter said it's for you and your children as many as the Lord Our God shall call and every person that enters into the baptism of the spirit can have the same kind said say that again every person that enters into the baptism of the Holy Spirit everybody believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit you don't believe as much as I do I believe it's absolutely essential it is initial it is it is absolutely imperative that you have an encounter with God we're a people who like to Google everything and we like information in God's view an encounter is better than information is that all right an experience is better than knowledge so therefore brother random says every person that enters into the baptism of the Holy Spirit can have the same kind of holy ghost that they got on the day of Pentecost same kind brother brand didn't bring another Holy Ghost Paul didn't have a different version than brother BR as matter of fact brother Graham said the way Paul preached it that's the way I preach it not something that look like it but the real thing say it with me the real thing that's what Paul preached and the real Holy Ghost brings for for the same kind of an Evidence and proof at they head back there it comes with the same Holy Ghost Hallelujah and everybody said okay now so therefore we we want to take a look at this because this is interesting uh in the Old Testament the only way that people had to learn about God was if somebody told them because they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit right so there are a lots of scriptures that are like this Deuteronomy chapter 4 take heed to thyself this is Moses speaking to the uh of the fathers and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart with all the days of thy life so fathers had to have it but look what he said but teach them to thy sons and thy Sons Sons so our responsibility as fathers and grandfathers was to pass on the knowledge the exploits the Miracles the testimonies the Commandments of God pass them on to our children because you know what they didn't have an altar call like we have they didn't have uh you know what the baptism of the Holy Spirit this is prior to the day of Pentecost and so therefore the way that young people knew about God is that somebody told them over later in the New Testament we find that in the Book of Ezekiel and you'll also find this in Jeremiah CH 31 God begins to elude to this new thing and if you find in jeremi Jeremiah 31 3435 uh Jeremiah starts talking about behold I'll do a new thing in the earth and God keeps saying about this new thing and he says in Ezekiel CH 36 he's prepping Israel for what's coming he said then I will sprinkle when I do this new thing I'll sprinkle water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your Idols will I cleanse you and a new heart will I also give you hey nobody knew what that meant right nobody knew what that meant a new heart wow dude and they're listening to him talk about it and he says and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a give you and heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them you're not going to need somebody to tell you or teach you who God is you'll know because you will have met God and God will actually put a portion of his spirit and his life in you that's right and that will cause you to walk in his statutes and in his ways does that make sense the Old Testament they never had this experience but God was telling him it was it was coming in Acts 13 uh uh the the uh the promise was taken from the Jews and given to the Gentiles and when that happened you know what we were privy to the new birth and so today you're the benefactor of this right here this is what God Said I believe it'll go back to the Jews but today you're the people who uh dwell in the land last verse dwell in the land that I gave your fathers and ye shall be my people and I'll be your God in other words this is not just uh you know the awareness of The Commandments and knowledge of God but he's talking about a relationship here this is a new relationship with me and God said I don't want to be just giving you stones with Commandments on it I want to actually walk with you I want to be with you I want to live in you I want to fellowship with you in a way that nobody's ever had it before except maybe Adam in the Garden of Eden when God walked and talked with him right everybody following I'm at 220 gusting to 220 so stay with me so therefore uh this is this is what God promised Israel and I believe that the new birth therefore is an essential thing so let's put it this way I'm a graphic guy so let's put it this way we know that our sin separated us from God didn't it and there was nothing really we could do about that people try to deal with that in different ways they try to do good deeds they try to live a moral life uh they will try to uh go to church enough they'll try to uh you know give out give money or whatever else and all of it falls short because there is no way to close that gap between us and God but the good news is that Jesus Christ stood in the Gap paid the price and made it possible to have this relationship with God isn't that right how many are thankful for that brother B said in desperation Methodist say well when you get happy enough to shout that's it Pentecostal say speak in tongues and you got it and we find out that all of it was wrong are they bad things no they're not bad things but the initial evidence is not a gift the initial evidence is not a feeling the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word for your day isn't that right the token is the token it's you and Christ as persons together it's the Holy Spirit his life in you working his own life through you my question to you this morning is what does that look like what does that look like when you come down the aisle from the altar we hear a lot about uh you know coming into the altar surrendering uh receiving the baptism of the holy spirit it's all true it's all biblical it's all right it's all appropriate but what does it look like when you walk back down the aisle and go to your seat what does it look like when you drive home and now you're living in your house and you find that uh even though you've had a new experience you go back to a house where everything is the same as it was before you left what does it look like when you go to your job or your school or your uh your church and everything is just the same as what it was before you left for camp and so I'm asking you this morning what does it look like over these two sessions we're going to talk about what that looks like okay so uh that's that's a theme and we want to make sure that first of all we have the real thing and Rahab said I don't want to have a faith and I don't want to have a counterfeit and I just don't want to have a good feeling and a fuzzy uh fuzzy feeling here I want to have the real thing I want to have the real Goods cuz I know I know Jericho's going down brother B said in the message sorry brother B said in the message like he said that's the way it is with some of the shaan's religion I believe in being born again and everybody said go back to the beginning die out and be remolded and if you don't there's going to be a blow up down the road uh along the road it'll blow up on you when the pressure comes right you're going to need to have something let me tell you uh with with the things that are happening in the world uh today and things that are happening in Israel and that's our time clock isn't it Israel's our time clock the Gentiles are not the time piece Israel is a Time piece and there are significant things that are changing in Israel that will never be the same 9/11 prove to us that the world can change in a very short period of time they're calling this their 911 therefore it'll never be the same in Israel or in the Middle East ever again and so therefore you need to be ready because God's going to roll on he's going to roll on and he's not going to be very sympathetic to your excuses for not rolling on with God and he wants you to he wants you to grow up and like brother Andrew said uh you know we're not children anymore you're old enough to come to Camp you're old enough to uh you know be here without your parents most of you and uh I think it's an important thing for us to recognize the hour that we've come to but you know that right you know that here's two things that we also need to remind ourselves of number one John 10 they said to Jesus if thou be the Christ tell us plainly tell us in a way that we don't have to have Revelation to know on cuz they didn't have any Revelation right so just tell us plainly and Jesus answered them and said I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me that's right but ye believe not because you are not of my sheep and I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me we don't know how this works but we know it works right and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never Perish Say that with me never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand glory to God in other words you can't be taken away if you're if you're a possession of God if you're a gene of God you can't be plucked out of his hand all of you should say a quiet and deep amen thank you Jesus because you don't always feel close to God right you don't always feel like you got it right you don't always feel like you got it all together but I will tell you this if Jesus said no one can pluck them out of my hand you ought to go out of here a little bit more confident than when you came in the second thing that we need to know as we go into this is found in Luke chapter 8 and this is a story of gadera and when Jesus sailed across the uh the sea and went to the other side of gadera where the land of gadera that's where the man was who was possessed with the Legion of devils remember the story everybody remember the story put your hand up some of you do all right so this guy was possessed by a legion of devils and nobody went near him and nobody went near the area that he lived okay and uh Jesus rolls up there in a boat and uh you know he he walks up and this demon recognizes Jesus Jesus recognizes the demon and this is just after he calmed the storm remember on the sea and all of this and the disciples were thinking wow you know man it can't get any better better than this but just watch so Jesus has this confrontation with this man listen now he has a confrontation with this man and those demons are cast out they go into the swine the swine run down the hill the people in the village are upset uh because that's our livelihood after all you know my goodness you could have got a flock of birds but uh you send all our livelihood down into the sea and now they're all dead now what's interesting is this okay the Bible says in Luke 8 then they went out to see what was done the people in the village went out to see what was done because news travel fast they didn't need to have texting in that day to know what took place when Jesus came through something always happened and word spray quickly and they and they went out to see what was done and they came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the Devils were departed sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and then he's right in mine and they were afraid all right there's two things that are significant here number one is that that man needed to experience God in a real way right he needed to have that encounter with God and the miraculous and the supernatural happen I believe that many times that's necessary when somebody uh is bound by uh demons or Darkness they need to come and they need to be delivered by the Lord Jesus himself and I believe he's still able to do that I hope you do too yes sir and when they found this man the result of that Supernatural experience was now he dresses right now he's acting right and now he's probably got long sleeves cuz he's covered up his tattoos and he's just sitting there and listening to Jesus he's just sitting there and he wants to be wherever Jesus is matter of fact Jesus tells him to go home and tell his family what's been done he said hey no I want to stick around here I want to hear what you have to say because if I can have that kind of an experience I want to hang around where you are I want to be where you are my point is this I believe we need to have both kinds of experiences the supernatural experience where we meet God but also the experience of sitting at the feet of Jesus and learning what he has to say I believe he need both it's not just one it's not just a supernatural over and over again because after those demons were cast out he didn't say to Jesus do it again he didn't say that right he got he got dressed sat down at the feet of Jesus and he said I want to hear what he has to say but it is not just an intellectual process where he sits down and listens to teaching he's experienced the Supernatural and now he's learning the word of God he's subjecting himself to the word of God I believe that you need both and I believe this if you have a real encounter with God it'll bring you to the feet of Jesus Amen did you hear me I believe if you have a real encounter with God not just an emotional work up but if you have an encounter with God it'll drive you to the word of God it'll drive you to a place where you can have your soul fed now because you're feeding on the right thing did everybody agree amen so let's look now at what those are two things that we know a token is a representation of something that's required it is something that uh is an exchange a voucher can be exchanged for something uh for goods or services like a plane ticket and the plane ticket in itself means oh its value is zero uh because it's just a little piece of paper but it represents something right it represents the fact that you paid a price and this is what uh this is what uh Rahab wanted so you might ask the question and it would be a very legitimate question at this point how do I get it how do I get the token that's a good question thank you for asking the good question here's what brother man said the token is a sign that the purchase has been paid that's right right and been accepted and you can't get the token from the railroad until you pay the price now somebody has to pay the price in our case we didn't have to pay the price Jesus did everybody say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and believe it and accept it and full obedience I'm a repeater so say full obedience full obedience now right I say it with passion all right full obedience full obedience entitles you to the tokal yes full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience is anybody unclear not the part of it as your denomination goes right but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ everybody agree all right let's give it a shot let's try out try it out and see whether you believe it or not brother random says in the odd ball when a man kisses you he has potentially committed adultery with you he's talking to girl everybody say girl you should never let him kiss you until you're married when male and Fe and he explains this when male and female glands come together he said Let It Be Where it may be you have potentially committed adultery if you're not married right right for us for us intimacy intimacy follows commitment Yeah in our world today it's reversed right intimacy precedes commitment but in our world commitment comes first intimacy comes later so he says you shouldn't let a boy kiss you until that fail is raised on your face and you're his wife don't do that it's committing adultery it's mixing male and female glands that's right how many of you believe that full obedience to the Token will uh will entitle you to the Token yeah you know what that's that's something that we had to be fully obedient to everybody all right yeah okay like Andrew said last last night I'm here I might as well preach it that's the way you said it too can I give you another one brother Ram said and be certain of God he said but then in ahab's wedding I mean that must have been quite a wedding right as you got this this mix and instead of marrying among his own people he married a sinner an idolator and he married Jezebel and she was not a Believer yeah and no believer should ever marry an believer under no circumstances unless you met her online no it doesn't say that under no circumstances should always marry Believers that's right I'm a repeater say this after me always marry Believers all right now you say it all right always Mary believer all right now this is one you got to say with passion all right always marry Believers but they have't done this evil thing in the eyes of a prophet here he's calling out an evil thing and no doubt Jezebel was a beautiful woman watch and he fell for what she'd looked like instead of what she was wow she fell he fell for what she looked like instead of what she was and so many people make that same mistake today yeah you believe that full obedience entitles you to the Token here's a that's a real good thing for you to be obedient too that's for sure all right so let's stand back now again and we look at the ages and we've come to the end of the ages as you all know and God's very fixated on on Israel and Jerusalem and uh watch for that that's only going to increase and we know we know by virtue of just biblical understanding that the church goes into apostasy leacy and darkness in this season and a judgment cycle begins but a bride arises up out of that and she's identified and she's aware of the fact that she's living in a bright age and a Rapture cycle actually begins number three the cycle of restoration of Israel begins and I say to you today it's already begun and number four the Antichrist begins to rise in innocence not in power not in dominance but he rises in innocence everybody okay and Paul also says about that time that uh parous times will be the characteristic of our day and perilous times in the Greek language is means Fierce there will come times there will come days that are I mean it's pretty it's pretty fierce in other words you have Fierce opposition to the way uh God wants you to live the Holy Spirit wants you to live a certain way Satan is fiercely opposed to that right not just opposed to that but fiercely opposed to that right and he's going to do whatever he can and the majority of stuff that he does is right here we're not being chased around by armies and we're not being uh you know imprisoned by police we are being trouble right here and a lot of you are sitting there even after last night thinking well I don't have it and I'm not good enough and maybe I made a mistake and maybe God doesn't love me and you're still thinking that and that's because you have Fierce opposition uh to what God wants you to say we are at a point where we are at a point where it's not profitable for you to believe what anybody else says about you but God Amen I said we're at a point where uh you need to be sure you're believing what God says about you and not somebody else we find that in those hours of real stress that's usually when the spirit of God moves in and he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand but when he moves he moves yeah all right let's say it this way God brought those children of Israel at three to the edge of impossible didn't he I mean now the fire is hot and it gets seven times hotter right and now it's impossible for anybody to survive in the atmosphere of that fire and it's impossible to take another step and God says go ahead and make another step he brought him to the edge of impossible and he said he said go ahead now we don't find anywhere where God talks to them and says lo I'll be with you even in the Flames he doesn't say that but those guys know simply one thing that no matter what happens here no matter if God shows up now or if he doesn't we know we're not going to bow to that Idol that's right so whatever takes place now is in the hands of God and we're not going to bow to that that's for sure that's what we do know we don't know what the future holds I mean the sure don't look good but we're we're not going to bow to Idols everybody with me and they're at the edge of impossible and and and and they take another step and when they took another step God met them right there in that place of the above impossible and I'm telling you today I believe we're coming to an hour when we're going to be at the edge of impossible and we need to make another step because there's no going back and I believe when we do God will receive us and meet us at that moment and Deliver us just like he did then if that means what it says right there because when the real stress comes that's when the holy spirit moves in yes sir and remember this if there ain't no pressure there ain't no Diamond that's right everybody okay all right I'm going to move on because I got to move on all right now whenever I do this at home and I have a PowerPoint I always put an aster that a really important quote so that people who are asleep don't wake up or somebody is uh going to wake them up when the uh Quotes come that have an asterics on it now and you can't see the asteris here but I not only have one but I got two I got two I got two quotes here two aspects because this is really important this is really important okay brother the last sermon in this life he says now there's um he says in leadership we're supposed to represent God and eternal life then we should conduct ourselves women and men like the Bible said for us to do you know why because we're representing God and eternal life we are actually his Representatives we're ambassadors for him yes Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born of the spirit of God manifesting the light in our day and scattering that's worth reading again because it's got two Asters on it we're supposed to represent God in eternal life and then we should conduct ourselves women and men like the Bible said for us to do Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born of the spirit of God what a sent this is all one sentence you know that and manifesting the light in our day and scattering so it's not good enough for you just to know it you got to scatter it you got to be active in representing the kingdom to the world you're in and God put you in this age on purpose and God put you in your school on purpose and God put you in your church on purpose and God put you in your job on purpose cuz God knows what he's doing who knew God knew what he was doing but he does right so you're supposed to represent God and the kingdom and eternal life so when people see you in other words the Bible says that I should be able to take any one of you and put you in a crowd and say this is what the message produces this is what the message represents but the Bible says that I should be able to do that and I should be able to go to any one of you without reservation and say hey you're all professors you all profess to believe in the message I should be able to take you and stand you right here and say that's what the message produces the message does not produce cut hair and you know split skirts and all the rest of it I believe that no matter where we are breakfast whether we're in school or whatever else remember you're representing the kingdom of of God you're his representative on this Earth you're not responsible for getting there you're not responsible for changing your body you're representative you're you're sorry you're responsible for representing the kingdom of God right here and expressing what the mind of Christ acts like right and what the spirit of God can do in a human being and rescue them out of the out of the gutter of immorality and have them stand like a Son of God believing that one day my body is going to be changed because God said so right everybody okay so let's give you an example of somebody who I believe had the real thing and his name is David Livingston David Livingston was born in Blantyre Scotland in 1913 great man and he had a passion as a young boy he memorized Psalm 119 and uh he he just had this passion and he had a diary and in that diary he said that the smoke of the burning of a thousand fires in Africa ignites my soul had never been there but he knew somehow he would wind up in Africa he was a cartographer in other words he was a mat maker and a lot of Africa was never mapped and so therefore he was sent by the London Bible society and the London uh geographical Society over to Africa and they paid his way and he wound up going uh to up the zambesi river on the on the east coast of Tanzania uh which was tanganica back then and uh he went and when he went uh he was just newly married and his wife Mary came with him but she caught malaria and had to go home as a matter of fact in in Livingston's life he only spent 5 years total with his wife and had a bunch of kids but he only only spend 5 years with his wife because she got sick some of the kids got sick and they wound up going back to London and living there but Livingston went and when he went he said to God he said God send me anywhere only go with me and lay any burden on me only sustain me and sever any tie in my heart except the tie that binds my heart to yours amen that's what he prayed to God when he left and he said Lord send me anywhere only go with me and that was his calling card he believed that wherever he went God was with him and God would sustain him but in that experience of being in Africa he caught malaria and he was actually quite sick and he and he he uh he died with malaria because there was no there is no cure uh for malaria and he he took a medicine that allowed him to have a little relief from the pain and the suffering of malaria and so uh Livingston uh was a you know a Relentless uh missionary and went from Village to Village and uh he had to deal with all the problems uh that were there as a as a matter of fact uh one day Livingston was walking under a tree and he didn't realize it but there was a line uh perched in the tree and the line fell out of the tree on him and clumped onto his shoulder and he could never use his left arm after that he had a bad fall and he limped all the rest of his life he was walking through the jungle one day and there was a broken branch that had pierced him right in the eye and he only had one eye that he could see out of in the end of his life Livingston was a Relentless man of God and over time he ran R out of his medicine and he suffered greatly and he prayed and he said Lord you said that if you sent me you'd be with me and you'd take care of me according to this prayer right here and he prayed often and asked God to help him one day there was a man who showed up on behalf of the newspaper and his name was Stanley you heard the phrase Stanley Livingston right and Stanley boed himself as being the biggest loudest atheist in the world and he showed up and he said Dr Livingston I presume that's where that phrase came from he W walked through the jungle and finally found caught up with Livingston and he said hey he said Dr Livingston I presume and so he warned he warned Livingston Stanley did he says well I'm here to they sent me to try to find out if you're still alive cuz nobody's heard from you uh they didn't have good email back in that day and so he said I'm here to find out if you're still alive and I found you he said I'm going to stay with you a little while but he said whatever you do don't try to convert me oh and by the way here's some medicine that somebody gave me for you wow and handed him the medicine that he used for the rest of his life 4 months later Stanley was Stanley was converted walking with Livingston through the woods at the end of his life at the end of his life Livingston was almost crippled with malaria he was only in his early 60s but he was almost crippled with arthritis and malaria and in his last day he walked back to his Hut and he had a servant who went with him everywhere great big guy and he walked with him everywhere his name was Chum and when he walked inside of his cabin uh a little bunk that he had there and he had a chair and a desk and so forth and he said to chuma he said I can't make it to my bed and and chuma picked him up and brought him to the edge of his bed and and he said Livingston said hey don't put me in the bed put me next to the bed and he knelt down on his crippled knees and prayed there the next morning chuma came in the room and Livingstone was still there but he was dead that's where he died in prayer wow and when he died it was 150 mi from his Hut to the coast and it was a boat that was leaving for London and so they were going to put his body onto the boat and sail it back to London and today you can visit his grave in London but a very interesting thing happened when chuma laid him down on the coastline at the warf where the boat was he took a knife and he cut the heart out of Livingston and he took it in his hand and buried it under a tree he said you can take his body back to London but he said his heart belongs in after wow let me ask you a question do you do you think Livingston had the real thing yes sir do you believe he had the real thing yes my goodness I believe this saints of God I believe this like Livingston said if you have men who will only come if they know there's a good road I don't want to that's right I want men who will come if there's no Road at all I don't want believers who will come if there's only a good road I don't want them I don't tell you what in the same way I don't believe that God wants Believers today that are only here if they have a good camp and they have lots of good food and they have uh foosball or whatever it is swoosh ball or something kind of ball uh in the afternoon nothing against it here but that's not the reason we ought to be here you know what those are secondary things the most important thing that you need to experience here is not a game a pool I believe it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself and that's our living Don't Clap hold on Don't Clap I don't have time people people speak to me Livingston said sorry people speak to me of the sacrifice that I made and they talk about I have made in the sacrifice I've made in spending my my life in Africa he said can that be called a sacrifice which is simply paid back as a small part of a great debt owing to God which we can never repap is that a sacrifice which brings its own blessed reward uh in in doing good and peace of mind and a bright hope of a glorious Destiny afterwards away with the world and such a view and with such a thought it is emphatically No sacrifice for me at all glory to God Amen everybody all right only got a couple of minutes left so Paul writes this word and he says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I I live not yet not I he says but the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me that's right that's real life that's what the word actually means there it means to be blessed and endless in the kingdom of God you not only have uh life in this life but you have life in the world to come you believe that so let me tell you something there are characteristics of that life and I you know I I'm a I've studied the Bible for 40 years and I've been preaching it for almost the same and I I there's some passages I think I'm familiar with and there's some I ain't and one of them is the Book of Job and I'll be honest to tell you that but I found something in the first chapter of the book of jel and I studied a Hebrew and what God actually said in in in his uh dealings with the prophets but I I found this passage here and it intrigued me because the Bible said that job offered sacrifices for your children and they never sinned now that always struck me because I thought as a father do I need to be offering sacrifices for my son they're all Rascals I no I mean they're all good boys but do I do I need to offer sacrifices for my sons even though they're all in the message and they're all uh they're all uh you know in Christ and I I I wondered about that pondered about this for years and and job had seven sons and three daughters and this was kind of a regular occurrence for them to get together and have feasts and so forth and he they uh they they did this uh you know with with regularity and it was so in the days of feasting were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offering for he said it may be that it may be I don't know that they have but it may be that my sons and daughters have sinned in their heart thus did God continue now that's interesting and why do you bring it up good question because job was offering sacrifices to counter the spirit of entitlement in the language this is what it says let me Define what entitlement is you remember when non went to elishah to get healed remember that and he sends word in hey non's here the enemy of God's people but I'm here anyway and uh you know I got leprosy I'm not going to live unless this great prophet does something and the prophet sends out his servant and nonon says hey yeah right a servant no way who does he think I am I'm entitled at least to a visit by the prophet himself I'm out of here and he turns and walks away some sensible servant came to him and said hey you know what why do you got to lose I mean why do you got to lose you're going to die right and nonon says well I guess so but I thought I was entitled more than that that's the spirit of entitlement so now watch job is offering sacrifices for his kids you know why because they're job's kids and they feel like huh you know our our dad our dad's a prophet and you know we've been in a camp I'm friends with Andrew GL bless go and I I you know I I I I got all the I got all the t-shirts from all the camps and I uh you know my dad's a deacon in the church and as a result of that you can begin I'm not saying you now I'm not saying you at all but you may know somebody who needs to hear this all right there comes a feeling that oh well you know maybe I can bend the rules just a little bit after all after all I'm Josh and I you know everybody knows my name when I say when I say I'm a benett they say oh wow you're Josh Bennett and you know what job did job knew that that kind of an attitude of entitlement can cause his children to go astray while they're right in the message and he's offering sacrifices just in case just in case I'm saying to you this morning if you have the real thing this is one thing you need to be guarded about that you don't get an attitude of entitlement and say well hey you know what I've got um I've got seniority around here I've I've been to three camps I'm 16 years old you know I got seniority around because when you get to feel entitled you get to feel well you know uh I can I can do something and fire lightning hasn't fallen out of the sky so I'm okay brother man gives a really interesting example he's in a psychiatric hospital and he's talking to a young lady who's there and the psychiatrist came in and set down and talked to this girl and he said to her you mean youve never been kissed by a boy and she said not one time you mean you've never had a little drink and been to a party this is the doctor talking to her now he's trying to figure out what's wrong with her he's looking at it from a natural point of view and she said never said girl you don't know what you're missing you're missing out you're not you're not living life you're missing out on everything now him being the psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind until she has become so evil and so bad till she didn't even want to hear the name of Jesus spoke in her presence good you know what he did purposely influenced her mind and it's because that she turned her thoughts from Christ onto where that psychiatrist was moving her mind now watch what he says and that's what we're here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world unto the things of God which are Eternal hey wake up there's somebody moving your mind one way or the other one way or the other you want to make sure the right side is moving your mind you want to make sure you're hearing the right thing you want to make sure that you've not been to enough camps that you become numb to the things that are said but if it's the word of God you ought to say Amen to it because you can begin to feel like oh well you know what I've been around and I've heard it all before and I'm good I'm the curve I'm good God doesn't grade by the curve God grades you grades you as an individual God looks at you as an individual and he does not he does not grade you on the curve again here's Ruth and Naomi brother said a type again in the Gentile bride how many people here are members of the Gentile bride half of you are all right this is for you and and they said well I'll I'll forsake everything and I'm going with you let your people be my people and so forth he said that's it that's what God wants it's not a halfway but an absolute full surrender to the kingdom of God that's exactly what God wants that's right can I go a little further yeah all right brother brandom says I love this he said Abraham threw Isaac's head back and took his hair aside and he said he took the knife and raised it in his heart choking back tears as if to say forever farewell Isaac my boy you got a hand it to Isaac right I mean you got a hand it to him raise his hand in full obedience and even watch even if you're doing something wrong and walking in obedience the Holy Ghost is there to stop you if you got the real thing the Holy Ghost is there to stop you don't worry he said if it's the Holy Ghost he will know when to stop you and when to start you that's right he's got the button in his hand Hallelujah somebody's got a button that helps me to refrain from doing the stupid somebody's got a button that that helps me to to be checked when I'm doing something wrong thank God for the button and thank God it's not in my hand but it's in his hand thank God for that kind of an experience that makes God so personally interested in you and he's going to actually turn you around when you need to be turned around yes sir glory to God everybody all right all right so therefore we need we need to make sure that we watch and we be sober that word sober is a great thing that word sober is a tremendous thing and we need to make sure that we are sober because there's going to be times when you're called upon to act in a certain way and you're not going to have a whole lot of prayer time to consider it there's going to be things that you're confronting with that you're going to have to act fast and you don't want to have to go somewhere to get prayed up you ought to live in the spirit and walk in the spirit tomorrow we'll take a little bit of time to put some flesh on that as to what it actually looks like in dayto day but you're not going to have time in certain instances uh to make a whole lot of decision or to uh you know to change a lot that's around you so let me close with this story Matt you be ready let me close with this story some of you I know have heard it before back in World War II Hitler began to have air superiority he began to win this struggle in World War II by bombing the guts out of London everybody was afraid Churchill knew the only way I'm going to win this struggle is to develop my own Air Force right that was the story in World War I they knew that whoever had air superiority they were the ones that were going to win this battle and Churchill knew that so they developed planes one of the planes that developed quickly was called a Spitfire Spitfire was fast light but it could carry a fairly good payload so they can get in quick drop a bomb on a factory in Germany fly back and make it so they developed the Spitfire it was a powerful weapon in the hands of the British uh VF and one day a test pilot was up test flying the Spitfire and back in those days when they built the Prototype there was nothing in it except wires and cables and levers and a seat that's all there was there was no uh nothing finished inside it was all open and the p testified were're crazy and they still are they testified brought it up brought it down landed okay they said adjust this and that bring it up again bring it down bring it up bring it down bring it up bring it down and they test flew these uh prototype planes many times in order to uh see how it was acting and what adjustments they needed to make all right so one day this test pilot is up there he's up pretty high and he's looking around and everything's going okay and he's just kind of doing this number he's cruising and he looks around and he sees a rat you thought I was going to say an eagle right cuz we the message no but he didn't he saw a wrap he looked back and he saw this rrap back there chewing on a hydraulic cable the hydraulic cable control the pitch and yaw the plane so therefore the pilot could go this way and this way but he couldn't go this way and this way that's bad news for a pile and he knew that he knew that if that rra was successful and chewed through the rubber all that hydraulic fluid would leak out and he would have to crash slam the plane now he's only he's only by himself he doesn't have anybody to uh you know say hey go down and get that rat and he doesn't have time to go down and get the rat himself because he doesn't have autopilot and number two if if he goes and gets the rat what if the rat runs away now he's chasing this rat around I mean you can imagine how silly that would look right so he's looking at this rap and he realizes whoa that's when you say wo everybody say wo I mean that's wo what in the world I do now and he's got this graap back there and he's just gnawing away in the Rubber and uh going to town and so he makes a decision really fast you know what he does he reaches over and takes his oxygen mask and puts it on and he takes the plane and he points it almost vertically and he goes straight up and as he goes straight up the oxygen thins in the plane and that rat back there he's watch he's got his eye on the rat he's watching that rat and that rat just kind of goes Falls over I do that for you but it take too long to get out and the rat Falls over dead because he's deprived of oxygen and the pilot takes the plane after he flies at that altitude for a while he takes that plane and he comes down and the levels off and the raft doesn't move and he knows he's defeated his enemy let me leave you with this simple thought and that is this when you get into a place where the pressure is on when you get into a place where all of a sudden Satan's hand is heavy or you got doubts go higher don't go lower go higher go into his presence go closer to his presence don't go low every one of you will have rats that show up unexpectedly and I'm telling you this don't go lower go higher when you get into a spot like that go higher because that's the safest place you can go Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the real thing you would not have sent us some faith impersonation in this last day but Lord you've given us the real thing father may we have a heart like David Livingston that said I'll go anywhere as long as you go with me Lord may we all sever the ties that keep us Lord from representing the kingdom of God lord May everyone here leave with a real thing I commit the people and this day in your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
