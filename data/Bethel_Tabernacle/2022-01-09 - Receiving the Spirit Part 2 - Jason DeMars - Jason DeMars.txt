========================================

confused especially in adoption stature of a perfect man so just understand those things in the realm of progressive revelation that brother branham received in his life so in the book of acts they give us steps of salvation that's what i would call it steps of salvation acts 16 38 i'm just going to read quick if you want to just take out take the scripture down from the screen i'm just going to read quick because the time is escaping me acts 16 31 and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house the first step of salvation is believing that's the first step you could never repent if you didn't believe you wouldn't see the need to it because you'd say i don't believe that why do i need to repent you can't repent first and then believe first thing you do is you hear the word and you receive it by faith and then of course acts 2 38 they rece they heard the word they believed it they said what do we do peter and he says repent that's the next step so you believe then you repent means turn away you're walking in one direction turn away from that direction that you're walking and turn this direction it speaks of a change of mind turn away from that and then what should we do next be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins so that so believe repent be baptized in water and then what's the last part and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost receiving the holy ghost these are the steps of salvation so it's one act many different descriptions it's it's spoken of as a baptism so an immersion spoke of being born again receiving the gift of the holy spirit receiving the holy spirit regeneration a seal an earnest a new creation adoption and begotten again it's one act many different descriptions the evidence of the holy ghost john 16 13 and 14 is what brother branham points to how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you so this was the verse that brother branham pointed to as the evidence of the holy ghost and if you remember the last time i spoke on this the term term evidence or initial evidence of the holy ghost is never found in scripture it's never found in scripture it's about what the holy ghost does in you and i think if you look at that look what brother branham is telling us it's about what the holy ghost does in us if you misunderstand that the evidence of the holy ghost is receiving the message of the hour you throw us back into the baptist doctrine that just believing is the evidence of the holy ghost then what in the world was brother talking about over and over again where he says first you have faith and then later on you go and receive the holy ghost have you received the holy ghost since you believed so they believed but they hadn't received the holy ghost yet and so you come up with a conundrum it's like a self-contradiction if you try to say that believing the message is with no explanation believing the message is received is the evidence of the holy ghost that's true but you're missing the scripture that the prophet brought and you're putting something back onto it that is not exactly what he's saying what is it what am i saying read the scripture again when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth so the spirit already came right when the spirit of truth comes into your life he's going to guide you into all truth it's not that you're led into all truth and then you and then you receive the holy ghost it's the holy spirit will guide you into truth that's a process right that's a continual process you can't say i've been led to the truth that's it that's the end of it you mean you the moment that you were born again you knew everything about the message you knew every doctrine you knew every detail about the message that's not what brother branham's saying you know in the token message he clearly he clearly states i mentioned this before and i'm going to mention it again you say i believe the message that's great that just means you can read that just means you can read and and you've received something logically you must have the token okay so why why would he say that if the evidence of the holy ghost is believing the message you see what i'm saying it seems like a self-contradiction but it isn't it's the perspective that we're looking at it from what does he mean when he says receiving the message of the hour is the evidence of the holy ghost he's what is he saying is that an evidence of the holy the the holy spirit in your life guides you into all truth that is the ultimate when you have the holy spirit what does it produce it produces the fruit of the spirit it produces the love of god produces a new creation all those things are part of what it does but the ultimate thing that we need to be walking in and living in is truth if we're walking in false doctrine and error that's an evidence we don't have the holy ghost right and that's that is going to produce false living and false life true revelation of the true word with the spirit of god in your life it will guide you continually into all truth and it will produce love fruit gifts etc but those are all those other things are all secondary to the truth the truth the word is what should bring for a believer emotion gifts love fruit of the spirit all those other things it's out of the word what's the truth the word so when you have the holy ghost it's going to guide you into the truth if you're a person that's sitting in a domination and you've genuinely received the holy ghost god's going to lead you out of that thing and into the full truth of the word of god for this day and let's further that along is a person can be sitting in a in a message church and looking 100 percent past tense at what god has done back in the 60s 50s and 60s that's wonderful but that's a long time ago god is doing something today the prophet told us what god would be doing in his people today and yet people say i don't need that i don't want that i don't want any part of that i just want the tapes i just want the messenger i don't need any of that other stuff it's a great it's a grave danger we have to be led into all truth another another point to be made is look at the understanding that people around the message sister gene can testify of this at this people that the understanding people had of the message in 1961 compare that sister gene to 1966 to today the things that you that the lord has shown you today compared to 66 you had no clue of them in 1966 what is it the holy spirit is guiding you into all truth we're not we're not feeding on a different message we're feeding on the exact same message that sister gene was feeding on in 1966 but what is it it's the spirit of god guiding you into all truth it's not enough it's not enough to say i believe the message it's not enough to say i believe in jesus those disciples back then in in acts 19 they believed in jesus but they hadn't forwarded themselves into what god was doing today and paul showed them the steps of salvation you had the steps of salvation under that old thing under under john's john's connection between the old old testament and the new testament now there's something new now there's something different if they would have said no thank you what does that show they never had anything in the first place they're just following a religion the spirit of god guides us into all truth and i know under that circumstances they hadn't even received or known about the spirit of god yet the point simply being for all of us we have to be led into all truth that is the evidence of the holy ghost and that isn't just believing in the message that is walking continually in the message initial when we talk about initial evidence of the holy ghost again receiving receipt it's not about the initial it's about the continual the word guide speaks of that he will guide you into all truth a guide isn't a one and done i received the holy ghost i have the initial i believe the message i have the initial evidence that's that's all i need it's a guide it's he'll the holy spirit in your life will continually guide you and that's the chiefest of the the evidences of the holy spirit the outward working of the spirit is that god is leading you in the truth because if he's leading you in the truth with the pure heart purified heart by the by the word and by the spirit all the other attributes of the what the spirit does the gifts the fruit the love that will follow but if you're walking in false understanding human understanding none of that will follow you're just following a religion on the outward side so all right we'll finish there if you want to stand we'll pray heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we're so thankful for your word lord i pray you'd quicken it to our hearts pray that you would be that guide to us to lead us into all truth lord grant us more and and deeper revelation of your word lord that that our lives would be continuously changed and transformed by the renewing of our minds father bless the service the worship today may your name be lifted up and glorified we ask in jesus name amen amen we'll take a short break and the song leader and musicians will be out in about five minutes god bless you you
