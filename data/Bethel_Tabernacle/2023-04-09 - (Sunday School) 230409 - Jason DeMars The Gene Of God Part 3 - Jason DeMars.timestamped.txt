[0:00] Good morning everyone.
[0:01] Good morning.
[0:02] Happy Easter.
[0:03] Looks like everybody's still uh getting
[0:05] their Easter finest on this morning.
[0:08] Just taking a little extra time. So,
[0:11] [laughter]
[0:11] the few that are here, God bless you.
[0:14] Amen. Let's stand. Let's pray.
[0:18] Father, we thank you so much for your
[0:19] goodness and your mercy. Lord, we thank
[0:21] you that your your word is alive and
[0:24] that it's real, Lord. It's not it's not
[0:27] just a myth or some history, Lord, but
[0:29] it's a living word that brings to pass
[0:32] whatever promise, Lord, that faith
[0:34] connects to, Lord. And so, we want to
[0:36] just come with faith, believing your
[0:38] word, receiving your word, Lord. Make it
[0:40] plain. Make it clear to us, Lord. Open
[0:43] it to our hearts. We ask in Jesus name.
[0:45] Amen. All right, you could be seated.
[0:50] So, I'm going to pull up that PowerPoint
[0:52] again. Thank you. Continuing on the gene
[0:54] of God part three and looking at the
[0:58] nature of man's life and its source as
[1:01] well as immortality and the inject
[1:03] injection of death and destruction. And
[1:06] we want to then relate it back to
[1:08] election and the genetics of the human
[1:10] race from the garden of Eden all the way
[1:13] to the new heavens and the new earth. So
[1:17] in this one um part three I [snorts]
[1:21] don't know what it's doing. It's going
[1:22] backwards. There we go. We want to look
[1:25] more at the gene of God and just kind of
[1:27] plant this seed as we go forward. So, G,
[1:30] as you could see, the word gene is there
[1:33] in the word Genesis. Genesis is actually
[1:36] the Greek translation for the word
[1:39] beginning, which is in Hebrewit.
[1:42] In the beginning, God created the
[1:45] heavens and the earth. And so then we
[1:48] find in the New Testament this word
[1:51] begotten or born. And for for for Jesus
[1:55] Christ it's he's spoken of as the only
[1:58] begotten son of God. So the monogano is
[2:02] the word there. The unique or
[2:04] one-of-a-kind begotten son of God. So
[2:08] that word gene is right there as well.
[2:11] Again it speaks of beginning. same thing
[2:13] the beginning or or the start or to come
[2:16] into existence but it also looks at more
[2:20] than that the term gene when we look at
[2:23] the term gene we think we have to think
[2:24] of origin we can't just think of
[2:27] beginning we have to think of its origin
[2:30] so gene is a unit of heredity which is
[2:33] transferred from a parent to an
[2:35] offspring and is held to determine some
[2:38] characteristic of the offspring and so
[2:42] you know we talk about these these
[2:43] different terminologies the the gene of
[2:45] God and you know I'm not calling it
[2:48] genes of God of course in us is the
[2:51] genes of God we are the genes of God
[2:53] plural but what I'm really looking at is
[2:55] he is the or his origin and how that
[2:58] origin the gene of God then passes on to
[3:03] the predestinated seed through history
[3:06] and and you might look at me and think
[3:07] how does this all connect together
[3:10] that's that's going to be the point of
[3:11] this and future
[3:13] studies.
[3:18] So again, it speaks of origin, but not
[3:21] just of origin. It speaks of origin with
[3:23] its characteristics. The idea of nature,
[3:27] same idea behind the word attribute.
[3:29] Brother Baron says, "You're gene of God.
[3:30] You're an attribute of God." These words
[3:33] are closely connected together, just
[3:34] looking at a different aspect. I believe
[3:36] gene speaks of origin and attribute
[3:39] speaks of that characteristic that's in
[3:43] inserted into that gene that comes into
[3:46] us. We can we'll talk about how that
[3:48] comes into us as we go on. So our nature
[3:52] and our characteristics
[3:54] come from our origin and of course
[3:58] outside forces affect and impact that
[4:01] but ultimately
[4:03] we are limited by our nature and
[4:06] characteristics.
[4:12] 1 John 3
[4:15] 8-10.
[4:17] He that committh sin is of the devil,
[4:19] for the devil sins from the beginning.
[4:22] For this purpose the Son of God was
[4:23] manifested that he might destroy the
[4:25] works of the devil. Whosoever is born of
[4:28] God doth not commit sin, for his seed
[4:33] remainth in him, whose seed remains in
[4:35] him, and he cannot sin because he is
[4:38] born of God. In this the children of God
[4:40] are manifest, and the children of the
[4:42] devil. Whosoever doeth not righteousness
[4:44] is not of God, neither he that loveth
[4:47] not his brother.
[4:51] This is a this this is looking at it as
[4:54] the the results. This is these are the
[4:57] results of the word of God coming forth,
[4:59] right? We're born what are we born of?
[5:03] We're we're begotten again by the word
[5:06] of truth, by the by the gospel. We hear
[5:09] the word, we we receive it by faith. God
[5:12] opens our hearts and we're born again.
[5:15] Right? So, and then a life is produced.
[5:19] So, he that commit commits sin is of the
[5:21] devil. He that is born of God doesn't
[5:25] commit sin. And we spoke about this last
[5:28] time looking back at unbelief. The only
[5:30] sin that God cannot forgive is unbelief.
[5:35] There's many attributes of unbelief. You
[5:38] know, scripture talks about them. Um,
[5:41] homosexuality, fornication,
[5:44] uh, cursing, gossip,
[5:46] lying, stealing, etc. These are all
[5:50] that's not sin. They're sins,
[5:54] but they're attributes of sin.
[5:57] And so, uh, he that's born of God cannot
[6:00] disbelieve God's word. Right? Well,
[6:03] you're born in sin and shaped in
[6:05] iniquity. you're you're born in
[6:06] unbelief. But when when you're
[6:09] converted, right? When you when you're
[6:11] when you're your heart is transformed by
[6:14] the power of God, you cannot commit sin.
[6:17] Why can you not commit sin? Because his
[6:19] seed remains in him. That's that's the
[6:23] origin, right? Born of God, the seed of
[6:27] God that remains in him and he cannot
[6:30] sin. As we look at the bigger picture,
[6:33] we're we're not trying to trying to
[6:35] present the idea that when you're born,
[6:37] the seed comes into you,
[6:39] right?
[6:40] Because if if you look at the bigger
[6:41] picture, your your your human birth, the
[6:45] the seed is there
[6:47] by the from the genes of God, from the
[6:50] genetics of God. That's all that's
[6:52] already there. And as we look at that,
[6:54] we'll we'll bear that out in the
[6:56] scripture. But again, this is showing
[6:58] the life source and then the
[7:00] characteristics or the attributes or how
[7:03] the gene is manifested in the life. If
[7:07] you're born of God, you're going to
[7:10] you're not going to sin.
[7:13] If you're from the devil, you you sin
[7:16] from the beginning, from the from from
[7:18] the beginning to the end. The word is
[7:20] manifested. What do you do? You
[7:22] disbelieve that word because you're a
[7:24] sinner.
[7:26] But if you if your seed comes from God,
[7:31] then the word comes forward and you
[7:33] believe it.
[7:33] Amen.
[7:36] Ephesians 2 1 and two. And you hath he
[7:40] quickened, who were dead in trespasses
[7:42] and sins, where in time wherein in time
[7:45] past you walked according to the course
[7:48] of this world, according to the prince
[7:51] of the power of the air, the spirit that
[7:53] now works in the children of
[7:55] disobedience, among whom also we all had
[7:59] our conversation in times past in the
[8:01] lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[8:03] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[8:05] and were by nature children of wrath,
[8:07] even as others Now notice it doesn't say
[8:10] you were children of wrath, but it says
[8:13] the nature that you had inside of you
[8:16] was just like the children of wrath. It
[8:19] says among whom we had our conversation.
[8:22] We were right among them. We were right
[8:25] among them. But you were always
[8:27] predestinated seed.
[8:29] But you were right there among them. You
[8:31] had the same nature. You have the same
[8:33] life. We have two natures, right?
[8:36] There's two natures in in the soul.
[8:40] So where did I stop? But God who is rich
[8:42] in mercy for his great love wherewith he
[8:44] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[8:47] hath quickened us together with Christ.
[8:51] By grace are you saved. Amen. So there's
[8:54] that there there has to be a life there.
[8:57] Again we look through scripture
[8:59] redemption. We see redemption. We see
[9:02] reconciliation. We see restoration. All
[9:05] those words have a re in front of it. In
[9:08] other words, it's bringing us back to
[9:10] something that we lost. God is bringing
[9:13] us back to the original life that we
[9:16] were to be born with. Right? He's
[9:19] bringing us back to the original
[9:20] condition that we were meant to come
[9:22] through Adam and Eve.
[9:29] John 10 26-28.
[9:34] But you believe not because you're not
[9:36] of my sheep. As I said unto you, my
[9:39] sheep hear my voice and I know them and
[9:41] they follow me and I give unto them
[9:43] eternal life and they shall never perish
[9:44] perish. Neither shall any man pluck them
[9:47] out of my hand.
[9:51] So we see there's two types of people in
[9:53] the world,
[9:54] sheep and not sheep.
[9:57] And the they're they're identified by a
[10:00] characteristic.
[10:02] those who are not of Jesus sheep what
[10:06] they they don't believe right you see
[10:09] Jesus is going back to origin
[10:12] this is not this doesn't work well if
[10:14] you're if you believe in free will and
[10:17] free choice God made you to be something
[10:22] he predestinated you you to be something
[10:24] he either predestinated you to be a
[10:26] sheep who hear the word or not a sheep
[10:29] who won't believe the word my sheep hear
[10:32] my voice. If you're not a sheep, you
[10:35] won't hear and you won't believe, right?
[10:37] So, it's not as though, well, you were
[10:39] you were a you were a dog or or you were
[10:42] a, you know, a pig and he changed you
[10:47] from being a dog or a pig to a sheep.
[10:50] No, he says you you sheep, you're out
[10:53] there living in the in the in the hog
[10:55] pen contrary to what God created to you
[10:58] to be. You're rolling around in the
[11:00] filth of the hogpen. And all of a
[11:03] sudden, the shepherd comes and says,
[11:04] "You're what are you doing?
[11:07] You You're not You're not a filthy hog.
[11:10] You're a sheep. Get out here." Then he
[11:13] washes us off and cleans us and put it
[11:15] puts us in in to feed on his his grass.
[11:19] Amen. To hear his voice. And that's
[11:23] important to understand. If you're
[11:25] looking at this verse and you think,
[11:26] "Well, just by my human choice, I become
[11:29] a sheep." That's not what it is. You're
[11:31] a pre-existing sheep. You have a
[11:34] pre-existing condition. That's your
[11:36] sheep or not sheep. If you're not sheep,
[11:39] you'll hear the words of Jesus. What
[11:40] nonsense. What garbage. What a hater.
[11:43] But if you're sheep, you'll hear that
[11:44] word and say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank
[11:46] you for the correction. Thank you for
[11:48] the conviction." He says, "As many as I
[11:50] love, I rebuke and chasen." Right?
[11:53] So that rebuke, that chastening comes
[11:55] and we say, "Amen." And we fall at the
[11:57] altar and we say, "Lord, forgive me.
[12:00] Lord, cleanse me." And he does it. Amen.
[12:02] That's his love.
[12:04] John 11:52.
[12:07] And not for that, this is the this is
[12:08] the prophecy of Caiaphas. And not for
[12:11] that nation only, but that also he
[12:14] should gather together in one the
[12:17] children of God that were scattered
[12:19] abroad. So we see that there's children
[12:21] of God scattered through the whole
[12:23] earth. At this point in time, God is
[12:25] dealing with Israel, right? And he's
[12:28] saying there's children of God that are
[12:30] scattered all over the earth. And the
[12:33] word has to go out and go forward. And
[12:36] after his death, burial, resurrection,
[12:39] that word has to go through the apostles
[12:41] to to the nations so that he can gather
[12:44] his children together. See there, that's
[12:47] a pre-existing condition. children of
[12:50] God. They are children of God. Not
[12:53] they'll become children of God by the
[12:54] new birth. They are children of God and
[12:57] they're scattered out. And he says, I
[12:58] got to gather them not into one place
[13:01] but into Christ.
[13:06] Galatians 4 1-3. Now I say that the heir
[13:10] as long as he is a child differs nothing
[13:12] from a servant, though he be lord of
[13:14] all. Now I want to just plant this this
[13:16] this picture here is he's talking about
[13:19] adoption. And our word in English
[13:21] adoption means you take someone who is
[13:24] not your child and you make them legally
[13:26] your child. There's nothing in this
[13:29] picture that speaks of such an idea.
[13:32] This is not saying well I went out and
[13:34] found an orphan and made him my son. Is
[13:37] that what it's is that what this verse
[13:38] is telling us about? Absolutely not.
[13:42] It's talking about the placing. And it's
[13:43] it's talking about entering into the
[13:46] place where you're fully a son and
[13:49] operating in the authority that God
[13:52] wants you to be in. Now I say that the
[13:55] heir. So first of all he's the heir.
[13:58] He's the inheritor. His father owns the
[14:00] estate. He he's going to take ownership
[14:04] of that when his fathers dies. But he's
[14:06] in training. See, as long as he is a
[14:09] child, he differs nothing from a
[14:10] servant, though he be lord of all, but
[14:13] is under tutors and governors until the
[14:16] time appointed of the father.
[14:21] Even so, we when we were children were
[14:25] in bondage under the elements of the
[14:27] world. So, here's a here's the picture.
[14:29] The picture is our life before Christ.
[14:34] God has a purpose in it.
[14:37] Even though we're in bondage under the
[14:39] elements of the world. In other words,
[14:40] the nature the na the the ele what's the
[14:43] elements of the world.
[14:45] It's Satan the prince of the power of
[14:48] the air. You walked after the nature of
[14:51] the s the people that are the children
[14:53] of the devil. You had the same nature
[14:55] dwelling in you. You weren't the
[14:57] children of the devil. You're the you're
[14:58] you're you're the son of the father.
[15:02] But you by nature you were under bondage
[15:04] to the elements of the world.
[15:07] I guess that was our tutor.
[15:09] That was our governor to lead us to
[15:11] Christ.
[15:13] But when the fullness of the time was
[15:15] come, God sent forth his son made of a
[15:17] woman, made under the law to redeem them
[15:19] that were under the law, that we might
[15:22] receive the the adoption hotheis, the
[15:25] placing of sons.
[15:28] And because look at that verse six,
[15:31] because you became sons.
[15:34] No, because you are sons. God has sent
[15:39] forth the spirit of his son into your
[15:41] heart crying, "Aba, father." It it
[15:44] doesn't say you become sons. He says
[15:47] because you are one that has come out
[15:51] from God. Because your origin is God.
[15:55] You are you can receive the baptism of
[15:58] the Holy Ghost. That's the adoption.
[16:02] That's the placing of sons. That's
[16:04] entering in. So when you get the baptism
[16:06] of the Holy Ghost, your name on the
[16:07] check is just as good. Why? You can, as
[16:10] brother Brad preached, you can speak
[16:11] that word soon as you receive the B.
[16:14] Now, we we might do it. We might need to
[16:16] grow in maturity a lot
[16:18] when we're first born again, but
[16:20] nevertheless,
[16:21] when God speaks to you and you speak,
[16:24] it's just it's just the same as God
[16:25] speaking.
[16:31] So now let's look at the other the other
[16:34] side of the coin, the other the other
[16:36] place.
[16:38] Genesis 3:14 and 15. Now, something
[16:42] different got injected into this, we'll
[16:46] say this God race.
[16:49] God God made Adam and Eve and what did
[16:52] he do? He placed his life into them. But
[16:55] then this foreign thing got injected.
[16:59] We're going to go into the all of these
[17:00] things in the scriptures, but I wanted
[17:02] to leave this here so you could see th
[17:05] this injection of a hybrid life.
[17:08] Genesis 3:14-15. And the Lord God said
[17:11] unto the serpent, "Because thou hast
[17:12] done this, thou art cursed above all
[17:14] cattle, and above every beast of the
[17:16] field, upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
[17:19] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[17:22] life. And I will put enmity between thee
[17:24] and the woman, and between thy seed and
[17:27] her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and
[17:30] thou shalt bruise his heel." All right.
[17:34] So from this verse, we can understand
[17:36] many things. First of all, the serpent
[17:39] is uh walks on two feet, right? His
[17:44] curse puts him on his belly. He wasn't
[17:45] originally on his belly. He was up on
[17:48] two feet.
[17:50] And we learn in Genesis 3 that he could
[17:53] speak and he could reason. He spoke to
[17:56] the woman and he reasoned with her. We
[17:58] also learn from her reaction to this
[18:00] happening that it was the norm.
[18:03] The serpent wasn't miraculously endowed
[18:06] with the capability to speak by the
[18:08] devil. No, he was able to speak. He was
[18:13] able to reason. He was just like man,
[18:16] but he wasn't made in the image and
[18:17] likeness of God. He didn't have a soul.
[18:21] He certainly had a spirit. He had
[18:23] intelligence.
[18:26] And he had the capability to to reason.
[18:29] And then we see here he says,"I'll put
[18:32] enmity
[18:33] between thee and the woman." Why?
[18:36] Because there was not enmity before. So
[18:38] there's now now he puts uh a repulsion.
[18:42] Something that the woman and and the
[18:44] serpent say we don't want anything to do
[18:46] with each other. And between thy seed
[18:49] and her seed. So seed simply means
[18:52] offspring.
[18:54] So between this so the serpent has
[18:57] offspring
[18:59] and the woman has offspring.
[19:02] We understand that
[19:05] this is a prophecy of the Messiah.
[19:08] The seed of the woman
[19:10] Jesus Christ the seed of the serpent
[19:13] serpent is Oops.
[19:17] That's where we have to come in and say
[19:19] who is that? Who is the seed of the
[19:21] serpent? [snorts] Where does that come
[19:24] from? Uh, this isn't meant to be going
[19:27] into serpent seed, although I feel like
[19:29] I want to, but I don't have those notes
[19:31] here with me, and I it's it's a lot of
[19:33] scripture. But but as you understand,
[19:38] there was a sexual act between Adam and
[19:41] Eve. Yes, but Eve and the serpent. And
[19:45] this produced twins.
[19:48] And we see this it's very well-known
[19:49] fact that you can have two uh two
[19:53] fathers and two different genetic sons
[19:57] through one uh woman if if they sleep
[20:00] together within the same period of time.
[20:03] It's called hetereroaternal
[20:04] superfeandation. Say that really fast
[20:06] over and over again. [snorts]
[20:10] It's a it's a scientific fact that it c
[20:12] can happen. And this is what happened.
[20:14] Cain and Abel were twins. And what
[20:16] happened right away? We could see the
[20:18] difference between the offspring.
[20:21] Immediately there's enmity. I mean, it
[20:23] doesn't take it doesn't take a
[20:25] scriptural genius to to put this
[20:27] together. He says there's going to be
[20:29] enmity between two seedlines. Then we
[20:31] fast forward to the next chapter and
[20:33] one's killing the other.
[20:35] Is it hard to is it hard to grasp that
[20:37] there's something strange going on here?
[20:41] There's the serpent seed line was from
[20:43] Cain.
[20:46] seed of the woman was through Abel and
[20:48] then Seth. But ultimately, this is a
[20:51] prophecy. This is a prophecy of Jesus
[20:55] Christ destroying the works of the
[20:57] devil, crushing his head.
[21:02] 2 Corinthians 11 2-4, I think, is one of
[21:06] the clearest scriptures. It's impossible
[21:09] to go away from reading this verse and
[21:13] bringing it back to Genesis and say,
[21:16] "Oh,
[21:18] well, she just ate an apple."
[21:21] What? Let's read it. For I am jealous
[21:23] over you with godly jealousy,
[21:26] for I have espoused you to one husband
[21:27] that I may present you as a chasteed
[21:29] virgin to Christ. So, right away, we see
[21:31] apousal and virginity is the picture.
[21:34] Now, don't run to apples.
[21:37] Don't run to eating fruit.
[21:40] The picture is virginity and espousal.
[21:43] All right. But I fear lest by any means
[21:46] as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[21:48] subtility. So your mind should be
[21:51] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[21:53] Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth
[21:55] another Jesus whom you have not
[21:57] preached, or if you receive another
[21:58] spirit which you have not received, or
[21:59] another gospel which you have not
[22:01] accepted, you might be bear with him. So
[22:03] there we have it. Let's let's go from
[22:05] the beginning to the end. He says, "I'm
[22:08] a I've I've aspoused you. You're engaged
[22:10] to Christ. You're a virgin." Not we're
[22:14] not a virgin by our own works. We're a
[22:16] virgin by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[22:19] He's cleansed us. He's transformed us.
[22:23] Now, we're a virgin and we're espoused
[22:25] to Christ.
[22:27] Then we skip forward and he says, "But
[22:29] I'm afraid that you're going to receive
[22:30] another gospel, another Jesus, another
[22:32] spirit." And what is he saying? I'm
[22:34] afraid you're going to commit adultery
[22:36] with false teaching false doctrine
[22:41] that you're going to bear with someone
[22:43] that's encouraging you to teach false
[22:46] doctrine. So then he we we go to the in
[22:49] between there is that he brings up
[22:51] serpent and Eve. Now, what in the world,
[22:54] if she ate a fruit, what in the world
[22:56] does the serpent and Eve and espousal
[22:58] and virginity have to do with eating an
[23:02] apple? Nothing.
[23:05] Nothing.
[23:07] Let's walk through this again. The
[23:09] church is engaged as a virgin to Christ.
[23:11] Eve was engaged as a virgin to Adam.
[23:14] Paul fears the church's adultery by
[23:16] accepting false word. He compares that
[23:19] then to the original sin. If Paul fears
[23:22] the church committing adultery and
[23:24] compares it to Eve's sin, then we can
[23:26] conclude by the scripture that
[23:30] if I can bring it up, Eve committed
[23:32] adultery with the serpent. This is plain
[23:36] scriptural exposition. I didn't have I
[23:39] didn't have to come up with a fancy
[23:41] dancing around the Bible to come up with
[23:44] this point. You got to dance around the
[23:45] Bible really fancy in order to arrive
[23:48] that an they ate an apple.
[23:52] We never even read the scripture of what
[23:55] Eve's curse was. He gave her a
[23:57] toothache, right?
[24:01] No. They ate an apple, then they
[24:02] realized they're naked. So, we should
[24:05] pass the apples again as the prophet
[24:07] said and maybe double them up since
[24:09] 1960s when he said it.
[24:12] Everybody needs at least 10 apples.
[24:17] No, it wasn't an apple. It was sex. It
[24:20] was adultery. It was And what what was
[24:23] the problem? It was injecting a a life
[24:25] that was not meant to be in this race of
[24:29] God's people in this genetic line of
[24:32] God. Now, a foreign life is inserted in
[24:35] there,
[24:37] right? Because e Eve Adam and Eve were
[24:40] both made in the image and likeness of
[24:41] God. Eve was taken out of Adam in the
[24:44] secondary creation so that she could be
[24:47] be deceived. The Bible says Adam was not
[24:49] deceived but the woman being deceived
[24:50] was in the transgression. She was able
[24:53] to be deceived. Then the the Cain's line
[24:57] comes in comes in is part from the image
[25:01] and likeness of God and part from the
[25:03] serpent. Right? So you have a hybrid and
[25:07] I'm getting way ahead of myself and I'll
[25:09] never be able to get there. Let me
[25:11] finish the thought that I started and
[25:12] left just left there. Eve said Eve's
[25:16] curse was what? What was her curse?
[25:20] I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy
[25:22] sorrow in thy conceptions. In pain
[25:26] you'll bring forth children. If they ate
[25:29] a a fruit of a literal tree. Go. Why is
[25:32] God talking about offspring? enmity
[25:35] between two people
[25:37] uh between the serpent and the woman and
[25:39] between genetic lines. And then he's
[25:42] talking about cursing re the
[25:44] reproductive process in a woman.
[25:47] It doesn't make sense. God's own
[25:49] principle, an eye for an eye and a tooth
[25:50] for a tooth. The the punishment should
[25:53] be commensurate with the crime. Well,
[25:55] that's what it was. It's exactly what it
[25:57] was.
[26:05] John 8:37,
[26:08] "I know that you're Abraham's seed, but
[26:10] you seek to kill me because my word has
[26:12] no place in you." I want to leave that
[26:15] there. They're Abraham's seed,
[26:19] right? They're they're physically from
[26:22] Abraham's line,
[26:25] but they but they're the word has no
[26:28] place in them. That's that is quite a
[26:30] statement. That is something that we
[26:32] should emphasize for a minute because
[26:34] you you can see now we're fast
[26:37] forwarding to the time where the seed of
[26:40] the woman, the prophesied ultimate
[26:42] prophesied seed of the woman is on the
[26:44] scene and we have people trying to kill
[26:47] him. So who is the seed of the serpent?
[26:51] Snakes.
[26:56] Maybe it's uh orangutang
[27:00] or maybe it's baboons.
[27:02] Gorillas who was trying to kill Jesus.
[27:05] It wasn't baboons, gorillas, or snakes,
[27:08] though he did call them vipers. A
[27:10] generation of vipers.
[27:12] Well, who was it? It was men
[27:15] and women that hated him, that didn't
[27:18] want to hear his word because why? There
[27:21] was no place for the word in them. their
[27:23] their their genetics were incompatible
[27:26] with the word of God.
[27:30] So we can we can flip this on the other
[27:33] way. How about Peter and James and John
[27:37] etc. there they heard the word they
[27:40] could receive it. They said that many
[27:42] many times they couldn't even understand
[27:43] what he's saying but they said you we
[27:46] know and are persuaded that you and you
[27:48] alone have the word of life. So why did
[27:50] they do that? because the word had a
[27:53] place in them. They were predestinated
[27:56] seed that had a place inside of their
[27:59] soul that was a receptacle of the word.
[28:01] It's just like a it's just like a cell
[28:04] phone or a laptop. You know, if if if I
[28:07] bring this up and start clicking, okay,
[28:09] I'm going to try to connect to Wi-Fi.
[28:12] I can't use my Bible to connect to Wi-Fi
[28:14] because there's no receiver for Wi-Fi in
[28:18] it. But if I go in here and connect to
[28:20] Wi-Fi, this this has a place to receive
[28:23] Wi-Fi. And that's the same principle.
[28:26] You have you have the Pharisees. There
[28:29] was no place
[28:31] there. [snorts] There was no receptacle
[28:32] for Wi-Fi in them when the Wi-Fi was
[28:35] going forward.
[28:37] They it just passed right through them.
[28:40] Passed right beyond them because it
[28:41] wasn't for them.
[28:44] But for the predestinated seed, those
[28:46] disciples, the word came forward and
[28:49] immediately said, "Ah, now I'm
[28:52] connected.
[28:55] Now I can receive information from the
[28:57] from my source." Amen. Well, I'm going
[29:01] to quit there. Let's stand.
[29:07] Gracious Father, we just come before
[29:08] you, Lord, and we're so thankful and so
[29:10] grateful for your word. I pray that
[29:12] you'd just continue, Lord, to bless us
[29:14] today. We thank you, Lord, for the
[29:17] resurrection of Jesus Christ. We thank
[29:19] you that because he lives, we live also,
[29:22] Lord.
[29:24] Lord, I pray that you'd bless this
[29:25] service, the the the the specials, the
[29:29] the uh worship that's about to
