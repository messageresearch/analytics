[5:14] morning everyone let's
[5:21] stand school speak on uh Israel God's
[5:25] time piece part
[5:27] five and
[5:30] start with our opening scripture in
[5:33] Hosea for the children of Israel shall
[5:36] abide many days without a king and
[5:38] without a prince and without a sacrifice
[5:40] and without an image and without without
[5:43] an ephod and without a teraphim
[5:45] afterward shall the children of Israel
[5:46] return and seek the Lord their God and
[5:49] David their King and shall fear the lord
[5:53] and his goodness in the latter days amen
[5:58] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[6:00] and we ask that your presence be with us
[6:02] we ask that you would speak to us and
[6:04] teach us out of your word Lord what uh
[6:07] what incredible hour we're living in to
[6:10] see the the closing scenes Lord of you
[6:14] dealing with the Gentiles and things
[6:17] closing up and such rampant apostasy
[6:22] from almost start to finish amongst the
[6:26] uh the major Orthodox and Protestant
[6:30] churches Lord and yet there's an
[6:32] overcomer in this age it's it's not it's
[6:37] not for us to despair but to Hope
[6:39] knowing that if you ordained an
[6:41] overcomer you ordained a means for us to
[6:44] enter into that overcoming power because
[6:47] it's salvation is not from us it's from
[6:49] you Lord and as we look this hour
[6:52] approaching we know that you're just
[6:54] about to turn and begin to deal with
[6:57] Israel again Lord You've brought them
[7:00] back uh as a
[7:02] nation uh given them their own Sovereign
[7:05] Nation and through troublous times Lord
[7:08] You've restored them and yet here they
[7:11] are still in unbelief and blindness
[7:14] father I pray that you'd open their eyes
[7:15] and open their understanding Lord to the
[7:18] revelation of who you are in in the in
[7:22] the Lord Jesus Christ we commit Our Time
[7:25] Lord to you and ask that You' take your
[7:27] word and write it on our hearts in Jesus
[7:29] name amen God bless you you can be
[7:33] seated so last time um I didn't want to
[7:37] go back over it because it would get me
[7:39] it would get me stuck but last time we
[7:42] were looking in Romans
[7:45] 11 and we went through I believe Romans
[7:48] 9 10 and 11 and it took us part 2 three
[7:52] and four to go through those and I just
[7:56] want to uh quickly at the beginning of
[7:59] this review the main points of what Paul
[8:02] wrote within that and then kind of move
[8:04] forward to look at Israel's restoration
[8:07] and sort of the conditions and what what
[8:09] the scripture says um will happen and
[8:13] which all portions have already happened
[8:16] but the fullness has not come to pass
[8:18] yet so looking at Romans 9:10 11 Paul is
[8:23] making these 10 points in order for God
[8:25] to bring Gentiles to Salvation he had to
[8:28] Blind the Jews amen
[8:30] two the Gentiles reive The Promise by
[8:33] faith wherein the Jews sought to receive
[8:36] them by works God has turned to the
[8:40] Gentiles to provoke the Jews to jealousy
[8:43] but an elected remnant of the Jews will
[8:45] be saved God has not five God has not
[8:48] Cast Away His People Israel six the
[8:51] elect in Israel received the promise but
[8:53] the rest were blinded by God Seven there
[8:56] is a casting away of Israel but there
[8:58] will also be a receiving of Israel eight
[9:01] the receiving of Israel will produce a
[9:04] resurrection nine blindness has happened
[9:06] to Israel until the fullness of the
[9:08] Gentiles become in 10 but when the final
[9:11] predestinated seed comes into the
[9:13] Gentiles then God turns to deal with
[9:16] Israel and brings them
[9:18] salvation amen and so as we move forward
[9:23] we
[9:24] understand that it's it's an
[9:27] impossibility to take these scriptures
[9:29] and do as many in the church history and
[9:32] even today post millennialist will say
[9:35] that the church replaces Israel it
[9:38] reduces the words of Paul to Goble and
[9:41] nonsense why is he if he's talking about
[9:44] Gentiles and Israel and re restoration
[9:47] and blindness but but Israel is simply
[9:50] replaced by the church uh it becomes
[9:53] nonsense amen you know it's it's taking
[9:57] what you do what you do is take one
[10:00] scripture and then you reinterpret the
[10:02] rest of the Bible and this is what we
[10:05] call misplacing misinterpreting doing
[10:08] all the things you're not supposed to do
[10:11] not all Israel is Israel that's true and
[10:14] it's not all Israel is the one that's
[10:16] circumcised in the flesh but circumcised
[10:19] in the spirit so Paul says we are the
[10:22] true Israel nevertheless he continues to
[10:25] speak of Israel as a nation continues to
[10:27] speak of them as blindness in in
[10:31] blindness what what Ephesians 2 and
[10:34] really I should cover that in this but
[10:36] Ephesians 2 shows us clearly that the
[10:40] covenants of Promise Gentiles were
[10:43] foreigners and strangers to them now
[10:45] we're brought near by the blood of
[10:47] Christ so now we have access to the same
[10:51] promises but again this doesn't
[10:54] invalidate God's promise to restore
[10:57] Israel
[10:59] because the purpose here he's saying is
[11:02] that Gentiles were grafted in because of
[11:05] their unbelief and the Jews will be
[11:06] grafted back in because of the Gentiles
[11:11] unbelief and so let's start to look we
[11:13] started in
[11:15] Hosea chapter 3 veres 4 and 5 we know
[11:19] Hosea was a great type of Jehovah god
[11:23] with his
[11:24] bride who was a prostitute who was
[11:28] forsaken
[11:29] uh who
[11:30] forsook Hosea ran away from him and The
[11:34] Story Goes and you're you know that that
[11:36] he continued to go after her and bring
[11:39] her his purpose was to bring her back
[11:42] and so that that whole picture is a type
[11:46] of Israel is they
[11:48] Unfaithful they rejected what God had
[11:51] done amongst them through the Lord Jesus
[11:53] Christ they played the The
[11:57] Prostitute but God's love never
[12:01] changes he went after them even in even
[12:04] in their prostitution and rejection of
[12:08] him and their blasphemy of the Lord
[12:11] Jesus Christ he went after them amen all
[12:15] right so here we
[12:16] see the Bible tells us that Israel will
[12:19] not have a king will not have a prince
[12:23] will go without
[12:26] sacrifice so without a king without a
[12:29] prince undoubtedly we understand that
[12:32] that happened when Babylon when they
[12:35] came and took them away
[12:38] right they were without a King Without a
[12:41] prince but the temple was
[12:43] rebuilt when when they were returned the
[12:46] temple was rebuilt but they never got
[12:48] back a king or a prince they were always
[12:51] a vassal Nation underneath the power of
[12:55] the
[12:56] Gentiles right but they had a sacrifice
[13:00] and so forth they had they had their
[13:02] their uh levitical priesthood and
[13:06] religion so this is not talking about
[13:09] that time but this is talking about a
[13:12] future time which we're still in the
[13:15] middle of right now they're without a
[13:17] king they have they have a president
[13:19] they have a government but they don't
[13:21] have the the the lineage of David
[13:24] restored to the throne yet and they're
[13:27] without sacrifice etc
[13:30] etc all right afterward shall the
[13:32] children of Israel return and seek the
[13:34] Lord their God and David their King and
[13:37] shall fear the lord and his goodness in
[13:39] the latter days well the Lord has
[13:41] brought them back it's the L it's the
[13:43] latter days he's brought them back to
[13:45] the nation to the to the area to the
[13:48] land and he's going to cause them to
[13:51] seek the Lord their God up to this point
[13:53] they've remained in what they're still
[13:55] in blindness let's not forget that we
[13:58] love Israel as a nation we love that
[14:01] they're God's chosen people but don't
[14:03] forget that they're in blindness and
[14:06] Disobedience they don't know who God
[14:09] is they have they have a
[14:11] Zeal for who they think is God but
[14:14] remember when they were when Jesus was
[14:16] on the earth he told them you don't you
[14:18] don't know me nor do you know my
[14:21] father so the what and he says this is
[14:23] the one you claim to
[14:25] worship so what what they claim and what
[14:29] they actually are possessors of it's two
[14:31] different things they're claiming to
[14:34] know God but they don't know him
[14:36] amen because they haven't seen who the
[14:38] Lord Jesus Christ is all right so but
[14:42] but they he's returned them but the
[14:44] second part they haven't done yet first
[14:47] they're going to have to what first he
[14:49] returns them but they're going to have
[14:50] to start seeking the Lord their God and
[14:52] David their King they haven't sought
[14:55] after David their
[14:57] King in fact if you look look if you
[14:59] look closely and examine closely you'll
[15:03] you'll see that there's a great fear
[15:05] amongst the politicians about rebuilding
[15:08] the temple they they don't want they
[15:09] don't the polit political class doesn't
[15:12] want to do that they they they they fear
[15:15] the ramifications of it all right let's
[15:20] keep
[15:23] going Luke 21 so they're without a king
[15:28] they're without their land and Luke 21
[15:31] starting at verse 20 Jesus prophesying
[15:34] and when you shall see Jerusalem compass
[15:37] with armies then know that the
[15:39] Desolation thereof is
[15:41] nigh this happened in the late 60s into
[15:45] 70 AD then let them which are in Judea
[15:48] flee to the mountains and let them which
[15:50] are in the midst of it depart out and
[15:52] let not them that are in the countries
[15:54] enter there
[15:56] into for these be the days of Vengeance
[15:58] that all things which are written may be
[16:00] fulfilled but woe unto them that are
[16:02] with child and to them that give suck in
[16:04] those days for there shall be great
[16:06] distress in the land and wrath upon this
[16:08] people and they shall fall by the edge
[16:11] of the sword and shall be led away
[16:12] captive into all nations and Jerusalem
[16:15] Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the
[16:18] Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
[16:22] be fulfilled amen so 70 AD they were LED
[16:25] away captive by the Roman army spread
[16:29] throughout the
[16:30] Nations and Jerusalem has been trotten
[16:33] down and in in the late
[16:38] 1960s Israel an Israeli Army marched in
[16:43] to what was Jordanian
[16:45] territory and took over Jerusalem so now
[16:49] it's under the government and and the
[16:52] authority of Israel and yet still they
[16:57] submit to the abomination of desolation
[17:01] the Dome of the Rock standing on the
[17:03] place of the of the Holy place so we
[17:06] know that this is a process just like
[17:09] the coming of the Lord second coming of
[17:11] the Lord is a process starting in spirit
[17:15] form with him descending from heaven
[17:18] with a message and coming in Bride form
[17:22] we know that this is also a process as
[17:24] well that the time of Jerusalem being
[17:27] trotten down of the
[17:31] even though Israel has ultimate
[17:33] Authority they haven't taken ultimate
[17:36] Authority the the Muslims still have uh
[17:41] have have a governing authority over the
[17:44] the mosque and the Dome of the
[17:48] Rock but once that once that happens
[17:50] once that is done the times of the
[17:52] Gentiles are over that will usher in the
[17:55] millennium
[17:59] so we're in the process of them being
[18:01] restored to have their King and have
[18:05] their nation and have their Temple so
[18:07] forth we read this I think in part one
[18:10] want to read it again Isaiah 11 11 and
[18:13] 12 and it shall come to pass in that day
[18:16] that the Lord shall set his hand again
[18:18] the second time to recover the remnant
[18:21] of his people which shall be left from
[18:23] Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathos
[18:25] and from Kush and from ilam and from
[18:28] shinar and from HTH and from the islands
[18:30] of the sea and he shall set up an end
[18:32] sign for the Nations and shall assemble
[18:35] the outcasts of Israel and gather
[18:37] together the dispersed of Judah from the
[18:40] four corners of the earth so again this
[18:43] is the second time he recovers them the
[18:45] first time he recovered them was when
[18:48] they went back to receive the coming of
[18:51] the Messiah so the second time where he
[18:54] comes sets his hand again to recover
[18:56] them that's what happened starting with
[18:59] well really it started happening in the
[19:01] early
[19:02] 1900s even in the late 1800s it be Jews
[19:06] began to move back to Israel and of
[19:09] course their their nationhood was
[19:11] believe
[19:12] 1948 that they were declared a
[19:16] nation Ezekiel 36 24 and 25 for I will
[19:22] take you from among the Heathen and
[19:25] gather you out of all countries and will
[19:27] bring you into your own land then will I
[19:31] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[19:33] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[19:35] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[19:37] you so uh again people will take this
[19:42] and say well this is Ezekiel Ezekiel is
[19:44] prophesying during the time of the cap
[19:45] Babylonian captivity this is just
[19:48] talking about when they came back from
[19:50] the B Babylonian captivity we'll go on
[19:53] to read to see the absurdity of this but
[19:55] I want to comment on it as you look you
[19:58] go and read and study Ezekiel
[20:02] 36-44 and you'll see the absurdity of of
[20:05] that number one is Ezekiel 38 and 39 is
[20:09] showing a an alliance between
[20:13] Russia
[20:14] turkey
[20:16] Iran
[20:18] Libya
[20:20] Somalia Etc these nations gathering
[20:23] together in an alliance to come and
[20:26] attack Israel
[20:28] when has that happened in history did
[20:30] that happen before they were returned or
[20:33] right after they were returned it's
[20:35] never happened in fact those countries
[20:37] have never had an alliance until the
[20:41] last few
[20:42] years now you see those countries
[20:45] aligning with one another so we know
[20:48] then that Ezekiel 36 is not speaking
[20:51] about returning from the Babylonian
[20:53] captivity this was a future from
[20:55] ezekiel's time a future returning from
[20:58] the Captivity
[20:59] it's talking about our day and our time
[21:02] right now so he takes them from from
[21:05] among the Heathen from all the
[21:08] countries so he brings them first back
[21:10] to their land then he says I'll sprinkle
[21:14] clean water upon you and you shall be
[21:17] clean from all your filthiness so when
[21:19] they were out of the land what were they
[21:22] they were in filthiness they were in
[21:25] idolatry is what it's saying you say
[21:28] they are in idolatry yep how can you say
[21:31] that they wor they say they worship
[21:33] Jehovah god well I'll just say it
[21:37] this postc Temple Judaism talmudic
[21:42] Judaism is no different than idolatry
[21:45] why because they refuse the manifested
[21:49] Messiah when you as soon as you refuse
[21:52] the manifested Messiah no matter what
[21:55] you claim to worship it's idolatry
[21:58] you're not worshiping the true and
[22:00] living God you're walking in evil and
[22:04] filthiness and that's the that's the
[22:06] reality we love the Jewish people we
[22:07] know that God has a promise for them but
[22:10] they are now living under idolatry
[22:13] that's the scripture
[22:16] amen and so what does this tell us this
[22:20] tells us that when Israel is is returned
[22:23] to the land they're not repenting before
[22:26] they get back to the land they are
[22:29] repenting after they get back to the
[22:30] land so first he restores them while in
[22:34] unbelief and idolatry and false
[22:38] Doctrine that's where they're still
[22:40] at Israel is still in that position of
[22:44] filthiness they need to be sprinkled and
[22:47] washed clean and restored from their
[22:50] idolatry further it goes Ezekiel
[22:53] 36:26 a new heart also will I give you
[22:55] and a new spirit will I put within you
[22:57] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[22:59] of your flesh and I will give you an
[23:01] heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit
[23:02] within you and cause you to walk in my
[23:05] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[23:07] and do them so again they're restored in
[23:11] a condition of unbelief back to the land
[23:14] now of course we you say man I thought
[23:16] that was a that scripture applies to us
[23:19] I want you to I want you to understand
[23:21] something it certainly does applied to
[23:23] us this scripture here brother Brandon
[23:26] preaches on it many
[23:29] uh many people have taught on it and
[23:30] shown how the new birth comes and
[23:34] sanctification
[23:36] justification but I want you to also
[23:39] understand within the context of
[23:40] scripture many times we'll see this also
[23:42] in Ezekiel that there's a there's a
[23:44] multiple two-fold application of
[23:47] scripture one if you take this
[23:50] absolutely literally in its its
[23:53] Condition it's it's speaking of Israel
[23:55] and God's plan for Israel but then it
[23:57] also has a a second application which is
[24:00] also to Believers as individuals you'll
[24:04] find that in Zechariah 14 where it says
[24:07] at the evening time very famous
[24:10] scripture as message Believers that we
[24:12] hear all the time about the evening time
[24:14] it shall be light this is right in the
[24:16] middle of a scripture that's speaking
[24:17] about the Trib Great Tribulation and
[24:20] God's purpose for
[24:22] Israel and you'll find that again and
[24:24] again Paul when when when speaking about
[24:28] about preaching of the Gospel throughout
[24:30] all the world he takes the scripture
[24:32] that says the heavens declare the glory
[24:35] of the Lord in the firmament his
[24:37] handiwork their line has gone into all
[24:40] the Earth and Paul applies that to
[24:42] himself and preachers of the Gospel I
[24:46] thought it was the heavens that declare
[24:47] the glory of God and the Paul says no
[24:50] it's we do we're the ones that are doing
[24:53] it well it's both true and that's what
[24:57] that that's what we find over and over
[24:59] again that scripture has multiple
[25:02] fulfillments and and multiple uh
[25:06] applications now it's not for us
[25:09] to come up with a thousand different
[25:12] ways to interpret the scripture that's a
[25:14] lot of crazy people have brought a lot
[25:18] of crazy false Doctrine by misapplying
[25:21] that when I say that the messenger of
[25:23] the age should be the one that shows us
[25:26] that Paul Tau taught us that brother
[25:29] brandham taught us that and showed us
[25:31] that that it has multiple fulfillments
[25:33] and he gives us the explanation if if if
[25:36] you take this idea and extrapolate it
[25:39] you'll wind up far in the ditch so I
[25:43] just want to say that uh before I go on
[25:46] from here so again Israel restored in
[25:50] unbelief filthiness idolatry back
[25:53] brought back to the land when they're
[25:55] brought back to the land if you remember
[25:57] brother bham says over over and over
[25:58] again a Jew can never be blessed until
[26:01] he's back in the land soon as he leaves
[26:03] the land he's leaving the place of
[26:05] Promise so God has to in unbelief
[26:08] restore them back to the land and bring
[26:11] forth his Pro promises to to bring them
[26:16] salvation verse 28 and you shall dwell
[26:19] in the land that I gave to your fathers
[26:20] and you shall be my people and I will be
[26:24] your
[26:26] God next chapter Ezekiel 37 the hand of
[26:29] the Lord was upon me and carried me out
[26:32] in the spirit of the Lord and set me
[26:34] down in the midst of the valley which
[26:37] was full of Bones and caused me to pass
[26:40] by them round about and behold there
[26:42] were very many in the open Valley and lo
[26:45] they were very dry I want you to see
[26:47] this verse is it speaking about a
[26:50] physical Resurrection in some ways it is
[26:52] but I I think you need to see it more as
[26:54] God's the condition of Israel God's
[26:58] purpose for Israel what is the condition
[27:00] of Israel dead
[27:03] bones Dry Bones of course again another
[27:07] thing multiple applications but that's
[27:10] the condition of Israel both spiritually
[27:12] and
[27:13] politically in in their as a as a nation
[27:17] as a people and in their relationship
[27:20] with God he brought them to that Valley
[27:23] which was full of Bones and caused me to
[27:24] pass by them round about behold there
[27:26] were many in very many in the open
[27:28] Valley and lo they were very
[27:33] dry and he said unto me son of man can
[27:36] these bone Li these bones live and I
[27:38] answered oh Lord God thou knowest again
[27:41] he said unto me prophesy unto these
[27:44] bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones
[27:46] hear ye the word of the Lord thus sayith
[27:49] the Lord God unto these bones behold I
[27:50] will cause breath to enter into you and
[27:53] you shall live and I will lay Senus upon
[27:55] you and will bring up flesh upon you and
[27:57] cover you a skin and put breath in you
[28:00] and you shall live and you shall know
[28:02] that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I
[28:05] was commanded and as I prophesied there
[28:07] was a noise and behold a shaking and
[28:10] Bones came together bone to his bone and
[28:12] when I beheld low the Senus of the flesh
[28:14] came up upon them and the skin covered
[28:16] them above but there was no breath in
[28:19] them then said he unto me prophesy un
[28:21] the wind prophesy son of man and say to
[28:24] the wind thus sayith the Lord God come
[28:26] from the Four Winds o breath and breathe
[28:28] upon these slain that they may live all
[28:32] right so we see we see there there's
[28:35] four winds and the Four Winds are going
[28:37] to breathe upon Israel that they might
[28:40] live again context is important Ezekiel
[28:44] 38 37 30 or 3 I can count I promise 36
[28:49] 37 38 39 all the way to the end to
[28:54] 44 this is speaking about the
[28:57] restoration of Israel and the purpose
[28:59] that God has for them so this is not
[29:03] changing the subject abruptly this is uh
[29:07] a a vivid illustration of what God is
[29:09] going to do this nation who is
[29:12] dead amongst amongst the world
[29:18] in and bring them Total Restoration not
[29:21] just physical but they'll be completely
[29:25] restored with the Breath of God blown
[29:28] upon them just as we saw in the previous
[29:31] chapter that he's going to give them
[29:33] them a new spirit a new heart and put
[29:37] his Spirit within them let's look at
[29:40] some other scriptures Isaiah
[29:44] 43:5 fear not for I am with thee I will
[29:46] bring thy seed from the East and gather
[29:49] thee from the West I will say to the
[29:51] north give up and to the South keep not
[29:53] back bring my sons from far and my
[29:56] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[29:59] amen so this is God saying I'm going to
[30:03] gather Israel back to the land that I
[30:07] have promised
[30:09] them Jeremiah 16:14 therefore behold the
[30:12] days come sayeth the Lord that it shall
[30:14] no more be said the Lord liveth that
[30:17] brought up the children of Israel out of
[30:19] the land of Egypt but the Lord liveth
[30:23] that brought up the children of Israel
[30:24] from the land of the north and from all
[30:26] the lands with he driven them and I will
[30:29] bring them again to their land that I
[30:31] gave unto their
[30:33] fathers behold I will send for many
[30:36] Fishers sayeth the Lord and they shall
[30:38] fish them and after will I send for many
[30:40] hunters and they shall hunt them from
[30:42] Every Mountain and from every Hill and
[30:45] out of the holes of the rock a great
[30:48] persecution began to take place in the
[30:52] late 1930s
[30:55] am and
[30:59] again what ended up happening was you
[31:04] had these
[31:06] uh important banking families I'm trying
[31:09] to speak about the conditions that led
[31:10] to this they had these important Jewish
[31:13] banking families that controlled the
[31:16] finances and if you remember after World
[31:18] War I America and and the Allies put a
[31:24] horrible uh sanction on the German
[31:27] Nation
[31:28] and this caused the collapse of
[31:30] everything and and the collapse of their
[31:33] society and so the German people looked
[31:36] and saw the
[31:38] bankers the banking families CU remember
[31:41] for much of the Middle Ages Jews
[31:43] couldn't couldn't learn the trades
[31:45] unless they converted to Catholicism so
[31:47] the only trade they could do was in
[31:49] jewels and
[31:51] finance and so they became because of
[31:54] that they weathered the storm of what
[31:57] happened and they were financially well
[31:59] to do while the German people perished
[32:01] so this led to the conspiracy that all
[32:04] Jews are evil and they must be
[32:06] exterminated from the face of the Earth
[32:08] so throughout Europe this took place and
[32:11] while this Spirit was released upon that
[32:14] Europe the European nations it was also
[32:17] released in the Middle East and what was
[32:20] it it was they were hunting and fishing
[32:22] thinking I'm killing Jews but it was God
[32:26] allowing them demons to do what they
[32:28] want to do and he was going to pull the
[32:30] last trick on them but out of this great
[32:34] evil he was going to bring his people
[32:38] back to the land and you see all the
[32:40] nations uh of those of the Middle East
[32:43] that we read about before that he was
[32:45] going to call them from those Nations
[32:48] and from the north east south west
[32:50] everywhere is that all these nations
[32:52] begin to vomit up the Jews to kill them
[32:56] but to give them no place to go
[32:58] at the end and to put within them that
[33:01] further desire see Zionism and the
[33:04] desire to go back to Israel there was an
[33:07] anointing that came when the leoan
[33:09] church age came suddenly the Jewish
[33:12] people wanted to go back and many even
[33:13] of those banking families were financing
[33:17] and funding one of the cities that I
[33:18] like to go to and stay in in Israel was
[33:21] is uh is was started by Jacob
[33:25] Rothchild and so these families were
[33:27] sending money they're
[33:30] atheists they they they've done so many
[33:32] atrocities these are horrible banking
[33:35] families that brought such a Scourge on
[33:37] the earth it controlled so many things
[33:39] but yet God used them in order to bring
[33:43] his purpose about to have his children
[33:47] his sons and daughters sent back to the
[33:50] land that he had promised them and so
[33:53] these hunters and Fishers came and did
[33:55] that and well we're not going to get to
[33:57] it this morning but you'll see that God
[34:01] says there's going to be a great purging
[34:03] of Israel there's a purging that
[34:06] happened to bring them back to the land
[34:07] but then there's a purging that further
[34:10] happens in the Great Tribulation period
[34:13] or the time of Jacob's trouble and we'll
[34:15] in in future uh Sunday schools will go
[34:19] more into detail about that and God's
[34:22] purpose and plan and how he works during
[34:25] that Great Tribulation period so let's
[34:27] let's let's stand and we'll
[34:30] pray Heavenly Father we just come to you
[34:33] Lord and we're so thankful for your
[34:34] goodness and mercy to us Lord we ask
[34:36] that your Holy Spirit would be with us
[34:39] Lord as we worship and as we go to the
[34:42] word today Lord may you be magnified and
[34:44] glorified in our midst Lord May the sick
[34:47] be healed may may Hearts be mended Lord
[34:51] and may Souls be saved and and
[34:54] transformed by the power of the word we
[34:56] ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[34:58] amen God bless you
[35:21] [Music]
[35:52] [Music]
[35:57] oh
