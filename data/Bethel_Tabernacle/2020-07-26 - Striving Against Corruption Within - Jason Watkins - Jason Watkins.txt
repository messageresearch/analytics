========================================
[Music] foreign amen so i saw it there by the kev so maybe just refresh the but i also sent an email okay good deal you've got it perfect amen good morning class god bless you we're going to take our bible reading this morning sorry for the delay we were the booth didn't have my presentation somehow but we've got it rolling now so we're just going to take our first reading from revelation chapter one verse one we've been working on this series today is going to be uh we're gonna start at frame eight matt uh frame number eight um today is going to be our fourth installment of the revelation of the bible says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass all right let's pray master we commit ourselves now into your hands father for the lesson today we know you're in it and so we pray that you'll guide it and open eyes of understanding in jesus name amen so i'll be using this mic brother kev the whole time all right so we've been working now on the revelation of jesus christ and i i've been emphasizing to you and want to emphasize again today that it will be necessary to really lay in the foundation work on this very first chapter in fact is this very first verse because that if you don't really have a very crystal clear understanding of who jesus christ was and the revelation that was given to him and how that's even possible that he didn't know a certain thing and then the father gave him the revelation and then how is that working he's a human but he's uh he's he's a man plus he's the god man and so how it all relates uh it will be imperative that we understand that and one of the main reasons for that is is that because the book of revelation is the contextual record of christ working in his church and therefore in order for the church to clearly understand who she is and her position in um in the unfolding of god because that's where she's revealed just like eve was in adam and she became an expression of adam the church was in christ at calvary and was released at calvary but not initialized until the holy spirit came back upon her so the entire book of revelation is christ keeping his word when he said to his followers a little while and the world won't see me but you'll see me for i'll be with you even in you we find pilate talking to him about a kingdom and jesus makes a statement that more or less is to say we derive from it let me let me be clear i'm not quoting it but we derived the understanding that his kingdom were they present at that time would fight for him so that he would not be given to the mob or the pilot but that his kingdom wasn't yet because the holy ghost hadn't been given once the holy ghost was given then the kingdom of god is within you according to the bible the kingdom of god is with you and in you and so the book of revelation then is is going to be uh it came to the church as a sealed up closed-up book that's why paul never references it or quotes from it because that it was brought after paul had left the scene so we find then that it would be a future prophecy of what the church would go through at that time they had no idea they were going to go 2000 years through seven continuous uh church ages and uh not only were the ages contiguous in that they bordered aged age but they actually lapped over and so we find that it came all the way down to the last day so this is why we keep saying that more perfectly the book of revelation is the bride's book of the last day it is what gives her context to who she is how she got here how christ pulled it off and all down through the ages because we we now see so many things that have come to pass all right so now let me move on we've talked about high-res and lo-res and and that's how the book of revelation apocalypse is an uncovering we've discussed in the in our second and third installment that the revelation came by manifestation that's really the the main point that the book of revelation has been interpreted by manifestation and when when the word interprets itself by coming to pass your arguments against it are pointless that it's not open for conjecture anymore that when someone is confronted with the word made flesh they they no longer can plead ignorance at their trial they cannot plead ignorance because they saw the word made flesh before them and so we realize that unless they come up under a special exception to the law which as as the true jews were because they would have seen jesus but god blinded them to accomplish a greater purpose of bringing in the gentiles so they'll get a pass for all of those who were truly remember not all israel's israel but those who truly observed according to the faith of abraham they were given white robes the book of revelation tells us what became of all of those true jews who rejected him and we realized that there were some of them who were elected to be part of the of the old testament bride and there was but other of them were remnant they were given uh white robes and he noticed that the book of revelation says not for the testimony of jesus christ but for their for the testimony they held which was the testimony of the law of moses and they were true and they were loyal and they were sincere with real faith they weren't pretend jews so we find out then that we came in our last lesson uh after we dealt with the manifestation or revelation by manifestation as a subtitle we did two parts of that we looked at how the revelation of this day had come to bring us back to the place in scripture that we can begin to understand what who and why and where and how we are to be so the purpose of the message was then to bring us back uh to that understanding the understanding that traditions had taken away now we made a point to you last time that that that when malachi 4 says that it would take us back to the faith of the fathers or take us back to what paul preached and we made the statement to you and this is where kind of where we ended the last time that that if that were not true that if there if there was no falling away and there was no restoration then then what's it all about of the tens of thousands of denominations and subsets of denominations that we have today so we realize that that brother branham is going to begin to show how that the age fell away all right now here we have our where we begin our slide i want you to take a look at brother branham teaching on the spoken word is original seed uh man i could load it but i'll just let you run it for me next slide brother branham picks up from spoken words original c and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is virgin did christ belong to a denomination the obvious answer is no he was against them and they hated him for that did jehovah i think that's an overwhelming no neither does his bride she is part of him see she's not part of a man-made system she needs no dogma she won't have any she'll be absolutely virgin how how by the word that's the beauty of it by the word shall punctuate every word god says with an amen oh be it unto me see now watch him uh uh take a type from mary uh beat unto me according to thy word amen oh my there you are punctuate god's word when adam now watch him cover history when adam came to his wife she was pregnant and before they came together adam and eve she was pregnanted with the corrupt seed from the serpent when adam come to his wife he found her and this is an important point pregnant to death now you're going to find out there's a reason for that but when joseph the husband of mary the espoused of mary but when joseph the human come to his wife mary she was pregnanted with life the word of god now what caused the different pregnation because that adam's wife doubted the word that's right joseph's bride believed the word that's the difference next slide now now that's genesis all right watch him come forward now we fi he found her christ comes to his bride what does he find her same thing just like adam see why when she first started out now listen i don't want you to miss this when she started out she was a virgin she was going to be all right she went right on that early church used to be wonderful god gave him a bride and what did she do if you know your history if you know history in 606 she goes right down there and pregnant herself with the roman dogma hold their ma an organization 606 is an important date in early church history because that's the up until that point there had been divided and shared authority throughout the christian church they had where we always talk about what happened at nicaea in 325 that was just the the groundwork the seed laying it in there but we find out that the whole idea of presbyters and bishops and and and hierarchical orders of men uh uh conquering the laity and that they they started out with local churches then they began to cover certain areas then regions then whole uh national regions and they argued between constantinople and rome who should be the single bishop over the entire christian world and it was in 606 that that began that the pontiff of rome contrary to his predecessor who had eight years prior said nobody should take that title bishop of of the whole christian faith but eight years later his predecessor i want to say gregory that might stand correction but it's pretty i don't think it is greg i think gregory is the one who said we shouldn't take that title eight years later another one comes along and he actually in 606 begins to declare i am the bishop of the entire christian world and of course so brother branham picks this up now in 606 she goes right down there and pregnant herself with roman dogma and organization next all right and from that on that old mother in the bible gave birth to churches and they were harlots which is a that's protestants because they was everyone born right out of her and everyone took her own thing organization now you see why i'm against it brother branham wasn't against people brother branham knew that god had children in all the organizations that he needed to rescue out of there but he was against the system all right now for the birth of the word is christ not of polluted with denominations the early church no denominations brother god laid the word down like that and the holy spirit irrigated it i love that description god laid down the word like that and the holy spirit irrigated it and there she went she brought forth children certainly all right that first aegis did that but this church can't do it she's too denominated see she can't do it she's got the world mixed up with her and i'm going to tell you something friends any time you allow the world to be mixed with your faith you become sterile and cannot reproduce the life of christ it effectively hinders you so she got mixed up with the with the though she's got the world mixed up with her look what they did now now what then she went whoring here we go back to genesis like adam's wife did in eden and jehovah's wife did in the days of samuel you remember that in the days of samuel that took a king divorced god her espoused husband and his word and said we want a king and samuel said god is your king but we want a king anyway and they couldn't deny that samuel had always told him the truth had always demonstrated the power of god had been a man above reproach and that he had thoroughly demonstrated that god would be a loyal husband but they didn't want that they chose of their own choosing to choose a man-made system which was a human monarchy next slide and his prophet his outlet to his word and she this is what she rejected went whoring like the rest of the nations and god divorced her same has he done today same act sons of the bride commit adultery see with the the bride god's son his bride from pentecost virgin with the word went whoring and committed adultery just like adam's wife did just like jehovah's wife did and here in the son's wife she goes whoring committing adultery with the romans god's plural gods do we have one more and for her lover's sake the roman gods tried to take her own husband and split him into three to please her lovers god have mercy sure they got hundreds of gods oh sure astarte the sun god balaam sun god and queen of heaven all that stuff there so the bride to please her ill-famed lovers uh now hold right there at that blank screen so we're realizing then that brother branham is proving that by history which is incontrovertible people can argue doctrine all day long history is incontrovertible the record is clear what you see him going back to genesis you can read it for yourself what eve did you can go into the books of the kings and read what the israel did you can come to the days of church history and you can see what the church did in 325 in 606 and then you can see how that protestantism came out of that system so you can see that what the bible prophesied in the book of revelation of the future because remember that's what the book of revelation is it's not it's not the record and this is an important point i'm getting ahead of myself on but i want to put this in here the book of revelation is not the work of jesus of nazareth that was a work of that god did that was the man who the logos lived in and god was in him reconciling the world to himself but the book of revelation is the work of jesus the logos in his bride in his church you get that so it's it's not it's not different gods it's just god in a different mask and so he laid that body the body of the nazarene on the altar and it's laid there interceding for ignorance interceding for our sins it's an advocate thank god we have it it's a perpetual atonement that even before you commit a sin you're already forgiven even before that you've even done anything wrong there's already a blood there speaking for you at all times now it only speaks for his family because only the only the predestinated are considered in redemption because it's those who he buys back so we realize then that brother branham is showing and proving by the bible and proving by history that we were to come down to an end time and there would have to be a restored message to bring the body back to the original faith so that christ works through her again unhindered all right now i want you to look at a unique quality this is a this is a one-off for this age there was there was no other age in the new testament era like what you're about to read the last time this uh characteristic is seen is in the days of enoch and after enoch who was translated it's not seen again until the day and hour that we live in all right brother brother matt let's go i'm going to close with this brother branham in countdown 1964. but now friends may i say this it has come to the age of astronaut so that wasn't paul's day that's this day come to the age of astronaut all right see we don't have more than what paul had in on in revelation but we do have a different type of manifestation because there's a different anointing on this age to accomplish a different purpose all right remember that we're not looking to go on in church ages this is the harvest age we're looking to take a body change that paul prophesied was coming went to the third heaven came back with the evidence that it's there it's real and he heard things even in the presence of god all right so he says we've now this has come to the age of astronaut we've we have moved out of the airplane age see their astronaut would have meant that would have been a foreign uh word in any language to paul astronaut what's an astronaut all right now we have moved out of the airplane age we've got more power now the astronaut age has come in what is it not a we've come into a spiritual age of astronaut see going above it's not it's the same spirit only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more be more like christ not the automobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one now it's interesting because that uh that when we when we talk about that this is the time of the unfulfilled portion of the original word that takes place in this last age uniquely closer to the body change than the initial church under the apostles and so we we realized that that the word astronaut let me give you this i think i have it the word astronaut means a person who is trained to travel in a spacecraft all right now let's read on it's called the eagle age in the bible god calls his prophets eagle age and we realize over in the bible we find out in malachi 4 that were promised that in the last days now he likes his prophets to eagles he calls himself eagle he is the great jehovah eagle so i want to make the point because i'm not going to get to expound on this today because i'm out of time but i'm not i'm not suggesting that that that that paul and that church under the son of man ministry didn't have the same power but it's just simply god giving the anointing to accomplish a different person you understand all right that seed had to go into the ground so there's no need to give them an astronaut anointing there's no need for an eagle anointing they're not going to be lifted off the earth this is the age that gets lifted off the earth all right so it's the same spirit all right but now it's just a different manifestation so he says he is the great jehovah eagle he's able to achieve to himself a bride he is going to in the last days be able to get a bride that with a ministry that's so exactly like a man and his wife becomes one very quickly and when jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly what he said in saint john 14 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also it also fulfilled what jesus said would take place as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man next and when jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one ah it fulfills the scripture exactly what he said in saint john oh i've read this already go to the next the next i must have double posted that now is the astronaut age and the astronaut sees things that the horserider automobile airplane either sees he goes higher the airplane is still down here bouncing around in the clouds and having blowouts and hit downs and everything else but he keeps but he goes beyond the clouds of creeds and denominations moves up into the heaven plum away from everything the astronaut age we are living in the astronaut age just as sure as god has testified by the natural happenings there so is he testifying now that if we've achieved an astronaut god has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to malachi 4. amen amen is there another one i think that's it okay so god bless you we're going to be out of time with that amen and uh the service will begin let's pray the regular service will begin shortly father we thank you for your word today and master we commit it now to you keep the people's minds and hearts open to learning because we're just getting we're just getting into the into the real gears and meat of it lord and so we want to understand it clearly so i commit it to you in jesus name amen that's where we'll begin uh on our next lesson we'll begin right back there with countdown and then i won't because there's a lot i want to say on the whole idea of an astronaut age god bless you [Music] you
