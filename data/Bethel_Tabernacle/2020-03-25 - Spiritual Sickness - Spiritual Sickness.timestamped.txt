[33:22] here indeed a man we want to look in
[33:26] Genesis chapter 2 and want to speak to
[33:28] you tonight about spiritual sickness
[33:32] spiritual sickness amen Genesis chapter
[33:37] 2 we just have one single verse to read
[33:40] and we'll let you be seated verse 7 and
[33:45] the Lord God formed man of the dust of
[33:48] the ground and breathed into his
[33:52] nostrils the breath of life and man
[33:54] became a living soul let's pray father I
[34:02] stand here tonight Lord with them what I
[34:05] would at least consider Lord to be a
[34:08] very technical teaching service tonight
[34:11] Lord and I'm under some bit of anxiety
[34:15] to make sure that I have it all in order
[34:18] Lord and perfectly aligned and I've
[34:21] spent the entire day now my mind
[34:23] saturated with it I've been studying it
[34:27] Lord for more than a week now and so
[34:29] here it is I probably myself would have
[34:32] never scheduled to preach this on a
[34:34] Wednesday but I don't get to choose that
[34:36] so it's up to you you had it for tonight
[34:39] so Lord I'm just been all day now and
[34:42] I'm counting on you now father as I have
[34:45] talked it over with you at length Lord
[34:48] that I'm just trusting in you tonight to
[34:49] teach us the things that you want us to
[34:51] know I commit it to you commit the whole
[34:54] streaming audience Lord let the stream
[34:57] work good father there's a lot of people
[34:59] depending on it tonight on our website
[35:02] streaming on Facebook streaming some
[35:04] perhaps YouTube streaming Lord we just
[35:07] want all of it to work good I pray that
[35:09] you will bless the instruments and bless
[35:12] the signal and be with the brothers if
[35:15] there'd be a technical difficulty you'd
[35:16] dis whisper the answer to them right
[35:18] quick we commit it to you Lord and we
[35:20] are looking to you now in these in these
[35:25] strange and unsettling times for the
[35:28] world so be with us now and teach us
[35:30] what you need us to know in Jesus name
[35:33] Amen God bless your friends you can be
[35:36] seated now I want to say mainly to the
[35:40] streaming audience before you step off
[35:42] let me make this announcement as you all
[35:46] know the governor issued a directive
[35:49] authorizing law enforcement to break up
[35:54] any groups greater than three people so
[35:58] we are ten here tonight and brother Matt
[36:02] contacted the Buford County Sheriff's
[36:04] Department they said he talked to a
[36:07] sergeant they do not have any
[36:08] understanding from sheriff Tanner what
[36:11] his plans are as far as enforcement of
[36:13] that we're hoping that we won't be
[36:16] interrupted if you see me suddenly stop
[36:20] and suddenly I'm in a conversation with
[36:23] someone at the back you'll understand
[36:25] that they've come in and if that happens
[36:27] then we'll go to dismiss everybody
[36:30] except myself and brother mark we will
[36:32] stay here I will keep on preaching
[36:34] brother mark we'll keep broadcasting and
[36:36] then that would put us in compliance so
[36:38] we should be able to finish but if
[36:40] there's a disturbance just please give
[36:42] us a minute to get it arranged and then
[36:45] we'll carry on god bless you brothers
[36:46] Thank You Amen god bless amen praise the
[36:49] Lord just want to be aware so that
[36:53] people don't
[36:55] panic a man spoke to brother Kevin he
[37:00] wasn't aware that there was any plans
[37:02] for enforcement so at least on churches
[37:05] meeting in small groups we are following
[37:07] the federal guideline from President and
[37:10] the CDC so hopefully that would be
[37:14] enough given that it's a church and we
[37:16] are keeping our distance apart I believe
[37:19] that we ought to obey Caesars desires so
[37:24] long as it doesn't conflict with the
[37:26] Word of God now I want to speak tonight
[37:29] on spiritual sickness and it's
[37:31] interesting because speaking to a very
[37:34] good friend of mine and minister and you
[37:37] know him well he's a good friend of us
[37:38] here and we were just talking about how
[37:41] that this you know this kovat 19 this
[37:45] coronavirus that seems to have the world
[37:48] at its knees you know it's in and and I
[37:51] was just watching today brother Tony was
[37:54] interviewing some folks over in Israel
[37:57] and they're just as bewildered by it
[37:59] everybody seems to can't figure out you
[38:03] know the level of fear but yet at the
[38:05] same time there's there's there's
[38:08] ominous possibilities so I guess it's
[38:11] just what the scripture says you know
[38:13] men's hearts failing for fear and I've
[38:16] said for years there is no greater fear
[38:18] than the fear of the unknown its
[38:20] intrinsic in a man to to fear and have
[38:23] anxiety when something is coming and he
[38:26] knows it's coming but he's not sure what
[38:28] its gonna look like or how it's gonna
[38:30] happen then that causes a lot of anxiety
[38:32] but lift up your heads Jesus said Amen
[38:36] this is not a time for the bride to be
[38:38] in fear I sent out a little greeting to
[38:42] the church today I trust you received it
[38:45] if you didn't you'll find it in the
[38:47] Bethel Tabernacle whatsapp chat just a
[38:49] little update from from me to you plan
[38:53] to keep that going periodically we're at
[38:56] tonight as one week we met last
[38:58] Wednesday for our first reduced
[39:01] congregation service like this and so
[39:04] now tonight is one week exactly and I
[39:06] think we still have some more days to go
[39:07] if
[39:08] the 15 days is up what day does that hit
[39:10] on hey April 1 maybe or I think maybe
[39:14] similar the last day of March something
[39:17] like that so we'll we'll see what's
[39:20] going on at that time all we can really
[39:22] say is you know it's what the president
[39:25] keeps saying we'll see that's all we
[39:27] know we'll see what happens and I'm sure
[39:30] that they are they've certainly
[39:31] demonstrated that they're making
[39:33] cautious decisions and we're trying to
[39:36] do the same thing now let me get right
[39:39] into the service here because it's a
[39:40] Wednesday and I have a little bit of
[39:41] limited limitation on my time some time
[39:47] ago I was trying to look at the date and
[39:49] it was quite a few years ago actually I
[39:51] took a sermon and used this scripture in
[39:57] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 the Lord God
[40:01] formed man of the dust of the ground
[40:03] breathed tuned into his nostrils the
[40:05] breath of life and he became a living
[40:08] soul and some some translations say a
[40:11] living being so man became a living
[40:14] being or a living soul and we find out
[40:19] that in the in the Hebrew I did a Hebrew
[40:21] study word word study and you know and
[40:25] took some commentary from Jewish rabbis
[40:29] and what more and I have them here
[40:31] quoted there is a certain rabbi Sherman
[40:35] spelt with a funny way that Jews would
[40:39] spell Sherman not like we would spell it
[40:40] but we find out that that God
[40:44] being a living being God fashioned from
[40:49] the dust the body and we know it's
[40:52] brother Branham taught us that the body
[40:54] of Adam stood there lifeless with his
[40:57] toes like roots going down into the
[40:59] ground where God grew him up like you'd
[41:02] grow a tree and then God breathed into
[41:05] him the breath of life and he became a
[41:08] living soul and so man then manifested
[41:12] as nephesh in the Hebrew word and we
[41:16] find out that that that in the that in
[41:19] the Mishnah which is an oral
[41:22] an oral tradition that they pass along
[41:25] that the rabbi's take this word and they
[41:28] use a synonym a perfect synonym of this
[41:31] word and it is in the Hebrew ma vay if
[41:34] I'm pronouncing that right and it's
[41:36] derived from the root bah-bah-bah and
[41:40] the verb means and it's an important
[41:43] verb it means to ask to seek or to
[41:49] request as in prayer and so when you
[41:56] when you take this root word to the
[42:00] Hebrew term that he became a living
[42:03] being and then you take the root of that
[42:07] that the rabbis used that means to ask
[42:09] to seek or to request as in prayer and
[42:13] rabbi Sherman comments in other words
[42:16] the Talmud defines when it says a living
[42:22] being or a living soul the Talmud
[42:25] defines that man as the creature that
[42:31] prays because if you think about it he's
[42:35] the only one that does God created all
[42:39] the animals and man is a mammal he's a
[42:42] human animal and he's the top of the
[42:45] animal world and he was made different
[42:49] than all the other animals below him in
[42:52] that he was made in the image now more
[42:56] the serpent was not exactly in the image
[42:59] of God though he wasn't upright beasts
[43:01] and he was more subtle than any beast of
[43:04] the field but he did not have a soul so
[43:07] he could not reason it was not like
[43:09] Lucifer is not like an angel not like
[43:12] God not like a man because a man is a
[43:16] triune being whereas all other animals
[43:19] are of dual nature they're not true they
[43:22] are not a triune being they are body and
[43:25] spirit they have a spirit of life and
[43:27] their spirit is what animates or powers
[43:31] your flesh if your spirit leaves your
[43:33] body your body lays down in
[43:35] and it doesn't talk it doesn't react it
[43:38] doesn't respond there's no life inside
[43:40] the body anymore all right so then we
[43:44] realized then that that this man that
[43:47] that God turned the earth into a
[43:51] creature that preys and so that then
[43:55] then you have to conclude in fact as you
[43:59] couldn't fail to conclude that God built
[44:02] man uh as a as a being of reciprocal
[44:07] fellowship that God built man on purpose
[44:11] so that that man could pray and in fact
[44:14] his praying is literally in his DNA that
[44:19] the very Ebru synonym of the fact that
[44:23] god made him a living soul meant that
[44:26] he's a creature that prays and in fact
[44:29] his one scholar called man praying dirt
[44:32] all right this is why that that the
[44:38] dictionary of Bible imagery defines Adam
[44:43] now there's there's Adam azzam as a
[44:45] proper name that was given to the first
[44:48] man that God made a living soul but
[44:51] remember that Adam existed before he was
[44:54] a living soul put in human flesh mate
[44:57] from the dust of the earth and so it
[45:00] defines Adam then when he's when he's
[45:03] incarnated in flesh and given a a the
[45:07] breath of life that Adam then is the
[45:10] fleshly distillation now brother branham
[45:14] would not use the word distill brother
[45:16] branham would use the word condescend
[45:19] see so so it's it's brother branham is
[45:24] meaning in the same sense that that that
[45:27] man this man that is now standing there
[45:30] is the fleshly distillation of the
[45:34] creative and divine word stamped says
[45:39] the dictionary of biblical imagery
[45:41] stamped with the divine image all right
[45:46] now
[45:48] this was a perfect situation this man
[45:52] was an amateur god he named the animals
[45:56] he commanded the wind he commanded
[45:59] nature God brother branham says God did
[46:01] not even make the earth for himself to
[46:04] rule he made man to rule God rules the
[46:07] universe and so we find then that the
[46:11] earth in its in its most probable
[46:13] purpose then is the genesis are the
[46:16] beginning of God extorting to express
[46:20] himself in a family and so he he he
[46:23] doesn't want to express himself in
[46:25] something different than he is or
[46:28] something different than what he hasn't
[46:30] envisioned for himself to be when he
[46:34] expresses God's eventually gonna express
[46:36] himself in flesh and so he's going to
[46:39] express his children to look just like
[46:41] him
[46:42] to act just like him to be built just
[46:46] like him
[46:47] oh my we're gonna go somewhere tonight
[46:48] so I hope you really stay close
[46:51] attention all right now what caused the
[46:56] fall now we would say well you know as
[47:00] the story goes Lucifer
[47:03] you know desiring to have a kingdom like
[47:05] Michael who wanted to build his kingdom
[47:07] and be worshipped like God he starts out
[47:09] he realizes he can't create he doesn't
[47:11] have that power he had every power he
[47:13] wasn't a 90-pound weakling Lucifer had
[47:16] every power that Michael had except one
[47:18] he couldn't create and this made him
[47:21] jealous he was envious of that so he's
[47:24] going to create his family vicariously
[47:27] through a medium through an instrument
[47:30] you understand and he's going to he's
[47:33] going to use the serpent because the
[47:36] serpent is built unique for God's
[47:38] purpose the serpent looks like a man is
[47:41] upright like a man but he can't reason
[47:44] he's more subtle than any beast of the
[47:46] field but he can't reason the Word of
[47:48] God because he doesn't have a soul but
[47:51] he uniquely apart from all other animals
[47:55] has a place for one but the place is
[47:59] empty you have a place for a soul
[48:02] and it's filled with Europe so you
[48:04] understand and that that area is in the
[48:07] is in the heart brother branham said
[48:08] they even even biology they have found
[48:11] that there's a little place in the heart
[48:14] that the for years they didn't know what
[48:15] its purpose was and they think now it's
[48:17] where you know life ik life starts in a
[48:20] human being and so brother Branham says
[48:22] even God makes science prove his word
[48:24] because the Bible says as a man thinketh
[48:27] in his heart man
[48:29] so so now we realized then that Satan is
[48:33] going to he's going to if I could put it
[48:38] this way Satan is going to infect the
[48:43] spirit of the serpent he's going to come
[48:49] like a virus would and I'm going to show
[48:51] you an illustration animation three
[48:53] animations right quick that will help
[48:55] you get your mind around the natural
[48:57] typing the spiritual because brother
[49:00] amps are they running perfect continuity
[49:02] that natural always type spiritual now
[49:04] never the other way because the spirit
[49:07] is the real it's the original what what
[49:10] this is this I know this seems solid and
[49:13] this seems solid and this seems solid
[49:14] this is all just shadow there is a real
[49:18] brother Brendan said you see a tree
[49:20] struggling out here to live it proves
[49:22] there's one somewhere that doesn't
[49:24] struggle you see a no on old man gasping
[49:28] trying to live he said it proves there
[49:29] somewhere you know I thought about that
[49:31] as brother Eddie laying there on a
[49:33] hospital bed
[49:34] slipping away from us gasping on a
[49:36] ventilator trying to breathe and I
[49:38] thought there's a body waiting on him
[49:39] that doesn't struggle to breathe alright
[49:44] by the gorge we're gonna go in
[49:45] succession all three of them start with
[49:48] one then two then three and so just give
[49:50] me your attention here for a minute
[49:52] because I want to show you the natural
[49:54] typing the spiritual you're gonna see
[49:56] what
[49:59] it threw the serpent in EVE you're going
[50:03] to see how Satan then can now come into
[50:07] your body and bring us a physical
[50:10] sickness like a virus and then you're
[50:13] going to see and you might not catch it
[50:15] until I start preaching on it but then
[50:17] you're going to see how Satan
[50:19] contaminates our minds and how that
[50:21] Jesus gives us an inoculation all right
[50:24] a man so let's go brother George we'll
[50:26] watch the first one first plenty of
[50:28] sound is how virus gets in body
[50:39] [Music]
[50:54] it's just like these are human cells
[51:01] that it's inside
[51:13] contact this is the moment when
[51:18] infection begins this is the moment when
[51:21] infection begins
[51:22] how does infection happen how do you see
[51:26] the tiny shapes there on the virus
[51:28] particle sir if you see the tiny shapes
[51:30] they're a seamless random long random
[51:32] block in reality they are tiny key in
[51:34] reality proteins that have evolved to
[51:37] the peripheral shape that has evolved to
[51:38] the perfect genital side to unlock these
[51:41] resembles m2 on the surface reselling
[51:43] cell on the surface of this smile and a
[51:46] handshake the virus the virus this is
[51:49] welcome cell and is welcomed in where it
[51:53] will command the cell
[51:55] more cells to make more virus particles
[52:04] interesting I notice it has keys and
[52:08] like a smile and a handshake it deceives
[52:11] the long cell into thinking it's
[52:13] harmless giving the next another Jorge
[52:19] every cell in your body is a tiny
[52:22] factory every cell in your body is a
[52:24] tiny factors constant your genetic
[52:27] protein or DNA direct cellular genetic
[52:30] directing making machinery in the cell
[52:32] reads the cells in may in a hurry in the
[52:35] cell and make sure this is Proteus Bay
[52:37] where they're needed and make sure the
[52:39] cell proteins go where they're needed
[52:46] viruses have their own genetic of irises
[52:49] of their own they don't have the
[52:50] machinery to copy they don't have the
[52:52] machinery to copy so viruses need your
[52:55] cells so viruses reproduce machinery to
[52:58] reproduce themselves a virus starts this
[53:00] process by useless noise on its surface
[53:03] by games injuries on its surface to gain
[53:05] entry like a Trojan horse it enters the
[53:08] cell Trojan horse it enters the cell
[53:10] [Music]
[53:13] the virus releases its own DNA into the
[53:16] unsuspecting cell and hijacks the
[53:19] protein making machinery now this vital
[53:24] cell function becomes an assembly line
[53:26] for new virus particles no longer in
[53:32] service to your body the cell now serves
[53:35] the virus manufacturing thousands of new
[53:38] virus particles which are released to
[53:41] enslave more cells thousands and
[53:45] thousands more now before we start the
[53:51] third one they're going to show you how
[53:52] they make vaccine so I want you to
[53:57] notice the language of the natural
[53:59] typing the spiritual you've got a virus
[54:02] cell now remember that brother branham
[54:06] when he deals in divine healing he talks
[54:08] about a tumor and he says it's just a
[54:11] multiplication of cells he says a lot of
[54:13] times it's cells that have back slid and
[54:15] they're not doing what they're supposed
[54:17] to be doing and they start multiplying
[54:19] and it creates a tumor he says now when
[54:23] I'm praying for someone I'm not dealing
[54:25] with the tumor he said I'm dealing with
[54:27] the life inside the tumor I'm commanding
[54:31] because the life inside it is a devil
[54:33] amen Jesus never the science causing all
[54:36] kinds of diseases brother Graham said
[54:38] whether it's cancer TB or a even names
[54:40] pneumonia viral pneumonia doesn't matter
[54:42] what it is bacterial he said it's a
[54:45] devil and he says then I I command the
[54:49] devil to leave and then he says then the
[54:51] virus shrinks I mean he said then the
[54:54] tumor shrinks inside the person who said
[54:56] if it's cataracts they'll start to
[54:57] shrink and then as that cataract or that
[55:00] tumor inside begins to corrupt because
[55:02] it's just it's just human cells
[55:05] multiplied it starts to break up because
[55:07] it's dead it has no life in it just like
[55:10] when Jesus walked up to the tree and
[55:12] cursed the life in the tree now the tree
[55:15] was still standing their tree didn't go
[55:17] anywhere but it the life was gone from
[55:19] it and by the next day they come and
[55:22] they can see it starting to wither so
[55:25] when the life goes
[55:27] out of that multiplication of cells then
[55:31] the body's own tender then the body's
[55:33] own chain of events set off it starts to
[55:36] shrink and then as it corrupts it swells
[55:39] and then people who had cataracts get
[55:42] healed and then in 72 hours
[55:44] corruption sets in those cells start
[55:46] swelling up their corrupting is what
[55:48] they are but then people go back blind
[55:51] and say oh I must have lost my healing
[55:54] brother branham says brother sister that
[55:56] is the best sign you got your healing
[55:58] and then sometimes he said if the tumor
[56:00] is inside your body then as it breaks
[56:03] down and rots within you because it's a
[56:05] dead sted collection of cells and then
[56:07] it starts to decay break up it poisons
[56:10] the bloodstream you get a fever you get
[56:12] sick you think you've lost your healing
[56:14] it's the best sign you've got your
[56:16] healing the heart rate increases you
[56:18] know everything's yo you you get
[56:20] violently ill but it's because it's your
[56:22] body's divine healing purging out all of
[56:26] that disease now notice that when this
[56:29] virus comes in it has an intelligence of
[56:31] its own alright and it uses the word the
[56:36] virus and I love the language it uses it
[56:39] deceives the lung cell into thinking I'm
[56:44] harmless it deceives the lung cell into
[56:47] thinking it's one of us and it lets it
[56:50] in and then as you saw what goes on when
[56:52] it goes in there remember that the virus
[56:55] doesn't have its own machinery now how
[57:00] many remember brother branham saying a
[57:02] devil is almost helpless unless he can
[57:06] get somebody to work through you follow
[57:10] me you got you getting this so now so
[57:13] now the virus doesn't have its own
[57:15] machinery it needs your machinery that
[57:19] God built into you you understand your
[57:23] cell upon cell you you rejuvenate cells
[57:26] that's how you stay alive and and and
[57:29] you eat food and and I'm not gonna go
[57:30] down into the biology of it sister
[57:32] Meredith Verlander who could give us a
[57:33] better breakdown but but we find that
[57:36] that the biology is what it's trying to
[57:40] get its hands on
[57:41] trying to get inside the cell and then
[57:43] it enslaves did you notice what it said
[57:45] it enslaves the cell and then that cell
[57:49] that even though it might not want to it
[57:52] was made in the image of God but now it
[57:55] starts using its own machinery to
[57:58] reproduce other viruses that are going
[58:01] to infect its brothers and sisters
[58:03] around it well going somewhere you got
[58:10] me I can see you're with me now let me
[58:13] let me before we get to that third one
[58:15] I'm just in my mind trying to figure out
[58:17] where I want to show that let me so now
[58:19] let me start back and look at Adam and
[58:21] Eve so now the serpent doesn't have a
[58:24] soul he's got a place for one so Satan
[58:28] can't create Satan doesn't have the
[58:32] machinery to create so he needs someone
[58:37] else's machinery you understand and so
[58:41] he's got to have Eve's
[58:44] machinery to reproduce children by you
[58:48] follow me so now what is he going to do
[58:50] you're gonna see multiple we could do
[58:52] multiple breakdowns of it first he's
[58:54] going to come and enter into the serpent
[58:56] and he's going to give the serpent a
[58:59] soul which is his own soul Lucifer's
[59:02] nature and now the serpent can think he
[59:05] can reason he can look at the word he
[59:09] can now have desires like human beings
[59:13] no wonder the serpent could say to Eve
[59:15] listen you be like God trust me I know
[59:19] this by experience I was just a brute
[59:22] animal walking around but now my eyes
[59:25] have come open and what's happening is
[59:28] the serpent isn't even aware that's the
[59:30] enemy talking through him the enemy now
[59:32] has has enslaved his mind
[59:35] - now reason the Word of God and talk to
[59:39] Eve and Eve now he could have never done
[59:42] it to Adam because Adam was was in the
[59:45] original creation building the image of
[59:47] God perfectly he was the fleshly
[59:50] distillation of the creative and Divine
[59:52] Word stamped with the divine aim
[59:54] there's no way Satan our tent serpents
[59:57] could have got to Adam but Eve now God
[1:00:01] holding her for the second phase in a
[1:00:05] bi-product she is she's comes from that
[1:00:08] first creation just like just like
[1:00:10] machinery produces byproducts and
[1:00:12] byproducts can be very useful and so
[1:00:14] it's not it's not a disparaging comment
[1:00:16] like some people say a woman's it's a
[1:00:17] byproduct that's not a disparaging
[1:00:19] remark it's just a scientific fact from
[1:00:22] the scripture so it comes now
[1:00:25] God separates out the feminist part the
[1:00:28] weaker part puts it in her and now she's
[1:00:31] vulnerable now she's not vulnerable at
[1:00:35] all as long as she stays fortified
[1:00:38] behind the word so Satan comes and
[1:00:42] through a smile and a handshake gets her
[1:00:45] to believe in her mind not she's got a
[1:00:48] soul so now he's going to communicate
[1:00:50] nature to nature through the lips of a
[1:00:54] serpent into the ears of Eve from the
[1:00:57] separate from Satan's heart down into
[1:01:00] Eve's heart you understand and through a
[1:01:03] smile and a handshake deceive her and
[1:01:07] believing he's okay and this is good for
[1:01:11] food and something to be desired you see
[1:01:15] you see the natural type in his
[1:01:17] spiritual all right so now so then the
[1:01:21] serpent became a medium or a carrier of
[1:01:24] this false word just like a virus that
[1:01:27] had no engine of its own so like the
[1:01:30] virus tricked the cell she believed his
[1:01:34] line.i brother Branham says it like this
[1:01:35] when she believed his li II then she
[1:01:41] received his LIF e amen now bear in mind
[1:01:46] Jesus is going to show us the principle
[1:01:49] that weather the weather a physical act
[1:01:52] of adultery takes place or not
[1:01:54] when you commit when you reject the Word
[1:01:58] of God
[1:01:58] you're already committing adultery
[1:02:01] against Christ as calling him your
[1:02:04] husband
[1:02:05] amen so now we find that as soon as Eve
[1:02:09] receives his lie in the mind of God
[1:02:13] she's already guilty of spiritual
[1:02:15] adultery with Lucifer through the
[1:02:19] infected spirit of the serpent who was
[1:02:23] infected with this lie from Lucifer you
[1:02:27] still with me all right so then Eve and
[1:02:32] I'm going to use brother branham's
[1:02:33] language for you
[1:02:35] even is she becomes a tool to make the
[1:02:41] connection from the fallen nature of
[1:02:44] Lucifer in the spirit world
[1:02:46] down into the spirit life inside man in
[1:02:50] the natural world she's going to produce
[1:02:53] another human who when he's born has an
[1:02:58] infection in his spirit you understand
[1:03:04] and it's it's not for holiness it's an
[1:03:07] infection it's not in the original Satan
[1:03:10] couldn't produce it on his own he didn't
[1:03:12] have the machinery so through lies and
[1:03:15] through deception he tricks God's God's
[1:03:20] sons wife into accepting this act it
[1:03:24] becomes a physical act and then and then
[1:03:27] he brings forth children and now because
[1:03:29] of this now every child that's born is
[1:03:33] born in sin because why it's a it's now
[1:03:38] a an out of control replication of a
[1:03:42] false word you should bring children
[1:03:45] forth let me show you how to do it she
[1:03:47] was never supposed to use that method
[1:03:49] Christ she would have eventually come to
[1:03:52] that but not the Serpent's way you
[1:03:54] understand and so now because now once
[1:03:57] that happened and she fell and then Adam
[1:04:00] realizing she would be killed who loved
[1:04:02] her played the part of Christ took her
[1:04:04] quickly brother Brennan said to himself
[1:04:06] have the same act with her because now
[1:04:08] he's putting his seed in her and now God
[1:04:11] can't touch her because he would be
[1:04:13] destroying a part of Adam do you
[1:04:15] understand friends
[1:04:16] that that's why Satan can't destroy even
[1:04:19] a part of God you are not God but you
[1:04:22] are a part of God
[1:04:23] you're just the fact that you have only
[1:04:26] his seed was enough to secure you for
[1:04:29] all eternity
[1:04:32] just one Act one discharge of seed
[1:04:36] inside her secured her from destruction
[1:04:39] God couldn't touch her just like Sarah
[1:04:42] Sarah lied to God that's blasphemy but
[1:04:45] God couldn't destroy her because she
[1:04:47] carried within her the seed of Abraham
[1:04:49] and she had become flesh of his flesh
[1:04:51] and bone of his bone I'm here to take
[1:04:53] something friends what you are in Christ
[1:04:55] is more than the devil wants you to
[1:04:57] believe you are but now we realize that
[1:05:01] every man then is is born through this
[1:05:04] way because now that the fall has
[1:05:06] happened now no more people can be born
[1:05:09] by the word until God does it himself in
[1:05:13] a virgin thousands of years later and
[1:05:16] God is going to not God's not going to
[1:05:19] need anybody's machinery he's got his
[1:05:21] own creative power hallelujah he's going
[1:05:25] to speak thus the egg and the seed he's
[1:05:28] going to place it in the incubation
[1:05:30] chamber of a woman's womb and then as
[1:05:33] and then as that little egg begins to
[1:05:35] and that cell begins to get a spine and
[1:05:38] he says it begins to push out arms and
[1:05:40] push out legs and he said then God steps
[1:05:42] down in and and what is born is now
[1:05:45] little baby Jehovah once again God has
[1:05:50] distilled himself into the literal image
[1:05:54] of the creative word stamped with a
[1:05:59] divine image so that God can then
[1:06:03] reverse-engineer Satan's infection so
[1:06:07] that now it's so powerful that even
[1:06:10] though you are born in sin and have no
[1:06:14] possibility to change it yourself
[1:06:16] God rich in mercy coming into Christ
[1:06:20] taking on the penalty of that sin than
[1:06:22] you just by simply receiving the word
[1:06:26] the
[1:06:27] Eve rejected and you receive it and say
[1:06:30] a man to it and the supernatural magical
[1:06:34] power of God reverses the whole
[1:06:36] situation and says you are now born
[1:06:39] again see now let's have the third video
[1:06:49] now we're going to show you how they
[1:06:51] make vaccine watch this
[1:06:54] thirdly human viruses are highly adapted
[1:06:58] to growing in humans viruses are highly
[1:07:01] adapted to growing in his mattresses
[1:07:02] reproduce thousands of times in human
[1:07:05] services replete access using specific
[1:07:08] receptors that each mouse s using
[1:07:10] specific receptors that match molecules
[1:07:12] on cell surfaces like athletes they get
[1:07:15] stronger and stronger by continually
[1:07:18] training under the same conditions and
[1:07:21] strength that makes it possible to
[1:07:24] weaken the virus this weakening is the
[1:07:27] key to making live vaccines how do
[1:07:31] scientists make this kind of vaccine by
[1:07:34] forcing the virus to grow in different
[1:07:36] kinds of cells in the lab in these chick
[1:07:42] embryo cells most of the virus particles
[1:07:44] that were so good at growing in humans
[1:07:46] can't access the chick cells but with
[1:07:51] sheer numbers on their side a few virus
[1:07:54] particles are able to unlock the chick
[1:07:56] cells infect them and begin adapting to
[1:07:59] this new environment the virus adapts by
[1:08:04] modifying its genes but there's a price
[1:08:07] to pay as the virus gets better and
[1:08:10] better at growing in the chick cells it
[1:08:13] gets worse and worse at growing in our
[1:08:15] cells
[1:08:17] now when reintroduced to the human body
[1:08:20] as a vaccine these modified or weakened
[1:08:24] viruses have a hard time infecting human
[1:08:26] cells the virus multiplies less
[1:08:30] efficiently giving the immune system the
[1:08:33] time it needs to gather information
[1:08:34] about the virus and mount an antibody
[1:08:37] response the vaccine provides immunity
[1:08:41] to natural infection without making us
[1:08:44] pay the price of natural infection now
[1:08:51] brother branham doesn't often use the
[1:08:53] word vaccine what brother branham uses
[1:08:56] is inoculation and he talks about how
[1:09:00] that Satan come because remember Satan
[1:09:03] had the power of death over man and this
[1:09:06] weary job thus we read David and we read
[1:09:08] Solomon and we read everybody and didn't
[1:09:10] matter how holy they ever were they
[1:09:13] could not go into the presence of God
[1:09:15] they were kept in a special compartment
[1:09:17] in the lower regions of the earth called
[1:09:20] paradise there was a great gulf fixed
[1:09:22] between the the paradise side and the
[1:09:25] prison side that was hell and so we
[1:09:28] realize but it still wasn't where they
[1:09:30] wanted to be you understand and even
[1:09:32] even even their limited because even
[1:09:35] when when when when you see Samuel or
[1:09:38] you see saw calling Samuel from the
[1:09:40] grave you notice you ever notice in the
[1:09:42] Bible that Samuel still an old man
[1:09:44] because young do yet that makes perfect
[1:09:46] sense if you think it through
[1:09:48] because the only body that Samuel can
[1:09:51] inhabit and reappear is the old body
[1:09:54] that went to the grave so he's got to
[1:09:55] pick it back up and he's upset why have
[1:09:57] you disturbed me from my rest why'd you
[1:10:00] make me come back into this old
[1:10:01] brokedown body again yeah you see
[1:10:04] friends that that when you when you
[1:10:05] begin to realize what God has done for
[1:10:09] us in living in Christ Jesus and so so
[1:10:13] we realized in that there they can't
[1:10:15] come into the presence of God until God
[1:10:17] comes in Christ and descends into the
[1:10:20] lower parts of the earth takes the keys
[1:10:22] of death and hell takes them from Satan
[1:10:24] unlocks paradise empties it a sins on
[1:10:28] high takes them into the
[1:10:29] presence of God and then comes back down
[1:10:32] lays that body on the altar as a
[1:10:34] perpetual atonement so to this very hour
[1:10:36] that blood is speaking for you and me
[1:10:38] and then he sent back that life down
[1:10:42] into the church now why is that life so
[1:10:45] important because that's the life that
[1:10:48] Satan struck his virus of death in the
[1:10:51] body of the Lord Jesus and when he
[1:10:54] struck his his stinger in the body of
[1:10:57] Christ
[1:10:58] he lost his stinger in other words he
[1:11:01] lost his power
[1:11:02] Jesus took that and it killed him but
[1:11:06] then Jesus being God had power to raise
[1:11:08] himself up again and now that life in
[1:11:11] Christ coming down inside of you gives
[1:11:14] you an inoculation against the enemy now
[1:11:20] how important is the Holy Ghost friends
[1:11:23] you have such an inoculation that Satan
[1:11:26] can you see that's why it said there's a
[1:11:28] price to pay the cell pays a horrible
[1:11:31] price in getting stronger
[1:11:33] it got so it got stronger when it took
[1:11:36] Samson it got stronger when it took
[1:11:38] David he got stronger when it took
[1:11:40] Elijah I when it took Isaiah he got
[1:11:42] stronger and took John but when he took
[1:11:44] Jesus there was a price to pay
[1:11:47] hallelujah now that life can come inside
[1:11:49] of us that has already built antibodies
[1:11:53] against this virus of death now so we
[1:12:00] realized then that that eve becomes a
[1:12:03] tool she becomes a tool to make a
[1:12:07] connection for the fallen nature and
[1:12:10] Lucifer to get to to transfer from the
[1:12:15] spirit realm into the natural realm of a
[1:12:19] man and he's born in sin all right now
[1:12:24] sickness and disease happened the same
[1:12:28] way brother Graham said every sickness
[1:12:30] is a fourth dimension disease when it
[1:12:35] starts understand so so it's in it's in
[1:12:39] the spirit realm and a devil has no
[1:12:43] Harlee no power at all until it can get
[1:12:46] a host a virus has no machinery of its
[1:12:49] own it's a harmless thing until it can
[1:12:51] get a factory if it can take over a
[1:12:53] human cell factory inside your body then
[1:12:57] it can replicate itself so now now so so
[1:13:01] so I'm coming down to this so you have
[1:13:06] machinery you have I don't want to deal
[1:13:10] too much we've already talked quite a
[1:13:11] bit about the natural machinery of your
[1:13:13] cells to reproduce more cells to keep
[1:13:16] you alive
[1:13:17] to heal you if you get a cut you have
[1:13:20] factories that'll close it and if a
[1:13:23] doctor needs to stitch it he can stitch
[1:13:25] it but he still can't heal it your
[1:13:28] little factories heal it you understand
[1:13:31] when you get sick you have factories
[1:13:34] that that that's how vaccine works it
[1:13:37] gives the body enough time to study that
[1:13:39] invader figure out an antibody reproduce
[1:13:42] an antibody response and overwhelm the
[1:13:45] virus and eradicate it from the body
[1:13:47] then we come down into the mind and
[1:13:50] brother branham talks about memory
[1:13:52] reason and conscience and affection and
[1:13:54] imagination so you have you have a human
[1:13:58] engine you have a machinery that
[1:14:01] animates this body and powers it as I
[1:14:04] said if that machinery if that engine
[1:14:06] stops leaves the body the body can't
[1:14:09] live without its engine you understand
[1:14:12] so now no no go with me keep keep right
[1:14:15] with me so you have an engine and and
[1:14:19] and when we talk about the engines you
[1:14:22] know there's all kinds of different
[1:14:24] engines and and there are differing
[1:14:27] natures in an engine because you have a
[1:14:31] soul and the soul is the nature of your
[1:14:34] spirit you understand so the spirit is
[1:14:37] your is your factor your spirit is your
[1:14:39] engine that's keeping you alive but
[1:14:41] every engine there's different natures
[1:14:43] there's fossil fuel engines there's
[1:14:45] steam engines there's electric engines
[1:14:47] there's nuclear engines they all burn
[1:14:49] different types of fuel and run on
[1:14:51] different principles you understand you
[1:14:53] got me all right now you have an engine
[1:14:56] human spirit it's the engine of life and
[1:14:59] you are a living soul like Genesis 2:7
[1:15:05] you are a living being and your spirit
[1:15:08] has a nature the Spirit powers the body
[1:15:10] and the nature guides the spirit now it
[1:15:14] animates this spirit as your because
[1:15:17] you're a living soul it animates or it
[1:15:19] powers or it drives your body the soul
[1:15:23] is the nature of the spirit engine that
[1:15:27] powers the body and the mind your human
[1:15:30] engine now watch your human engine of
[1:15:32] life has only one of two natures running
[1:15:36] in its lines only one of two it only has
[1:15:39] one of two fuels on the human engine
[1:15:42] spirit you understand it either has a
[1:15:46] fallen Adamic from Adam a Demick it has
[1:15:52] a fallen Adamic nature from Adam and
[1:15:55] that's its nature see or it has a
[1:15:59] redeemed Zoe nature from Christ the
[1:16:04] second Adam now
[1:16:08] went before you're born again that your
[1:16:12] body is animated and driven and has an
[1:16:15] engine of a spirit that only has one
[1:16:18] fuel burning and that's a fallen nature
[1:16:19] and there's no battle there's no warfare
[1:16:23] you go right along you're a happy sinner
[1:16:25] caring right along you might have
[1:16:26] struggles and loneliness and depression
[1:16:28] you your lunch searching for something
[1:16:30] you know as we were all searching you
[1:16:32] know and God searching for us and we
[1:16:34] were searching for something that that
[1:16:37] was something of eternal quality crying
[1:16:39] out inside you but it doesn't come to
[1:16:41] life until you're born again now so the
[1:16:45] fallen nature from Adam even when you're
[1:16:50] born again you know there's still this
[1:16:52] fuel that fuels these ten inlets and
[1:16:55] outlets of the flesh and the mind the
[1:16:57] Bible teaches us that among whom we also
[1:16:59] had our conversation in times past in
[1:17:01] the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the
[1:17:03] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[1:17:06] we're by nature the children of Wrath
[1:17:08] even as others let me hurry
[1:17:10] so the new birth then is is literally I
[1:17:14] will call it like this the new birthday
[1:17:17] is the annihilation of the former nature
[1:17:21] in the realm of the soul and a brand new
[1:17:24] nature roars to life you understand a
[1:17:28] brand new nature down inside that spirit
[1:17:30] cranks up and starts operating the the
[1:17:33] old former nature in the soul is
[1:17:36] annihilated that fuel is gone that soul
[1:17:39] is a completely brand-new person or with
[1:17:43] a nature that's already connected to God
[1:17:47] amen and so we find out that it had
[1:17:51] actually been there all along just
[1:17:54] dormant
[1:17:55] so these two completely different
[1:17:58] natures are now available in the spirit
[1:18:02] engine of life within you that's why
[1:18:05] it's called the greatest battle ever
[1:18:07] fought before the new birth there's no
[1:18:10] fight your nature your soul agrees with
[1:18:15] the Fallen spirit that you got from Adam
[1:18:18] and Eve who were tricked by the serpent
[1:18:23] who was in who was infected by Lucifer
[1:18:26] amen and so now when you're born again
[1:18:29] you find out now that you've got this
[1:18:31] new fuel but now the default powers the
[1:18:36] default fuel powers the motions of sin
[1:18:40] in the flesh and mind the fuel of
[1:18:43] eternal life powers motions of
[1:18:46] righteousness in the flesh and the mind
[1:18:49] so it depends on what's fueling the
[1:18:52] spirit because your spirit your flesh is
[1:18:57] not born again it's still fallen it's
[1:19:00] still infected and that's why you've got
[1:19:04] to start living by the life of the inner
[1:19:06] man that new nature which is Zoe which
[1:19:10] is Christ which is the inoculation and
[1:19:15] you go about your daily life every day
[1:19:18] of your life burning
[1:19:20] one fuel or the other see all thoughts
[1:19:26] all actions are given fuel by one of
[1:19:31] these two nature's and all you have to
[1:19:36] do to figure out which fuel you're
[1:19:37] burning is are you running in the
[1:19:40] motions of sin and your flesh the
[1:19:43] motions of sin and your in your mind is
[1:19:45] your mind the playground of the enemy
[1:19:48] all the time and you you you you Harbor
[1:19:52] that criminal activity you Harbor those
[1:19:56] thoughts you don't cast them down as the
[1:19:59] Bible says you don't you don't
[1:20:01] whatsoever things are pure and what
[1:20:04] server things are lovely whatsoever
[1:20:05] things are of a good report think on
[1:20:08] these cast down vain imaginations cast
[1:20:12] down anything that exalts itself against
[1:20:14] the Word of God which which which fuel
[1:20:18] is your spirit feeding on does your
[1:20:21] spirit feed on the fuel it needs for
[1:20:23] righteousness or does your spirit which
[1:20:26] animates your body fuel on on Hollywood
[1:20:30] or the world you understand this ain't
[1:20:33] rocket science now friends this is y'all
[1:20:35] know what I'm talking about as human
[1:20:37] beings as sons and daughters of God we
[1:20:40] understand what this is this is me dying
[1:20:44] daily this is me exalting the word in my
[1:20:47] life this is me having a discipline of
[1:20:50] prayer that a life in my life this is me
[1:20:52] having a discipline of the Bible having
[1:20:54] a discipline of fellowship having a
[1:20:56] discipline of communication with God or
[1:20:59] is all of your communication with
[1:21:00] Laodicea and then you wonder why your
[1:21:06] the motions of sin worked so freely in
[1:21:09] your flesh it ain't a mystery see now
[1:21:14] watch this so all thoughts and all
[1:21:20] actions are given fuel by one of these
[1:21:22] two natures now brother branham is going
[1:21:26] to make a statement from the serpent
[1:21:29] seed and he starts talking about women
[1:21:33] which brother Branham was
[1:21:34] always railing against ill-famed women
[1:21:37] he was never brother Brenda you know
[1:21:40] labeled as a woman-hater Paul was
[1:21:41] labeled as that too brother Brandon
[1:21:44] while he admits to problems in his early
[1:21:46] childhood from things that he saw but
[1:21:48] yet the Holy Ghost New Birth gave him a
[1:21:50] love and an appreciation for godly women
[1:21:53] so much so that he called them the
[1:21:56] greatest thing for that God ever give a
[1:21:59] man outside of his eternal salvation was
[1:22:02] a wife all right so so brother Branham
[1:22:05] says speaking to these women who don't
[1:22:09] let Christ rule in their lives they get
[1:22:12] out and strip he says you get out here
[1:22:14] and strip your little shorty shorts and
[1:22:18] tie a little ribbon around like that and
[1:22:20] your baby and you're gonna cigarette out
[1:22:22] of hanging out of your mouth walking
[1:22:24] down the street you don't do it for no
[1:22:26] good purpose you might be innocent of
[1:22:28] the fact he's talking about you maybe
[1:22:30] you never commit adultery but but you in
[1:22:33] God's eyes you're gonna stand with the
[1:22:35] prostitutes even though you might be
[1:22:37] true to your husband because you present
[1:22:39] yourself that way and he says it like
[1:22:42] this the devil is using you for a tool
[1:22:47] just like he did Eve you see there so a
[1:22:55] woman dressed bad then is a tool like a
[1:23:00] virus that has no motor of its own but
[1:23:04] uses the engine of a man's fallen nature
[1:23:10] see she she's not going to go have an
[1:23:14] act with that man but when she presents
[1:23:17] herself that way he's going something's
[1:23:20] going to happen in his visuals and he's
[1:23:23] going to think a thought and God's gonna
[1:23:25] write it on his record that he committed
[1:23:27] adultery and it's gonna get written on
[1:23:29] her record that she also did because she
[1:23:32] if there's no power to make that happen
[1:23:34] in her but but by transmitting her spike
[1:23:37] transmitting herself in the wrong way
[1:23:39] she's going to infect his human mind
[1:23:44] and he's going to become guilty he might
[1:23:47] as well have committed the physical act
[1:23:50] so women dress bad is like a tool like a
[1:23:55] virus that had has no motor of its own
[1:23:58] no machinery of its own but it can't
[1:24:01] cause damage in and of itself but it
[1:24:04] literally caused that causes damage
[1:24:06] because it uses the engine of the man's
[1:24:09] fallen nature now I thought about this
[1:24:13] today as I was studying and I I thought
[1:24:17] to myself you know I'm not here and I
[1:24:19] wanted to say that I wanted to make that
[1:24:21] statement that I'm really not here
[1:24:25] tonight to take the stereotypical road
[1:24:30] that always seems to single out women
[1:24:33] now while it's true there is a let me
[1:24:38] say it like this it is true that in this
[1:24:41] last day and age according to the Bible
[1:24:43] there is a demonic anointing that is
[1:24:48] released on women at the end time
[1:24:52] sisters who are listening tonight beware
[1:24:55] there is a special set of special forces
[1:25:00] Devils who have one purpose in life and
[1:25:03] that's to anoint women in the last days
[1:25:06] now we could talk about all of the
[1:25:10] correlations in the scription we could
[1:25:11] talk about Revelation 13 and sin you
[1:25:14] know ending ending its run ah 13 being
[1:25:18] the number of America and that's where
[1:25:20] sin you know it makes its last stand in
[1:25:22] the United States because this as far
[1:25:25] west as it can go as the Lightning
[1:25:27] cometh out east even under the West and
[1:25:29] it walls up at Hollywood and he said
[1:25:31] that's why it's so sinful there and so
[1:25:33] perverted and you see the red carpet
[1:25:35] things that are so twisted it's because
[1:25:37] all the sin is heaped up there that's
[1:25:39] been coming westward for centuries and
[1:25:42] then for two centuries it's been come
[1:25:45] for it for two millennia it's been
[1:25:46] coming westward and and right here in
[1:25:50] America Revelation 13 is where sin makes
[1:25:53] its last stand and that's why it's a
[1:25:56] woman's nation
[1:25:57] elation 13 we could talk about how that
[1:26:00] the Antichrist church system is
[1:26:03] symbolized as a great and powerful woman
[1:26:08] catch it again the Antichrist church
[1:26:13] system is symbolized in the book of
[1:26:16] Revelation as a great and powerful woman
[1:26:20] who is who secretly practices sorcery
[1:26:26] and the name of Christ while it is true
[1:26:31] then that that that that if allowed you
[1:26:35] know Satan always seeks to use a woman
[1:26:38] of this fallen world as a very robust
[1:26:41] fuel delivery system to fallen man she's
[1:26:46] a very robust Transport entrance /
[1:26:49] tation delivery system - fallen man
[1:26:52] because she's out there on the streets
[1:26:54] dressing herself and and it wasn't it
[1:26:57] was the morals of woman of the falling
[1:27:00] of women's morals that brother Branham
[1:27:02] saw in his vision that was that
[1:27:05] literally was what was going to bring
[1:27:06] the whole world down and so we realized
[1:27:11] then that that it is incumbent on me its
[1:27:14] own coming on me as a preacher always to
[1:27:16] strike out it's in when I see it in
[1:27:19] heaping up in an ungodly practices on
[1:27:23] the streets I'm obligated as a preacher
[1:27:25] but my preach my primary preaching isn't
[1:27:28] to them do you realize that my primary
[1:27:32] preaching my preaching isn't primarily
[1:27:36] sent to preach to them say why brother
[1:27:38] Jason because a prophet of the last
[1:27:40] stage has already served a blanket
[1:27:43] indictment handed down from God's a
[1:27:47] Supreme Court my God doesn't need me to
[1:27:52] go behind the Prophet and redo that you
[1:27:54] understand now granted I'm always
[1:27:56] preaching in sin whenever I see it
[1:27:58] heaping up we always strike against it
[1:28:00] but but but I ministered to all I do
[1:28:03] minister to all but but my ministry fall
[1:28:08] in
[1:28:08] the final boys to the final age is not
[1:28:11] to Laodicea which has already gone dark
[1:28:15] and has already been judged and it's
[1:28:18] already been indicted my primary mission
[1:28:21] is to believe her sister's preaching to
[1:28:24] them preaching to believers sisters that
[1:28:27] they're not to partake of her sins the
[1:28:30] great the Mystery Babylon they're
[1:28:33] not to partake of her sins that filthy
[1:28:36] prostitute woman Church who's
[1:28:38] controlling and influencing the whole
[1:28:39] world my sisters were not my sisters let
[1:28:42] me say to you today you were not placed
[1:28:45] here - to receive of her plagues my
[1:28:48] ministry is to challenge and inspire you
[1:28:52] to rise higher and fly higher and move
[1:28:55] above all of that to rise above the
[1:29:01] pressure of the age that is trying to
[1:29:06] hold you back from everything that God
[1:29:10] has planned for you however there are
[1:29:18] many more fuel delivery services than
[1:29:21] women ministers are a major supplier
[1:29:28] ministers if if if they're not founded
[1:29:31] on the revealed truth they're one of the
[1:29:34] most robust fuel delivery systems in the
[1:29:38] world because they literally have the
[1:29:43] confidence of millions of people who
[1:29:45] hear them watered down the Word of God I
[1:29:48] mean I mean friends oh yeah I mean
[1:29:52] sometimes the imagery I think about you
[1:29:55] know it's almost like they open their
[1:29:56] Bible and just drowning all the ink runs
[1:29:59] together and you can't even turn the
[1:30:01] pages
[1:30:01] it's all a watered down gouache I
[1:30:05] believe the world needs it preached
[1:30:07] straight right exactly what God has
[1:30:11] revealed in this day it has restored in
[1:30:13] this last day and so so we we realized
[1:30:17] that there's many more fuel delivery
[1:30:19] systems for fallen man's name
[1:30:21] sure then just an ill-dressed woman on a
[1:30:25] nil somesome preacher who just has it
[1:30:29] for a meal ticket and won't tell the
[1:30:32] people the truth he's a he's a far more
[1:30:34] dangerous huh you talking about a
[1:30:36] dangerous human animal I wanna say this
[1:30:45] it might make you uncomfortable parents
[1:30:47] sharing this top honor - sure do parents
[1:30:53] share in the top honors as fuel delivery
[1:30:56] system because they literally literally
[1:31:00] and physically set every standard and
[1:31:04] practice that children are indoctrinated
[1:31:08] long before the preacher ever gets a
[1:31:11] crack at them parents set every standard
[1:31:17] and every practice that they are
[1:31:20] indoctrinated by you know and my
[1:31:22] experienced friends I got I have us I
[1:31:25] have a many great things and many great
[1:31:28] testimonies and many things that just I
[1:31:31] well up with tears of gratitude before
[1:31:33] God because of the while this is a this
[1:31:36] is not a position I ever wanted to be in
[1:31:39] I never wanted to be over other men I
[1:31:41] never wanted to live off of the support
[1:31:43] of other people I never wanted to have
[1:31:45] that kind of responsibility I wouldn't
[1:31:47] have it today I love you all enough I
[1:31:50] just sit right in the middle of you and
[1:31:51] we'd have somebody that would take their
[1:31:53] responsibility but God made me do it and
[1:31:56] I'm probably never getting out of it
[1:31:58] because brother Branham says the only
[1:32:00] kind of man God can use is a man who
[1:32:02] don't want to do it and God almost has
[1:32:05] to force him to do it but at the same
[1:32:08] time I'm not trying to get a pity party
[1:32:10] from you because it is also the most
[1:32:13] rewarding thing I think I could ever do
[1:32:15] in life to be trusted with the souls of
[1:32:19] men and people place their confidence
[1:32:21] and trust their families to you and and
[1:32:23] and and you see people delivered from
[1:32:25] sin and you see people lifted up on high
[1:32:28] you see the sick healed and you see the
[1:32:30] sinner turn to Saints oh there's nothing
[1:32:32] like it since a
[1:32:34] child I only ever wanted to do this you
[1:32:42] wouldn't you it but one of the sad areas
[1:32:45] of my ministry is that I've had parents
[1:32:49] who were so destructive to their
[1:32:54] children spiritually mentally
[1:33:00] emotionally far more than physically
[1:33:03] you'd be as a child physically we got
[1:33:05] jails for you but but what goes
[1:33:10] undiagnosed is the spiritual poisoning
[1:33:12] the emotional damage and I've had
[1:33:16] parents literally undo years of ministry
[1:33:21] work years of ministry labor behind this
[1:33:26] pulpit and every time you see me step
[1:33:30] into this pulpit for one hour it
[1:33:34] represents weeks of prayer and study and
[1:33:39] hours of burning midnight oil and up in
[1:33:42] the morning thing about it in the middle
[1:33:44] of the day and sitting in the bed late
[1:33:46] at night and you're fast asleep and it's
[1:33:48] 3:00 a.m. and I'm still making notes
[1:33:50] because I'm so inspired I can't go to
[1:33:52] sleep and because I'm a the son of Annie
[1:33:57] Watkins if even if I go to sleep at 3
[1:33:59] a.m. I still wake up by 6:30 7 o'clock
[1:34:02] at the latest if I'm in the bed at 8 I
[1:34:04] have so drastically overslept it's a
[1:34:06] Guinness Book of World Records and my
[1:34:11] body just wakes up when the room gets
[1:34:13] light even if I don't go to sleep till
[1:34:15] late and so I I've had times I've had
[1:34:19] young people that I know today who are
[1:34:22] teenagers who are young adults
[1:34:24] 20-somethings who are blown to
[1:34:26] smithereens think and and the parent was
[1:34:30] able to undo all of those years and
[1:34:32] hours and hours of study and preaching
[1:34:35] and praying and and and had them ready
[1:34:38] and had them going
[1:34:39] and then the parents flip out sometimes
[1:34:41] for just six eight twelve months and
[1:34:43] completely blow that child to kingdom
[1:34:46] come
[1:34:47] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:34:49] we don't want to be fuel delivery
[1:34:51] systems for the enemy I don't want to be
[1:34:54] a fuel transportation of the from this
[1:34:57] fallen world to you to my family to my
[1:35:00] grandchildren I wanna I want to give
[1:35:03] them the inoculation of the Holy Ghost I
[1:35:09] wonder if we realize that we can all be
[1:35:13] tools to spread the most infectious
[1:35:16] sicknesses of sin to those around us I
[1:35:19] wonder friends tonight have we given
[1:35:22] ample consideration I've I've showed you
[1:35:25] here the natural typing the spiritual
[1:35:28] listen that you say all the devil the
[1:35:31] devil has almost no power unless he can
[1:35:35] get a medium to work through how to say
[1:35:38] Lord God you know don't don't let my
[1:35:41] insincerity be the vehicle be the field
[1:35:45] delivery that's what's destroyed I've
[1:35:47] seen that's what's destroyed so many
[1:35:48] times young people undestroyed years of
[1:35:52] ministry be just by by by uh even
[1:35:56] sometimes a short span of time of a
[1:35:59] insincerity
[1:36:01] in the mom or dad or both that the child
[1:36:04] sees and and it's just long enough to
[1:36:07] set up a ruination that sometimes it can
[1:36:10] take god years to get that thing turned
[1:36:12] around and then they come back scarred
[1:36:15] up cut up needlessly unnecessarily I'm
[1:36:18] not I'm not here to try to project here
[1:36:20] that I was the perfect parent and I'm
[1:36:23] not here to project to you that it's
[1:36:25] always a parent's fault when a child
[1:36:26] goes astray I mean I had a man Eve had
[1:36:29] the best parent you could have God and
[1:36:31] they lived in a perfect paradise and
[1:36:33] they still back slit so I'm not I'm not
[1:36:35] saying I'm not here to heap blame I'm
[1:36:37] just saying where we stand today the
[1:36:40] world is falling apart and demon powers
[1:36:42] are streaming into the earth these are
[1:36:44] where the whole world is worried about a
[1:36:46] virus that affects
[1:36:48] the body and Jesus said don't even fear
[1:36:50] him who can destroy the body but fear
[1:36:53] that one who can destroy the soul in
[1:36:55] hell and everybody's worried about a
[1:36:57] virus that can hurt the body 1% fatality
[1:37:01] and their nerd they're unconcerned with
[1:37:03] a virus that is a hundred percent fatal
[1:37:08] 100 percent fatal reject God's
[1:37:12] inoculation and you fall victim to a
[1:37:16] virus you can't recover from and rich
[1:37:20] young ruler thought he could he thought
[1:37:22] his wealth would protect him he had by
[1:37:24] had so much he said I gotta tear down
[1:37:26] all my giant barns and build bigger
[1:37:28] barns he didn't notice the very large
[1:37:33] being standing behind him and the angel
[1:37:37] dust said you fool
[1:37:39] this is all you care about work money
[1:37:43] gain more work more money more gain you
[1:37:47] fool today you didn't wake up thinking
[1:37:52] this to you you woke up today like it
[1:37:55] was any other day little did you know
[1:37:58] you fool that today your soul is going
[1:38:02] to be required of you he had caught a
[1:38:06] virus that Jesus offered him a vaccine
[1:38:10] for him Jesus offered him an inoculation
[1:38:14] but he knew that if he got the
[1:38:16] inoculation it would change his whole
[1:38:18] life and he liked his life pretty good
[1:38:20] and it was all fine and it was all great
[1:38:24] until it wasn't and then the Bible says
[1:38:28] and in hell he lifted up his eyes and
[1:38:32] regret I want to tell you something
[1:38:37] friends stand stand with me
[1:38:48] Deb come to the piano just just come
[1:38:50] alone yeah we'll just play a song and go
[1:38:55] to prayer but I want you to realize
[1:38:57] friends today the world is running crazy
[1:39:03] over a bug that's a variant of a flu bug
[1:39:06] it's bringing down the world the fear as
[1:39:11] I said to you Sunday
[1:39:13] the fear is inexplicable the fear is non
[1:39:17] sensible it doesn't make sense that
[1:39:20] they're so afraid of this and and you
[1:39:24] say but thousands are gonna die every
[1:39:27] year almost 70,000 people die every year
[1:39:32] just from the flu 40 to 70 died last
[1:39:38] year 40 to 70 will die this year it
[1:39:41] doesn't matter
[1:39:42] Korona now tell my Corona taking them
[1:39:44] we're talking about just the common flu
[1:39:47] and before we even were at a hundred
[1:39:51] deaths the world was collapsing the only
[1:39:56] explanation as I said to you Sunday the
[1:39:58] only way to explain that is it's a
[1:40:00] modern event only explainable by
[1:40:03] prophecy that at the last days because
[1:40:06] that knowledge would increase men would
[1:40:09] run to and fro and increase their
[1:40:12] knowledge and knowledge would increase
[1:40:14] which means he's eating off the tree of
[1:40:16] knowledge and brother Branham said the
[1:40:18] more he eats the more death he gets and
[1:40:22] then and and now the and then the other
[1:40:25] prophecy that connects to that is in the
[1:40:27] last days men's hearts would fail them
[1:40:28] for fear because because in the in the
[1:40:32] days when they didn't have the knowledge
[1:40:34] like we showed in 1957 no one even knew
[1:40:38] 100,000 people died no one even knew it
[1:40:41] was going on and even people who didn't
[1:40:43] know what was going on they didn't care
[1:40:45] they didn't shut down schools and
[1:40:47] colleges and businesses and baseball and
[1:40:49] nobody was blaming Eisenhower and he
[1:40:52] wasn't making everyday announcements on
[1:40:54] the news you couldn't stay home and work
[1:40:56] from home it was 1957
[1:40:59] so this this 80 year old reporter I
[1:41:02] don't know if you all read that story I
[1:41:03] posted he just said so we just went to
[1:41:06] work and we just went okay well if I die
[1:41:08] I'd die he said you just lived with that
[1:41:11] death was they they weren't afraid of it
[1:41:13] why because Manhattan he hadn't eat so
[1:41:15] far on that tree of knowledge he hadn't
[1:41:18] come to the point where his heart would
[1:41:19] fail him for fear what you're seeing
[1:41:23] today man has destroyed himself and and
[1:41:27] as that and as that poem that that
[1:41:29] brother from Africa wrote said if one
[1:41:32] plague just one plague one virus has
[1:41:34] done all this what will you do when it's
[1:41:37] plague upon plague upon plague upon
[1:41:39] plague he said welcome to a dress
[1:41:41] rehearsal and the world can't handle the
[1:41:47] dress rehearsal of one virus they
[1:41:51] actually could but they're too afraid
[1:41:53] and their fear has infected them like a
[1:41:58] virus I want us tonight I want you to
[1:42:02] who are listening on the stream and you
[1:42:04] brothers here sister Deborah here
[1:42:07] tonight all of us here together want you
[1:42:09] to bow your heads with me and I want you
[1:42:11] to think about what you've heard what
[1:42:12] I've explained to you show you how the
[1:42:15] natural types the spiritual and showing
[1:42:18] it to you how we got to fall how we got
[1:42:20] fallen bodies how the devil works in in
[1:42:23] physical diseases how he infects the
[1:42:26] mind how unbelief comes in how families
[1:42:28] and people and marriages and children

[1:42:43] is an inoculation and this inoculation
[1:42:47] is good to get you home on and it
[1:42:52] doesn't it doesn't
[1:42:53] this inoculation doesn't take away your
[1:42:57] right to choose to burn the other fuel
[1:42:59] what this inoculation does is pass you
[1:43:03] from death to life so that you can never
[1:43:05] be lost but I'm not I'm not worried
[1:43:07] about being lost

[1:49:27] unspoken request we missed a prayer
[1:49:30] request last Wednesday from sister
[1:49:32] Elizabeth she says remembers Starr who

[1:49:42] results from biopsy let's pray for that
[1:49:44] need my wife sister Debbie sent in a
[1:49:48] request for her brother-in-law her
[1:49:51] sister's husband Greg needs to be on the
[1:49:54] prayer list tonight he has a sore throat
[1:49:56] so you can imagine what how that could
[1:49:59] grip someone and he's he's the one Greg
[1:50:03] and Karen they actually watch are
[1:50:05] probably watching right now I would
[1:50:06] imagine and he is the one who most often
[1:50:09] drives brother Richard my wife's dad to
[1:50:13] his dialysis I think three days a week
[1:50:16] and so he can't he can't be sick and
[1:50:20] then you understand how that's gonna
[1:50:21] complicate things so let's just pray
[1:50:24] whatever it is it's gone tonight a man
[1:50:27] so you'll be actually praying for
[1:50:29] brother Richard situation as you pray
[1:50:32] for Greg amen trusting the Lord you will
[1:50:37] do great things here don't have any
[1:50:42] other requests that I see let me just do
[1:50:44] one quick check here
[1:50:46] again this to remind you that if you
[1:50:48] have a prayer request send it to me
[1:50:51] whatsapp directly to my whatsapp because
[1:50:55] I can get it if you send it regular SMS
[1:50:58] but I might miss it I need everything
[1:51:00] coming to one place please and then even
[1:51:03] sometimes I still miss it so amen
[1:51:06] I know we're just a few brothers why
[1:51:08] don't you guys are coming up here and
[1:51:09] stand to stand up here and just stay
[1:51:13] spread out a little bit so we can follow
[1:51:16] the guidelines man Chris move on over
[1:51:19] just a little bit son brother Luther
[1:51:21] come on up in here we're not living in
[1:51:23] fear but we're just trying to respect
[1:51:25] our fellow community if they would if
[1:51:28] they would ask us we can say no we're
[1:51:31] following the guidelines we're trying to
[1:51:33] be careful we've even got some plans if
[1:51:36] this should go long-term and it might by
[1:51:38] the way they're talking now this thing
[1:51:40] could get much worse it absolutely could
[1:51:42] get much worse in the next couple of
[1:51:44] weeks because what we're seeing now is
[1:51:46] worse than last week and what we're
[1:51:48] seeing now is what was happening two
[1:51:50] weeks ago so now they're saying it could
[1:51:52] escalate again based on that the next
[1:51:55] week or two so we don't know France I
[1:51:57] just know who knows every I know the one
[1:51:59] who knows everything as we said Sunday I
[1:52:02] I don't we don't even know what all we
[1:52:03] don't even know so I just decided well
[1:52:06] then I'm just gonna make sure I know the
[1:52:08] one who knows it all so we're not in
[1:52:11] fear at all we lift up our head we're
[1:52:14] trusting the Lord for our safety but we
[1:52:18] do want to respect what they're asking
[1:52:21] of us and so you know we'll we'll we'll
[1:52:24] practice some distancing and you know
[1:52:27] that way if you're asked you can give a
[1:52:28] testimony I would say that you brothers
[1:52:30] just fist bump or elbow touch don't even
[1:52:34] shake hands and don't embrace because
[1:52:36] it's all about our testimony all right
[1:52:38] so let's just go ahead and dispense with
[1:52:40] the awkwardness of do i do idon't know
[1:52:42] let's just not okay let's just distance
[1:52:45] as far as we can and and keep us keep us
[1:52:49] safe we don't know the Lord may protect
[1:52:50] all of his bride from this but we don't
[1:52:52] know that I could get the flu I've had
[1:52:53] the flu so I don't know I don't care I'm
[1:52:56] not worried about what the devil is
[1:52:57] doing amen I just don't

[1:53:01] nobody you have no decision power in my
[1:53:03] life that all comes from my father a man
[1:53:06] I don't consult the devil as brother
[1:53:07] Abraham taught me that years ago we do
[1:53:09] not live by the mercies of Lucifer done
[1:53:12] I live by the mercies of Jesus Christ
[1:53:16] and I want the world and Lucifer to know
[1:53:18] and that's who my hope is built on

[1:57:49] the world's crazy drivers are crazy
[1:57:51] I don't not sure what was happening with
[1:57:53] this particular genre but I told my wife
[1:57:54] I was just was two days ago just driving
[1:57:57] along headed to the bank I think and
[1:57:59] then back to my house now thinking about
[1:58:00] much listening to some music just really
[1:58:03] kind of praying in my mind actually as
[1:58:06] we were driving along and I kind of just
[1:58:08] looked out the window and as I turned to
[1:58:09] look up a semi-truck without his rig but
[1:58:12] just the big truck portion was two tires
[1:58:15] into the middle lane and probably 15
[1:58:17] feet from me and I didn't my eyes got I
[1:58:20] didn't really know you kind of freeze in
[1:58:21] that moment I kind of started to veer to
[1:58:23] the right and it was almost like an
[1:58:24] angel just pushed this car because it
[1:58:26] came and just went and just correct it
[1:58:28] at the last second I thought man well
[1:58:30] that was that was that was a man praise
[1:58:37] him or a man praise God
[1:58:42] just you know I got attacked on Sunday I
[1:58:45] was like when I got home from church I

[1:58:55] count and I just texted for the Jason I
[1:58:58] just said Ben I don't feel well at all
[1:59:00] and I got sick about three o'clock and
[1:59:03] then I was just
[1:59:08] just sitting on the couch and waiting
[1:59:10] about seven o'clock I started feeling
[1:59:12] normal I had a little bit of a headache
[1:59:14] I just rested up a little bit on Monday

[2:00:39] tempreture and when nobody else in her
[2:00:42] whole family was going to church she
