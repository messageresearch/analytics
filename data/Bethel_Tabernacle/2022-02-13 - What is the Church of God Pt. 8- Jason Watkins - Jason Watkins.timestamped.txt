[43:27] you know i um we're gonna go to
[43:29] ephesians chapter two
[43:31] and
[43:32] this morning the lord
[43:34] woke me up a little earlier than normal
[43:36] i'm usually up around five and i like to
[43:39] be in my what i call my 5 30 chair get
[43:42] up get ready get myself oriented get in
[43:44] my chair and begin to talk to the lord i
[43:46] try to do that every day of my life
[43:49] and uh the lord woke me up a little bit
[43:51] earlier today
[43:52] and uh and i i felt pretty tired and so
[43:55] i felt myself drifting back off for just
[43:57] a little bit
[43:59] and lo and behold like like like i got
[44:02] hit by a thunderbolt something jarred me
[44:04] and said get up
[44:06] and i said okay lord i'm getting up and
[44:08] said well i'm thinking what's the rush
[44:11] and literally friends the spirit of god
[44:13] moved on me and said
[44:15] there are i'm here to answer prayer
[44:18] there were brothers praying for this
[44:19] service today now get up i want to speak
[44:22] to you in my word
[44:24] so you brothers who are meeting on
[44:26] saturdays to pray for this service let
[44:27] me tell you it's not going unnoticed
[44:30] by the lord and so
[44:32] and i went in and found it so the lord
[44:34] just began to i even was not even able i
[44:37] thought about might put a powerpoint
[44:39] together i wasn't able because the lord
[44:41] freshened up my notes to such a degree
[44:44] that i just haven't had time to do it
[44:46] and probably that's best
[44:48] so it'll it'll keep me uh in in the
[44:51] proper channel without getting
[44:52] sidetracked by a presentation
[44:55] i use them sometimes but i just don't
[44:57] really want to do it today
[44:59] ephesians chapter two
[45:04] verse 11 now
[45:06] we want to we we're taking our
[45:09] our eighth and what maybe uh i don't
[45:12] know that's always subject to the lord
[45:14] but it looks like this if i can finish
[45:16] it today it'll finish up my series on
[45:19] what is the church of god
[45:21] and
[45:23] and i
[45:24] i want to take as a subtitle today
[45:27] kingdom citizens
[45:30] amen kingdom citizens ephesians
[45:32] chapter 2 paul
[45:34] showing here that we are no longer
[45:36] strangers isn't that wonderful we're no
[45:38] longer strangers from the economy of god
[45:41] we've been brought into something
[45:42] friends let's look and see what it is
[45:44] verse 11. wherefore remember
[45:47] that ye being in time past gentiles
[45:50] in the flesh let me catch my place here
[45:53] um
[45:54] in the flesh who are called
[45:56] uncircumcision
[45:59] by that which is called the circumcision
[46:01] in the flesh made by hands
[46:03] that at that time ye were without christ
[46:06] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[46:09] israel
[46:10] and strangers from the covenants of
[46:12] promise a pretty dire situation what you
[46:14] agree having no hope my and without god
[46:18] in the world i don't think you could
[46:20] have a worse situation see
[46:24] but now
[46:25] in christ jesus
[46:27] ye who sometimes were far off are made
[46:30] nigh by the blood of christ
[46:33] for he is our peace
[46:35] who hath made both one and hath broken
[46:38] down the middle wall of partition
[46:39] between us
[46:41] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[46:44] even the law of commandments contained
[46:47] in ordinances
[46:48] for to make in himself catch it for to
[46:51] make in himself of twain
[46:54] one new man so making peace
[46:57] and that he might reconcile both unto
[47:00] god in one body by the cross having
[47:04] slain the enmity thereby
[47:06] and came and preached peace to you which
[47:10] were far off and to them that were nigh
[47:13] for through him we both have access by
[47:17] one spirit unto the father in that
[47:19] glorious
[47:21] now therefore having said everything
[47:23] i've just said now that you understand
[47:25] all of that
[47:26] now therefore here's what i want you to
[47:28] get
[47:29] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[47:32] but fellow citizens
[47:35] with the saints and of the household of
[47:38] god can you say amen to that so i am of
[47:41] the household of god
[47:44] and there's more but wait there's more
[47:47] and are built upon the foundation of the
[47:50] apostles and prophets
[47:52] jesus christ himself being the chief
[47:55] cornerstone
[47:57] in whom all the building fitly framed
[48:00] together groweth unto an holy temple in
[48:03] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[48:07] together for an habitation of god
[48:10] through the spirit
[48:12] my it's wonderful to be fellow citizens
[48:15] isn't it
[48:16] my we were foreigners but now we are
[48:19] fellow citizens with the saints
[48:22] and of the household
[48:24] of god you share the table with abraham
[48:27] you share the table with moses
[48:29] you share the table with the apostles in
[48:31] that glorious
[48:33] amen
[48:34] may the lord add blessing to the reading
[48:36] of his word you can be seated
[48:52] you know it's a it would be a fair
[48:54] question
[48:56] you know to ask why i've
[48:58] continued preaching on this series which
[49:00] now today will make eight full parts
[49:03] um
[49:04] on this series what is the church it's a
[49:08] fair question and
[49:10] and you know i
[49:12] i can only express to you what i
[49:14] expressed at the beginning of the series
[49:16] that
[49:17] you know when i looked at paul
[49:21] addressing each church in his letters
[49:25] we find that he would
[49:27] in every other church he would say
[49:29] things such as
[49:31] paul to the church
[49:33] to the saints that be or paul to those
[49:37] chosen or this this one and that but we
[49:39] find that in his letter to the
[49:41] corinthian church in fact his both times
[49:44] in his first letter and his second
[49:45] letter
[49:46] he emphasizes to the church of god at
[49:50] corinth
[49:51] and now i i you know there there was
[49:53] some natural affection paul considered
[49:56] the church at corinth his children
[49:59] somewhat above measure you can read it
[50:01] in his language and the way he talks to
[50:02] them he actually says that to them
[50:04] and so they were very dear and near to
[50:08] his heart
[50:09] and they were at times a troubled church
[50:12] and i think that paul was trying to
[50:15] get them to understand
[50:17] who they were
[50:18] and i think that that that in the
[50:20] knowing of who you are then that can
[50:23] inform your thinking on on on the
[50:26] responsibility that god is looking to
[50:29] for you to have that for you to bear and
[50:31] for you to say i will willingly take on
[50:33] this charge the apostle has said we are
[50:36] the church of god well that ought to
[50:37] mean something
[50:40] that ought to have uh an effect and it
[50:43] ought to effect
[50:45] change in our lives
[50:46] and this is where even brother branham
[50:48] talks about
[50:49] um you know when the bride can recognize
[50:52] who she is and in that recognition
[50:56] and it's not just hearing about it but
[50:59] it's you
[51:00] saying amen to it
[51:02] it's you it's it's a coming to terms
[51:05] with the fact that
[51:07] god chose you
[51:09] and put you here for a purpose
[51:11] and you're not going to get out of it
[51:16] as you've heard me say many times you're
[51:18] going in the rapture and there's nothing
[51:20] you can do about it
[51:24] god placed you here
[51:26] with a purpose with a plan
[51:29] and he wants you to clearly identify who
[51:32] you are because then that that can then
[51:35] make you feel the weight of you know
[51:37] brother branham tells the story from
[51:39] back in the slavery days
[51:41] how that here was one
[51:44] slave they didn't have to uh
[51:46] beat at all didn't whip him at all
[51:49] because he conducted himself knowing
[51:52] that he was the son of a king back home
[51:55] and though a prisoner though an alien
[51:58] though he had no hope of ever returning
[52:01] back to his home he still conducted
[52:03] himself in this world as a son of a king
[52:07] and so brother branham talks about the
[52:09] value of you realizing who your father
[52:13] is
[52:15] and what he has called on you brother
[52:18] branham makes a statement in why little
[52:20] bethlehem
[52:21] he says you know leaders sometimes go
[52:25] through things that the congregation
[52:27] don't know what they're going through
[52:30] when you and then he gives a little bit
[52:32] of insight and boy how i can relate to
[52:34] this when you think of promises god has
[52:37] made and then why don't it come to pass
[52:40] and
[52:41] they don't tell the congregation they
[52:42] don't tell the people they associate
[52:44] with but there's many
[52:47] flusterations
[52:48] in the heart of a real leader
[52:51] and you know i
[52:53] why have i been preaching on this
[52:56] series
[52:57] what is the church of god and i keep
[53:00] telling you and i keep insisting to you
[53:03] that you're part of part of a kingdom
[53:07] all right and it's in it's important to
[53:09] me that you that you understand that and
[53:12] so why have i stayed on it so long
[53:15] because i want you to see
[53:18] uh i i i i want to see
[53:21] and i want you to experience
[53:24] bondage
[53:25] broken from your life
[53:27] i want you to enjoy
[53:29] the glorious liberty that that day on
[53:33] calvary has provided
[53:35] now i can provide it all day long but if
[53:37] you never become a part-taker remember
[53:40] you say well i thought i'm a i thought
[53:42] i'm an heir of god you are an heir of
[53:44] god you came from god from the genes of
[53:46] god election is always origin but but
[53:49] paul talks about if you're only an heir
[53:51] you don't yet have an allotment see
[53:54] you're an heir of god but that that
[53:56] means that you there there
[53:58] there is an allotment but you don't have
[54:01] any part in it as an heir of god but
[54:03] when you become a joint heir
[54:06] with christ then now not only is there
[54:09] an allotment for you but you are
[54:11] actually partaking of that allotment
[54:14] just as jesus is reaching into the
[54:16] treasure chest of the father and pulling
[54:19] out every redemptive blessing you're
[54:21] standing right beside him reaching into
[54:23] the same treasure chest
[54:25] this is the meaning of being heirs of
[54:27] god in joint heirs with christ it's not
[54:30] a redundant statement don't ever think
[54:32] of it like that
[54:33] and so i want to see bondage broken in
[54:36] our lives i want to see sins grip on our
[54:39] lives broken how many want that see we
[54:41] want it in our marriages we want it in
[54:43] our homes wanting our children we're not
[54:45] here this isn't a social gospel
[54:48] our church isn't here we're not looking
[54:50] to just renovate a building and expand
[54:52] it out just to seat more people
[54:54] that that it would it would only take a
[54:57] few people see to bring the power of god
[55:00] it only takes two or three even and he's
[55:02] in the midst so what we're looking for
[55:05] is to have him in the midst
[55:07] however many or few there be i want him
[55:09] in the midst i want him to be glorified
[55:13] that's why we preach
[55:16] we're not here to lift up humans we're
[55:18] here to lift up god here to lift up
[55:21] christ
[55:22] and god sends forth his saints into the
[55:24] earth he sends forth his apostles and
[55:27] his prophets
[55:28] and we are built on the foundation that
[55:30] they have laid and you can't change the
[55:32] foundation once the apostles and
[55:35] prophets laid that foundation there's no
[55:37] room for another gospel see
[55:40] any restoration that is claimed as a
[55:43] restoration has to go back and reflect
[55:47] the original foundation
[55:49] and that's how you know if you've
[55:51] deviated off of it because it disagrees
[55:54] and when it disagrees then jesus christ
[55:57] is not able to be to demonstrate himself
[56:01] as the same yesterday and forever now he
[56:02] is but he can't demonstrate that in you
[56:05] because you're outside of the line in
[56:07] order of his word the whole purpose of
[56:09] being in the line and order of god's
[56:12] word is so that god can get behind your
[56:14] life so that god can get behind your
[56:16] word so that god can be an enforcer of
[56:19] your prayers
[56:21] as long as we have that understanding
[56:25] then the world can never
[56:27] successfully
[56:29] argue
[56:30] that he's not the same yesterday today
[56:32] and forever
[56:33] your life of obedience and surrender
[56:36] proves to the world that he is
[56:38] see
[56:39] and then the supernatural moves among us
[56:43] you know we can't help but believe
[56:46] unorthodox things
[56:49] you know uh when john came
[56:52] for running the lord jesus and
[56:54] john had a lot of unorthodox things to
[56:57] say and it caused the spiritual
[57:00] religious leadership of that hour to
[57:02] reject john they never did receive him
[57:04] as the elijah prophet that jesus said he
[57:06] was
[57:09] and we find that they didn't
[57:11] receive jesus
[57:13] as the person he claimed to be
[57:15] and he made no bones about it he claimed
[57:16] to be the son of god and so
[57:18] we we realized then that
[57:21] that he that every time a messenger
[57:24] comes from god to the earth
[57:26] then he's always going to bring
[57:29] unorthodox you know things that are
[57:31] unorthodox to what
[57:33] man-made theology
[57:35] you know uh
[57:36] has turned uh has turned the word into
[57:40] man-made theology turns this into
[57:42] something different than it actually is
[57:44] and so when god brings forth a messenger
[57:47] quite naturally that messenger is going
[57:49] to seem and appear unorthodox but he's
[57:53] literally there to bring god's family
[57:56] back to the faith of the original seed
[57:59] which then which then exposes that is
[58:01] not unorthodox he's original
[58:04] see
[58:05] he's bringing the original seed and and
[58:08] sometimes this this can bring you know
[58:10] uh trauma and brother branham talks
[58:13] about how that when a seal is open and a
[58:15] trumpet sounds and it declares a war
[58:17] see a spiritual war every time god
[58:21] reveals something out of his word
[58:23] it's a it's a trumpet
[58:25] when a revelation comes forth it's a
[58:26] trumpet coming trumpet from god now
[58:28] don't confuse it well there's various
[58:31] ways we can talk about the trumpets in
[58:32] the in the book of revelation but any
[58:35] time a revelation of the word comes
[58:37] that's that's a trumpet and it's god
[58:39] declaring a word and that starts a war
[58:42] starts a spiritual war and this causes
[58:44] pressure
[58:46] and and discomfort you know in the world
[58:48] and it even may say
[58:50] it even causes sometimes pressure and
[58:52] discomfort even to god's true family
[58:56] see because it always makes you appear
[58:59] unorthodox or
[59:01] unnormal if i could say it that way to
[59:04] the world
[59:05] in the age
[59:06] that you live in
[59:08] because it changes everything about you
[59:10] you're no longer you don't any longer go
[59:13] with the flow
[59:15] you're now considered unorthodox and and
[59:18] there they'll base their rejection on
[59:20] you of you based simply on the fact that
[59:23] you're not according to tradition
[59:26] even though that jesus warned that it
[59:29] was tradition that caused the blindness
[59:31] see and so so we realize that a lot of
[59:34] times it it makes our lives change and
[59:37] and people don't understand us and even
[59:39] our language changes your declarations
[59:42] begin to change and uh
[59:44] and a cry you know because a a a cry
[59:48] wells up within you to identify and and
[59:52] to correct the error of the day and it's
[59:54] not just in preachers it's in everybody
[59:56] that's a believer
[59:57] there comes an inability to just to just
[1:00:01] some
[1:00:02] at all times just remain silent you know
[1:00:05] there there's a there's a restoring word
[1:00:08] has come and you you can't be silent
[1:00:11] see
[1:00:12] and sometimes you
[1:00:14] you estranged friends and your estranged
[1:00:17] fellow workers and even sometimes your
[1:00:20] family members become strange to you
[1:00:23] you don't do it for that reason
[1:00:25] that's not why you do it that's never in
[1:00:28] the heart of a humble child of god
[1:00:31] see it's not about that see
[1:00:34] but but but but the word
[1:00:38] must declare itself
[1:00:41] and if i'm part of the word then i can
[1:00:43] no longer i'm sorry to my friends to my
[1:00:46] work associates to my family members who
[1:00:49] knew me when i was in sin i can no
[1:00:52] longer be that person
[1:00:54] and who i am now may make you
[1:00:56] uncomfortable but i can i cannot refuse
[1:01:00] to be this way it is now my
[1:01:02] all-consuming life
[1:01:07] brother branham referred to himself as
[1:01:09] the most misunderstood person in the
[1:01:11] world
[1:01:13] he says people misunderstand me he said
[1:01:15] they
[1:01:16] he said everybody thinks that you know
[1:01:18] that that i'm that i'm against everybody
[1:01:21] and brother branham says if they only
[1:01:23] knew i'm for everybody
[1:01:26] there's a man who loved people he said
[1:01:27] but i i got a message to giving he said
[1:01:30] i got to be honest with the world he
[1:01:33] said god put a message upon me and
[1:01:35] brother branham as a human being said i
[1:01:37] wish it wasn't mine
[1:01:40] i said i wish it wasn't mine
[1:01:42] he had i mean here's a man who'd already
[1:01:44] suffered horrible rejection as a young
[1:01:45] man
[1:01:46] god he you know rejected trying to get
[1:01:48] the love and approval of his dad
[1:01:51] got rejected as a
[1:01:53] you know god got rejected on the streets
[1:01:55] as a young man
[1:01:56] and and see people coming down the
[1:01:59] street and see him coming and cross the
[1:02:01] road because his family had a bad name
[1:02:05] and brother brandon would say well i
[1:02:06] never did those things but yet they
[1:02:08] would do that anyway said i could walk
[1:02:10] up to somebody on the street as long as
[1:02:12] nobody was around and say hey so and so
[1:02:14] how's the fishing oh billy the bluegills
[1:02:16] are biting down man oh yeah we and he
[1:02:17] said all of a sudden somebody walk up
[1:02:19] and they turn around like they don't
[1:02:20] even know me
[1:02:21] see
[1:02:22] and and and here's a man who who you
[1:02:25] know was was
[1:02:27] acknowledged by historians by uh
[1:02:30] religious historians the world over uh
[1:02:32] in fact there's there's no there's no
[1:02:34] history that that even says anything
[1:02:36] different than this that he was
[1:02:38] absolutely the tip of the spear he
[1:02:40] spearheaded the great revivals that he
[1:02:42] was the most prominent among them all
[1:02:45] and there is numerous
[1:02:47] history is replete with the testimonies
[1:02:50] of men who lived in that era which then
[1:02:52] completely invalidates people today more
[1:02:55] than half a century later trying to say
[1:02:57] otherwise
[1:02:58] and and i've never figured out which is
[1:03:00] dumber their claim or them trying to get
[1:03:02] me to believe their claim
[1:03:04] because i'm i'm a historian by nature
[1:03:06] i'm a student of history and when i go
[1:03:08] back and i look at the actual history
[1:03:10] how could i come to any other conclusion
[1:03:12] than that he was a sincere godly man who
[1:03:14] loved the lord and had the respect of
[1:03:16] many people
[1:03:18] and the supernatural is
[1:03:20] is is too too too much too large as i
[1:03:23] was in my bible study uh online this
[1:03:26] morning uh
[1:03:28] and and i was making that point now
[1:03:30] where brother branham tells the story so
[1:03:31] many times maybe a dozen or so times
[1:03:33] about the man who come to him he tells
[1:03:35] it again in the seventh seal said a man
[1:03:37] comes said i don't believe in divine
[1:03:39] healing there's no such a thing as that
[1:03:41] he said i don't believe in your divine
[1:03:42] healing and brother brown said mine well
[1:03:44] i don't have any
[1:03:46] oh so you're doing good not to believe
[1:03:48] in mine he said he says but god's is
[1:03:50] perfect he said there's no such a thing
[1:03:52] and he said you're too late to tell me
[1:03:53] that buddy
[1:03:54] you're too late buddy no he said you
[1:03:56] might have come back in another age
[1:03:58] years ago and said that there's too many
[1:03:59] thousands of people now
[1:04:01] you're way too late he said i don't care
[1:04:03] i don't care what sign you could believe
[1:04:06] well that you could show me i don't care
[1:04:08] what demonstration i won't believe it
[1:04:10] and brother brennan said certainly not
[1:04:11] it's not foreign believers
[1:04:13] it's only for believers
[1:04:15] see
[1:04:16] and so it comes to be believed if you
[1:04:18] don't believe it and you reject it then
[1:04:19] god will just let you go off into your
[1:04:21] blindness and and that's that then that
[1:04:24] creates the very sad reality of people
[1:04:27] in this hour who are who are blind
[1:04:28] according to the bible they're blind in
[1:04:30] this age and brother branham says that's
[1:04:32] the sad part is that here they are
[1:04:35] naked and and and poor and they're
[1:04:38] wretched
[1:04:39] and they're miserable but you can't tell
[1:04:42] them because they're blind
[1:04:44] now it's not a blindness of of no sight
[1:04:48] because it'd be easy to convince a man
[1:04:51] who has no sight he's blind
[1:04:53] sir you're blind yeah you're kidding
[1:04:55] really
[1:04:56] but but the problem is
[1:04:58] is like the pharisees when jesus talks
[1:05:01] about that blindness and they said are
[1:05:02] we blind also and jesus said well you
[1:05:04] know if you were then you'd have
[1:05:06] somewhat to stand on but since you say
[1:05:08] you see
[1:05:10] then your sin remains
[1:05:11] so it's not it's not like they don't
[1:05:13] have an image it's that the god of this
[1:05:15] evil age has blinded them with the wrong
[1:05:18] image
[1:05:19] and they're looking at what they think
[1:05:21] is god and they think it's his word and
[1:05:23] it's not
[1:05:26] and god doesn't stand behind it and god
[1:05:28] doesn't vindicate it but none of that
[1:05:30] moves him because they're blinded by
[1:05:32] tradition
[1:05:34] and they that's the that's the desperate
[1:05:36] place to ever get to don't ever set a
[1:05:40] pattern in your life
[1:05:42] you know of of doubting god
[1:05:45] whatever you do even if you can't
[1:05:47] understand it go away and say amen just
[1:05:50] believe it anyways
[1:05:52] listen friends your faith must go past
[1:05:55] your understanding
[1:05:57] your faith i'm gonna say it again has
[1:05:58] got to go beyond your understanding
[1:06:02] to believe that even if i don't
[1:06:04] understand it well then how do you know
[1:06:06] it's true because i know god and i know
[1:06:08] that's his word and i i don't understand
[1:06:10] how it is why it is how to happen what
[1:06:12] will happen i just know he's in control
[1:06:16] and i i will never disbelieve him i'll
[1:06:19] never disbelieve him
[1:06:22] and it causes us sometimes and you don't
[1:06:24] want to shy away from that i know it can
[1:06:26] cause pressure sometimes
[1:06:28] but you know that's not the motive of
[1:06:30] our heart the motive of our heart is
[1:06:32] always to enlighten those and to try
[1:06:35] through love
[1:06:38] to persuade them and becoming all things
[1:06:41] to all men paul said if i might win some
[1:06:44] and
[1:06:44] and you know it's it's there's almost no
[1:06:47] degree sometimes even even sometimes
[1:06:50] pastors brother makes this statement i'm
[1:06:51] glad he said it because i wouldn't had
[1:06:53] the guts to say it but he said sometimes
[1:06:55] a pastor will even
[1:06:57] he's trying to catch a young person and
[1:06:59] he'll wait out a little bit and people
[1:07:01] look at him and go whoa
[1:07:03] he's really kind of getting a little
[1:07:04] carnal there almost looks like he's
[1:07:06] gonna move into sin with him he said but
[1:07:08] he's he's just trying to grab ahold of
[1:07:09] him and pull him back to shore
[1:07:12] see
[1:07:13] i'm not here to tell you what that looks
[1:07:14] like when it happens but it happens
[1:07:17] amen and so you know as as i as i read
[1:07:20] the quote in the beginning pastors don't
[1:07:22] always
[1:07:23] tell even their associates and they
[1:07:25] don't they don't tell the church but
[1:07:26] things weigh on their heart you know you
[1:07:29] preach the word of god and you know this
[1:07:30] person loves the lord you can sense it
[1:07:32] you get around them you discern their
[1:07:34] spirit they love god they really believe
[1:07:36] it they really are they really truly are
[1:07:38] a believer
[1:07:39] but then why why can't they seem to get
[1:07:41] past the carnality of their life why
[1:07:43] can't they seem to get more serious and
[1:07:45] mature with god see and these things
[1:07:48] trouble your heart and all you can do is
[1:07:50] just come out here to this pulpit
[1:07:52] every week every opportunity you get and
[1:07:54] just declare it again and declare it
[1:07:56] again and declare it again and live it
[1:07:58] and live it and live it and declare it
[1:07:59] and live it and declare it and live it
[1:08:02] see it's not it's not up to me to follow
[1:08:05] you around or to walk up and down the
[1:08:07] aisle with a billy club that's not
[1:08:09] that's not that's not how we win the
[1:08:11] lost see
[1:08:13] and so god has to god has to do it
[1:08:17] and so you know
[1:08:19] when you see this kind of thing you can
[1:08:21] see it in the scripture john comes along
[1:08:23] i mean you know in in matthew 3 7 uh um
[1:08:27] zoey are you running the board oh okay
[1:08:30] awesome honey give me uh this is weird
[1:08:33] like
[1:08:34] somebody needs a haircut oh it's zoey
[1:08:38] yeah
[1:08:40] see a pastor's mind thinks too fast
[1:08:42] sometimes
[1:08:44] about let some young boy have it
[1:08:45] [Music]
[1:08:47] it's too pretty to be a boy you know
[1:08:49] okay
[1:08:51] so matthew chapter 3 verse 7 sweetie
[1:08:54] thank you you're awesome
[1:08:56] for those of you on camera that's my
[1:08:57] granddaughter don't i mean that's why
[1:08:59] i'm calling her those pet names so
[1:09:02] so we find here but when he saw him this
[1:09:04] is john when he saw
[1:09:07] many of the pharisees and sadducees all
[1:09:10] these denominational preachers
[1:09:13] come
[1:09:15] to come to his baptism and he said unto
[1:09:17] them
[1:09:18] old generation of vipers
[1:09:21] you talk about unorthodox
[1:09:23] old generation of vipers who hath warned
[1:09:25] you to flee
[1:09:27] from the wrath to come now there there
[1:09:29] are you can go into the old testament
[1:09:31] and you can find some indirect
[1:09:32] references to individuals you know like
[1:09:35] this you know in in three or four places
[1:09:38] not really direct but but but but this
[1:09:41] but certainly certainly
[1:09:43] this is unorthodox in the sense that
[1:09:46] this is the first time that term
[1:09:49] has ever come to be attributed to an
[1:09:51] entire generation
[1:09:54] even in the old testament when it talks
[1:09:56] about you know in a kind of an indirect
[1:09:58] way of serpents and vipers and different
[1:10:00] things but now john is coming forth to
[1:10:03] to literally pull from fragment fragment
[1:10:07] pieces and john is going to now
[1:10:09] introduce a whole new concept to say i'm
[1:10:12] here to tell you you're just uh you're
[1:10:14] just a generation
[1:10:17] of vipers
[1:10:19] this is where you are it's not just a a
[1:10:21] handful of ungodly teachers your whole
[1:10:24] generation is in need of a wholesale uh
[1:10:28] reconstruction and that made john
[1:10:31] unorthodoxy
[1:10:33] and then and of course now
[1:10:35] you you remember
[1:10:37] that remember and i'm going to read it
[1:10:39] here in a minute or or i might i might
[1:10:41] not but
[1:10:42] remember that god has one goal remember
[1:10:45] that it's all about expression
[1:10:48] so
[1:10:48] you know we showed you that i think last
[1:10:51] time where
[1:10:53] when you go into the book of revelation
[1:10:54] and you find him coming
[1:10:57] you know in chapter 12 when
[1:11:00] the bride goes up and satan is cast down
[1:11:02] and then now the kingdom of heaven has
[1:11:04] only has god's family there and it says
[1:11:07] you know the the kingdoms have it's now
[1:11:09] the kingdom of of god and his christ so
[1:11:13] the father and and the and the son and
[1:11:15] now the family is there
[1:11:17] and then that's at the very beginning of
[1:11:19] the tribulation but it's not the
[1:11:20] language is gonna uh progress it's not
[1:11:24] gonna alter anything that's established
[1:11:26] but it's going to progress because by
[1:11:28] the time you get to the end of the
[1:11:29] tribulation and now the millennium
[1:11:31] starts to sweep in now the language
[1:11:33] becomes it's now the kingdoms of this
[1:11:36] world have become the kingdoms of our
[1:11:38] lord jesus and his christ his bride mrs
[1:11:43] jesus christ yes see
[1:11:45] so and by the time you get over to
[1:11:47] chapter 22 you've literally got the
[1:11:48] bride in christ speaking in the unified
[1:11:50] voice the spirit and the bride say
[1:11:54] see so so you you always want to look
[1:11:56] and you're seeing that here when you go
[1:11:58] let's get matthew 12
[1:12:00] z when you get to matthew 12 34 now
[1:12:03] you're gonna see jesus people have
[1:12:05] people have a hard time why do you
[1:12:06] always quote william branham because he
[1:12:08] was elijah prophet well that's
[1:12:10] unprecedented oh really
[1:12:12] let's look and see if jesus what jesus
[1:12:14] does with it matthew 12 34 old
[1:12:16] generation of vipers how can ye be evil
[1:12:19] speak good things for out of the
[1:12:20] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:12:21] speaketh now you've got jesus quoting
[1:12:23] his prophet
[1:12:25] and when the prophet said it it was
[1:12:26] unorthodox when the prophet said it was
[1:12:28] unfounded you couldn't find that kind of
[1:12:30] a connotation in the old testament but
[1:12:32] john was a messenger of the covenant and
[1:12:35] he comes to bring this and as soon as he
[1:12:37] says it now it becomes the word and now
[1:12:39] jesus starts quoting it
[1:12:42] see you see the progression
[1:12:45] see
[1:12:46] so so when we when we look at this we
[1:12:49] can see that
[1:12:50] there is a perfect and a proper
[1:12:53] furtherance in expression
[1:12:55] as jesus begins to
[1:12:57] pick up this new scriptural lingo
[1:13:01] matthew 23 33 zoe matthew 23 33 you
[1:13:06] serpents
[1:13:08] your generation of vipers matter double
[1:13:10] snakes
[1:13:11] your serpents individuals
[1:13:13] your generation of vipers
[1:13:16] how can ye escape the damnation of hell
[1:13:20] see
[1:13:21] and that that this is what
[1:13:23] rankled the pharisees and sadducees this
[1:13:26] is what this is why when he's there in
[1:13:28] the temple teaching about you know
[1:13:29] you're full of dead men's bones and men
[1:13:31] walk over your graves they don't even
[1:13:33] know there's walking over over a
[1:13:35] cemetery
[1:13:36] or you're blind and leaders of the blind
[1:13:38] or are we blind also well if you were
[1:13:40] then you'd have somewhat to say but
[1:13:42] because you you declare you make a
[1:13:45] declaration that you that you're the
[1:13:47] voice of god well then prove it
[1:13:50] prove it as elijah said let the god who
[1:13:53] answers by fire be god
[1:13:55] see and so let god demonstrate so so
[1:13:58] when we when we come if you look at john
[1:14:01] and this elijah prophet now it's
[1:14:02] interesting because
[1:14:04] the old testament doesn't declare john
[1:14:06] to be elijah and in fact is when john's
[1:14:08] asked about it he denies it flatly
[1:14:10] and you don't even get a clue that he
[1:14:12] was until jesus mentions it see in in i
[1:14:17] listen to isaiah 40 and 3 isaiah 40 and
[1:14:19] 3
[1:14:20] the voice of him that crieth in the
[1:14:22] wilderness
[1:14:23] prepare you the way of the lord
[1:14:26] make straight in the desert a highway
[1:14:28] for our god see
[1:14:30] so
[1:14:32] so this is
[1:14:33] now
[1:14:34] historically speaking
[1:14:36] the application is
[1:14:37] israel is going to return from their 70
[1:14:39] years captivity
[1:14:41] and so
[1:14:42] that when you study the hebrew on this
[1:14:44] third verse in chapter 40 of isaiah it's
[1:14:46] it's it's it's as if it's referring to
[1:14:49] you know highway construction workers
[1:14:52] who are who are called on go back
[1:14:54] rebuild the temple rebuild the walls and
[1:14:57] and and and clear the way in the desert
[1:15:00] for the return of the lord you exiles go
[1:15:03] back and get things ready the messiah is
[1:15:05] coming
[1:15:06] see
[1:15:07] and so
[1:15:08] so then so you know they're they're
[1:15:09] returning from uh returned uh you know
[1:15:12] to judah from babylonian captivity in
[1:15:15] 537 bc so it was it was the announcement
[1:15:18] of a kingdom coming and there needs to
[1:15:20] be someone in the desert
[1:15:23] getting things ready
[1:15:25] so when they asked john now there's a
[1:15:27] connotation between jesus and john and
[1:15:30] he's going to identify this that isaiah
[1:15:33] 40 and 3 has a connotation to john
[1:15:36] because he's here to prepare
[1:15:38] the way when you go to malachi 3 1.
[1:15:41] see
[1:15:43] behold i will send my messenger
[1:15:45] and he shall prepare the way
[1:15:49] before me
[1:15:50] and so you don't actually come until
[1:15:52] they ask jesus
[1:15:54] you know why do the scribes say elias
[1:15:58] must
[1:15:59] first come and jesus just gives a
[1:16:01] two-fold answer you know elias truly
[1:16:05] shall future
[1:16:07] there there will be a prophet from the
[1:16:08] future
[1:16:09] and he'll come and restore all things
[1:16:11] but i also say to you there has there's
[1:16:13] a partial fulfillment here and and he's
[1:16:15] come already and they understood he
[1:16:17] spoke of john
[1:16:19] see and so because you know because
[1:16:23] when you when you look at that you know
[1:16:25] all elijah ministries blend and overlap
[1:16:28] with meaning
[1:16:29] from the time of elijah the tishbite to
[1:16:31] elisha who who who stood in his who
[1:16:34] stood in his room and and you and you
[1:16:37] find that he he washed the hands of of
[1:16:40] the prophet and and the different things
[1:16:41] like that and then you come to john who
[1:16:43] denied he was elijah but jesus says if
[1:16:46] you can receive it
[1:16:48] if you can receive it this is he of whom
[1:16:51] i said i send my messenger before my
[1:16:53] face
[1:16:54] to prepare the way
[1:16:55] and and he said elijah's come already
[1:16:58] and now they understand that he's elijah
[1:17:00] even though john had actually denied
[1:17:02] that he was elijah see because any true
[1:17:04] prophet would deny that
[1:17:05] and so we find then that
[1:17:08] that when he comes to malachi 4
[1:17:11] and 5 and 6 then this is going to be a
[1:17:14] calling to a new phase of the kingdom of
[1:17:17] god and now it's it's not you know
[1:17:20] they're ju
[1:17:22] just so you understand
[1:17:24] why we believe we believe there are
[1:17:26] scholars
[1:17:27] who look at malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 and
[1:17:31] they say it's all on john
[1:17:35] but just there are just as many take my
[1:17:38] word for it there's just as many other
[1:17:40] learned scholars
[1:17:41] with just as many letters behind their
[1:17:43] name as these guys
[1:17:45] who say no it's partially john but it
[1:17:47] also refers to a future elijah and i'm
[1:17:50] only saying that so that you know you're
[1:17:52] not somewhere out in the woods in the
[1:17:54] thicket with this this is this is
[1:17:57] widely accepted that malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:18:00] has a dual fulfillment now where they
[1:18:03] make their mistake is
[1:18:05] is that they
[1:18:07] they believe that that future
[1:18:08] fulfillment
[1:18:10] is the elijah to come to the 144 000.
[1:18:14] and many of them believe that and then
[1:18:16] some say we don't know
[1:18:18] they they just didn't know they they
[1:18:20] asked arthur pink who was tremendous
[1:18:23] beautiful mind during that man age
[1:18:25] anointed to think that way one of the
[1:18:26] greatest bible teachers of all time as
[1:18:29] far as i'm concerned
[1:18:30] and highly revered and they asked him
[1:18:33] and he just said i i don't know he said
[1:18:35] well it's for a future time and god will
[1:18:38] interpret it when it comes see
[1:18:40] so i just want you to know you're not
[1:18:42] don't let somebody think make you think
[1:18:44] that you're just off the off you're just
[1:18:46] out of your mind that you're not out of
[1:18:48] your mind this is bible scholars who
[1:18:51] have thought this for for
[1:18:52] centuries
[1:18:54] and so but but but then say well then
[1:18:57] could it be elijah to which as a student
[1:18:59] of the scripture i say impossible it's
[1:19:02] impossible for it to be elijah to the
[1:19:04] jews malachi 4 5 6 couldn't be that
[1:19:07] because the whole point
[1:19:09] of malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:19:12] is that there's to come and elijah to
[1:19:15] save a people from the tribulation
[1:19:18] from going into the judgment i'm coming
[1:19:20] to destroy the earth but i'm going to
[1:19:21] send a prophet
[1:19:23] see and and and we know that moses and
[1:19:26] elijah and 144 000 and the remnant of
[1:19:28] the woman's seed they all are martyred
[1:19:30] in the tribulation period but the bride
[1:19:32] has already gone to glory
[1:19:35] so it would have to be a gentile prophet
[1:19:37] dropping down in that interval of time
[1:19:40] between the sixth and seventh trumpet to
[1:19:42] call a bride that's why you have
[1:19:45] revelation 9 and it starts talking about
[1:19:47] the trumpets first second third fourth
[1:19:49] fifth by the time you get this is
[1:19:50] historical markers that's what the
[1:19:52] trumpets are by the time you hit the
[1:19:54] fifth trumpet you're talking about the
[1:19:56] prelude to world war one and then when
[1:19:58] that's over the first world war the
[1:20:00] first was over and then it comes to the
[1:20:02] sixth trumpet and that's the 200 million
[1:20:04] remember that demon chargers that bounty
[1:20:07] euphrates and they're going to be loose
[1:20:08] to go after hitler i mean loose go after
[1:20:11] the jews under hitler nikon right this
[1:20:13] is rudimentary stuff right
[1:20:14] and and it's and it's and
[1:20:17] while the fifth trumpet is being sounded
[1:20:20] and a world war one is taking place as
[1:20:23] i've said to you and given you this
[1:20:24] example many times because it adds such
[1:20:26] clarity and god is now removing the
[1:20:29] control of the ottoman empire so that
[1:20:31] his
[1:20:32] children can head back to the homeland
[1:20:34] at least get started and get out
[1:20:36] from under the grip of the ottoman
[1:20:38] empire and at the same time he's doing
[1:20:41] that under the fifth trumpet he's god is
[1:20:43] in a tree talking to a boy
[1:20:47] saying
[1:20:48] don't ever drink or smoke or defile your
[1:20:50] body
[1:20:51] because i gotta as this as these
[1:20:53] trumpets keep sounding i'm gonna have it
[1:20:55] work for you and then when you go to the
[1:20:57] sixth trumpet and now you've got 200
[1:20:59] million demons being released
[1:21:02] then
[1:21:03] and then at the end of world war ii
[1:21:05] right at right after world war ii god
[1:21:08] has got that same boy who's now a man
[1:21:10] and he's in a cave and he's appearing to
[1:21:12] him saying i come from the presence of
[1:21:14] god to explain your ministry
[1:21:17] because now he's going to launch out at
[1:21:19] one born out of season he wasn't there
[1:21:22] when the azusa revival started and he's
[1:21:24] trying to tie it all together and bring
[1:21:26] him back to unity and that and that
[1:21:29] covers through chapter nine
[1:21:30] and you you don't get the seventh
[1:21:33] trumpet until chapter way over or past
[1:21:36] chapter 11 where moses and elijah are
[1:21:39] now bringing the message to the 144
[1:21:43] thousand and so that they can have the
[1:21:44] day of atonement and recognize messiah
[1:21:47] and wouldn't you know it right in the
[1:21:49] middle chapter 9 and chapter 11 you've
[1:21:52] gotten 12 you've got chapter 10 because
[1:21:55] there had to be a mighty angel with a
[1:21:57] prophet on the earth to come down and
[1:22:00] call a bride
[1:22:02] and that's why brother branham said it
[1:22:03] would be in the interval between the
[1:22:04] sixth and seventh trumpet historically
[1:22:06] speaking
[1:22:07] see
[1:22:08] and so what is the seventh seal it's the
[1:22:11] coming of the lord
[1:22:13] and the beauty of it is we're not
[1:22:15] waiting for it to start the the
[1:22:17] revelation of the seventh seal is it's
[1:22:18] already underway
[1:22:21] what's the biggest evidence the mighty
[1:22:23] god among us
[1:22:25] what other evidence you got he's living
[1:22:27] in a people
[1:22:28] he's living through a people it's a
[1:22:30] shout it's a voice it's a trumpet and
[1:22:33] one day that'll bring the dead saints
[1:22:35] out of the grave and change you in a
[1:22:37] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:22:40] see
[1:22:41] so the scripture is just
[1:22:43] perfect
[1:22:45] and now we wouldn't have known any of
[1:22:47] that had it not been for kentucky
[1:22:49] hillbilly who happened to be a prophet
[1:22:52] who didn't know anything theologically
[1:22:55] but he he had enough sense to know i'll
[1:22:58] go back and find my types in the old
[1:22:59] testament and then when then when the
[1:23:02] lord brings me a revelation i'll see
[1:23:04] where the type was in the shadow i'll
[1:23:06] see what paul said and if this meets
[1:23:08] this meets this then i know i've got it
[1:23:11] and then he'd come to the pulpit and
[1:23:13] he'd give it to you then you'd have it
[1:23:16] and then as a vindication the pillar of
[1:23:18] fire would come down and we'd see the
[1:23:20] sign of the son of man year after year
[1:23:22] after year tens of thousands of times
[1:23:24] without a flaw
[1:23:26] that's impossible for a human
[1:23:28] only god could do that see
[1:23:31] so so we find then that that this
[1:23:34] gentile elijah would announce the season
[1:23:38] of the coming kingdom a millennial a
[1:23:40] millennial kingdom where where the
[1:23:42] kingdoms of this world would become the
[1:23:45] kingdoms of our lord and of his christ
[1:23:47] which is his bride which is mrs jesus so
[1:23:50] so god's messengers here's what's here's
[1:23:52] a great
[1:23:53] a marker to identify a true messenger of
[1:23:56] god god's messengers are always working
[1:23:59] on god's one goal
[1:24:02] expression
[1:24:04] they're they're not here to
[1:24:06] just teach you
[1:24:08] theology
[1:24:10] they didn't come just to interpret some
[1:24:12] you know some
[1:24:14] harbingers and and
[1:24:16] and and and
[1:24:18] signs of doom
[1:24:20] you know and and
[1:24:21] symbols you know apocryphal symbols in
[1:24:24] the book of revelation they're actually
[1:24:26] here to first identify god
[1:24:30] then demonstrate god then feed that god
[1:24:33] to you
[1:24:34] so that now the progression goes from
[1:24:36] him to him to you
[1:24:38] you understand and then you and then
[1:24:41] when when that happens then that middle
[1:24:43] prophet can go on home
[1:24:44] because because the ministry that we
[1:24:48] feed on was never the body word of a man
[1:24:52] it was the body word of the son of man
[1:24:54] and the ministry of the son of man is
[1:24:56] still in the bride she's the final voice
[1:24:59] to the final age see
[1:25:01] and so we find that that that that this
[1:25:04] messenger comes depending on the age
[1:25:06] that he's living in their message will
[1:25:08] correspond to that time it always will
[1:25:11] time literally intersects with prophecy
[1:25:13] and god's word for that hour is
[1:25:15] accomplished and the beauty of it is
[1:25:17] friends oh my goodness the beauty of it
[1:25:19] is satan can do nothing about it
[1:25:23] satan can do nothing about it satan
[1:25:26] cannot stop it he can't stop you he
[1:25:28] can't stop him he can't stop the word
[1:25:34] see
[1:25:35] and so
[1:25:36] so here then
[1:25:38] uh
[1:25:39] is is how that we're building this truth
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:44] all right
[1:25:45] and satan that really he as you've heard
[1:25:47] me say so many times he's really just a
[1:25:49] great puppet
[1:25:50] just like in pilate's judgment hall even
[1:25:52] the events of calvary
[1:25:54] see satan actually ended up playing a
[1:25:56] helpful part in the accomplishment of
[1:25:58] god's will thank you buddy
[1:26:01] amen
[1:26:02] amen too bad you helped us thank you
[1:26:06] see he's a puppet and so he brings about
[1:26:08] god's will and you know you have to
[1:26:11] understand this progression so now
[1:26:13] i haven't come here today just to
[1:26:15] identify markers of history and where we
[1:26:17] are in prophecy those are elementary
[1:26:18] things to us
[1:26:20] the purpose of a sermon like this
[1:26:22] is is to get you to understand
[1:26:26] that if god
[1:26:27] made those steps then he's going to make
[1:26:30] the next step
[1:26:32] and he's making a step
[1:26:34] right now
[1:26:35] he's making a step in your life and
[1:26:37] that's what i want to get you to have
[1:26:39] your hearts and minds open to is that
[1:26:41] he's here to take the next step and what
[1:26:43] is his next step him in you
[1:26:46] living the word made flesh in the earth
[1:26:48] again that's what brings the dead saints
[1:26:51] from the grave
[1:26:52] and changes your mortal body see
[1:26:56] so so we find then that
[1:26:59] you know god is always you know taking
[1:27:02] the next step to get to a new heavens
[1:27:05] uh to a new heavens and a new earth
[1:27:08] so now it's it's and as i said last time
[1:27:11] it's the same heavens
[1:27:12] but with now with the redeemed family
[1:27:14] that's what the kingdoms of our lord and
[1:27:16] of his christ are going to be so new
[1:27:18] heavens and new earth
[1:27:20] you know are not a rescue package
[1:27:23] it has nothing to do with the political
[1:27:25] climate this is
[1:27:26] the new heavens and the new earth are
[1:27:28] not a build back better
[1:27:31] they're not even to make heaven great
[1:27:32] again
[1:27:34] okay
[1:27:35] praise god brother luther they're
[1:27:37] neither one has nothing to do with men
[1:27:40] this has everything to do with the word
[1:27:42] and the people who are here who have the
[1:27:44] ability to say amen to every word see
[1:27:50] so it's not a
[1:27:52] it's not a
[1:27:54] you know
[1:27:56] it's god's plan that he had in his mind
[1:27:59] before the world began
[1:28:02] redemption was always part of his plan
[1:28:05] you can see that in the word zoe give me
[1:28:07] genesis chapter one
[1:28:09] and uh
[1:28:11] uh start at verse 27 honey
[1:28:14] genesis chapter 1 and we'll catch 27 and
[1:28:17] 28. amen this is so weird
[1:28:24] and so so all right look at our
[1:28:25] scriptures so god created man in his own
[1:28:28] image i love that
[1:28:29] in the image of god
[1:28:32] created he him
[1:28:34] see male and female created he him and
[1:28:36] god blessed them
[1:28:38] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[1:28:40] multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:28:43] subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:28:44] fish of the sea of fowl of the air and
[1:28:46] over every living thing that moveth
[1:28:50] upon the earth
[1:28:52] so brother branham comes here in christ
[1:28:54] is the mystery of god revealed
[1:28:56] and and he you know he he's going to
[1:28:59] talk about the expression of his
[1:29:01] preeminences but but let me let me read
[1:29:03] you the couple of paragraphs prior to it
[1:29:06] so brother branham says he's god's
[1:29:08] speaking to moses
[1:29:10] take thy rod god speaking that's god's
[1:29:12] word
[1:29:13] go out there this is christ's mystery of
[1:29:15] god revealed he said lord i told pharaoh
[1:29:19] what you said
[1:29:20] and he wouldn't do it
[1:29:22] and so god said take your rod god
[1:29:24] speaking that's god's word go out there
[1:29:27] and point it towards the east and call
[1:29:29] for flies and flies come into creation
[1:29:32] because he had a watch he had a prisoner
[1:29:36] that pharaoh couldn't pay off with
[1:29:38] nothing
[1:29:42] i hope you are impervious
[1:29:45] from the enemy's loot to being paid off
[1:29:49] i hope young people that you got enough
[1:29:51] love of the word of god not to get paid
[1:29:53] off by glamour
[1:29:55] and the enemy just give you a payment of
[1:29:57] fortune and glory or fame or popularity
[1:30:00] or a little bit of money
[1:30:01] make you somebody famous in the world
[1:30:03] and you sell out and every
[1:30:07] great you say well you know i mean
[1:30:10] all inspiration comes from god god
[1:30:12] anoints gifts and he's he doesn't he
[1:30:14] doesn't take things back he's not as the
[1:30:16] old saying an indian giver which is a
[1:30:18] disparagement of the white man not the
[1:30:20] native american it's the white man who
[1:30:22] who's the who he's like an indian giver
[1:30:24] gives it and takes it back and lies and
[1:30:26] breaks his word
[1:30:27] so
[1:30:28] so god's not like that as i've said to
[1:30:30] you before god doesn't wake up in a bad
[1:30:32] mood
[1:30:33] thank the lord we do he doesn't
[1:30:37] there's no wrong side of the bed for him
[1:30:39] thank the lord
[1:30:41] so so we find he says here that pharaoh
[1:30:44] he had a god had a prisoner that pharaoh
[1:30:47] couldn't pay off with nothing nobody
[1:30:49] else turned him no way
[1:30:52] he was a complete
[1:30:54] prisoner
[1:30:55] in the chains of god's word
[1:31:00] help me lord
[1:31:01] bound up only to thus saith the lord
[1:31:06] oh
[1:31:08] if god can get him some prisoners like
[1:31:11] that
[1:31:12] how many won't be convicts today
[1:31:15] if god can get him some prisoners
[1:31:18] like that my
[1:31:20] oh he says
[1:31:22] uh he then
[1:31:24] then
[1:31:25] now that's when
[1:31:26] he can express the preeminences you see
[1:31:31] he's got a man or the person see so this
[1:31:34] is male or female a person so that he
[1:31:37] knows nothing but christ you get what i
[1:31:40] mean
[1:31:41] congregation says amen
[1:31:44] see
[1:31:45] now that's secondly now first to express
[1:31:47] himself completely god in christ second
[1:31:50] to have the preeminence
[1:31:53] by this in his church which is his body
[1:31:56] the bride that's his second goal to have
[1:31:58] preeminence in you see till he could
[1:32:00] have the preeminence to express himself
[1:32:03] through them
[1:32:05] that's what this age is so
[1:32:08] drunk with is self-expression
[1:32:11] i mean that's why you have a youtube
[1:32:14] and a facebook
[1:32:15] that that's that's that's why you have
[1:32:18] you know ted talk and instagram and it's
[1:32:21] all so that people can express
[1:32:22] themselves
[1:32:24] and all of that expression is headed for
[1:32:27] a tribulation
[1:32:28] so naturally you you shouldn't be
[1:32:31] surprised if i warn you
[1:32:33] against that
[1:32:35] to say god is looking for his expression
[1:32:38] to live through you
[1:32:41] how how i would love to you know i'd
[1:32:43] love to see some young people who are
[1:32:44] determined to have facebook and take
[1:32:46] talk and all these kind of things i'd
[1:32:47] love for you to get on there and open up
[1:32:49] a bible and start reading and say i want
[1:32:51] to declare the love of god is in my
[1:32:53] heart today
[1:32:55] oh i'm going to tell you something
[1:32:56] friends they'd probably censor you and
[1:32:57] close you right down if you tried that
[1:32:59] but you should try it anyway
[1:33:03] see
[1:33:04] thirdly
[1:33:05] to restore the kingdom that's us to its
[1:33:08] rightly position that fell by sin by the
[1:33:10] first adam back to where he could he
[1:33:13] walked in the cool of the eating boy i
[1:33:14] got to hurry with his people talked with
[1:33:16] them fellowshipped with them and now
[1:33:19] catch the saying it's a strange
[1:33:21] statement and now
[1:33:23] sin and death had separated them from
[1:33:26] his presence and his entire expression
[1:33:29] see so in this fallen condition of our
[1:33:32] birth we can never reach the image of
[1:33:35] genesis 1 27-28
[1:33:38] you know you're cut off from that that
[1:33:39] was his commission be fruitful multiply
[1:33:42] subdue have dominion over everything in
[1:33:45] the earth there's no way to come to that
[1:33:47] image
[1:33:48] in our fallen condition and this age
[1:33:52] can't
[1:33:53] bring you back to it again
[1:33:56] all of the religion that we have and all
[1:33:59] of the denominations and all of the
[1:34:00] movements and all of the satellite tv
[1:34:02] and all the podcasts none of that can
[1:34:04] bring you it back because it's all a
[1:34:07] mixture of god's word and manmade
[1:34:09] ideology and while that worked during
[1:34:12] the ages when god could wink at that
[1:34:14] ignorance he's come to the last time now
[1:34:16] and he's come to the end of the seventh
[1:34:18] age which is a time of the bride which
[1:34:21] is a time of thus saith the lord only
[1:34:23] and he's saying now the only way to get
[1:34:26] liberty is to receive all the word of
[1:34:29] god
[1:34:32] see
[1:34:33] this world
[1:34:35] is literally going
[1:34:36] i mean steadily i don't have to convince
[1:34:38] you of that
[1:34:39] this world is steadily going into
[1:34:41] madness more and more and more
[1:34:44] this world is steadily going further and
[1:34:45] further away it's almost like a uh like
[1:34:48] you've seen it sometimes depicted an
[1:34:50] astronaut you know who's gonna jump from
[1:34:52] one part of a space station to the next
[1:34:55] and and and you know he
[1:34:57] he misses the grab bar and he has no
[1:35:00] tether and you know he the la the last
[1:35:02] thing that they portray him the last
[1:35:04] thing you see you see him spinning and
[1:35:06] rolling helplessly and hopelessly and
[1:35:09] and he's just tumbling further and
[1:35:11] further and further into space
[1:35:14] and there's no
[1:35:15] chance to save him
[1:35:18] that's the world
[1:35:20] you live in
[1:35:22] it tried to make a leap
[1:35:24] and it missed the bar
[1:35:26] and it wasn't tethered to christ and
[1:35:28] it's just drifting further and further
[1:35:31] and further and there's no way to turn
[1:35:35] the world around see
[1:35:37] and so brother branham says here
[1:35:41] holy ghost seeds of the bible
[1:35:45] cannot grow
[1:35:47] in the atmosphere of wisdom
[1:35:49] you with me still
[1:35:50] is with me still
[1:35:52] man don't don't zone out on me because
[1:35:54] i'm going to take these last 15 or so
[1:35:56] minutes
[1:35:57] so he says holy ghost seeds of the bible
[1:35:59] cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom
[1:36:02] that kills every seminary in the country
[1:36:04] that knocks the holes
[1:36:06] right through them punctures them and
[1:36:08] the judgment flows in that's right it
[1:36:10] certainly does
[1:36:11] because the word cannot grow with wisdom
[1:36:14] worldly wisdom won't do it now there's a
[1:36:16] godly wisdom of course there's nobody's
[1:36:18] talking about
[1:36:19] he says eve
[1:36:21] was to believe the word
[1:36:23] as it was given to her that right
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:28] giving you the opportunity to
[1:36:29] participate in the quote congregation
[1:36:31] says
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:33] eve was to believe the word as it was
[1:36:35] given to her she wasn't to listen to
[1:36:38] anybody else say anything about it
[1:36:41] just the way it was given to her that's
[1:36:44] the way she was supposed to believe it
[1:36:47] now watch what he says
[1:36:49] look listen to the value
[1:36:52] had she done that
[1:36:54] there would have never
[1:36:56] been a death
[1:36:59] if she had believed that
[1:37:01] that's right kinda like jesus saying
[1:37:04] verily verily
[1:37:05] very truly see truly truly very truly
[1:37:09] and he says if she had a that's the way
[1:37:12] she was supposed to believe it then
[1:37:14] there would if she had done that there
[1:37:16] would never have been a death if she had
[1:37:18] believed that that's right now friends
[1:37:20] this being true how many believe that's
[1:37:22] true
[1:37:23] then then i'll ask you a question if
[1:37:25] we're going to be keepers of the word
[1:37:28] and if her abandoning of it caused every
[1:37:30] death or wouldn't have been a death had
[1:37:32] she stayed with it is that right then if
[1:37:34] we're gonna then that being true then
[1:37:36] why can't we speak the word of life to
[1:37:40] anything that death and unbelief has
[1:37:42] brought on us
[1:37:44] if if unbelief has brought death and
[1:37:47] troubles on us then why can't we take
[1:37:50] the opposite and take the word and
[1:37:52] believe it and speak to our problem
[1:37:55] speak to our sickness speak to our
[1:37:57] situation and you're not speaking
[1:37:59] wishful thinking you're declaring the
[1:38:01] word
[1:38:02] see
[1:38:04] this was the meaning this was part of
[1:38:07] what it meant to come out of her my
[1:38:09] people as i've said to you before come
[1:38:11] out of everything satan trapped you in
[1:38:14] don't live
[1:38:16] with the
[1:38:19] you know the wounds and the damage that
[1:38:21] life may have caused you i mean
[1:38:24] first of all you were born dying you
[1:38:26] can't get much worse
[1:38:29] you're born with a death sentence
[1:38:31] and as if it couldn't get any worse then
[1:38:33] people did things to you that made it
[1:38:35] even worse and then you did things to
[1:38:37] you that made it even worse worse
[1:38:40] and but i'm here to tell you that when
[1:38:41] you come to christ let it go let it go
[1:38:44] accept the freedom accept the liberty
[1:38:47] that is in the holy ghost speak the word
[1:38:49] back to that situation
[1:38:50] see
[1:38:51] because that's what god can get behind
[1:38:53] that if you're living your life in the
[1:38:55] line of his word then you have a right
[1:38:57] you're entitled to speak the word and
[1:38:59] the holy ghost who's the enforcer of it
[1:39:01] will will back it up see
[1:39:03] reclaim your rights as a child of the
[1:39:05] king brother branham says in the
[1:39:06] restoration of the bridegroom i'm going
[1:39:07] to read you some quotes quickly
[1:39:10] he said what is it enforcing give it
[1:39:12] back that's it
[1:39:14] that's what it's talking about restore
[1:39:15] it bring it back to its rightful to its
[1:39:16] right honor see
[1:39:18] and if satan has robbed you of privilege
[1:39:21] of being a son or a daughter of god

[1:39:30] we have a ride not just in 1962 we have
[1:39:34] a ride this morning
[1:39:36] in this building in this service right
[1:39:39] where you're sitting to say give it back
[1:39:43] see
[1:39:47] if you're a son or daughter of god we
[1:39:48] have rights this morning by the holy
[1:39:50] spirit to enforce the claim of god and
[1:39:53] bring them back
[1:39:55] bring them back bring back my child
[1:39:57] bring back my marriage bring back my
[1:39:58] health bring back my peace of mind
[1:40:01] see
[1:40:02] don't let the devil hang on to stuff
[1:40:03] he's not entitled to it
[1:40:05] he's not entitled to it christ died for
[1:40:08] you
[1:40:09] and the holy spirit is here to give you
[1:40:11] the holy ghost and make you an overcomer
[1:40:13] and
[1:40:13] free you from every every possible thing
[1:40:16] the devil has ever held on your life
[1:40:18] if you'll accept it
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:21] if he's afflicted you i'm reading this
[1:40:24] because
[1:40:25] i'm not here to give you a pep rally i
[1:40:26] can get you excited but i want you to
[1:40:28] know i didn't make this up
[1:40:30] this came from elijah see
[1:40:34] if he's afflicted you and made you sick
[1:40:37] we have a right before god to enforce
[1:40:40] the laws
[1:40:41] of god
[1:40:42] by his stripes we are healed amen
[1:40:46] bring him back turn him loose
[1:40:49] you're taking him out yonder of death
[1:40:51] and we claim him bring him back
[1:40:54] now
[1:40:55] i love that
[1:40:56] oh you got a wayward loved one why don't
[1:40:58] you just say in the name of jesus bring
[1:41:00] him back now
[1:41:02] not waiting another day not waiting
[1:41:04] another week bring him back now
[1:41:07] hallelujah friends that's your right
[1:41:09] that's your liberty in the holy ghost
[1:41:11] see
[1:41:12] that's the enforcement
[1:41:15] restore it i mean when i read this and
[1:41:17] if you go hear the tape brother branham
[1:41:19] talking about it in the restoration of
[1:41:20] the bride tree brother branham is
[1:41:23] he's i mean the these he's saying this
[1:41:25] with emotion
[1:41:27] this isn't just some dry teaching he's
[1:41:30] trying to get the people to understand
[1:41:31] the realities of the living god what's
[1:41:33] possible
[1:41:35] he said that's the enforcement
[1:41:37] restore it back to its natural condition
[1:41:39] again a man is sick baby is sick woman
[1:41:42] is sick they're out of their natural
[1:41:44] condition then we have a right to
[1:41:47] enforce our claim not our claim it's our
[1:41:51] claim because god gave it to us by his
[1:41:54] stripes we were healed he was wounded
[1:41:57] for our transgressions with his stripes
[1:41:58] were healed now we have a right to
[1:42:00] enforce that law
[1:42:01] and the law giver the holy spirit
[1:42:04] himself is here the agent of god to see
[1:42:08] that it's done that way
[1:42:12] what way according to the way of his
[1:42:14] word that you put on your lips but
[1:42:16] brother brown made a statement like this
[1:42:19] he said if you are afraid to claim it
[1:42:22] if you won't put it on your lips and
[1:42:23] make a claim and you're afraid to speak
[1:42:26] it he said then jesus christ cannot help
[1:42:29] you
[1:42:30] because he's the high priest of your
[1:42:32] confession
[1:42:34] see
[1:42:34] and so now see now the only way
[1:42:38] the only way he can work
[1:42:41] is when you
[1:42:43] let him work
[1:42:45] see you've got to believe there's a law
[1:42:48] he said oh if i ever get to my text
[1:42:49] there's a law that's a law given amongst
[1:42:51] everything he says now watch we have a
[1:42:54] law the law of life in us
[1:42:57] we don't you see you are made born a
[1:42:59] place here placed here in the body of
[1:43:01] christ the sons and daughters of god you
[1:43:03] don't have to knock down to the devil
[1:43:05] we got a law that's the law of the holy
[1:43:08] spirit the only thing you have to do the
[1:43:09] only thing the only thing you have to do
[1:43:12] is know how to let go and let god you
[1:43:15] keep fighting at it see it won't never
[1:43:18] work when you let go and let god that's
[1:43:21] all say how do i let go let go of you
[1:43:24] let go of all your dreams and your plans
[1:43:26] and put your life in the hand of
[1:43:27] almighty god let go of your pursuits and
[1:43:30] get yourself out of the way and let god
[1:43:32] come into your life and speak the word
[1:43:35] through you and then he'll enforce that
[1:43:37] word
[1:43:39] it's so beautiful in the scriptures
[1:43:41] brother ernie used to point out that god
[1:43:43] promises god promises two things that
[1:43:46] he'll give you a faith and then he'll
[1:43:48] give you a reward for having the faith
[1:43:50] he gave you
[1:43:56] he'll give me faith and then he'll give
[1:43:59] me a reward for having what he gave me
[1:44:02] i'm in
[1:44:03] i'm in i'll take that deal how many want
[1:44:06] that deal today
[1:44:07] oh my see
[1:44:10] see he says here now it's easter time i
[1:44:12] like easter yes sir but there's too much
[1:44:15] easter today on the easter bunnies and
[1:44:17] rabbits and ducks and pink chickens and
[1:44:18] pretty hats and new dresses that's not
[1:44:20] easter easter is resurrection restoring
[1:44:23] to restore back it's god's restoring
[1:44:26] time see listen friends this is your
[1:44:29] life he's talking about this is your
[1:44:31] life dead and ruined in sin and god's
[1:44:34] law is here to give you the right to
[1:44:36] enforce that to say death give way
[1:44:40] death give way you're gonna say that
[1:44:41] today whatever however satan's operating
[1:44:44] in your life just say death give way
[1:44:47] this is the spirit of elijah to make to
[1:44:50] make clear to make way to make a way for
[1:44:52] the son of god to come forth i want to
[1:44:54] make a way in my life
[1:44:57] i want to make it plain so that he can
[1:45:00] come and the one whom you seek shall
[1:45:02] suddenly come to his temple
[1:45:04] and we'll be out of here friends
[1:45:07] i'm going to have to skip some of these
[1:45:08] quotes i'm trying to finish in seven
[1:45:10] minutes
[1:45:13] he talks about the sun
[1:45:15] the winter takes everything down but the
[1:45:17] sunlight brings it back
[1:45:19] the earth went away from the sun went
[1:45:20] back out here
[1:45:22] that's the way the sinner does gets away
[1:45:23] from the sun the s-o-n
[1:45:26] see well this s you in when the earth
[1:45:28] began to come back and when it's out
[1:45:29] there death strikes it the winter kills
[1:45:32] every living thing it can kill out here
[1:45:34] and now when the earth gets back around
[1:45:36] the seed is laying in the ground they're
[1:45:38] frozen the pulp has run out of them
[1:45:40] everything is gone but there's a little
[1:45:44] life preserved and as soon as the sun
[1:45:46] gets back in position with the earth
[1:45:48] again then there is an east an easter
[1:45:51] there's a restoration up comes the
[1:45:54] flowers again up comes everything all
[1:45:56] that winter has killed the sun restores
[1:45:59] all that winter's death kills the sun of
[1:46:03] life
[1:46:04] restores
[1:46:06] he will
[1:46:07] restore
[1:46:08] his eden
[1:46:10] he will restore everything that death
[1:46:14] killed
[1:46:15] that's right
[1:46:17] now
[1:46:18] now the only way
[1:46:20] it can ever remain dead
[1:46:22] is let it lay in the wrong place
[1:46:24] see you've got to see to god but if you
[1:46:26] never bring it into the presence of god
[1:46:28] is this in the wrong place but if it
[1:46:30] falls in the right place it's got to
[1:46:32] come back to life again so god let us
[1:46:35] fall in the right channel that's right
[1:46:38] for a restoration and all that the
[1:46:40] winner killed then the sun restores
[1:46:42] returning of the sun that's where we are
[1:46:45] it is the rising of the sun that's
[1:46:48] what's happened in our day
[1:46:50] you're liberated from everything that
[1:46:53] that your sin person brought on you
[1:46:55] everything anybody brought on you
[1:46:56] everything you brought on you no matter
[1:46:58] what the devil has taken from you jesus
[1:47:01] christ in his open word today gives it
[1:47:03] back to you
[1:47:05] see
[1:47:06] it's yours death has to give up its dead
[1:47:09] to a resurrection for what a restoration
[1:47:12] what does it the sun coming that's god's
[1:47:14] law i'm here to tell you friends your
[1:47:16] message this morning to satan should be
[1:47:19] give it
[1:47:20] back that should be your message to
[1:47:23] satan today this is god's law now give
[1:47:26] it back
[1:47:28] i'm not leaving this building today like
[1:47:30] i came this is god's law and i'm saying
[1:47:33] give it back give it back now give it
[1:47:36] back in this service give it back right
[1:47:39] where i'm seated now
[1:47:42] see
[1:47:44] that's what god
[1:47:46] has done
[1:47:48] in our hour
[1:47:50] god has brought back
[1:47:52] his restored word
[1:47:54] i want you to stand with me this morning
[1:47:58] and as our musicians return i wanna
[1:48:01] i wanna come to the end of this service
[1:48:03] today and i've got more notes but i
[1:48:05] think it'll probably be a different
[1:48:06] sermon altogether
[1:48:09] but i want you to
[1:48:11] ponder what you've heard today because
[1:48:13] i i wanted to make my case
[1:48:16] out of scripture because i know you
[1:48:18] believe that
[1:48:20] i wanted to make it from the quotes of a
[1:48:22] prophet because i know you believe that
[1:48:25] see
[1:48:25] you could doubt me but you can't doubt
[1:48:27] what i've said today because there's no
[1:48:30] one who can say that i made any
[1:48:32] statement outside the line order of
[1:48:34] god's word i was very careful
[1:48:36] to only say what was authoritative to
[1:48:40] you today now buy your heads for me all
[1:48:42] over the building play whatever is your
[1:48:45] uh brother anthony
[1:48:46] bow your heads everywhere now
[1:48:49] now listen friends
[1:48:50] why your heads are bowed
[1:48:52] you're standing here still
[1:48:54] under the sound of my voice
[1:48:56] no one looking around all eyes closed
[1:48:58] please
[1:48:59] the enemy
[1:49:00] i want to say to you
[1:49:02] the enemy
[1:49:03] will keep taking things from you
[1:49:06] unless you stop him
[1:49:09] say i want god to do it brother branham
[1:49:11] said i don't have the quote here in
[1:49:12] front of me he said there are some
[1:49:14] things that god will not do
[1:49:17] he's waiting for you to do it
[1:49:20] i'm here to tell you if you're tired of
[1:49:23] being pushed around by a lying devil and
[1:49:25] you're tired of the ups and downs and
[1:49:27] tired of if you're tired of falling at

[1:53:54] i want the people to understand their
[1:53:56] liberty in christ
[1:53:58] it didn't come by accident
[1:54:00] it came by the purposeful
[1:54:02] plan of the expression of god and just
[1:54:06] as every word that has ever come to pass
[1:54:10] this word will come to pass
[1:54:12] we will lord

[1:54:23] be caught up with them
[1:54:25] we shall be changed in a moment
[1:54:28] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:54:30] so today lord what are we doing are we
[1:54:32] making some
[1:54:34] some
[1:54:35] some unwarranted claims some
[1:54:38] lord is it an unsolicited claim no it's
[1:54:40] you inviting us to make the claim it's
[1:54:43] not unwarranted because it's in your
[1:54:45] word and we're claiming it today in the
[1:54:47] name of jesus christ
[1:54:49] every person that made their claim today
[1:54:51] however long their list was
[1:54:53] i am looking for the holy spirit now to
[1:54:55] go forward in my life and in their life
[1:54:58] and be the enforcer of these things now
[1:55:00] lord whatever it might take in my life
[1:55:04] whatever it might
[1:55:06] cause me to have to give up
[1:55:09] make me willing lord
[1:55:11] make me willing
[1:55:14] why your heads are bowed
[1:55:16] still please while you're in prayer
[1:55:20] he's not going to let me out of reading
[1:55:23] this quote to you i want you to listen
[1:55:24] to the word of your prophet
[1:55:26] from august the 25 august 25th 1963 in a
[1:55:30] message called how can i
[1:55:33] overcome
[1:55:36] with your heads bowed now i want you to
[1:55:38] listen
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:41] if we are trying to follow the message
[1:55:43] of the hour or at least this part of the
[1:55:45] message
[1:55:47] we should live constantly in the life of
[1:55:50] christ
[1:55:51] now i want you to think about your
[1:55:53] priorities friends as i read this one
[1:55:54] think about your schedule
[1:55:56] i want you to think about what you give
[1:55:57] so much of your time to
[1:55:59] think about what you
[1:56:01] sit
[1:56:02] for hours and hours and you're involved
[1:56:04] with listen to what he's saying
[1:56:07] if we're trying to follow the message of
[1:56:09] the hour at least this part of the
[1:56:11] message about
[1:56:12] overcoming
[1:56:14] you want to overcome raise up a hand you
[1:56:15] want to be an overcomer how many see
[1:56:18] me too
[1:56:19] then we should live constantly
[1:56:22] in the life of christ because if it
[1:56:24] don't
[1:56:25] watch now if it don't
[1:56:27] you lay around
[1:56:30] and know
[1:56:31] that these things that you're supposed
[1:56:33] to do don't do it
[1:56:35] the bible said he that knoweth to do
[1:56:37] good and doeth it not to him it's sin
[1:56:39] then what happens you lay around then
[1:56:41] you become dodie
[1:56:43] rotten
[1:56:44] when you're separated from the life of
[1:56:46] god so strive
[1:56:49] with all that's in you
[1:56:52] to stay
[1:56:53] in the life of christ that you would be
[1:56:57] fruit bearing
[1:57:00] see as i said at the beginning
[1:57:02] you are born defeated
[1:57:04] and that birth can never bring you to
[1:57:06] life because you're born defeated you're
[1:57:08] in a defeated world
[1:57:10] amongst defeated people
[1:57:12] amongst defeated creeds defeated
[1:57:14] denominations
[1:57:16] you've got to come to victory some way
[1:57:19] see
[1:57:20] but the problem is so often we don't
[1:57:22] want to be humiliated
[1:57:26] that's the reason women don't want to
[1:57:28] their hair to grow out see
[1:57:30] the reason they don't want to dress like
[1:57:32] ladies should dress like men don't want
[1:57:34] to see it's the same thing they don't
[1:57:37] they get humiliated
[1:57:39] but jesus constantly
[1:57:42] look who he was
[1:57:43] look at his greatness i'm going to say
[1:57:46] something
[1:57:47] greatness
[1:57:48] humiliates itself
[1:57:51] great
[1:57:52] humbles itself
[1:57:54] that's greatness
[1:57:58] father as i
[1:57:59] drove across through the countryside
[1:58:02] yesterday listening to that tape
[1:58:05] it just overwhelmed me
[1:58:08] i just found myself saying oh god help
[1:58:10] me
[1:58:11] oh let my life be constantly lord let me
[1:58:14] be willing to give up the things that so
[1:58:16] distract me from you let me give up so
[1:58:19] much stuff that makes me lazy and dody
[1:58:22] and all i do is lay around and i know
[1:58:23] what i should be doing and i don't do it
[1:58:26] help us today lord
[1:58:28] help us to be willing to humiliate
[1:58:30] ourselves the greatest person that was
[1:58:32] ever could be great humiliated himself
[1:58:35] that's greatness but many times we don't
[1:58:37] do it because we don't want to be
[1:58:38] humiliated lord i want to i want to
[1:58:41] raise up both my hands today and say i
[1:58:43] surrender to humiliation
[1:58:45] i surrender lord if the world completely
[1:58:47] rejects me i want to be in the love of
[1:58:49] god
[1:58:50] i want my life to be in service to you
[1:58:52] lord
[1:58:53] i want my daily life lord to be pursuing
[1:58:56] your word i want my time lord god more
[1:58:59] given over to prayer more given overlord
[1:59:02] to fellowship with you less and less as
[1:59:05] every day let me muster a little less of
[1:59:07] the world and more of you prophet said
[1:59:09] as much as you can empty out of yourself
[1:59:11] then he'll rush in and fill up that
[1:59:13] place
[1:59:14] as much as you can empty out of the
[1:59:15] world
[1:59:17] he'll come in and fill up that place
[1:59:18] lord help us today
[1:59:21] this is why the word came lord this we
[1:59:24] want to have these rights we want to
[1:59:25] have this this enforcer
[1:59:28] the enforcer i can't enforce nothing but
[1:59:30] you can and you will
[1:59:32] if you're allowed to express yourself
[1:59:34] through me
[1:59:36] if my words of making a claim are not
[1:59:38] just vain words
[1:59:40] with no purpose behind them no plan to
[1:59:44] to humiliate myself and let god live in
[1:59:47] my heart then we'll make all the claims
[1:59:49] in the world it will be it'll just go
[1:59:51] it'll fall to the ground it'll never go
[1:59:52] anywhere
[1:59:54] but when you can
[1:59:55] have faith if our hearts condemn us not
[1:59:58] then we can have faith towards god
[2:00:00] to believe that what we've said will
[2:00:02] come to pass
[2:00:04] i commit it to you today lord now very

[2:11:39] entrusted to watch after you the church
[2:11:41] in financial matters they are in uh
[2:11:43] unison today they took a vote among
[2:11:45] themselves they were 100 behind this
[2:11:47] plan brother mark will express that when
[2:11:49] he comes up but uh we're going to need
[2:11:52] your prayers we're going to need your
[2:11:53] support
[2:11:54] amen because it's quite ambitious and i
[2:11:58] i i have become persuaded in my
[2:12:01] in in my way and kind of just
[2:12:05] i don't want to say it any more than
[2:12:06] that just in my way i kind of was to say
[2:12:09] well let's just do some cosmetic things
[2:12:11] but
[2:12:12] if you know i be i've become persuaded
[2:12:15] brother jason has become persuaded by
[2:12:17] all the team of brothers to say listen
[2:12:19] if we do that
[2:12:20] and we make it pretty it really doesn't
[2:12:23] still meet our needs not even now to say
[2:12:26] nothing of long term
[2:12:28] so we're now looking forward to
[2:12:29] something a little more aggressive
[2:12:31] brother matt i'll turn it over to you
[2:12:32] god bless you
[2:12:36] bless you i'm getting if you want to go
[2:12:38] to pull that up we had a um
[2:12:41] and not that one not that one nope the
[2:12:43] first one i showed you actually just
[2:12:44] stand by we're going to show those in
[2:12:46] order
[2:12:47] so we had a business meeting i know that
[2:12:49] you um
[2:12:50] sisters probably
[2:12:52] uh inquired from your husbands what that
[2:12:54] was about and i'm sure most of you have
[2:12:56] been made aware that we've uh
[2:12:58] we're going to move into the second
[2:13:00] phase of renovations for the property we
[2:13:02] started with the outside and uh i
[2:13:05] personally think the outside is
[2:13:07] beautiful
[2:13:08] and we have a just a quite a bit of a
[2:13:10] difference the night and day
[2:13:12] at the end of all the project we'll show
[2:13:14] you some of the before and after
[2:13:15] pictures
[2:13:16] that we have but it's quite an
[2:13:18] improvement to what we've what we had
[2:13:20] prior with just the block
[2:13:22] um now we have the beautiful
[2:13:24] outside and the new landscaping and some
[2:13:27] other renovations we did even to the
[2:13:28] fellowship hall some of that there's
[2:13:31] still as you can tell there's effects
[2:13:33] from that that are temporary such as the
[2:13:35] trim around these windows just waiting
[2:13:39] also the lighting we put in new lighting
[2:13:40] didn't fix the ceilings because we knew
[2:13:43] we were going to be going to the second
[2:13:45] phase which would be the interior
[2:13:47] renovation and so just to sort of show
[2:13:50] you how that has evolved we had a
[2:13:52] meeting and that meeting was
[2:13:54] just to talk about some improvements
[2:13:56] that we want to do to the interior that
[2:13:58] would help the interior match the
[2:14:01] exterior and the look uh that we're
[2:14:03] going for
[2:14:04] and so that meeting was largely covering
[2:14:07] the removal of this ceiling that you
[2:14:09] have above you
[2:14:10] above these beams and i'm a lot of this
[2:14:12] is repetitive all of it's repetitive for
[2:14:14] the brothers who are here um but above
[2:14:16] you is uh
[2:14:18] beautiful just raw
[2:14:20] milled wood and trusses that that hold
[2:14:23] the roof and the walls together
[2:14:25] and so we it's we wanted our idea was to
[2:14:28] open this up to vault the ceiling it's
[2:14:30] already voted but to remove this and you
[2:14:32] would see the vaulted ceiling and the
[2:14:34] expose the beautiful
[2:14:37] wood that they that they used when they
[2:14:39] built this church 1950s i think if that
[2:14:42] 55
[2:14:44] um somewhere in there so
[2:14:46] when they built this property they uh
[2:14:47] they did a good job at just some of the
[2:14:49] the way that they they uh put up the
[2:14:52] trusses and the the the materials that
[2:14:54] they use are beautiful so we want to we
[2:14:57] also have had a need for a while with
[2:14:59] air conditioning when it gets uh hot
[2:15:01] this ac system is undersized and doesn't
[2:15:03] keep up with the uh the need that we
[2:15:06] have especially during the hottest
[2:15:07] months
[2:15:08] and so the idea was also to
[2:15:11] change that completely entirely since we
[2:15:14] would be vaulting the ceiling
[2:15:15] you would no longer have the space for
[2:15:18] you could run duck a ductile system but
[2:15:20] the plan was was is to use
[2:15:23] large commercial mini splits that would
[2:15:25] cool and heat the entire building
[2:15:28] and so may
[2:15:29] most of the business meeting was about
[2:15:31] the cosmetic things that we could do
[2:15:33] plus the air conditioning spray foaming
[2:15:35] the um
[2:15:36] the uh the roof so that we could have
[2:15:39] you know proper adequate um uh
[2:15:41] efficiency for our heating and cooling
[2:15:44] and so we we sort of started with that
[2:15:47] and when we talked amongst brothers we
[2:15:50] were ball parking just a general
[2:15:52] ballpark
[2:15:53] um the demolition of that
[2:15:55] new carpet also this carpet has seen
[2:15:58] better days it's done really well to
[2:16:01] hold up they carpet on the stage and the
[2:16:03] carpet that's in the on the main floor
[2:16:05] seating has done well to to hold up but
[2:16:07] we want to change some of the colors
[2:16:10] a lot of the woodwork that you see uh
[2:16:12] maybe uh we we would consider it dated
[2:16:15] and so we want to update some of that
[2:16:17] the paneling that's on the wall to take
[2:16:19] that out and drywall change the color so
[2:16:21] a lot of cosmetic changes we were
[2:16:24] ballparking that in the range of about
[2:16:26] fifty thousand dollars somewhere in
[2:16:28] there of which we are going to do a
[2:16:30] building fund and fund the church funded
[2:16:33] the outside and so we're going to do a
[2:16:34] building fund to fund all of the
[2:16:37] the future renovations we were looking
[2:16:40] at after phase 2 which would be the
[2:16:42] interior renault
[2:16:44] to be phase three which would be the
[2:16:46] fellowship poll and obviously if you've
[2:16:48] been in the fellowship hall lately it's
[2:16:50] packed
[2:16:51] even with just a third or two-thirds of
[2:16:53] the church there there's not much uh
[2:16:55] there's not much elbow room and so we've
[2:16:57] had a great need there and so the idea
[2:17:00] was to maybe expand that
[2:17:02] maybe to cover in the pavilion and
[2:17:05] to stick frame that and actually extend
[2:17:07] the fellowship paul move the kitchen
[2:17:08] there was a lot of ideas but obviously
[2:17:10] we were just focused on phase two
[2:17:13] after some conversation uh with brothers
[2:17:16] and and actually a lot of this is things
[2:17:18] that even brother mark carter and other
[2:17:20] brothers but the mark actually drew up
[2:17:21] some things and did some for the
[2:17:23] trustees and did some 3d imaging of that
[2:17:26] what it would look like with just
[2:17:28] toying with different ideas of adding
[2:17:30] the vestibule we need bathrooms in the
[2:17:32] front you know changing the fellowship
[2:17:34] hall maybe out of the building so there
[2:17:35] was all kinds of ideas
[2:17:37] but what we've honed down on is what
[2:17:39] we're going to do and i'm going to show
[2:17:41] you in this floor plan
[2:17:43] is to rather than just go for
[2:17:46] a small cosmetic facelift you could call
[2:17:49] it that
[2:17:50] why don't we solve problems because we
[2:17:52] have some issues that we've had here for
[2:17:54] a long time on this property
[2:17:56] such as bathrooms
[2:17:58] out
[2:17:59] here no bathrooms at the front you have
[2:18:01] to walk especially if it's raining it's
[2:18:03] real inconvenient
[2:18:05] sunday school rooms bathrooms the
[2:18:07] heating and cooling problem that we've
[2:18:08] had the stage is too small these guys
[2:18:11] are cramped uh up here stage is too
[2:18:13] small and even seating when we're when
[2:18:16] we have our entire church and we're
[2:18:17] packed in it's packed in nice and tight
[2:18:20] um but
[2:18:21] we we look to grow and the lord's
[2:18:23] there's families the church is going to
[2:18:25] be growing here over the next couple
[2:18:26] months with families moving in so how do
[2:18:28] we how do we accommodate everything
[2:18:30] solve some problems with our fellowship
[2:18:32] hall
[2:18:32] solve problems with office space and how
[2:18:35] the space is laid out currently right
[2:18:37] now and so
[2:18:39] um god sends the right people at the
[2:18:41] right time
[2:18:42] exactly the right time god sent brother
[2:18:44] steve and sister emily curtis our way
[2:18:47] and our brother steve has a profession
[2:18:49] in design designs houses and so uh he
[2:18:52] was gracious enough to give us some
[2:18:54] beautiful renders and concepts
[2:18:57] actual life like life-size so true to
[2:19:00] what it would look like because the
[2:19:02] program that he used he used his lidar
[2:19:05] on his phone to get an exact image and
[2:19:07] he took measurements of what the
[2:19:09] building space is square footage and
[2:19:11] then he put that in concept so the
[2:19:13] conceptualizing thing that you're
[2:19:14] looking at what you're about to see
[2:19:17] uh is the design the colors the carpet
[2:19:20] even down to the chairs everything is is
[2:19:22] life like what it will look like
[2:19:24] um when we're when we're done
[2:19:26] i want to just say also that this is a
[2:19:29] preliminary i'm i we just wanted to
[2:19:32] bring the church up to speed because
[2:19:34] there was a lot of chatter after the
[2:19:35] meeting what's happening so today is not
[2:19:37] the full presentation we don't have all
[2:19:40] the answers um we have a lot of
[2:19:42] logistics to work out that we'll be
[2:19:44] doing we do however have a team of team
[2:19:47] leads brothers who have agreed to lead
[2:19:51] up the effort
[2:19:53] we have
[2:19:54] different brothers and those brothers
[2:19:55] are here most of them are here today
[2:19:57] some are traveling out of town
[2:19:59] and then brother steve also has worked
[2:20:01] up these images uh and also on top of
[2:20:04] that he's worked up the the initial
[2:20:08] preliminary floor plan there are some
[2:20:10] things that can change and things that
[2:20:11] i'm sure will change you're going to
[2:20:13] notice that the fellowship paul want to
[2:20:14] show it to you doesn't have a kitchen
[2:20:16] and it doesn't have sunday school rooms
[2:20:18] so don't bombard the trustees or brother
[2:20:22] steve especially leave brother steve
[2:20:23] alone um tom bob if you want to come to
[2:20:26] brother stephen ask question come to me
[2:20:28] to save him from getting bombarded
[2:20:30] because he's come to me yeah come to the
[2:20:32] pastor he's simply drawn what we've
[2:20:35] proposed to him uh and designed what
[2:20:37] we've designed and so there's going to
[2:20:40] be a lot of questions and what if we did
[2:20:41] this what about this we're thinking
[2:20:42] about all of that and there's uh you
[2:20:44] know there's a lot of consensus based
[2:20:46] things i'm going to show you uh two
[2:20:48] different roof plans one is with exposed
[2:20:51] trusses one is with a
[2:20:53] um what would you call the second i'd
[2:20:55] say
[2:20:56] like a coffered ceiling yeah like faux
[2:20:58] beams coffered ceiling all white um so
[2:21:01] there's there's two different styles i'm
[2:21:03] going to show you here and then a really
[2:21:04] neat video brother steve put together um
[2:21:08] and so just going to show that at the
[2:21:09] very end i want to just say again this
[2:21:12] is preliminary it is the direction that
[2:21:14] we've chosen to go we're going to be
[2:21:16] doing a building fund um for that there
[2:21:19] will be a lot of fundraising
[2:21:21] for that brother ken boos is going to be
[2:21:23] leading that effort and he's going to be
[2:21:25] up here before you on his own discretion
[2:21:27] maybe weekly or every week basis just
[2:21:29] doing giving you an update on where we
[2:21:31] are with the fund um he's put together a
[2:21:34] document with a lot of good even
[2:21:36] scriptures i wish i would have read this
[2:21:37] morning didn't didn't pull him up and
[2:21:39] was gonna pull them up just things that
[2:21:40] the bible talks about in nehemiah when
[2:21:42] they put their hand when everyone joined
[2:21:44] in unison and put their hand and had the
[2:21:47] spirit of help and of labor and of work
[2:21:49] so we need your prayers we're gonna need
[2:21:51] your financial support to do it
[2:21:53] it's very beautiful i'm going to start
[2:21:55] with the dry part of this which is the
[2:21:57] floor plan
[2:21:58] just to show you an overview so you know
[2:22:00] what you're looking at when you see the
[2:22:01] render so pull up the floor plan gideon
[2:22:04] there you go and make that big and i
[2:22:06] don't have a way to control it just make
[2:22:08] it full screen make it full screen the
[2:22:10] green yep
[2:22:11] and then command plus we'll zoom it in
[2:22:14] if you could do that zoom in again again
[2:22:17] can we turn these lights out and of
[2:22:18] course all of them every single one of
[2:22:20] them stage lights and everything
[2:22:22] and then if you can use the up down left
[2:22:25] and right arrow keys again you can go up
[2:22:28] go down down there now
[2:22:30] up one
[2:22:32] stop perfect what you're seeing is
[2:22:35] zoom out one time actually getting i
[2:22:37] want to see all the outside walls here
[2:22:40] and we can send this so that you can
[2:22:42] have and look it up close
[2:22:45] man i wish i had a way to control this
[2:22:47] and i can't use a laser pointer so maybe
[2:22:49] on a step you have the wireless mic
[2:22:51] brother
[2:22:57] just an explanation here
[2:22:59] the outside walls that you see here this
[2:23:02] entire square just the rectangle square
[2:23:05] if you could yeah use the mouse and show
[2:23:07] just the square here going around that
[2:23:09] is the existing sanctuary that includes
[2:23:13] from that wall back wall all the way to
[2:23:15] the back wall beyond the stage to the
[2:23:17] offices that's the existing building
[2:23:20] we're not expanding that we're keeping
[2:23:23] the same outside walls that we have here
[2:23:24] that's not getting expanded
[2:23:26] what we are doing in and and if you just
[2:23:29] uh let me explain it this way and you
[2:23:31] understand the prints better
[2:23:32] this stage the stage wall
[2:23:35] is is gone so everything goes back all
[2:23:38] the offices in the back the pastor's
[2:23:40] study the bathrooms that we have back
[2:23:41] here everything is gone everything
[2:23:43] shifts this way
[2:23:45] which will allow room um to to
[2:23:49] put what you see here and zoom in here
[2:23:51] gideon on this uh this front area here
[2:23:53] just zoom in right right here
[2:23:55] um and go over go over this way go over
[2:23:59] this way zoom in again
[2:24:01] here zoom in again
[2:24:02] okay so what you're seeing here is the
[2:24:04] vestibule area come down this way
[2:24:07] nursery women's restrooms an area just a
[2:24:09] little a wall leading into that men's
[2:24:12] restrooms above you could zoom back out
[2:24:14] and so vestibule bathroom sound room cry
[2:24:17] room all up front and then the stage all
[2:24:20] the way to the back now you say what
[2:24:21] happens to the offices uh and you know
[2:24:24] and all of that well behind that
[2:24:26] is the um addition if you go that way
[2:24:29] gideon that way
[2:24:31] yep and zoom in on that some
[2:24:33] if you could you see that there's an
[2:24:35] addition um on the back in between the
[2:24:38] fellowship hall
[2:24:40] and the church now will be filled with a
[2:24:42] new addition plus an addition to the
[2:24:44] side that is down here come down this
[2:24:47] way so down here this is a new addition
[2:24:50] to would be over here um for the
[2:24:52] pastor's study go this way towards the
[2:24:54] fellowship hall and then zoom out
[2:24:58] zoom out now the current fellowship pole
[2:25:01] stops about right
[2:25:04] here
[2:25:05] stops about right there
[2:25:07] and so if you imagine a line going over
[2:25:09] that's our current size you can see
[2:25:11] we're removing the roof structure that
[2:25:14] we have back here and we're framing that
[2:25:16] all in and expanding extending the
[2:25:19] fellowship hall and even past that put
[2:25:21] in another awning almost like the roof
[2:25:23] structure but an awning that would go
[2:25:25] out uh beyond that and then there's
[2:25:27] restrooms also if you zoom in if you
[2:25:29] come up here to the fellowship hall area
[2:25:32] up here getting the very top of your
[2:25:33] screen and zoom in right here
[2:25:35] zoom in on this go over go over zoom in
[2:25:39] again so the entrance to the fellowship
[2:25:41] hall is here with restrooms we still got
[2:25:43] to lay out bathrooms etc um you're not
[2:25:46] going to see this in the con
[2:25:47] conceptualizing images you're just going
[2:25:49] to see the sanctuary that's what the con
[2:25:50] concept images are of but the floor plan
[2:25:53] shows that in in gist if i could just
[2:25:56] keep it simple the sanctuary we're not
[2:25:59] adding to the front some people ask
[2:26:01] that's going to stay
[2:26:02] what we're going to do is add a we're
[2:26:03] going to redo how we have the layout
[2:26:06] back there with the booth we're going to
[2:26:08] add men's and women's restrooms we're
[2:26:10] going to add a nice vestibule area
[2:26:12] obviously so i have a nursery and a
[2:26:14] sound booth there and then by doing this
[2:26:17] setup of this new sanctuary we add
[2:26:20] between 70 and 80 seats
[2:26:23] to this sanctuary
[2:26:26] so we're able to stay on this property
[2:26:28] longer so
[2:26:29] really the improvements that we're doing
[2:26:33] is maximizing the potential of this
[2:26:35] property without going overboard and
[2:26:38] over building it so if we were to grow
[2:26:40] to a 300 the seating will seat 192
[2:26:44] is what the new sanctuary will seat if
[2:26:46] we go beyond that and we're in the 300
[2:26:48] range the lord tarries and adds to the
[2:26:50] church well then we would the trustees
[2:26:52] and the church would just have to decide
[2:26:54] to sell the property buy something else
[2:26:56] but this is maximizing it to its fullest
[2:26:58] potential
[2:26:59] uh so you would have this stage
[2:27:02] all the way back we would the stage
[2:27:04] would increase in size obviously not in
[2:27:06] width but in depth would increase in
[2:27:08] size
[2:27:08] um you would have doors that come you
[2:27:11] could imagine doors even though stage is
[2:27:13] going to be rearranged that would lead
[2:27:14] to the new addition the back offices
[2:27:16] which is this area
[2:27:18] right here go over getting in this way
[2:27:21] uh that that is this area here with a
[2:27:24] new music room pastor study av room some
[2:27:27] bathrooms back there a hallway a way to
[2:27:29] get from the fellowship hall into here
[2:27:31] and then back and forth
[2:27:33] um
[2:27:34] and so uh that that is the general floor
[2:27:37] plan uh ideas with the additions that
[2:27:40] we're proposing now i want you to go to

[2:27:44] right one not the one with the white
[2:27:46] ceilings gideon you should have another
[2:27:48] document no no close that document
[2:27:49] entirely go to finder and then open up
[2:27:52] the second the next document

[2:30:53] different style make that large
[2:30:57] and you can just go through those
[2:30:58] pictures
[2:31:00] showing that coffer type still ceiling
[2:31:03] look a little bit slightly different
[2:31:14] and then glass i like that a lot better

[2:31:26] a little bit of volume
[2:31:28] because it has some beautiful beautiful
[2:31:30] singing to it sort of gives you an idea
[2:31:32] of what it would feel like inside of it
[2:31:34] i like how brother steve made this this
[2:31:35] is a video showing it's going to switch
[2:31:38] back and forth between the two ceilings
[2:31:41] options the exposed truss and then the
[2:31:43] coffer go ahead and play that

[2:32:32] amen on those i i told him i said the
[2:32:35] emoticon that has the the head that's
[2:32:37] exploding would be the perfect perfect
[2:32:40] one to use for that
[2:32:42] so i did a wonderful job on that so
[2:32:44] that's the update we can give you um as
[2:32:47] i said there's going to be more
[2:32:48] information more details to come
[2:32:51] that'll follow this we're going to be
[2:32:54] getting pricing that's just the floor
[2:32:56] plan preliminary plans we're going to
[2:32:58] need to mep the mechanical electrical
[2:33:00] plumbing plan we're going to need the
[2:33:01] demo plan we're going to need the
[2:33:03] foundation plan so there's a lot to get
[2:33:06] i've got to go to the city talk to them
[2:33:07] about what we're doing what we want to
[2:33:09] do um we don't know somewhere you know i
[2:33:13] would i would throw out a rough number
[2:33:15] of if the 50 000 was the facelift this
[2:33:17] is probably closer to 150. we won't know
[2:33:20] that number so don't don't ask us we
[2:33:23] won't know that number till we actually
[2:33:24] get hard numbers and pricing on
[2:33:26] everything and then when we have that
[2:33:29] brother ken will be doing a presentation
[2:33:30] on the fundraising and how to how to
[2:33:32] fund this so why don't you give the lord
[2:33:35] just another hand clap amen
[2:33:40] amen i got brother mark carter's going
[2:33:42] to come and just say a few words from
[2:33:44] the board of trustees amen
[2:33:53] um
[2:33:54] i just wanted to just reiterate what
[2:33:56] brother jason said what what our role as
[2:33:58] trustees is and and maybe
[2:34:01] tell you how we actually think about it
[2:34:03] when we're doing that you know our job
[2:34:04] is to represent you all
[2:34:07] and things physical material with the
[2:34:09] church the property keeping the upkeep
[2:34:11] and also any indebtedness keeping the
[2:34:14] church from many what we feel would be
[2:34:17] unnecessary indebtedness um of course
[2:34:20] ours is just four votes brother george
[2:34:22] brother charles brother john and myself
[2:34:24] we're just four boats just like you but
[2:34:27] we represent you like when we go to
[2:34:28] these meetings and um
[2:34:31] my
[2:34:32] mindset and i know the other brothers
[2:34:33] feel the same way we've discussed it
[2:34:35] when i go there there's people with a
[2:34:37] big overarching vision like brother matt
[2:34:39] he sees the big picture what we can do
[2:34:42] there's people that are very technical
[2:34:43] you know you could you can't do that
[2:34:45] because this won't work
[2:34:46] but i go there with the perspective of
[2:34:49] how it affects you how you would think
[2:34:50] about it even though
[2:34:52] i think of those things too you know
[2:34:54] it's um
[2:34:55] i try to put myself
[2:34:57] what the questions people will have so
[2:34:59] we are we do take that very seriously
[2:35:02] and when we go to one of the meetings
[2:35:03] we're thinking like you would think and
[2:35:06] i've had people come to me and say
[2:35:07] things like well it's you know
[2:35:11] what we got now works i mean it's all
[2:35:13] cosmetic what we're talking about doing
[2:35:14] do we really need it and um
[2:35:17] the way we're thinking about it um i
[2:35:19] think we took a poll here everybody
[2:35:21] would say that there's three things that
[2:35:23] we need
[2:35:24] i think it would be 100 on the bathroom
[2:35:26] so everybody would say we need new
[2:35:27] bathrooms
[2:35:28] um as far as room in here i mean on
[2:35:31] sundays it gets crowded there's even
[2:35:33] families i see them they can't sit
[2:35:35] together they've got to sit in separate
[2:35:36] parts of the church
[2:35:38] and then the fellowship hall um this is
[2:35:40] the things we thought about the
[2:35:41] fellowship hall when everybody stays you
[2:35:43] can't even turn around in there um
[2:35:46] every sunday it's a race between the
[2:35:47] ladies and the brothers to see who gets
[2:35:49] that good spot
[2:35:50] and we usually win because we eat faster
[2:35:52] so
[2:35:55] but yeah we considered all of that and
[2:35:57] um
[2:35:58] so we're in unison the trustee board
[2:36:00] representing you that this is
[2:36:02] a necessary thing we think that it's a
[2:36:04] good thing to do
[2:36:05] we looked at all the other avenues
[2:36:07] buying another place building from
[2:36:08] scratch and this is by far the most
[2:36:11] affordable and efficient way to do it
[2:36:13] and as far as like the cosmetic things
[2:36:17] yeah just doing them
[2:36:19] from scratch it's expensive but in the
[2:36:23] whole big project of doing those other
[2:36:25] things
[2:36:26] doing those things then it's a bargain
[2:36:28] you can usually do that for about a
[2:36:29] third of what it would cost if we just
[2:36:31] went in to try to do that so even though
[2:36:33] they are just for looks that's important
[2:36:35] and it would be very very affordable in
[2:36:38] the course of this whole big project to
[2:36:40] go ahead and do those things
[2:36:41] so i just wanted to give you our
[2:36:43] perspective on it and reassure you that
[2:36:45] we take it very seriously
[2:36:55] that wonderful
[2:36:57] amen so we you kind of have our ideas of
[2:37:00] where we're going to go forward and i
[2:37:02] just want to uh just to say you know and
[2:37:05] i made this um statement to the trustees
[2:37:08] this morning and to all of the
[2:37:10] brothers uh who uh brother matt has
[2:37:12] placed into team lead positions
[2:37:15] that i cannot
[2:37:17] as the pastor here i cannot become
[2:37:19] entrenched in a construction program i
[2:37:21] hope you'll understand that
[2:37:23] uh you don't need me to anyway we have
[2:37:25] very qualified men
[2:37:27] you know i
[2:37:28] i have a duty to give myself to prayer
[2:37:30] and the study of god's word continually
[2:37:32] for your needs spiritually along with
[2:37:34] the ministry team that god
[2:37:36] helps me with and a lot of them are
[2:37:38] going to be working brother matt
[2:37:40] will be taking the lead as he did on the
[2:37:43] outside
[2:37:45] i there's so many people that have
[2:37:46] helped on every aspect of it uh one
[2:37:49] second deb one second says uh and um
[2:37:53] it's really been a great group effort
[2:37:55] but i think that we owe an extra measure
[2:37:57] of gratitude to brother matt and sister
[2:37:59] rachel who really uh rachel
[2:38:02] was really my right hand man if i can
[2:38:04] call a woman that on design and uh and
[2:38:08] she's got a tremendous amount of
[2:38:09] leadership and influence on the inside
[2:38:11] of you saw many of our ideas we're still
[2:38:14] going back and forth on a few ideas but
[2:38:17] i just appreciate brother matt and
[2:38:18] sister rachel tremendously amen
[2:38:23] amen
[2:38:24] and so you know
[2:38:26] i'm sure it's no secret to you brother
[2:38:28] matt has
[2:38:29] served as my right-hand man to be my
[2:38:31] direct assistance to help pastor this
[2:38:33] church he actually pastored tucson
[2:38:36] tabernacle for a year so he has plenty
[2:38:38] of ample experience in it and will be
[2:38:40] i'll be looking to him to really take
[2:38:42] the reigns of this so if you have any
[2:38:44] questions don't call me amen
[2:38:47] bother i'm call him amen and uh and then
[2:38:50] if he if you if he don't have an answer
[2:38:52] i promise you he'll have a trustee or a
[2:38:54] team leader who will have an answer
[2:38:56] and so it's going to be a tremendous
[2:38:58] group effort the only thing that we we
[2:39:01] know for sure at this point is we want
[2:39:03] to do it
[2:39:05] now how we're going to do it and how
[2:39:06] it's all going to stack out and what
[2:39:08] it's all going to look like
[2:39:09] that's going to go forward and we're
[2:39:10] going to keep you in the loop of it i
[2:39:12] promise you we'll keep you in the loop
[2:39:14] of it and so don't don't think sisters
[2:39:17] that it's just a bunch of men going to
[2:39:20] design the looks we're actually not
[2:39:21] we're building the superstructure and
[2:39:23] we're gonna let
[2:39:25] sister rachel take the lead and she's
[2:39:26] got some ladies that have been helping
[2:39:28] her as well
[2:39:29] uh look and and don't bomb sister debbie
[2:39:31] amen so but there there are plenty of
[2:39:34] people who will be looking at this
[2:39:36] and sisters with multiple talents to
[2:39:38] help uh put all this together now as if
[2:39:41] all of that isn't enough i need
[2:39:43] everybody to go outside and be ready for
[2:39:45] a picture
[2:39:46] amen so we're going to dismiss sister
[2:39:49] emily and let her go out there so when
[2:39:51] you go out there you'll be confronted
[2:39:54] and
[2:39:54] i'm just kidding
[2:39:56] yeah she'll get it over the fast she's a
[2:39:58] she's a professional photographer and so
[2:40:00] she will get it over fast and then
[2:40:02] she'll be able to get that raw data to
[2:40:05] sister wanda
[2:40:06] and i had personally just wanted to keep
[2:40:09] the um
[2:40:10] the directory uh digital i'm all about
[2:40:13] saving the tree i'm not a liberal but
[2:40:15] just about saving the trees and and
[2:40:17] let's just make it digital but people
[2:40:18] had concerns with having their digital
[2:40:20] information on our website so we're
[2:40:22] going to go back to paper i'm going to
[2:40:24] acquiesce in that but remember to
[2:40:26] acquiesce means to agree to reluctantly
[2:40:29] so
[2:40:30] i'm going to
[2:40:32] give the go-ahead for a new paper
[2:40:34] directory sister wand has done that for
[2:40:36] years so we appreciate that let's stand
[2:40:39] to our feet and and uh we're going to be
[2:40:41] dismissed amen let's bow our heads
