[38:49] what happened to us we were drinking the
[38:52] milk God was allowing us to feel his
[38:54] presence every time we come to church
[38:57] we were babies but then God pulled his
[38:59] Spirit back off of us see how you're
[39:01] going to react
[39:02] some of us went the wrong way
[39:04] some of us went too far
[39:06] some of us got dried up in our bones
[39:09] [Music]
[39:10] Hallelujah don't be scared say man
[39:14] you know the scripture signifies the Eve
[39:16] when Israel was scattered we won't go
[39:19] into all that detail we all know the
[39:20] story how they were scattered out all
[39:22] over the Earth but things happened World
[39:24] War One World War II things happened
[39:26] started driving Israel back to their
[39:27] Homeland started bringing bone upon bone
[39:30] back to them so that's what that's all
[39:32] about but we're living in a Time an age
[39:35] of death
[39:36] the world out here is dead
[39:39] dead everywhere
[39:40] and where you look there's death even in
[39:43] the churches
[39:44] I ain't just talk about denominational
[39:45] churches they got death verse death
[39:47] brought in their own message ranks
[39:50] Hallelujah people sitting in churches
[39:52] that are dying there's no life
[39:56] Hallelujah
[40:48] cause out of my belly shall flow rivers
[40:51] of Living Water
[40:55] you know what happens when a baby is
[40:57] born
[40:58] the baby comes out there's no breath
[41:01] doctor will pick it up
[41:03] smack its bottom it screams takes a big
[41:06] deep breath
[41:07] Brother JD I think is what we need to do
[41:09] some church people
[41:11] we need to pick them up and give them a
[41:12] good spanking by the gospel bring them
[41:15] back to life bring them dead bones back
[41:18] to life
[41:20] okay I quote Brevard says
[41:23] tell me the organization when it raises
[41:25] up they started with a move starts to
[41:27] organize they organize it later
[41:29] it died right there they become
[41:31] stillborn children that's dead children
[41:33] what they need is some gospel spanking
[41:36] exactly to bring it back to life
[41:39] so if you're dead come on up here let's
[41:41] give you a spanking we're going to bring
[41:43] these bones back to life
[41:45] we see these churches they're not
[41:47] producing children
[41:49] they're producing images of their
[41:51] pasture
[41:53] Hallelujah
[41:56] they act like your pastor
[42:00] well sometimes that's a good thing
[42:02] sometimes it's not
[42:05] some pastors are deader than four
[42:07] o'clock
[42:08] so what do they produce a church that
[42:10] said at four o'clock
[42:12] oh I'm so happy
[42:14] we got a live pastor
[42:16] we got a pastor we don't have to worry
[42:18] about he's not here to produce a bunch
[42:20] of Watkins

[42:23] you sitting here
[42:24] we're not to be the image of our pastor
[42:27] yeah he's ordained to see us through
[42:28] we're supposed to stay with him but he's
[42:30] not he's not here to produce a bunch of
[42:32] Watkins he's here to produce a bunch of
[42:33] Jesus Christ
[42:35] Hallelujah I know I'm sure he's sitting
[42:37] there chomping at the bit
[42:39] ain't been up here for about six weeks

[42:47] get up here he's not a dead Pastor
[42:50] there's firing him Bones
[42:53] those fire Them Bones want to start
[42:54] preaching brother Matt you know what
[42:55] it's talking about when you get a
[42:57] message from the Lord It's like a
[42:59] burning bunt in your bones that's what
[43:02] Jeremiah said
[43:03] Hallelujah
[43:06] it's all right
[43:07] we're not to be Children of the pastor
[43:10] we're the children of God born in His
[43:12] image
[43:15] Hallelujah we had those churches that
[43:18] have no life at all
[43:21] they walk around like a bunch of zombies

[43:26] these movies as zombies they just walk
[43:28] around

[45:20] fire with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:22] where we can have Revival every service
[45:28] I don't get too far ahead of myself but
[45:30] every time we come to those doors we
[45:32] should be in a Revival

[45:50] God needs to come to life

[47:21] service I've ever been in

[47:24] standing in the back because we gave all
[47:25] the older people the seats
[47:27] and he was preaching I mean you know how
[47:29] blood Tim gets when that when he gets
[47:31] right there in that climax of his
[47:32] sermons and he I I can't really can't
[47:34] remember what he said but it was so good
[47:37] we all hollered glory to God and I
[47:39] turned around and me and his brother
[47:40] gave each other a high five
[47:42] and then we just kind of looked at each
[47:43] other
[47:45] thank God it was in the back
[47:49] but get so excited that you want to jump
[47:52] up to your feet

[54:38] fire don't let it become a tradition
[54:42] it's a no emotion at all preachers can
[54:44] be up here preaching their heart out but

[54:48] what we need is a stir and to bring
[54:50] these old bones to life
[54:52] a Revival in our soul
[54:55] I ain't talking about some fanatical
[54:56] emotion
[54:58] not seemed like I am

[55:31] I've seen too many young people do that
[55:34] too many young people
[55:36] it's sad and I sit and pray dear God let
[55:39] this be real to them let this not be a
[55:42] thing they do to get in front of the
[55:43] church and just dance and run around and
[55:46] you know their lives are not right
[55:48] Lord May something stick with them
[55:52] because dancing ain't going to get you
[55:54] out of here
[55:55] it's going to take a holy ghost fire to
[55:57] burn everything out of you that's the
[55:59] only way you're going to get out of this
[56:00] place
[56:03] a church without a motion is dead
[56:06] we know what brother Brandon said do you
[56:07] need to bury it when you got a dead
[56:09] church we need to bury it
[56:12] Hallelujah
[56:14] we're expecting God to do something for
[56:16] us but remember said but he can't do
[56:18] nothing for us when we're just all
[56:20] drooping around like something half dead
[56:26] if you need a healing
[56:28] check the way you're walking
[56:31] are you walking droopy armed
[56:35] barely making it in the door falling
[56:37] through
[56:38] I'm here Lord Heal Me
[56:42] Hallelujah said this
[56:45] we're just all drooping around like
[56:46] something about half dead he wants a
[56:48] lively church he wants his members in
[56:52] there to be Lively stones
[56:55] build up into the house
[56:57] oh Isaiah 37 3 and he said unto unto me
[57:00] son of man can these bones live
[57:03] I don't know can they
[57:06] that's why he he had a smart answer only

[1:01:11] I want a Revival
[1:01:13] I want one every day
[1:01:16] and I will lay sinews upon you and will
[1:01:18] bring up the flesh upon you and cover
[1:01:21] you with skin and put breath in you
[1:01:23] and ye shall live
[1:01:26] ye shall know that I am the Lord
[1:01:30] Ezekiel says so I prophesied as I was
[1:01:32] commanded
[1:01:34] as I've prophesied there was a noise and
[1:01:37] that noise right there was voice
[1:01:40] there was a voice you know like in the
[1:01:42] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:01:45] when he shall begin to sound the
[1:01:48] mysteries of God should be finished
[1:01:50] a voices saying come out over my people
[1:01:55] seven Thunders utter their voices
[1:01:58] there's a noise
[1:02:00] the seven Thunders is nothing but the
[1:02:02] voice of God we hear the voice of God
[1:02:05] speaking when the voice of God speaks
[1:02:07] things start shaking
[1:02:09] Bones start coming together
[1:02:13] shake the building Lord hear the word of
[1:02:16] the Lord speak to us Lord let that voice
[1:02:19] come
[1:02:20] and behold there was a shaken and the
[1:02:23] bones come together bone to bone you
[1:02:26] know we were dead in our sin one day
[1:02:27] brother Joe
[1:02:30] going from church to church Ballroom to
[1:02:33] Bar Room dance hall to dance hall
[1:02:37] we weren't satisfied
[1:02:39] we thought we were when we go home late
[1:02:41] and I said there's got to be something
[1:02:43] more there's got to be more to this
[1:02:48] oh but what you didn't know there's
[1:02:50] something down on the inside of you a
[1:02:52] seed that was placed before the
[1:02:54] foundation of the world it was your time
[1:02:56] to be born
[1:02:58] you might have walked on this Earth 30
[1:02:59] or 40 years you might have been 12.
[1:03:03] but one day that light struck that seed
[1:03:06] you become quickened you then your dry
[1:03:09] bones started rattling together you
[1:03:12] started shaking under the power of the
[1:03:14] Holy Ghost Lord shake this building
[1:03:18] Hallelujah
[1:03:20] we were just dry bones just walking
[1:03:21] around all we did was satisfy this flesh
[1:03:27] but all of a sudden a voice spoke it was
[1:03:30] the voice of God it was his voice that
[1:03:33] called you we were dead in sin we were
[1:03:36] dead men walking but now we're alive
[1:03:39] forevermore
[1:03:43] so I prophesied as I was commanded and
[1:03:45] as I've promised there was a noise
[1:03:47] behold is shaking
[1:03:50] when there's a voice there be guaranteed
[1:03:52] there's going to be some shaking
[1:03:54] be shaking this sin off your life
[1:03:56] shaking this off that alert going home
[1:03:59] and cleaning out your closets throwing
[1:04:01] away your old videos and your your rock
[1:04:03] music there's a shaking
[1:04:07] hear the word of the Lord
[1:04:09] hahaha
[1:04:11] oh I started to hear some bones rattling
[1:04:13] together
[1:04:14] we gotta speak laughing in them bones
[1:04:16] and when I beheld all the seniors of the
[1:04:19] flesh come upon them and the skin
[1:04:20] covered them above
[1:04:22] but there was no breath in them
[1:04:25] then said he unto me prophesying to the
[1:04:28] wind
[1:04:29] Hallelujah prophesy son of man and say
[1:04:33] to the wind thus saith the Lord God come
[1:04:37] from the Four Winds o breath breathe
[1:04:40] upon these that was slain that they may
[1:04:42] live that's what we scream about we get
[1:04:45] up here oh Winds of the Earth blow upon
[1:04:48] these people
[1:04:49] breathe upon us that's the Breath of God
[1:04:54] what happened Genesis 2 7. God formed
[1:04:58] Man Out of the Dust of the ground and
[1:05:00] breathed on him the breath of life he
[1:05:03] became a living soul
[1:05:06] First Corinthians 15 45 the first man
[1:05:10] Adam was made a living soul
[1:05:13] Hallelujah the last Adam was a
[1:05:16] quickening spirit
[1:05:19] Adam died
[1:05:21] God breathed the life into Adam he died
[1:05:24] but not this Adam
[1:05:26] he's got quickening spirits
[1:05:29] life-giving that's what Quicken spirit
[1:05:32] means life-giving Jesus has life-given
[1:05:35] Spirit he's here to give you life
[1:05:37] tonight
[1:05:39] foreign
[1:05:41] disciples were gathered at church
[1:05:45] the morning of the Resurrection
[1:05:47] Sunday they came to church
[1:05:50] Jesus appeared there
[1:05:53] it's me don't be afraid look at my hands
[1:05:55] you see the scars
[1:05:57] only one person was missing out of that
[1:05:59] meeting
[1:06:00] Thomas
[1:06:03] missed something
[1:06:05] because Jesus gave us his go into the
[1:06:07] world you're gonna go do this and he
[1:06:10] breathed on them and says receive ye the
[1:06:12] Holy Ghost
[1:06:14] Thomas missed that oh the disciples were
[1:06:17] so excited we received the Holy Ghost
[1:06:20] God himself breathed on me
[1:06:23] they were happy
[1:06:24] we should be happy tonight
[1:06:27] Hallelujah God breathed on me
[1:06:30] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:06:33] I guarantee brother Thomas was there the
[1:06:35] next service
[1:06:37] he didn't miss it
[1:06:40] Reverend says the church is a mystical
[1:06:42] Body of Christ
[1:06:43] born of the Breath of God
[1:06:47] Church of God is born of the Breath of
[1:06:49] God God breathed breath into them
[1:06:53] nostrils
[1:06:55] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:06:57] living Soul the true
[1:07:00] Pentecostal Church
[1:07:02] is born by the Breath of God I like the
[1:07:06] way he says true
[1:07:07] not 1906 Pentecost but the true
[1:07:11] Pentecostal Church
[1:07:13] and the same day at evening during the
[1:07:16] being the first day of the week when the
[1:07:17] doors were shut the disciples were
[1:07:19] assembled
[1:07:20] they fit for fear of the Jews Jesus came
[1:07:22] and stood in the midst of them and said
[1:07:25] to them peace be unto you and when he
[1:07:27] had showed them his hands his side the
[1:07:30] disciples were glad when they saw the
[1:07:32] Lord
[1:07:34] and then Jesus said to them peace be
[1:07:36] unto you as my father has sent me so
[1:07:38] send are you watch the father that sent
[1:07:41] him within him
[1:07:44] and Jesus when he sends a disciple he
[1:07:47] goes in him
[1:07:49] glory to God
[1:07:52] and when he had said this he breathed on
[1:07:56] them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:08:01] Church borned of the Breath of God
[1:08:06] brother says when this statue is molded
[1:08:08] itself up there in that condition God
[1:08:11] breathes breath upon them
[1:08:13] they received the Holy Ghost then you
[1:08:16] are a son of God we're not till God
[1:08:19] breathes on us
[1:08:22] they received the Holy Ghost then you
[1:08:24] are a son of God you're born into the
[1:08:26] Church of the Living God born by the
[1:08:28] Breath of God God breathed upon them and
[1:08:31] said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:08:36] not coming John he says
[1:08:39] put your name in put your name on there
[1:08:42] when you soup suppers and all that goes
[1:08:44] with it you join the lodge
[1:08:46] you can join a Methodist Lodge a Baptist
[1:08:48] Lodge a presbyterian Lodge at Catholic
[1:08:50] Lodge or Pentecostal Lodge or a message
[1:08:52] Lodge
[1:08:54] anything you want to join but you're not
[1:08:57] but we're not joining you're just
[1:08:58] joining the lodge but when you become a
[1:09:01] child of God you are born by the Breath
[1:09:03] of God
[1:09:06] oh if you find ourselves dying come up
[1:09:08] here let God breathe on you
[1:09:12] oh we need to just tell the Lord Lord
[1:09:14] revive us
[1:09:16] revive us again Lord send the Revival
[1:09:20] we're dying
[1:09:23] some of us see spiritual mouth-to-mouth
[1:09:26] we're so dead we're lifeless
[1:09:29] Breathe on Me God
[1:09:32] 's 120 went in Upper Room
[1:09:36] when the sound of a mighty Russian wind
[1:09:38] what happened
[1:09:40] the Breath of God came into the room
[1:09:43] Acts 2 1 says when the day of Pentecost
[1:09:46] was fully come they were all in one
[1:09:48] Accord in one place
[1:09:52] and suddenly
[1:09:57] subtly Hallelujah we heard a good mess
[1:09:59] this past weekend and brother Josh is on
[1:10:01] suddenly
[1:10:02] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:10:05] as a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled
[1:10:08] all the house where they were sitting
[1:10:11] you notice this first there came a sound
[1:10:14] from Heaven as a rushy Mighty Wind and
[1:10:17] it filled all the house where they were
[1:10:18] sitting
[1:10:21] Lord
[1:10:23] let that sound of a Russian Mighty wind
[1:10:25] blow through this building fill this
[1:10:27] house where we are sitting
[1:10:31] foreign
[1:10:35] tongues like as a fire and is set up on
[1:10:39] each one of them
[1:10:40] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:10:46] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:10:51] Hallelujah they had a power surge
[1:10:55] you remember years ago
[1:10:58] preached on the power surge
[1:11:00] what happens when somebody comes in
[1:11:01] unity when everybody's in one Accord
[1:11:03] it's Unity
[1:11:05] that's what happens a power surge which
[1:11:07] is an unexpected temporary
[1:11:08] uncontrollable increase in current or
[1:11:11] voltage in electrical circuit a voltage
[1:11:13] Spike
[1:11:15] that's what happens when you the with
[1:11:17] the lights are off it's dark in here
[1:11:20] there's a wire that runs from a panel
[1:11:22] box to that light switch to these lights
[1:11:25] right here but they won't get turned on
[1:11:28] you will have lights until you go flip
[1:11:30] the switch and when you do there's a
[1:11:32] power surge that runs through that box
[1:11:34] through that switch lights come on if
[1:11:37] you're sitting here in darkness I know a
[1:11:40] man who could turn on the light
[1:11:43] it's a power surge
[1:11:46] that's what happens when the Holy Ghost
[1:11:48] goes through you you get an
[1:11:50] uncontrollable temporary uncontrollable
[1:11:53] use of our body if I make us jump up and
[1:11:55] down and run around the building
[1:11:58] Hallelujah you might even speak in
[1:12:00] tongues
[1:12:03] well you might even just sit and cry
[1:12:06] power surge
[1:12:09] I always like to say this right after
[1:12:10] this
[1:12:11] a lot of us has got surge protectors
[1:12:15] we know what surge protectors do when a
[1:12:18] power comes through it it drains it so
[1:12:21] your computers and everything else won't
[1:12:23] get no no damage that's what some of us
[1:12:25] guys got a bunch of surge protectors
[1:12:29] when the Holy Ghost God's moving
[1:12:31] I can't act like that Lord
[1:12:35] dead men
[1:12:37] candies bolds live
[1:12:41] that's what brings a bones to life a
[1:12:44] power surge Lord sweep to the building
[1:12:47] tonight give us a power search give us
[1:12:50] something to put life back in these
[1:12:52] bones
[1:12:56] Hallelujah
[1:12:59] it is a rising of the Sun
[1:13:03] so many good quotes in that I ain't
[1:13:04] gonna read all of them
[1:13:06] I am so glad
[1:13:08] there is a 10 000 octane power
[1:13:11] the word of God and a holy ghost to
[1:13:14] light it up
[1:13:16] and to resurrect the power of God into a
[1:13:19] man's life
[1:13:20] or a woman's life or into a church
[1:13:25] they shoved that Cadillac down the road
[1:13:27] John you're under Dynamic power of the
[1:13:29] Holy Ghost
[1:13:30] which came back and was way during the
[1:13:32] people in the day of Pentecost
[1:13:34] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:13:36] forever
[1:13:39] if it made them act wild then it's going
[1:13:42] to make you act wild now
[1:13:46] Hallelujah
[1:13:48] I was giving away
[1:13:50] his brother dick says don't get nervous
[1:13:53] then said he unto me
[1:13:55] prophesy unto the wind son of man and
[1:13:58] say to the wind thus saith the Lord God
[1:14:01] come from the Four Winds and breathe
[1:14:03] upon these that were slain that they may
[1:14:06] breathe they may live again
[1:14:09] oh oh that's why I want to say Lord
[1:14:13] blow among these people blow Among Us
[1:14:16] Lord and I got myself here
[1:14:20] oh we need that Spirit that's going to
[1:14:22] Quicken us
[1:14:23] Ephesians 3 5 even when we were dead in
[1:14:26] sin hath quickened us together with
[1:14:30] Christ by grace are ye saved
[1:14:36] Robert said in God provided place if the
[1:14:38] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:14:40] dead be in you it will also Quicken your
[1:14:44] mortal bodies
[1:14:47] if the spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:14:50] the dead be in you
[1:14:54] it'll also Quicken your mortal body
[1:14:58] hallelujah quickening what does that
[1:15:00] word quick mean
[1:15:02] the Greek word means to be brought to
[1:15:04] life after death
[1:15:10] Hallelujah
[1:15:13] that's the Gate of worship he says
[1:15:15] worship it in the spirit of the truth
[1:15:17] mechanics and Dynamics together
[1:15:21] if the spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:15:24] the dead dwells in you it will Quicken
[1:15:27] your mortal bodies it will make you
[1:15:29] alive because it's all
[1:15:31] because it's already life
[1:15:36] and when it comes into your body it
[1:15:38] brings your whole body subject to it
[1:15:41] subject to what
[1:15:43] the word of God
[1:15:46] who all we need we need the Dynamics to
[1:15:48] strike the mechanics that's what a lot
[1:15:50] of us just got
[1:15:51] only God's just a bunch of mechanics
[1:15:57] this is one of the reasons for the man's
[1:15:58] prayer meeting every Thursday night
[1:16:00] and by the way men's prayer meet
[1:16:02] tomorrow night at six o'clock
[1:16:04] right here if you ain't been here you
[1:16:07] don't know what you're missing but
[1:16:09] that's the goal
[1:16:10] of what we pray every Thursday night
[1:16:14] Lord let the dynamic strike the
[1:16:17] mechanics
[1:16:19] we can just have all the mechanics we
[1:16:21] want
[1:16:22] we can be in a car we can have nice
[1:16:25] seats we have a motor in there oh
[1:16:27] beautiful color brand new vehicle
[1:16:30] but it's not going to run
[1:16:33] it ain't got a spark
[1:16:36] but go ahead and put some gasoline in it
[1:16:40] turn the key and watch that thing go
[1:16:45] Hallelujah
[1:16:50] so if you want if you Brothers want this
[1:16:51] in your families
[1:16:53] please come
[1:16:55] that was free
[1:16:58] but we can't work it up
[1:17:01] we can't produce a Revival on our own
[1:17:05] God has to do it
[1:17:07] okay I got a quote for that that's
[1:17:09] Sovereign but around says that's what
[1:17:11] God does and he alone has a right to
[1:17:15] send a Revival
[1:17:18] not get the mechanics together
[1:17:21] it's it's to pray for God to send the
[1:17:24] Dynamics he only reveals his word to
[1:17:27] those that are predestinated
[1:17:31] wow
[1:17:33] but the mechanics is all right but the
[1:17:37] mechanics won't move it it takes the
[1:17:39] Dynamics to move it
[1:17:41] you can build an automobile put find
[1:17:43] seats in it make fine Pistons proved by
[1:17:46] science what it can do but unless the
[1:17:48] Dynamics is in there she's just a dead
[1:17:51] piece of goods
[1:17:55] that's why we are sitting here
[1:17:57] we can be all mechanical
[1:18:00] raise your hands
[1:18:02] brother Matt does a good job of this
[1:18:04] raise your hands let's worship God
[1:18:07] again
[1:18:09] he says that 20 times the service
[1:18:13] maybe he's trying to get some life in
[1:18:15] you
[1:18:16] he didn't tell me say it
[1:18:22] Hallelujah but unless the Dynamics is
[1:18:25] there she's just a dead piece of good
[1:18:26] you're like in the Welsh Revival
[1:18:29] we know these men went over over to
[1:18:30] England looking for it says can you tell
[1:18:33] us where the Welsh Revival is
[1:18:36] because
[1:18:37] I'm him
[1:18:40] because since somebody was coming to
[1:18:42] that door and says hey
[1:18:43] where's the bride's Revival
[1:18:47] are you looking at it you're looking at
[1:18:50] the bride's Revival because I'm in a
[1:18:53] Revival every day
[1:18:56] why because the Dynamics they struck the
[1:18:59] mechanics
[1:19:00] it's a promise
[1:19:03] that's the mechanics but let God in his
[1:19:05] Sovereign Grace just speak to some
[1:19:06] little nitwit
[1:19:08] to some little nobody to let his Spirit
[1:19:11] fall into the City and men can't go to
[1:19:14] work women can't wash dishes the maids
[1:19:16] can't make the bed they're screaming and
[1:19:18] crying with their hands up in the air
[1:19:20] that's Revival
[1:19:22] and then he says that's the will of God
[1:19:29] the will of God is to go around crying
[1:19:31] and screaming and raising our hands up
[1:19:33] in the air
[1:19:37] so I prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:19:40] the breath Came Upon them
[1:19:42] and they lived
[1:19:46] and stood upon their feet and exceeded
[1:19:49] great Army
[1:19:54] I'm going to speak and say listen hear
[1:19:56] the word of the Lord
[1:20:00] wins four winds blow
[1:20:03] upon these people
[1:20:05] let these bones come to life
[1:20:13] what happens you become a great Army
[1:20:15] that you're the Invincible Army
[1:20:18] that no devil can beat you no devil can
[1:20:21] stand in your way
[1:20:23] that's what gives you power to kick
[1:20:25] around the devil
[1:20:28] Hallelujah Invincible Army

[1:22:45] we're astronauts

[1:31:00] six months and she has some signs she
[1:31:03] has
[1:31:03] she has some signs they think maybe
[1:31:05] linked to a genetic condition and they
[1:31:07] are running ultrasounds on her spine
[1:31:09] head and kidneys the genetic testing
[1:31:12] won't be back until this weekend right

[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:39] anybody got any testimonies
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:46] um so as most of you know me and Micah
[1:33:49] are working on renovating our house um
[1:33:51] right now
[1:33:52] so we were looking for a set of cabinets
[1:33:55] which is very expensive and um
[1:33:59] so the cheapest ones we were able to
[1:34:00] find were eight thousand dollars and we
[1:34:03] still weren't able to afford that so I
[1:34:06] really wanted cabinets because it was
[1:34:07] really hard to have a kitchen without
[1:34:08] cabinets so um I started praying and I
[1:34:12] was like Lord if you can just give us a
[1:34:13] set of cabinets a full set under just
[1:34:16] five thousand dollars five thousand
[1:34:17] dollars or less we can work with that so
[1:34:19] I just started praying for him to find
[1:34:21] us some cheap cabinets
[1:34:23] so
[1:34:24] we get a text from Katie Watkins and she
[1:34:27] was she happened to be at this Restore
[1:34:29] store it sells a bunch of household
[1:34:32] items for really cheap there was a full
[1:34:34] set of cabinets there and she was like
[1:34:36] these are really cheap nice set of
[1:34:38] cabinets if you guys want to come look
[1:34:40] at them
[1:34:41] so we went over there and looked and
[1:34:42] they ended up working out they were just
[1:34:45] under a thousand dollars
[1:34:47] so we got a full set of cabinets for
[1:34:49] just under a thousand dollars so I thank
[1:34:51] God for that
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:00] most of you probably know
[1:35:03] Monday evening around 5 30. my heart
[1:35:06] went out of rhythm
[1:35:08] and it was beaten at 140 to 143 beats a
[1:35:11] minute you couldn't get it to slow down
[1:35:14] and the doctor had given me medication
[1:35:16] to take in case that ever happened and I
[1:35:18] took all the medication I could take it
[1:35:20] still wasn't slowing it down
[1:35:22] so we kept praying and praying we went
[1:35:25] to bed
[1:35:26] at two o'clock it was seemed like it was
[1:35:28] getting worse and I woke right up and I
[1:35:31] said we've got to go to the emergency
[1:35:32] room this is not this isn't right it
[1:35:35] felt like my heart was quivering kind of
[1:35:36] like when you have a jerking muscle in
[1:35:38] your arm or something and it was beating
[1:35:40] really fast
[1:35:42] and so we went to emergency room we got
[1:35:44] in there and brother Andrew called was
[1:35:46] able to get us in quickly thank goodness
[1:35:48] and so he gets us in there and
[1:35:51] they start putting all these
[1:35:53] wires and everything all over me and
[1:35:56] they tell me that my heart is in what
[1:35:58] they call a flutter where it wasn't just
[1:36:00] running fast it was fluttering while it
[1:36:03] was going fast and
[1:36:05] I feel like I couldn't breathe sometimes
[1:36:07] and it was just a very scary situation
[1:36:09] and they said Dr smallheiser your heart
[1:36:13] doctor will be in in the morning but
[1:36:14] we're going to have to give you a
[1:36:16] certain kind of medicine they said we
[1:36:18] have five tubes of medicine we can give
[1:36:20] you to try to slow this down well they
[1:36:23] gave me two and it slowed it down to 84
[1:36:26] beats a minute but that's as slow as it
[1:36:28] would go so they put me in another room
[1:36:31] and it started going back up again I got
[1:36:34] up to go to the bathroom and it started
[1:36:36] going up again and it went back up to
[1:36:37] 140 again
[1:36:39] and so they put me back in bed and they
[1:36:42] gave me another
[1:36:43] syringe of that medicine it brought it
[1:36:46] back down to 84 and they said we're
[1:36:49] gonna have to give you another one and
[1:36:51] so they gave me another one still didn't
[1:36:52] bring it down past 84 it was still 84.
[1:36:55] and so they said we're gonna have to put
[1:36:57] you on a drip so they put me on a drip
[1:37:00] and all night my heart was racing
[1:37:03] anywhere from 80 it would go up to 108
[1:37:05] to 140 back down to 70 back up to 80. it
[1:37:08] was just all night long it was like this
[1:37:10] and so I started praying and I said Lord
[1:37:15] before Dr smallheiser gets here please
[1:37:18] give me a regular heartbeat
[1:37:21] and anybody walking past my room
[1:37:24] probably thought there was a crazy
[1:37:25] person in there because I just started
[1:37:28] praying out loud I didn't care who hurt
[1:37:30] me I didn't care what was going on
[1:37:33] around me all I knew was I needed help
[1:37:36] and every time my heart rate would go
[1:37:39] down to 60
[1:37:40] and it would be there for a couple of
[1:37:42] seconds it would go back up again and I
[1:37:43] would literally yell out at Satan and
[1:37:45] I'd say no you can't do this because I
[1:37:48] said you can't and Jesus gives me
[1:37:50] authority over it and you can't do this
[1:37:52] so stop it and I was literally yelling
[1:37:55] like that and I know if somebody walked
[1:37:57] past the room they probably thought a
[1:37:58] crazy person was in there but I did not
[1:38:00] care and finally at six o'clock I looked
[1:38:05] up at the Monitor and I noticed my heart
[1:38:07] wasn't doing that anymore and I thought
[1:38:09] maybe the drip kicked in or something I
[1:38:11] don't something's
[1:38:12] different
[1:38:14] and so
[1:38:15] um the doctor comes in at a little bit
[1:38:17] before seven and he looks at the Monitor
[1:38:20] and he looks at me and he's kind of a
[1:38:21] funny man he kind of cracks me up but
[1:38:23] he's kind of in his move sort of
[1:38:26] and it's very funny but he's looking at
[1:38:28] me and he looks at the Monitor and he
[1:38:29] looks at me again and he says nope
[1:38:31] that's not what's going on and he says
[1:38:33] your EKG says you were in a flutter but
[1:38:36] you're not you're having AFib and we got
[1:38:37] to fix this now so he leaves the room
[1:38:40] and then he comes back if or the nurse
[1:38:43] comes in a few minutes later and she
[1:38:45] goes
[1:38:46] you're in sinus rhythm she said you're
[1:38:48] perfect everything's fine and it hit me
[1:38:51] that before he came in there it was the
[1:38:54] prayer that I prayed that it was
[1:38:55] perfectly in Rhythm and it was an afib
[1:38:58] but they said that you could somehow
[1:39:00] have a fast heart rate and still be in
[1:39:02] sinus rhythm I don't understand how that
[1:39:03] works but anyways I was in sinus rhythm
[1:39:06] even though it was running a little bit
[1:39:07] fast so anyways
[1:39:10] um they admitted me into the hospital
[1:39:11] and I was praying and I said Lord I said
[1:39:14] I don't want to have to be in here I'm
[1:39:15] tired I want to go home to my own bed
[1:39:17] can you please fix it where I can go
[1:39:19] home tonight so they put me in there and
[1:39:21] they admitted me they changed me into a
[1:39:23] room they had me in there and they came
[1:39:25] in kept doing all the tests and all the
[1:39:27] things and they kept saying everything
[1:39:28] looks great you're fine everything's
[1:39:31] wonderful at I think it was at 12
[1:39:34] o'clock the nurse come in there and she
[1:39:35] said I don't know what's happened but
[1:39:37] she said they're allowing you to go home
[1:39:39] they said I was not expecting this at
[1:39:42] all and every doctor and nurse that came
[1:39:43] in there to look at me they said I was
[1:39:45] not expecting him to let you go home but
[1:39:47] he's letting you go home so I went home
[1:39:49] at two o'clock and I have been pretty
[1:39:52] much okay since I'm tired but I'm doing
[1:39:55] well and I thank the Lord for that and I
[1:39:57] thank you all for your prayers and I'm
[1:39:59] sorry I took so long talking about this
[1:40:00] but I really appreciate your all's
[1:40:03] prayers and and brother Jason was such
[1:40:05] an encouragement to me kept sending me
[1:40:06] text messages and encouraging me and I
[1:40:09] really appreciate that

[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:21] Matthew wanted me to this um
[1:40:25] Ashley I've got at least two maybe three
[1:40:27] a couple weeks ago maybe two or three
[1:40:30] months ago my elbow and arm was very
[1:40:33] inflamed
[1:40:35] and so much that I ordered a sleeve and
[1:40:38] I
[1:40:38] leave night and day and it didn't get
[1:40:41] better and I I believe in praying for
[1:40:43] myself it didn't get better and one
[1:40:46] night here at church I thought well call
[1:40:48] for the Elders of the church and all
[1:40:50] y'all came up remember where the Lord
[1:40:52] healed my arm
[1:40:54] but my back
[1:40:56] um most of you don't know a few of you
[1:40:59] do 17 years ago I had back surgery I've
[1:41:02] got rods in my back those rods have
[1:41:05] screws in them
[1:41:07] so here be four weeks tonight I got up
[1:41:11] on Wednesday morning I couldn't move I
[1:41:13] was in awful shape and so I kind of
[1:41:17] rested and got a little bit better and
[1:41:19] then I got worse
[1:41:21] Katie took me to the my regular doctor
[1:41:24] and he gave me a steroid shot and six
[1:41:28] days of steroids
[1:41:31] and an x-ray so then I said it was your
[1:41:34] back
[1:41:35] so I went to my orthopedic doctor
[1:41:38] and he done a back X-ray on me
[1:41:42] while I was in that doctor's office I
[1:41:44] got a call
[1:41:46] the family had been called in from my
[1:41:48] sister it wasn't very hard for me to
[1:41:51] lose most of you know my sister Jewel
[1:41:53] she was so happy to go and I'm thrilled
[1:41:56] for her but I sure miss her
[1:41:58] so anyway the doctor took an x-ray of my
[1:42:01] back the orthopedic he showed me the
[1:42:04] X-ray
[1:42:05] he called in the spinal surgeon that was
[1:42:08] there and they looked at the X-ray
[1:42:11] and in my rods in my back I have 10 rods
[1:42:15] the screws were out I could see them you
[1:42:18] know what a screw looks like when it's
[1:42:20] loose and it really bothered the doctor
[1:42:24] and he said well I was really hoping
[1:42:26] it'd be your help because that's his
[1:42:28] specialty
[1:42:30] he said but somehow another those screws
[1:42:32] have come out so I'm thinking
[1:42:34] oh my goodness what do you do with
[1:42:37] screws loosen your back and plus I had a
[1:42:41] pinched nerve and a few other things and
[1:42:43] so I was really concerned not another
[1:42:46] surgery I'm 82 years old that's
[1:42:50] so then then he sent me then to my spine
[1:42:54] doctor the one that done the surgery
[1:42:57] and I went to him
[1:42:59] and he done my
[1:43:01] back X right now I start therapy money
[1:43:04] and I hate therapy but I'm gonna go and
[1:43:07] I am so much improved I was able to come
[1:43:10] back to church
[1:43:12] so he took a back x-ray screws are back
[1:43:16] in place I do not have to have surgery I
[1:43:20] don't y'all prayed for me and I
[1:43:22] appreciate but the greatest thing
[1:43:25] I've had this burden on for my neighbors
[1:43:28] ever since I've been there the Lord's
[1:43:30] given me some of the best
[1:43:33] and the one that I've I pray for him

[1:43:38] to really talk to her that one goes to

[1:43:47] her but never got a change so today I've
[1:43:50] been taking it easy trying not to
[1:43:54] set myself back again because I asked

[1:44:03] so today I sitting out on the porch a
[1:44:06] little bit here she come

[1:44:43] I was with my nephew Seth today and we
[1:44:46] were trying to get my old janky truck
[1:44:48] running and uh we sat out there for like
[1:44:50] an hour in the hot sun trying to get it
[1:44:52] going and uh I I said Seth did you pray
[1:44:56] and he said yeah and I said I prayed too
[1:44:58] and he said uh and then I said brother
[1:44:59] Brandon said in the message presuming
[1:45:02] that uh that a man came to him and said
[1:45:05] brother bring him if you pray I'll uh he
[1:45:08] said I think you my truck will run just
[1:45:10] fine or whatever or it was his car or
[1:45:12] whatever and so he uh he prayed and he
[1:45:15] said brother Brandon said yes truck ran
[1:45:17] just fine and anyway uh so we sat there
[1:45:20] and sat there and kept trying to get it
[1:45:21] kept trying to get it holding the faith
[1:45:23] and anyway uh about the last time that I
[1:45:26] was going to try and start the truck I
[1:45:28] was about to leave and uh I went and
[1:45:29] turned the key in just as I did sass it
[1:45:35] literally right as he said and threw his
[1:45:37] arms up so I thought that was neat and I
[1:45:40] would share it so
[1:45:41] foreign
[1:45:46] from Brother Jack I was supposed to have
[1:45:49] brother Jack who's streaming and I was
[1:45:51] supposed to have him give this testimony
[1:45:53] Sunday and it totally slipped my mind
[1:45:55] and he texted me before you remember the
[1:45:57] man that we had uh prayer cloth that all
[1:46:00] the brothers came up here mother Jack
[1:46:01] had a friend brother Harry who had a
[1:46:04] brain tumor and brother Jack sister
[1:46:06] Kathy we're going to go down there and
[1:46:07] give brother Harry that that prayer
[1:46:10] cloth we prayed over and so there's a
[1:46:12] pretty miraculous testimony that came
[1:46:14] from that and so brother Jack was just
[1:46:17] wanted to share that how this man who
[1:46:20] started with a brain tumor uh turned
[1:46:23] into a brain infection couldn't talk
[1:46:25] couldn't uh do anything for a week and a
[1:46:27] half but God raised him up completely
[1:46:28] healed him and so brother brother Jack
[1:46:31] says brother Harry had a real bad head
[1:46:33] pain crying could not get relief
[1:46:35] ambulance went to pick him up at work
[1:46:37] took him to Brunswick Hospital found out
[1:46:39] he had a brain tumor took him to
[1:46:41] Savannah hospital they found out it was
[1:46:43] a brain infection had a tube on his
[1:46:46] throat he was like a dead man when I
[1:46:47] went to the hospital with with the
[1:46:49] prayer cloth and the angel of the Lord
[1:46:51] went before us I truly believe that and
[1:46:54] sister Kathy walk right in nobody
[1:46:56] checked us in we went right to him and
[1:46:58] prayed place the prayer cloth on him for
[1:47:01] a week
[1:47:02] in three days three days later he called
[1:47:05] me to talk to me and thanked me for
[1:47:07] having faith for him when he could not
[1:47:09] have faith for himself I told him it was
[1:47:12] the prayers of the whole body of Christ
[1:47:14] that man is now doing some speech
[1:47:16] Rehabilitation and he said brother Jack
[1:47:19] when I get out of here I'm coming to
[1:47:21] your church
[1:47:22] amen hallelujah Give the Lord a hand for
[1:47:25] that he says prayer no doubt and I
[1:47:28] believe this he says prayer no doubt is

[1:47:36] all things are truly possible for
[1:47:37] believers amen why don't we give the
[1:47:39] Lord another handful
