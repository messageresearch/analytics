individuals i believe he's living right here in each one of our hearts if you got the holy ghost so well here i am well joe got the call at 10 30 this morning [Laughter] well i better get home i thought i last week or so lord have been kind of dealing with me on uh time for deliverance but i said well okay i got that i can go ahead and have that ready and as i got home and got cleaned up and got a little about to eat and about two o'clock went and prayed and mine got changed so we're going to speak on instead of i'm time for deliverance we're going to speak on who's this man it's in your boat so if you have your bibles let's turn to mark chapter 4 verse 35 we'll read on down to verse 41. before we read let's uh let's approach the throne heavenly father lord we always counted a privilege and honor to be in your house lord father we just thank you for all that you do for us and that these doors are even open that we can come lord you see what i have before me lord you see what the people need lord i don't know but you don't i don't have to know but you know father you could take these words lord that any man can just stand up here and read and father you can make it come alive in their hearts lord i pray may you anoint my lips lord anoint their ears father we need you to come in this service father lord we're a needy people father if any one of us would just raise our hands we'd say god i have a need god you know what it is and we're counting on you to come tonight and just minister to each one father and we'll give you the praise in jesus name amen i'm not a very deep preacher you all know that so if you come to hear something deep just come back this weekend brother jason will be preaching so i am who i am and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there rose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest not carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and sea obey him may god have the blessings to his reading you have your seats so who is this man in your boat what manner of man that even the winds and the ways obey him but in order to see who he who he was you gotta we gotta go back we gotta go back to where there was no universe no star no atoms no molecules back before god was even god we know last week last wednesday brother joe mentioned a little bit about this but genesis said in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that was who's in that boat god the creator of the universe the one who spoke things into existence the self-existing one the one who was along with no one to worship him because we know god is an object of worship there was no one there so we created the angels and the cherubims to worship him they cry holy holy holy all day long worshiping god but that wasn't what he wanted that was part of it but he needed something further god created them brother branham said and this is a pretty lengthy lengthy quote but the fir in his question answered on genesis the first creation was god himself and then out of god came the logos which was the son of god then out of the logos which was the word out of the logos came forth the man oh i got a beautiful picture of my mind he says if you could take just a little trip let's take a little trip and go back a little while let's go back about 100 million years before there ever was a star moon or anything in the world there was time when there was nothing here it was just all forever and eternity and all of ever and eternity was god he was there in the beginning now no man has seen the father at any time no man can see god in bodily form because god is not in body form god is a spirit notice there's nothing just space no light no dark no nothing it just seems nothing but in there is this great supernatural being jehovah god who covered all space and all places of time he was from everlasting from everlasting he is the beginning of creation that's god you can't see nothing he can't hear nothing not a move of adam in the air nothing but yet god was there that was god no man has seen that that's the father that's god the father notice then after a while i began to see a little sacred light begin to form a little halo or something you could see only see it by spiritual eyes while we're looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what god's doing now no one has seen god he keeps saying this and now the next thing we see by the eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that the bible reader you know it is is logos or anointed or the anointing and i'm going to say the part of god began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of idea of what it was hallelujah was a little light moving that was the word of god john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god god gave birth to himself to this son which was before there even was an adam or heir to make an adam jesus says glorify me father hallelujah with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world hallelujah logos holy spirit and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god unfolding himself down to a human being now watch how he did it back there when this little halo comes he can't see nothing yet but just by eyes of just supernatural we see a halo standing there that's the son of god the logos now i can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door this is who's in your boat this evening did all of this with all eternity and then his imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be he thought of you he thought of what you're going to be he thought of what you're going to want to be hallelujah he had these attributes he he wanted to be a healer he want to be a savior he want to be a father oh he wants you to keep going on there's all kinds of things that god wanted to be but all of a sudden he said let there be light and we know what happened a little clinker come off of this logos and went down and god said let it drop for a few million years and all of a sudden he says stop is about the size of the earth dropped it in a perfect atmosphere and we know that the the planet earth is the only one that's named in this bible there's no other promise for no other planet adam bursted the sun came into existence she whirled for hundreds of millions of years forming little clinkers burning forming it is today still burning still breaking atoms watch beautifully says he made the sun then the first thing you know the big clinker fell off of it and just about the size of the earth which that's the logos here the son of god is watching it he he watched it dropping he just said stop hallelujah come on he's got something in his mind and what he's doing he's just writing his first bible oh when his first little clinker come off and it was earth god spoke to it let there be seed let there be water in a land and all let's let there be man he put adam on the earth this is who we serve this is who's in your boat hallelujah gotta get this thing off brother jason let me i take the tie off this is who jesus is that's the one you have in your heart he's the creator the very one who spoke things into existence in your life tonight oh hallelujah why do we worry why should we fear that very same jesus is standing right here all we have to do is open up our spiritual eyes and we can see it hallelujah glory to god why do you worry about a bill when the one who spoke let there be light can speak healing into your body if you're sick can bless your finances all you got to do is speak it that's the one in your boat oh am i loud i feel like i am are y'all trying to get me to calm down like brother j.d sorry brother i love you in the beginning it tells us that god had created the heavens and the earth god made this garden in eden he placed a man adam he gave adam authority he gave him authority he said i want you to name the animals oh this big gray thing came up with a big truck and hallelujah adam would say elephant this come by here he said a bear oh it's a tiger right there a little dog god was so pleased god said that's exactly what i would have called him hallelujah god would he created eve that god would come down in the garden in the evening time he would have church that's a little too much he would have church god likes to go to church in the evening time wednesday night is the highlight of my week maybe not tonight but use any other wednesday night it is but it's the highlight of the week i would want to miss what if god does show up we might miss something we might be like thomas doubting thomas he didn't show up that first church service after jesus rose he didn't believe him jesus breathed on him the holy ghost oh my what happens if you miss church so god word know where that comes from god come down in a garden to have church god loves fellowship brothers said god loved to come down and fellowship with his people hallelujah he would come down there and he's all his attribute god would say adam and eve did you enjoy your stay on the earth today god could come down and say chris did you enjoy your stay on the earth today how can we say yes with all the hell is breaking loose but you got jesus in your boat we live in spiritual spiritual places in christ jesus yes lord we've sure enjoyed our day there's still beautiful things on this earth we love to see oh god we come down and he'd tuck him in and kiss him good night call leo the lion the tiger they'll cuddle up with it what a perfect paradise god created this the creator living in you hallelujah this is who jesus is they had no worries about anything harming them now we can't even go out the door we don't know if he might stand outside with a gun or not one day we won't have to worry about that no more we know where sin is going sin is going to be in hell while we're celebrating in the millennium peace for a thousand years my mind can't comprehend that i can't comprehend a thousand years peace and millennium and then eternity after that hallelujah but we're only going to go back to the garden we got to fulfill that thousand years that the devil stole from them hallelujah there's no sickness no death no worries no sin nothing could bother them in that perfect place how long to go back there we're going one day all if the wind would come up he would go oh it's a little cool i would just say peace be still we'll hear that again later he had authority he had the same authority that god had we god spoke to the wind told it to calm down oh if you have god in your heart you have that same authority you have sickness speak to it hallelujah when it all seemed lost adam fell we know the story it had to happen because god had attributes he needed to redeem people adam and eve crying as he left no doubt god crying as he left seeing the lambskin slapping her legs and blood running down right before they got out the gate of the garden he stopped them said hold on a minute i'm gonna make a way for you to come back here and brother and sister we could be listed 12 hours away from a rapture to bring us back to there we could be three and a half years from that spot hallelujah but we know what happened four thousand years later the promise was fulfilled a virgin shall conceive and jesus was born of the spoken word the holy ghost they called his name jesus he wasn't born a woman he wasn't born from sex desire he was born of god hallelujah jesus mary was conceived by the holy ghost if you have been saved and baptized and filled with the holy ghost you're conceived the same way hallelujah okay that's the foundation now i'm ready to preach oh i forgot to turn my timer on but anyway you know jesus ministry back to our scripture jesus ministry he was in his early stages and he got preaching and he was healing and sick and casting out devils and raising the dead and these people they loved it because the miracles they were crowding and their story took place they were crowded and jesus had to step into a boat he had to get some air he couldn't breathe so jesus got his boat started preaching but he was tired he was a man man get tired i couldn't imagine how tired jesus was after he healed the sick all day and preached the gospel and all the things that he'd done that day right before he got in this boat i know how tired i am after 45 minutes an hour up here i couldn't imagine how tired jesus was i look they were they people were pulling on him to perform miracles they seen all that he done they seen him raise a dead man they seen him break the bread and feed five thousand they seen all the miracles oh they loved all that but we may find out if we get to it that he had to do something to get rid of half these people because they weren't seed but that's something else they were pulling on jesus pull to perform miracles he was very tired verse 36 we'll go back to that when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also other little ships the bible says they took him meaning they didn't prepare for the trip they didn't have time to go into town and buy food take clothes they didn't have time to get the right kind of boat according to history this boat these disciples got it that jesus had stepped in to preach was a fishing boat had the dips in the sides it wasn't made for going out on the sea on long trips especially in storms but god knows what he's doing hallelujah he knows what he's what disciples didn't know but in a spiritual realm jesus had heard a man across the river screaming for help oh he knew he would need his strength so jesus he just gets in the boat he goes back there and he just goes to sleep jesus tired he was needing his rest he would need his strength for what was coming across the sea a man was crying for help and jesus was going over there 30 37 there rose a great storm and the waves beat into the ship that it was now full but said i could see him that night crossing the sea oh my the waves are roaring why did that man take that chance after setting teaching all day and healing the sick and we find him now at that little ship coming across the sea because over in another land in gattera one soul was calling for him think across the sea in a mighty storm all through those dangerous perils as he went that night to save one soul to heal one person he'll come from one side of the lake through the storm all night long until the next day to storm that great tide that night to heal one person and he'll say i say this my brother he'll come down from glory this evening to set each one of you free that's right he'll come down through every church he'll go past every fanatic and every critic and everything else to heal you tonight or to make you right do you believe it if god was mindful of one man's need he will leave the throne tonight come down from glory and meet whatever you have need of it don't matter what it is god's in your boat this is a man all you got to do is cry out like the man from gatteri god heard him cry now this storm is a they call it a layla it's a wind that is suddenly whirled about upwards and downwards and it's said to be a storm it's like a hurricane the sea of galilee sits about 600 feet below sea level with mountains on both sides so you got hot air and cold air just swirling around and meeting and when that happens you have sudden storms i text brother jason he's talking about the weather earlier this afternoon and i was actually looking at this and all of a sudden there's a crash of thunder rain pouring against my house it's like where in the world that come from all of a sudden a storm appeared that's what this storm was all of a sudden you'll be able to see a gallery all cleared all of a sudden the storm up here you might say pretty sure i'm not going through no storm everything might be going good for you you might be healthy i don't want to say this you might even have your bills being paid on time you might be having everything going good i ain't going through no storm but wait one's a brewing there's a storm of brewing we got to be ready we got to be ready to call on jesus because there's a man in your boat brother charles but satan was mad he was a mad dude after a while jesus exposed him through the parables of the sower the seed he just told right before this telling who that sower the evil seed was and then cast him out of people he's pretty mad now he knows where jesus was going he had a man over named legion that had 2 000 demons on him he was going to try to stop jesus and everybody's in that boat but he couldn't satan said i have i have him and all his preachers in one little boat i'm going to sink them he's i can't let me across that water because if they do a maniac was going to be delivered he knowed he knowed he's going that that may not be delivered if jesus ever made it to him that devil may have tried to stop you from coming tonight he may have tried to put weather on this place to try to stop it we're here it don't matter what you faced you're here you have arrived hallelujah the devil may have tried to stop you because he knows if you do you'll be set free hallelujah he tried to sink that boat disciples got scared they had forgotten who was asleep in the boat they had forgotten what jesus had told them get in the boat we're going to the other side they forgot all about that during this storm when a storm hits you don't forget it jesus says we're going to the other side hallelujah be ready they had lost their faith they'd forgotten the creator was asleep in the boat creator might be sleeping in your boat tonight like i said a little bit ago things might be going good but when the ways all you got to do is cry out to jesus the storm was a raging psalms 89 said doubt rules the raging of the sea and when the waves thereof rise doubt stealest them the storms were rages the disciples forgot who they had in the boat the same one they seen heal the sick the same one they seen raise a dead boy the one that seemed working all kinds of miracles they had forgotten that all they had all they could recognize they had the remedy right there in the boat that's who this person was a remedy for every storm a remedy for everything i know i did this a few months ago but i love this definition of remedy i'm here just refresh your memory anyway definition it's a medicine an application a treatment that relieves or cure disease something that corrects it or counteracts the legal means to recover a right or prevent obtain redress for a wrong to cure relieve or heal to restore it back to your natural or proper condition oh this jesus is here to restore us back to what we were before the foundation of the world i believe he already has the soul he's returned this back he's gonna restore you back to where you were at the beginning though a thought in god's mind predestinated seed of almighty god he's the remedy for the new birth that's who jesus is hallelujah verse 38 he was in the hinder part of the boat asleep on a pillow and they awaken and said unto him master carousel not that we perish now the sudden they decide they're going to call on him hallelujah they tried to do everything themselves with the storm hit no doubt they had their buckets out getting the water out getting the water out i was they just realized i can't do this i can't do this on my own i'm going to see peter probably if i look over john says hey bro we can't do this oh hold on a minute there's somebody in here that can in your darkest hour call on jesus he'll arrive on the scene that's the darkest hour for lazarus one day maybe not for lazarus but for his for his family lazarus was dead they caught on jesus what'd he do he raised him up lazarus was dead four days lazarus come forth dead man rose up you might be dead in sin jesus spoke your name one day brother luther said come forth oh it was a darkest hour for daniel when he got thrown in the lines then are we facing any lines today it ain't four-legged there's all kinds of lions out here after you there's a line of judah after you as well surrender surrender to him they threw daniel in these hungry lions then daniel's he was already prayed up he didn't have to pray right then he just steps in and god shuts the lion's mouth let's all be prayed up for storms hit us we won't have to worry about it god is already on the scene don't let him fall asleep in your lives there's a pill or a fire in the building that'll wake you up that'll set you on fire make you lively hallelujah three hebrew children one day it was dark for them you're going to bow down to this image if you don't we're going to throw you in here oh the nebuchadnezzar's going to give him another chance he's sitting totem when the music sounds go ahead and bow down i like these three hebrew children's response we're not careful on what we say to you we don't even have to talk to you nebuchadnezzar we ain't going to waste our breath throw us in there who showed up whoo jesus he showed up on the scene that's the same today jesus is going to show up on the scene you've got children's lost jesus is here commit unto him hallelujah or i don't know what happened to my handkerchief oh it's my pocket this is who jesus is god in the flesh he went through everything you went through everything he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women popularity hebrews 4 14 seeing that then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin in that flesh body he wanted to know what you felt like he won't know what a little baby felt like when he burned up with a fever that way he could have compassion on them when you pray god heal my baby he knows what it's like he knows what it's like to feel alone you don't feel like you got a friend in the world jesus knows how you feel jesus is the best friend any man can have hallelujah jesus even grown with a headache i know how that feels i get them but jesus gives a headache so he can heal you he got sick so he knows how you feel so he can have compassion for you to heal you when you're tempted god will help you through that but temptation doesn't come from god they come from the devil james 1 13 said let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil nor tempted he any man you're tempted by every man who's drawn away on his own lust and enticed brother i'm saying god in his word god doesn't tempt men but god tries men test them god cannot tempt you but contest you and every son that cometh to god must be tested and child trained before he can be a son disciples finally realize wake up jesus verse 38 again and he said in the inner part of this he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pill and they awake him and said master don't you care that we perish they should see the water coming in can't you see the storm's coming in we're going to die here jesus he was a man when he was laying in that ship that night so tired that the waves were so big they didn't wake him i believe ten thousand devils of the sea swore to drown him the little boat was tossed around like a stopper a little piece of cork on the water the devil says i got him now and he was a man laying there asleep and when he woke up and put his foot on the brow of the boat looked up towards heaven and said peace be still and the winds and the ways obeyed him that was more than a man that was god he was a man when he he was hungry give me something to eat they brought him little fishes and loaves of bread he was god until he took those br he was man he took those bread he become god and fed five thousand he was a man at the well thirsty when he told the woman bring me a drink he was god when he saved her soul from hell hallelujah he was a man when he stepped up to lazarus grave weeping jesus wept but he stood up there and throwed his throat his shoulders back and said lazarus come forth that was god glory to god he was a man in the garden of gethsemane he was a man when he went got beaten he was a man when he crucified him oh my word he took those beatings for you for each one of us he took those beatings for you for your sin for your sickness for everything you go through yet he spoke not a word that was a man he was a man when he said i give up my i give i command into my hands i commend my spirit as a man but as god on the third day the tomb opened up here come a god who conquered death hell and the grave that you can stand free tonight free from every cane free from every sickness oh when he died at calvary scream for help that was man but when he rose up on easter morning that proved he was god i'm going to read this brother brahm you're excited he says you get born again you'll feel the same way don't worry if you want to jump up run around go ahead i ain't going to stop you when he wants to rouse asleep out of his eyes they woke him he put his foot upon the brow of a boat when he arose and rebuked the wind and set unto the sea peace be still amen i love this word steel the word means muzzle glory to stop the mouth [Music] make speechless reduce to silence to keep in check to become speechless what do you do to a horse that bites you or dog you put a muzzle on them right so you got a devil whispered in your ear we do what jesus did put a muzzle on him hallelujah shut the mouth of the devil shut him up he don't need to be talking to us i wonder how long he's got muzzling i got 32 more pages muzzling don't worry don't get scared i've only gone through eight put a muzzle on him shut the devil up he says you can't get healed shut up devil hallelujah you have a right to put a muzzle on him and then put your foot on him you know how i am about feet i like my foot on the deck of the devil i don't want him up so i'm gonna put a muzzle on him and i'm gonna put my foot on him he can't get up or talk whoo the same one who said let there be light it was the same god and said peace be still the devil knows the maker he knows who the creator was as soon as he spoke still where the devils go then where'd they go they went back to hell where they belong that's what you got to tell him tonight tell the devil where to go send him back where he belongs whoo hallelujah you got to speak and muzzle the devil and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it you have no faith he just walked back laid back down went back to sleep let's just wake him up for a few minutes to meet your need wake him up brother priest says go away jesus let's go wake him up when that man himself left the heavens with the entire solar system was his crown every billion stars that hung in the earth every star that's millions of miles beyond when they look through that glass out yonder they could see a hundred and twenty million years of life space this was brother random he said i'll follow that now all those billions and billions of stars was his crown and he left them to take a crown of thorns who would do that what man would do that nobody but god did it eternal was his robe he was rode with eternal life he never had a beginning and he he didn't start in bethlehem he had no beginning rolled with eternal life and just pushed it aside to take on an old dirty robe of earth to become human for you and i this was a man that was in the boat that's what manner of man this is this is the kind of man that you want in your boat if you don't have him get him there's room in john 6 35 jesus will tell you who he is i am the bread of life and he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst and i say unto you that ye also seen me and believe not talking to him all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out it don't matter it don't matter how low down you are a lot of us know a lot of us were low down god stooped all the way down to pick you up and he'll do the same thing this evening he says for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which has sent me of all which he had given me i should lose nothing hallelujah but should raise it again in the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which saith the son are you looking and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i'll raise him up in the last days seven times in this book of john where jesus said of himself jesus knew who he was i am i am the bread of life he told moses who he was just telling moses that i am that i am the same i am that spoke with moses the same i am that walk the shores of galilee meaning not only i am what i am at present but i am what i have been i am what i shall be and shall be what i am [Music] think about that one for a while [Music] he was a pillar of fire that led the children of israel out of egypt this is who's in your boat he crossed the sea and the disciples have been very weary and he's still to see for them crossed all the way over to gattera where there was a maniac taking the chance of crossing the stormy sea where the devils of the sea swore that drowning but he went over there in a cry of one person one poor maniac had lost his mind perhaps was a good man one time walked up right before god but probably got in the wrong crowd maybe started drinking or something lost his mind simple as that and now he lives out in the tombs 2 000 demons on him when i couldn't get to him he came to me you couldn't get to him you can't come here and say one day i grabbed on the hold of these steps of this altar and i sought god no more like god grabbed you and throwed you down here at the altar i couldn't come to you lord but you sure came to me and i thank him for it hallelujah and they mark chapter five verse one and they came over to the other side of the sea into the country of the gatherings and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwells among the tombs and no man could bind him not with chains because they had that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains have been plucked asunder by him how strong is that the prophet said he had the man had a wife and kids but he got hanging around the wrong crowd got one devil on him another one another one he kept playing around with them you imagine what a man would look like with 2 000 demons on him lord have mercy that devil's a real being he'll like nothing better than to destroy you listen young people he'll lock at nothing better to destroy you don't let him [Music] he sees what you make in the mood of god he'll try to discourage you but don't let him put a muzzle on him oh but every now and then this man would come to himself and cry out for help and those demons would take over no doubt it's probably this moment that he came to himself that jesus had hurt him i got to get to him he would be naked and running around the tombs that's what happened when demons get on you makes me wonder what's on these people is running around these streets naked they got demons on them if a man it was so possessed could break chains what can a man do that's filled with a holy ghost what kind of power lives inside of you there's more power living in you than they were on him two thousand demons bruh said if a man possessed with an evil spirit could break chains what can he do if he was completely surrendered to god with the power of god possessing him like that he could straighten every crippled leg he would do great things if he could just be so anointed with god's power god let me be anointed with that power did you notice the devil was so completely ahold of that man until he even confessed jesus oh my we know who you are holy one of god who cometh to torment us before our time but if we get so completely surrendered god till he can use your tongue to speak in other languages to preach the gospel to sing the gospel to speak with visions that we're looking at and the mysteries of god if we just completely surrender to the power of god and if the devil can get a manner his control and do that what can god do with one under his control my goodness verse five always day and night he was in the mountains and the tombs and crying and cutting himself with stones and when jesus saw when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him he'll make the devil worship him every day is going to bow every tongue is going to confess that jesus christ is lord oh the devil pleasers one god they believe in tremble and they confess that jesus of nazareth who was born of the virgin according to human nature as the son of god according to the divine nature wow where'd i get that at i'm gonna read that again the devils believe there is one god and tremble at him and they confess that jesus of nazareth who was born of a virgin according to the human nature is the son of god according to his divine nature and cried out with a loud voice what have i do to thee jesus thou son of the most high god amen i jersey by god don't torment me the demons recognized who jesus was in other versions of this they said have you come to torment us before our time they've read the back of the book they know what happened don't destroy us before our time and when jesus told the storms peace be still the disciples were slow to recognize the sonship of god disciples wondered what kind of man this is the devil even seeing jesus walking up out of the boat up on the shore knew exactly who he was it didn't take him long the devils recognized him that was recognized him that he was jesus that threw him out that threw lucifer out of heaven he wanted to be like the most high leave us alone luke's version what have we do with these thou jesus of nazareth or thou come destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god recognize who he is hallelujah the devils believe in tremble the demons also recognize jesus as the one who someday will judge and punish them mark 5 8 for he said unto them come out of a man thou unclean spirit and when he asked him what is thy name he answered my name as legion for we are many so jesus wasn't talking to the man himself the man couldn't tell him who his name was but the devil spoke out of him i'm legion there's two thousand of me in here no doubt jesus probably just laughed at him really that's all two hundred thousand demons been released out of the river euphrates upon this bride is that all you got jesus in your boat is that all why shouldn't you worry we have nothing to fear from that devil i might be like brother matthew i might wake up in the morning with a with a infection that's why he preached on sunday or done sunday school who cares i ain't gonna fear no devil he's under our feet hallelujah that's what happens when we get full of the devil the devil controls you he'll tell you where you're going oh you're going to go over here you're going to drink this much you're going to smoke this much you're going to boogie woogie all the things you want to do that's what devil does he's got to control your body what happens when jesus gets control i'm standing right here what do you what are you going to do with jesus control your body you might speak in tongues you might you might run around the building you might start stomping around how many be willing to do it brother aaron get up start stomping the devil that's what my brother jason let's do it jericho march let's show the dad we're afraid of no emotion it ain't about emotion we'll get up running around with the best wrestlings but we'll sit here and cry what can god do with you with your under the power of the holy ghost they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover not might they shall recover mercy i'm feeling good i'm skipping don't worry revelation 23 tells us what happens it's a bomb was pit so the devils know where they're going and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key in the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent the devil satan he's going to call him everything he's a dragon he's a serpent he's a devil he's satan bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up that's later isaiah god tells lucifer where he's going you're going to the bombest pit you want to be exalted but i'm going to put you down you're going all the way down recognize who you who's living in your boat you might be a little boat you might be a big boat but god's in it it don't matter my rebrand said notice when that man that maniac was so completely surrendered to god surrender to say i'm sorry satan used his tongue and said we're legion she said who are you and the man couldn't speak himself satan spoke through him we are legions for we are many jesus just simply said hold your peace and come out of him and when the maniac was healed the devil said the devil says well don't send us back to the abyss we still have a few more people we want to torment they knew it wasn't their time to be destroyed but let us go into the hogs that's what we used to be we used to be running around like a bunch of hogs that'll be good and there was nine to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter them and for with jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep hill steep place into the sea they're about two thousand and we're choked in the sea the devil's helpless unless he has a body to work in i think the hogs have more sense than some of us has got some of us will hard harvest a demon of addiction no matter what it is don't matter what it is we won't get rid of it at least the hogs had systems that jump off a cliff and kill themselves i'm not saying go jump off those cliffs but there's a way we can get rid of the devil don't jump off the cliff just jump on rock jesus that'll take care of everything whatever demon it is it don't care if it's rock and roll i don't care if it's alcohol or cigarettes or pornography or country music or christian rock or whatever demon is on you step up on jesus you say why you say the bad ones well go say gossip do anything contrary to god's word step on jesus it's all a devil and when the and there that fed the swine told in the city in the country they went out to see what was done and they come to jesus we don't want you here you're nothing but trouble you just our livelihood just drowned in the sea maybe they wanted what was on them hogs those demons could have easily left left legion and went right to them people they didn't think of that did they jesus he'll leave if he's not invited he'll go that's what i have when jesus comes on scene to get we get our right mind jesus comes in your boat you'll get in your right mind you'll clean up you'll put your clothes on you kick out your televisions think about it kick out your televisions it ain't the big screen you got in your room it's these little bitty ones right here that nobody knows what you look at in the stillness of the night kick them out somebody knows verse 16 and when they saw it told them how it fell to him who was possessed with the devil and also conservative swine they begin to pray get out of here leave our coast we don't want you here you won't know how powerful god is in the book of luke it tells us how powerful our god is and what god does to the devil luke 11 20 but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you the finger denotes power that's how puny the devil is tonight one finger god can cast out a devil

got a demon of sickness demon of lust whatever it is just flip it there's power there's power in the finger of god with one finger i could cast out a devil they shall lay hands on the sick you said you said that before yeah i did they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we're going to say he was cast out evil spirits and heal the sick and jesus said they said you're blaspheming because they say he has a devil when he was healed and sick how can satan cast out satan if satan cast out satan his kingdom his kingdom's just but he said if i cast out satan we're to know it's by the finger of god i've seen satan cast out by a finger before come out of the boy guess what the demon left there's power in finger the devil's being boned you had some kind of temptation to do wrong just take your little finger just flip it just flip him away get out of here devil we don't want you she said i've cast out devils by the finger of god i'll just take his finger and say get away devil

heaven and earth belongs to me in heaven and earth belongs to me we have jesus in your boat let's bow our heads melchizedek the same god is in you if you have the holy ghost people people you work
