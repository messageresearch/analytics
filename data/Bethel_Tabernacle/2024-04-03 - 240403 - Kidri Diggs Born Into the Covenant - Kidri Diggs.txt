not I'm your brother nothing you can do about it amen so we thank God amen it's such a uh pleasure always being here with you amen and and uh knowing that the spirit of God is Among Us that's what's important amen um before I get into preaching I was reminded to remind you guys that Jesus Christ Tabernacle that's your sister Church in Colombia we're having a a a family camp with youth and family and you know it's this coming June June 6 through the 9th you know and the registration deadline is May the 9th everybody got it June 6 through the 9th deadline May 9th and if you don't have the website it's www. JCT camp.com amen now that the preliminaries out of the way let's just pray and we'll get right into the word of God how many got a need tonight amen I got plenty I got a God who can answer every one of them Lord Jesus father we love you tonight and we thank you for all things Lord God we know that you're more than able Lord to touch every need in this place Lord Lord to meet every desire in this place Lord Lord we ask that you will just shift us right now Lord shift us to desire what you have for us and not what we would will for ourselves Lord but what you would will for us because the word of God says in that most crucial moment that crucial Time of Your Life Lord you said not my will be done but thine will and if you can do it as God being God and there's no one greater than you and Lord you didn't know any sin but you were carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders Lord and in that moment the flesh wanting to bow out and bow down lord you said not my will but thy will be done and Lord pray event there may be someone in here tonight whose flesh or situations of Life Family Life or whatever it may be is trying to get them to bow out but Lord if we could just say not my will but thy will be done Lord and in that moment we we were knowing through the scriptures that you gave him strength in that moment moment because he put your will first so Lord as we put your will first Lord we pray that just like you did in that moment send us strength Lord send strength to the one who's troubled in their mind Lord that needs peace trouble Lord send strength to the one Lord who may be sick in their body or whatever the case may be Lord or just tired in life Lord Lord we just pray that you would just add to us tonight Lord add unto our stature Lord Lord all the things that you've already given us before the foundation of the world Lord Lord help us to tap into it and receive it by Faith Lord Lord we pray that you continue to bless this church Lord and the pastor Lord and his family and church family Lord and all those connected to the ministry that's taken place Lord God and we just love you Lord and father we just pray Lord that our mindset would be to receive of you Lord not to reason with you but just to receive of you and Lord help us all to practice the greatest gift tonight Lord that's getting out of your way in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray church say amen amen praise the Lord you know tonight by the grace of God let's turn to um let's turn to uh I want Genesis chapter 12 Genesis chapter 12 Genesis 12 and verse one the Bible says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed somebody say Amen let's go to Hebrews chapter 6 Hebrews 6 and I just want to read uh let's just read verse 13 Hebrews 6 and 13 the Bible says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessings I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the Hees of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible somebody say impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold unto the Hope set before us amen may the Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seats by the grace of God Amen praise the Lord Lord you know tonight by the grace of God I want to uh use for a subject Born Into The Covenant Born Into The Covenant now I I I sent something to the booth I I hope you got it because I kind of want to start with this you know if when we look at uh Abraham you know we know the prophet talked about Abraham and he said there was nothing special about Abraham you know he until that time the calling of God he wasn't looked upon to be somebody great or had great statue or come from a powerful Rich family none of that the thing of God calling Abraham he had to you know why because he was elected Hallelujah see election separates everything Hallelujah no matter where you are and where you come from election puts you into something that you may not be aware of Hallelujah see and in this in this day Hallelujah you take one of the greatest elections that we have is uhh what they call the presidency Hallelujah and everybody get together and they vote for who they would think would be best and you know all they they look for character and they see who telling lies and all these things it's not so with God hallelujah hallelujah there's nobody that can put you in this and there's nobody that can take you out of Hallelujah because you're born into it by the grace of God hallelujah and you know Church what I love about the Covenant of God it it doesn't matter hallelujah what somebody may think of you it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter where you come from it doesn't matter how you look it's all about God's grace all right Hallelujah and what I love about the Covenant of God you can be born into something that you don't even believe right now wow Hallelujah imagine that Hallelujah most of us we're born into a family Hallelujah and the moment you're born into it you don't really know who your mother and father is you're just born into a family and as you grow and and you get to know the touch of a mother Hallelujah there's something inside of you that connects to what that Covenant right W Hallelujah the Covenant there between a mother and a child Hallelujah there's something in her in an unseen real that just connects with that child without her even trying motherhood just comes out there's a there's a a there's a fragrance Hallelujah there's a certain responsibility that just comes out of her because it's a covenant and that child is born into that Hallelujah now I'mma hit some things I want y'all to catch them Hallelujah that child brother Virgil being born into that that child doesn't have to in that moment of being born reach back look back at Mama and say mama love [Laughter] me the mother just automatically does it it's a part of the birth it's a part of being born in that family that love just comes out Hallelujah that child doesn't say in that moment of mommy mommy I messed myself no Hallelujah mommy is looking for that child to make boo boos all right just so she can have the opportunity to clean it up that's if you a real mother notice I ain't got to the fathers yet Hallelujah but that's a part of the Covenant Hallelujah and you as a child you're born into that I see why God wanted me to Freestyle tonight go ahead Hallelujah cuz you know I was coming down the road and it never fails I'm trying to figure out which way I'm going go and what I'm going do Hallelujah and God just kept born into a covenant born into a covant born into a covenant say yeah yeah God I know that I know that but give me some more give me some more give me some more where's the rest of it it's in you Hallelujah this message tonight it's in you it's born in you Hallelujah and if you pull it'll come out of me hallelujah hallelujah what is it it's a connection it's a covenant hallelujah oh my in church you take the birth of that child Hallelujah and and and the connection between that mother and that child in that moment Hallelujah no matter no matter how the child looks no matter how the child smell there's something about the Covenant between that child and that mother that mother automatically becomes a protector W Hallelujah she becomes a provider she becomes a shield a banner Hallelujah and and she conducts if she breastfeeds she conducts her body a certain way that it brings forth strength W all of that is given into the child when it's born it's a part of the Covenant and nobody can change it Hallelujah she's built like that and even Hallelujah uh fathers we ain't going to leave you out Hallelujah you know even that father he Taps into some of the same Covenant it's not a different Covenant Hallelujah in that moment of the birth you can see that father he's been waiting on the child all that time now he looks at that child and he sees himself on Hallelujah he looks at that child and he sees his seed his life Hallelujah everything that he is now is there reflected before him why because the life that germatize the seed comes from the father Hallelujah and now Church Hallelujah is given unto that child whether he likes it or she likes it or not and I know some of you girls might not like it but you look just like your father hallelujah it's your fault I look like this the attributes comes from the father they just willingly ooze out Hallelujah whether you like it or not certain habits Hallelujah certain characteristics things that comes out it comes from the father Hallelujah only thing we don't want sisters from you to get your father we don't want you to get their voice but when it comes to the spiritual realm we want the same voice as the father hallelujah it's a part of the Covenant Hallelujah we want to speak as our father speaks we're born into it hallelujah oh my I hope you catching me and just like the mother the Covenant it applies with the Father the father he learns how to care he learns how to protect he learns how to provide he does all the things and I know some of you still say no he don't either Hallelujah he does some of the same things that the mother would do why because it's under the same Covenant you're born into it Hallelujah now we look at the things of God we go back to God and his children I ain't gonna be long y'all know I'm about to close you go to God and his children man was born under a covenant he was born into a covenant Hallelujah but church we have to reflect we have to go back and look at the Covenant I think sometimes we lose track of what rights we really have because of the birth hallelujah or the family of God we're born into Hallelujah there are certain things that just comes along with it that you don't earn that you didn't work for Hallelujah not no certain stat is is because you're born into it Hallelujah you can't work yourself into it Hallelujah and you can't work yourself out of it Hallelujah right now we got children our own children that may have made mistakes and done things that they shouldn't have done but they're still a part of the family amen hallelujah no matter what my child may do Hallelujah once a digs always a digs some of y'all ain't catch that one I'm not talking about me Hallelujah I'm talking about be born into the family of God hallelujah once a child of God always a child of God and the enemy can't stop that he go accuse and say oh they did this say oh they they did that they did that and God said I don't see it why cuz there's Mercy in the Covenant but you look Church man was born into something whether he lik it or not Hallelujah when man when Adam was first created Hallelujah God gave him dominion over everything told him be fruitful and multiply but the part of the Covenant God say all right now the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil don't touch it see he put them under a covenant Hallelujah he said don't touch it or you should surely die that's what God told him and one thing about God God is always going to hold up his end of the Covenant God is all oh my I feel like I feel like I got to say this Hallelujah the Covenant is not a bargaining God is Not bargaining with us hallelujah it's a commandment Hallelujah and he he will uphold his side you know why because he knows you can't uphold your side oh my what an agreement what a if I could say we are under a spiritual contract with God hallelujah let me read something to you right quick this is in the message uh The God Who is rich in Mercy isn't he by eight of you isn't he the God so rich in Mercy Church if the microscope was put Upon Our Lives today Hallelujah and and and and in that moment God say I'mma reward you for the life you live today how many of us will be rewarded for good right now this day if if if God put us under microscope and he said Hallelujah you reap what you sow hallelujah hallelujah how many of us will be reaping heaven today that's how special this Covenant is with God even when we don't deserve it Hallelujah God continues to show us his grace even when we are not worthy his word Hallelujah makes us worthy cuz he told Abraham Hallelujah I will establish in you God's going to do it Abraham made plenty of mistakes Hallelujah probably probably probably said some things he should have said but God stayed firm w we have a God who stays firm and I don't know about you but sometimes I go through the Bible and I look and I see what different ones did did and I said God you gave him Mercy for that oh Lord I Thank You for Your Grace Hallelujah Lord I Thank You for Your Grace a lie ain't nothing for God to forgive cuz he did it already Hallelujah adultery ain't nothing for God to forgive cuz he did it already Hallelujah a cheater a murderer a skunk God already forgave it so you are not to be depressed you are not to be in your stage of mourning you are to be rejoicing cuz there's a covenant that your sins cannot change Hallelujah there's a covenant Hallelujah that puts the devil exactly where he's supposed to be now I'm not making room for a laxidasical life or somebody who's just out there floating and I don't feel like serving you when they should be in church they at home watching me on their television yeah where the camera at I'm talking to you you had ample time to get here but there's something H Hallelujah about knowing you're in a covenant with God you want to be in his presence you think about the one that you know has forgiven you when you want to see him as much as you can when you Hallelujah when you want to hear his voice as much as you can when you want to feel his touch as much as you can what are you saying brother that's how I feel about church whenever I got the opportunity to be there by God's grace I want to be there not because things have become convenient Hallelujah church I want you to I want you to understand something the time we in the Bible says hallelujah there's a way there's a straighten narrow way and then there's a Broadway the Broadway is getting easier and easier to take Hallelujah and you could be on that broad path and not even realizing because there's so much convenience in the world hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you something if you a person Hallelujah who maybe maybe at one point you know you was you was involved in church you you know he being used and then you got a job or whatever the case is and you're not there as much you better be careful cuz that's the enemy slowly stripping you pulling you away from Hallelujah your inheritance one thing about inheritance is yours but you got to fight for it because it's a part of the Covenant Hallelujah but look Church in this message he says he says many many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was a god somewhere yet you were a sinner Hallelujah while you was a sinner there was something in you craving more of God what was it it was what he put in you it was the Covenant Hallelujah that said no matter how great Sin is Sin will not be able to stop you from connecting to me you know what I like to say yeah I I don't know the name of that dance but you know that dance where they where they dance is old old school dance I ain't talking about the stuff that y'all kids now days you know I ain't talking about none of that it's a old school dance where the husband and wife are dancing and and It Go you put a rose in her mouth and you dip can you imagine you're God's special lady Hallelujah with a rose in your mouth and he let you Dance with the Devil firsto God let us each and every one of us Dance with the Devil first amen I know you think about not me born in the message you born in sin You Dance with the Devil first he he serenad you he danced with you he even dipped some of us and some of you ain't got over that dip yet still can remember the time oh my but look church I like that y'all know I'm a man of drama so I like to dramatize Hallelujah you know for those of you people who say I ain't never heard brother brandom say that and you never will you never will Hallelujah but let me tell you something we under the same Covenant hallelujah hallelujah it's is still the same inspiration given by the same God hallelujah W Hallelujah sometimes Church the prophet will not be here to cosign what's being said you have to believe it by faith Hallelujah although we do search through the message to look for that inspiration but you know Hallelujah We Dance with the Devil he he s we had the road we oh we dipping in everything but the thing that Satan didn't realize God was watching the whole dance Hallelujah and he was nearby Hallelujah and God saw his lady dancing with another man W Hallelujah and the Bible says God is jealous over you Hallelujah and God looked at his elected lady in the arms of another man and God came forward and say excuse me can I cut in Hallelujah now I don't know about y'all Hallelujah but it's up to the woman to say yes Hallelujah the man in that moment has no control it's her body it's her life and I I don't know about you Hallelujah although I was wrapped in the devil's arms when God came and said excuse me can I cut in it was just something about the way he said it there was something inside that just connected to that voice although this was our first time meeting there was something inside of me that said I want to know more about this [Applause] man Hallelujah and I don't know about you but I said yes cut in and I've been dancing from that moment up until now that I haven't got enough Chris every dance is like the first dance and I'm not teaching him he's my instructor so he's teaching me moves that I've never known before hallelujah oh my [Applause] glory he's cut in for us to never go back and Dance with the Devil again Hallelujah listen he said there be certain things that would bother you and other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were at Center I love that Hallelujah why because it deals with the Covenant H there was something in you crying out even though you were in sin what was it it was the memory from the Covenant of being a god let's understand something Hallelujah Adam Hallelujah was born under Covenant Hallelujah not in sin Adam wasn't born in sin Adam was born with the likeness and image of God with the character of God the nature of God hallelujah so when sin came in it left Adam with a remembrance of what it was like to control the world that's why we crave Supernatural things how many want to go to heaven that's not coming from your flesh that's coming from the Covenant you was born into Hallelujah that's that inward man Hallelujah that will were born in the image of likeness of God craving what he once had and Adam Hallelujah born Hallelujah with the nature and likeness of God When sin came in he left Hallelujah remember catch this he left the Garden of Eden with a remembrance of what was in his contract cuz you know a covenant is a contract hallelujah hallelujah and Adam left out of the garden remembering was in his contract Hallelujah I'm going give you a little one onone in in real estate real quick Hallelujah you know when you take a contract you may have a seller and a buyer Hallelujah but both of those guys you can Hallelujah have an agent Hallelujah and it's the agent's job Hallelujah to get that client Hallelujah the best for that client hall hallelujah and what he does he doesn't share any unwillful information with the opposite side because his job or her job is to get the best deal possible or getting the best contract possible for their buyer or seller Hallelujah so let's just say for is you have a house a house for right now houses are ridiculous oh you got a house for uh 350 that used to be a house on the waterall used to be not no more you can't even hard to get your feet wet now with that much you got there the water hole oh I got lakefront property drain don't work only lake front you going to get for 350 unless you move to Mayberry Hallelujah but you take Hallelujah you take a a a price 350 all right and let's just say the seller he he wants to get a full 350 so he puts it out there he said I want 350 but then there's a buyer who sees the house and just falls in love he says I got to have this house Hallelujah now real Faith Hallelujah I'm going tell you what real faith is you got somebody in your church right now who wanted a house that wasn't theirs but they wouldn't set in the driveway and start praying about it got Hallelujah we in a driveway and say Lord I want this house I want this house I want the prop they didn't know everything that came with the house they just looked at the house and say I want the house Hallelujah the house was somebody was already staying in the house the house is already bought and sold and it was supposed to be passed down the family but faith can stop all that some of y'all looking like I wonder who it is I I ain't going to put that business out but if you close to the family you know who I'm talking about Hallelujah see these are un un unheard of testimonies that are here in our church but we don't even know about it cuz we should be connecting on a supernatural level because no doubt there somebody here right now trying to buy a house so you need this testimony or maybe getting a house built or they didn't told you your credit ain't right or whatever Hallelujah she went sat in the driveway Lord Lord Jesus father God I drove off went back home she was crazy enough to do it again oh Jes and again and again and again till she got the house oh Lord they got the house I should say hallelujah but Church you think about it it's a deal that has to be set on both ends so this person the seller he might everybody all right the seller might say I want 350 and the buyer say well I ain't got 350 but uh let's negotiate now one thing you don't want to do you don't want to test that person's Integrity they looking for a deal and you come to the table with foolish thoughts ah well maybe I'll offer them a hundred 350,000 to 100 don't disrespect me like that and sometimes we disrespect God like that Hallelujah God says I can give you the world if you would only believe I can give you the world if you would just only pay your ties Hallelujah but some of you say no I got to give this 100 to SC and G or Dominion when there are thousands and there are hundreds of thousands that God wants to bless you with and all you can think about is this hundred if I can oh my somebody must be creeping a little bit brother Jason somebody holding on to it h let me tell you take it out your wallet of your pocket and put it where it's supposed to be see I wouldn't be preaching on us if you wasn't having condescending thoughts and what are your condescending thoughts your consisting thoughts is I'm going to make a real plain do I want to be blessed or cursed because you P you bless if you don't you curse and you come to church say oh Lord I'm believing for a blessing and didn't pay your ti you might well shut up and sit down cuz you curse true that what the Bible say I'm I'm talking about the Covenant this is in the contract so in my contract if I any any TI PS in here hallelujah nobody Hallelujah that was no trick question H you have to prove it to me amen I just want to witness hallelujah hallelujah JD the Bible says you pay it you pass Hallelujah no matter what your bills look like no matter what's behind Hallelujah I don't know about you guys but right now I'm looking for that window that's supposed to be open yeah things behind but God in my my contract I got a warranty there's a warranty that says if I do it I'm blessed hallu where did that come from it came from the original contract he gave with Abraham the Bible said Hallelujah he gave ties to Levi Levi was even born yet imagine that stepping into something that hadn't even materialized yet that's the sister did oh my but look you got everybody all right you got these two people trying to negotiate and then they say okay let's let's let's let's say they they reject that $100 and say hey don't don't don't don't play me like I don't know the value of what I got and brother Jason sometimes I think us as Christians we don't realize the value of what it means to be a Christian Hallelujah the value of what it means Hallelujah to have a Healer a savior Hallelujah a peacegiver a mind regulator Hallelujah there are certain things that are in the warranty of my house Hallelujah certain things that just automatically Hallelujah I got to write to Tony the Bible says hallu these signs shall follow them that believe I don't have to do nothing special it's a part of my Covenant it's a part of my contract healing is behind find me oh my time is not on the outside I got to wind it down but church I ain't got no come on and preach hallelujah oh my but look Church you take those two that are under the Covenant Hallelujah that going speed it up they come to an agreement h now the buyer agrees to seller the seller agrees the seller it for this much the agent comes and meet and he says okay this is what the seller is asking for they say okay well I can do that then the agents go back and meet they have an agreement Hall on both sides what happens now it has to the agreement has to become ratified Hallelujah it has to be set in stone like we say what does ratified mean Hallelujah ratify if you ratify something it says to confirm Hallelujah by expressing consent approval or formal sanction Hallelujah church we got a contract that's been ratified it's been proven over and over and over again hallelujah it's ratified it's confirmed hallelujah what does confirm mean confirm means to establish the truth hallelujah we got a ratified contract with God praise God we got a r we under a ratified Covenant with God but what are you saying you have something that holds God to his word that's what a contract does H cuz you know when you buy in the house you get ready to get to the closing and they say well we don't feel like this we don't feel like this all you do is Flip Flip in that contract say oh I got your signature you said you was going to do this this this this and this and they're a person of Integrity they're going to honor their word natural things types our spiritual church we have God under a ratified contract Hallelujah when you read this word and you can find promises and Promises of Truth God is obligated ain't nobody streaming about that one God is obligated to fulfill everything Hallelujah that's in the Covenant everything that's in the contract is ratified Hallelujah and when something is ratified you can go back to that person and say I don't feel like doing it you can go back to that person and say isn't this your signature you signed off on the church and God signed off on it when he went to Cal his cross and died he signed off in blood we have his hands tied all you need to do is pull up what God say you're born into this Hallelujah you don't have to prove anything all you got to do is bring back to him what he said and you know what when it comes to that part I don't need the agent anymore I don't have to go fast and pray and find a quarter brother brandom no I got it right here and I can take it right back to the original one who said it and say God you said you said Hall I'll be the head and not the tail H now what I challenge you to do before I close oh my let me let me read let me finish reading real quick Hallelujah listen he says God some you were Sinners you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then when I was in the world there was something already in [Applause] me that my sins couldn't stop from coming alive and I'm going give I'm going to give you a little a little anchor Hallelujah it was my sins that brought me to that place it was my raggedy tired life that brought me to a place where I would scream out for more brought me to a place where I was sick of who I was what was it it was the real life coming out of me dis you know why we here as Christians because we were dissatisfied with the world so it was who you were in the world that made you reach out for something greater you know what Rachel it wasn't even us reaching out it was Christ in you saying okay now it's time for me to come alive in you Hallelujah cuz he said no one seeks after God God seeks after you so Church think about this church God is so rich in mercy God brings the contract to you and say hey remember what I said God brings the contract to you and say hey turn to Genesis Hallelujah turn to Genesis 126 Hallelujah this is who you are God brings the contract to you flips the pages and begin to show you all of your Authority I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me it's a part of the contract but what I love about it some of you may be thinking well you say my case is special yeah it's special it's special but thisen what I challenge you to do the prophet says he says the way God if he ever move one way he has to continue to do it you know what that mean that mean he can't white something out you know we make a mistake we go get to White out like it was never D we write something else over it God can't do that once he said it he's obligated to it I give you a prime example God took a a lady who call herself the shite gave her a child a child she wasn't even crying out for but she did something special for a prophet and then God God gave her her desire without her even asking for it Hallelujah that's who he is hallelujah God will bless you with things Hallelujah he know that you desire for Hallelujah before you can even ask for it because he knew that he knows that will encourage you Hallelujah and that was something he did Hallelujah he gave this woman a child in her old age or whatever the case may be Hallelujah when she was Barren and somebody else picked up I got the same Covenant Hallelujah time does not expire this contract time has nothing there's no expiration date hallelujah hallelujah the warranty is an eternal warranty Hallelujah now this this this this woman God blessed with child Hallelujah she was baring and so forth another sister she picked it up Hallelujah her child had got a social disease W Hallelujah not in Jerusalem not in Egypt but in Memphis Tennessee Hallelujah there are no countries that can have barriers to stop the Covenant from going into action Hallelujah now you know Hallelujah South Carolina we got laws where we can walk around tote guns and all these stuff you can't do that in New York you go to jail they different laws there different covenants there're different agreements hallah but you can walk around here all free you walk right here like you John Wayne going on your side I got a license I can do this you know I'm approved you go to New York with that foolishness if you want to you'll be in jail cuz there different restrictions at different places Hallelujah the same God in Africa is the same God in bu Hallelujah the same God who did all the Miracles in Jeffersonville is the same God in bu the same God that showed the prophet his profile on Sunset mountain is the same God right here tonight the same God that split the Red Sea is the same God tonight the same God hallelujah Church what in the Covenant the same God that gave Peter the right to walk on water he's telling some everybody tonight it's time for you to walk on water stop being so afraid let's believe what God has given us I just give you a personal testimony you don't hear me I always fight y'all heard me say this fight me through finances and all this stuff and get tough and tough and tougher you know at the beginning of the year I said you know what I'm sick of you Satan you know how we do we always try on our own self ways of survival so I'mma start a business I'm going do this I'm going do this I'm going do whatever I need to overcome and that may be all right but is it the will of God hallelujah cuz there's some things that you may do and all they do is produce stress Solomon say all is Vanity and vexation of spirit so what I did every little thing that I was trying to do to get ahead I said you know what I ain't doing nothing no more if I got to suffer I'll suffer beli in God hallelujah and it looked like the boat was sinking I mean sink it it would go I I was I wasn't even Treading Water no more I was going under like this and coming up say go back down and you know when you really drowning you you lose all your Technique you supposed to be struggling out like this slap in the water I supposed to be strug out maybe God allow us to get there sometimes just to show that he's with you don't be afraid of those moments where you don't know what's next just remember you have a ratified contract and this woman saw her son down she said Lord I can't let my son die like this some of y'all see your children they going to well the world it's time for you to say eyes can't let my child go this way I can't let my child be having by

brought it down some of y'all need to bring your situation down right to your bosom right to your house right to your bedroom right to your living room that's a part of your Covenant stop letting the devil tell you it's not in a warranty yes it is hallelujah and there is no expiration date if it work for the first child it'll work for the middle child the third child the fourth child amen God just want us to believe I got to quit but we're under a ratified contract we're under a ratified Covenant it's written in stone it's written on the blood that can't be changed Church how many of us Believers filled with the Holy Ghost so I want to demonstrate and show you something we Believers F the Holy Ghost we're born into a covenant with God so when it comes to the word of God and you come to God say Lord this is your promise this is what you said you know what it does to God In Handcuffs he can't get out of it he can't wiggle out of it he can't work his way out of it church and the more God try to squeeze the tighter it get Hallelujah see Jacob realized that he was under a covenant and Jacob said you know what I'm I'm not going to leave until you bless me where did that come from how you go through a trial looking for blessings out of a fight some of y'all don't want to fight you got to fight Hallelujah let me finish reading this and I'mma quit by the grace of God he said and when after a while you heard the gospel somebody say Amen maybe you went to church amen you picked out this and that and went to denomination to denomination but one day you being a part of God you me us one day being a part of God we had to connect with something real Hallelujah see but one day you being a to be a part of the word because you were a part of a certain contract you had to connect with what was in the contract and the contract from God is perfection so you had to connect with a word that could bring you back to Perfection that's why we're not followers of Billy Graham that's why we're not followers of or Roberts or anybody else or goo genius or TD Jak or whoever else you want to name out Hallelujah we are under a contract Hallelujah that's yearning for perfection amen amen amen hallelujah and when you heard the word hallelujah you knew where you come from I don't think anybody here is old enough I know your folks were your folks was in the meetings right were you ever on baby brother Jason was there Hallelujah think about it Hallelujah most of us never was in a service so God spoke a word in our life that we wasn't even able to believe until a certain time he told Abraham he said hey you're going to have a child knowing Abraham didn't even believe it yet Sarah didn't believe it Abraham didn't believe it but that didn't stop the Covenant that didn't stop the promise God made God has spoken into our lives and we will come unto Rapture status we will fulfill thus say the Lord why because that is who we are Hallelujah we are a part of a word for our day he said when you heard the word you knew where you come from you know what was truth hallelujah that's why we're not arguing with who a prophet is and he made mistakes and all these things Hallelujah why because you heard truth truth is not meant to be proven truth is meant to [Applause] believed Hallelujah he said you know what was truth you were always deceived was in you and this is the part I like H you know when you reading the contract there has to be something in you that agrees he says he says the word seen the word that was in you so when you read the message Hallelujah you're reading the word hallelujah and you're seeing what's in you I'm going to say that again when you read the message of the hour which is the reveal word cuz remember the prophet of God said this message made my Bible a new book Hallelujah so when you read the message hallu and the Bible which I won Hallelujah that's why we don't use them as two entities it's one Hallelujah cuz the prophet got his inspiration where from the [Applause] Bible Hallelujah he says hallelujah it was the word seeing the word amen hallelujah that's why we read the message Hallelujah and we see serpent SE what is the church we're seeing the revealing of who we are when we see the Mighty God unveiled we see the revealing of who we are when we heard the Thunders and the seals open what was it we were hearing the revealing of who we are that's why there's a people on the Earth Hallelujah that can testify and they know under the contract that the seven seal is open Hallelujah you say well he didn't give an explanation this ain't about explanations it's about a revealing hallelujah it's about a covenant of warranty that God has given you and like I love to say it's so simple hallelujah it's so simple amen well we don't know what it is I beg your part church I'm not looking to qu squirrels I don't believe that's a part of my journey I'm not a hunter I eat your squirrels but I'm not one to pull out the gun let's say let's go bang bang let's go hunting so I don't think I'll ever have a need for squirrels but I may have a need of another kind of creation H but that ability and power is already in my Covenant as I need hallelujah it's the word seeing the word hallelujah listen Church Hallelujah he says the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it hallelujah hallelujah why are we still here because we came to what we are and we believe Christ is the word what do we come to we came to Christ come musicians I'm closing Hallelujah church we were born into this nobody can take it away from you H remember Nicodemus say he say he say should I go back into the womb for a second time he said no I ain't talking about that I'm not talking about a physical birth talking about something spiritual HJ now you ask yourself where are you spiritually H where are you with all the things that God has revealed in a contract Hallelujah you say well the seals have come Thunders have shouting where am I is there a Revival you should be in Revival Hallelujah let's think why you should be in Revival well let me say why I'm in Revival let's just take the seals to open up the seals for a second and I'm going get out the way the first four horse riders what's the identity of those horse riders it's dealing with the Antichrist amen I'm not in there we're not in there we're not following the Antichrist amen we're not under his doctrin we're not there well let's keep moving to fifth seal this with the souls under the altar Hallelujah I'm not in there I believe the the the message of Christ Hallelujah I believe who he was I'm not a soul under the altar Hallelujah okay well let's keep going the six seal deals with the Jews Hallelujah I'm not there I'm not a Jew Hallelujah so where am I where are you we must be in the revealing of the seven seal Hallelujah has it been revealed he said the seventh seal deals with the coming of Christ his relationship with the bride and the opening of the word now you ask yourself is Christ coming amen that means that part is open to you Hallelujah are you the bride do you have a relationship with God that part is open to you hallelujah amen has the word been open can you see it that part has been open to you so you must be in that seven cell it's a part of the Covenant I'm going to say this and be getting out of the way I just feel like even tonight when I was coming if I could say it like this there are too many people this is just an expression there too many people in church who's gotten caught up in their own Funk want to feel sorry for themselves things ain't going right in my life and my relationship my my husband my wife my children I ain't got the right job and I just don't feel I don't feel

world has kept me all these years it it's already seen me on the other side Hallelujah I want you to know I'm a believer of that Covenant it's already ratified amen it's irrevocable it's immutable and uh I I love I love the the word that Jefferson used when he wrote the Declaration of Independence one word out of that whole declaration this lights my world and he called your rights inalienable now we've kind of he actually said unali it's a little archaic we turn it to inable in the more modern day it means the same thing you know what unable right means it means you don't need nobody's permission it is your birth birth right it is your god-given unalienable in other words it can't be made alien from you it's part of you Hallelujah why do I believe this word cuz I'm a part of this word therefore it is my unable right I can't be separated from it and I don't need the devil's permission to believe it I have rights in the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord we're going to take up

Sharon let me find the microphone for you get that over there to her is it good there you go so a couple of weeks ago I put in a prayer request for my trip to Alabama because I'm already a nervous flyer and for some reason like I don't normally feel the need to put in prayer requests for flights and stuff but I kept feeling like I should for that flight and I was like really nervous about it so I was like all right I'm going to go ahead and put in a prayer request and I'm glad I did because what ended up happening is my first flight landed half was supposed to land a half hour before my next flight took off and the Atlant airport is huge and that time window is small yeah and I was scared I wasn't going to make it well my first flight ended up getting delayed by an hour so I completely missed my second flight and the next flight was going to be 8 a.m. the next day oh wow so like I'm in the Atlanta airport by myself kind of freaked out like what am I going to do you know I needed another flight and I was debating like do I have Jeremiah come get me from the Atlanta airport do I just wait it out so me and another girl who also got left were trying to figure out if we can get on another flight but they had standbys for all of them besides two there was one at 11: and there was one at 7 p.m. she got on the 7 p.m. one but because he was ahead of me in line I got put on the 11 p.m. so that's a 5 hour layover I'm already really disappointed apped cuz I took off work to come to this trip so I was just walked around the airport and I was praying about it I decided to go get some food and I had a feeling that told me pull out your phone and check and I checked and there was a spot open on the 700 p.m. flight so I clicked it and I got on the flight and I got there the same day praise the Lord the microphone came my way I guess I'll give this little testimony um I had shared a little bit at the men's prayer meeting just brother Diggs mentioned you know you get in the funk and you know the wowy wowy woo and sometimes it's for no apparent reason I just um was that way for a little bit of time and and uh you know then just had an epiphany that you know the devil puts this upon you just to rob you of the greatest weapon you have at your disposal to make you feel blue and low MH and so you won't pray and I took that and I knew there were people that were out on the battlefields that need a prayer and I went into fervent prayer my wife and I for those needs and the wowy wowy woo left me Hallelujah so Saints there's there's power in intercessory prayer one for another so please take up that that sword take up that greatest weapon you have and use it yes Hallelujah Mr [Applause] Melissa a couple of weeks ago I put a prayer request in for the baby of um B baby brother of my um one of my students and he came home and all his well so I just want to thank God for [Applause] that I um asked for prayer for Susie for the your sister so she got a clean bill of health praise the Lord sister Phillips hallelujah amen anybody else amen anybody else over here to I was just gonna say go ahead s that it seemed like somebody was listening to our conversation last night and by the service the Holy Spirit was all the way to Rachel all the way over yeah all the way to Rachel man yeah I've been actually meaning to give this testimony for a while but I was sick and couldn't do it so um several well about two months ago Zoe's cat figuro went missing she's had that CAT since she was very little and she was brokenhearted over it he's always come back he kind of does his own thing but he always comes back at night and eats and he just disappeared we couldn't find him and probably three weeks went by we contacted the animal shelter uh sent pictures they hadn't hadn't had them turned in we put signs all over the neighborhood three or four weeks went by and absolutely nothing and she was just so upset about it and it meant a lot to her so it was really Weighing on me and I just kept praying and I was in my kitchen one night and I was listening to brother brandom I don't even remember what I was listening to but he was talking about how people will come to the prayer line and pray for something because they go home and they get worse they give up and they lose their healing and if they would have only stuck with it a little bit longer it was almost there and so I said okay Lord I'm going to keep praying and I don't care if I have to pray for 10 years I'm going to pray all the time that you give him back I know that you will I'm just going to keep on doing it so the next morning I woke up and I was sitting in my chair reading a devotional and it said the same thing that the hardest part people lose what they're praying for so many times because they don't hold on for that last 30 minutes and so I said okay Lord I'm going to be like that woman in the Bible with the unjust judge I'm just going to keep asking you and so I prayed again and I thought I'm just going to open Facebook and see if maybe animal shelters posted something so I open it and the first picture is a picture of figuro and took my my breath away I was like oh my goodness this is him I know it's him he's very distinct so I went and I woke up mad and I was like I think this is figuro he said that's absolutely figuro so we kept trying to call the animal shelter they weren't open yet and finally we got through to somebody and they had found somebody had found him all the way over by the Food Lion by Outback goodness way far away like I I can't imagine how he got there but the people loved him wanted to keep him but took him to the animal shelter to make sure he was caught up on his shots and he was healthy and they recognized him from one of the pictures and the people kept him for us and we went and got him and he's still here so it was a long time I don't know how he got there but we wanted to give God the glory for that [Applause] amen praise the Lord God still Moves In Those ways you want it sister maredith we give you the last word so this is a financial testimony back in January I had to have a test done and you know being in healthcare I knew that it wasn't cheap but I didn't know exactly how expensive it was and um the lady sent off one test that saw me and um I got the bill a little later it's about $300 for this one test and I was like it was right after Christmas I was like we don't I I we didn't have the money to pay for it at the time and so I very politely sent the lady that did it um because she didn't know how much it cost either and I sent her a message and I said um I just want to make you aware Just for future reference that this is how much such and such such cost so you can know for your self-pay patience and she's like her ma got back with me and she said Miss Miss L we're going to look into it for you and see if we can get it taken care of so I got another phone call from her later and she said we're still looking into it we'll get back with you well the last phone call I got from her she said they took care of it so don't worry about it I was like oh well this never happens but I'm really thankful it did so um just thankful for the little things amen praise the Lord praise the lord it's been wonderful to be in the house of God tonight turn around and shake hands with somebody
