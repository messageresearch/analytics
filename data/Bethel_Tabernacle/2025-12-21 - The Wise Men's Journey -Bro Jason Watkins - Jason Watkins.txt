[applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There's a swing [singing] on the back porch [music] where I sit [singing] in the morning when the sun [music] is slowly rising with a Bible [singing] on my [music] knees. And at the last swallow of coffee, [music and singing] I'll just sit there in your presence for [music] a while and let your spirit come and [music] move all over me. Thank you, [singing] Lord, for everything [music] you've given [singing] me. You [music] provideed every need. big and [singing] small. More than all of [singing] the blessings that [music] you pour out every day, your [singing] presence is my favorite gift of [music] all. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes [singing] late at night when the kids are asleep, I'll go out into [music and singing] the yard and just listen to the night. And [music and singing] I can feel your holy spirit as the whipper will [singing] nature in a praise [music] song in every critter in the forest seems to [music and singing] cry out. Thank you Lord for everything you've given [music and singing] me. You provided every [music] need, both big and small. [singing] More than all of the blessings [singing] that you pour out every day. Your [music and singing] presence is my favorite gift of all. [music] for that all of the blessings that you pour out every [music and singing] day. Your presence is my favorite gift [music] of all. [singing] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Solomon [music and singing] concluded all is vanity. [music] Now my [singing] heart believes that it is true. It took me all [singing] this time [music] to find reality. All I ever really [singing] needed [music] was you. All [music and singing] that really counts, all that [music] really true. [singing] All that really matters, Lord, is you. Everything to gain, [singing] nothing to lose. [music] All [singing] I'll ever really need [music] is you. So take the [singing] grandest thing you know life can give [music] and weigh it with eternity's bright [singing] side. [music] One [singing] thing I have learned in this life I've lived. There is truly [singing] nothing [music] good but God. All that really counts, [singing] all [music] that's really true, all that [singing] really matters, Lord, is you. [music and singing] Everything to gain, nothing to lose. All I [music] ever [singing] really want is you. All that really counts, [singing] [music] all that's really true, all that [singing] really matters, Lord, is [music] you. Everything [music and singing] to gain, nothing to lose. All I'll ever [music] really need is you. [music] [applause] Brother John. So this morning [clears throat] as brother Jason comes out, we're going to have brother John. Let's give him a hand. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Well, the maker of heaven came down [music] from above. It was all about love and [music] he was the rose between heaven and earth. It [singing] was all about love. Now I'm part of his plan. [music] And I know who I am because I am a prisoner of love. I've been caught in the kiss [music and singing] between heaven and earth. And now I'm a prisoner [music] of love. Oh, I was in him when [music] the lamb met the dove. Now I prisoner of love. [music] Oh, now I'm a prisoner of love. &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] [music] [bell] [music] &gt;&gt; Well, he suffered for me in the garden that day. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It was all about love. And he bore all my sins to [music] that cruel Calvary. It [singing] was all about love. Now I'm not of his plan. And [music] I know who I am because I am a prisoner of love. Oh, I've been caught in the kiss [music] between heaven and earth. And now I'm a prisoner of love. [music] [singing] Oh, I was in him when the lamb met the dove. And now I'm a prisoner of love. [singing] Oh, now I [music] a prisoner of love. Oh, well, he died there [music] for me between heaven [singing] and earth. Now I'm a prisoner of love, [music] nailing my sins to that old rugged cross. And now [music] I'm a prisoner of love. Oh, now I'm [music] a prisoner of love. &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Quite a scene. Got my camp pull pit. Amen. Praise the Lord. You You love the Lord today. God bless you. We're um we're going to invite you right to Matthew's Gospel this morning. Greet you in the name of the Lord. And we're very happy to have you here in the house of God with us. Amen. Amen. We're going to get um brother Matthew up here in just a little bit. He'll come up and sing some songs between the intermission and um Amen. get a get a few more Christmas themed songs. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I noticed today there wasn't a ton of them, but I appreciated the ones that we had, but of course, I loved all the singing quite naturally. Amen. Praise God. Whoops, wrong thing. Amen. Going to invite you to Matthew chapter 2 and we're going to look at those first 12 verses. Amen. I saw brother Tony make you turn around and shake hands so I won't do it again. But [laughter] Amen. While you're finding your place in Matthew chapter 2, I might just make a few quick announcements. Um just one quick announcement. There will be no midweek service &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; uh this week with the holidays upon us. And um I'd like to say today that I've been looking forward to seeing the children's Sunday school class give us our annual Christmas play ever since Joy sent me the script. Amen. For my approval and um that's been underway. And so much thanks go to Sister Joy and to all the other sisters. I know there was a whole team of them uh helping um be or at least involved in all of that. Amen. From the very start. I love little children. I'm just crazy about them. And um it's Sundays and Wednesdays to see their little smiling faces. My goodness. It's a it's a highlight of my life. Sister Debbie, same way. Some of them stare at me to distraction. [laughter] Amen. Make it difficult for me to keep my concentration. But um and then and then others of them uh help me preach loud [laughter] and uh I'm constantly finding that sometimes I have to try to outshout them. [laughter] Amen. Um want to say that the fellowship hall is reopened for the present at least until uh renovation picks back up which is um which I do plan to turn my full attention um to it back to it in the coming new year. [sighs] Wow. My sudden, our sudden, Sister Debbie and I are sudden and u rather arduous move is just about wrapped up [clears throat] with mostly just some things to do on the outside. And uh Sister Debbie is still alive. &gt;&gt; I haven't set her to the curb. [laughter] Amen. But like the Apostle Paul, there were a few times I despared of life. [laughter] But we made it. [laughter] Hallelujah. It's been a lot and I'm very grateful to uh to all who have helped Sister Debbie and I make that transition. We had far more help than we could take advantage of, help offered to us than we could take advantage of, but it certainly warms our heart for all of the offers of help that came in. Amen. I just have a little bit of u stuff on the front porch and u some extra landscaping and Sister Debbie's never ending list. Amen. And it's the call it the everlasting list. It's been going for 43 years. Man, it didn't start on this house. Amen. Every husband should say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every woman should say, "Don't forget it." [laughter] Amen. But once I have um those few outside items, the brothers and I will move our focus uh very quickly back to the fellowship hall. actually never left our discussions and we're continuing to set things in motion today. Um, with the fellow having said the fellowship hall is open, sister Debbie and I will be having some time with our family over here uh in our new home. So, we actually won't be in the fellowship hall today, but it is open for use and we [clears throat] do plan to pick right back up where we left off with Sunday afternoon fellowship. That's been a hallmark for this church for 30 plus years. And it keeps us close to one another. And I love it. And it's remarkable. We get the most remarks out of that. I get more remarks out of people visiting and seeing the spirit you have in the fellowship hall more than they say about my sermon. And I'm okay with that because I realize that's a product of the preaching. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. All hearts clear. Let's look at our at our scripture this morning. Matthew chapter 2. And I want to uh speak to you this morning taking a title, [clears throat] The Wise Men's Journey, Chapter 2. We'll catch these first 12 verses and let you be seated. Once I'm done, Brother Matt will come up for a little intermission of singing while Sister Joy and and other sisters get them into their costumes and then it's Amen. So, I'm looking forward to that. Uh chapter 2, verse one. [clears throat] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him." When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him." That's a pretty shocking statement. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, and thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, art not the least among the princes of Judah. For out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. And when you have found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also." When they had heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother. You remember this wasn't the manger scene. This is after Jesus has been evacuated to Egypt and back and he's about two years old. So they were coming to the house. They saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gold and frankincense and myrr. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. [clears throat] Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word today. These are this is a story that we've read, Lord, everyone in here, Lord, since the days when we were children in Sunday school and at home. And master, we're looking today for fresh insight to this story, this journey of the wise men. Lord, may we find the applications to our life. For every word of God is given for instruction. every word, all the stories, all the allegorories, everything is given for our instructions. It's profitable, Lord, for doctrine and teaching. And so we pray today that you will help us now to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends. You can be seated. I have a a small um I guess you'd call it like a news feed that I subscribe to and it saves me in the morning sometimes if I want to just make sure the world isn't ending and I check the quick headlines. It gives me just a quick rundown of the of the important stuff. Saves me chasing all over the internet, which I don't want to be doing in the morning uh when that's my time for my devotional. So, uh they had an interesting letter today published I thought was interesting and it said the meaning of Christmas and it says this. Christmas is a Christian holiday celebrating the belief in God's birth as a first century Judean man, Jesus Christ, celebrated each year on December 25. Faithful observers believe the all powerful uncreated God became incarnate to redeem humanity from a fallen state by dying and rising again at Easter. I'd say amen to that. In recent centuries, the religious feast expanded into a major holiday season of giftgiving celebrated by an estimated 2.6 billion people worldwide. Its timing and many of its customs trace back to an ancient seasonal festival such as uh Satnelia and Ule. You'll hear Ule tide. That's where that comes from. When communities in Europe celebrated the winter solstice, as Christianity spread through the continent in the 4th century, church leaders placed Christmas on December 25 and adopted some of these longstanding traditions. Amid the holidays gradual secularization, the legend of St. Nicholas's giftgiving and the Dutch tradition of Santa Claus helped shape the modern con conception of Santa Claus. what we've uh customs, it goes on, customs solidified in Victorian England, transformed Christmas into the family centered celebration recognized today, popularizing Christmas trees, cards, and carols. The holiday season brings in, you ready for this? Nearly $1 trillion in revenue for US retailers alone. US retailers alone. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; you know, when we when we look at this subject, uh, I I I I did a little bit of a deep dive on the position of the messengers and how they spoke to these things. And you can see why Brother Brandham was so against the commercialization of Christmas and that stuck in his crawl his entire ministry and he never relinquished that. uh he he talks about you know taking away the sacredness of it and he was perfectly aware. I just think it's interesting in 2025 they print an article that is exactly what a prophet was trying to tell the Christian world 40 50 years ago that it's not in no way the birth of Christ. It was it was festivals and feast days and and seasons and winter solstice and they adopted that into the Christian and then they hit the whole Chris Kringle Santa Claus thing. And he says, "Don't tell your children that there's a Santa Claus because someday you'll have to tell them there's not or they'll find out there's not." And then their next question will naturally be and you won't be able to fault them for it. Well, what about this Jesus you tell me about? Maybe he's not real uh either. Can I get some water, Brother Tony? Thank you. Amen. So, so looking back, uh you know, you don't you don't have the Apostle Paul um speaking a whole lot uh about a Christmas holiday as you as you would well imagine because it wasn't really adopted into the Christian church until around the 4th century. But Paul did have some things to say about it or about it in general. In Colossians 2:es 13-17, Paul says, "And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having [clears throat] forgiven you all trespasses." Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he spoiled the devil's plans for you. &gt;&gt; I think that's a good thing as a Christmas present. He spoiled the devil's plans for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Let no man, Paul says, therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or of a new moon or of the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ. So Paul is speaking about the liberty that we have as mature Christians that we live in the world. We're not of the world, but we do live here. And we are supposed to conduct our lives as though not like we live off the world or in a commune. Uh when Paul writes to one of the churches, I believe in the Galatian church, if I'm not mistaken, that might stand correction about, you know, having nothing to do with the world. And they write back to him, which was the which was the foundation of his second letter. And their their question, one of their questions was, "You said we should have nothing to do with the world, but how do we pull this off? We have jobs, we have careers, our kids are in school, we work in the markets." And Paul writes back to clarify saying that, you know, when I said to you before that you should, you know, have nothing to do with the world, you know, it's it's evident that to have absolutely nothing to do with the world, you would have to go out of the world. And many have done that. They've went into communes. But that's not what the gospel came to do. The gospel came to for to send you out as sheep among wolves with the Holy Ghost as your guide. And that's how the world um because it's not shepherds that bring forth sheep. Sheep bring forth sheep. And so I I stand up here and preach to you and dress you in the garments of the word, but it is your job along with me to be out there preaching the gospel in your lived lives. &gt;&gt; SO PAUL IS SIMPLY saying we're free from these things. Uh we're we're not going to allow people to judge us because we didn't go live in a commune and and we we have to have jobs and careers and things like that and we have to know people and associate with the works of darkness. sometimes it can't be avoided. Uh you're going to be sometimes our law enforcement brothers, I've had it even even in law enforcement as chaplain where you sometimes you're you're literally hands-on with people and you can't avoid it. And so you know the these are the things that we live by. PAUL COMES BACK TO Galatians in in chapter 4:es 9 to1 11 and you say, "Brother Jason, what does all this have to do with the season we're in?" You'll just hang on. So Galatians 4 9-11. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, where to you desire again to be in bondage. You got out of the world. Why you trying to get back in it? &gt;&gt; You know, God, one of the problems with that, God took exception to Hezekiah. King Hezekiah got him in a lot of trouble. God asked him a question. Why is it that you're always making my enemies your friends? So God watches that sea and we we're in the world but we're not of the world. We're supposed to be different from the world. IF YOU'RE NOT, THEN HOW ARE YOU A LIGHTHOUSE TO OFFER THEM ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SEE? &gt;&gt; SO SO PAUL GOES ON. HE SAYS, "How how do you turn again the weak and beggarly elements where you desire again to be in bondage?" Verse 10, you observe days and months and times and years, AND I'M AFRAID OF YOU, LEST I HAVE BESTOWED UPON YOU labor in vain. Now, I'm enough of a Bible student to realize those two texts don't don't um perfectly compare, but but really, THAT'S NOT MY POINT. UM I'M NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE A POINT TO COMPARE THEM SO MUCH is is that my point is is that when I read Paul, I read a constant emphasis on balance. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I WANT TO SAY THAT ONE DITCH IS JUST AS BAD AS THE OTHER DITCH. &gt;&gt; And we have too much of that going on. AND COULD I ADVOCATE for brother Paul today uh by saying THAT YOU KNOW BY SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T LIVE IN ANY DITCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, balance in the word of God is where you will be most effective in witnessing to your loved ones, to your neighbors, to people on the job who you work with. BALANCE IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND peace that passes understanding. Balance is where you will achieve the fullness of joy that your joy may be full. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says in Galatians 3:2, "This only what I learn of you." SO, YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO SAY, you know, YOU GOT THIS GROUP JUDGING THIS GROUP AND THIS GROUP CONDESCENDING TO THIS GROUP, AND PAUL IS SO AGAINST THAT, and and we're FREE FROM THE WORLD. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE ATTACHED BACK TO THE WORLD, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M FREE, AND I I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNE OR FOLLOW UH UH YOUR LIST OF RULES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PAUL SAYS, "THIS ONLY WOULD I LEARN OF YOU." COULD I SAY TODAY, "THIS ONLY IN WHATEVER OPINION that you HAVE ABOUT THIS HOLIDAY SEASON OR ANY HOLIDAY SEASON OR LIFE TOMORROW OR LIFE NEXT NEXT YEAR, THIS ONLY WHAT I LEARN OF YOU. RECEIVED ye the spirit by the works OF THE LAW OR BY HEARING OF FAITH." &gt;&gt; SEE, you've entrusted this ministry and this ministry team for many years with the souls of your family. And so if this ministry, you know, team, uh, this Bethl ministry team, I think if we're known for anything at all, uh, we're known for A AN ESTABLISHMENT AND A balance in God's word. And I I TAKE A LOT of a lot of joy in that that I've that NOT ONLY IS IT MY VISION, BUT IT'S THE VISION OF MY MINISTRY TEAM WHO HAVE ADOPTED THAT BALANCE IN THE WORD OF GOD. SEE, mentions or references to church history today will be very brief because I'm actually not preaching this morning on the celebration of church holidays such as Christmas or Easter or even the Sabbath, which are subjects in and of themselves. Uh I'm actually preparing a a rather deep dive essay on those elements in church history from the earliest times, tracking it to the present day day. But for today, I have a different burden on my heart for a Christmas message this year. Um, you know, just to speak briefly of the history and it was very enlightening. uh as I BEGIN TO DIVE DEEP ON IT, you you almost have to jump forward beyond Ireanius uh all the way to Martin and and heading into Columbus because it wasn't until the 4th century that these kinds of holidays. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY WEREN'T, YOU KNOW, ALL KINDS OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS going on there. THAT'S THAT WAS ROME &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. And so, THE CHURCH ALREADY HAD THE SPIRIT OF ANTICHRIST WORKING IN IT. SO, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN it's not an end time WHERE THE IT'S NOT JUST THE LAST AGE FACES THE ANTICHRIST. Every age has faced it. See? AND SO, THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD TO NAVIGATE WHERE THEY COME DOWN ON HOW DO WE CONDUCT OURSELVES TO LIVE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT BE OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; It's always BEEN A CHALLENGE AND IT'S A IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A MOVING TARGET. NOT BECAUSE THE WORD MOVES, BUT BECAUSE THE AGE MOVES AND NEW things appear. AND AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET HELP FROM FROM FROM YESTER YEAR. THEN SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A RIGHT NOW WORD. SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A THUS SAYETH THE LORD TO MOVE ASIDE ALL THE MAN-MADE DEBRIS. AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs] &gt;&gt; There's no record where Irenius explicitly opposed the CELEBRATION OF ANY KIND OF A CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY. um rather the absence of his commentary would suggest THAT IT WAS SIMPLY NOT A CONCERN because it wasn't a practice at that time. If you go ON PAST COLUMBBO, YOU FIND THE SAME THING even when you come to Martin Luther. NOW, BY THE TIME YOU GET TO LUTHER, IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED in the Christian church. And actually, Luther publicly supported it to a large degree uh not only Christmas but Easter uh during the early years of his reformation. In fact, he actually enriched uh uh he actually enriched Christmas traditions and even wrote carols. SEE OUR CHURCH AGE messenger and and and HE BUT BUT BUT ALWAYS ONE THEME HERE'S ONE THEME THAT I FOUND ACROSS ALL OF THEM AND I'M NOT GETTING INTO the trenches of it today. They all none OF THEM NONE OF OUR MESSENGERS FROM PAUL TO BROTHER BRANDHAM UM PREACHED A PROHIBITION AGAINST CERTAIN ARTICLES OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY. BUT WHAT THEY ALL HAD IN COMMON WAS THAT IT THAT THAT'S JUST A A SIDE THING. WHAT YOU REALLY OUGHT TO DO IS LOOK AT IT AS A SPIRITUAL TIME TO GROW CLOSE TO GOD AND USE THAT TIME WISELY TO WITNESS TO PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE OPEN TO IT. &gt;&gt; SEE, JUST LIKE JUST LIKE I IT WOULD BE I WOULD NEVER I WOULD never with the spirit of Christ say to uh a mother or a father, YOU BETTER SERVE THE LORD OR THE LORD MIGHT TAKE YOUR CHILD. HOW CRUEL WOULD THAT BE? ESPECIALLY IF IT CAME TO PASS. SEE, AND AND THERE have been men who sadly have used fear tactics LIKE THAT. BUT I ALSO WOULDN'T MISS AN OPPORTUNITY IF THE LORD SAW FIT TO TAKE A CHILD AND THAT PARENT'S HEART WAS TENDER AND BROKEN AT THAT MOMENT, I'D MOVE IN WITH THE GOSPEL. THAT'S WHY SISTER GINA IS SITTING HERE TODAY. THE LORD BROKE HER HEART AND AND AND SHE LOST A BABY. AND WHILE HER HEART WAS TENDER AND BROKEN LIKE THAT, THE HOLY SPIRIT GOT A HOLD OF HER AND MY DAD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THIS THIS WAS Luther's uh thinking. The Wesley carried ON WITH THE EXACT SAME THING. HE DIDN'T OPPOSE IT AT ALL. IN FACT, IS HIS BROTHER uh Charles uh Wesley also wrote Christmas carols. Uh they WERE ALL IT WASN'T, YOU KNOW, jingle bells and all that kind of nonsense of the world, but the sacred uh the sacred hymns. AND SO YOU YOU HAD A LOT OF UH MEN BACK IN THAT day uh writing tremendous music that almost takes your breath away. Handles Messiah's a beautiful piece of music and and THAT WAS HIS THAT WAS HIS WORSHIP to God as best he understood the Isuza revival fathers. Neither did they. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, HOW DID IT GET IN INTO INTO some elements of America where there IS SUCH AN OPPOSITION THAT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ANATHEMA AND BECAUSE BECAUSE NONE OF THE MESSENGERS PRIOR TO LUTHER TALKED ABOUT IT DEROG IN A DEROGATORY WAY EVEN THE FESTIVALS THEY DID have and YOU KNOW JUST TO JUST TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE THAT WAS THEIR CONSTANT MESSAGE AND THEN WHEN YOU COME TO LUTHER AND YOU SAY WELL I BUT LUTHER ALSO DRANK BEER AND SMOKED THE PIPE BUT WESLEY DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; WESLEY WAS ARMENIAN AND VERY STRICT UH SANCTIFI SANCTIFIED LIVES AND HE DIDN'T PREACH AGAINST IT AT ALL. WESLEY ALSO HAD THE SAME THINKING. USE IT AS A TIME FOR SPIRITUAL RENEWAL. USE IT AS A TIME TO TO TO SHOW THE HUMILITY OF CHRIST AND THE LOVE OF GOD TO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; The Isuz I thought, well, MAYBE THE THE EARLY PENTECOSTAL IS REVIVAL FATHERS DID THAT. They didn't. They didn't do it either. There's none OF THEIR WRITINGS IN DADDY SEYMOUR OR ANY OF THOSE GUYS UH AGAINST THOSE THINGS PER SE. THEY ALL HAD THE SAME uh idea THAT YOU KNOW JUST SEE IT FOR WHAT IT IS AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LOSE THE SACREDNESS OF IT. IT ACTUALLY WHEN I FOUND OUT HOW IT GOT TO THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE THROUGH THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES, IT CAME FROM THE PURITANS, A PURITAN MOVEMENT WHO ROSE UP BETWEEN LUTHER AND WESLEY IN ENGLAND DURING THE TIME OF CROMWELL AND THEY ACTUALLY OUTLAWED CHRISTMAS. &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO. THAT WAS A PURITAN MOVEMENT THAT CAME ACROSS AND GOT INTO THE NEW ENGLAND STATES AND WENT THROUGH AMERICA. AND THERE WERE CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1600S THAT OUTLAWED IT. SEE, BUT I MY POINT IS TO YOU THAT IT WASN'T IT WASN'T FROM YOUR MESSENGERS. IT WASN'T FROM PAUL THROUGH COLUMBA. IT WASN'T IN LUTHER. IT WASN'T IN WESLEY. IT WASN'T IN THE ISUZA FATHERS. BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. BROTHER BRANDHAM UH CONTINUED WITH THESE SAME APPROACHES NOT ONLY TO CHRISTMAS BUT TO EASTER. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS. HE WOULD SAY, "WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO YOU WHETHER YOU HAD LENT OR NOT LENT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE LIFE?" SATAN DOESN'T CARE HOW RELIGIOUS YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; SO YOU'VE GOT THIS, YOU'VE GOT THAT, YOU'VE GOT THIS SEASON, YOU'VE GOT THAT SEASON, BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OF THE WORLD. YOU'RE LET'S BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY WE NEED TO PUT BACK CHRIST INTO THE PICTURE. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S JUST AN OVERVIEW. BROTHER BRANDHAM REPEATEDLY TAUGHT UH THAT CHRISTMAS AS COMMONLY CELEBRATED IS IS HEAVILY COMMERCIALIZED AND IT'S ROOTED IN NON-BIBLICAL TRADITIONS. AND HE WASN'T WRONG. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH. HE CRITICIZED, BROTHER BRENNHAM CRITICIZED HEAVILY THE PAGAN COMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF SANTA CLAUS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS, but he DID NOT AT ALL PROHIBIT CHRISTIANS FROM HONORING CHRIST'S BIRTH. INSTEAD, EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW IT WASN'T CHRIST'S BIRTH, BUT INSTEAD HE ENCOURAGED BELIEVERS TO treat Christmas with UH AS A SOLEMN DAY OF WORSHIP AND REFLECTION, KEEPING CHRIST AT THE CENTER. HE NEVER INTRODUCED, brother Brandham never introduced any new prohibitions or emphasis UH EMPHASIS RATHER INSTEAD HE MAINTAINED the tradition of treating the holidays as spiritually SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT NOT CENTRAL TO ANY KIND OF OUTWARD CELEBRATION. THE EMPHASIS FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS ON SPIRITUAL MEANING, ON WORSHIP, ON PERSONAL DEVOTION AND ON OUTWARD UH YOU KNOW ON OUTWARD UH UM NOT NOT ON AN OUTWARD or or ritual prohibition. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT THE QUOTES DON'T SUPPORT THAT. I WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO VOICE OF GOD RECORDINGS WHO HAS A POST ON THEIR ON THE VOICE OF GOD SITE UH YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT QUOTES WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM LAYS THAT OUT WHAT I'M SAYING. HE LAYS IT OUT IN VERY CLEAR TERMS and and he you SAY WELL HE RAGED AGAINST THE PENCIL. HE DID. HE RAGED AGAINST THE THE THE PAGAN CELEBRATION OF IT LEAVING CHRIST OUT OF THE PICTURE. HE RAGED AGAINST, YOU KNOW, TURNING THIS INTO WHISKEY PARTIES AND AND DRUNKEN PARTIES AND HE SHOULD AND YOU SHOULD RAIL AGAINST IT AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE IN OUR MINDS. WE SHOULD NOT BE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THOSE THINGS. SEE, SO THE IDEA YOU KNOW UH UH BROTHER BRANDHAM IN THESE IN THESE ITEMS UH IS IS VERY CLEAR. AMEN. NOW I want to I WANT TO AS I'VE SAID TO YOU TODAY, I'm not trying TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO HISTORY. UM AS ME AS MENTIONED EARLIER, I HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT BURDEN ON MY heart for a Christmas message. Uh one that actually um you KNOW CAME UPON me concerning uh THE ACTUAL JOURNEY OF THE THREE WISE MEN WHO CAME FOLLOWING a star to Jesus in the manger. THE IDEA IS THAT THEY DOUBTLESS HAD QUITE A BIT OF PREPARATION FOR SUCH A LENGTHY and difficult journey as it was from the east which was likely history shows likely a capital city in Persia or Babylon. And it was um it uh it was a uh it was not a journey of days. It was a a journey of many months. AND YET BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR YEARS THEY WERE TRAVELING. BUT DON'T FORGET THAT THESE WERE WISE MEN. THEY DIDN'T JUST GO, "HEY, THERE'S THERE'S A SIGN IN THE HEAVENS. LET'S GO GET ON OUR CAMELS AND GO." There's planning, THERE'S LOGISTICS, THERE'S FINANCES, THERE'S RESOURCES, THERE'S SUPPLIES, THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S LEARNING. WE GOT TO WE GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND SO, AS THEY JOURNEYED, YOU KNOW, AS THEY JOURNEYED, uh they surely had made UH AND CERTAINLY HAD ANTICIPATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THEY WOULD WHAT THEY WOULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH. THAT'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE DO. WE'RE ON A JOURNEY. WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS ALONG THE LIFE ALONG THE JOURNEY OF LIFE. AND I'M I'M NOT SAYING THEY HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT. AND AND AND I WOULD SAY VERY LIKELY THEY HAD TO MAKE SOME, YOU KNOW, MAKE SOME OF IT UP AS THEY WENT ALONG TO SAY NOTHING OF the seemingly bewilderment of the local population when they arrived in Jerusalem. AND UH EVEN THE GOVERNMENT UH WAS PUZZLED when they when they arrived. SO THERE'S A A TON OF HUMAN TEXTURE in all of that. and and and and and and NEITHER I NOR IS BROTHER BRANDHAM BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT THIS JOURNEY AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE HEART OF MY SERMON TODAY. I'm going to read you some snippets from THINGS HE SAID. AND I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT I'M NOT AND NEITHER WAS BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU KNOW, FORCING THE TEXT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WRITTEN THERE. BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF UH OF WHAT THE TEXT CAN QUIETLY ASSUME SOMETIMES BY WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. FIRSTLY, I THINK THE FIRST POINT THAT STRIKES MY HEART IS THAT THIS WAS NOT A SPONTANEOUS JOURNEY. They didn't JUST WAKE UP ONE DAY AND DECIDE, I NEED TO GO CHECK AND SEE IF I CAN FIND A NEW KING. NOBODY WOULD UNDERTAKE THAT KIND OF A JOURNEY WITHOUT PREPARATION, WITHOUT COMMITMENT, WITHOUT CONVICTION. BUT IT'S JUST LIKE IN MY MIND WHEN I GO BACK TO ELISHA being uh having his THE MANTLE OF ELIJAH LAID UPON HIM AND ELISHA IS PLOWING WITH 12 YOLK OF OXEN SHOWING THAT HIS family was a family of means. Uh you DIDN'T NORMALLY HAVE 12 TEAM OF OXEN unless your family was wealthy. SO I WOULD say that the world was Elisha's oyster for the taking. He probably had opportunities at the finest schools and THE FINEST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. HE HAD A LOT TO WALK AWAY FROM. AND WHEN ELIJAH PUT HIS HAND UPON HIM AND AND PUT HIS MANTLE UPON HIM, YOU KNOW, ELIJAH ELISHA SAID, "LET ME GO. THIS IS A GREAT HONOR. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. AND I KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. WHEN YOU'VE CAST YOUR MANTLE UPON ME, LET ME GO AND SAY SOMETHING TO MY PARENTS." AND ELIJAH TURNS AROUND AND SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THEE? I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION. I'VE ONLY DONE WHAT THE LORD TOLD ME TO DO. NOW YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE. BUT THINK WELL, ELISHA. THINK WELL BECAUSE I'M HATED BY THE PUBLIC. I'M HATED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE QUEEN WANTS TO KILL ME. I'M NOT POPULAR. THE CHURCHES HAVE THROWN ME ALL OUT. YOU BETTER THINK WELL, ELIJAH, CUZ YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAND TO A PLOW RIGHT NOW. AND YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF OPPORTUNITY OUT IN FRONT OF YOU. BUT DOWN THE ROAD, THERE'S GOING TO BE A HOLY MAN STAND ON THE EARTH AND SAY, "WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND TO THIS PLOW AND TAKES IT AWAY, HE HE OH MY, WHAT A TRAGEDY. YOU'RE YOU'RE NEVER SUPPOSED TO TAKE YOUR HAND AWAY FROM THIS PLOW." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO IT WAS IT WAS NOT SOMETHING WITHOUT CONVICTION OR COMMITMENT. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER ELSE WE SAY, THESE MEN HAD ALREADY COUNTED THE LOSS BEFORE THEY EVER SAW THE CHILD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And I think that's a lesson for us. AND SO THE BURDEN THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKE INTO MY HEART OVER LAST WEEKEND WAS THAT we too are on a journey to the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WE BEGAN A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY JUST LIKE THEY DID USING THAT USING THAT AS A TYPE AND SHADOW. WE BEGAN A JOURNEY. I I WASN'T IN IN IN IN PERSIA OR BABYLON AND I DIDN'T TRAVEL TO JERUSALEM OR BETHLEHEM, BUT I DID BEGIN A JOURNEY FROM THE WORLD TO THE WORD. AND I'M STILL ON THAT JOURNEY TODAY. AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU TODAY, JUST LIKE YOU COULD HAVE ASKED THEM, I I'M ASKING YOU TODAY, WHAT HAS BEEN OUR EXPERIENCES ALONG THE way on this journey from the world TO THE WORD? HOW ARE WE HOLDING UP? JUST AS THESE THREE WISE MEN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND WHEN YOU GET THERE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How are you handling your journey at this Christmas season? HOW ARE YOU HANDLING YOUR JOURNEY with its weariness at times? THE OBSTACLES THAT WE CONSTANTLY HAVE TO OVERCOME OR LET'S JUST BE HONEST THE THE PLAIN SASSIFRASS DISAPPOINTMENTS THAT POP UP ALONG THIS JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; Are you put off? ARE YOU DISCOURAGED? ARE YOU PUT OFF OR ARE YOU DISCOURAGED WITH THE POLITICAL UPHEAVAL THAT YOU SEE? THE DISHONESTY IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND IN GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. AND AND AND WHAT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT THE THE CONFUSION, THE THEOLOGICAL CONFUSION THAT THE WISE MEN ENCOUNTERED AMONG THE CLERGY WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND AND DISAGREEMENTS AND AND AND AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE DISAGREEMENTS AND THE PUSH BACK from the world against the word that we hold dear? HOW DO YOU HOW ARE YOU HANDLING THE CRITICISMS THAT COME TO US FROM THE RANKS OF THE MODERN CHRISTIAN CHURCH? I WOULD SAY TO YOU TODAY LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM, WHAT THINKY OF CHRIST? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU'RE ON A JOURNEY LIKE THEY WERE ON A JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IS THIS OPEN BOOK THAT HAS COME TO US IN THIS DAY? I WANT TO SAY THIS SLOWLY. IS THIS OPEN BOOK OF THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN RESTORED TO US IN THIS DAY? IS IT A LIVING EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST TO YOU? IS IT LIVING IN YOUR HEART DAILY? IF NOT, THEN YOU HAVEN'T MADE THE JOURNEY YET. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IT'S GOING TO LEAD YOU TO A LIVING EXPERIENCE. THIS JOURNEY ISN'T ABOUT PASSING TIME OR KEEPING A LIST OF DOS AND DON'TS OR BEING JUDGED IN HOLY DAYS AND HOLIDAYS AND AND MEATS AND DRINK OFFERINGS. NOT ABOUT THAT. I WOULD ONLY KNOW THIS THIS OF YOU. DO YOU KNOW HIM IN THE LIVING REALITY OF THE WORD &gt;&gt; THAT HE'S brought to us? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IT THIS WAY AND HE HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO TIE Paul's um Hebrews 12 12th chapter of Hebrews, Paul's lesson THERE ABOUT LAYING ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT OF UNBELIEF. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN COMMUNION 1962, "ALMIGHTY GOD, THE FATHER, OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, who raised him up from the dead and set him at the right hand of the majesty ever living to make intercessions upon the things that we believe that he did for us and confess it to be so." I love this. I love the humility of this prophet. It It gives me hope. WE PRAY, LORD GOD, THAT TONIGHT THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE OUR SINS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A PROPHET STANDING IN A PULL PIT praying this. &gt;&gt; I PRAY LORD THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE OUR SINS. HOW MANY WOULD SAY TODAY, I'M ON MY JOURNEY. I PRAY YOU FORGIVE MY SINS, LORD. &gt;&gt; SEE, OH, WE WANT TO KEEP UNDER THE BLOOD AT ALL TIMES FOR WE DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. ALL THINGS ARE ABOUT WOUND UP. WE FEEL, LORD, THAT THE COMING OF THE LORD IS AT HAND. Watch this. and we're fixing to take a journey. AND AS WE THINK OF A JOURNEY, WE MIGHT THINK OF SUITCASES AND EXTRA CLOTHING AND EXTRA SHOES. BUT HOW different from this journey? IT'S NOT PACKING UP. IT'S UNPACKING. LAYING ASIDE, AS YOUR GREAT SERVANT PAUL SAID IN THE BOOK OF HEBREWS, THE 12TH CHAPTER, WE LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND THE UNBELIEF THAT DOTH SO EASILY BESET US. IT DOES THAT SO EASILY. IT DOES THAT SO EASILY. YOU DABBLE IN THE WORLD AND LOSE YOUR PRAYER LIFE, YOU LOSE YOUR CHURCH ATTENDANCE, THE DEVIL WILL SO EASILY TAKE YOU DOWN A WORLDLY PATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PRIMROSE PATH THAT HAS NOTHING AT THE END OF IT BUT DISAPPOINTMENT. IT'S ALL BASED ON A LIE. [clears throat] So he SAYS WE LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND THAT WE MIGHT RUN WITH PATIENCE THE RACE THAT IS SET before us. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T ASSOCIATE THE JOURNEY OF THE THE WISE MEN or the suffering labor of Mary. And I and I and I I HOPE THIS DOESN'T OFFEND YOU. I'm going to say it anyway, BUT THERE'S NO WAY. AND PLEASE DON'T TRY TO TO SPEAK TO EVER SPEAK TO ME IN A WAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASSOCIATING THE SUFFERING AND THE JOURNEY AND THE TRIAL THAT THESE WISE MEN WENT THROUGH OR THE LABOR THAT MARY WENT THROUGH AND SOMEHOW ASSOCIATE THAT TO A MAN IN A FUZZY RED SUIT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL THE BRIGHT COLORED LIGHTS. WE SHOULD NEVER DO THAT. DON'T EVER BE GUILTY OF SUCH A THING AS AS HAVING THAT ABOVE WHAT THIS SHOULD MEAN IN YOUR LIFE. THIS I THIS IS GOD'S GIFT. HE GAVE US CHRIST. HE GAVE US THE WORD. HE GAVE US SIGNS AND WONDERS. GAVE US PREACHERS. &gt;&gt; SEE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT SHORT ON GIFT GIVING. BUT HE GIVES YOU THE BEST KIND. &gt;&gt; See the THE THE WAY THE WORLD GOES AFTER ALL THE FUZZY RED SUITS AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS. THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE CHRISTMAS TINSEL THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SO CONDEMNED. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY, FRIENDS, THAT ONCE YOU GO THERE, IT'S JUST A SHORT STEP TO REMOVING ALL THE SACREDNESS OF the Christmas season. &gt;&gt; AND ONCE YOU GO THERE, IT'S EVEN A SHORTER STEP TO REPLACING IT WITH DRUNKEN REALRY AND SIN. YOU SAY, "OH, I'd never do that." You can't imagine how easy that slippery slope, how slippery it is &gt;&gt; once you take away the sacredness of it UNTIL YOU FINALLY TURN WHAT SHOULD BE PERHAPS THE SECOND MOST SACRED TIME UH BEHIND EASTER PERHAPS AND YOU TURN THAT INTO A CAULDRON of perversion. And that's what the WORLD DOES. THAT'S THAT'S NOT IMAGINED. THAT'S NOT CONSPIRACY. YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's not me raining ON A PARADE. I'M I'M NOT DOING THAT. I LOVE THE FESTIVE HOLIDAY season that it brings. I love the children's play that we'll see here very shortly. I love the uh brother Brandham also. I I I LOVE THE WARM FEELINGS OF THAT YOU CAN SEE IT OF PUBLIC brotherhood and what's left of it. Anyway, and and you know THE WARM THINGS THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD TO SAY ABOUT a true Christmas. I'm going to give you A CHRONOLOGICAL SNIPPET, JUST A just a touching of some of the things he said. I'd invite you to THE VOICE OF GOD'S SITE AND READ ALL OF THOSE QUOTES um in depth. BROTHER BRANDHAM MENTIONS HERE. I'M JUST GIVING YOU SOME MENTIONS. 1954, WE'RE GOING TO GO CHRONOLOGICALLY. 1954 and divine healing. Everybody seems to be so friendly around CHRISTMAS TIME, WANTING TO help one another. IT'D BE GOOD IF IT STAYED CHRISTMAS, WOULDN'T IT? JUST CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME. 1959 questions and answers. WE WERE RIDING LAST NIGHT SHOWING THE KIDDIES ALL THE HOUSES DECORATED AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS awful nice and he he show HE HE TALKS ABOUT SEEING A NEON SIGN THAT SAID TRUSTING CHRIST WILL BE IN YOUR CHRISTMAS 1960 GOD'S WRAPPED GIFT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS A SPECIAL little blessing left for us. IT'S TOO BAD WE CAN'T HAVE THIS CHRISTMAS FEELING ALL THE TIME. People waving at you and saying the Lord bless you. THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE THAT THING ABOUT CHRISTMAS. We wish you UH THE BEST IN THIS uh these ULE TIDINGS IN THIS TIME OF FELLOWSHIP AROUND THESE holy days. I'm just reading a prophet. I I express to each and every one OF YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO YOU for your Christmas cards and your gifts. HOW THANKFUL WE ARE FOR THIS INNER CHRISTIAN experience Christmas in our hearts. 1962 PRESUMING NOT EXACTLY A MERRY CHRISTMAS BUT GOD'S BLESSING OF CHRISTMAS be upon you 1963 GOD'S GIFTS ALWAYS FIND THEIR PLACE WISH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS MAY THE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENT Jesus Christ be aresh in your heart &gt;&gt; AMEN HOW MANY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT HAVE JESUS CHRIST ARESH IN OUR HEART &gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW SO I I GET ALL OF THAT I GET BROTHER BRANDON UH AND AND AND AS I SAID TO YOU IN IN A JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY, THAT KIND OF AN ATTITUDE GOES BACK TO THE TO THE ISUZA FATHERS. THAT SAME ATTITUDE IS IN WESLEY'S WRITINGS. IT'S IN LUTHER'S WRITINGS. Uh and and and and THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING FROM THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION. BEFORE THE REFORMATION, CHRISTMAS WASN'T SUCH A THING. Uh but even COLUMBUS AND EVEN ST. MARTIN HAD NOTHING DEROGATORY TO SAY ABOUT IT. UH IN FACT IS YOU KNOW THERE THERE WAS ONE UM THEOLOGIAN BACK IN THAT DAY he was a contemporary of Martin and uh he he has a great uh what he calls a homaly they call it a homaly it's just a sermon what we call a sermon TODAY ABOUT THESE WISE MEN AND AND HOW THEY WHAT THEY WERE FOLLOWING IN THE supernatural and and I FORGET WHAT HIS NAME WAS I'VE GOT IT HERE IN MY NOTES I DON'T WANT TO CHASE IT DOWN BUT you know he WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF of St. Martin, our third messenger. AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NO INTERACTION, Martin was in tours of France and and uh uh um this GUY WAS IN WAS IN UH HE WAS THE bishop of of of OF CONSTANTINOPLE. AND SO WE FIND THAT THEY NEVER REALLY EXCHANGED CORRESPONDENCE. AND I THOUGHT IT IRONIC THAT THE HISTORY RECORDED THAT THIS MAN UH HE WAS CONSIDERED A A VERY ELOQUENT SPEAKER. EVERYBODY JUST LOVED THE WAY HE TALKED. HE WOULD HOLD PUBLIC SERMONS AND THOUSANDS WOULD GATHER AROUND BECAUSE HE SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY. AND THEY SAID THAT WHEN THEY WENT AND COMPARED HIM TO M TO ST. MARTIN THAT MARTIN MARTIN DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT. BUT WHAT HE DID HAVE WAS A LOT OF HUMILITY, A LOT OF SPIRITUALITY, AND A LOT OF THE POWER OF GOD IN HIS MINISTRY. I'LL TAKE THAT ANY DAY &gt;&gt; OVER ELOQUENT SPEECH. I WANT TO SEE THE POWER OF GOD. AS BROTHER MATT WAS SPEAK PREACHING THIS MORNING IN OUR SUNDAY SCHOOL, I WANT TO SEE THE POWER OF GOD IN OUR LIVES, FRIENDS. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO I I I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, THAT UM THAT THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU KNOW, HAD THOSE PLEASANT THINGS TO SAY. UM AND I GET IT. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT WHAT I'M POINTING TO UH AS IT IS IS IS A TRUTH THAT ALSO PLAYS OUT IN SOCIETY EVERY NEW YEAR. And we see it. WE SEE THE DRUNKEN REVALRY PARTIES. UH YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE DIE AFTER DRUNKEN CHRISTMAS PARTIES AND NEVER MAKE IT TO THE new year. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SAD CASE. I YOU KNOW THEY WERE I I WAS JUST READING SOME COMMENTARY ON and and and THE OBITUARY OF SOME OF THEM AND THEY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE OF THE comedians and and AND THERE'S A VERY FAMOUS COMEDIAN uh by the name of Chris Farley and his he he died like THAT FROM A DRUG OVERDOSE JUST LIKE BALUSHI ahead of him and just like CANDY AHEAD OF HIM AND AND and and HIS BROTHER IS TELLING THE STORY IN STARK TERMS AND HE HE TALKS ABOUT HIS RELAPSE INTO DRUGS AND AND AND DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY AND HE WAS PARTYING IT UP AND HE SAID HE DIED ON A COLD LENOLUM floor alone. &gt;&gt; They found him. HERE WAS A MAN FAMOUS, WORLD FAMOUS, MORE MONEY IN THE BANK THAN HE COULD SPEND. AND HIS BROTHER WRITES OF HIM, "HE DIED ALONE ON A COLD lenolium floor in an apartment in Chicago. They I found his body days later." SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DISPARAGING THINGS of the world and HOW THEY CELEBRATE IT. BUT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THE EVENT THAT I'M MINISTERING ON TODAY. THAT'S REALLY NOT THE BURDEN UH FROM THE LORD. I WANT TO FOCUS AS I'VE SAID TO YOU, I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR JOURNEY. OUR JOURNEY BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO ON A JOURNEY. AND AND THERE ARE THERE ARE NONE OF THE STORIES. IN FACT IS I ONLY READ ABOUT THE THREE WISE MEN. WHETHER YOU READ ABOUT THE SHEPHERDS, THE THREE WISE MEN, MARY AND JOSEPH, WHOEVER YOU READ ABOUT, IT ALL INVOLVED A JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; You see, AND SO THERE THERE WAS NONE OF THESE STORIES THAT ACTUALLY DIDN'T INVOLVE A JOURNEY. JOSEPH AND MARY, WHICH WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF A FORCED JOURNEY BECAUSE OF TAX UH COLLECTION. You've got the shepherds, YOU GOT THE WISE MEN, AND THEY AND THEY ALL [screaming] HAD TO BE willing to journey. Yeah, &gt;&gt; THE JOURNEY OF THE WISE MEN ALONE CERTAINLY THE longest of the three- es especially if they came from Persia or Babylon, you know, a long distance and AND YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT LOGISTICAL PLANNING. YOU'VE GOT ANIMALS. YOU'VE GOT SUPPLIES. YOU'VE GOT MONEY. YOU'VE GOT PROTECTION. YOU'VE GOT POLITICAL AWARENESS. THEY'VE GOT TO CROSS BORDERS. They've got to move through a Roman controlled territory. SO, SO IT WASN'T JUST ONE DAY THE WISE MEN WOKE UP AND SAID, "LET'S JUST GO ON A NICE little walk. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE CHRISTIAN WALK IS NOT JUST A NICE LITTLE WALK. WE'RE JOURNEYING TO SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A BELIEVER. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN. YOU'RE NOT HERE JUST TO COME TO A CHURCH AND PAY TITHES AND SING SONGS. AND IT'S MORE THAN THAT, FRIENDS. WE'RE WE'RE ON A GREAT JOURNEY. AND AS BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, IT'S NOT TIME TO PACK ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. IT'S TIME TO unpack &gt;&gt; the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOBODY UNDERTAKES THIS KIND OF A JOURNEY WITHOUT some preparation. and whatever else we could say. Uh these men had certainly counted that cost. Brother Brandham uh says to US IN A SERMON, EVERLASTING LIFE AND HOW TO Receive It, 1954, I love this uh uh this this quote. Uh, I'm going to read you a quote, but throughout the throughout the sermon, he starts trying to he he's telling the story, and brother Brandham was such a great storyteller, and he tells the story of these three wise men packing up their camels. AND HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT, YOU KNOW, COME TIME TO GO AND THE the wise man NUMBER ONE, YOU KNOW, with his frankincense gets on, HE'S READY TO GO. The one with HIS GOLD GETS ON, HE'S READY TO GO. AND THEN THERE'S THIS THIRD GUY AND BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TELLING THIS WHOLE SERMON IS ABOUT THIS NARRATIVE. IT'S A WONDERFUL SERMON IF you want to go listen to it. AND HE HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT WHEN HE GOT ON HIS HIS POOR HIS POOR BEAST OF BURDEN. HIS his bow legs were bowing. He had TOO MUCH JUNK, TOO MUCH STUFF. AND AND AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HE WAS GETTING LEFT BEHIND. HIS POOR OLD CAMEL COULDN'T COULDN'T KEEP UP AND HE WAS GOING TO GET LEFT BEHIND. AND SO BROTHER BRANDHAM GOES ON A LITTLE BIT. YOU'LL HEAR THE NARRATIVE OF IT IN A MINUTE. AND AND AND SUDDENLY, YOU KNOW, HIS WIFE'S GOING TO HEAR ALL THIS CLAMOR AND SHE LOOKS AROUND. WHAT IN THE WORLD, JOHN, are you doing? AND I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME WAS JOHN, BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD, JOHN, ARE YOU DOING? AND HE HE WAS AND AND HE SAYS SHE HE SAYS THINGS WERE SLINGING LEFT AND RIGHT, AND HE WAS UNPACKING. &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T PACKING UP TO GO ON A JOURNEY. HE WAS UNPACKING TO GO ON a journey. &gt;&gt; See? AND SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "THEY'RE TRYING TO PACK UP TO BE A CHRISTIAN. IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU need is to unpack to be a Christian. I COULD GO, HE SAYS IN ANOTHER STATEMENT, I COULD GO ALONG UNLESS I, YOU KNOW, I COULD GO ALONG ON THIS JOURNEY UNLESS I UNLESS I TOOK MY CARD TABLE, SEE, AND TRY TO HANG MY CARD TABLE on the camel, HANG A LITTLE TATTLING on the camel, HANG A LITTLE BACKBITING ON THE CAMEL, HANG IT ON THE CAMEL. THE OLD CAMEL CAN'T HARDLY MOVE, BOW-LEGGED ALMOST. HE BEGAN TO THROW TABLES ONE WAY AND PACKAGES THE OTHER WAY. AND I'M LAYING ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND SIN THAT DOES SO EASILY BESET me from THIS PARTICULAR QUOTE PARAGRAPH 178 EVERLASTING LIFE AND HOW TO RECEIVE IT. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE? He says, "I CAN SEE THE OTHERS GOING MOVING ON AND THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW HE GOT DOWN AND LOOKED AT THAT STAR AGAIN." That's what some of us need to do, friends. &gt;&gt; Take a fresh look at that star. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; FIRST THING YOU KNOW, HE GOT DOWN AND LOOKED AT THAT STAR AGAIN. AND SO THE FIRST THING HE BEGAN TO THROW TABLES ONE WAY AND PACKAGES THE OTHER WAY. THE WIFE SAID, "WHERE YOU GOING?" JOHN SAID, "I'M LAYING ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT THAT DOTH SO EASILY BESET ME, THAT I'VE GOT TO RUN THIS RACE WITH PATIENCE, FOR STRAIGHT IS THE GATE AND NARROW IS THE WAY AND FEW THERE WILL BE THAT FIND IT." THAT'S SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE FEW WHO ARE WILLING TO UNPACK, &gt;&gt; FEW WHO ARE WILLING TO GO ON THIS [screaming] JOURNEY AND STAY ON THE JOURNEY. SEE, AND SHE SAID AND AND [screaming] SHE SAID, "I CAN HEAR HER SAY OR HE SAYS, THERE'LL BE FEW THAT FIND IT. THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR YOU AND JESUS. NOBODY ELSE CAN GO THROUGH. JEWISH, JUST YOU AND JESUS." AMEN. She said, I COULD HEAR HER SAY, "WELL, LOOK, YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR COMPASS. I DON'T NEED ANY COMPASS." WELL, YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR SEMINARY DEGREE. YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR BACHELORETTE SERVICES AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU HANG ON. SAID, "LISTEN, I DON'T NEED ANY COMPASS. HOW YOU GOING TO GO THEN?" HE POINTED UP TO A STAR. HALLELUJAH. HE POINTED UP TO A STAR. I'M GOING GOD'S PROVIDED WAY. GOD PROVIDED ME A STAR TO FOLLOW THAT'LL TAKE ME TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, THEY WERE FOLLOWING A SIGN THAT IN THEIR WORLD ACTUALLY MEANT ROYALTY. THAT WAS THE STAR SIGN THAT THEY SAW. I DID A BIG DEEP DIVE ON THAT. THEY WERE ACTUALLY SEEING A sign that indicated royalty was being born in THE EAST. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BEGIN TO SHAPE THEIR EXPECTATIONS WHETHER THEY WANTED it to or not. I mean, if you're going to see a king, you're going to have certain expectations. &gt;&gt; They're going to be unavoidable. &gt;&gt; See, if you're IF YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO HEAVEN, THERE THERE'S SOME THINGS, FRIENDS, THAT YOU SHOULD JUST EXPECT. &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD EXPECT TRIALS. BUT PETER WOULD SAY, EVEN FIERY TRIALS, DON'T THINK OF THEM AS A STRANGE THING. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO EXERCISE SOME PATIENCE. AND THE APOSTLE WOULD SAY, "SO LET PATIENCE HAVE HER WORK." &gt;&gt; SO WHY WOULD HE SAY YOU SHOULD LET PATIENCE HAVE HER WORK IF HE WOULDN'T NEED to say that to you? See, &gt;&gt; SO SO THERE IT WAS GOING TO SHAPE THEIR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH WAS CERTAINLY UNAVOIDABLE. SO IT'S not a stretch to imagine uh that THEY MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED A PALACE OR a royal household. WE KNOW WHEN THEY GOT BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM, HERE'S WHAT HERE'S WHAT I DIDN'T FIND AMONG COMMENTATORS that Brother Brandham talks about. These were actually Hebrew scholars and they were in the east studying for their degrees. AND SO WHEN THEY SEE A SIGN OF ROYALTY TO THEM, IT MEANS ONE THING, MESSIAH. IT'S NOT JUST A KING. SO NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK TO A NATION WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE EXPECTING A MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE COMING BACK TO A NATION WHO OUGHT TO KNOW PROPHECY. AND SO WHY WOULDN'T THEY THEN EXPECT THE ROYAL FAMILY IN THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THAT THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THIS IS AN THAT THEY WERE SHOWING UP WAS AN ACT OF PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED. AND SOMETIMES I WONDER DO WE REALLY SEE THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE WORLD? DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE MADNESS YOU SEE IN THE WORLD IS PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED? DO YOU REALIZE THAT A MESSAGE HAD TO COME TO PERFECT THE BRIDE IS PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED? DO YOU REALIZE THAT THERE HAD TO BE EAGLES HERE AND EAGLES SCREAM? THAT'S PROPHECY. YOU ARE PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RELIGIOUS LEADERS, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY WOULD HAVE SAW THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE THINK THAT RELIGIOUS LEADERS WOULD HAVE COME TOGETHER AND AND MARSHALED AROUND THE WORD TO TO SUPPORT THE PROPHECY. INSTEAD, THEY ARRIVE TO JERUSALEM AND JERUSALEM IS PUT INTO A STATE OF CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BEWILDERMENT. INSTEAD, THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL STARTLED AND THEY'RE ASTONISHED AT THEIR DOCTRINE. THE ONLY THING HEROD FEELS IS THREATENED. THE WHOLE CITY IS TROUBLED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, that's important. &gt;&gt; THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE THEIR THEIR THEIR obedience unsettled man-made systems. &gt;&gt; That's what you're reading. That's I'm not I'M NOT STRETCHING THE TEXT. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE READING IN THE SILENCE BETWEEN THE lines that YOU'RE READING THAT OBEDIENCE TO GOD'S WORD UNSETTLES man-made systems. TRUTH ARRIVING SHOULD ALWAYS do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; TRUTH LIVED THROUGH YOUR LIFE SHOULD UNSETTLE MAN-MADE SYSTEMS AROUND YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THEY'RE CHRISTIANS IN A MAN-MADE SYSTEM, YOUR TRUTH, THAT YOU'RE LIVING SHOULD UNSETTLE THEM. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A SITUATION WHERE WHERE THEY'RE JUST THEY DON'T FEEL ANYTHING. THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST CAN GO RIGHT ALONG BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF IF MAYBE YOU BELIEVE EXACTLY WHAT THEY BELIEVE BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE WAYS WE we conduct ourselves. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IS THIS OKAY FOR CHRISTMAS? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ON A JOURNEY, FRIENDS. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, EVENTUALLY THEY GOT TO BETHLEHEM. THERE'S NO THRONE. THERE'S NO CROWN. THERE'S NO POLITICAL welcome committee. There's just a child. Sometimes on this journey, on this journey to the word, I want to say to you that sometimes our expectations have to be adjusted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, we don't go to the wisdom of this world. We go to God. Sometimes our expectations, it don't come out like we thought it would. We're on a journey. We're trying to do the best and we have an expectation when we get there. What are you expecting for your diligence to the Lord? What are you expecting to get out of coming to church multiple times a week? What are you expecting when you give to the kingdom of God? What are you looking for? &gt;&gt; What's the purpose of YOUR JOURNEY? I WANT I WANT YOU TO THINK INTROSPECTIVELY TODAY, FRIENDS. That's the real BURDEN OF MY HEART. THAT'S WHAT THE LORD ASKED ME. THE LORD SAID, "YOU'RE ON A JOURNEY, TOO. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING WHEN YOU GET THERE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; When I read THE BOOK OF ACTS, I EXPECT GOD TO OPERATE IN MY life in power and demonstration. &gt;&gt; WHEN I READ ABOUT WHAT THE EARLY CHURCH WAS, I EXPECT IT TO BE ON FIRE FOR THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; WHEN I READ ABOUT GOD SENDING A MESSENGER IN ANY AGE, I'M LOOKING FOR THE UNADULTERATED WORD OF GOD. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I M I FOUND MY EXPECTATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LIFE HASN'T ALWAYS TURNED OUT LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD. BUT REAL REVEALED FAITH DOESN'T mean you have every answer all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It means it only means that you [clears throat] you keep moving even when you don't have the answer. One commentator said, "They came, the wise men, they came seeking. They left worshiping." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe I could hope that that's your journey to this service today. You came seeking, you leave worshiping. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, they weren't the only ones traveling. Mary traveled from Nazareth to Judea. I'm going to close just in a moment to see Elizabeth emotionally. If you if you read anything at all in that story of Mary going to see Elizabeth, emotionally, spiritually, socially, you there was nothing for Mary but uncertainty. She carried she carried within her a promise that at that time she couldn't and hadn't and couldn't even fully grasp. &gt;&gt; Her journey isn't explained to her. She's not getting applause &gt;&gt; on her journey to see Elizabeth. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE LORD SAID I'M GOING TO GO SEE ELIZABETH. I'm going to make this journey easy for you. THE LORD DIDN'T PROMISE HER ANY OF THAT THING. JUST SAID GO BECAUSE ELIZABETH ALSO WAS WITH CHILD NOW GO SEE HER AND MARY UH [screaming] AGAINST ALL UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID YOU SAY OH SHE JUMPED THROUGH THE CEILING AND HAD ALL KINDS OF POWER AND SPOKE IN TONGUES NO SHE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT SHE JUST ACCEPTED SHE JUST ACCEPTED WHAT THE ANGEL SAID AND STARTED WALKING TO SEE ELIZABETH SHE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS FRIENDS SHE SHE DIDN'T SHE DIDN'T GET IT AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET ANY RELIEF UNTIL SHE'S TALKING TO ELIZABETH AND WHEN SHE SAYS THE NAME JESUS ELIZABETH STARTS REJOICING SAID, "WHEN YOU SAID THAT NAME, THE DEAD BABY IN MY WOMB JUMPED TO LIFE." I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I STILL JUMP TO LIFE WHEN I HEAR THE NAME JESUS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. IT SOUNDED LIKE AN EAGLE SCREAM, BUT IT WAS A NAME OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; And it LEAPT IN YOUR HEART AND YOU'VE BEEN A LIVING VESSEL EVER SINCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD I HEARD THAT NAME ECHO in my soul. The real Jesus of the real Bible. Joseph and Mary had a journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem. That was certainly not a convenient reason and certainly not a convenient time. We're in that season that we think it was. We know it wasn't this time of the year, but we celebrate the I imagine I don't uh I don't remember precisely what all the script entails, but uh you know I I think it certainly entails the nativity and that journey of Joseph and Mary. Uh my goodness, you know uh that wasn't an easy one either. And I I found it interesting in the Bible that Joseph never speaks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the whole text. He never utters a word. We hear him. We hear a narrative of him doing this or that. [snorts] But what you find is that he just walks along. He leads. He protects. He obeys. Another commentator said of Joseph, "Sometimes the holiest journeys are silent ones." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's not about jumping all over the building or running all over the platform making a lot of noise. It's it's sometimes it's just silent obedience. One day after another day, this Christmas, the previous Christmas, from there to here, from here to the next one, if there's a next one, I just want to be walking steadily in the promise of God's word. The shepherds didn't plan a journey. [laughter] They didn't get up that day planning a journey. They got interrupted into one. &gt;&gt; How many How many can RELATE TO THAT? I WASN'T PLANNING TO DO THIS. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT AND SUDDENLY I GOT interrupted and NOW I'M ON A JOURNEY. HOW'D YOU GET ON? HOW'D YOU GET HERE? I GOT I'VE BEEN ON A JOURNEY. HOW'D YOU GET ON JOURNEY? I DON'T KNOW. ONE DAY I WAS GOING THIS WAY IN LIFE AND THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP AND I WAS GOING THIS WAY. DO YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS? NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M JUST WALKING BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT NEXT WEEK WILL HOLD OR NEXT YEAR OR IF THERE'LL BE A NEXT YEAR. I JUST KNOW I'M ON A JOURNEY FROM THE WORLD TO THE WORD AND I AIN'T STOPPING TILL I GET THERE. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY EXPECTATIONS GET DOWN, HOW MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS, HOW MANY OBSTACLES, I'LL JUST KEEP STEPPING OVER THEM. I'LL JUST KEEP GOING. I'LL JUST KEEP PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF ANOTHER. I DON'T NEED ALL THE ANSWERS. MY FAITH DOESN'T NEED ALL THE ANSWERS. &gt;&gt; SEE, HAD NO SUPPLIES. THINK OF THOSE POOR SHEPHERDS. NO PREPARATION, NO WARNING AT ALL. BUT I I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FRIENDS. Revelation demands movement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even if it even if it does interrupt your routine, &gt;&gt; even if it interrupts your whole life, &gt;&gt; revelation demands movement. So where are you headed today, friends? &gt;&gt; As I come to a close, &gt;&gt; where are you headed today? Stand with me, brother Mack. Come on and get prepared. And [clears throat] musicians, uh, make your way. Is that a fair question? Where are you headed today? What does this Christmas mean to you? We're at a Christmas where we had people with us at the last Christmas that aren't at this Christmas. And next Christmas, some of us may be gone and maybe all of us gone. Wouldn't that be amazing? So, if revelation demands movement and no matter what it interrupts in your life, then where are you headed? And what does this Christmas season mean to you? I'll have a wonderful time with my family just like I do every year. One of my favorite family times. But the thing I can't get off of my mind is when I look at a calendar and it says December 2025. What? And I see another calendar already that says January 2026. I feel a feeling that the time of our great journey to the skies is almost here. &gt;&gt; So whatever your Christmas plans are this year, God bless you. Don't be a part of the world. Keep the sacredness in intact. Use this time like the messengers advised. Use this time to be a witness. You'll never get a better opportunity. You might not have all the answers, friends, but your journey to the sky is coming soon. I want to be ready. How about you? You want to be ready for that? Say, Lord, I'm on a journey today and I want to make it to the end. Oh God, let's bow our heads. Father, I thank you for the delivery of this sermon. It unbburdened me, Lord. I feel quite finished. I feel like you said everything that you wanted to say, and I'm grateful to you for the things I was able to uncover. Lord, I'm thankful for these people who have sat here today, Lord, gathered on this Christmas holiday. I hope they're here for more than just [music] a children's play. They're going to get a big benefit out of that. But I hope they're here for more than that. I hope you mean more than that to them. Lord, if we want to see our children raised in the admonition of God, if we want to see them keeping Christ in this season, maybe they need to see the adults keeping [music] Christ in the season. I pray you'll grant it to us today. Lord, we we love you and we thank you for this people. Commit the balance of this service. Bless our little people as they come, Lord, with their little hearts shining. They'll children I've I've talked to so many adults who were in children's plays as little children who did nativity plays and things of Easter. They never forgot it. It it it it echoed through their life all the days, Lord. Even as in their elder years, they never forgot those times. So, I pray today that you will live in their little hearts, Lord. and may it be a a lesson of humility to us. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm nothing. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Sister Joy is transitioning. Go ahead and transition, [music] sister. &gt;&gt; Unlikely [music] a place for his word to [music] unfold.

I will say while we're getting situated If anybody can't see fully that's sitting on this side, if you'd like to move over into the middle or if you if you need to move so you can see better, now is your chance. [snorts] Okay. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Actually, can if we can kill this row, I can do it. Actually, sorry AV team. You're going to hate us. The lights's got to go. In the city of Bethlehem, there lived a potter named Jude. He was loved and honored by all who knew him. One night, Jude sat alone in his humble little shop reading the scrolls of the prophet Isaiah. He said to himself, &gt;&gt; "Lord, I have waited for your coming for so long. If only I could see you." [sighs] &gt;&gt; I am a foolish man, me, a simple potter in this small town making such a request for the Lord. &gt;&gt; He blew out his candle and got ready to lay down to rest. When he heard a voice, call his name. &gt;&gt; Jude, my friend, you have asked to see me. Tomorrow I shall pass by. If you see me and bid me enter, I shall be your guest at your table. &gt;&gt; Jude did not sleep well that night, and before it was dawn, he rose and made ready to meet the Lord. Eagerly, he looked out, waiting for the Lord to arrive. There he saw an old, feeble man passing by, looking half frozen from the cold. He was blowing on his hands to warm them. Jude called out to the man. &gt;&gt; Come in, my friend, and warm yourself. &gt;&gt; The old man entered his humble shop and warmed up by the fire. They had something to eat and drink. Then the old man was on his way. An hour passed and Jude saw a His feet were wrapped in rags, limping slowly down the street. The potter called and invited him in. He wrapped his feet in a clean cloth and gave the man a sturdy walking stick. When the man left, there was new strength in his step. As evening approached, the potter became discouraged. Just then, a young woman walked by carrying a baby. Jude brought her in to share his dinner with her. He took a few blankets and gave them to the woman to keep her baby warm. Then he put her on his donkey and he took her and the baby to the next town. It was now late into the evening when he returned. Jude was sure that he had missed the Lord. He cried out, &gt;&gt; "Why, Lord, why did you not come? Was I so unworthy?" &gt;&gt; Suddenly, out of the silence, Jude again heard the gentle voice, sweeter than any other. &gt;&gt; "My child, I kept my word. Three times I visited you and three times you showed your love for me. I was the old man. I was the poor I was the cold and hungry woman and her baby. You warned me at your fire. You bandaged my feet. You fed me and clothed me. For it shall be said, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brethren, you do it unto me." Jude humbly bowed his head, thanking the Lord for every person that had passed by that day. And from that day on, Jude did his best to show love to anyone he could. The years went by and God blessed his little shop. Jude grew his business to include a bakery, a woodworking storefront, and an inn for weary travelers. [applause] It was at that time the Roman Emperor Augustus decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire. So everyone went to be registered at the city of their birth. For a quiet little town like Bethlehem, this was quite a busy time for Jude. As the days went on, he found himself exhausted trying to meet the demands of the weary travelers. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, check out the oatmeal pies. The in was full and evening was coming to an end. Jude was relieved as he approached the quiet of the night. It was peaceful. He saw a couple of weary travelers headed his way. My wife and I need a place to stay for the evening. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but my in is completely full. &gt;&gt; Please, sir, we won't take anything. Can't you see my wife is getting ready to have a baby? I'm very sorry. If I had a room to put you in, I would wait. I do have something, but it's a stable for the animals. Definitely not a fitting place for the baby to be born. &gt;&gt; We will take it. And may the Lord bless you, for this thing that you're doing it is as unto him. &gt;&gt; That was an odd thing to say, thought Jude. And he led Joseph and Mary to the stable, making them as comfortable as he could. Nearby there was a hillside where shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks. A bright light shone, and the angel of the Lord stood before them and said, &gt;&gt; "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which will be to you, for there is born to you this day in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. You will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, laying in a manger. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to good men will. &gt;&gt; As the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds went to Bethlehem to see that thing which was come to pass. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, inkeeper. We have been searching for the new king. We were told Bethlehem is where able to find him. &gt;&gt; A newborn king in this small town. I am not sure you will find a newborn king. Plus, I am much too busy tending to my guests. I even have a poor couple in my stable that is getting ready to have a baby. &gt;&gt; Wait, you said a baby's about to be born? &gt;&gt; Yes, in my tiny simple stable. &gt;&gt; That's going to be where we will find him. Hurry. Jude watched the shepherds rush off towards the stable, thinking how unusual they were acting. A newborn king in Bethlehem. Jude then remembered years ago when he was longing for the coming of the Messiah and had asked the Lord if he could just see him. In the distance, Jude heard the sound of a baby's cry. [crying] &gt;&gt; Could it really be him? Thank you, Lord, for letting me see you once again. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Little town [singing] of Bethlehem, how still we see these lights. Yet in the midst of such serenity, I hear a tiny great baby cry. in Jews [music and singing] to come where the canada sang with prophecies about his [music] birth of those stained [singing] glass walls. Our savior came to earth cuz great things of come from silent night. He chose a [music and singing] quiet simple stable instead of glitter noise [music and singing] and light. Lord, help us just to [singing] pull away from all the [music] bus of life. Cuz great things often [singing] come from silent night. Still waters run deep. So I've [music and singing] heard it told. But in this noise [singing] of hurry, I see a shallowess unfold. We need to take the [music] time to spend some quiet time alone with Christ. cuz that's [music] the only [singing] way his work can bring forth great [music] things of our lives. Cuz great things [music] of come from silent night. [music] He chose a quiet [singing] simple stable instead of letter. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; noise [singing] and lies. Just help us just to [singing] pull away [music] from all the bus of life. Cuz great [music] things [singing] often come from silent night. Oh, silent night. Oh holy [singing] night, wonderous star now led by life. They that wait upon the law shall renew their [music] strength. So be [music] still my soul and know [singing] that he is God. Cuz great things [music] often come from silent night. He chose a [music] quiet, simple, stable instead of glitter noise and life. Help us just [music and singing] to pull away from all the bus of life. Cuz great things [music and singing] often come from silent night. All is calm, all [music] is bright. [singing] around your mer [singing] and child. Holy heaven so tender and I sleep [crying] in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's give him another hand. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You did such a good job. Thank you. [applause] [applause] Beautiful. Father, we're grateful this wonderful day here. Another service, Lord, concluded for a Christmas season presentation. So grateful all these years, Lord. One is just it just continues to get more and more special. So today, [music] may you go with us, dismiss us, and you care. May your great blessing be upon us all on this journey of life that we're on. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; May we find Lord that which we have looked for all these years Lord someday that great journey to the sky. We commit ourselves into your hands [music] to this end. May you lead us and guide us like that those same wise men Lord following that star. May lead us commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. Turn somebody's hand [music] to be dismissed in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I want you. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Ah.
