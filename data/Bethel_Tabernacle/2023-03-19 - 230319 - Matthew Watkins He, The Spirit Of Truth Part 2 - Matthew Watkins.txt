hand clap of Praise hallelujah amen he's worthy amen first John chapter 4 thank you for all the music God bless you amen this morning good to be here in the house of the Lord first John chapter 4 we'll just begin reading here at the first verse and I just want to take a text here what we took part two to what we preached on Wednesday and we won't read that scripture again but we're just going to read here from first John chapter 40. you love the Lord Jesus amen I'm just so thankful that uh he's faithful always amen and we want to be in prayer for my dad today my pastor he's actually here in the back but just suffering from shingles in his head and wasn't able to preach today something that just started a few days maybe a few days ago or so and uh so he's in a lot of pain and suffering and he can't move at all he he said he's found a secret to manage his pain and that was to not move and then not talk so you can't preach if you can't move and can't talk so uh we want to be remembering him how many will you of you will pray for him amen even when we pray over our scripture we'll just pray amen for a pastor so we just want to uh continue on from where we were Wednesday let's just begin reading here at the first verse I'm going to preach to you again on he the spirit of Truth beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now now we're even now already is it in the world now remember what brother Branham teaches us in the anointed ones at the end time that what does Christ mean Christ means the anointed one is that clear we're clearly taught that what does anointing mean it means what does Christ mean it means an anointed one there there will rise false Christ which brother Branham would say that would mean false anointed ones so let's read this back up here at verse three let's read it one more time in every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God now remember not just pointing back to 2000 years ago many people can point to that appearing of Christ coming in the flesh and say that was God but they they won't admit that or recognize that present day they never have and they never will only the elect can recognize Christ can you say Amen that has come in the flesh and confess Christ Has Come In the Flesh notice this here in verse 3 and this is that Spirit of anti-anointing that's really what it means this is that Spirit of anti-anointing antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world you are of God I'm thankful for that little children have and have overcome them because greater is he that is inside of you than he that is in the world amen they are they are of the world therefore let's keep reading here in verse five they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error verse 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sin beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another hereby notice this here we all ought to love one another let's read the next verse verse 12 no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us his Spirit Lord we're thankful this morning as we just bow our heads here Lord and we're so thankful for that all-sufficient name the name of Jesus the name that is that was given that is above every name Lord and we declare it today father is a group of people all here Lord in one place Lord now we just move aside from those natural elements Lord and those Natural Things Lord we move aside from our our own mental thinking Lord and we move into a channel Lord where you can commune and we can commune with you that's our prayer Lord Jesus is that we would enter into another dimension Lord another Channel where we could commune with you because we just want to say Lord with an uplifted hand we love you Lord Jesus we thank you Father for this place that we can gather and commune with you and we just ask you now would you come and take Lord uh the word that you've spoken Lord father make it fresh make it real to your children how we need a fresh touch from above Lord I pray God for my dad Lord in the back here today couldn't preach Lord but you have all things in control we know that Lord father you said many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord God delivereth them from them all so God we pray Lord for a healing touch to in his body Lord I pray fathers we call upon your name right now we lift our voices up and say God may you move right now Jesus and touch him in his body Lord we rebuke this demon of of shingles we rebuke it in his body Lord you said these signs shall follow them that believe they'll lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover Lord they'll ask anything in my name so God we're asking because you told us to will you touch him supernaturally Lord we ask it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for this church Lord in this audience now we just give it to you in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated amen thank you God bless you you could put up that slide thank you brother Mark let's just keep reading here in first John chapter 4. if you have your Bible just keep it open I don't know what just happened to the monitor if you could fix just reverse whatever you just did thank you amen notice here thank you it was notice this is pick it up here again actually let's move to First John chapter five can we do that one chapter over you don't have to put this up uh brother Mark you could just keep my slides up and uh we want to look at it here together who so this is this is first John 5 verse 1. whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begot loveth loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him but but notice by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God I'm hearing Pages turn so that's all right make sure you got it and your phone or in your Bible uh here this morning we want to read it together I believe it's important to read the word of God you believe that and it's important for us to to read it and so notice he says this for this is the love of God verse 3 that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous how many could just say that today to the Lord Lord I keep your Commandments and they're not Grievous to me in other words they're not burdensome I don't live what I live because of a law I don't live them because of pressure I'm not living them what what a horrible life that would be to live a life that was Grievous that you did what you did just because of pressure or just because of uh of of out of fear I don't serve the Lord based upon fear that is going to destroy me or even fear uh you know that that some bad thing will happen to me in my life but I live and serve the Lord Jesus because I love him because I love his word it's what Jesus is saying here this is what first John is saying here when he says the Commandments are not Grievous for for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood and even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witnessed because the spirit is truth we took time to preach to you that on Wednesday that the spirit of the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth and that truth is a person can you say Amen this morning Spirit truth is not a Doctrine truth is not a teaching though we teach it though it's it is as we believe the truth that's been restored does come with Doctrine but truth is a person and inside of that person is attributes and the attribute of that person is not Darkness the Bible says that in him there is no Darkness at all there is light uh and he's the Father of Lights he's the light over the world and so there's no darkness in him there's no misunderstanding in God he there's there's no confusion uh in God and so when you have his Spirit of his Spirit doesn't bring confusion it brings a soundness to your mind it brings a soundness to your spirit it brings a settledness in spite of everything that's happening in your life the spirit of God will will settle you it won't you won't be in an upheaval you'll be settled in your spirit say brother Matt does that mean we can't get enough evil no it certainly doesn't mean that we're still the Bible says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so there's two of me there's one that's inside of me that's Jesus and then there's one out here that can get confused that can get misunderstood it can get in an upheaval it could become unsettled but I've got something living on the inside of me that stabilizes me in circumstances when I can't understand and I can't explain there's something inside of me that stayed realizes me and that's the spirit of Truth he's a person can you say Amen this morning I need your amens I learned it about eight o'clock this morning I was going to be preaching so you pull on the word of God Amen God will give you something uh and and so notice here this is this is what the Bible says it says we spoke on this on on uh Wednesday and we spoke of this scripture here in first John and and notice this in first John chapter 2 turn back in your Bible to chapter two I'm writing to you little children because your sins have been forgiven first this is first John uh two let me make sure you get it in your Bibles on your phones however you got to get it get it amen if and I believe it it'll do you good if you read it with your eyes this morning notice this here this is First John chapter 2 and verse 12. first John chapter 2 and verse 12. I read unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father I have written unto you I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because you're strong and the word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one now notice here verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever now notice our verse here again love not the world this is what the what we spoke on Wednesday this is the cosmos it means the structure or the the order and and it's the as we said it's the opposite of the word chaos chaos meaning disorder and dysfunction you could say this world is a world of chaos if there was ever a more chaotic time it's the day and age that you live in today it's an age of chaos but we know that that in first John he's speaking in first John 2 this is a world order we read it in first John chapter 4 and chapter five uh you you have overcome the world little little children he that loves God is is not of the world but he's of the father and so notice this here don't love the world and so you say well God is the god of love I understand that God's the god of love but in order to love you've got to hate in fact you by contrast God if he has if he's absolutely love then that means he has to hate and that's a strong word that the world doesn't like today it's a world that's not popular the world hate and we have enough we have enough hate we need to end hate hate speech and and that's I'm sure what they would call most of our sermons that we preach from this Pulpit here today is most of the world and the in the in the ways of the road would call this sermon hate speech and we don't need hate we just need love God is love and and so we just need to love listen I understand that God is love I understand that love is the greatest weapon that God has ever given to man brother Branham said Is Love perfect love casteth out all fear and so we preach love we pray we we preach it in the in the in the way that the Bible teaches love not the way that the world believes in love not the way that the world teaches love or that Hollywood teaches love because that's a perversion of the true love of God listen to me friends if you think that Hollywood has the true understanding of what love is you're under a delusion of the devil Hollywood's love is is a is a perversion of true love first John chapter 4 verse 7 it say we just read it we're told to love one another and everyone who who loves this of God and and knows God in verse 8 it says the one who doesn't love doesn't know God for God is love it's repeated in verse 11 of chapter four if God so loved us we ought also to love one another so there are certain things in the Bible that we are commanded to love one of them is each other and I know that we believe in a god of Miracles so we can say Amen to that to that verse we can have love for one another and even Jesus said how will they know that you're my disciples that you have love one for another it doesn't mean that we all agree on everything it doesn't mean that we're all in syncing and Harmony that we never I heard it hurt each other's feelings or we never offend each other listen to me I'm just going to go ahead and tell you today I'm going to hurt your feelings I'm sure you're gonna hurt mine if you get to know me and maybe not here today but if you know me if you're a friend of mine and you have a friend I'm sure listen even that wife is going to hurt you that husband that you love it's gonna hurt your feelings but that doesn't change that there's a Love or there's a union or there's a bond there's something that's Inseparable one with another that's why brother Branham says you ever talk about it Branham you're going to get all the branhams to fight and he says because that's what happens in the front yard but don't you know in the backyard where no one's looking branhams are fighting branhams but we keep those fights in the backyard we don't take them to the front yard in the front yard we have each other's back oh can I get an amen this morning in the front yard we encourage one another we love one we might have our disagreements we might not see uh things directly or eye to eye but there's a there's a love you say then what is that thing that joins us one to another it's the love of Christ which is the word and so because you love the word and I love the word then it doesn't matter what our human disagreements are there's an affinity we have with one another that we love the word oh let me just preach to you this morning there's only one thing that will unite us and it's something it's not a Doctrine it's not a theory it's not a teaching it's the word of the hour there's only one thing that unites the body of Christ and that's the word that's been revealed notice this here he says if you love God it's repeated again God is love and the one who who abides and love abides in God and God abides in him we get that so but if you go to the Old Testament in Psalms chapter 97 and and verse 10. he says hate evil you who love the Lord hold on a minute I thought I'm supposed to love well if you love that means you hate wait hold on brother Matt did you say that right I said it right notice this this is Psalms 97 verse 10 and so he says hate evil you who love the Lord so if you love God then there's going to be things you hate say that again if you have the love of God in you then if God hated you'll hate I'm just preaching the most simplistic Sunday school ABCs it's not complicated here this morning it's pretty simple if you've got the love of God then by necessity you have a hatred for certain things you'll also hate the things that God hates and so what is love it defines an attitude what is hate it defines an attitude towards something or an object or an idea and so the love of God and notice this here in Psalms 97 he says hate evil you who love the Lord Psalms 119 verse 104 from your precepts this is what David says from your precepts I get understanding therefore I hate the evil way this is Psalms 119 brother Mark he says from your precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every evil way verse 13 I hate those who are double-minded but I love your law verse 128 of Psalms 119 I esteem all your precepts how many can say that today to say Lord I value I esteem I hold in high regard all of your word not just some of your word not the parts that I like and the parts I don't like I just sort of even minimize over here and I don't major no the True Believer says Lord I love all of your word I love every part of it God I'm raising my hands so you can raise yours I love every part of it God I love even the parts I don't like you say there's parts of the word you don't like this old for rotten flesh has parts that I don't like but I love every part of it I believe every part of it I love every part that I don't understand I love every part that I do understand I love every part that I can explain but I also love every part that I can explain why because I love the word and David could say I love I esteem all of thy precepts concerning all things to be right and I hate every false way now Believers I need your help this morning I need you to pull on the word of God and every church service their spirits that are good they're spirits that are evil they're spirits of brother Adam said there's Angels trying to energize people's face there's also demon Spirits trying to discourage you trying to criticize what the preacher's saying so you that are true believers why don't you pull on the word of God here join in the fight with me this morning call on the word of God say Amen to the word of God David said I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right and I hate every false way he says he says in verse 163 I hate and despise lies I hate I hate and a poor lying but thy law do I love you wonder why you hate the news media that's why I don't say that kidding that's why you hate it because there's something in you that doesn't like lying you don't like dishonesty you abhor it if you've got the real nature of Christ inside of you you hate it I love your law so the let me say this way the love of God demands that you hate certain things notice in Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 there are six things which the Lord hates there are six things this is Proverbs uh chapter 6 verse 16. there are six things which the Lord hates uh and and he says it's what is it it's a proud look it's a boastful a lion tongue hands that shed innocent blood and a heart that devises evil feet that runs swiftly uh for one who tells a false witness and and one who sows Discord or raises Strife amongst brethrens or tries to break up unity and you know that the Bible says that God hates a spirit that would try to break up Unity he hates a spirit that tries to break up Harmony within a body and let me tell you that's what the devil's good at he will try everything he can to break up brother random says you're one lovely group of people right now you all love one another I could say that about a church we can say that about a newlywed when you're first married your lovely group you you love each other you just you you just want to be in each other's company all the time my brother Brandon says but don't you know the devil ain't gonna to let it stay that way he's gonna do everything he can to break up to cause dysfunction to cause disharmony oh but but I got news for him today I'm not going to allow the demon spirit I want to say I pray I I I I I I curse any spirit that would try to bring disruption or Harmony to my home to my family to my church to my children I want the love of God to reign supreme in my heart so he says he hates he hates one who would spread Strife amongst even there do you say that that then there's seven things there's actually much more than seven Solomon only named seven here in Proverbs but there's more in the Book of Malachi God says I hate divorce did you hear me I hate divorce this is one thing God says he hates he he says in the Book of Malachi chapter one that he he he hates wickedness Hosea chapter 9 and in Jeremiah 44 verses 3 and 4. the Bible says God hates idolatry he hates the worship of anything that comes between you and him [Applause] that's a strong word god actually hates it anything that you put before God Thou shalt have no other gods before me because he's a jealous God he hates anything that would break up fellowship or communion with him he's number one he's the number one prior he's the number one priority he ought to be first place in every part of your life and when we take him and put him to a second place let me just tell you what the Bible says he hates that God says in Amos chapter 5 that he hates hypocrisy this is the word goes all the way in the Book of Revelations it talks about hating that false uh spirit of the false Antichrist system so God is a god of love but because he's a god of love it it necessitates that he hates anything that is in contradiction to himself he hates it in his word he hated it in Israel he hated in the New Testament Church and he hates it in our lives as believers anything that is contrary to the word of God anything that is dish disharmony or or or or or or or disagreement with the word of God and I just want to stop here and say Lord I want to sanctify myself of anything that is in contradiction to you Lord anything that's in my tongue I want you to purge it from my tongue come on somebody help me preach anything that's in my mind if my thoughts are are not pleasing to the Holy Spirit I don't want to grieve you Lord I want to be in harmony with your word I don't want to be in contradiction can you say that about your dress code sisters brothers can we say oh you thought oh my why would we go to that well we just read why we would go to that anything that that is in contradiction to the word of God God hates I don't just want to Elizabeth think like a Christian I want to live like a Christian I just want to say that I'm a Christian I want to dress like I'm a Christian I want to live like I'm a believer of the word of God whosoever dude don't love the things of the world the more you love God the more you hate those things that dishonor him the more you get in love with Jesus the more you hate evil the more you fall in love with this word the more you want to surrender your entire being to every part of the word of God do not love the world neither the things of the world none of those things even the things which blaspheme his name or bring dishonor to his word don't love the world this is first John 2 nor the things of the world so God's a god of love but he's also a god of hate can you say Amen the one who loves his brother notice this or tonight we're not to we're not to love the world you are from God this is first John 4 verse 4. you are from God little children and have overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he that is in the world notice they speak us from the things it says keep going here and he says they speak is from the world and the world listens to them we are from God he who knows God listens to us he who is not from God does not listen to us why won't they listened I try to tell them I invite them to church I tell them the word of God why won't they listen I try to witness to them I try to give them I try to give them the word of God why won't they listen hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so because there's a spirit of error that must mean there's a spirit of Truth if I can be an error if I was once an error that means I can be in the truth and so notice this here he says don't don't love the world which is what we spoke about is it's the cosmos it's not not just talking about the physical world although I there is a part of the Bible says that brother Branham said that even the world was in the book of redemption right so the world's a part of God so if I love God I'll love the world now not the cosmos not the order not the structure if you're a riff you really got the love of God you'll love God's creation well amen anyway you won't destroy man God you do you do everything you can uh to to preserve God's creation you'll love animals amen all of our animal lovers my wife just said amen you love them that don't mean you'll have to have to I'm not preaching you got to have dogs in your house or cats in your house or cows or chickens in your backyard but you'll love animals you won't hate them all right Lord I don't know where I'm at but so notice here you'll love the the world the cause not but you won't love the cosmos you want love of the order you want love the structure you want love the system of this world now so when we think of a world we could use that in terminology the World of Sports or the world of science it's not what we're talking about we're talking about an atmosphere we're talking about a construct we're talking about a system that was from the beginning the spirit of antichrist Paul said that even doth now work and the sons of Disobedience you say oh boy we're waiting for that Antichrist to come listen the Antichrist that comes in the flesh is only a physical manifestation of the spirit of the Antichrist that's here right now right it's an anti-anointing as we as we spoke to you just uh but when we came out here it's an anti-anointing can you say Amen so it's a it's a it's an anti-anointing it's incredible to me and even as I was even as I was just uh let me just find a note that I I wrote down here just the other day uh but it's amazing to me as I as I thought about this this is Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25. you see you see that you refuse not him Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they who's speaking him and who is him the spirit of Truth now remember if you're of Truth you'll love truth I said if you're of Truth you won't question truth you'll believe truth because that's what a Believer does he believes the word of God he doesn't question the word of God he doesn't qualify the word of God he doesn't treat it like taxes and find a loophole in the word of God he surrenders his life to the word of God he that speaketh what is that voice it's the Voice of Truth notice this here Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spoke on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven isn't it amazing that the people who could sit and study the written law of Moses brother Brandon would say in one place that the scroll that can take a bound up Scroll of the law of Moses and they could take a pen and stick it through one side and out the other and tell you every letter that it hit is the PIN passed through that scroll they studied it they taught it they believed it they read it they heard about it intellectually they had it all bottled up in here yet those same people who could sit and study the written word of Moses and believe listen and believe the law of Moses yet they rejected the spoken words of Jesus coming from his mouth and his words were the Fulfillment of the scroll they believed so the same people refuse not him that speaketh so in other words people will never have trouble accepting the word that's written but where the Trouble Comes is when the word is spoken hello somebody they'll accept the word that's written they can accept the past the history as brother random says they're always thanking God for what he did always praising him for what he's going to do but missing or let me go further and say rejecting what he's doing right now see that she refused not him that speaketh they can believe the words of Moses they can accept the law of Moses but now when the Fulfillment of all of that law is now speaking They Crucified that one it's amazing to me they rejected the spoken word so what was it the law let me say this the law the word that was written became their comfort zone you think the devil you say well who gave them that the devil gave them that the devil will use religion and the word of God the devil will use the words written in your Bible that you read every day if you refuse him that speaketh he'll use that same written word to destroy you and blind you you say give me a scripture for that all right the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and so just the written words of the Bible listen you can have all of the words of the message of the hour I'll go further than that and know all of the things the prophet taught now all of the doctrines but miss the spirit of him that speaketh so they can believe the words of Moses they can accept it the word of Moses the law of Moses became their comfort zone it's their religious duties it's their procedures and their rituals you know church and and religion can become like a comfort blanket to some people well I'm just going to keep preaching it can become a religious religion can become a covering as it did for Cain I think you did for Adam and Eve it can become just a covering something that covers you up and it and it drowns out him that speaketh you say then because why who's him that speaketh the anointed word the anointed word that's speaking by the spoken word and so the law became their comfort zone in so much that they use the law to justify rejecting the spoken word [Music] oh I hope you're listening to me today the Fulfillment of that law let me just go further today then they could accept a prophet named Moses but ex but reject and refuse and crucify the word made flesh well let's just take it on a little bit further today they by the masses can accept the written words of Jesus but they reject the Jesus who spoke in this generation through a Vindicated prophet and even further than that they reject the voice of God that's speaking now through the bride of Christ that is the echo of that message that was sent let me say it again today they accept the words of Jesus don't you see friends it's the same exact thing it's the same exact pattern they accept what is people who say when they leave this message I just want Jesus I'm just going to find Jesus what are they saying they're comfortable with a Jesus written down on paper they're comfortable with the knowledge they can have in their mind but they refuse the Jesus who is still speaking who is still prophesying who is still showing himself alive oh I say today let this church say we accept the voice that's speaking we accept the Vindicated word of the hour we accept the Manifest of Jesus not just the Jesus of History they can accept it but they reject Jesus who spoke through this is why the very first verse that we wanted the first verses we read he that confesses that Jesus has come in the flesh that's where the brother random say that's where the trouble starts that's where the trouble begins when you say I and my father are one then they'll take up stones to crucify you amen brother Brandon says if you want to know whose side you would have been and what have you been on if you lived in the days of Jesus look at what you did listen to me brother random says oh if I would have lived in those days of Jesus I wouldn't have been part of that mob yelling crucify him I would I would I wouldn't have been those Roman soldiers taking a hammer to nail his hands to that cross oh surely I would have never been if I if I was living in those days of Jesus I would have taken his side brother random says look at what you do with the word that's been made manifest today and it will tell you whose side you would have been on if you look at what you do with the word today it will tell you whose side you're really on brother Brandon says look at what you did look at what you do with the word made flesh today and your day and it will tell you whose side you would have been on and the days of Jesus people who loved listen to me people love the written word because it's contained like a painted fire you know there's a big difference between a painted fire you went to a restaurant there and we were there enough in Charlotte I think it was our Jacksonville and and they had the all in the restaurant they had eight or nine big TVs like this I don't play in a fire and it was it was a 24-hour uh unending fire and that thing just crackled it it popped and you could hear all the sound from it you could watch it and even there for a minute became sort of help the atmosphere it become mesmerized by just watching it but let me just tell you I didn't draw any warmth from that fire that fire was never a danger to me it was always contained on a screen so I was perfectly comfortable with all this the same exact way today people are fine as long as you preach a Jesus of yesterday oh somebody help me preach this morning people are always okay with the god you preach of yesterday because it's a painted fire a painted scripture or a contained quote but when you make that quote today when you take that Bible and you bring Jesus out of history and say he's present tense he is speaking right now that's where the Trouble Comes they're okay with that painted fire of Jesus they're okay with that historical figure of Jesus but they refuse him who's speaking are you with me here this morning so he says love not the things of the world the cosmos no we're not talking about Mother Nature listen there is no such thing as Mother Nature Jaws just dropped in it it's like I told you there's no such thing as the Tooth Fairy there's not there's no such thing as Santa Claus there's no such thing as Mother Nature listen Mother Nature doesn't deserve any glory god deserves all the glory and all the honor and all the praise you say well then how was the World created go read the book of Genesis the first two chapters I'll tell you who created the world it wasn't Mother Nature it was Papa God it was father God he deserves all the credit and all of the praise and all of the glory and so listen you say well what about science and so listen science has nothing to say about creation besides that did you read the Genesis account science has nothing to do with creation uh because it has absolutely nothing to do with it because it wasn't a scientific event the world being created was not a scientific event that happened it wasn't just nothing came from nothing and then more nothing created everything say them what was it it was a miracle it was the miracle of all miracles the world that you live in today is a miracle that's the problem is people can't accept the miraculous but it was a miracle you say what kind of Miracle one that can't be explained by science one that can't be studied or observed by nature or by a microscope it took the miraculous god brother random said he spoke and it was by his words of his mouth he said let there be and there was praise God so it was a miracle you can't explain it and notice when you acknowledge God as the Creator you have to acknowledge God that's why science cannot acknowledge and they will do every possible thing they can to watch why to to disprove the creation they'll do everything they can to to cause doubt or to or to try to bring up some kind of debate with creation because they can't understand a miracle and let me just go further and say some Christians will make the mistake of trying to go scientifically with them and scientifically prove creation you're going to get yourself in a in a pretzel that you can't untie because it can't be understood by science it can be understood by by knowledge or by reasoning that the the uh the Eternal God is not known by understanding he was a miracle he's a god of Miracles he can't be understood by knowledge he's got to be believed by a heart of Faith who says whether I understand it or not Lord whether I can explain it I believe every bit of whether I can put it on a chalkboard I accept everything that the word of God said and I don't need to understand it I don't need to understand everything say brother Matt hold on a minute you you are you are you saying there's anything wrong with trying to understand creation no I'm not trying to say that at all all creation gives glory and credit to God but you see the reason why people with the reason why the carnal mind cannot accept or call God the Creator is because when you call God the Creator then it must mean he was also the law Giver and that morals were given were established not by men not by not by reasoning but God gave us what it means to what right was and what wrong was when you call God the Creator that means he's the one who creates the the the law that means he's the one who creates the rules can you say Amen this morning because listen to me when you acknowledge Him as Creator you acknowledge Him as lawgiver because part of that creation part of what God created when he spoke was he put a law down inside of every human being to tell you what's right and what's wrong I to tell a boy how to not tell Allah listen that's why you hear Brother random saying you don't have to teach them kids how to lie they do it naturally when they're born you don't have to tell them they don't have to read a manual it's part of their nature to tell a lie well if you believe that then I must also believe that God also put something inside of a sea Gene of God and I don't have to indoctrinate them all that God has to do is flash his light across it and there's a nature down inside of them to accept God and to glorify God and to say I'm a Believer because that's a law he put down on the inside of me Hallelujah but they don't want to acknowledge God as Creator that's why men run from God as the Creator not because they don't like the idea that God created them but they don't like the idea that God is also their judge because when you acknowledge Him as Creator you acknowledge Him as judge so Jesus said don't love the things of the world the cosmos this is the order this is the physical structure we could say this is the this is the uh uh first John 15 18 if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you're not of the world but I chose you out of the world aren't you glad he chose me out of all of the construct and all of the structure and and all of the world order God chose me and pulled me out of this structure it shows you I have chose you because of this the world hates you because of this the world hates you listen to Jesus when he prays in John 17. I know we all love this chapter and he says I have given them your word speaking of the Apostles that were with him I have given film your word and the world has hated them the world has hated them because they're not of this world when you are not of this world the world will hate you let me go a little bit further than this and say that if in our social structures I don't care if it's in our business I'm not talking about you know that that you got to live like you know a a person who no one can't stand to be everyone can't stand to be around and and you're just always preaching repent or perish that's not what I'm talking about that's not what Jesus did Jesus lived the word of God and his works or his life reproved the darkness you don't have to say very much to make a sinner uncomfortable in your presence just live the life of Jesus and your life will reprove the darkness trust me I have we deal with it all the time you tell man we women men well I have to work around and tell a dirty joke and then there's that awkward silence when I don't laugh well it's true and if you go really god listen to me brother if you would laugh at a dirty joke I'd say there's something wrong with your experience you better go back and check it by the word of God if you're not if you're so awkwardly uncomfortable that you can't make yourself a spectacle and you gotta laugh with the jokes tell the dirty jokes and I listen to me brothers and sisters it's time the world knew that there's a body of believers who aren't of this world they don't live like the world they don't joke like the world they don't dress like The World God Made You different for a reason they hate because I've given them your word because they're not of the world the world hates you listen if you're comfortable in this world I would doubt your experience I'm just going to go ahead and preach it today if you're living in laodicea and you're comfortable and you fit in I would doubt your experience in the Holy Ghost because the Bible says whoever's in Christ is a new creation all his old life and his old worldly ways are God and he's new with newness of life he walks different he talks different he sings different he dresses different he lives different and everybody knows it how many Believers we got that believes that [Applause] so John is saying you can't love the world because why because this world is Satan's Eden it's a system of evil and boy if it's ever made more manifest than it is today than it's ever been before it's in opposition to everything that the Bible stands for now I'm not talking about the watered-down world that wants to make Jesus relatable to the world come on somebody help me don't let me lose you on this we're believers I'm not talking about the Jesus who socially accepted and socially taught and we just preach that God is the god of love and we preach all of the gospels but we don't preach that God's also a god of hate he's also a God of Justice he's also a god of his word he's not a god of compromise [Music] as we said Wednesday night when Jesus preached his gospel it got him crucified when Paul did it got his head cut off when all of the Apostles preach you go and read the way each one of those Apostles died what was it it was the truth and the truth brings separation can you say Amen the truth brings a separation and so notice this here in first John 4 beloved do not believe every spirit but try the spirits to see whether they're from God because many false prophets have gone out into this world many so you can't believe everything don't he said don't don't just accept anything but try it you say try it by what the word as brother Brandon said give it the word test and he says don't he says don't believe every spirit and he and he says because there's many false prophets that have gone out of this world so by this you know the spirit of God and every spirit that confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God every spirit that doesn't confess Jesus is not from God this is the spirit of the Antichrist of which you've heard that it is coming and now it's already in the world you're from God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than who he that is in the world so in John 12 Jesus calls him the prince of the world not God not Jehovah the devil you want to know who the prince of the world is Satan that'll give you more sense why God says don't love this world because it's Prince is the devil and he's in control of politics he's in control of religion it was bad enough when he was out in the white house it's even worse now that he's in the church foreign he controls politics he's the prince of the world Ephesians 2 2. notice this here this is Ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 in which you formally walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience he walked according to the lust of your flesh the lust of your eyes the pride of life all of us of such were some of you there's not one of us that was exempt from that that's why we can have Grace for anybody I don't care how dark I don't care how demented I don't care how tattooed and earring they are up I don't care how far and how distant they are of such were some of you if God gives us Grace how much more should we give Grace to others to say God can transform your life he could take that old heart of evil desire out of you he could deliver you from those cigarettes in that nicotine he can deliver how do I know that because God I've watched God do it over and over and over again to believe he's still the god of transformation and so notice he says you walked according to the desires of the Flesh and in the mind remember why when were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so notice this here even in Isaiah if you have your Bible we're going to close here just in a few minutes so don't get nervous as brother Diggs says we're going to close notice this here in Isaiah if you have if you have your Bible to turn to Isaiah chapter 20. I want to just read this together you love the Lord amen notice this here this is Isaiah this is uh this is the words as we as we quoted this there's pick it up from where we took off Isaiah 21 sorry forgive me Isaiah chapter 21 verse 3. brother Mark Isaiah 21 and verse 3. so the prophet gives us here's here's Isaiah and he's prophesying and he's and he's he's lamenting he's we're not going to read the entire chapter but he says my loins are are filled up and I I'm in Graham and Isaiah seeing this vision of this coming Army that's going to come and destroy the entire world and he says here in verse 3 he says therefore are my loins filled with pain pains have not taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that trevella our pains have taken a hold of me as the pangs of a woman that child this is what a prophet does because he's a Seer because he could see what you can't see I'm so glad we've had a prophet in this age and he could see what I couldn't see you say why are you happy because he could warn me of those things I would have been clueless about listen had it not been for a Vindicated prophet in this age I would be just like the rest of the world going to the church down the street but God opened my eyes and warned me of things to come I'm so thankful today that to be identified by Jesus who revealed himself in this day you said brother man do you believe that's what the message is that is what the message is it's him he the spirit of Truth speaking through a Vindicated mouthpiece so notice this here he says as the Pains of omen the throne are bowed down at the hearing of it I was dismayed at the scene of it something that was terrifying Isaiah it's a horrifying vision his brother random says he even tries to relate that to visions and he's talking to to Gordon Lindsay and brother Gordon asked him said brother Adam how does it work he says up just like I'm seeing you now brother Gordon just as I'm standing here watching you and and looking at you and hearing your words the same exact way I'll break into a vision and he says it's just as real as you're standing right here and as a Seer he sees everything from the past to the present to the future he could look at someone's life and he could look all the way they're that person is standing in front of them at 30 40 years old and he looks all the way to the day when they were an eight-year-old girl he could look all the way in the past of their life and so Isaiah's not looking in the past he's looking in the future and he says that Vision this Vision that I had was terrifying oh it seized me like the Pains of a woman in in labor he says I'm so terrified my my mind reels horror listen to Listen to verse four just keep going and he says my heart panted fearfulness afraided me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me Isaiah couldn't control this this was the vision of the Lord and so you say brother brother Matt what caused the convulsion of this Prophet what caused all of the sorrow why did his beat he says my you know what that means when it says my heart panted it means it's deadly this is something so overwhelming to him he's an anguish and he says because I've seen a storm coming in the desert and that storm it was a massive enemy all of the Dust he sees the look like a twister in the desert look like an ocean and he says the the the the the sand and the the the the the the the the Cyclones and Isaiah says and I realized it was an Army it was an army of soldiers Riders horsemens trains of donkeys and camels and pears it was a massive enemy Army coming to destroy and he says he that hears in this spiritual with the spiritual eyes the downfall look at verse 20. look at verse 9 brother Mark let's just read it together and I'm just going to take a minute to read some of these verses look at verse 9. verse nine okay that's fine I've got it here before me and he says it was the downfall I've got the the notation wrong and he sees the listen to me you say what's he seeing brother Matt he's seeing the end of all he's in the end of all things do you know there's coming an end to all things there's coming an end to time there's coming in and there's coming an end to to the world there's coming into these things there's a day of expiration you know what that ought to do that ought to make us make our call in an election sure it also ought to make us rejoice that there's coming into pain there's coming an end to sorrow oh come on somebody there's coming an end distress there's coming an end anxiety you don't have to work all your life there's coming an end to all of that trouble and Isaiah sees the incoming he says in verse 7 this is Isaiah 21 and he says he sees the coming judgment and he says in Isaiah 21 verse 7 do you have that brother Mark 20 21 7. I must have it wrong that's okay no no problem Isaiah 21 you've got 21 7. I'm reading it here in in my Bible I'm sorry Isaiah chapter 21. so notice this here that's all right you can you can you can lit you can just have have me read it that's just that's just fine so he sees the end of all things he says here and he says he says uh uh he said he says pay close attention pay very close attention rise up rise up this is the words of Isaiah to the family of God this is the words of a prophet rise up oil the shields sharpen the swords what's he saying prepare yourself get ready wake up this is what Jesus said when he said watch that that you be found worthy to escape all these things watch and be sober minded this is the admonition to the Church of the of the Living God watch and be prayerful watch and be ready don't be called off guard don't be caught lackadaisical don't be called distracted watch we have the words and the warnings of the Prophet preach the word be incident season out of season preach it you got to tell it reprove rebuke with all long suffering not to declare the whole counsel of God this is what the Bible says we read it Wednesday for there's coming a generation of people that have no spiritual appetite for the true word of God they want the word but they don't want the true word they want the Bible but they don't want the spoken word preach the word be instant in season out of season I just feel the anointing of inspiration of the Holy Spirit just to stop right there as we read it on Wednesday I charge you this is Paul's last last words to Timothy he's in a prison cell he's literally in a prison cell writing these last words to Timothy the man who's going to take up the man who's going to preach what Paul preached the man is going to carry on the gospel the church the church that's gonna carry on the true word of God that was delivered through the prophet I charge thee Timothy I command thee preach the word tell it Proclaim it declare it oh it's not a time to be quiet about it church it's not a time to be mute about it it's not a time to keep it to ourselves it's a time to Proclaim it oh it's a time to declare it to say preached I'm not just talking to preachers I'm talking to you this morning I charged you before the Living God preach the word be instant in season you say what does that mean to be instant in season and out of season sometimes it's going to feel like The Season's right to preach it other times it's not going to feel right you're going to feel tired you're going to feel like I really feel uncomfortable with that it's not going to always feel like it's in the season but you got to preach it whether you feel like it or not you got to declare it whether you feel like it or not oh help him preach somebody no matter what you feel like today no matter how tired you are you got to preach it you got to tell it you got to Proclaim it no matter how unpopular it becomes no matter how many people walk away from you and denounce you I don't care if it's your family if it's your brothers if it's your sisters if it's your pastor if it's the preacher here today declare it preach it I charge thee before God preach the word be instant in season out of season for the time is coming when they want endure sound Doctrine don't don't you know it was all it was just tell me things I want to hear just don't tell me tell me how good I am you say brother Matt that sounds comical listen friends this is whether you realize it or not it's inside of my nature and it's inside of your nature to hate correction we hate it this flesh but down on the inside man there's something that rises up and says I want to be right how many believe that today and say I want to be right Lord I want to be right for this coming a time when they shall not endure sound Doctrine but shall Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears Isaiah says pick up the swords oil oil the shields I'm closing okay rise up oil the shields verse 5. but you know what the Bible says no one's listening imagine what this would do for for Isaiah hear the prophets sees the destruction and he's yelling it he's preaching it he's declaring it he's taking him by the hand he's saying listen this is what's coming and Isaiah says no one's listened prepare the table watch in the Watchtower eat drink arise you princess and anoint the shield this is the words he's declaring but no one's listening here it is judgment's coming it's been pronounced brother random says what what's left after you neglect to heed the warning there's only one thing left judgment and here's judgment coming marching armies outside the gate the Day of Reckoning has come and the prophet's voice is shouting get back in line get back in Step the prophet's word is is declaring pay attention be sober be vigilant oil The Shield sharpen the swords but what are they doing they ignore the warning they go about their ways eating drinking making Mary spreading out of table of prosperity and success they say brother Matt How could a person how could a person hear the warning of judgment and just keep going about their merry way I'm going to tell you why because Jesus says with ears they hear not and with eyes they see not they're deaf they're blind you say what's death and film what's blinded them their own deceits that's what the scripture says their own vanity their own deceit has blinded their minds they don't want to hear about it they want to hear good things they don't want to hear about Gloom they don't want to hear about destruction they want to have Happy Days prosperous days uh tell me tell me tell me about the good days coming don't tell me about the bad days awaiting this is so far that in Isaiah chapter 30. notice what it says in verse 9 Isaiah chapter 30 brother Mark this is the rebellious children lying children Isaiah 30. verse 9 and verse 10. you can have it if you have it in your Bible you can turn there yourself that this is the rebellious people that will not hear the law of the Lord verse 10 verse 10. which say to the seers see not see not right was say to the prophets don't look do you know this is the condition of of the world that you live in this is the world that you carouse with and you move in every day of your life see not prophet prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits Watchmen come off that wall we don't need you on that

you're not here and I'm gonna preach in any way that's what God told me to say this morning how are we going to take a Rapture and a body change if we're not preaching and living and hearing you think you're going to take a Rapture and you don't ever hear God's Prophet you never listen to God you never turn on a tape you never study the message for yourself listen let me just go ahead and warn you and let my voice go into the annals of history and the record you won't take a Rapture if you're not here in a rapturing voice you will not take a body change if you're not playing the tapes of the Prophet if you're not hearing what the prophet said how what was that message it was to make you ready so how are you going to be ready if you're not hearing the message to get ready well I'll just go to church I'll just pay my tithes I'll sit there like a car in a garage and I'll become a car no you won't you won't become a Christian you won't change you sit here in church for 20 years 30 years 40 years and you'll sit here when they're taking of coming of the Lord takes place I say God don't let me be here when the judgment begins to fall let me hear the voice of the Prophet let me make myself ready let me hear it every day Lord let me play the tapes let me preach the word let me live the word god do I have a church that believes that this morning that could say keep playing it keep preaching it oh can you say that today keep playing it keep preaching it I believe it I'm a believer of it today I accept the word of the Lord for the hour musicians could you come take heed unto yourself this is what Paul warns the Corinthian Church take heed therefore unto yourselves and to the flocks unto the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock this is acts verse two this is acts 20. notice this therefore watch and remember that bites the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day this is the words of the Apostle Paul to the first church this is the words to Paul to Timothy preach the word this is a word from Isaiah to the Watchman you that call upon the name you that mention the name of the Lord don't be silent don't be quiet declare it preach it Talent reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering to the overseers to the Watchmen to the pastors to the mothers to the fathers to the Church of the Living God preach the word watch warn tell them how will they know how will they hear if they're not not a preacher how will that family ever know if you don't tell them I know that's so simple this just the the anointing of the Holy Ghost right now upon me as I'm telling you today listen to me they'll never know if you don't tell them God wants your voice to speak well I invited them to church that's good that's wonderful it's good you invited them to church but greater than invited them to church it's for you person to person to tell them the truth how will they know there's not a preacher and a preacher is more than just a man who stands up here behind the pulpit talking it's every single one of you listen to me young person how will those friends at school know if you don't tell them amen Paul says I've I've told you I've warned you day and night day and night day and night have spoken Watchmen must be speaking people must be talking oh let the redeemed of the Lord the Bible says say so if the devil can do anything today he could try to get you to be quiet try to get you to be awkward to not speak it to not tell it just to live through your life listen God wants to inhabit your body and your voice and your words you say I don't know what I'll say take no thought for what you'll say take no thought don't even think about what the words are going to come out of your mouth if you are feeding on this word and you're listening to this word and you're reading this word I'm going to tell you right now what you need to say is already inside of you what they need to hear is already inside of your mouth you're just going to open your mouth how many want to say Lord let me yield my vessel I want to make myself available to the Holy Spirit I want to make my my voice Available to You Lord if you want to speak I just want to raise my hands and stand to my feet now and say Lord I want to make myself available to you let the spirit of Truth let it ring out let it Echo out let it cry out let me declare it don't let don't Lord if there's a spirit of fear upon me I just want to raise a hand and say Lord will you take that spirit of fear out of me oh Church of the Living God God needs your voice he needs our voice and I just raise my hand and say Lord then use my voice I'd invite you to do the same with me to say raise your hand and say Lord then use my little voice it may not seem like much to me may not seem like I'm anybody or anything and I'm not one to tell like let the preacher tell no God's waiting on you he's dependent on you how you say they're my friend are they really your friend they're really your friend if you if they're really a friend you'll care about them and if you care about them you care about their soul you'll care about their soul more than their feelings if that's a true friendship you'll care about their soul more than any kind of I don't care what kind of uh uh misunderstanding that make calls I don't care what kind of Separation it may cause you're only responsible for one thing that's to declare it that's to preaching that's the talent and I said Lord let me be found faithful let me be found faithful Lord Jesus Lord all the way to the end God this is what your spirit has been dealing with My Heart Lord and I'm just going to preach it I'm just going to pray it for myself as I raise my hands and say Lord I'll not keep silent I'm not come off the wall I'm going to stay on the wall I'm going to keep preaching and I'm going to keep telling him I don't care even him even if I don't understand it I'm still going to declare it because it's the word of the Lord and I
