[0:01] Mr Amy sorry I'm actually supposed to be
[0:04] up there right now so if we could just
[0:06] all Stand Together
[0:09] just
[0:10] open up our Bibles
[0:12] into we're going to do two portions of
[0:14] reading this morning
[0:16] it is uh John chapter 15 we'll start
[0:19] with John chapter 15 and verses
[0:22] five
[0:25] amen John chapter 15 and verse 5.
[0:30] just turn in our Bibles there
[0:34] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[0:36] Lord this morning amen
[0:40] says I am the vine and ye are the
[0:42] branches and he that abideth in me and I
[0:44] in him the same bringeth forth much
[0:47] fruit
[0:48] for without me you can do nothing
[0:51] amen if we'd like to also turn in our
[0:52] Bibles to Ruth the first chapter Ruth
[0:56] chapter one
[0:58] we're going to read a few scriptures
[1:00] over there
[1:01] a few verses of scripture
[1:09] amen root chapter 1 and verse we'll
[1:11] start at verse 13.
[1:13] and she uh we'll actually start at verse
[1:17] let's start at verse 10 and they said
[1:19] unto her surely we will return unto thee
[1:22] thy people and Naomi said
[1:24] turn again my daughters why will ye go
[1:27] with me are there yet any more sons in
[1:29] thy womb that they may be your husbands
[1:32] turn again my daughters go your way for
[1:35] I am too old to have a husband
[1:37] if I should say I have hope
[1:40] if I should have a husband also tonight
[1:42] and also and should also bear Sons would
[1:45] you tarry for them till they were grown
[1:47] would you stay for them from having
[1:49] husbands name my daughters for it
[1:51] grieveth me much for your sakes that the
[1:53] hand of the Lord has gone out against me
[1:55] and this is the portion of scripture I
[1:57] just kind of want to focus on this
[1:58] morning and they lifted up their voice
[1:59] and wept again and orfa kissed her
[2:02] mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her
[2:05] and she said behold thy sister-in-law is
[2:08] gone back unto her people and under her
[2:10] Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law
[2:14] and Ruth said and treat me not to leave
[2:16] thee or to return from following after
[2:19] thee for whether thou goest I will go
[2:22] and where thou largest I will Lodge thy
[2:25] people shall be my people and thy God my
[2:28] God where thou Diest will I die and
[2:31] there will I be buried the Lord do so to
[2:33] me and more also
[2:35] if ought but death part thee in me
[2:38] and when she saw this
[2:41] that she was steadfastly minded to go
[2:43] with her then she left speaking unto her
[2:46] amen by the help of the Lord I'd just
[2:48] like to take a topic of yielding if we
[2:49] just want to go before the Lord in
[2:51] prayer this morning
[2:52] Heavenly Father Lord we just
[2:55] Lord approach your throne this morning
[2:57] Father we're so thankful for just
[2:59] another opportunity to gather together
[3:01] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

[3:05] your word Lord we pray that Lord it can
[3:08] just come into our hearts this morning
[3:10] Father we pray that we can just be
[3:11] changed and Lord molded and grafted Lord
[3:14] God just a little bit further into your
[3:16] image this morning Lord God and I pray

[3:34] anointing Lord we just leave our cares

[3:38] all now outside of these doors Lord
[3:40] Jesus and we just come before you now
[3:42] father Lord just with an Open Heart Lord
[3:45] God as I'm just taking this Lord as you
[3:48] laid it upon my heart to just Minister
[3:50] on yielding Lord God take a little
[3:51] Sunday School portion on yielding help
[3:53] us yield this morning Father God for
[3:55] further and further into your word and
[3:57] Lord just let it be in Into the Depths
[4:00] of our hearts we pray and ask these
[4:01] things now in the precious name of Jesus
[4:03] Christ
[4:04] amen as you take your seats this morning
[4:07] brother Branham speaks in 1963 and the
[4:10] message how can I overcome he says just
[4:12] like putting a little baby's arm in a
[4:14] sleeve hole you see he's just up down
[4:16] over and everything else see he can't do
[4:18] it
[4:19] put on your coat honey he can't do it
[4:21] little arm is down around it just takes
[4:24] your Steady Hand
[4:26] oh glad how glad I am I can just yield
[4:30] my hand to my father and say Lord Jesus
[4:33] I can't get in there you help me put on
[4:35] the coat for me I quit trying and I just
[4:38] let him do it see if the little baby
[4:40] keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it
[4:43] he's just everywhere he can't do it and
[4:46] neither can you neither can I but if we
[4:48] just hold still and let him do it and
[4:50] just yield to him
[4:52] here Lord here am I just let me be
[4:55] nothing amen
[4:56] you put my hand in the right place and
[4:59] that's the victory that's overcoming
[5:02] yielding is overcoming amen the thing
[5:05] that you have to overcome still in this
[5:07] quote is is yourself your idea your
[5:09] thing and surrender yourself to him he
[5:12] overcame for you he knows the way we
[5:14] don't and Noah's time there was eight
[5:16] Overcomers and they went in they were
[5:18] caught inside now look friends I believe
[5:21] that they're taping this if it's on the
[5:23] television or pardon me a tape whatever
[5:25] you do who's listening now who listen
[5:26] here after the hour is late and you do
[5:29] have good intentions but be caught
[5:32] inside amen don't don't struggle not him
[5:36] that willeth or him that runeth but God
[5:39] just let God just yield yourself to him
[5:42] and walk on with a perfect steadfast
[5:44] Faith what God promised he is able to
[5:47] perform amen
[5:49] so a person has the ability to has the
[5:53] ability to overcome if we uh if we
[5:56] practice true biblical humility and just
[5:59] say that Lord I I know that I can't
[6:01] overcome without your hand in my life
[6:03] amen we can't we can't do anything of
[6:06] ourselves we have to surrender to the
[6:09] hand of God to allow him to be the one
[6:12] who is able to to to to uh overcome for
[6:15] us amen he doesn't need our own
[6:18] abilities Moses tried doing that but it
[6:21] was never what God had intended you know
[6:23] the only thing that that he needs from
[6:25] us is is a complete and total surrender
[6:27] and as I was reading that quote last
[6:29] night I was just thinking how can I how
[6:31] can I Surrender totally you know we hear
[6:34] that ministered a lot we hear that on
[6:36] tapes a lot you know to surrender our
[6:38] whole hearts and to totally surrender
[6:40] but how can I possibly get to that point
[6:42] of of full maturity in Christ Jesus and
[6:45] I just want to take us take it back to
[6:47] just it's all done in Simplicity it's
[6:50] simply trusting in his word in every
[6:53] aspect of your lives
[6:55] amen what is what does that look like
[6:57] you say maybe brother Caleb you say just
[6:59] just keep it simple Saints it's just it
[7:01] just invite him in you know uh you know
[7:04] I'm new to to Ministry I'm new to to
[7:06] being a dad I'm new to there's a lot of
[7:08] things that I'm new to in my life and
[7:11] the moment that I think that I've got it
[7:13] all figured out is the moment that God
[7:14] can't use me and the same goes for our
[7:17] us and our lives the moment that we
[7:19] think that we've got it all figured out
[7:21] is the moment God can't use us because
[7:23] he's wanting us to surrender every
[7:26] aspect of Our Lives to him
[7:28] amen and I find myself as often as I
[7:31] possibly can
[7:33] you know just praying that prayer Lord
[7:35] just teach me teach me to yield further
[7:38] and so many times it can be a
[7:41] um it can be a bumpy road because you
[7:43] know we have to go through trials and we
[7:45] have to go through these things and it's
[7:47] our growth and sometimes we don't
[7:48] completely understand the way that you
[7:51] know that we're that we're supposed to
[7:52] go but the lord always has a plan in
[7:54] mind he always has a a road that we must
[7:57] travel
[7:59] scripture says you know he doesn't want
[8:00] your strength it's because it's in my
[8:02] weaknesses that he has made strong
[8:05] and if if we really want to grow we have
[8:08] to really start asking ourselves the
[8:09] tough questions
[8:11] and you know as as I'm speaking on this
[8:14] I I'm just pointing to myself and I
[8:16] don't have anybody in mind except for
[8:18] myself you know Lord expose the flaws in
[8:21] my life there's so many things there's
[8:23] so many hindrances that we have and you
[8:26] know the big things the devil can't get
[8:28] us on the big things if we're True
[8:29] Believers and if we're born of the
[8:31] spirit of God but he gets us in those
[8:33] small hindrances in our lives and we
[8:36] have those complexes and we have those
[8:38] flaws and we have those habits and we
[8:40] have those you know maybe those vices in
[8:42] our lives that are that are that are the
[8:44] small things you know and so many times
[8:47] it's the Lord just needs that that full
[8:50] surrender of your heart the whole heart
[8:51] he doesn't want just you know 90 or 95
[8:54] percent he wants to bring all of those
[8:56] things to light
[8:58] how do we how do we let ourselves
[9:01] um
[9:03] be such a hindrance in our own walk with
[9:06] Christ many times you know I hate even
[9:08] giving the devil all the credit in
[9:10] things when it comes to our trials and a
[9:12] lot of times it's just ourselves we just
[9:13] get in the way of ourselves we have
[9:16] those flaws we have those things the
[9:18] complexes that come we have the the uh
[9:20] the hindrances the habits whatever it is
[9:22] those small things and we just put them
[9:25] in the corner and say that those things
[9:27] are going to be okay you know it's just
[9:28] it's just I'm a human but the Lord wants
[9:30] to bring us into a state of full
[9:32] maturity amen and that's the place that
[9:34] I want to be this morning I want to be
[9:36] in a place of full maturity in the word
[9:38] of God
[9:39] sometimes we can just be so afraid to
[9:42] bring those things to light though
[9:43] because it's a difficult thing to bring
[9:46] to bring those small things to the Lord
[9:49] because it's it's a difficult thing to
[9:51] face
[9:52] Amen to that song just the more that I
[9:54] Surrender the lighter my load you know
[9:56] the the more that I release my cares the
[9:59] more he takes control and the more that
[10:01] I humble myself the more that he lifts
[10:04] me up amen and a true humility true
[10:06] biblical humility teaches us that you
[10:09] know there those small things in our
[10:10] life he wants all of it so that he can
[10:12] get rid of that and bring us to where we
[10:14] need to be
[10:16] God provided a perfect sacrifice to
[10:20] perfect the imperfectible amen we don't
[10:23] we don't we need to have the the
[10:25] attitude of of Mary you know where she
[10:27] said to be it unto me according to Thy
[10:30] word you know if you look at the the
[10:31] scripture there in in the Book of Luke
[10:34] you had an angel that visited two
[10:37] individuals you had an angel that
[10:39] visited Zechariah which was a priest at
[10:41] the time and told her to told him hey
[10:43] you know you your prayer has been
[10:45] answered and and you've been praying
[10:47] this prayer for a long time and your
[10:49] wife is gonna she's gonna be uh she's
[10:51] gonna have a baby and that baby is going
[10:53] to be the one that foreruns the Savior
[10:55] and he couldn't completely wrap his mind
[10:59] around it even though he had been
[11:01] praying that prayer most of his life
[11:03] because his wife was Barren he had been
[11:06] praying that prayer he was a priest of
[11:07] God he knew the scriptures he knew he
[11:10] had read about Abraham and how he did it
[11:12] with Sarah but yet he didn't have that
[11:15] within him to say to be it unto me he
[11:17] was trying to figure it out himself amen
[11:19] a lot of times we're like that we try to
[11:21] figure out things ourselves when when
[11:23] the Lord just needs us to say hey look
[11:24] you're gonna I'm gonna figure it out for
[11:26] you
[11:28] so to contrast you know Mary when that
[11:30] angel came to Mary and said these things
[11:32] which was a similar it was a similar
[11:34] thing you know but this was even a
[11:36] greater you know the the Lord is going
[11:38] to come through you and how she didn't
[11:40] ask how she just said be it unto me
[11:42] according to Thy word that's what that's
[11:44] how just simply taking him it has word
[11:46] you know we don't understand how that
[11:49] we're going to move forward through this
[11:50] thing or why we're going through this
[11:52] trial or why this circumstance is facing
[11:55] us but when we can just be like Mary and
[11:57] not like Zechariah to say Lord be it
[11:59] unto me whatever you have in store and
[12:02] just lay those things down amen in the
[12:05] message uh how can I overcome in 1963
[12:07] brother Brown says now don't struggle
[12:10] not him that willeth or him that runeth
[12:12] but God just let God just yield
[12:16] yourselves to him and walk on with a
[12:19] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[12:22] has promised he is able to perform amen
[12:25] not joining one denomination or another
[12:28] denomination and running this or that or
[12:30] the other just trying this just yield
[12:33] yourself to God and walk with him
[12:36] peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep
[12:39] on walking with him that's right
[12:42] I took some notes on a service um that I
[12:44] went I was able to go to a Minister's or
[12:47] a men's meeting I'm sorry a men's
[12:48] meeting back and the minister was
[12:50] talking on Second Corinthians 2 11
[12:52] speaking of excuse me not being ignorant
[12:55] of Satan's devices
[12:58] you know we realize you know as
[12:59] Believers as I was saying that the devil
[13:02] uses different devices with us than he
[13:04] would use with the world Amen he works
[13:06] in the things in our life that we don't
[13:08] think are big things he works on the
[13:10] small things in our life
[13:14] speaking on yielding this morning keep
[13:16] that in your mind James 5 16 States
[13:18] confess confess your faults one to
[13:21] another and pray for one another that ye
[13:23] may be healed the effectual fervent
[13:26] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[13:28] yielding to God
[13:30] means taking every word a sincere
[13:33] confession
[13:34] amen an honest confession one to another
[13:36] and it can be if it can be very
[13:38] difficult to confess confess a mistake
[13:41] to someone but when you start to
[13:43] shutting those things out Pride can
[13:46] actually set in and it can cause us to
[13:49] get into a worse day and get farther
[13:50] away from God so that small thing has
[13:53] now turned into a great hindrance
[13:55] and now the enemy because that pride is
[13:58] set in the enemy has an inlet and that's
[14:01] how the enemy Works to get into the life
[14:04] of a believer
[14:05] you know the only like I said The only
[14:07] person I have in mind on teaching this
[14:08] is me I just the Lord was dealing with
[14:10] me on this and he wants us to yield all
[14:14] everything even the Small Things our
[14:16] vices our habits this commentary that I
[14:18] was reading
[14:19] on that scripture despise not the day of
[14:22] small things it says many of God's
[14:25] choice workers he uses a powerful season
[14:27] of small things these days are not a
[14:30] mistake nor are they punishment they are
[14:33] days of Priceless shaping and
[14:35] preparation they are not days to despise
[14:38] when Satan tempts us to despise the day
[14:41] of small things he shines as an
[14:43] outstanding liar
[14:45] because Satan does not despise the day
[14:48] of small things Satan fears the day of
[14:51] small things
[14:52] in our life because he sees what great
[14:55] things God does in them and through them
[14:58] and brings out of them Hallelujah and on
[15:01] the other side of that some of the big
[15:03] biggest hindrances in our daily walk
[15:05] with the Lord is that we let those small
[15:08] things you know creep into our hearts
[15:10] and then we become almost ignorant as
[15:12] what the scripture says ignorant of
[15:14] Satan's devices because we allow he we
[15:17] allow just a small portion of ourselves
[15:19] to the enemy
[15:23] amen we're reading back into Ruth I
[15:25] opened up with Ruth and it's a familiar
[15:27] reading but I just want to cover this
[15:29] you know it's a Sunday school topic amen
[15:31] I want to open up and um
[15:34] in verse 1 of chapter one of Ruth
[15:38] it says now it came to pass in the days
[15:41] when the judges ruled that there was a
[15:43] famine in the land and a certain man of
[15:44] Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the
[15:46] country of Moab he and his wife and his
[15:48] two sons and the name of the man was a
[15:51] lemon lack in the name of his wife Naomi
[15:52] and the name of his two sons melon and
[15:54] Chilean ephriites of Bethlehem Judah and
[15:57] they came into the country of mohab and
[15:59] continued there and a limit like Naomi's
[16:01] husband died and she was left in her two
[16:03] sons and they took them wives of the
[16:05] woman of Moab and the name of the one
[16:07] was orfa and the name of the other was
[16:09] Ruth Ruth and they dwelled there about
[16:11] 10 years and melon and Chilean died also
[16:14] both of them and the woman was left of
[16:15] her two sons and her two husbands we
[16:18] read of a time now where it says that
[16:20] the judges were ruling Israel and this
[16:22] was a this was a time a period
[16:24] characterized by the phase uh the phrase
[16:27] that everyone did what was right in
[16:29] their own sight right so it doesn't it
[16:31] doesn't tell us much about Naomi's
[16:34] husband or her two sons other than that
[16:36] they left the land of promise and that
[16:38] they died you know and like I said it's
[16:40] a it's a familiar story but I really
[16:42] want to focus in on Ruth's willingness
[16:45] to yield
[16:47] in Ruth 1 verses 6 through 9 and she
[16:50] arose with her daughters-in-law that she
[16:51] might return from the country of mohab
[16:53] for she had heard in the country of Moab
[16:55] how the Lord had visited his people and
[16:57] giving them bread and she went forth out
[17:00] of the place where she was her two
[17:01] daughters-in-law and they went on the
[17:02] way to return to Judah and Naomi said
[17:05] unto her two daughters-in-law go return
[17:07] to each of her mother's house the Lord
[17:09] deal kindly with you as ye have dealt
[17:11] with the dead and with me the Lord grant
[17:13] you that you may find rest each of you
[17:15] in the house of her husband and they
[17:18] lifted up their voice and wept and they
[17:21] said unto her surely we will return unto
[17:23] thee and Naomi said turn again my
[17:25] daughters why will you go with me are
[17:26] there any yet more sons in my womb we
[17:28] read this earlier
[17:30] and as they in verse 14 as they lifted
[17:32] up their voice they wept again and orfa
[17:34] kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth claved
[17:36] unto her
[17:37] notice that all of all of them were
[17:39] dealing with grief and tragedy of of a
[17:43] circumstance at this time all of them
[17:44] lost their husbands Naomi lost their
[17:46] husband and then you know ten years
[17:48] later she lost her two sons and felt as
[17:51] if the land the the hand of the Lord had
[17:53] actually gone gone out against her it
[17:56] says but the Lord has a way of using our
[17:59] circumstances to bring us back to him
[18:00] right I was reading another commentary
[18:03] Naomi wasn't bitter against God she was
[18:05] returning back to her land of promise
[18:08] sometimes when we seek the leadership of
[18:10] the Lord he will take things from us so
[18:13] that we can get back to the land of
[18:15] promise right there are a few different
[18:17] directions I can go here but I want to
[18:19] focus here on verses 14 through 18.
[18:22] where where there was Ruth Ruth and
[18:25] orpha and there was these two and they
[18:27] had their mother-in-law and they both
[18:29] had a desire in their hearts to stay
[18:32] with their mother-in-law
[18:34] looking at the the spiritual standpoint
[18:37] here right they both had that desire
[18:39] sometimes we have the Christian feeling
[18:42] in our hearts right we have a genuine
[18:44] love for the Lord we have a genuine love
[18:46] for his word but the Lord is looking at
[18:48] what you're going to do with those
[18:50] desires right he's looking at a true
[18:52] willingness to yield yourself to the
[18:55] Lord Jesus a true willingness to yield
[18:58] your God will be my God is what she said
[19:00] obviously Ruth had seen that Naomi had
[19:02] lived her life to God and decided to
[19:05] forsake her God she forsook her lands
[19:08] and yielded to the true God
[19:10] the com the commentator makes a
[19:12] statement here that I love not to
[19:14] glorify ourselves but sometimes your
[19:16] trust in God and turning towards him in
[19:18] tough times yielding to him no matter
[19:21] your situation will often be the thing
[19:24] that draws others to the Lord
[19:27] wow
[19:29] let that be our lives this morning amen
[19:33] I'm just running out of time so let me
[19:35] just
[19:36] um
[19:38] you know uh shows that even that no
[19:40] Naomi had the the had been a Believer
[19:43] the entirety of her time in Moab 10 plus
[19:45] years but Ruth in that time had never
[19:49] made any kind of allegiance to her God
[19:51] the god of Israel but yet as soon as
[19:53] Naomi stood and said I'm going back to
[19:56] the god of Israel I'll put my fate in
[19:59] his hands finally she came to a place of
[20:01] total yielding right and Spurgeon picks
[20:04] this up and says if you think that
[20:06] you'll persuade your friends maybe this
[20:07] is for the young people maybe it's for
[20:08] the old people and maybe it's for all of
[20:10] us but maybe if you think that you'll
[20:12] persuade your friends or relatives to
[20:13] Jesus by your compromise you were
[20:15] mistaken
[20:17] perhaps you are sincere but you are
[20:19] still mistaken only a bold stand for
[20:22] Jesus will really do it Hallelujah you
[20:26] will never win any soul to the right by
[20:28] compromise with the wrong it is a
[20:30] decision for Christ and his truth that
[20:32] has the greatest power in the family and
[20:34] the greatest power in the world Amen
[20:40] I just want this this simple study to
[20:42] just pull on our heartstrings this
[20:44] morning and I want to be able to to look
[20:47] at the circumstances in our lives and be
[20:51] able to look at what Ruth
[20:54] had and what her sister-in-law had they
[20:58] both had a desire in their hearts to be
[21:01] with the Mother-in-law they both had a
[21:03] desire in their hearts to let's just
[21:05] look at a spiritual we both have a
[21:06] desire in our hearts to serve the Lord
[21:08] we have these things in our hearts that
[21:10] we have desires we come to church we try
[21:12] to do the right things but the Lord is
[21:13] looking for us to yield completely in
[21:15] all those situations he's looking for a
[21:18] total surrender so that he can lead
[21:20] every aspect of Our Lives he doesn't
[21:22] want just a Christian feeling in our
[21:24] lives he doesn't want just a just a
[21:26] confession he wants a confession and a
[21:28] move forward amen he wants us to to to
[21:31] master the small things in our life
[21:33] through yielding to him
[21:35] I pray that we can just seek be quick to
[21:39] seek forgiveness and always make it
[21:41] right to be accountable for what we do
[21:43] and to deal with and this is a tough
[21:46] thing but to deal with the uncomfortable
[21:48] things in our life the small things that
[21:50] hinder our walk with the Lord
[21:53] brother Branham speaks on uh you know
[21:56] hearing recognizing and acting upon the
[21:58] word you hear the word amen we sit in
[22:01] church and we hear the word as we grow
[22:03] up and and we recognize that this is the
[22:05] truth that we recognize that this is
[22:07] this is the hour that we're living in
[22:09] but now it's our duty to act upon it
[22:12] Hallelujah
[22:13] if we leave today I just want us to all
[22:16] just be able to start praying that
[22:17] prayer Lord help me to yield
[22:20] and it's got to go further than just a
[22:22] desire in your hearts it takes acting
[22:25] upon the word
[22:27] who who's which of the daughter-in-laws
[22:30] will you choose to be this morning will
[22:32] you choose to be Ruth who who the one on
[22:36] who the Redeemer chooses or will you
