[5:29] God bless you
[5:31] good to be back and see everybody's
[5:33] faces
[5:34] let's stand
[5:40] gracious Heavenly Father we come before
[5:41] you Lord and we thank you for your word
[5:44] we thank you for your light we ask the
[5:46] Lord that you'd take your
[5:48] take each one of your people here Lord
[5:50] and move in our hearts Lord speak to us
[5:54] we want to commit ourselves to you Lord
[5:56] and and we want you to be glorified in
[5:59] our midst
[6:00] take your word Lord and anoint it to our
[6:02] hearts we ask in Jesus name amen
[6:05] all right we're gonna
[6:07] start a new series on our future home
[6:11] and if you want to bring that PowerPoint
[6:14] up brother Mark we're going to look at
[6:15] revelation
[6:17] 21 verse 5.
[6:26] and he that sat upon the throne said
[6:29] behold I make all things new and he said
[6:32] unto me
[6:34] write for these words are true and
[6:37] faithful
[6:38] and then we'll look ahead to revelation
[6:41] 22
[6:43] verse 3
[6:45] and just read the first portion of that
[6:49] and there shall be no more curse
[6:52] amen may the Lord add the blessing to
[6:54] the reading of his word you can be
[6:56] seated
[7:02] so here we look at this and we see this
[7:05] is God God
[7:07] bringing things back to his original
[7:10] purpose his original intention
[7:13] so when
[7:15] when God created everything in the
[7:17] beginning
[7:19] he he made he made an earth he made a
[7:23] universe he made everything so that man
[7:26] could live on this Earth
[7:29] that's that's amazing but even better
[7:31] than that we understand we look at
[7:34] Genesis
[7:35] 3 8 and we see
[7:38] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[7:40] walking in the garden
[7:42] in the cool of the day
[7:45] so this was what God did so God was
[7:47] walking
[7:48] with man upon the Earth there was no
[7:51] separation
[7:52] there was there was no sin there was no
[7:55] evil everything was in perfect order and
[8:00] when God saw all of all of it
[8:03] the completion of creation he said
[8:05] behold is very good
[8:07] and so we can see then then when we read
[8:09] in the Book of Revelation he says behold
[8:12] I make All Things New
[8:16] and will as as we look at this study
[8:19] we'll understand what he's what God is
[8:22] showing us and telling us is he is going
[8:26] to renew everything he's going to
[8:28] restore everything he's going to bring
[8:31] it back to its original intention and
[8:36] purpose
[8:37] and so we know when we look at at
[8:40] Genesis 1 26 and 27 and 28 the creation
[8:46] of of man and woman
[8:49] his purpose was for them to take
[8:51] Dominion
[8:53] and to fill up the Earth right so
[8:57] they know they never did that
[9:00] in its original condition
[9:02] the Earth is filled up now
[9:05] but it's under a curse it's under a
[9:08] perversion and so God's purpose is to
[9:11] lift the curse
[9:15] God wants to walk with man
[9:19] and uh not having the PowerPoint has my
[9:21] brain all discombobulated right now but
[9:24] as I'm looking at this and I'm seeing
[9:26] this you think about when God
[9:29] when God put
[9:31] together his Nation when he brought
[9:33] Israel
[9:35] into the promised land when he was
[9:37] leading Israel
[9:39] what did God what did God do how did he
[9:42] lead them
[9:44] so he his purpose was not for them to
[9:48] have a human King
[9:50] even a human government
[9:53] see he set forward a priesthood but also
[9:56] remember
[9:58] bigger than that is he said to them I
[10:01] want to make you a nation a kingdom of
[10:05] priests
[10:06] so so when we came to that great
[10:08] confrontation where the people asked for
[10:10] a king
[10:11] they said we want a king like to go out
[10:14] in and out before us like all the other
[10:16] nations
[10:17] and in God's sight this was a great
[10:20] rejection this was a great uh this was
[10:23] horrible
[10:25] this was a great negative because
[10:27] what were they doing they weren't
[10:29] rejecting Samuel they were rejecting God
[10:32] the leadership of God himself
[10:37] I learned this recently and it it really
[10:39] struck me because in
[10:42] um
[10:43] in Egypt when they would go to war
[10:47] Pharaoh would go out with them and what
[10:49] they had for Pharaoh was actually a tent
[10:54] he lit he would live in a tent there
[10:56] would be an outer Court there would be
[10:57] an inner court and then there would be a
[10:59] holy of holies and Pharaoh would sit on
[11:02] a throne with angels Wings above him
[11:06] saying this is the god of Egypt right
[11:09] well here we have God and of course
[11:13] there there they built that I guess
[11:16] after the pattern you see brother
[11:17] Brandon even says Nebuchadnezzar Bill
[11:20] built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
[11:23] after the pattern of Heaven even the
[11:26] even the pagans every once in a while
[11:29] can hit on what some something that's
[11:31] real that can type out what God is
[11:34] actually doing even though it's in a
[11:36] perverted fashion in a perverted
[11:39] understanding so
[11:40] here we have the Egyptians with their
[11:42] god king
[11:44] leading the armies of Egypt in in his
[11:48] holy of holies well God's purpose was
[11:52] not to have that filled by some man
[11:57] some sinner God's purpose was to be that
[12:00] Supernatural fire
[12:02] to to be the king to lead his people and
[12:05] so when it came to Samuel and they said
[12:08] we want a king what was it they rejected
[12:11] they were rejecting and turning away
[12:14] from God and God said okay I'll give
[12:16] that to you and he raised up David and I
[12:19] began to think about this how does this
[12:21] fit in with the fact that there is a
[12:24] messiah there's an anointed one a man
[12:26] Anointed with God our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:29] who is Seated on the throne and that as
[12:31] I begin to think about this and look
[12:33] forward in this is that in the
[12:36] Millennium that's where the davidic
[12:38] promise is really fulfilled
[12:40] where the temple is restored and where
[12:43] the true son of David rules and reigns
[12:47] forever but we know that forever is not
[12:49] Eternal forever is a space of time it's
[12:52] a long space of time he'll Rule and
[12:54] Reign for a thousand years but remember
[12:56] in First Corinthians 15 it says the son
[12:59] actually submits the kingdom over to the
[13:03] father so that God can be all in all I
[13:07] believe this is showing that the
[13:09] original purpose of God
[13:11] is be will be accomplished and that is
[13:14] that God himself will live among us will
[13:17] dwell Among Us the Bible says in um
[13:20] Revelation 21 verse 1 through 4 I'm
[13:23] going to read that
[13:25] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[13:27] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[13:29] were passed away and there was no more
[13:32] sea
[13:33] and I John saw the holy city New
[13:35] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[13:37] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[13:39] her husband and I heard a great voice
[13:41] out of Heaven saying behold the
[13:43] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[13:46] will dwell with them and they shall be
[13:49] his people and God himself shall be with
[13:51] them and be their God I'll just stop
[13:54] there
[13:55] Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart
[13:57] for they shall see God that's the
[14:00] ultimate promise for us is for us to see
[14:03] God we see him now by spiritual
[14:06] revelation
[14:08] but on the new Heaven and the new Earth
[14:11] that will be where the Bible says God
[14:14] will be all in all God's purpose for
[14:18] Israel was for them all to be a kingdom
[14:20] of priests right it was for him he
[14:23] himself to lead them not through not not
[14:27] through a king but he himself would be
[14:29] in them and redeem and and they'd be
[14:32] totally led by him he would raise up
[14:35] someone to lead for this he would raise
[14:36] up someone to lead for this he would
[14:38] raise up someone to lead for this it's
[14:40] the same way he wants to lead his church
[14:42] he has the Seven Stars he raises them up
[14:44] he raises them up in each age for a
[14:46] purpose but there we don't have we don't
[14:48] have a king other than the Lord Jesus
[14:50] Christ that's our only King we don't
[14:52] have an Earthly Pope we don't have an
[14:54] Earthly uh uh supreme leader the supreme
[14:58] leader of the church is not the
[15:00] Ayatollah Khomeini it's the Holy Spirit
[15:04] and so this is God's purpose and Heaven
[15:07] as we speak about it is going to be here
[15:10] on Earth and God is going to bring it
[15:14] all around back to his original purpose
[15:18] that the Tabernacle of God would be with
[15:21] men
[15:22] many times when we think about heaven we
[15:24] get it mixed around the Tabernacle of
[15:26] man is with God that's what we think
[15:29] we're going to go up to heaven and be
[15:31] with god well there's a certain extent
[15:33] that that's true now
[15:35] when when we die now but that's not
[15:37] God's ultimate purpose God's ultimate
[15:40] purpose is that his Dwelling Place will
[15:43] be here on Earth now you can't dwell on
[15:45] Earth why because of sin because of evil
[15:48] but when Redemption is completed in that
[15:50] new Heaven and that new Earth
[15:53] then he can come and dwell in that place
[15:59] so God portrays heaven to us
[16:02] as a garden
[16:05] a city
[16:07] and a kingdom
[16:09] he doesn't portray it to us as outer
[16:12] space
[16:13] as a cloud
[16:15] as some
[16:17] clean room where you go and it's just
[16:20] white and foggy and smoky sure there's
[16:23] pictures of that but that's a picture of
[16:24] the Tabernacle
[16:26] of the dwelling place of God it speaks
[16:28] of the smoke and so forth but that's
[16:30] even a dispensational view that's not
[16:32] what it's always like right
[16:35] so if God's picture of heaven
[16:38] or a better way to say it is our Eternal
[16:41] state
[16:42] is a garden
[16:45] a city
[16:46] and a kingdom we have to see this in the
[16:50] correct light I think all of us can be
[16:53] impacted by cultural pictures by what we
[16:57] hear about heaven and then we get a
[16:59] picture in our mind and it's this other
[17:01] Earthly place if we really want to
[17:04] understand what heaven is like don't
[17:08] think about someplace off in outer space
[17:10] or up on a cloud
[17:12] or some Smoky foggy room no that's not
[17:15] what it is think of this Earth without
[17:18] sin without evil without sickness think
[17:21] of this Earth restored to its original
[17:25] condition
[17:29] if it's a again Abraham was sent
[17:33] to look for a city and for a kingdom
[17:36] whose Builder and maker was God where
[17:39] was he sent was he sent in a spaceship
[17:43] no he went he was on Earth looking for a
[17:46] city which in in itself is a type of us
[17:49] as pilgrims and strangers Abraham never
[17:51] found a city
[17:53] why why didn't he find a city
[17:56] because it wasn't for that age for that
[17:58] time
[17:59] God was using Abraham to show us
[18:01] something Abraham will find a city
[18:04] he's going to reach that City he's going
[18:06] to have that promise
[18:08] but he didn't receive it in this life
[18:10] but the point being is he what he didn't
[18:12] take a spaceship to try to find the city
[18:14] he didn't go to the moon or Jupiter or
[18:17] something he was looking here on Earth
[18:23] God made us in the beginning
[18:27] with physical bodies
[18:29] on a physical planet
[18:31] in a physical unit Universe he made
[18:34] Rivers he made Lakes he made Seas he
[18:36] made streams mountains grasslands
[18:38] forests
[18:39] Etc
[18:40] he didn't make us to walk on the clouds
[18:44] he made us to walk on earth
[18:47] heaven
[18:49] when we think about heaven
[18:51] please let's stop thinking about
[18:53] someplace off in the clouds that's what
[18:56] that's all the cultural pictures and you
[18:58] read the cartoons and somehow that
[19:00] impacts on our minds and we start to
[19:03] think of it that way even the current
[19:05] heaven
[19:07] isn't like that
[19:09] you know you we'll we'll look
[19:11] specifically as we go on but brother
[19:14] Branham in his visions and his of of
[19:16] Heaven
[19:17] never never saw a cloud
[19:21] that's not what he saw he saw palaces
[19:24] he saw Earthly things
[19:30] just think of the first time maybe you
[19:32] saw the Rocky Mountains or you saw a
[19:35] sunrise at the ocean
[19:37] there's probably like a gasp of
[19:40] awestruck wonder that you had
[19:42] I think heaven will be the same
[19:44] experience
[19:46] those those times and you can all
[19:48] remember it maybe you're you're with
[19:50] your family and you're out camping and
[19:52] you see the beauty of God's creation and
[19:55] just the presence that God washes over
[19:58] you and you feel like I could just this
[20:00] could this should be for all of eternity
[20:03] that's what that's a foretaste of that
[20:06] if you're a Believer that's a foretaste
[20:08] of what heaven will be like
[20:10] only it won't end it won't come to it
[20:13] won't come come to an end it will
[20:15] continue
[20:19] another thing that we hear many times
[20:21] when we speak about heaven is that while
[20:24] we can't know
[20:26] what heaven is going to be like
[20:29] and it's a scripture that we all are
[20:31] familiar with but it's always an
[20:33] unfinished scripture because it's it's
[20:36] quoted just one part of it and the rest
[20:38] of it is left out say we can't know what
[20:41] God has in store for us but it's going
[20:43] to be great okay except for that's not
[20:47] what the verse is saying at all
[20:49] I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has
[20:52] it entered into the heart of man what
[20:54] God has in store for them that love him
[20:57] oh oh so we can never know what's going
[21:00] to be Heaven it's just going to be great
[21:01] read the next verse but
[21:05] God has revealed them unto us by his
[21:08] spirit
[21:10] so we can know
[21:12] we can know the things that God has in
[21:14] store for us we can't know it by human
[21:17] thinking we can't know it by Logic and
[21:20] reason
[21:21] logic and reason the best It produced I
[21:25] guess in history was
[21:28] Plato Aristotle Socrates and what was
[21:32] their Viewpoint well flesh physical
[21:35] things are evil
[21:37] spiritual things are good so their
[21:39] Viewpoint of Heaven is it's a spiritual
[21:42] place there's nothing physical
[21:44] about it it's only spiritual you go you
[21:47] go to this cloud
[21:50] and see that type of thinking if you
[21:52] understand the early church
[21:55] many of the theologians of the early
[21:57] church were also the head professor of a
[22:01] philosophical School
[22:03] in Alexandria and the different places
[22:05] of learning back then
[22:08] and so they combined Greek philosophy
[22:11] with Biblical understanding and they
[22:15] came to a perversion about many things
[22:18] it's not an un other Earthly place and
[22:21] the physical
[22:22] is only evil because of the Fall
[22:25] it's not inherently evil right God
[22:29] intends to change all that that's that's
[22:31] why Christ came in the flesh
[22:34] and put sin to Death In the Flesh why
[22:38] because he's going to change he's going
[22:39] to make all things new
[22:41] he's going to renew everything
[22:43] it's it's not that we when this body
[22:46] dies we go to some spiritual body
[22:49] no
[22:51] God's ultimate purpose is that our
[22:54] theophany and this body become one into
[22:58] a glorified body
[23:00] and that's a physical thing Jesus says
[23:03] touch me for a spirit has not Flesh and
[23:07] Bones
[23:08] see he has a resurrected Lord Jesus he
[23:12] was physical he could be touched
[23:16] he had nail scars still in his hand I
[23:18] believe that's going to be an eternal
[23:20] memorial for our Redemption for all of
[23:23] eternity he'll have nail scars as a
[23:25] memory for us
[23:30] even even the very word Redemption
[23:35] speaks of this
[23:37] Redemption we think we we many times
[23:39] think of redemption and salvation
[23:42] it's not exactly the same word to save
[23:44] something doesn't mean the same thing as
[23:47] redeeming something redeeming something
[23:49] is you lost it
[23:51] now you need to go and pay a price to
[23:53] get it back so then you pay the price
[23:55] and then you have to take it back at
[23:57] Calvary
[23:58] Jesus Christ paid the price
[24:01] right but he hasn't taken it back yet
[24:03] that's only the first part of redemption
[24:05] now he's got to take it back and
[24:07] remember he didn't he didn't just pay
[24:08] the price
[24:10] for you for your soul he paid the price
[24:13] for the whole thing
[24:14] he prayed the price for all of
[24:16] redemption both the Earth that you're
[24:19] living in and the Earth that you're
[24:21] living on
[24:22] both have to be completely redeemed
[24:26] not only that but it's speaking of a
[24:29] payment of Ransom someone has been sold
[24:32] under slavery
[24:33] so you pay that Ransom so that person
[24:36] can be set free and be released from
[24:38] slavery
[24:40] Romans 8 23 speaks of this not only they
[24:44] not only they the creation ourselves
[24:46] also which have the first fruits of the
[24:48] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[24:51] ourselves waiting for the adoption the
[24:54] Redemption
[24:55] to it the Redemption of our bodies
[24:58] we're waiting for that full release
[25:00] we're still our bodies are still under a
[25:03] form of slavery
[25:06] we still sin
[25:09] we still go towards evil
[25:12] even though in our in our soul we don't
[25:14] want to do that but there's a nature
[25:16] there that's taking us toward that that
[25:18] itself has to be redeemed
[25:22] that release will take place but we also
[25:24] know that
[25:25] creation itself is groaning creation
[25:28] itself will be released and set free
[25:32] from bondage when after we are
[25:36] when we're set free when we become fully
[25:39] manifested as Sons then the creation can
[25:43] be set free as well
[25:47] the reality of our future State needs to
[25:50] become a revelation to us it can't be
[25:53] just a side issue one of many doctrines
[25:56] that we think about and talk about it
[25:59] needs to be a reality because
[26:01] if we don't if we don't see Heaven
[26:05] correctly and we don't have a longing
[26:07] and a passion for the for what God has
[26:10] for us in the future
[26:12] then I believe we become useless and
[26:15] become fruitless
[26:16] because when you have a real revelation
[26:19] of what God's plans are for us our
[26:22] future home
[26:24] then he'd become Fearless
[26:26] then you can risk lay aside everything
[26:30] but if your whole thinking is just
[26:32] limited to
[26:33] oh I have to serve him now
[26:36] the Christians long ago had that vision
[26:40] of their future State they had that
[26:42] vision of their reward and they could go
[26:46] and had become
[26:48] Martyrs and sacrifice a sacrifice there
[26:52] they could give up their lives
[26:55] were too much tied to this life to this
[26:58] place we have it so comfortable so easy
[27:03] um
[27:05] we we speak about heaven
[27:08] in America and you know
[27:11] it's oh man that's really that's really
[27:14] neat that's the reaction speak about
[27:16] heaven in a place where people are
[27:17] suffering and the tears are rolling and
[27:19] the thankfulness is coming thinking
[27:22] about oh my
[27:23] this is what we have to offer not that
[27:25] it wouldn't come for us but we become so
[27:28] comfortable
[27:30] here we need we need to have that idea
[27:33] that comfortableness blown up
[27:37] because we shouldn't be comfortable here
[27:39] this isn't our home
[27:41] we're pilgrims and strangers here
[27:47] Genesis chapter 2
[27:53] verses 9.
[27:55] through 15 we're going to read
[28:01] and out of the ground
[28:02] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[28:05] that is Pleasant to the site and good
[28:07] for food
[28:08] the tree of life also in the midst of
[28:10] the garden and the tree of the knowledge
[28:12] of Good and Evil
[28:14] and a river went out of Eden to water
[28:16] the garden and from thence it was parted
[28:18] and became into four heads
[28:21] the name of the first is python that is
[28:25] it which can pass it the whole land of
[28:27] havilah where there is gold and the gold
[28:29] of that land is good there's bedelium
[28:32] and the Onyx Stone and the name of the
[28:33] second river is gehon the same is it
[28:35] that can passeth the whole land of
[28:37] Ethiopia
[28:38] in the name of the third river is
[28:40] hidikal that is it which goeth toward
[28:42] the east of Assyria and the fourth river
[28:44] is Euphrates and the Lord God took the
[28:46] man and put him into the Garden of Eden
[28:49] to dress it and to keep it this is
[28:52] before the fall so here we have God
[28:56] creating this place for his glory to be
[28:59] seen and enjoyed he created all these
[29:02] things
[29:03] not only that but if you look at this
[29:05] closely he created
[29:08] stones
[29:09] and metal precious metal and he put them
[29:14] in the Earth
[29:15] right and so he tell and then he tells
[29:18] Adam I'm putting you here to dress and
[29:22] to keep the garden now God created the
[29:25] garden
[29:26] but he intended for man to maintain that
[29:29] Garden before the fall
[29:32] right brother Branham says when we go to
[29:34] heaven we're not going to play a harp
[29:36] on on a cloud but we're going to live
[29:39] we're going to work we're going to eat
[29:40] we're going to real life he says so
[29:44] understand that this restoration it's a
[29:46] restoration Adam was that put there to
[29:49] work
[29:51] work isn't a bad thing
[29:54] work is is actually what we were created
[29:56] to do
[29:58] Jesus said my father worketh hitherto
[30:01] and I work
[30:02] right so we're made God is a worker
[30:06] God Is Creative he made us in His image
[30:09] we are to be creative we're to work
[30:12] we're to make order the speaking of a
[30:15] garden itself is speaking of something
[30:17] that has order to it has shape to it not
[30:19] only that but he put as I said he put
[30:22] gold and different stones in the earth
[30:24] why because he intended for man to dig
[30:28] and to find it and to create something
[30:31] with it right he put that creativity in
[30:36] the heart of man to do it he wanted us
[30:38] to build
[30:39] a city is what
[30:41] city has order to it
[30:43] right it and it takes building
[30:47] it takes CR it takes a creative
[30:50] touch to do that and he put that within
[30:53] us to work
[30:56] God made all of these things he did it
[30:58] he didn't just make the just leave it
[31:00] there let it be wild and just go off and
[31:03] sit under a palm tree
[31:06] for all of eternity we'll have plenty of
[31:08] time to sit under a palm tree however
[31:11] however there's there's work and I I
[31:14] believe that
[31:15] the worst thing for a person today is to
[31:20] be born into a situation where they
[31:22] never have to work in their life
[31:25] it's it's horrible that's not just a
[31:27] result of the Fall
[31:29] that's just in general that's the
[31:32] position of us as
[31:35] created in the image and likeness of God
[31:37] we are not made to sit and be lazy we're
[31:40] made with bodies to work to work hard to
[31:44] exert ourselves to create something to
[31:47] accomplish things God made us to do that
[31:50] he put it in our hearts and in our lives
[31:52] to do that and it's not a result of the
[31:55] fall this is what God's purpose was to
[31:58] do in the beginning
[32:00] the curse wasn't oh Adam now you're
[32:02] going to have to cultivate food
[32:05] no the curse was now when you're
[32:08] cultivating food
[32:09] there will be thorns and thistles that
[32:11] will come see
[32:13] there there was going to be Farmers
[32:15] before the fall there was going to be
[32:17] Shepherds before the fall there was
[32:19] going to be
[32:20] people that were Builders there was
[32:22] going to be people that dug in the
[32:24] ground before the fall all of these
[32:26] things that we we don't think about very
[32:28] much at all those things were to be
[32:31] there before the fall only difference
[32:32] was there was North Thorns or thistles
[32:34] or evil
[32:36] or sickness or pain or injury there
[32:39] to to hinder all of that and
[32:44] there's eventually there'll be no devil
[32:48] to get involved and bring destruction
[32:50] now everything that man touches is what
[32:53] it's from the Tree of the knowledge of
[32:55] Good and Evil
[32:56] there's good every technology that comes
[32:59] it seems there's good and a whole lot of
[33:00] evil
[33:02] that wasn't God's original intent and
[33:04] purpose for man
[33:06] man is to to invent and create and make
[33:10] works of art and books and poetry and
[33:14] these things without the influence of
[33:16] Satan there
[33:18] amen let's stand and pray
[33:25] gracious father we come before you Lord
[33:26] and we just want to commit ourselves
[33:28] again to you Lord we ask that your
[33:30] presence would be with us that you would
[33:32] be glorified in our midst Lord that we
[33:34] would just turn our eyes from the things
[33:36] of the world and turn them towards you
[33:38] as we worship Lord anoint the
[33:40] anoint the musicians anoint the preacher
[33:44] and anoint each believer here father to
[33:46] receive of you we ask in Jesus name amen
[33:49] God bless you
[33:53] thank you
[34:02] thank you
