[42:36] surgery will go well

[42:56] lord bless that's from brother joe

[43:03] injured his lungs and so there he's got
[43:06] an increased risk of
[43:08] of post-operative pneumonia which is
[43:11] always a risk
[43:12] but amen we're just going to trust the
[43:14] lord that the same one who brought him
[43:15] through that
[43:16] bring him through this amen so we're
[43:19] believing that that
[43:21] will be the case amen we're going to
[43:25] go right into the word uh this morning
[43:29] and we're going to have you find your
[43:31] place in genesis 17
[43:34] and i've got a request that i'm going to
[43:38] catch here
[44:06] um
[44:34] okay
[44:55] and the dad's name was kevin
[44:59] yeah ellie ellie and kevin amen
[45:02] we'll read our text and then we will uh
[45:06] we'll take that to prayer it's a lengthy
[45:08] text i apologize for keeping you
[45:10] standing but let's look in genesis 17
[45:13] amen we're going to catch uh verses 1
[45:17] um if i sent you through 27 we're only
[45:20] going to go down through 22.
[45:22] i see why that's doing that yeah we're
[45:23] going to read 1-22
[45:26] and when abram was 90 years old in nine
[45:29] the lord
[45:30] appeared to abram and said unto him i
[45:33] am the almighty god walk before me
[45:36] and be thou perfect pretty tall order
[45:38] isn't it
[45:41] and i will make my covenant between me
[45:44] and thee
[45:46] and will multiply thee exceedingly and
[45:49] abram
[45:50] fell on his face and god talked with him
[45:53] saying
[45:54] as for me behold my covenant is with
[45:57] thee
[45:57] and thou shalt be a father of many
[46:00] nations
[46:02] now it's pretty incredible because the
[46:04] lord has given him
[46:06] seemingly an impossible task walk before
[46:09] me and be perfect
[46:11] but if you'll notice god is not asking
[46:14] abraham
[46:14] and he's not asking you today to do or
[46:17] be anything
[46:18] that he's not going to equip you for and
[46:20] so he
[46:21] god immediately because you can imagine
[46:23] how stunning that was imagine if you
[46:25] heard that
[46:26] and walk before me and be perfect but
[46:28] god is immediately going to come in the
[46:30] in verse 2 i'm going to make my covenant
[46:33] i got this abraham
[46:34] i'll multiply thee abraham falls on his
[46:37] face
[46:38] i guess i would have too and he says
[46:41] you know verse 4 my covenant is with
[46:43] thee thou shalt be a father of many
[46:45] nations neither now watch what god is
[46:47] going to do
[46:48] neither shall thy name any more be
[46:50] called abram
[46:51] but thy name shall be abraham so he's
[46:53] adding an h
[46:55] and in the hebrew h stands for deity
[46:58] so he's he's saying i'm making a
[47:00] covenant with you and this ain't going
[47:02] to be just
[47:03] name only this isn't just you know
[47:05] something you can put over or
[47:07] you know on a plaque on the wall i'm
[47:09] actually going to add
[47:10] deity into you to bring this to pass all
[47:13] right
[47:15] all right and i and he and he did the
[47:17] same thing to sarai and gay
[47:19] and changed her from sarai to sarah
[47:21] added an h to his bride also
[47:24] amen all right and i will make
[47:28] the verse six exceeding fruitful
[47:33] and i i will make i will
[47:37] make i've told you what i need you to do
[47:39] abraham but i'm making a covenant with
[47:41] you
[47:41] i'm going to do i'm going to go to work
[47:43] on this all right
[47:45] i will make the exceeding fruitful
[47:48] and i will make nations of thee
[47:51] and kings shall come out of thee and i
[47:55] will establish my covenant between me
[47:57] and thee
[47:58] and thy seed after thee in their
[48:00] generations
[48:01] for an everlasting covenant so you see
[48:04] yourself there
[48:05] the children of abraham you've been
[48:07] enjoined by the blood
[48:10] through christ man all right
[48:13] so i will establish my covenant
[48:18] through in their generations for an
[48:20] everlasting covenant to be a god unto
[48:22] thee
[48:23] and to thy seed after the verse eight
[48:26] and i will look at everything god is
[48:28] doing to bring this to pass
[48:30] i will give unto thee and to thy
[48:34] seed after thee the land where wherein
[48:37] thou art a stranger
[48:39] all the land of canaan for an
[48:42] everlasting possession
[48:43] and i will be their god and god said
[48:47] unto abraham see nice calling by his new
[48:50] name
[48:51] thou shalt keep my covenant therefore
[48:54] thou
[48:54] and thy seed after thee in their
[48:56] generations this is my covenant
[48:59] which ye shall keep between me and you
[49:02] and thy seat after thee
[49:04] every man among you shall be circumcised
[49:06] and ye shall circumcise the flesh
[49:09] of your foreskin and it shall be a token
[49:12] of the covenant between me and you
[49:16] and he that is eight days old shall be
[49:19] circumcised among you every man child in
[49:21] your generations
[49:23] he that is born in the house or bought
[49:26] with money
[49:27] of any stranger which is not of thy seed
[49:31] he that is born in thine house and he
[49:33] that is bought with money
[49:35] must needs be circumcised and my
[49:37] covenant shall be
[49:39] in your flesh for an everlasting
[49:41] covenant
[49:42] and the uncircumcised man
[49:46] man child whose flesh of the foreskin is
[49:48] not circumcised
[49:50] that soul shall be cut off from his
[49:53] people
[49:54] he hath broken my covenant
[49:57] and god said unto abraham as for sarai
[50:01] thy wife thou shalt not call her name
[50:04] sarai
[50:05] but sarah shall her name be
[50:08] and i will bless her and give thee a son
[50:12] also of her yea i will bless her
[50:16] and she shall be a mother of nations
[50:18] kings
[50:19] of people shall be of her then
[50:23] abraham fell upon his face and laughed
[50:27] and said in his heart shall a child be
[50:30] born unto him that is a hundred years
[50:32] old and shall
[50:33] sarah that is 90 years old bear
[50:37] and abram said unto god oh that ishmael
[50:40] might live before thee
[50:43] and god said sarah thy wife
[50:46] shall bear thee a son indeed and thou
[50:49] shalt call his name isaac and i will
[50:51] establish my covenant with him
[50:54] for an everlasting covenant and with his
[50:57] seed after him and as for his smell i
[51:00] have heard thee behold i have blessed
[51:02] him and i will make him
[51:03] fruitful and will multiply him
[51:05] exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[51:07] beget and i will make him a great nation
[51:09] but my covenant
[51:11] will i establish was with isaac which
[51:15] sarah shall bear unto thee at this time
[51:19] in the next year and he left off

[54:00] one
[54:01] okay now we're looking at
[54:05] the final season and our next slide will
[54:08] reveal that we're continuing with this
[54:10] harvest time
[54:12] our next slide please and we should see
[54:15] that come up
[54:16] there we go and now i want to i was
[54:20] going to
[54:20] read this to you out of the bible but
[54:23] i'm i decided
[54:24] for the to to save redundancy
[54:27] and save some time we would just go
[54:30] through it together thank you sir
[54:32] all right now paul is going to pick up
[54:36] in our opening slide when we when we
[54:38] advance to the next frame
[54:40] paul is going to uh kind of
[54:44] bring it all into perspective of
[54:47] you know why the world
[54:52] has went crazy all right even in his day
[54:56] and paul is just going to take one big
[54:59] 30 000 foot view and he's going to go
[55:01] all the way back
[55:03] coming out of the garden of eden and
[55:05] he's going to
[55:06] what he's attempting to do is explain
[55:10] how we got to where we are and the
[55:12] madness that was
[55:13] in the world and historically had always
[55:16] been in the world
[55:17] and even from paul's day they could look
[55:20] back through 4
[55:21] 000 years of old testament history
[55:24] and not just in israel but in babylon
[55:27] and
[55:27] among the medo-persians and among
[55:29] alexander and among the romans and all
[55:31] the gentile kingdoms
[55:33] how that they always were they they
[55:35] could start out ever so good but
[55:37] corruption and sin and iniquity would
[55:40] always eat them out from the inside
[55:42] and that's what happened to babylon it's
[55:44] what happened to the persians it's what
[55:45] happened to alexander it's what happened
[55:47] to the romans
[55:48] the roman republic started out on very
[55:51] noble ideas that they got from the
[55:54] greeks
[55:54] you know about uh being a republic they
[55:57] weren't an empire they were a republic
[55:59] when they first started you don't
[56:00] you can't really make the argument for
[56:02] empire until augustus probably
[56:04] but we find out that even under julius
[56:07] caesar there's still an imperial
[56:09] uh state and and they had a
[56:12] a government that that worked like a
[56:16] democracy of sorts they had a senate and
[56:19] they had
[56:20] you know they whenever they got in
[56:21] trouble they'd bring a caesar and give
[56:23] him
[56:23] you know autonomous power and then then
[56:26] when the crisis was over he would
[56:28] relinquish that and
[56:29] control would go back and they had
[56:30] courts and justice very much the same
[56:33] as our republic was founded on we're a
[56:36] long ways from it just like they got a
[56:37] long ways from it
[56:39] but corruption ate them out from the
[56:41] inside and that's always been the case
[56:44] and great great
[56:48] swaths of history deal
[56:52] with the perversions that have went on
[56:56] among fallen mankind in every
[56:59] civilized even in the civilized
[57:02] countries and
[57:03] perversions of all kinds and paul is
[57:06] just going to say look
[57:07] i'm just going to give you an
[57:08] explanation and it not only happened in
[57:10] the gentiles that happened to the
[57:12] jews to where by the time you get to
[57:14] ahab i mean it's just complete
[57:16] corruption everywhere
[57:18] and and and and finally they're taken uh
[57:21] captive uh by the assyrians and then by
[57:24] the babylonians
[57:26] and so we we find out that he picks up
[57:28] here
[57:29] coming out of genesis now this is this
[57:32] is man
[57:32] starting to cover the face of the earth
[57:35] and you know what's going to happen you
[57:36] know the story
[57:37] he's going to end up all the way to
[57:39] genesis 6
[57:40] and you're going to have the story of
[57:41] noah and the bible says that
[57:44] men's mind all over the world by the
[57:46] time you get to genesis 6
[57:48] man's mind is just evil continually
[57:51] there's no let up in it
[57:53] morning noon and night in some time zone
[57:56] evil is being conspired
[57:58] all right and being perpetrated and so
[58:01] uh then it's going to go from there
[58:03] god's going to recycle it's going to
[58:04] start again it's going to go into shinar
[58:06] by that time
[58:08] and sham goes off the scene and then
[58:10] samira must get started in babylon and
[58:12] here we go again and by the time it
[58:14] reaches
[58:15] abram's day lot is in sodom
[58:18] and you you can see what's happening
[58:20] around the world again
[58:22] and so we find that that jesus would
[58:25] prophesy
[58:26] that that that when there would come an
[58:30] end age and we're we're at it
[58:33] that that one of the signs that you
[58:35] would see and you would know
[58:38] that it's the la that it's the end age
[58:40] and the end of the end age
[58:43] all right is that you would see the
[58:46] double whammy you would see
[58:48] the convergence of the days of noah and
[58:51] the days of lot converge
[58:53] upon humanity and that's uh that had
[58:56] been unprecedented we never had that
[58:58] you understand you'd see the god of this
[59:02] evil age
[59:03] literally become lucifer amen
[59:07] so that that's where we are and i i hope
[59:09] that you're awake to that today
[59:11] i you know i i particularly hope
[59:14] teenagers will pay
[59:15] keen attention because you you you you
[59:19] now
[59:19] live you're you're you're making
[59:22] decisions now in this early
[59:24] portion of you if you're a young man or
[59:26] young woman
[59:27] or even in your 20s and even young
[59:29] married couples and all of us really
[59:31] we're making decisions and you need to
[59:33] make an informed decision
[59:35] and the greatest informed decision you
[59:37] can make is to be informed
[59:39] that satan is the god of everything he's
[59:42] the god of science and politics he's
[59:45] behind all of it
[59:46] every civilization is ruled
[59:49] orchestrated built and controlled
[59:53] by satan and it's always
[59:57] been that way all right let's go through
[1:00:00] it romans 1.
[1:00:02] all right we're going to start at verse
[1:00:03] 21 speaking of coming out of the garden
[1:00:06] now
[1:00:07] because that when they knew god they
[1:00:10] glorified him not
[1:00:12] as god neither were thankful
[1:00:15] but became vain in their imaginations
[1:00:18] and their foolish heart was darkened
[1:00:21] professing themselves to be wise
[1:00:24] they became fools and changed the glory
[1:00:28] of the uncorruptable god into an image
[1:00:31] made like to corruptable man and to
[1:00:34] birds
[1:00:35] and four-footed beasts and creeping
[1:00:37] things
[1:00:38] next slide wherefore now watch
[1:00:42] so here's here's god's reaction to what
[1:00:44] man just did
[1:00:46] now what we just read did god do that or
[1:00:49] did man do that
[1:00:51] man did that now god is it's time now
[1:00:54] god's gonna respond
[1:00:55] all right wherefore god gave
[1:00:59] also gave them up to uncleanness
[1:01:02] through the lust of their own hearts to
[1:01:05] dishonor their own bodies between
[1:01:07] themselves
[1:01:08] who changed the truth of god into a lie
[1:01:13] and worshiped and served the creature
[1:01:16] more than the creator who is blessed
[1:01:19] forever
[1:01:19] next slide for this cause
[1:01:23] all right so now god don't read don't
[1:01:25] read ahead
[1:01:26] now god's gonna up the ante because
[1:01:30] they committed this god responded
[1:01:33] then instead of repenting they get worse
[1:01:36] so now god's going to go to the next
[1:01:38] step for this cause
[1:01:41] god gave them up unto vile affections
[1:01:44] even their women did change the natural
[1:01:47] use into that which is against nature
[1:01:49] this hasn't just been in our day this
[1:01:50] has been down through history
[1:01:52] and likewise also the men leaving the
[1:01:54] natural use of the woman burning their
[1:01:56] lust one toward another
[1:01:58] men with men working that which is
[1:01:59] unseemly and receiving
[1:02:02] in themselves that recompense of their
[1:02:05] error which was
[1:02:06] meat from the nlt it says they suffered
[1:02:08] within themselves
[1:02:10] the penalty they deserve now you know
[1:02:12] what the you know what
[1:02:13] part of the penalty is not only their
[1:02:15] physical afflictions
[1:02:16] but the madness that that germinated
[1:02:20] around the world see
[1:02:23] and so you know a lot of times friends
[1:02:26] you can come out of the world
[1:02:28] and and god save you from something
[1:02:32] and and bring you to your senses and
[1:02:34] bring you to a new birth
[1:02:36] you know you you need to you actually
[1:02:39] kind of have a little bit of an
[1:02:40] advantage on the devil because
[1:02:42] remember it starts out with the devil
[1:02:45] knowing all your weaknesses
[1:02:48] he knows all your vulnerabilities he's
[1:02:50] watched you from birth
[1:02:52] see he said why has he paid so much
[1:02:54] attention to you because he's afraid of
[1:02:55] you
[1:02:56] see now i know he tries to make you
[1:02:58] think it's the other way around you need
[1:02:59] to be afraid of him but he's actually
[1:03:00] terrified of you see
[1:03:02] brother branham said a son a son or
[1:03:04] daughter of god holy ghost field
[1:03:06] go down walk down the street demons howl
[1:03:08] and faint
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:11] at your approach oh no it's a son of god
[1:03:15] run high don't get exposed because
[1:03:17] that's their strength is in
[1:03:18] hiding and so so we we
[1:03:22] find that that when god cleans you up
[1:03:25] now you know where your weaknesses are
[1:03:27] yeah
[1:03:28] now you have an obligation to keep the
[1:03:31] guard up over that now see
[1:03:33] say oh i've been born again i praise god
[1:03:36] you know
[1:03:36] it won't bother me to go back to those
[1:03:38] on old old haunts oh yes it will
[1:03:42] don't do that that's why you need new
[1:03:44] friends and new associations and new
[1:03:46] activities and new
[1:03:47] recreation you need you need to make
[1:03:49] changes to your life
[1:03:50] because it's up to you your response
[1:03:53] because listen friends
[1:03:54] you got to keep that garden weeded out
[1:03:57] from all of those
[1:03:58] seeds you germinated during your sinful
[1:04:00] life
[1:04:01] don't think they won't try to come up
[1:04:03] just because you're a christian
[1:04:06] amen little 101 on how to be an
[1:04:09] overcomer
[1:04:10] all right uh
[1:04:13] they suffered within themselves the
[1:04:15] penalty
[1:04:17] they deserved i i was watching you know
[1:04:20] a news video of of the governor from
[1:04:22] california trying to
[1:04:24] get his mind around you know the the
[1:04:26] latest the latest
[1:04:28] mass shooting the latest one
[1:04:31] and you know we've averaged one one on
[1:04:34] one a month
[1:04:35] since 2016. uh matt was talking about
[1:04:38] columbine today and we've had we've
[1:04:39] literally averaged a mass shooting
[1:04:41] on average once a month in this country
[1:04:45] and so so so we're we're realizing that
[1:04:48] the world's gone insane
[1:04:50] and he's trying to say he comes on the
[1:04:52] on the air what's wrong
[1:04:54] with america and i'm going wow you
[1:04:57] really are blind
[1:04:58] what's up what's the problem with us why
[1:05:00] can't we get this fixed and i just sit
[1:05:02] there i first i felt sorry for him i
[1:05:04] thought
[1:05:05] but but thinking i want to say governor
[1:05:08] knew some
[1:05:09] thinking yourself wise you become a fool
[1:05:13] and you don't see it's right in front of
[1:05:16] you
[1:05:17] and the twisted perversions of man's
[1:05:19] mind you're not going to fix that by
[1:05:21] passing
[1:05:22] a law you're not going to fix that by
[1:05:25] restricting this or restricting that or
[1:05:28] the the
[1:05:29] the problem is sin and corruption
[1:05:34] has eaten society from the inside
[1:05:39] it there will be no peace brother
[1:05:41] branham said till jesus comes
[1:05:43] and sets up a new kingdom in the
[1:05:45] millennium it'll be right here
[1:05:47] it'll be one world government oh amen to
[1:05:50] that i'm all for one world government as
[1:05:52] long as i got the right king on the
[1:05:53] throne
[1:05:55] see verse next slide verse 28
[1:05:59] and even as they did not like to retain
[1:06:02] god in their knowledge
[1:06:04] see they didn't want they didn't want to
[1:06:05] do that god god just keeps upping the
[1:06:08] ante they
[1:06:09] they keep moving god keeps responding
[1:06:12] god gave them over
[1:06:14] to a reprobate mind to do those
[1:06:18] things which are not convenient
[1:06:21] being filled watch now
[1:06:25] being filled with all unrighteousness
[1:06:28] fornication wickedness covetousness
[1:06:32] maliciousness full of envy murder
[1:06:36] debate deceit malignancy here's the
[1:06:39] governor's answer right here
[1:06:41] now the society is filled with this see
[1:06:45] whispers next slide verse 30
[1:06:48] back biters haters of god
[1:06:51] despiteful proud boasters
[1:06:55] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[1:06:58] parents
[1:06:59] i'm pretty sure that if anybody would
[1:07:02] read
[1:07:02] these passages honestly you wouldn't be
[1:07:05] asking the question what's wrong with
[1:07:07] the world
[1:07:10] because literally you're reading cause
[1:07:12] and effect
[1:07:14] cause and effect paul starts coming out
[1:07:16] of genesis
[1:07:17] they used to know god they made a
[1:07:19] decision they didn't really want him in
[1:07:20] their thinking so they
[1:07:21] they changed him they started worshiping
[1:07:23] the creation they didn't want god
[1:07:25] because they didn't want to be
[1:07:26] responsible to him
[1:07:27] now this is where they've ended up verse
[1:07:29] 32
[1:07:30] who knowing the judgment of god they're
[1:07:33] intelligent people
[1:07:35] that they which commit such things are
[1:07:37] worthy of death
[1:07:39] say that's a bold statement how does
[1:07:42] paul
[1:07:43] know that people feel that way why do
[1:07:45] you think we have the courts and people
[1:07:46] are in jail and people get executed
[1:07:48] because they know these things are wrong
[1:07:52] mankind's not stupid he knows that these
[1:07:55] things
[1:07:56] are wrong see and that's why we have
[1:08:00] penalty in the law who knowing the
[1:08:02] judgment of god that they which commit
[1:08:04] such things
[1:08:05] are worthy of death not only do the
[1:08:08] same but have pleasure in them
[1:08:12] that do them you've seen it
[1:08:16] i've seen it the more heinous
[1:08:19] twisted and perverted a music
[1:08:23] star is the more they celebrate him or
[1:08:26] her
[1:08:27] or them the more twisted
[1:08:30] perverted and heinous a movie star
[1:08:33] is they celebrate him or her

[1:09:33] anything to be proud of that is
[1:09:35] perversion and god
[1:09:37] is going to shake and rock and burn this
[1:09:40] world to the ground
[1:09:41] and start over in a righteous kingdom
[1:09:44] and i want to be a part of that kingdom
[1:09:47] we have come to the final season now we
[1:09:49] can make a conclusion next slide
[1:09:53] what can we conclude
[1:09:57] in this reading you know when when when
[1:10:01] i look around
[1:10:03] at the world i i find that i can
[1:10:06] conclude a number of things
[1:10:09] i can conclude with because now
[1:10:12] i see the days of noah
[1:10:16] yeah wow i see it
[1:10:19] the days of lot yes i see it
[1:10:22] what about all these backbiters and
[1:10:24] haters of god and despite from proud
[1:10:25] most inventors of people thinking
[1:10:26] it turns out natural understanding
[1:10:28] covenant breakers natural faction and
[1:10:29] black of blood and merciful
[1:10:30] yes i see that
[1:10:35] so what is your conclusion my conclusion
[1:10:39] is next slide that
[1:10:42] when they knew god they glorified him
[1:10:45] not as god i can conclude
[1:10:48] we have returned to this again
[1:10:54] the reason the world is the way it is
[1:10:58] is because this is currently present
[1:11:02] amen because that when they knew god
[1:11:06] they glorified him not as god let's just
[1:11:08] bring it super relevant you think
[1:11:10] that what god sent a prophet was done in
[1:11:12] a corner
[1:11:13] it went around the world seven times but
[1:11:16] whole books have been written about that
[1:11:17] ministry
[1:11:19] all talking about how it was the
[1:11:20] spearhead to the great revival that it
[1:11:22] was
[1:11:23] by far and above the most supernatural
[1:11:25] if all the other ones combined
[1:11:27] still wouldn't equal that ministry of
[1:11:28] william branham that's the testimony of
[1:11:30] historians i can't hear
[1:11:32] i can't help what bone dead idiots think
[1:11:34] about what they want to say about him
[1:11:36] i'm going by
[1:11:37] historical fact and and so
[1:11:40] his peers who actually lived in his day
[1:11:43] not people a half century later
[1:11:45] who think they know more about it that's
[1:11:47] profound that's the ebb of stupidity
[1:11:49] and i'm not sure which is dumber that
[1:11:51] they think that or that they think they
[1:11:53] can convince me to think that
[1:11:55] and i don't know which is dumber
[1:11:59] but i'm sorry that doesn't work for a
[1:12:01] student of history i go back and i get
[1:12:03] the people who are actually there
[1:12:05] who saw it and lived it and testified
[1:12:07] and wrote books about it
[1:12:09] see all right so but what we find is
[1:12:12] that when that was happening
[1:12:15] christianity pentecost
[1:12:17] the world politics
[1:12:20] the white house was represented in the
[1:12:24] film deep calleth to the deep oh yes
[1:12:28] the vice president states was attending
[1:12:30] that meeting and
[1:12:31] saw that gift of melchizedek saw that
[1:12:33] ministry of the son of man
[1:12:36] because that when they knew god they
[1:12:38] surely knew that was god
[1:12:41] they glorified him not as god neither
[1:12:43] were thankful but became
[1:12:44] vain in their imaginations and their
[1:12:46] foolish heart was
[1:12:48] darkened professing themselves
[1:12:52] to be wise they became
[1:12:55] fools professing themselves
[1:12:59] to be wise they became fools
[1:13:02] so i can conclude that that that
[1:13:06] that we can see today that mankind
[1:13:10] is manifesting the same things
[1:13:13] as in the days of noah and in the days
[1:13:16] of lot
[1:13:16] then i can conclude this is true now
[1:13:21] this whole cycle started again and
[1:13:24] that's why we are
[1:13:25] where we are governor newsome hear me
[1:13:28] this is why
[1:13:30] god sent a word that would have fixed it
[1:13:32] you rejected it
[1:13:33] now now that now you're dealing with the
[1:13:35] headlines you're dealing with
[1:13:37] i'm glad i'm not a part of this world
[1:13:39] i'm glad i'm a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:13:40] i'm not identified with it i'm
[1:13:42] identified i'm a citizen from another
[1:13:44] world
[1:13:45] i have my citizenship i'm living after
[1:13:48] the life of my rebirth
[1:13:51] hallelujah
[1:13:56] all of this happened all right you can
[1:13:58] take the powerpoint down
[1:14:01] all of that happened every dreadful
[1:14:06] descriptive term that paul used
[1:14:09] heady high-minded truth-breakers false
[1:14:11] accused incontinent fierce
[1:14:13] we talk about it yesterday in the men's
[1:14:14] meeting fierce
[1:14:17] and such murder and envy brother matt
[1:14:19] preaching on it today
[1:14:20] in the sunday school teaching on it in
[1:14:22] the sunday school
[1:14:24] and and and i i thought about this at
[1:14:27] home
[1:14:29] you know everything that paul wrote
[1:14:32] about
[1:14:33] that world we now have
[1:14:37] and do you realize that this all
[1:14:41] came where we are today i want this to
[1:14:44] sink in
[1:14:45] it all came under the watch
[1:14:49] of 266 popes
[1:14:54] today 1.2 billion catholics
[1:14:57] worldwide this all
[1:15:00] came under the watch of 2
[1:15:03] 000 years of church age reformers mainly
[1:15:07] since mainly as a since luther um
[1:15:11] and and and it has yielded today it has
[1:15:14] yielded today
[1:15:16] two billion non-catholic protestants
[1:15:22] and globally you ready for this
[1:15:26] ford a staggering 45
[1:15:30] 000 christian protestant denominations
[1:15:36] that's the latest from the center for
[1:15:38] the study of global christianity
[1:15:40] on life life science.com just to give
[1:15:43] you the reference
[1:15:45] we have arrived you've got a governor
[1:15:48] saying what is wrong
[1:15:49] and i just want to raise my hand and go
[1:15:51] do you realize
[1:15:52] that we have come to this under the
[1:15:55] watch of 266 popes
[1:15:58] 1.2 billion catholics 2 000 years of
[1:16:02] of church age reformers and protestant
[1:16:05] reformation
[1:16:06] since the days of luther to where we now
[1:16:08] have 2 billion protestants and 45
[1:16:11] 000 denominations
[1:16:14] we've arrived at where we are under all
[1:16:16] of that watch
[1:16:19] and then somebody want to tell me we
[1:16:21] didn't need a prophet
[1:16:24] somebody want to try to convince me that
[1:16:26] we didn't need the return of thus saith
[1:16:28] the lord
[1:16:30] hallelujah friends i'm glad for thus
[1:16:32] saith the lord in this hour
[1:16:34] where else would you turn where would
[1:16:37] you go
[1:16:38] 45 000 get in line take your choice
[1:16:42] people want to say oh you're called okay
[1:16:44] well who's the truth we are well get in
[1:16:46] line please there's 45 000
[1:16:48] of you just get in line hallelujah i
[1:16:50] don't plan to stand in that line i'm
[1:16:52] going to take thus saith the lord
[1:16:54] and they want to argue with william
[1:16:56] branham when he told them that the
[1:16:58] church
[1:16:58] is no longer the mouthpiece of god
[1:17:02] that she has become her own mouthpiece
[1:17:04] and that god through his prophet and his
[1:17:06] bride will confound her
[1:17:09] because she has thus saith the lord
[1:17:12] i'm glad for that she has thus saith the
[1:17:14] lord and she keeps still in other words
[1:17:16] we only preach
[1:17:17] what thus saith the lord taught i don't
[1:17:19] preach any mongrel eyes any mixed any
[1:17:22] credo any any none of that i have i only
[1:17:25] preached thus saith the lord or i don't
[1:17:28] preach
[1:17:32] and then you've got misguided people
[1:17:36] i firmly believe children of god but
[1:17:38] misguided to tell me
[1:17:39] i shouldn't even preach well how am i
[1:17:41] ever going to fulfill
[1:17:42] what he said if i'm not preaching
[1:17:46] if i if i'm only pushing play i push
[1:17:49] play i promise you i push play more than
[1:17:51] they do who say push play
[1:17:53] push play all the time i'm constantly
[1:17:56] pushing play
[1:17:57] i push it morning noon and night it
[1:17:59] plays in my house constantly plays in my
[1:18:01] truck it plays in my earbuds
[1:18:03] hallelujah i'm proud of what god did
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:07] but how am i ever going to fulfill to
[1:18:09] confound them
[1:18:11] he'll confound them through the
[1:18:12] messenger because the bride under her
[1:18:14] messenger is the final voice to the
[1:18:16] final age
[1:18:17] see so oh it's just so upside down
[1:18:22] and so yet under under the watch of all
[1:18:25] that
[1:18:26] we have come full circle
[1:18:30] back to the days of noah again
[1:18:34] we've come full circle i'm i'm
[1:18:37] sorry parents i i know this is bad news
[1:18:41] you're trying to raise
[1:18:42] children i'm sorry to report to you we
[1:18:45] have come full circle back to the days
[1:18:47] of sodom again
[1:18:50] back to the days where men's minds are
[1:18:52] evil continually oh moms and dads get
[1:18:55] full of the holy ghost
[1:18:57] hallelujah be filled with the spirit of
[1:18:59] god
[1:19:00] so that you can provide a straight and
[1:19:03] narrow
[1:19:04] way not just words but a life of words
[1:19:13] man-made religion
[1:19:16] has brought us right back to it again
[1:19:18] only worse now
[1:19:20] because convergence both of them see
[1:19:23] and then god will certainly do the same
[1:19:27] in judgment
[1:19:28] my goodness this world they think the
[1:19:30] anadoluvian world and sodom was a
[1:19:32] catastrophe
[1:19:34] i'm telling you he's going to purge his
[1:19:35] threshing floor one last time
[1:19:37] he's going to pour out wrath the likes
[1:19:39] of which the world has never seen the
[1:19:41] bible said
[1:19:42] there was never a day like it and never
[1:19:45] will be a day like it again
[1:19:46] thank god hallelujah
[1:19:53] so when we come then to our
[1:19:56] our promise to abraham
[1:20:00] it's very interesting because everything
[1:20:02] we're
[1:20:03] standing on today is based on what god
[1:20:06] promised this man
[1:20:08] we're sons and daughters of god we're
[1:20:10] children of abraham
[1:20:12] we've been enjoined by the blood of
[1:20:15] christ
[1:20:15] back through so there's neither jew or
[1:20:18] gentile bond nor free
[1:20:20] male or female we're all one in christ
[1:20:23] and we are
[1:20:24] joined to abraham who was the father of
[1:20:26] our faith
[1:20:28] and therefore every covenant promise
[1:20:30] that god made to abraham is now applying
[1:20:32] to us in fact
[1:20:33] is we're here to finish this thing
[1:20:37] you're the this is the final season
[1:20:40] this is harvest time see this is the age
[1:20:44] of the word and the word only
[1:20:46] see no no mongrelizing see say oh yeah
[1:20:50] it's just preaching and teaching no
[1:20:52] power well that's not the word
[1:20:54] the the word is filled with power the
[1:20:57] word is
[1:20:57] filled with signs and wonders the word
[1:20:59] the word operates the gifts properly and
[1:21:01] in order and decently
[1:21:03] you understand it's not doing away with
[1:21:04] any of those things it's finally
[1:21:06] reaching a point where
[1:21:07] we're operating them with maturity
[1:21:10] see and so so we find that abraham has
[1:21:13] given all of these
[1:21:15] promises these commitments by god and as
[1:21:17] i said to you
[1:21:19] what abraham was told to do
[1:21:22] i mean you he he might as well not even
[1:21:25] get out of bed
[1:21:26] walk before me and be perfect i might as
[1:21:28] well not even step to the i'll
[1:21:29] still stay in the dugout i'm not even
[1:21:31] going to go to the batter's box much
[1:21:33] less step up to the plate
[1:21:34] that's hopeless really abraham listen
[1:21:37] listen abraham i'm going to be the one
[1:21:39] doing it god was saying
[1:21:41] i'm going to make a covenant with you
[1:21:43] and i'm going to make you the father of
[1:21:44] nations and i'm going to make kings come
[1:21:45] out of you
[1:21:46] don't worry abraham i got this and
[1:21:48] abraham
[1:21:49] the best that abraham can do is he
[1:21:52] thinks it's funny
[1:21:54] not funny like you're listening to a
[1:21:56] comedian but
[1:21:57] it's it's so astonishing that it's
[1:22:00] ridiculous to him
[1:22:04] everything you're saying i get it i hear
[1:22:06] what you're saying lord
[1:22:07] i get it i understand what you're saying
[1:22:10] but i i don't think you really know me
[1:22:16] if you honestly think that i can be
[1:22:18] perfect and walk before you perfectly
[1:22:20] and you know what he says now here's the
[1:22:22] promise
[1:22:24] it's going to be through isaac and
[1:22:26] abraham and it's going to come through
[1:22:27] sarah and abraham's already waited so
[1:22:30] long and he
[1:22:31] took a detour and he's got ishmael and
[1:22:34] and the bible
[1:22:36] makes a difference and i'm going to turn
[1:22:37] to and read it today just let me give
[1:22:38] you this in the new testament
[1:22:40] i can't remember where it is but we can
[1:22:42] find it
[1:22:43] but the bible describes how that
[1:22:46] isaac is the child of the promise
[1:22:50] but that ishmael is the child
[1:22:54] of of his flesh in other words his
[1:22:56] desires
[1:22:58] you understand you've got all kinds of
[1:22:59] things in your life
[1:23:01] that are a result of you following your
[1:23:03] desires i'm here to tell you god can't
[1:23:04] use any of them
[1:23:07] he's got a he or he can only use what
[1:23:09] his word produces in you
[1:23:11] see and so abraham is now
[1:23:14] pleading you know oh that ishmael
[1:23:18] might live before me so abraham is
[1:23:21] literally
[1:23:22] asking you know he's asking
[1:23:25] that that god allow the best efforts
[1:23:29] of his human flesh to be enough
[1:23:32] how about that lord i know you want me
[1:23:35] to be perfect and walk before you but
[1:23:37] what you're saying is so the world is so
[1:23:41] bad and i got so many
[1:23:42] problems and i was raised this way and i
[1:23:44] was born this way and
[1:23:46] this happened to me when i was a child
[1:23:47] and this preacher did this and this
[1:23:49] spouse did this and do you have any idea
[1:23:51] what i've been through come on does that
[1:23:52] sound familiar
[1:23:54] and i got this weakness and i got this
[1:23:56] from how about this please
[1:23:58] can i can i just give you my best human
[1:24:01] effort and we're just call
[1:24:02] it done that's what he's asking
[1:24:06] he's asking that the child of his
[1:24:07] desires of his flesh be the
[1:24:10] let the promise follow him
[1:24:13] and so god is showing god comes right
[1:24:16] back and says
[1:24:18] absolutely no sarah
[1:24:22] shall bear thee a son indeed and my
[1:24:26] covenant would be with him
[1:24:28] and then god just finally the bible says
[1:24:29] and god just left talking to him he
[1:24:31] didn't even wait for abraham to reply
[1:24:33] again
[1:24:33] god's already know god already knows
[1:24:35] what he's going to do with me and nobody
[1:24:37] knows what he's going to do with you
[1:24:38] and i don't need him to explain
[1:24:39] everything to me i just say lord
[1:24:41] take over my life
[1:24:46] we find friends that abraham
[1:24:49] here is asking that his best efforts of
[1:24:52] human flesh be enough but
[1:24:54] revelation 12 shows us that that's not
[1:24:57] what god is aiming at
[1:25:01] god is not aiming at that i don't have
[1:25:03] time to read it today but
[1:25:05] go through revelation 12 today but if
[1:25:07] you if you'll go
[1:25:08] there when you get home you'll find that
[1:25:12] it talks about there's war in heaven
[1:25:15] now you can't read revelation like a
[1:25:17] newspaper it doesn't chronologically
[1:25:18] work like that
[1:25:20] you don't even you don't even read an
[1:25:21] event and say this
[1:25:23] and then this and then this and then
[1:25:26] this because that's not how it happens
[1:25:28] what you have to do when you're reading
[1:25:29] the book of revelation is go
[1:25:30] this meanwhile this was happening
[1:25:33] meanwhile
[1:25:34] this was also happening meanwhile this
[1:25:37] was also happening
[1:25:38] and it was all working in one harmonious
[1:25:41] thing
[1:25:41] and god was working it all down through
[1:25:43] history plugging in the pieces of where
[1:25:45] it needed to go
[1:25:46] so that when you go through the seals
[1:25:49] and you pick up the seals in chapter six
[1:25:51] and chapter seven
[1:25:53] and then you you come to to a silence in
[1:25:55] chapter eight and the seventh seal and
[1:25:57] then you go to the trumpets and here's
[1:25:58] the seven trumpets it almost looks like
[1:26:00] god's gonna go see a one two three four
[1:26:02] five six seven
[1:26:03] and then we're gonna start on the
[1:26:04] trumpets but you found out
[1:26:06] that when the seals got open we found
[1:26:08] out oh no meanwhile
[1:26:10] the trumpets were happening and god's
[1:26:13] been running the gentiles and the jews
[1:26:15] through the same gauntlet coming to the
[1:26:17] same thing at the same time
[1:26:20] you get that so he says
[1:26:24] war was in heaven michael and his angels
[1:26:28] remember fought against lucifer and
[1:26:30] michael overcame and lucifer was cast
[1:26:32] out
[1:26:32] that almost sounds like revelation 12
[1:26:35] after the rapture that must happen in
[1:26:36] the tribulation no
[1:26:38] that happened all the way back before
[1:26:39] genesis even built the earth
[1:26:42] there was war in heaven it only spilled
[1:26:44] over into the earth
[1:26:45] that war in revelation 12
[1:26:49] is is still being fought paul
[1:26:52] identified it and said you're not
[1:26:54] fighting against flesh and blood
[1:26:56] that's the same battle you're fighting
[1:26:58] against principalities and powers of the
[1:27:00] air and powers of wickedness and
[1:27:01] darkness in high places
[1:27:03] that's the battle that war is going on
[1:27:05] right now
[1:27:08] but if you go into revelation 12 you
[1:27:11] find out that
[1:27:12] that at that god comes to a point where
[1:27:15] finally in revelation four and
[1:27:17] show this to be true zechariah 3 i don't
[1:27:19] have time to preach on all that today
[1:27:21] but we find out that that satan is cast
[1:27:24] down
[1:27:24] i think in verse 10 i believe 10 or 11.
[1:27:28] and now he's not cast to the earth yet
[1:27:31] that don't happen for two more verses in
[1:27:32] chapter in verse 13.
[1:27:34] he's cast to the earth and then because
[1:27:37] the bride went up
[1:27:38] and when the bride went physically up
[1:27:40] satan was physically cast down
[1:27:42] but two or three verses ahead of that
[1:27:45] he's already
[1:27:46] been cast down not cast into the earth
[1:27:48] but removed from his position as an
[1:27:50] antagonizer
[1:27:52] to accuse you before god or to
[1:27:54] discourage you
[1:27:55] to tell you you're not going to be
[1:27:57] successful you're not perfect
[1:27:59] to try to bring guilt about all your
[1:28:01] life and
[1:28:02] and discourage you but this bride has
[1:28:04] already been
[1:28:05] insulated by predestination she can't be
[1:28:07] deceived
[1:28:08] and no amount of guilt trip from the
[1:28:10] devil
[1:28:11] can get me to stop fighting
[1:28:14] i can't be deceived i might get mixed up
[1:28:17] in my doctrine
[1:28:18] but i'm going to keep marching and god
[1:28:20] will straighten me out
[1:28:23] why because zechariah 3 revelation 5 you
[1:28:26] don't see the accuser there in zechariah
[1:28:28] 3 he is judicially dismissed
[1:28:30] his case is thrown out and he's ran out
[1:28:32] of the courtroom forever
[1:28:34] satan has literally lost his position to
[1:28:36] accuse you before god
[1:28:38] he's working on redemption and in
[1:28:40] redemption he's not dealing with sin
[1:28:42] because you're already perfect
[1:28:45] hallelujah you're already the
[1:28:48] spotless chaste virgin pride of the word
[1:28:51] why because you have believed the report
[1:28:54] glory to god that's why
[1:28:57] chapters four and five aren't action
[1:28:59] chapters they're they're
[1:29:00] they're they're the setting of judgment
[1:29:02] they're preparing for the seals to be
[1:29:04] opened
[1:29:05] amen and you don't see lucifer there you
[1:29:08] see john
[1:29:09] representing the bride you see a strong
[1:29:11] angel representing
[1:29:12] elijah this day you see you see one seat
[1:29:14] on the throne
[1:29:16] just like in zechariah 3 just like in
[1:29:18] daniel 7 daniel 9
[1:29:19] ancient of days and and you find
[1:29:23] zerubbabel the high priest or joshua the
[1:29:25] high priest representing all of god's
[1:29:27] elected family
[1:29:28] and the accusation is true it's legit
[1:29:30] israel was sinning
[1:29:32] it was true and god dismissed it all
[1:29:34] didn't matter
[1:29:36] on what authority did god dismiss it
[1:29:38] election
[1:29:39] he said this is jerusalem this is zion
[1:29:41] this is my bride whom i have chosen
[1:29:43] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:29:45] to them which are in christ
[1:29:47] calvary fixed that this opening of the
[1:29:49] seals is what brought that back to you
[1:29:51] and me
[1:29:52] hallelujah we stand today perfect we
[1:29:55] stand
[1:29:55] i don't need god to accept a half deal
[1:29:58] of my best human effort all i have to do
[1:30:01] is surrender my heart
[1:30:02] and receive the baptism of the holy
[1:30:04] ghost and then the blood speaks for me
[1:30:06] and a power greater than my life
[1:30:09] controls my life
[1:30:13] this is what he did when he unsealed the
[1:30:16] word
[1:30:17] which then unsealed you no one knew you
[1:30:20] were there
[1:30:21] you didn't know you were there when he
[1:30:24] unsealed
[1:30:26] when he became the mighty god unveiled
[1:30:28] suddenly we realized wow
[1:30:30] he wasn't three and neither was he won
[1:30:33] like your finger
[1:30:34] because that doesn't speak of his body i
[1:30:37] realize now that he has a body who's
[1:30:39] part of god's godhead
[1:30:42] because it's all by extension all by
[1:30:44] expression god just expressing himself
[1:30:46] down through each age
[1:30:48] not beautiful and so
[1:30:51] so we find then that he's been cast down
[1:30:56] he's been removed from his position to
[1:30:58] bring accusations and
[1:31:00] condemnations condemnation to the
[1:31:03] to to those of who have been redeemed by
[1:31:06] the lamb
[1:31:07] lost his position aren't you glad and
[1:31:10] then afterwards the brightest
[1:31:11] comes to her fullness of adoption body
[1:31:13] change she goes up
[1:31:15] and in verse 13 then satan is cast unto
[1:31:18] the earth
[1:31:19] see and so in this cycle literally
[1:31:22] of shout voice and trumpet the lamb has
[1:31:25] literally claimed the book and he's
[1:31:26] unsealed the word
[1:31:28] and that's what we're feeding on today
[1:31:30] not the body of a man
[1:31:32] the body word or the son of man see
[1:31:36] and so meanwhile meanwhile
[1:31:40] while all of that's going on and
[1:31:42] happening in real time
[1:31:44] and has happened in our lifetime amen
[1:31:47] i mean look at look at the connection of
[1:31:50] history of god
[1:31:51] we've got humans in this building
[1:31:56] who were alive and there when a
[1:31:59] seals were opened and now we've got
[1:32:02] their offspring and their offspring's
[1:32:04] offspring and their offspring's
[1:32:06] offspring offspring
[1:32:08] and here we are with this connected
[1:32:10] bridge of god's elected family at the
[1:32:12] end time
[1:32:13] all getting all going through the final
[1:32:14] stages of perfection
[1:32:16] all being those final elements of of of
[1:32:19] maturing
[1:32:20] those last names calling out of the book
[1:32:22] of life around the world
[1:32:23] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:32:25] we're getting out of here soon
[1:32:28] we're getting out of here soon the
[1:32:29] generation that saw that can't fully
[1:32:31] pass away till
[1:32:32] all things be fulfilled
[1:32:36] so the last names then are
[1:32:40] are being called to the marriage feast
[1:32:42] and while this is happening
[1:32:44] the world systems of fallen men are
[1:32:46] crumbling and you see it every day
[1:32:48] his systems of government science
[1:32:52] education politics all falling epically
[1:32:57] all falling and failing at
[1:33:01] at unprecedented the madness is is not
[1:33:04] only indescribable but completely
[1:33:06] unexplainable
[1:33:07] unexplainable and so we find then
[1:33:12] that society literally is unraveling
[1:33:15] we see it in the headlines every day and
[1:33:18] so
[1:33:19] so so so this is the time
[1:33:22] you see now you've got hebrews 9
[1:33:26] coming into play which says that
[1:33:29] referring here in verse 28 so christ was
[1:33:33] once offered to bear the sins of many
[1:33:36] see and at calvary and unto them
[1:33:39] that look for him shall he appear
[1:33:42] remember paul said i those not
[1:33:46] there's a great crown of life for not
[1:33:47] only me only but for all those who love
[1:33:49] his appearing
[1:33:51] amen remember i told you how that that
[1:33:54] you're to look for a special grace and a
[1:33:56] wisdom
[1:33:57] at at the appearing of christ at the end
[1:33:59] time
[1:34:00] at the revelation of jesus christ
[1:34:03] brother branham said in in i think in
[1:34:04] easter seal
[1:34:05] he said a seal has something bound up
[1:34:07] inside
[1:34:08] and when you break the seal it releases
[1:34:11] what's inside
[1:34:13] and then and when it when it got broken
[1:34:15] we found out it was a person it was
[1:34:17] christ and it was the
[1:34:18] word and then the word was fed to the
[1:34:20] people and then brother branham says
[1:34:22] then
[1:34:22] down comes an anointing to fall upon
[1:34:25] that word
[1:34:26] and make it live in your life and in my
[1:34:29] life
[1:34:30] hallelujah that's why we keep pressing
[1:34:32] on that's why we won't quit
[1:34:34] that's why when i fail i get back up
[1:34:36] again that's why i won't stop
[1:34:39] hallelujah and so so but he says here
[1:34:43] he offered he was once offered to bear
[1:34:46] the sins of many and unto them that look
[1:34:48] for him
[1:34:49] shall he appear the second time
[1:34:52] the second time without sin unto
[1:34:55] salvation
[1:34:56] see now jesus
[1:35:00] has always been without sin
[1:35:03] so what do you mean he's going to appear
[1:35:05] the second time without sin unto
[1:35:07] salvation jesus has always been without
[1:35:10] sin
[1:35:11] so it's more a reference now to his
[1:35:13] purchased possession
[1:35:14] he appears in her he appears in you
[1:35:19] without sin by a perfect faith
[1:35:22] and a perfect god perfect god who gave a
[1:35:25] perfect word keeping a perfect promise
[1:35:27] to bring forth a perfect people you
[1:35:30] understand why satan has no
[1:35:32] chance to stop you
[1:35:35] do you realize that that it's that it's
[1:35:38] inexorably
[1:35:39] the right you're you're headed to a
[1:35:41] rapture inexorably there's nothing that
[1:35:43] can stop it there's nothing that can
[1:35:45] change it
[1:35:46] anything satan can think of god's
[1:35:48] already ran ahead and
[1:35:49] fixed it hallelujah
[1:35:53] and so she stands perfect the bleeding
[1:35:56] word
[1:35:57] speaking for her she stands brother
[1:35:59] branham said is the spotless perfection
[1:36:01] of christ
[1:36:02] we see that in revelation 11 1 she
[1:36:04] becomes the her last visible sign in the
[1:36:07] earth before she's taken
[1:36:08] she's literally the measurable
[1:36:10] perfection of his tabernacle she is him
[1:36:12] brother brandon would say see so
[1:36:16] you know let me let me let me change
[1:36:19] gears
[1:36:20] okay this isn't just a bible study

[1:36:34] sufficiently
[1:36:36] that you get it you go wow
[1:36:39] we really are in a unique epic moment
[1:36:43] of history and meanwhile
[1:36:46] while god is doing all this meanwhile
[1:36:48] the world is falling apart meanwhile
[1:36:49] satan's being exalted as the god
[1:36:52] meanwhile a bride is being called names
[1:36:53] are being called bride has been called
[1:36:55] to a feast she's being perfected
[1:36:56] last elements of perfection do you hear

[1:37:32] well if you recognize all this friends
[1:37:35] and if you hear today recognize the
[1:37:38] intent of god

[1:37:44] chance god is going to let you get by
[1:37:48] with just your best human effort
[1:37:50] amen surely
[1:37:54] you get that don't doze on me i'm in a
[1:37:57] high gear here don't
[1:37:58] fall asleep amen
[1:38:02] i i i'd like to say that as as an
[1:38:06] instruction to parents
[1:38:07] i'd like to see you put your children to
[1:38:09] sleep
[1:38:10] at a decent hour on saturdays so they
[1:38:13] don't sleep on me
[1:38:14] on sunday and so that i don't walk out
[1:38:17] on the platform and look out in their
[1:38:19] faces
[1:38:19] and see that they barely have their eyes
[1:38:21] opened
[1:38:23] could we have that parents could you
[1:38:25] have a little more discipline in your
[1:38:27] homes and actually be a parent
[1:38:30] and not just a breadwinner all right
[1:38:33] so surely today friends
[1:38:37] we can see now i'm coming to the real
[1:38:39] heart
[1:38:40] of what god really burdened me on all
[1:38:43] right
[1:38:44] you can surely see that there is no
[1:38:47] chance
[1:38:48] that god is going to leave you to your
[1:38:51] best human effort
[1:38:56] this is the life everything i've
[1:38:59] preached
[1:39:00] about today is god's design
[1:39:04] for us not catch it
[1:39:08] not living in the desires and pleasure
[1:39:11] of our humanity
[1:39:14] this is what abraham was pleading oh
[1:39:18] could i just could could we just call it
[1:39:21] my best
[1:39:21] effort could you just let ishmael who's
[1:39:24] already here
[1:39:26] he's already a grown boy how about you
[1:39:28] just take it with him
[1:39:29] please can we just what you're saying is
[1:39:32] too hard
[1:39:33] i'm overwhelmed just hearing you say
[1:39:35] with the requirements
[1:39:38] can can i please just do my best and
[1:39:40] we'll just call it a deal
[1:39:44] see
[1:39:48] so he god is not willing
[1:39:51] to allow us to just live in the desires
[1:39:54] and pleasure of our humanity
[1:39:56] if you look at i don't have time to go
[1:39:58] into it today but if you look if you go
[1:39:59] to jeremiah 23
[1:40:01] you you find the name of god and it
[1:40:04] gives him an
[1:40:04] actual name he shall be called the lord
[1:40:07] our righteousness
[1:40:09] if you just go ten chapters later by the
[1:40:11] time he gets finished with his family
[1:40:13] now the bible says she in verse chapter
[1:40:16] 33
[1:40:16] she shall be called the lord our
[1:40:19] righteousness
[1:40:21] did you know that you see so there's
[1:40:23] this process
[1:40:24] god is not just willing to to to just be
[1:40:27] god alone
[1:40:28] his whole plan was to have a family
[1:40:32] who are modeled after the word see
[1:40:35] and so the anointing on god's family in
[1:40:38] every age
[1:40:39] then is to return us to genesis and in
[1:40:42] genesis you had
[1:40:44] you had a man and a woman who were
[1:40:47] so perfectly in harmony he called
[1:40:51] their plural their name
[1:40:54] singular adam and
[1:40:57] even when she was expressed out of him
[1:41:00] him and her had such a relationship
[1:41:03] toward each other
[1:41:04] it was flawless and in that flawless
[1:41:07] relationship
[1:41:08] they enjoyed a perfect fellowship with
[1:41:11] the father
[1:41:13] and you understand he's not interested
[1:41:15] in you with your best human
[1:41:18] desires he's interested in bringing back
[1:41:21] that relationship that fellowship that
[1:41:24] we
[1:41:25] that he had with us before the
[1:41:26] foundation of the world
[1:41:28] sin interrupted it but god started
[1:41:31] working immediately to restore it all
[1:41:33] back
[1:41:34] see a process he started a process
[1:41:38] and what is the process doing it's
[1:41:40] expanding
[1:41:41] our character not just our understanding
[1:41:44] of the word
[1:41:45] he gives you the word he wants you to
[1:41:48] arrive at revelation 12.
[1:41:51] and to get there he's going to put you
[1:41:53] through the paces
[1:41:54] to where you're just like him and you're
[1:41:57] not going to be able to plead abraham's
[1:41:59] plea
[1:42:00] let me just let the best efforts of my
[1:42:03] human frailty be enough
[1:42:04] no it's not going to it's not about good
[1:42:08] works and how many good works you can do
[1:42:10] or how many how good you can be on
[1:42:12] sunday it's not about that
[1:42:13] you're gonna he's trying to get you to a
[1:42:16] relationship
[1:42:18] see
[1:42:21] brother branham says in the masterpiece
[1:42:23] the great sculptor
[1:42:24] when he's seen his family the
[1:42:26] masterpiece he wasn't willing
[1:42:28] just to leave it lay there face down and
[1:42:30] ruin he went to work immediately to
[1:42:31] build it up again
[1:42:32] he wasn't willing that it should perish
[1:42:34] lay there like that all the time because
[1:42:36] because he's god and he will not be
[1:42:39] defeated
[1:42:40] so he went to work immediately to begin
[1:42:42] to build it again
[1:42:43] unto his own image of man amen
[1:42:47] see this is why friends angels will
[1:42:50] never be able to sing redemption song
[1:42:53] with you
[1:42:55] because they weren't lost and redeemed
[1:42:57] you come lost and god has redeemed you
[1:42:59] back to god through christ
[1:43:01] and he's growing your life into the
[1:43:03] image of the word
[1:43:06] there's got to be such a similarity of
[1:43:08] of it
[1:43:09] like like brother branham says elijah
[1:43:11] and elisha
[1:43:12] says their names even sound almost the
[1:43:16] same
[1:43:16] elijah elisha and if you
[1:43:19] if you look elisha had to follow him
[1:43:23] and when he when elijah was taken home
[1:43:26] elijah said
[1:43:28] ask what you will and he says elijah
[1:43:30] says ask what i'll do for you he says
[1:43:31] that uh that your life will be
[1:43:34] duplicated in me
[1:43:35] i wanna i want your life doubled so that
[1:43:38] it can come on me
[1:43:39] see i want to have just what you got the
[1:43:42] anointing on you
[1:43:43] i want to have that anointing on me a
[1:43:45] double portion
[1:43:46] your your anointing doubled amen re you
[1:43:50] copied and put in paste it into me all
[1:43:52] right you get me
[1:43:53] so so he he's not he's not asking to
[1:43:56] have you know twice your
[1:43:58] godliness twice your power twice your
[1:44:00] office twice your anointing
[1:44:01] he's asking for everything you've got i
[1:44:04] want to be i want to have that
[1:44:05] and that's the model of christ and his
[1:44:06] bride we're not trying to be greater
[1:44:09] than christ
[1:44:10] you understand we're trying to be the
[1:44:12] same as christ
[1:44:13] so with jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:44:16] today and forever
[1:44:17] amen we're not trying to put emphasis on
[1:44:19] the bride at the expense of the groom
[1:44:22] if it wasn't for the groom the bride
[1:44:24] wouldn't stand a chance
[1:44:26] understand but since the groom was
[1:44:28] successful now he's working on the bride
[1:44:32] and he just need to say today lord keep
[1:44:34] working
[1:44:35] keep working don't let me lay back in my
[1:44:38] best human effort lord
[1:44:40] you're that that's not a deal you're not
[1:44:42] interested in that that's not what you
[1:44:43] had in mind in revelation 12.
[1:44:46] see and so elisha would have to struggle
[1:44:50] during his journey to immortality to
[1:44:54] gain the spirit of elijah he would have
[1:44:55] to come to a greater surrender
[1:44:57] personally
[1:44:59] and that's where you are today that you
[1:45:01] know that
[1:45:02] that's only by that could he perform the
[1:45:04] same sign that
[1:45:06] elijah elijah's greatest thing that he
[1:45:08] ever did was open the jordan
[1:45:10] because the jordan represents death and
[1:45:13] it represented crossing over from this
[1:45:14] side through death
[1:45:15] into the next side and into the promised
[1:45:17] land that's why
[1:45:18] joshua led them across the jordan amen
[1:45:21] because the jordan is death and then you
[1:45:23] go into the land of the holy ghost the
[1:45:24] promised land
[1:45:25] you follow me and salvation is the
[1:45:27] greatest thing god could ever do for you
[1:45:29] give you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:32] amen once you do that then then
[1:45:34] then the fix is in then it's just god
[1:45:35] working on your maturity
[1:45:38] and so when it but when elisha
[1:45:41] comes back to the jordan now he's got
[1:45:43] the mantle
[1:45:45] it fell on him he's he's there's plenty
[1:45:48] of
[1:45:48] anointing there plenty of power he's
[1:45:51] definitely got the calling
[1:45:53] all right and you know what he does he
[1:45:55] takes the mantle
[1:45:56] folds it brother brandon said he folds
[1:45:57] it just like elijah did
[1:45:59] he's trying to copy you know elijah
[1:46:02] you know i'll just i'll have the same
[1:46:04] belt buckle
[1:46:05] and i'll drive the same kind of car and
[1:46:07] i'll have a briefcase just like it
[1:46:09] and uh and i'll i'll memorize quotes
[1:46:14] but you know what he couldn't open the
[1:46:16] jordan doing that he folded it just like
[1:46:18] elijah and struck it and
[1:46:20] nothing happened see brother branham
[1:46:23] talked about he had
[1:46:24] he had elijah's robe and he brother
[1:46:27] branham in the second and second-handed
[1:46:28] robe he talks about how that's a good
[1:46:30] robe christ
[1:46:31] that that that was what christ had so
[1:46:33] what christ gives us we
[1:46:35] that's the second handed robe is a good
[1:46:37] robe see
[1:46:38] elijah elisha had a good robe
[1:46:41] he had a a perfect second-handed robe
[1:46:44] but what he was missing was a first-hand
[1:46:47] experience
[1:46:50] see he didn't have the same experience
[1:46:51] as elijah he had his robe
[1:46:54] he had his there's plenty of anointing
[1:46:56] but he didn't have
[1:46:57] brother branham says it like this and
[1:46:59] witness the message witness
[1:47:01] jesus talking to his disciples you're
[1:47:03] okay today
[1:47:04] stay with me now come on y'all owe me i
[1:47:07] don't preach long so if i go a little
[1:47:08] bit today just stay with me
[1:47:10] i don't wear you out come on do i all
[1:47:13] right now stay with me
[1:47:15] so so we finally says here in witness
[1:47:17] when jesus
[1:47:18] is saying his disciples remember you're
[1:47:20] going to go in wait 10 days being dude
[1:47:21] with power
[1:47:22] he's on the mountain he says now he
[1:47:24] didn't say
[1:47:26] i want you to go now and be my witness
[1:47:30] all right watch he said
[1:47:34] he didn't say he didn't say i want you
[1:47:37] to go now
[1:47:38] and be my witness he said
[1:47:41] you shall receive power after
[1:47:44] the holy ghost has come upon you and
[1:47:47] then
[1:47:48] shall you be witness
[1:47:51] see you must have a first-hand
[1:47:55] experience
[1:47:57] if i go down here to the worst road
[1:47:59] house or the whiskey house
[1:48:01] or in phoenix tonight i love this
[1:48:04] kentucky word
[1:48:05] gambling divisities okay
[1:48:09] and every person in there that would be
[1:48:12] drinking
[1:48:12] and i'd walk up to him and say what do
[1:48:14] you think of christ
[1:48:16] and he would say oh he's the son of god
[1:48:19] brother branham says that don't make him
[1:48:20] saved
[1:48:23] it'll make him saved you hear me
[1:48:25] teenagers
[1:48:26] you hear me i don't make him saved see
[1:48:29] watch
[1:48:30] then i'd say how do you know he's the
[1:48:32] son of god he'd say
[1:48:33] well my mother told me so well
[1:48:36] maybe mother was right but what about
[1:48:40] you
[1:48:41] see if i went out here to a church
[1:48:44] member
[1:48:45] and i said what do you think of jesus
[1:48:47] christ who was he
[1:48:48] oh he was the son of god how do you know
[1:48:52] my pastor said so your pastor's right
[1:48:56] but what do you know about it see
[1:48:59] mother's right pastor's right but before
[1:49:02] you know he's the son of god the bible
[1:49:04] said
[1:49:05] no man can say jesus is the christ only
[1:49:08] by the holy ghost
[1:49:09] the holy ghost has to witness it to you
[1:49:11] it must be a personal experience
[1:49:14] he says i hope you see that i'm saying
[1:49:16] that today i hope you see that
[1:49:18] see no matter how much listen
[1:49:22] no matter how much you go to church
[1:49:26] how well your name is engraved on its
[1:49:29] stained windows or what more
[1:49:31] or on its book it'll never mean
[1:49:35] nothing to you until you
[1:49:38] are a witness of the resurrection of
[1:49:40] jesus christ
[1:49:42] by the infilling of the power of the
[1:49:45] holy spirit
[1:49:46] you're taking somebody else's word for
[1:49:49] it amen
[1:49:50] well brother branham i know that jesus
[1:49:53] is the christ because the bible said so
[1:49:56] the bible's right but what do you know
[1:49:58] about it
[1:50:00] it's an individual affair
[1:50:03] with every individual it must if i say
[1:50:07] must it must be a
[1:50:10] personal witness that every person
[1:50:14] must have in order to know that
[1:50:17] jesus christ is the son of god is when
[1:50:20] his spirit
[1:50:22] bears record with your spirit in an
[1:50:25] experience of the new birth
[1:50:27] born again and then you cry abba father
[1:50:32] amen a personal
[1:50:35] experience that that it's a revelation
[1:50:40] of jesus christ personally to you
[1:50:44] and if he reveals
[1:50:47] himself to you and you
[1:50:51] catch who he is and you still
[1:50:54] want to be you
[1:50:57] you you need a psychiatrist you need you
[1:51:00] need prayer
[1:51:01] you need something you're just abraham
[1:51:05] saying oh let ishmael come on let
[1:51:08] ishmael be the one
[1:51:09] but that's not what he's after he's
[1:51:11] after mr and mrs jesus christ he's after

[1:51:28] israel's restoration
[1:51:30] there's a bride seated on the throne in
[1:51:32] an invisible union
[1:51:33] saying the same thing he's saying

[1:52:48] many angels round about the throne now i
[1:52:51] want you to catch
[1:52:53] these three elements angels
[1:52:57] around the throne and beast
[1:53:00] and elders and the number of them was
[1:53:03] ten thousand times ten thousand and
[1:53:04] thousands of thousands
[1:53:06] saying with a loud voice verse 12 saying
[1:53:09] with a loud voice
[1:53:11] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[1:53:13] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[1:53:15] strength and honor and glory and
[1:53:16] blessing
[1:53:17] and every creature which is in heaven
[1:53:20] and on earth
[1:53:21] and under the earth and such as are in
[1:53:23] the sea
[1:53:24] and all that are in them heard i saying
[1:53:28] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:53:30] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[1:53:32] and unto the lamb forever and ever and
[1:53:35] the four beasts said amen
[1:53:36] and the four and twenty elders fell down
[1:53:38] and worshiped him that liveth forever
[1:53:40] and ever now here is a tremendous
[1:53:43] confederation
[1:53:45] here you've got you've got this
[1:53:47] confederation of angels
[1:53:50] of agents that have worked in tandem
[1:53:53] to achieve this scene you're seeing see
[1:53:56] so to bring john to this place
[1:54:00] that john has been caught to to bring
[1:54:03] him to this place
[1:54:04] was a culmination of a lifetime of
[1:54:07] growth
[1:54:09] all right a lifetime of purpose
[1:54:12] and at times you know being led
[1:54:15] uh by these various agents are being
[1:54:17] driven by them depending on one's
[1:54:19] willingness to be led
[1:54:22] amen you can either be driven cattle or
[1:54:25] lead sheep
[1:54:27] but he's not going to lose one amen
[1:54:30] so let me say it today depending on
[1:54:33] whether you're willing to be a sheep and
[1:54:34] be led if you're not then he'll
[1:54:36] drive you like cattle but he's not going
[1:54:38] to lose one
[1:54:40] and here we find that angels now brother
[1:54:42] branham talks about angels that
[1:54:44] accompanies through life we learn from
[1:54:45] the sunday school
[1:54:46] we call them oh our guardian angel
[1:54:48] brother branham talks about that's real
[1:54:50] and he said they're actually assigned to
[1:54:52] you
[1:54:53] and he said they don't go back home amen
[1:54:57] they don't go back home they stay with
[1:55:00] you through life to help you on your
[1:55:02] journey
[1:55:03] brother joe they'll be with you don't
[1:55:04] worry you'll be surrounded by
[1:55:06] see they they rode on in your car and on
[1:55:09] the hood
[1:55:09] i hope you weren't going too fast they
[1:55:12] came with you to church they walked in
[1:55:14] here with you
[1:55:15] they'll leave with you they go with you
[1:55:17] everywhere you see
[1:55:19] and so you have this confederation of
[1:55:22] agents
[1:55:23] and then you have these beast powers
[1:55:25] beasts are anointing just like i was
[1:55:27] talking about
[1:55:28] the unsealed word then an anointing
[1:55:30] drops down remember the anointing
[1:55:32] on the babylonians on the persians on
[1:55:34] the grecians
[1:55:35] on the romans it meant they were
[1:55:37] undefeatable in army because why they
[1:55:39] they they were anointed alexander's no
[1:55:42] way with a fraction of his men
[1:55:43] fraction of the men that the persians
[1:55:45] had no way for him to be successful
[1:55:47] but he wasn't just successful he was
[1:55:48] wildly successful
[1:55:50] why because he was anointed he couldn't
[1:55:51] be defeated the bible had already said
[1:55:53] the goat tramples the ram and then the
[1:55:56] beast with iron teeth broke his horn and
[1:55:58] trampled him a man drove
[1:56:00] northwest east and south no one could
[1:56:02] stand before him and that fourth
[1:56:04] power stayed all the way to today and it
[1:56:07] went from political rome to
[1:56:08] to religious rome which is far has far
[1:56:11] more control and influence over the
[1:56:12] world now than it ever did
[1:56:14] with its armies now it uses our armies
[1:56:17] amen it sure does and so so we find
[1:56:20] these beast powers these anointings
[1:56:23] and then you've got these theophanies
[1:56:24] these elders one of them actually spoke
[1:56:26] to john
[1:56:27] i said don't cry john the the lion it's
[1:56:30] all going to be okay
[1:56:31] how do you know cause i john you're
[1:56:33] you're actually
[1:56:34] on an island in in patmos you've only
[1:56:37] been caught up here in the spirit we're
[1:56:38] you're actually seeing the end
[1:56:40] i'm standing here at the end you're
[1:56:42] actually brought up here
[1:56:44] in a spiritual vision and you're
[1:56:45] watching the end trust me
[1:56:47] i'm at the end i know we win so stop
[1:56:50] crying it's gonna be okay
[1:56:52] the lamb the lamb what he did at calvary
[1:56:54] remember you saw that don't worry he
[1:56:56] prevailed
[1:56:57] and when he started to see a line he
[1:56:58] sees a lamb and so
[1:57:00] so you have all of this confederation
[1:57:03] and and
[1:57:03] and what are they doing the these the
[1:57:06] these angels and these
[1:57:08] anointing these beast powers these this
[1:57:10] theophany as brother diggs was showing
[1:57:12] us the other night
[1:57:13] you've uh brother ram said you've heard
[1:57:15] from your theophany
[1:57:17] when what did he say he said amen to
[1:57:19] every word
[1:57:20] every time i hear the word preach
[1:57:22] something inside of me different
[1:57:24] from me not exactly me something says
[1:57:27] amen even when i don't understand it it
[1:57:31] keeps me moving
[1:57:32] i have to go i have to go this way
[1:57:37] i can't not
[1:57:43] so what are they doing they're bringing
[1:57:47] you know a way that's impossible to stop
[1:57:52] or to prevent
[1:57:54] they're bringing all sides
[1:57:57] to their predestinated climax
[1:58:00] whether it's the the white horse
[1:58:04] red horse black horse pale horse
[1:58:07] whether it's the lion the ox the the man
[1:58:11] or the eagle bringing the elected family
[1:58:13] you understand friends
[1:58:15] the history of the world is all
[1:58:16] funneling down now
[1:58:18] it's all coming together and winding up
[1:58:20] in one
[1:58:21] final climax and there's where
[1:58:25] we have arrived
[1:58:28] and it's bringing both god's family
[1:58:32] and lucifer's family inexorably
[1:58:36] bringing us all to a predestinated
[1:58:40] climax now
[1:58:44] now to my real burden
[1:58:48] we're back to abraham and abraham
[1:58:51] pleading
[1:58:52] how about just my best human effort you
[1:58:55] see
[1:58:56] there's always the tendency of a man
[1:58:58] mankind
[1:59:00] to take the path of least resistance
[1:59:03] there's always
[1:59:04] abraham wanted this this you know
[1:59:06] abraham wanted this right now
[1:59:08] idea this easier idea this less
[1:59:11] resistant idea i mean the thought of
[1:59:14] of waiting longer and i've already
[1:59:16] waited a long time
[1:59:18] and now you want me to wait longer
[1:59:21] and i you mean i gotta i gotta keep
[1:59:24] fighting
[1:59:26] and and battling all my weaknesses and
[1:59:29] frailties i
[1:59:31] how about you just take the way i am and
[1:59:33] let's just call it a day
[1:59:37] i i i don't want to keep fighting i'm
[1:59:40] tired and
[1:59:41] wait a long time and what you're asking
[1:59:44] you're asking me just to stay in the
[1:59:45] thick of it
[1:59:46] man i need a vacation i need to go
[1:59:48] disney world and you're wanting
[1:59:50] you're wanting me to stay in the thick
[1:59:51] of it my arm is so tired you want me to
[1:59:53] keep swinging a sword yep
[1:59:55] i need you to keep going because well
[1:59:57] why
[1:59:58] because i'm still working on you i'm
[2:00:01] still
[2:00:02] bringing you down this path see you
[2:00:05] you you're you you know the thought of
[2:00:07] having to fight on
[2:00:08] through our natural human frailty that
[2:00:11] wars against our faith doesn't it
[2:00:13] friends
[2:00:14] peter warns us about that dearly beloved
[2:00:17] i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[2:00:19] abstain abstain from fleshly lust
[2:00:21] which war against the soul so
[2:00:25] you know you know the the the abraham
[2:00:27] already had
[2:00:28] faith god had already confirmed that he
[2:00:31] already had certified he was certified
[2:00:33] he gave him the sign of circumcision
[2:00:35] that certified that abraham had the
[2:00:36] right kind of faith that wasn't the
[2:00:37] point
[2:00:39] abraham had certified faith but what
[2:00:41] abraham wasn't willing to do
[2:00:43] was keep battling keep going keep
[2:00:46] believing
[2:00:47] keep trusting letting god do it he
[2:00:50] wanted the easier path the thought of
[2:00:53] the continued struggle
[2:00:54] weighing on his mind you know i remember
[2:00:56] brother branham telling the story
[2:00:59] and i'm i'm coming to a close i got 11
[2:01:01] minutes
[2:01:03] to keep my promise brother brown tells a
[2:01:06] story about
[2:01:07] and i started to find it and get the
[2:01:08] details but it would just slow me down
[2:01:10] let me just do it from memory
[2:01:11] i'm sure you've read it where
[2:01:14] i think it's a dream and he he's with a
[2:01:17] brother it seemed like it might have
[2:01:19] been welch evans
[2:01:20] best i can remember and they were on the
[2:01:22] side of a river
[2:01:25] driving cattle
[2:01:29] and brother branham said now now brother
[2:01:31] welch
[2:01:32] he said i'm going to run ahead he said
[2:01:35] you keep pushing him
[2:01:37] he said i gotta run ahead because on up
[2:01:40] the trail
[2:01:41] he said there's a cut across and you see
[2:01:43] over on the other side of the river it's
[2:01:44] all smooth and nice and clean and easy
[2:01:46] walking
[2:01:47] see he said they're gonna want to go
[2:01:49] over there because it's natural
[2:01:51] they want the path of least resistance
[2:01:53] and here it's rocky and
[2:01:55] pitted and there's limbs and stickers
[2:01:57] and they don't like it over here and
[2:01:59] they'd rather be over there but i can't
[2:02:00] let them get over there brother welch
[2:02:02] you keep them going forward i'm going to
[2:02:04] run ahead and be waiting at the crossing
[2:02:06] and when they try to cross i'm going to
[2:02:07] keep them from crossing
[2:02:08] they've got to stay on this ba on this
[2:02:10] harder way
[2:02:13] they can't cross over there that other
[2:02:15] side is where the masses
[2:02:16] lead to destruction see
[2:02:19] and so so so so man doesn't want to
[2:02:23] press toward
[2:02:24] a mark or a goal press toward the mark
[2:02:28] of the high college
[2:02:29] man doesn't like to set goals you know
[2:02:31] that's why it has to be told to do that
[2:02:33] that's why school teachers tell you and
[2:02:34] counselors tell you and
[2:02:36] and and school counselors start telling
[2:02:38] you set a goal set goals you need to set
[2:02:40] goals
[2:02:41] because we don't like to press we don't
[2:02:43] like that to to do that
[2:02:45] you know even self-help gurus know that
[2:02:48] you need to strive
[2:02:49] uh as the bible says for masteries but
[2:02:51] but only the word of god
[2:02:54] tells you what kind of masteries to
[2:02:56] strive for and how to go about it
[2:02:59] and it warns you don't do it the way the
[2:03:01] world does laying up treasures here
[2:03:03] because all that'll happen here is
[2:03:04] thieves will break in and steal it
[2:03:07] rust and moth and corruption will go
[2:03:09] after it and you'll come to the end of
[2:03:10] your life
[2:03:11] and when the fiery trials come
[2:03:15] it'll reveal that you built your
[2:03:17] christianity on wood hay and stubble
[2:03:19] instead of
[2:03:20] gold silver and precious stones
[2:03:24] you'll be a christian you'll be saved
[2:03:26] you'll make it but
[2:03:28] everything you've lived for and built
[2:03:30] here will go in up in
[2:03:31] in smoke i i don't want to build my life
[2:03:35] like that
[2:03:36] i don't want to ask god please how about
[2:03:38] you just take me
[2:03:39] the best i can do with my own human
[2:03:41] weaknesses don't make me keep struggling
[2:03:44] don't make me keep fighting don't make
[2:03:46] me keep lord
[2:03:48] my weaknesses my faith and the lord just
[2:03:50] says nope that's no deal
[2:03:52] that's no deal it's not going to be
[2:03:53] ishmael it's not going to be your flesh
[2:03:55] not interested in your best effort
[2:03:58] what i actually need you to do is just
[2:03:59] surrender and have a first-hand
[2:04:02] experience that second-hand robe you got
[2:04:04] is a good one
[2:04:05] it's a really good one but what you need
[2:04:07] is a first-hand experience
[2:04:10] and have that exact same anointing there
[2:04:13] is an anointing upon us friends
[2:04:17] and it's driving us like cattle or it's
[2:04:19] leading us like sheep
[2:04:21] but i just want to encourage you with
[2:04:23] this
[2:04:25] that that that the promise of the
[2:04:28] scripture
[2:04:29] says in that day shall the branch of the
[2:04:32] lord be beautiful
[2:04:34] and glorious and the fruit of the earth
[2:04:37] shall be excellent and calmly for them
[2:04:40] that are escaped of israel
[2:04:41] and it shall come to pass that he that
[2:04:44] is left in zion and he
[2:04:46] that remaineth in jerusalem shall be
[2:04:48] called holy
[2:04:49] even every one that is written among the
[2:04:52] living
[2:04:53] in jerusalem that's the desire
[2:04:57] of my heart for me
[2:05:02] and for you and your little ones
[2:05:05] and if they grow into another generation
[2:05:07] and have more little ones
[2:05:08] i'll keep preaching it just like this
[2:05:11] god
[2:05:12] god when you look here at isaiah 4
[2:05:16] 2 and 3 you see the purpose of god for
[2:05:19] your life
[2:05:20] and it ain't let ishmael stand before
[2:05:22] thee
[2:05:23] that's never going to fly with god
[2:05:26] accept it today
[2:05:28] god sees you in revelation 12 already
[2:05:30] perfected
[2:05:31] he's already made the covenant he's
[2:05:33] already dismissed the enemy
[2:05:36] you already have the privilege to walk
[2:05:38] in the presence
[2:05:40] and be be part of hebrews 13 8
[2:05:43] jesus christ and his bride mr and mrs
[2:05:46] jesus christ
[2:05:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:05:50] that's my desire friends
[2:05:52] i hope that's your desire stand up with
[2:05:54] me brother matt bring your team
[2:05:55] i hope that's your desire today to say
[2:05:58] lord i
[2:06:00] i i i don't want to shrink
[2:06:03] from the fight i don't want to just say
[2:06:07] lord it's just too much it's just too
[2:06:10] much i just want to cruise i just want
[2:06:12] to take it easy no
[2:06:13] that's never going to that's never going
[2:06:16] to be
[2:06:17] accepted with god
[2:06:20] he's desiring your life to come and be
[2:06:23] something more
[2:06:24] than just the best effort of your human
[2:06:27] weakness
[2:06:29] why don't you bow your heads with me
[2:06:31] over the building today
[2:06:36] i thank you lord i thank you
[2:06:41] that i was able to finish and i feel
[2:06:42] quite finished
[2:06:44] suddenly i have more notes but i just
[2:06:48] feel suddenly finished and we'll
[2:06:51] perhaps make that a completely different
[2:06:53] thing but it'll be up to you
[2:06:55] i never really worry about it but i
[2:06:58] believe that today everything that you
[2:07:00] wanted said was said
[2:07:03] and lord that last portion was only
[2:07:05] added
[2:07:06] early this morning as the sun was coming
[2:07:08] up
[2:07:10] that last portion father to
[2:07:14] to remind the people don't chase the
[2:07:16] path of least resistance
[2:07:18] don't try to cross the river to the
[2:07:20] other side keep going
[2:07:22] don't don't shrink from the warfare
[2:07:25] don't don't dabble around in the lust of
[2:07:29] the world because that
[2:07:30] war is against your soul don't do that
[2:07:34] strive for masteries the correct way
[2:07:38] turn your life turn its priorities over
[2:07:40] to becoming
[2:07:41] everything that god desires and don't be
[2:07:44] afraid of the fight
[2:07:48] don't be afraid that that your character
[2:07:51] has to be built
[2:07:53] and that and i get abraham dreading it
[2:07:58] i get we dread it we we dread the we
[2:08:00] hear it we rejoice over
[2:08:02] character is a victory and not a gift
[2:08:05] but boy when it comes down to getting it
[2:08:08] sometimes lord because even the least of
[2:08:12] trials that are sent to perfect us
[2:08:14] are are described in the bible is fiery
[2:08:18] and we don't always want that lord but i
[2:08:21] do want the promise i do want to
[2:08:23] accomplish
[2:08:24] what i see there i want to stand with
