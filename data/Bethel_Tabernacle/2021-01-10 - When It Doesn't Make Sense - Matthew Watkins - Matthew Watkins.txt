of them all right brother joe amen good to see you here on him here this morning if you have your bible that'll be all the music all the worship today thank you i'd like you just to turn um to psalms chapter 13. psalms chapter 13 i don't think i'm missing any announcements i want to make sure that i'm not amen i got a lot here this morning that i just want to be obedient to the holy spirit as i know it was him who led me and i began to just deal with my thoughts in this direction and so i'm going to be real today's sermon will be very practical and it's just how the lord dealt with me but i'd like to even my title this morning i'd like to give it to you now and you'll see where we're going with this in psalms chapter and brothers if you have that put on the screen you can put that on the screen i may end up sending you a powerpoint i'm not sure yet i may still do it it's ready so if i do just be ready to throw it up there real quick amen it wouldn't be tradition if i gave it to you guys early so i had to wait and uh wait not only while i'm about to be on the stage but now i'm out here so just be ready psalms chapter 13. i'd like to preach to you this morning and i'd like to title this when it doesn't make sense when it doesn't make sense psalms chapter 13 how long will thou forgive me o lord forever how long will thy well thou hide thy face for me how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall my enemy be exalted over me consider and hear me o lord my god light in my eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death lest mine enemies say i have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved but i have trusted in the mercy and thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me amen let's just pray this morning heavenly father we thank you god for your word lord we've read it today we've expressed it lord and even in our own heart as we read some of these words how that our own reflections can immediately flood our mind lord of how often we've been in this place where david is the lord praying and asking you lord how long oh lord i pray god that your word would be father may it be very lord comforting to your people may it speak to their hearts specifically lord i know god that you move lord in mysterious ways i trust you lord and i lean upon you now may you just come and bless it we ask it in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i'm going to move this here we know that the bible declares so many things about david and it calls him a man after my own heart the lord said i'll give you a man after mine own heart and so david repeats this in psalms chapter 13 and we're just going to go through this slowly here as we go through some of these verses and just lay out maybe a foundation and see what where the lord brings us to this morning but i think it's amazing because he goes through this uh cry here in psalms chapter 13 and he says we're just going to read verse 1 again how long will thou forget me o lord and then he asks forever how long will thou wilt thou hide thy face for me it's amazing because you don't find anywhere in psalms 13 that i could find that david has sinned there's prayers that you'll read that he prays after sin psalms 55 would be one of them but we don't have any indication here that david is praying because of some trap that he's fallen into or some sin in his life but actually this was uh the enemy who was uh trying to kill him and trying to take his life and in spite of all of david's prayers and praying out to god and in spite of how many times he had no doubt cried unto the lord he's saying this in psalms 13 how long will thou forget me o lord because no doubt he had cried unto the lord he had petitioned god he had brought his need to the lord already in times past he had maybe consulted the lord we see this as something that paul says i consulted the lord three times to ask him to take it away from me same exact language where you have the apostle paul saying and confessing you're not the only one who has approached god more than one time for a need in your life and so many times you know we could say that here today that there's been multiple times maybe something that you're praying about today or you've considered and asked the lord and you've petitioned from your heart and you you've you've asked the lord for something specific in your life or you're praying about the uh the will of god and you know sometimes we can uh if you know we can become in this we can get to this place that that david was where we could say this from our hearts and say how long lord will you forget me how long will you hide your face for me says in verse 2 how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall my enemy be exalted over me and it seems that david is is asking this petition and he's crying out to god and you know that can be a very discouraging thing for a believer it can become to the point to where the mind battle of why god isn't answering is worse than the fact that he hasn't answered yeah sometimes it could become more perplexing trying to find the will of god than the will of god itself and just to say lord i'm in such a quandary i've i've petitioned you i've asked you maybe prayers over uh you know an unsaved loved one maybe a child or a situation in your home or in your health or whatever uh front the enemy is attacking because the enemy attacks on all levels if he can't get you mentally he'll attack you physically and if he can't attack you physically he'll come to you spiritually and then if he can't get there he'll come into some root of bitterness and attach you attack you emotionally can i preach to somebody this morning and so on all fronts uh satan is is uh can bombard us and david was crying over his own life and it seemed like god was just unavailable it seemed like god had just taken a vacation this is what he's expressing here in psalms 13. it seems like i've petitioned you i've prayed i've i've brought my request i've made them known i've obeyed the scriptures i've i don't understand this just doesn't make any sense to me god and there's sometimes god doesn't make sense there's times when his word uh if applied to our life and there's a certain situation and uh whatever it would be this morning sometimes it just doesn't make sense and we can ask that question uh why lord what as david is asking here why why why did it happen why did i why did why did why am i at this place that i'm at right now and you can look back over your life sometime and the devil will be quick to remind you of all of the the obedience that you've had and all of the things you've done for the lord and all that you've given up just as he did brother branham oh look at you you've given up everything for him you've preached and everybody's rejected you and what have you done for the lord notice he wasn't the devil didn't come to brother branham just highlighting his baby are you here today but he started going over his life and his ministry and saying look at what you've done for the lord look at how you've lived for him you've preached and you you've had nowhere to lay your head you've been in meetings for hours and hours and hours and and he says and you've given up everything and brother adam says yeah that's true this is the perplexity david was in when he says you know it just seems like god is not speaking he's not available it's it's it seems that he's so distant from me and oftentimes that's exactly if we'd uh be honest here today sometimes it seems like god has forgotten you amen sometimes it seems like if he's not forgotten you he's hiding from you he's hiding his face from you and and and david asked this question in such a just such a real a way that we could so relate to and he says how long will you forgive me o lord forever forever david just ask is it going to be forever is this is it always going to be like this lord is it just going to keep lasting and going on and on and on and it seems like sometimes we can go through certain struggles in our life and trials in our life and it just feels like it's lasting forever and it seems like there's just no end in sight and it just seems like it's it's just so drawn out and and it's and it's long and how long am i going to go through this and you're and it just seems like such a waiting period and man we hate to wait we hate to wait i don't care if i'm waiting on my kids if i'm waiting on my family if i'm waiting at the stoplight or if i'm waiting on god we hate to wait right some of us hate it worse than others but waiting is especially hard when you don't have anything to occupy yourself when you don't have anything to do you're just you're just waiting it feels like you're waiting for nothing and and and it's it's just a it seems like just such a and you can notice this in psalms this is psalms 13 where david is being pursued by a man who he tried to save now remember this came out of a righteous act this is after david's anointing after samuel pours the anointed oil over his head and the oil's running from his head down through his beard and he's anointing him as king and he's 80s and it's all about the projection of where david's going to be and where he's going to finally end up and where after it's not it's not just the here and now david but it's the ultimate picture of where you're going to be where your life's going to end up it's never the problem never comes with the beginning of the anointing or where the anointing is going to end it's what happens in the middle that we have so much trouble with if you can lay out the life of men of god take joseph you know just for example if you could lay out their life and we can look at it linearly can i say that word right linear if we could look at it linear and you were to lay out almost like a 3d scale if you were to ever look at a 3d or a a you know like a city that you could look at you know like a little um city miniature city and you could look at and shrink the life of joseph and you were to look at the from the time that he gets the dream and here he comes with the dream and god's gonna you know what what god of the the the vision that god has for his life he has the code of many colors and and we know joseph's entire life of the promise that god has given him but so much had happened if you look at it linear so much had happened from the time he had gotten the dream all the way to the time he's sitting on the throne amen now we'd love to just fast forward and go straight from the vision straight from the dream straight from the promise to the tower to the kingdom to the throne but it's it's you have to understand that it's what happens in the middle that brings you to the throne it's what happens in the middle it's what happens from the anointing running down david's beard uh to the time when he's sitting in jerusalem as the king it's god says david in order for me to get you from the anointing to the place i'm trying to bring you you've got to go through what's in the middle because the secret is in what's in the middle because your character to sit on that throne happens in the middle hallelujah joseph for you to ever sit on the throne you've got to go through the slavery you've got to go through being sold you've got to go through potiphar's house and through the prison and david before you ever get to the throne you've got to go through the cave of a dulum where you're running for your life you imagine just the the shock that he has as many times we don't we get the promise of god but we don't see everything that's going to happen in the middle and and and no no david never seen this coming and there he is running for his life and uh as we said he's being chased by by by saul and he's holed up he's a he's a brother and calls him a renegade and he's running and he's just a renegade and and and he's he's he's a nobody at this time he's not a king he doesn't have a throne he doesn't have an army doesn't have men it doesn't have a great great great uh great great uh a great army to fight for him he just has a few men who are faithful to david and the bible says that david is is begins to cry this and he says how long consider and hear me o lord in verse 3 lighten my eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death lest mine enemies say i prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved he's here in the desolate wilderness of judah and about all that he has at this time is just the men that he and his daily provisions just a few men that around him and his daily provisions and he's he's he's he's hiding for days and then uh days or hours and then hours turn into days and days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months and months turn into years sometimes through that middle stage and he's and and no doubt it this seems to just drag on and drag on and drag on and my how long is this gonna drag on and it's just going on and on before god uh begins to act and begin begins to speak and sometimes you know it's it's it's god moves brother branham said the holy spirit the holy ghost isn't hasty so don't be hasty he's not in a hurry you know we get in a hurry but god's not in a hurry god's not in a hurry and sometimes it seems god is moving slower than what we want to move at and he's moving at a slower pace and god's moving slow and it seems like we live in that the age of such brother branham called it uh the the age of neurotics and he said it's just a pressurized age and you're constantly under pressure you're in a hurry hurry hurry hurry go go go only to stop and wait you remember that and letting off the pressure he says you go from one place and if we're not careful we can we can this can this can trickle down into our relationship with the lord well we're just in a hurry just come on god just speed it up i mean let's let's let's go you know let's go what are we waiting on let's let's hurry i've already got anointed give me the throne i already got my anointing let me be king now no david you got to go through the wilderness you got to go through the rejection you got to go through the misery amen because the only way you'll ever be fit for the throne is if you can come through times in your life where it just doesn't make any sense and god is moving and moving and moving in and and it's amazing because god has such a different i just want to slow down on this less i just gloss over it sometimes it feels like god has such a different timetable than us we would have thought years ago we would have been out of here you'd have never thought you were you are where you are right now you never would have thought here we are at 2021 you never would have thought that never thought i'm at 20 21. you got to be kidding me and we got it we got a new administration and the world's just gonna how long is this going god's timetable is completely different than ours and we can think in terms of hours and minutes and days but and and sometimes god works in years or he works in a timetable that maybe isn't the same as what you're comfortable with as we said even the we pointed to the life of you think of joseph's life if you were to look at it linear you're able to shrink it down to a microscopic size just to a size where you could look at everything now we can see the picture of joseph's life that god has a plan for him i'm going to jump here back and forth so just stay with me here god has a plan for him you're going to raise up to a mighty position in egypt it's going to ultimately be for the salvation of you and your entire family you're going to be a ruler over all of egypt but it's amazing because when when how god gets joseph there god says i've given you a dream and he says but how i'm going to place you and what the where you're going to have to what you're going to have to go through to get from here to here joseph first over here we see about right here's the dream and about right here you're going to be sold as a slave it'll be sold into slavery joseph and it's going to be hard it's not going to make sense it's not going to make sense i'll give you a dream with all this potential and then you're at the bottom of a of a pit being sold into slavery rejected by your own family by your own brothers never would have thought your brothers would have rejected you never could have imagined it would be family sometimes family can hurt us worse than anybody and the rejection of family can hurt us worse than anybody never would have thought it would have been in my own house ray rose up or in my own by my own brothers never would have pictured never would have imagined but god looks at this whole picture and says yeah yeah about right there it's going to be slavery joseph it's going to be come by your own at the hand of your own brothers and and and and this is going to happen joseph's you know a teenage boy and he's there he is you imagine just the shock as we said that he finds himself in and now he's hauled off in the you know and he's hauled off to some foreign land some foreign nation i guarantee you he didn't expect to be getting hauled off as a slave to a foreign nation when he woke up that day never would have pictured it never would have imagined his life would ever get to this place but about that time then he he he goes and we know the story and then you look at the continue to look at the timetable and god says then joseph you're you're going to come to a place to where you're in potiphar's house and about right there you're going to get accused by potiphar's wife now god sees as brother branham says over and over and over and over again god sees the end from the beginning we don't see the end from the beginning we trust the word of god we we believe the word of god we stand on the promises of god but we see what's right in front of us and for joseph he didn't have a blown-up view of this timeline of his life where all of these events are going to take place all joseph is living in is the here and now he knows what's taking place to him now he knows how he's affected right now he knows how he feels right now he's a believer he has a dream from god he's got a promise from god but yet it's not making any sense are you here today about right here you're going to get accused uh by potter for his wife you're gonna be thrown into prison you'll be thrown into prison joseph if you look at it linear and you stack all the events up in his life from the time of the dream to the time of the throne about right there you're gonna you're gonna be in prison you're gonna be thrown into prison and a long time we got a long time's gonna go by you say god what's in that long time nothing nothing wait what are you doing right there in that little and that's long space because that could mean that could represent years and for joseph it did represent years nothing what's going to take place well it's going to seem like nothing to you but i'm doing something it's going to seem like nothing to you and sometimes in the moments when it feels like nothing to us god is doing the most in our life because he's doing not an external work but he's doing an inward work something on the inside of our hearts and joseph in that moment you're going to go through that space there you're going to be thrown into prison and you're going to be forgotten in that prison joseph long time goes by you know you imagine many times in that if we could move the we could zoom in on the timeline i'm sure somewhere in that prison joseph got down on his knees and began to fervently pray fervently fervently not hypocritically not well not with any pretense but joseph is praying sincerely thank you he's praying sincerely he's praying fervently god deliver me from this prison deliver me from this from this affliction can you get me out of here god i'm believing lord you're gonna you're gonna deliver me you're gonna get me out of here humanly now i'm just gonna speak humanly here it seemed like god didn't even hear he just sits and sits and sits and sits and time goes by finally an opportunity comes about right here about right here joseph now you're not going to see this you're not going to you're not going to look at this view i'm not going to give you this view i'm going to put you right in the middle of it and about right there there's going to come an opportunity for you joseph when the interpretation of dreams couple fellow inmates the butler and the baker we know the story king's cup bearer would be released from prison and he's restored after after all of the after uh it looked like an opportunity he's going to get out of jail looks like god's doing something he's finally working in his life and then that that king's cup bearer gets released from prison and gets restored back to his position and you know what joseph says to that man he says remember me that's what he tells him remember me and he pleads with him and he says when you get out when you when you're out just remember me and and make and get me out of here get me out of this prison i want to i want to get out could you imagine could you imagine the agony could you imagine the playground that the devil had on his mind could you imagine the the whispers that satan was whispering every night as he laid his head just another night in the prison cell could you imagine how much of a punching bag joseph felt like for the devil amen god's forgotten you the cupbearer tells him oh don't worry i'll don't worry joseph i got this and you know what happens he forgets amen he forgets him completely the next verse genesis 41 1 says now it happened genesis 41 1 brother josh if you want to bring that up i want to have it on the screen the next verse here in genesis 41 1. notice how it says this here i'm going to wait for you to get it this is after all of the this is after the the opportunity no doubt expectation no doubt joseph's thinking oh this is you know here's a chance here's an opportunity and it says here it says now it happened at the end of two full years that pharaoh had a dream now it happened at the end of two full notice how the bible writes that intentionally it happened after the end of two full years two long years pharaoh had a dream two years think think just for a moment go back two years in your life go back that's a long time now you know why david's praying words and says how long lord will you forget me forever how long god joseph could say how long lord forever amen it's gonna now notice i want i want to make sure you get this we know we smile we say amen because we see this picture and we have an assurance we know that he goes to prison but he gets out of prison he goes to the throne but joseph didn't know that for all joseph knew he was going to die in that prison cell [Music] for all joseph knew that was the end of it all for all david knew i got an anointing but i mean chased down for all david knew he was going to be he was going to be killed by by saul for two long years two full years joseph languishes he's waiting in prison you know why you asked the question god could you not have given pharaoh a dream a little few nights before [Music] why couldn't you have given him this dream two years before why the two years why the waiting why why why this why this timeline lord why do why am i going through it it's uh in all of these it just doesn't make sense lord joseph spends the better part of his twenties either a slave or in prison in egypt goes through all of his 20s of his life and that's his that's his memory goes through all of that time we we took paul even the apostle paul who the bible says i consulted the lord i taught i asked him three different times on three occasions here was the greatest uh here was the apostle paul and the bible says that he had done so much work for the lord you look at all of his life and the bible says paul goes all the way from all over europe you look at the journeys of paul in such a small amount of time such a small little window and all of the great things god did through the life of paul so much so much accomplished so little time that he did that he did it in he goes all the way to rome but how did god get paul to rome through prison through beatings they're scorchings imprisoned him on a false charge amen completely falsely accused remember paul and silas there in in prison false charge they didn't do anything wrong completely false if anybody ever had a reason to say i don't deserve this it was paul and silas but yeah what's their reaction in prison with with uh with chains on their hands the bible says they begin to sing a song unto the lord begin to worship him begin to praise him it was it was through all of that after two years even when paul's it's amazing because even when paul's falsely charged in in uh caesarea and you go read the story with felix and if you go read that verse in acts it says but after two years the bible says i thought i had it written down here in acts 24 27 it says after two years had passed felix was succeeded by festus and wishing of the jews a favor felix left paul imprisoned left him imprisoned two years david's going through the same exact thing he had been anointed as a king as we said on his linear timeline he gets his anointing but now david is anointed king by a prophet has a promise when he's a teenager but now he's running for his life in the caves he's running for his life anointed by running you know no doubt he goes through all of those teenage years and now he's in his 20s very much like joseph and david's could be is crying this out how long lord will thou forgive me forever how long will i hide thy face for me consider and hear me oh lord lest my enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved where where's god where is he have you forgotten about me lord perhaps you maybe can relate in your own life when it feels like the lord is so distant so far seems like god is doing nothing but god is doing something i said it seems like god is doing nothing but god is doing something he doesn't slumber and he doesn't sleep he's always working he's always busy maybe not in the ways that you think he should be maybe not in the ways that you feel him or are used to filling him but god is ever busy about his promises he's ever tending to his garden which is you he's ever he's ever busy may it's maybe it seemed like a silent time for david's life but god was building character that was fit to rule on a throne god was doing something in david's heart through the silence and through the forsaken filling that he himself is experiencing and it seemed like to david seemed like his enemy was winning you know that that makes it worse when you get to a place to where you feel like the devil's winning not only am i losing not only am i not only does the lord feel distant but it looks like saul's winning looks like he was just winning imagine here's saul and it looks like he's uh to to david he's still the king he's still in the palace here i've saved his life i've spared his life and he's coming after me and here i am sleeping in caves uh saul's not out seeking the lord so it's not out fervently praying for the lord but i am god don't you know what's happening don't you know what you're doing don't you know i'm the good guy don't you know lord that what i've done lord says oh i've know i know all about it david i know all about it you're preaching to the choir because david doesn't know his life is actually a representation of the life of christ joseph doesn't know that what he's going through is just a type of what jesus is going to go through he doesn't see it all he sees is though we have the linear picture of everything he goes through but god never tells him and so his confidence you notice this even here you know we we preached this maybe i guess it was a couple years ago now and i was going back to it even reading in exodus you could go back and read the story uh you you you hear about even what we just read in david and what we read about joseph and the the bible says this the same exact thing about about uh about jehoshaphat when he goes to pray it's amazing because we know that the lord is the ruler he's the he's the king he's the he's the he's the there is no dictator uh in the economy of god he's a sovereign king he rules by love not by law not by condemnation he rules by grace his precepts are mercy and grace and love but he's lord over everything david he's lord over the good times in your life and he's lord in the bad times he's king and sovereign in the cave and he's king and sovereign on the throne glory he's king and sovereign in the times of daylight and the night he's the god of the mountain and he's the god of the valley he's the lord of all creation the bible says that he says he ruleth in psalm 66 7 he ruleth by his power forever not that that's that's forever not not not just in the bible times he's still ruling right now he's still on the throne right now he's still controlling what's happening in the government and in the world right now over every nation over every kindred over every tongue over every dictator over every president [Music] he is king the bible says in psalms 93 1 it says the lord reigns he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting verse 5 thy testimonies are very sure this was the same man who prays in psalms 13 and says how long o lord will thou forget me forever o god how long will i consult in my soul and and he says how long lord this is the same one and psalms 93 thy testimonies are very sure my testimonies are sure the statutes are just i thou reigneth forever and he says lord your decrees your laws your word are irrevocable your law now the law of the land you take the law of a of a of a president well that can be changed the law of a congress that can be changed law of the senate that can be changed local law here in buford could be superseded you know by by a higher power and then they could supersede that then the supreme court could overthrow that but let me tell you something about this law nothing supersedes this this is irrevocable this is the supreme court this is the supreme court people think they vote in justices and they they and that's that's the the highest law of the land that's not the highest law of the land this is the highest law of the land this is the supreme court and there is the supreme judge and david says this he says your testimonies your laws are irrevocable they're not just irrevocable laws they're reliable i can rely upon them that's what he's saying your testimony is sure it has integrity it has foundation it has stability i don't need to question it it's solid it's irrevocable it's reliable even paul even you go read the book of hebrews says the same exact thing in hebrews chapter 13. i'm going to give you a very famous verse here hebrews 13 verse 8. anybody know that that's that verse the bible says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever paul's echoing the same thing david was your laws are irrevocable they're forever they're from everlasting to everlasting your words are from everlasting uh to everlasting you even notice the the law that he put in the earth to rule the moon to rule the tides the the the the law to to to rule the movement of the sun and the earth and the moon and the stars the heavenly the heavenly bodies that we have they are sure they are forever they are eternal an eternal part of god brother brandon said the earth was in the book of life it's an eternal part of god an eternal attribute and it's forever david says that it's forever we're told all the way and you notice this all the way throughout the entire bible i want to read you so good just take a pause from that here for a moment the bible says but without even turning it says that that he's that the the scripture says that the that we have a high priest who is touched by the feelings of our infirmities do you believe that you think god wasn't touched by david's words how long will thou forgive me o lord the bible says he's a high priest who can be touched by the fillings of our infirmities it says in another place in the old testament it says he bottles up david said that he bottles up our tears he says in the in thy bottle thou has held all my tears every tear i've cried every sorrow that i've had lord you you felt you're a high priest who can be touched after the feelings of our infirmities you bottle every tear but let me let me pause from that here just for a moment because we believe that about the attribute of god he's a high priest who can be touched he bills every tear he's compassionate he's loving but let me tell you something also about the lord he's a righteous sovereign king and his word is sure and it's everlasting he's a righteous sovereign god and his word his word is his thoughts and his thoughts is his words and his words is his constitution it's his law it's his rule it's what he believes not the opinion of some man not the opinion of some group of men this is the constitution of god this is the law that he lives by this is his word the bible says where the word of a king is there is power and who can say unto him what doest thou this is speaking of the lord solomon was speaking of the lord where the word of the king is there is power when he speaks he's a sovereign he's the lord and let me say it like the prophet of god said it he his he is bound to his own word i love that i was rejoicing last night listening to the brother of adam preach that god proven his word god keeps his word and brother varian says why does god keep his word because he's bound to his own word his opinion can't be changed there's going to be no dissent to this word there's going to be no opinions or or some group of of uh you know some consensus of how we should change the word the word is unchanging and he's bound to it it's his word it's his decree and it's irrevocable and it's reliable and it's sure and it will last forever it'll last forever it's his constitution it's exactly what he believes it's what he rules by it's what he will judge the world by amen did you hear me it's what brother madam says is what he'll judge the world by oh i can hear the words of brother adam say it over and over he is god is duty bound he is duty bound to keep his own word amen his duty bound to keep his own word it has he rules by it he judges the earth by it everything that you have that you interact with consists and was created by that word brother branham says he'll judge the world by that word oh let me just say this to you my brother you can hold this book if you got your bible put it in your hand you can hold this book right now and say if there is something that is sure in this world i got something that is sure if i've got something that is irrevocable i got it right here i've got something that god is bound to he has tied to he can't reject it it's part of himself you can hold the bible in your hand and you can know who god is the bible tells us his nature his promises his judgments his laws from his own mouth and it's what he rules by it's a word that the bible says he has bound himself to do you know every judge today they swear by a law the judge is duty-bound that judge is duty-bound to the law now that law can change and then that judge is now dutily bound by that law by the change law are you here even even today they determine cases according to law that is established laws that are already established precedent you ever heard that word and then you ever heard of a binding precedent it's something that a judge will immediately go to because it's a binding precedent it's something that is that is sure some it's an absolute it's an anchor something he can rule by if he doesn't have a law he can't rule he doesn't have to rely a judge doesn't rely or does he have to rely upon his feelings are you here he doesn't have to rely upon feeling sorry for the defendant or feeling sorry for this or or what does he think he's not swayed by his emotions because he's got a law he can go back to by that binding law he's bound to to execute the law that's his own that's the word that he's bound to and then and he says his judgment his rulings are issued based upon that they are guided by a constitution and he's up he has to uphold his rulings have to be upheld and bound to that constitution well likewise god rules and judges everything by a word and he is the righteous judge and he has a constitution and he is bound to that constitution are you here today friends he's got an established law and it's not based upon his feelings it's not based upon his emotions it's not based upon anger it's not based upon love it's based upon his word and his word is sure david said it's from everlasting to everlasting it doesn't change with me or with you it doesn't change with this president or that president or this time or that time his word is sure it lasts forever it's his constitution it's his established word when he rules he rules by a living word and he is bound he said brother matt why are you why are you preaching this just hold on he is bound to that word i love to remind myself of that yes sir you ought to remind yourself of that this morning god is bound to his own word he's anchored to his own word the king the judge this king this judge you say brother matt why is that important for david why is why was that important for joseph why is that important for paul the same reason it's important for you because if god's bound by his own word then we can hold god to his own word and in the times when it doesn't make sense you know what you ought to do you ought to remind god of his own word you ought to read i said you ought to remind god of his own word in fact in isaiah he tells them that he says remind me of my own law what is it you think god suddenly needs to be reminded goes ah oh yeah oh oh gee i'm sorry i forgot no but brother adam said the bible says that god god is bound duty-bound to his own word to his own promise and this is what god says therefore come boldly into the courtroom come boldly this is your approach this is how god told you to approach his throne therefore come boldly into the unto the unto the throne of god that you may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need approach boldly this is how god says to make our request in philippians don't be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request that's your petitions that's your needs that's your burdens that's what you need in life let your requests be known unto god without worry without fear without anxiety without stress come to the throne of god boldly because he's a king and he's a king that's bound to his own word and brother branham says you find god he says anywhere acting one way in the bible he's bound he said he's duty bound to act the same way when you approach him under the same circumstances do you believe that here today he says he's duty-bound he's duty-bound he's bound to his own word he's bound to it let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace this is ephesians 3 verse 12 brother josh he says let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need amen what is your attitude when you approach the throne of god paul says it should be bold in all boldness in whom we have this is ephesians 3 notice this that was hebrews 4 16 hebrew ephesians 3 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence you notice what he's trying to get to you you weepy oh wow brother joel says well whilst he wows he woo you're down and down cast it o lord the paul says now in whom you should have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him you approach him boldly why by the man because he's bound to his own word and when it doesn't make sense you remind him of his own word when it doesn't make sense what did jehoshaphat do when it didn't make any sense at all he reminded god of his own word go go and look at that here just for a minute just just for a moment we'll we'll pause from that just for a second it's 12 30 so i'm feeling the crunch from time notice what it says here in james chapter 5 verse 16 just have this written down the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much that word effectual comes from a greek word that means a fixed position meaning that it's unmovable unshakable it's an unshakable mindset the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much it's a fervency which speaks of boldness it speaks of an absolute resolute attitude that this is god's word i am god's child and i'm coming to remind god of his own promises today you got need you got a need this morning you got something you need from the holy spirit your attitude should be boldness and say lord i'm your child i'm coming with your word and i'm here to remind you of your own word this morning lord you are duty bound to your own word i wanna i wanna i don't have time but we're just gonna take the time can i have just a few extra minutes here notice what he says here and this is in and this is moses in exodus chapter thirty we'll we'll look at jehoshaphat first ii chronicles chapter 20 brother josh we're going to close here just in a moment notice what he says here this is jehoshaphat jehoshaphat king righteous king the bible says in ii chronicles chapter 20 i know you know this very well he's he's facing an invading massive massive army multiple i forgot how many kings three or four kings had had had made an alliance to come and destroy him now notice here the bible says he's he's he's going to face this great army just just go to second chronicles chapter 20 brother josh put it up on the screen verse one came to pass after this also the children of moab the child of amen beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea of the side of syria and behold they be in heisante mar which is in getty verse 3 and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaim to fast throughout all of judah so here's these people are fasting and praying here's jehoshaphat now here he's a king righteous king and made a mistake that's why he's in this trouble but he the bible says that he gets this word they're coming all of the enemies coming multiple army's king and the bible says jehoshaphat feared and he began to set himself to seek the lord the bible says the people pray they fast they're they're repenting they're crying out to god there there there there was there was a and a call just a just a a cry out to god no doubt of despair lord what's gonna happen to us the bible says in judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord and he says here in verse 7. notice this notice what notice what he hears the people hold on before that here's the people praying here's the people fasting here's the people uh you know no doubt in the frenzy saying lord what's going to happen very much like david how long are you going to forgive me oh lord uh forever lord how long are you going to deliver me god am i going to die here joseph could say am i just going to rot here in prison the bible says jehoshaphat stood in the congregation notice what he begins to say here is a king i want you to remember this this is a king a king rules by his word and now a king begins to talk to the king hallelujah and jehoshaphat says he brings back what is he doing he's bringing back a precedent he's reminding god of the binding precedent that's in the law before you rule god jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of jew jerusalem in the house of lord before the new court notice verse 7 oh lord god of our fathers are you not god in heaven do notice holy words thus do are now that are not thou our god who did drive out the inhabitants of the land he says before thy people and gave us it to thy seat abraham thy friend thy friend forever verse 8 and they dwell therein and they have built the sanctuary wherein the sanctuary therein for thy name saying notice verse 9 keep going brother josh he says before thy name saying notice what he begins to remind the lord of and he says keep going brother keep going i don't have it here before me so i'm really relying on you second chronicles 24 okay yeah we want to go okay perfect now jehoshaphat slept just pause that here for a moment he says here he says art thou not the lord let me find it in my notes because i have it right here chapter 20 verse six that's what we did we went to we went one verse two many and he says oh lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven do you not rule over all the kingdoms of the heathen in your hand is there not power and might notice how he's saying this in your hands is there not power and might is there not lord and he says he says is there that so that none is with able to with to withstand you and jehoshaphat what was he doing he was reminding god of his word this wasn't jehoshaphat's word this was the word of the lord and he says he's reminding him lord ah are you not our god of our fathers our art not thou god in heaven and rule us thou not over all the kingdoms of the heathen and thy hand as they're not power and mind so that none is able to withstand thee jehoshaphat is reminding the lord of his precedent he's reminding the lord of his own constitution he's reminding the lord of his own words of his own law he's saying god you are bound to this this is your word not our word are you here to are you catching it friends jehoshaphat was binding god are you not our god who to drive out the inhabitants of the slam from before you your people israel and gave it to the seed of abraham your friend forever amen is that not you the lord could say yes it's me and then jehoshaphat could say lord we are your seed we are your seed you promised it to abraham thy friend forever where were abraham's seed lord this is your word this is what you said lord i'm just reading back to you what you promised lord i'm a king and i'm held by my word you're a king and you're bound by your word we are your seed lord you gave your people an eternal word and lord i'm bringing that word before you now i'm i'm presenting my case i'm not going to talk about my problems i'm not going to talk about my issues i'm not going to talk about the current circumstance because the kings are coming they're coming to wipe us out here's what i'm going to do lord it doesn't make sense right now so i'm going to do the only thing i have and that's your word and i'm going to remind you of your own word lord you promised it to abraham your seed forever and i'm your seed and these are your seed and these are your children lord this is your children god i'm bringing your word before you now you promised it you made a promise to abraham and our fathers and the same promise that you made to abraham was binding to abraham and that same promise is binding to me because why because i'm your child and if you're a part of the family of god the promises of god god is bound duty bound to those promises for you all you got to do is claim them and say i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and the promise that you made to my father's before me is bound to my family and my children [Applause] joseph had said lord they're binding they obey we're bound to abraham now they're bound to us you know what god says god goes further than that and the bible says that that a a a prophet comes on the scene and the bible says that he begins to begins to say stand still jehoshaphat he says stand still jehoshaphat and he says and see the salvation of the lord and he says for the battle is not yours it's the lord's the battle is not yours stands you feel it says only praise him that's all you're going to do you're going to bring the musicians and you're going to begin to praise and god's going to do the rest and the bible goes on to record that jehoshaphat goes to battle now no what i want you to catch here before we close is that god knew his word before jehoshaphat rehearsed his word to him god could have sent that prophet to steal the people and to tell them the battle's not yours it's the lord you won't fight today but he waited for jehoshaphat to read the word back to him and when jehoshaphat begin to declare the word of god god sends a prophet and the prophet comes with a word and says you won't fight he says only in this battle you won't fight for the battle is not yours it's the lord and you know what jehoshaphat does he goes the next day and they set themselves in a ray with musicians no swords no chariots no army and the bible says that jehoshaphat as they go into battle he begins to remind them now of the prophet's words he goes back he didn't notice he's not quoting now he doesn't quote to the people he doesn't quote back to god we're the seed of abraham but the bible says jehoshaphat begins to say believe in the lord your god and you shall pray and you shall be sin you shall prosper believe in his prophets and so shall you be established you may have that backwards but what's he doing he's repeating the word of god back to the people let this be your confidence that it's not your word it's not your promise it's not your ba it's not even your battle it's the lord's battle and it's not your words it's the words of god and it's the words of god's prophet what you should do today is remind god you sent a word and i'm claiming that word i'm repeating that word i'm confessing that word it's not my word it's your word lord and now god was bound to the word of the prophet praise the lord moses finds himself in the same exact place david finds himself in the you remember in exodus when it when he begins and when moses begins this conversation with the lord and he goes back and forth and back and forth and you know for moses it didn't make any sense god wasn't making any sense and you find this as he goes in this dialogue and he goes back and forth with god and back and forth with god in exodus chapter 32. if you have that brother uh matt brother josh exodus 33 verse 8 verse 9 came to pass i just want to read this and it came to pass i'm fixing to close brother dick says as moses entered into the tabernacle how to build her to sin and stood at the door of the i could talk with moses and all the people saw the cloudy the pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up in worship now notice this verse 11 and the lord spoke unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again to the camp but his servant joshua young a young man departed not out of the tabernacle and moses said unto the lord see you know what he's doing here this is a conversation you ever had a conversation with somebody and you say see here's the problem you ever told somebody said see well you see you ever go to approach somebody and you got to tell them something and what's the problem you know what's what's on your heart well see here's the issue that's exactly what moses is doing see thou said unto me bring up thy this people and thou has not let me know whom thou wilt sin with me yet thou has said i know thee by name and that was also found grace in my sight verse 13. now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight in other words if that's really true show me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this and consider that this nation is thy people what's moses beginning to do he's beginning to remind god lord see here's the issue i'm having what's the problem moses the issue i'm having lord you promised to see you said this lord you said i found grace in your sight this is your people verse 14 and he said my presence this is moses still and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest verse 15 and he said unto him if thy presence god says my presence shall go with thee and i shall give thee rest and moses says if thy presence if thou if if thy presence go not with me carry us not a pencil in other words most saying that's good that's all well fine and good god but let me just tell you right now in case you didn't hear me the first time if you don't go don't send me moses i'm sending you i know lord i just want to make sure you understand this my presence shall go with me moses and i'll give this good i'm glad you're saying that lord but i'm just letting you know if your presence doesn't go uh don't don't even care carry us up not up hence what he begins to say verse for wherein shall it be known hear that i'm not people it's like it's not enough it's not enough for him he's got to just keep going and keep going and keep going you've already got the word of the lord moses he's already promised to you moses he's already told you my presence will go you've not even told me my presence will go with me good but if your presence doesn't go and then he keeps on for wherein shall that be known that here that i and that people have found grace on thy side is it not that thou go is with us so we shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth what's what's god starting to do god told moses he says moses i'm going to go with you i'm going to go before you and moses says that's good god i believe it you know i'm a believer that's what believers do i believe your word but i want to let you know lord just in case just in case there's any chance lord moses says just in case lord i just want to let you know don't even send me unless you lo lord i just don't even know and god says okay moses okay okay i got it now now here's my answer my presence will go with you and i shall give you rest you think that'd be enough for brother moses you know why it's not because it's not enough for you either it's not enough for me either and we got to be told time and time and time and time and time and time again it would have been enough for moses moses what are you doing well it just keeps going on lord my presence going to go with you moses lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that i was spoken of that was found grace in my sight and i would know that my name and moses just goes on and now notice what he does go back to verse 16 brother josh he begins to say for when shall it be known here that i am that people of from grace and i say is it not that thou goes with us now paul's here so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth do you realize that's not moses he didn't alter that statement amen that's literally repeating god's words verbatim back to god so god says so thou shall be separated no go back to 16 brother josh so thou shall be separated from all the people that are upon the face of the earth what is moses doing he's starting to repeat the word of god back to god as if god didn't already know this moses begins to repeat it he begins to speak it he begins to tell it why because he's binding god to his own word you promised this lord i didn't promise it you made this decree not me i want to make sure you know this god my confidence is not in my thinking because my thinking can change from day to day my confidence in me lord is nothing my confidence and my emotions is nothing my confidence and my ability is nothing my confidence is in this your word o god shall be established forever your word is from everlasting to everlasting and i'm going to begin to remind you of your own word because it's a promise and it's sure because it came from the king it's not my word it's your word it's not my promises it's your promises you are the bible said god the bible calls the lord the author and the finisher of our faith and let me tell you something he's not just the author and the finisher he's everything in the middle too he's everything in the m in the middle he's from the beginning to the end he's everything in the middle oh as we we've said this here before you the the difference in this race that you're running of life we're we're running a race of life you know you run a race there's a man there at the beginning of the race and he takes a pistol and he blows the trigger and he pulls the trigger and the shot goes off and everyone goes running there's something very unique about this race of life though because the same man who pulled the trigger to start the race is actually the same man at the finish line waiting to congratulate you when you cross your finish line why because he's the author and he's the finisher you know what else he is he's also the the audience uh cheering you on he's also the man there with a cup of water just say take a drink you can make it keep going keep pressing you've almost crossed the finish line he's there if i'm not breathing my first breath he's there when i breathe my last breath and he's there all in the middle even when it doesn't make sense even when it doesn't make sense musicians could you come even when it doesn't make sense you remind him of his own word you promised lord you're bound to a promised god bless the lord amen you said these people are your seed and that your seed would last and endure forever you started it lord it's not making much sense right now you know there's times in your life when it does there's times in your life when you you have a feeling at least stand to your feet times in your life you have a feeling of maybe a sense of security that's all i got it figured out you know i got it got planned for my life and looks like it's all going to go you know but if we'd be honest here today there are times when we can feel like that one day one year one set of years and then suddenly we enter into a place in our life where it's just what happened it just doesn't make sense lord it's not making any sense what's you could feel that way even now so lord it's not making sense what's happening in the world today what's happening how long is this going to last what's what's taking place right now lord you can feel like you got it all figured out then there's other times you say lord this doesn't just don't feel like it makes any sense to me it's david says pray david prayed you know how long lord will you forget me forever is it just going to be that way is it going to be like this forever how long will it and sometimes as we said at the beginning it can drag out like joseph drags out for years like paul and felix goes for years two years in prison how long will it go lord but let me just remind you here this morning he's the god in the whole picture amen and he's everything at the beginning he's everything at the end and he's everything in between and you need to do this today i promise it'll help you you remind god of his word just as moses did moses reminded him said lord this is your word moses i'll go with you i'll give you rest that's good god that's good i believe it lord i i accept it lord i i trust in it lord and you no doubt you know we could look like moses and thank goodness you know how long is it going to take you to get it moses how long how many how much is god going to have to say i mean isn't it enough as i read exodus 32 i say moses let me just tell you something buddy right before i read that entire perplexing conversation that you just had with the lord i read that god spoke to you face to face as a man speaks to another man to his friend and i want to let you know moses um i've never experienced that i've never had a chance to sit down with god i've talked to him felt him in my soul i've never sat down and got had to have a conversation if moses is i want you to catch this if moses could sit face to face and talk to god as a man talks with his friend and still question not the word but the man the vessel the promise if he could do that with the face-to-face conversation how much more us here today could we get to a place in our own hearts where we're going i just don't know lord it just doesn't make sense lord and you could say moses my goodness moses how much is it going to take how much more is god going to have to do to get your attention to give you confidence that it's him how much more is he going to have to say god if you don't go for me moses my presence go with that's good god but if you don't go don't even send us because how will our people know my presence will go you found grace if i found grace in your sight you found grace in my sight moses you know you just look at it and go my goodness you know god you know could have just looked at him and said you know what just forget it moses my goodness how many times do i gotta tell you how sure do i gotta you know what you know what moses you know what never mind harry i'm face to face i've already given my word two or three times and you're still questioning the word i am so glad that god didn't do that to moses i'm so glad he didn't push him aside i'm so glad he doesn't cast him aside but he just keeps talking to him and he keeps commuting with him and he keeps telling him god can say to me how long is it going to take you how how many times uh how many times the devil could say how many times how much is it going to take for you to believe the word of god how when will you ever believe god says i'm not going to quit i'm going to keep preaching it to you i'm going to keep telling it to you i'm going to keep expressing it to you and you may walk out of here today and doubt it tomorrow will you give up on me then god no i'll just keep talking moses i'll keep preaching moses i'm going to keep standing moses until when until you believe moses i'm going to keep on pouring it on you moses because it's not always going to make sense buy your heads with me here this morning not always going to make sense it doesn't always make sense when it didn't make sense to moses he reminded god of his word when it didn't make sense to jehoshaphat he begins to remind god of his own word this is your people this is your seed you said your seed would last forever and we are your seed i wonder if you could do that today maybe by an uplifted hand say lord this is your word this is not my word this is your promise this was not my promise i'm only here because you put me here i didn't start this lord i surely can't finish it i didn't put myself here i didn't one day decide i wanted to serve you but you came looking for me you came searching for me you found me lord you cleaned me you saved me you sanctified me this is your promise oh god this is your word and you're bound your duty bound oh as your prophet said god keeps his word i raised my hands today lord and i i confess that with faith i confess it with my mouth god you keep your word thank you lord for something that we can trust that we can rely upon something that we can anchor our soul to this morning lord though the world is shaking though it's so uncertain uncertain for tomorrow uncertain for next year lord but we're your children that's what's sure we may not know what tomorrow holds but as the song says we know who holds tomorrow oh lord we're grateful this morning to be called your children to be called your seed lord that lasts forever for it's your promise for when you could swear by nothing greater you swore by yourself we stand upon it this morning lord we raise our hands and we want you to know lord by confession we trust you you're in control you're sovereign your decrees are from everlasting to everlasting they're eternal they don't change yesterday they didn't they're not going to change today
