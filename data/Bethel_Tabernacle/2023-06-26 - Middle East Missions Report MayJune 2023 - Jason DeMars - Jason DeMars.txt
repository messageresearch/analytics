been looking forward to this all day long wouldn't want to be at work that's for sure wouldn't want to be out in the world somewhere that's for sure rather be right here with Believers for looking forward to the word and we got brother Jason he's coming out just in a moment gonna speak for us and give us a report and also and carry the word tonight so I've been looking forward to this all day amen you can have your seats just for a moment we just wanted to make just a few announcements and I know there's a lot missing here tonight but they'll get this uh either by live stream or by archive we just have more things to say uh with youth camp coming up so I'll just take just two minutes really quick then I'll have brother Ken sing again and why Brother JD come out and if anything I miss brother Jason can clear up if I'm if I quote from October chapter 4 verse 3 or anything like that he can certainly clear that up for me I just wanted to make just a couple clarifications because there's been a lot of uh questions now that registration is over registration is full we filled up um yesterday so we were about a day and I think by noon the next day it was full and we've got quite a waiting list now uh seemed like about every 30 minutes we had people signing up for that so God's got everything in control amen and if he wants a young person there at the last two years we've been able to get every single one on the list there's actually potentially more room with this Camp than what we've held registration at but we really need to get through the first year uh rather than have everyone show up for our first time and be unprepared so uh Lord willing we'll we'll be able to look at that a little bit closer but Camp is coming up and it's not October chapter four it's October 19th um and so we wanted to say as far as the registration because there was some confusion on the pricing for registration so let me just clarify this uh for everybody and there my dad also who's not here tonight they've traveled to North Carolina for my great aunt and Jules uh great great aunt Jules uh funeral with my grandmother also so keep them in prayer they traveled up there today and will be there at the funerals tomorrow but he will when he returns make some more just remarks bringing everybody up to speed as far as this church um I am so excited that we've got a church that has a vision for youth and I believe that that's a unanimous Vision amongst the body of Believers here we've got a lot of young families a lot of young people and so the the Youth Camp was started out of a burden from parents all the parents collectively uh in this church wanting to see God do something for their children and I am so glad I can report the Lord Has Done miraculous things in our family in this church and families and not just the blessing that he's brought to the young people but even to us old folk and some of us older folk than me the Lord has brought a lot of a lot of blessing it's been a refreshing amen is that how you feel been a refreshing Youth Camp has been so refreshing so we're looking forward to that and all the youth functions that we have throughout the year um we're just thankful for all the work and all the help that goes into that so as far as pay it actually the 250 dollars I want to say it's 252 is actually the price for everybody everyone so when we charge 250 we don't make a dime we don't make one dollar Off Youth Camp there won't be a penny made from registration my dad has elected as a from a burden for the young people and the counselors who are coming to work the whole week um going to be given of themselves to the young people they serve an essential role at Youth Camp they played a massive part to the success of our camp because we did things so different with the counselor we didn't do as we said this before we did not do a sign up sheet for counselors but part of the original Vision that we had was to hand select as the Lord would allow people that we know that we have trust in we trust their testimony and that we know personally not just the Holy Ghost Field adult that's an absolute given but also there's certain characteristics of of certain personalities of people who work well with young people and so we wanted to make sure it was people that that were willing able and that that would meet the criteria that we were going for and the Lord really blessed that we got reports of that from so many other churches just the way that when there was not us it was the Lord who put it upon our heart to do it that way this year we have more we have 45 is that right counselors this year so quite a number uh and we have all of those everybody all the counselors are full we have all the brothers and all the sisters we have registration for kids uh is full the work crew that we needed um is at 20 I think is 20 daily is that right something around that so we need about 25 more but I wanted to clarify my dad as a burden decided to subsidize the price for young people and counselors so uh he'll say more on that when he comes but that is a deficit no matter how you look at it because the amount the difference between that will be subsidized obviously he couldn't do that for everybody who's coming and so myself my family all the families who are have spent you know countless months for the past eight or nine months uh preparing working planning we've taken multiple trips to Greenville of our own out of our own pocket take it off work uh spent hours and time so it's a labor of love it's a it's a sacrifice uh of love that everybody who's in who who has who has given the musicians who have played for the last two years have came up and all the helpers the deacons the brothers the sisters sound crew tech crew Everybody I don't want to leave anybody out that has went it has been out of our own accord no one's got paid we haven't made a dime so if that was ever assumed uh or presumed I should say it's incorrect we've not been paid for it I paid for my kids everybody in the group pays for their kids I pay my 250 everybody does so no one's exempt from that the only ones who don't pay that amount is the group of the young people and the um the counselors I want to make sure we got that it's a labor of love but it's for our young people and uh and so we we want to invest in that I believe it's a worthy cause so we appreciate as I said everybody's sacrifice and I also wanted just to say um you know we we want as many of our church as we possibly can get that would be willing whether it's musicians or deacons or security or families to come up and help but we totally understand that not everyone can do that so I wanted to make sure there was no no one felt there was any pressure you don't have to go no one's obligating you musicians um uh laity we have the best a musician group and we much prefer to have our brothers and sisters play and and our people we have the best deacons and the the best uh you know the the best families in the planet right here in Beaufort South Carolina and Bluffton and ladies Allen and the rest of the places y'all live ah going to disclude anybody but we understand if someone couldn't go it's there's no obligation fortunately the Lord is we've had a list of people from Camp musicians and security any any spot that we couldn't feel there's been a line of people wanting to fill that spot but we wanted to give our group our people first dibs first chance first opportunity at that so uh we just I just wanted to be crystal clear that there wasn't any there's no pressure we don't want any pressure from uh we we wouldn't want anybody to feel pressured by that but I may make a plea again and again and again if you're able to help and able to go we would greatly appreciate it we would rather uh fill up the staff that we need from our church that would be our desire uh and our church only but we know that's not always not always possible there's families that can't go they just have already let me know that one I know would be there they've been there years past and just can't make it as much as they want to and so I just wanted to say we we totally understand that completely so I got a text okay I cleared that up right already okay good sorry Deb didn't mean to look at you to give it away that you texted in church so it's not so the work crew also thank you the work crew doesn't pay that the worker has a less amount now the work crew uh that's the epitome of the word work because that's all they're coming to do they are staying in a bunk house they're not even staying they're staying in bunks or the brothers all stay in one and the sisters stay in another bunk house so they're charged a lesser amounts of amount that's a lot less but they're also coming to work the entire time they're going to be there what's been Carolina Point has asked for 10 hours a day so uh free a labor of love and so they're paying quite a substantial amount less if there's any questions if I've not been clear then please get with JD I'm sure he'll clear it up but uh I just wanted to say that and make sure that uh we were clear on that we still need 25 I believe more so work crew and I'm sure there'll be more announcements coming up for Youth Camp as we get closer let's all stand do you love the Lord Jesus amen so so glad to be part of the family of God Amen could you sing that again brother can purify my heart you ready for the word amen are you ready for the word I'm going to just raise the hand say Lord come and feed me I'm hungry we'll just want to pull up a chair to your table amen and be fed by the master read refined fire could you raise your hands and sing it now Like a Prayer my heart's one desire is to be [Music] holy [Music] for you Lord I choose to be [Music] holy [Music] shed apart for you my master I'm ready to do could you raise your hands now sing it like a prairie Fighters oh really fire flashlight [Music] s apart for you the Lord I choose to be [Music] home set apart for you my master ready to do your way let's pray father we just come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your goodness for your mercy your grace to us Lord we pray that your Holy Spirit would move in our hearts father even as we give this missions report Lord I pray that people would be blessed and people would be inspired Lord and help us Lord to as we see this realize we each have our part Lord to walk with you and we each have a missions field surrounding us father guide and direct our footsteps guide and direct our thoughts here tonight use this for your glory we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you we're gonna start with a scripture in First Corinthians chapter 16. I'm going to be giving my missions report and if there's enough time speak in a few short words to preach so First Corinthians 16 9 for a great door an effectual is open unto me and there are many adversaries may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word it can be seated thank you musicians so if you want to bring up that PowerPoint brother Mark so I went to uh two different countries in the end of May and into early June went to Turkey and also to Israel and I just want to start with a disclaimer um that I'm not Moses or Elijah and also I don't think that I'm being sent in the spirit and power of Moses or Elijah I don't believe that there'll be Gentiles I did check my DNA and I'm not Jewish at all so I don't think I'll ever qualify as Moses or Elijah to the Jews so it's a it's a funny thing but there's been many raised up that would go in in Pride and say I'm Moses or this one's Elijah and I just want to say that right away because a misunderstanding can come not necessarily from you but maybe for people that are listening to the testimony so first disclaimer I had a testimony that led to this trip prior to the trip anytime I go on a missions trip I really look to the Lord in his his leadership and I get something out of my heart and I start moving towards that and I see if the doors are opened or if the Lord is blocking or if things go through smoothly and then ultimately if I really feel at peace in my heart like this is this is what it's supposed to be and so I was kind of moving forward in early May thinking my goodness I better book my ticket it's I'm about to leave in a couple three weeks if I'm going to do it so um I was just really waiting on the Lord for that unction and that peace and that confirmation and honestly was feeling very discouraged um and a little bit down just wondering what am I doing what's my purpose what am I supposed to go forward in and um uh brother Nehemiah the the translator and Minister that I work with he lives in Canada and I've been working with since 2009 on translations for the Farsi language it gave me a call he said I have a testimony to share with you he said an Iranian man living in Paris who was was a Baha'i I'm not sure if you're familiar with Baha'i but it's sort of an amalgamation of different religions and they accept every religion's holy man as like the messenger of the their age kind of thing and so they they respect every religion but he he uh went to Jerusalem and put what he called a wish in the Western Wall they put a little paper saying I want to know God more personally and so he had a dream showing that showing him that Jesus was the way the truth and the life and so he became a Christian and he started fasting and he was doing a fast for each person of the Trinity so he was going to do one week to the father one week to the Son and one week to the Holy Ghost and so he started out this fasting process and the lord gave him a dream and said I'm not three persons I'm one and from there he started trying to find teaching about this online and he got in contact with with the pastor we mentored and worked with previously in Turkey but ended up that that Pastor ended up leaving us and kind of turning against us and going into some different doctrines but um that particular Pastor did introduce him to at least the basics of the message and he started following it but then at some point in time this pastor starts on his sermon starts boasting and saying I've got I'm the only one that has the truth you see this guy had a dream and he got led to me and it's a Vindication of my Ministry so anyways this this brother is like this doesn't this isn't sitting well with me I don't like this so he went to the Lord in prayer and asking for direction and he said he saw a man in his dream that was teaching on a screen that was a big guy with a beard and a voice said look for Demars and so he went on YouTube and found me started watching my videos and then from me he ended up finding brother Nehemiah getting in touch with him and that that particular brother he started a little Fellowship in Paris and so uh just started uh got in contact with him this afternoon actually um to to uh to speak with him and and will be interested to see what direction the Lord gives but it it really at that point in time it was just immediate okay now I know what I'm supposed to do keep go forward with the missions trip and be encouraged keep keep uh keep going forward to see how you can help Iranian people so um that's that's how the trip started they are flying from Atlanta to Amsterdam then Istanbul and then right away I think we I think I had uh what was I in in transit for about 20 26 27 hours something like that so slightly exhausting um and got to kaiseri late in the evening and then um met up the next day with brother Nehemiah and uh brother Shaheen which I'll show you a picture of them in a second but I think a forgotten part of Missions many times we think of missions and we think the big services and meetings in the Philippines or India or um uh Africa and it looks fantastic on you know the screen and wow it's amazing but a lot of times there's there's missions that you have to do that's like in a coffee shop or at somebody's house or you know doing missions you got to go and make assessments on the ground or on site I could talk to these people all day long but until I'm face to face sitting down with them you know you can't really get an idea of what's Happening zoom and and Google meet and all that is great but it's just not going to do the same thing giving you know you got to be there face to face to really connect with them give correction give directions by the Holy Spirit you know don't think when you think missions don't always think brother branham's meetings in Africa but think maybe like David Livingstone who's an explorer on the ground seeking soil to break up and place into the ground brother Branham is going to Africa and having meetings like that because David Livingstone went and broke up the rocky horrible ground that you couldn't do anything in to bring to the results where someone can just plant the seed and boom it explodes and so that's kind of what we're doing that's basically what we're doing in the Middle East right now we're trying to the work has to be short so we're trusting the Lord is going to break it up quick and accomplish that purpose quick so brother Shaheen is there on the left we've been working here with him for since 2013. and brother Nehemiah I spoke about good friend and and translator there the message into Farsi I can't even read my own stuff so I'm going to turn around and look at it so yeah the church services are a part of it but they aren't all of it you know sometimes the time after service drinking tea or Turkish coffee and answering people's questions is maybe more memorable for them than even the service sometimes the holy spirit moves and and gets a hold of them and grips them after you've preached the word and broken things down their hearts open now they're asking their own questions and you're pointing them back to the word they're outside of the hotel with brother Nehemiah and brother Shaheen and kaiseri and there with the most of the little church in kaiseri there's a few people missing this this family I'm I'm every time I see him I'm so excited because I think I think it was seven years ago brother Omid and I were there in kaiseri on a on a trip and um got introduced to them and we LED them to Christ and baptized them so to see them walking with the Lord and growing in the message is such a great encouragement um the the Sunday School series that I'm preaching now seven women take hold of one man as I preached that in two sermons there and you know you imagine in the Middle East everybody has a different mindset but I was preaching it and I'm pretty sure they thought I was like the Taliban encouraging them to become the Taliban or something so you've reached something here and you get one response and you preach something in the Middle East and you get a completely around the similar response but completely different approach because where their background is coming from is is totally different so I I'm not sure how I'm going to get this to play but we're going to try uh can we get the sound out of that Caleb can you unmute the computer so this was from the hotel I was very glad to be 10 floors up um there was a warning to refugees not to go on the streets because they could not guarantee their safety because there was you know funny all around the world if you want to suddenly get nationalists support of your for your party you just become instantly anti-immigrant and so this is what one of the not aired one but the other person became and so there was a lot of attacks and and warnings and different things against refugees there and um it's pretty crazy because this this went on until probably 1 30 2 in the morning just I don't know how they hand how do you handle it you just sit in your car and hunt the horn for six hours I was in my room and it was driving me crazy let alone being down there I guess you're excited about politics [Music] [Applause] and it was this this is like the main artery of the of the city and I could look One Direction it was as far as the eye could see this way and far as the eye could see down the other way that they were all lined up getting out and and you could see some rioting stuff happening too so thankful for a good security uh hotel that we were staying in so then after that we went just for a brief time to Denis Lee to visit brother Shaheen's family and speak with them Anna had spent a lot of time when we were into nisley with brother Nehemiah praying and talking about future plans of missions and uh what direction to take as it's kind of a transition time there is a I didn't get too much food in this one I did at least had to get this because we were at brother Shaheen and sister Miriam's house this was the the last time that we were going to be there with them because their Refugee process was finishing and they were going to be going being directed to Canada so I was texting with nehemiah's saying why did we not take a picture with them in their house guess we were enjoying the food too much so so then I got on a plane got to Istanbul and then flew down to Tel Aviv it's my first time in Israel it's Ben gerion airport there in Tel Aviv and again disclaimer I am not Moses or Elijah Hey sir just tuning in now well what are you doing going to Israel we'll talk about it so this is the the zigzags you see there is the it's hard to tell but the the the first one on the far left that's uh Tel Aviv and then up the up to there that's called zikranyakov that's where I ended up staying um and then the farthest one to the top is Capernaum and then the one farthest at the bottom that's Jerusalem those are the different areas we went so there he is I'm just not going to say his name uh here as by his request not not all is as it would seem in Israel for Christians it's not easy to operate there and there is a real movement in their government to stop any Christian activity but they're walking on eggshells because they also know that a lot of their international support comes from Christians so it's sort of they try to keep that portion of it as quiet as possible oh we went in Jerusalem took me to see some different sites this is the this is the tomb of David and um let's see I'm thinking why don't you brother Mark will you pull up that um Upper Room video right outside of the tomb of David is where is the tomb of David is on Mount Zion So when you say Mount Zion in your brain God bless you everyone it's this huge thing way high it's a little it's a hill God bless you everyone matter God bless you everyone we are here in Jerusalem and what's this is astounding I had no idea but right up right up there is the upper room The Acts 2 experience was inaugurated right here and that's what we're to continuous to be another book of Acts we're writing another book of Acts we should say God is writing another book of Acts through his bride in this hour and this is where it started right here Acts 2 experience but what's incredible is is right in front of me is King David's tomb so we'll play this is Mount Zion so on Mount Zion the place where the bride started Acts 2 is right there and right next to it is King David's tomb King's David's tomb is right here they have the upper room experience and he says King David is when Peter was speaking on in in Acts 2 said his Sepulcher is with us to this day but he was speaking of another to come the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand it's the Messiah Jesus Christ that was raised from the dead because David's tomb was right here it's incredible so it was a it was an amazing experience to see these different things and um yeah PowerPoint sorry listening to my own voice in front of everyone on a videos very difficult so pray for me so this is at the Western Wall so anywhere anytime you go into a one of the Jewish holy sites that you got to put on a yamaka there man this it's hot there it's like uh Tucson and with those stones and everything and and the sun beating down it was like I couldn't even couldn't hardly think that'd be in town there and this was this is uh Calvary Mount Calvary and so it's it's hard to tell in this View and it's hard to get to the the place but um just uh you can see those old cave openings that's why they say it was called Golgotha or the place of the skull if you could see the whole thing it would you would you would sort of see and you can look it up on the on Google and see there's a couple eyes and nose you can kind of see an outline of a head and he would have been then crucified on the road so there's a bunch of buses and everything there it's basically a bus stop now but the Damascus gate is right there and right and so it's right this is right outside the Damascus gate and right on basically this is the road to Damascus where the start of it and that's where he was crucified and then behind me is this the garden tomb so it's right and basically in the same facility if you go to the Garden tomb in Jerusalem um on one side they have a sitting area and a plate like a where they you can um like have a service and so forth there by where Golgotha is and then there's another place where you can go where the garden tube is which is right here a great experience around this is the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock is where the Temple Mount is what what shocked me was how small that mosque is is I've been to Turkey and in Istanbul they have two different mosques I mean actually almost any city in Turkey has bigger mosques and than the Dome of the Rock I guess the difference is none of those have gold-plated uh covering on the top can't imagine the expense um I think this is another video that I'll need the sound on [Music] oh you guys aren't used to that sound that's the one I get to hear at four in the morning and all through the day whenever I go to the Middle East but that that is what they call the disciples steps going up into the temple see where that Dome is um that's the Al-Aqsa mosque which is also the location of where Solomon's Temple was so Solomon's Temple was right there right in our Solomon's not Solomon's Temple Solomon's Palace Solomon's Palace was there on the Temple Mount right next to the temple and behind so where I'm standing behind me is what they call the city of David they're Excavating it it's way further down on the level of this it's it's from when David built his Palace there that's where David's Palace was down behind me from right at this vantage point there it is at night and there I am with the brother although I said his name but hopefully you missed it um here we are at Capernaum and the Sea of Galilee went there this is just the countryside in Galilee is quite different than what I imagined it as it's very all of Israel that I was in was ex green and um very beautiful farmland and and pine trees and um very different than what I anticipated so here's the church there in Israel um kind of the some of the history of that there's there was a Russian Jewish Church a number of years back a Russian Jewish Church there and they've been gathering for a while and then there was a English-speaking Church there the pastor of the English-speaking Church ended up um some things happened and he ended up getting voted out and so they were without a pastor and the Russian church was also without a pastor so when the the brother moved there um he ended up being asked by each of these churches to minister to them so he would travel from one side of the city to the other side of the city on the day of their services to minister to each group and he was trying to get them together and then covet struck and they were locked down really hard in Israel and so then they had Zoom meetings and their Zoom meetings were all together so when they started Gathering again they had to find a place again they all decided to come together so right now the services are in English and Russian because they're all like I said they're all Russian Jews but it's soon it's going to move to Hebrew and um in Russian Hebrew and English sorry let's just uh kind of a small part of the group this was our first evening service that we had I think on yeah Friday night so every in in Israel the weekend is Friday afternoon and most of Saturday and so the the week starts again at in the evening of of Shabbat once Shabbat is over some people go back to work but otherwise Sunday is their first day of the first day of the week is they're basically their Monday so for church it'd be very difficult to gather on Sunday so most churches ended up end up having services on um on Shabbat um on the Saturday morning but it's crazy because everything everything is shut down there there's the only thing that's open is gas stations no restaurant nothing else like in the hotel you could go down and get get cold food but they didn't have any hot food and um you could make your own coffee from in from instant but you couldn't get an espresso because it's that would be breaking the Sabbath they can put the food out for you but they can't make any food for you so it's different rules and different things very interesting so um I've known him for some of you might know him but if you don't that's fine I'm happy to talk offline with anybody about him but he's he's a a been a good friend for probably 11 11 years now and he's from the states the Lord it's quite a supernatural testimony the Lord let him go to Israel probably about six years ago seven years ago and he he said Lord You're gonna have to pay for my trip to go because I I don't know how I'm gonna do it so he was he was listening to some Jewish worship music and this trip that you could apply for or or you know enroll in to win so he put his name in he bought the CD or whatever and he won the trip and so he went on that trip well his wife also applied and it was only supposed to be one person that won but they felt so bad for her that they gave her because of her situation she won it she was living there in Israel though so they gave her the ability to go on this trip she was a Messianic Jew grew up as a Orthodox Jew and so they ended up meeting on this trip and just to make a long story short he led her to the message and they got married and they're living there together in in Israel so pray for him he's he's uh it's a lonely walk for sure but the Lord is Lord is leading him there's as I mentioned in the or I read in that scripture there's open doors he had so I better not tell the story brother Matt there's a story here well I'll tell it this brother leads songs and plays the piano and translates the service so we had three services so he comes and before the first service and he says oh do you have any big words that you use um or fantastic words is what he said you have any fantastic words I said brother it's all fantastic words and he goes okay so then I'm preaching I open up my notes and he looks and sees how many quotes there are and he in front of the whole congregation who says oh no and so just imagine I'm trying to read brother branham's quotes but also simplify it for him so that he could so we're not taking six hours to preach a 45-minute sermon and so he is really nervous and stressed out about it and uh it was it was difficult the first night then the next service it was next next morning we had service again and it went very well he did a wonderful job then we then we had a meal in between service and uh we came back and I think he was just exhausted so service starts he's leading songs playing piano gets up to start translating and he makes it like 10 minutes in and I was I was going between scriptures quotes and telling stories and I got to the story and I was saying he said and then the brother said and then he said and he just looks at me and goes do you mind if I go outside and I've had lots of things happen but not that yet on the missions trip so and I said um what's wrong I'm I'm not feeling good and I said sure so he just goes outside so I'm looking at him and I turn and look at the congregation 40 people all eyes on me let's sing a song hopefully some of you know it if not I'll just enjoy myself thankfully I chose one that they knew and both English and Russian so and we sang a few songs and then we prayed for prayed for the brother and found another translator that was a Russian speaker and he came and did okay you know wasn't normally a translator but uh everything's an adventure when you're on a missions trip like this you know you go to another country where the message has been established for a long time they probably have a line of translators waiting to translate but here it's it's uh you take what you can get and trust the Lord anoints the word to the people's hearts so there's a fellowship meal between the time it's definitely a multicultural Church Africans Filipinos Russians tajikistanis here is Mount Carmel and I think we have the video did I send you that video brother Mark but I'm standing on Mount Carmel on the left and the other one I'll we'll bring it up in a minute to replay that video foreign God bless you Saints we're here on Mount Carmel the place where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal the 450 prophets of vale Baal and fire Came From Heaven uh and God vindicating his Prophet here in this spot as you're looking here you look out this way is the valley of megiddo what they call Jezreel now and beyond that you can see the mountains and those mountains are as Mount hormone or Mount Hermon as we know what the Bible is probably the more than likely the place where Jesus went up with Peter James and John for the amount of transfiguration so just an incredible spot to be I was preaching today about Elijah and the prophets of Baal and just thinking what a what a parallel to our day with the spirit of Elijah and God confronting the world with this message and here here's where God confronted Israel to see whether they would Worship the Lord and Obey him and here in our age the seventh Church age God sent a prophet to confront the whole world and let the whole world know receive my word or turn away from my word and he says I'll send you Elijah to the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so he sent the message to the whole world and it's a it's it's a message of Grace but when it's rejected it turns into a message of Mercy all through the Old Testament God sent prophets and those prophets were to be a reminder of God's love God's mercy and if if but if they didn't receive God's love and mercy by repenting and turning to him what was the what was the result it was judgment it was God confronted the ten tribes and later on continued to send prophets and they ended up being sent out of the land and sent all over the Earth and now we're now just to testify of restoration God's bringing those people that were scattered all over the Earth they're brought back to Israel now any time God's going to turn back and begin to deal with this country in the nation of Israel again through the two witnesses and sealing 144 000 with the Holy Ghost so God bless you what a incredible time it's been here in Israel so thankful for this opportunity and uh trust the Lord will make a way for me to be back here again back on the PowerPoint on that last picture on the top of Mount Carmel isn't it different than what you pictured it would be like it's it's a wooded with all kinds of different trees pine trees Etc and uh it's definitely Rocky but in my mind whenever I picture that scripture it's like the Dead Sea area you know where it's just very arid dry but no this is this is not that so the valley I'm looking down at is the valley of megiddo so all the way across that Valley is Jezreel Jezreel is where the Palace of Ahab and Jezebel was at so Elijah ran from there all the way across to that that Hill area um it's incredible to see that and obviously you know the the term Armageddon so this this Valley there that stretches from basically from the ocean all the way over into Galilee and that's the other part is Galilee was you know very rugged I I can tell you this Jesus was a really good hiker because that's some serious hiking you go through those Rocky rugged lands uh definitely a lot wetter a lot more water than I would have ever imagined in that particular area so I'm gonna take 15 minutes God willing to speak on something Proverbs 16 verse 18. we are in uh what the world calls pride month so I thought I'd speak a little bit about Pride and what the scripture speaks about Pride proverbs 16 Verse 18 Pride goes Before Destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall so whenever you see destruction what are you looking what are you going to understand that went before it so you you look in our day and age and you see God's Wrath you know Paul Paul looked at people and saw their behavior towards the gospel looked at the Jews saw saw their behavior towards the gospel and he said the wrath of God has come upon them to the uttermost so you think well what do you mean they were living their life just a normal life and everything was just as usual but Paul here boldly speaks God's Wrath has come upon them to the uttermost why because of their response to the gospel your response to the gospel Kicking It Away pushing it away you're already in destruction and even further than that is if you don't receive the Gospel you were born in destruction you were born in the condition where you're under God's curse I think the scripture says anyone that does not love the Lord Jesus Christ let him be anathema anathema means under God's curse so if you don't love the Lord Jesus Christ you're under a curse that's the fact of scripture and you're not going to love the Lord Jesus Christ until God does something with your heart until he draws you to himself opens your heart and fills you with the Holy Ghost you'll you'll never have a true love for him that's not something we by Nature do I was just born with a nature to love God no you were not you were born with the nature to run from God to be proud to fight against God to fight against God's Authority in your life just ask the teenagers or the parents of teenagers if they think that their children are born with a nature to love God and respect God's Authority they're not they're born with a nature to rebel against Authority and so that's the that's why we need the new birth that's why we need God's mercy and so when you step over God's mercy and you rejoice in sin and Evil destruction you're living in destruction already whether you've seen the results of end results of that you're walking and living in destructions this country celebrating pride month Pride for what perverted Acts that's what they're proud of and every business is seeking to celebrate being proud of perverted Acts that's ultimately what this is about it's not about love They Don't Know What Love Is they have an idea of what love is but it's an absolute perversion and God hates it he said he hated it it's an abomination in his eye in his eyes and when you're walking in that Abomination you're walking under his curse and so you're just you're living over of that of God's Wrath that's when you're it when you're walking and living in that condition and so pride is is a is a thing that is literally the greatest evil it's the reason why there's sin in the world it's the reason why we suffer it's the reason why we're living in a world like we're living is because an angel was exalted in Pride against his maker C.S Lewis writes according to Christian teachers the essential Vice the utmost evil is pride unchastity anger greed drunkenness and all that are mere flea bites in comparison it was through Pride that the devil became the devil Pride leads to every other Vice it's the complete anti-god State of Mind it is pride which has been the chief cause of misery in every nation and every family since the world began this is God's viewpoint on Pride what is God's viewpoint on pride month James 4 6 says moreover he gives greater Grace for this reason he says God sets himself in battle array against the arrogant and haughty but gives grace to the humble and lowly what did that say God sets himself in battle array in the King James it says God resists the proud that resistance is not just merely that God's pushing against it it's it said he's saying he takes his sword he unsheaths it and he goes to war against it so he that arrogant and haughty Spirit God despises Pride Pride they're in the streets dressing like perverts doing perverted Acts and they think this is something to celebrate they will be destroyed the country this country is going to be destroyed the evidence of their destruction is the fact that they're rejoicing in those things I'm sorry about your YouTube account brother we have to preach the truth and what God's put God puts on our heart and to be arrogant and proud of your Acts it doesn't matter what act it is it could be a small thing or it could be a big thing but to be a proud and arrogant of your sin is shaking your fist against God too often though a person that struggles with pride doesn't see it in their own lives doesn't identify it but very frequently they're the most skilled at finding pride in others and pointing it out in others you know in a Christian atmosphere people aren't a hundred percent prideful because they've at least acknowledged there's a God there's a Creator there's someone I have to be obedient to there's someone I have to submit to and yet in when we walk in Pride we become blind to the fact that you know we're doing part of God's way but we're doing God's way our way that's usually the problem that happens you've humbled yourself to a certain point but then after that you're not willing to surrender yourself completely to God I think honestly there's probably rarely any more sins that are more concealed to us Than Pride you know all of us hate extreme levels of pride in others I say that with you know the hatred in the right sense we we don't like it we we recognize it and we say that's deadly that's dangerous but it's easy to recognize it in others but what about ourselves Pride is being selfish you know think let's let's think about one great example Peter in Matthew chapter 16 verse 23. Peter just finishes stating the great Revelation that Jesus is the Christ the son of the Living God that that's that's fantastic he surrendered to that revelation then the next minute Jesus is going to challenge him and about what does that mean that I'm the Messiah he says I'm going to be rejected and I'm going to go to the Cross I'm going to be killed I'm going to be rejected Peter says it'll never be that way Lord it'll never be that way oh my that's Pride you don't you don't say to the lord it's not going to be that way I'm not going to do that I've been guilty of saying that the missions trips that I go go on initially in my heart it was Lord I'm not going to Turkey that's too dangerous that's Pride does not surrender so here Peter on the one hand is surrendered on the other hand speaks his own mind speaks his own heart and what does Jesus say return to Peter and said get behind me Satan you're hindrance to me you're not set in your mind on the things of God but on the things of man pride is being selfish pride is accept thinking about yourself excessively about yourself Pride's Foundation is too much self-love Pride thinks the worth of ourself is higher than it actually is pride is preoccupied with our own image or our own self pride is really narcissism in other words we're Your Love you're in love with your own self-image pride is self-centered it's egocentric everything revolves around me and everybody that everybody everything that everybody talks about is about me [Music] Pride wants to keep the focus on self that's what that's what pride is centered on me my thinking my thoughts my feelings my emotions those are real that's what that's what America has turned the truth into you listen to him well that's your truth no that's your emotions your own ideas your own feelings that's not truth truth is objective reality truth can be recognized by everyone if their eyes are opened truth is out there to grasp hold of there's no such thing as my truth and your truth that's emotions yeah but as a nurse that's the gospel of narcissism the gospel of self-centeredness just imagine we live in a world you where you say a woman is a biological adult female well that's your truth it's what it's objective reality but you say that and you'll if you're a college professor you don't have a job and what is it it's it's a it's a complete embracing of the maniac Pride the maniac of pride is the god of this world Satan is the God of this evil age he is an absolute Maniac named Pride truth matters nothing power Authority control is what matters to the devil and it's obvious he's got a lot of people under control his control Philippians 2 3 and 4 in the NLT says don't be selfish this is what we as Christians need to do don't be selfish don't try to impress others be humble thinking of others as better than yourselves don't look only out for your own interests but take an interest in others too we're in a look to the interests of others we're to seek the blessing of others pride is seeking our own self-interest humility is the opposite it's the emptying out of self I've said this before but you think of it like a thermometer when the thermometer is completely full that's Pride you're full of self when the thermometer is empty that's humility self is emptied out and surrendered it's not just emptied out we are not Buddhists but it's literally it's surrendered to the Almighty that we would be of service to him to be a help and a blessing for others if you're living to bless yourself you're not living for Christ you're living for pride pride is unteachable it gets irritated when someone tries to instruct it pride refuses to own a fault Pride refuses to listen to the advice of the ideas of others Pride manipulates situations using emotion Pride manipulates others using guilt you owe me or I'm this to you so therefore you should do this to me Pride uses self-image as a reason why their children should obey them or look the part hates being told what to do Pride wants its own autonomy to decide when they will and when they won't submit to the word pride is a person he has to be recognized for what you're done what he's done or else he feels hurt and angered when he doesn't get the credit for what what he's done Pride hates sharing the spotlight Pride takes credit for things they didn't do or didn't even think of Pride brags about their own Ministry in a very humble sounding way Pride claims I'm the best at a certain this thing and they'll take their time to explain every detail why they are the best I'm I'm not listing off the EV the attributes of Donald Trump's I'm not stop thinking that Pride is a person that feels certain tax tasks would be beneath them and they would lower them in other people's sight Pride likes to drop names about people in your circle so that some of their notoriety will rub off on you pride is not interested in getting to know and connecting with others it's aloof uninterested Pride constantly thinks of itself and what others think about you also people who are extremely sensitive have another form of Pride sure they're easily hurt because they think everything's about them and how they should be involved how they should be leading how they should be participating Etc these are things that uh on every on some levels some of them cut all of us cut me Jonathan Edwards writes the first and worst cause of errors that abound in our day and age is spiritual Pride this is the main door by which the Devil comes into the hearts of those who are zealous for the advancement of Christ it is the chief Inlet of smoke from the bottomless pit to darken the mind and mislead the judgment pride is the main Handle by which he has hold of Christian persons and the chief source of all the Mischief that he introduces to clog and hinder a work of God spiritual pride is the mainspring or at least the main support of all other errors until this disease is cured medicines are applied in vain to heal all other diseases so true how quickly Zeal goes from from being enthusiastic about the things of God to being hey you're not doing this and you're not doing that and why aren't you doing this and hey you said that to that one and why did you looked at me like that you know that's the that's the approach is no how about yourself you know the Revival should start in me the change in transformations to start in me and so if I'm zealous then that should rub off on other people I shouldn't have to throw rocks at everybody's head to get them zealous because that's you don't you know you don't trap uh a bear by making all kinds of noise and trying to get rid of them you throw out a bunch of cakes and stuff to to try to draw them in and you know you want to make somebody else zealous for the gospel you should do it in a in a in a way that is enthusiastic that spreads not that a way that condemns and tears people down Isaiah 57 15. for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place I love this painting such a picture this is Isaiah 57 15. painting such a picture of the greatness and the majesty and the glory of God and it's all to set up the last part of the verse which says with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones amen isn't that beautiful the greatness of God is his condescending to those who are humble but remember this is God's attitude towards the humble right he condescends he comes down to revive them to build them up to strengthen them but to the proud he takes out his sword and he girds himself to go to war against the against the proud so just which one do you want to be do you want to be proud and have God as your enemy or do you want to humble yourself empty yourself out surrender yourself to the Lord be as low as you could be to let him flow down to where you are God is God is like a river it flows to the lowest parts right that's where God's going to flow to the lowest parts to the most humble musicians if you come William law writes there can be no sure proof of a confirmed Pride than a belief that one is sufficiently humble also if you want to find out how proud you are the easiest way is to ask yourself how much do I dislike it when other people snub me or refuse to take any notice of me or shove their ore in or patronize me or show off amen let's ask the Lord to to search our hearts let's ask him let's stand let's ask him to reveal to us if there's any Pride within us and for him to cleanse us from that and Lord Lord we come to you and Lord we just want to get lower and we want to be more humble Lord we want to see more of your Holy Spirit Lord we we often pray and we ask Lord to send Revival fires into our hearts Lord well we learn tonight what what an incredible key to that Revival is is we we need to have a humble and contrite spirit Lord that's where you go that you the high the lofty one who inhabits eternity comes down lord and even in Isaiah 66 you say you dwell in the one who is has a humble and contrite heart and who trembles at your word Lord may we have such a spirit of reverence we know this age battles against any kind of reverence and fear for you Lord but I pray that you'd give us that that true reverence and that true fear of the Lord which would tremble at your word Lord because we want to have you dwelling inside of us not Pride but we want to be emptied out of ourselves Lord that your Holy Spirit would flow through US Lord move in our hearts Lord May that just this not just be a word spoken Lord but it may be a reality to us Lord search our hearts move within us Lord we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen is worship Holy Fire [Music] burn away [Music] a desire for anything that is [Music] of me I more of you and less of me hey [Music] [Applause] Jimmy [Music] [Applause] [Music] with

so we're just believing for a complete and total healing that this episodes that he had won't had it won't happen again but I just want to give the Lord praise for touching little baby Judah [Applause] so uh I think so but I don't know foreign for a couple week vacation for our for our anniversary and uh somebody asked me what my favorite part of Ireland was and um I thought about it and uh this testimony goes back to right before I came down here I was working on my truck in Idaho and I don't know what I did but I blew my knee my right knee out and for for a while I thought it was like bursitis but it like lingered and it's been this way for over a year and a half now that I've I've been down here and it's like there's this ball right where your quadrice where my quadricep attaches and it's like the muscles balled up it's it's hard when I flex it I and I don't know I guess I could have gone to the doctor but I hate I hate even the thought of that and I just asked the Lord to I mean a year and a half ago I asked him just to to help me and heal me but um so I've been putting it off and and a and I don't really notice it unless I like walk even up the steps here it's like ooh and I have to like throw my weight off of this leg this foot and kind of Step Up well um Ireland has a lot of steps like in those castles and stuff and it was starting to really um bother me and uh I told Emily I said when we get back make me an appointment and I'll go to the doctor you know finally after a year and a half I'm I'm I've had enough and uh but my favorite part of Ireland there's this waterfall just off the off the road and there's a pathway that goes down to that waterfall and on that pathway there's some rocks you kind of have to step up and over you know to get to this uh really pretty waterfall well I I stepped up on one of those rocks and I stepped off of it and my right foot was still on the Rock and I stepped down and I don't know it hit my leg just right and something in that knee popped and it felt like if you uh took like a tourniquet and put right above the kneecap and just cinched it down like with a stick in there just tightened it as tight as you could get it and she was off somewhere else I was by myself but I let out a good yell oh and uh I thought man I really did it now but like a little later that day or even the next day I think it might have been I realized this feels different and uh and now that that ball that was always there it's getting smaller there's still a little bit of discomfort in there but it is totally different than it ever was and uh I'm just trusting the Lord to heal the rest of the way yeah you know all the symptoms praise the Lord that's awesome thank you I just wanted to give the Lord a praise for answering prayer still an ongoing situation so I'm not going to really get into a lot of the detail about it but we've been a lot of prayer for our children different ones and some of the situations they've been in and and um you know the Bible says if you have even the faith of a mustard seed if you say it in this mountain it'll be moved and sometimes you don't see the whole Mountain Moving one time but you know maybe one stone one one rock here one rock there so I'm claiming that I'm seeing it and I just thank the Lord for what he's doing already God knows all about it so I'm giving him praise Hallelujah anybody else get inspired all right so our daughter's been struggling too and they had a there was an incident and she called us and we were just trying to be encouraging to her and I can't I mean yeah all the details or whatever but I said Spirit she was on speakerphone with us and I said Steve will you just will you just pray and we just he started praying and she's crying and I'm crying and he has this beautiful prayer we're just seeking God and the Holy Spirit was right there in our room and then I I prayed after he was done and um she called us was it that same day she's oh my goodness that I just have to tell you that that worked that changed the situation it turned it around praise the Lord it was a direct answer to prayer and she's in a pretty I mean she's struggling so it was amazing that she could see God in that praise the Lord [Applause] man let's there's a couple more requests that brother Matt mentioned and I forgot to pray for the Watkins so let's pray we'll uh I'll pray then we'll Worship the Lord and you can be dismissed at your leisure gracious father we come before you now Lord and we want to lift up these requests Lord we pray for
