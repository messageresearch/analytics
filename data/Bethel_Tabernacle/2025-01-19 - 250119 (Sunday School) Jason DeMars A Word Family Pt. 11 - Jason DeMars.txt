TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Psalm 127 verse 3 Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your light in this hour Lord we know that Darkness even gross darkness is covering the Earth Lord but we also know that you've said in that very same verse that AR arise and shine for thy light has come and so Lord in the age of gross Darkness your light shines even brighter to your elect Lord thank you for that pray that you'd reveal yourself more and more Lord that you'd speak to us this morning Lord and that you'd be glorified in our midst today we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated as we finished last week um abruptly because I was going to a different not last week two two weeks ago uh finished abruptly a little bit early because I didn't want to go into the next topic um we're going to be looking at uh God's heart and attitude towards children and again I think sometimes you have have to come with a few disclaimers we understand there's different situations we're not here uh to tell you how many children to have when to have them how to have them but just simply announce to you what the word of God says and what attitude the word wants us to have different situations different people but the main thing is that our attitude should reflect the same attitude that God's heart has about children amen with the understanding of what is our what is what did God create us for what was the original purpose what was the design for man and woman when we can see that and understand that we can see God's attitude towards children another aspect of it I hear often uh and it's very very uh culturally based and personally based but people start having a few kids when they first get married and they quote brother brandom what he said to Billy Paul as though that was a Doctrine he didn't give you the full responsibility to replenish the fill up the Earth of course uh it's a little bit of a joke uh not a Doctrine um and and we want to see what God's attitude and heart is and more than just that quote what brother brandom speaks about it so we're going to look in this sermon um invisible Union brother brandom says speaking of the day that when women couldn't no more wouldn't no more want children were living in that day they want a dog or a cat or something like that but she don't want children anymore did you realize that brother brandom proph side about liberal cat ladies she don't want children anymore why she's old mother hubard if she has a child see she don't want that's the remarks of Hollywood it don't want his woman to be an old mother hubard so she'll he'll have some operation performed to himself or her one that'll keep them from having children they don't they don't want no children Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at that time they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on us she'll practice birth control so she can go to parties she can't be bothered with a baby nursing her it'll disform her when she's pregnated it'll be it'll it disform her she won't doesn't want to look like she used she won't look like she used to and her husband ignorant enough to let her go that way she won't give him a child Jesus spoke of it and he said that when they were doing this at that time they'll go to crying then for the rocks to fall on them it's the coming of the Lord they pay great sums of money for cats dogs to mother this is obviously a very prophetic statement and a a very uh much a fulfilled prophetic statement of God's prophet and this has become the attitude of the world world today towards children they're an inconvenience they interrupt your life and even this same kind of attitude can permeate into the Christian Community they interrupt your life they're they're difficult we'll have kids and then let's hurry let's hurry through this process and get rid of them so we can go back to doing what we like to do it is a spirit of selfishness it's a spirit of Pride it's a spirit that that's against God's heart God's mind and God's attitude uh towards children and and unfortunately we can easily fall prey to this I think we need to ask the Lord to cleanse our hearts and our minds our children are a gift amen they're a blessing and from anyone that has any perspective with the Holy Ghost they could say please soak up every minute of your your children enjoy them the the the love that you put into them and the sacrifice that you put into them will pay the dividends to you later hundredfold in questions and answers law having a shadow uh a baby's and I don't want to again I don't want to go into the Weeds about birth control if you look at this quote brother bham quotes about birth control I think we can generally say what what brother brandham said which was he's not for it right and then on the other hand he said there's certain situations where it would be a catastro would be would mean death um but he said he he said he didn't want to make that a public statement he said caseby casee basis but he did a number of times make BL blanket statements that he was not in favor of it right but he said I want to talk to the person individually so again we can look at it as in general number one is we can can look at the big picture and say birth control wasn't what was created for a purpose I don't believe God was the one that created birth control birth control was created right in the midst of the time of the maturing of feminism where we don't want the responsib we we either want to prevent the pregnancy using birth control pills and of course this obliterates a woman's system obliterates her body not functioning the way God designed it right and secondarily they they wanted if they couldn't prevent the pregnancy they wanted to have abortion when when first birth control was legalized next abortion was legalized I got a little bit into the weeds but not too far brother brandom says a baby baby's a baby when it's formed the very first germ in the mother's womb it's a baby I'm firmly against birth control see yes sir for where it's just as much to take the life of a little baby that ain't two months old as it is to pull a pistol and shoot a man down in Cold Blood murder yes sir I'm against birth control what God sends God will take care of Amen notice now that is wrong to do that now the baby's right there it's a life for the first germ of life is in it which it'll only be the life that'll enter lets other Spirits in then the baby becomes begotten it's little muscles quiver and jump and twist like that then that's the next thing then the water the blood and then it has to when it breaks the little lungs through just as the natural baby is born there's a spiritual body at the side of the mother to give the baby a spiritual life amen from the very moment of conception that's a baby that's a human life it's not somewhere down the line at the very moment that happens that's a little human being made in the image and likeness of God and it's absolutely evil and it's taking a life as the prophet said it's murder it's coldblooded murder it's not women's health care it's murder amen this as we y'all are quiet this morning it's making me nervous maybe I'm making y'all nervous the Bible says that a woman is saved in child childbearing and as we looked at before it's not that me that childbearing is the means of her salvation the means of her salvation is the same as same as any elect of all ages and that's only through the blood of Jesus Christ and it comes to us as a gift of faith he gives us Faith amen it's his calling it's his work in our hearts and yet we understand that there is an aspect in motherhood or or in Womanhood where part of her out working should God choose to give her a child will be how she administers herself as a mother and as a a her attitude towards the children and how she behaves it is not the means of her salvation but it's the outworking we're created in Christ Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them what better work is there than a than a mother to Bear a child and to raise that for the gospel that is a that is a foreordained before the foundational of the world work that he's placed upon mothers and of course also fathers you think about the attitude towards children and the attitude towards the value of life in the hour that we live in they want to take the life of a baby so they can have their life whatever that means but the true expression of motherhood is she is willing to impart her own life for her children that's real and genuine motherhood and it's also an expression of the Bride we should be willing to offer our own life on the altar in order to find that last predestinated seed and well if I have a child Everything Will Change that's right that's right praise the Lord you'll stop being so selfish amen having getting married and having children is part of the sanctification process if you're a true child of God one of the predestinated seed God will use that to hone you and mold you and shape you amen nothing's made perfect without suffering but at the same time you can all understand sister Jean is it worth it all it's a treasure and as the baby grows in mother's womb nutrients are taken from her body goes to the baby then the byproduct the waste comes out of mother comes out of the baby into the mother for her to process it through her body of course her body grows and changes shape because of those children that's part of the process we we think we think of that our society thinks of that it's deformed no actually you're fall you're coming into your correct form husbands make sure your wives understand that she's coming into her correct form the the the the into the work that God had before ordained for her to walk in and the fact is there's a great Beauty to that I think we should understand that reality and that should be part of our thoughts not you're getting big are you gaining weight are you this negative attitude about pregnancy this is part of this is the worldly way of thinking we shouldn't think that way we shouldn't talk that way it's a great blessing to a grow a child within within your womb and there's a great Beauty to it that can never be repeated outside of that then of course when the baby's born mother goes through great pain in childbirth and her body's changed forever she begins to nurse coming forth from her body she feeds her children this is this is the most amazing incredible process that we that we can be a part of it is magical brother Kevin and a mother a true mother with the Holy Ghost there's a love that she has has for her children that is unexplainable and inexpressible it goes far beyond understanding she cares for them she feeds them she teaches them this is what should be lifted up as as great as wonderful as a blessing now of course God can ordain that a uh uh someone be single for their life and God has a purpose in all of that but as the prophet said there's a perversion when the vision of a woman is I want to remain single and I want to have cats and dogs the the the the selfishness and self-centeredness now I know I know Christian women that weren't able to have children and that's not but that wasn't their heart's desire that was n't their passion but God by his Providence so designed that and we honor them as well and real men will see what their wife has gone through is going through am and it will be everything within his heart that he wants to take care of his companion his best friend and his sweetheart he understands what his responsibility is in this process and he knows that he must guide his family as we said before young men all men when you sign up to become a husband you are now a teacher you are now a priest you are now a worship leader that is to be your function in the home if you didn't know that before now you know it now it's your responsibility to correct if you love your family if you love your wife if you love your children you'll correct them not with pride but with humility knowing your own weaknesses amen you'll be someone that listens when when your wife is struggling or maybe when she's nagging you you should shut up and listen because maybe you weren't listening and now you need now it's your CH chance to sit down and listen closely because sometime sometimes it's a neag and sometimes it's a cry there's a cry that's going out sit down and listen to your wife and hear what she has to say cuz you'll find something out you might learn something we should understand that that men as the stronger vessel she's the weaker vessel don't look at as it always as an annoyance look at it as a chance to be together because the reality is you're supposed to complete the image and likeness of God together in Oneness right in your Oneness and out of your Oneness the image of God is manifested expressed and multiplied and it's not just a physical Oneness it needs to be beyond that it needs to be a spiritual emotional emotional mental Oneness that Finds Its expression in the physical act which produces offspring and then we find that that is a blessing and a fruit of that Oneness Christ and the bride ma the manifestation of God himself it's not just Christ before the foundation of the world Christ was first right but what was next you in him the elect in him a part of him we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and this is to be the very expression of life and the multip multiplication of that life and that's what family is either you're thinking or you're annoyed or uh you're listening okay we'll go with that brother Luther a modest kind holy Godly Meek and quiet woman is the crown of her husband and even as we look at scripture she is literally the crown of creation the very last thing in the process created was the it was the woman a man was made to rule to be strong to love and provide and care for those under his authority a true Godly family is the Pinnacle of creation not presidents not the White House not Kings sure they can be a part of it but they're they're no more the Pinnacle of creation than one of us humble people God Delights in a true family where the Holy Holy Ghost is the center and the word is the absolute Psalm 127 pull up my PowerPoint again verse three we read it already we'll read it again Lo children are in Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward amen as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that H happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate again we've developed this attitude in Western culture children are an inconvenience now they don't have this attitude in eastern cultures but in in our culture and we are seen really the death of our culture I don't want to get going too too much on that but because of its departure or maybe I will get going a little bit on it that because of because of the rejection of the word of God in Western culture you find in in in Europe in America um we've turned away from the principles that God has laid forth in his word and when we turn away from the pr principles God has laid forth in his word then that that culture dies and the gospel I think that as I observe this and see this the gospel goes around the world starts in the East goes to the West travels back to the east again and as we as we see and observe that um some of the very first places that received the gospel and it became all-encompassing to that culture is the Middle East turkey Syria these different places and the you know this is where we find Antioch and Asia Minor and galatia all these places and they became areas that everyone was fully Christan Christian paganism was totally rooted out and yet as time went on they turned away from the gospel went to a formal religion intermixing paganism within it and when that happened God raised up judgment what was it the Arab conquests the Muslims and I I used to think in Turkey here's a perfect example of it in Turkey what happened was the Muslims didn't come and convert the Christians the Muslims came and replaced them and pushed them out and it was down to so so very few uh Byzantine Christians left that as time went on they literally went out of existence as not just as a faith but as a people we see the same thing following suit the Muslim again we're getting into the weeds but we're looking at the reality of what's Happening into the world Muslims are moving and instead of marching with armies we're just going come on take over our countries it's it's like what we would call cultural suicide and that right along with that is the hopelessness where people don't even want to get married and have children this is an evil and perverted it's a sign of judgment that's what brother brandham told us it's an absolute sign of judgment and we're finding that but God forbid this be the attitude in the bride of Jesus Christ amen regardless of the death of our perverted culture amen that's become so evil and regardless of the hope that uh some might feel that's coming tomorrow in Washington DC the reality is the change does not ha happen in politics politics is merely a reflection of what happens in in our homes and in our families amen and we as Believers of the word of God we go the way of the word regardless of what the culture around us tells us the culture tells us children are inconvenience and a difficulty and they change your body have cats and travel the world but scripture tells us that part of children are in Heritage of the lord they're an inheritance God is God is giving you of what belongs to him into your hands to raise that's what your children are he's committing to you his children to raise them up for what purpose for him amen so that they would know him that we have to realize that's our function as parents the function as parents is not to get them to school and make sure that they have food the function as parents is that your children would know the Lord that they would be raised in a home where worship isn't just on Wednesday and Sunday but worship is every day and that they're being established in the word by their father and mother and those children they're not just um little bundles of joy for us to enjoy their arrows yeah in other words there something that has to be aimed there's something that you you want to defeat the Devil raise up children that serve God then when you release them that's an arrow that strikes the enemy amen and even even goes to the place so are the children of the youth have kids young that's not my own Doctrine that's what the word says have children young if you can happy is the man that has his quiver full of them has a lot of them amen you shall not be ashamed well in in American culture practically you you know you have you have more than three kids or two kids are like my you have a big family wow all right I need to finish and I want to get to this quote from the presence of the Lord Jesus brother bam says on her Road she heard about this Elizabeth her cousin is going to have a baby so she runs up in the hilly country of Judea to see her it was a great honor then to have a baby it's a disgrace nearly now I'm not balling people out I Don't Preach by any notes I don't know what I'm going to say just I have to reach up and get it and when it comes I just have to say it that's all I know to do but today it's a dishonor almost to see a big family anymore yes sir they'd rather pay $100 for a little snotty-nosed dog and pack it around and give it the love of a mother and practice birth control than to have children think that was something old going hang around to the barrooms and drink and play cards and run run around all afternoon in your husband's car why it's a disgrace that's right the greatest honor a woman can do outside of coming to Christ and being loyal to her husband is to have is have a baby amen you might be nursing a little preacher how do you know Hallelujah I know that's oldfashioned cornbread type but brother it'll stick to your ribs amen it'll do when you're dying it sure will amen so the Bible and brother brandham upholds having children as a reward and a blessing from God and an honor it's a the man that has his quiver full of them is blessed I can even remember going into hotels when we're traveling for Ministry work and I you know those those carriers you got them just full of people and all these men are business guys are walking by and they look at me and they frown and they say oh I'm so sorry and I it made me mad made me very mad sometimes I'd say sorry for what oh you got to do all that and have all those kids and I was like it's this is the greatest blessing of my life yes it's hard work but this is a blessing not something to be sorry about amen let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your goodness Lord for your mercy we thank you for blessing us in so many ways Lord we pray your Holy Spirit would just brood over your people today Lord that you would be with us in the worship and in the preaching of the word Lord be glorified in our midst we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen [Music] h [Music]
