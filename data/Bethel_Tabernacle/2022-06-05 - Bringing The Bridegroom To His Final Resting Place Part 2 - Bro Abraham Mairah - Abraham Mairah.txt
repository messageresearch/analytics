love is that what you want emanating and pulsating from here is love and the love of god i remember when i first gave my heart to the lord it's appropriate to share this it's just a one minute story there's a brother that used to witness all the time to people and one of his favorite things now i know you're not south african brother but there's a south african statement that preached the gospel and he used to shout it out all the time when people were preaching kupandapa kupandapa and i just feel like saying tonight koopandapa you want to hear the gospel preach tonight amen praise the lord [Music] bound here i wander through a world of pain and fear but there is a place that waits for me with open gates crafted by the hands of him who died that i'd be saved i wanna go home i'm getting so homesick down here i'll try to hold on till you wipe away my tears [Music] place i've never known but i wanna go i wanna go home [Music] it's getting darker every day i've seen so many lose their way but loved ones wait beyond surrounded by a worship song they called to me to come and be back where i be long i wanna go home i'm getting so homesick down here i'll try to hold you wipe on my tears i never thought i could miss some place [Music] down here i'll try to hold on till you wipe away my tears i never thought i could miss some never known but i wanna go i wanna go home [Applause] [Music] but luther come on up buddy pray over the ties and the offerings let's sing that song it is well with my soul amen if you're a young person in here and you've never read the story about that song and why it was written do yourself a favor and go look up that song it is well with my soul and read the story for yourself you will be blessed and you will be touched [Music] you want to go home amen there's a time coming we'll wipe away all tears i mean it'll be over say take comfort child that is well done amen let's pray father we love you this morning i am so grateful to be counted as one of your children father though i may stumble and i may fall father your hand still holds that anchor will never let go and lord as we come together this evening so expecting to hear from you so expecting you to move amongst us as you already have and lord as we come together the tithes and offerings i pray that you and bless it magnify it to the kingdom it is a small form of worship father the greatest form the ministering of your word we pray that you magnify it to our hearts we love you bless these people those that are streaming father in jesus christ's name amen [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] thou has taught me to say [Music] my soul [Music] is [Music] hallelujah solution science in the name of lord jesus christ and i believe everybody is doing fine so far by god's christ we shall just go straight to having a word of prayer loving heavenly father once more we are gathered here in your house as people that you foresaw that they would be here and we are thankful lord for the breath of life because the evidence the lord you know we still can become better christians better believers and the lord you've led us here in your own discretion and leadership and i do pray the lord you'll come because what else can i do but just stepping out of the way the lord you'll come and have your way with your people whom you loved so much that you died and suffered for uncovery no man can ever claim to love us or to even be more concerned about us than you so lord may you come down and take over again this evening and be the reality that blesses your children that it transforms them that exhausts and encourages and strengthens that emboldens them in the face of the moraling enemy for we know that god we must only go as overcomers and we are only going to share your seat with sitting with you in thy throne when we have overcome and lord help us because we know the first person we have to overcome is ourselves bless the reading of your word and anoint your servant in jesus name amen you're still following up with our scriptures that we're ready here on wednesday and the title be the same maybe just part two song of solomon chapter three from verse one by night on my bed i saw him whom my soul loveth i saw him but if i phone him not i'll rise now and go about a city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him on my soul love is i saw him but i phoned him not the watchmen that go about the city phoned me to whom i said so he him whom my soul loveth he doesn't write the answer that they had in other words it was relevant it was very little that i passed from them but i phoned him whom my soul loveth i held him i would not let him go until i had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her that conceived me i charge you ye daughters of jerusalem by the rose and by the hands of the field that you stand not up nor awake my love till he please now he's talking about love as a person because charity that is christ the capstone is a man and verse 6 he says who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with mars and frances with all powders of the merchant behold his bed which is ceremonies thrisco men about it of the variant of israel they all hold his words being expat you know every man has his sword upon his thigh because of the fear in the night we went through that last time and i wanted just to go back again a little bit in the book of matthew chapter 13 in verse um 25 let me read but while man slept his enemy came and sold tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blood was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir they thou not saw good seed in the field from whence then has it tears and he said unto them the enemy has done this i just wanted to end there may god bless his word and bless you may be seated now the enemy has nothing has no interest in the field until the field has been sold with a good seat the enemy had no much interest in you until you became a child of god just like you are just like an ordinary person are healthy valuable because you have the birthright it's only when the birthright is taken away from you that you become nothing but when you have the birthright you're something special blessed be the name of the lord so now we look at this we talked about this sometime i mean on wednesday so i'm just going to skip a few things and pick just a few verses that i want us to still look at we saw the watchmen we knew that they had left their posts they are you know you know guarded posts of duty that's why they had no answer now the woman didn't say preach me a good summon about him tell me convincing quotes about him tell me your testimonies about him tell me what you know about him but the question is where can i find him where is he and i think that is where we've come to as the bride of jesus christ i mean good summons good songs that's wonderful go to preachers influential experienced perfectionists that's wonderful we found god for them but where is he that's what i'm looking for that's why you are here you cannot be the bride when you have not set your eyes upon the bridegroom when you have not really touched him the bible says that which we had from the beginning that which we had that which we saw and that which we have handled with our own hands of the word of life so the bridegroom has to be united with a bride and it has to be a reality it should not be an assumption we are moving from the grounds of assumption to reality so that you are standing on the ground that you know i'm standing on the solid rock solid ground and those are the people that they're very scared of they never is not scared about when you are moving from pillar to bust looking for truth looking for this and today i want us to go back to this scripture where he says he she had just passed them in other words he was beyond them he was beyond their rich they were the ones who were supposed to have really pointed out to her where he is but because they have backslidden from their god posts they are also working on the level of commoners glory be to god and that's why when we have today i was sharing a verse where the prophet says i mean it's called where the prophet says if you've got a pastor that tells you the truth that points you to reality points you to jesus stay there and respect that man and love him because many are failing now to point you to him where is he who is he how can i get to him amen and we have come to a time that we are not going to point people to our churches let the people find that he is in us he we have got him then they will follow us like the prophet says just live a life that that makes you the salt of the earth until you cause the fast in the people because they have tested the salt glory beer oh god so now this woman where does if she find him she finds him whom her soul loves beyond the watchmen glory be it oh god and that's what i was preaching in lima i was talking about what did you go into the wilderness look for and i was talking about receiving the mysterious reality of the more than prophet ministry they were ending at the office of the prophet they all took john the baptist for a prophet they took jesus for a prophet but that didn't bother i mean it benefited them so knowing this prophet like he's a prophet you can do it you can know him 30 years 20 years 50 years but that is not enough you have to go beyond the office of a prophet to what this prophet pointed you to so we thank god and brother brother was not just a prophet he was more than a prophet because he was a prophet messenger he brought a message and the message that he brought was he pointed us to christ he introduced christ to us so i mean why are we trying to focus on the prophet he said this he did this he accumulate he because people are stuck he met didn't at the office of the prophet they are trying to examine the prophet well the prophet is just a victim like i said he's a victim because he didn't want to be a prophet he didn't want even to preach this message he said i would rather even like i'm skinned than even to say it but i i'm obligated to say it not because i want to say it but because i have to say it so now you see when you begin to focus on brother brahm the man there are very many mistakes and god allowed them to be there to blind those who are going to look at the man the office well he said this he did it he did it he behaved like this you are very right you may even have quotes to point out where he's wrong you are intellect you know intellectual enough to find faults just like you could be intellectual enough to find faults in jesus and a man of god including jesus himself was god in flesh if you would go to him using intellectualism you'll find what faults and god purpose them to be there could you imagine brother jason coming here or going to any church here and he finds people doing wrong things that he whips them out what would you think with your delicate hypersensitive american lifestyle someone comes with a whip and a sharp sharp and with a very angry face come on mr perfect love we have not seen love today so if you are looking for fault you would have got it but he was not wrong he was right but physically morally he's not like the good good or the kind of priest like brother brother talks about him the good old kind priest who was sick when he was who came to see you when you're very sick and you were in the hospital good old kindly priest who is he that kisses your babies when they are crying and you know soothes them and shows them good all kind of priests who is he that comes and sits by you and tells you you know good words that you want to hear good old kind priest and then all of a sudden there comes some man with a whip and he whips people out of the temple who do that be your pastor would you go for that man it becomes very easy for us actually to believe jesus today and we would have believed when he was there physically i'm saying it if brother jason would stand here and just say you all devil get behind me sure and you have just called it the same man blessed are thou simon by jonah because flesh and blood has not revealed this but my father in heaven has revealed in the same chapter a few moments ago he's a blessed and now he's all devil get behind me satan you call him satan a ki believe in the church not in the pastor's office but public in the church among others at least he could have had the respect to call him in the office he shouldn't have told me that in the presence of other people now what does he mean how does he expect those people to look at me when they look at me every how to how do they think about me bring it in the common sense common reasoning you would find a lot of food for her from that and there are very many people who have left the church for very similar statements what about if they were to call you saturn that is the jesus you believe would you have to do that if they were you you were the one to be called saturn let me give you another example he tells the disciple he says when i sent you the other time did you go with anything nothing now i want to tell you that if you don't have a sword then you better sell your clock and buy one jesus tell us the disciples and they know that our lord is telling us to buy swords so they sell their clocks and buy swords and then the next day the opportunity to use this sword maybe this is why he told us to buy the swords peter pulls it out and he cuts off malka's ear and he's like surprised jesus put it back they that leave by their sword shall perish by the sword and then he picks the the peace that he has cut down and he puts it back on the ear and heals it what do you think did he trick us did he tempt us did he what did he mean by if you don't have a sword sell your clock and buy one and now he turns around today and he says well if you live by the sword which he told us to buy if we live by the sword and he's the one who told us to buy then we shall die by the sword so that means he wants us to die by this lord because he told us to buy this what you do have a lot of common sense there but peter never answered the word one day he was asked if he would also want to leave his head to whom else shall we go he doesn't say because you are the best ex you know ex you know teacher the best preacher the world has god you have the best pastor no he says thou alone has the words of life so now you see this woman is looking for reality and the church today is looking for reality and until you have got him you are in trouble i want to tell you sister brother until you got him and brought him in your mother's chamber which is the holy ghost chamber because we proved the other time that your mother's chamber the holy ghost is your mother and your mother's house or mother's chamber is the body and then when you get him and bring him in the body you are now safe no man is going to deceive you you got reality no no no psychology no manipulation no explanation no scientific interference will no examination of the prophet nothing because you go to him you got him already he's in your room he's here blessed be the name of the lord and god waiting if there is a tomorrow we shall find out why is he here why is he not elsewhere so he says he gets him he says i can now not let him go that means you must be very careful not to do what can make him go and now he she gives a little glimpse of where he was because not only was he in the streets no he came from somewhere into the streets just because she was in the streets this is explained in verse 6 where he says who is this that cometh out of the wilderness so he came out of the wilderness to meet him to meet her in the street and he came you know he said she says who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with mar that is death the anointing of death when he comes to you you should be ready to die mar was and frank says where the perfumes that way for the anointing of the dead so he only comes to you this time when you are going to accept to die you are going to be anointed you are going to share the anointing of death you die out then his life is manifested in you that's what it's meaning he doesn't just it's not just available in the streets he's coming from the wilderness and this is the same man of whom this question was asked when he came to jerusalem who is this the same question who is this was asked when jesus came triumphantly into jerusalem and all the denominations the sanhedrin the preachers will say who is this so the who is this was the bridegroom that this woman was looking for blessed be the name of the lord but who were asking in jerusalem when you read i think luke chapter 21 they were saying who is this who were asking that who is this the clyde the sanhedrin the preachers the pastors blinded by the nominations critics and dogmas and they don't know him they don't know the man whom this woman has been looking for blessed be the name of the lord so she comes i mean he comes from the wilderness and i want you to look at something from the wilderness there's something special about the wilderness because if we go to luke chapter 7 from verse 24 quickly if i can get it look chapter 7 from verse 24. i want us to examine something about the wilderness jesus saying here in verse 24 and when the messengers of john where departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john and he's what is he saying what way out into the wilderness for to see glory oh god there is something about the wilderness and that's why every genuine prophet of god loves the wilderness he's not in a a place where people are packed and strips and and you know where everything noisy places where people go on the beaches and you know places where people want to be he's always in isolation but there is something he's doing in the wilderness which is on a temporal basis why in the wilderness and jesus says what went he out in the wilderness for to see is a reed shaking with the wind and then he comes but what went he out for to see a man clothing soft raymond because they which are gorgeously like a parody and leave this delicately in the king's courts but what went you out for to see a prophet yes yes i say unto you and more than a prophet this is he of whom it's written behold i'll send my messenger before thy face we shall prepare thy way before thee and he says i say unto you among those that are born of women there is no reason there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that's least in the kingdom of god is greater than john he's talking about john and in matthew chapter 11 he says if you are to receive it this is the elijah this is the elias who was to come but this very john had denied that he was elias i'm not going to enter into that that is another someone somewhere that i preached but there is something about the wilderness that these prophets always go to moses phoned him in the wilderness and the back side of the desert so was always elijah in the wilderness elisha would go to the wilderness john the baptist from the age of 9 to 30 years when he introduced jesus he was in the wilderness himself was a wilderness man he would only come to jerusalem but go back to the wilderness brother branham was a wilderness man and he says when i'm there i'm i'm very calm and refreshed why blessed be the name of the lord so if you come here i i wanted us to come to something what the prophet says here blessed be the name of the lord in the wilderness he comes here in the message spirit of truth i think he preaches it 1963. he says he's talking about you are the other part of america alaska it says and then on then from then on 600 miles the way the crow flies and there's not even a path or a trail and when you hit the west coast you go about 800 miles to vancouver and there's not even a speck of civilization and the next civilizations going this way is anchorage about seven or eight hundred miles go back this way you run into a little city yellowknife where you get a ship in there once a year for the eskimos and next you hit russia now i want you to listen what he says so you are he's talking about why he wanted to go and heidi there he likes to be there where he's very far away from civilization all sides hundreds of miles away he wants to be by himself there so he says so you are really to yourself that's where god can take his rest that's where god can take his rest up there from all of our troubles and the trials that we put him into glory be to god god rests there deep away the wilderness and you see what a prophet says so i would like to go up there and talk to him when he's resting resting from what from all our troubles and trials that we put him into he flees away from a troublesome nagging church he sees you quarreling with your wife pushing her arguing around he goes to the wilderness that's where the holy spirit always flies he descended he doesn't have to go back he's here but he goes somewhere and that's why these prophets always know where to find him and that's what i want you every brother and sister here to know that you are not going to find god in a multitude you are not going to find god in the common places you are not going to find god in this use of places you want to be where everybody wants to be you are not going to find god's presence in those atmospheres that the world enjoys you can go an extra mile an extra mile now i'm talking about spiritually do you know that prayer is an extra mile do you know that fasting seeking god is an extra mind putting aside cutting off yourself switching off your phones and everything and you see today we are so connected to the world that you even feel like switching off your phone for one hour two hours in the service it's too much but those are the streets that he is not there you are connected to the people you will not find god there you only find spirits and demons and wrong influence but there is a place to go and you have to put in effort he's hiding somewhere you'll find him and he'll show up to you when he's coming from the wilderness and the prophet says i want to go there talk to him where he's resting from our from people's believers he includes himself so he projects himself from the group and he goes as an individual so that it's not god is not now dealing with our problem but he's going to deal with him as an individual amen blessed be the name of the lord amazing now this is a quote which is very interesting and i've always wondered why and this is the first time i'm speaking about it first time i knew about it a long time but i was always wondering why the prophet say this why he wants to go and hide in that place where he's thousands of miles this way no civilization hundreds no civilization no civilization he's surrounded by himself and he says in that wilderness is where god takes rest from our troubles and trials that we put him into like we embarrass him all the time we ashame him all the time we speak nonsense we argue and stew and fast until the holy spirit is grieved where does he go he goes to take a rest because here he has not found the rest there has to be certain things put right until this one becomes his resting place and that's why i was calling it the rest the final resting place do you know that you don't own yourself according to first corinthians 6 18 says this body is not yours you don't own it you are bought with a price you are paid for it belongs to him but we are scaring the owner out of his body out of his temple and we are welcoming demons we are welcoming spirits we are copying and pasting lifestyles of non-believers make believers you know masquerade us and we are chasing away the dove so brother branham in order to get the fresh message to hear directly from god he knew where to find him so you love those places where everybody wants to go watch out i was hearing brother yesterday yesterday speaking and he was saying everything that we do even what we call a habit is a spirit no habit no act no thought no do no work that you do lacks the spirit behind it so you have to ask yourself is this the spirit of god or my spirit or spirits that i copy is it a christianity like brother balaam calls a church spirit this is how we clap this is how we do it so i want to do it like sister so and so this is how the other sister dances this is how the brother i i like it when brother jason shakes his head and says hallelujah i want to copy that so why did he wanted to go there let me repeat this so you are really to yourself and i want to tell you friends you will know your relationship with the good how it is when you remain alone in that house or in that forest or wherever you are and you start to sing and you start to pray you will know either you are just a hypocrite a masquerader acting christianity or you are a real christian those moments when you are alone it is always very easy for us to get in the spirit when we are singing together like this it's very easy that's why it is very easy for for for you to come here and and dance and sing and clap but when you are alone can you do it when you are alone do you sing do you enjoy that song the way you know like like like i was telling one brother somewhere he says i want to go and sing for this ch the church in this song i said you have to move away from singing for the church and you sing for god let the church just benefit because they are there and god is in them but we don't sing for the church we sing for god and if you go beyond singing for the church and you are singing for god then wherever you are that song will be as sweet as meaningful as impactful and even more maybe with the tears maybe the prayer then you can find it in the church here but you'll find that when you go back to our homes we are very dry we can't even sing you do you are busy knocking up your plates and sausages and spoons and so forth but you don't even sing a song maybe it's only when you're annoyed and then you want to spiritually you know press the spiritual appearance and then you want to scare your husband or your wife whoever annoyed you that you are in the spirit you should be careful so you begin to sing a song and i say amazing grace that save the sinner like me rich like me to condemn him because he was rebuking you you know so god is rich like me so you better be careful i may be not perfect but i'm god is i'm god is rich you know so you may sing a song just to intimidate someone but you are not again in the spirit so he says so you are really to yourself you and him so how do you feel there how do you talk to him how do you relate to him how long does your prayer take does the fire catch up or you just struggle and struggle on your own and begin repeating yourself how do you feel when you are alone have you ever taken a trip to the wilderness have you ever taken a trip to the wilderness you that wilderness i'm not meaning the alaska one now this time a meaning and a wilderness where are you and your god you are alone cut off aha i've seen here in america you have a good custom way when someone wants to come the author is maybe confessing or repenting and the family members want to accompany that person i mean it's all that he feels the solidarity of the family they are praying together with me that is good but i mean what about if you went alone because if it is a scene you did it alone you are responsible as you it's not wrong for someone to escort you but have you ever sought god alone do you know that when you when if you go to god as you you'll be more sincere and you speak more words and you repent more better than when you are accompanied by a group do you know that we have we love our our our pies and our you know all these things that you have you have hamburgers and pies and we don't have those so you have a lot to choose from now have you ever if you're a young man have you ever even fasted 24 hours ask yourself a question have you ever waited upon god for even a day jesus asked the disciples can't you pray with me just one hour and they couldn't in that crucial time one hour he comes he finds them snoring sleeping they were not because he would leave them to pray by himself and he comes back they're sleeping that's why they would also be very spiritual when he's around and when he's not you remember the time they brought that epileptical boy and they could only cast out the devil and then jesus says how long would i suffer you people you are always very spiritual and vibrant when i'm here learn to go to the wilderness so you are really to yourself that's where god can take his rest up there from all of our troubles and try us that we put him into so i like to go up he doesn't say with my wife i like to go up there and talk to him when he's resting you see so that when so so then when like it was last night on the ship he's comparing when he was on the ship you know jesus rested slept on the ship and the disciples went to him he didn't come to them they went to him master we perish save us blessed be the name of the lord so he is in the wilderness so what did you go into the wilderness to see have you seen him have in any case did you ever go to the wilderness have you ever gone there as an individual and if you have not how do you see him because it is only those who went who are having an answer to this question so but also it depends on whom did you intend to see so there are those who went to see mr perfect mr smartman mr intellectual mr oretta they didn't find him and that's why when you come to this message and you want him to look to sin brother brother mr intellectual mr perfect mr dis they are trying to look at him and they think brother branham was in the wilderness introducing himself no he was in the in the wilderness interacting having fellowship with mr jesus whom he's introducing to the bride that's why he says i loved going to the wilderness to have a talk with him so who was the main person in the wilderness it's not the prophet no it is this man so whom did you go to see where me i saw i went to receive him and saying yeah okay if you received to respond to receive the message what was the message of the messenger have you got the reality of what the messenger introduced to your avent god if you have any god then there is a problem blessed be the name of the lord so here he says you know like the man from the east like we said on wednesday they came but when they thought they are going to find him in the streets of jerusalem they start left to them how did they follow the star it would have led them somewhere else not in a powerful hotel not in a powerful hospital but in a little cabin somewhere in a manger in the bush where the animals stay nothing attractive about it but there is where god of all heaven was so when they went to the places they thought he was they missed him and they start after them blessed be the name of the lord and today we may even think if i got to this man if i went to this man if i went to this man which is good to look for good ministries you can come and be another pastor like this one whom i respect but the problem is are you just going to be under the shadow of that pastoral ministry or you are interested in getting a hold of the reality that he's presenting just saying well i am in bethel tabernacle and you think you'll draw you a comfort from being in bethel tabernacle you are not having reality because at bethel tabernacle we don't come to meet a man we come to be introduced to the other man jesus christ himself blessed be the name of the lord so now i want us to look at this where do you find him the prophet continues among our kindreds among us the baptists methodists presbyterians so forth see if you find it no sir you don't find him amongst our king's folks so you go beyond your king's folks you go beyond family religion you go beyond my dad was a pastor my dad was a minister the message my mama received so many visitors our home we grew in this mercy you must have a personal experience with you that you have met him not just you grew up in the messenger family no you can't find him among her relatives no sir the only way you find him is the way that mary and joseph phoned him where they left him glory be to god he says that's where they they find him and that's where you find him they okay where where did they leave him at the pentecostal feast hallelujah that's where the church will find him again go back to the feast of the of pentecost go back to the outpost the pouring out of the holy ghost and there you'll find the power of almighty god you'll find the risen christ you'll find the signs and wonders of him just exactly like he said he would be the works that i do shall you do also you you shall not selected a few but you these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you know they shall lay their hands on the sick and the sick shall recover that that as long as you believe that that is for you it's not for pastor son so brother swan so deacon so and so preacher so and so no so he says that if you don't have them then you have not yet found you have to press on to get ahold of that so he says you'll find signs and wonders of him just exactly like he said it would be go back to where you phoned him go back to the beginning and he comes here he can say where did they find him where did they find jesus right where they left him where did they leave him the feast of pentecost where do we leave jesus where did they catch at the feast of pentecost when we get away from the old time pentecostal power and the feast of pentecost we walk away from jesus that's exactly right friend we are living under our privileges yes sir this woman realized she's living under her privileges because here she is in the night but the love is not there how can i be the bride of jesus and this is a time of darkness i need him more now than ever before my life is at stake my family's life is at stake my future is at stake i need him now how is it that he's not here i must put right whatever made him leave me i must create a conducive atmosphere for him to come back but what how will i create that i will have to die to myself because he's coming with the anointing of marr and frank since to share with me that anointment glory be to god so he says they left him and let me leave this he says so where is the joy of the lord where is the power of the lord the church asks today what what happened to the god of history he's waiting for his people to call him on the scene we can't do it through denominations we can't do it under psychology we can't do it under arithmetic we can't do it with education we separate ourselves we divide ourselves we are not divided we are one person indeed in christ jesus we are all one and then says our denomination is we never do it as good as they are they won't do it our education is the greatest hindrance that the gospel has ever had his education what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the holy ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power jesus never said go into the whole world and teach he never said go into the world and do you know he said go into the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is to demonstrate the power of the holy holy ghost the power of resurrection we are still a million miles short than where we should be why he's hiding millions hundreds of miles in the wilderness somebody has to go and find him and that's why when they asked him by what authority by what power do you do these things he puts them back he points them to john the baptist he says what the baptism of john what was it was it of man oh city of god if it was of god and you didn't receive it that's why you are asking where i come from what authority i have i'm just simply the manifestation of what he introduced and you people if he had received the tune as did the message that he brought you wouldn't be questioning who i am so now the ministry the glory the power the anointing that was with the messenger or in the days of the prophet becomes history to us and you say where is this where is this what is this and yet the prophet doesn't do what god is going to do he only reveals the secret of god god surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophet so the prophet simply reveals what god is going to do so but he reveals this mystery to who behold i send you elijah who is the you are you in that number so that means whatever god revealed through this prophet that he's going to do he's going to do in the person who receives this message this revelation so he simply demonstrates what he's going to do he reveals it but there is more to do when god himself takes over when god finds the resting place okay now when you have found him then hold him tight glory to god i feel like reading something here in the book of john chapter one in the book of john chapter one you see he says here in verse 44 now philip was of besider the seat of andrew and peter and philip findeth nathanael and said unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph a wilderness man jesus of nazareth nothing good coming out of what notherest the city of barrenness the seat of the poor they rejected when i was in israel in 2006 even our guide wouldn't want us to want to he wanted to want to lead us to that city because up to now it is a city of those with the debt the unsuccessful the cast blessed by the name of the lord and this man was not even wanting to go there but that's where jesus was in the place where many people don't want to go and it was called jesus of nazareth and you can see the triangle that blind is the educated the intellectual they were already living in others but when the time for marriage to deliver was about to come the census and taxation forces them to go back to their roots and she goes back to bethlehem to fulfill the scripture that this baby is to be born in bethlehem and then from bethlehem herald wants to kill and they flee to egypt and then from egypt back to nazareth so you look at that triangle from nazareth to bethlehem bethlehem egypt egypt now the rest so now it's blinding these people nothing no prophet can never come out of nazareth get it to us get it from us out of god in the arises no prophet saw this thing thunk sunk into the people's mindset they were like it is true it's written so it was blinding but that triangle was done on intention on purpose go from nazareth because you are not nazarenes but go and deliver in bethlehem according to the scripture then persuasion will arise and you hide in egypt then from egypt you'll come back to nazareth and the boy will grow up being called jesus of nazareth not jesus of bethlehem because if he was growing in bethlehem they would have said well maybe because this prince was supposed to come was supposed to be born in bethlehem but now they could search the scripture intellectually and find that he doesn't qualify but the messiah the messiahic signs were with him he fulfilled all of them and even challenged them he says search the scriptures you think in those scriptures you have eternal life but they even tell you who i am if you don't believe me for what you think i am believe me because of the works but they couldn't because they had their own evidence so that's why you today you should not even be surprised there are very many people who are finding it it's hard to you know to receive this message or even to you know become this message in the time of becoming the message because they begin to scrutinize the origin talk about brother branham of los angeles or new york but he was from indiana uh-huh jeffersonville what why to blind the people blessed be the name of the lord so we are looking at something here that i want us to follow slowly so when you find him hold him the bible says hold to that which is good that which has been given you don't lose it so this man he doesn't say i i presume we could have found a man that is like a prophet if you can come and you attend his services with me we shall sit down and compare our notes after the service and see whether he is the messiah or not the man is confessed he says we have found him and it's very positive to tell another even when he's around comes up with reasons and questions and he says i don't have time to explain him come and see in other words when you were that bride you was phoned him you were caucasus but you must have reality that these people who are argumentative will come and see if their ordained life like this man was this nathaniel the moment they'll come they said this is it regardless of all my former theology that they taught us he couldn't be from nazareth he couldn't be from galilee but i've seen reality i can confirm you people have found him and he ended up saying you are my god you are the messiah and so forth and jesus just because you have seen that you now believe you'll see much more you'll see much more blessed be the name of the lord so we have found him it's our standing today if you haven't then seek him in the wilderness but when we say we have phoned him then we are sure of what we are talking now i'm not looking for the truth friends i'm not looking for another message i'm not doubting this message i'm not here to tell anybody that i have to look for check this checklist nothing because like for me god led me supernaturally to this message and when i came to this message i have never found anything like it if there is a problem the problem is me the problem is not his message so we have found him we have found the truth we have found reality we are in the on the right ground but now when you find him you don't end just on saying i phoned him but you have to lead him to your mother's house that is the final resting place don't just say we've got the truth we've got the truth because even those who are falling from it they used to say we found the truth we have got it we know this is the truth this is it this is it this is it but time will come that will not say this is it this is it we have it but this is it this is it it is here i am it and it is me that's why i was saying sometimes when i when someone said brother have you seen this woman who says she's explaining why she left the message i said i don't even mean to listen to that they left the message because they got the message because they believed the message they were with the message but if they had become the message they would not leave the message you become it you are eat and that is it i said brother if i am received then i am comfortably deceived comfortably deceived but also on sure ground because show me a message that can bring word by word and put the message put the bible like this message show me any other preacher any other ministry that was vindicated beyond what this messenger was indicated these are a bunch of cowards show me let them do the disadvantage the prophecies and so forth they are hand picking a few gray areas what about the millions and millions that are untapped and as i like i said john the baptist the prophet said never even performed one miracle he didn't even heal one case he didn't even okay he was a prophet what prophecy did he give what prophecies apart from just connecting prophecy prophecy with reality what did he join the baptist do moreover his ministry was just six months six months so she tell him in the prophecies that he prophesied that came to pass tell me the miracles that he did and yet jesus says he's more of all that we're born of women there's no one greater than john the baptist so john the baptist was greater than moses rather than elijah greater greater than all those prophets with no miracle recorded to his credit and you talk about a ministry with millions of signs and wonders and then you am i so stupid to begin to doubt it just because some intellectual brain is pissing up some evidence against it come on we are not a badge of ignoramuses we are not idiots may that we believe this message by knowledge it's by revelation and revelation cannot be indoctrinated or brainwashed it's finished so this is the time we phoned him okay what did you do with him when you phoned him what did you do with the message when you found it what did you do with this who is this i have found him who is he he's jesus where is he he's here with me he is not supposed to be just there with you well he healed me this he gave me this he blessed me with this he did this he gave me this don't look for signs that is harlots those are daughters of jerusalem we are going to come to that the daughters of jerusalem want to wake him up out of the sleep that is out of the rest is resting in you by pointing to what they have interest in a man the daughters of jerusalem are like those girls who went with esther to king our swearers and they wanted gifts and because they asked for gifts they were given gifts but esther didn't ask for a gift she wanted a man because he knew when i get the man all that he has his mind but the hallows look for gifts as long as you have the money you give the gifts and the harlots will just you know swarm around you that's why this woman he didn't already say we have food i have phoned him but i held him tight glory to god and led him to my mother's house the final resting place and locked the doors and then he says shh this is now the seventh seal silence the invisible union of the bridal the bride and the bridegroom take away your nonsense i don't want to hear your noise [Music] hallelujah i don't want noise i've suffered enough i've toiled enough i've looked for him i've phoned him i've brought him to my my mother's house which is this body is now here in the temple because this is the temp of the holocaust and the holocaust is my mother and i have brought him in my mother's house he is resting and when he rests i rest but how does he rest he rests by doing what i can't do he does what i can't he he he takes over my impossibilities and he makes them possible he takes over my thinking and begins to think for me the mind of christ is now the one in remy my mind is gone i don't have my own thoughts coming i don't have my own intentions coming he's here he's resting but he rests by doing what i can't do and how does he do i season he increases i die that's why he came with mar and frank says anointing for the dead he's coming to anoint me death confirming my death so that he lives in me and if i have accepted to die so that he lives who are you to disturb his peace and you know you women if you love your husband and taking a nap you'll tell the children shh daddy's sleeping let him rest let my man laugh i mean my old man rest you cannot just be making a lot of noise like a parrot with neighbors and visitors and you know your husbands he requested that he wants to take a nap sister sister you come and say cities i'm in this world my husband is resting okay that's you know this love there my love is resting you daughters of jerusalem you bunch of adults noisemakers street strollers who told you to come here to make a noise glory to god oh i wish i was a good preacher like brother just said another year so he better come and take over now street scrollers swaggering around in the darkness looking for men because they don't have the man and now you have come here you think there is this man also available for you and you want to come and ask if if you can wake him up this is my darling i respect him take away your nonsense you are using the questions is is he the reality is he the right one do you think you have got him you think you do you think you have got jesus do you think you have got the truth do you think this message is true do you think this man really whom you think is a messenger was true please take away your noses i don't want nonsense yeah i don't want to hear your noses i don't hear i don't know what here knows my master is resting he's here glory to god let's go back to the bible go back the book of song of solomon he says i brought her him to the chain he brought her in the chamber of hearts that he conceived the okay verse five i charge you you daughters of jerusalem believe us i'm reminding you i'm telling you i charge you daughters of jerusalem you know those debtors of jerusalem according to isaiah chapter three they were walking tinkering and missing as they go on high heels and bungles and everything and the bible says because of the dot the daughters of jerusalem are haughty and big headed and those are disobedient brutes they claim they belong to zion they claim they belong to jerusalem and jerusalem means they set the seat of peace but they are not peace makers and peace promoters they are coming with noise so how would you claim to be a daughter of jerusalem when you are bringing noise when you are disturbing the peace of him who is resting in me how can you trouble my heart in other words i'm shouting my ears to any other voice i don't want any voice that troubles my heart i don't want to hear any statement any other person to sow any seed of this creep and say here this bed this room is sacred it belongs to jesus it belongs to him who loved me and whom i love with all my heart there's i'm more than persuaded hallelujah and nothing shall separate me from the love of jesus i am his and his mind and i know we are one so what more do i else need you daughters of jerusalem you backslidden believers backslidden so-called christians coming to disturb my peace with your words to disturb my lord to to to affect my faith because now i i am not the one who is the believer he is the believer of himself they believe of his own word it's not my faith in him it is his own faith the faith of jesus in me the faith of god enemy you cannot shack me i know where i'm standing i know i've got him he's here so the only work i'm now going to do when it comes to defending his peace i'm going to swing him into action you are going to see how furious i am you are going to see how tough i am in defending him that is in me you are not going to trouble this one you rather trouble me but don't trouble that one abuse me but don't abuse that one say all evil about me but not that one that one let him rest he's in my mother's house you daughters of jerusalem you claim to have peace peace peace peace when you are troubled makers you claim to have a revelation you are just you know perverts what revelation do you have which other revelation can be greater than this revelation the revelation of the revelator and the revelation himself is dweeting in me christ in you is the center of revelation glory to god i judge you you daughters of jerusalem this should be your message to the daughters of jerusalem they are trying to incite a reaction from you so that you begin to doubt the one that is already in you they are beginning to question if he is this why is it not this if he is the true one show me what gifts has he given you me i want a man who give me gifts show me the gifts that he has given you and i will prove he's the right man and this one says i'm not interested in gifts you know i'm interested in him and i got him and when i got him do you know that the pallets will come that day with the evidence of gifts lord i performed the miracles i spoke in tongues i translated i saw visions i saw this i did it this i did this and he says yes as hello of course i never knew you you never received my seed i was not in you your ground was not protected it's a ground for every tom road to go there so you cannot claim lay any claim on me you are a bunch of backslidden daughters of jerusalem coming to say lord didn't we prophesy didn't we do this uh-huh glory be to god so i charge you he daughters of jerusalem by the rose and by the hinds these are animals fast animals in other words you better run away as fast as those animals that's what i'm tying you to use your legs very fast and give me space please just like a hind or a road run run like it put your legs in good use give me space i'm keeping a very important person in my life here i don't want this useless negative degrading rhetoric i charge you i commit to you that you get at least that anointing of a kind or a row run as fast as you can leave me before i pull my sword glory be to god i charge you oh by the rose and by the hands of the field that you stand not up wake nor wake up my life till he please my my husband i don't rush him whatever he wants to do for me he does i don't nag you promise to me you promised to buy me you promised to buy me a shoe have you bought it you promised to buy me this now you said you are going to buy me a sandwich no he only does it when he knows the right time so i don't disturb him i know he understands i know he loves me i don't put him on pressure i don't nag him no you are a bunch of nuggets glory to god putting god on pressure lord if you don't do this for me this month i am going to quit the word you are not a believer even if you don't save my mom and my mom dies you're an unbeliever i will also live the word no no no no that's not the way to approach god god is not going to be forced like pentecostal hallowed you hear them saying i command fire from heaven now in the name of jesus i command your healing i come who is you to command commander who we only can command the devil command the spirit to leave not command the holy spirit how can you command your master his servant is never above his master how do you command your husband because you're an american woman that is the american spirit but we are not americans americans have died and rotten can someone say amen do that yes so you don't have to take a advantage of the american spirit you say you are now the boss if you play around i'll divorce you and when i divorce your ministry is done no just because you know what the bible says if you divorce him you don't use it as a beginning tool you don't take advantage of the bible to exploit a situation for your negative prophet i mean you know self-consciousness no this is not how we behave huh you know i you need me more than i need you who doesn't need the who he said i i was talking with one woman i said pastor you know what i think he needs me more than i need him i said but why did you travel all the way from your home to his home to his house you needed him how fast i can do without marriage the very first easy days that you can't stay without marriage that's why you're married that's why you married you married because you wanted to be married and now is the devil just bringing you you know some prestige in your mind i can't do without him fine you can do without him but limping it you'll not be normal you'll be abnormal [Music] okay what they call a new normal but a new number is abu numa so i charge you leave him let him do his things in his own time now he i have already talked about this now he comes here when you come to the final part in the book in verse seven he says behold his bed which is ceremonies fresco valiant men are around about it of the variants of israel they all hold swords being expat in the war not amateurs every man has his sword upon his side because of the fear in the night so there is a fear as the night goes into the day and everybody should protect so while men slept what does the bible say about us should we sleep with those who are sleeping no you are not going to be excused and say lord i slept because it was time that others are sleeping no because when you come i think it's in the book of first thessalonians something when you come to first thessalonians chapter 5 first thessalonians chapter 5 um here is what paul says um chapter five let's see here first thessalonians chapter 5 let's hear from verse 5 he says oh let's begin from verse 4 but he brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief you are all the children of light and the children of the day you are not of the night nor of darkness there are four let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith now he's talking about arming yourself with a protective wear of faith and love if you don't love him whom you're going to stand for how will you protect it how will you defend it how will you fight to keep it you must be in love faith then laugh and he says and for any element the hope of salvation so we are not among those who slept while men slept the enemy came and sowed the seeds seeds of discrepancy they were not supposed to sleep there was supposed to be watchman over that watchman over that garden and now look let me take you to the practicalities of that story that woman was not supposed to keep her husband to defend him from the daughters of jerusalem had those watchmen been at their posts but because they are now they have left their guarding positions they are moving around she had to stand to defend this thank god we have men who are still defending and telling you the truth that this is the truth thank god we still have brother jason here but you know some of his good friends have gone in america and canada and europe in africa bacca there in here at home do you know that people are using money here taking advantage of african poverty buying preachers out of the message because they have left the message they are sending money there can imagine that kind of spirit if you think you are right leaving the message it has come to you why do you why don't you leave that person oh why don't you preach that to that person to get the revelation why is it that you are using your money to buy out someone from the message of course some of us cannot be bought out i don't care whether you gave me a million dollars you can't buy me out of this but there are those who are weaklings who don't know what they are up to and they are selling out and people are going on there in their churches they are tearing out all those images they are taking out message books and burning them and doing this and it's going on brothers we knew because somebody has given them what look at that spirit it's very serious than we think and we are not going to hold it with the kidney gloves let everyone be armed with a sword because the bed must be protected can you imagine that bed of king solomon who was the type of jesus was surrounded by 60 variant men solomon had over 1 000 women which is the type of christ and the churches in different places but all those women could not have another man that's why those women had eunuchs keeping them but there was one particular place they would meet solomon and that place is surrounded protected no man can sneak him taking advantage of the men and women that solomon had but we thank god our solomon today is everywhere he's not like they had a physical solomon who was only with one woman but at a time this jesus is with every church he's on every part of it he's bringing the truth as long as you have got men with swords to protect the ground and you have to hold your sword this word is the word of revelation that that one that cuts and pierces into the thoughts of people and exposes this has to be protected we are not going to look at the devil just marauding around we have to take on the enemy and defend your ground the prophet says cannon and all the promises were the children of israel but they had to fight for every inch of it they had to to fight for every inch blessed be the name of the lord now i want us to continue here you know and he comes here he comes here in the message why christ speak he says god has got a purpose of you being here see if you can only be or get to that place that is recognizing the purpose of your being here he says how much trouble you save god and yourself to can you imagine serving god a lot of trouble of course we read where the prophet says god hides in the wilderness he's going in the wilderness because of the trouble that we put him into but if you can save god from this useless adult this trouble then that means that is the medicine of keeping him here you save him a lot of trouble you don't oh good do this lord what you know what to do i mean we are not going to ask god to smite people dead to throw them into trouble and so forth if they are the serpent's seed they have to be there we are going to know what to do make our lives this bodies this mother's house to be a resting place so that god doesn't have to hide the rest in the wilderness you've brought him from there and he's now resting here and nobody disturbs his peace you save god and yourself a lot of trouble when you know why you are here so the bed chamber let me finish here he says it must be guarded by valiant men glory be to god and there is no other man valiant more valiant than the life of christ himself expressing through you that is the variant of all men so you don't need physical men this time to keep your life not that the corners will make sure oh if who is who's that one talking to you if you don't talk to any man you should not do this hey you know this though shall not thou shalt not that age is gone it's now him in you taking full charge of you and you dying out all your reasoning and then he comes here the prophet says he's trying to say like he's bringing the type of the new testament he says the first beast was like a lion the second beast was a calf and that is a young cough and the third young ox and the third beast was the first of a man the fourth beast was a flying ego just exactly the tribes of israel camped around guarding they were afraid gods of the right to the ark oh hallelujah don't you see it here master city master city nothing could come anywhere around it without crossing those tribes crossing what the lion crossing the man that is the intelligence of the man crossing the ox crossing the ego the swiftness of it the heaven the earth in between all around you see they are way guards above it was the pill of fire brother nothing touched the master seat and he comes of course we know this beast in the new testament like matthew was the lion and mark was the ox and then we know luke was the intelligence of the man because he was a doctor and john was the flying ego they guarded the testimony of jesus christ whatever matthew did not write mark comes and fills the gap whatever marker doesn't bring in luke brings it whatever look who doesn't bring in john or this one confirms what this one has said and also repeats it to confirm that out of the witness of two or three let every word be established and then we have those spirits those four anointings upon us the boldness of a lion you know and the strength of the oaks and the wisdom the intelligence of a man and the revelation of an ego the vision in the church today to be embodied in you to protect the masses city because he is seated in you now glory be to god and he says all right and he comes here we now we are living in another age glory oh i love this age don't you now god has a master see today to be guarded you believe that where is the master seat found in the heart of a man where did it come in the heart in of heart of man in at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost which is god came into the shaman heart is that right now let's mark this down and get ready to draw it into okay he says all right guarding the master seat now has god got guards for the master seat today now that is a beautiful picture i mean that's watch how beautiful it's rolled out so god is also guarding this some guarding in press but how do you conduct him to come i want to finish by that because if you got the bible there are beautiful types there let me leave this when you go to the old testament i will just quote it you know the story where you realize somehow i mean um david when he was deposed from being a king he became the rejected king a fugitive but when he was to come back there was a general feeling among other people i mean let me read this in first second samuel chapter 19 verse 9 and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he's flared out of the land for absalom absalom is today's judae's career that's why he's the second person to hang himself in the bible in the old testament to be hanged conditionally he didn't hang himself but he was hung just like he thought fell who betrayed jesus i mean he betrayed everything also hanged himself so you find he turned against his own father and deposed him now he says the absolute whom we anointed over us is dead in a battle now there are for why speak you not as not a word of bringing the king back and the king david said to zadok and to a beast of the priest saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are you the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house you are my brethren you are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are you the last to bring back the king so the king can run away by himself although he went with people but he cannot come by himself he has to be conducted back why should you be the last one to invite your king back you are the only born of his bones and flesh of his flesh you are him the bride is him you should never be the last to become the tabernacle of the king don't wait that you come the last the last is always not the right position for me and the question is even the king would have come back but he says why are some of my friends the last to speak about my coming back i want to come back but i want to be invited back i want to be conducted back led back to my house so they had to go hundreds and thousands of people to lead the king david back to the palace and they would read him how how do we lead our jesus back you can only go to him invite him by repentance by dedication by devotion by worship by praise conduct him back into his house why should you be the last one and yet we sing the song while on others thou art smile eileen do not pass smee bar why should he smile on others why should he see others feel others transform others in the where others and not you you have to conduct him back like that woman went and met him and held him and led him to the mother's house who don't you want to conduct him into the house today that is the question how many want him back if her tori is out and the prophet says if it is be filled and be refilled and refilled don't even say well it's not history well i was filled with the holy spirit in 2010 it was the march of in the month of march in the day of 17th that is history you have to be refueled until the prophet says until every five of you is filled with the holy spirit that's the challenge friends until you are soaked up of him until he becomes you and you become nothing that's the challenge may god bless you let's stand up we are going to have a word of prayer and maybe our friends can pray for us past me not agent or savior we know how to do that and as that song is going on you would speak to him in your heart and say lord i want to conduct you your fullness the person of christ that you may indulge me lord i can't pass through this night alone i can't enjoy living this life alone i know i was not made to be that way this is just the temple of the person of jesus christ so maybe the song that can lead us in that song as we pray [Music] [Music] my heart [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] crying safe [Music] [Applause] [Music] cry [Music] oh [Music] [Music] well we can hold it there we are just going to pray if you want to be remembered in prayer wherever you are my prayers and sister brother my friends just lift up your hand and believe in your heart as we pray lord jesus water time what a challenge that is before us this day that we have to get you from the wilderness that when the question again is asked what went he out in the wilderness to receive we would have the right answer we went to receive him we went to conduct him back to our mother's house to the temples of the holy spirit that the person of christ would dwell not only should he dwell but we should hold our swords and not even us holding but him in us is our armor him in us will take care of himself but we have to be on the lookout for our anniversary the devil moves out looking for him he may divide and lord we have seen many different many swallowed many tone but we pray that god he who promised that you are elected will never be deceived you'll come and lord god prove your word i thank you for your children here their hands gone applaud down always to what they are yearning for maybe they are feeling empty maybe they are feeling you are not there maybe they need a refeeling maybe they need a confirmation that you are in maybe lord maybe the enemy has been whispering bringing in noise confusion trying to wake him out of the rest lord give us the boldness give your children a boldness to stand and to speak and to cast out these demons of any belief that are moving around the world may you lord god rest in us for when you rest in us then we rest from all that bothered us and eventually lord we know you are taking us lord god to that great millennial rest and you are going to live with us internally what a package what a blessing that you've set

strong growing reality in us a standard that the enemy will never be able to go to overcome but that will overcome the enemy and throw off all the waves of deception that are coming from the waves

there to think that that here he comes back you know he's she's got him then she doesn't have him then she's looking for him no one can find him and she goes a little while and here he comes roaring in out of the wilderness my i thought about that i thought wow you know he's coming back i never called that brother he's coming back with myrrh and frankincense because there's going to have to be a death here see i mean you know what that implies you realize i hope you realize the implication is that you know she had him for a while and a lot of times you know it can get like that with you and

where is he and you're gonna run into the street have you seen him oh i need him again oh i'm gonna tell you something friends he'll come back but when he comes back this time he's looking to go to
