[0:00] look into history and you will find that
[0:01] the truly great were those who served
[0:04] others history can never acclaim those
[0:06] for whom much was done but it will
[0:08] forever praise those who did much for
[0:10] others now let us apply that to
[0:12] ourselves
[0:14] even as the son of man came not to be
[0:16] ministered to but to minister we are to
[0:18] follow that example
[0:20] see him and he bows himself over the
[0:22] feet of the apostles washes their tired
[0:24] and dirty feet he said you don't know
[0:26] what i am doing but you will know
[0:28] hereafter you will see what i'm doing
[0:30] you ought to also do it he became a
[0:32] servant in order that god could elevate
[0:35] him to the hell the highest height and
[0:37] one day in the judgment of the saints we
[0:39] are going to hear him say well done good
[0:41] and faithful servant enter into the joy
[0:43] of the lord and this is what spoke to me
[0:45] it is it is hard to be a servant but
[0:47] those who spend and are spent for others
[0:50] will one day see be seated with him in
[0:53] his throne and it'll all be worth it
[0:55] then amen let us labor for the master
[0:58] brother branham always breaks out into
[1:00] song let us labor for the master from
[1:02] dawn till setting sun
[1:03] ah when all life is over all our work on
[1:06] earth is done when the role is called a
[1:08] beyond or i'll be there amen
[1:10] a diligent believer stays diligent in
[1:12] his passion for christ even when
[1:15] something that we may pray for doesn't
[1:17] happen right away or maybe we have
[1:20] something that the lord we need
[1:21] deliverance of uh you know
[1:24] remember abraham still diligent in his
[1:27] walk but had to wait 25 years for the
[1:29] promise to manifest amen how many can
[1:31] say that they've waited 25 years for
[1:34] something
[1:35] anybody amen it's it's a tough thing to
[1:37] be a servant waiting that but it's
[1:39] patience that's one of the that's one of
[1:41] the things that it's talked about in
[1:43] this verse amen
[1:44] for this for the sake of time i want to
[1:46] um
[1:47] just skip a little bit forward
[1:50] second peter
[1:52] um we'll go to verse
[1:57] we'll look at verse eight
[2:00] and i'm going to read a dif another
[2:01] another uh version you can pull it up if
[2:04] you want but
[2:05] the the christian standard bible for if
[2:07] these qualities are yours and are
[2:10] increasing they will keep you from being
[2:13] useless or unfruitful in the knowledge
[2:15] of our lord jesus christ
[2:18] and the person who lacks these things is
[2:20] blind and short-sighted and has
[2:22] forgotten the cleansing from his past
[2:24] sins amen i don't want to forget the
[2:26] cleansing from my past sins i don't want
[2:28] to forget what the lord's done for me
[2:30] and i want to be i want to be useful and
[2:33] i want to be fruitful in the knowledge
[2:35] that he's given us in this scripture in
[2:37] the message you know we've been given a
[2:39] grand privilege of being a part of the
[2:42] bride of jesus christ to know the
[2:44] mysteries that we do and i don't want to
[2:46] just be useful in our as second peter
[2:49] says useful or unfruitful in my
[2:51] knowledge i want to take it forth and do
[2:53] a diligent service for the lord amen
[2:56] says in the uh therefore brothers make
[2:59] every effort to confirm your calling and
[3:01] election because and this is what pastor
[3:04] was talking about because if you do
[3:06] these things you will never stumble it
[3:09] doesn't say if you
[3:11] wish these things could be done for you
[3:14] or if
[3:18] it says if you do these things you will
[3:21] never stumble i don't ever want to
[3:22] stumble i do stumble we all stumble but
[3:25] i don't want to amen so we need to
[3:27] actively be diligent in our service to
[3:30] the king amen
[3:32] i want to take a look at the verse 10 in
[3:34] the amplified bible it says therefore
[3:36] believers be all the more diligent to be
[3:38] to make certain and his uh about his
[3:40] calling and choosing you to be sure that
[3:43] your behavior reflects and confirms your
[3:47] relationship with god wow be sure that
[3:49] your
[3:50] your behavior reflects and confirms your
[3:53] relationship with god for by doing these
[3:55] things
[3:56] actively developing these these features
[3:59] these virtues actively developing them
[4:02] you will never stumble in your spiritual
[4:04] growth and will live a life that leads
[4:07] others away from sin while you mean that
[4:10] if i follow these and i diligently seek
[4:12] after them not only will it be good for
[4:14] me but it will be good for people around
[4:16] me wow amen what a responsibility that
[4:19] is in the scriptures amen we have a
[4:21] grand responsibility and it's an active
[4:23] process
[4:26] now i want to take a look at um
[4:29] what what
[4:30] the king james version
[4:33] calls the model the model servant
[4:36] uh in genesis 24
[4:38] we look at um
[4:39] we look at we're back in abraham's time
[4:43] and abraham gave his servant an
[4:46] incredible task
[4:48] his the task that he gave him
[4:51] was
[4:52] to leave the land of canaan that they
[4:55] were that they were currently residing
[4:56] in and go into the land of his fathers
[4:59] of his lineage and to find a wife for
[5:01] his son isaac
[5:04] now a few things i noticed while reading
[5:06] this chapter that i just thought was
[5:07] beautiful that abraham i'm just going to
[5:10] paraphrase some things just for sake of
[5:11] time but abraham entrusts his servants
[5:15] with all his goods and position
[5:18] all his goods and possessions to give a
[5:20] gift for his future wife
[5:22] and it says that he took 10 camels in
[5:24] verse
[5:25] 10
[5:26] of chapter 24 in genesis and he took
[5:30] 10 camels of his master and departed for
[5:32] all it says for all the goods
[5:35] of his master were in his hand and he
[5:37] arose and went into mesopotamia and unto
[5:40] the city of nehor
[5:43] abraham entrusts his servant with all
[5:45] those things the servant was trusted
[5:47] with the possessions of his master and
[5:48] started out on what was to look like a
[5:51] very strenuous journey i did some uh did
[5:53] some digging and found that the journey
[5:56] from where he was at to where he had to
[5:58] go was over 700 miles it says that it
[6:01] was around between five and nine hundred
[6:03] miles now if you were to walk they
[6:05] didn't have cars back in those days so
[6:07] they had to walk and use camels which
[6:09] camels were not very quick
[6:11] so they had to it would take them a
[6:13] minimum of 21 days
[6:15] so it took
[6:17] his servant it took eliezer we know that
[6:19] it
[6:20] we know that from earlier scriptures
[6:23] that this his name is eliezer
[6:25] it took him 21 days to get to this place
[6:28] to go and find a wife and he couldn't
[6:31] take isaac with him abraham says
[6:33] isaac can't leave this land he said i
[6:35] need you to go and find a bride and this
[6:37] is this is really a beautiful type that
[6:39] brother branham gets into but we're not
[6:41] we're not going to go there today but
[6:44] talk about laboring for your master
[6:49] earlier i mentioned i just want to
[6:50] interject something earlier i mentioned
[6:51] that we are friends of god and just as
[6:54] john 15 14 says but your friends if you
[6:56] read that whole scripture it says ye are
[6:58] my friends if you do whatsoever i
[7:01] command you
[7:02] so obedience
[7:04] is absolutely necessary in servanthood
[7:07] amen and not just obedience but
[7:10] ephesians 6 6 says to be obedience with
[7:13] singleness of heart
[7:15] as unto christ meaning he is not
[7:18] christ is not just a fraction of what we
[7:20] serve he's not just we don't just serve
[7:22] him sometimes or we he is holy who we
[7:25] serve amen
[7:27] the servant of abraham had but one task
[7:30] in mind and that was to do the will of
[7:32] his master
[7:34] he praised the prayer of his faith for
[7:36] his for his master's request in genesis
[7:38] 24 12-14
[7:41] he says oh lord god my master uh or lord
[7:44] god of my master abraham i pray thee
[7:46] that will show me that you would show me
[7:48] good speed this day and show kindness
[7:49] unto my master abraham and behold i
[7:52] stand here by the well of water the
[7:53] daughters of the men of the city came
[7:55] out to draw water and it came to pass
[7:58] that the damsel to whom i shall say let
[7:59] down thy picture i pray thee that i may
[8:02] drink and she shall say drink and i will
[8:04] give thee camels drink also let the same
[8:06] be that she has anointed for thy servant
[8:08] isaac and thereby shall i know that thou
[8:10] has shewed kindness unto my master
[8:13] and
[8:15] before he's even done praying but it
[8:17] says that before he even had done
[8:19] speaking that behold rebecca came out
[8:23] just to go go forward in the story a
[8:25] little bit he asked rebecca who her
[8:27] family is he
[8:29] his prayer was answered and he asked
[8:30] rebecca who her family was
[8:33] and he finds out that it was exactly who
[8:36] he needed it to be and so he gave her a
[8:38] portion of his master's possessions and
[8:40] asked if he could go meet her family
[8:43] he was invited into the home of the
[8:44] family and offered food after his long
[8:47] journey but he refuses to sit down and
[8:50] eat
[8:52] because he had singleness of heart in
[8:54] mind
[8:55] his master's task amen he had singleness
[8:59] in his heart the singleness of his
[9:01] master's task
[9:02] a few things i noticed while reading
[9:04] this
[9:05] spurgeon writes the phrase my master
[9:09] is the refrain of this chapter the word
[9:11] master occurs 22 times
[9:14] eliezer did not aspire to any
[9:16] independence of abraham or of abraham's
[9:18] son his thoughts were of his master his
[9:21] words were in praise of his master his
[9:24] deeds on behalf
[9:25] of his master he was not his own but the
[9:28] bond servant of another and this is also
[9:31] our position
[9:33] we say that his name was eliezer his
[9:34] name was not spoken one time in the
[9:36] chapter
[9:38] there is
[9:40] not one thing
[9:42] spoken about
[9:44] the
[9:45] the servant in this chapter the servant
[9:48] was
[9:50] all in regards in singleness of heart to
[9:52] do and fulfill the master's task
[9:55] and many times we can say
[9:57] you know
[9:58] and i say we me and
[10:01] one finger at you three pointed back at
[10:03] me we can get so caught up in what we
[10:05] need from the lord
[10:08] but we need to get back to seeing what
[10:09] he needs from us
[10:12] as his servants especially
[10:14] as his saints now especially as we see
[10:17] the time so approaching let us let us
[10:19] labor for the master now while we still
[10:22] can amen
[10:24] peter says at the end of this chapter in
[10:26] second peter
[10:29] 1 12-14 it says therefore
[10:32] i will always be ready to remind you of
[10:36] these things
[10:37] even though you already know them and
[10:39] have been established in the truth which
[10:41] is present with you
[10:43] i think it right as long as i am in this
[10:45] earthly tent to inspire you
[10:48] by reminding you
[10:50] peter's saying this because he knows
[10:52] that who he's talking to
[10:54] knows that these things need to be done
[10:57] i'm speaking this to you i
[10:59] we know we know these truths we know we
[11:01] need to be diligent but as long as as
[11:04] long as we're here we need to be
[11:05] reminded that we have to be diligent
[11:09] not only to listen
[11:11] to these truths but to apply them as
[11:13] peter says oh so diligently
[11:16] in steady and earnest
[11:18] energetic effort as faithful as a
[11:22] servant and even more than a servant a
[11:24] slave
[11:25] once so captivated by sin like we were
[11:28] talking earlier one so captivated by sin
[11:30] and so diligent to serve unrighteousness
[11:34] and unholiness let us now be all the
[11:37] more diligent to serve holiness and
[11:40] righteousness and our master
[11:42] amen
