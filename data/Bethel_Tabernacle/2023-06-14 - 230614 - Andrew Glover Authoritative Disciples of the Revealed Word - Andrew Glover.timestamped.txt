[9:24] Hallelujah.
[9:27] Amen. Amen. Brother Luther, if you'd
[9:31] come and take up the offering tonight
[9:33] for us, brother. Just wanted to make um
[9:36] a a quick announcement.
[9:44] Apparently, when I skipped church last
[9:47] Sunday, about a third or maybe closer to
[9:49] a half of the church wasn't here also.
[9:53] So, brother Jason said, um, this Sunday
[9:55] we're going to take up another offering
[9:57] for the building fund. Thank Thank you
[10:00] to those of you who did give already.
[10:03] Um, I'm gonna
[10:05] uh I guess we're going to announce that
[10:08] uh we're announcing that tonight, but
[10:09] we're also going to uh moving forward
[10:12] with the work party, speaking with
[10:14] brother Matt. Um we still didn't get
[10:17] those changes done to the plans that
[10:19] need to be done. And when we moving
[10:21] things for the work party, we're going
[10:23] to be taking the awning down and moving
[10:26] some things around. And it all needs to
[10:28] be really fluid. like everybody's time,
[10:31] everyone needs to be fluid. So that way,
[10:34] you know, at a kind of at not at a
[10:36] moment's notice, but more or less at a
[10:38] moment's notice, Brother Matt can send
[10:40] out a text. Hey brothers, in two days
[10:42] we're going to do this, we're going to
[10:44] do that. We're going to move these
[10:46] pieces. The reason why we're doing that
[10:48] is because we have to coordinate it with
[10:50] our contractor to pour the slab in a
[10:53] timely fashion afterwards.
[10:57] So that way we don't have like if we
[10:58] have high winds and we take that awning
[11:00] down, the awning will be sitting over on
[11:03] the ground over there by brother Matt's
[11:05] house and if a wind catches that, it'll
[11:07] be gone. So we want to it's going to be
[11:10] kind of a little tricky, but I I believe
[11:13] with God by God's grace, we'll be able
[11:15] to get that done. And again, um thank
[11:17] you for your giving toward the building
[11:19] fund. And um I've sent we've sent out a
[11:22] few different um messages about some
[11:25] upcoming um
[11:28] uh building fundraisers. And so we're
[11:30] going to be moving forward with those
[11:32] ideas with my brother Luther.
[11:36] Bless you, brother.
[11:40] Praise the Lord. Uh we also um didn't do
[11:44] the pledge thing. And what I'm going to
[11:46] do is I'm going to have envelopes back
[11:48] there and a piece of paper and the
[11:51] envelopes will have printed on them
[11:53] pledges. So, um, and if you don't get it
[11:57] done before the offering on Sunday,
[11:58] that's okay. We have a basket back
[12:00] there. Um, so you can write on the piece
[12:03] of paper your name and what you want to
[12:05] pledge. And the reason for that is so
[12:08] the trustees can kind of plan what's
[12:11] going to what's going to come in so they
[12:14] can plan accordingly. Basically, that's
[12:15] what that's for. So, they will be back
[12:18] there on the desk by that little box
[12:19] that has a hole, but there'll be a pile
[12:21] of envelopes and then uh some paper to
[12:24] write on and you can put it in the
[12:25] envelope and put it when the offering
[12:27] comes around or you can put in the
[12:28] offering box on the way out. Okay. Love
[12:32] the Lord.
[12:33] Amen. Now, I had a little my wife told
[12:38] me a little funny
[12:40] and it was about a husband and wife and
[12:41] they were already home in glory and um
[12:46] the husband turns to the wife and says,
[12:48] "You know, if if you hadn't got me on
[12:50] that diet, we could have been here 5
[12:52] years ago,
[12:54] not to eat or whatever, but that's how
[12:57] much better it is over there." Amen.
[13:00] This is just a negative.
[13:03] So, um, I thought that was pretty funny.
[13:07] No, she doesn't have me on a diet.
[13:10] Amen. You have a request upon your heart
[13:12] this evening. Um,
[13:15] you know, God is able,
[13:18] every little request or big request. I
[13:22] have more than one. And I just commit
[13:24] myself to the Lord. He's going to take
[13:26] care of me one way or another. Amen.
[13:28] Let's pray.
[13:30] Father, I love you.
[13:32] I'm so thankful, Lord, that
[13:36] you reached down your hand and found me,
[13:37] Father. It wasn't in a good place, but
[13:40] you brought me to a good place, Father.
[13:43] Lord, I pray for the requests of each
[13:45] and everyone.
[13:48] Each and every request, you know,
[13:50] Father, that will lift it under those
[13:52] hands. We commit them to you, Father,
[13:55] this evening. And this is Lord, it's
[13:57] also a prayer service. But Lord, we pray
[14:00] for the breaking of the bread, the
[14:02] greatest form of worship. Help us to
[14:03] open our hearts to receive what you have
[14:05] for us, Father.
[14:08] And Lord, as we gather the tithes and
[14:09] offerings, I pray that you bless the
[14:11] cheerful giver, magnify it to your
[14:13] kingdom, Lord. We love you, Lord. We
[14:16] worship you in Jesus Christ's name.
[14:18] Amen.
[14:22] Amen. Why don't you have your seats?
[14:24] have brother Lennial come if he would
[14:28] sing something for us.

[14:41] leaders or different musicians one time
[14:43] when I was uh up in Ohio leading songs.

[14:52] and prayed. it was just to call a random

[29:20] wanted to see him. And he said, "If
[29:22] there's a desire in the heart to see
[29:23] him, he will make a way for you to see
[29:26] him." Amen. And I believe here tonight
[29:28] that our hearts are open to see him in
[29:30] the power of his resurrection. Amen. Uh
[29:32] Jesus himself said, "If I be lifted up,"
[29:34] he said, "I'll draw all men unto
[29:36] myself." And I believe we've come here
[29:38] tonight to do that one thing, and that
[29:40] is to lift up the name that is above
[29:42] every name, that at that name every knee
[29:44] has to bow and every tongue has to
[29:46] confess. Amen. We say God bless you here
[29:48] this afternoon. And maybe just before we
[29:50] open the word, let's just bow our hearts
[29:52] together here for a word of prayer. Uh
[29:55] maybe you have a special need upon your
[29:57] heart. Something tonight that you would
[29:59] say, "Lord, I need you. I need you to
[30:01] touch my body. I need you to touch my
[30:03] mind. I need a healing in my spirit."
[30:06] Amen. I believe he's here tonight. Let's
[30:07] approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[30:10] your believers have gathered here this
[30:11] afternoon, we've not come here out of
[30:14] tradition. We've not come here out of
[30:16] Lord a religious duty. But Father, we've
[30:18] come here because there was a deep
[30:20] calling to the deep. And Lord, your
[30:22] prophet has taught us that before there
[30:23] was a deep calling to the deep, there
[30:25] was a deep to respond. And Lord, I know
[30:28] that before there was a fin on the
[30:29] fish's back, there was a water for it to
[30:31] swim in. Before there was a tree up on
[30:34] the earth, there was an earth for it to
[30:35] grow out of. And Lord, before these
[30:37] believers ever got ready today to come
[30:40] to your house and to worship you, Lord,
[30:42] there was Lord desires in their heart,
[30:44] but Lord, before they ever even got
[30:45] here, Lord, the satisfaction, the
[30:47] satisfying portion to those desires was
[30:50] already provided. And Lord, as we come
[30:52] here tonight, we're not looking to see a
[30:54] man. We're not looking to hear from a
[30:56] man. But Lord, we're looking to see you.
[30:58] We're looking to hear from you tonight,
[31:00] God. And I I commit this service into
[31:02] thy hands, Lord. You've seen every hand
[31:04] that was raised, Father. Lord, behind
[31:06] that hand there is a need. If it's a
[31:07] sickness, oh God, I know you're a
[31:09] healer. Lord, if it's a bondage, I know
[31:11] you're a deliverer. Lord, whatever the
[31:13] need is, oh God, I know that you're more
[31:15] than able to move upon the face of the
[31:17] situation. So Lord, we invite you. Come
[31:19] in this building. Take the preeminence
[31:21] among us. Lord, be the speaker here
[31:23] tonight. Oh God, give us a temporary
[31:25] resurrection, Lord. And father, as we
[31:27] join our faith together, Lord, may we by
[31:29] your spirit and your authority, may we
[31:31] drive out every spirit out of this
[31:33] building that's unlike the Holy Spirit
[31:35] that would try to hinder this meeting in
[31:36] any way, oh God. And Lord, we give this
[31:38] service into thy hands. Have your way
[31:40] among us, Lord. For it's in Jesus
[31:42] Christ's name we pray. And all the
[31:44] believers says,
[31:46] "Amen." And amen. God bless you this
[31:48] evening. If you have your Bibles, while
[31:50] you're standing with us, we'll invite
[31:51] you to the book of Luke, the 17th
[31:52] chapter. Brother Brad, I've totally lost
[31:55] it in my ear. It's totally gone. Um, in
[31:58] the book of Luke, the 17th chapter, uh,
[32:00] this there it is. That's good. In the
[32:03] book of Luke, the 17th chapter, and we,
[32:05] while you're turning there this evening,
[32:06] we do want to, uh, be sure and greet you
[32:09] all this evening in the name of the
[32:10] Lord. And we want to say it's a real
[32:11] honor and a privilege to be here with
[32:13] you u here on this Wednesday evening.
[32:15] And seemed like just the other day we
[32:16] were here in uh, meetings with you and
[32:18] still uh, thinking over the times in the
[32:20] presence of the Lord. And amen. I know
[32:22] the Lord's been good to us. And we uh
[32:24] just here in the area over at brother uh
[32:26] Perry's this weekend holding some
[32:28] meetings for him. And so we worked out
[32:30] to come by and see you all and sure glad
[32:31] to see the Lord bringing brother Jason
[32:33] right along and he healing virtue. And
[32:35] uh I asked him in the back room. I said,
[32:37] "How long is it before you get back in
[32:38] the pull pit?" And he said, "Well, I'm
[32:40] chomping at the bits." And I'm sure uh
[32:42] Amen. set a preacher down for a month.
[32:43] That's a hard task. Amen. So I'm sure
[32:46] sister Debbie's heard a lot of sermons
[32:48] in the past few days. Amen. But we we
[32:51] sure want to say God bless them this
[32:52] evening. And if you if you have your
[32:54] Bibles, we want to look here in the book
[32:55] of Luke the 17th chapter. And I want to
[32:59] read here in the 26th verse of Luke 17.
[33:03] Uh Jesus here speaking. I know it's a
[33:05] very very familiar scripture as we know
[33:07] it as the world conditions at the time
[33:10] of the second coming of the Lord. And in
[33:12] the 26th verse, it says, "And as it was
[33:14] in the days of Noah, so shall it also be
[33:18] in the days of the son of man. They did
[33:21] eat, they drank, they married wives,
[33:23] they were given in marriage until the
[33:25] day that Noah entered into the ark, and
[33:28] the flood came and destroyed them all."
[33:31] Now likewise also it was in the days of
[33:33] Lot. They did eat, they drank, they
[33:35] bought, they sold, they planted, they
[33:36] builded. But the same day that Lot went
[33:39] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[33:40] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[33:43] all. Now listen at the 30th verse. Even
[33:46] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[33:50] of man is revealed.
[33:52] Amen. Even thus shall it be in the day
[33:55] when the son of man is revealed. I
[33:59] believe we can say this day the
[34:01] scripture is fulfilled. Amen. We ask the
[34:04] Lord this evening that you add the
[34:05] blessings the reading of his word as you
[34:06] can have your seats here this afternoon.
[34:08] I want to hear for just a few moments.
[34:10] I'm mindful that it's a Wednesday night.
[34:12] So we don't want to uh get too
[34:14] longwinded but we do want to uh let the
[34:16] Lord have his way. Amen. But but from
[34:18] those scriptures tonight I want to by
[34:20] the help of the Lord to speak to you
[34:21] here. And if I title this thought I want
[34:23] to speak to you tonight on authoritative
[34:25] uh disciples of the revealed word.
[34:28] Authoritative disciples of the revealed
[34:30] word. You know uh looking at that word
[34:33] authoritative, Webster says it's able it
[34:35] means able to be trusted as being
[34:38] accurate or true. It is to be reliable.
[34:41] Now it means to be very likely to be
[34:43] respected and obeyed. So when something
[34:46] is authoritative, it is able to be
[34:48] trusted. It has been proven to be
[34:50] accurate. It is proven to be true,
[34:52] reliable. And when it is asserted or
[34:55] when it is given forth, it is very
[34:57] likely, amen, to be respected and to be
[35:00] obeyed. Now, brother Brandham actually
[35:02] tells us in the message he said there is
[35:03] two kinds of word. He said there is
[35:05] authoritative word. He said then there's
[35:07] unauthoritative word. And we know as
[35:09] believers, amen, that we are not under
[35:12] obligation to follow anything that has
[35:14] not been vindicated by the Lord Jesus
[35:16] Christ. We're not following anything.
[35:18] We're not believing anything that has
[35:20] not been vindicated. Amen. To be thus
[35:22] sayaith the Lord from the word of God.
[35:24] Now, uh when you think of this here in
[35:26] Luke 17:30, very powerful scripture. He
[35:28] said, "Even thus shall it be in the day
[35:31] when the son of man is revealed." Now,
[35:33] what I love about that, amen, is the son
[35:36] of man is not learned, the son of man is
[35:38] not memorized, the son of man is not
[35:40] found, son of man is not uh uh educated,
[35:43] the son of man is revealed. So when the
[35:47] day and the days when the son of man is
[35:49] revealed, now that word revealed, it
[35:51] means to uncover. It means to lay open
[35:54] that which has been veiled or covered
[35:56] up. It means to disclose, to make bear,
[35:58] to make known, to make manifest. It
[36:00] means to disclose before what was
[36:03] unknown. So at one time, amen, the son
[36:05] of man was disclosed. The son of man was
[36:08] unknown. The son of man was veiled. The
[36:10] son of man, amen, had not been yet
[36:12] manifested or made known. Therefore, we
[36:15] could not follow something that had not
[36:17] been revealed. Amen. But in the
[36:18] prophet's message in 1964, he preaches
[36:21] an entire sermon and he calls it the
[36:23] unveiling of God. Now, very powerful
[36:25] sermon. In his opening comment, he said,
[36:27] "My subject this morning is to reveal or
[36:30] to unveil that God." Amen. My subject is
[36:33] to reveal or to unveil that God. Now,
[36:36] how many will agree that when something
[36:37] is revealed or is unveiled, Amen, it
[36:40] must be of great importance. Amen. It
[36:42] must be of something of value that it
[36:44] was covered up so long, Amen. that
[36:47] nobody could see it, nobody could
[36:48] understand it, nobody could look upon
[36:50] it. Amen. But all of a sudden it moves
[36:53] from being re from being hidden and
[36:55] disclosed to being revealed and
[36:57] unveiled. And I believe when something
[36:59] has been revealed or has been unveiled,
[37:01] Amen. If it has been revealed and
[37:03] unveiled from God, Amen. that it should
[37:06] take the preeminence in the church. Now
[37:08] I believe as the prophet said in the
[37:10] unveiling of God, I'm just going to lay
[37:11] a foundation for a moment. He said
[37:13] paragraph 60, he came in three sons
[37:15] names. How many agrees? He came in three
[37:17] sons name. He came in the name of the
[37:19] son of man, the son of David and the son
[37:21] of God. He came first in the son of man
[37:24] because he was a prophet. See now
[37:26] Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the
[37:28] prophet son of man. Amen. What seeest
[37:30] thou? Now Jesus never referred to
[37:32] himself as the son of God. He referred
[37:35] to himself as the son of man because the
[37:38] scriptures cannot be broken. The reason
[37:40] he referred to himself as the son of man
[37:43] is because all the way back in
[37:44] Deuteronomy the 18th chapter. Amen. The
[37:47] Bible said that the Lord your God shall
[37:49] raise up a prophet. Amen. That would be
[37:51] likened unto me. Now that was Moses
[37:53] speaking but he was speaking on the
[37:54] behalf of God. And the prophet picks it
[37:56] up and said so he could not come calling
[37:58] himself the son of God because it wasn't
[38:01] that dispensation. So now we find amen
[38:04] that there is a dispensation. Amen. the
[38:07] son of man will be revealed. He was the
[38:09] son of man prophesying. Amen. To fulfill
[38:12] and the revealing to them all the things
[38:15] that had been done and typed what he
[38:17] was. Amen. When he was here on earth as
[38:20] son of man. So there is a direct
[38:22] connection between son of man and
[38:24] prophetic office. There there is a
[38:26] direct connection between the son of
[38:27] man. Amen. And the foretelling of the
[38:30] future events. Now amen. I'm trying not
[38:32] to preach but I feel you pulling
[38:33] already. Amen. But pray tell me what
[38:35] other message come. Amen. And the climax
[38:38] a years of his ministry. Amen. Was not
[38:41] pointing you back to the past. Amen. Was
[38:43] not even showing you the present but was
[38:45] pointing you to the future. Then sermons
[38:48] like modern events are made clear by the
[38:50] prophecy. Amen. The future home. Things
[38:52] that are to be the rapture. Amen. Where
[38:54] are these coming from? They are coming
[38:56] from a prophetic anointing. Listen
[38:58] church. And they're coming to a
[39:00] prophetic people. Then if there's a
[39:02] prophetic message, Amen. There's got to
[39:04] be a prophetic class of people. Amen. To
[39:06] receive the revealing of the prophetic
[39:08] word. Listen. He came as the prophet and
[39:11] they crucified him. His own crucified
[39:13] him. He came as the son of man. Then
[39:14] after the Holy Spirit came, he was then
[39:17] the son of God. God is a spirit. So he
[39:19] was the Holy Spirit, the son of God. And
[39:22] he lived through the church ages as the
[39:24] son of God. He said, "But now in the
[39:26] millennium, he'll come as the son of
[39:27] David." Amen. Setting up on the throne
[39:29] of his father David. He is the son of
[39:31] David. Right? But remember between the
[39:34] son of God in the leodysian church age
[39:37] they put him out. Amen. But in Luke he
[39:39] said he would be revealed again. Amen.
[39:42] As a son of man. Amen. Son of man son of
[39:45] God. Son of David. But between I know
[39:48] you know these things but I'm going
[39:49] somewhere. Between the son of God and
[39:51] the son of David. It took a prophet to
[39:54] come on the scene and find Amen. Luke
[39:56] 17:30 and say he will be the fulfilling
[39:59] the rest of it. See the scriptures is
[40:01] perfectly together. The son of man, the
[40:04] son of God, the son of David. What was
[40:06] it? It's the same God all the time just
[40:09] changing his form in morphe. He just
[40:12] changed it. See, it's a great drama to
[40:14] him. He's just acting it out. Amen. So
[40:17] what he So, so it was not one God and
[40:19] the son of D, son of man, then another
[40:21] God and the son of God, and then another
[40:23] God and the son of David. Amen. But it
[40:25] was the same God. Amen. from Genesis to
[40:28] Revelation. It's the same God from 47 to
[40:31] 65. It's the same God. Amen. Only
[40:34] changing his mask or revealing himself
[40:36] in another portion. Now, uh I know I'm
[40:39] I'm I'm going a little bit slow here,
[40:40] but I'm doing this on purpose to lay a
[40:42] foundation in the message. The prophet
[40:44] of God, thank you, brother. The prophet
[40:46] God said here in the called out, very
[40:47] powerful sermon if you want to hear it
[40:49] on on the son of man in 1958. Jesus said
[40:52] when the son of man is revealed from
[40:54] heaven said the son of man is now being
[40:57] revealed from heaven. See he said will
[40:59] it come after a while brother Brandham?
[41:00] It is now. The son of man has already
[41:04] come from glory and is revealing himself
[41:06] for the past few years to his church in
[41:08] mercy. Amen. Showing them his great
[41:11] presence doing the same things that he
[41:13] did when he was here on earth. Amen.
[41:15] Revealing himself like he did to Abraham
[41:17] before the destruction. So when you see
[41:19] the son of man, amen, according to the
[41:22] scripture, it's the time, amen, of when
[41:25] you see the son of man revelation, it's
[41:26] the time of destruction. Now listen, it
[41:29] does not take a genius to realize
[41:30] America has fallen apart. Amen. Our
[41:33] government's done fall apart. Amen. Our
[41:35] presidents and and everything is falling
[41:37] apart. Amen. But if it's a destruction
[41:40] time, amen, it must be the time for the
[41:42] son of man, amen, to come on the scene
[41:44] and to reveal himself, amen, not to his
[41:47] bride in judgment, amen, but to his
[41:49] bride in mercy. It is the rise of the
[41:52] sun 65. He said, now who is this son of
[41:55] man? He said, in the beginning was the
[41:57] word, and the word was with God, and the
[41:59] word was God, and the word was made
[42:01] flesh. And if all the teaching that we
[42:03] have and confirmation of the word of
[42:04] God, amen, by word of God, by signs, by
[42:07] wonders, we see today in Luke 17:30,
[42:10] Malachi 4, different scriptures we are
[42:12] acquainted with. Amen. That the word
[42:14] again is waved over the people. Amen.
[42:17] The son of man is the word. Amen. Again,
[42:20] waved over the people. That the dead
[42:23] traditions of man is dead and the son of
[42:26] God is alive again. Somebody shout, he's
[42:28] alive. alive again with the baptism of
[42:32] the Holy Spirit right among us and is
[42:34] giving us life. So we have just
[42:37] identified amen the source of life that
[42:40] is coming into the church. It is not
[42:42] coming from a creed. It is not coming
[42:44] from a denomination. It is coming from
[42:46] the revelation of the son of man in the
[42:49] age that you're living in. Listen
[42:50] friends, without this message, we might
[42:52] as well shut the doors. Amen. and
[42:54] padlock the building and turn off the
[42:56] power because there'll be another dead
[42:58] church with another dead idea. But if
[43:00] this is the revealing and I believe it
[43:02] is of the son of man. Amen. Then there's
[43:05] a power in this word. There's an
[43:06] anointing in this word. There's an
[43:08] authority in this word. Listen, there's
[43:10] healing in this word. There's miracles
[43:12] in this word. Listen, I'm not here
[43:14] waving to you tonight. Amen. What some
[43:16] bishop told me to bring you from some
[43:17] general counsel somewhere. I am waving
[43:20] to you the very presence of Jesus Christ
[43:23] the word waved again over the people
[43:25] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[43:28] and the revelation of his living has
[43:30] come into his church. Another place he
[43:32] said when their eyes were open they knew
[43:34] him. He said when you see the son of man
[43:36] revealed what will it be? The word come
[43:38] back in human flesh. Amen. The revealing
[43:42] of the son of man is the word coming
[43:44] back in human flesh. Voice of the sign
[43:46] 64. He reads Luke 17:30 and says, "The
[43:50] son of man is prophesied to be
[43:52] revealed." And what kind of revelation
[43:54] will it be? It will be the revelation of
[43:57] his living. Amen. After being crucified,
[44:00] 1900 years, but is raised from the dead
[44:03] and is alive with us. He will be
[44:06] revealed. It will be the revealing
[44:08] Christ in the promise of his age. Can I
[44:11] give you another one? I have heard, but
[44:12] now I see. In that day when the son of
[44:14] man is being revealed, a son of man,
[44:17] amen, Jesus Christ made manifest among
[44:20] his people. Amen. A son of man. Amen.
[44:24] Revealing the son of man. Prophet gave
[44:26] you a whole quote on it and the only
[44:27] ones at the end time. He said, "What is
[44:29] it?" Not the angel is the son of man.
[44:31] Amen. But the messenger is revealing the
[44:34] son of man. See, can you get it
[44:35] separated now? That's where it seems to
[44:37] be hard for you. It's not the son of man
[44:40] himself. Amen. the seventh angel,
[44:42] seventh messenger. It's revealing to the
[44:45] public the son of man because it's left
[44:47] the shack. It cannot organize. It's the
[44:50] grain itself again. Amen. Another place
[44:53] he said, you might have thought today I
[44:54] was trying to uh to say this about
[44:56] myself that I'm packing the message. I
[44:58] have no more to do with it than nothing.
[45:01] See, no more than just a voice, my voice
[45:03] against my better judgment. I wanted to
[45:05] be a trapper. Amen. But it's the will of
[45:08] my father that I declare to do. Amen.
[45:10] and am determined to do. So, Brother
[45:12] Brandham did not go find the son of man
[45:14] and say, "Can I reveal you?" He He
[45:17] didn't go find the son of man and say,
[45:18] "Will you use my voice to reveal your
[45:21] coming?" Amen. He didn't go find the son
[45:23] of man. Amen. The son of man come and
[45:25] found him. Amen. Because you don't find
[45:28] the son of man. Amen. The son of man
[45:30] reveals himself. Amen. To the seed of
[45:32] the promise of the age you're living in.
[45:34] Listen friends, it isn't me. He said it
[45:36] wasn't the seventh angel. It was the
[45:38] manifestation of the son of man. See,
[45:41] the angel was not the son of man. He was
[45:43] the messenger from the son of man. The
[45:45] son of man is Christ. He is the one
[45:48] you're feeding on. You're not feeding on
[45:50] a man. His words will fail. Amen. But
[45:53] you are feeding on the unfailing body
[45:55] word of the son of man. You are not
[45:58] feeding on a man. You are feeding on the
[46:01] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[46:04] Now you all know here tonight that
[46:05] brother Brandon preaches an entire
[46:07] sermon and calls it Christ is revealed
[46:10] in his own word. Right? And in that
[46:12] sermon he says the whole Bible, amen, is
[46:14] not the word of a man. Neither was it
[46:16] wrote by man or or neither was it he
[46:18] said brought by man. Neither can it be
[46:20] revealed by man. It's God's word
[46:22] revealed by God himself. Amen. The word
[46:25] revealed by God himself. See himself his
[46:29] own interpreter. Amen. It's Christ
[46:31] revealing himself in his own word. Now,
[46:34] I want to I want to just drop something
[46:35] in here to you. Amen. That God does the
[46:38] revealing and we do the following.
[46:42] God does the revealing and we do the
[46:44] following. See, what is that making?
[46:46] That is making Christ the revealer and
[46:49] making us the followers. Now, in the
[46:51] message unveiling of God, paragraph 37,
[46:53] he said you have to do something. Amen.
[46:56] To cause something to follow it. So you
[46:58] don't just follow something just to be
[47:00] following something. Amen. But what
[47:02] you're following has performed an
[47:04] action. Amen. That has caught your
[47:06] attention and it's actually pulled you
[47:08] to follow in. Listen. Amen. If you're if
[47:10] you're if you're walking down the road
[47:12] and you get distracted and you see
[47:13] something, you didn't just turn and
[47:15] start walking to the left. Amen.
[47:17] Something caught your attention and it
[47:19] pulled you over there and it drawled
[47:21] you. Listen, whatever draws you had more
[47:24] power than what you was with. Whatever
[47:26] got your attention had more power than
[47:28] what you were walking with. Come on,
[47:30] church. Amen. You know where I'm going.
[47:32] Some of you was walking with a Baptist
[47:33] and you was walking with a Pentecostal
[47:35] and you was walking with all kinds of
[47:37] denomination. Amen. And they couldn't
[47:39] satisfy you. Amen. They could not
[47:41] fulfill the craving in your soul. Amen.
[47:43] But in the end time, in the days of the
[47:45] revealing of the son of man, Jesus
[47:47] Christ, the word would be waved over the
[47:50] people again. And it would be so
[47:51] powerful that a prophet would call it
[47:53] what is the attraction on the mountain.
[47:56] He would say what is taking place? It is
[47:58] God fulfilling his word. Listen friends,
[48:00] you're not a part of Bethl Tabernacle.
[48:02] Amen. For some youth program. You're not
[48:04] a part of this church because of some
[48:06] some little basketball team somewhere.
[48:08] You're a part of this church because the
[48:11] revealing of the son of man has come
[48:13] across your life and it's a quickened
[48:16] seed in your soul and has pulled you
[48:17] from the thing you was walking with.
[48:19] Listen, you didn't stop walking, you
[48:21] just changed partners. You didn't stop
[48:23] dancing, you just changed partners. You
[48:25] didn't stop running, you just changed
[48:27] tracks. You was walking with
[48:29] denomination, but now you're walking
[48:31] with Christ. You was walking with a
[48:32] creed. Amen. But now you're walking with
[48:34] reality. You was walking with religion.
[48:37] Amen. But now you are walking in a
[48:39] spiritual relationship
[48:42] with Jesus Christ. Listen, you didn't
[48:44] find this. It found you. You didn't
[48:46] choose yourself. God chose you. You did
[48:49] not claim this revelation. This
[48:50] revelation claimed you. Jesus said, "If
[48:53] any man will come after me," you know
[48:54] what he said, Brother Brad? He said,
[48:56] "Let him deny himself and take up his
[48:59] cross and follow me." Let him deny
[49:02] himself. Let him take up his cross and
[49:05] let him follow me. John or Luke 18:22,
[49:08] he said to the to the rich young ruler,
[49:10] he said, "Yet lackest thou one thing.
[49:12] Sell all thou hast and distribute it
[49:15] unto the poor, and thou shalt have
[49:17] treasure in heaven. Watch these words.
[49:20] And come follow me. Amen. I've given you
[49:23] two scriptures where Jesus, he
[49:25] admonishes you to leave what you're with
[49:28] and come follow him. Amen. Amen. Leave
[49:30] the idea and come follow Christ. Amen.
[49:33] Amen. Deny yourself and come follow
[49:35] Christ. Now, that word follow it, it it
[49:38] really, brother Jason, it just jumps out
[49:39] at me. That word follow it means to
[49:42] follow one who proceeds. It means to
[49:44] join him as an attendant. It means to
[49:47] accompany him. It means to join one as a
[49:50] disciple. It means to join one as a
[49:53] disciple. It means to become or to be
[49:56] his disciple. It means to side with his
[49:59] party. So when you follow something, you
[50:02] are leaving something. To take sides
[50:04] with something. Amen. And to join
[50:06] yourself to it. Amen. You are becoming a
[50:08] disciple of it. Listen friends. Amen. A
[50:11] prophet preached an entire sermon called
[50:13] taking sides. Amen. With Jesus. How many
[50:15] will raise your hand and say tonight
[50:17] I've done took sides with Jesus. I'm not
[50:20] taking sides with a church. I'm not
[50:22] taking sides with a group. I'm not
[50:23] taking sides with a personality. Amen. I
[50:26] am taking sides with Jesus Christ who is
[50:29] the son of man. Amen. Who is the living
[50:32] breathing revelation and presence in
[50:34] this hour? Yes, sir. You say, "Preacher,
[50:36] I want to follow God. I want the
[50:38] leadership of God." Well, the prophet
[50:40] emphatically says, "Amen. The leadership
[50:42] of God is," Amen. Follow the vindicated
[50:46] word of the hour by the Holy Ghost.
[50:49] Listen, church, when something has been
[50:51] vindicated, Amen. You got a right to
[50:53] follow it. Amen. Come on, church. And
[50:55] you got to follow it through the good
[50:57] times. I'm going to preach a little bit
[50:59] tonight. Amen. You got to follow it
[51:00] through the bad times. Sometimes it'll
[51:02] get hard. Sometimes it'll get hot.
[51:05] Sometimes it'll get dry. Sometimes it'll
[51:07] get dusty. Amen. But if you have left
[51:09] the other thing and you have joined
[51:11] yourself as an attendant to the
[51:13] revelation of the son of man, it don't
[51:16] matter how high the mountain is. It
[51:18] doesn't matter how low the valley is. It
[51:20] doesn't matter how lonely the condition
[51:22] is. If you have been joined to the
[51:25] revelation of the son of man, you will
[51:27] follow him when the bank account's full.
[51:29] And you will follow him when it's empty.
[51:31] You will follow him when everything's
[51:32] going good. And you will follow him when
[51:34] everything's falling apart. Amen.
[51:36] Because you are not. Amen. A picnic
[51:38] following God's servant. You are a
[51:40] follower of God regardless. If it's a
[51:42] picnic, you'll follow him. If it's a
[51:44] battlefield, you'll follow him. You have
[51:47] been joined as a disciple to the son of
[51:50] man. Listen, I want to say it as plain
[51:52] as I know how. We have been made
[51:55] disciples. Can you agree with me? We've
[51:57] been made disciples. You know what we're
[51:59] disciples of? We are disciples of
[52:01] Christ. People say, "Well, how can I be
[52:04] a disciple? Have I got to be born of
[52:05] Yachts? Have I got to be born of
[52:07] Watkins? Have I got to be born of a
[52:08] Biscll? Have I got to be born of Puit?
[52:10] Have I got to be born of Reagan?" Amen.
[52:12] To be a disciple of Christ, you got to
[52:15] be born of the word.
[52:17] Come on, church. Amen. Jesus said, "If
[52:20] you be my disciples," Amen. If you
[52:22] continue in my word, Amen. "Then are ye
[52:25] my disciples." So the requirement to be
[52:27] a disciple is the ability to continue in
[52:30] the word. Well, glory to God. I feel
[52:33] like preaching there for a minute. Amen.
[52:35] The desirement to be a disciple is the
[52:38] ability to continue in the word. You
[52:41] see, sometimes it's going to be hard,
[52:43] but we'll continue in the word.
[52:44] Sometimes it's going to be it's going to
[52:46] it's going to go against our own reason
[52:48] and our own understanding, but we're
[52:50] going to continue in the word because
[52:52] the disciples today have been given the
[52:55] commission like the disciples of old.
[52:57] And that is to bring the seeker of God
[53:00] into the presence of God. He said, see,
[53:02] don't bring them into some affiliation.
[53:04] Don't bring them in the presence of some
[53:06] church or some creed or some doctrine.
[53:08] Amen. Bring them into the presence of
[53:11] Christ. Amen. Now, you all know that
[53:13] there's two types of disciples, right?
[53:15] Amen. There's a true disciple and then
[53:17] there's a false disciple. And I just
[53:19] want to read you here a little
[53:20] something. I found a Bible commentary.
[53:22] Not not not uh not of authority. So,
[53:24] take it, leave it, whatever. But here I
[53:26] just want to share it with you. It means
[53:28] in Christianity. Amen. It is disciple
[53:31] primarily refers to a dedicated follower
[53:33] of Jesus. This term is found in the New
[53:36] Testament only in the gospels and the
[53:38] acts. In the ancient world, amen, a
[53:41] disciple is a follower or an adherent of
[53:44] a teacher. Now watch this. Disciplehip
[53:46] is not the same as being a student in
[53:49] the modern sense. Amen. So disciplehip
[53:52] does not necessarily mean you're a
[53:54] student. Amen. a disciple in the ancient
[53:56] Bible world. Amen. Actively imitated
[53:59] both the life and the teaching of the
[54:01] master. So you were not just a follower
[54:03] of the teaching. Amen. But you was a
[54:06] follower of the life. You were not just
[54:08] dedicated to the teaching. Amen. But you
[54:10] was dedicated to the life. And the
[54:12] prophet of God said, "We've had hundreds
[54:14] of denominations. We've had hundreds of
[54:17] Bible schools." Amen. But what the world
[54:19] is crying for tonight is to see the
[54:21] literal life of Jesus Christ. Amen. come
[54:24] back on display. I would tonight,
[54:26] friends, and we would forget about
[54:28] trying to be the biggest, smartest, most
[54:29] educated, amen, most best quote quoter.
[54:32] And let us come back to a reality, amen,
[54:35] that there's more to this message than
[54:37] memorizing quotes. There's more to this
[54:39] message than arguing points and fussing
[54:41] over little doctrines. Amen. There's a
[54:43] life that has been brought back to the
[54:45] church through the revealing of the son
[54:47] of man. Listen friends, the blood cell
[54:49] has broken and the life of Jesus Christ
[54:51] has been released upon the church.
[54:54] We're not here just trying to imitate
[54:56] the teaching. We can actually live the
[54:58] life. Yes, we can live the life of the
[55:01] master. I love this part. It was a
[55:03] deliberate apprenticeship which made the
[55:06] fully formed disciple. Amen. A living
[55:09] copy of the master. Woo. That's a
[55:11] preaching point for about an hour right
[55:13] there, brother Matt. Amen. It was a
[55:15] deliberate apprenticeship which made the
[55:17] fully formed disciple. Amen. A living
[55:21] copy of the master. Listen friends, you
[55:24] know what a disciple does? A disciple
[55:26] does two things. A disciple follows and
[55:29] a disciple leads. A disciple follows,
[55:32] but a disciple also leads. You say, "How
[55:35] do they lead?" Amen. They lead by what
[55:37] they're following. Come on, church. A
[55:40] disciple leads by what? If you are a
[55:42] disciple, you're not leading by your own
[55:44] ideas. You're not leading by the way you
[55:47] see things. You are leading by the
[55:49] revealing of the word of the age that
[55:51] you're living in. Listen, I want to say
[55:53] it as plain as I know how. We are not
[55:55] denominational disciples. We are not
[55:58] personality disciples. We are not Come
[56:00] on, church. We are not political agenda
[56:02] disciples. Amen. Listen, it's got to get
[56:04] down to where you're going to stand with
[56:06] this message if you got to stand by
[56:07] yourself. Come on, church. Amen. I know
[56:10] a lot of things going on, but don't you
[56:11] forget God sent a prophet. Amen. I know
[56:14] there's a lot of directions and a lot of
[56:16] different approaches, but don't you ever
[56:18] forget that God who is rich in mercy
[56:20] loved you enough to keep his word and
[56:22] send you a prophet that would have eyes
[56:24] to see the future, that would have a
[56:26] mouth to confess what he was saying.
[56:28] Listen friends, we are not helplessly,
[56:30] hopelessly staggered, amen, through
[56:32] Leoa. Amen. But the revelation of the
[56:34] son of man has pulled us from the
[56:36] confusion into a clear understanding.
[56:39] And we got spiritual ears to hear. We
[56:41] got a spiritual heart to believe. We got
[56:43] a spiritual eye to see. And we're
[56:46] following and imitating. We are on a
[56:48] fully formed apprenticeship with the
[56:50] master himself. Listen, you couldn't do
[56:52] this in the Baptist church. You couldn't
[56:54] do this in the Methodist church. But
[56:56] when the son of man is revealed, his
[56:58] nature will be revealed. His
[57:00] characteristics will be revealed. the
[57:02] way he conducts himself will be revealed
[57:04] and you can become a fully formed
[57:06] disciple.
[57:09] Well, glory to God. Amen. If you was a
[57:11] Baptist disciple, you'd be a fully
[57:13] formed Baptist disciple. You'd be saying
[57:16] a million more in 44. You'd be saying
[57:18] all kinds of things. But if you are a
[57:20] disciple of Christ, here's what a
[57:22] prophet said. He said, "You will take
[57:24] them to Christ and then Christ will take
[57:26] them to Calvary." If you are a disciple
[57:29] of Christ, you will take them to Christ.
[57:32] Amen. And Christ will take them to
[57:34] Calvary. Listen, the prodigal God said
[57:36] it very plainly. We are not
[57:38] denominational disciples. We are
[57:40] disciples of Christ. Now, I I know
[57:42] sometimes, amen, that we might forget,
[57:44] Amen. But I just want to remind you
[57:46] tonight that we are blessed to be
[57:48] following this message.
[57:50] My Bible says, "Blessed be the Lord who
[57:52] daily loadeth us with benefits." Amen.
[57:55] even the God of our salvation. You know
[57:58] what I like about that, brother Daniel,
[58:00] is it's not once a month. It's not once
[58:02] a year. It's not in a special
[58:04] convention. It's not in a special youth
[58:06] meeting. It's not when a special speaker
[58:08] comes to town. Amen. But he daily loadth
[58:10] us, Amen. with benefits. Even the God of
[58:13] our salvation. Now, if you start talking
[58:15] about benefits, we'll be here this time
[58:17] next week. Amen. There's no way to
[58:19] cover, Amen. all the benefits that God
[58:21] has given the church. But I want to just
[58:23] pull one here to you for a moment. Amen.
[58:25] It's the benefit of having the revealed
[58:28] word and following it. Amen. The benefit
[58:31] of having the revealed word and
[58:33] following it. And I want to say I
[58:34] believe, Amen, that we have the revealed
[58:37] word. I don't believe we're looking for
[58:38] it. I don't believe God's going to send
[58:40] a messenger to bring it. I do not
[58:42] believe there's an eighth age coming or
[58:44] come on church. There's not an eighth
[58:45] messenger coming. We are right here
[58:48] tonight. Amen. in possession of the
[58:50] revealed word of Jesus Christ. We have
[58:53] not got to stumble around like a
[58:55] Catholic. Amen. And rely upon what
[58:57] somebody said about the word. Amen. But
[58:59] the author himself has come into the
[59:01] church to speak lip to ear with this
[59:04] bride. There is no more question marks
[59:06] over this word. It is a period. It is a
[59:09] yay. It is an amen. We have received a
[59:12] thorough complete revelation of Jesus
[59:15] Christ. We don't just have it in book
[59:17] form. We don't just have it in tape
[59:19] form. We don't just have it in picture
[59:21] form. Well, I feel like shouting right
[59:22] there. Amen. We don't just have it,
[59:24] Amen. on our MP3s and our computers.
[59:27] Amen. But we have the message in flesh
[59:29] form tonight. Come on, church. And do
[59:31] you know how we have the message in
[59:33] flesh form? Is because the revelation of
[59:36] the son of man pulled you. And you've
[59:38] been through some trials. You've been
[59:40] through some hard things. And the
[59:41] following of this revelation has molded
[59:44] a character in you that the devil can't
[59:46] talk you out of what God has revealed to
[59:48] you. The following of this word has put
[59:51] something in you that hard times can't
[59:53] take out. Yes, sir. Because it's having
[59:55] the revealed word and following it. Now,
[59:57] when you look at this word benefit,
[59:59] another word for benefit is privilege.
[1:00:01] And that word privilege means a special
[1:00:03] right. Advantage, immunity granted or
[1:00:06] available only to a particular person or
[1:00:08] group. It is an advantage. It is a
[1:00:10] right. It is a benefit, an entitlement,
[1:00:13] birthright due freedom and liberty. So
[1:00:16] when you have a privilege, you have a
[1:00:18] freedom.
[1:00:18] Amen.
[1:00:19] When you have a privilege, you have a
[1:00:21] liberty. When you have a privilege, you
[1:00:23] have a birthright. I love what David
[1:00:25] said. He said, "Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:00:27] soul, and forget not all of his
[1:00:29] privileges. Forget not all of his
[1:00:31] birthright. Forget not all of his
[1:00:33] liberty. Forget not all of his
[1:00:35] benefits." Another place David says,
[1:00:36] "What shall I render unto the Lord for
[1:00:39] all his benefits towards me?" Now,
[1:00:41] somebody might say, "Who is the most
[1:00:43] privileged people on the earth today?"
[1:00:44] Well, can I tell you who they are? The
[1:00:46] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. The bride
[1:00:49] of Jesus Christ is the most privileged
[1:00:51] people on the face of the earth.
[1:00:53] Remember said since the open of them
[1:00:55] seven seals of them angels just yonder
[1:00:57] behind the mountain. Amen. This has
[1:00:59] become a new book. It's the thing that's
[1:01:02] been hid is being revealed as God
[1:01:04] promised in Revelation 10 he would do.
[1:01:07] And we are somebody say we are. We are
[1:01:10] the privileged people that God has
[1:01:13] chosen of the earth that we might see
[1:01:15] and understand these things which is not
[1:01:18] some mythical fleshly mind of a person
[1:01:20] trying to make it up. It's the word of
[1:01:22] God made manifest. Amen. Proven that
[1:01:25] it's right. See then what are you saying
[1:01:27] preacher? I'm saying, amen, that the
[1:01:29] message of the hour is the end of
[1:01:31] guesswork. The message of the hour is
[1:01:34] the end of probability. Amen. The
[1:01:36] message of the hour is the end of
[1:01:38] guessing. It's the end of hoping. It's
[1:01:40] the end of probing. It's the end of
[1:01:42] poking. It's the end of searching. It's
[1:01:45] the end of hunting. When the message of
[1:01:47] the hour is revealed, it becomes the
[1:01:49] absolute to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:52] Now, I'm just going to take you the
[1:01:54] Bible on it. Amen. Paul said it very
[1:01:55] plainly in 1 Corinthians 15, he said,
[1:01:58] "Why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
[1:02:01] Why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
[1:02:03] Amen. He says in Philippians 3:9, he
[1:02:05] said, "Being found in him, not having my
[1:02:08] own righteousness which is of the law."
[1:02:10] Amen. But that which is through the
[1:02:12] faith of Christ. Amen. The righteousness
[1:02:14] which is of God by faith. I love these
[1:02:17] next words. That I may know him. Verse
[1:02:20] 10. That I may know him. Somebody say it
[1:02:23] with me. that I may know him. It didn't
[1:02:25] say that I may guess at him, brother
[1:02:27] Matt. It didn't say that I may hope at
[1:02:29] him. Amen. That I may know him and the
[1:02:32] power of his resurrection and the
[1:02:34] fellowship of his sufferings. Look at
[1:02:36] that last part. Being made conformable
[1:02:38] unto his death. Come on, church. Who's
[1:02:41] he speaking about? He's talking about
[1:02:42] authoritative disciples. He's talking
[1:02:45] about disciples who are going to walk
[1:02:47] with Jesus and through their walk is
[1:02:49] going to be their dying. They're going
[1:02:51] to die to themselves. They're going to
[1:02:52] die to their ideas. They're going to die
[1:02:54] to their ambitions until the very life
[1:02:57] of Jesus Christ be formed in them as a
[1:03:00] witness that our God is not in a grave
[1:03:03] in Jerusalem. He is alive and well. Come
[1:03:06] on, church. The mighty God is not dead.
[1:03:08] He is unveiled. Where is he unveiled at?
[1:03:11] He is unveiled in his human temple. He
[1:03:14] is unveiled in the flesh of his bride.
[1:03:18] Oh, y'all forgive me for a second. I've
[1:03:20] been listening to mighty God unveiled
[1:03:21] over and over and over and it's about to
[1:03:22] get a hold of me right now. Are you
[1:03:24] hearing me church? He's not dead. He's
[1:03:27] been unveiled. Come on, church. Brother
[1:03:30] said, "If the spirit of John Dillinger
[1:03:31] was in you, you would do the you would
[1:03:32] do the deeds of John Dillinger." He
[1:03:34] said, "If Beethoven was in you, you
[1:03:36] would do the things that Beethoven
[1:03:38] done." He said, "But since Jesus Christ
[1:03:41] is in you," he said, "the works that I
[1:03:43] do shall ye do." Come on. I don't
[1:03:46] believe people ought to have to pay
[1:03:48] $5,000 and fly to Israel to see the
[1:03:50] empty grave. I think they ought to be
[1:03:52] able to look at you and see what's in
[1:03:54] the grave is in you.
[1:03:57] I think they ought to be able to look at
[1:03:59] these bride members of these disciples
[1:04:01] and see what was in the book of Mark is
[1:04:02] in you. Sister Debbie, what was in the
[1:04:05] book of Luke is in you. Brother Jason,
[1:04:07] what was in the book of Matthew is in
[1:04:08] you. Come on, young people. Amen.
[1:04:10] They're looking for Christ. The world is
[1:04:12] looking for disciples. You know what
[1:04:14] they wear? They wear disciples of Christ
[1:04:16] bracelets. And I'm just going to step on
[1:04:18] some toes, but I'm going to preach
[1:04:19] anyhow. Amen. A disciple of Christ,
[1:04:21] amen, does not mean you open up a
[1:04:23] hospital. It does not mean you feed the
[1:04:25] poor. It does not mean you clothe the
[1:04:27] naked, those who are part of it. Amen.
[1:04:29] But a disciple of Christ means that you
[1:04:32] have died to yourself. And the very
[1:04:34] teaching and the very life of the master
[1:04:37] has come into you. And it is on display
[1:04:40] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which
[1:04:42] is none other than the token itself.
[1:04:44] Listen friends, it's token time. It's
[1:04:47] time to let the world know our God is
[1:04:49] not dead. He's alive and well. He's
[1:04:52] moving in his church. He's healing in
[1:04:54] his church. He's breathing in his
[1:04:56] church. And we are the disciples who
[1:04:58] have been made conformable under his
[1:05:00] image.
[1:05:02] Yes, sir. I know him. Somebody say, I
[1:05:04] know him. I know him in the power of his
[1:05:07] resurrection. Now, one of my favorite
[1:05:09] quotes, Reb said, "We're thankful for
[1:05:11] the faith." Amen. The evidence,
[1:05:13] something within us that tells us. Watch
[1:05:15] this. "And we know." There's a faith in
[1:05:18] us. Brother Brad, there's an evidence in
[1:05:20] us. There's something within us that
[1:05:23] tells us. And we know there's no more
[1:05:26] guesswork in it.
[1:05:29] There's no more guesswork in it. Brother
[1:05:31] JD, we've had for years, he says, the
[1:05:33] word of God, right? We've had the Bible.
[1:05:36] We've had the word of God for years. But
[1:05:38] watch a prophet turn a dispensational
[1:05:40] corner and say, "But now we got the God
[1:05:43] of the word." For years, we had the word
[1:05:46] of God. Amen. But now we've got the God
[1:05:49] of the word. What brought the God of the
[1:05:52] word back on the earth again? In the
[1:05:54] days when the son of man is revealed
[1:05:57] from heaven, it will be a revelation.
[1:06:00] Amen. Of the author himself coming in
[1:06:02] the church to answer the questions.
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:06] Somebody asked me one time, they said,
[1:06:07] "But Andrew," they said, "why do you why
[1:06:09] do you preach with such assurance that
[1:06:11] you know?" I said, "Because I've talked
[1:06:12] to the author." They said, "Well, how
[1:06:14] can you preach, Amen, with such
[1:06:16] authority?" Because I've talked to the
[1:06:17] author. And if I got a question, I don't
[1:06:19] go consult brother Google. And I don't
[1:06:22] go consult sister Safari. Amen. I go in
[1:06:24] my office and I sit down in the presence
[1:06:27] of God and I consult the author himself.
[1:06:29] Come on, church. You know I'm in the
[1:06:31] message. Mighty God unveiled. He said,
[1:06:33] "We've had for years the pillar of
[1:06:34] fire," he said, "that wrote the Bible."
[1:06:36] He said, "But the same pillar of fire
[1:06:38] that wrote the Bible is the same pillar
[1:06:40] of fire that is here interpreting the
[1:06:43] Bible." Listen friends, the author and
[1:06:45] the interpreter are the self-same
[1:06:46] person. If you got a question, ask the
[1:06:49] author.
[1:06:51] Now, y'all know my wife, she's an
[1:06:53] author, so she writes a book and you
[1:06:55] read one of her books and maybe
[1:06:56] something there says little something
[1:06:57] you don't quite understand. You know
[1:06:59] what you can do, Brother Joe? You don't
[1:07:00] have to live with questions about what
[1:07:02] she meant. When the author comes in the
[1:07:04] room, you can take her book to her. You
[1:07:07] can point out the page. You can point
[1:07:09] out the character and say, "When you
[1:07:11] wrote this, what did you mean?" And if
[1:07:13] she's under the inspiration of it,
[1:07:14] she'll reveal to you what she meant.
[1:07:17] Come on, church. The same inspiration
[1:07:19] that was on her to write it will be the
[1:07:21] same inspiration on her to reveal it.
[1:07:23] and church of living God. Amen. The same
[1:07:26] inspiration that wrote the Bible has
[1:07:28] returned to the church in the last days.
[1:07:30] Amen. To interpret the Bible. Listen,
[1:07:32] he's not doing it through some school.
[1:07:34] He's not doing it through some
[1:07:35] education. He's doing it through trial
[1:07:37] after trial and test after test and
[1:07:40] trial after trial and test after test
[1:07:43] until the very image of Jesus Christ is
[1:07:46] molded into you. Yes, sir. We've had the
[1:07:49] word of God. Amen. But now we got the
[1:07:51] God of the word. See, he's right here
[1:07:54] living his word out. Then you know what
[1:07:56] I believe tonight as Christians? I
[1:07:58] believe we should be notified and not
[1:08:00] guessing.
[1:08:02] Well, that's a quote said things are to
[1:08:04] be. He said, speaking over in Yuma, I
[1:08:06] spoke on the subject of rapture, I could
[1:08:08] say now, how many of you as Christians,
[1:08:10] how many of you here as Christians? He
[1:08:12] said, probably every hand would go up.
[1:08:14] You're a Christian. And so, if we're
[1:08:15] Christians, he said, then I think we
[1:08:17] ought to kindly be notified ahead. We
[1:08:20] don't have to guess at it. We're
[1:08:22] notified what our destination will be.
[1:08:26] So, we're not living our lives in
[1:08:28] jeopardy every hour wondering if we draw
[1:08:30] our final breath, where are we going?
[1:08:32] Amen. If if this is the final day, we
[1:08:34] get out of bed, where are we going to
[1:08:36] where's our destination going to be? We
[1:08:38] have received a message with an
[1:08:41] instruction with a notification. There
[1:08:43] is going to be a rapture that's in the
[1:08:46] future. Then, if that has come to us,
[1:08:48] Amen. Then the sending of a prophet is
[1:08:51] not in the future. It's in the past.
[1:08:53] Amen. The revealing of Malachi 4 is not
[1:08:56] in the future. It's in the past. Come
[1:08:58] on, church. Amen. The cloud is not in
[1:09:00] the future. It's in the past. Come on,
[1:09:03] church. The bridge is not in the future.
[1:09:05] It's in the past. I'm preaching to you
[1:09:07] now. Come on, church. A Amen. The boy
[1:09:09] being raised up in Finland. It's not in
[1:09:12] the future. It's in the past. But what
[1:09:14] is the devil using? Amen. to stop people
[1:09:17] from following this revealed word. He's
[1:09:19] using things that's already been
[1:09:21] fulfilled and trying to find
[1:09:23] discrepancies in them and bring little
[1:09:25] things to your attention. Amen. And get
[1:09:27] your eyes off of the future and get your
[1:09:29] eyes on the past. Because if you get
[1:09:32] your eyes on the past, you will miss the
[1:09:34] future. But I want to let that devil
[1:09:36] know there is a bride on the earth who
[1:09:38] is not stopping. Amen. To hear your
[1:09:41] questions. She's not stopping. Amen. To
[1:09:43] hear your reasons. She has been
[1:09:45] conformed by the revelation to be a
[1:09:48] disciple. And she will follow this
[1:09:50] master when she don't understand certain
[1:09:53] things. She will follow the teachings of
[1:09:55] the master when it gets a little bit
[1:09:56] hard to follow because she's not here
[1:09:59] for a picnic. She's here for a body
[1:10:01] change. She's here for a deliverance.
[1:10:03] She's here for a theophony to come in
[1:10:05] and set up on her in the moment in the
[1:10:07] twinkle of an eye. Oh yes sir. We are
[1:10:10] not we are not stopping because of the
[1:10:12] past. We are pressing into the future
[1:10:16] service by service by service. Day by
[1:10:19] day, hour by hour, we are moving into
[1:10:22] the future. You know what we're not
[1:10:23] doing, brother Jason? We're not guessing
[1:10:25] about it. We're not probing into it. The
[1:10:27] days of guesswork are over.
[1:10:33] Have I got any authoritative disciples
[1:10:35] here tonight?
[1:10:36] The days of guesswork are over.
[1:10:39] Prophet God said, "We're not guessing
[1:10:41] about our destination." Look at this
[1:10:42] ministry explained 50. He said faith is
[1:10:44] a positive sense.
[1:10:47] It's not a guesswork. You don't just
[1:10:50] imagine it. Look here. Faith in the son
[1:10:53] of God. 52. Psychology is a perfect
[1:10:55] guesswork.
[1:10:58] It's a shot in the dark. But almighty
[1:11:01] God's spirit is perfect. So anybody tell
[1:11:04] you we need psychology, you can ask
[1:11:06] them, do we need a perfect shot in the
[1:11:07] dark
[1:11:09] or do we need the evening light that has
[1:11:12] lighted the path to follow God in
[1:11:14] righteousness? Now another place you
[1:11:16] said here, think that after 2,000 years
[1:11:18] has passed by, the Lord Jesus is just as
[1:11:21] much alive tonight as he was back there
[1:11:23] still with the church. The second piece
[1:11:25] of the covenant is here with us. the
[1:11:28] Holy Ghost. He is riding out and doing
[1:11:30] the very same things that he did when he
[1:11:33] was here on earth. He said, "A little
[1:11:34] while the world see me no more, yet you
[1:11:36] shall see me. For I will be with you to
[1:11:39] the end of the world." Oh, it thrills
[1:11:41] our heart to know there is no more
[1:11:43] guesswork. Amen. It's all over. It's
[1:11:46] finished. When Jesus died, sin wasn't
[1:11:48] covered. It was divorced and done away
[1:11:51] with. And then he emptied paradise and
[1:11:53] led captive captive and gave gifts unto
[1:11:56] men. The Old Testament saints went with
[1:11:58] him after his resurrection. Appeared in
[1:12:00] the city, appeared before many people
[1:12:02] that was in the city. Matthew 27. And
[1:12:04] after Jesus resurrection, the old saints
[1:12:06] of the Old Testament, they come out of
[1:12:08] the graves and went into glory with the
[1:12:10] Lord Jesus according to Matthew 27. And
[1:12:13] now when we go, somebody say when we go,
[1:12:16] when we go into the presence of the
[1:12:18] father, waiting the second coming of the
[1:12:19] Lord, now there's no more guesswork in
[1:12:22] it. Come on, church. Amen. You don't
[1:12:24] just have to live with authoritative
[1:12:26] revelation here and then die and go to
[1:12:28] purgatory. There is no such thing,
[1:12:30] brother Tony. There is no such thing as
[1:12:31] purgatory. Amen. Amen. When you die,
[1:12:34] remember said death doesn't change. It
[1:12:35] only dwells your dwell changes your
[1:12:37] dwelling place. Right? Amen. So if you
[1:12:39] live with confidence here and you don't
[1:12:41] go by the way of the rapture, you go by
[1:12:43] the way of the grave. Amen. You will not
[1:12:45] be in the grave or be in the nether
[1:12:47] dimension. Amen. Wondering about what
[1:12:48] your future's going to be. You will be
[1:12:50] standing there with a stronger assurance
[1:12:53] then than you have right now. Come on. I
[1:12:56] can prove it to you in the message
[1:12:57] beyond the curtain of time. The prophet
[1:12:59] God said when I went over there, he
[1:13:00] said, I stood there and he said, they
[1:13:02] come running up to me. Oh, our precious
[1:13:03] brother. Had you not went, we would not
[1:13:05] be here. He said, I asked him, where's
[1:13:07] Jesus? I want to see him. They said, now
[1:13:09] he's a little bit higher than us. Amen.
[1:13:11] He said, well, where's Paul? He said,
[1:13:13] now what'll happen is someday when God
[1:13:16] comes to get to get those in alive,
[1:13:18] Amen. You'll come and you'll gather with
[1:13:20] your people and you'll go in with your
[1:13:22] people and you as a leader you will be
[1:13:25] judged. Now watch this. As a leader you
[1:13:27] will be judged. You know what they said?
[1:13:29] He said, "Well, will Paul be judged?"
[1:13:31] They said, "Absolutely." He said, "Well,
[1:13:33] then praise God." He said, "Because
[1:13:35] where Paul said to baptize, I baptize.
[1:13:38] Where Paul said to pray, I pray." He
[1:13:40] said, "I preach what Paul said." Now
[1:13:42] look what they done. They turned around
[1:13:44] and said, "Listen, brother Brandham, we
[1:13:46] will go in and we'll go in according to
[1:13:49] your teaching." They said, "And you'll
[1:13:51] be judged." And now watch this. You'll
[1:13:54] be judged. And notice they didn't say if
[1:13:56] you're accepted. They said, "You will be
[1:13:58] accepted and we will go in according to
[1:14:01] your teaching." Listen, friends. Amen.
[1:14:03] The revealing of the son of man has
[1:14:06] brought an authority into the church. We
[1:14:08] are not living our lives in jeopardy. We
[1:14:11] are living every day facing devils with
[1:14:14] authoritative power, with authoritative
[1:14:16] anointing. Yes, sir. We're not here as a
[1:14:18] bunch of wishy-washy church members. We
[1:14:20] know who we are. We know who we have
[1:14:23] believed. We know where we come from. We
[1:14:25] know where we're standing. And if breath
[1:14:27] leaves our body this very moment, we
[1:14:29] know that someday we will be resurrected
[1:14:32] and we will reign with Jesus in the
[1:14:34] throne as the overcomers of this age
[1:14:37] because our eyes have seen the
[1:14:39] revealing. Oh, somebody shout, "We
[1:14:42] know." We know. We're not guessing. We
[1:14:46] know.
[1:14:47] Yes, sir. You say, "Preacher, can you
[1:14:49] prove that?" I can. Amen. When Jesus,
[1:14:51] there was a connection between authority
[1:14:53] and resurrection. Brother Brad, there's
[1:14:55] a direct connection between authority
[1:14:57] and resurrection. When Jesus went to the
[1:14:59] grave of Lazarus, he said, "Now he's
[1:15:01] dead." They thought he was taken asleep.
[1:15:04] He said, "He's dead, and for your sake,
[1:15:06] I'm glad I wasn't there." Watch these
[1:15:07] words. But I go wake him.
[1:15:12] That's shout material, brother Jason.
[1:15:14] Amen. I go wake him. Oh my. It wasn't
[1:15:17] though. Amen. I'll go and see if I can.
[1:15:20] I'll go and make a triad. But I'll go
[1:15:22] and wake him. For he knew. Amen. God had
[1:15:26] showed him by a vision that Lazarus was
[1:15:29] going to come forth out of the grave.
[1:15:30] And it wasn't no guesswork. Anytime that
[1:15:33] God shows a vision of what's going to
[1:15:36] happen, it's going to be exactly that
[1:15:38] way. If the visions come from God, it
[1:15:41] just has to be. Come on, church. All
[1:15:43] that was in God, he poured into Christ.
[1:15:46] So the authority, Brother Joel, and the
[1:15:49] confidence and the assurance that was in
[1:15:51] God, he had morphed into Christ. And
[1:15:54] when Jesus anointed with the Christ,
[1:15:56] walked down to the grave of Lazarus, he
[1:15:58] did not walk down there, brother Jason,
[1:16:00] and perform psychology. He did not go
[1:16:02] down there and perform a perfect shot in
[1:16:04] the dark and say, "Well, maybe there's
[1:16:06] something to work with." Come on,
[1:16:07] church. Amen. I ain't going to preach
[1:16:09] all night, but give me a little bit of
[1:16:10] liberty for a few minutes. Are you
[1:16:11] hearing me? He didn't go down there and
[1:16:13] say, "Now, he's been there four days,
[1:16:15] and I know his nose has probably fell
[1:16:16] in. Skin worms have destroyed his body."
[1:16:19] I guarantee you, brother, there's
[1:16:20] nothing to work with. I guarantee you,
[1:16:22] Laz, no. He went down there and knew who
[1:16:24] he was. And he squared his shoulders
[1:16:26] back and he said, "Lazarus, come forth."
[1:16:29] And a man who had been dead in the
[1:16:31] ground for four days stinking rose up
[1:16:34] and breathed the breath of life again
[1:16:37] and stood up on his feet and marched out
[1:16:39] of the grave as a testimony. Come on
[1:16:42] church as a testimony. I was dead but I
[1:16:46] am alive. You want to you want me
[1:16:47] preaching for a second? I'll guarantee
[1:16:49] you what Lazarus become. He become an
[1:16:51] authoritative disciple on the
[1:16:53] resurrection. I guarantee you when you
[1:16:55] saw Lazarus Amen. You didn't ask him,
[1:16:57] Lazarus, is there any hope after the
[1:16:58] grave? I guarantee you, Lazarus had to
[1:17:01] be put in the corner every service cuz
[1:17:03] he wanted to preach about the
[1:17:04] resurrection power of Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:07] that's why you will not shut this bride
[1:17:09] up. She has met him through the same
[1:17:11] power of resurrection. And she will not
[1:17:14] be backed off of her promise. If she got
[1:17:16] to come five times, she'll come five. If
[1:17:19] she got to come 10, she'll come 10. She
[1:17:21] will not lay down and live her life in
[1:17:24] jeopardy when she has been called by the
[1:17:26] revelation
[1:17:29] to be an authoritative disciple. What
[1:17:31] are you getting at, preacher? I'm saying
[1:17:33] our authority comes by knowledge.
[1:17:36] Now, here's come here going to be some
[1:17:37] knowledge for you. Okay, I got 6 minutes
[1:17:39] and 28 seconds left.
[1:17:42] Some of y'all just smiled for the first
[1:17:43] time on that. No, just kidding.
[1:17:47] Authority comes by knowledge. If you
[1:17:50] have no knowledge, you have no
[1:17:51] authority. Prophet of God said in in
[1:17:53] Moses 19:50, it's the authority of
[1:17:56] knowing, not guessing, but knowing. My
[1:17:58] redeemer liveth and today he lives
[1:18:01] supremely in our lives and there's no
[1:18:03] more guessing about it. Ain't that good,
[1:18:06] brother? There's no more guessing about
[1:18:08] it. He lives supremely in our lives and
[1:18:11] there's no more guessing about it. Come
[1:18:14] on, church. That don't just take the
[1:18:16] guest out of your shout. That don't just
[1:18:18] take the guest out of your dance. That
[1:18:20] takes the guest out of your confession.
[1:18:22] Come on, sir. I believe it. Y'all know
[1:18:24] that. I believe in shouting and dancing.
[1:18:26] Amen. But sometimes, Amen. When we get
[1:18:28] done shouting and dance, we need to
[1:18:29] remember we got to confess.
[1:18:31] We got to confess the word. We got to
[1:18:33] confess. Come on, church. It's easy to
[1:18:35] shout when the atmosphere gets right.
[1:18:37] But what about when you get up on Monday
[1:18:39] morning and you went to the prayer line
[1:18:40] and said, "I need a healing in my body."
[1:18:42] And the man of God laid his hand on you
[1:18:44] and the Holy Ghost fell upon you and for
[1:18:46] the first time in a few days you shouted
[1:18:48] all across the church and you woke up on
[1:18:51] Monday morning and you raised up and
[1:18:52] there was that old pain again and here
[1:18:54] come old Sloohoot and he said did you
[1:18:56] really get anything? Did you really get
[1:18:59] that's not the time amen to lay down and
[1:19:01] second guess that's the time to manifest
[1:19:04] as a fully formed disciple amen of Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ. That's the time amen to express
[1:19:09] your authority. That's the time to say
[1:19:11] yes, brother. Brother JD, the pain is
[1:19:13] still there, but Jesus Christ, the son
[1:19:15] of God, healed me of this infirmity.
[1:19:17] Brother Jason, oh, I know the devil wear
[1:19:19] you out. Amen. Man of God, preacher.
[1:19:21] Amen. Surely it shouldn't have got this
[1:19:23] bad where you had to take a month off.
[1:19:25] Oh, but you just wait till he gets back
[1:19:27] in the pull pit. Come on, church. Amen.
[1:19:29] You know why? Because we're not finicky
[1:19:31] disciples. We are not disciples. When
[1:19:34] things are going good, he'll mount this
[1:19:36] pull pit in a few days. And the devil
[1:19:37] will wish he never even said the word
[1:19:39] singles. You know why? Because there's
[1:19:41] an authority and has been deposited into
[1:19:44] a son of God as a disciple. What about
[1:19:46] some of you all right here tonight? The
[1:19:48] devil's trying to get you to ignore the
[1:19:50] word and trying to tell you you failed
[1:19:51] here and you thought this and you said
[1:19:54] that. Amen. But won't you exercise your
[1:19:56] authority tonight and remind that devil
[1:19:59] who you are? You are not a psychologist.
[1:20:01] You are not a guesser. You are not a
[1:20:03] church member. You are an authoritative
[1:20:06] disciple.
[1:20:08] You've been through the trials. You have
[1:20:10] been through enough to be qualified.
[1:20:13] Oh God, today he supremely lives in our
[1:20:16] lives and there's no more guessing about
[1:20:18] it. I love this one. In this day,
[1:20:20] there's no more guessing. Thou hast made
[1:20:23] thyself known.
[1:20:24] Amen.
[1:20:26] Can I Can I have a few minutes and tie
[1:20:27] this together? Thou hast made thyself
[1:20:31] known. Now come on, church. He said,
[1:20:33] "And blessed be thy name for doing so."
[1:20:38] In the days when the son of man is
[1:20:40] uncovered,
[1:20:43] in the days when the son of man is
[1:20:45] unveiled. Come on now. In the days when
[1:20:48] the son of man it is closed, thou will
[1:20:51] make thyself known and blessed be thy
[1:20:53] name for doing so. Can I can I can I
[1:20:55] give you some stuff to fight with in
[1:20:57] closing? Would that be okay? Will you
[1:20:59] say this with me? Our authority
[1:21:01] Our authority
[1:21:01] is
[1:21:03] Jesus Christ.
[1:21:04] Our authority
[1:21:06] is Jesus Christ.
[1:21:09] Our authority
[1:21:11] is Jesus Christ. What are you doing? I'm
[1:21:14] showing you how to use your confession.
[1:21:15] Our authority is Jesus Christ. Come on.
[1:21:18] It's easy to confess right now, but
[1:21:20] you're going to have to confess it when
[1:21:22] you go out those doors. Come on now. You
[1:21:24] have to confess it when you get home
[1:21:26] tonight and those habits and besetting
[1:21:28] sins are staring you in the face. You
[1:21:30] got to stand there as an authoritative
[1:21:32] disciple and say, "But my authority is
[1:21:34] not a Baptist church. It's not a
[1:21:36] Pentecostal idea. My authority is Jesus
[1:21:40] Christ."
[1:21:42] Somebody shout Jesus.
[1:21:44] Our authority is Jesus Christ. He said,
[1:21:47] "Remember now, there is no more power."
[1:21:49] He said, "There is no power none of
[1:21:50] these ministers. There is no power in
[1:21:52] me. There is no power in any man to
[1:21:54] heal. But we have authority from God to
[1:21:56] do this. There's no power in me. There's
[1:21:59] no power in these ministers. There's no
[1:22:01] power in any man. But we have the
[1:22:03] authority from God to do this. We don't
[1:22:06] have power. We have authority. He is our
[1:22:10] authority. God's word and the presence
[1:22:12] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Proves that he's
[1:22:15] here. You know why the devil hates
[1:22:17] fighting you? is cuz you don't just have
[1:22:19] the word of God, but you got the God of
[1:22:22] the word with you. When the devil sees
[1:22:24] you, he does not just see a Bible. He
[1:22:27] does not just see a quote book, but he
[1:22:29] sees the God of the word in flesh.
[1:22:34] What are you saying? I'm saying what
[1:22:36] Jesus was questioned about in Matthew
[1:22:38] 7:28. It came to pass when Jesus had
[1:22:40] ended these sayings, the people were
[1:22:42] astonished at his doctrine. Watch this.
[1:22:44] For he taught them as one having
[1:22:46] authority and not as the scribes. He
[1:22:50] taught them, brother Lenuel, as one
[1:22:52] having the authority and not as one of
[1:22:54] the scribes. Do you realize in Luke 4,
[1:22:56] Jesus heals and delivers a
[1:22:58] demon-possessed person. And the Bible
[1:23:00] says in verse 36, they were all amazed
[1:23:03] and spake among themselves, saying,
[1:23:05] "What a word. What a word is this? For
[1:23:09] with authority and power he commandeth
[1:23:12] the unclean spirits, and they come out.
[1:23:14] What a word is this. Somebody say with
[1:23:17] me, what a word is this? What a what a
[1:23:20] word. Do you realize that's the same
[1:23:22] word that's been waved again over the
[1:23:24] people?
[1:23:26] Do you realize that's the same word
[1:23:28] that's been waved over the people that
[1:23:30] the dead traditions of man is dead and
[1:23:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost with power
[1:23:35] and authority is back in flesh again?
[1:23:38] Listen friends, I'm going to close by
[1:23:40] saying this. How many disciples do we
[1:23:42] have here tonight? How many
[1:23:43] authoritative disciples do we have here
[1:23:45] tonight? Can I tell you what? The
[1:23:47] disciples are under the same authority.
[1:23:52] Come on now. the disciples are under. In
[1:23:55] other words, brother Brad, they have the
[1:23:56] same authority. Luke 9:1. Then he called
[1:23:59] his 12 disciples together and gave them
[1:24:02] power and authority over some devils and
[1:24:06] some diseases and some besetting sins
[1:24:09] and some sicknesses. No. Am I reading
[1:24:11] the wrong Bible? Okay. Okay. Over over
[1:24:14] some situations, over some depressions.
[1:24:16] If it's not too
[1:24:20] No, let's read it like the Bible says he
[1:24:23] ga he called his 12 disciples. He pulled
[1:24:26] his 12 disciples together and gave them
[1:24:29] power and authority over all devils and
[1:24:32] to cure diseases. Listen what a prophet
[1:24:34] said. He said that Roman recognized that
[1:24:37] Jesus of Nazareth had the authority over
[1:24:39] sickness for he was a man in authority.
[1:24:43] It takes an authoritative man to
[1:24:45] recognize an authoritative man. And he
[1:24:47] recognized that if Jesus could speak the
[1:24:50] word, he had the authority. And we know
[1:24:52] he said had to be. He says to this man,
[1:24:54] "If he's going that way," he said, "Come
[1:24:56] back this way, he has to do it. If he's
[1:24:58] going that way, do you know where I'm
[1:25:00] talking about?" He know that Jesus had
[1:25:02] that much authority over sickness. And
[1:25:04] he said, "Listen, I'm not worthy for
[1:25:06] such a holy person as you to come under
[1:25:08] my roof, but I know what authority is.
[1:25:11] You just speak the word. Listen, there
[1:25:14] is a connection between the word and
[1:25:15] authority. You just speak the word and
[1:25:18] my servant will live. Amen. Just speak
[1:25:20] the word. And Jesus said, "As thou hast
[1:25:24] believed, all right, go. Thy son
[1:25:26] liveth." Re said, "And his written
[1:25:28] word," can I can I give you something
[1:25:30] here? His written word tonight is a seed
[1:25:33] that'll take life as soon as you believe
[1:25:35] his word. Are you ready for this? It's
[1:25:38] just the same authority tonight over all
[1:25:41] sickness as it was then.
[1:25:44] The written word. Come on, church. If
[1:25:46] you just had the written word, if you
[1:25:49] just had your physical written word
[1:25:50] Bible, you have got the same authority
[1:25:53] over every sickness. The same as the
[1:25:55] word made flesh had. But what about it
[1:25:57] tonight, friends? He's come as son of
[1:25:59] man. He's come as son of God. He will
[1:26:02] come as son of David. But between the
[1:26:04] son of God and the son of David, he
[1:26:06] returned to this age as the son of man
[1:26:08] to reveal to you that you don't just
[1:26:10] have the word of God. You have the God
[1:26:13] of the word. How much power is in Bethl
[1:26:15] tabernacle? How much power is in your
[1:26:17] young people? How much authority is in
[1:26:19] your preachers if they don't just have
[1:26:21] the word, but they have the God of the
[1:26:23] word?
[1:26:25] Y'all forgive me. I get excited about
[1:26:27] these. If you just had the Bible, you
[1:26:30] got the same authority. But how much
[1:26:32] more tonight that you have, oh my
[1:26:36] the God of the word.
[1:26:39] Now, I just finished telling you what he
[1:26:41] said. And these supernatural acts
[1:26:46] is to bring your faith back to him.
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:51] Quicken it right quick. See, make it
[1:26:55] quickened
[1:26:56] to him.
[1:26:58] Now, Brother Matt, you've been preaching
[1:26:59] long enough to know, let one
[1:27:02] supernatural act happen in your meeting.
[1:27:06] And what's the first thing you hear?
[1:27:09] You ready for it? By what authority do
[1:27:12] you do these things?
[1:27:14] Brother Jason, just let just let one
[1:27:16] supernatural manifestation take place,
[1:27:18] and here'll come that age-old question.
[1:27:22] By what authority
[1:27:25] do you do these things? Well, see, I'm a
[1:27:27] fully formed disciple.
[1:27:30] So, I followed my master's teaching
[1:27:33] and I followed his life. So, I handled
[1:27:37] it the way he handled it.
[1:27:38] Amen.
[1:27:41] They asked him, they said, "Tell us
[1:27:43] about what authority does have these
[1:27:44] things or who is he that gave this
[1:27:46] authority?" And Jesus turned around and
[1:27:48] said, "Okay, if you'll answer this, I'll
[1:27:51] answer that."
[1:27:52] Were you baptized unto man or unto God?
[1:27:54] How were you baptized?
[1:27:57] Amen.
[1:27:58] Prophet God said like this. We see in
[1:28:00] the Bible that Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:28:02] God, come when he came to earth. He came
[1:28:04] to rid sin and sickness, divorce it, put
[1:28:06] away it from his people, and claimed he
[1:28:07] would return again. But in his absence,
[1:28:10] he gave his church the same authority
[1:28:14] that he had. So, we would see Jesus. May
[1:28:16] the saints rejoice to see that in this
[1:28:18] great hour of trial that our God still
[1:28:21] lives and has the same power tonight.
[1:28:25] Amen.
[1:28:26] Amen.
[1:28:28] By what authority do you open John
[1:28:30] Ryan's eyes?
[1:28:33] Let me ask you this. By what authority
[1:28:35] do you testify you're going to take a
[1:28:36] rapture?
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:38] By what authority do you confess God
[1:28:40] give you the Holy Ghost?
[1:28:42] Come on, church. By what authority,
[1:28:44] Brother Jason, you confess God healed
[1:28:46] your body?
[1:28:47] By what authority do young people
[1:28:49] confess that God delivered me of this
[1:28:50] besetting sin?
[1:28:53] By what authority do you do you confess
[1:28:55] God delivered me from something? By what
[1:28:57] authority I'll tell you. By what
[1:28:58] authority? By the authority of the
[1:29:00] revealed word?
[1:29:02] By the authority of what was hid has now
[1:29:05] been disclosed has been uncovered and is
[1:29:07] now taken on flesh. Let our let our
[1:29:10] musicians come tonight.
[1:29:11] The same authority is in his disciples
[1:29:15] that was in the master.
[1:29:17] What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:29:18] saying that we have not received the
[1:29:21] spirit of bondage again to fear.
[1:29:24] But ye have received the spirit of
[1:29:27] adoption.
[1:29:28] Amen.
[1:29:31] Brother Luther, it's adoption time.
[1:29:33] Yes, sir.
[1:29:34] Whereby we cry, Abby, Father.
[1:29:39] What are you saying, Brother Andrew?
[1:29:40] Galatians 4:1. Now I say that the heir,
[1:29:42] as long as he is a child, differereth
[1:29:44] nothing from a servant, though he be
[1:29:46] lord of all, but is under tutors and
[1:29:48] governors until the time appointed of
[1:29:50] the father.
[1:29:52] Even so, when we were certain, where we
[1:29:54] were children were in bondage under the
[1:29:55] elements of the world. But when the
[1:29:57] fullness of the time was come, God sent
[1:29:59] forth his son made of a woman,
[1:30:02] made under the law to redeem them that
[1:30:04] were under the law, that we might
[1:30:05] receive what?
[1:30:07] The adoption
[1:30:09] of sons.
[1:30:11] And because ye are sons, how many thank
[1:30:14] God for sending a prophet?
[1:30:17] Prophet come and said, I didn't come to
[1:30:18] mix up a doctrine. He said, I come to
[1:30:20] straighten one out.
[1:30:22] Amen.
[1:30:23] To get you away from this fear and scare
[1:30:25] that you don't know who you are.
[1:30:27] Amen.
[1:30:28] You're not going to be the sons of God.
[1:30:31] See, you already were the sons of God.
[1:30:34] You always were the sons of God.
[1:30:40] Now, now I I felt something on that. So,
[1:30:42] I'll just preach it for a second. It's
[1:30:43] in your church age book. He said, "A son
[1:30:46] can go a long time before he recognizes
[1:30:47] he's a son."
[1:30:49] Altar didn't make you a son.
[1:30:52] Hearing the message didn't make you a
[1:30:54] son.
[1:30:58] The seed on the inside of you.
[1:31:01] Quickened by the spirit.
[1:31:03] That's right.
[1:31:04] Now, brother Andrew, what are you
[1:31:05] getting at? I'm saying and because you
[1:31:07] are sons, God has sent forth a spirit of
[1:31:09] his son into your hearts crying ab
[1:31:13] father. Wherefore thou art no more a
[1:31:16] servant but a son.
[1:31:19] And if a son than an heir of God through
[1:31:23] Christ.
[1:31:24] What are you saying brother Andrew? I'm
[1:31:26] saying without this message we are
[1:31:29] church members.
[1:31:32] But with this message,
[1:31:34] we have become the authoritative
[1:31:36] disciples of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:38] Then when this son become a certain age,
[1:31:40] he took the son out and adopted or
[1:31:41] positionally placed that son. And then
[1:31:43] from that day on, that son's name on the
[1:31:45] check was just as good as his daddy's
[1:31:47] name.
[1:31:48] We as heir of all things, he was tuned
[1:31:50] to become of age. And this Pentecostal
[1:31:52] church has had 51 years of growth. Why
[1:31:54] ain't we of age? He says, "Because that
[1:31:57] the Holy Spirit has to bring the message
[1:32:01] that we broke oursel up in
[1:32:02] denominations, drawn our fences across
[1:32:04] it, cutting in with the world, living
[1:32:06] like the world, prayer meetings is gone,
[1:32:08] oldfashioned services is gone. That's
[1:32:10] why we're not where we should be. That's
[1:32:11] exactly why the people won't stay
[1:32:13] placed."
[1:32:14] Amen.
[1:32:15] But listen, friends, you've come under a
[1:32:17] positionally placed message.
[1:32:20] You're an authoritative disciple of
[1:32:22] Christ. You know what that means? Who's
[1:32:24] hired is tired?
[1:32:26] You know what that means? Who's fired is
[1:32:29] fired?
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:33] How long is it going to be before we
[1:32:34] start exercising our authority?
[1:32:38] How long is it going to be before we
[1:32:39] start standing up and saying, "Listen,
[1:32:41] devil.
[1:32:42] Enough's enough.
[1:32:44] You've gone far enough."
[1:32:45] That's right.
[1:32:46] Listen, I know right now some of y'all
[1:32:47] are feeling like you, some of y'all, the
[1:32:49] devil chased you in here and right now
[1:32:51] you're ready to chase the devil out. You
[1:32:53] know why? Cuz the word brings strength.
[1:32:56] The atmosphere brings faith.
[1:32:59] The supernatural anointing comes in and
[1:33:01] brings an authority in you.
[1:33:04] But what are you going to do when you
[1:33:05] get by yourself?
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:08] What are you going to do when you come
[1:33:09] down off the mountain, brother Matt, and
[1:33:11] you've been tempted and hungered 40 days
[1:33:13] and devil himself standing there saying,
[1:33:14] "Just fall down and worship me and I'll
[1:33:16] give you all the kingdoms." Yeah. I tell
[1:33:18] you what we're going to do. We're going
[1:33:18] to stand like our master.
[1:33:20] Yes.
[1:33:21] We're going to imitate our master's life
[1:33:23] in teaching.
[1:33:25] We've been on an apprenticeship with
[1:33:26] him.
[1:33:27] You know what we're going to do? Now
[1:33:29] listen. If you stand there and tell the
[1:33:30] devil, I'm a preacher and I've prayed
[1:33:32] for so many people and I've held so
[1:33:33] many. You're not a disciple.
[1:33:35] You're not imitating your master. Your
[1:33:38] master stood there and said, "It is
[1:33:39] written.
[1:33:40] Get thee behind me, Satan."
[1:33:42] I wonder if everybody here tonight like
[1:33:44] to stand up and say, "Get thee behind
[1:33:45] me, Satan.
[1:33:47] It is written." Hallelujah.
[1:33:49] It don't matter how I feel. It is
[1:33:50] written.
[1:33:52] It don't matter what the doctor said. It
[1:33:53] is written.
[1:33:54] It don't matter what symptom says. It is
[1:33:56] written.
[1:33:57] That's right.
[1:33:57] It don't matter what the people think.
[1:33:59] It is written.
[1:34:01] I'm an authoritative disciple.
[1:34:03] I'm coming into my disciplehip.
[1:34:06] I'm ready to exercise this authority.
[1:34:08] Amen.
[1:34:09] What about it? Fathers, why don't you go
[1:34:11] home and exercise that authority over
[1:34:12] them devils?
[1:34:13] Say, get out of this home.
[1:34:16] Get out of this home. You ain't killing
[1:34:18] yourself 60 hours a week to make the
[1:34:20] payment and get everything done and pay.
[1:34:22] Get out of this home.
[1:34:23] This is my home. That's right.
[1:34:25] This belongs to me and my family.
[1:34:27] Satan, you don't belong in here. Get
[1:34:29] out.
[1:34:32] Well, glory to God.
[1:34:34] What about it?
[1:34:35] What about it? Get in there and say,
[1:34:36] "Satan, get out of there. Get out. Back
[1:34:38] up. Go."
[1:34:40] Well, listen. I've never seen you act
[1:34:41] like this before. I know, but it's a new
[1:34:43] day. Hallelujah.
[1:34:45] I recognize my authority as a disciple
[1:34:47] of Christ. And if you don't want to
[1:34:49] leave, my master standing right here
[1:34:50] with me
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] is in a meeting like this several years
[1:34:55] ago. I was preaching along these lines
[1:34:57] on authority of the sons of God. And
[1:34:59] there was a young man, brother Brian
[1:35:01] Hannah, sitting on the front row there,
[1:35:02] married to brother Wayne Lawson's
[1:35:04] daughter of Gracie, sitting right on the
[1:35:05] front row, had a had a shoulder issue
[1:35:07] going on in his shoulder for I don't
[1:35:08] know how long. And I'm just preaching. I
[1:35:10] didn't know what was wrong with him. He
[1:35:11] didn't tell me. And I'm just preaching.
[1:35:13] And I started telling a simple
[1:35:14] illustration, you know, about how when I
[1:35:16] lived in West Virginia, there was a
[1:35:17] brother in the church there had a
[1:35:18] business and his son actually run the
[1:35:20] business most of the time. And when he
[1:35:22] would go out on a job, I remember one
[1:35:23] time he went out and he told him, he
[1:35:25] said, "Listen," he said, told this boy,
[1:35:26] he said, "You're fired. You're fired."
[1:35:29] The old boy said, "Well, how do you fire
[1:35:31] me?" You know, he said, "You're fired.
[1:35:32] Get out of here." He said, "How do you
[1:35:34] fire me?" He said, "You're not the boss.
[1:35:36] Your daddy is." He said, "You're fired.
[1:35:38] Get out of here." He said, "I'm going to
[1:35:40] go call your daddy." So the boy went and
[1:35:42] called his daddy on his way. That old
[1:35:44] boy said, "Listen," he said, "when you
[1:35:46] call my daddy, my daddy's going to tell
[1:35:47] you the same thing." He said, "I don't
[1:35:49] think so." Brother Jason, he went and
[1:35:51] phoned his daddy. He said, "Your boy's
[1:35:53] down here trying to fire me." He said,
[1:35:54] "What do you got to say about it?" He
[1:35:55] said, "Pack your bags. You're fired."
[1:35:59] Pack your bags, you're fired. You know,
[1:36:01] and I just I just told that simple
[1:36:03] illustration. And Brian sitting right
[1:36:04] there, he spoke out and said, "I fire
[1:36:06] this shoulder pain. I fire it in the
[1:36:09] name of Jesus." He said, "I fired this
[1:36:11] devil." He said, "I went home." He said,
[1:36:13] "I was doing some stuff." He called me
[1:36:15] the next day in the meeting or told me
[1:36:16] the next day in the meeting. He said, "I
[1:36:17] was doing some stuff." He said, "And
[1:36:19] found out all of a sudden I was totally
[1:36:21] healed of it. It was gone."
[1:36:22] He said, "And if you don't want to
[1:36:24] leave, I'll tell my daddy and my daddy."
[1:36:26] Listen, friends, that's the that's the
[1:36:27] harmony that's between the master and
[1:36:29] his disciples.
[1:36:32] How many's ready to fire some devils
[1:36:34] tonight?
[1:36:36] Well, that old devil of nervousness
[1:36:37] says, "I ain't leaving. I fire you.
[1:36:39] Well, I'm going to go talk to your
[1:36:40] daddy. Go talk to him. He'll tell you
[1:36:42] the same thing. You're fired.
[1:36:44] Won't you bow your hearts with us
[1:36:46] tonight?
[1:36:49] I believe there's a faith bank of heaven
[1:36:51] in this building tonight.
[1:36:54] I believe there's a there's a revelation
[1:36:57] that has taken the preeminence in the
[1:36:59] church of the living God. It's the
[1:37:02] revelation the revelation of the son of
[1:37:05] man. The word has been revealed.
[1:37:08] Will there be one here tonight say,
[1:37:10] "Lord, make me a fully formed disciple.
[1:37:16] Make me an authoritative disciple of
[1:37:18] this word.
[1:37:19] Not a guesser,
[1:37:21] not a hoper,
[1:37:23] not a probe, not a not a well I think or
[1:37:26] maybe. No. Lord,
[1:37:28] place me under authority. Place me under
[1:37:31] the authority of this revealed word.
[1:37:35] Would there be a young person here today
[1:37:37] that could say, "I want to be under that
[1:37:39] authority.
[1:37:41] I want to be under that same authority
[1:37:44] as a young man, as a young lady. God,
[1:37:46] give me the grace to stand into this
[1:37:48] authoritative word,
[1:37:51] and drive these devils out of my life."
[1:37:54] God bless you, young buddy. God bless
[1:37:56] you there, sis. God bless you, buddy.
[1:37:59] God bless you, brother. God bless you
[1:38:01] there, sis. God bless you, young man.
[1:38:04] He's calling disciples tonight.
[1:38:07] He's calling disciples.
[1:38:10] Just before we pray tonight, is there
[1:38:11] any more? Say, "Lord, make me this
[1:38:13] authoritative disciple.
[1:38:16] I've been backing off too many times. I
[1:38:18] need to I need to learn to stand there.
[1:38:20] I want to stand there like my master.
[1:38:23] I don't just want to imitate his
[1:38:25] teaching. I don't just want to imitate
[1:38:27] the way he said things or imitate the
[1:38:29] way that he could bring out such
[1:38:31] profound, deep things. I want to imitate
[1:38:33] the master's life.
[1:38:34] I want to imitate his conduct. I want to
[1:38:37] imitate what I'm following. I want to I
[1:38:40] want to continue on this apprenticeship
[1:38:42] with you, Lord. I want to walk with this
[1:38:45] revealed word. God bless you. Heavenly
[1:38:49] Father, Lord, all across this building,
[1:38:51] Lord, you see your believer's hands
[1:38:54] been raised up, Lord. Father, young and
[1:38:56] old alike. Some, Lord, no doubt been
[1:38:59] serving you for many, many years. Some
[1:39:01] been serving you for just a few short
[1:39:03] years, but Lord, something something
[1:39:06] tugged at their heart.
[1:39:09] Lord, something pulled at their spirit
[1:39:11] tonight.
[1:39:13] Lord, maybe there be one here tonight
[1:39:15] that has been walking with this message,
[1:39:17] but things have been distracting them.
[1:39:20] Lord, maybe they're sitting here and
[1:39:21] they're saying, "Well, these things are
[1:39:23] too great. These things are too deep.
[1:39:25] There's no way I could understand such
[1:39:26] things." Lord, call them into that
[1:39:30] apprenticeship tonight. Call them into
[1:39:32] that call him into that walk with a
[1:39:34] master.
[1:39:36] Father, authoritative
[1:39:39] is truth. It's reliable
[1:39:42] and it's very likely to be followed.
[1:39:46] Lord, I believe I'm looking at some
[1:39:47] young people here that the life they're
[1:39:50] living has the ability, Lord, to lead
[1:39:52] other people to this message. I believe
[1:39:54] I'm looking at some elders that Lord,
[1:39:56] when they go to work in the morning,
[1:39:58] they go to their their their jobs or
[1:39:59] wherever they go, Father, school,
[1:40:01] whatever it be, Lord, I believe, oh God,
[1:40:03] they're living lives that'll lead
[1:40:05] others, seekers of your presence unto
[1:40:08] yourself,
[1:40:10] Lord, we surrender our hearts and lives
[1:40:12] into your hands. Make us what you have
[1:40:14] us to be tonight. If there be one here
[1:40:17] tonight, Lord, that has not received
[1:40:19] that baptism of the Holy Ghost. I pray
[1:40:21] tonight, Lord, you would seal their soul
[1:40:24] until the day of redemption. Father, if
[1:40:26] there be one thing between us, Lord, and
[1:40:28] you, Lord, may your spirit bring it to
[1:40:30] our attention. And Father, we'll make it
[1:40:33] right quickly. Lord, we need your grace.
[1:40:37] We need your mercy.
[1:40:39] In Jesus name we pray.
[1:40:42] Amen.
[1:40:44] Amen.
[1:40:45] You love him tonight.
[1:40:48] How many can say, "Let this revealed
[1:40:49] word take prereeminence
[1:40:52] in my flesh. Let this unveiled God," I
[1:40:57] love how he says it, Brother Jason. He
[1:40:59] says, "Openly manifested.
[1:41:01] Let this unveiling of God
[1:41:04] move into your human temple
[1:41:07] and exercise the authority of the
[1:41:10] revealed word." God bless you tonight,
[1:41:12] friends, as our our pastor comes. God
[1:41:14] bless you.
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:28] Come on and gather with me, friends.
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:34] Gather around.
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:45] Amen. Invite the front. Move up close
[1:41:47] and tight. We got a bunch coming from
[1:41:48] the back. Amen.
[1:41:53] How many feel authority in the air?
[1:41:58] I was so struck by that thought. Brother
[1:42:01] Andrew, I've I've been pondering
[1:42:06] that as a concept for weeks
[1:42:09] and just saying, "Lord, there's there's
[1:42:12] got to be something here that we can
[1:42:15] give ourselves over to and press in."
[1:42:17] How many are ready to press into the
[1:42:19] future?
[1:42:20] Amen. Press into the future. We're not
[1:42:22] here to go back in the past.
[1:42:24] Amen. I want to be a I want to be a
[1:42:26] fully formed disciple. Amen.
[1:42:29] Fully certified, fully authorized. Amen.
[1:42:34] We got prayer requests tonight that
[1:42:36] we're going to need to be fully
[1:42:38] authorized disciples of Christ.
[1:42:41] Three of the cases that came in to be
[1:42:44] prayed for tonight are are people at the
[1:42:48] point of death with cancer. I was just I
[1:42:51] was just talking to brother Tim today
[1:42:53] and we were talking about this great
[1:42:54] thing about the authority in the bride
[1:42:56] and seeing the devil. We've seen God
[1:42:58] heal some cancer.
[1:42:59] Oh yeah.
[1:42:59] And we've seen some of God's people been
[1:43:01] prayed for and still fighting and
[1:43:03] suffering and but fighting every day.
[1:43:05] Still fighting.
[1:43:07] Amen. I, you know, I'm I I just have a
[1:43:10] never say surrender attitude.
[1:43:13] I have I have said for years and I've
[1:43:15] felt it in my heart. I heard a old time
[1:43:17] preacher say it years ago. He said, "I
[1:43:18] want to come down and with my last
[1:43:21] breath, my last breath, I want to say
[1:43:25] Satan is a liar. And Jesus is the truth.
[1:43:30] Hallelujah. That's a fully certified
[1:43:33] authoritative
[1:43:35] amen. My goodness, friends, think about
[1:43:38] how that that's something that drew you
[1:43:40] aside. Did you Did Did you have
[1:43:43] something in your mind as brother Andrew
[1:43:45] was talking about? Something something
[1:43:47] drew you aside. You couldn't find God.
[1:43:49] You couldn't just break into heaven and
[1:43:51] say, "I want all the riches of heaven.
[1:43:54] there. There's no thieves or moth or
[1:43:56] rust over there. Amen. God had something
[1:44:00] revealed itself to you. And you know
[1:44:02] someone what I found out was that
[1:44:04] something turned out to be someone.
[1:44:08] Hallelujah. That's why that's why they
[1:44:10] can't argue doctrine. I don't care cuz
[1:44:12] I'm not arg. It's not something. It's
[1:44:14] someone.
[1:44:16] You argue all day long. You'll never
[1:44:17] argue me out of the love for my wife. I
[1:44:19] know her. I love her. And and she's a
[1:44:22] person. This message isn't a theory.
[1:44:25] It's not a doctrine. It's not words.
[1:44:28] It's a person.
[1:44:29] All right.
[1:44:29] Hallelujah.
[1:44:31] And I know him in in the power and
[1:44:34] resurrection.
[1:44:35] Amen. Hallelujah. I want to press on
[1:44:38] into the future, friends. I want to
[1:44:40] press on. My If you think about that,
[1:44:44] God drew you aside
[1:44:47] at a time of maximum
[1:44:51] sideshows. All right.
[1:44:53] Maximum
[1:44:54] in overdrive,
[1:44:56] sideshows, distractions,
[1:44:59] of every kind, every kind of way the
[1:45:02] devil can attract your attention. And in
[1:45:04] a time of maximum pressure from the from
[1:45:07] Satan's Eden, God whispered and you
[1:45:10] heard it.
[1:45:11] And you know what happened? All those
[1:45:13] other voices just turned into noise.
[1:45:15] Hallelujah. Oh my friends. Wow. Oh, I'm
[1:45:19] ready to be an authoritative
[1:45:22] Amen. servant of God. Hallelujah.
[1:45:26] Brother Aaron and Sister Ruth
[1:45:29] are sick and needing a touch from the
[1:45:32] Lord tonight. We sure are missing them.
[1:45:34] I know they're tuning in. And uh Brother
[1:45:37] Aaron, I think, dealing with some
[1:45:38] respiratory problems. And um I think
[1:45:41] Sister Ruth was feeling some effects of
[1:45:43] something, but I don't know have report
[1:45:44] of what it was. Sister Jean is still the
[1:45:47] devil just battling. Amen. Our sister,
[1:45:50] Brother Andrew, we are thoroughly tired
[1:45:53] of this. So, we want you to come and and
[1:45:56] take these requests back up and we're
[1:45:58] going to we're going to pray for Sister
[1:45:59] Jean. She was home tonight and and just
[1:46:03] just in pain constantly. This has been
[1:46:05] over two almost two and a half almost
[1:46:07] three weeks and she is just in agony.
[1:46:10] And I was thinking as brother Andrew was
[1:46:12] talking about that, I thought, you know,
[1:46:14] I'm going to change my prayer tonight
[1:46:16] because I've done enough asking.
[1:46:20] I'm going to start doing some
[1:46:21] commanding.
[1:46:22] Amen. I'm a fully formed Amen.
[1:46:25] I'm a fullgrown disciple.
[1:46:27] Hallelujah. And I'm fully authorized.
[1:46:30] Amen. To speak. Brother Bruce Paris
[1:46:33] asked us to uh just a reminder for Mr.
[1:46:36] Fritz, his four family members. four
[1:46:39] family members, all with cancer.
[1:46:41] My aunt Joel, who you all know, has uh
[1:46:45] they've they've called in hospice. She
[1:46:47] went from seemingly robust health and uh
[1:46:51] and just suddenly she went downhill and
[1:46:54] they've discovered terminal cancer and
[1:46:55] they've already called hospice in. Well,
[1:46:58] they can call whoever they want. I'm
[1:46:59] calling on somebody else.
[1:47:02] Amen. Amen. Um my daughter-in-law Rachel
[1:47:06] turns in a a prayer request. We're going
[1:47:07] to take up a prayer cloth here in just a
[1:47:09] moment uh for Sister Jill Fleman in dire
[1:47:12] need of a miracle. She's battled breast
[1:47:14] cancer for many years and they're
[1:47:17] talking about, you know, um her
[1:47:19] situation is very very dire and very
[1:47:21] critical and she's needing a divine
[1:47:24] miracle from God. I'm glad I know a
[1:47:26] miracle working God. I'm so glad. I
[1:47:30] thought about these cases tonight and I
[1:47:32] thought to myself, I'm so glad he's more
[1:47:35] to me than just a doctrine or a teaching
[1:47:37] or a theory or a degree or a something.
[1:47:41] I I know him in the power and
[1:47:43] resurrection. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:46] Amen. Um was that another one that just
[1:47:49] came in?
[1:47:56] It is. Okay. So, this is from Oh, the
[1:47:59] one that wrote to us. Yeah. Nicole, a
[1:48:02] lady that watches online, Nicole uh
[1:48:05] Gonzalez, not Sister Melissa's Nicole.
[1:48:08] Um, hello. I was giving you an update on
[1:48:10] my niece Kinsley Sers. I asked for
[1:48:14] prayer on June 9 from they thought it
[1:48:18] was seizures from a fever of 103,
[1:48:22] but they told her they really don't
[1:48:24] know. Uh she woke up, she was shaking,
[1:48:27] screaming, eyes, rolling back, fever,
[1:48:28] glossing eyes. She's doing better.
[1:48:30] Praise the Lord. But they are taking her
[1:48:32] to Columbus, Georgia tomorrow to the
[1:48:35] neurologist just to check her out. So I
[1:48:38] ask prayer for everything that
[1:48:40] everything comes back normal. Right now
[1:48:42] she's broke out with a rash all over her
[1:48:44] body while at daycare and asking for
[1:48:46] prayer. Um that I know God has
[1:48:50] everything under control and he's

[1:51:59] Heavenly Father,
[1:52:01] Lord, as we come before you tonight,
[1:52:03] Lord, Father, we approach you, Lord, on
[1:52:06] behalf of these needs. Father, you see
[1:52:09] each and everyone that was mentioned,
[1:52:10] Lord. Father, that child that suffered
[1:52:13] in their body, Lord. Father, for the
[1:52:15] family that has four members with
[1:52:17] cancer, dear God. Lord, our sister Jill
[1:52:19] Fleman, Lord, our sister Juel there,
[1:52:21] Father, suffering with cancer, Lord.
[1:52:24] Father, you know all things, Lord.
[1:52:26] Father, we pray is right here in this
[1:52:28] building tonight, Lord. We're praying,
[1:52:29] Lord. We're joining our faith together,
[1:52:31] Lord. Looking beyond the symptoms,
[1:52:33] Father. Looking beyond the
[1:52:34] circumstances, Lord. Looking beyond what
[1:52:37] the doctors have said in the reports.
[1:52:39] And Father, we're looking at a finished
[1:52:40] work at Calvary. And Lord, we're
[1:52:42] speaking by the word of faith tonight,
[1:52:44] Lord. Father, I'm reminded of the night
[1:52:46] that Peter was in a prison house. And
[1:52:48] Lord, they was up at John Mark's house.
[1:52:51] Lord, they were having a prayer meeting
[1:52:52] and there was Peter. He wasn't even in
[1:52:54] the room. Lord,
[1:52:55] the fathers, they begin to pray. The
[1:52:57] angel of the Lord left the prayer
[1:52:58] meeting and went to Peter's cell and
[1:53:00] opened the door and he walked out a free
[1:53:02] man. Lord, as we're joining our faith
[1:53:04] together here tonight, Lord, in this
[1:53:05] prayer meeting, Father, Lord, may the
[1:53:07] angel of God go to our sister Juel. May
[1:53:09] the angel of God go to our sister Gio,
[1:53:11] Lord. Father, all these needs that have
[1:53:13] been mentioned, Lord, may the angel of
[1:53:14] God be dispatched to their homes, their
[1:53:16] lives right now. Lord, may they walk out
[1:53:19] of these prison cells of cancer, Lord,
[1:53:21] healed, Father, may they walk out of
[1:53:22] these conditions, Lord. Father, we don't
[1:53:25] approach you, Lord, by what we've done
[1:53:26] or by all our marriage, Lord. But,
[1:53:28] Father, we approach you by this one
[1:53:30] thing. Not by might, not by power, but
[1:53:32] by my spirit, sayith the Lord. Father,
[1:53:34] you're the healer tonight, Lord. You're
[1:53:36] the deliverer, Lord. And, Father, we
[1:53:38] commit these needs in thy faithful
[1:53:40] hands, Lord. Father, I pray that before
[1:53:42] we even close out this service and
[1:53:44] before we even Lord, come to the next
[1:53:46] service, Father, Lord, may the
[1:53:47] testimonies begin to come in. Lord,
[1:53:49] may the testimonies begin to come in of
[1:53:51] our brother Aaron and his family there
[1:53:53] in their home watching, Lord. Father, I
[1:53:55] pray the angel of God that Lord, your
[1:53:57] prophet said, "Breathe the breath of
[1:53:59] heaven into the lungs of Jonah there,
[1:54:01] Lord. May the breath of heaven breathe
[1:54:02] into our brother's body. May it breathe
[1:54:05] out the respiratory condition, Lord. May
[1:54:07] the angel of God breathe through that
[1:54:08] home tonight, Lord. May it remove the
[1:54:11] demon of sickness and affliction, Lord,
[1:54:12] that they could return to the house of
[1:54:14] God Sunday, Lord, totally well, Father.
[1:54:17] Lord, we've seen you do it before. We
[1:54:18] believe you're here to do it again. We
[1:54:20] commit these needs in our faithful
[1:54:22] hands. Satan, you are defeated in the
[1:54:24] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:26] Satan, you are defeated in the name of
[1:54:28] Jesus. You have no power. You have no
[1:54:31] authority. May it leave every person
[1:54:34] right now. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:54:36] pray. Amen. Amen.

[1:55:35] exposes all of our needs. Let's sing it.
[1:55:38] We need you, Lord.

[1:55:42] worship him now.
[1:55:44] Make this song a prayer.
[1:55:46] Hallelujah. Before we head back out to
[1:55:48] that crazy world.

[1:56:32] right now.
[1:56:34] Make it personal. Say, I need you, Lord.

[1:56:41] I need you, Lord.
[1:56:44] Today, every day, Lord God, tomorrow,
[1:56:47] all next week, we need you, Jesus.
[1:56:50] Lift my hand.
[1:56:51] I lift my hands
[1:56:53] and bow my knees to worship
[1:56:56] and worship
[1:56:58] at your throne.
[1:57:01] Hallelujah. You're worthy of
[1:57:03] I need you, Lord.
[1:57:06] I need you, Lord, right now.
[1:57:13] Lord, that's so true. We need you every
[1:57:16] day, every hour. Father, we are
[1:57:18] determined to press our way into the
[1:57:20] future. Lord, our future is bright
[1:57:21] before us.
[1:57:23] For the world, it's a dark, sad time.
[1:57:25] But for the bride, it's a glorious time.
[1:57:27] The sun is risen, Lord, with healing in
[1:57:30] his wings. Everything we have need of
[1:57:33] for a rapture already in us, laying
[1:57:36] under the presence, Lord, of the
[1:57:38] sunlight of God's word. Hallelujah. We
[1:57:41] look to the future, Lord, with with
[1:57:43] eager anticipation. But Lord, right now
[1:57:46] we're fighting this great battle. The
[1:57:49] greatest battle that's ever been fought.
[1:57:52] Lord, this is the climax of all the
[1:57:54] ages. Climax of all powers coming to its
[1:57:57] zenith now. And Lord, you're determined
[1:57:59] one last time to prove to the world,
[1:58:02] Lord, that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:58:04] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:58:08] Oh, that's why you said, Lord, when they
[1:58:11] when when they said, "Oh, you're not
[1:58:13] you're not a man 50." How you say you've
[1:58:15] seen Abraham? He said before Abraham
[1:58:17] was, I am. Hallelujah. Lord, that I am
[1:58:21] is working in your body today in the
[1:58:24] earth. The I am is alive and well. The
[1:58:26] final voice to this final age. Lord,
[1:58:29] help us. Father, help us in these
[1:58:32] dreadful, desperate times where men's
[1:58:34] hearts are failing for fear. Chaos and
[1:58:37] madness are gripping the minds of
[1:58:39] humanity. Total insanity. Lord, we see
[1:58:42] it happening around us. Father, as your
[1:58:45] servant tonight pointed out, the very
[1:58:47] fact that the ministry of the son of man
[1:58:50] returned to the earth was a sign of
[1:58:52] impending judgment.
[1:58:54] Because it was that ministry of the son
[1:58:56] of man that came to perfect the brideg
[1:58:58] just before that judgment to give her a
[1:59:01] third exodus. Oh Lord God, we're looking
[1:59:04] for that hour. Hallelujah. Let us take
[1:59:07] this word home with us tonight, Lord.
[1:59:09] Let it mean something to us in coming
[1:59:11] days. We commit ourselves into your
[1:59:14] hands aresh now. We're believing for
[1:59:16] every request that we prayed over. Lord,
[1:59:19] we're believing for every individual
[1:59:21] request. Father, I'm absolutely
[1:59:23] believing, Lord, for brother Aaron and
[1:59:26] Sister Ruth. I'm absolutely believing
[1:59:28] for Sister Jean to be free of that pain.
[1:59:31] We're we're in a 100% agreement for
[1:59:33] Sister Joel. We're in a 100% agreement
[1:59:36] for Mr. Fritz and his family. We're in a
[1:59:38] 100% agreement, Lord, for this family
[1:59:41] member of brother Jesse, Lord, that all
[1:59:44] of these needs are now met in Christ
[1:59:46] Jesus.
[1:59:48] We thank you for it, Lord. We worship
[1:59:51] you for it. Commit all of it now into
[1:59:53] your hands, Lord. And for Sister Jill
[1:59:55] Freeman, we are 100% sure that the Holy
[1:59:59] Spirit is moving on that case. Father,
[2:00:02] we are believing for testimonies to come
[2:00:04] back. We've already had many and we're
[2:00:06] believing for more. We commit it to you
[2:00:08] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[2:00:13] Lord. Any testimonies tonight before we
[2:00:16] go?
[2:00:18] Praise the Lord. I got a testimony that
[2:00:21] the word spoke to me.
[2:00:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. And I
[2:00:27] sure thank you all for all your prayers.
[2:00:29] And it's uh you heard some truth
[2:00:31] tonight. I I am, as brother Dale said,
[2:00:34] fauning at the bit.
[2:00:37] And we're going to exact a toll on the
[2:00:39] enemy. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm not
[2:00:42] me, but the Holy Spirit will. Praise
[2:00:44] God. Amen.
[2:00:46] Turn around, shake hands with somebody
[2:00:48] standing near you. Say, "God bless you."
[2:00:50] Amen. Happy to have number of visitors
[2:00:53] here with us tonight. Brother Randy,
