========================================

[Music] morning everyone Stan gracious Heavenly Father we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ and we're so thankful for your grace and mercy to us in this hour Lord for having your hand upon our lives for t being the teacher being the guide being our absolute being our all in all we asked Father that you would help us this morning to get ourselves out of the way get the things that perhaps are weighing heavy on our mind put them aside and take the time just to focus on you Lord and turn our hearts towards you Lord forgive us for our sins and trespasses against you cleanse our hearts and minds that we might be a greater reflection of Jesus Christ in this hour we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen and we're gonna turn in the scriptures right away 2nd Timothy chapter 3 just a short verse there verse 12 yay and all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution amen you can be seated I want to start a new series called Christian character so this will be part 1 and part 1 the focus is going to be the paradox of Christian suffering so we looked at there and it doesn't give any exceptions all that live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution everyone all right so are we to expect an easy life as a Christian is that what God promises to us an easy life are we to anticipate that we're gonna float to heaven on a cloud with effortless simplicity if we do we need to rearrange our thinking as God is God's purpose to make our life easier are we promised our best life now are we promised to have ease and luxury are we promised to have no trials no suffering no we just read the scripture not at all so as a result of this this requires something of us this requires secondary character traits within us and we're going to talk about that but I want to I want to look at a few things brother Branham said greatest battle ever ever fought this is a this is a challenge to us when we look at Christian character we're not we're not here just to say hey everybody where we are I'm all right and you're all right and everything's fine I don't believe that's the role of preaching in the first place okay so we're gonna be hitting it hard let's just put it that way brother Branham says this listen you soldiers of the Cross when you disbelieve one word of God's written Bible you're disarmed you surrender you jellyfish put on the full armor of God amen were in a battle God's not calling us to be jellyfish God's not he's not calling us just to flow with the tides he's calling us to take a stand he's calling us to be strong and courageous brother Branham says in believe us now this in 1950 what's the matter with Christians wishy-washy half jellyfish get a backbone in you and stand up for God and what's right and today stand for what the Bible says and believe it with all your heart so this is the sub I believe this is a song of modern-day American Christianity and I'm gonna read this it's from the little booklet titled chocolate soldiers by missionary CT stud I may have read this before but it applies again here today it's based on that song and my a soldier of the Cross you may remember brother I'm referring to that song many times but he says he writes it this way about what the attitude of Christians in the 19th century and it's only worse today he says this I must be carried to the skies on a flowery bed of ease let others fight to win the prize or sail through bloody seas marked I'm Christian heroes never go to war stop in mind the babies playing on the floor wash and dress and feed them 40 times a week till the roly-poly pudding so to speak round and round the nursery let us ambulate sugar and spice and all this that's nice must be on our slate that's the spirit of Laodicea that's the spirit on American Christianity which that version of Christianity is being proclaimed on the airways and is infecting Christians around the world Joel Osteen and the prosperity preachers are teaching that we can have our best life now and that literally where this is a quote God wants to make your life easier this is the doctrine of the prosperity gospel and don't kid yourself this is affected do you think the mainstream thinking of American Christians and I'm sad to say I believe it's infected the thinking of message believers today God wants you to have an easier life a simpler life that's what we're seeking that's what we're looking after we're looking for for better things and better stuff and to improve our self in this world a sign of success is an easy and financially blessed life that's the viewpoint we have why because that's Laodicea that's what's all around us even our own minds we struggle in this life to see ourselves as a failure if we don't achieve a certain status of financial success I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing but they're spiritually destitute spiritually naked and spiritually dead and don't even know it brother Branham says in the church ages books communion church age the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval so we we need to change our thinking to God's thinking we look and say so and so they're a mess their life is this they have this problem this problem that problem and we see that as a sign of a failure as a Christian now that doesn't mean we go and do dumb stuff and put ourselves in bad situations it's not st. it's not saying that saying that sometimes when you look at a person you shouldn't say well they don't have the things of this life so they're not successful that's that's completely wrong thinking so I will continue on the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Stillwater's signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved in Christ that's that's how we're justified we have nothing to offer to God even our best that we offer to God God says I can't that's filthy rags I will not I cannot accept that in my presence the only thing he accepts is the righteousness perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ so don't think that your successful life somehow earns you the moral right to heaven because it doesn't it doesn't and there's people in this world okay we live in America we can't help that we can't change that we do our best with what we have we we seek to excel for the glory of God the results are up to him but there's people around the world that are suffering they have nothing does that make you better than absolutely not it's not a sign of his approval or disapproval whether you have a little or whether you have a lot but that's the American spirit and in it unfortunately infects all of us and if we don't fight against it will immediately look down on someone that doesn't have much of this world's goods it's a shame so I want to look at the paradox of the Christians joy in suffering it's a it's a tremendous paradox when you look at these things I'm just gonna read some not gonna give you the references we'll do that later I'm just gonna read some phrases from Scripture and every 10 phrases from scripture and I hope that it sinks in listen listen please closely we rejoice in our sufferings blessed or happy are you when you're persecuted blessed or happy are you and men revile you and say all manner of evil against you don't tune out it's heavy woe unto you when all men speak well of you count it all joy when you meet trials I am content with weaknesses and insults and hardships I will boast all the more gladly of my achievements no I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses I rejoice in my sufferings if you are insulted for the name of Christ you are blessed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing it's a paradox isn't it God has a purpose in our suffering God has a plan for us within our suffering it's it's not by mistake it's not an accident God is designing every circumstance in our life for a purpose Romans 5 3 through 5 you can pull that up but I'm gonna read it from the ESV so I don't know if you can pull it up in the ESV not only that but we rejoice in our sufferings so we can rejoice in our stuff in it from sufferings Paul says why knowing that suffering produces endurance I don't want to have endurance I just want it easy that's not what the how this life works and it's not not what the life of a Christian is suffering produces endurance and you're gonna need endurance jesus said he that endures to the end the same shall be saved and endurance produces character we want we want to have Christian character how you gonna get it suffering which produces endurance endurance produces character and character produces hope a person without hope really is someone who is extremely miserable because in this life everyone has troubles everyone has trials any even the people who have I don't want to get off my topic but people who have achieved the heights of success without Christ in their life what happens they are so miserable and so depressed why because all that they dreamed of is right before them and what is the result misery why because they have no meaning in their life the first their meaning was to achieve success they achieve it the meaning is now God what is beyond what is beyond this for a Christian we have so much beyond that there's so much beyond that and we haven't we so we have a hope we have something that we don't have yet that we're waiting for that we're anticipating will come to us and hope does not put us to shame why because we're hoping in the promises of God and God is faithful he never he never walks back on any of his promises ever under any circumstances hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us now this might help a little bit to think of this there are three different kinds as I see it three different kinds of suffering suffering that is common to all of mankind we live in a fallen world so everybody experience some pain heartache frustration of some kind you're not gonna get around that not until Christ returns it sets up the Millennial Kingdom second there's suffering because of our sinful choices we make a sinful choice and as a result there is a consequence both natural consequences and supernatural consequences ones that naturally follow sin and ones that God supernaturally allows in our life in order to correct us three there is suffering because our walk with Christ is contrary to this world order and that's what Scripture is primarily looking at when it's talking about being persecuted and suffering for the sake of the gospel you know we're not supposed to be loved and applauded by the world that's not supposed to be our aim it's not supposed to be our goal it's not our purpose in life we're we're looking to please an audience of one we're looking to get ourselves out of the way surrender ourselves to him so that he can do what he pleases within us and with whatever circumstance we find ourselves in we can be content and we can walk in him and be a living sacrifice so we shouldn't suppose that the Lord will will not allow demonic forces to lay traps for us we shouldn't suppose that he won't allow pain in our lives or that when you choose to do the will of God that suffering will come well we shouldn't suppose that it won't come because he promises that it will you're gonna be made fun of you're gonna be laughed at you're gonna be questioned why are you doing this are you crazy you're going to be told that you're a fanatic you're gonna be told that what you're doing and saying is hateful that's this world's viewpoint why wouldn't they say that Jesus said My Kingdom is not of this cosmos out of this world order so why in the world are we expecting an easy life and simplicity and people to agree with us we just want people to agree with us then you're following the wrong religion because it's not from this world order not only that but when you choose to follow Christ it means you stop following another thing and you're leaving something behind to follow something else and that immediately brings friction it Britt and it brings can bring suffering it can bring pain Jesus said I didn't bring come to bring peace on the earth but a sword dividing families and so on and so forth oh it doesn't have to be that way we can we can go with wisdom but the fact is when you say I choose Jesus Christ it flies in the face of what this world does and wants to do Matthew 10 25 it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household so Jesus was called the look you know what this word Beelzebub means it's the lord of the dunghill it's the flood it's it's it's fly it's speaking of flies so there I mean that is an unbelievable insult so if they call him that what are they gonna call you we should expect that you know it's one thing to talk about it and you say that's a good doctrine brother it is good doctrine but what about in your life on a daily basis what do you anticipate what do you expect what are you looking for Luke 6:26 woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets ouch we want people to speak well of us and we're shocked and dismayed when they don't why are you shocked and dismayed when people don't speak well of you you're to express your you should anticipate that that's the case you should understand that that's going to happen no you're not looking for it your heart is a heart of love your heart is a heart of forgiveness your heart is a heart of joy but people are gonna speak against you what's the problem so what they killed your master for what he spoke what do you expect that be patted on the back that gee thanks for telling us the truth well you might get that in church and we appreciate that when we do but you also might get in church where people are mad at you when you preach the truth so what should you do preach the truth again and take a stand it's it's fine that's all part of being a Christian you have to understand we're not supposed to be swimming with the current of everyone else we're supposed to be we're supposed to have a guide and it your guide my guide is not you you're your guide is not me your guide is Christ he's that of the church and so our purpose is simply to speak what's true if you don't appreciate it then don't appreciate it I'm not trying to hurt any feelings I'm not going out that way I love you that's why I want to speak what's true so we read that scripture already all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so you're living in the world's completely contrary to the Word of God again I said before the kingdom of Christ is not in the kingdom of this world there contrary to each other in fact they're at war with each other sometimes we miss this these two kingdoms are in a spiritual war against each other and you're right in the middle and you should expect to be involved in this war and and how does how do you wage war and how does the devil's kingdom wage war the devil wages war by insults by trying to destroy you by trying to silence you any way that it can okay is that how we're supposed to wage war are we supposed to fight fire with fire we totally don't do that Christ told us a completely different way but if we're living godly according to the character of Jesus Christ with his life expressing that life we're living a spirit contrary to this current world order and system therefore we you will suffer persecution if you declare yourself to be a Christian and live only in your comfort zone keep things easy don't confront confront don't say anything hard don't take a stand just try to make everything simple for everyone you're giving yourself a false sense of peace and of course you're not going to suffer any persecution why would you because you're just making it easy for everybody you're making it simple you're not expressing the Spirit of God your your conforming to the Spirit of the world and you say well I'm a Christian I got the Holy Ghost that's not possible yes Paul Paul was speaking and writing to Christian in Romans 12 and he said do not be conformed to this world so you can be conformed to this world as a born-again Christian you can also choose to be transformed by the renewing of your mind but it's up to you to choose you have the freedom to choose now that you've been set free by Christ before you didn't have the freedom to choose you had the freeze and freedom to choose only sin because that's what your heart was bent towards and my heart was bent towards now that you're free you can choose I'm gonna be conformed to the world or I'm gonna be transformed by the renewing of my mind so if we think there's no persecution just a second I want to back up we got in the in the in thinking about the rapture and the bride will not go through the tribulation period she will not suffer the wrath of God but we can't take that and say we're not going to be persecuted in this age we're not going to suffer we're not gonna have to no we're not gonna be thrown into where God is pouring out his wrath that's absolutely true but to say that we're not going to be persecuted and we're not gonna suffer that's against the scripture completely against those are two different things that we're talking about I mean if you want to look and go through go through the line you can can recall different prayer requests and testimonies of people who have they believe this message standing for this message filled with the Holy Ghost and they've been in jail you know people have had their houses burnt down people face danger continuously because of in in India because of the Hindu nationalists there you know that those overt types of persecution are happening to the message believers in the brine all around the world you know in Russia they banned certain sermons and brother Branham and so churches are going to suffer because of that they're in China believe there's preachers that are in prison right now as we speak so we're going to be persecuted for the sake of right that's different than going through God's wrath and the tribulation so I think it would be safe to say based on Scripture that if we're not suffering any type of persecution well let me back up and just say it a different way we're not looking to suffer persecution we don't enjoy it in that sense we're not sadomasochists I can't wait until I get tortured for Christ no no we don't think that way that's not what we're taught that's not what Christ is talking about that's not the Christian response to suffering that we're just going to you know run full-tilt and do everything we can to become persecuted but if we're living for him truly we're going to receive I'll put it in a wait there's gonna be friction there's going to be people that do not like what you're doing there's gonna be people that express that they do not like what you're doing you might lose a job you you might have people try to kick you out of your home you might there might be things that happen in your life that are because you're speaking the truth to people and they hate you but if you're in silent you never speak the truth you'd never share that share the gospel you're you're never open with what you're standing for then you won't suffer persecution what should it be our response to being persecuted Matthew 5 10 through 12 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you I'm going to read one more scripture and Luke chapter 6 verse 22 and 23 blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets so now the picture are sometimes I get in my head growing up I spent a lot of time watching Michael Jordan play basketball and so this was kind of home that I was raised in and so we we spend a lot of time watching sports and playing sports but the picture I have is after Jordan made the game-winning shot you know early in his career against the Cleveland Cavaliers and it clock expires he runs back and he's just leaping in the air pumping his fist over and over and over again because they won the game that's what I picture us as Christians should be doing when we're persecuted when people revile your name when they literally blaspheme your name because of the stand that you take when they kick you out none of us liked any of these things none of us want any of those things none of that none of us are setting out to do things to receive that but when we do there's something inside of us that should happen it should cause us to pray for those people it should cause us to love those people agape love it should cause us to forgive those people and then because of that we're suffering because of the name of Jesus Christ we should literally leap for joy because we've won a championship we've won the greatest honor in the world to suffer for the sake of the Son of Man and so I just I want to encourage you to change your mind about the suffering that you experience because of your faith I want you to change your mind change how you look at it don't be sad don't be upset don't be hurt summertime sometimes your greatest wounds comes in the house of that your friends what am I saying sometimes your biggest hurts are from church people that you love so much why because you opened your heart up to them don't stop opening your heart don't stop loving don't hate them love them pray for them and leap for joy because if you're getting friction because you're taking a stand for him and doing what he wants you to do it now if you're just being ordinary and people are upset at you that's a different thing but if you're if you're taking a stand for him and you're speaking truth to people with love then understand you don't have any reason to be upset or hurt don't be hurt why was Christ mortally offended when they called him Beelzebub we're to be molded into the image of Jesus Christ so let's our should we be mortally offended when somebody insults us come on we have I've got so much more to cover here but there's there's a reason for our joy in the midst of suffering there's a reason that we can love there's a reason we can forgive there's a reason we don't have to be mortally wounded when someone says something against us we have some another place we're living for and another person that we're living for in a different City we're looking to appear amen let's stand up and pray gracious Heavenly Father we love you so much Lord we just want to count it all joy we want to rejoice always Lord we don't we don't have to be full of sorrow because of suffering and difficulties we have a resource of joy that we can draw upon we have a heavenly vision a heavenly city that belongs to us we have a hope that you will wipe all tears away there'll be no more suffering no more pain so whatever we endure for the moment is just a momentary light affliction can't even be compared to what you have prepared for us help us to have this new vision help our minds to be renewed Lord we give ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you
