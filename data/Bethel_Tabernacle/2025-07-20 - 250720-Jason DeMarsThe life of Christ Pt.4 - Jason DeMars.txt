========================================

As we read the scripture, Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 30. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice. Heavenly Father, we just want to commit this time to you, Lord. We ask that your Holy Spirit would come and take your word and write it upon your people's hearts. Lord, we we know our own weaknesses, Lord, our own faults, our own failures, the way we the ways we come up short. And we understand, Lord, that it is a treasure that is in earthn vessels, Lord. And so, we're looking to you, the spirit of God dwelling within us to to do all the good things, Lord, in our hearts. And so we pray that you'd write this word there and that because you wrote it there that it would change us and make us more like Jesus Christ. We commit ourselves to you in Jesus name. Amen. Be seated. God bless you. So we were speaking about uh bitterness before. And of course we understand we look at the scripture it says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby we ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. And of course, we don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit. But how do we grieve the Holy Spirit? It's shows us in the following verse. Bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, evil speaking. These are ways that we actually grieve the spirit of God. In we say away from us, but we understand we're sealed until the day of redemption. So it's not that we the Holy Spirit leaves leaves us but more like the influence of the Holy Spirit will fall into the background not even that the Holy Spirit will not be there to influence influence us subtly but when we engage in these things what ends up happening is the Holy Spirit just takes the back seat instead of instead of having preeminence through bitterness through wrath through anger clamor people speaking, the Holy Spirit actually takes second place. Not because he is second place, but because we have put him in second place &gt;&gt; or last place or however you want to put it. So, we look at these verses. I like to look at the NLT to get a different uh take on the interpretation of these different um descriptive words. Bitterness, it says wrath, right? So rage. So something more than anger uh a rage, anger, harsh words and slander. So we we look at this and we spoke before about bitterness taking a root and then it growing and producing fruit, being in the right conditions and it grows and produces fruit. And so as I look at this, you see that many times bitterness, the fruit of bitterness is varying levels of this. And I think as you'll see when we read in the next verse, another another thing is strongholds. Uh those those are things that actually also that's like the other side of it. On the one hand, you have someone that just blows up. They have bitterness and they just let it all out and they blow up. That's not good. &gt;&gt; But in some ways, it's better than the alternative. The alternative is just to shut down. You build a stronghold. &gt;&gt; For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. And so in our in our thought life, we can get stuck there. &gt;&gt; Amen. and through our imag. It's not wrong to have imaginations. God God even works through our imaginations when the word of God has preeminence. But when we are stuck in our own thinking, our own way of approaching things, our own imaginations about situations, about the word of God, about things in life, we're stuck there. And what that's usually the source of bitterness is we faced a problem with a person or a group of people and instead of instead of facing it, we come to we use our imagination to to come to many different conclusions about the motive behind it, the idea behind it, why it was done. And what ends up happening is you create a stronghold around that thought, around that attitude, around that bitterness. And so in order to protect yourself from the ramifications of your bitterness, which would be normally be anger and rage and so forth, I'm very spiritual. So, I'm going to get bricks and mortar and start building &gt;&gt; a wall around my heart to keep between myself and other people. And these are the things that will end up exalting itself against the knowledge of God. And it doesn't just have ramifications in relationships to other people. That's bad enough. What it ends up happening is it it turns into a ramification of how you respond actually to the word of God preached before you. You build that stronghold so that God and our people can get near your heart. And that that that is both are dangerous because on the one hand you blow up and you can assault someone or you can insult someone or you can even end up killing people. It's it's that side of is a lack of self-control and the other side is when you want to engage in excessive self-control that you try to bury how you feel about something and what ends up happening is you build build a wall around your heart and it's really not disguising everything disguising it because people don't know but they're going to look at it and say what's going on with them. They've withdrawn themselves. They don't want to talk. they don't want to interact and that's probably the uh you know the first thing I spoke about happens from time to time but the big thing with people who are Christians they build strongholds they remove themselves they check out they don't want anything to do with people and they can stay really religious at the same time and it's a danger because what it does is you will never bring every thought to obedience to Christ because you have a little box that you've portioned off and sealed off from the outside world and God nor man can go go near it. And the only antidote to that is just facing it first. You have to let go yourself and deal with it yourself and go before God and get rid of the you might be right to be angry. You might be right &gt;&gt; to be upset about it, but at the same time to hold it inside and not confront it and forgive, you're cutting yourself off &gt;&gt; from God. So then the antidote scripture speaks about is Ephesians 4:32, which is right after the verses we just read about grieving the Holy Spirit and let bitterness depart from us. Be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. &gt;&gt; And of course, we understand that if we if we won't forgive, there's one condition as Christians, it's if we forgive. If we don't forgive people who have wronged us, your heavenly father will not forgive you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we will cut ourselves off ultimately from the grace of God by holding unforgiveness in our hearts. And and again we this is this is like a side topic but many times forgiveness you may not feel it initially. You may not feel it for a long time but if you keep confessing that forgiveness the Holy Spirit will help you release the feeling feelings that you have. But if you refuse to confess forgiveness or do the action of forgiveness, that's where the stronghold gets built up and bitterness comes forth. And really what it is is is putting on an outward mask of obedience, assuring ourselves of our own safety without actually having the fruit of the spirit and the work of love on display in our lives. It's in fact it ends up having the quite quite the opposite. It's a great hindrance to the spirit of God working and flowing through us. And if we don't see our own weakness in this area, uh we have a problem &gt;&gt; because this is this is an area that any one of us can get going down the road the wrong one of the two wrong roads. The right road is forgiveness and releasing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. The wrong road is uh bitterness that results in rage or bitterness that results in a stronghold. Both of those things have to be we have to surrender that to the Lord. We have to do the the hard hard work of love and forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's the hardest thing. &gt;&gt; The easy thing that our flesh wants to do is to do those two things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the results aren't easy. forgiveness and love, the results, it the work is hard, the results are easy. But those other two things, the work is easy because it just comes natural to our fallen nature to do those two things. But the results are horrible. 2 Corinthians 10:12, "For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves, but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise." So Paul is saying this in context of his ministry and the vindication of his ministry. And he's saying there's apostles out there that have gone forth and they're comparing themselves with each other and they're using each other as their personal recommendation. So I'm in fellowship with this brother. I know this brother. I know this preacher. I know that one. My ministry is like his. My ministry is like that one. And Paul is saying, "Anyone that boasts, let him boast in the Lord and let the Lord commend you." And I think this goes into the life of Christ and letting letting go of things. Let especially letting go of our our own inflated egos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to is to say look whether I commend myself or defend myself or make excus excuses for myself and then compare myself to other people that's not the standard. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The standard isn't what brother so and so is doing, &gt;&gt; minister so and so is doing. This brother who's upstanding in the church or in the fellowship of people, that's not the standard. &gt;&gt; And if other people approve us, that also is not the standard. Those things can have a diluting quality. Diluting and deliluding quality. It dilutes the grace of God and the power of God in our lives. And it deludes us. deceives us into thinking when that we're just fine and we're okay when we're not. Paul says, "If we make people around us the standard of godliness, you're not wise. You're not walking in wisdom." As you read on further in this chapter 10, he says, "We're supposed to make the Lord our boast and let the Lord prove our works." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Self vindication is an indicator of pride. I have to vindicate myself. I have to prove myself. I have to make excuses. When you look at that that way, you see you see that making excuses and you know, you're pointing at someone else as being the scapegoat for the problems that you're facing. And and again, this is one uh blindness that bitterness has is many times when you when you see something that's happened and it hurts you and you point your finger at other people, you're missing the fact that there's actually a problem within you &gt;&gt; that you need to put bring before the Lord to allow him to to to to heal and to pour oil on and to to to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From that very thing that you're looking at and trying to prove I've done this, I did I did I did everything. Well, &gt;&gt; maybe, maybe not. &gt;&gt; But that isn't the point. That's not who we're supposed to look to. We're supposed to look to the Lord. The Lord is our boast. The Lord is our strength. And we want to defend ourselves, defend our position, defend our purpose and vision. When the Lord just says, "Would you lay that all aside?" &gt;&gt; Amen. lay that all down and die to yourself and let me be your portion. Let me be your purpose. Let me be your vision. Let me prove your works before before the people. We if we have to demand respect, demand that people appreciate us because of our connection here, connection there. Then we're then we're actually in a position where we're walking in pride, &gt;&gt; desire for self vindication. And this is the very way that the Lord turns and begins to resist us. &gt;&gt; Because God resists the proud and gives grace unto the humble. So God actually puts on his war uh outfit and puts his sword on his side and comes and fights against us when we operate in pride. And so he gives grace to the humble. It's the way up is down. As brother Brandham says so simply and humbly, the way up is down. The way down is up. And so pride focuses on self. And humility is not needing to focus on self, but to focus on the blessing and building up of others. Self-p protection and self vindication are outward indicators of pride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our boast is in the Lord and our vindication of our works is of the Lord. Don't don't let your voice prove yourself. Let your life prove itself. &gt;&gt; Let and then when the life proves itself, then there's a voice that follows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Romans 12:9. Let love going to kind of turn the corner the last 10 to 15 minutes and speak about love. So let love be without dissimulation. Abhore that which is evil and cleave to that which is good. This is this love is agape. And it says let love let agape be without dissimulation. Dissimulation speaks of ins insincerity. So and then when we look at sincerity is sincerity speaks of the ability to have the light shined upon it and it to reveal its own goodness in itself. So let love be with in other words he says it without but let it be with sincerity sincere love another place he says unfeigned love of the brethren it's the same idea what is a feain it's mean was when you fake a punch &gt;&gt; when you fake something so don't let your love be with a something that's fake but let it be sincere let it be real let it be genuine and Then right connected to that in order for love to be love you have to hate what that which is evil. Otherwise it's not love. Anything that doesn't any love that doesn't hate evil actually isn't love at all and cleave to that which is good which we understand the only thing that is good is what Jesus says God. &gt;&gt; And so all goodness is of God. So all you know real genuine love has God himself as the source. So again we have in this verse agape. Next verse it has the other two loves that the New Testament speaks of be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another. So kindly affection means is the word felo stoos. So that's two of the loves right in one word. Filelio is friendship. Stoay is affection or family love. And then then it says brotherly love which is Philadelphia. So there there's there's actually four different kinds of love in the Greek language. In the New Testament, it doesn't speak of aeros love, but there's four different kinds of love in Greek. And I think that's that's a huge point that we have to make in this day is that people use the word love in English. Uh let's just say unbelievers use the word love in English and they say this place has love. People are loving. People are the and it's you have to ask what do you mean by love? What is actually love? Because everybody means something a little bit different today. uh I don't want to get ahead of myself in talking about this but just briefly saying that actually uh what what love people speak about is love is actually a form of hatred when we define love biblically. So let me slow myself down and not get ahead of myself. So the four loves is agape which is divine love, filelio which is friendship, sto which is affection and aeros which is sexual love. So each of these are translated as love into English but they have all have different connotations and different meanings within that. So the human loves are Felio sto and aeros. If you think about aeros it it's actually in our modern sense it's falling in love &gt;&gt; that that process that takes place within the in humans. And I won't spend a lot of time talking about that, but um it it it's one of the human loves. And if you look at all the human loves, each of them contain a kernel of divine love, but each of them are not divine love in and of themselves. But human loves without divine love becomes corrupted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So unless unless our human loves felio sto aeros are balanced with agape love they will become distorted and perverted and they'll become complex forms of hatred. So think about this for a moment. Let's consider some situations where people use the word love. But it's not love that is meant. So consider a mother who loves her son so much that she smothers him to the point that he cannot function as a separate human from his mother. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know how to take care of himself. He isn't allowed to find a wife because it would break his mother's heart. Every everyone would say, "Wow, that mother sure loves her son from the outside." But is it love if it stifles and damages growth and the independence of her son? &gt;&gt; No, it isn't love. She's attached to him out of the lack that she has in her own life, but it isn't love. Right? &gt;&gt; Consider a father that dotes on, spends all his time, spends all his money, and he's protecting and guarding his daughters without allowing them to grow, and focuses all his energy on loving his daughter without spending time and energy on his wife. If he had his if he had love in his heart, he would know that he needed to order his love properly. Without ordering your love properly, it's corrupted. And in trying to protect and guard and build up his daughter, he's actually in the long run damaging her because the best he can give to his daughter is to love his mother well. Love the daughter's mother well. &gt;&gt; That's that would be the best love. Consider a mother who in a tragic turn of events, you know, at a young age lost her son and she spends the rest of her life mourning and complaining about the fact that she lost her son. She's drowning in sorrow and every step that she makes, she makes her husband and her other children miserable through her bitterness. What is it? She made an idol. Her love has become an idol out of her deceased son, and she makes everyone bow down to that idol of of sorrow and pain. She'll constantly tell you how much she loved her son. But if she had actual love in her heart, she would learn to move on and let go of bitterness and love her family well. &gt;&gt; Amen. love begins to be a demon the moment he begins to be a god. I'm going to let that sink in and and break that down a little bit. So when you when love let let me let me back up and put it this way. In other words, when when human love reaches its highest point, humanly speaking, it often claims for itself divine authority. And then that love actually begins to override all other obligations, right? &gt;&gt; It demands unconditional allegiance. When it does that, it actually turns in and becomes a demon and destroys both both us and itself. It corrupts its own self and corrupts those who have it in themselves also. I know that's that's a little bit of a heavy thought because we always see love as always being positive, but it isn't always positive. what we call love because without divine love inserted into the human loves it always reaches a zenith and becomes a god. Consider people consider the story of Romeo and Juliet. They fall in love and whoo what a story of love. They're literally insane. They've literally lost his mind. They won't listen to reason. They won't listen to anyone else. They see no fault in one another and they're willing to die for the sake of their love. Their love became a demon. &gt;&gt; And we can go on. A mother's love can become a demon. A father's love can become a demon. If things love is not ordered properly, it becomes evil. It becomes it becomes something that's awful. It comes becomes something that's distorted and ugly. Think about our modern day where you have all these signs that people put in their uh yard. Love is love. We don't see it as much here, but go to Minnesota and drive down the road for two seconds, you'll see 10 Lutheran churches that have signs like that. Love is love. And how could it be wrong if they love each other? It because it's it's evil because it's distorted. It's perverted. And that's where it is. It's literally demanding obedience and worship. If you don't obey me and worship me, you're evil. If the love is not according to God's program, it's evil. And it's not and it's not even love at all. As we talked about the word aeros, aeros, that's a it's a form of love. Absolutely is. God has planted it within us, I believe, to be able to continue to propagate the human race. Otherwise, if everyone went into uh uh marriage with a clear mind, they'd be terrified of the commitment that they were going into. But because there's such a thing called eros that overrides many many many of those things otherwise we wouldn't have any human race left. And so falling in love, it's fine. But if you don't understand it's the limitations of falling in love or that even many times you can hardly control it. It it simply happens. Just because it happens doesn't mean you have to obey it. There's a thing called self-control. &gt;&gt; Uh aeros misdirected is a demon. &gt;&gt; But a aeros between husband and wife sub surrendered to agape love is perfectly &gt;&gt; good and normal and positive. Understanding that it comes and it goes. It's not something you can't live your entire life like that otherwise you'd never make any money. You'd never be able to live. You'd never be able to function. But God uses it. But as long as we understand its limitations and understand that self-control is required and again love is love. No, it's not. There's none good save one and that is God. So unless it's the love which comes from God, it's not good at all. Human love without God is disordered and perverted. It's love. It's a form of love, but it will always grow into something that's distorted and causes pain and evil. So, we have two minutes left. I doubt I can finish this, but we'll get it started. So, what is divine love? It's election. The the proof of his love is election. We'll we'll just skim over this quickly and we'll have to pick up next time. That no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That's his prerogative. He's sovereign. But it's all with a purpose. So love that he the love that is elective love has a purpose to it. So what is the purpose of it? It's it's that you after you after you've suffered a while, you'd be made perfect, be established, strengthened, and settled. We'll go over it again in plain language. The very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection. So as we look at this, as we come to a close, what is agape love? What is divine love? Divine love is a power or force that extends itself for the purpose of spiritual growth. God has chosen you in Christ before the foundation of the world for what purpose? To grow up into Christ. That is divine love. That is the love that God has for us. That is the love that God wants us to have for one another. &gt;&gt; Let's stand and pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word. Lord, we pray that you'd write it on our hearts. Help us to walk in this agape love. You are love, Lord, and we're so thankful for that. We pray that the that the very agape love of God would be shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. Lord, help us to be molded and shaped into that. We commit ourselves.
