you greets you all in the name of the lord this evening amen appreciate everybody that was able to make it out tonight we've got a number of people just out in precaution and some of them actually sick and some of them had sickness hit the office where they work and so just out of an abundance of caution a number of families out tonight and so uh but we're glad to have all of you here amen i'm glad to be here amen glad for what the lord has for us i'm sure he has a lot amen amen you're looking forward to it praise god well what you know what brother jay that thing has just like uh completely stopped is that coming from the back or you think that's something i need to kill it and start it again okay no worries yeah i'm just going to kill it and start it again [Music] amen there's nothing a reset won't fix hey man let's see what oh there it is i like that amen just um fussy software so we're not going to worry about it amen praise the lord because um there's always an override button amen praise the lord all right let's uh have you turn in your bibles to hebrews chapter 12 this evening praise the lord hebrews chapter 12. i'm hoping tonight uh to continue in the little series that we've uh been working on here tonight would be part five of what is the true church of god i believe that god has a true church amen i believe that that we're it praise the lord i believe there's evidence to support that that we don't make that claim loosely but i believe there is evidence to support that and one of the the probably i would say the most telling evidence that we're taught is that when the word of god can come forward and you hear it and there's something inside of you a deep responding to a deep that not only can you not only can you identify with the word but you actually hear it and want more amen and it doesn't matter what it says even if it's you know uh sometimes the word of god deals with us real close we were sunday how was it we said that the the rubber wheels of the space shuttle uh come down and land on the road so uh tonight we've got kind of a mix of all of the above and i'm just continuing on in this series i can already see at least a couple more parts and so we're just trusting the lord that to say all to us everything that he wants to say now how many want to hear everything he has to say i sure have found that i have needed to hear a lot of this amen so hebrews chapter 12 we're going to catch verses 24 through 29. all right you have it say amen hebrews 12 24-29 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel now paul had went on talking about how you weren't you aren't come to mount sinai you know moses and all the children of israel went to sinai and the mountain was on fire and the ground did shake but you've not come to that mountain but you've come to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel so so how many are glad to come to jesus he he's the one who mediates this new covenant between god and the people and to the sprinkled blood which as paul is saying here the sprinkled blood here under under under this new covenant is going to speak of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of abel did make sense all right so it's a new covenant it doesn't cry for vengeance it cries for forgiveness all right see that verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not now this is back there at sinai for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice back there at sinai whose voice then shook the earth but now under this new covenant now he hath promised so it's his future this is a prophecy he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify here's what it means the removing of those things that are shaken as of the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore for this reason we receive a kingdom all of us under the new covenant all right we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our lord is a consuming fire so this means that all creation will be shaken and removed so that only unshakeable things remain you get it that's what's going on as the kingdom approaches amen that's what this whole prophecy is putting you on notice for that as the kingdom approaches and it's been approaching now for a little while see this is what brother branham taught us in the seventh seal when he makes a few mentions of things that have been going on all week and wondering if the people were catching it and he says you notice this you notice that he said what is it he's gonna he's gonna answer his own question it's the kingdom coming as it has been see as it has been coming the opening of the word is setting this bride the last gentile bride on the earth the bride that hears the opening of the seals that generation cannot pass away until until we're in the millennial kingdom all right now watch so so since we are so he says here since we are receiving a kingdom that is unshakable let us be thankful and please god how many want to do that by worshiping him with holy fear father we thank you for the reading of your word we give it into your hands and we ask now for the teaching spirit to come upon us lord that we might bring forth the bread of life and bring an awareness father of what's happening in the atmospheres around us i commit myself into your hands for service in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated amen praise the lord brother tony i should have a water on my uh microwave back there all right let's uh get my um powerpoint up and we remember we're starting on slide number six it should be or actually i'm doing it right here here i'm going to tell you to do it i'm doing it myself so if i hit this one we'll see if that's going to do it oh wait well let's try to hit the uh we won't uh slide number six so i don't know why this wouldn't be groovin but it's not but that's okay amen let me try one more quick thing here and see okay there we go got it okay so here's where we are so apparently jay i had to go ahead and hit that remote and use it in the presenter mode it wouldn't let me use the tiles okay so we should remember that so what is the church of god part 5 and we're continuing on our theme of a kingdom order now we spent a lot of time last week in a little bit of service prior trying to make you aware of that friends and i i would be hard-pressed to overstate how important this is that that you become aware that you become cognizant of the fact that we have entered a certain order just getting ready to lead in the millennium in other words we're not god's not going to come down and just say okay it's time let's all go into the millennium god has already been working on the kingdom of god because remember that your coming this this last bride this last age coming to the word of god in this hour and becoming that word of god in this hour that it is that accomplishment in you that literally brings the saints out of the ground they without us they without you catching that you're in a kingdom and the kingdom is coming and a kingdom's already here that kingdom is blending in to this life and as such then it it it makes a call upon our life it makes a call that we recognize this is what's what's god is doing and that there is an order for us to be living so no more are we able to live and get by under the partial light of the previous ages god is bringing a bride up the pyramid to the capstone which brings this bride into his very image now i want to i want to really i'm sure you get that so what this what this portion tonight is about is what happens when we don't do that what happens when we recognize it we see it you say preacher i hear you i get it i understand it okay i'll try my best but we're not very successful at it then how limiting is that going to be of the power of god in our lives and i'm going to tell you something friends we have entered into a day a time a shaking of the earth where you can ill afford to be low on the power of god you believe it we're the world is in a shaking time and this is part of the prophecy now paul is referencing haggai chapter 2 the prophecy he gave and i'm going to give it to you out of the out of the nlt all right if i can get it to work and if we can't we will not we will not keep fussing over it and it's not going to all right eufine oh there it went thank you oh that was you i said derek thank you okay bradley you just you just carry forward i'm gonna close it down and we ain't gonna worry about it all right let me make one change whoops don't want to do that very good all right all right so i i'm sure you're with me all right now so here is the prophecy in haggai chapter 2 that paul is referencing in hebrews 12. for this is what the lord of heaven's armies says in just a little while i will again shake the heavens and the earth the oceans and the dry land i will shake all the nations and the treasures of all the nations will be brought to this temple i will fit this filled this place with glory says the lord of heaven's armies the silver is mine and the gold is mine says the lord of heaven's armies the future glory of this temple will be greater than in past glory says the lord of heaven's armies and in this place i will bring peace i the lord of heaven's armies have spoken now there's various places in the bible where you can see who this heaven's armies are if you go into zechariah 3 we're not going to go there tonight but if you would go to zechariah 3 you will find that that that zechariah that joshua the high priest is given a promise that if you will keep my word and do all that i command you then i will give you a place to stand among those who are standing here so you have to realize that joshua the high priest was caught up into the courtroom of god and there was a heavenly host standing around there were officers heavenly beings and and and he's told that if you want to get here and stand among these that you see then all you have to do is keep my word and observe my ways we find that in revelation 5 you're going to see these armies again you're going to see the angelic host which is not necessarily the same as the armies because the armies is seen in the four and 20 elders it's seen in a strong angel standing there proclaiming who's worthy it's seen in john who's a representative of the bride if there's a sea before him and we find that these are partial glimpses of heaven's armies it's what's beautiful is that god is speaking as a family that he's saying to the world i'm here to tell you that when i bring about this shaking when i get ready to bring my kingdom the world's going to realize i've had a family all this time and now i'm actually going to be moving through you finally see her really clear in revelation 19 when christ comes riding out to get on with the millennium to get on with the with armageddon to finish the matter and to and to and and the marriage supper's already over the tribulation is winding to an end armageddon is now underway and he comes riding out and the people who see it wail because of him they're not happy to see him and these armies of heaven are with him now friends if i can show you that god is speaking as a family in zechariah 3 he's speaking as a family in haggai chapter 2 revelation 5 shows him as a family revelation 19 shows him as a family then you ought to be able to say there's a family and i'm in it and if there's a family that's not just a lucky thing to say oh great i get to be a family if you're in that family then you have a responsibility and i'm here to tell you that god is looking to you his family to fulfill his promise here in the last days so i want to say tonight that there aren't there is no option on this you're not going to be allowed and and i and i really i i want to come across in such a way that i'm warning you but i'm also reasoning with you and i'm also pleading with you if i can figure out how to mash all of that up and warn you as a watchman on the wall and reason with you to show you in the scriptures why what i'm saying is true and then plead with you please uh get in line get in step let your life be changed into the image of what god is trying to accomplish in his armies because if you don't if you don't then you're going to find yourself on the on the the unpleasant side of god's determination amen so so when we think about this now such a contrast between the two covenants and and there's a focus now uh paul is focusing on this new con on this new covenant and he contrasts with the covenant of mount sinai and and and and this contrast between a warning given on on earth and one that issues from heaven itself and god is saying i shook the earth back then but at the end time i'm shaking everything well how much are you shaking everything well what's going to be left that's not shaken the only thing that will be left is what remains after the shaking the world if you wonder why the world is crazy it's being shaken down some now here's the rub that if you find your life being shaken to pieces you might need to back up and think am i in the line and order of god's word because i know there's a shaking coming but i'm supposed to survive it and if i'm not surviving the shaking why not i'm a believer i love god why am i breaking under the shaking amen you with me all right so so we realized then this reference to haggai chapter 2 then is understood uh as speaking of the ultimate remaking of the heavens and the earth which of course is going to the millennium is going to advance that after the millennium after the millennial kingdom uh it's going to advance it more and just remember there's another war at the end of the millennium you remember that see so so what haggai is saying that that once i get started once i come to the end time once the world starts falling apart and and actually it's me shaking it and i'm shaking my family i'm shaking all families because i what are you doing god i'm purifying i'm purifying my family and in the process of doing that the whole world who can't take the shaking is collapsing and that's why you see the madness on the streets that you see the the craziness of the world is not an accident it's driven by god it's driven by prophecy it's purpose driven god is known about it all the time jesus warned that there be wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes and divers places don't worry those things have to be the ends not yet but there is coming a time when it is going to signal okay no more ages it's now time to wrap up and i'm gonna do a final shaking on the world and the whole world's gonna go completely insane and the only people who will survive is my family the only people who who will stand true to my word is people my family who i reveal myself to and so so we realized then that that that that whatever remains after all of this cataclysmic shaking whatever remains will be eternal now that's a huge point don't don't lose sight of that god's not shaking for the sake of shaking he's not shaking just to rough you up he's he's transitioning the world is transitioning and i can't stop it you can't stop it nobody can stop it and god has purposed it and it's happening all around you i would say to you today you better get with the program because the world is transitioning and what is it transitioning to it's coming back to its eternal day now that's beautiful because that because that means that whatever was original all right whatever was original that's what is coming back let me pull up something here so whatever was original that's what god is coming to now this means of course since everything that's original is what he's restoring that back to then then then that means that the power of this new covenant is to restore you to original and i just say thank god i just say thank god i thought about that today and i just thought he's bringing the world back to its original and the only way that can go forward is he's bringing you an eye back to the original and that couldn't be possible if he hadn't said a word to this hour that's the original word because the spoken word is the original seed see and it's the only one is the same seed friends listen the same seed word that you are receiving today is the very same seed word that he used in genesis when he created the heavens and the earth and when he put a garden there and made it beautiful when he took an earth that was in chaos and he reversed it all and made a beautiful garden i'm here to tell you don't worry about chaos in your life he can turn anything beautiful he can make it all back to its original so so that means then that none of the things listen now that means that none of the things a sin birth hung on me will survive i'll take that deal amen nothing that the sin birth hung on me nothing that happened to me in my life nothing that happened to you i want you to know something friends sometimes we get really tortured and tormented by our past and i don't just mean merely regretting it i mean the the thing that it does to our spirit and our determination and our mind and we find ourselves with weaknesses because of things that happen to us in our past and we get complexes and we have troubles and these things come upon us and i'm here to tell you that nothing that happened to me in my life that might have created weaknesses for satan to exploit nor the things that even i might have did to myself that caused me harm today i'm here to tell you in this kingdom time none of that's surviving i'll take that deal how many want that deal none of that is surviving this is the age of liberty and freedom and god is restoring your life to kingdom position brother branham comes to the pulpit in the closing months of 1963 preaches two sermons right close together in november the world is falling apart and it comes up later the world is again falling apart and we find that that that we now you know brother branham is going to reference hebrews 12 where we read our text that this is the time and he's trying to get the world to understand you're in that shaking time this is paul's this is haggai's prophecy this is what paul was talking about and brother branham is trying to tell the late great planet earth this is where you're at it's 1963 the seven seals have been opened the mighty god has been unveiled there's an infant bride now but she's growing quickly she's becoming mature and and world the more the more she matures the worse you're going to get the more she rises the more you're going to descend the more she achieves the more you're going to lose and we're here today where the world has lost every semblance of all of its morality and its value and its sanity and its reason and common sense they don't even have common sense anymore fear is stalking men fear stalking the politics fear stalking every every aspect and here's a pride with perfect faith looking at a promise and feeling the holy spirit moving our lives changing us from glory to glory none of that's an accident that's all happening it's all part of the plan now believers look at the chaos of the world all right and easily believers look at the chaos and easily accept that the time of shaking heaven and earth is here we look around at the chaos we don't have any problems saying it's here it's arrived now to you it almost feels like yeah of course it is who wouldn't know that you're the only one who does the rest of the world say they don't know it well if they know it why aren't they running to the word why are they still trying to fix it with another super politician or pass another law or give away more money or have another legislation or or change the educational system why don't they do that because they don't realize they can't fix it and they won't take god's provided way to fix it they're blind to it because they sowed to denominational seed and a prophet warned them and warned them and warned them and warned them if you keep sowing to that when the harvest comes and when he starts shaking the world that's going to be your crop you won't be able to have any other crop and it's going to take you to the mark of the beast but to the bride who has been sowing the word it's also going to bring her to a wee harvest in this hour the same listen friends just as sure as the world is crazy you're holy just as sure as the world is being destroyed you're going in a rapture one's not more sure than the other they're both the exact promise that god said this is what he would do he would destroy the world and he would take his bride out of it before it can happen see so believers look at the chaos of the world easily except that the time of shaking heaven and earth is here we certainly can see that we hear brother branham preaching on hebrews 12 we say there's a prophet identifying a prophecy and he's identifying it that it's happening right now but while believers can easily agree to that and they can see the madness of the world and they can agree that it's the time of shaking but they are too often afraid to realize the other half of the promise believers have a hard time sometimes believing the other half and the other half is not everything is being destroyed you understand there is a kingdom people who are going to stand tall in this hour i happen to believe i'm one of them i happen to believe i'm preaching to many of them there is a kingdom people who will recognize and who have recognized their day and its message there's a kingdom people who listen who leave here as overcomers and i don't care what the devil has in plan there is a people here a kingdom people who live here in victory who leave here as an overcomer i'm not just here to recognize that the time of shaking is here because i can see the craziness of the world i'm also here to say if that's true then i'm true because i'm here as an overcomer because god's word said i would be an overcomer and i'm allowing it to have it sway in my life i only need to surrender to live under the power of this new covenant friends the power of this new covenant it has power to allow me to let go of all of that baggage that life has put on me and live free you understand that that's the power being released on the bride that we now have a power all we have to do is surrender to live under this power of this new covenant because it has a power to allow me to let those things go whether i did them to myself whether somebody else did them to me whether it was in my childhood or it was in your marriage or it was in your old age or whatever is happening to you i'm here to tell you you don't have to be bound by anything we are in the kingdom age this is the age of complete total deliverance amen god has a kingdom power sure of course it's always gonna always going to be a battle but i can win it now i can win it now under this new covenant see god has a kingdom power released to the church to get zion into a kingdom position zion in the bible's always the bride that'll be important when i come to another part i'm not going to go into it tonight but we have a kingdom being brought into a position take courage because the kingdom is being formed into a position where it can't be moved anymore where when you you you're i'm gonna tell you some friends what you're being what you're being challenged to step into and what you're being offered freely to step into is a power coming from not just the earth but he's shaking heaven and earth and there is a power now being released that gives you the opportunity to be free of whatever your your sin birth brought on you whatever anybody else brought on you whatever you brought upon yourself you don't have to go that way anymore you can be free because that's the kingdom power that's released upon us and that is the kingdom that will never end he is shaking everything loose from our lives to prepare you for the millennium amen don't lose sight of that i'm going to show you an example tonight of what god is doing i want to make that statement again he's shaking everything loose from our lives to prepare you for the millennium now this shaking can really be painful this shaking can really put your life in a turmoil and it'll be god doing it you say well i don't i don't want to go through a turmoil then surrender and live under the power see he's bri he's shaking he's shaking everything off of you that wasn't in the original and it's those things that are holding you back from walking in the freedom so you know what he's doing he's shaking your life he's shaking your home he's shaking your finances he's shaking your health he's shaking your friends he's shaking your mind he's shaking your spirit he's shaking your heart he's shaking everything people say my goodness i'm under so much anxiety it might be god doing it all right now we're not talking about god bringing sickness on his children father ram said god don't do that but he does allow the devil to do it when it serves his purpose and i'm here to say you're going to get sick if you don't straighten up that's not even what my sermon's about all right my sermon is about that there is a kingdom anointing here that you don't even have to have that conversation you can go right around and bypass that conversation and just say satan doesn't matter what happened to me in my life today i'm free and i will no longer let you govern my mind and govern because i'm going to tell you something friends deeds begin in your mind and that's why brother branham would say people say oh the devil made me do it and brother em said no he never said you were sealed in and he was sealed out said you went out to him he brought a thought over through your mind and you entertain that thought and that thought became a deed and that's why the bible says bring every thought captive bring it captive bring it subject to the holy spirit the holy spirit of the word will destroy it immediately it'll start cleaning up your lives and it'll remove things out of your life and your home and your experiences that keep contaminating you because we got to go home friends we got to get out of here amen so the good news of the gospel it's not just that we can be saved by christ but that we are literally being renewed into the image of christ i just say take that devil i i'm not here to just say oh hallelujah he saved me no he saved me and he's perfecting me and there's nothing that the enemy can do to stop it my my part is to be willing to release everything about me and just let me be him see and when you don't do that now i'm coming to the reasoning and the pleading and the warning when you don't do that look for turmoil see i'll show it to you in the bible so this is god restoring the genesis image now the genesis image is when you stood uh perfect in his view how many want to go back to that he stood perfect in his view that was the first place brother brown said you never sin in the first place that was the first place in the mind of god before you were born in sin or or or or let's just make it a little more something we can get our mind around you know not only before you were born in sin but before you came here born in sin and accumulated a life of failures that now hinder you we've accumulated plenty haven't we come on come on we've accumulated i'm saying we i'm in this with you we've accumulated plenty i'm tired of accumulating hallelujah i'm telling i'm here to tell you he's shaking off their effect and satan is losing his grip on me his grip to move me his grip to to influence me he's losing that because i'm letting all of that go and i'm allowing god to bring me to a perfection slide number nine brother brad the gospel of luke now listen to this and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish see then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water so they were they were being tossed on a stormy sea now you're on a sea of life and sometimes we find ourselves tossed on the stormy sea and you say what is my answer and brother branham said wake jesus wake jesus he's in the boat he promised you he would never leave you the problem is you've let him go to sleep in your life you don't pray like you used to pray you don't attend church like you used to attend church you don't hear the tapes like you used to hear tapes you don't read your bible like you used to read your bible come on friends and what's happened he's he's you haven't lost your salvation you haven't lost your redemption that's impossible paul makes that clear it's impossible because then the transgressor once he's purged to renew him again would be totally impossible uh christ would have to come and re-die for him again so paul said there's there's no way that can even happen and so so we realized then that a prophet said what you need to do is wake him up in your life you're wondering why you're not surviving the storms of life wake up jesus amen see master master we perished then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm and he said unto them where is your faith see so take courage because even apostles themselves had to learn this the hard way a bunch of times so take courage if you're feeling like brother jason's getting going a little bit too much on the warning side and could you go back to the pleading side could we just reason together a little bit more okay let me give you a little little little piece of candy take courage even the apostles had to learn that the hard way jesus had to look right at the apostles right there they are these men who are going to where the whole church is going to be based on the doctrine of the apostles and prophets and they've got to have jesus look them in the eye and go where was your faith you saw what i did you're my family uh where's your faith why are you afraid see and so if we go to slide 10 we're going to look at james chapter 1 verse 5 to 8 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea man this sea this storm stormy seas there's something there's something going on here all right for he is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so if i've got an unstable son i'm not going to give him the keys to the car i'm not going to i'm not going to let him go on a vacation all expenses paid because he's unstable i got up training how to live in the world i've got to train him how to take responsibility this is what james is saying god's a father and he's you're never gonna get anything from him if you're unstable if you're unstable in your mind listen friends if you're unstable in your faith you're unstable in all your ways and i have seen that i have seen that people who are double-minded and weak in faith they're unstable in their marriages they're unstable in their friendships they're unstable in their finances they're unstable in their reputation they're unstable in their testimony they're unstable in in in their lifestyle they're unstable in their prayer life they're unstable in church attendance they're unstable in fellowship they're unst they're unstable in all their ways everything around them has instability through it see this is not to be for the kingdom people this is not god's purpose for your life you're a kingdom nation see there is what you think and then there is what god thinks you say what does he think whatever he says in his word you might think of yourself as a failure that's not what his word says you might think that the devil's got you thinking you don't stand a chance because you got too many weaknesses but that's not what god thinks but if you you might think you can't get healed because you've been prayed for so many times you just can't get healed but that's not what his word says say his word says he'll heal me no says you're already healed see so as soon as you immediately as soon as you think i can't be healed you've already broke the word you don't got to go and nanosecond after that as soon as you determine oh i can i must can't get healed god must not he must not want to heal me that's not according to his word see this is why brother branham would say and there's quotes for it he said he said every person down that line down that wall waiting to be prayed for he said i'm just as sure as anything that god wants to heal every last single solitary one of them and there were meetings that god did heal every last single solitary person brother brown talks about it comes to a meeting and refers back to a meeting in grass valley california and he said the power of god was so great and the sincerity the people's heart was so great and faith was so high he said every single person that was sick left healed there wasn't one affliction left when those meetings were over i want to tell you something friends that's the power of god that's when and all and those people weren't better than you but they were sincere before god see if anything has astounded me over the years of ministry this people's willingness wow i that's not a strong enough word probably determination people tenacity comes to my mind the the determination the tenacious determination to believe what they want to believe when it's not true people get things fixed in their mind and you can't move them no matter how many scriptures you've got no matter how many quotes you can't bring them up out of the out of the pits of despair you can't get them to believe for their healing you can't get them to you can't get them past their complexes it doesn't matter how hard you try they with tenacious determination they hold on to it and they wound themselves and they live underprivileged constantly see people live in the chains of their past lingering pain lingering in defeat lingering holding holding the holding the key of deliverance in their hand hold on to pain hold on to complexes never will let them go and holding the key of deliverance in their hand what a sad story that is don't do it kingdom people don't do it don't do it kingdom people you're free the lord has made you free in this hour you don't have to let the devil keep bringing you back to that place of defeat over and over if you cannot claim the promise of god and believe it and make your body obey it you're suffering double-mindedness if you can't make your body obey god's word in holiness if you can't make your mind have faith in god's promise you're done you're you're suffering from a sickness called double-mindedness it's an instability that ought not to be in the family of god now i'm gonna give you another piece of candy thank god it's not a death sentence you can be set free i'm here to tell you something friends you can be set free from every besetting sin you can be set free from every weakness you're you're you you you can go free of every fear you can go free of whatever is holding you back uh i'm here to tell you you've arrived at the time where you have the ability to breathe free air amen and just take in the air of freedom and say i i the kingdom is coming and the word is here and i'm a child of god and i'm not going to get held back anymore i'm catching up to the rest of the family of god i'm not going to live a defeated life anymore i'm not going to let that be setting sin keep getting me over and over and over i'm not going to let my mind live in anxiety and fear i'm going to throw down every kind of offense and every kind of complex because i can [Music] slide 11 brother brad bradley ephesians 4 14 that we henceforth be no more children now look at look at these descriptive terms children tossed carried okay here's why the word comes here's why the kingdom age is here that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about see so so if you find yourself constantly tossed about in your mind if you finally constantly your your faith is tossed about your heart is tossed about your spirit is your spirit's always tossed about your heart is always tossed about your faith is always tossed about your commitment is always your dedication you're overcoming it's always it's always tossed you're up then you're down you're on point making good progress then you you get derailed again by by the curves that life throws you and i'm here to tell you life will just keep throwing them the devil will make sure it just keeps throwing you curve after curve after curve because he can see that every time you get a little traction and you start going down you're on you're in that train that glory bound train and you're starting to chuck down the tracks you know what he'll do he'll derail you he'll put a curve in your rail that you weren't expecting and run you right off out in the field somewhere and pile you up this is the kingdom hour that's not where we are to be living you need to grow out of that does that hurt your feelings listen everything i'm saying you had to say to me you need to grow you need to grow out of that you need to grow out of the inconsistencies in your walk you need to grow out of the complexes of your life you need to grow out of the fears and anxieties you need to grow out of that how many go say amen don't get quiet you need to grow out of that friends say why haven't i grown out of it brother jason i've been a believer for many years you have resisted god's child training that's come on that's the bold truth why haven't you grown out of it why haven't i grown why are things that that i should have grown out of years ago me brother jason things that i should have grown out of years ago you know why i haven't because i've resisted god's child training consequently when you do that your growth is always a problem it's always going to be a problem listen friends the role of holy ghost it's amazing to me that people talk so so glowingly about their holy ghost but the holy ghost is sent to grow you the holy ghost isn't a plaque you put on the wall the holy ghost is to grow you say i've got the holy ghost then let it grow you why do you keep the holy ghost standing in the corner with his arms folded because you won't grow see remember that the bible says that the the that the grace of god god's grace hath called us under his eternal glory you believe that i don't have it on the powerpoint but first peter 5 declares that but the grace of all but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that we have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you the holy ghost is here to establish you to strengthen you to settle you to make you a firm in your faith to make you a king's child operating by kingdom standards operating kingdom power in your life so paul goes on uh let's see did i did i include it that way okay that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro he goes on about how that of doctrine tossed to and fro there's doctrine that'll do it the slight of men will do it sometimes people do you wrong can you handle it no you can't how did jesus say to handle it when you get done wrong see how did jesus say to handle it when you're actually for real no kidding done wrong see by the doctrine by the sleight of men by cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive you know i i i wanna i wanna say something that really is for us all but i i hope that all the teenagers are listening and i got teenagers that aren't here tonight that i so wish they were and i hope that parents make sure they hear these words because these are these are some of the most important words i've heard in a long time now say oh don't don't the adults need it too yeah but for different reasons see teenagers the reason you both need to hear you and the and the older adults but for different reasons for you it's because you ain't live long enough to mess your life up and blow yourself all to pieces with too many mistakes so i'm trying to help you not to do that to the old head adults who have done that uh too many times you know you need unique deliverance from those things so i i and and this is one of the most profound things i've heard in a while i was listening to a sermon by brother paul lafontaine one of my favorite preachers in the global earth and i got uh brother hendricks sent me the link said hey you might like this send it to me from south africa i listened to it man i've sent it to my whole ministry team i said you guys need to hear this i heard preaching like this in so long and and and and i i was trying to think of the title but it's it's it's it's bringing your thoughts subject to the word of god bringing your thoughts subject to the word of god and brother paul goes into this breakdown where where he talks about how that the real threat you know whatever the manifestation is what whatever is is is in front of you that's whether it's a doctrine or a slight of man or a cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive or or or whether it's just a devil speaking to your mind that it could just be that you got me i got your attention where it might just be a spirit talking to your mind but brother paul made this nuclear point that's short and sweet but blew me away he said remember that every thought from satan to your mind has a plan behind it don't just think oh that's a bad thought satan didn't just go oh let me see if i can get him uh come up with something okay how about i put this thought in in that young lady's mind he's got a plan behind that don't don't think it's just him walking around whispering to everybody no he actually studies you he's got a file with your name on it he has watched you from the day you were born he knows your weaknesses he knows where this is this is us all adults too amen he knows us all and just remember this that when he brings a thought to your mind there is a plan he has a plan behind that and you know what his plan is to toss you he's looking to toss you see so it's so so it's not as simple as identifying a doctrine or identifying a man or identifying somebody did this to me or some scheme that you need to avoid it's it's it's more than that it's the supernatural plan of the devil being carried out to toss you the word tossed tossed to and fro it means to surge it means to be tossed in billows metaphorically to fluctuate see let's go to uh looks like slide 12. as the heart pantheth after the water brooks this is a deer as the deer pantheth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before my god my tears have been my meat not david had transgressed god's word david had not do you know when when when david starts talking about i thought on my ways brother branham goes down i love how brother brown describes it take a profit to know the heart of david you didn't know a 20th century prophet could discern the heart of a king thousands of years ago did you but brother rahm said see when david wrote those words i thought on my ways he said david was sitting there thinking about all the promises he'd made to god and hadn't kept him and it bothered him it bothered him and he was weeping and he was crying he thought about i made him this promise i never kept it i made him this promise and i i'm such a slacker i've never i never followed through i got so anointed when i was in the temple when i was at church in the preaching i felt so determined god i promise you i'm going to stop this i'm going to get rid of that i'm going to make this change in my life and david said i thought on my ways and what he thought about was all the tribes he'd made god a promise and never kept those promises now here he finds himself sin and iniquity terrible debauchery and now he's pleading with god please help me please help me my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say to me where is thy god when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day slight 13 why art thou cast down on my soul so he even tried to go to church to shake it off he tried to go around all the believers who were living in victory and they were worshiping god and he tried to just pump himself up you know church isn't just a pep rally friends judgment begins at the house of god we've got plenty to be excited about but i'm going to tell you something judgment begins at the house of god and it wasn't working i went to church i i hung out with the people praising god they went on holy day why art thou cast down all my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hold down god for he's he's literally trying to pick himself up by his own bootstraps hope thou in god oh when i he says so hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my god now look at him he goes back again oh my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermenites from the hill mazar deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me slide 14 jonah comes here these billows we'll tell you something friends we have billows in life then jonah prayed until the lord is god out of the fish's belly that's a pretty amazing place to be he prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and said i cried by reason of my affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice for thou hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compass me about all thy billows there it is again all thy billows and thy waves passed over me he's being honest in his confession to the people job isn't pulling punches or sparing himself tough language he had he had he had found himself you know resistant to god's will he had found himself when you read it in the bible i'm so thankful for election you read it in the bible how that god told him to do this and he ends up looking like to me when i read the bible looks like he did the opposite so much so that that that he ends up in the belly of a whale just so that he can go ahead and obey god's will don't have to get in the belly of a whale to obey god's will see brother graham said no he said he his footsteps are ordered of god he couldn't have been out of god's will god wanted to do it this way but the bottom line is job is in the belly of a whale crying out in repentance i turned his face toward the temple and prayed god help me god help me all the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me slide 15 brother brad that's a lonely place i've read the account of people lost at sea carried about on the billows they might be in a raft they might have a life jacket they might i read the story of a man one time was in the ocean for two i think almost two days and he had nothing just trying to tread water trying not to drown when you're trying to save your life your endurance can be pretty amazing it's a lonely spot to be there and that's where a lot of people live and the sad that's what the earth is right now and the sad reality is god has too many of his kingdom children dog pets treading water in that trying to make sense of why is my life so tossed why is this happening and why is that happening his billows are going over me i don't know if you've ever heard of the of the um it's called the kelvin helmholtz instability experiment now go ahead and pull up that first video and we're going to play that it's in its entirety it has no sound so you don't have to worry the other one we have time markers for but just pull it up and stop it just because i want to explain what this is demonstrating this is an instability experiment it's called kelvin helmholtz instability experiment now i'll try to explain it to you as best i can as best as i understand it so they're going to deal with the effect of sheer over water now there's all kinds of sheer that we can talk about wind shear we could have brother john uh phelan come here and give us a breakdown on microburst and wind shear that pilots have to worry about and that's because you can have you know up and down drafts adjacent to one another and you know a plane coming in for a landing can fly into that down or fly into an up and and many of them have crashed with microburst that's until doppler radar was put in they a lot of planes went down over microburst that that happened to hit right at a runway and i i was landing one time and a plane had ju all the ground was still charred in black it had just crashed the week before and killed a bunch of people in charlotte and you could even see where it went through the fence and burned up all the trees and everything and it was a microburst right at the end of the runway they didn't have doppler installed they couldn't see it and when it hit when it's a microburst is a downward hard wind and it hits and goes out like that and so when a plane's coming in it catches that up when he's coming in for a landing and it lifts him up so you know what he does oh i got to get landed he pulls back power i got to cut power well he don't realize that he's going to fly into the downburst and then his engines aren't going to spool up fast enough he'll push it all the way the firewall it won't matter his wings will stop flying and he'll crash and so that pilots are trained that when you hit when you hit shear like that give it the gas do a go around don't don't pull the throttle back see but that that's a that's a that's that it's amazing what windshield can do i was looking at some instruction things today it was incredible what pilots have to face all the things they have to learn about the properties of wind and change and direction and but as it relates to sheer over the top of water that what you basically have you say what causes all of those billows that i showed you what why do you drive across the river and you see all these white caps on a windy day because what what's happening is is the wind is moving quickly over the water in this direction but the water is going this way and it's moving slow and and that in the middle is sheer it creates shear and creates those billows and those white caps you understand and so they're they're they're showing in this experiment what they're going to do is they're going to take salt water and they're going to put it in a tank a long tank about looks like about 12 foot long in the first one about six foot long in the next one second one and in the bottom they actually are going to put some coloring in it and it's going to be salt water because salt water is heavier than fresh water and and then and then on top of the salt water they're going to put fresh water uh i hope i don't have that backwards i do have it backwards yeah the freshwater's sinks to the bottom and the salt water stays above and so what ends up happening they they color the regular water and then they put clear uh water in on top of that and what ends up happening everything is separated and the the the line if you imagine when you see this all you got to do is see this you'll see the line of separation very clear it's crystal clear the line between the fresh and the salt water and everything's fine until they tilt it like life can do to you sometimes and what ends up happening is when you tilt it the heavier water wants to go one way and the lighter water wants to go another way the water above is trying to go one direction because it's light it's trying to go up and the heavier water is trying to go down and and that line in the middle is is where shear gets created and that's where you live because above you is a vision of god god has a vision for your life now pay close attention but you also have a vision for your life yourself and everything can be fine as long as they're moving in the same direction at the same speed that god wants you moving amen the problem that happens in people's lives is god has one vision above which is going in a one direction and you have made a decision to take your life here below in another direction and that creates sheer and it brings billows you can see it in cloud formations you can see it in van gogh painted it in a famous painting it's called it's called it's what creates billows in the atmosphere it's what creates billows and cloud formations you'll see them sometimes and that's that's upper and lower currents doing like that instead of instead of going like this you got them going like that and this is god's plan for you to go this way and he's got a certain speed but you even even if you're going his way you might be going too slow and he's trying to get you to go this way and and but what happens a lot of times is god wants you to go like this and you want to go like that and you wonder why the billows strike your life you're about to see your life you're about to see what happens to your life when you do that make sure we've got a full screen and go ahead and start it this is the calvin helmholtz instability demonstration fresh water versus salt water all right now just watch there's the heavier water on the bottom lighter water on the top now he tilts it the lighter water wants to go uphill the heavier water wants to go downhill now watch what happens to your life that's you now they're going to zoom in you think your life is fine you're going you're just working a job that's all you're doing you're just living a life you're just you you don't realize there's sheer between your will and god's will and you think everything is fine until it's not and your life does that and david is saying thy billows have gone over me you know why because god's life wanted to go like this for david david's life wouldn't go like that and he ends up with billows there there's the demonstration continuing that's what happened to jonah that's what happens to me that's what happens to you now go ahead and i mean that look at the turbulence that's your life and people wonder why is so much wrong in my life here's a perfect demonstration let's go to the next one this one's a little bit longer about two minutes long and uh it's got some some sound which you can go ahead and play the sound from the two minute mark if you wish below the fresh water when the layers have settled here's our scientists kind of creating her experience if we don't have sound it's okay it's fine it's fine it's fine now watch the sun that way and the fresh water that way and there's our effect in tank one look at that that happens to two minutes that's what happens watch this watch it again look at that you can't stop it you say does god hate me why are so many things this isn't fair why so many things happening to me it's because god has a direction for you and you've got an opposite one and your life does that now they're gonna go here in a minute and they're gonna they're gonna draw it in slowly they'll just keep showing you demonstrations and then they're gonna bring it in they're gonna slow it down and they're gonna bring it in real close and i want you to notice here we go oh my life is good what's wrong what why is things turning bad oh it'll get better tomorrow no it's worse tomorrow lord please help me i'm okay the lord will help me lord why aren't you helping me lord okay surely it can't get any worse than that my goodness okay everything will be all right tomorrow uh oh no it's not getting any better what's wrong oh god must be the preacher's fault must be the deacon's fault it must be my spouse's fault that's got to be what it is it's my spouse's fault if my spouse would just do things the way i want to do them we wouldn't have this turmoil in our bills we wouldn't have this turmoil in our health we wouldn't have this turmoil in our children we wouldn't have this turmoil in our relationship why friends because there's a kingdom direction but there's an earthly direction and i'm here to preach to you tonight that you've got to go in the kingdom direction because if you don't this will keep happening it'll happen this year it'll happen next year it happened last year it'll happen every year and it'll just keep happening to you you can take it down bradley thank you it's not always the devil causing billows in your life still with me i'm only at closing time now i need ten minutes you got me you okay i won't be here this weekend brother diggs will be here to preach to you and he'll give you something fiery just don't sit on the front row there's no safety in a church with digs in the house you might be on the back road it's not going to protect you it's not always the devil causing billows in your life it's not always the devil causing billows in your marriage not always the devil causing billows in your finances it's not always billows it's not always the devil causing billows in your children not always the devil if god has a vision for your life that's the upper stream and if your lower life is going in an opposite direction you are creating the shear you are creating the sheer you are causing the turmoil or if you're just languishing failing to make progress there's some of you here that god has been calling for more from you for a long time and you're some of you are just moving at such a snail's pace you're you're you're living the bare minimums of spirituality i'm here to tell you something friends if you're languishing and you're failing to make progress and your your life is living yeah you're a christian yeah you're going in the direction but you're out of time you're out of sequence you're not in rhythm with the timing of the spirit for your life you're just hanging back hanging back hanging back i'm here to tell you something friends you know he's got that will for you and if you're not making enough progress billows are brought on by you god is not punishing you get that don't don't think brother jason is saying oh you're such a bad boy god is punishing you he's not punishing you at all this is a fact of the physical universe when god's got a one direction plan and you're trying to go in the other or he's got a speed for your life and you're not keeping up when wind goes across water and the water won't keep up billows if wind comes in and water's going the other way shear gets created billows god's not punishing you in fact his god is acting in faithfulness oh friends could i give you that love message from the lord jesus tonight he's not punishing you he he's he's he's he's actually acting in faithfulness to you by causing by allowing these billows in your life i read that where it said for thou this is jonah for thou has cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compassed me all thy billows and thy waves passed over me jonah realized god had thrown him overboard not the ship's crew it wasn't his shipmates that threw him over god threw him over he allowed men to do it you read the narrative they oh we don't want to do that jokes jonah said you got to do it or you're going down and so they finally as a last resort they picked up jonah and bound him up and tied him and threw him they didn't throw him at all they were only instruments of god god that's what jonah caught when jonah got humble enough to repent he realized god threw me over it wasn't my shipmates after all god threw me over it was god acting in faithfulness to his son you know where we are now now now we're back full circle now we're back to hebrews 12. whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but i'm also going to shake jason i'm going to shake all these families i'm going to shake heaven and earth i'm going to shake pastors i'm going to shake officers i'm going to shake leaders i'm going to shake families i'm going to shake teenagers i'm why am i doing it so that i so so that i can remove all the loose things in their lives see this is why a prophet comes and identifies hebrews 12 because now we have a prophet calling out to the last age that what's happening the removing what's happening what's happening pastor it's the removing of those things that are shaken the removing of the loose things in our lives why that those things which cannot be shaken may remain and i just say lord whatever's left of me let it just be your pure word let my whole life be shaken to pieces and now i i know that you'll shake whatever i won't lay down you'll shake whatever i won't give up you'll shake it out of my life you'll cause billows it'll create wind shear but i know when i'm done hallelujah i'll be in your perfect image [Applause] oh my precious friends so you see when the heavenly father sees you still so easily unsettled in your mind when he sees you still so unsettled in your maturity unsettled in your spiritual growth just know this you know that brother jason told you if you go home tonight remember brother jason told you if god sees that in you just know he's going to keep shaking you're not going to get out of it he's going to keep shaking the power of god behind the coming kingdom is here today it's moving in real time it's all preparation to make us unmovable in that kingdom that's how i want to be to make you why is he doing it pastor to make you unmovable say well if you only knew what i'd been through please you haven't yet suffered under blood give me a break you think you've suffered like paul did really you think you've suffered like jesus did who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself yet never opened his mouth went to the slaughter like a lamb you you think you've endured what the martyrs endured have your family slaughtered in front of you and yet they kept keeping on they kept loving god they kept going forward paul says here in acts chapter 20. i'll read you this and we'll we'll stop serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying and weight of the jews and how i kept back nothing that was unprofitable to you but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ and now here comes paul to the end of his life friends here he's coming now it won't be long he's going to write timothy a heartbreaking letter and he's going to say the time of my disillusion is here i've i've run a good race i've fought a good fight i finished my course and there's laid up a crown for me he says here to these ephesians and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me say lord whatever the devil could throw at me whatever life could throw at me whatever it's my fault somebody else's fault who cares whatever lord it's you you threw me off a ship i got swallowed by a whale whatever it was lord i want to get to a point where i am so shaken by god that i'm unshakeable and where i can say no matter what happens to me no matter who does this no matter what happens in my life no matter what my spouse says to me no matter what my children say to me no matter what a church does to me no matter what happens none of these things move me i am bound in my spirit to go forward none of these things move me can you say that tonight can you say neither count i my life dear unto myself that's the real problem friends we count our life a little too dear to let things go i your life is nothing you have no chance to save it if god didn't save you you're doomed i'm here to tell you friends he owes you nothing you owe him everything neither count i my life dear unto myself here's why why paul here's why so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god i want to be unmovable i want to be morning noon and night seven days a week 365 days a year i want the enemy to when he comes to me he come to jesus and jesus says the enemy's coming but he findeth nothing in me i just say lord let that be me let that be me lord whatever billows whatever shaking whatever you got to do lord let that be me tonight lord i came to church and i was wondering about these billows
