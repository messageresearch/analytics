chapter 3 we're going to start we'll just actually we're going to read the whole chapter this morning Ruth chapter 3 give you a second to turn there Ruth chter 3 and verse one it says then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with whose maidens thou W behold he went with barley to night in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy reignment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt Mark the place where he he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all thou sayest unto me I will do and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou the Lord my daughter for thou Hast showed me more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou follow us not young men whether poor nor rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than I terar tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the Kinsman part but if he will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee then will I do the part of a Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning and she lay down in his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came under the floor also he said bring the veil that thou Hast upon thee and hold it when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the City and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all the man had done unto her and she said these six measures of barley gave you me and he said unto me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day God bless you as you take your seats this morning the um the title that I'm taking this morning is God's Expressions as a father amen I actually I got inspiration for this topic Sometime Late last year but uh you know when the Lord lays something on my heart I put a note in there and I just wait until he opens it up to me and and it seems that he opened it up to me for today which how appropriate on Father's Day amen you know so there's a few men as that was a foundation this morning so there's a few men I want to look at in in the Bible this morning that especially stuck out to me as as in their character as fathers you know uh you go read the book of Ruth and and you watch this man by the name of Boaz and you see this incredible story of redemption amen Ruth was a moabit woman and the moabites if we remember from history they were a descendant of lot when lot and his two daughters had left left out of Sodom they had just escaped Sodom you know they watched they watched their mother turned to salt and and they were scared into thinking that there wasn't going to be any men around to be able to marry and and to have them conceed children so they plotted this deceptive plan amen they got with their father they got him drunk and they laid with their father in his drunkenness and there was two children born from that circumstance it was Ammon and Moab and the Nations that came out of that were the ammonites and the moabites and they both grew to be these Pagan Godless Nations um you know one of one of some of the history of Moab that we can recall if you go and read in numbers you know is the story of the prophet balum and and we've talked about that here before king the king of Moab at the time was King baac and if you're familiar King baac he was scared because the Israelites had grown great in their battle in their victories and so he had gotten scared about all those victories so he actually called that Prophet balum into into the country of Moab and he wanted him to prophesy against the Israelites amen because he was scared that they were going to overthrow him in his nation and he was desperately trying to get it this Prophet to balum to to curse Israel you know and so you go and you read these things Moab didn't have a good history amen Moab was you think about it there's so many negative aspects to the country of Moab how how could anything good come from this country how could anything good from it you you think back when you know even a similar circumstance you think about anything good coming from something so evil even Nathaniel when he went and asked philli he he asked that question about Jesus can anything good come out of Nazareth that broken place but it was done for that purpose amen it was done that way for a purpose you know the Pharisees might have caught what was happening if they would have read between the lines of the scriptures and read between the lines of things God wasn't going to come some polished way he was there to give hope to the Hopeless amen and we're so glad for that so getting back to Ruth you know Naomi when Naomi returned from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law that was widowed the history of that Nation followed her in her name everywhere she went she was always referred to as Ruth the moabit right the title followed her because of where she came from but you see this man Boaz Boaz had a father by the name of Salon amen and the wife of Salon also had a title that followed her for a long time amen hers was even a little bit worse you go back and you read the story of Rahab Rahab was a harlot that lived in the city in a in a city of desolation that was was going to be destroyed by uh by Joshua and all of those soldiers but there was a woman in that place by the name of Rahab amen and she had that title that followed her for a time but then there came a man named salon and salmon wasn't worried about the titles that was in her past amen God God brought to him a wife that was a virtuous woman not not virtue of of her past but what he could redeem amen what he could make new and cleanse and clean amen and that's all of us today amen we all come from a broken past we all come from Brokenness in some way some shape some form but God was able to take us out of that thing and he was able to redeem us into something new amen and you know when the opportunity came to Boaz to redeem Ruth this widow or what the world would call maybe unwanted you know a foreigner in a Strange Land and you you see that even clearly when Boaz in the fourth chapter of Ruth goes and he meets this near Kinsman that near Kinsman reacted when Boaz presented him with this opportunity he he I don't even I don't know if it says his name or not but he he says you know you have this opportunity you're the nearest Kinsman and you're going to be able to have this land and you're going to have this opportunity to have more wealth in your name and he wanted the land and he wanted the wealth but he wasn't willing to give up his own life and his own inheritance and share it with this woman from Moab you remember you're familiar with that story but that didn't matter to Boaz Boaz had a father named salon and Salon was also a man was that was presented with a similar opportunity that he was amen just a few decades earlier salmon was a man who had stood with Joshua during those times and when it came time to conquer that city of Jericho you know there was one in that City who God called out of that thing amen God called one out of that place and he and he gave her this this new title amen he gave her this this lineage amen the lineage of Christ came from her amen and it was it wasn't it wasn't because of her past it wasn't because of where she was it was because God ordained it to be that way amen you know and just because she held a certain title for a portion of her life life that title did not did not bring her or or hold her back from what God was calling her to be amen it didn't Define who she was amen God saved her and her family all of her family it says out of the destruction of that City and eventually the scripture says that she fell in love and married this man by the name of Boaz and by her they had a son and that son's name was Boaz glory to God God watch you watch these things and you watch how God is expressing his character through these men amen I believe that salmon must have taught Boaz about the love story of him and his precious bride and how God brought him together in the Supernatural way that he did of how God brought her from this past life and and of sin and changed her nature and it made an impact on little Boaz amen because when opportunity presented him presented itself to Boaz in a similar manner this wasn't such a foreign concept to Boaz because he had been influenced by his father and his mother Amen to know that God's ways are higher than our ways you know Boaz boaz's judgment wasn't clouded by the popular opinion or you know where Ruth came from or how his inheritance was going to be somehow jilted away from him he was pleased to share that inheritance with Ruth and all Boaz saw was her character and how she was a ver look at the what we read that how he said that she was a virtuous woman in the sight of of of himself in the sight of those that saw her that's what Boaz was looking at Boaz wasn't looking at what she came from Boaz wasn't looking at how she was already married and how he was going to have to take you know this other name and and and share his inheritance he wasn't looking looking at that he was pleased to share that inheritance it's such a beautiful picture you know and it and it leads to this this story we know this of redemption CU it's not about your past amen it's not about it's not about where you came from it's not about how many wrongs that you've done in your life your Redeemer wants to share his inheritance with you that is a beautiful story of redemption amen he sees you for what you really are aren't you thankful for that I'm so thankful for who you really are he's he's looking past your your current condition you know when brother brother Jason was preaching that last couple Sundays ago and he he sees the eternities he sees where we're going to be at he sees us dwelling with him he's not looking at just the Here and Now what we so focus on so often times he's looking at the finished product because he knows that he's going to have this eternal fellowship with his bride amen and that's what he's looking at amen you know the drama set up there you know I wanted to catch this too once Boaz took Ruth to be his wife in chapter 4 she didn't carry that title anymore as Ruth the moabit glory to God we don't have to carry the title of what we used to be anymore God redeemed us out of that life amen and um the drama set up there in the fourth chapter is really just beautiful we don't have time to get into it but you know Naomi tells Ruth I wanted to catch this uh verse uh particularly chapter 3 and verse 18 and I wanted to it just it just really spoke to me when I was reading this Naomi tells Ruth sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until we have finished until he has finished the thing this day I love that you see the story of our Redemption the story of your Redemption is one of chapter 3: 18 it's one of rest amen you rest in what God is going to complete for you amen you rest in what God has already done amen you rest in that because you know that your Redeemer Lives you know that he he already he's already paid the price he's already done the work work so now it's time to rest but I love that because I think in that span of time between the end of chapter 3 right there at the end of chapter 3 Naomi catches catches something about Ruth she she says sit still my daughter there was there was a certain amount of of anxiousness that she started to catch at first because there was this nearer Kinsman amen there was this near Kinsman that had the ability to redeem her amen and so so what she was to do was go and sit in the house and wait until he had he he he had finished this plan but when Naomi catches it she says you need to sit still my daughter because you know Ruth loved Boaz and she maybe thought that there was going to be this situation that that could destroy everything or or ruin everything I think that sometimes you just really get down into the nitty-gritty of this and it some times can dovetail us you know we know how the story goes we know that God's all in all control but maybe we get a little anxious from time to time of how God is going to how God is going to do a certain thing in our life or how he's going to bring us around or how he's going to bring our children or how he's going to how he's going to get get rid of this thing in my life but we should rest in knowing that it's already going to be done we just have to give it unto God we have to let our Our Redeemer do the work for us amen amen CU God's got it all in control amen and um you know our entire experience as Believers of the Lord Jesus Christ our entire existence as Believers of the message of the hour should be in that Ruth 3:18 sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall amen now that doesn't that doesn't speak of us sitting still with anxiousness that means a a sitting still of of peace and of knowing that God is the one that's going to finish the work in our Liv lives amen you know we have to put our hands up we have to surrender it because Ruth at that time at that specific event she didn't have anything to do amen she she was she was to sit there and her Redeemer was going to go and do the work for her amen he's already done the redeeming amen the price has already paid brother Brenham says this Revelation chap 5 part 2 1961 he says and when Ruth was resting it was a type of the church resting in the promise proes of God we have the earnest now of our Salvation we're not worried about whether we're going over there or not or where we're going that's right God said so amen God promised it and we've got the earnest amen it's done been received Christ has accepted us no way to get away from it now we're there amen all we have to do is just wait till that he take he's down doing the Kinsman redeemers ship we have the earnest of it right now waiting for the time when he comes back glory to God our Father is in control of it all amen it's not about listen Saints it's not about the poor decisions that you made it's not about your past life it's not about your failures all of that can be turned around as long as you can rest in knowing that God can do that for you amen you have to let go and let God do that for you amen and then watched through Salomon and through Boaz and through ra uh Ruth and through Rahab came a son by the name of OED and OED came to be a father of a man named Jesse and Jesse became a father to a man named David and through the years of these Generations the character of true fatherhood was passed down amen the stories of redemption told over and over again amen that was that was the expression of their fatherhood was to carry on what this what God had called them to be as true fathers and then David we know that David was a man after God's Own Heart and and even when in the new New Testament when when people would say oh thou son of David who were they referring to they were referring to Jesus Christ amen thou son of thou son of David you see when when men allowed God to rule their lives you can see God's attributes really being displayed through that you know cuz to the outside perspective why would Boaz choose to take someone like Ruth you know he was wealthy his inheritance was going to be shared you know with with with some man who let who had left Israel and and married this Outsider from Moab but but God's purpose was far and above man's thinking of a situation amen why would Salon take an ex Harlot from a city of Jericho because God's showing that it's not their past that defines them amen it's not the poor decisions that you had made that Define you it's not your sins it's what you do when God gives you an opportunity to change that thing glory to God salmon Boaz OED Jesse those fathers taught their sons something of value something that was going to last them longer than some Earthly inheritance amen I want to look at this story and we're I mean this is another very familiar story of the prodal here in some closing thoughts this morning you know the the father of the prodal son you know just when Jesus tells this Parable you know he's expressing a fatherhood amen and you see Luke chapter 15 and we're going to just catch these verses and it said at verse 11 Luke 1511 and he said a certain man had two sons and a younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want and he went and he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would Fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and I want you to catch this verse 17 and when he came to himself amen how how how many of us can truly identify with that statement right there how you can how you can walk and say I wasn't myself before Christ there was something that had me gripped but when I came to myself amen and and I think that every believer has that man when I came to myself God finally I I I I was I was gripped by something but when I came to myself and he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and yet I perish with hunger and he says Verse 18 I will arise and I will go to my father and I will say un Him Father I've sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son look at the repentance there make me as one of thy hired servants amen and he arose and and came to his father and when he was yet a great way a far off this is so beautiful his father saw him and he had compassion and ran really the the core of this that that struck my heart is the expression of the love of this father because you you you see the verses but then you read between the lines of a verse and you as a father you know when you have your child and and it's born and it's and it grows there is just this new love love that you didn't even know existed amen there was just this this compassion and then then this love and this responsibility that fills your heart amen and it was pointed in this verse I mean you could see it his father the only thing his father had in mind was that he was about to redeem his son and that is what God has in mind for us amen he's not worried about he knows that the that the world is going to have bring baggage with you he knows that there's going to be but he's not worried about those things that's not even a thought process in his mind because he knows he can take care of all that his heart is he had compassion and he ran and he fell on his neck there's that there's a song and it's called When God Ran and when God runs to you he falls on his neck and he kissed him you know he wasn't thinking about the scars he wasn't thinking about you know anything he wasn't thinking about his past mistakes and he he was just thinking about the reconciliation he was thinking about how he was going to embrace his son he was thinking about all those nights that he had spent praying for his son he was thinking about all those nights that that that he had maybe heard the story of Ruth and it was a story of redemption right there amen you know the story of redemption looks different to many people you look at Ruth and you look at you look at uh Rahab then you look at this prodal it looks different for many people but God redeemed both amen and and verse 21 he says and the son said unto him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son now if you see the contrast I'm not going to get into it but you see the contrast of that prodal other son he had never gone off but he had this Pharisee attitude towards him that you know I you know I never did I've I've done everything that you've told me to do and now this son is he had this attitude but his father was saying but he's he's returned now he wasn't looking at you see God isn't looking at at the then he's looking at the eternity amen he's looking at how now it's going to be a whole perfect picture now amen and but the father uh verse 22 but the father said unto his servant bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring the fatted calf kill it let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be marry you know and and when you think of a Father's Love You know the world thinks it's it's raising raising a child and it's providing for him and it's feeding them and it's clothing him but it it goes so much further than that it's training them amen it's showing them who God is that's the important part of of training a child in the way that it should go it's it's it's not just in word either it's in deed amen it's an action you know and when this prodal came to his senses he knew where he could go amen he knew he would be better off as a servant in his father's house because he watched the character of his father growing up in his life he watched how his father treated his servants he watched that that there's something different about my father I've now been off in the world and I've squandered my my inheritance but but there was something different I've seen it I've seen all these things but there was something different about my father amen he had a certain attribute about him that I just can't pinpoint but I know that if I go to him I know that he'll treat me even better even as a servant that was the character of that father amen when Boaz came to this juncture in his life amen back to Ruth he had an example of a father who trained him amen I believe that you know OED would tell his son Jesse of the stories of of their ancestors Ruth and Boaz I believe that Jesse invested in training his sons and teaching them who God was in developing their nature because it showed it showed in their character amen the life of David sitting out on Green Pastures thinking and pondering the things of God I believe he was pondering those things that his father trained him up as a child aren't you glad that you have a heavenly father that is invested in you amen he's got it all planned out you know sure there's there he he knows there's going to be times where he has to correct you amen and there's going to be times that maybe he's you know disappointed but it doesn't matter because he's not looking at that he's looking for a repentant heart and he's looking for Redemption that's that's that's that's his heart amen amen and you can rest assured that his heart because this was Jesus who told tells that Parable his heart is like the heart of that prodal that father of the prodal so ready for you to return to him amen doesn't care about baggage that you might bring he he's not even thinking there was there's nothing in that verse where he's thinking about your past he's thinking about your future amen he knows he can take care of all that glory to God I'm so glad for my heavenly father amen we're just going to say a little quick little prayer here Heavenly Father we just thank you for this day Lord God we thank you for lord your word Lord we thank you for all that you do for us Lord Lord thank you for being our heavenly father Lord and expressing your attributes in such a beautiful way Lord expressing who you are in these in these stories father Lord in these historical events Lord Jesus we commit the service into your hands Lord we pray that you would have preeminence here today Lord we ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen e [Music] [Music]
