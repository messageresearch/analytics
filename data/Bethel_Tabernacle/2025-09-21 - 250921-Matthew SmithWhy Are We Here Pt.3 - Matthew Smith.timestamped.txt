[0:00] atosphere in a in a have a a unity of
[0:03] mind being be in a unity of purpose and
[0:07] father we could hear from you and hear a
[0:09] word from you through the Sunday school
[0:12] the foolishness of my small teaching
[0:14] here and that the into the worship
[0:18] service and then the main service Lord
[0:20] that we could grow and edify be edified
[0:24] by your holy spirit through the word and
[0:26] through the ministry we ask these things
[0:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:29] amen
[0:30] Um, I want to read, if my device will
[0:33] cooperate, um, want to go to Genesis
[0:36] chapter 2. We're going to continue the
[0:38] thought that I've been um, kind of
[0:40] pursuing um, title, why are we here? And
[0:43] I want to do a a quick uh, recap of um,
[0:47] couple take a couple points from last
[0:48] time and kind of advance a little bit
[0:50] with that. Um, so I want to look at
[0:53] Genesis chapter 2 and um, let's start at
[1:00] uh, we'll do we'll just start at verse
[1:02] 18. Genesis 2 and verse 18 if we could.
[1:07] Um, and um, we'll just begin here. It
[1:10] says uh, and the Lord God said, "It is
[1:13] not good that the man should be alone. I
[1:16] will make him a help for him. And out of
[1:18] the ground the Lord God formed every
[1:19] beast of the field, and every foul of
[1:21] the air, and brought them unto Adam to
[1:22] see what he would call them. And
[1:24] whatsoever Adam called every living
[1:26] creature, that was the name thereof. And
[1:28] Adam gave names to all the cattle, and
[1:30] to the fowl of the air, and to every
[1:31] beast of the field. But for Adam there
[1:33] was not found an help meat for him. And
[1:35] the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:37] upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one
[1:40] of his ribs, and closed up the flesh,
[1:42] instead thereof. And the rib which the
[1:44] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[1:48] woman and brought her unto the man. And
[1:51] Adam said, "This is now born of my bone
[1:52] and flesh of my flesh. She shall be
[1:54] called woman because she was taken out
[1:56] of man. Therefore shall a man leave his
[1:59] father and his mother and shall cleave
[2:01] unto his wife, and they shall be one
[2:02] flesh." Y'all can be seated. Um,
[2:07] so I want to I want to um couple points
[2:11] that I and I I want I made last last
[2:14] time and I kind of want to advance that
[2:16] a little bit. Um so the the the first
[2:20] point and this is sort of the uh kind of
[2:22] the overall main theme of everything
[2:24] that I'm doing here which is that um
[2:30] that that quote um uh if I can find it
[2:33] here
[2:35] um
[2:37] from
[2:40] uh no it's down here um this is from uh
[2:45] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[2:48] Um,
[2:49] he says, "Now, God had a purpose in a
[2:51] hidden mystery." Uh, no, wait, no,
[2:53] that's the wrong one.
[2:57] Um, yeah, here we go. Notice God has had
[3:01] a three-fold purpose in this great
[3:03] mystery secret. God and his great
[3:05] mystery secret that he had before the
[3:06] world began, he's got a three-fold
[3:08] purpose in it. And now, what we want to
[3:11] go upon this morning, what is that
[3:13] three-fold purpose?
[3:14] Now, I believe by the help of God who's
[3:16] present, he'll show it to us. Now, if he
[3:19] had this three-fold purpose, we want to
[3:20] find out what that three-fold purpose
[3:22] is. Um, and then in another place, um,
[3:28] uh, yeah, right here, he says, uh, and
[3:30] same same message, he says, uh, he has
[3:32] showed or revealed it in every type
[3:34] that's in the Bible. Therefore, the
[3:36] entire Bible is the revelation of God's
[3:38] mystery in Christ. The entire Bible is
[3:41] an expression of one goal that God had,
[3:44] one purpose. He wanted to achieve in the
[3:46] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[3:49] believers in the Bible has been in type
[3:51] an expressing what God's great goal is.
[3:54] So God through the entire Bible the you
[3:57] know the big question of why is humanity
[3:59] even on the earth why God bothered made
[4:02] making humans in the first place is to
[4:04] fulfill this three-fold purpose that he
[4:06] has. And if and and again for sake of
[4:09] time, I don't want to turn my recap into
[4:11] a rehash. Um so but but the the point
[4:14] was that the three-fold purpose of God
[4:16] is that God wanted to be a heavenly
[4:18] father. He wanted to be um and and to
[4:21] have uh children and and to express
[4:23] himself as a father. He wanted to have a
[4:25] a a bride and and express himself as a
[4:27] husband. And he wanted to bring his
[4:30] children through redemption back into a
[4:32] united family in a garden of Eden
[4:34] condition. That's what three-fold
[4:36] purpose was. Um, and so, you know,
[4:40] that's kind of the overarching theme of
[4:42] why we are here. Um, but there's and
[4:45] obviously there's a lot to that. Um, and
[4:46] effectively what that means is that the
[4:48] family and the family structure is a
[4:50] central part of everything that's in the
[4:52] message. Everything is in the message of
[4:54] the hour revolves around family and
[4:56] family order. Okay? It's the it's the
[4:59] it's how we all got here, right?
[5:01] Everyone's got a mom and a dad
[5:03] somewhere. you know, even if you don't
[5:04] know them, you got a mom and a dad
[5:06] somewhere. The fact that and the and and
[5:08] there's becomes a lot of hurt and trauma
[5:10] and and and suffering that comes from
[5:12] from having broken family structure and
[5:14] broke broken family order. Um, but
[5:17] that's not the original intent. That's
[5:18] not the that's not the plan that God
[5:20] had. The other thing that I want to that
[5:23] I mentioned last time that I want to
[5:25] that is more local to what I want to
[5:27] talk to today is that uh
[5:33] we talked about the type right that
[5:34] there was there was a type that God
[5:36] communicates through types. It type God
[5:38] communicates through types and shadows.
[5:40] It's how he conveys his word to people
[5:43] in a way that we can understand. And so
[5:45] when God lays out a type in the Bible,
[5:47] if you get on the in the wrong type,
[5:49] then you end up with consequences that
[5:50] you were never supposed intended to have
[5:53] um how we talked about how Moses how
[5:54] Moses struck the rock the second time
[5:56] when he was supposed to speak to the
[5:57] rock. And when he did that, it got him
[5:59] into the wrong type, which meant he
[6:01] couldn't go to the promised land. God
[6:02] couldn't allow him to go to the promised
[6:03] land. He had to he he died looking over
[6:06] the border,
[6:08] you know, never fulfilling this great
[6:10] purpose that he had in his life, right?
[6:12] I mean, Moses, you know, gifts and
[6:14] callings are without repentance. Moses
[6:16] was trying to fulfill the calling in his
[6:18] life, which was to lead his the God's
[6:20] children into the promised land long
[6:22] before he had a burning bush experience.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; That's why he killed the Egyptian in the
[6:25] first place and and had to flee Egypt.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Because he was trying to deliver his
[6:29] people, but without the help of God. So,
[6:32] he was trying to fulfill the g the
[6:33] calling in his life without the a
[6:35] burning bush experience.
[6:37] That doesn't mean that, you know,
[6:39] ultimately God would have him do that. I
[6:41] guess my my point is this is something
[6:43] that Moses was longing for and desiring
[6:45] for and it was what he was put on the
[6:47] earth to do. And so his whole goal was
[6:50] to deliver God's children to the
[6:51] promised land. And when it all came down
[6:53] to it, his life did not receive the
[6:56] level of fulfillment that it could have
[6:58] had because he got into the wrong type.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Right? He never got to see the actual
[7:03] culmination, the fulfillment of God's
[7:04] people making it there because he died
[7:06] before they got there because he got
[7:07] into the wrong type. That did mean that
[7:09] God did It didn't mean that God Moses
[7:12] wasn't a wonderful great man that God
[7:14] used wonderfully. I mean, the things
[7:16] that that the Bible has to say about
[7:18] Moses, man, if any one of us could
[7:20] achieve 1% of that, you know, we'd we'd
[7:22] be really something. Likewise,
[7:25] Christians, people with the Holy Ghost,
[7:27] you can be a child of God. You can be a
[7:29] real deal child of God. Really truly
[7:31] love the Lord with all your heart. But
[7:34] if you get into the wrong type, then
[7:36] you're going to end up with earthly walk
[7:39] issues, right? Moses' earthly walk did
[7:42] not ultimately have all that it was not
[7:44] all that it could have been because he
[7:46] got into the wrong type. He he he got
[7:48] into the wrong um he got on the wrong
[7:50] side of the of the word there. Same
[7:52] thing happens with us. We can be a holy
[7:55] have the Holy Ghost, but if you're not
[7:58] in the, you know, you're you're you're
[7:59] not following the type of the word in
[8:01] your family order, in your family
[8:03] structure, you can end up with all kinds
[8:05] of calamity. Doesn't mean that you don't
[8:07] go to heaven. It doesn't mean that you,
[8:10] you know, you're some heathen that God's
[8:12] going to cast out. It just means that
[8:15] now you have a bunch of train wreck on
[8:17] your hands that you have to deal with.
[8:19] It now means that there's a lot of
[8:20] fulfillment. the the the fulfillment
[8:22] that we have in our hearts to have
[8:25] family to have the desire that we have
[8:26] to have family and children and wife and
[8:28] husband and all these things may go
[8:30] unfulfilled because we got out of the
[8:33] order of God's word
[8:34] &gt;&gt; right those you know the the Lord
[8:37] promises you the Holy Ghost he does not
[8:39] necessarily promise you a a marriage
[8:42] right he doesn't necessarily promise you
[8:43] these things um because that some of
[8:46] that's on you some of that's on are you
[8:48] willing to follow the pattern of the
[8:49] word now if you follow the word, then
[8:52] he's faithful to he he wants it for you,
[8:54] right? God wanted Moses to go to the go
[8:56] to the promised land. That that was part
[8:58] of he had that desire for Moses. That's
[9:00] why he told him what to do to to speak
[9:01] to the rock in the first place. But
[9:04] because Moses had a had a failure, it it
[9:07] created um it really inhibited the the
[9:10] how how fulfilled Moses could be. Now, I
[9:13] say all that to say to say this, and
[9:15] this is kind of I I apologize in
[9:18] advance, and normally I have a lot more
[9:20] I'm a lot more put together. This is one
[9:21] of those situations where I had a
[9:23] thought and then the Lord kind of
[9:25] shifted gears on me as I was walking out
[9:26] the door. So, um if if I if this is a
[9:30] little this next bit is a little bit
[9:32] less organized than I usually am, then I
[9:34] apologize. Um
[9:38] uh
[9:40] I wanted to kind of
[9:43] address something. Um and it's a it's an
[9:46] issue that I think is
[9:48] it's pervasive I think in the message a
[9:50] lot and and I know why it's not I'm not
[9:53] if anybody thinks I'm being critical.
[9:55] I'm not. I I know why this is and I and
[9:57] I I don't begrudge anybody. Um and I'm
[10:01] not trying to be critical and I'm not
[10:02] trying to be controversial. Please,
[10:04] please don't think I'm trying to be some
[10:06] some controversial person. Um, but I
[10:08] think that in the message we do run into
[10:10] a we have a tendency to lean very
[10:13] heavily on the idea that um if we just
[10:17] get the Holy Ghost, that's it.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Just get the Holy Ghost and everything's
[10:23] right there, right? And we it's we have
[10:25] camp meetings and it's just get the Holy
[10:26] Ghost and we have youth camps and we're
[10:28] driving people, you know, young people
[10:29] towards the Holy Ghost. And I don't
[10:30] disagree with that. Please do not think
[10:32] that I am in any way, shape, or form
[10:33] trying to lessen the impact and the
[10:35] importance of getting the Holy Ghost.
[10:37] Um, where I I think that we need to be
[10:40] careful is thinking that that is the
[10:42] beall end all end of the story that you
[10:45] get the Holy Ghost and there's nothing
[10:47] else that happens.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; That will lead you to train wreck.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Um, because what happens so just and
[10:56] I'll and I'll give you the the type
[10:57] here.
[11:00] Um, you know, if you look at at Christ,
[11:03] right, Christ is the wave sheath. We are
[11:05] Christians. We are named after Christ.
[11:06] We pattern our lives after Christ.
[11:09] Christ,
[11:11] you know, Christ's life was that he he
[11:14] he at the beginning of his ministry, he
[11:18] went to the river Jordan, right? He went
[11:20] to he met John at the river Jordan. And
[11:22] what did he do? Jordan represented
[11:24] death, death to self. He went was
[11:26] baptized under John's ministry was a
[11:27] baptism of repentance. So there's
[11:29] justification,
[11:31] &gt;&gt; you know, justification, san uh
[11:33] justification, repentance, and death to
[11:35] self. Then he's baptized in water
[11:36] baptism. There's sanctification and
[11:38] water baptism. And then the Holy Ghost
[11:39] descended upon him in the form of a
[11:40] dove. There's the baptism of the Holy
[11:42] Spirit. Okay? There's your pattern.
[11:44] That's Acts chapter 2 fulfilled in
[11:46] Christ's life.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. And then he has a three and a half
[11:52] year ministry in which he, as Hebrew, I
[11:55] believe is 5:3 says, he learned
[11:56] obedience to the things that he
[11:57] suffered. though he was a son. He was a
[11:59] son but he still had to learn obedience
[12:01] to the things that he suffered. And then
[12:03] at the end of that he goes to Mount
[12:05] Transfiguration in which there's a which
[12:08] is where brother Brandham goes to to
[12:10] teach adoption.
[12:11] Okay. So there was there was a maturing
[12:15] process that had to come between the
[12:17] point at which Christ the Holy Ghost
[12:19] descended upon Christ and the point at
[12:21] which he goes to Mount Transfiguration.
[12:23] Something happened in there. Otherwise
[12:24] why didn't he why did he go to the
[12:26] wilderness? Why did he have to suffer
[12:27] all these things? Why did why was Christ
[12:30] not ready to go to the cross as soon as
[12:32] he left the River Jordan? Why didn't why
[12:34] didn't that happen? Right? Well, no.
[12:36] It's because there's there had because
[12:37] he's laying out the pattern and the type
[12:39] for of us, right? Because that's this
[12:41] because this is how we're going to be.
[12:43] Because when you get to the mount
[12:44] transfiguration, it's called
[12:46] transfiguration because he was what?
[12:47] Transfigured, right? There was a
[12:49] changing of his body on that mountain.
[12:51] there was and and it's important if you
[12:53] go look at the type it's because in the
[12:55] in the adoption ceremony what does the
[12:56] the father do he raises he puts his his
[12:59] son before the elders right Moses and
[13:01] Elijah and then he puts the the father
[13:04] puts his robe on the son right that's
[13:06] Christ's glorified body on the mountain
[13:09] right and and to say this is this person
[13:12] this my son he was always my blood son
[13:15] but now he speaks with my authority he
[13:16] he is the all that I am now poured into
[13:20] this child or you know I guess at that
[13:22] point they're grown men you know by the
[13:24] time they're reaching adoption. My point
[13:25] is there's education and there's
[13:27] training that happens between the Holy
[13:28] Ghost and the body change
[13:30] &gt;&gt; right this does you don't just go
[13:32] overnight you you know you don't get the
[13:34] Holy Ghost and they get beamed on top of
[13:35] the head with everything that you'll
[13:36] ever need to know.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Um you know and and now there's a
[13:40] there's a there's an aspect and a
[13:42] component of that. Um, brother Brandham
[13:44] talks and I don't just say brother
[13:46] Brandham, there's many examples that I
[13:48] know of personally where this happened.
[13:50] Um, where but the example that we we'll
[13:54] all be familiar with is um when brother
[13:56] Brandham's in Africa and you have the
[13:57] the the women the native women there who
[14:00] are in the in the service and they're
[14:01] naked. They don't have any education on
[14:03] on holiness dress and um he just
[14:07] preaches an Acts two Acts 2 sermon. They
[14:10] get the Holy Ghost and immediately the
[14:11] Holy Ghost convicts them to recovering
[14:12] themselves. they start fighting start
[14:14] finding blankets to to wrap up and and
[14:16] and covering themselves to to to become
[14:19] uh uh modest. Um and there was no
[14:22] training on that. They were just they
[14:23] the the the revelation of of holiness
[14:26] dress was revealed to them as soon as
[14:27] they got the Holy Ghost. And that's
[14:30] true. That's wonderful. That happens.
[14:31] And I and I know of other examples in
[14:33] the states where that happened. um uh
[14:35] where girls um come right off the street
[14:37] and you know completely immodest,
[14:39] completely um you know you know just
[14:43] completely immodest go to an altar, get
[14:45] the Holy Ghost and and are immediately
[14:47] trying to you know find a blanket or
[14:48] something to cover up and and they have
[14:50] no training. They complete heathens, no
[14:52] educa, you know, nobody taught them that
[14:54] this this happens.
[14:56] So no one's no one's going to argue that
[14:58] that that can't happen. What? But where
[15:01] we we we run a foul of this is don't
[15:04] forget that brother Brandham preached
[15:07] marriage and divorce to Holy Ghost fil
[15:09] people, right? He preached church order
[15:13] to holy ghostfilled people. You know,
[15:15] you don't
[15:17] Yes, it is true that the Holy Ghost is
[15:18] the tutor. It will teach you these
[15:20] things. It will lead you to into all
[15:22] these this truth, but it's going to do
[15:24] it through the foolishness of a
[15:26] preacher. But it's the Holy Ghost
[15:28] operating through a five-fold ministry.
[15:30] If you if you could just have all the
[15:33] revelation as soon as you got the Holy
[15:35] Ghost, well then why why am I here?
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Right. What am I doing? I I don't I mean
[15:40] I got better stuff to do, you know, than
[15:43] but but but I don't you know I I'm I'm
[15:46] not I'm not
[15:49] you know the Lord has something for me
[15:50] to do. The Lord will operate through me
[15:52] because he y'all have need of stuff and
[15:54] I have need of stuff which is why I sit
[15:55] under under ministry and hear ministers
[15:57] preach.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Everybody we the Lord operates through
[16:01] ministry to teach you.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we have this idea that um
[16:08] I heard it. It's forgive me if if people
[16:10] think I'm trying to tell a joke. I'm
[16:12] not. It's it's a parable but it's kind
[16:13] of funny. Um it's the and I'm sure we've
[16:16] all heard it too but it's the it's
[16:17] that's why it's not that funny. Um, but
[16:20] it's the it's the story of the guy he he
[16:22] gets stranded on the desert island,
[16:23] right? And and he's a Christian. He
[16:25] believes, oh, you know, I'm going to
[16:26] pray and the Lord's going to deliver me
[16:27] from this island. And he prays and he,
[16:29] you know, prays and he sings and has a
[16:32] jubilee right there and know the Lord
[16:34] holds the scripture and and really gets
[16:36] a revelation that the Lord's going to
[16:37] deliver him from that island. He just
[16:38] knows it. And the next day, a a ship
[16:41] sails by and they see him there and they
[16:43] send out a boat for him and the captain
[16:44] comes to meet him on the shore and go,
[16:45] "Oh, captain, thank you for coming to
[16:46] meet me, but I, you know, I appreciate
[16:48] the help, but I don't need it. The
[16:49] Lord's going to deliver me." And the
[16:52] captain sails away. And then the next
[16:53] day, a helicopter flies over and lands.
[16:55] Hey, buddy, get on the No, I don't need
[16:56] it. I don't need no, you know, tree of
[16:58] knowledge, deliverance. I've got a a
[17:00] word from the Lord. The Lord's going to
[17:01] deliver me. Power spoken word.
[17:04] And then the helicopter flies away. And
[17:06] then the man dies on the island. And you
[17:09] know, he he gets to heaven and he asked
[17:10] the Lord, "Lord, I I I thought I had a a
[17:14] revelation you were going to deliver."
[17:15] He goes, "Well, son, I I sent you a boat
[17:16] and a helicopter. What else did you
[17:17] want?"
[17:19] &gt;&gt; You know what? What more could I have
[17:21] done for you? And so, a lot of times
[17:22] people think, "I need deliverance. I
[17:23] need I need the you know, my my family's
[17:26] in shambles. I've got marriage problems.
[17:28] I've got finance problems. I've got
[17:29] children problems. I've got all these
[17:31] problems. Everything's a mess and and
[17:33] broken. And I need the Lord to just
[17:35] power spoken word reveal." Well, the
[17:37] Lord's going to do that over a pullpit,
[17:39] right? The Lord's going to do that if if
[17:42] you will just so go sit under the under
[17:44] the you know, you have it doesn't mean
[17:45] you don't have the Holy Ghost. Doesn't
[17:46] mean that the Lord can't do that in a
[17:48] lot of ways. A lot of times the Lord can
[17:49] miraculously do stuff. But in a lot of
[17:51] times, the Lord's going to need you to
[17:53] reconform your lifestyle to the word so
[17:57] that he can operate.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Think of it like this. And I I have five
[18:02] minutes left, so and and I'm going to
[18:03] get to my text. Um,
[18:07] in the text we read, just briefly, just
[18:10] for the sake of time, I'm not going to
[18:11] reread it. It's Adam and he's alone in
[18:14] the garden and God's going to give him a
[18:16] wife.
[18:18] And then at the end of that, it says,
[18:19] and and for this, it goes tells a story
[18:21] and it's Adam and he's naming the
[18:22] things. And then at the bottom, it says
[18:24] the last verse we read was, and it the
[18:26] Bible says, if I can find it again,
[18:29] where'd it go? Uh well anyways it says
[18:33] um and for this cause a man shall leave
[18:36] his father and mother and cleave unto
[18:37] his wife.
[18:40] That Adam didn't say that line. God
[18:42] didn't say that line to Adam. That's the
[18:44] narrator of the Bible breaking the
[18:46] fourth wall and talking to the audience.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; All right
[18:49] &gt;&gt; and saying hey this story that I just
[18:52] told you here's why I told that to you.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's the narrator talking to you
[18:57] and saying, "Hey, for this cause,
[19:01] young men are to leave their father and
[19:03] mother so they can build their own
[19:05] headship. So they can be like Adam, a
[19:08] individual relationship with God and
[19:10] young man, so that he can build the
[19:13] garden that he will bring his Eve into."
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Okay. This is a foundation. the the the
[19:18] the foundation of the marriage does not
[19:22] a marriage does not start at an altar
[19:25] with a preacher. A marriage starts when
[19:27] a young man gets the Holy Ghost.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; That's where it starts. If you try to
[19:32] start it anywhere else, you're out of
[19:33] the order of God's word. you might or or
[19:35] or you you know you have you have all
[19:38] the right components but you've got them
[19:40] mix matched and now you're going to have
[19:42] a bunch of marriage problems because
[19:43] young man didn't get a a tight strong
[19:46] relationship with God first.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; It was an individual relationship with
[19:50] God and man first and then he can seek a
[19:54] wife and then and he but he has to leave
[19:56] his father and mother. You try to have a
[19:59] young man who never leaves the headship
[20:00] of his dad, who's always a mama's boy,
[20:03] who's who he he can never go out on his
[20:06] own and lead his own household, just
[20:08] him. How is he supposed to lead lead a
[20:10] family? How is he supposed to lead a
[20:12] wife? He can't lead himself, right? He
[20:14] has no revelation. He can't keep himself
[20:17] in church on his own. And how many times
[20:21] and and and I know like and it's a it's
[20:22] a it's a common thing but but and I I I
[20:26] have I man I could preach on that for a
[20:27] long time but I got three minutes so I'm
[20:29] not gonna um the the the issue is that's
[20:33] the actual pattern of the word and it's
[20:35] the foundation of the of of a marriage.
[20:38] It's the foundation of a household is
[20:41] the man's relationship with God and is
[20:44] he in line with the word? Is he
[20:45] following the pattern and the type that
[20:48] God laid out? because if he's not, then
[20:49] you're going to end up with something
[20:50] else. You're going to be like Moses.
[20:51] You're going to be somewhere else. And
[20:52] what happens is we have this thing of,
[20:55] well, just get the Holy Ghost.
[20:58] And it's like, well, okay, we're going
[20:59] to build a house. And your job is to
[21:01] build a house. Your job is to build a
[21:02] household, but just, hey, just get the
[21:04] spirit of the builder. You don't need to
[21:05] learn how to read blueprints. You don't
[21:07] need to learn how any of the tools work.
[21:09] You don't need to know how to, you know,
[21:10] order lumber. You don't need any of
[21:12] that. Just get the spirit of the
[21:13] builder. Okay. Well, you got the spirit
[21:15] of the builder and you can try and
[21:17] you'll build a structure. you'll build
[21:18] something. It's going to be crooked. The
[21:20] the foundation's going to be offkilter
[21:23] because you didn't you don't know how to
[21:24] read the blueprints,
[21:25] &gt;&gt; right? No one instructed you on how to
[21:27] read the blueprints. And so, you built
[21:29] something, but you didn't build but none
[21:31] of the doors open and close correctly.
[21:32] None of the windows close because the
[21:34] house is all tilted over and they don't
[21:36] slide. And it's cuz the foundation's
[21:38] completely off level. And the the issue
[21:40] was that the relationship the foundation
[21:42] was the man's relationship with God. And
[21:44] it wasn't right to begin with. And so
[21:46] now the whole house is shifted over. And
[21:48] so what we want, what we want is we have
[21:51] a a a dysfunctional home and the dad is
[21:54] coming in there going to family camp. He
[21:56] gets fired up. Lord, you can deliver my
[21:57] family's spoken word. And what he's not
[22:00] recognizing is that his relationship,
[22:02] which is the foundation on which
[22:03] everything else is built, is out of
[22:04] kilter. And what he wants is for the the
[22:07] the,
[22:09] you know, divine power to come in there
[22:11] and square the children back up so all
[22:13] the doors open and close,
[22:14] &gt;&gt; right? wants to square the wife up
[22:16] because you can take a you take a
[22:18] crooked house and and if the foundation
[22:20] is crooked and then all the walls are
[22:21] crooked and obviously the doors don't
[22:22] open and close. But you can take them
[22:24] and if you get a big enough shim and a
[22:26] big enough lag bolt and a comealong, you
[22:28] can crank that door jam over to the
[22:30] point where it will open and close
[22:32] because you've rescared it to the
[22:33] foundation. But the problem is the
[22:35] foundation is wrong,
[22:36] &gt;&gt; right? M
[22:37] &gt;&gt; so God can't come in and resquare your
[22:40] home because to you because you're not
[22:43] squared to the word. And for God to
[22:45] square the home to you and you're not
[22:47] square to the word which means now he's
[22:49] squaring the family to something that's
[22:51] not his word and he can't do that.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; That's why it can't you know it's not
[22:56] going to doesn't always happen overnight
[22:58] and instantaneously. Sometimes it takes
[23:00] years of blood, sweat, and tears and a
[23:02] lot of praying and agonizing and
[23:04] difficult conversations and really hard
[23:07] trials to resquare the family because
[23:09] it's going to take dad getting himself
[23:12] put back together and himself put back
[23:14] under the subject of the word and then
[23:17] the family can can come into subject
[23:19] that God can't square a family to a a
[23:22] crooked foundation
[23:24] &gt;&gt; because it will the the ultimately the
[23:26] the whole house will still be crooked.
[23:28] It's just you won't notice it as much.
[23:29] It'll be more functionally wrong.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; It'll be wrong, but just a little more
[23:34] functional. You know, you can take a
[23:37] transmission and pack sawdust in the
[23:39] transmission and it won't rattle so bad,
[23:42] &gt;&gt; right? The transmission's shot. Don't
[23:44] get me wrong. It's going to blow up on
[23:45] the highway, but you don't hear the
[23:47] rattling.
[23:50] You didn't fix anything, right? And so,
[23:52] God's not going to do that. God's not
[23:54] going to
[23:56] make a family more he's not gonna he's
[23:59] not going to just just paper over all
[24:02] the all the holes in the walls
[24:05] be you know until until the the found we
[24:08] have to go back to the basics and and
[24:09] say look the the foundation is dad get
[24:13] the dad right make sure dad's in line
[24:15] with the word because he's the head of
[24:17] the household everyone's going to follow
[24:18] the head and when dad is right then he
[24:20] can go to mom and you can build you can
[24:23] fix the marriage marriage and God's not
[24:25] going to fix the children till you fix
[24:26] the marriage because the pattern is de
[24:28] husband then wife then children
[24:31] &gt;&gt; right
[24:32] &gt;&gt; not in any other order than that right
[24:35] &gt;&gt; and if if you want to fix the marriage
[24:37] then you have to start in that order
[24:39] &gt;&gt; right you start with dad then you fix
[24:41] the marriage between uh mom and dad and
[24:44] then you fix the relationship between
[24:45] parents and children if you try to fix
[24:47] the relationship between parents and
[24:48] children while the marriage is
[24:50] effectively broken and dysfunctional And
[24:53] there's a there's no no unity between
[24:56] mom and dad and you're trying to fix the
[24:57] the relationship with the kids, then
[24:58] you're trying to
[25:01] you're you're trying to raise kids in a
[25:02] broken home.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; You're trying to raise ch it is a it is
[25:06] it is a divorced. It is a it is a out of
[25:08] wedlock in name only or you're only
[25:11] married in name only, right? You're
[25:12] effectively trying to raise children out
[25:13] of wedlock because the marriage the love
[25:16] and the unity and the cherishing that
[25:18] bound the marriage to begin with is
[25:20] gone. Yeah.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; And so now you you're married sort of.
[25:25] There's no actual marriage there.
[25:26] There's no love in it. And you fix that
[25:30] first before you try to fix the
[25:31] relationship with your kids.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; So anyways, I'm going to quit before I
[25:36] get myself into the preachers time. So
[25:41] let's uh let's pray. Amen.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we come before you this
[25:48] morning
[25:50] praying that something that this foolish
[25:52] foolish man might have said that would
[25:54] have been anointed by you that Lord that
[25:57] someone could have taken something that
[25:58] was said and
[26:00] held on to it and and applied it and
[26:04] maybe be encouraged to draw closer to
[26:06] you and to your word.
[26:08] there could be there could be a a rising
[26:10] higher, Lord, that the things of this
[26:13] world that would cling to us, that they
[26:14] would all fall away as we would rise
[26:16] higher and draw closer to you. We ask
[26:18] these things in the name of the Lord
[26:20] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you guys.
