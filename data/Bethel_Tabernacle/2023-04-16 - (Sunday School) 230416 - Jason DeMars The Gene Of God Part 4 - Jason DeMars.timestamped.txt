[5:27] of God this is part four Let's uh
[5:31] approach the Lord in prayer father we
[5:33] come to you Lord and we're asking that
[5:35] your Holy Spirit would come and be
[5:37] amongst us Lord take your word and break
[5:39] open the words of Life To Us father we
[5:42] want to commit this time and commit
[5:44] ourselves unto you Lord be glorified
[5:47] amongst us we ask in Jesus name amen
[5:50] amen
[5:51] brother Mark if you want to go to the
[5:53] next screen I'm going to grab the
[5:54] flicker here
[5:56] get that going in a second
[6:01] Genesis 3 14 and 15.
[6:06] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[6:08] because thou has done this Thou Art
[6:09] cursed above all cattle
[6:11] and above every beast of the field upon
[6:14] thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt
[6:16] thou eat all the days of thy life and I
[6:19] will put enmity between thee and the
[6:21] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[6:23] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[6:26] bruise his heel may the Lord add the
[6:27] blessing to the reading of his word you
[6:29] can be seated
[6:34] we found
[6:35] in our Study last week
[6:38] and our PowerPoint vanished
[6:41] so we no problem
[6:44] so we found in our Study last week we
[6:45] looked at that and saw the woman has a
[6:48] seed
[6:49] and the serpent has a seed and then we
[6:52] ran that forward to the New Testament to
[6:54] look at the Fulfillment of that
[6:56] Jesus didn't have trouble with lizards
[6:59] or snakes or orangutans or
[7:06] monkeys or gorillas that wasn't who
[7:09] crucified him
[7:10] it was a Generation of Vipers that was
[7:13] spoken about but that they were people
[7:16] they were human beings that were
[7:19] of their father the devil Jesus said
[7:21] children children of the devil
[7:24] and and he go we we looked at that in
[7:27] John 8.
[7:29] and we'll talk we'll review that in just
[7:31] a second
[7:32] um we also looked in second Corinthians
[7:34] 11. I'm not going to read it again but
[7:37] we saw that the church was engaged as a
[7:39] virgin to Christ
[7:41] and Paul likened that unto Eve being
[7:44] engaged as a virgin to Adam
[7:47] and then Paul's concern or his fear was
[7:51] that the church would commit adultery
[7:55] by accepting a false word
[7:58] then he then he relates that back to the
[8:01] original sin
[8:04] so if Paul fears the church committing
[8:06] adultery and it Compares it to Eve's sin
[8:08] that we can conclude by the scripture
[8:10] that Eve committed adultery with the
[8:13] serpent
[8:15] that's what second Corinthians 11 is
[8:16] clearly speaking about
[8:18] people will get you caught up and say
[8:21] well beguiled doesn't mean sex sure it
[8:23] doesn't it means deceived but the whole
[8:25] context means sex very clearly
[8:30] the there we don't you don't need to
[8:32] come to a fanciful interpretation the
[8:34] scripture says exactly what it means
[8:39] if if Paul was concerned about the
[8:42] church committing adultery he Compares
[8:43] it to Eve's sin what was Eve's sin
[8:45] eating apples
[8:48] it can't be it's very clear adultery was
[8:52] the original sin
[8:55] Matthew 13 37-39
[8:58] . he answered and said unto them he that
[9:00] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[9:02] the field is the world the good seed or
[9:05] the children of the Kingdom but the
[9:07] tares are the children of the wicked one
[9:10] the enemy that sowed them as the devil
[9:12] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[9:14] the reapers are
[9:16] the Angels so the question in my mind I
[9:18] have is are we to just
[9:21] take that scripture
[9:23] take this as something spiritual like
[9:26] the works that you produce
[9:29] means that you're of the devil if you do
[9:31] good works so we can choose what we want
[9:34] to do I think this is the world the
[9:36] world view and the understanding of so
[9:38] many um
[9:39] people in Christianity Today you get to
[9:42] choose if you're going to be a children
[9:44] of the child of the devil or a child of
[9:47] God it's your choice it's up to you you
[9:49] can you can make your decision to be
[9:51] which one of these well that's not
[9:53] scripture
[9:55] there's there's genetics behind this
[9:57] there's election behind this there's a
[10:00] there's a stream of life and I think
[10:01] that's the thing that's so lost
[10:04] and misunderstood in Christianity is
[10:07] that God you know you look at let me
[10:10] back up a second you look at how the
[10:14] average Christian looks at a human
[10:16] and the Body Soul and Spirit they have
[10:18] no
[10:19] understanding whatsoever of genetics
[10:24] or or the origin of man or what God's
[10:27] purpose is for man they look and see man
[10:31] is made in the image and likeness of God
[10:32] that just means he's intelligent
[10:35] okay so where did where do we draw the
[10:37] line because dolphins are intelligent
[10:39] other animals are intelligent
[10:42] so does that mean they share some of the
[10:44] image of God obviously not when you look
[10:47] at image and likeness it means that this
[10:49] is going to be an expression of the
[10:52] character and nature of who God is in
[10:55] other words this is a man this is a
[10:56] visible manifestation of the invisible
[10:59] God God is invisible he wants to make
[11:01] himself visible
[11:03] right and I'm I'm skipping way ahead of
[11:06] myself we'll get we'll get we'll lay the
[11:07] scriptures in later but God breathed the
[11:10] spirit of Life the Breath of Life
[11:13] literally the spirit of lives
[11:15] into Adam so the the the the the the the
[11:18] the god race
[11:21] that God was purposing to bring forth
[11:23] through Adam oh people are going to hate
[11:26] that terminology
[11:28] say that's not biblical it absolutely is
[11:31] biblical
[11:32] in if you saw my podcast I spoke about
[11:34] it uh on on Friday
[11:38] but there in uh II Peter he says we're
[11:42] made partakers of the divine nature
[11:45] having an escape the corruption that is
[11:47] in the world through lust we're made
[11:50] we're we're literally participants of
[11:53] the Divine species that word nature it
[11:57] means species or genus so we are the god
[12:01] race the god species so God in other
[12:04] words we're not God we're not we're not
[12:06] omnipotent omnipresent omniscient but
[12:09] when our faith makes connection with God
[12:12] we become that right
[12:15] but nevertheless we're not objects of
[12:17] worship
[12:18] brother Brandon says we don't forgive
[12:20] sins but that life was to come into
[12:25] Humanity come into flesh and put God
[12:29] himself on display right
[12:32] so this is what's missing in
[12:34] Christianity they have no understanding
[12:35] of that they just think we're humans God
[12:37] created us we're his creatures and he
[12:40] adopts us and puts us in a position of
[12:43] being his sons no they missed that
[12:45] there's a whole
[12:46] stream of Life coming from Adam and of
[12:50] course we understand that's what serpent
[12:52] seat shows us there's a hybridization of
[12:54] that life there's an injection of this
[12:58] is my next scripture I'll get to it
[13:00] right now Ecclesiastes 3
[13:03] 18-21 of course we understand when we're
[13:05] looking at Ecclesiastes Solomon is
[13:08] writing about things on the earth and
[13:10] then these things writing on the things
[13:12] under heaven
[13:13] in other words from God's perspective
[13:15] and from Human perspective this
[13:17] scripture he's looking at it both
[13:19] directions he's starting out on the
[13:22] human perspective without God in the
[13:24] picture that's why he says vanity is
[13:26] Vanity all is Vanity
[13:29] that's true without God but with God
[13:32] it's not vanity
[13:35] so Ecclesiastes 3 18-21 I said in my
[13:37] heart concerning the estate of the sons
[13:40] of men sons of Adam
[13:42] that God might manifest them and that
[13:45] they might see that they themselves are
[13:47] beasts they're animals hmm
[13:50] for that which befalleth the sons of
[13:52] Adam befall befall as beasts or animals
[13:55] even one thing befalleth them as one
[13:57] dieth so die at the other yea they have
[14:00] all one breath so that a man hath no
[14:02] preeminence above a beast for all his
[14:04] vanity all go unto one place
[14:07] interesting all are of the dust and all
[14:10] turn to dust again again this is human
[14:12] perspective
[14:13] this is from the perspective of those on
[14:16] the earth looking at what's happening
[14:19] the animal dies so does a human being
[14:21] what does he what is he any better than
[14:23] him
[14:24] all go under the same place what place
[14:27] he's not talking about the afterlife all
[14:29] go back to dust they go big buried in
[14:32] the ground
[14:33] but then he goes further who knoweth the
[14:35] spirit of man that goeth upward in the
[14:37] spirit of the Beast the spirit of the
[14:39] animal that goes downward to the Earth
[14:41] so we have two directions the spirit of
[14:44] at the Spirit of Adam the spirit of the
[14:47] sons of Adam is supposed to go up right
[14:51] the spirit of the animals it says it
[14:52] goes downwards well how do we how do we
[14:55] get this picture how do we understand
[14:58] that we we understand that animals
[15:01] were were to be immortal when God
[15:04] created them were animals supposed to
[15:05] die
[15:08] they weren't supposed to die neither
[15:09] were we it was supposed to continue in
[15:12] life now
[15:14] animals die why because they're under
[15:17] the curse that got put upon Adam got put
[15:20] on the head of humanity
[15:23] it's Romans 8 20 and 21 for the creature
[15:26] or the creation was made subject to
[15:28] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[15:31] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[15:33] because the creature itself also shall
[15:36] be delivered from the bondage of
[15:37] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[15:40] the children of God so there's coming a
[15:42] time where the animals will be immortal
[15:45] right they won't die
[15:47] and you can talk about that if you know
[15:50] your beloved pet is going to be
[15:53] resurrected I believe that's certainly a
[15:56] possibility we'll we'll see our you'll
[15:58] see your pets again in the on the new
[16:00] Earth
[16:00] and different things and there's animals
[16:03] and horses and different things will God
[16:05] create them from the dust to the ground
[16:07] to have a Immortal species of animals or
[16:10] will he re you know bring bring our
[16:12] horses and our beloved animals maybe
[16:13] he'll do all of that
[16:15] on the new Earth but we know that
[16:17] they're going to they're going to be
[16:18] delivered from the bondage
[16:20] of corruption
[16:22] like we on the inside have been
[16:24] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[16:26] but not on the outside
[16:29] when we when on the outside we are
[16:32] delivered from the bond of of corruption
[16:34] that follows suit that the animal
[16:36] kingdom all of creation is going to be
[16:38] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[16:40] we're just waiting for the adoption to
[16:43] wit the Redemption of our bodies when
[16:46] that comes all creation that they're
[16:48] groaning the groaning will be over with
[16:51] and so we thank the Lord for that
[16:54] but then we we understand in all of this
[16:57] that the animals they die now
[17:00] and we die
[17:03] all of us are subject to death because
[17:05] of Adam's sin now e Eve injected that
[17:11] other life into the human race
[17:13] let me just go forward in this I'm
[17:15] trying to explain everything and I'm
[17:16] jumping so far ahead of myself
[17:19] prior to the fall both animals and the
[17:21] human race were immortal
[17:22] after the sons of God lineage maintained
[17:25] spiritual and immortality and eternal
[17:29] life their bodies were subject to death
[17:30] but on the inside they could never die
[17:32] because that's God's life
[17:34] in the in the genes of the Soul
[17:37] so animals do not have spiritual
[17:39] immortality
[17:41] the breath or Spirit of animals goes
[17:43] down
[17:44] the breath or Spirit of the sons of Adam
[17:46] goes up
[17:48] but there was an animal life from the
[17:51] serpent injected into the human race
[17:59] John 6 53 then Jesus said unto them
[18:02] verily verily I say unto you except you
[18:05] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[18:07] drink his blood you have no life in you
[18:11] so there's a life in you
[18:13] that's going to cause you to eat the
[18:16] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[18:18] blood there's a life in you that's going
[18:21] to cause you to Feast on the word
[18:24] right that life is there
[18:27] it's in there by predestination
[18:32] why do we got to click this thing 17
[18:33] times to go to the next screen brother
[18:35] Jason
[18:36] I don't know what's going on with that
[18:38] First John 3 15 whosoever hates his
[18:41] brother is a murderer and you know that
[18:45] no murderer has eternal life abiding in
[18:48] him
[18:50] interesting
[18:51] you know the grace of God can overcome
[18:53] even this because David was a murderer
[18:58] but if you if you're a murderer and you
[19:00] stay as a murderer
[19:01] and
[19:03] there's no eternal life abiding in you
[19:05] so in other words you see the other
[19:07] scripture I had there's life there
[19:10] that causes you to Feast on the body
[19:13] word of the son of man
[19:15] here there's no life in you you don't
[19:19] have eternal life
[19:21] and when you don't have eternal life
[19:22] you're going to produce the works of not
[19:24] having eternal life
[19:28] see the serpent has no life in it they
[19:30] cannot hear the word it's a hybrid life
[19:32] it can't reproduce
[19:34] eternal life it's hybrid it's dead they
[19:37] cannot hear the word because there's no
[19:39] place for the word in them
[19:42] they can't suffer eternally in hell that
[19:45] was part of our previous subjects
[19:47] because they don't have eternal life
[19:48] they're not Immortal they continue to
[19:51] exist after death
[19:53] due to their hybrid condition with Eve
[19:55] remember Eve's life was injected there
[19:58] which was part of God's own life
[20:01] thank you
[20:03] First Timothy 6 16.
[20:06] who only hath immortality again some of
[20:09] the fundamentals we're starting with God
[20:12] Alone is immortal
[20:14] no one else is immortal
[20:16] but God himself passes his life on
[20:19] through the son to us
[20:23] as the father has life in himself he's
[20:26] given to the son that logos that went
[20:28] out of God the life that was in that
[20:30] logos you were in that you're a part of
[20:33] that life
[20:34] that life is the son you are in the sun
[20:38] therefore you have life
[20:41] it's not as though you found yourself in
[20:43] the sun now because of the choice you
[20:45] made the choices you made through life
[20:47] as I said at the beginning many of the
[20:49] denominational World they think you can
[20:51] choose to be a child of the devil or you
[20:53] could choose to be a child of God you
[20:55] cannot it's the the life that's in You
[20:58] by election
[20:59] if you were in Christ you were in him
[21:01] before the foundation of the world you
[21:03] were in him when he died before the
[21:06] foundation of the world your name was
[21:07] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[21:09] the foundation of the world so God
[21:11] watched over that seed in the human race
[21:14] I'm never going to get to this quote
[21:16] probably
[21:17] next time or the time after that but
[21:19] brother Brandon says the Virgin birth
[21:21] isn't half as mysterious
[21:24] as the natural birth and he begins to
[21:27] describe how that Gene of eternal life
[21:30] is passed on in through the human race
[21:32] and it's born in this one and that one
[21:34] same family you got a Jacob and you
[21:35] gotta Issa one can't value the
[21:38] birthright one his whole life is the
[21:40] birthright
[21:41] and that's you maybe your own family you
[21:44] see that one they have no value the
[21:46] birthright has no value the word has no
[21:49] value another one it's your whole life
[21:52] what is it it's God's predestination
[21:57] he that hath the son hath life first
[21:59] John 5 12 and he'd hath that hath not
[22:01] the Son of God hath not life how do you
[22:04] get the Sun
[22:05] you believe in his name how do you
[22:07] believe in his name as many as ordained
[22:09] or eternal life believe you can't run
[22:11] away from predestination I'm sorry
[22:13] you might want to try to run away from
[22:15] it but you're not going to get away from
[22:17] it when you see this process as I said
[22:19] before the Christian world has no idea
[22:22] about the gene of life that's coming in
[22:26] through
[22:27] Adam and to the rest of the human race
[22:29] they have no of course they have no idea
[22:31] about serpent seed so they don't see how
[22:33] it's hybrid and why we need to be born
[22:35] again they just think why we just need
[22:37] to be born again we it needs to be blood
[22:39] why does it need to be blood God isn't
[22:40] randomly choosing this
[22:42] it has to be blood because the bloodline
[22:44] was perverted
[22:46] it has to be a new birth because your
[22:48] first birth was hybrid
[22:50] all of us are carrying within us why do
[22:52] you sin you have the serpent traits
[22:55] within you you have a hybrid life in
[22:57] your flesh that was passed on to the
[22:59] whole human race through Adam and and uh
[23:02] Adam through Noah and his wife and and
[23:07] his hamsham and japheth and their wives
[23:09] all the whole human race is infected
[23:12] with that sin right there is a perfect
[23:14] example of the election right and at
[23:17] right in Noah's family one of them
[23:22] terrible sinner another one
[23:25] righteous loves God
[23:29] Genesis 1 26-27
[23:32] let us make man in our image after our
[23:34] likeness let them have dominion so
[23:37] here's God's purpose he makes man
[23:39] In His Image to be a vice Regent
[23:44] to be his ruler upon the Earth God was
[23:48] going to rule just as Pharaoh Pharaoh
[23:52] just relaxed when he had Joseph right
[23:55] Pharaoh had had duties and things of
[23:58] state but really
[24:00] Joseph did most of the work
[24:02] and that's that's where he wants us he
[24:05] wants us in this position of taking
[24:07] Dominion God God has his his duty and
[24:11] his purpose but he's doing it through
[24:13] you
[24:14] he's operating through you and that's
[24:16] this is what God is doing he puts a part
[24:18] of his life in a body of Flesh and says
[24:21] multiply multiply what that same life
[24:25] what did Satan attack man with
[24:29] how he would fill his belly
[24:32] whether he would have too much pizza
[24:37] whether he would eat an apple well you
[24:39] can eat this one what was the Tree of
[24:41] Life
[24:42] maybe it was raspberries or blueberries
[24:44] I'm not sure
[24:47] and in the tree of knowledge of Good and
[24:49] Evil is it either an apricot or
[24:53] and Apple so God says multiply and
[24:55] replenish the Earth and Satan attacks
[24:57] them about the food kind of food that
[24:59] they eat
[25:01] restrict your diet
[25:03] that's what the gospel is Right restrict
[25:05] your diet
[25:08] spiritually speaking yes and again
[25:10] spiritually speaking yes at the
[25:13] beginning
[25:14] right it's it it's speaking of the
[25:17] direct attack against God's purpose and
[25:20] plan which is multiplying and filling up
[25:23] the Earth so instead of doing it God's
[25:25] way
[25:26] they pervert Satan perverted it and
[25:29] twisted it and did it
[25:31] his way and by that injected a foreign
[25:35] substance into the genetics of God
[25:42] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[25:44] of the ground and breathed into his
[25:45] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[25:49] became a living Soul it's very
[25:51] interesting to me if you look at the
[25:53] Hebrew it literally means the breath of
[25:55] lives or the spirit of lives in other
[25:59] words God put into Adam all the lives
[26:03] that were to come for forth after that
[26:05] Adam was the head of the human race so
[26:07] when he sinned we sinned in him and that
[26:10] was death was passed upon all of us
[26:13] then God replaced Adam thank the Lord
[26:17] with Christ
[26:18] the second man first man is of the earth
[26:21] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[26:24] Heaven
[26:25] the second man comes and his his
[26:28] life is perfect
[26:31] sinless he sheds that perfect blood not
[26:35] it's not a hybrid blood
[26:37] but it's the very blood of God the very
[26:39] Divine Life of God in the form of a man
[26:42] his very blood was shed for you it had
[26:46] to be that perfect blood because your
[26:47] blood was perverted your blood was
[26:50] hybrid so that perfect life the life is
[26:53] in the blood that perfect life
[26:56] sheds a perfect blood so that you could
[26:59] receive his life back on you and be
[27:02] changed and have the right kind of birth
[27:04] to have but so in other words the breath
[27:06] of lives this was to bring forth all the
[27:09] children of God through Adam Adam fell
[27:13] by sin by hybrid by hybriding Adam
[27:16] didn't hybrid Eve did that was injected
[27:19] to the human race now Christ has to come
[27:21] to take those lives that were in Adam
[27:24] and redeem those lives you are in Christ
[27:26] at Calvary
[27:27] you were in Christ when he raised up
[27:30] right
[27:32] in Blasphemous names brother Branham
[27:34] says but God especially upon Adam
[27:37] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[27:40] he become an eternal person with God
[27:44] that's incredible think about that we
[27:46] understand this the very life that was
[27:49] in Adam was in God from the ver from
[27:52] from for all eternity God doesn't have
[27:54] new thoughts we've studied this before
[27:56] God doesn't God isn't adding to his
[27:58] thoughts he's not coming to New
[28:00] conclusions when he chose you he chose
[28:03] you for all eternity and your life is a
[28:06] part of his life so what is this being
[28:08] said God put into Adam
[28:12] that portion of life that was in God for
[28:15] all eternity it was in his soul
[28:19] it was in his soul when you're born on
[28:21] this Earth we talked about it last time
[28:23] because you are Sons God sent forth the
[28:26] spirit of his son into your heart
[28:28] whereby you cry Abba Father
[28:31] you're when you're born on this Earth
[28:33] that Gene of God is there in your soul
[28:37] and brother Branham talks about this
[28:39] multiple different occasions the gene of
[28:41] God doesn't come to you when you're born
[28:42] again
[28:44] the seed of God doesn't come to you when
[28:46] you're born again it's there it's laying
[28:48] in there and that's why President says
[28:50] you couldn't fit in you never could
[28:52] figure out how to do like the rest of
[28:54] the world sure you did many of the
[28:56] things like the rest of the world but
[28:58] yet some something there was hungering
[29:00] something there was thirsting
[29:02] it says down in there there's this
[29:04] little speck of eternal life
[29:06] he said there's another William Branham
[29:09] right waiting to be birthed into in into
[29:12] not into existence but into
[29:15] manifestation
[29:16] amen
[29:22] yes we got to that First Corinthians 15
[29:24] 22 as as an atom all die even so in
[29:27] Christ shall all be made alive
[29:30] so we look at this
[29:32] this is some review
[29:34] so the word Genesis is the Greek
[29:38] translation of the word beginning in the
[29:40] beginning
[29:41] uh then we look to the New Testament we
[29:44] have a carryover the word only begotten
[29:47] for the only begotten son that's
[29:49] monogeneo the unique one of a kind
[29:53] begotten
[29:54] so our term Gene has the same origin
[29:57] Gene is a unit of heredity which is
[29:59] transferred from a parent to offspring
[30:01] and is held to determine some
[30:04] characteristic of The Offspring
[30:06] so when you look at when you open your
[30:08] Bible and see Genesis you know what you
[30:11] should think this is the history of the
[30:14] genes
[30:15] this is the history of God's genes
[30:17] coming into manifestation
[30:23] Gene speaks of origin in connection with
[30:26] characteristics it's the same idea
[30:28] behind the word attribute brother bear
[30:30] says you're you were an attribute of God
[30:32] in other words some characteristic of
[30:36] God
[30:37] needed to be expressed and that's you
[30:40] our nature and our characteristics come
[30:44] from our origin
[30:46] right so your Gene that's laying in you
[30:49] from the time you're born that God saw
[30:51] before the foundation of the world that
[30:52] is the real you that has to come to
[30:55] manifestation but it's covered over by
[30:57] another nature that it's that's born all
[31:00] around it it's it's another nature in
[31:02] the soul right and that nature has to
[31:04] die at the new birth that nature dies
[31:07] right
[31:10] and yet at the same time we know in our
[31:12] flesh we continue
[31:14] we continue to have to grow let's put it
[31:16] on the positive side we have a lot of
[31:18] problems and God is good when we're born
[31:20] again God is going to bake those out of
[31:23] us but the life there the life origin
[31:26] there is solved but now that life has to
[31:30] permeate the rest of your life
[31:33] and one one day it will completely when
[31:35] our bodies are changed
[31:38] so if you're here right now you're still
[31:40] in this life you can you can guarantee
[31:43] that God has a purpose for you and he
[31:46] has a plan for you and he's transforming
[31:48] you by the renewing of your mind you're
[31:50] adding word on top of word revelation on
[31:52] top of Revelation
[31:55] I'm just going to close with this
[31:57] because if I keep going that it'll be in
[31:58] the middle of something that doesn't
[32:00] make any sense so I'm going to close
[32:02] with this
[32:03] could I just say this to you if you are
[32:07] wondering
[32:08] how can I grow
[32:10] how can I grow into the life
[32:13] that God wants me to have is
[32:16] are you what are you feeding on
[32:19] what is your passion do you have a
[32:21] passion to listen to the message
[32:24] do you have a passion to read the Bible
[32:26] and then okay you have a passion are you
[32:28] actually doing it
[32:30] because that's that's the problem and
[32:32] that's the problem I face is when you
[32:34] get when you get cold about your desire
[32:36] to listen to the message and just read
[32:40] the Bible that's just you stop growing
[32:43] you don't lose your salvation but you
[32:45] stop growing so one thing I I'm
[32:48] suggesting for you to pray for if you
[32:50] want to grow into this life
[32:52] is ask God to restore your or give you
[32:56] if you've never had it before give you a
[32:58] passion to feed
[33:00] on this word
[33:02] and a burning desire to have a greater
[33:05] understanding and revelation of the
[33:07] message understand it's not an
[33:09] understanding like the world gains an
[33:11] understanding but it's a spiritual
[33:13] revelation God by his holy spirit as
[33:15] you're feeding on the word will drop
[33:17] that into your heart but there's a means
[33:19] of doing that you can't just go out into
[33:22] nature like a Buddhist and sit there and
[33:25] fold your knees and lay there quietly
[33:27] and wait for thoughts to pop into your
[33:29] head that's not how it works certainly
[33:32] there's prayer and we seek the Lord
[33:34] that's but that's not how God has
[33:35] ordained that we be transformed he says
[33:38] you're going to be transformed into the
[33:40] image of Christ by the renewing of your
[33:43] mind so it takes the word that's why God
[33:46] I mean why do we have such so much of
[33:49] the message today 1200 sermons of
[33:52] brother Branham because we're living in
[33:53] the most deceitful age that's
[33:55] continually
[33:57] putting
[33:59] things before you
[34:01] non-stop notifications non-stop
[34:04] information and God has given us
[34:07] non-stop revelation
[34:09] in the form of brother random's message
[34:12] and so we have to reverse what we're
[34:15] spending our time listening to and
[34:17] feeding on so I'm just encouraging you
[34:19] feed on the message
[34:22] and if you say I have no desire for that
[34:24] that's a good make your confession to
[34:27] the Lord I don't desire that forgive me
[34:29] Lord and change my desire change how I
[34:32] spend my time change what I'm feeding on
[34:34] Amen let's stand and we'll pray
[34:42] Heavenly Father we thank you so much for
[34:44] the revelation of this word Lord and to
[34:47] see
[34:48] the gene of God that's there in our soul
[34:52] and how Lord we're
[34:54] coming into the full growth
[34:58] in expression of what you had in mind
[35:01] before the foundation of the world
[35:03] lord it's as good as done
