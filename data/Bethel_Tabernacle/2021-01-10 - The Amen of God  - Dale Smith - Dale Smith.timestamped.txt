[7:23] amen revelations 3 and verse 14.
[7:29] it says unto the angel the church of the
[7:31] laodiceans write
[7:33] these things saith the amen
[7:37] the faithful and the true
[7:40] witness the beginning of the creation
[7:45] of god let's pray father we thank you
[7:47] lord today
[7:49] that we can be gathered lord is a sunday

[8:04] lord that their hearts will be
[8:05] encouraged and or that we
[8:07] as your children will be edified lord by
[8:10] the teaching
[8:12] of the word of god and we thank you for
[8:14] it in jesus name
[8:15] amen god bless you have your seats
[8:19] um
[8:24] we could we could spend a lot of time
[8:27] on uh many parts of this one verse of
[8:31] scripture
[8:32] uh namely the last part of it uh the
[8:35] beginning of the creation of god
[8:38] no doubt but jason has uh exhaustively
[8:41] spoke on that and uh i personally
[8:46] uh uh
[8:49] have much to say about that myself but
[8:52] today i want to just
[8:54] focus on one four-letter word
[8:57] called amen and
[9:01] the word amen is a when we take it from
[9:04] the
[9:06] perspective of the of what the prophet
[9:09] of god had to say about it
[9:10] it begins to be amplified
[9:14] uh in our ears the simple
[9:18] definition of the word when we
[9:22] start to break it down is
[9:26] it's very basic but when we start
[9:29] getting into some of the things that the
[9:30] prophet of god said about it
[9:32] then it begins to take on some some very
[9:36] potent uh meaning to us
[9:39] so do i have uh control
[9:42] of this up here okay and then
[9:46] i have to figure out the gadgets here
[9:52] i don't know
[9:55] the single button on one side
[9:59] the up down it's already on
[10:06] it's broke
[10:10] oh did somebody help me
[10:13] oh i can do it all by myself if somebody
[10:15] helps me
[10:18] amen so uh revelations 1
[10:21] and 8 here
[10:26] oh okay good deal says
[10:31] i am the alpha and the
[10:34] omega now this is important when we're
[10:37] looking at
[10:38] the word amen because he has designated
[10:40] himself
[10:41] as the amen so when he
[10:44] uses this language here i am alpha
[10:47] that's the
[10:48] the the beginning the the a the greek
[10:51] alphabet and omega being the z
[10:53] of the greek alphabet the beginning and
[10:56] the ending
[10:57] so we understand that but we're gonna
[10:59] we're gonna come to something
[11:00] momentarily
[11:01] that uh you may not have ever realized
[11:05] it kind of goes uh kind of just gets
[11:08] caught in the narrative
[11:09] he says uh which is and which was
[11:14] and which is to come the almighty
[11:18] now he says
[11:21] uh going going on here in the book of
[11:24] revelation i want to just touch a couple
[11:25] of these
[11:26] just to clench the nail here he says
[11:28] when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[11:30] dead
[11:30] and he laid his right hand upon me
[11:32] saying unto me fear not
[11:35] i am the a and the z the first
[11:38] and the last and so
[11:42] the the word amen
[11:46] is from this is from
[11:50] the greek lexicon is a most remarkable
[11:54] word it is translated
[11:57] transliterated directly from the hebrew
[12:00] into the greek new testament
[12:03] and then into the latin and into english
[12:06] and many other
[12:08] languages so that it is practically a
[12:11] universal word
[12:12] now and and i just wanted to hit this
[12:16] because
[12:17] uh some of you may have caught the news
[12:18] uh there the other day there was a
[12:21] congressman i believe it was and so he
[12:23] was trying to
[12:25] bring in this uh gender neutrality
[12:28] and try to be respectful and he said
[12:31] amen
[12:32] and a woman or something like that
[12:35] not even realizing that he was just
[12:38] taking some
[12:39] carnal and it's supposed to be a
[12:42] a a a an educated man and he just
[12:46] and he thought that amen meant something
[12:49] that had to do with men
[12:51] and you know and so he just started
[12:53] throwing a woman in there well
[12:55] you know if he had half a lick of sense
[12:58] that's texas for if he was had any
[13:01] intelligence
[13:02] um that he would that he would uh
[13:06] that the word amen had nothing to do
[13:08] with man or woman
[13:10] but that it had but there was a
[13:12] universal word
[13:13] that that literally means faithful
[13:18] uh is directly uh uh related it's
[13:21] it's uh i like this in the from the
[13:23] lexicon it says that it has been called
[13:25] the best known word
[13:28] in human speech remember it comes from
[13:30] hebrew
[13:32] and it was trans literated
[13:35] down into greek and then into latin and
[13:38] now into english
[13:39] and so being one of the so if you want
[13:42] to say
[13:43] amen in spanish
[13:46] amen hebrew amen
[13:49] you know turkish amen it's it's in every
[13:52] language like hallelujah you know you
[13:54] it's it's a
[13:55] universal phrase
[13:58] that means uh in the hebrew it means it
[14:02] was
[14:02] from uh believe or faithful
[14:06] thus it came to mean surely or or
[14:09] tr sure or truly uh it's an expression
[14:14] of absolute trust and confidence so that
[14:17] when
[14:18] you say amen to something that has been
[14:22] said that you believe and have
[14:24] confidence in that it's the truth
[14:27] and you're and you're resting on that so
[14:29] that when
[14:30] you know something is said you know that
[14:33] jesus christ is the same
[14:34] yesterday today and forever amen amen
[14:38] what is it
[14:39] you have confidence in that you have
[14:41] complete
[14:43] trust that that is the truth and that it
[14:46] is a faithful saying
[14:48] that it is a faithful saying and that uh
[14:51] it's uh it's a true saying and so when
[14:54] jesus here
[14:55] in in uh in revelations 3
[14:59] he said i'm the faithful and true
[15:03] witness he's using this language
[15:06] almost repetitively i'm the amen i am
[15:09] true i am faithful i i'm
[15:13] i'm unchangeable and so
[15:17] the word amen in a literal sense is
[15:20] solid firm foundation or the word
[15:23] firm metaphorically it could be
[15:25] faithfully
[15:26] or faithful
[15:30] verily the word verily is there we're
[15:32] going to inject that in a moment
[15:34] from the greek we'll see that it's used
[15:37] quite
[15:37] frequently in the new testament uh
[15:40] if if the word amen is used at the
[15:43] beginning
[15:44] of a statement uh or of a discourse
[15:48] such as verily verily i say unto you is
[15:51] this very common language in the new
[15:53] testament
[15:54] the lord jesus actually john is the only
[15:57] one that used the double
[15:59] amen amen at the beginning in his
[16:02] writings i think he's like 25 times
[16:04] that john uses verily verily where the
[16:07] other gospels they don't use that they
[16:08] only use the singular
[16:10] uh usage of the word verily but
[16:14] uh in in john uh
[16:18] many times but i reference john
[16:21] chapter 1 1-4
[16:24] because in the beginning was the word
[16:28] the amen is that right
[16:31] and so he starts in the beginning with
[16:33] the word amen
[16:35] and he that amen became flesh in verse
[16:39] 14
[16:40] and dwells among us so then at the end
[16:43] of a phrase
[16:44] it means so it is so be it
[16:48] uh it may be fulfilled you know you're
[16:50] saying
[16:51] that amen what's being said yeah you
[16:54] believe it
[16:55] and so uh it was a custom which
[16:58] passed over from the synagogues to the
[17:00] christian assemblies
[17:02] and when uh he had read or uh discoursed
[17:05] he had offered up solomon prayer to god
[17:08] and others responded
[17:10] amen and thus made i like this phrase
[17:13] here i should have capitalized it
[17:15] and thus made the substance of what was
[17:18] uttered their very own and that's right
[17:21] from the greek lexicon i
[17:22] i just i had to print that because
[17:26] that so that now then when something is
[17:28] said
[17:29] you know the works that i do shall you
[17:31] do also
[17:33] amen that you made that substance yours
[17:37] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[17:39] they shall recover
[17:40] amen amen that becomes your substance
[17:43] that becomes your possession
[17:46] and brother braham said when you take a
[17:48] promise of god and
[17:49] possess it as your own personal private
[17:52] property
[17:53] amen amen then you then now then what
[17:56] you have
[17:57] you you you have substance faith for
[18:00] faith is
[18:01] a substance is that right amen
[18:04] so
[18:10] i think that's where i'm supposed to be
[18:12] i hit it like three times
[18:18] yes so placing the
[18:21] the word amen at the end of a statement
[18:23] is a way of accepting
[18:25] agreeing or endorsing
[18:29] what came before
[18:34] from the old testament and and we're
[18:37] going to
[18:37] reference the old testament usage so
[18:40] that we can
[18:41] pick up what jesus said uh
[18:45] and what brother branham uh
[18:48] reveals to us in the church age book
[18:49] here but i wanted to inject this
[18:52] the bible says blessed be the lord god
[18:55] of israel from everlasting
[18:57] to everlasting and then all the people
[19:01] said
[19:02] amen and praise the lord so now then
[19:05] there was this
[19:06] acceptance and and that uh this god
[19:10] of israel was from everlasting to
[19:13] everlasting basically
[19:15] an old testament uh uh version
[19:18] of hebrews 13 8.
[19:27] this thing's about backslid i think
[19:31] jesus uh from the new testament was
[19:35] fond of saying i'm just just following
[19:38] this narrative from the
[19:39] from the greek lexicon uh was
[19:42] fond of saying amen before making a
[19:45] statement now watch this
[19:46] this uh this as he goes on here this is
[19:49] tremendous
[19:51] making a statement or giving a message
[19:53] when used in this way
[19:55] the word amen has slightly different
[19:57] implications
[19:59] leading off with amen not only implies
[20:03] that what follows is true but also that
[20:07] the person
[20:08] making the statement has firsthand
[20:11] knowledge and authority about
[20:15] about it saying verily verily
[20:18] before making a statement is a strong
[20:20] claim to truth
[20:22] presented from an intrepid or a
[20:25] fearless attitude that word intrepid
[20:28] means undaunted
[20:30] amen that it means that it's it's
[20:32] fearless it's it's it's absolutely
[20:35] uh that it's undaunted in the face of
[20:37] any
[20:38] opposition or danger and so when jesus
[20:41] is saying verily verily i say unto you
[20:44] and then he comes forward with some uh
[20:47] profound statement such as you know
[20:49] i i i wanted to go back and pick up a
[20:52] bunch of references but then i'd get
[20:53] over and preaching on those scriptures
[20:54] so
[20:55] uh you you just go through the book of
[20:57] john and you'll find where
[20:58] where jesus speaks using uh these this
[21:02] he said you must be born again verily
[21:05] verizon you must
[21:07] be born again so he wasn't this wasn't
[21:10] some
[21:10] uh uh thing that he was guessing on but
[21:13] he had firsthand knowledge
[21:16] and it wasn't a it was a he was he was
[21:18] fearless
[21:19] in saying this because he knew the
[21:21] necessity
[21:23] of the new birth and that without the
[21:26] new birth
[21:26] you could never see the kingdom of god
[21:30] of which he had seen he said i
[21:34] came from god and i returned to god and
[21:37] so
[21:37] he was he was explaining there's one way
[21:39] to get there
[21:40] and it's only through the new birth
[21:43] verily verily
[21:44] would imply that the that what follows
[21:47] is that person's own original
[21:50] idea and so he wasn't he wasn't making
[21:53] this up as he went along
[21:55] but he was speaking he said i don't i
[21:57] don't do anything but what my father
[21:59] shows me so when jesus leads off with
[22:01] the words verily verily he's actually
[22:03] saying
[22:04] i know this is true firsthandedly
[22:08] since many of the comments are on
[22:10] heavenly or spiritual or godly issue
[22:13] jesus uses
[22:14] use jesus's use of verily verily is
[22:18] part of i love this consistent
[22:21] claim of deity he was not
[22:24] speaking as a man he was speaking
[22:27] as a as god he was the fullness
[22:31] of the godhead bodily so
[22:36] uh let me catch up to myself here
[22:44] i like the statement he says jesus is
[22:47] not merely aware of these truths
[22:50] he is the one who originated them
[22:54] the amen of god he in the beginning was
[22:58] the word
[22:59] the word was with god and the word was
[23:01] god
[23:02] the bible says that all things were were
[23:05] for him and by him and without him
[23:09] nothing is made that is made so
[23:15] i'm just kind of finishing up here on
[23:16] this lexicon
[23:18] commentary he says the disciples and
[23:20] others listening to jesus so we're
[23:22] speaking from
[23:24] you know brother brown said it's an
[23:25] eastern book
[23:27] and if you want to know if you really
[23:29] want to understand then sometimes you
[23:31] need to know the eastern customs and so
[23:34] you know we inject this here that the
[23:35] disciples they understood what jesus was
[23:37] saying when he said verily verily
[23:39] when he said verily verily i say unto
[23:41] you the disciples were like
[23:44] okay this ain't this is not just a man
[23:47] speaking this is god himself and he has
[23:50] first-hand knowledge of what he's saying
[23:53] and so uh so the disciples understood
[23:59] the use of these phrases in exactly that
[24:02] way so when we read jesus's words
[24:05] and see statements beginning with verily
[24:07] or truly or some variation we should
[24:10] recall the deeper meaning
[24:12] that those claims are not only jesus's
[24:14] opinion on truth
[24:16] and and i and i i want to bring that
[24:20] down into our day
[24:22] that when brother branham is saying thus
[24:23] saith the lord or he's
[24:25] he's making an emphatic statement that
[24:28] you know he had firsthand knowledge that
[24:30] god spoke those words
[24:32] to him he knew that anointing in such an
[24:35] intimate way that he wasn't this wasn't
[24:37] brother brahms opinion
[24:39] on many things if it was he told you it
[24:41] was his opinion
[24:42] but when he comes forward with the word
[24:44] of god and makes those
[24:46] declarations uh you know concerning
[24:49] you know hair or dress or
[24:53] you know false doctrine or
[24:57] you know baptism or whatever the case
[24:59] might be he was bringing it from
[25:01] the from the from the point of the word
[25:05] that uh it wasn't just an opinion
[25:09] those are uh not just his opinion but
[25:11] those are his
[25:12] thoughts about which he has intimate
[25:16] personal first-hand knowledge and that
[25:19] last sentence is my own thought i
[25:20] injected there
[25:22] that at that moment he was bringing
[25:25] the thought to word so that when jesus
[25:29] is coming and he's and he's just
[25:31] speaking those letters and read in your
[25:33] new testament
[25:34] then then then that was the thoughts of
[25:36] god that already had
[25:38] existed for all eternity and now it was
[25:41] that
[25:41] season that time for that word to be
[25:45] to come from the thought process into
[25:47] the word process
[25:49] and then once the word is spoken then it
[25:51] has to come to pass
[25:53] amen and so uh we are
[25:56] blessed people in this day
[25:59] to see these things what's what's the
[26:01] cutoff moment
[26:03] time
[26:06] i got five okay
[26:12] from uh searches we we would see jesus
[26:15] brother brown says well
[26:16] that's what you should do that's right
[26:18] because
[26:19] the infallible word of god but did you
[26:22] ever
[26:24] try to ask god to make it manifest this
[26:27] is a
[26:27] and just take that thought right there
[26:30] that he's asking this question did you
[26:33] ever try to ask god
[26:35] to take the words that he spoke that he
[26:38] thought that he spoke in his bible and
[26:40] now
[26:41] make it real to you because the word
[26:45] it has to be materialized somewhere
[26:48] and so if he's the amen and you can amen
[26:51] the word watch what he says
[26:53] not just a historical christ but a risen
[26:55] christ now
[26:56] many people accept christ as their
[26:59] savior
[27:00] because well they're afraid of hell
[27:02] others are afraid to die without it but
[27:05] have you accepted him as your lord
[27:09] watch what he can do who can stand
[27:12] in the innermost part of you and open up
[27:15] the doors of your faith
[27:17] and just let you let yourself be in his
[27:20] hands
[27:21] i'm sure if you do he
[27:24] will punctuate every word in here with
[27:27] an amen
[27:28] why because he's the one that wrote it
[27:30] for it's his own
[27:31] spirit that wrote the bible is here to
[27:35] make it say amen because he
[27:37] is the ab the author of this bible
[27:41] so if you want the word to become real
[27:43] you have to pray you have to ask god
[27:45] lord let it become real
[27:47] you know i don't want to be a this isn't
[27:49] guesswork anymore
[27:51] i want reality we can't have uh you know
[27:55] intellectualism we can't have
[27:57] information we these things are good but
[27:59] we've got to have reality in the hour
[28:02] and time
[28:02] that we live jesus is giving us
[28:06] the description of himself in relation
[28:08] to the last age and so this is from the
[28:09] church age book
[28:12] and uh talk about the the the days of
[28:15] grace are winding up we're down into the
[28:17] 21st
[28:18] century uh told us about all the things
[28:21] concerning the ages and the
[28:22] characteristics to the last age
[28:24] to us he gives us one final look so here
[28:28] we are to the church of the laodiceans
[28:29] write these things saith the amen
[28:32] he gives us one final look at his own
[28:34] gracious and supreme deity
[28:36] and this is the capstone revelation of
[28:38] himself the supreme deity of jesus
[28:40] christ and him being the amen watch
[28:43] i want you to see the implications of
[28:44] what's going on here amen stands for
[28:47] the omega the last all right watch what
[28:50] it says here this is from the church age
[28:51] book where the man said it stands for
[28:53] approval
[28:54] it stands for prevailing promise and so
[28:58] if you look at the word prevailing there
[29:00] it means that it's a promise
[29:02] or the amen is here for a particular
[29:06] time that there's a current event
[29:09] there's modern events that are being
[29:10] made
[29:11] clear by prophecy and that this is uh
[29:14] having most appeal or influence or
[29:17] prevalent or relevant
[29:19] to the time to the age to the moment
[29:22] and so he is the amen so it's not he was
[29:25] the amen he
[29:27] is the amen so it stands for an
[29:30] unchanging promise hallelujah here is
[29:32] jehovah of the old testament
[29:34] the god of the amen here is jesus of the
[29:37] new testament the god of the amen hear o
[29:40] israel the lord thy god is one god
[29:42] and there it is again the jehovah of the
[29:45] old testament is the jesus of the new
[29:47] he is the god of the amen he never
[29:50] changes and what he
[29:51] does never changes he says it and
[29:54] stands fast he does it and it's done
[29:57] forever
[29:58] amen and none can take from what he says
[30:01] or add to it so let it be
[30:03] a man so let it be aren't you glad
[30:07] you serve that kind of a god
[30:11] it stands for the seal of god the amen
[30:14] stands for the seal of god so now then
[30:16] let us just extrapolate out what as
[30:18] brother braham said the evidence of the
[30:20] holy ghost is
[30:22] that you can amen every word of god
[30:25] amen it stands for
[30:29] uh it's something that you believe that
[30:32] god has put in there
[30:34] it's the holy spirit and god's
[30:38] holy spirit will what say amen
[30:42] to every word that's in the bible for it
[30:45] wrote the bible
[30:48] amen
[30:52] so how many times has the preacher
[30:57] ask you can you say amen
[31:01] well i'm here to give you a little
[31:03] insight to that
[31:06] that he's not asking you did you
[31:09] understand it
[31:12] he's asking you are you born again amen
[31:16] he's asking you are you full of the holy
[31:18] ghost can you say amen
[31:21] he's asking you have you been filled
[31:24] with that spirit that wrote the bible
[31:27] amen
[31:28] so amen means a whole lot more now than
[31:31] what it has ever meant
[31:32] before and brother jason and brother
[31:34] matt and the local preachers here
[31:36] they're going to
[31:36] really really they'll probably give me
[31:38] double offering
[31:39] for teaching you this amen
[31:42] why because they the preacher wants to
[31:45] hear you say amen
[31:46] not to vindicate himself but to
[31:49] vindicate you
[31:51] to finish for that you can hear yourself
[31:53] say amen i believe that i'm making what
[31:56] he's saying
[31:57] my own personal property i want to
[32:00] believe that i want it to be part of me
[32:01] i want to make it real to me
[32:03] i want the amen that wrote it i want him
[32:05] to come out of me and say amen to the
[32:07] word the word because he is the amen
[32:10] and so that so he's asking
[32:14] can you say amen he's not saying can you
[32:17] can you say yes i understand yes i
[32:21] believe
[32:22] you know yes i i'm in church i'm awake
[32:24] i'm vertical i'm taking nourishment no
[32:26] that's not what he's saying
[32:28] he's saying can you say can what's in
[32:30] you
[32:31] respond to the word of god in a positive
[32:34] way
[32:36] identifying what spirit
[32:39] is motivating you today
[32:42] let's stand
[32:48] our kind father we love you and we
[32:51] appreciate you today
[32:54] lord we just we want
[32:57] this word that we believe to become
[33:00] a living reality in our souls lord we
[33:04] pray for
[33:05] lord this revelation of this truth
[33:09] we see this final picture this
[33:13] last final identification
[33:17] that you gave to the ages and this is
[33:20] all they get
[33:22] there is no more and so lord we
[33:25] we want to amen our portion we want to
[33:28] amen the message of this last days with
[33:30] all that's in us that we can
[33:33] not just understand it but that we can
[33:34] become it that we can
[33:37] be the very manifestation of a
[33:40] thought that would became word that now
[33:43] has to become flesh let it be our flesh
[33:47] let it be you that lives in us and we'll
[33:50] be careful
[33:50] to praise you for it bless your children
[33:53] today bless the furtherings of the
[33:54] servants
[33:56] the service and we'll give you all the
[33:58] thanks and praise in jesus lovely name
