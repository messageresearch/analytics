TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone may the Lord richly bless you so good to see a lot of faces I haven't seen in a long time thankful for each one of you thankful that we're getting closer to all being together again and then let's stand up and we'll pray gracious Heavenly Father we just come to you now Lord and you are the Great and Living God you created all things Lord just by your spoken word Lord and as we look across the world and see Lord the disorder and chaos we can come back and look to you the one who is sovereign over all things Lord and put our faith and confidence that there is a purpose and there's a plan here we know there's an enemy that's battling against us that's seeking to exalt himself and yet Lord we also know that he's already been defeated that even as the scripture said that Jesus Christ made it may - open show of him when he conquered him and Lord we thank you for that we ask that your spirit would move in our hearts that you would speak to us teach us guide us give us revelation and understanding that we might know you more we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name Amen god bless you you can be seated so I this may not be a hundred percent true but I believe that this is probably bringing the Godhead series to a close I kind of feel like as I was studying and going through things that was it was a good place to finish up and and so we're gonna try to get through it just depends on if I go really slow so we're going to look and start with a quote here brother Branham says this we're gonna be looking at the Son of God and then we're gonna be kind of bringing a conclusion of the big picture so the son of God by supernatural birth the Bible said he is the beginning of the creation of God how did he begin in the wombs of a woman that's from the future home sermon where the Branham is looking at the beginning of the creation of God he was that beginning of the creation we are the continuous continuation of that creation Luke 1:35 and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God therefore means because of this so here here we see the connection there why is Jesus called the Son of God because he's some second eternal person of the Godhead so he's some pre-existing being no the scripture says he's the son of God because the Holy Ghost over shadowed Mary Psalm 2 verse 7 I will declare the decree the LORD hath said unto me thou art my son this day have I begotten thee this day it doesn't say in eternity this day a day in time in history was when he was begotten not eternally begotten and we we also understand son the words son assumes a beginning you cannot be a son and be eternal it it's a self-contradiction to make a statement like that Matthew 1:18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this why's this word there is jeanna oh it's the same place where we where we derive the word Genesis the birth of Jesus Christ that literally meat can be translated as the beginning the start is the beginning of the creation of God the Prophet said when did he begin in the womb of a virgin the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wises Mary Mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came to there she was found with child of the Holy Ghost again we'll skip past that first Corinthians 15:45 through 47 thus it is written the first man Adam became a living being the last Adam became a life-giving spirit but it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural and then the spiritual the first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is from heaven this is reading from the ESV English standard version so Adam became sin he he he brought sin upon all of us the human race and so we were fallen through Adam he was first in sequence Christ by his righteous nature became what is it what does the scripture say that there became a life-giving spirit so by his resurrection his death burial and resurrection he now becomes that life-giving spirit now it's the spirit of his son that brings forth adoption in our lives and so Christ Adam came forth from the dust Christ will return again from heaven Galatians 4 verse 4 but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law so this word made is from the Greek word you know my and it means to cause to be or to come into being or come into existence so the scripture here is saying he came into being from a woman or we say through a woman all right and when did it when did he come to be during the time of the law of Moses he was born under the law again these things I together with what brother branham was teaching us there what was the difference between Jesus and God he said he said this multiple times those the difference between Jesus had a beginning God had no beginning Jesus was the body in the tabernacle God is the spirit from this sermon God's gifts always find their places I love these quotes and I love putting them together because people want to take one and say we like we love this one but then they take the next one and say oh wait that we don't like that one let's dismiss it let's put it together because there's a reality there's a revelation in the there's a Kuenn there's an explanation that comes it brings a revelation of why he says things that seem like they're two different ways they're not because the scripture does the very same thing I'll give an example the scripture says no man has seen God at any time and then it goes even further says nor can see God and then literally when in when in Exodus he came to Moses and he came to the elders and they went and they gathered together and it says and they saw the God of Israel okay well seems like a contradiction to me but it isn't a contradiction there's a explanation which brings forth a revelation scripture always wants to keep us in balance doesn't want it doesn't want us to be flying off on this direction flying on off on this direction there's a balance to the whole picture another example is brother Branham says God God is not like the wind he's not like the air he's a being he dwells in a house another place he says he's a spirit that covers all space and time the scripture does the same thing well there's an explanation there I think we've we've explained some of those things throughout our series on the on the Godhead and I don't want to get caught up in that at the moment but just so you get a picture there so the man this is from God's gift find their places 1963 the man the body was not deity but deity was in the body that's actually quite simple it's quite simple and it's not a quote that we take and dismiss the rest of the quotes so look at harvest time brother Branham says in 1964 dude Jews don't try to claim him as yours he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God see you are what your blood is seeing of course your flesh and Mary of course Mary didn't have no conception with the Holy Ghost giving her sensation God the Father created a germ or an egg in Mary and a blood cell in her also and it was the blood of God so the man the body was not deity but the body was the blood of God is it to a person that doesn't want to understand and wants to fight the message these are great I gave them great ammunition but for someone who wants to see the scripture in its plain clarity it's a revelation it's a revelation Jesus Christ was the DNA of God so let's let's break it down the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary and created a little embryo sperm and egg fused together within her womb both of them were created by God one was not Mary's if he would have had Mary's egg he would have been a sinner in the nature like his mother so he'd God directly created within Mary a little man Adam so the first Adam the second Adam the first man the second man the first man was created as a full adult directly by God and he was to be the carrier of the life of God and to bring that life forward to the rest of the human race the same exact principle applies here to Jesus Christ one of them brought sin on the world the other one brought a life-giving spirit upon the world but not only did God create that DNA so that DNA was a perfect image and reflection of him so when Jesus was born he was the exact imprint of God's nature but that body wasn't deity okay but God also placed his very own life within that embryo where does your soul come from God where does your spirit come from the same the same thing but your spirit is not impact the the spirit of Jesus the human spirit of Jesus Christ is not impacted by a fallen nature like yours and mine are his the nature of his spirit was a perfect righteous faultless nature he could not be deceived he could not he could not be trapped into something he was unless and let he was unable to sin against God because of the very nature that he put within him so that was God's own the life that was placed into Jesus Christ so when you're looking at that body when you're looking at that baby when you're looking at that teenager when you're looking at that grown man doing his ministry when you're looking at that man hanging on the cross who are you looking at one perspective you say you're looking at the Son of God another perspective you said you say that's the invisible God right in front of me I'm seeing God hanging on the cross on the other hand we know brother Branham said he couldn't die as God the anointing left him you say it's all muddled and confused no it's perfectly in line with the scripture the scripture does the exact same thing so he had to be born with that nature of sin without the nature of sin that he inherited from Matt Mary and he was that last Adam a direct creation of God in a virgin just as Adam was a direct creation of God from the dust is the holy spirit a third person of the Trinity now this is this is an interesting thing because the the the gentleman the young man at the time that led me to the message struggled with several things that caused him to leave the message one was he couldn't understand the Seventh Seal and two was he started reading in John chapter 14 and 15 and 16 and he said the Holy Spirit has to be a separate person from God in Christ and so when you look at these verses you're gonna see that you're gonna see what point he's trying to make but we can't just take those verses and separate it from the rest of the verses in the Bible this is the very thing I warned him about but when you want to believe something and you want to reject something you'll do it so John 14 17 through 18 even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you okay we start there fourth verse 26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things in brief bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you alright so who is we have the father sending the Holy Ghost then Jesus says I'm sending it and then he says I'm coming to you so which person of the Trinity if there is such a thing is coming is that the second or the third person well now let's go further and let's get even more muddled Matthew 10:24 it is not ye that speak but the Spirit of your father which speaks in you now it's the first person of the Trinity all three persons are coming to dwell in me that's what I'm getting here Galatians 4:6 and because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts a father once again a reassertion saw three persons are gonna come dwell in me my goodness so Jesus says I'll come to you in the form of the Holy Ghost the father sends the spirit in the name of Jesus it's the spirit of your father it's the spirit of his son first corinthians 2:11 for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God so are you a separate person from your spirit no no it's a part of your being the mind of God and the Spirit of God and God himself are all one in the same different aspects of this very same person and Ephesians chapter 4 says there's one God and Father and of all who is above all and through all and in you all and so okay so how do we how do we have Jesus saying the son is going to be in you the father's gonna be in you there's just one spirit there's not two spirits not three spirits but what is it we understand there's a mediator that we have there's an intercessor there's a man that's standing in heaven for you and I in the presence of God and these are representative they're interceding for you and I we understand that but that that that God is so identified in that body that whatever God does that is what he's doing through Jesus Christ so what he's doing in you that's the spirit of his son that's the spirit of Christ and we understand Christ means The Anointed One but it also can mean the anointing and so who's in you Christ in you the hope of glory and so God cannot do anything except for through Jesus Christ the mediator he stands in our place he sees us he works on our behalf he moves through us and it's him not them not two persons but one person you see you got it you you you've got to see the distinctions cuz the Bible gives us distinctions but you got to see the unity because the Bible gives us the unity and if you get those out of balance you'll have two gods over here or you'll be Jesus only over there Father Son and Holy Spirit are revealed in one name we're all familiar but it's it's worth going through the scriptures again I'll do it quickly Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost 1st John 5:7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one doesn't say there's three persons in one says the three are one acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's one name of God that's the Lord Jesus Christ and when you're talking about the name of God you're not just talking about a name a word letters on pages the name is speaking of the very person and presence of God all of his attributes all that he is is bottled up into that name acts 816 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus acts 19 verse 5 when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus John 5:43 I'm coming my father's name and he received me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things do you remember its whatsoever I have said unto you acts 4 10 through 12 be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him that this man stand before you whole this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved it's that one name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want you to look at Isaiah 9:6 this is a prophecy of the very same thing for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given so he's a child he's a son and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace what did Jesus say I am come in my father's name so what what is it he's completely the the the visible identification of Almighty God when you're looking at him you're looking at the Father but we don't understand that into Jesus only since he's not his own father but when you're looking at him he is the invisible father made visible before us jesus said it's not me that does the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he does the works and you know read through on your own read through John chapter 17 you'll see the importance of the name Jesus said I have manifested your name think about that for a minute when you manifest the name of Almighty God what are you doing you're you're making him visible so think about that God was manifest in the flesh Jesus didn't go around say in in my father's name be healed in this he just did it why because he was the father's name he's the perfect reflection of his father John 1:14 and the Word was made or became flesh and dwelt or tabernacled among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth we're gonna give a little summary and then I'm gonna finish with several quotes from brother Branham that I think are marvelous summaries so God is a spirit the invisible father the man Christ Jesus the visible son if I look in the mirror the image in the mirror is not me and yet that image is the perfect reflection of me the one true and living immortal invisible omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent God is revealed perfectly in his own son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's not two persons it's one person we have the manhood of Christ and the deity of Christ brother Branham says in the sermon blind Bartimaeus I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of Jehovah God I lost sometimes brother Branham does this and he puts it just in such a paragraph and it's like did he just put the majority of the doctrine all just in one paragraph this is incredible I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of Jehovah God that God overshadowed Mary created a blood cell in her and she brought forth the son Christ Jesus God came and dwelt in this body reconciling the world to himself I believe that this Jesus is the son of Jehovah God and then in the sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1955 and the day that when John baptized him God have indicated him God spoke from the heavens John saw him coming in the form of a dove and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell the right translation there is in whom I'm pleased to dwell in Jesus immediate anointed with God he was just a man till that time but now he becomes the god man from things that are to be now Jesus is here speaking about he's gone ahead to prepare a place for us let not your heart be troubled now he was talking to Jews now you believed in God believe also in me as you believed in God believe in me because I'm the son of God see and God other words I and my father are one my father dwelling in me and what you see do I'm doing it's not me it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself it was easy for those Jews who had been taught through generations to believe that there was a great supernatural God but to think that that God had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son Jesus Christ God tabernacled in a body of flesh flesh that was a little too much for them to understand I think that's a beautiful way to close brother Branham puts it in such a brilliant way there and we'll just stand and dismiss and we'll leave it at that gracious Heavenly Father there's really there's no adequate human words to explain and encapsulate these things Lord we we know that it's a revelation to each and every heart of who you are it's not just a grouping of doctrines or ideas that were following and trying to lay out but Lord it's there's a truth that has been manifested in this day through a prophet to us we've we've seen I think of that ceremony preached I've heard of the by the hearing of the ear but now I see thee and how he went through the the line it went through the church and began to tell people their names where they were from tell them tell them what they're praying about in their secret places and then he spoke the words I've heard of you by the hearing of the ear but now I see the Lord I think that's the point of oh hi you're straightening out all these all these doctrines is that you want us to see you clearly in this day present tense of how you're revealing and manifesting yourself Lord in a many membered bride Lord we just give thanks for that we asked Lord hiding us teaching us leading us Lord I I pray Lord that this these things would cause each one of them we want to continue Lord with you on this journey that we have together father we just commit ourselves to you commit the service to you Lord we ask that you be lifted up and glorified through the name of Jesus Christ amen
