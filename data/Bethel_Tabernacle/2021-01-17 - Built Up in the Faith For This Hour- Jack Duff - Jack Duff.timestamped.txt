[1:01:16] royalty
[1:01:16] letting us know who we were there and we
[1:01:19] had a powerful time with that and
[1:01:21] i remember we had a sister in our church
[1:01:23] that was in a wheelchair
[1:01:25] and brother matt came down and he
[1:01:26] preached um
[1:01:29] a god of the mountain and
[1:01:32] it's also god of the valley and as he
[1:01:35] was preaching
[1:01:36] just the sister in the wheelchair was so
[1:01:39] excited about the word of god she
[1:01:40] couldn't get out the wheelchair so she
[1:01:42] just took a motorized
[1:01:44] chair and just pushed it towards the
[1:01:46] front of the church saying amen amen
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] we thought she was going to come out the
[1:01:51] chair that day you know all over the

[1:01:56] really wonderful services amen from

[1:02:29] amen i try not to go over time
[1:02:34] amen matthew 17 and
[1:02:37] we're starting here at verse
[1:02:40] 14. it says this and when they were
[1:02:46] come to the multitude there came to him
[1:02:49] a certain man kneeling down to him and
[1:02:52] saying
[1:02:53] lord have mercy on my son
[1:02:56] for he is a lunatic and so vexed
[1:03:00] for all times he falleth into the fire
[1:03:03] and off time and oft into the water
[1:03:07] and i brought him to thy disciples and
[1:03:11] they
[1:03:11] could not cure him then jesus
[1:03:15] answered and said o faithless and
[1:03:17] perverse generation
[1:03:19] how long shall i be with you
[1:03:23] how long shall i suffer you bring him
[1:03:26] hither
[1:03:27] to me when the lord jesus can
[1:03:31] make words a declaration like that he
[1:03:34] knew he was going to take care of the
[1:03:35] situation
[1:03:37] bring him hither to me and jesus
[1:03:40] rebuked the devil amen and he departed
[1:03:43] out of him
[1:03:44] and the child was cured from that
[1:03:47] very hour then came the disciples to
[1:03:51] jesus
[1:03:52] apart and said why could not we
[1:03:56] cast them out jesus said unto them
[1:04:00] because of your unbelief for verily i
[1:04:03] say unto you
[1:04:04] if you have faith as a grain of mustard
[1:04:06] seed ye
[1:04:07] shall say unto this mountain remove
[1:04:10] hence to yonder place and it shall
[1:04:12] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[1:04:16] unto you amen
[1:04:19] how be it this kind go if not out but by
[1:04:22] prayer and fasting
[1:04:23] also let's read amen over here

[1:07:06] us to overcome before we came into this
[1:07:09] season

[1:07:12] whether it was god
[1:07:14] or not and amen and as we accumulate it
[1:07:16] we should come to a spot where we
[1:07:18] realize

[1:08:04] impossible just being a christian
[1:08:09] amen means that you believe in the
[1:08:11] impossible things that just uh
[1:08:13] uh uh i mean that the ordinary world

[1:08:25] scene
[1:08:26] here in the book of luke if we can maybe
[1:08:28] just pick this up
[1:08:30] uh in luke chapter one and we'll we'll
[1:08:32] read a little bit from
[1:08:34] verse 26 but i just want to show you
[1:08:37] where your faith
[1:08:38] is actually resting glory to god
[1:08:42] amen just to be a christian you have to
[1:08:45] believe this
[1:08:46] amen look at this in luke chapter 1
[1:08:48] verse 26
[1:08:49] it says and in the sixth month the angel
[1:08:52] gabriel was sent from god
[1:08:54] uh unto a city of galilee named nazareth
[1:08:58] to a virgin a spouse
[1:09:02] in a spouse to a man whose name was
[1:09:04] joseph
[1:09:05] of the house of david and the virgin's
[1:09:07] name was
[1:09:08] mary amen to be a christian you have to
[1:09:11] believe in this story
[1:09:13] you have to believe in the virgin birth
[1:09:15] you have to believe in the impossible
[1:09:17] just by being a christian
[1:09:20] right it says and the angel came in
[1:09:23] unto her and said hell thou art highly
[1:09:27] favored
[1:09:27] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[1:09:30] among women
[1:09:31] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[1:09:34] his thing and
[1:09:35] cast in her mind what matter uh what
[1:09:38] manner of salutation
[1:09:39] this should be and the angel said unto
[1:09:42] her fear not mary
[1:09:43] for thou hast found favor with god
[1:09:46] look at this and behold thou shalt
[1:09:48] conceive in thy womb
[1:09:50] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:09:53] name
[1:09:53] jesus hallelujah he shall be great
[1:09:56] and shall be called the son of the
[1:09:58] highest and the lord god
[1:10:00] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:10:02] father david
[1:10:03] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:10:05] jacob forever
[1:10:07] and uh and uh and of his kingdom there
[1:10:09] shall be
[1:10:10] no end then said mary unto the angel not
[1:10:13] like this
[1:10:14] mary didn't get so excited on on the
[1:10:16] announcement
[1:10:17] hallelujah that i'm gonna have this son
[1:10:20] i mean she had she had a legitimate
[1:10:22] question
[1:10:24] amen i realized that i'm in the presence
[1:10:26] of an angel but
[1:10:27] and i'm in the presence of something
[1:10:28] supernatural but i got a very legitimate
[1:10:30] question
[1:10:31] because i i i believe the reason mary
[1:10:34] could have this question because she had
[1:10:35] a testimony that she was ki
[1:10:37] i am a virgin i've been keeping myself
[1:10:40] i'm a spouse to a man
[1:10:41] now how am i gonna have a child you
[1:10:43] realize what this will do to my
[1:10:45] testimony
[1:10:47] hallelujah i thank god for the
[1:10:49] supernatural experience but i want to
[1:10:51] know how does this fit
[1:10:52] and she and she asked this question mary
[1:10:55] said how
[1:10:56] shall this be seeing i know not a man
[1:11:00] now watch this watch this watch this
[1:11:01] because this is language
[1:11:03] that had never been used before mary's
[1:11:06] about to hear something that she'd never
[1:11:08] heard in church before
[1:11:10] see here here i mean never one sunday
[1:11:13] that mary sit in church
[1:11:14] and the priest talk about the holy ghost
[1:11:17] not one time
[1:11:18] but here she hears something that she
[1:11:20] never heard before but she responded in
[1:11:22] a way
[1:11:22] hallelujah that we need to respond today
[1:11:27] glory to god sometimes people come to
[1:11:29] the message and they hear things that
[1:11:30] they never heard before
[1:11:32] amen as the word has been brought to
[1:11:34] them that i've never seen that in
[1:11:36] scripture before
[1:11:37] but we just want you to respond the same
[1:11:39] way
[1:11:40] mary responded mary represents you
[1:11:44] this morning you find yourself in
[1:11:47] scripture you are represented as
[1:11:49] mary this morning hallelujah look at
[1:11:52] this now look at this it says in the
[1:11:53] angel answer
[1:11:54] and said unto her the holy ghost amen
[1:11:57] shall
[1:11:58] come upon thee and the power of the
[1:12:00] highest shall overshadow thee
[1:12:02] therefore also that holy thing which
[1:12:04] shall be a born
[1:12:06] of thee shall be called the son of god
[1:12:09] and behold thy cousin i love the way the
[1:12:12] angel does this
[1:12:13] because again she's never heard this
[1:12:15] before i mean wait a minute the holy
[1:12:17] ghost come upon me what what is the holy
[1:12:19] ghost
[1:12:20] she could have had more questions what
[1:12:22] is the holy ghost
[1:12:25] hallelujah and then she could ask what
[1:12:27] was the holy ghost given for
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:30] amen the holy ghost is supposed to
[1:12:32] overshadow me
[1:12:33] and cause this to come to pass mary had
[1:12:36] no clue
[1:12:37] what the angel was talking about we take
[1:12:40] the story
[1:12:41] amen because we've heard it so much we
[1:12:43] don't we don't really look
[1:12:44] at the details mary had no idea what the
[1:12:47] angel gabriel was saying to her
[1:12:49] but here she had faith in what the angel
[1:12:53] said to be truth brothers sisters
[1:12:55] there's some things we might not
[1:12:57] understand about this message
[1:12:58] but we have to have faith that what the
[1:13:01] angel brought to us
[1:13:02] is truth and what that angel spoke it
[1:13:06] shall be
[1:13:07] according to the word that is pope
[1:13:10] i believe that with all my heart he says
[1:13:13] to me hold thy cousin now this is what
[1:13:15] he does the angel says
[1:13:17] i know you've never heard this but what
[1:13:18] i'm going to do is give you something to
[1:13:20] increase your faith
[1:13:22] i'm going to tell you about something
[1:13:24] that just happened that maybe only you
[1:13:26] know
[1:13:27] that elizabeth was looking for a baby
[1:13:29] for a number of years and she could
[1:13:30] never get pregnant but i'm going to tell
[1:13:32] you something that your cousin elizabeth
[1:13:35] your cousin elizabeth amen she has also
[1:13:38] conceived a son
[1:13:40] in her old age and the angel's putting
[1:13:44] emphasis in certain parts
[1:13:46] because mary can say to herself now if
[1:13:48] if if elizabeth
[1:13:50] can have a baby in her old age
[1:13:54] then i can also have a child without
[1:13:56] knowing a man
[1:13:59] watch this it says in our old age and
[1:14:01] this
[1:14:02] is the sixth month with her who was
[1:14:04] called baron i love that i love the word
[1:14:07] of god
[1:14:08] she was call bearing because now that
[1:14:10] she's expecting the baby
[1:14:11] ain't gonna bring forth the baby she
[1:14:13] won't be barren anymore
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:16] and look at this statement for with god
[1:14:18] nothing
[1:14:20] should be impossible
[1:14:23] here the angel tells her you know mary
[1:14:26] don't doubt
[1:14:27] with god everything's gonna every
[1:14:29] everything will work out just fine
[1:14:30] nothing even though you never heard this
[1:14:32] before you never heard anybody preach
[1:14:34] about the holy ghost
[1:14:34] but marry with god nothing's gonna be
[1:14:36] impossible look at mary's response
[1:14:39] because this is your this is this is in
[1:14:41] this hour when we're building you up
[1:14:44] and the faith of this hour and your
[1:14:45] pastor's coming and preaching promise
[1:14:47] after promising
[1:14:48] other ministers are coming and preaching
[1:14:50] promise after promise your response has
[1:14:52] got to be the same way
[1:14:54] mary's response was look at this
[1:14:58] and mary said see this something's got
[1:15:01] to come out of your mouth
[1:15:04] something has got to come out of your
[1:15:05] mouth not just not just
[1:15:07] mentally agree with this we got to get
[1:15:10] beyond just
[1:15:11] mentally agreeing with this something
[1:15:13] has got to be stated out of your
[1:15:16] mouth hallelujah
[1:15:19] mary said glory to god see we heard what
[1:15:24] the angel said
[1:15:25] we heard what brother branham said but
[1:15:27] now it's time to figure out what is the
[1:15:29] pride saying
[1:15:31] the bride should be saying the exact
[1:15:33] same thing that the prophet said
[1:15:35] because the spirit and the pride say
[1:15:37] come
[1:15:38] on hallelujah glory to god
[1:15:42] what does mary say mary said be it on
[1:15:45] behold the handmaiden lord
[1:15:46] be it unto me according to thy
[1:15:50] word no more questions
[1:15:55] no no no i mean i i didn't i didn't
[1:15:57] underst i didn't understand that that
[1:15:59] topic about the holy ghost
[1:16:01] i didn't understand what the angel said
[1:16:03] but no more questions
[1:16:05] being unto me according to thy word i
[1:16:07] didn't make this up
[1:16:09] i didn't come up with this you spoke it
[1:16:11] to me so i say be it unto me according
[1:16:13] to that word
[1:16:14] there are things in this message that i
[1:16:16] did not hear when i was in denominations
[1:16:20] are things that the prophet said that it
[1:16:21] really challenges
[1:16:23] that position change that we were
[1:16:24] talking about it
[1:16:26] challenges you to come to a point like
[1:16:28] mary did
[1:16:30] being unto me according to that word and
[1:16:31] notice the angel departed from her
[1:16:34] after she accepted yes the word
[1:16:38] now i got a couple things i just want to
[1:16:40] say here amen uh
[1:16:42] when we look at the word impossible
[1:16:45] because the angel said there's nothing
[1:16:47] that's impossible with god but with god
[1:16:48] all things
[1:16:49] nothing shall be impossible when we look
[1:16:51] at the word impossible that means it's
[1:16:52] incapable of occurring
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:56] cannot happen now if there was anything
[1:16:59] impossible in our reading of the
[1:17:02] scripture
[1:17:03] a virgin cannot conceive and have a
[1:17:05] child
[1:17:06] it's impossible for anything like that
[1:17:09] to happen unless god is
[1:17:10] involved in the process hallelujah
[1:17:14] it's impossible for a virgin conceived
[1:17:15] we know how children are born
[1:17:17] right so so if there was anything
[1:17:19] impossible
[1:17:20] that very story was impossible
[1:17:23] but if you believe in the virgin birth
[1:17:26] it means that you already believe in
[1:17:28] miracles and you already
[1:17:30] believe in the impossible whether you
[1:17:32] experience one or not you still believe
[1:17:34] it
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:38] hallelujah here here uh uh when we look
[1:17:41] at this
[1:17:41] you know the very word impossible means
[1:17:43] it cannot be done
[1:17:45] it can't uh god god cannot violate his
[1:17:47] word that's another thing that's
[1:17:48] impossible
[1:17:49] he cannot lie uh when i was looking at a
[1:17:52] little statement here that brother
[1:17:53] branham made in spoken words original
[1:17:55] seed i won't read all of this quote
[1:17:57] but he said when mary said be it unto me
[1:18:00] according to thy word
[1:18:01] he said that statement along is what
[1:18:03] brought life into mary
[1:18:06] can you imagine that the statement that
[1:18:09] she released out of her mouth is what
[1:18:11] brought life
[1:18:13] no feeling no emotion
[1:18:17] a statement a statement
[1:18:21] a and if you want to see life come into
[1:18:23] your situation i have to ask a question
[1:18:25] what are you speaking
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:28] what are you saying right amen because
[1:18:31] just the statement alone
[1:18:32] be it unto me no not not trying to
[1:18:35] figure out let me see how this quote
[1:18:36] titled that quote and
[1:18:37] let me see how this scripture tied that
[1:18:39] no no no no be it unto me according to
[1:18:42] thy word
[1:18:43] that statement alone brought life into
[1:18:45] mary
[1:18:46] it caused her to become pregnant
[1:18:49] just by agreeing with the word of god
[1:18:53] and i believe this is what god has been
[1:18:54] trying to get his people to just
[1:18:56] agree with my word you don't have to
[1:19:00] figure it out
[1:19:01] amen just agree with my word
[1:19:05] watch it while he said uh said some
[1:19:07] other statements here
[1:19:09] amen he said mary shook away the doubt
[1:19:13] mary shook away the reason mary shook
[1:19:15] away the the unbelief and i'm gonna tell
[1:19:17] you we're gonna have to do the exact
[1:19:18] same thing in this hour in order to
[1:19:19] build our faith up for the hour in which
[1:19:21] we live
[1:19:22] we gotta shake away doubt we gotta shake
[1:19:24] away unbelief
[1:19:26] hallelujah we we feed ourselves too much
[1:19:29] unbelief
[1:19:31] oh yeah i'm gonna just put it that way
[1:19:33] we feed ourselves too much unbelief
[1:19:36] what we what we read on the internet
[1:19:39] what we see
[1:19:40] amen on cnn and on the news amen or
[1:19:43] something like that we
[1:19:44] feed ourselves too much unbelief
[1:19:48] we gotta get back to feeding ourselves
[1:19:50] the word of god
[1:19:52] hallelujah brother branham makes a
[1:19:54] statement here in the message jehovah
[1:19:56] miracles and i'm just
[1:19:57] just quoting not going to have time to
[1:19:59] read all of this she says
[1:20:00] she had mary he was talking about her
[1:20:02] set she had to believe
[1:20:04] the impossibles something that had never
[1:20:06] happened before
[1:20:08] but she never argued she never
[1:20:10] questioned anymore
[1:20:11] his word was enough for her
[1:20:16] and i i wonder are you sufficiently
[1:20:18] impressed
[1:20:20] with the word that is in your midst is
[1:20:22] the word
[1:20:23] enough for you
[1:20:26] glory to god it says but god takes the
[1:20:29] impossibles
[1:20:30] and makes them real when he is took
[1:20:33] at his word amen he says
[1:20:37] impossibles fade out when god is took at
[1:20:40] his word
[1:20:41] glory to god he says give us more mary's
[1:20:44] around here
[1:20:45] that can take god at his word and praise
[1:20:48] him
[1:20:49] whether you feel anything or not
[1:20:53] you know after mary got this this word
[1:20:56] from the angel
[1:20:57] mary didn't just hold it to herself mary
[1:20:59] actually began to testify
[1:21:02] about what had happened to him glory to
[1:21:04] god she told joseph what had happened to
[1:21:06] her
[1:21:06] he had some problems with it but god god
[1:21:08] revealed it to him and he was able to
[1:21:10] stay
[1:21:10] in his place amen but she also went to
[1:21:13] elizabeth
[1:21:14] and she began to talk to elizabeth about
[1:21:16] this testimony of the angel coming to
[1:21:18] her
[1:21:18] and uh elizabeth's like uh okay uh so uh
[1:21:21] uh you and uh joseph you're you're
[1:21:23] married right
[1:21:24] uh no uh you're you're not married
[1:21:29] you know what that means that's uh yeah
[1:21:31] i know but the angel came to me
[1:21:34] and the angel said this but i understand
[1:21:36] that but but you realize what society is
[1:21:38] going to say
[1:21:39] but i want to also want to tell you
[1:21:40] something elizabeth says you're giving
[1:21:42] me a hard time
[1:21:43] the angel also said something else the
[1:21:45] angel said that you are expecting
[1:21:49] what so now nobody knew that she was
[1:21:52] probably in hiding because she might
[1:21:54] have had
[1:21:54] so many mischaracters that she didn't
[1:21:56] think in her own age she could carry
[1:21:58] this baby but the angel said you're six
[1:22:00] months expecting
[1:22:01] yeah and then then they literally like
[1:22:03] okay now we can talk a little bit
[1:22:06] so yeah i am expecting but i need to let
[1:22:08] you know something
[1:22:09] the baby has not moved in my womb so i
[1:22:11] really don't know what to
[1:22:13] what to expect here it says but the
[1:22:15] angel told me that that my child's name
[1:22:17] is going to be called
[1:22:18] jesus hallelujah somebody
[1:22:22] elizabeth had an experience
[1:22:25] she said what did you say his name was
[1:22:28] gonna be
[1:22:29] jesus said something began to leap
[1:22:32] inside of elizabeth
[1:22:34] as soon as john heard the name jesus he
[1:22:37] had to come to
[1:22:38] life praise god hallelujah
[1:22:43] glory to god things changed inside of
[1:22:45] you literally when she heard the name
[1:22:47] jesus see
[1:22:50] see see mary just had to begin to
[1:22:53] testify
[1:22:54] about her experience and this began to
[1:22:56] bring life to other people
[1:22:58] why don't you start testifying about
[1:23:00] what god let it accumulate
[1:23:02] the things that god has already done let
[1:23:04] it accumulate so you have
[1:23:06] faith for this hour we need rapturing
[1:23:09] faith amen
[1:23:12] this statement here in the message
[1:23:16] christ is the mystery of god reveal
[1:23:18] brother branham says this is a new birth
[1:23:21] it's christ it's a revelation he says
[1:23:24] god has revealed to you
[1:23:26] this great mystery and that's that's a
[1:23:28] new birth now what are you gonna do
[1:23:31] when you get all that group together
[1:23:34] where the revelation
[1:23:36] is perfectly in harmony i believe god is
[1:23:38] actually doing that right now
[1:23:40] bringing the revelation perfectly in
[1:23:43] harmony
[1:23:43] he says in god expressing him through
[1:23:46] his word
[1:23:47] by the same actions the same things that
[1:23:49] he did making the word manifest he says
[1:23:52] oh if the church only knew its position
[1:23:56] and i love this statement it will one
[1:23:59] day
[1:24:01] he says the rapture will go when it
[1:24:03] knows what it is now i'll tell you when
[1:24:04] the prophets say it will one day i
[1:24:06] believe we're coming into that day
[1:24:08] right now where the church is
[1:24:11] recognizing
[1:24:12] her position
[1:24:16] what scriptures are you fulfilling
[1:24:20] amen what scripture are you fulfilling
[1:24:23] glory to god we're recognizing
[1:24:25] who we are in the scripture i'll just
[1:24:27] give you one
[1:24:28] real easy one that you know you're
[1:24:30] fulfilling it's a it's an easy scripture

[1:25:01] word i can find myself in the scripture
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:06] hallelujah that's an easy one we'll go a
[1:25:09] little deeper later on
[1:25:12] let's go here amen to this uh this
[1:25:14] another
[1:25:15] message here a shame uh brother branham
[1:25:18] makes this statement in his message he
[1:25:20] says so his word has to live out
[1:25:23] for every generation it says it lived
[1:25:26] itself in the days of moses
[1:25:28] because in that day the bible said in
[1:25:30] hebrews first chapter god and sundered
[1:25:32] our times and died as man
[1:25:33] spake to the fathers by the prophets and
[1:25:35] those prophets the church got all
[1:25:38] so twisted up that those prophets those
[1:25:41] daring messages of god
[1:25:42] come without church without denomination
[1:25:45] without organization without
[1:25:46] anything defy kings amen kingdoms
[1:25:50] churches and everything
[1:25:51] when the priest was brought before they
[1:25:53] was brought before the priest they
[1:25:54] wasn't ashamed because they had directly
[1:25:57] thus saith the lord he goes and says if
[1:26:00] you notice
[1:26:01] the prophet in one sense of the word
[1:26:04] in the old testament when he said thus
[1:26:07] saith the lord
[1:26:08] he says now watch him he says he goes
[1:26:11] right into the phrase of taking the
[1:26:14] place of god
[1:26:15] watch this when a prophet amen said thus
[1:26:19] saith the lord that prophet was going
[1:26:22] into the phrase
[1:26:23] of taking the place of god it says you
[1:26:27] notice
[1:26:27] when he placed out before him thus saith
[1:26:30] the lord he fell
[1:26:31] right into god and he acted as
[1:26:34] god it says then he gave his message
[1:26:38] which was god speaking through him thus
[1:26:41] saith the lord now you know that's why i
[1:26:45] read
[1:26:46] uh for us out of first kings 17 amen
[1:26:50] and verse 1 because here in this
[1:26:52] particular passage
[1:26:54] notice uh uh you know elijah
[1:26:58] he's just kind of coming and making a
[1:27:00] statement
[1:27:02] and taking the place of god oh yeah
[1:27:05] hallelujah
[1:27:06] and the bible says elijah the tishbite
[1:27:09] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[1:27:12] said unto ahab as the lord god of israel
[1:27:15] liveth
[1:27:16] before whom i stand there shall not be
[1:27:19] do nor rain these years
[1:27:23] amen but according to my words
[1:27:28] who controls the rain amen god does
[1:27:32] but here this prophet has actually taken
[1:27:34] the place of god
[1:27:36] by telling the king it's not going to
[1:27:38] rain until
[1:27:39] i say so that means you can stop your
[1:27:43] fasting
[1:27:44] you can stop your prayer you can stop on
[1:27:46] it nothing will happen
[1:27:51] can you imagine this this man said
[1:27:53] nothing will happen until i come back
[1:27:55] and call for rain
[1:27:56] the reason that elijah can say that god
[1:27:59] was actually dwelling
[1:28:00] inside of elijah
[1:28:04] he could take this authority because he
[1:28:06] knew he who he was
[1:28:07] in christ or in god let me put it that
[1:28:09] way my god
[1:28:12] what a what a place that he stood in
[1:28:14] that he could he could say when it's
[1:28:16] going to rain and when it's not going to
[1:28:17] rain
[1:28:18] amen i want you to just get this now
[1:28:21] um i want to
[1:28:25] let me just read a quote here out of
[1:28:28] spiritual food and due season
[1:28:29] the prophet makes this he said make the
[1:28:31] statement he says thank you says the
[1:28:32] prophets of the old testament or any
[1:28:34] time when they lived in the presence of
[1:28:35] god
[1:28:36] until they become the word their message
[1:28:39] is the word itself and remember
[1:28:40] he said thus saith the lord and when
[1:28:43] those men had
[1:28:44] those messages from god and they become
[1:28:47] so wrapped up
[1:28:48] and wrapped up that their own thinking
[1:28:50] it might have been against their
[1:28:52] thinking
[1:28:53] i love this statement it might have been
[1:28:55] against their thinking they might have
[1:28:57] they might not have ain't been able to
[1:28:58] see it right
[1:28:59] but they will speak in the word of god
[1:29:01] thus saith the lord there
[1:29:03] there will be there will not be any rain
[1:29:05] till i till i call for it
[1:29:07] oh what a statement he had been in the
[1:29:09] presence of god been vindicated so
[1:29:11] perfect and remember
[1:29:12] that also follows amos 3 7 the lord god
[1:29:14] will do nothing until first he reveals
[1:29:16] it to his
[1:29:17] servants the prophets said there's not
[1:29:19] going to be any rainfall
[1:29:21] now you know brother branham said
[1:29:23] sometimes these prophets get so wrapped
[1:29:25] up
[1:29:26] that it goes even against their own
[1:29:27] thinking can you imagine
[1:29:29] isaiah going around and saying a virgin
[1:29:32] shall conceive
[1:29:35] imagine you having to be the one to come
[1:29:37] out and say something like that
[1:29:38] a virgin shall conceive but he knew
[1:29:42] that god spoke that to him and he knew
[1:29:44] that no matter what god somehow was
[1:29:46] gonna bring it to pass
[1:29:48] even if it didn't make sense it was
[1:29:51] still going to be brought to pass
[1:29:54] now i was looking at this and i want to
[1:29:56] just uh take us a little deeper in this
[1:29:58] because
[1:29:59] in spiritual food and due season brother
[1:30:01] branham preaches
[1:30:03] this sermon from first kings he preaches
[1:30:06] in first kings 17
[1:30:08] but he made some statements here you
[1:30:10] know and and
[1:30:11] and i want to make sure i'm making this
[1:30:13] very clear to us
[1:30:14] here a prophet elijah
[1:30:18] is saying it won't be any rain till i
[1:30:20] call for what a place that this man took
[1:30:23] but he was taking the place of god the
[1:30:26] reason he could take the place of god
[1:30:28] is because god was dwelling in him right
[1:30:31] yeah amen i want you to know god is
[1:30:34] dwelling in you
[1:30:36] amen i i hear brother brother brother
[1:30:38] jason been been making the statement we
[1:30:40] got to find
[1:30:41] where the i am is yes
[1:30:45] we got to find where the i am is and i'm
[1:30:47] telling the i am
[1:30:48] is in you amen
[1:30:52] but this prophet amen takes the place of
[1:30:55] god and makes this statement
[1:30:56] but in the message of a spiritual food
[1:31:00] and due season brother branham does
[1:31:02] something that just
[1:31:03] caught my attention brother branham says
[1:31:06] amen in this man says i'm going to type
[1:31:09] elijah
[1:31:11] with the church of today i want you to
[1:31:14] think about that
[1:31:16] now here's a prophet preaching about
[1:31:19] another prophet
[1:31:20] and he's actually taking on the spirit
[1:31:21] of elijah but
[1:31:23] rather in spiritual food and due season
[1:31:25] type that prophet
[1:31:26] to his ministry brother branham makes a
[1:31:29] statement
[1:31:30] i'm gonna type elijah with the church of
[1:31:32] today
[1:31:33] which means the bride of today
[1:31:35] hallelujah
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:38] it's in there i can't i can't read it
[1:31:40] all you can go back and listen to
[1:31:41] the prophet type elijah to the bride now
[1:31:44] don't don't get me wrong
[1:31:46] sometimes you say things like this and
[1:31:48] people think you're going way
[1:31:50] over here somewhere no i know brother
[1:31:52] branham was the type of elijah but i'm
[1:31:54] telling you
[1:31:55] amen that brother branham typed in this
[1:31:58] message elijah to the bride
[1:32:00] why would he do that so the bride can
[1:32:02] recognize
[1:32:05] who she is and if the if the prophet
[1:32:08] elijah has the ability because god was
[1:32:10] dwelling in him
[1:32:12] to say it would not be any rain i need
[1:32:14] you to understand
[1:32:15] you have that same ability inside of you
[1:32:19] if god would ask you to do it
[1:32:22] now you don't just do this on your own
[1:32:24] but if god calls you to it you have that
[1:32:26] ability
[1:32:27] why because there's nothing impossible
[1:32:30] unto you
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:35] let's look at these statements that the
[1:32:37] brother that the prophet makes he says
[1:32:38] i'm
[1:32:39] to type elijah with the church today the
[1:32:41] church of today
[1:32:43] it says sin and unbelief by false
[1:32:45] teachers
[1:32:46] and modernists in the church had brought
[1:32:49] uh brought it to a place of oncoming
[1:32:52] judgment
[1:32:53] they turn from god's word and his
[1:32:55] prophet to a modern theological
[1:32:58] terms of the word he says just before
[1:33:01] the judgment
[1:33:02] and he was taught about this judgment
[1:33:03] that was given to come you know the fire
[1:33:04] is going to fall
[1:33:05] uh there uh against the the prophets of
[1:33:08] baal and so on and so forth
[1:33:09] but before that judgment he says a
[1:33:12] message was received
[1:33:14] glory to god and we can see ourselves in
[1:33:17] this because before the judgment's
[1:33:18] getting ready straight to earth we have
[1:33:20] received a message
[1:33:22] we're fellowshipping under this message
[1:33:25] and brother brandon made the statement
[1:33:26] i'll repeat it he said if this ain't
[1:33:28] that
[1:33:29] i'm just gonna hold on to this until
[1:33:32] that comes
[1:33:33] so there really is no need i had a
[1:33:35] conversation with somebody that you know
[1:33:36] had walked away from the word and
[1:33:38] and uh they they approached us you know
[1:33:40] they began to talk they say
[1:33:42] they say i guess it's really no need to
[1:33:44] talk to you
[1:33:46] i said you're absolutely right
[1:33:50] i'm not even considering it i'm not even
[1:33:54] thinking about it so there's no need
[1:33:58] to even waste your breath and talk to me
[1:34:04] i'm sorry i i i tried baptists i've
[1:34:07] tried pentecost there's no way i'm going
[1:34:09] back to that
[1:34:11] and i'm gonna tell you where where when
[1:34:13] when i was there
[1:34:15] it's much worse today than it was when i
[1:34:18] was there so there's no way you're going
[1:34:19] to get me to go back into nothing like
[1:34:21] that
[1:34:22] so if this ain't that let me just hold
[1:34:24] on to this
[1:34:26] until that comes
[1:34:28] [Applause]
[1:34:30] before the message before the message of
[1:34:32] judgment
[1:34:33] he said he said they received this
[1:34:35] message a message of grace that come
[1:34:37] and another thing he said about uh
[1:34:39] typing typing elijah to the bride to the
[1:34:42] church
[1:34:43] he says he had received he had a
[1:34:46] secret place hallelujah he says he had a
[1:34:49] secret place
[1:34:50] that was ordained of god and provided by
[1:34:54] god
[1:34:55] during the time of drought amen elijah
[1:34:58] had a secret place
[1:34:59] we as the bride we have a secret place
[1:35:03] that has been ordained by god to keep us
[1:35:06] during this time of drought
[1:35:09] glory he says if the bride is sustained
[1:35:12] through the spiritual drought
[1:35:14] of today glory to god another thing he
[1:35:16] said he said he received
[1:35:18] food every day
[1:35:21] elijah received food every day and i
[1:35:24] love the way this
[1:35:25] this this worked out because elijah
[1:35:27] didn't just have
[1:35:28] room service elijah had raven service
[1:35:35] blessed be the name of the lord i mean
[1:35:37] he didn't i mean he didn't even have to
[1:35:38] say what he wanted to eat the ravens
[1:35:40] just brought it in in the morning
[1:35:42] and they brought it in in the evening
[1:35:44] god made sure that the prophet was
[1:35:46] sustained
[1:35:47] during this time of drought a drought
[1:35:49] that he
[1:35:54] caused
[1:35:59] god will sustain your church and if we
[1:36:01] can just look back through the last
[1:36:03] year if we're sitting here right now we
[1:36:06] know god did
[1:36:07] sustain us and if we can just accumulate
[1:36:11] just accumulate what god has already
[1:36:12] done
[1:36:13] just keep accumulating that we'll see
[1:36:15] that he's going to bring us through
[1:36:18] again and again and again and again
[1:36:21] he received food every day he never had
[1:36:23] to worry about it running out
[1:36:25] and our secret place is found in
[1:36:28] christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:32] just reading this a little quote here
[1:36:34] out of spiritual food and ducey says
[1:36:35] during the time
[1:36:36] that he was going to punish the
[1:36:37] unbeliever uh he made a way for the
[1:36:40] believer
[1:36:42] and this isn't there any time in the
[1:36:43] days of noah god made a way for noah
[1:36:46] amen in the days of and lot was a mate
[1:36:48] believer but god still made a way for
[1:36:50] him
[1:36:51] so here in this hour we know god's going
[1:36:53] to make a way for us during the time
[1:36:54] that he was going to punish the
[1:36:56] unbeliever he made a way for the
[1:36:57] believer
[1:36:58] the same thing he does each time in the
[1:37:00] days when he was going to destroy the
[1:37:01] world by
[1:37:02] water amen he made a way of escape of no
[1:37:05] for noah in the days that he was going
[1:37:07] to drown
[1:37:08] egypt he made a way of escape across the
[1:37:10] sea for his people
[1:37:11] how god makes his way and
[1:37:14] where there is no way he is
[1:37:18] that way he is that
[1:37:21] way you know we say how a prophet can
[1:37:25] just take the place of god
[1:37:27] can speak something sometimes it goes
[1:37:29] against
[1:37:30] uh what he's even thinking but because
[1:37:33] uh uh because he's so
[1:37:34] wrapped up in god that these things just
[1:37:36] come out
[1:37:37] hallelujah and god actually backs up
[1:37:40] what he says
[1:37:42] it wasn't just with elijah that just
[1:37:44] happened in scripture
[1:37:45] but we we can look at the story of moses
[1:37:48] in the book of exodus
[1:37:49] they were coming out of egypt amen and
[1:37:52] god
[1:37:53] you know many of those things that god
[1:37:54] told moses to speak
[1:37:56] uh you know and and it was just spoken
[1:37:58] word creation that was happening down
[1:38:00] inside of egypt but they
[1:38:02] finally got to a spot where now they're
[1:38:04] coming out
[1:38:05] they're on their way uh their only way
[1:38:07] to the promised land and as they're
[1:38:09] coming out as they're exiting egypt
[1:38:11] god had multiple ways that they could go
[1:38:14] but he actually said no i don't want
[1:38:16] them to get too early in battle and all
[1:38:17] that they might get a little discouraged
[1:38:19] it says so i'm going to have them go by
[1:38:21] the way of the red sea
[1:38:22] now it seems like god is not a good
[1:38:24] general
[1:38:26] that he forces the people to go to the
[1:38:28] red sea
[1:38:30] and when they get there they're at the
[1:38:31] red sea can't see their way
[1:38:33] through it can't see their way over it
[1:38:36] can't see anywhere
[1:38:37] under it can't see nothing because
[1:38:39] they've never faced anything like this
[1:38:42] hallelujah glory to god and not only
[1:38:44] that they hear
[1:38:45] the chariots of pharaoh coming behind
[1:38:48] them
[1:38:48] and they begin to just maybe a panic
[1:38:51] uh moses what are we gonna do hallelujah
[1:38:54] to the lamb of god
[1:38:56] moses what are we going to do and and
[1:38:58] unless they're in that condition moses
[1:39:00] had no
[1:39:00] idea of what to do glory to god i want
[1:39:04] to read this
[1:39:04] amen let's read it from exodus 14. i
[1:39:07] want to read this i want us to see
[1:39:10] brother branham also picks this up and
[1:39:12] he makes a statement to us that
[1:39:13] we hold dear exodus chapter 14.
[1:39:17] i want to read from verse 13 i believe
[1:39:21] glory glory glory glory
[1:39:24] amen manny man uh
[1:39:27] i might have the exodus 14. okay
[1:39:30] uh yeah so here here it says uh
[1:39:33] moses now while they're in this this
[1:39:35] this um
[1:39:36] panic state let's put it that way
[1:39:39] they're panicking
[1:39:40] it says moses said unto the people fear
[1:39:43] ye
[1:39:44] not stand still
[1:39:48] and see the salvation of the lord which
[1:39:50] he will show you to show to you today
[1:39:53] for the egyptians whom you have seen
[1:39:55] today
[1:39:56] you shall see them again no more forever
[1:39:58] and i need you to understand
[1:40:00] god never told moses to say that
[1:40:05] god never told him amen moses i want you
[1:40:08] to go out and do it this way god
[1:40:09] never gave him instruction on speaking
[1:40:12] that verse
[1:40:13] moses spoke that under inspiration i
[1:40:16] want to know what's coming out of your
[1:40:17] mouth
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:19] and not only did moses speak speaking on
[1:40:21] inspiration god
[1:40:23] backed it up
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:26] the egyptians that you see today you
[1:40:29] will see them no more forever
[1:40:31] now after moses comes from under the
[1:40:33] inspiration he says this
[1:40:35] in verse 14 he says the lord shall fight
[1:40:37] for you and ye
[1:40:38] shall hold your peace now the problem is
[1:40:42] this is where the prophet brings it out
[1:40:44] to us
[1:40:46] the problem is verse 15
[1:40:49] and the lord said unto moses wherefore
[1:40:51] cries down to me speaking to the
[1:40:52] children of israel that they go forward
[1:40:54] the problem is here what happened
[1:40:56] between his inspiration
[1:41:00] amen and now the action
[1:41:03] what happened in between here now
[1:41:05] inspiration he says
[1:41:07] they know the lord gonna fight for you
[1:41:08] you know the egyptians that you've seen
[1:41:10] today you'll see him no more forever
[1:41:11] but what happened between that and god
[1:41:13] having to rebuke moses
[1:41:15] [Applause]
[1:41:16] in between verse 14 and 15 something
[1:41:19] happened
[1:41:20] and brother branham told us this is this
[1:41:22] is the nature of man to do this
[1:41:24] when we begin to go through certain
[1:41:25] things in our life we begin to cry unto
[1:41:27] god but god speaks back to
[1:41:29] his people god says why cry
[1:41:33] speak open up your mouth and speak and
[1:41:36] move forward
[1:41:39] we must recognize who we are so we all
[1:41:42] get trapped in between verse
[1:41:43] 14 and 15. but it doesn't change god's
[1:41:48] mind
[1:41:48] glory god still wants us to speak and
[1:41:50] move forward didn't you just say moses
[1:41:53] that i'm going to fight for you then you
[1:41:55] just say it's going to happen then you
[1:41:56] say the egyptians not going to be seen
[1:41:58] anymore
[1:41:58] why are you doubting and crying now
[1:42:00] moses speak and go forward
[1:42:04] god did something so supernatural that
[1:42:06] we still talk about it today when he
[1:42:07] parted the red sea and they walked
[1:42:09] through on dry land
[1:42:10] hallelujah look if god can do things
[1:42:12] like that in the old testament
[1:42:14] i want to tell you jesus christ is the
[1:42:16] same yesterday today of heaven
[1:42:18] amen he can take care of a virus
[1:42:24] he can take care of a plague he can do
[1:42:27] it
[1:42:28] no matter how many strands come forth
[1:42:31] our god is able to take care of that
[1:42:35] hallelujah glory to god i believe that
[1:42:38] church
[1:42:39] moses spoke under inspiration he could
[1:42:42] take the place of
[1:42:43] god and speak this and then god backed
[1:42:46] it up what happened when they went
[1:42:47] through the red sea
[1:42:48] that the children of israel made it
[1:42:49] through on dry land but the the
[1:42:51] egyptians
[1:42:53] were drowned the egyptians they sing
[1:42:56] that day
[1:42:56] they saw no more forever that's right
[1:42:59] now there's gonna be some other
[1:43:00] egyptians
[1:43:02] just not those egyptians
[1:43:06] let's go on brother brandon makes a
[1:43:08] statement
[1:43:10] i i just he said um
[1:43:13] god was going to sit down after he saw
[1:43:16] moses and children of israel coming out
[1:43:18] god was so pleased with what he was
[1:43:19] seeing that
[1:43:21] brother bram said god was on his way to
[1:43:22] go sit down when he heard moses cry out
[1:43:25] what shall i do he said what
[1:43:28] you can't you can't be you gotta you
[1:43:31] gotta be kidding
[1:43:32] what what did jesus say what shall i do
[1:43:35] speak and move forward moses
[1:43:37] i want to tell you that this morning
[1:43:38] church speak amen
[1:43:41] go forward and i'm going to say it like
[1:43:44] this whether you feel it
[1:43:46] whether you see it whether you
[1:43:49] understand it
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:55] the prophet says this and god hiding
[1:43:56] himself in simplicity
[1:43:58] revealing himself in the same it says if
[1:44:00] you abide in me
[1:44:01] my words abide in you ask what you will
[1:44:04] it shall be given to you
[1:44:06] amen where is the church standing at it
[1:44:08] says let there be frogs and there wasn't
[1:44:10] a frog in the country and
[1:44:12] he says uh and there wasn't a frog in
[1:44:14] the country in an hour's time
[1:44:16] they were 10 foot deep in places
[1:44:20] it says what was it it was god the
[1:44:21] creator
[1:44:23] hiding himself in a simple man amen
[1:44:27] that same god is hiding himself in you
[1:44:31] now i want to go a little further here
[1:44:33] we got
[1:44:34] uh taking the place of god we see uh
[1:44:37] moses can do that moses did it
[1:44:39] uh uh elijah did it i want to show you
[1:44:42] also brother branham did it
[1:44:44] in a different situation there's
[1:44:46] multiple situations where brother
[1:44:47] branham actually said
[1:44:48] he took the place of god all right but i
[1:44:50] won't read all of that
[1:44:52] but i want to show you in one one
[1:44:53] situation that you all would uh
[1:44:55] probably remember this isn't a message
[1:44:59] speak to this mountain
[1:45:02] it says well i i stepped out to one side
[1:45:05] and the spirit of the lord came upon me
[1:45:06] and began to shake and they said
[1:45:09] and i said the spirit lord said there is
[1:45:11] a trap
[1:45:14] set for you and be thou careful
[1:45:18] what you say
[1:45:22] amen it says fred where are you at it
[1:45:24] says are you in the meeting here tonight
[1:45:26] he says
[1:45:26] i know he come over yes right back here
[1:45:28] that's right we
[1:45:30] left there and i told brother sophomores
[1:45:31] something's fixing to happen
[1:45:34] and when he when we got to that to the
[1:45:36] meeting that night i said to the
[1:45:38] audience remember
[1:45:38] thus saith the lord there's a trap set
[1:45:40] for me
[1:45:42] and all of you pray that i'll know what
[1:45:44] no no to do the right thing
[1:45:46] when this comes to pass now now i find
[1:45:49] this
[1:45:49] i'm gonna i'm gonna keep reading but i
[1:45:51] have to just inject this
[1:45:53] the same god that knew there was a trap
[1:45:55] for the prophet
[1:45:56] yeah it's also the same god that could
[1:46:00] have stopped the trap from happening
[1:46:01] amen amen
[1:46:05] you have to ask the question why didn't
[1:46:07] god stop it it's because god wanted to
[1:46:12] see what was in
[1:46:14] his prophet can i ask you another
[1:46:16] question i want to give this to you
[1:46:18] why does god allow you to go through
[1:46:19] certain trials and tribulations
[1:46:22] because god wants to see what is inside
[1:46:23] of
[1:46:29] the next thing next night it happened
[1:46:32] the devil sent in two people a young boy
[1:46:36] and a girl to break up the meeting
[1:46:37] and that was it was in not new hampshire
[1:46:39] but vermont freddie you remember the
[1:46:41] name of the city it was the capital of
[1:46:42] vermont
[1:46:43] we were just across lake champlain and
[1:46:45] so when we
[1:46:46] uh so when we were in the meeting this
[1:46:48] boy the girl looked like just across
[1:46:50] uh looked like kind of a mongolian girl
[1:46:52] but the boy was just holding him they
[1:46:54] were both
[1:46:55] at least 25 years old a piece but such
[1:46:57] immoral acts
[1:46:59] in a church it says they were setting
[1:47:01] about like this from me
[1:47:02] and when i started preaching he would
[1:47:04] just grab him throw her head back and
[1:47:06] climb up and
[1:47:06] make uh uh climb up on our kids and
[1:47:09] carry on just
[1:47:10] act off when the meetings and the ushers
[1:47:12] couldn't make him be quiet
[1:47:14] and i said to him from the platform i
[1:47:15] said young man don't do that
[1:47:18] you're attracting the attention while
[1:47:20] i'm preaching
[1:47:21] he said and he just laughed right out at
[1:47:23] me
[1:47:24] i thought oh oh there it is there's the
[1:47:27] trap
[1:47:30] right there now now i don't know if many
[1:47:33] of us here would have been spiritual
[1:47:34] enough to recognize
[1:47:36] that was a trap
[1:47:39] but here the prophet called he said oh
[1:47:41] there it is
[1:47:42] there's a trap right there it says i
[1:47:44] went right ahead speaking just the same
[1:47:46] and though
[1:47:47] he got so immoral with her till i had to
[1:47:50] stop again i said
[1:47:51] don't do that sir please i said if you
[1:47:55] want to make uh
[1:47:56] make love to the young lady then you
[1:47:57] leave the building but
[1:47:59] this is a religious meeting say you
[1:48:02] shouldn't do that
[1:48:03] please don't do that while i'm preaching
[1:48:05] i started again he just made it worse
[1:48:08] look at this it says and then when i
[1:48:10] when i was a turn i said now something
[1:48:12] said to me
[1:48:13] something said to me
[1:48:17] say what you will and it'll be done
[1:48:23] i stood there mr mercer the tape boy and
[1:48:26] all of them
[1:48:26] standing brother bread brother fred and
[1:48:28] many of them standing uh standing pretty
[1:48:30] the perspiration was just running from
[1:48:32] me something said say blindness
[1:48:35] it'll be blind say death they'll pack
[1:48:38] them out
[1:48:39] say what you will hallelujah say what
[1:48:42] you will
[1:48:43] i couldn't speak i couldn't move and
[1:48:45] they just left
[1:48:46] i thought god what must i do
[1:48:50] and i turned and he stood there and his
[1:48:51] face white looking at me i i thought
[1:48:53] what must i say then i turn and looked
[1:48:56] before i ever know what i'd said i said
[1:48:59] i forgive you
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:04] of your act yes look at this the prophet
[1:49:07] says and it must have been the right
[1:49:09] thing to say
[1:49:11] it was god trying a reaction
[1:49:17] on an action and i want to tell you
[1:49:19] something when you're going through
[1:49:20] different trials and tribulations god is
[1:49:22] just trying to react it's not the action
[1:49:24] that's the problem
[1:49:25] the reaction is what god is looking at
[1:49:28] and here in this situation brother
[1:49:30] branham took the place of god he could
[1:49:32] have pronounced death and it would have
[1:49:33] been death
[1:49:34] he could have pronounced blindness and
[1:49:36] there would have been blindness
[1:49:38] whatever he said would have come to pass
[1:49:40] right there at that moment
[1:49:43] but because god was in him he said the
[1:49:46] right thing
[1:49:47] i forgive you
[1:49:51] maybe just maybe yeah
[1:49:55] we might see a freedom or release and
[1:49:57] some of our family members
[1:49:58] if we could practice the same words
[1:50:02] maybe after this service maybe we can go
[1:50:04] tell somebody
[1:50:05] i forgive you amen
[1:50:09] yes even if they didn't apologize
[1:50:14] i forgive you did this group did this
[1:50:17] get brother and sister
[1:50:19] i can't even call him brother and sister
[1:50:20] this young man and young woman did they
[1:50:21] apologize no they laughed at the prophet
[1:50:24] but he still said i forgive you
[1:50:31] he took the place of god in this
[1:50:32] situation see this type of power is
[1:50:35] something that we know we need
[1:50:36] character with because power without
[1:50:38] character
[1:50:39] is satanic
[1:50:42] let me go forward here in uh in our in
[1:50:45] our sermon
[1:50:47] now i want to slip back over to
[1:50:51] our scripture i want to ask this
[1:50:53] question i i brought out three different
[1:50:56] instances where prophets have taken
[1:50:59] taken the place of god elijah took the
[1:51:02] place of god moses
[1:51:03] took the place of god and even in our
[1:51:05] day god's prophet
[1:51:06] took the place of god i have a question
[1:51:09] for you
[1:51:11] is this only for prophets
[1:51:16] is this only for prophets
[1:51:19] and i can prove to you that in scripture
[1:51:20] it's not only for prophets
[1:51:22] because there was one day uh a man that
[1:51:25] was begging at the
[1:51:26] at the temple gate he wanted some wanted
[1:51:28] some arms he's you know i need this and
[1:51:30] i need that and he's just sitting there
[1:51:32] begging and just trying to get whatever
[1:51:33] he can from whoever would give it
[1:51:36] but on this day peter and john happen to
[1:51:38] be coming to the temple
[1:51:40] and they saw him sitting there at the
[1:51:41] gate and when they saw him
[1:51:43] something just began to rise up and pete
[1:51:44] and brother branham said no doubt
[1:51:46] jesus passed by that gate many times
[1:51:49] and the reason jesus passed by saw the
[1:51:52] man he never did anything
[1:51:53] because he was leaving this
[1:51:56] for the disciples there are some things
[1:51:59] that have been left
[1:52:00] for us brother branham's not here
[1:52:02] anymore
[1:52:03] but jesus is here and there are some
[1:52:05] things that have been
[1:52:06] left for us to take care of church we
[1:52:08] have to rise to our position
[1:52:10] in christ and take care of god's
[1:52:12] business amen
[1:52:14] he says he left him there he left him
[1:52:16] there and here come the disciples
[1:52:18] passing by the gate on this day and
[1:52:20] something just struck me and said i
[1:52:21] don't know i don't know why this
[1:52:23] this he says wait a minute stop stop
[1:52:24] stop john
[1:52:26] says hey sir yes you know give me a give
[1:52:29] me a dollar two dollars whatever no
[1:52:31] no no no look on us what do you mean
[1:52:34] it's silver and gold have we none
[1:52:37] we don't i don't have any money to give
[1:52:39] you hallelujah it says but such as i
[1:52:42] have
[1:52:43] i give unto thee he had the power of god
[1:52:46] in him
[1:52:47] amen the faith that the and the brother
[1:52:49] branham even said this about this man he
[1:52:52] says the faith that was in jesus christ
[1:52:55] dropped down inside of this man and
[1:52:58] cause him to believe what peter was
[1:52:59] saying to him
[1:53:01] hallelujah church when our faith has run
[1:53:03] out we need the faith of god to come on
[1:53:05] the inside
[1:53:06] and it's gonna take that kind of faith
[1:53:08] to get ready for a rapture
[1:53:13] hallelujah the faith of jesus christ
[1:53:17] dropped down to this man and calls him
[1:53:18] to believe the word of god
[1:53:20] amen it says he said simon go have a
[1:53:22] number look on us
[1:53:24] simon go have we done but such as we
[1:53:26] have we give unto thee rise up and walk
[1:53:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:53:30] peter was not a prophet amen
[1:53:35] but the spirit of god was dwelling in
[1:53:36] peter that caused him to be able to
[1:53:38] bring this miracle to pass
[1:53:40] amen oh yes hallelujah church amen
[1:53:43] hallelujah church brother branham makes
[1:53:46] some statements here
[1:53:48] it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:53:50] righteousness he says
[1:53:51] it was behold behooving the saint peter
[1:53:53] the old fisherman didn't have enough
[1:53:54] education to sign his own name
[1:53:56] but one day when he was going through
[1:53:57] the beautiful gate that solomon had
[1:53:59] built
[1:53:59] there laid a man who was lame his knees
[1:54:01] was weak ankles he couldn't walk
[1:54:03] he bend that way hat he had no strength
[1:54:05] a man about 40 years old he had no
[1:54:07] strength
[1:54:08] but when peter heard the cup rattle and
[1:54:11] he looked down and seen a crippled man
[1:54:12] laying there
[1:54:13] something pounded in his heart he he had
[1:54:16] been
[1:54:16] at pentecost his experience produced
[1:54:19] this
[1:54:20] he had been at pentecost he had the holy
[1:54:22] ghost he had the promise of jesus so it
[1:54:24] was behooven it was becoming to him
[1:54:26] that he said still and go have a nun he
[1:54:28] gave his testimony
[1:54:31] wow that's all it did
[1:54:34] that's what produced a miracle he gave
[1:54:37] his testimony sometimes we want to be so
[1:54:39] deep with people brother branham say
[1:54:42] just tell them how it got lit
[1:54:43] give your testimony
[1:54:47] simple things he gave his testimony
[1:54:50] i have no silver and gold but such as i
[1:54:53] have i'll give it
[1:54:54] i'll give it to you if you can receive
[1:54:56] it it's like his brother ma'am said i
[1:54:58] can imagine the man say i can receive it
[1:55:01] it says then in the name of jesus christ
[1:55:03] of now to stand on your feet and be made
[1:55:05] well
[1:55:05] and he reached down and got him to
[1:55:08] exercise
[1:55:09] his faith raise him up like that
[1:55:12] and his ankle bones received strength
[1:55:14] and he went leaping and praising and
[1:55:16] glorifying
[1:55:18] god
[1:55:21] we need services like this amen
[1:55:24] we need a move of the spirit like this
[1:55:26] but we just need people to just get a
[1:55:27] hold of some simple faith
[1:55:30] now i want to get back to this scripture
[1:55:31] here uh before before i do
[1:55:33] uh i i got to say this uh this god
[1:55:36] perfected this church brother branham
[1:55:37] makes this
[1:55:38] no no no i can i'll save that i'll save
[1:55:41] that
[1:55:41] this scripture that we read in matthew
[1:55:46] glory to god matthew 17. this man
[1:55:50] had an epileptic son that was
[1:55:54] falling in fire and falling in water and
[1:55:56] the devil was trying to kill this
[1:55:58] this little boy i mean he was trying to
[1:56:00] kill him just in anything he could to
[1:56:02] kill this boy
[1:56:03] yeah the father had brought because he
[1:56:06] saw
[1:56:07] uh the disciples uh in the company of
[1:56:10] jesus he thought for sure if i just get
[1:56:12] him to the disciples
[1:56:14] they'll they'll get this thing taken
[1:56:15] care of i just need him to be with
[1:56:17] somebody that's been with jesus
[1:56:20] that's what the father's faith was but
[1:56:22] here jesus
[1:56:23] you know comes on the scene and and
[1:56:25] brother branham gives us
[1:56:26] um an understanding as to what was
[1:56:29] really going on here
[1:56:31] brother adams showed us that the reason
[1:56:33] that the disciples really couldn't do
[1:56:34] anything about this
[1:56:35] is because they were competing with one
[1:56:38] another
[1:56:39] hallelujah he says what was happening
[1:56:42] say peter would say
[1:56:43] well see this happened when i went out
[1:56:45] and prayed for the sick so let me show
[1:56:46] you how to do it
[1:56:48] and then nothing would happen so then
[1:56:49] maybe john said peter the reason
[1:56:52] you know you're not getting any results
[1:56:53] because that that wasn't you that you
[1:56:55] know let me show you what i did and this
[1:56:57] is what happened in my meeting
[1:56:58] and then maybe maybe the next one said
[1:57:00] this is what happened i mean they were
[1:57:02] competing with one another
[1:57:04] and as they were competing with one
[1:57:05] another nobody was getting any work done
[1:57:10] we make it all about us i'm not trying
[1:57:12] to make it like that amen it's still all
[1:57:14] about christ
[1:57:15] but we have to realize when we find out
[1:57:16] where the i am is
[1:57:19] the i am is living inside of us
[1:57:23] it's not you're doing this in your own
[1:57:24] strengths
[1:57:26] hallelujah this is because the i am is
[1:57:28] dwelling on the inside of you
[1:57:30] now look at this brother adam brother
[1:57:32] branham tells us that they were
[1:57:33] competing with one another and
[1:57:35] as they're going through this these
[1:57:36] motions and then if the father finally
[1:57:38] see jesus come on the scene he's like
[1:57:39] you know look
[1:57:40] i took him to your disciples they
[1:57:42] weren't able to get
[1:57:44] nothing accomplished says is there
[1:57:46] anything you would be able to do for me
[1:57:48] i i don't like seeing my son in this
[1:57:50] condition
[1:57:52] i don't like seeing them you know i have
[1:57:53] to i'm constantly watching i'm not sure
[1:57:55] winning on getting fired when he gonna i
[1:57:57] just don't know jesus i need help
[1:58:00] yeah yeah amen amen jesus said to what
[1:58:04] faithless generation bring them unto me
[1:58:07] and the bible say he rebuked that devil
[1:58:09] and and when he rebuked it that devil
[1:58:11] had the hardest fit that he ever had
[1:58:15] i'm gonna tell you something when things
[1:58:16] get harder
[1:58:18] it might be because it's getting better
[1:58:20] right now
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:24] i want to say that again when things get
[1:58:26] harder
[1:58:27] it might be because it's actually
[1:58:29] getting better
[1:58:34] man you know his son has this this
[1:58:36] terrible feeling jesus said no just pick
[1:58:38] him up he's going to be all right
[1:58:40] going home with him now and you know the
[1:58:42] boy was delivered and
[1:58:43] you know just a supernatural event took
[1:58:46] place the disciples had their eyes on
[1:58:48] that
[1:58:49] and privately i love the way he does
[1:58:51] this not publicly they
[1:58:53] he didn't put it on on facebook or
[1:58:56] instagram or anything
[1:58:57] you know the reason that they couldn't
[1:58:58] get it done
[1:59:00] he didn't do any of that it was
[1:59:02] privately
[1:59:04] that he spoke to the disciple they asked
[1:59:05] say why can we get the job done
[1:59:08] yeah i want you to understand his answer
[1:59:12] right your unbelief
[1:59:17] amen you know what brother branham said
[1:59:22] it wasn't that the disciples did not
[1:59:24] have the power
[1:59:26] right they actually had the power jesus
[1:59:29] gave them the power and never took it
[1:59:31] away from them right right right
[1:59:33] it was their unbelief amen you want to
[1:59:36] know what's stopping us
[1:59:40] our unbelief and this is why i have a
[1:59:43] prayer
[1:59:44] i'll be the first one to admit some it's
[1:59:45] my unbelief that gets in god's way
[1:59:48] my unbelief right he said but but i have
[1:59:51] a prayer the same way
[1:59:52] there was another gentleman that
[1:59:53] approached jesus he said lord i believe
[1:59:57] but help my unbelief amen and that's my
[2:00:00] prayer god help my
[2:00:01] unbelief help me to just just to doubt
[2:00:05] my doubts help me to believe god
[2:00:08] and to only
[2:00:13] brother branham makes a statement here
[2:00:14] in the message god perfecting his church
[2:00:20] see how the devil robs you
[2:00:24] says oh you can't do this and all things
[2:00:26] are possible to them that believe
[2:00:28] no matter what it is you're a part of
[2:00:30] deity
[2:00:32] she said don't let the devil rob you
[2:00:34] says you're part of deity
[2:00:36] son or daughter not a servant a son or
[2:00:38] daughter he goes on he says why brother
[2:00:40] it surpasses all angels archangels and
[2:00:44] everything else it becomes
[2:00:45] right into the presence of the potter
[2:00:47] himself
[2:00:48] and how are we brought through the blood
[2:00:51] amen then you come into
[2:00:52] deity you become a part you're welded
[2:00:56] in amen amen
[2:01:00] he says let's think of god unfolding
[2:01:03] around him now
[2:01:04] we're going to enlarge it billions of
[2:01:05] times from this blood cell and there god
[2:01:07] and his blood cell
[2:01:08] folded himself up and wrapped himself in
[2:01:10] this blood cell
[2:01:11] and come to redeem man to life
[2:01:13] hallelujah then when the blood cells
[2:01:15] spread out spread out and brought the
[2:01:17] body of christ jesus
[2:01:18] jehovah himself was tabernacled in him
[2:01:20] that through the bursting
[2:01:22] of that blood cell at calvary might
[2:01:25] bring
[2:01:26] sons and daughters to himself
[2:01:29] the blood cell to the blood of the lord
[2:01:33] jesus christ
[2:01:34] into himself and we become
[2:01:37] part of god amen
[2:01:40] i told you i didn't hear that in my
[2:01:41] baptist church i didn't hear that in my
[2:01:44] pentecostal church
[2:01:45] i only heard things like that in this
[2:01:46] message
[2:01:48] we become part of
[2:01:51] god amen and look at what the prophets
[2:01:54] say after he makes that statement he
[2:01:55] says
[2:01:56] that's what makes satan mad
[2:02:00] amen it says that's what shakes him when
[2:02:03] the church
[2:02:04] of jesus christ only knew who they were
[2:02:07] brother oh you say i
[2:02:08] know there is nothing impossible with
[2:02:10] god i
[2:02:11] know there's nothing impossible god he
[2:02:13] said he said there's nothing impossible
[2:02:15] to you
[2:02:16] amen amen that
[2:02:19] changes the subject
[2:02:23] amen and if we just spend a little bit
[2:02:24] more time on on what the new subject is
[2:02:27] that there's nothing impossible to you
[2:02:32] see in mary's situation said there was
[2:02:34] nothing impossible with god but in this
[2:02:36] situation where
[2:02:37] jesus was casting out this devil he told
[2:02:39] them there's nothing impossible
[2:02:41] to you brother branham say that change
[2:02:44] is the subject yeah
[2:02:47] recently we were on a minister's call
[2:02:49] and i mean uh one of the morning calls
[2:02:51] and
[2:02:52] brother eugene braun made a statement he
[2:02:54] says you know typically when we're
[2:02:55] preaching now
[2:02:56] because of how brother branham brought
[2:02:57] the message to us he says typically you
[2:02:59] know there's there's three things that
[2:03:01] god was trying to do says he was trying
[2:03:02] to reveal himself to the
[2:03:03] his people threefold mystery of god is
[2:03:05] then he was trying to
[2:03:06] um you know have the preeminence in his
[2:03:09] people
[2:03:10] yeah and then he was trying to restore
[2:03:11] us back to eating conditions again these
[2:03:13] were the three things god's trying to do
[2:03:14] he said in most sermons that you're
[2:03:16] going to hear from now on
[2:03:18] are going to be sermons that deal with
[2:03:20] one of those three things
[2:03:24] this is just where we're at church this
[2:03:26] just we're at you're going to hear this
[2:03:28] until we get into that place where we're
[2:03:29] recognized
[2:03:31] who we are yeah the prophet says that's
[2:03:35] what makes satan mad
[2:03:36] that's what shakes him when the church
[2:03:38] of jesus christ only knew who they were
[2:03:39] brother or you say
[2:03:40] i know there's nothing impossible god he
[2:03:42] said there's nothing impossible to you
[2:03:44] amen that changes the subject doesn't it
[2:03:46] oh says there's nothing nothing
[2:03:47] impossible to god
[2:03:48] he said there's nothing impossible with
[2:03:51] you
[2:03:52] whatever things you desire when you
[2:03:55] pray believe you receive it and you
[2:03:58] shall have it good hallelujah
[2:04:03] i gotta read a couple more statements
[2:04:05] here this is out of the message
[2:04:06] resurrects resurrection of lazarus
[2:04:08] he says now notice then there's that's
[2:04:11] where you
[2:04:12] are that's what's the matter with you
[2:04:13] pentecostal people now
[2:04:15] i it's my lot this afternoon to preach
[2:04:17] and i have a right here at the platform
[2:04:19] and i don't never i don't ever want to
[2:04:21] know any person from the flesh
[2:04:23] when i'm standing here that's what's the
[2:04:25] matter with the pentecostal people they
[2:04:27] don't recognize
[2:04:28] who they are your sons and daughters of
[2:04:31] god
[2:04:31] you have in your hand look g then jesus
[2:04:34] uh it was one time
[2:04:35] quoting scripture ye are gods
[2:04:38] it says look deity says i'm a part of
[2:04:41] charles
[2:04:42] branham because i was born from charlie
[2:04:45] branham
[2:04:46] my daddy i'm a part of him i've got a
[2:04:48] forehead like him
[2:04:50] my hair was like him i'm a small man
[2:04:53] like him i'm in the nature
[2:04:55] like him because he's my dad and if
[2:04:58] we become in spirit sons of god
[2:05:02] deity dwells in the man hallelujah then
[2:05:06] you talk about
[2:05:07] blind eyes being open he said they said
[2:05:10] nothing
[2:05:11] impossible to god god said nothing
[2:05:14] impossible with you if you believe not
[2:05:16] with god
[2:05:17] but you deities in man
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:24] it says the very god that stood back
[2:05:25] during the mythical platform of the
[2:05:27] eternities and rolled
[2:05:28] worlds off of his hands and created
[2:05:31] these things
[2:05:32] gives you the privilege to be his son
[2:05:36] and you are part of him and god dwells
[2:05:38] in mankind and man himself is deity
[2:05:40] hallelujah there you are it might choke
[2:05:42] you but study over that a little while
[2:05:45] see god dwells in man man becomes a son
[2:05:47] of god
[2:05:48] not him in himself but the holy spirit
[2:05:50] that's in him is god
[2:05:51] the creator lives in the creation
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:56] oh my how i think of that then stand
[2:05:58] with an unwavering
[2:06:00] faith and ask what you will
[2:06:04] it'll be done unto you there he is
[2:06:07] god there he is we found where the i am
[2:06:11] is he's dwelling in those that have the
[2:06:14] baptism
[2:06:15] of the holy ghost there are some other
[2:06:18] statements i'm just going to drive this
[2:06:20] home when a spirit born
[2:06:23] spirit-filled man in faith
[2:06:26] takes the word into his heart and places
[2:06:28] it upon his lips
[2:06:30] it's the same yeah as deity speaking
[2:06:32] amen
[2:06:33] amen another the prophet also said every
[2:06:35] mountain
[2:06:36] has to go satan cannot stand
[2:06:40] before that man glory to god
[2:06:43] now i want to just slip into a little
[2:06:46] thing here
[2:06:47] there's another statement here out of
[2:06:48] the message the comforter brother
[2:06:50] branham say the word that was made flesh
[2:06:52] is talking about
[2:06:52] john 1. the word that was made flesh the
[2:06:54] word that was was god was with god and
[2:06:57] you know all that he said that word was
[2:06:58] made flesh but he also said that word
[2:07:00] has become our flesh
[2:07:05] it says all uh and who is god it says
[2:07:07] all they have to do is just speak the
[2:07:08] word not pray just speak the word
[2:07:10] that's all it says it would be done
[2:07:12] because every demon had to obey him this
[2:07:14] is when jesus came to
[2:07:16] you know the centurion's house and
[2:07:17] prayed for that servant he said he spoke
[2:07:19] spoke the word he said never even lay
[2:07:20] hands on him he spoke the word he says
[2:07:22] every demon would have to obey him
[2:07:24] do you believe that tonight he says
[2:07:25] every demon will obey god it has to
[2:07:28] amen but it didn't stop there
[2:07:33] everything obeys god
[2:07:37] and it'll obey you
[2:07:40] yes that's right if you have faith
[2:07:45] i said every demon obeys god and
[2:07:49] it will obey you yes if you have faith
[2:07:54] all right church i want to bring this to
[2:07:56] a close and
[2:07:58] i'm going to read to you a quote this is
[2:08:01] a faith for this hour you know when
[2:08:03] brother branham would preach
[2:08:05] various things and i mean like i said i
[2:08:07] didn't hear this in my denominational
[2:08:09] churches no one told me that deity was
[2:08:10] dwelling inside of me
[2:08:13] i didn't hear that come on i i mean
[2:08:15] deities in
[2:08:16] in in heaven even brother branham say

[2:08:29] recognize who we are and
[2:08:31] that that's that's why i can i can have
[2:08:33] faith to even come out at a time

[2:08:40] you know they're afraid to get out and
[2:08:41] go anywhere right now

[2:08:44] they're going to be that way for a long
[2:08:46] time
[2:08:48] you're going to be that way for a long
[2:08:49] time because every time you turn around
[2:08:50] there's something new coming out and now

[2:08:52] you're running from that you we we can't
[2:08:55] run we got to speak
[2:08:57] and move forward amen

[2:11:18] aprons and evil spirits went
[2:11:20] out of the people it wasn't because he

[2:11:25] in word and power and he never consulted
[2:11:28] the apostles but
[2:11:29] found out when they met together that

[2:13:59] how can that devil spark itself around
[2:14:01] the anointed
[2:14:02] how can the devil stand out there and
[2:14:04] squawk itself like a goliath
[2:14:06] when david coming to the campus said you
[2:14:08] mean you

[2:14:33] jesus christ
[2:14:36] now the prophet saying now you that got
[2:14:38] strength enough to yield a sword
[2:14:40] it says now that you got understanding
[2:14:42] enough in god's word
[2:14:44] to claim it to be your personal property
[2:14:47] every promise that he made you it is
[2:14:49] your personal property
[2:14:52] it says who can pick up the word of god
[2:14:55] and now in your hand hold it out in the
[2:14:58] hand of faith

[2:19:20] is exactly the truth and has been taught
[2:19:23] not only taught but proven in the age
[2:19:26] that we live in was taught to us clearly
[2:19:28] by a prophet
[2:19:30] you know i'm thinking about mary and i i
[2:19:32] never
[2:19:33] realized that brother jack how that i

[2:19:46] how's that going to work but you know
[2:19:48] something there was
[2:19:50] there was something in mary that you
[2:19:52] almost couldn't quite explain i doubt
[2:19:54] she could fully explain it to herself
[2:19:56] but son like the queen of sheba the
[2:19:58] queen of sheba just said
[2:20:00] all my heart was made i mean everything
[2:20:02] was discerned
[2:20:04] somehow the word reached down and she
[2:20:06] said it was even more than i
[2:20:07] imagined it would be he told me
[2:20:11] all my heart i think that's what
[2:20:12] happened to mary i think mary
[2:20:14] i mean listen friends that's happened to
[2:20:16] you how many can witness in here today
[2:20:18] say i heard the word of god and somehow

[2:20:24] amen to every word of god
[2:20:27] i don't know how it's going to happen i
[2:20:28] don't know what it's going to look like
[2:20:29] but i know it's true
[2:20:31] and i know i believe it said why do you

[2:20:34] well
[2:20:35] i don't know but i do amen amen

[2:20:48] this is him hallelujah
[2:20:52] wow man oh man oh man
[2:20:56] now you know i'm gonna tell you
[2:20:57] something
[2:21:00] don't don't be like don't be like moses
[2:21:02] where
[2:21:03] you know he got up under all that
[2:21:04] inspiration here you are
[2:21:06] in this church service and under all
[2:21:09] that inspiration but you know what when
[2:21:10] my when church service was over
[2:21:12] the sea was still there and it was still
[2:21:14] closed
[2:21:15] and the egyptians were still coming
[2:21:17] [Applause]
[2:21:18] and somehow after the anointing was gone
[2:21:21] and the trials were still there
[2:21:22] faith began and god said don't you cry
[2:21:25] to me
[2:21:26] you remember how you felt when you were
[2:21:28] hearing a word
[2:21:29] you remember how you felt when you were
[2:21:31] inspired to claim it
[2:21:34] so we can go forward stretch out your
[2:21:36] rod over that one
[2:21:38] hallelujah that's what this is about
[2:21:41] friends
[2:21:41] we're here to stretch a rod out over to
[2:21:44] the circumstance
[2:21:45] and speak and say give way hallelujah
[2:21:49] oh my god that that's what he that is in
[2:21:54] you is all about
[2:21:56] and you know what moses could have done
[2:21:59] that if he
[2:21:59] had if his heart would have been
[2:22:00] condemning him
[2:22:03] if moses would have still been like some
[2:22:04] of those israelites and still
[2:22:06] craving egypt he'd have never had the
[2:22:09] courage to stretch that rod out
[2:22:12] i'm gonna tell you something friends if
[2:22:13] you got a craving for egypt get that out
[2:22:15] of your heart
[2:22:16] because god can do more for you than you
[2:22:19] can ever even
[2:22:20] imagine he's here to do the impossible
[2:22:25] i just accept it i just accepted i
[2:22:28] gave up long time ago trying to make me
[2:22:31] perfect i'm just going to let him do it
[2:22:33] i'm just going to believe his word i'm
[2:22:36] going to get rid of
[2:22:37] egypt out of my life and i'm going to
[2:22:39] say now lord you take it from here
[2:22:41] hallelujah oh my god had to be the one
[2:22:45] to do it moses stretched that rod out
[2:22:47] but then a strong east wind had to blow
[2:22:48] all night
[2:22:51] and i'm looking for that that's what it
[2:22:53] means
[2:22:54] for the i am to be speaking in you
[2:22:59] you know that's what when when god told
[2:23:01] brother branham
[2:23:02] pick up your pen and write that's
[2:23:05] i mean we we were stunned i remember
[2:23:08] talking to my daddy
[2:23:09] they were stunned to have a prophet go
[2:23:11] off the scene
[2:23:13] and you mean it's not going to be him
[2:23:15] anymore it's going to be that
[2:23:17] the final voice is going to be the
[2:23:18] people it's going to be the bride yeah
[2:23:21] and the lord told him that and pick up
[2:23:24] your pen and write i went and found the
[2:23:25] quote and he says
[2:23:27] as the end time prophecies will repeat
[2:23:30] i believe as the first forerunner came
[2:23:32] that's john
[2:23:33] from the wilderness and cried behold the
[2:23:36] lamb of god
[2:23:37] the second forerunner all right now
[2:23:39] what's he going to do when he comes
[2:23:41] he's going to do the same thing by
[2:23:44] pointing the
[2:23:45] people to a word-born bride
[2:23:49] now this is god speaking brother brown
[2:23:51] said i know what i was writing until i
[2:23:52] went back and read it
[2:23:54] the bride of christ the bride of christ
[2:23:57] the prophet's gone
[2:23:58] the bride of christ will be pointing to
[2:24:01] the skies
[2:24:03] at the appearing of jesus screaming
[2:24:06] behold
[2:24:07] the lamb of god guess what the next
[2:24:10] words are
[2:24:11] the lamb of god will come forth from his
[2:24:15] lips because the i am is the one
[2:24:18] speaking
[2:24:19] and it's the i am in his bride it's
