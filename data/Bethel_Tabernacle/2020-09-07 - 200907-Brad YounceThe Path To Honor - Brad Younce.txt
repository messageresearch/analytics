TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm just happy to be here. Let's all stand together and let's have us a word of prayer. Father, we thank you for this day that you've given us, Lord. Lord, we just pray for this portion of the service, Lord, that you would come down and &gt;&gt; anoint the words, Father. May you be with the main portion of the service to sing in our brother JD. Father, as he prepares to bring us the word this morning, Lord, we come hungry. We come expecting to hear from heaven. Father, may you just be with us today. Meet our needs, Father. Lord, just be with those that's here, those that couldn't, those that's on the internet, those listen later. Father, Lord, we just pray place this part in your hand in Jesus name. Amen. I want to read in Proverbs 15:33. And I titled this the path to honor. The path to honor. Proverbs 15:33. It says, "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility." Now, God had a blessing to have your seats. So, before we can get any honor, we've got to become humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of us want success? We all want want success in our in our lives. But how do you get it? The prophet God said this. He's going to tell us if we want to be successful. So here we go. Humility is a way to success. Humility is a way to success. &gt;&gt; It don't matter how much money you pay in the tithe offering. &gt;&gt; It don't matter how much money you make. The only success that you have is being humility. is have humility. He says, "Wait on one another. Be a servant. Do service for one another. &gt;&gt; Don't be bigger than somebody else. Try and see how little you can be." You know, he says, "I often heard say, don't never be big in your own sight. If you're big, let it be God's sight. Be little in your own sight. So every man that humbles himself, God will exalt, but those who exalt themselves, God will abase. Belittle. You know, this word abase when I look at it kind of stood out to me. So I kind of had to look it up. I'm I'm still a hillbilly from Tennessee. I don't know everything. So I had to work up look up the word abase. It means to cast down, &gt;&gt; to reduce low, to humble, to degrade. Applied to passions. is rank office as condition in life. So Jesus tells over in Matthew 23:12, he says, "Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, brought down, and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted." And I found that that word humble there means exact same definition as the base. So we're going to be brought down either way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It depends on who's going to do it. &gt;&gt; It's going to be God or it's going to be you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because that's what the scripture says. He says, "Whosoever shall exalt himself to humble yourself." It's either way. You know, I like to see people who think they're better than others. I got more money than you and they acted. You could tell. You could tell people who in a church who has more money than everybody else because they'll act like it. I supposed to be teaching Sunday school. You watch what happens to them. they be brought down. So you don't have to be rich and mightymen &gt;&gt; in this world to be great in the sight of God. You only have to be humble in your own heart. And God will call that greatness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be called great this morning. He that's great enough to humble himself, that's a great person. They'll take the blame for everything. They'll humble themselves, that's greatness. Because the scripture here says, "He that will humble himself again, God will exalt, and he that exaltth himself shall be abased." How many wants to know the way up this morning? You say, "I want to know." How many wants to know the way up? The way down is up for the believer. That's why Bre said, "Humble yourself before God. Humble thyself and the Lord will lift you up. You say, "I want to be lifted up this morning." How do I do that? Humble yourself. Become low. Become like Jesus. You know, Jesus met with a lot of men in his walk in life. So, it didn't matter how many people were in church for Jesus. He preached to thousands. He preached to hundreds. He preached to 20. He even preached to one. got a lot of ministers around the message that says, "Man, there's eight people in that church. I ain't going. I can't go. If there's not a convention, I ain't preaching." Humble yourself. We say we want to be like God, do we really? &gt;&gt; We sing the song to be like Jesus. On earth, I long to be like him. I want to love like Jesus. Can you love like Jesus when you're being spit spit on your beard plucked out, made fun of, people calling you a devil? Can you really truly say, "I want to be like you, Lord." Can you humble yourself? What did Jesus do? He was God on a throne. He was being worshiped by angels day and night. Holy, holy, holy worship. Why would he want to come down to a place like this? &gt;&gt; Take up a form of a baby, walk around as a man to be made fun of, called a devil, humbled himself to show us what we need to do. We're not so great that we can't be humbled. That's what makes him great. That what makes God makes him God is because of humility. So you want to say I want to be like God become humble. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But says if you notice talking about both sides it started in Genesis religion on both sides. One was denom talking about Cain and Abel. One was denominational high-minded. The other one was unhumble walking in the spirit by revelation. You know Cain brought his offering to the Lord. It was so beautiful. He was so proud of it. He laid it up there, sat back and admired it. took his phone out, sent a picture out to the group. Man, look at my offering. Ain't this beautiful? Prideful. It's what he done. He looks over. Here comes Abel grab dragging his sacrifice up to the altar. Picked the up there and bit a rock and blood going everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abel willing to become a mess in church. &gt;&gt; What about us sometimes? Oh Lord, please don't let me act like sister soando. Don't let me act like brother to so and so. Lord, please don't make me cry. It'll mess up my makeup. I say if you wear a makeup, you it needs to be messed up. That was free. &gt;&gt; How could Abel ever know that it was a lamb instead of fruits from the field? It called it was revealed to him by divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what happened to Cain? He got mad. He got puffed up. You know because Genesis tells he's talk about how Cain his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said Cain why art thou wroth why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted? &gt;&gt; If thou doest well he was so mad at Abel because Abel caught the revelation &gt;&gt; and God accepted Abel's sacrifice. So Abel was walking in the spirit of revelation. So you know Jesus when he come to to disciples says who do men say that I am that some says Elijah you're just a prophet you're some kind of great man you're this or that. But he said who do you say that I am? Oh Peter spoke up says well thou art Christ. I mean this man Peter walked walked with Jesus. He seen Jesus's weaknesses. He's seen Jesus's frailty, but he says, "I'm not looking at a man, but I'm looking at Christ." Thou art Christ, the son of the living God. He says, "Well, flesh and blood have revealed this to you, but my father by revelation." So upon this rock, revelation, divine revelation, I'll build my church. It's divine revelation. So to get revelation, you got to be humble. So what did pride do? We know the story of Lucifer. Ezekiel 28 13 it says, "Thou hast been in the garden of God." Talk about Lucifer. "Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the barrel, the ox, the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, the carbuncle, and gold. And thy workmanships of thy tabts, and thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day thou was created. Thou art the anointed cherub, and I have set thee so and was upon the holy mountain of God. You walked in the midst of stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy ways until iniquity was found in thee. We know what that iniquity was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What happened to the devil? So therefore, I will cast thee out as profane out of the mountain of God. I will destroy thee. Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. He got prideful in what he looked like. He says, "They know that thee among the people shall be astonished at thee, and thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be anymore." So here's what Lucifer thought about himself. It was all about himself because in in Isaiah 14:12, "How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, we know brother Ram told us that was pride." Pride is what brought him down. He says, "Son of the morning, how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations, for thou hast said in thine heart." He didn't even speak it out of his mouth, but in his heart he said it was to himself. It's like, why is he up there doing Sunday school? I can do better than that. I can do a better job. Why is he that person? You got to sing all the time. I'm a better singer. Well, if you're a better singer than what we got up here, come on up here and show us. I will ascend into heaven. &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also in the mount of the congregation, the size of the north, and I will ascend my above the heights. I will be like the most high. There's his pride. It was I. I I this. Is that a humble man? You go around, you'd be talking to somebody, all you hear is I I I I might want to stay away from them. I did this. I can do this. I can do that. God's like, "Yeah, I heard you, devil. I heard what you said in your heart, but yet thou shalt be brought down to hell." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of that pride, he couldn't humble himself. You know, brother says they so-called themselves the church. They call themselves the bride. In Revelation 17 says the false bride above above Christ's little flock, the bride. He exalt himself above the humble word of God's truth by the knowledge of the revelation. Knowledge of the revelation. And has placed himself by education and theology until they got themselves up. If you don't belong to their group, then you're an outcast. It's like Lucifer did in the beginning in the Garden of Eden when he looked at Esses, surely God has said. That's exactly what they're doing today. &gt;&gt; We feed the poor. Surely he'll receive us. We're a great big beautiful church. Wow. Look at our great buildings. Look at our great memberships. We stand in millions. Surely God will not turn that group down. It's the same thing that Cain did. They brought in their pretty He brought in his pretty fruits from the ground that he had tilled and toiled and brought in the fruit and rejected the humble blood of the lamb. God have mercy. God have mercy. &gt;&gt; So we have so much confusion. Why we have so many denominations? We have so many follow rel different religions even in our own message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So much confusion. one believe in this and one believe in that. You get some great man rise up and says it's we got a two soul doctrine and they raise up and they have a great following and they fall down. They were lifted up. They were brought down. They don't have many people following. It's move after move like that. We got this greatest move going on right now among the message. A lot of people are flocking to it. But watch it in a few years. It'll nose dive. If it's really truth, it'll stay. &gt;&gt; Amen. This people hasn't been revelated. They're looking to some man for a leader because the spiritual revealed truth has to come through God alone &gt;&gt; because this word is hidden from the wise and prudent. That's what Matthew 11:25 says. At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed it unto babes. How many babies do we have today? God said so. How many babies do we have today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't see but two, three hands go up. &gt;&gt; God said, okay, here's brother Brandham. He reveals it to babies. Such shall learn. So be a baby. &gt;&gt; What do you do with babies? You teach them how to talk. Say mama. Say daddy. You grab their hand. You say, "Okay, let's walk. Come on, let's do it." I thought it was cute. Just went last Wednesday or whatever night it was. Brother Caleb come in with his little boy and I was like, "Why is Caleb standing there?" I look, here's this little baby just walk trying to walk. It was the cutest thing. He was teaching him to walk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He teaches the babies. That's what we did. We teach our babies how to do these things. That's what God, treat me like a baby. Feed me, Lord, like a baby. Let me walk around. Teach me to walk like you, God. Talk like you. Humble yourself and say, "Oh, God, here I am. Just make yourself known to me. I love you." God will reveal himself to you. He will make himself known. But it takes the simplicity of believing God to make his word. speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. It takes a humble heart dedicated to God and bring Jesus into present tense. If it took theology, we'd be all be lost. If we had to get if we had to be a B Presbyterian, a Baptist, a Catholic, and so forth, us unlearned people wouldn't even have a chance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't take the knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people's got a lot of knowledge. There's a lot of people can take this Bible and study and preach you a good sermon, but all they got is knowledge. They don't have what the revelation means. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take knowledge. It's not by how much we know because Zechariah 4:6 and 7 says, "Not by power or by might, but my spirit." Amen. &gt;&gt; Sayaith God, I will unfold this mystery. It is I that's going to give you the revelation. It's not you giving it to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we need to get out of our mind that it's all us. &gt;&gt; It's all about you. I'm smart. I can read. I can study. I can understand. I can tell you what the scriptures mean. I I I I &gt;&gt; Well, well, we heard that before. It's not by power. It's not by might. It's not how great you are. What happens at the end of it? He'll come forth crying grace and grace with shoutings and cryins. That's what it takes today. It's God's amazing grace to the people. &gt;&gt; How he takes the illiterate, the unlearned and shows that Jesus is the same. And he will even take the foolish of preaching to do it. It seems like it's so hard for people to humble themselves to the word of God. You'll find it when you're talking you women to girls saying it's about wearing long hair. Why you got your hair long? Why do you wear skirts down long? You go talking to them. They kind of give you the shoulder. You know that's right. If there's any lady in them, he said they know that's right. But you see, they can't humble themselves to it. Well, he'll make me look like a plain Jane. Well, who cares? That's what Cain, how did Cain do it? He couldn't humble himself to the vindicated word of God. He couldn't do it. I can't bring an offering like that. I'm going to get blood all over me. You'll say, "Well, glory to God. Hallelujah. I cut my hair and I speak in tongues." That shows right there something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "What does this got to do with humility?" It's obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you It seems so hard to humble to God's word. Says, "Let God just bless a fella and put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a knowit all. He'll go start an organization or he's got to do something that's different. He don't like the same old same old. He wants to start a different religion. God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place till God calls him to do something. But we want to hurry it. We want to hurry God alone. A man that God can bless and he'll and still keep himself a man and know he's not an angel or a God. But as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him, he wants to become God. He wants to become an angel. Just like Lucifer, me, it's me and me in mine. All that, that's the wrong attitude. God is hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out his blessings. And the more he blessed, the littleler the man will become. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never get more of God until you become nothing. &gt;&gt; How many nothings do we have? You got to belittle yourself. He that will exalt himself, God will bring a base. And he that will humble himself, God is going to exalt you. You've got to get little before you can get big. And you'll never be big in your own self. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll only be as big as God is big in you. You say, "You're reading a lot of quotes." Yeah, I like them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's talking about he had a privilege of meeting some some a lot of men. He said the people's got more pride is those people that got 50 cents in their pocket and they walk around like they're they're it. They got more pride than the rich people got. He said, "I've seen," he said, "I've been with great men. got these old sleeves and cuffs and they make you think you're they make you think you're a great person. &gt;&gt; Greatness is humility. Don't forget it. He says greatness is expressed in humility. Isaiah 57:15 says, "For thus set the high and the lofty one that inhabitth eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit. So he said, "I'm going to abide with you those as humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones." He's I don't mean dirty now. I mean humble in spirit. I don't mean just get out and go wash and clean up. I'm talking about humility. &gt;&gt; Genuine humility. That's not a put on. You've seen a lot of people fake humility. &gt;&gt; I'm humble. You see, you know what I'm talking about. Put the word of God in your heart. Let the Holy Spirit come and watch the word move. Believe. Be humble. Don't desire to be something great. A humble, submitted heart in simplicity is what God is what brings you to God. A humble heart God loves. God dwells in a human heart, not in education. God dwell in your heart. And the lower you can break yourself down, the more simple you can become greater in the sight of God. I'm running out of time. I want to read this. Wow. I want to read this prayer. I'll stop with this prayer that Brother Ram did. He says, "Father God, keep these in your hands. They're yours. I pray God that we'll always walk humble before you. We don't know how long. We don't deserve to know how long. It's not our business. That's your business. It's not our wills to know when you will come. It's our It's our will, Lord, to keep humble till you do come &gt;&gt; walk with you. It's our desire for you just to let yourself be known once in a while, Father, among us, that we can see that we're still walking with you. Forgive us of our past sins. Guide us, protect us from every snare of the devil for the future. Lead us and guide us, oh God, our father. Forgive our sins, and help us to be your children. We're a poor class of people. were outcast by the societies of the world, by the denominations of the churches. We see the end. We thank thee for spiritual eyesight into thy word to see the end time. For all these things must come to the great stoning from heaven. Help us, Lord, not to be here at that day, but to be gone into your presence to fly away into your bosom. Amen. God bless you.
