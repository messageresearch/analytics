========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you this morning. Good to be back in church, back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gather gathered together. Been missing. love what we did with the camp, but just been missing being in church. Amen. All right, if you just stand with me, we're gonna go ahead and turn into our Bibles. We're going to catch two portions of scripture this morning. We're going to start in Genesis 3. We're going to just catch one verse and then we're going to go all the way to the other side in 1 John. Genesis chapter 3 and verses 8. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And then if you turn to First John chapter 1, 1 John chapter 1 and then verses 5 through7, we're going to just catch this. Then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and we do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all sins. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Our heavenly father, we just thank you for this opportunity to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Father, we just pray that you just open up the word to us in this little lesson this morning. Father, speak to our hearts. Lord, prepare our hearts this morning for the ministering of the word. Lord God, help us just to worship, Father God, the way that you've intended it to be, Father, in spirit and in truth. We love you. We just commit all these things to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God bless you this morning. Take your seats. Um, this little thought this morning is just uh I'm going to title it darkness with a subtitle of a disruption of harmony. Amen. Darkness with a disruption of harmony. I was looking at that passage there in Genesis and one thing that you can really begin to recognize is that you know of course that in the garden there there was a complete heart a harmony between God, between Adam, between Adam, between Eve. There was a perfect order before this event took place. There was just a harmony between everything. And then there was this disruption that occurred. There was a disruption in harmony. And the Lord's just been dealing with me on this subject, harmony, lately that, you know, there was a harmony with the word. There was a harmony with each other. And uh and the idea that he wants us to get back into is he wants us to get back into that harmony. Amen. Brother Benham said in the church age book that there was a harmony between God and the son. There was a harmony between Jesus and the father. And that same harmony is now is supposed to now exist between the bride and her groom. Right? Amen. And so when I'm talking this morning about darkness, don't let your minds trail off a into thinking that it's some kind of great sin or or great some big big thing in your life. Darkness is anything that keeps you out of harmony with our father. Anything that has the potential to disrupt that harmony that we're supposed to have with our bridegroom. That's what I'm talking about this morning. The Bible says it like this. Search me, oh God. Know my heart and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me. Any wicked way. Something in the garden had come in between these intimate relationships. The word calls it the tree of knowledge. Amen. And when Eve parttook of that first sin, God referred to it as a tree or the tree of knowledge. Uh because or the tree of life, the other side because it was it wasn't just one act of sin. It wasn't just one isolated incident. It was um you know was the act of idolatry uh adultery and it was that. But it was a fruitbearing tree because it wasn't just that. It was something that produced havoc in the garden that produced havoc in their lives, right? And that's what sin is. Brother Brandham always says that smoking and drinking and all those things, those are attributes of sin. But it's not necessarily sin. Those are just the attributes of sin. The devil isn't necessarily going to try to get you to commit adultery like he did with Eve. But what he will do is he's going to implant thoughts in your mind that are designed to disrupt disrupt your fellowship and your harmony with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's an important point. I want to repeat that. He isn't going to implant thoughts in your mind that are designed he he is going to implant thoughts in your mind that are designed to disrupt your fellowship and your harmony with God. He he tries to impregnate those things in your mind. And then what happens is eventually those thoughts manifest into your actions. Eve lost that battle in her mind, in her thoughts before it ever became an act of adultery. Amen. And by the time that it was actually acted out in her life, it it wre havoc in the garden. It wre havoc in their life. It wre havoc. And I was reading this book and you know there's so many things that you know that that they had to deal with after that fall that they never even had they didn't have an understanding of. You know there was a there was envy that that came in. There was a shame that came in. There were these thoughts of of possible jealousy that came in. They didn't have to deal with those things before. And all of that was because of the action the fruit bearing uh the the the bearing of the fruit of that sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those thoughts that he tries to implant in your mind, they become idols that you begin serving. You can serve him in your time. You can serve him in your entertainment, in your lack, and it becomes a lack of fellowship with God. Idols are just anything that you put in the place of serving God. &gt;&gt; You know, people can actually be serving idols in their mind and they may not even be realizing it because what happens is is those thoughts that come from the enemy, they come from Satan. thoughts of enemy, envy, thoughts against people, thoughts of discontent. We feed those thoughts and by the time that it actually manifests in your actions, then you've already lost the battle because you lost it in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was reading this book I was reading from. I'm going to quote it several times. And it was talking about on the long lines of this subject. It talked about the effects of that first sin. And one of the first effects of that sin that we read here was that it made Adam and Eve hide behind the trees. You know, they were hiding in these dark places. There had always been a transparency and a harmony with God and one another. There was never any reason to hide, right? But see, when darkness had crept in, something had changed. And there was this feeling in them that they wanted to hide. They were ashamed. They recognized their nakedness. And the Bible says it in a distinct way. It says that they were hiding themselves from the presence of the Lord God because you know and one of the things that it still does today and it did then is once that darkness crept into their heart, it tried to get them to cover themselves to somehow cover the sin that they committed or to cover the wrongdoing. And that's what human nature God is. God is showing us the human nature side of things is if when we're fall when we're in of a fallen nature, we follow after that pattern of our parents. We follow after that pattern. We try to hide ourselves. We try to cover that thing. We have things that happen in our lives. And God wants transparency in our life. He wants you to be transparent with him. He already knows what you're going through. He already knows the things that you're dealing with. He wants you to be transparent with him so that light can shine in that darkness. Amen. Because anything that keeps you out of harmony with your father is darkness. So if there's anything in your heart, anything in your mind that you haven't allowed the light of the Lord to shine on in your life, it's a disruption in your life with the Lord. And we shouldn't want anything. Amen. We shouldn't want anything to disrupt that. And there was a there was a pattern that Adam and Eve had set and they tried to cover themselves. And I just I thought it was important to realize that that when something does happen in your life, you make a mistake. You probably made some today. I know I probably made some today. You made some yesterday. You slip up. You do some kind of wrong. Those things are going to happen. Amen. We do have the flesh that we're supposed to bring into subjection to the Holy Ghost that lives in our souls, right? We're supposed to bring that thing into subjection, but it does slip up. &gt;&gt; And what we've got to do is we've got to fight against our own human nature in that. Amen. And it's the battle that happens within to not keep that thing hidden in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To not keep that thing hidden in your heart. We have to fight against that nature. Transparency just by definition this morning, it it's the quality of allowing light to pass through so that objects behind can be distinctly seen. So again, God wants us to be transparent so that darkness can be exposed. And the only way to expel darkness and get rid of it is to expose light to it. And um I'm we're going to read a couple passages of scripture here this morning. Um let's see, let's go to First John. We're going to actually start at verse three and then read all of those. First John chapter 1 and it and we'll start at verse three. And if you read the heading in my Bible, uh uh in the my King James study Bible, you'll read above the verse and it actually says in parenthesis, it says the conditions of fellowship. And then underneath that, it says the walk in the light. So we're talking about the disruption of harmony. And verse three, it says that which we have seen and declare unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us. and truly our fellowship is with the father and his son Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And these things we write unto you that your joy may be full. This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and we do not the truth. So verse six, if we say that we're in fellowship with the father, lie, we do not the truth. Lying isn't always as surface level as people make it out to be. You can lie to yourself. You can, and we're going to get that into this next verse. You can actually deceive yourself into thinking that you're in right standing with the Lord somehow and you're lying to yourself because there's something in your heart that still hasn't the light still hasn't shined in on that place. And we don't want to lie to ourselves. We don't want to have a disruption in our harmony with the father. Amen. And we'll catch that in verse eight. says, "If we say that we um if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us." Now, there's there's a there's a a balance here because, you know, we have to make sure to know that in order for the light to be living in us, we've got to have the the Holy Ghost living in our soul. But then what happens is sometimes darkness can creep into our flesh or into our spirit. And so we have to allow the light of the Lord, God is light, it says, right? So God lives in our soul to allow that light to shine into those dark places to shine into those places in our life, to shine into areas of our spirit and our flesh that may not be under complete subjection yet to the Holy Ghost. Because the idea is that we need to get into complete subjection to the Holy Ghost. Amen. That's what I want in my life. Amen. And so in reality, there might be some darkness that that is residing in us that that we're that we're keeping that area in our height our hearts away from the light, away from exposure to the light. Amen. Um verse 9, it says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. I I had see read this statement the other day. I thought it was just powerful. It says, "What is meant by light and darkness is that light reveals and darkness hides." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there in that uh we're going to catch Ephesians a couple verses in Ephesians and it says that when anything reproves us, King James uses the word reprove which means convicts and exposes fault. So when anything reproves us or convicts us or exposes fault in our life, it shows us what we really are and that is light. Does that make sense? When anything reproves us, so when the Lord brings conviction in our life and it doesn't matter if it's a big thing or a small thing, whatever he brings conviction, it's supposed to expose fault in our life and it shows us what we really are and it's supposed to not keep us there. We we don't want to stay in that place when he exposes that thing. We want to move further. We I want to I want to grow. He talked about the mountain of God. We want to continue to ascend to the place that the Lord wants us to be in. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to um it quotes Ephesians 5, this excerpt that I read. So, we're going to go let's turn in our Bibles to Ephesians. We're doing a Bible study this morning. So, gonna do some verses. Ephesians chapter 5 and um catch this in a second. It says in this in this we're going to start at verses 8 and before we start reading that just a comment that it makes it whatsoever doth make manifest as light which is what we're going to read in there but whenever we say or do anything or in contrast to that whenever we don't say or don't do something and the objective behind that is to hide what we've done or what we haven't done to correct that error. That is darkness. So that brings it down to us today in the the the flesh man that we live in. If we say or do something that covers us like it did Eve, that it that it exposes that nature and we don't want it to, then that is darkness. Or if in in contra distinction to that in the opposite if we don't say or we don't do something that is going to keep that thing hidden in your heart that is darkness. So these are just applicable points this morning. If we look at verses um verses 8 in Ephesians 5 for ye were sometimes darkness but now ye are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light, for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And we have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather we do what? We rather reprove them. So, we're not supposed to have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but what what are we supposed to do? We're supposed to expose those areas in our life. We're supposed to expose those areas that may be uncomfortable to expose. It may not feel good to say, "Lord, I'm wrong." It may not feel good to say, "Lord, I did have that thought, but I want to bring that thing into subjection." Because a lot of times the enemy brings implants thoughts into your mind. They're not your thoughts. They're the enemy's thoughts. So, it's our job as believers to take that thing, recognize that it's not the word, that's not you, that's the enemy. You put that thing into subjection. But sometimes what happens is if you keep feeding that thought, Lord, I that's not me, right? No, that is not you. You put that thing into subjection. Amen. But sometimes what the devil will do is then he'll bring another thought and say, "Well, I can't believe you'd think like that. I can't believe you do that. I I can't I thought you were a believer. I thought you were a Christian." And you're saying that and you're doing that. That is the enemy in your mind. You bring that thing. You expose that darkness. You say, "Devil, that wasn't me. That was you. Lord, I know you know that that wasn't me. If it was me, Lord, forgive me. Forgive me of that thing and help me move on. Expose that darkness in your heart." Amen. &gt;&gt; Reproving something. What does that mean? H how do how do we go about doing that? It it's it's a it's a repentant heart. Repentant heart. The the the I mean the the the start of salvation is repentance. You have to have a repentant heart. You know, you have to be able to come to the Lord and say that I Lord, I forgive me of these things. I I I know I've been wrong. And then the Lord is faithful and just to cleanse you of that unrighteousness. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so being in right standing with God is a heart that and I had done this. I I always go back to this because I I love this when when I did the Sunday school on angles and that story that that brother Random tells about that that man that uh there's this sculpture and you look at the sculpture headon or when you're looking at it and Jesus is in front of you, you don't always see the fullness of the picture. You don't always see what he's done for you. You don't always see it, but the sculptor knew that. And so he put a little kneeling uh uh uh table right in front of it. And so when you kneel down and you look up at Jesus, you're able to see the blood that he shed for you. You're able to see the scars. It it it you couldn't but come to tears because it was the angle at which you're looking at it. And when you come to the Lord with a humble heart and you and you expose yourself and you recognize that you're down here, God's up here, and you look up to him, that is what true repentance looks like. That is what humility looks like. &gt;&gt; Is recognizing my faults, repenting of those things, and then exposing the darkness in my heart and allowing the light to be made manifest. And this is a continual process that has to happen in our lives. It's not just you do it one time. You know, repentance is is an everyday act that we have to come into. We bring our bodies and our spirit into subjection to the Lord. Amen. Spurgeon defines it as defines walking in the light as and this is powerful the willingness to know and to be known. So think of that for a minute. the willingness. Walking in the light is the willingness to know who I am, the thoughts that I've thought, and to be known to be able to expose yourself to to the Lord. And if you have a wrong that you've done against a brother or sister, expose that thing to them as well because walking in the light, I mean, the first John, you know, it talks about having fellowship not only with God, but having fellowship with one another. I I've been this is a kind of a sermon I'm working on, but talking about the harmony that the Lord has. He has it with with us. We're supposed to be in harmony with the Lord, right? We're supposed to be in harmony with our groom. And that also is a harmony that we're supposed to have with with the bride because Christ is in you. Christ is in you. Christ is in you. Christ is in me. So, as we get closer to Christ, we should be able to have a harmony with one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it means that we are to open uh to we are open to know the whole truth about ourselves because because God knows the whole truth about us. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He knows the whole truth about you. He knows the mistake you made yesterday. He knows the wrongs that you've done. He knows the thoughts. I mean, he knows all of it. He knows that. Now, he's waiting for you to reprove those things. He's waiting for you to expose those things. He won't press you. He won't make you do it, but he he'll convict you. He He He'll do that. And then the more that still small voice in your heart, the more you do that thing, and I'm going to hopefully I can get to this. Um sorry, I keep trailing off. Let me just stick to my notes here. Um sometimes we can get into a state like Eve was in where we would rather have that thing hidden and maybe justify it somehow. you know, try to try to produce a covering, try to try to because it, you know, it seems easier that way sometimes or or you know, we're sometimes we're we're we're nervous, we're afraid, we're whatever the case is, it's just easier in our human nature to do that. But what God wants is he wants that thing to be exposed. Um, and just think of think of your just put these some of these notes I wrote. Think of your heart as the garden this morning. He knows that there are things that are hidden and he calls out to you. You know that next verse, he's calling out to them. And it's not that he didn't know, pastor was saying this, brother Matt was saying this um in his Sunday school. It's not that he didn't know where they were. It's it's that he wanted he he didn't he didn't know how they got to where they were. Why Why did you How did you get to this place? How did you get We were in such harmony with one another. We were we were in there was such a cohesion. There was such a There was What? How did this disruption occur? He was calling out. So, there's got to be exposure and transparency so his light can expose those things. Um, and remember, I had said this at the beginning. Don't think of darkness as just being the evil things, you know, just terrible evil things. It is that, but it can also be more subtle than that. It's just anything that or anywhere that the light is not shining on in your life. Anything that's causing that disruption. And some of these statements, I wanted to try to read these statements because I thought they were so powerful from this excerpt of this book. It's called the Calvary Road. The first effect of sin in our lives is always to try is always to make us try and hide what we are. Sin made our fir first parents hide behind the trees of the garden and it has the same effect on us ever since. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Catch this. He says, "Sin always involves us in being unreal, pretending, duplicity." I wanted to speak on that word for just a minute. Duplicity means deceitfulness or being twofaced. Acting one way when you're at church and another way when you're at work, acting one way when you're at church and another way when you're at home. What What does your life look like behind closed doors? I I see it when you're at church, but what about when you get behind the door? What What about in your private life? What does your life look like &gt;&gt; to the Lord there? What is there a harmony that you have with the Lord in your private life? Amen. I know that really that that really cuts home today. But that's where the Lord wants to get to. He wants to get into that secret compartment in your heart and fellowship with you there. Of course, he's going to fellowship with you there. He's going to bring conviction of the word here. He's going to do those things here. But what are you doing? Are you two-faced? Is there duplicity in your life? Or are you being unreal? I mean, because coming to church and have putting on a show, that's unreal. I mean, it, you know, it doesn't affect me. It may it may affect your brother. I mean, it may. It may, but it doesn't have a monumental effect on me. It has a monumental effect on you and your harmony to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It involves excusing ourselves and blaming others. That's a big one. And we can all do that as much by our silence as by saying or doing something. &gt;&gt; It involves excusing ourselves and blaming others. There is always I think I put this statement. I hope I did. There is always going to be I guess I I I didn't put it in there. There is always going to be someone to blame for what you've done wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's always you can always justify it. There's always going to be but what about putting your finger back and Lord you know maybe they did say this but the introspection that happens in yourself in your life how can I grow from this you know pointing your finger back at this guy right the willingness to know and be known and as far as as far as God is concerned this means that we are willing to know the whole truth about ourselves &gt;&gt; we are open to conviction. And catch this, this is powerful. Everything that he shows us to be sin, we will deal with as sin, we will hide or excuse nothing. You know, I there's a balance there. You can't, you know, it's not a legalism, okay? It's not it's not it's not a legalistic view of things. But when the Lord is exposing things in your life, maybe from the outside someone might say, "Well, whoa, they're making a lot of changes." But look, you're in harmony with the father and he is trying to get you to the place that you need to be. Amen. He's trying to convict you in your heart. And what happens the closer you get to that fire, I talked about this in the service, the closer you get to that pillar of fire, the more things that are burned away from you that you don't want. Brother uh Paul talks about that all things are expedient. That has meant so much more to me lately because all things can be expedient. You can have things in your life that are harmless, but if there's a disruption in your harmony with the father because of that thing, then I don't want it in my life anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought that part was just so good. Such a walk in the light cannot but disclose sin increasingly in our lives. And we shall see things to be sin which we never thought to be such before. &gt;&gt; Right? because it's a disruption in harmony. And for this reason, this is my last last statement here. And for this reason, we might shrink from this walk and be tempted to make for cover. I don't want to shrink from that walk. I don't want to Are we willing to have that kind of walk with the Lord? Amen. But the first goes on to say, "And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all sin." And it goes on to say that everything that the light of God shows us of as sin, we confess and carry it to the fountain of blood and it's gone. Gone from God's sight and gone from our hearts. Once that light can expose that thing, it's gone from God's sight. It's gone from our hearts forever. Amen. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just thank you for this morning. We thank you for the word, Lord. We just ask that you just come and minister to our our hearts through the uh the ministry of uh of worship this morning as we just prepare our hearts to receive your word. May you just be with uh pastor as he just brings forth the word. Lord God, may you just be with us, Lord. Give us uh ears to hear, eyes to see. Father, we love you. We commit everything to you now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Amen. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
