[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] We just stand for a word of prayer.
[0:13] I think this needs batteries or
[0:15] something.
[0:16] Somebody would please.
[0:19] Hello. Testing one two.
[0:25] Thank you, brother.
[0:28] You love the Lord. You happy to be in
[0:31] the house of the Lord. Amen. God is
[0:34] good. I wanted to read Psalms
[0:37] 133. This is a Psalm of David.
[0:41] It says, "Behold, how good and how
[0:44] pleasant it is for brethren to dwell in
[0:47] unity.
[0:50] It is like the precious ointment upon
[0:52] the head that ran down upon the beard
[0:55] even Aaron's beard that went down to the
[0:58] skirts of his garments as the dew of
[1:01] Herman and as the dew that descended
[1:03] upon the mountains of Zion. For there
[1:07] the Lord commanded the blessing even
[1:10] life forever more.
[1:13] Amen.
[1:15] Does it work now? Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:18] you believe his words. Amen. Let's just
[1:22] bow our heads again. And Father, we love
[1:26] you so much. And we just thank you,
[1:28] Lord.
[1:30] I just pray, dear God, that you would
[1:32] anoint these services tonight, Lord,
[1:35] as we sing this song, Lord Jehovah Gyra.
[1:40] Lord, I just pray that it comes from the
[1:42] very depths of our souls.
[1:45] Just help us to sing your praises, Lord,
[1:48] and to lift you up and magnify your
[1:51] wonderful name, Lord. May we be able to
[1:54] feel, Lord, the wings of angels sweep
[1:57] through this place tonight, Father. May
[2:00] we each one, Lord, just with all of our
[2:03] hearts sing songs of praise unto you,
[2:06] Father. May you anoint the word in a
[2:09] special way,
[2:11] Lord. May it truly go down into the
[2:14] marorrow of the bones. And Lord, do the
[2:18] work that your word is so capable of
[2:22] doing. We love you so much, dear God,
[2:25] and appreciate everything you do for us.
[2:29] We just pray and ask these things now in
[2:31] the name of Jesus Christ, our King and
[2:33] our God.
[2:35] Amen.
[2:37] Amen.

[9:12] Aren't you glad that you hear that
[9:13] calling?
[9:15] Amen.
[9:17] Well, softly

[14:33] of F.
[14:36] Amen.
[14:39] Help
[14:41] us sing this.
[14:47] [Music]
[14:52] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[14:56] There's been times I didn't know right
[15:00] from wrong.
[15:00] You ever been there, friends?
[15:04] But in every situation
[15:07] he gave blessed consolation
[15:12] that through my child come to make me
[15:17] strong. Sing it with him now everyone.
[15:21] Through it all.
[15:25] Through it all,
[15:29] I learned to trust in Jesus.
[15:33] I learned to trust in God.
[15:38] Through it all,
[15:42] through it all,
[15:46] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[15:51] [Music]
[15:54] I've been a lot of places and I've seen
[15:59] a lot of faces and there's been times I
[16:04] felt so all alone.
[16:10] But in my lonely hours,
[16:13] those precious lonely hours,
[16:18] Jesus let me know I was his own.
[16:24] Aren't you thankful tonight? Through it
[16:27] all.
[16:30] Through it all,
[16:34] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[16:38] I've learned to trust in God.
[16:42] Through it all,
[16:46] through it all,
[16:50] we have learned to depend upon his word.
[16:56] [Music]
[16:58] I thank God for the mountains and I
[17:02] thank him for the valleys
[17:06] and I thank him for the storms he's
[17:09] brought me through.
[17:11] Oh yes. Thank you, Lord.
[17:14] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[17:19] know that he could solve it. I wouldn't
[17:23] know what faith in God can do. Oh, thank
[17:28] you, Lord.
[17:30] But through it all,
[17:34] through it all,
[17:38] I have learned to trust in Jesus.
[17:42] I've learned to trust in God.
[17:46] Through it all,
[17:50] through it all,
[17:54] I have learned to depend upon his word.
[18:00] Sing that again.
[18:02] Through it all,
[18:06] through it all,
[18:09] we have learned to trust in Jesus.
[18:14] We've learned to trust in God.
[18:18] Through it all,
[18:22] through it all,
[18:25] we have learned to depend upon his word.
[18:34] Amen. But Luther, could you come on up?
[18:36] We'll pray over the tithes and the
[18:38] offerings. Let's give him a great big
[18:40] hand clap. Praise to the Lord.
[18:43] God is good. Amen.
[18:46] God is awesome.
[18:48] Amen. Come on up, brother.
[18:53] Praise the Lord.
[18:56] Let's pray.
[18:59] Father, we are so grateful for how you
[19:01] provide for us and take care of us,
[19:03] Lord.
[19:04] And Lord, we just want to thank you for
[19:06] the bounty you give us. And Lord, with a
[19:09] cheerful heart, we want to give back to
[19:11] you that
[19:13] the blessings you've given to us, you
[19:15] will multiply so many times.
[19:18] As our brother prayed earlier, Lord, we
[19:20] pray for the gift of life that it would
[19:21] come forth. Lord, move the man aside.
[19:24] Speak to us, Father. I pray for those
[19:26] that are streaming, Lord. Those that are
[19:28] ill and those that are sick. I pray that
[19:30] you would lift them up, Father, in your
[19:32] grace. For by your stripes, we are
[19:34] healed. Father,
[19:36] remember our brother Joe this evening.
[19:38] Father, facing something in life that
[19:41] Lord would seem insurmountable. Father,
[19:45] we pray for him. Father, give him
[19:47] strength.
[19:49] Lord, we just pray for those streaming,
[19:50] those that are not able to attend the
[19:53] service this evening. Father, I pray
[19:54] that you bless them in a mighty way.
[19:56] Bless the tithes and offerings.
[19:59] I just want to thank you, Lord. I'm
[20:01] grateful for what you've done for me,
[20:02] what you're doing, and what you're going
[20:04] to do, committing myself into your hands
[20:07] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[20:12] Praise the Lord, saints. You can be
[20:14] seated. I don't want anybody to forget.
[20:17] You know, if you have change in your
[20:18] pocket, anything, anything at all, just
[20:21] remember to drop it in that building
[20:23] fund thing back there, just in case you
[20:25] forgot.
[20:27] I don't know if all y'all were here when
[20:29] we talked about that building fund, but
[20:32] if we would all just give a dollar every
[20:34] time we came in here, I know that we
[20:37] spend $2 or three dollars at least once
[20:39] a day at the gas station and the grocery
[20:42] store, we get that building fund rolling
[20:44] along. Just wanted to remind everybody
[20:50] when he told you you're not good enough.
[20:54] When he told you you're not right.
[20:58] When he told you you're not strong
[21:01] enough to put up a good fight.
[21:06] When he told you you're not worthy.
[21:10] When he told you you're not loved.
[21:14] When he told you you're not beautiful,
[21:19] you'll never be enough.
[21:23] Fear
[21:26] is liar.
[21:31] He will take your breath,
[21:34] stop you in your steps.
[21:40] serious
[21:42] [Music]
[21:44] liar.
[21:47] He will rob your rest and steal your
[21:52] happiness.
[21:55] So cast your fears
[21:59] in the fire
[22:04] cuz fear
[22:07] he is a liar.
[22:24] When he told you you were trouble,
[22:28] you'll never be alone.
[22:33] He told you you should run away. You'll
[22:37] never find a home.
[22:40] When he told you you were dirty
[22:45] and you should be ashamed.
[22:49] When he told you you could be the one,
[22:53] the grace can never change. Oh, fear.
[23:00] He is a liar.
[23:04] He will take your breath,
[23:08] stop you in your steps.
[23:13] Fear
[23:16] is liar.
[23:21] He will rob your rest,
[23:24] steal your happiness
[23:28] and cast your fears
[23:33] in the fire.
[23:34] [Music]
[23:37] Because here
[23:40] he is a liar.
[23:45] Let your fire fall and cast down all my
[23:49] fear.
[23:53] Let your fire fall. Your love is all I
[24:01] let your fire fall and cast down all my
[24:05] fears.
[24:09] Let your fire fall your love is all I
[24:13] feel
[24:18] fearous
[24:22] liar.
[24:23] [Music]
[24:25] He will take your breath.
[24:29] Stop you in your step.
[24:34] Fear
[24:36] is liar.
[24:41] He will of your rest and steal your
[24:46] happiness.
[24:48] So cast your fears
[24:53] in the fire. Cuz
[24:57] fear
[25:00] he is a liar.
[25:05] Cuz fear
[25:08] is a liar.
[25:10] [Music]
[25:16] Praise the Lord. We have another special
[25:19] tonight.
[25:21] Amen. Aren't you thankful for those that
[25:23] want to sing?
[25:25] I know Sister Lana and I have another
[25:28] special soon, one of these days.
[25:31] I know that she wants to sing again. So,
[25:34] we'll do that soon. I promise. Hi,
[25:37] sweetheart.
[25:39] [Music]
[25:53] [Music]
[25:58] I heard the song tonight.
[26:01] Just pray it's a blessing to you like it
[26:03] was to me.
[26:14] [Music]
[26:26] Oh, some are known by great authority,
[26:31] [Music]
[26:34] for kingdoms as far as eyes can see.
[26:43] In royal robes they rule from thrones.
[26:47] Waging wars they overthrow the weak
[26:55] and call it victory.
[26:59] When my king is known
[27:02] by mercy,

[27:48] [Music]
[27:56] I can almost see him even now.
[28:04] injected with thorns upon
[28:08] his brow.
[28:11] Oh, what kind of king would leave his
[28:15] throne and make my sin and shame his
[28:19] own.
[28:23] But he gave his life for me.
[28:27] Oh, he gave his life for me.

[31:42] think it did. And so we're happy in the
[31:45] Lord for that. We're going to invite you
[31:48] uh into the scripture right away this
[31:50] evening to Revelation chapter 4.

[32:39] conclude this ninth part should conclude
[32:41] if I can get through it all uh should
[32:44] conclude this side of the series which
[32:47] is modern events are again made clear in
[32:50] prophecy. And so uh I want to go Sunday
[32:54] with future events made clear in
[32:57] prophecy. So, amen. That'll actually be
[32:59] um I don't know how the booth will
[33:01] handle that. They'll either call it part
[33:02] 10 and change the title or they'll
[33:04] figure it out. I'll leave that with
[33:05] them. Amen. We're going to look at
[33:08] Revelation chapter 4. Amen. Verse one.
[33:14] After this, I looked, and behold, a door
[33:17] was opened in heaven. The first voice
[33:20] which I heard was as it were of a
[33:22] trumpet talking with me, which said,
[33:25] "Come up hither, and I will show thee
[33:28] things which must be hereafter."
[33:31] Immediately I was in the spirit, and
[33:33] behold, a throne was set in heaven, and
[33:36] one sat on the throne. And he that sat
[33:39] was to look upon like a jasper and
[33:41] sardan stone. And there was a rainbow
[33:44] round about the throne in sight like
[33:46] unto an emerald. And round about the
[33:49] throne were four and 20 seats. And upon
[33:52] the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[33:54] sitting clothed in white raignment. And
[33:57] they had on their heads crowns of gold.
[34:00] And out of the throne proceeded
[34:01] lightnings and thunderings and voices.
[34:04] And there were seven lamps of fire
[34:07] burning before the throne, which are the
[34:09] seven spirits of God. Amen. Let's bow
[34:13] our heads.
[34:15] Father, we thank you for your word
[34:17] tonight. And Lord, now we've come to
[34:19] that allimportant part. And I just
[34:21] humble myself in your presence. And I
[34:24] turn my mind now to this material which
[34:26] you laid upon my heart so strongly,
[34:29] Lord. and I'm just ready now to try to
[34:31] deliver the burden of the word upon my
[34:34] heart to the people. I commit myself
[34:37] into your hands to this end. May you
[34:39] grant it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[34:42] you friends. You can be seated.
[35:08] Amen. So we are continuing tonight
[35:11] speaking of modern events are again made
[35:15] clear in prophecy. Um,
[35:19] stand by, brother Mark. Not just don't
[35:21] put that up just yet. Uh, let let us
[35:23] wait till I make some opening comments
[35:25] here. Amen. Otherwise, people will start
[35:28] reading ahead of me and get distracted.
[35:29] Amen. You're going to hear that in just
[35:31] a moment. You got about eight quality
[35:33] minutes.
[35:33] Amen.
[35:34] Amen. Amen. I'm going to I'm going to
[35:36] play you a sound bite from this sermon.
[35:39] It's just about 8 minutes and 20 seconds
[35:41] long. And I'm going to play it right at
[35:43] the beginning because I want to enlarge
[35:44] upon it. And uh I can tell you
[35:47] something. It is so valuable, has proven
[35:48] so valuable to me that if you only get
[35:51] this eight minutes and suddenly you look
[35:53] at your watch and have to leave, you'll
[35:54] still be benefited. Amen. I hope you
[35:57] don't do that. But uh if you do, you'd
[35:59] be you'd be as benefited in the in those
[36:01] eight eight plus minutes as you will
[36:04] Amen. in my entire hour and a half
[36:06] sermon tonight.
[36:08] Amen.
[36:12] No, I won't I honestly won't do that.
[36:14] We'll we'll go just a little bit after
[36:16] uh this quote, but the I want to kind of
[36:19] uh give you just a little bit of
[36:20] background as we lead into it and then
[36:23] I've got uh a statement I want to read.
[36:25] Uh and we're going to take our
[36:27] PowerPoint here in just in a moment.
[36:28] Now, the fourth chapter of the book of
[36:31] Revelation is so important because this
[36:35] is where you are really beginning to see
[36:39] how that God's plan uh was was never for
[36:44] just a lowly Nazarene to walk the shores
[36:48] of Galilee, go about doing good. He did
[36:51] all of that, but that was never God's
[36:53] entirety of God's plan. in fact is they
[36:56] tried to you know bring it to a climax
[36:59] and make Jesus a king and they wanted
[37:01] him to restore Israel and let's get on
[37:03] with it and uh you know Jesus just had
[37:07] already laid down so much prophecy about
[37:10] how that the son of man will be betrayed
[37:12] and fall into the hands of sinners and
[37:14] be killed. There was so much spoken
[37:16] about the Messiah in the Old Testament
[37:19] suffering and and what God would do in
[37:22] future kingdoms to come. It is
[37:24] incredible when you look back and see
[37:27] how uh how unaware even his disciples
[37:31] even his close disciples were to
[37:34] comprehending that though he said it
[37:35] though he said it very clearly and he
[37:38] would say things like now what I do now
[37:40] you don't understand but you'll you'll
[37:42] know hereafter and the Bible actually
[37:43] follows on with that and later on you
[37:46] find a Bible where the disciples come to
[37:49] an awakening and they go then remembered
[37:52] they his words, how he had said this,
[37:54] that and the and the other. And so, you
[37:57] know, it it goes to show you friends
[37:59] that, you know, you can you can be a
[38:01] child of God, you can be the elect lady,
[38:03] you can be right in the plan of God, but
[38:05] the Holy Spirit still has to in his time
[38:08] and in his season unwind it and unfold
[38:11] it to you. So, we realize that Jesus had
[38:14] spoken quite a bit about a coming
[38:16] kingdom. And he was not uh he was not
[38:19] just going to uh go to the throne
[38:21] without Calvary. And neither was he
[38:24] going to just go to Calvary and die
[38:26] there. He was going to go into a tomb,
[38:28] but he wasn't going to stay there. He
[38:29] was going to rise, but he wasn't just
[38:31] going to stay with them. Although he
[38:33] stayed for about 40 days, he was going
[38:35] to ascend. And he wasn't just going to
[38:38] ascend. He was going to then return his
[38:40] spirit back into the church
[38:42] and that was going to be the the
[38:44] continuation
[38:46] of the ministry of the son of man in
[38:49] that early church. Now remember, as
[38:52] we've taught you before, there's a
[38:54] distinction to be made between the
[38:56] office of son of man and the ministry of
[38:57] the son of man. The office of son of man
[39:00] is the prophet. The ministry of the son
[39:02] of man is a broader term that means the
[39:04] word made flesh. So this is why brother
[39:07] Brandon would talk about the church on
[39:09] the on the day of Pentecost that now the
[39:12] word was once again made flesh in the
[39:15] earth. It started out with 120 people.
[39:17] Next thing you know it's in the
[39:19] thousands. Next thing you know it's in
[39:20] many thousands. Next thing you know it
[39:22] spreads in through Jerusalem and Judea
[39:24] and Samaria and ends up going to the
[39:27] uttermost part of the earth. This was
[39:29] not an accident.
[39:30] Amen. That was what what they were
[39:32] experiencing in their day in their day.
[39:36] They were experiencing modern events
[39:39] made clear in the Old Testament. They
[39:43] were experiencing modern events that
[39:45] Jesus was prophesying all the way
[39:48] through his first pull, his second pull.
[39:51] There were things they had already
[39:53] fulfilled in his first pull. In his
[39:55] second pool, he had said to them, you
[39:58] know, uh, you'll deny me. And they said,
[40:00] "We'll never deny you." He said, "Oh,
[40:01] Peter, you'll deny me three times before
[40:04] the can even crow." And so, you
[40:06] know, he he he he made all of these
[40:08] points about what would happen. He gave
[40:10] parables how that, you know, a king went
[40:13] away and then they sent after him
[40:15] saying, "We won't have this man to be
[40:16] ruling over us." So, he finally comes
[40:19] down to the end of his ministry and now
[40:21] he's operating in his third pull and
[40:23] he's taking the disciples aside and he's
[40:26] breaking bread and he's saying, "Take,
[40:28] eat. This is my body and this is my
[40:31] blood. Drink you all of it. It's my
[40:32] blood in the New Testament. Now under
[40:34] the third pull under the third pull of
[40:36] his ministry, he's prophesying. It's not
[40:39] just receive you the Holy Ghost when he
[40:41] breathed upon them, but now he's
[40:43] actually taking the next step and he's
[40:46] working a prophecy out that they don't
[40:48] quite understand. They still don't
[40:50] believe he's going to die. They still
[40:52] don't want any part anything to do with
[40:54] that. But it won't be very long before
[40:56] they all desert him. just and they
[40:58] actually became a modern event.
[41:01] Amen.
[41:02] Of things that he prophesied. Let me
[41:03] tell you something, friends. On the day
[41:05] of Pentecost, that was a a dynamic
[41:09] fulfillment of a prophecy that Jesus had
[41:12] given. He says in St. John 17, he breaks
[41:15] the whole thing down in 15:16
[41:18] and how that the spirit of God is going
[41:20] to come. And he's not even praying for
[41:22] the world, but on those whom God had
[41:24] given to him. And on the day of
[41:26] Pentecost, they literally are becoming
[41:29] the word made flesh. They are modern
[41:32] events. They themselves are modern
[41:34] events. It's not just about, oh, the
[41:36] Holy Ghost came that fulfilled a
[41:38] prophecy. They became the prophecy in
[41:42] flesh. A prophet went around the world
[41:45] seven times. First pull, second pull.
[41:48] But there were things that he began even
[41:51] before the seals. You're going to see
[41:52] here in a couple of quotes we're going
[41:53] to use tonight. even prior to the seals
[41:55] 1958 1960 he's starting to talk about
[41:59] the ministry of the morning star and the
[42:01] and and we we dealt with this last
[42:03] Sunday how that the ministry of the
[42:05] morning star is that which reflects the
[42:08] light of the sun that's why we talked
[42:09] about how that the morning star was
[42:11] Venus and and and we we we kind of we
[42:14] kind of you know the Bible says no man
[42:16] hath seen God at any time no man hath
[42:18] seen Venus at any time because it's
[42:20] surrounded uniquely among all the other
[42:23] planets It's surrounded by a cloud and
[42:25] that cloud reflects the light of the sun
[42:28] and that's why it's called a morning
[42:29] star and an evening star and it's the
[42:31] same star.
[42:32] And so you have the the cloud of
[42:34] witnesses down through seven church ages
[42:37] and they have been a reflection of God's
[42:39] light. But don't forget that you are the
[42:42] final reflection. You are that that
[42:44] consummation of the ages. Everything
[42:46] that has been prophesied by Jesus by the
[42:49] apostles written down in the book of
[42:51] revelation and a prophet in this day
[42:53] goes first pull second pull third pull
[42:55] and you are now that's why I keep
[42:57] telling you it when we say modern events
[42:59] I'm not I'm not limiting that to what's
[43:02] happening in the white house or Trump or
[43:03] the Vatican or this pope and American
[43:05] pope those are all just signs like Jesus
[43:08] said this sign and this sign and this
[43:09] sign it needs to be the the the end is
[43:12] not yet but these are the beginning of
[43:14] sorrows but I'm here to tell tell you
[43:16] the last sign that the world would see
[43:19] was when not just a prophet would would
[43:21] would be a a final voice, but a whole
[43:24] bride body. It wouldn't just be a
[43:26] prophet operating discernment. It would
[43:29] come into a third pool. And it wouldn't
[43:31] just be a bride speaking words or
[43:34] operating gifts or miracles in their
[43:36] life. They would be in their life a
[43:39] modern event, the most modern event.
[43:42] Amen.
[43:44] Amen.
[43:45] Because to to be able to come to the
[43:48] image of Christ, I'm here to tell you
[43:51] something, friends. The age has made
[43:53] that impossible.
[43:56] It's Satan's Eden. He's the God of this
[43:58] evil age. It's the days of Noah, the
[44:01] days of Lot. It's the the sin and
[44:04] perversion is everywhere. The church has
[44:06] kicked Christ out. The age has been
[44:08] indicted.
[44:09] Amen.
[44:10] Amen. There's no chance for the bride of
[44:13] her own accord, no matter what she would
[44:15] try to do, to become and have that
[44:18] capstone come down upon her. I'm here to
[44:20] tell you, you are becoming that because
[44:22] that's the strength and the power that
[44:25] is in the word of God that you're
[44:26] feeding on.
[44:27] Amen.
[44:28] And therefore, if you're not feeding on
[44:30] it, then no wonder your life uh spits
[44:33] and sputters. No wonder we find
[44:35] ourselves up and down, in and out. I
[44:37] feel close to God. I don't feel so close
[44:39] to God. I feel close to God. Uh well,
[44:41] when do you feel close to him? Well, on
[44:42] Wednesdays and Sundays. What about
[44:44] Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and
[44:45] Saturday? Well, I just need to get back
[44:46] to church. Oh, he's looking for you to
[44:49] have church every day. He's looking for
[44:51] that kind of relationship. That is what
[44:53] is being produced in this modern day.
[44:57] We are modern events.
[44:59] We are the most We are the cutting edge
[45:02] of a modern event made clear in
[45:04] prophecy. The prophecy is that at the
[45:07] end time the spirit and the bride would
[45:10] speak in a unified voice and say come.
[45:12] The invitation to the world is coming
[45:15] from Christ through his bride.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:19] Modern events are not something that's
[45:21] happening in politics. You are the most
[45:25] modern event.
[45:26] Amen.
[45:27] Yeah. In fact is you're not only the
[45:29] most modern that's going to make you the
[45:31] last.
[45:32] You're the last generation of Gentiles
[45:36] that will ever be in the earth that are
[45:38] literally the visible image. You are no
[45:41] man hath seen God at any time, but the
[45:43] only begotten son hath declared him. Now
[45:46] the bride is declaring Christ who
[45:47] declared the father. Oh my friends,
[45:50] this is the hour that we have arrived
[45:52] at.
[45:55] Now brother Brandham is coming here in
[45:57] 1960
[45:59] and I want you to just take a listen. I
[46:02] I had no intention to play this. Sister
[46:04] Debbie was playing it today. I was in my
[46:06] office working on on the material and I
[46:08] got so caught up in this certain part of
[46:10] this little eight minute segment.
[46:12] Brother Brandham is in a prayer line.
[46:13] He's already preached his sermon. He's
[46:15] coming to a prayer line. He's going to
[46:16] deal with three people. He's going to
[46:18] deal first with a woman and then by by
[46:23] extension her husband and then he's
[46:26] going to come to another woman. And he
[46:28] doesn't know either one of them. And
[46:30] then he's going to come to a third and
[46:31] it's a man who he does know. And I want
[46:34] you just to listen and just absorb for a
[46:37] moment what what God did. And this is
[46:41] even this is just 1960.
[46:44] This is what God sent into the earth. So
[46:48] you know to me I I just couldn't help
[46:50] but but feel this way and I I want to
[46:53] say this in the right way. There is a
[46:56] lot of opposition to the mess, what we
[46:59] call the message of the hour. There is a
[47:01] a lot of opposition to William Brandham
[47:03] as a man. There's a lot of things that
[47:05] get said and I just simply just say,
[47:08] "Okay, well, take a listen to this and
[47:12] tell me where else you see this kind of
[47:14] ministry and tell me, try to read your
[47:17] Bible and tell me it wasn't prophesied
[47:19] to be here and then it is here and it
[47:21] matches."
[47:22] Amen. Amen. So people are going to think
[47:24] what they want and they just can think
[47:26] what they want and God gives them every
[47:28] opportunity and every possible chance.
[47:32] But I want you just to listen for a
[47:33] moment because I I had such a benefit. I
[47:37] just will say this and I just will say
[47:38] this to parents
[47:40] as a from a small boy. I had I feel so
[47:46] rich in my mind and in my heart because
[47:51] I had a mother who just played the tapes
[47:55] of God's prophet all the time out loud
[47:58] in the house. She'd raise up the
[48:00] windows. You could hear it out playing
[48:01] out in the yard. Come in the house,
[48:02] you're hearing it. And I and I just I
[48:05] trust that that these children and these
[48:08] young people are actually not hearing
[48:10] about
[48:11] a prophet, but are they actually hearing
[48:14] that voice? Are our teenagers actually
[48:17] hearing the voice? Are your children
[48:19] actually hearing that voice? Ask
[48:21] yourself,
[48:22] amen. I'm here to tell you today that I
[48:25] am greatly benefited by the fact that
[48:28] even as a small child, I was raised up
[48:31] hearing the incredible, supernatural,
[48:35] mindbogling
[48:38] things like you're about to hear. And
[48:40] this is just three people out of tens of
[48:43] thousands.
[48:45] All right, brother Mark, let's go with
[48:47] it and let the text run with it.
[48:58] Now you see where I stand.
[49:00] There's 150 people here.
[49:04] I said this before tens of thousands and
[49:06] hundred thousands and
[49:08] as many as 500,000 at one time
[49:11] where they're sitting there with
[49:12] atheists, unbelievers, infidels, snake
[49:15] handlers, and everything else. He won't
[49:17] fail.
[49:19] Now, he's got to prove that he's a God
[49:21] of the Bible or he isn't the God of the
[49:22] Bible.
[49:23] Think about that.
[49:24] And if he is a God of the Bible, he's
[49:26] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[49:28] If he can tell this woman what she's
[49:30] here about, I never seen her. Or tell
[49:32] her something she knows I don't know
[49:35] nothing about. If he can tell her what
[49:37] she's here for, like he did the woman at
[49:39] the well. If he can explain to her
[49:41] something she knows, if I don't even
[49:43] know her and she don't know me, then
[49:45] here we are standing here for the first
[49:46] time in life. Surely that would shake
[49:48] you so hard till all the fog will go
[49:51] away from you.
[49:52] May he grant it is my prayer.
[49:55] Nowise
[49:56] the lady that's here uh to be prayed
[49:57] for. Jesus
[49:58] I want each one to believe now.
[50:00] Thank you Jesus.
[50:01] Now not knowing the lady I would just uh
[50:04] like to talk to her just a moment as our
[50:06] Lord did the the woman at the at the
[50:08] well.
[50:08] Praise
[50:09] just in order to contact her spirit.
[50:11] Thank you Jesus. Now,
[50:13] we are probably
[50:16] uh we've never met before, but yet the
[50:19] Lord knows you and he knows me. If he
[50:22] could tell me what you have come here
[50:24] for to ask me about something that that
[50:27] you know and I don't know nothing about
[50:29] you. Now, if he's sent you here and
[50:32] brought me here to maybe can explain to
[50:36] you or he can speak through me and tell
[50:38] me what you come up this platform for,
[50:40] would it make you believe him?
[50:42] it would make you believe it. Now I see
[50:44] the audience said they believe.
[50:46] Now here we are ready for something to
[50:49] happen if God's still God.
[50:53] The same thing that Jesus Christ did.
[50:57] I can see the lady now. She wants me to
[51:00] pray for her eyes. She's got something
[51:03] wrong with her eyes.
[51:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[51:07] Now, that wasn't a guess.
[51:10] That's right. Dear Jesus,
[51:11] her sight's failing her.
[51:12] Jesus.
[51:12] And she wants to be prayed for her eyes.
[51:14] That's the truth.
[51:16] That's if that's right. Wave that
[51:17] handkerchief to him, sister.
[51:18] Bless your name, Lord.
[51:19] I never seen her before in my life. What
[51:21] did that? What did that?
[51:24] She seems to be a nice person. You think
[51:26] I guess that? All right, we'll see.
[51:28] Lord, we praise your name.
[51:29] Now, lady,
[51:31] that the all suspicion might be taken
[51:33] out of this church from hence forth.
[51:35] that when brother Ruddle preaches that
[51:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[51:38] forever that it might be known by this
[51:40] pulpit that Christ Jesus manifested his
[51:43] glory
[51:44] prove it to be so now
[51:46] thank you Jesus
[51:47] yes I see she's her eyes is going bad
[51:50] it's a stigmatism that's in her eyes and
[51:52] another thing she's got something wrong
[51:55] with she's got a she's had an operation
[51:57] of some sort that's made a great scar a
[52:00] tissue
[52:02] she isn't from this city. Neither is she
[52:05] from this state. She's from Kentucky.
[52:08] That's right. And she's got a daughter.
[52:11] She wants prayed for a little girl about
[52:14] 8 or 10 years old.
[52:16] She wants prayer for that daughter
[52:17] because the daughter's up for an
[52:19] operation.
[52:20] That's thus sayeth the Lord.
[52:22] Hallelujah.
[52:25] See if that's true or not.
[52:27] Was that true, lady? If that's true,
[52:28] wave that hand to the people.
[52:30] She's almost 6 years old.
[52:33] It's a little girl.
[52:35] All right. You believe that God can tell
[52:37] me what your name is?
[52:39] If God here, I'll tell you something
[52:40] else. Here comes a man standing by the
[52:42] side of you.
[52:43] Thank you, Jesus.
[52:44] That's your husband.
[52:45] Thank you, Jesus.
[52:46] He's standing right back here.
[52:49] That's right.
[52:50] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[52:51] He's also needing healing.
[52:56] He's got rheumatism.
[52:57] That's right.
[52:59] Thank you, Jesus. Your name is Camper.
[53:02] Thank you.
[53:03] That's right.
[53:04] And you're from Kentucky. Go back down
[53:06] to Kentucky and receive. Take that
[53:08] handkerchief. Laid it on the child.
[53:09] Believe it.
[53:12] Amen.
[53:13] G.
[53:13] You believe with all your heart.
[53:17] That's almost an encyclopedia of the
[53:19] woman's life.
[53:22] Uh, hold my hands. I never seen her
[53:24] before in my life.
[53:27] [Music]
[53:29] Now see what did he touch? What did he
[53:32] do? He touched that high priest.
[53:35] He touched that one that can be touched
[53:37] by the feeling of our infirmity.
[53:40] Now healing is God's own witness, his
[53:44] own glory.
[53:48] All right.
[53:50] You I believe you're a stranger to me. I
[53:52] don't believe I know you. God knows you.
[53:55] If God will reveal to me what your
[53:57] trouble is or what you want, whether
[54:00] it's sickness, domestic, or whatever it
[54:02] might be, you'll believe with all your
[54:04] heart, will you, lady? Now, here's
[54:06] another lady that I do not know, and she
[54:09] does not know me. We're total strangers
[54:11] to one another.
[54:15] This is our first meeting time in life.
[54:19] But if the Holy Spirit can come present,
[54:22] come in here now and tell us
[54:24] of something about this woman. Now, to
[54:27] heal her, I could not do that. God did
[54:30] that when he died at Calvary. If she's a
[54:32] sinner, I could not save her because
[54:35] Jesus did that. That's already finished.
[54:37] But he can come in the presence of his
[54:39] being to show that he is still alive and
[54:43] his works are still real
[54:46] to make it real to him. If we can
[54:48] believe
[54:52] if thou can't believe all things are,
[54:57] if you can just believe now,
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:01] don't doubt.
[55:04] Somebody feeling good. Just that's all
[55:06] right.
[55:09] I was going down through the state of
[55:11] Kentucky the other day. I heard a man
[55:13] coming up through the bushes screaming.
[55:14] I said, "Is that man, what's the matter
[55:17] with him?" said he's just drunk and
[55:18] feeling good. So is this man, but he's
[55:21] drunk on a different day.
[55:24] Just drunk and feeling good.
[55:27] So
[55:29] be not drunk upon strong drinks, but be
[55:32] drunk on the spirit, said the Bible.
[55:35] God. Now, this woman here being a
[55:38] stranger, if God can tell her what her
[55:41] trouble is or something about her that
[55:44] she knows that I do not know, let her be
[55:46] the witness, she'll know whether it's
[55:48] true or not. That right, lady, would it
[55:51] help you if God did that? Now, to heal
[55:53] you, sister. If I could do it, I'd do
[55:55] it. But I can't. I'm just a man.
[56:00] But the lady is sure to be prayed for.
[56:03] She's got a gallstone condition.
[56:06] That's right. And she's also got
[56:08] diabetes.
[56:10] That's what she want prayed for, is it,
[56:11] lady?
[56:13] That's right. Raise up your hand so the
[56:14] people can see. You believe God could
[56:16] tell me who you are. Would that help
[56:18] you?
[56:20] It would. Now, Miss Johnson, go back and
[56:22] take your seat and be healed if you
[56:24] believe it in the name of the Lord
[56:25] Jesus.
[56:27] If you can't believe, I don't know
[56:29] what's wrong. There's something wrong.
[56:30] Don't you see the sunlight is shining?
[56:32] That's the same thing Jesus Christ did.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:35] Hallelujah.
[56:36] I know this man.
[56:38] I was his mother-in-law shirt and and I
[56:42] know his wife. I haven't seen him for a
[56:44] long long time. His name is James Mars.
[56:47] But I don't know what he's here for. I
[56:49] don't know what's wrong with him. I
[56:51] haven't seen Jim in so long. But I He
[56:53] know me and I was a little boy. But Jim,
[56:55] if the Lord can reveal to me what you're
[56:57] here for, will you accept it as you
[57:01] believe then you'll get what you ask
[57:02] for?
[57:02] Amen. You're here for a son. It's a
[57:05] mental condition. He'll be healed.
[57:08] Amen.
[57:08] Believe it now.
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:24] I know this lady.
[57:26] She's the wife of a very dear friend of
[57:28] mine.
[57:30] Her name is Yeah.
[57:35] Amen.
[57:36] Praise God indeed.
[57:38] Amen.
[57:38] Amen. I tell you what, uh
[57:41] that's the kind of I I don't you know,
[57:44] Brother Jim, God bless you, but Southern
[57:48] meetings go like that often.
[57:51] Amen. We uh we love the movement of the
[57:54] Holy Spirit and of course I know they do
[57:56] as well up there. I've been there many
[57:58] times up around Lime, Ohio. And the
[58:00] spirit of God moves all over the place.
[58:02] But I'm going to tell you something,
[58:03] friends. This was not something that was
[58:05] done in a corner. And you wouldn't
[58:07] imagine it would be so because God is
[58:10] about, he's demonstrating a prophecy
[58:14] that was one of the oldest prophecies
[58:17] still on the records that after seven
[58:20] church ages and 2,000 years still hung
[58:24] in in in the atmosphere waiting for
[58:27] fulfillment, waiting for that ministry.
[58:30] uh like like it was when Abraham met him
[58:33] there in the in uh in Ger and he
[58:36] literally can discern the secrets of the
[58:38] heart. Now you can you can say tonight
[58:40] and say well okay fine for a brother
[58:44] Brandham but that's I'm not going to go
[58:46] and hold prayer lines and that's fine
[58:48] because you're not in the office of son
[58:50] of man but you are still in the ministry
[58:52] of the son of man.
[58:54] You're still to make the word alive. You
[58:57] don't need brother Brandham's gift there
[58:58] and being able to know those things that
[59:00] that was only an attraction. What what
[59:03] what what was the real kernel of the
[59:06] whole thing was that the word of the
[59:08] life of Christ was being on display and
[59:11] while a while while the Christian world
[59:13] was going away from holiness,
[59:16] going away from the power of God, not
[59:18] power to create a squirrel or speak a
[59:21] storm that that that accompanies it, but
[59:24] a power to be a lived life to actually
[59:27] have the voice of the resurrection
[59:30] speaking through your life. Amen. Amen.
[59:35] I find and I want to turn a corner now
[59:37] because I find that I now that I've got
[59:40] that in your mind, I I I want to bring
[59:42] this point to you that it it was not
[59:46] just William Brandham's uh office and
[59:49] calling that made him a great Christian
[59:54] man or made him the kind of prophet that
[59:57] this age would need. It was not was not
[1:00:00] it was never those things that did that.
[1:00:02] It was a life not just because he was a
[1:00:04] prophet but it was a life of dedication,
[1:00:08] a life of consecration, a life of
[1:00:10] humility, a life of sincerity. And I
[1:00:13] don't care in what low tones you speak
[1:00:16] in or you are or what how humble your
[1:00:19] clothing may look. You're not a humble
[1:00:21] person if you won't let your life be
[1:00:24] lined up by the word of God.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:26] If you won't allow I'm going to say it
[1:00:28] again. And it doesn't matter how humble
[1:00:30] your clothing might be. You might drive
[1:00:32] an old junker. You might speak in low t
[1:00:34] tones and walk with your head staring at
[1:00:36] the ground. That doesn't make you
[1:00:38] humble.
[1:00:40] That just makes you religious. Doesn't
[1:00:42] even make you spiritual. But what makes
[1:00:45] you spiritual? What is God is looking
[1:00:46] for is somebody who will take the word
[1:00:49] and say, "I believe it and I I believe
[1:00:51] it. I'm going to prove I believe it by
[1:00:52] allowing it to control my life."
[1:00:56] Amen. In a world when so many other
[1:00:58] things are pulling and vying to control
[1:01:00] your life.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:03] Brother Brandham
[1:01:05] here he goes on and I think I've got
[1:01:07] control of that. All right, I'll catch
[1:01:08] it in a second. So, Brother Brandham
[1:01:12] comes to a quote here and uh and and
[1:01:15] this is um this is from 1958, two two
[1:01:19] years prior to the to the little part
[1:01:22] you just heard. And brother Brandham
[1:01:24] says, you know what is it? It's the
[1:01:26] glory of God.
[1:01:29] It's the power of God.
[1:01:31] The shadows are falling. Christ is
[1:01:34] appearing. That's why signs and wonders
[1:01:36] are appearing. Two years later, when the
[1:01:40] events of what you just heard unfolded,
[1:01:42] he's already qualifying what's about to
[1:01:45] happen here in advance and saying,
[1:01:47] "Here's what's happening. Signs and
[1:01:48] wonders are appearing. What if after
[1:01:50] 1958 it would have went dry and the well
[1:01:52] would have went dry and everything would
[1:01:53] have just went flat and William Brandon
[1:01:55] would have become an intellectual and
[1:01:56] all we were as an intellectual group of
[1:01:58] people in another denomination.
[1:02:00] But literally he's he's showing that's
[1:02:03] going to be impossible. There will be no
[1:02:06] way to make this into a denomination
[1:02:08] because this is the evening time. That's
[1:02:10] why signs are appearing. The great
[1:02:12] shadows are are falling. Christ is
[1:02:14] appearing. That's why signs and wonders
[1:02:16] are appearing. It's that great sunlight
[1:02:19] reflecting off the morning stars.
[1:02:21] Amen.
[1:02:23] With healing in his wings. And if he
[1:02:25] will bring healing from the reflection
[1:02:27] of his presence, what will he do when he
[1:02:29] comes in person? These corruptible
[1:02:32] bodies of ours will be changed and made
[1:02:34] like unto his own glorious body. What
[1:02:36] will it what will it be when he comes?
[1:02:38] Until he comes, we are thankful for the
[1:02:41] sunlight of his presence. as the morning
[1:02:44] stars do climb the ramparts of glory and
[1:02:47] setting there to hail his coming in this
[1:02:50] dark hour and it wasn't even all that
[1:02:52] dark by comparison are is your life
[1:02:56] hailing the appearing
[1:02:58] you understand so it's not about can we
[1:03:00] get in a prayer line and discern the
[1:03:02] secrets of heart that's just that's just
[1:03:04] a bait on the fish's hook what God is
[1:03:07] trying to get is a people like that
[1:03:09] first church and who had the word living
[1:03:12] through their lives lives.
[1:03:14] Amen.
[1:03:15] And and this is why brother Brandon
[1:03:16] would make statements like, you know,
[1:03:19] when when Satan sees a son, a son or
[1:03:21] daughter of God, a child of God coming
[1:03:23] down the street, said demons howl and
[1:03:26] faint.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:28] Amen.
[1:03:30] Sometimes I wonder, are demons howling
[1:03:32] and fainting at my approach, or are they
[1:03:35] running to me like a familiar friend?
[1:03:38] Come on, friends. Let's be honest.
[1:03:41] Sometimes I wonder, Lord, where's my
[1:03:42] life in all of this? I I want to see
[1:03:44] more of the Holy Spirit controlling my
[1:03:47] life. I want to see more of the of the
[1:03:49] influence of the word of God. I want to
[1:03:51] see where I mean, you know, where we
[1:03:52] don't we don't I love Wednesday nights
[1:03:54] because it's like a a tank up in the
[1:03:56] middle of the week. You can top your
[1:03:57] tank off. But let me tell you something,
[1:03:59] friends. I love it for that reason. But
[1:04:01] I want to see him on Thursday and on
[1:04:03] Friday and on Saturday. And when I come
[1:04:05] in on Sunday, I'm already soaring like
[1:04:07] an eagle. Praise God.
[1:04:11] Demon spirits should not corral around
[1:04:14] you like a familiar friend. They should
[1:04:15] be howling and fainting at your
[1:04:17] approach.
[1:04:17] Amen.
[1:04:19] Now, a little bit of background. I just
[1:04:20] want to tell you a story. I'm not going
[1:04:21] to read all the all the quote. Brother
[1:04:23] Brandon, when he's saying this about
[1:04:24] morning stars,
[1:04:27] the whole thing is based on a story that
[1:04:29] he had just told about a little
[1:04:31] four-month-old baby that had gotten
[1:04:34] cancer inside of its jaw. And brother
[1:04:37] Brandham said uh a man called him as a
[1:04:39] brother Argites. He called him as a
[1:04:41] Spanish man and he said he and brother
[1:04:44] Brandham answered the phone and he told
[1:04:45] the case my he's only four years old
[1:04:48] brother Brandham and I brought him here
[1:04:49] to see if you could pray for him. You
[1:04:51] know I can't get to you and brother
[1:04:52] Brandham says I'll come to you me and
[1:04:54] brother Argabbrite. You talk to brother
[1:04:55] Argite he'll this is his city. He'll get
[1:04:58] the uh the directions and we'll come
[1:04:59] pray. And they did. They met and they
[1:05:01] met at the hospital and brother Brandham
[1:05:03] goes into the hospital and he he begins
[1:05:07] to tell how that he how that he says the
[1:05:10] nurse was standing there and I looked
[1:05:12] down at the little fellow and I thought
[1:05:14] Lord what would you do if you were
[1:05:16] standing here see and so it was a very
[1:05:20] very very pitiful case I don't even want
[1:05:22] to read the details because it's it's
[1:05:24] just too heart-wrenching I thankfully it
[1:05:26] had a good ending
[1:05:28] but but he but he talks about how that
[1:05:30] this cancer had grown and it had pushed
[1:05:33] his tongue and his jaw and it was
[1:05:35] closing off his airways and they had
[1:05:37] they had cut a hole and put a little
[1:05:39] thing in his throat and and so it would
[1:05:41] weeze. Brother Brandham said it would
[1:05:42] just weeze as he would draw in to take a
[1:05:44] breath. You could hear it wheezing and
[1:05:46] they would constantly have to suction it
[1:05:47] out. And it's four months old. You can't
[1:05:50] get more innocent
[1:05:52] than a four-month old child. And so so
[1:05:55] we find that he said that daddy he said
[1:05:58] he just laid over him you know daddy's
[1:06:00] little boy oh daddy brought brother
[1:06:02] Brandham to pray for you and when he
[1:06:04] said daddy's little boy he said my
[1:06:06] spirit just left me I couldn't stand it
[1:06:08] any longer I had to hold to the side of
[1:06:10] the bed daddy's little boy brother
[1:06:12] Brandham had suffered such tragic loss
[1:06:15] of his own children and his own first
[1:06:18] wife and he had been through such hard
[1:06:20] tri such hard trials and he said the
[1:06:23] little fellow yet youth ful as he was.
[1:06:25] Note, it was his daddy. He started
[1:06:26] wheezing like that, his little arms like
[1:06:28] that, and him trying to pat the little
[1:06:30] fellow on the head. Poor little baby
[1:06:31] born in that condition. I couldn't
[1:06:33] speak.
[1:06:35] You just get so full, you just can't say
[1:06:37] nothing. I looked down and seen them
[1:06:38] little bitty hands out from under those
[1:06:40] big splints and making a wheezing noise.
[1:06:42] And I thought, isn't that pitiful? And
[1:06:44] after I got kind of round to myself
[1:06:46] enough to think something, I thought,
[1:06:48] Jesus, do you mean that you get pleasure
[1:06:51] out of seeing that? I can't believe it.
[1:06:53] I can't believe that you get glory out
[1:06:55] of that little baby suffering like that.
[1:06:57] It just can't be. If it makes if it
[1:07:00] makes me a sinner feel like I do to
[1:07:03] toward that baby, what does it do to
[1:07:05] you? The resource of all mercy. What
[1:07:08] must it do to you? And I said, "No word
[1:07:11] yet." And he was trying to play with it
[1:07:14] and get it quiet and its little body,
[1:07:16] little diaper, and and little body not
[1:07:18] over that big and its head with just the
[1:07:20] biggest part. his jaws all swollen out
[1:07:22] so big and they had something around his
[1:07:24] head to keep his little head from
[1:07:25] bursting like and he said his jaws was
[1:07:28] swollen so to keep it like that to keep
[1:07:30] that from bursting and the nurse was
[1:07:32] standing there now watch friends I'm
[1:07:33] coming to something
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:36] brother Brandham in this sermon is going
[1:07:38] to talk about morning stars and this is
[1:07:41] the real challenge to be a morning star
[1:07:43] in this darkened age and he says and the
[1:07:46] nurse was standing there and I I looked
[1:07:48] down at the little fell and I thought
[1:07:49] Lord what would you do if you were
[1:07:51] standing here now. I realize I'm in the
[1:07:54] pull pit and I realize that God is
[1:07:55] present, but it seemed to me that
[1:07:58] something spoke down in my soul and
[1:08:00] said, "I'm waiting to see what you're
[1:08:03] going to do about it."
[1:08:04] Amen.
[1:08:06] I gave my authority to the church. There
[1:08:09] you come back again to say to this
[1:08:11] mountain, you remember the problem, the
[1:08:13] pro the trial brother Brandham had over
[1:08:15] that scripture. Remember we preached on
[1:08:16] it? They're in the woods. Who are you?
[1:08:18] What do you want? About to go crazy if
[1:08:20] you say to this mountain. He said, I'm
[1:08:23] waiting to see. He said, I gave my
[1:08:25] authority to the church and I'm waiting
[1:08:27] to see what you're going to do.
[1:08:30] I wonder if that's his attitude towards
[1:08:33] us all the time that he's waiting to see
[1:08:36] what we're going to do.
[1:08:39] What about the signs of the time we've
[1:08:41] just been preaching about? What would he
[1:08:43] do? Oh, what would he do? We say, "What
[1:08:46] would Jesus do? He's waiting to see what
[1:08:49] we will do.
[1:08:51] Well, I got this little baby's hand just
[1:08:54] as just in my fingers like that. It was
[1:08:56] so little. And I said, "Lord, hear the
[1:08:58] prayer of your servant." And by faith
[1:09:00] that I believe that you are, I place
[1:09:03] between this demon of cancer and the
[1:09:06] baby's life, the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:09] Between the killer and the baby, the
[1:09:11] blood.
[1:09:12] By faith, I placed that. And I couldn't
[1:09:15] say nothing else. I just turned around
[1:09:17] and started walking out. The father
[1:09:19] followed me. He says it on down. He
[1:09:21] says, "And I went up to the house and in
[1:09:23] the matter of a few hours, them jaws
[1:09:25] went down and his tongue went back to
[1:09:27] its normal place. God healed that little
[1:09:29] fella and they were removing the whistle
[1:09:31] that morning that I left out of his
[1:09:33] throat. It alarmed the whole West
[1:09:34] Coast."
[1:09:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:37] The man tried to bring Brother Brandham
[1:09:39] some tithing and brother Brandon
[1:09:40] wouldn't take it. He said, "You give
[1:09:41] that to pay the doctor bill." He said,
[1:09:42] "The doctor told me he's not going to
[1:09:44] charge me cuz he didn't heal the baby.
[1:09:46] He said some other power healed this
[1:09:48] baby." And the doctor refused to even
[1:09:50] take money for it. I'm here to tell you
[1:09:52] something, friends. Now, what do you
[1:09:53] think when he comes down just a number
[1:09:55] of paragraphs later and he says, "This
[1:09:57] is the time of the morning stars.
[1:10:00] What are we doing about it, friends? I I
[1:10:02] know what William Brandham did about it.
[1:10:04] I I know what Paul did. I know what
[1:10:05] Luther did. I know what Wesley did. What
[1:10:08] are you and I doing about it?"
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:14] He's waiting.
[1:10:17] He's waiting to see what we'll do about
[1:10:20] it.
[1:10:21] It struck me. It struck me that all
[1:10:24] brother Brandham did
[1:10:28] was by faith he placed the blood of
[1:10:31] Jesus between the cancer and the life of
[1:10:34] the child.
[1:10:35] Amen.
[1:10:35] And he just said, "I place it there in
[1:10:37] the name of Jesus Christ." And walked
[1:10:39] out.
[1:10:41] No thunder, no lightning, nobody in a
[1:10:44] meeting screaming, you know, nobody
[1:10:46] drunk on the spirit having a good time.
[1:10:47] He just said by I couldn't even speak. I
[1:10:49] couldn't do anything. He He didn't see a
[1:10:51] vision. He just says, "I just place the
[1:10:53] blood of Jesus Christ between this demon
[1:10:55] and between the life of the child." And
[1:10:57] within hours,
[1:11:00] I'm going to tell you something,
[1:11:00] friends. That's the real ministry of the
[1:11:02] morning star.
[1:11:04] Hallelujah.
[1:11:06] When I was listening to that, I was
[1:11:08] listening to it very early in the
[1:11:09] morning some days ago.
[1:11:11] It affected me so deeply and I thought,
[1:11:15] Lord, you know, you'll come in such a a
[1:11:17] way uh and make me feel so challenged
[1:11:21] just listening to this quote there in
[1:11:23] the darkness of the living room. And I
[1:11:25] was just listening to brother Brandham
[1:11:26] talk about that and and this is the
[1:11:28] ministry of the morning star. And I just
[1:11:30] thought, my goodness, Lord, that's
[1:11:31] exactly what I've been preaching on. And
[1:11:34] I I'll be honest with you, friends, if
[1:11:35] I'm just going to be honest, I might as
[1:11:37] well be honest completely. I I got I
[1:11:40] felt so anointed that I I thought I know
[1:11:43] what Peter feels like. I I the whole
[1:11:46] room got so charged. I I felt like
[1:11:48] saying like Peter, Lord, go away from
[1:11:50] me. I'm a sinful man. It was such a
[1:11:53] power of God that dropped down and I
[1:11:54] just right then and there, I said, Lord
[1:11:56] God, come what may, I want my life to
[1:11:59] reflect that morning star. I want to
[1:12:01] have that in my life, Lord. And I'm I
[1:12:03] want to whatever the price is, you teach
[1:12:05] me. You show me. I want to pay it. I
[1:12:07] want to be a modern event.
[1:12:10] I want to be the event in the modern
[1:12:12] day. The last cutting edge right on the
[1:12:15] line defending the gospel declaring the
[1:12:19] appearing of the son of God.
[1:12:31] our fifth church age,
[1:12:33] our fifth age messenger, Martin Luther,
[1:12:37] brother Brandham said of him in the
[1:12:39] Sardisian age, and I'm good on time. I
[1:12:41] got 15 minutes. I could I I think I can
[1:12:43] get there.
[1:12:45] Um
[1:12:47] Oops. Turn it on.
[1:12:50] So, here here's the quote. Uh what is
[1:12:54] it? It's the glory of God. It's the
[1:12:56] power of God. The shadows are falling.
[1:12:58] Christ is appearing. That's why signs
[1:13:00] and wonders are appearing. It's that
[1:13:02] great sunlight reflecting off of the off
[1:13:04] the morning star with healing in his
[1:13:06] wings. And if he'll bring healing from
[1:13:09] the reflection of his presence, what
[1:13:11] will he do when he comes in person?
[1:13:12] These corruptible bodies of ours will be
[1:13:15] changed and made like into his glorious
[1:13:17] body. What will it be when he comes?
[1:13:22] until he comes. We are thankful for the
[1:13:25] sunlight of his presence as the morning
[1:13:27] stars do climb the ramparts of glory and
[1:13:30] setting there to hail his coming in this
[1:13:33] dark hour.
[1:13:36] Martin Luther was one who who hailed the
[1:13:40] true Christ and and with only a fraction
[1:13:43] of what you and I have
[1:13:46] with was one single he was a
[1:13:48] trinitarian.
[1:13:50] He didn't even have holiness completely
[1:13:52] in place,
[1:13:53] but he understood he and he he he didn't
[1:13:57] even understand all of his teachings
[1:13:58] aren't exactly correct, but he
[1:14:00] understood that the just shall live by
[1:14:02] faith. He looked back in the Old
[1:14:03] Testament and he found that promise that
[1:14:06] the just shall live by their faith. And
[1:14:08] he realized that Paul picked that up out
[1:14:11] of the Old Testament and brought it to
[1:14:12] the church in the New Testament. And
[1:14:14] Martin Luther said it's never changed.
[1:14:17] So if if I'm going to be on a modern
[1:14:19] event made clear, then I've got to
[1:14:21] preach the just shall live by faith.
[1:14:24] Everybody who was not accepting of that
[1:14:26] message were not a modern event.
[1:14:29] They were a past event.
[1:14:34] Brother Brandham said he was a mighty
[1:14:35] preacher and teacher of the word and
[1:14:37] insisted especially in his first years
[1:14:39] of public imminence that the word was
[1:14:42] the sole criterion. This is speaking of
[1:14:44] Luther. Thus he was against works as a
[1:14:47] means of salvation and baptism as a
[1:14:49] means of regeneration. He taught the
[1:14:50] mediation of Christ apart from man and
[1:14:55] was the original and Pentecostal
[1:14:57] concept. I love that. That was what the
[1:14:59] original Pentecostal concept was.
[1:15:02] He um he was a man. Now listen to this.
[1:15:07] How was mo how was Luther a modern event
[1:15:10] made clear? How did he end up not being
[1:15:12] a past event?
[1:15:13] Amen. made glare.
[1:15:18] Yeah. So, you know, he's he wants to be
[1:15:20] a modern event made clear. I want to be
[1:15:21] a modern event made clear, not a past
[1:15:23] event made in as a glare.
[1:15:25] Amen.
[1:15:27] He was a man given to much prayer
[1:15:31] and had learned that the more work he
[1:15:34] had to do. Hello, Leodysian men.
[1:15:36] Come on.
[1:15:37] Come on.
[1:15:39] Here in this western civilization, we're
[1:15:40] all chained to Pharaoh's chariot. We
[1:15:43] spend half of our lives uh slaving away
[1:15:45] at it. And and look, and Martin wasn't
[1:15:48] no different. He and he said he he was a
[1:15:50] man given to much prayer. And he learned
[1:15:52] he didn't know this at first, but he
[1:15:53] learned it that the more work he had to
[1:15:56] do,
[1:15:58] the more sorely he was pressed for time,
[1:16:02] the more of his time he gave to God in
[1:16:04] prayer.
[1:16:06] Wow.
[1:16:06] Seems counterintuitive. Seems like, man,
[1:16:09] you ain't hardly got time. He didn't
[1:16:10] just He didn't just maintain a prayer
[1:16:12] life under his busy load. He increased
[1:16:15] it.
[1:16:16] Amen.
[1:16:16] Watch what he knew. Here's his secret.
[1:16:18] Here's his secret. You want the secret
[1:16:19] of Martin Luther?
[1:16:21] He learned that the more work he had to
[1:16:23] do and the more sorely he was pressed
[1:16:25] for time, the more of his time he gave
[1:16:27] to God in prayer in order to ensure
[1:16:31] satisfactory results.
[1:16:33] So you have to decide, do I want to have
[1:16:36] results or do I want to have
[1:16:37] satisfactory results?
[1:16:40] John Wesley was a a great man, our sixth
[1:16:44] age messenger.
[1:16:46] He traveled a quarter of a million
[1:16:50] miles. He's said to have traveled a
[1:16:53] quarter of a million miles on horseback.
[1:16:57] Amen.
[1:16:58] Preaching all across up and down across
[1:17:02] uh England and Ireland. A quarter of a
[1:17:06] million miles. I I I was looking at the
[1:17:09] other day to think how many miles have I
[1:17:11] flown around the world globally around
[1:17:13] the world on jumbo jets for for 30 plus
[1:17:17] years and I'm barely can can make this
[1:17:21] class. He did that on a horse.
[1:17:23] Amen.
[1:17:24] And over his lifetime he is credited
[1:17:27] with with preaching as many as 45,000
[1:17:31] sermons.
[1:17:32] Wow.
[1:17:33] If I preach three times I did the math
[1:17:35] here some time ago. I think I shared it
[1:17:37] with you. If I did the two to three
[1:17:39] times a week, I think I even gave myself
[1:17:41] a little extra boost because I preach
[1:17:43] online and I said if I preach three
[1:17:45] times a week, I forget how many decades
[1:17:47] that I I thought I I think I was three
[1:17:49] to four decades of doing that. And I
[1:17:52] still would barely cracked this number,
[1:17:54] maybe even half of it.
[1:17:56] Amen.
[1:17:57] And here's a man who drove who rode
[1:17:59] horseback a quarter of a million miles
[1:18:01] and preached as many as 45,000
[1:18:05] sermons. And the Bible said the the the
[1:18:08] history says that he was at the mines
[1:18:10] every morning at 5:00 a.m. I'm sitting
[1:18:12] in my 5:00 a.m. chair. Wesley was
[1:18:14] already at the mines preaching to the
[1:18:16] miners as they went into work.
[1:18:20] He was a man known I read his memoirs.
[1:18:22] He was a man known for not being able to
[1:18:25] to loaf and waste time. In fact is he
[1:18:29] was so fanatical with it that when he
[1:18:31] would get in the bed at night, he got
[1:18:33] very convicted because it took him a
[1:18:35] half an hour to fall asleep and he
[1:18:36] thought that was a great waste of time.
[1:18:38] He could be serving God instead of
[1:18:41] laying there 30 minutes trying to go to
[1:18:42] sleep. So he started getting up a half
[1:18:45] an hour earlier.
[1:18:47] And then when he got up a half an hour,
[1:18:49] I think he started out at like something
[1:18:50] like six or seven o'clock. And so he
[1:18:52] started getting up at like now instead
[1:18:54] of six, he started getting up at 5:30.
[1:18:57] And he said, "I found that I still laid
[1:18:59] there at night about 20 minutes." And
[1:19:01] this was untenable to me. I read it. I
[1:19:02] read his memoirs. And so he started
[1:19:05] getting up a half an hour earlier. And
[1:19:08] now he's getting up at 5:00 a.m. And he
[1:19:09] said, "I found that I still laid there
[1:19:12] about 10 minutes and I couldn't fall
[1:19:14] asleep. This was," he said, "This is
[1:19:15] ungodly. I can't have that in my life. I
[1:19:18] can't lay here 10 minutes to fall
[1:19:19] asleep. I should be doing something for
[1:19:21] the Lord. We think we have busy
[1:19:24] schedules.
[1:19:26] He started getting up at 4:30 and he
[1:19:28] said, "I found that I still laid there
[1:19:29] five minutes."
[1:19:32] And this drove the poor brother crazy.
[1:19:34] He said, "So I started getting up at 4."
[1:19:36] And he said, "I found that when I woke
[1:19:38] at 4, I laid my head on my pillow at
[1:19:40] night, I fell instantly asleep.
[1:19:47] Wow.
[1:19:50] 45,000
[1:19:52] sermons. Brother Jason, imagine how many
[1:19:54] times he opened his Bible.
[1:19:57] I mean, if you're going to preach,
[1:19:59] you're going to actually preach. You're
[1:20:01] already opening it 45,000 times just to
[1:20:03] preach. Imagine how many times he sat
[1:20:06] down and opened his Bible or or had his
[1:20:10] nose in his Bible. Amen.
[1:20:15] Amen. Are you thoroughly impressed?
[1:20:19] You know, I I I have this trainer that
[1:20:23] I've been trying to I'm not very good at
[1:20:25] it. I sent but fortunately I was able to
[1:20:28] help somebody when we were out we were
[1:20:30] out of town. Travis got up and he was he
[1:20:32] had a really stiff back and he he said,
[1:20:34] "Man, I could see how he was moving.
[1:20:35] He's barely I could barely move." And I
[1:20:37] said, "Hey, T, I'm going to show you
[1:20:38] something." I said, "I learned this. I
[1:20:40] got a this trainer guy that I watch on
[1:20:42] YouTube. He's my age. That's why I watch
[1:20:44] him because he don't push me too hard.
[1:20:46] And and and so he's got this thing where
[1:20:49] and you probably seen there's there's
[1:20:50] dozens of them. Once you watch one, the
[1:20:52] algorithm see and then they start
[1:20:53] flooding you with them. And everybody
[1:20:55] they come on with if you'll do this you
[1:20:58] know if you'll do this and you know his
[1:21:00] video starts if you'll do this if you'll
[1:21:03] just lay flat on your back and you know
[1:21:05] raise your knees and then and then uh
[1:21:08] cross one foot up over on your knee and
[1:21:10] then ro keeping this part of your body
[1:21:12] rotate your lower hips over till that
[1:21:14] foot lays on the floor. It'll it'll
[1:21:17] release thoracic pressure. It'll stretch
[1:21:19] glute muscles. It'll stretch all of
[1:21:20] that. And it works. I've did it. And I
[1:21:22] showed Travis and I said, "And then you
[1:21:24] switch and if you'll just do this and
[1:21:26] put your foot on that knee and then
[1:21:28] rotate that one over while it's on your
[1:21:30] other knee, rotate it till I'd show you
[1:21:32] a demonstration, but I'm preaching." And
[1:21:34] and put your foot flat on the floor.
[1:21:37] See? Yeah. Exactly.
[1:21:41] And so I Chris used to be my trainer,
[1:21:43] but he's so rough on me, man. I I had to
[1:21:45] fire him.
[1:21:48] And no, that's not really true.
[1:21:50] And then he goes on, "If you'll extend
[1:21:52] your legs from the tabletop position,
[1:21:56] you will stretch out your hamstrings and
[1:21:57] improve your knee health. If you put
[1:22:00] your hand behind your head and and
[1:22:02] you're in a in that position and do like
[1:22:04] that and then twist," he said, "then
[1:22:06] then this will actually improve your
[1:22:08] thoracic spine mobility." He's got all
[1:22:10] of these things if you'll do this. If
[1:22:12] you'll do this, if you'll do this, and I
[1:22:14] thought, "Well, you know, if you'll do
[1:22:16] this,
[1:22:18] Amen.
[1:22:19] Could I say to you tonight, Paul said
[1:22:21] exercise is worth a little bit,
[1:22:23] but they got all of these all of these
[1:22:26] tens of thousands of talking gurus who
[1:22:28] get online and say, "If you'll do this,
[1:22:31] if you'll just do this, if you'll get in
[1:22:33] this position and stretch this out, if
[1:22:35] you'll put your hand up here, I wonder
[1:22:37] if they'll do that."
[1:22:39] I want I wonder what it's going to take
[1:22:41] to make us morning stars. I can tell you
[1:22:43] it has nothing to do with rotating on on
[1:22:45] a floor exercise.
[1:22:47] If you'll do this, if you'll do this,
[1:22:50] how many times has he gonna read his
[1:22:52] Bible to preach 45,000 times? He rides
[1:22:55] it on horseback a quarter of a million
[1:22:58] miles.
[1:22:59] Amen.
[1:23:00] If you'll do this,
[1:23:05] if you'll do this,
[1:23:10] why don't you try that?
[1:23:13] Why don't you try this and this and this
[1:23:17] and this?
[1:23:18] Amen.
[1:23:19] Have some better friends. That's FF
[1:23:20] Bossworth. Have some better friends.
[1:23:22] Hey, try this one. Dedicate your life.
[1:23:25] Enlist in the royal service of others.
[1:23:28] I'm not here to say, "Oh, if you'll do
[1:23:29] this, you can release your thoracic. If
[1:23:31] you'll do this, you can release this
[1:23:32] muscle." I'm here to tell you, if you'll
[1:23:34] find yourself praying, if you'll find
[1:23:36] yourself in your Bible, if you'll find
[1:23:38] yourself in the royal service, if you'll
[1:23:40] find yourself with better friends, oh,
[1:23:42] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:23:43] We could have a whole church of morning
[1:23:45] stars.
[1:23:47] We could show and prove by not by a
[1:23:50] discernment line. Not by bringing all of
[1:23:52] that back. God already did that. Took it
[1:23:54] around the world all those times. It
[1:23:57] didn't convert the world. It's not going
[1:23:58] to convert the world. The gospel didn't
[1:24:00] come to convert the world. It came to be
[1:24:02] a a declaration to declare the father.
[1:24:07] Jesus already knew this world is passing
[1:24:09] away. This world is not my home. I I'm
[1:24:12] going to preach on that this Sunday.
[1:24:13] Friends, I'm here to tell you I'm
[1:24:15] looking for a world. And while I'm here,
[1:24:17] I want my life to be a modern event made
[1:24:20] clear in prophecy.
[1:24:22] Amen.
[1:24:22] Let's stand to our feet, friends. If
[1:24:24] that's the real desire of your heart
[1:24:26] tonight to say, "Lord God, I've I've
[1:24:29] taken nine sessions and shown us and
[1:24:32] proven by the Bible that none of these
[1:24:34] things that are happening are
[1:24:36] accidental. They cannot be accidental.
[1:24:39] It's impossible. We've we've named too
[1:24:41] many to make them accidental. And we've
[1:24:44] taken you through Daniel's visions and
[1:24:46] shown you the types and show it to you
[1:24:48] in modern headlines and took you through
[1:24:50] the woes and the world and the world
[1:24:52] wars. and we brought it down to our day.
[1:24:54] And then we we hit I was it in part
[1:24:56] seven or part 8. I had to come here the
[1:24:59] very next morning and declare a
[1:25:01] 71-year-old prophecy of a pope from the
[1:25:04] United States. Not from America cuz
[1:25:06] America's North America, Central
[1:25:08] America, South America, but from the
[1:25:09] United States. This day that scripture
[1:25:12] is fulfilled in your hearing.
[1:25:15] We have arrived, my brothers and
[1:25:17] sisters. We have arrived at that hour
[1:25:20] when it's time for the morning stars to
[1:25:22] rise and say, "Lord God, oh I want to be
[1:25:25] a morning star, Lord Jesus, I raise up
[1:25:28] my hands before you tonight, Lord, in
[1:25:30] front of this people. Oh, I want to be a
[1:25:33] morning star. Lord, I realize that that
[1:25:36] you set that as a pattern for your whole
[1:25:39] church body. No man hath seen God at any
[1:25:42] time. The only begotten hath declared
[1:25:44] him, Lord Jesus, it's impossible. You're
[1:25:48] God is a spirit. He has to have a
[1:25:50] manifestation. He's manifested in
[1:25:52] Christ, but he's now manifested in Mrs.
[1:25:54] Jesus Christ.
[1:25:56] And she is declaring the approach of the
[1:25:59] son of God. She is declaring it in her
[1:26:02] life, Lord, that there are not any more
[1:26:05] ages. She is declaring in her life that
[1:26:07] we're in the end of the last one. She's
[1:26:09] declaring it in her life that the world
[1:26:11] cannot and will not just go on and on
[1:26:13] and on.
[1:26:15] We are the last generation that will
[1:26:17] ever be in history, Lord. Oh, I want to
[1:26:19] be I want to be bright and shining. Oh,
[1:26:22] Lord Jesus. I want my whole life, Lord
[1:26:25] God. I don't want Satan to feel familiar
[1:26:27] around me, nothing doing. Lord, I want
[1:26:30] to see them howl and faint at the
[1:26:32] approach of the saints of God of Bethl
[1:26:34] Tabernacle. May you grant it in our
[1:26:35] lives, Lord.
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:38] May you grant it. I realize when I look
[1:26:40] back upon the lives of these great men,
[1:26:42] when I look at our fifth age messenger,
[1:26:44] our sixth age messenger, our seventh age
[1:26:46] messenger, it it wasn't because they
[1:26:50] were a star in your right hand. That was
[1:26:53] the office they held. That was
[1:26:54] pre-ordained by God Almighty. They
[1:26:56] didn't even have a selection in that.
[1:26:58] But Lord, what they did choose, like
[1:27:00] Paul said, you you you had called him as
[1:27:04] an apostle.
[1:27:06] You had called him as a servant, not
[1:27:09] man. Paul said that I wasn't I wasn't
[1:27:11] called by men. He called himself a an
[1:27:15] apostle. Nobody made him that. He didn't
[1:27:17] make himself that. But brother Brandham
[1:27:19] said when he wrote Paul a servant, he
[1:27:21] said now he said that's something you
[1:27:23] have to do. You can be called an
[1:27:26] apostle. You can be called a servant.
[1:27:28] You can be called a child of God. but to
[1:27:30] be a servant of God.
[1:27:33] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:27:35] as brother Brandham said that Paul had
[1:27:37] to decide to do that.
[1:27:40] Lord, I pray tonight that this this
[1:27:44] series as we bring it to this portion of
[1:27:46] it, at least this angle of it on the
[1:27:48] modern events of the world. No doubt,
[1:27:50] Lord, if if any more years would carry
[1:27:53] on, we might end up having to update
[1:27:55] this once more.
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:59] But I
[1:28:01] I can't help but wish that my next time
[1:28:05] I update this sermon will be sitting at
[1:28:07] a marriage supper.
[1:28:09] Oh, I so hope for that, Lord. I so hope
[1:28:12] that that's my next update when I'm
[1:28:14] gathered there with these my people. And
[1:28:16] I'll say, "Remember, church? Remember
[1:28:18] when we were in the earth? I told you we
[1:28:21] were soon to be sitting here. And here
[1:28:22] we are. A modern event made clear
[1:28:27] in prophecy. Sitted at a seated at a
[1:28:30] table thousands of miles long and it's
[1:28:33] over. And a king coming out to wipe our
[1:28:35] tears and say, "Don't cry no more. It's
[1:28:37] all over. It's all over. Sorrow's over.
[1:28:41] Heartache parting, sadness, passing,
[1:28:44] dying. It's all over. You'll never have
[1:28:46] to go back and do that again. What an
[1:28:49] hour that'll be. Lord, keep us true.
[1:28:52] Keep us committed. May our hearts be
[1:28:54] rededicated to you tonight in this
[1:28:55] service. Maybe we didn't come here
[1:28:57] expecting such a pull upon our
[1:28:59] heartstrings, Lord. But that's the way
[1:29:01] the Holy Spirit rolls, Lord. May you
[1:29:04] pull on our heartstrings tonight and
[1:29:06] call for rededication and new commitment
[1:29:08] and a fresh commitment. Give us a fresh
[1:29:11] vision, Lord, that we might press
[1:29:13] forward. The enemy is a liar. He's a
[1:29:16] straight liar. And your word is true,
[1:29:19] Lord. and we love you for the
[1:29:20] reliability of your word.
[1:29:24] I pray you will grant it. Let the words,
[1:29:26] Lord, I if if everything is forgotten,
[1:29:29] just let this final challenge be
[1:29:32] remembered in the hearts of the people.
[1:29:33] God is looking for morning stars.
[1:29:37] The ministry of the morning star, the
[1:29:40] spirit and the bride saying, "Come."
[1:29:44] Esther and the king speaking in one
[1:29:46] unified voice at the time of the feast
[1:29:48] of tabernacles. Right when you're ready
[1:29:50] to go back and restore Israel and take a
[1:29:52] take your bride into a millennial reign.
[1:29:56] That's the time when the king and queen
[1:29:58] spoke in one voice. It's the only time
[1:30:01] in the Bible, Lord. And we thank you for
[1:30:02] that. We know that we have arrived.
[1:30:05] We're here at that time. Commit, Lord,
[1:30:09] everything that was said to the hands of
[1:30:11] the Holy Spirit. Now lead us and guide
[1:30:14] us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Praise
[1:30:18] the Lord. Amen. Come on and gather
[1:30:20] around. It's already a few minutes past
[1:30:21] 8:30. I'm going to take up these prayer
[1:30:24] requests here.
[1:30:26] Sing for me, Brother Brad. Amen.
[1:30:30] Ask
[1:30:32] me not, oh gentle savior,
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:40] hear
[1:30:42] my humble
[1:30:45] cry.
[1:30:49] And while
[1:30:51] on others
[1:30:54] thou art calling,
[1:30:59] do
[1:31:01] not pass
[1:31:03] me by.
[1:31:06] My savior and savior.
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:12] Savior
[1:31:17] here
[1:31:18] my humble
[1:31:21] cry.
[1:31:26] While
[1:31:28] on other
[1:31:30] thou art calling
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:35] do
[1:31:36] not pass
[1:31:39] me by
[1:31:41] raise your hand. Savior, Savior, Savior,
[1:31:48] Savior.
[1:31:50] Oh hallelujah.
[1:31:52] Hear my humble
[1:31:56] ride.
[1:32:01] While
[1:32:03] on others,
[1:32:05] thou art calling.
[1:32:10] Do
[1:32:11] not pass
[1:32:14] me by.
[1:32:19] Sister Linda Paris. Uh prayer request
[1:32:22] for my niece. Uh Don, you can just play
[1:32:25] softly. Brother Andrew. Um Dawn Van Ey.
[1:32:29] She underwent breast surgery on Tuesday
[1:32:32] for damage caused during her successful
[1:32:34] fight with cancer. She's a nominal
[1:32:36] Christian. I love her dearly. Please
[1:32:39] pray for a rapid and total recovery. I
[1:32:41] got an update from Sister Linda today
[1:32:44] because I had prayed for that on
[1:32:45] Tuesday. Thank you for your prayers for
[1:32:47] my niece Dawn. She came through surgery
[1:32:50] very well yesterday and is resting
[1:32:52] relatively pain-free. We thank the Lord
[1:32:54] for that. Want to continue to pray for
[1:32:56] her rapid recovery. Um, Brother Brad and
[1:32:59] Sister Sarah Jce, uh, we will be talking
[1:33:01] with the hospice nurse in a little bit.
[1:33:04] This could go on for a couple weeks, but
[1:33:06] today,
[1:33:07] this was a an early report that she is
[1:33:09] less responsive than she was yesterday.
[1:33:12] We will make a decision tonight or
[1:33:14] tomorrow about when we return home.
[1:33:16] Please help us pray for the Lord's
[1:33:18] perfect leadership. He sent me uh I
[1:33:21] thought that I had it here. Let me go
[1:33:23] back because he sent me a uh an update.
[1:33:27] Sarah's um
[1:33:30] so Sarah's mom hasn't woke up a lot
[1:33:33] today. But then he says she woke up a
[1:33:36] few hours ago and she told Sarah that
[1:33:39] she loved her three or four times. Then
[1:33:41] she went back to sleep and hasn't woke
[1:33:43] back up. Sarah has tried to awaken her,
[1:33:45] but she is not doing good. Her breathing
[1:33:48] is getting heavier and more labored.
[1:33:50] Hospice doesn't expect her to make it
[1:33:52] through the weekend if she makes it that
[1:33:54] far. So, they really need the wisdom of
[1:33:56] God. Will you pray for brother Sister
[1:33:58] Sarah, her mom, the family? Amen. And uh
[1:34:02] they're going to need the Lord's
[1:34:03] leadership on how to handle that. Amen.
[1:34:06] But I know the Lord will make a way. Uh
[1:34:08] we want to pray for sister Amber Smith
[1:34:12] uh in prayer for a flare up of
[1:34:14] diverticulitis. She's been in the bed
[1:34:15] all day. Poor sister suffering with
[1:34:18] that. Just a devil. Uh brother Jack
[1:34:20] writes several requests.
[1:34:23] Please continue uh prayers for complete
[1:34:25] healing of sister Kathy. Her latest
[1:34:27] treatments have had a good result. Also
[1:34:30] ask the church body of Christ to keep
[1:34:31] Sister Kathy in prayer for a visit to
[1:34:33] her hot heart doctor on June 29 to
[1:34:36] follow up on an aneurysm. The Lord that
[1:34:39] took care of the one in the back of her
[1:34:41] head is the same God that can clear this
[1:34:43] one. Amen. Lastly, please remember
[1:34:46] Brother Quincy, the brother that was
[1:34:47] recently baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ. He wrote to tell me he is sick
[1:34:52] with a COVID flu. Sister Jean uh says
[1:34:55] she's on her second run of antibiotics
[1:34:57] for a bad tooth that they need to
[1:34:59] extract and uh it's really given her a
[1:35:02] tough time. So, let's pray for Sister
[1:35:04] Gene. Brother Charles says, "I'm in need
[1:35:06] of prayer for leadership to take my car
[1:35:08] for repair. It's got electrical
[1:35:09] problems. Hope it's not too costly."
[1:35:11] Amen. We know the Lord can just lay his
[1:35:13] hands on vehicles. I sure have seen God
[1:35:15] do it that way. Amen. Join with somebody
[1:35:18] standing near you. Let's pray and take
[1:35:20] these needs up to the Lord.
[1:35:24] Master, we thank you for your word
[1:35:27] tonight. We love you with a great love,
[1:35:30] Lord. And we're inspired, Lord, in our
[1:35:33] hearts tonight. Father, we're we have
[1:35:36] needs that are on the on the hearts of
[1:35:39] the people. We're thanking you for the
[1:35:41] successful procedure of the niece of
[1:35:43] Sister Linda. But now, Lord, a doctor
[1:35:45] can can make the cut and can do the
[1:35:48] surgery, but who heals it, Lord. Who'll
[1:35:50] keep it from reoccurring? That's got to
[1:35:52] be you, Lord. We place the blood of
[1:35:54] Jesus, Lord, over her life and ask you
[1:35:57] to be merciful, Father, for brother Brad
[1:36:00] and sister Sarah to have wisdom for the
[1:36:03] heart of Sister Sarah and grieving for
[1:36:05] her mother. These times are always sad.
[1:36:07] Lord, I pray that you'll strengthen the
[1:36:09] whole family. Let it be a time that
[1:36:12] draws them all close, Father. And may
[1:36:14] you give them supreme wisdom. I've been
[1:36:16] right there. It's hard to know what to
[1:36:18] do in those situations, Lord. You're out
[1:36:20] of town. How can you stay? If you come
[1:36:23] back, do you got to go right back? Lord,
[1:36:24] so many things and brother Brad with
[1:36:27] work waiting and work schedule. It's
[1:36:29] just a tough spot to be in. So I pray
[1:36:31] for your perfect wisdom, Lord. May you
[1:36:34] bring it out for their good. Lord, we
[1:36:36] remember our sister Amber tonight, Lord.
[1:36:38] This demon of diverticulitis, we condemn
[1:36:40] it. I place the blood of Jesus between
[1:36:43] that affliction and the health of our
[1:36:45] sister. And in the name of Jesus, Lord,
[1:36:47] may she be well. May that evil spirit
[1:36:49] that causes these problems be rebuked
[1:36:51] completely. Lord, we're remembering for
[1:36:54] our rapid recovery. We thank you for the
[1:36:56] good results that Sister Kathy has
[1:36:58] already experienced. And Lord, we just
[1:37:00] want to see more and more and more and
[1:37:02] more. We've seen you heal cancer so many
[1:37:04] times. It's nothing for you to heal
[1:37:06] that, Lord. So, come on the scene. And I
[1:37:09] pray that this aneurysm, and we agree
[1:37:11] with brother Jack, the same God who
[1:37:13] fixed the one in the back of her head
[1:37:15] can fix this one over her heart in a
[1:37:17] moment, Father. And we are believing,
[1:37:19] we're remembering, Lord God, his dear
[1:37:21] friend who he baptized, Lord, Brother
[1:37:23] Quincy. And Father, we pray that you
[1:37:25] will let your anointing fall on him that
[1:37:27] he might be healed in his body and this
[1:37:29] terrible COVID flu. Lord, may it be
[1:37:31] cursed of the Holy Spirit and may our
[1:37:33] brother be recovered. Lord, I think of
[1:37:36] Sister Jean and her need, Lord, as we
[1:37:38] age and a tooth going bad, but Lord God,
[1:37:41] you're able. You're still Jehovah Gyra
[1:37:43] or the antibiotics are falling down. May
[1:37:46] the may Jehovah Gyra put his hand upon
[1:37:48] her. May she be made well. Lord God, I
[1:37:52] pray for our dear brother Charles for
[1:37:53] the leadership that he needs. Lord, I've
[1:37:55] seen you heal vehicles. May you lay your
[1:37:58] hand upon his vehicle. Lord, you see the
[1:37:59] brother, father, in the fix that he's in
[1:38:02] to have to repair and spend the money. I
[1:38:04] pray that you have mercy on the case and
[1:38:06] may his car be recovered, Father, in the
[1:38:09] name of Jesus Christ. I already know you
[1:38:11] do it. I've had it done for me more than
[1:38:13] a few times. So, we commit it to you,
[1:38:15] Lord, and ask your great mercy in these
[1:38:18] cases. And upon them all, we speak the
[1:38:21] name of Jesus in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1:38:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's sing some
[1:38:27] more, brother, before we go. And then we
[1:38:28] might hit a testimony or two. If you got
[1:38:30] one, get it ready. Amen. But let's sing
[1:38:32] another verse or two of that.
[1:38:35] Oh, let
[1:38:36] me at thy throne of mercy.
[1:38:44] Find
[1:38:46] a sweet
[1:38:48] relief
[1:38:53] kning
[1:38:55] there in deep control
[1:39:00] is
[1:39:03] help my unbelief.
[1:39:08] [Music]
[1:39:11] Saveior,
[1:39:15] Savior
[1:39:20] and hear
[1:39:22] my humble
[1:39:24] cry.
[1:39:28] Oh, while
[1:39:31] on others
[1:39:33] thou art calling.
[1:39:37] Oh, do
[1:39:39] not pass
[1:39:42] me by.
[1:39:44] Amen. Anybody got a testimony before we
[1:39:46] go? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:48] I do.
[1:39:49] Okay, go ahead, my brother.
[1:39:51] I just want to give the Lord thanks for
[1:39:53] um for healing me so I can actually walk
[1:39:56] normal now. And uh as it's almost healed
[1:40:00] completely and it's been almost 11
[1:40:03] months. Um, I know some people may think
[1:40:08] that it's petty, but uh, in all honesty,
[1:40:12] what I went through with, uh, infection
[1:40:15] in my bone and, um, I couldn't even
[1:40:19] stand up for days at a time and uh, my
[1:40:22] blood pressure was through the roof. I
[1:40:24] thought I was dying a couple of times,
[1:40:26] honestly. and my wife has been just just
[1:40:31] wonderful and just helping me through
[1:40:32] everything. And I'm just uh real
[1:40:35] thankful for the Lord to to get me
[1:40:37] through all of it. So,
[1:40:38] Amen.
[1:40:39] Praise God.
[1:40:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:47] Amen.
[1:40:48] So, you still love him, Sister Beck?
[1:40:50] Right.
