[3:43] [Music]
[3:50] Amen.
[3:52] What a day that'll be. I have a little
[3:55] testimony.
[3:56] Our brother preached surrounded on
[3:58] Sunday. So, Sunday afternoon, we're
[4:01] driving home and um you know, you don't
[4:04] want to text and drive or anything like
[4:05] that.
[4:07] I had a bee in the car.
[4:10] So, I was It came by and I opened the
[4:12] window, thought it got out driving it.
[4:14] It was It came back again. So, I looked
[4:17] over and I'm rolling down the window and
[4:19] she says, "Luther," and I look, I'm on
[4:22] cruise about 66, 67 miles an hour.
[4:25] totally off the road
[4:27] on 462
[4:30] and it's a curve and I'm like and I I
[4:33] didn't think to hit my brakes to get the
[4:36] crews off or anything. I'm just like I
[4:37] just got to get to ease it back on the
[4:39] road. Well, what happens when you hit
[4:40] the asphalt?
[4:42] I was in the other lane facing 90° to
[4:46] the road trying to come back around. Uh
[4:49] you know, you don't want to overorrect.
[4:51] I'm not a a great driver. Just a good
[4:54] one. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But by
[4:57] the grace of God, we ended up back in
[4:59] our lane facing the other lane stopped
[5:02] and there was no cars coming at the time
[5:04] or else it would have been ugly. So we
[5:08] get straightened out and going. There's
[5:09] like a line of about 10 cars and the
[5:11] first car in line is like 20 mph with
[5:13] his hazards on and they probably had
[5:15] eyes about that big. You know, we just
[5:18] kind of drove by and said, "We're
[5:20] surrounded. I'm very thankful to God."
[5:23] Amen. You know, when you don't, you may
[5:27] not see it. Sometimes you may not even
[5:30] realize it.
[5:31] He's watching over you.
[5:33] Amen. Let's pray.
[5:36] Father, I love you and I'm so grateful
[5:38] to you, Father, for your watchful eye. I
[5:42] pray that you bless the service this
[5:44] evening. Bless the song service, Father,
[5:46] as we come to one of the sacraments that
[5:50] you've provided for us, one of the the
[5:52] duties, Lord, foot
[5:54] communion and foot washing. Father,
[5:58] Lord, we come with reverence, respect.
[6:01] We pray that you would be with us this
[6:03] evening, Father,
[6:05] guide us, bring us closer as a family
[6:07] under your hand. And Lord, as we collect
[6:09] the tithes and offerings, I pray that
[6:11] you'd bless the cheerful giver. Father
[6:14] God, there's you're just so much higher
[6:17] than we are. And I'm thankful for your
[6:19] watchful hand.
[6:21] Bless your people now. We pray in Jesus
[6:24] name. Amen.
[6:27] [Music]

[12:39] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[12:40] He's worthy. Hallelujah.
[12:44] Amen. You can be seated just for a
[12:46] moment. We're going to um just have just
[12:49] a little presentation
[12:51] um just here uh just for a moment. Got
[12:53] two announcements I wanted to make. Both
[12:55] of them are youth related and I know
[12:58] these announcements have went out uh
[13:00] multiple times on WhatsApp and different
[13:02] groups. So uh we are using the uh PA
[13:07] system, the public address system to
[13:09] announce to the church and everybody
[13:11] who's streaming uh live and those that
[13:13] will listen to this. We just want to
[13:15] announce again our meetings uh the youth
[13:17] meetings that are coming up here on July
[13:21] 28th, 29th, and 30th. And so that's with
[13:25] brother Daryl Ward, July 28th, 29, and
[13:27] 30. We have a flyer there on what's on
[13:29] uh Facebook and also on YouTube. And
[13:33] that uh 28th service will just be a
[13:36] regular uh youth service here at the
[13:39] Church with Brother Daryl. And then the
[13:41] 29th, on the morning of the 29th, the
[13:43] Saturday, there will be activities at
[13:45] the YMCA, we have uh reserved and rented
[13:48] to have just a youth day with
[13:50] activities. A little too hot to be
[13:51] outside in July in Buford. So, we didn't
[13:54] want to go to the park, so we're going
[13:55] to have that there. Uh and then that
[13:58] night at 700 p.m. Correction, the flyer
[14:01] says 6, but it's actually at 7. So, the
[14:04] banquet is going to be at 700 p.m. 700
[14:07] p.m. at Urban Brew. And so we'll we you
[14:10] can go on and get all the details for
[14:12] that. Then Sunday morning will be the
[14:13] main service with the whole church. And
[14:17] uh what is imperative is that we have
[14:21] dropped the numbers to be able to fit
[14:23] where we've the last two years we've I
[14:25] think we've registered 160 kids so that
[14:28] we're not doing that this year. We're
[14:30] we're going to fill it up at 85 Jay. Is
[14:32] that right Brad? 85 uh people kids total
[14:36] uh young people. And so our own youth,
[14:40] our own uh young people here need to
[14:42] make sure that you get on and you
[14:44] register um as soon as you can. It's a
[14:47] cost of $35 right on the flyer. If you
[14:50] don't have the information, get with
[14:51] Brother Brad. He sent it to the youth
[14:53] and the parents of the youth multiple
[14:54] times, but you want to make sure you get
[14:56] registered. Also, our youth camp is uh
[14:59] coming up. Going to be here before you
[15:00] know it. We're excited about that. And
[15:02] so, we just want to show you just a
[15:04] little presentation video. Um, go ahead
[15:06] and uh and get that ready to be played.
[15:08] If we could unmute the computer, make
[15:10] sure we got lots of volume. Amen. Show
[15:12] you this.
[15:31] Each generation has it own.
[15:36] at the word.
[15:40] We are not here for partial births.
[15:45] We not come to see a bunch of stillborn
[15:47] babies even. But we want real true born
[15:51] again sons and daughters of God that are
[15:54] quickened to life by the baptism of the
[15:56] Holy Ghost.
[15:59] Hallelujah. That'll put up power in you.
[16:02] that'll make the word live.
[16:05] If you and I could only see who we are
[16:07] today and you look around and the Lord I
[16:11] never know you're not. There's more with
[16:13] us than there are within
[16:17] the odds are hail your destiny has
[16:21] already been determined. You are going
[16:23] to make it.
[16:24] Bethl Tabernacle would like to invite
[16:26] you again to our third annual fall youth
[16:29] camp. We have been blessed in our
[16:31] endeavor to upgrade our facility this
[16:33] year and we're looking forward to
[16:34] sharing it with you. Carolina Point is
[16:36] located in the spectacular Blue Ridge
[16:39] Mountains just 45 minutes west of our
[16:41] former location. As in previous years,
[16:44] you can expect to enjoy exciting revival
[16:46] weekend filled with memorable chapel
[16:48] services and outpourings of the Holy
[16:50] Ghost as well as times of worship,
[16:53] instruction, and engagement activities.
[16:56] Our special guest speakers this year
[16:58] will be brother Donnie Reagan and
[17:00] brother Josh Bannon as well as special
[17:03] devotions and worship with brother Barry
[17:05] Coffee and brother Cadre Digs.
[17:09] There's an impressive number of
[17:11] activities and sports available on this
[17:13] campground including whiffle ball,
[17:16] botchi ball, basketball, volleyball and
[17:19] soccer, archery tag, frisbee golf,
[17:23] go-karts, and indoor rec center filled
[17:26] with ping pong and foosball tables, as
[17:29] well as the trail head to the peak of
[17:31] Sasa Press Mountain, which is the
[17:33] highest peak in South Carolina. One of
[17:35] the upgrades we're most excited about is
[17:37] the cafeteria building. It features a
[17:40] large open space designed for family
[17:42] style dining which can accommodate all
[17:45] campers at once. So no more need for
[17:47] separate meal times or wristands.
[17:51] Complete with immaculate dorms, a
[17:53] spacious chapel, and an easy to navigate
[17:56] campus. This campground is sure to
[17:58] facilitate an outstanding weekend. Camp
[18:01] will be held one week earlier this year
[18:03] from Thursday, October 19th through
[18:06] Sunday, October 22nd. Registration opens
[18:09] on June 19th and is $189 per person.
[18:14] Available spots will fill up quickly, so
[18:16] be sure to mark your calendar. The link
[18:18] to register can be found on our church
[18:20] website at bethl-tab.org,
[18:23] or our church youth website, bethl
[18:26] youthcamp.org. If you're an adult
[18:28] wishing to be part of our volunteer
[18:30] staff, please email us at info@ bethol
[18:34] youthcamp.org.
[18:35] We're in great expectation and
[18:38] anticipation for this year's special
[18:40] time in the presence of the Lord. We're
[18:42] believing that there will be a mighty
[18:44] outpouring of the Holy Ghost to bring
[18:46] healing and restoration to fill and
[18:48] refill with the Holy Ghost and to bring
[18:51] total deliverance to the captives. We
[18:53] are confessing a total binding of the
[18:55] enemy and the loosing of God's children.
[18:58] We look forward to seeing you at Beth
[19:00] Youth Camp this year in Carolina Point.
[19:03] May God richly bless you.
[19:09] What was your favorite part of camp?
[19:11] Making new friends.
[19:12] Hanging out with everybody.
[19:14] Bonfire. Bonfire. Making new friends.
[19:18] Oo. Favorite part? Honestly, just seeing
[19:19] this beautiful fall around the lake.
[19:21] The friends and the bonfires. That's
[19:24] really the bonfire.
[19:27] A lot of confirmed things in my heart in
[19:29] the prayer line.
[19:30] The bonfires.
[19:31] Getting a closer walk with the Lord.
[19:33] Everything. Everything was amazing.
[19:35] Services, the views, not the walking.
[19:37] So, that was a good part, but everything
[19:39] else was amazing.
[19:40] The skip, that was really good.
[19:43] It was perfect. Definitely the services.
[19:45] Probably the services and hanging out
[19:46] with friends.
[19:47] Definitely the services. Absolutely.
[19:50] When the spirit of the Lord would move
[19:52] to watch the reaction of the people was
[19:54] priceless.
[19:56] Last night's service was awesome.
[19:57] The services and kayaking. The Saturday
[19:59] night service.
[20:00] The services.
[20:01] The services. What was your favorite
[20:03] part of
[20:03] the services?
[20:07] [Music]
[20:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. Looking forward
[20:20] to that. Amen. We're going to carry on
[20:22] with the um communion and footwashing
[20:25] service. I'm going to turn it back over
[20:26] to brother Matt just in a moment. I
[20:28] wanted to just uh give you a little bit
[20:29] of an update. I went back uh today for a
[20:33] follow-up visit. The u opthalmologist
[20:36] was very happy to say that uh it's
[20:39] continuing to improve and she can see
[20:40] improvement in all areas. And so that
[20:43] was a really really good report.
[20:46] Um, she did reemphasize that, you know,
[20:50] that uh that I do have certain
[20:52] restraints on me over the next six weeks
[20:54] because this is my second bout of
[20:57] shingles and I've got to make sure that
[20:58] it's completely defeated this time. I
[21:01] had had the plan to uh announce to you
[21:04] and actually even have already got one
[21:07] one session under my belt uh to take
[21:10] Sunday schools and Wednesdays and and do
[21:13] a teaching series. I am going to do
[21:15] that, but I uh better part of wisdom has
[21:18] suggested that I not try to do it while
[21:21] I'm still uh affected by this. I can't
[21:24] be up here. The last time the lights
[21:26] even the very next day on Monday, it had
[21:29] had a negative effect on me. So, amen.
[21:32] And try as I might, I have a hard time
[21:35] keeping that my pedal off my foot off
[21:37] the gas pedal. And um so I someone one
[21:41] brother said, "Well, you got an A+ for
[21:43] effort." And I said, "What?" He go,
[21:45] "Well, you got a B minus for execution."
[21:47] So so I said, "Well, I'll take it." But
[21:50] so so we we are going to do that. I've
[21:52] had many many many requests for that.
[21:55] And we are going to take some teaching
[21:56] series on that, but I'm going to have to
[21:58] wait. Uh so I'm going to stand down from
[22:01] all forms of ministry through the end of
[22:03] June, and the ministry team here will
[22:06] pick up the slack. I'm glad we have a
[22:08] ministry team. Amen. Who can do that for
[22:11] us. Amen. God, God bless you, brother
[22:13] Matt. Come and sing another song for us.
[22:15] Amen. As we carry on in the service. God
[22:17] bless you.
[22:19] [Music]
[22:22] Abundance of mats. Let's all stand and
[22:25] change the order of the service.
[22:28] Oh, the love of God
[22:33] is greater far
[22:38] than tongue or pain
[22:41] [Music]
[22:43] can ever tell.
[22:49] It goes beyond
[22:54] the highest star
[22:58] [Music]
[23:00] and reaches to
[23:05] the lowest hill.
[23:10] The guilty pair
[23:15] bow down with care.
[23:21] God gave his son
[23:27] to win
[23:31] his
[23:33] child.
[23:37] be reconciled
[23:42] and pardoned from

[24:23] the saints and a
[24:28] gel song.
[24:33] Would we with
[24:38] the ocean filled?
[24:42] [Music]
[24:43] And were the skies
[24:48] a parchment made?
[24:54] Were every soul
[24:59] on earth a queen
[25:04] and every man
[25:09] ascribe my dream
[25:14] to ride the love
[25:19] of God above.

[26:19] more.
[26:23] [Music]
[26:34] Amen. Don't you appreciate the love of
[26:36] God? Amen. I believe that's really what
[26:38] communion is all about. Amen. It's a
[26:41] love relationship. Amen. to have
[26:43] communion with our Lord. Amen. We want
[26:47] to sing the song together before we read
[26:49] the scripture in 1 Corinthians. Create
[26:50] in me a clean heart. Just had the song
[26:52] upon my heart. Create
[26:55] in me a clean heart,
[27:03] oh God,
[27:09] and renew arise spirit
[27:14] within
[27:15] me.
[27:18] You want to make that a prayer? Sing
[27:19] that again with your hands raised.
[27:22] Create in me
[27:25] a clean heart,
[27:30] oh
[27:32] God,
[27:36] and renew the right spirit
[27:41] within
[27:42] me.
[27:44] [Music]
[27:46] Here's my prayer, Lord. Cast me not
[27:48] away, and cast me not away
[27:54] from thy presence,
[27:59] oh Lord,
[28:02] and take
[28:04] not thy holy
[28:07] spirit from me,
[28:13] [Applause]
[28:14] but restore Lord,
[28:18] unto me
[28:21] all the joy of thy salvation.
[28:28] Oh,
[28:29] and renew arise spirit
[28:34] within me. One more time. Cast me not
[28:38] away.
[28:40] Lord
[28:42] cast me not away
[28:48] from thy presence.
[28:52] Oh,
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] and take
[28:57] not thy whole
[29:00] spirit from me.
[29:08] God restore
[29:10] unto me
[29:13] [Music]
[29:14] all the joy.
[29:17] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[29:21] Oh,
[29:23] and renew arise spirit
[29:27] within
[29:29] me.
[29:34] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[29:38] Hallelujah.
[29:40] You can be seated just for a moment.
[29:41] We're going to Amen and you can just
[29:43] keep playing that for me. I just wanted
[29:45] to um speak just for just a minute uh
[29:48] before we read the scripture and then
[29:50] we'll have brother Luther come. 1
[29:52] Corinthians
[29:54] uh chapter 11, very familiar.
[29:57] You know, I thought of this word when I
[29:59] was even just contemplating today and
[30:01] just meditating knowing we'd have a
[30:03] communion service. And I believe
[30:05] communion is so important. It's it's uh
[30:09] one of the three ordinances that the
[30:11] Lord Jesus left us. Brother Brandham
[30:13] said, "I believe every Christian ought
[30:15] to partake of communion." Not miss it.
[30:18] Communion, not just communion, but
[30:20] footwashing also. And it's a way for us
[30:23] to express oursel to even the Bible,
[30:25] we're going to read it here in a moment,
[30:27] says, "Terry, one for another." And you
[30:29] know, when brother Brandon picks that up
[30:31] and he says, "What does that mean?" It
[30:32] means you're to wait on each other. that
[30:34] this is a time of examination. You know,
[30:37] it's it's a check or balance. The checks
[30:39] and balances that God puts in the church
[30:41] to keep it in order, to keep our lives
[30:43] in order. It's a it's a way for us to
[30:45] measure to measure ourselves against the
[30:48] word. It's a way for us to make our
[30:50] calling and election sure. It's a sober
[30:52] time. Communion's a a sobering moment uh
[30:56] just for us to examine our lives,
[30:59] examine our uh uh you know, our our
[31:02] ways. But at the same time, it's a more
[31:05] than that. It's the overarching
[31:07] principle is to remember the Lord.
[31:09] And so that's why we're here tonight is
[31:11] to remember not ourselves,
[31:14] but a perfect sacrifice, a perfect lamb
[31:17] who was sacrificed for us because we in
[31:20] ourselves, none of us would say that
[31:22] we're worthy to take communion. Brother
[31:25] Adam says, you know who's worthy to take
[31:26] communion? Any Christian is worthy to
[31:29] take communion. Any Christian. Now,
[31:32] that's a powerful statement. Any
[31:34] Christian's worthy to take communion,
[31:36] not your own worthiness, not in
[31:38] something that you look at yourself or
[31:40] uh how good you are or whether you
[31:42] measure up or not. But brother Brandham
[31:44] says if we take it unworthily, now we
[31:46] know that we're not worthy in ourselves.
[31:49] None of us are. I'd raise my hand and
[31:51] say yes.
[31:53] But that we are not trusting in our own
[31:56] worthiness.
[31:57] We're trusting in him.
[32:00] We're trusting in his worthiness that we
[32:02] have, now listen, all he says this, that
[32:04] we have died to our own thinking and
[32:07] just think his thoughts and live to
[32:10] everything that we believe he commands
[32:13] us to and look back and see what we're
[32:17] living and look our life over. You know,
[32:19] I spoke on that the last Sunday I spoke
[32:21] here. Church is a unique place so
[32:24] important and essential in our life.
[32:27] It's a place where we can contemplate,
[32:29] where we could come with open hearts and
[32:31] hear. No other place you'll go to to
[32:34] where the word, not a man, but the word
[32:36] is judging our lives.
[32:38] Now, that's what a real Christian wants
[32:40] to say, Lord, let your word judge me. As
[32:42] brother Brandham said, let me stand in
[32:44] judgment now so I'm not judged there.
[32:46] Let me receive my judgment here. And he
[32:49] says, we're to look at our lives to look
[32:50] back and see what we're living and to
[32:53] look over look over our life again. And
[32:55] if we're doing things that's not worthy
[32:57] of the gospel, then we shouldn't take
[32:59] communion.
[32:59] Wow.
[33:00] Now, Brother Brandham talks about that
[33:02] and he says, "If you're out here
[33:03] claiming one thing, but you're out in
[33:05] the barroom or you're telling dirty
[33:06] jokes or you're listening to rock and
[33:08] roll music and your life, you know, I'm
[33:10] not talking about mistakes, but you have
[33:12] a lifestyle that's that's not worthy of
[33:14] the gospel."
[33:16] And he says, "If you know, if you know,
[33:18] that's the Holy Spirit pointing to you."
[33:21] In other words, convicting saying, "You
[33:22] know you're not a real believer. you
[33:24] know that your life doesn't measure up.
[33:26] You're not you're just you know that
[33:27] you're not a real Christian. You're not
[33:29] living the life uh of Christ and you're
[33:31] not your life's not worthy of the
[33:32] gospel. He says if that's you and he
[33:35] says you look back and he says and he
[33:37] says then don't don't take communion.
[33:40] You know, that's amazing because if you
[33:43] think about that, the ordinance that's
[33:44] left in the church, that's something
[33:46] that to a real son or daughter of God,
[33:49] if you had sin in your life and
[33:50] something that would prevent you from
[33:52] taking communion, that ought to turn
[33:54] something on in you to say, "Lord, I
[33:56] want to turn my life around. I want to
[33:58] repent of all of my sins. I want to be a
[34:00] real believer."
[34:01] This is what communion should produce in
[34:03] our churches. It should clean us all
[34:05] out.
[34:06] Amen. We don't want none of the world.
[34:07] How many how many would I do identify
[34:09] and say we don't want the filthiness of
[34:11] the world in our church. Don't let it be
[34:13] found in me, Lord. Let me have a place
[34:15] of purity and holiness.
[34:17] Brother Brandham says, "But if you feel
[34:18] that you're living, that you look back
[34:20] and see that all your sins, and we've
[34:24] all got them, are confessed and under
[34:27] the blood, then you're supposed to take
[34:29] that. You're a part of it.
[34:32] You're a part of it.
[34:34] So that's why we're to examine
[34:35] ourselves, you know, because I can
[34:37] examine you and I could see maybe a
[34:39] perfect life, but you know, and and not
[34:42] not a able to discern your heart, not
[34:44] know you. None of us could discern each
[34:46] other. None of us could bring real
[34:47] conviction. We could look at the outside
[34:49] of someone and judge them. But you know,
[34:51] that's not what we're called to do.
[34:53] But with what you say, brother Matt,
[34:54] then what brings judgment to my life?
[34:56] The Holy Ghost.
[34:58] The Holy Ghost will convict you. I don't
[34:59] need to answer whether you you can take
[35:01] communion or don't take take communion.
[35:03] The Holy Ghost will answer that in your
[35:05] heart.
[35:05] The Holy Ghost will convict you and tell
[35:07] you, you know, you're not right.
[35:09] Or or you can say, "Lord, I know that
[35:10] I've sinned and I've made mistakes, but
[35:12] I want to confess them right now."
[35:14] And I want to walk worthy before you.
[35:17] First Corinthians chapter 11, let's all
[35:19] stand to our feet.
[35:26] For I have received of the Lord. Verse
[35:28] 3, 1 Corinthians chap 11. Those that
[35:30] have Bibles, that's wonderful. I'll wait
[35:32] for you just to First Corinth, 1
[35:33] Corinthians chapter 11. I'll wait for
[35:35] you to uh to get to that.
[35:44] [Music]
[35:52] 1 Corinthians 11:23.
[35:54] I had it printed in my notes and not my
[35:56] scripture. Verse 23. For I have received
[35:59] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[36:02] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[36:05] night in which he was betrayed took
[36:06] bread and when he had given thanks, he
[36:10] broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is
[36:12] my body which is broken for you. This do
[36:16] in remembrance of who?"
[36:20] So who are we to remember tonight?
[36:22] Not ourselves. We're under the blood.
[36:26] We remember him. This do you in
[36:29] remembrance
[36:30] of me.
[36:33] And when he had given thanks.
[36:37] Verse 26. For as often as you eat this
[36:39] bread and drink this cup, you do show
[36:42] the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore
[36:44] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[36:47] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[36:50] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[36:53] Lord. That's why it's important. But let
[36:56] a man examine himself
[36:59] and so let him eat of that bread and
[37:02] drink of that cup. For he that eateth
[37:05] and drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[37:07] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[37:10] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[37:13] cause many are weak and sickly among
[37:15] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[37:18] judge ourselves, we should not be
[37:21] judged. Notice this verse 32. But when
[37:24] we are judged, we are chasened of the
[37:27] Lord that we should not be condemned
[37:30] with the world. Who judges me? The word.
[37:34] That's my judgment.
[37:36] The word. We're not living up to the So
[37:38] you say, "Brother Matt, what happens if
[37:40] we're judged and we're not living up to
[37:41] the word?" Then the Lord chastens you.
[37:44] Not man, but God will chasen your life.
[37:46] That's what what we're reading right
[37:47] here. We're chasened of the Lord. And
[37:50] when the Lord chastens us, Brother
[37:51] Brandham said, "What does that mean?"
[37:53] It's not like a It's not just a whapon
[37:55] or a spanking, but Brother Brandham says
[37:57] he brings correction to our life. That's
[37:59] the purpose of chastening. It's to
[38:01] correct us. And I say, Lord, I want to
[38:03] be like David. I want to say, Lord, see
[38:05] if there be any wicked way in me. And if
[38:08] there is, Lord, correct my life. I want
[38:11] to be corrected. Wherefore, my brethren,
[38:14] when you come together to eat, tarry one
[38:19] for another. Brother Brandham says this
[38:21] in the message communion in 1963. He
[38:24] says, "I pray for you that if there's
[38:27] some sin in you, some unrighteous deed
[38:29] or something that you've done as a
[38:31] believer, I pray that God will take it
[38:33] out of you, that he'll forgive you for
[38:35] it. and you pray for me that if there's
[38:39] something that I've done that I don't
[38:41] know just about, if I've done it and
[38:42] know it's wrong, I'd confess it right
[38:45] now, I'm fixing to because he that
[38:47] eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eat and
[38:50] drinks damnation to himself, not
[38:53] discerning the Lord's body. We don't
[38:56] want the world in here. Amen, brother
[38:58] Brandon. This little spot of people that
[39:00] God has given us to worship with here,
[39:03] we want to keep ourselves clean. How
[39:05] many would raise a hand and say, "That's
[39:07] my desire." Clean from selfishness.
[39:10] Keep ourselves from sin. Live our lives
[39:13] clean from all the things of the world
[39:15] that we be not spotted with that. We
[39:18] want to be ready for the rapture. Now,
[39:21] Brother Brandham does something that I'm
[39:22] going to do here tonight just for a
[39:24] moment. And when he takes this scripture
[39:26] where in the very last one we read,
[39:28] "Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[39:30] together to eat, tar one for another."
[39:33] Here's what we're going to do as the
[39:34] prophet did. We're just going to pray
[39:36] silently. I'm not going to pray out
[39:37] loud. I want you to bow your heads with
[39:39] me. And I want you to pray for each
[39:41] other. And brother Brandham says, I want
[39:43] you to pray for each other and say,
[39:45] Lord, if there's any sin in my brother's
[39:46] life, any anything that wouldn't be like
[39:48] you, would you would you bring repent?
[39:50] Would you bring conviction to his heart
[39:52] and let him repent of it right now? Now,
[39:54] if you're doing that for for your
[39:55] brother and they're doing it for you and
[39:57] I'm doing it for you, I believe the Lord
[39:58] can honor that. Let's just take a moment
[40:00] and then we'll pray together just for a
[40:02] moment in silence here.
[40:31] Let it be, Lord Jesus.
[40:34] All of our sins,
[40:37] all of Lord, the things that where we
[40:39] don't measure up and we don't line up.
[40:42] Let it be, Lord, that all of our sins
[40:44] would be under the blood at this moment.
[40:46] Lord, I repent of it, Jesus. God of
[40:50] everything Lord that would be unlike
[40:52] you. anything in my heart, Lord. Let me
[40:54] take my opportunity right now to say,
[40:57] "Forgive me, Lord Jesus.
[41:00] May it be in the forgetfulness
[41:03] of your recollection." I pray, God,
[41:06] as we come together, Lord, to take
[41:08] communion as a family, cuz that's what
[41:10] this church is, Lord. All families,
[41:13] brothers and sisters,
[41:16] believers, and children of Christ. Lord,
[41:20] I pray God that you would just come and
[41:21] commune with us, Lord, now as we wait on
[41:24] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:26] Christ.
[41:28] [Music]
[41:32] Cast me not
[41:36] away
[41:38] from thy presence,
[41:43] oh Lord.
[41:46] Take not
[41:47] and take
[41:50] not thy holy
[41:54] spirit from me.
[41:57] [Music]
[41:59] Could you raise your hand now and sing
[42:00] it? Restore, restore
[42:05] us to me
[42:09] all the joy
[42:12] of thy
[42:14] salvation
[42:17] and renew
[42:19] and renew. Arise spirit. You want to
[42:24] sing that one more time to the Lord now
[42:26] as a prayer. Lift up your hands and your
[42:29] voice.
[42:30] Oh
[42:31] [Music]
[42:33] Lord, cast me not
[42:37] away
[42:40] from thy presence.
[42:44] Yes, Lord.

[42:55] spirit from me.
[42:58] Restore
[43:04] [Music]

[43:15] salvation
[43:18] and renew
[43:20] and renew. the right spirit
[43:25] within
[43:27] me.
[43:28] [Music]
[43:29] Now, Lord, we just turn our eyes to you
[43:31] right now, God, as we prepare to take
[43:35] your supper, Lord, and remember you,
[43:37] Father. I pray that you'd come and
[43:38] accompany us, Lord, in this line. As
[43:40] people come and Father, and partake of,
[43:44] Lord, the elements, I pray, God, that
[43:46] your your spirit would just commune with
[43:48] us. May this be a special time, Lord, in
[43:50] your presence. We ask it in Jesus
[43:53] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. We're going
[43:56] to start here with Sister Emily. When
[43:58] you come around, just uh make your way
[44:00] through here and then circle back around
[44:02] until we're going through it. And maybe
[44:04] if the musicians could dismiss, except
[44:05] for Sister Deborah, we'll get you last
[44:08] just to have a piano. Brother Matthew,
[44:09] why don't you sing also? Just if you
[44:12] could while we're taking communion, just
[44:14] sing some worship songs, something upon
[44:16] your heart. Okay.
[44:20] create
[44:25] clean.
[44:27] [Music]

[53:44] John chapter 13 St. John.
[53:54] Just going to read this portion of
[53:55] scripture and then we'll dismiss the
[53:57] brothers. with the
[54:00] computer, the music, the pre-ervice
[54:02] music, if we could have that ready for
[54:04] when we dismiss St. John chapter 13. Now
[54:08] before the feast of the Passover, when
[54:10] Jesus knew that his hour was come, that
[54:12] he should depart out of this world unto
[54:14] the Father, having loved his own which
[54:17] were in the world, he loved them unto
[54:19] the end. supper being ended, the devil
[54:22] having now put into the heart of Judas's
[54:24] Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him.
[54:27] Jesus, knowing that the Father had given
[54:29] all things into his hands, and that he
[54:31] was come from God, and went to God, he
[54:35] riseth from supper, laid aside his
[54:37] garments, and took a towel, and gerted
[54:39] himself. After that, he poured water
[54:42] into a basin, and began to wash the
[54:44] disciples feet, and to wipe them with
[54:47] the towel wherewith he was girded. Then
[54:50] cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter said
[54:52] unto him,"Lord, dust thou wash my feet?"
[54:56] Jesus answered and said unto him, "What
[54:58] I do, thou knowest not now, but thou
[55:00] shalt know hereafter." Peter said unto
[55:03] him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet."
[55:06] Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not,
[55:08] thou has no part with me." Simon Peter
[55:11] said unto him, Lord, not only my feet,
[55:14] but also my hands and my head. Jesus
[55:16] said unto him, "He that is washed
[55:18] needeth not saved to wash his feet, but
[55:21] is clean every wit. And you are clean,
[55:23] but not all. For he knew who should
[55:25] betray him. Therefore he said he, you
[55:28] are not all clean." So after he had
[55:31] washed their feet and had taken his
[55:33] garment and was set down again, he said
[55:35] unto them, "Know you what I have done to
[55:38] you? You call me Master and Lord, and
[55:41] you say well, for so I am. If I then,
[55:45] your Lord and Master, have washed your
[55:47] feet, you also ought to wash one
[55:50] another's feet. For I have given you an
[55:53] example, that you should do as I have
[55:56] done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto
[55:59] you, the servant is not greater than his
[56:00] Lord, neither he that is sent greater
[56:03] than he that sent him. If you know these
[56:06] things, happy are you if you do them.
[56:09] This time we're going to dismiss the
[56:11] brothers to the fellowship poll. Man,
[56:14] they can go ahead and play that.
[56:17] Good.

[1:22:24] Yes, Lord.
[1:22:27] Amen. Let's sing that song now.
[1:22:31] Going from Emanuel's veins. We got some
[1:22:33] prayer requests we're going to look at
[1:22:34] here tonight. I'm just going to read
[1:22:36] them to you. Amen. It's our Wednesday
[1:22:38] night also prayer service. We're not
[1:22:39] going to gather. We're just going to
[1:22:41] read these and then we'll pray. Uh,
[1:22:43] Brother Bruce and Sister Linda Paris
[1:22:46] writes in and says, "Would you please
[1:22:48] remember a friend of ours who just lost
[1:22:50] her mom? Her name is Pamela Flynn. We
[1:22:54] trust the Lord Jesus is providing relief
[1:22:56] guarding the shingles and especially
[1:22:58] your eye. God bless you and we're
[1:23:00] constant. We're certainly looking
[1:23:01] forward to the communion service this
[1:23:03] evening. So I know brother Bruce, sister
[1:23:04] Linda, God bless you who are streaming.
[1:23:06] We certainly want to remember um a
[1:23:09] friend of theirs who just lost her mom
[1:23:11] Pamela Flynn. Brother Josh Mhouse writes
[1:23:13] in and says, "Hey, brother Jason.
[1:23:15] Requesting prayer tonight. I've been
[1:23:16] under the weather with a head, chest,
[1:23:18] and throat cold since Saturday." Amen.
[1:23:21] We want to remember our brother Josh. My
[1:23:23] aunt Lisa writes in and says Samuel is
[1:23:26] going to be rebaptized by Tom by brother
[1:23:29] Tom tonight after the preaching. Would
[1:23:32] you please pray the supernatural peace
[1:23:34] of God will settle over Samuel's mind
[1:23:36] and spirit and that the Lord will
[1:23:38] deliver him of all fear also that God
[1:23:41] will either fill or refill him with the
[1:23:44] supernatural outpouring of the Holy
[1:23:47] Ghost. And I pray for that. my memo also
[1:23:50] who I guess wrote the same thing in um
[1:23:53] just called me to tell me the uh that
[1:23:55] he's got a real serious need. Um and so
[1:23:58] we want to just take that very seriously
[1:24:01] uh that if the Lord doesn't touch him in
[1:24:03] a supernatural way and we believe in a
[1:24:06] supernatural God and I believe even in
[1:24:08] this prayer the Holy Spirit could go on
[1:24:09] the wings of this prayer and touch
[1:24:11] Samuel. He's a precious precious young
[1:24:14] man. if you don't know him, just a
[1:24:16] wonderful spirited boy. And the the
[1:24:18] devil is just trying to afflict him and
[1:24:20] attack his mind. And so we need we we
[1:24:23] desperately need the Lord to touch him
[1:24:25] in a supernatural way. Will you do that?
[1:24:27] Amen. Put your arm over on that person
[1:24:29] that's beside you. Let's just call on
[1:24:30] the Lord. Amen. For these requests, Lord
[1:24:33] Jesus. Father, right now we bind our
[1:24:36] faith together, Lord. Our licks of fire,
[1:24:38] God. Father, there's strength in
[1:24:40] numbers, Lord God, because it's more
[1:24:42] voices and faith, Lord, that we come
[1:24:44] together and your prophet said that
[1:24:46] faith accumulates,
[1:24:48] Lord. So right now, oh God, may you
[1:24:50] receive, Lord, the prayers that are
[1:24:52] being lifted up on behalf of these
[1:24:54] needs, Lord. Jesus, you see this need
[1:24:56] for Brother Bruce, Sister Paris's sister
[1:24:59] Linda Paris's friend, Lord, who lost her
[1:25:01] mom, Pamela Flynn. God of all comfort
[1:25:04] and grace, would you go to them right
[1:25:06] now, Lord Jesus? I pray that you would
[1:25:08] just touch her, Lord Jesus, in her mind
[1:25:10] or spirit. Brother Josh's body, Lord,
[1:25:13] who's home tonight, Satan, you're a liar
[1:25:16] and we come against you, thou foul
[1:25:18] spirit of sickness. I pray, God, that
[1:25:20] you would bring healing to my brother
[1:25:22] Josh right now. Lord, for Samuel, God, I
[1:25:25] pray, God, for a supernatural touch.
[1:25:27] Lord, there's other believers in
[1:25:28] Washington even now, Lord, that are
[1:25:30] preparing for service and tonight will
[1:25:32] be baptized. Lord, we believe that
[1:25:34] you're the God of the supernatural, that
[1:25:36] you care, Lord, about our needs and our
[1:25:39] affliction. Lord, you said that's what
[1:25:41] you were sent for, to bind up our
[1:25:43] wounds, to heal the broken, Lord God.
[1:25:45] And you know Samuel's mind, and you know
[1:25:47] the spirit of fear that's trying to come
[1:25:49] upon him. I curse that in the name of
[1:25:51] the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, may on
[1:25:54] the wings of this prayer, an anointing
[1:25:56] of healing, would it come all over
[1:25:58] Samuel's body, Father, may the promises
[1:26:00] of your word be his tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:03] We pray, Father, for every need, Lord,
[1:26:05] as we lift them up to you that didn't
[1:26:07] get a chance to write it down. Great
[1:26:10] Jehovah Gyra, would you come and meet
[1:26:11] the needs of your children? We ask in
[1:26:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. There
[1:26:18] is
[1:26:19] a fountain
[1:26:22] filled
[1:26:24] with blood
[1:26:26] from
[1:26:28] Emmanuel's
[1:26:31] face.
