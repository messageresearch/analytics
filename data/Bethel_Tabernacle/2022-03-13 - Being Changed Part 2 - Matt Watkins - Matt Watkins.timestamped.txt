[5:55] prayer for a thyroid ultrasound that i
[5:57] have tomorrow
[5:59] they found a growth about two years ago
[6:00] and has grown since then and is causing
[6:02] some pain and other symptoms
[6:04] i know this is just a lie from the devil

[40:12] the word romans chapter 7 thank you for
[40:15] all that worship amen romans chapter 7
[40:18] we just like to
[40:19] carry on from where we were
[40:22] last time we spoke on this thought i
[40:25] sent a powerpoint if you have that you
[40:26] could just have it ready romans chapter
[40:28] 7.
[40:29] amen appreciated all that singing and
[40:31] those specials amen that worship
[40:34] amen that we had brother matthew uh sang
[40:37] a song this morning that i just
[40:40] i can't tell you how much it meant to me
[40:42] personally knowing what direction i
[40:43] would go and what i'm preaching on just
[40:44] was the mind of the lord
[40:46] so appreciate that and um don't you just
[40:49] love him
[40:50] amen is any good to us i want to pray
[40:52] for the ministry that's away i think we
[40:54] got every preacher except matthew me
[40:56] matthew and caleb all the rest of them
[40:57] are gone uh my dad's away brother brad's
[41:01] away brother jd's away and so just pray
[41:04] for their services this morning i know
[41:06] brother jason's in a different time zone
[41:08] but the brad was ministering even
[41:10] earlier uh this morning he sent a prayer
[41:12] request for him
[41:14] so but we're here and the lord jesus is
[41:16] everywhere
[41:18] you believe that he's everywhere
[41:20] amen all the time
[41:22] romans chapter 7 we just like to
[41:24] minister to you this morning on
[41:26] continuing on being changed i'm going to
[41:28] go to my first powerpoint first that i
[41:31] sent uh wednesday that when i spoke
[41:34] let's just begin reading here and i just
[41:35] want to take just a text from uh this is
[41:38] something that is very familiar we've
[41:40] read it but i want you not just to read
[41:42] this uh because you've read it many
[41:44] times sometimes you have a sense to
[41:46] gloss over it and hear it again we're
[41:47] just reading it because it's tradition
[41:49] to read the scripture before you preach
[41:51] well let's not do that this morning i
[41:53] want you to really key in
[41:55] on what romans 7 is saying here and then
[41:58] we'll we'll take a a text from it let's
[42:01] look at it again here in verse 13
[42:03] verse 14 we'll begin
[42:05] for we know that the law is spiritual
[42:08] but i am carnal
[42:09] sold under sin
[42:11] for that which i do
[42:13] i allow not
[42:15] for what i would
[42:16] that do i not but what i hate
[42:19] that do i
[42:21] if then i do that which i would not
[42:24] i can send to the law that it is good
[42:27] now then it is no more i that do it but
[42:30] sin that dwelleth in me
[42:32] for i know that in me
[42:34] that is in my flesh
[42:37] dwelleth no good thing so presently the
[42:40] apostle paul could say that is in my
[42:42] flesh so he makes a distinction
[42:45] between something if he's if he's
[42:47] pointing out
[42:48] to clarify what he's speaking of when he
[42:51] says in me there's no good thing when
[42:53] you say in me you mean body soul and
[42:56] spirit because you're made up of more
[42:58] than your personality
[43:00] more than your makeup more than how you
[43:02] look and how you draw how you present
[43:04] yourself there's more to you than what i
[43:07] see
[43:09] you here this morning
[43:11] there's more to you let me say it this
[43:13] way there's more to you
[43:15] than what you see in the mirror
[43:20] and so brother branham says you're a
[43:21] triune being you're made up of body soul
[43:23] and spirit so the apostle paul is
[43:25] speaking of that triune being and he's
[43:27] going to clarify now this to me it just
[43:30] makes it that much more clear that
[43:32] romans 7 is not as we said last
[43:34] wednesday it's not as some would suggest
[43:37] that this is the condition of the
[43:38] unconverted but no this is actually the
[43:41] condition of the converted believer
[43:45] until their body's changed
[43:49] because he says here that is he says for
[43:51] i know that in me that is in my flesh in
[43:54] other words i'm not talking about the
[43:56] soul that's been converted and changed
[43:58] and translated but this rotten
[44:02] flesh that gives me so much trouble
[44:05] he says i know that in me that is in my
[44:08] flesh
[44:09] dwelleth
[44:10] no
[44:11] good
[44:12] thing amen
[44:15] for to will
[44:17] is present with me aha
[44:19] you see before you're born again there
[44:21] is no will to do right
[44:25] you may you may uh reform yourself under
[44:28] you have good parents and you so you
[44:29] want to have good morals the apostle
[44:31] paul here say he's saying here for in me
[44:34] there's no good thing in my flesh for to
[44:36] will so there's something beyond the
[44:38] flesh something that's in the soul
[44:40] that's willing to do the right thing
[44:42] wanting and desiring to live the right
[44:44] life
[44:46] the will is present within me but how to
[44:50] perform
[44:51] that which is good
[44:54] i find not
[44:57] for the good that i would he says here
[44:59] in verse 19
[45:01] for the good that i would i do not but
[45:03] the evil which i would not
[45:06] that i do
[45:08] now if i do that i would not in other
[45:10] words if i'm doing what i know in my
[45:12] inner man i shouldn't be doing he says
[45:15] if i do that i would not it is no more i
[45:17] that do it but sin
[45:19] that dwelleth in me
[45:22] i find then a law it's almost like the
[45:25] apostle's figuring this out as he's
[45:27] speaking
[45:28] i find then a law
[45:30] that
[45:31] when i would do good
[45:33] evil's present with me
[45:35] for i delight
[45:37] in the law of god after the flesh
[45:43] y'all that are still not not focused
[45:46] here you're saying amen to come on get
[45:48] with me
[45:49] for i delight in the law of god after
[45:51] the flesh
[45:53] after my intellect
[45:55] no
[45:56] for i want to i delight in the things of
[45:58] god after the inward man
[46:02] but i see another law in my members
[46:06] warring against the law
[46:08] of my mind friends you should take
[46:12] comfort if there's a war taking place
[46:16] if there is no war and no battle you're
[46:18] in trouble
[46:20] he says i find then a law he says be but
[46:23] all my members warring against the law
[46:25] of my mind and bringing me into
[46:27] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[46:29] my members
[46:30] lord we thank you for the reading of
[46:32] your word this morning we're just going
[46:33] to pause right there lord already
[46:35] knowing that you're in control
[46:37] lord knowing that you have all things
[46:39] already
[46:40] lord designed you have them laid out you
[46:43] have them thought out
[46:44] lord and it's right now father that we
[46:47] just ask you and invite you to come and
[46:49] take your word
[46:50] lord and come and break into the hearts
[46:52] of your children to me the speaker
[46:54] lord to them the hearer to those that
[46:56] will listen lord we just humble ourself
[46:58] to you right now
[47:00] asking lord for your divine help to be
[47:03] with us lord in this sunday morning
[47:04] service in jesus name
[47:06] amen you can be seated
[47:10] let's pull up that first powerpoint if
[47:12] you could
[47:14] the first one that i sent not that one
[47:16] one i had sent last
[47:17] last wednesday should be called being
[47:19] changed one you'll find it being changed
[47:22] one
[47:23] paul says here in verse 24 let's just
[47:25] continue while they're pulling that up
[47:27] o wretched man that i am
[47:30] who shall deliver me from the body of
[47:33] this death and then he says that famous
[47:36] line i thank god through jesus christ
[47:39] our lord
[47:40] so that when we he says so then with the
[47:42] mind i myself serve the law of god but
[47:45] with the flesh
[47:46] the law of sin now he's not speaking of
[47:48] his mind intellectually here but he's
[47:50] speaking of a law of the inward man
[47:53] so the apostle paul speaking here and i
[47:56] just want to you can just have that
[47:57] ready for me
[47:59] he he speaks of this this struggle this
[48:02] this war that is constantly taking place
[48:05] we spoke a lot in last time on being
[48:07] changed i'm just going to recap some of
[48:09] that here this morning but he's speaking
[48:11] here of this struggle this war that is
[48:14] taking place to the believer and and
[48:16] he's asking this question uh i i i know
[48:20] that i'm gonna i know that there's a
[48:22] desire in me and i believe
[48:24] we could just quickly bring ourselves to
[48:26] paul's uh state of being i think all of
[48:29] us here as believers could right away at
[48:31] the very beginning of this sermon could
[48:34] say i can identify with the apostle paul
[48:38] that i want to do what is right i want
[48:40] to live a life that is uh according to
[48:43] the word of god i want to live a life
[48:45] that's pleasing to the lord but oh if i
[48:48] can just figure out this struggle inside
[48:51] of me i i know that i love the lord i
[48:53] know i've came to the lord jesus i know
[48:55] he's changed my life i know i've had an
[48:57] experience with the lord
[49:00] in so much that i can say i'm not the
[49:02] same person that i was
[49:04] now be very careful because
[49:06] intellectually you can be changed and
[49:08] get a new heart you can get a you can be
[49:11] justified you can be sanctified but not
[49:14] filled with the baptism of the holy
[49:16] ghost
[49:17] and so the real change that takes place
[49:20] in a person is not something that i can
[49:23] do not something you can do by iron will
[49:25] it's not something that you can do
[49:27] intellectually but brother burnham said
[49:29] that the baptism of the holy ghost that
[49:31] can change a person to be someone that
[49:34] they weren't is nothing short of a
[49:37] paradox
[49:39] now remember what a paradox is it's
[49:41] something that cannot be yet it is
[49:45] right something that come on i don't
[49:47] have my pre i don't have all the
[49:48] ministry here so y'all really gotta fill
[49:51] in their shoes this morning
[49:52] uh i got i got i need a good amen corner
[49:55] to stay right with me i got a lot a lot
[49:57] i want to get to and i believe it's from
[49:59] the lord
[50:00] but you've got paul is saying here
[50:03] there's brother branham says there's a
[50:04] change that takes place and he says it's
[50:06] a paradox
[50:08] it's it's something that cannot be yet
[50:11] it is it's a supernatural event the body
[50:14] the the the body change that changes you
[50:17] will be a supernatural unexplainable
[50:21] event that you can't perform and you
[50:24] can't do
[50:25] but god in the moment in the twinkling
[50:27] of an eye this mortal flesh will change
[50:33] so the same supernatural power that
[50:36] changes the flesh
[50:38] has to be the same power that changes
[50:41] your soul
[50:44] in other words if you in other words
[50:46] this is something that that you can't be
[50:48] taught it's not something that sitting
[50:50] in a church
[50:51] gives you
[50:52] amen we've heard it said years ago by my
[50:56] dad
[50:56] and i mean he maybe have gotten it from
[50:58] someone but he said sitting in church
[51:00] doesn't make you a christian any more
[51:02] than sitting in a garage makes you a car
[51:04] amen right
[51:06] you're you're either you're either a car
[51:09] or you're a person it's one of the other
[51:11] so there's a supernatural change that
[51:13] has to take place brothers sisters i
[51:16] can't preach on anything more simple yet
[51:19] more vital and important to you
[51:23] i want to challenge us this morning
[51:25] because i believe it's it's high it's a
[51:27] good time i believe it's high time that
[51:29] we challenge ourselves the bible says it
[51:32] this way to make our calling
[51:35] and our election
[51:37] sure
[51:39] there was ever a day in age that we've
[51:41] lived in that we should be making our
[51:44] calling and election shore
[51:47] every day of our life it's right now to
[51:50] work out our own salvation with fear
[51:55] and trembling
[51:57] it's what the scripture says to work out
[51:59] our own salvation with fear
[52:03] and trembling to make our colon and
[52:05] election sure so you say how can i get
[52:08] past this problem well you can look at
[52:10] the where did sin come from and how did
[52:12] i become infected with this law of sin
[52:15] that lives within me that constantly as
[52:18] a carnal nature that wants to do
[52:20] wrong and and has a has a is bent
[52:23] towards the wild it's bent towards the
[52:26] wrong things you don't come into this
[52:28] life seeking after the right things you
[52:31] actually come into this life tasting and
[52:33] thirsting and hungering for the wrong
[52:36] things amen
[52:37] because there's a law that lives down
[52:39] inside of you of sin so you say where
[52:42] where could i where could i
[52:44] get to where could we trace it back to
[52:45] you can trace it all the way back
[52:47] to the origin of of the fall in the
[52:50] garden of eden and we could look at that
[52:52] and we could we could look at that and
[52:54] teach on the beginning and how we you
[52:57] know what took place in the garden how
[52:58] adam fell and how eve fell but let me
[53:01] just move beyond that because i think a
[53:03] much more important question we can ask
[53:06] ourselves is is not how did it begin but
[53:09] how did i become infected with this
[53:12] problem
[53:13] because before you can ever be
[53:15] fixed or delivered
[53:18] there first must be
[53:20] recognition
[53:22] and it admits that i've got the disease
[53:28] and it's my own struggle
[53:30] as paul said it's my own
[53:32] personal
[53:33] battle it's my own personal problem a
[53:37] person who's infected uh is diagnosed
[53:39] with cancer they that you could sit them
[53:42] down and tell them how cancer begins and
[53:45] and look at scientifically what a cancer
[53:47] is and and and and how you get cancer
[53:50] and you could tell them you're under a
[53:53] microscope well this is what happens
[53:54] when a molecule and you got these kind
[53:56] of cells in your body but listen you you
[53:59] might be able to tell that to me and get
[54:01] my attention you you start to tell that
[54:03] to a person who has cancer and there's
[54:05] no interest in where cancer came from
[54:07] the interest is how do i become cured
[54:11] of my cancer
[54:12] and so when you recognize yourself that
[54:15] sin is not just sin most people live
[54:18] their lives studying and thinking oh
[54:20] here's sin and i know there's evil and i
[54:21] know there's good and and we can study
[54:23] the origin of that but friends how about
[54:25] we admitted ourselves to where we can
[54:28] look just like a person who has cancer
[54:30] and can have a death sentence on them
[54:32] when you get that kind of recognition
[54:34] then there's a there's a desire and
[54:36] there's a plea to say lord i don't just
[54:39] it doesn't matter how it begin i just
[54:41] want to be free
[54:44] i want to be delivered of it
[54:49] the bible says this and i'm just going
[54:50] to go through some of these scriptures
[54:51] quickly so you don't have to turn romans
[54:53] 3 verse 9.
[54:55] oh men oh everybody somebody say all
[54:58] together
[54:59] all men are every man alike both jew and
[55:03] gentile all
[55:05] are sinners
[55:09] that means everybody
[55:11] both jew both gentile
[55:14] everybody
[55:15] so uh is there anybody better than
[55:17] anybody else nope nobody's better than
[55:19] anybody else
[55:21] maybe by history or background or who
[55:22] you were nope nobody's better than
[55:25] anybody else there's no little sin and
[55:27] no big sin in the eyes of god i know
[55:29] that's something we can we can almost
[55:31] trivialize but i i want to emphasize it
[55:33] this morning
[55:35] there's no big sin and no little sin
[55:36] brother madam said that there's one sin
[55:38] and that's the sin of unbelief
[55:42] there is however a difference between a
[55:45] person who's unconverted and who lives
[55:48] under the dominion and the power of sin
[55:52] and a person who has been set free from
[55:55] the dominion of sin
[55:57] but is still influenced by sin amen
[56:00] i want to tell you something so powerful
[56:02] and so amazing that brother steve curtis
[56:05] sent me after i preached this last uh
[56:07] wednesday and i preached on being
[56:08] changed it was so powerful
[56:10] you know the picture that they have and
[56:12] i'm sure many of you have seen it you
[56:14] maybe could pull it up gideon if you
[56:16] pull up if you just google search uh
[56:18] brother branham and the pillar of fire
[56:20] the indian chief and you go to google
[56:22] images you're gonna find a picture there
[56:24] of the prophet preaching if he gets it
[56:26] good if not i'll just continue on if you
[56:28] type in brother branham and indian chief
[56:30] you should see a picture of brother
[56:32] branham like this and then a a a form
[56:35] behind him it's amazing brother steve
[56:37] had
[56:38] texted me this picture and he begins to
[56:40] because i was preaching on and i don't
[56:42] have time to cover it and background it
[56:44] again but i was preaching on brother
[56:45] brandon i'm talking about the the the
[56:48] cocker borough and he talks about the
[56:50] life that that dies in that cockroach he
[56:52] says but no matter how much you're
[56:54] converted remember this i preached it
[56:56] wednesday he said no matter how much
[56:57] you're converted you'll always live with
[56:59] that sticky nature that's inside of you
[57:02] that flesh that'll always trip you up
[57:04] that old nature and brother branham then
[57:07] gives a story about the chief who came
[57:08] up for healing me sick and and then
[57:10] brother branham hears his converted one
[57:12] day and he begins to talk to her this
[57:14] man begins to talk to him and he says
[57:16] chief and he talks about the white dog
[57:17] and the black dog and he says chief
[57:19] which one wins he says well it all
[57:21] depends on which dog chief feeds the
[57:23] most
[57:24] if i feed this dog the most he's going
[57:26] to win the fight if i feed this dog the
[57:28] most uh he's going to win the fight and
[57:30] remember i'd spoke on that you remember
[57:32] that from wednesday
[57:34] and brother branham's talking about the
[57:36] old nature that old sticky nature that's
[57:38] always within you do you have that
[57:39] gideon you could you could that's fine
[57:41] no worries you how many raised your hand
[57:42] if you remember that picture
[57:45] of brother branham there and he's
[57:46] preaching and he's and he's and he's got
[57:48] a almost looks like the uh a a a an
[57:51] image of streaks of something of light
[57:53] that are going past him like this
[57:55] there's some flowers in the front
[57:56] they're just bringing giving getting
[57:58] your mind to remembrance um and and so
[58:01] brother brandon begins to talk talk
[58:02] about that picture and brother steve had
[58:04] pointed out he told me a message and
[58:06] sent me just a little clip that that uh
[58:09] that brother lonnie jenkins had spoke on
[58:11] years ago and i had never seen it before
[58:13] it was it was so it would never heard it
[58:15] before it was so powerful but brother
[58:17] lina begins to talk about that picture
[58:19] and and he begins to tell i think it was
[58:21] brother sidney jackson i think was the
[58:24] brother if i'm remembering it correctly
[58:26] that that brother uh brother uh branham
[58:29] uh bro sorry brother sydney was talking
[58:31] to brother lonnie brother sydney said
[58:33] you know something amazing about
[58:36] he says something amazing about that
[58:38] picture
[58:39] and he says you notice there this is
[58:41] brother branham talking to brother
[58:42] sidney jackson
[58:44] and he says brother sidney i want you to
[58:46] look at that picture really closely
[58:49] and he says i want you to see something
[58:50] here
[58:51] and he says you see there those streaks
[58:54] of light that are going behind me and
[58:55] brother sydney says yes he says can you
[58:57] can you look and see says it looks like
[58:59] an old indian chief
[59:02] and if you look at that picture and you
[59:04] ever see that for yourself it's very
[59:06] clear you could throw it up gideon
[59:07] that's fine
[59:08] if you ever look you look here and it's
[59:10] very clear to see that that the the
[59:13] picture of an old indian chief almost
[59:15] like it's above brother branham maybe
[59:17] just two or three feet behind him
[59:19] looking down
[59:20] and brother branham tells brother sidney
[59:22] he says you see that right there
[59:25] any he yeah you can you can mute that
[59:26] good perfect thank you thank the lord we
[59:28] got that
[59:29] so you see this image here and i'm just
[59:32] going to point here it's going to mess
[59:33] the camera but that's fine this would be
[59:35] the chin right here this would be the
[59:37] nose you're looking at a profile of a of
[59:40] an indian chief looking just like this
[59:42] you see the chin is here the nose is
[59:45] here the eye socket would be here the
[59:47] head is here then you have almost like
[59:50] an indian wears a little signet in their
[59:52] hair up here and you have these waves
[59:54] that are going like this like feathers
[59:56] from his cap here's his shoulders his
[59:58] neck is right here if you've if you
[1:00:00] can't see that then then uh we could i
[1:00:02] could show you after church up close you
[1:00:04] could see it a lot better
[1:00:06] and and you almost see that as a picture
[1:00:08] looking and brother branham takes this
[1:00:09] picture to brother sydney and he shows
[1:00:11] him this and he says now brother sydney
[1:00:13] i want you to notice that indian chief
[1:00:15] that is right there and he says can you
[1:00:17] see that and brother brother sydney says
[1:00:18] yes brother branham i can see it he says
[1:00:20] you see brother sidney that's my old
[1:00:23] nature
[1:00:26] and he says because my mama was an
[1:00:28] indian
[1:00:30] and he says that's my old nature there
[1:00:32] always there
[1:00:34] to haunt me
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:37] and he says brother brother branham says
[1:00:39] now it's in brother sydney says now it's
[1:00:40] important for me to tell you how brother
[1:00:42] branham used his hands and brother
[1:00:44] brandon begins to use his hands and he
[1:00:45] says you see brother sidney he says when
[1:00:48] the holy ghost when a person accepts
[1:00:50] he says when a person accepts the truth
[1:00:52] of the word and they repent of all their
[1:00:55] sins and they come to under the
[1:00:56] knowledge of the of the truth of the end
[1:00:58] time brother branham says in a person's
[1:01:00] really born of the spirit of god he says
[1:01:03] the fire of god comes into he says the
[1:01:07] fire of god comes into the soul and it
[1:01:10] burns out that old nature that's living
[1:01:13] here
[1:01:14] and he says and it pushes it out and
[1:01:16] brother takes his hands like this
[1:01:20] and he says see
[1:01:21] it's lost its position of dominion
[1:01:25] and it's moved to a position of
[1:01:28] influence
[1:01:32] you see i'm going to take that just for
[1:01:33] a moment to show you that before you're
[1:01:36] born of the spirit of god by the baptism
[1:01:38] of the holy ghost
[1:01:39] and i don't know why the lord just would
[1:01:41] just have to help me this morning
[1:01:43] i just want to emphasize this and if i
[1:01:45] sound like a broken record then i'm
[1:01:47] going to sound like a broken record the
[1:01:49] baptism of the holy ghost is not an
[1:01:52] intellectual thing that you accept by me
[1:01:54] preaching and you saying i believe that
[1:01:57] the baptism of the holy ghost is not you
[1:01:59] just pray in a prayer of repentance the
[1:02:02] baptism of the holy ghost is not you
[1:02:04] just saying i want the lord in my heart
[1:02:05] and so the lord's in my heart the lord
[1:02:07] may not be in your heart
[1:02:10] say brother matt then how do i get it
[1:02:11] very simple repent
[1:02:13] and true repentance is not a prayer true
[1:02:16] repentance is when you turn around and
[1:02:17] you change and go the other way you
[1:02:20] forsake something
[1:02:22] you come out of something
[1:02:24] you sanctify yourself
[1:02:28] and god then not you not a preacher not
[1:02:30] a prayer not an anointing oil not
[1:02:32] speaking in tongues
[1:02:34] god himself
[1:02:36] tabernacles and enters that old nature
[1:02:39] comes out and a new nature comes in
[1:02:44] and so young people listen to me close
[1:02:46] if that's never happened you're not born
[1:02:47] again of the spirit of god amen very
[1:02:50] clear
[1:02:52] you might sit in church you might be
[1:02:54] raised by good parents they may believe
[1:02:55] the message but let me just say it to
[1:02:57] you make your call in an election
[1:03:00] sure
[1:03:01] seek out your own salvation with fear
[1:03:02] and trouble say brother matt does that
[1:03:04] take then it must take justification
[1:03:05] sanctification baptisms must be months
[1:03:08] down the road well it could be for some
[1:03:09] people some people have been sitting in
[1:03:10] sanctification for years and never born
[1:03:13] of the spirit of god and that's why
[1:03:14] they're constantly entangled in bondages
[1:03:16] of sin and they never change
[1:03:18] others repent and in one instant god
[1:03:21] sees the level of repentance and fills
[1:03:23] them with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:25] the house of cornelius as the word was
[1:03:27] being preached they were filled with the
[1:03:28] holy ghost
[1:03:30] so the problem is is we make measuring
[1:03:32] lines
[1:03:33] and brother branham says away with
[1:03:35] experiences for a measuring life
[1:03:39] it all comes down to your
[1:03:41] repentance
[1:03:43] so brother branham says that old
[1:03:45] nature's driven out and he says now it
[1:03:47] moves to a position of influence so if
[1:03:49] you're sitting here without the baptism
[1:03:51] of the holy ghost this morning you're
[1:03:53] the the difference between a person
[1:03:55] who's filled with the spirit of the
[1:03:57] person who isn't is very simple the
[1:03:59] person who isn't has sin is
[1:04:02] dominating and is on the throne of their
[1:04:04] heart
[1:04:06] but a person who's been born again
[1:04:08] there's no the dominion there's a new
[1:04:10] king sitting on the throne
[1:04:12] and there's a war that's taking place
[1:04:15] because that old nature's influencing
[1:04:17] them
[1:04:18] are we clear this morning
[1:04:21] so he says he moves from a spot of
[1:04:24] dominion to a position of
[1:04:26] influence pull up that power point if
[1:04:29] you could the first one that we told you
[1:04:30] to get get him thank you so he says
[1:04:33] none are good no not god no no he says
[1:04:35] no not none are good except the lord
[1:04:37] even nicodemus said that when he says a
[1:04:39] good master and jesus says there's none
[1:04:41] good but god
[1:04:43] there's none good but god uh he and and
[1:04:45] so so we we set that we set that
[1:04:48] straight romans 3 verse 10 i'm going to
[1:04:50] read it from a different translation of
[1:04:52] you could put up the new living bible he
[1:04:54] says no one is good romans 3 10 no one
[1:04:57] is good no one in all the world is
[1:04:59] innocent no one has ever really followed
[1:05:02] god's paths or even truly wanted to
[1:05:07] everyone
[1:05:08] has turned away all have gone wrong
[1:05:12] no one anywhere has kept on doing what
[1:05:16] is right
[1:05:17] no one amen
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:21] sorry i just took your angel wings away
[1:05:22] and your halos laying over there
[1:05:24] crunched and crashed in the yard
[1:05:28] let me tell you as i heard a man say it
[1:05:30] was so powerful even some of you who
[1:05:32] maybe have listened to jordan peterson
[1:05:34] and recently was converted and and as a
[1:05:38] professing believer now
[1:05:39] and he begins to he made a powerful
[1:05:41] statement he said really when we really
[1:05:42] think about it the only true christian
[1:05:45] was jesus
[1:05:47] the only true christian
[1:05:49] only one who's really a christian
[1:05:51] was jesus
[1:05:53] christ
[1:05:54] himself
[1:05:56] amen the bible
[1:05:58] doesn't mince words and it doesn't it
[1:06:00] doesn't sugarcoat the condition of the
[1:06:03] carnal nature of this of sin that reigns
[1:06:05] within us and romans 3 13 says their
[1:06:08] talk is foul and filthy like the stench
[1:06:11] from an open grave
[1:06:12] their tongues are loaded with lies
[1:06:15] this is sin dwelling in your in your in
[1:06:18] your in your body he says everything
[1:06:20] they say has it has in it the sting and
[1:06:23] poison of deadly snakes
[1:06:26] their mouths are full of cursing and
[1:06:29] bitterness they are quick to shed blood
[1:06:31] haste
[1:06:32] hating anyone who disagrees with them
[1:06:35] wherever they go they leave misery and
[1:06:37] trouble behind them and they have never
[1:06:39] known what it is to feel secure or enjoy
[1:06:43] god's blessing they care about nothing
[1:06:46] about god or what he thinks of them
[1:06:50] so it's very important how you look at
[1:06:52] sin it's very important your approach to
[1:06:54] how you look at your first birth
[1:06:57] can i say it that way because that's
[1:06:58] what i'm really talking about here this
[1:07:00] morning
[1:07:01] it's very important how you look at your
[1:07:02] first birth and you look at it properly
[1:07:05] and scripturally
[1:07:06] and and so these you say brother matt
[1:07:08] why is that important because the only
[1:07:10] way that you'll ever get god to forgive
[1:07:13] there's no way you can ever understand
[1:07:15] as we've said here many times before
[1:07:17] you'll never understand the mercy of god
[1:07:20] until you first understand the wrath of
[1:07:23] god
[1:07:24] until you get a revelation of how lost
[1:07:26] you are you'll never know what kind of
[1:07:29] freedom you need
[1:07:32] and so he says here and and and and so
[1:07:36] the bible says this about the heart
[1:07:38] jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful
[1:07:41] above all things
[1:07:43] and desperately wicked
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:47] who can know it that's right well i feel
[1:07:49] in my heart that i feel in my heart how
[1:07:52] many times have we said that
[1:07:55] the heart is deceitfully wicked above
[1:07:56] all who can know it
[1:07:58] not you
[1:08:00] not me amen
[1:08:03] let me say it this way it's very rare
[1:08:05] that sin
[1:08:06] and uh presents itself
[1:08:09] in its true nature
[1:08:12] never presents itself in its true colors
[1:08:15] it never comes to you and says oh come
[1:08:16] here give me a big hug i'm going to
[1:08:18] infest you with every kind of pollution
[1:08:20] and disease i'm going to i'm going to
[1:08:22] ruin you i'm gonna just just take just a
[1:08:24] little sip i'm gonna it's gonna destroy
[1:08:27] you know it never advertises that as we
[1:08:29] said about the man who's smoking a
[1:08:31] cigarette he's up there cowboy young and
[1:08:33] healthy and he's got if they never show
[1:08:35] you the picture of that man with a lung
[1:08:38] cancer laying on his deathbed in a
[1:08:40] hospital surrounded by a family
[1:08:43] satan never comes to you in his true
[1:08:46] colors
[1:08:46] pride bitterness
[1:08:48] envy jealousies
[1:08:51] sin
[1:08:53] he never says i'm your i'm your enemy
[1:08:55] i'm going to destroy you so just take a
[1:08:56] little piece of me no no he's very very
[1:09:00] much more sin sin comes to you like a
[1:09:04] angelic uh with wings and holy and
[1:09:07] justifies it in every possible way
[1:09:12] you get a temper and you say the wrong
[1:09:13] thing and then you'd always just my
[1:09:15] righteous indignation
[1:09:22] it'll it'll cloak itself
[1:09:24] it'll hide itself
[1:09:26] it'll cloak itself it'll cloak itself to
[1:09:29] believers now remember this isn't to the
[1:09:31] unconverted because brother adam says
[1:09:33] the difference is is that they are just
[1:09:34] sin this the christian is the only one
[1:09:36] who can really sin the unbeliever is
[1:09:39] just an unbeliever and that's what he is
[1:09:41] he lives by the law is dominated by that
[1:09:43] amen but a believer can be influenced by
[1:09:46] the wrong thing by their flesh and sin
[1:09:49] we've got to get somewhere so i got to
[1:09:51] hurry this morning
[1:09:52] so he doesn't come around and say it he
[1:09:54] comes very
[1:09:56] with an outstretched arm and flattering
[1:09:58] words
[1:10:00] and it seems so harmless
[1:10:02] it's cloaked under so many
[1:10:04] smooth names and and so innocent and
[1:10:07] well it's not really that big of a deal
[1:10:10] and it just sort of reshapes and
[1:10:12] re-masks itself
[1:10:16] but you know what you know what you know
[1:10:18] what you can't change you could you
[1:10:19] could change its
[1:10:21] name you could call it whatever you want
[1:10:23] you could justify it what you can't
[1:10:25] change
[1:10:26] is its character
[1:10:28] and what it produces in your life
[1:10:36] let's just move on we got we got to get
[1:10:37] to something so i just want to go to go
[1:10:39] to that first go to that first
[1:10:41] my goodness i told myself i wasn't gonna
[1:10:43] do this and i did it
[1:10:46] i didn't get to hardly my notes when i
[1:10:47] preached it wednesday and i thought i
[1:10:48] got sunday we'll get to it we're not
[1:10:50] going to
[1:10:51] so listen to what brother branham says
[1:10:52] here i want you just to follow i know
[1:10:54] this is a repeat but i want you to
[1:10:56] listen he says if you went into a
[1:10:57] doctor's office and told him you were
[1:10:59] sick
[1:11:00] i'm going to turn this on i guess so i
[1:11:02] can control it he says and told him you
[1:11:04] were sick
[1:11:05] and your symptoms and he was in a hurry
[1:11:07] he would probably give you a little
[1:11:08] prescription with some anesthetic on it
[1:11:10] some sort of aspirin he says the doctor
[1:11:13] he says the doctor is merely trying to
[1:11:15] get rid of you just at that time
[1:11:19] he just gives you a pill doesn't
[1:11:21] diagnose you doesn't look at it
[1:11:23] it says he's merely trying to get rid of
[1:11:25] you just at that time because he hasn't
[1:11:26] time but a real good doctor
[1:11:29] before he gives you the medicine would
[1:11:31] diagnose that case thoroughly
[1:11:34] until he found out what was wrong
[1:11:39] then give you the medicine
[1:11:42] it's very sometimes we make the gospel
[1:11:45] prescription
[1:11:46] we just throw it out there
[1:11:49] you just need to be born again you just
[1:11:50] need to get the holy ghost
[1:11:52] brother branham says when the doctor
[1:11:54] just throws that out there and you all
[1:11:56] just need to come up here and pray for
[1:11:57] you and if you shake and tremble and you
[1:11:58] all fall to the ground that's just what
[1:12:00] you need you just need to get in the
[1:12:02] holy ghost get the get in the prayer of
[1:12:03] mine that's all you need just get the
[1:12:04] holy ghost well that's true that's the
[1:12:06] pill that's what they need but brother
[1:12:08] man says a true doctor would thoroughly
[1:12:12] diagnose the case till he found out was
[1:12:15] what was wrong then give you the
[1:12:17] medicine
[1:12:18] and sometimes we find people through the
[1:12:20] prayer line coming across across the
[1:12:21] nations they just run up and think the
[1:12:23] lord ought to heal them right then but
[1:12:24] there's something maybe down in there
[1:12:26] and we set before the lord until he
[1:12:28] reveals that
[1:12:30] what that is
[1:12:32] there is something that brother madam
[1:12:33] says something so profound here he says
[1:12:37] there's a reason
[1:12:39] for everything now i want you to key
[1:12:41] that statement and i want you to have it
[1:12:43] in your mind
[1:12:45] throughout the rest of this sermon
[1:12:47] that statement there's
[1:12:49] a reason
[1:12:50] for
[1:12:52] everything amen
[1:12:54] he says there's a reason for everything
[1:12:57] and you've got to find the reason
[1:13:00] first
[1:13:02] and then you could find
[1:13:04] what to work on
[1:13:07] and he says here he says not some
[1:13:08] program excuse me interviews this
[1:13:10] morning he says let me just move down
[1:13:11] the person is genuine person real person
[1:13:13] let viv dry they've heard me say the
[1:13:15] evidence of the holy ghost was speaking
[1:13:16] in tongues and it isn't now this is this
[1:13:18] is let me let me just move from this
[1:13:20] this is the example we gave wednesday of
[1:13:22] brother branham seeing the nature that
[1:13:24] was in this person and seeing what sign
[1:13:26] they were born under he says that here
[1:13:28] which way uh it was set their natural
[1:13:31] nature sets them in a certain line so
[1:13:33] your first old nature remember brother
[1:13:35] branham says that's my old nature always
[1:13:37] there to haunt me
[1:13:38] so that first nature sets them in a
[1:13:41] certain line it develops how you think
[1:13:43] even after you're converted
[1:13:45] it trips you up and bothers you in ways
[1:13:48] that it might not bother me
[1:13:50] but i have things in my nature that may
[1:13:52] not trip you up but may trip me up
[1:13:56] and both of us be born of the spirit of
[1:13:57] god and both of us questioning if we've
[1:13:59] been born again
[1:14:02] hello
[1:14:04] that nature that old nature says brother
[1:14:06] and says i've seen she was a certain
[1:14:08] sign she was born under and he says i
[1:14:10] just told her just preach that the
[1:14:12] speaking in tongues is not the evidence
[1:14:13] of the holy ghost but actually for this
[1:14:15] person i prayed and said i advise you to
[1:14:17] pray and ask the lord so that you'll
[1:14:18] speak in tongues
[1:14:20] why would brother branham do that
[1:14:22] because he understood the nature that
[1:14:24] this person the sign they were born
[1:14:26] under
[1:14:28] and he understood that until that
[1:14:29] happened that person would always
[1:14:31] question that in their life you see
[1:14:32] there's a lot that has to do with our
[1:14:34] makeup of our of how we were born how we
[1:14:37] were raised the atmosphere of our home
[1:14:39] the atmosphere of our school the
[1:14:42] teachers that we had remember brother
[1:14:43] madam says that's you don't realize how
[1:14:45] important your mother is and he said
[1:14:47] because the first love a child ever
[1:14:49] receives is the true genuine love of a
[1:14:51] mother that's why it's so important for
[1:14:53] a mother to love their children
[1:14:56] biblically according to the way the lord
[1:14:58] has instructed us and trained us to
[1:15:01] train up a child
[1:15:02] because that mother's there to fill that
[1:15:04] void that's inside that child's heart
[1:15:07] and if the mother doesn't feel that void
[1:15:09] brother branham says then that boy or
[1:15:11] that girl will grow up and take some
[1:15:13] violent substitute
[1:15:20] and so that mother's there and he gives
[1:15:21] that child that love he's feeling just
[1:15:23] the just the love and cherishment and
[1:15:25] nourishment and forgiveness and that's
[1:15:28] his first experience there's first no
[1:15:30] understanding of true godly love
[1:15:33] translated down through a mother to that
[1:15:35] child
[1:15:37] brother branham says but then shortly
[1:15:39] after that you move from your mother and
[1:15:40] then you go to your father
[1:15:43] and he says now you're under the
[1:15:44] tutelage
[1:15:45] no longer of mama mama says hey he's too
[1:15:47] big for me to spank you got to take over
[1:15:49] now
[1:15:52] he's six foot two and
[1:15:55] married with three kids
[1:15:56] no
[1:15:59] the mother says you gotta take over it's
[1:16:02] brother branham says it's it's the way
[1:16:03] god ordained it now he moves from the
[1:16:05] mother mother's love is always still
[1:16:07] there but now he moves under the father
[1:16:09] you see it's so important for that
[1:16:10] father than to know his role accept his
[1:16:13] role as tutor
[1:16:15] and as teacher
[1:16:17] and to show that brother branham says
[1:16:19] the show the love it's not that the love
[1:16:21] is not that the love is not love but he
[1:16:23] says it's a different type of love maybe
[1:16:25] a more corrective love
[1:16:28] remember brother diggs talked about that
[1:16:30] he said in every house there's law and
[1:16:32] grace
[1:16:34] and he said sometimes the mom's grace
[1:16:36] and the dad is law and brother dick says
[1:16:38] in my and my my house my mama was a
[1:16:41] police officer she she was the law
[1:16:44] and and so so there's always brother
[1:16:46] branham says then it moves from there to
[1:16:47] your father and you're trained that's
[1:16:49] why it's so important then when the
[1:16:51] passing off of when that when that
[1:16:53] transition happens in that child's life
[1:16:55] it's so important for the father to be
[1:16:57] who he should be
[1:16:58] seeing himself properly not addicted and
[1:17:01] not messed up he'll never a carnal uh
[1:17:04] nature can never help another carnal
[1:17:06] nature
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] amen unsaved the blind can't the jesus
[1:17:11] said the blind will lead the blind and
[1:17:12] they'll all fall into the
[1:17:14] ditch doesn't mean that father's perfect
[1:17:17] but it's important that there's a father
[1:17:19] who's present
[1:17:21] and brother ben says and if he's not
[1:17:22] what happens he goes from that mother
[1:17:24] and all the love of that mother but
[1:17:25] never receives it from a father and he
[1:17:27] says then he goes into the world and he
[1:17:30] accepts some violent substitute to take
[1:17:32] the place of a godly father who should
[1:17:34] have been there amen amen that's why you
[1:17:37] hear brother brandon preaching so much
[1:17:39] on it's not child delinquency it's
[1:17:45] missing in action
[1:17:49] and and and we're all guilty hello
[1:17:52] fathers we're all mothers we're all
[1:17:53] guilty in some way shape or form amen
[1:17:56] none of us none of us is exempt
[1:17:59] so then he moves brother and says then
[1:18:00] you move from there from your father
[1:18:02] maybe it's your first teacher in school
[1:18:04] and he says and that teacher is going to
[1:18:06] serve an important role because that
[1:18:08] teacher now is training you and teaching
[1:18:10] you and they're they serve an important
[1:18:12] role in that child's life then from
[1:18:14] there maybe to a boss maybe their first
[1:18:16] job and brother branham says it's this
[1:18:18] way leadership he preaches that in
[1:18:20] leadership it's leading them
[1:18:22] should be leading them to the baptism of
[1:18:24] the holy ghost who is the real teacher
[1:18:28] and the real tutor that they need
[1:18:32] and he says but if not they'll accept
[1:18:34] some violent substitute to take the
[1:18:36] place of that so he said brother matt
[1:18:38] why did you point all that out by the
[1:18:39] mother then the father then the teacher
[1:18:41] then the employer then
[1:18:43] because it's important to understand
[1:18:45] that you who you are and i'm going to
[1:18:47] say this statement
[1:18:48] who you are as an adult
[1:18:51] is a lot of times a reaction of a
[1:18:54] childhood that you had
[1:18:57] remember brother branham talks about
[1:18:59] blowed up christians and he uses the
[1:19:01] example of a boiler and he says that he
[1:19:03] says you take that boiler and after it
[1:19:05] builds up pressure and more pressure and
[1:19:06] more pressure and he says finally if it
[1:19:09] has no way to let off the pressure he
[1:19:10] says it just blows up and goes through
[1:19:13] the roof
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:16] and he says what is it he says that's
[1:19:18] why we he says that he said because the
[1:19:20] flu was clogged up it had no way to
[1:19:23] exhaust it had no way to vent
[1:19:25] and he says that's what's wrong with so
[1:19:28] many blowed up
[1:19:30] christians
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:33] blown up
[1:19:35] christians
[1:19:37] and they blow up
[1:19:39] and a marriage is disintegrated and
[1:19:42] relationships are disintegrated and
[1:19:44] their testimony is disintegrated brother
[1:19:46] adam says the reason we've got so many
[1:19:48] blowed up christians is because of a
[1:19:50] clogged flu or a clogged pipe and he
[1:19:53] says they never cleaned out
[1:19:56] the channels
[1:20:00] memory conscience reasoning imagination
[1:20:02] affection you're more than just your
[1:20:05] flesh you're more than who you see in
[1:20:07] the mirror and let me repeat it there's
[1:20:09] a reason for everything
[1:20:12] amen i hope you're paying attention this
[1:20:14] morning
[1:20:15] there's a reason for
[1:20:16] everything they never clean out the
[1:20:19] channels so they get they're a blown-up
[1:20:21] christian they've got he says they never
[1:20:23] clean out the channels where does what
[1:20:25] is some of those clogs brother matt give
[1:20:26] me some clogs that clog things up
[1:20:29] a grudge
[1:20:32] will clog up
[1:20:33] your pipes
[1:20:36] bitterness
[1:20:37] will clog up your pipes
[1:20:42] unforgiveness
[1:20:44] and not willing to say not able to say
[1:20:46] i'm sorry
[1:20:50] will clog up your pipes there's a reason
[1:20:54] for everything
[1:20:56] i don't know why i struggle with this
[1:20:57] and now i'm battling this and brother
[1:20:59] matt i i've been born of the spirit of
[1:21:01] god
[1:21:01] there's a reason
[1:21:04] for everything
[1:21:06] it's just like i was speaking to brother
[1:21:07] charles here we were having this
[1:21:09] conversation after the men's breakfast
[1:21:10] and it was wonderful brother charles i
[1:21:13] wrote so many notes for this sermon
[1:21:14] today just from their conversation it's
[1:21:16] just like you take a child and that
[1:21:19] child who doesn't receive
[1:21:21] because i said every everything in your
[1:21:23] adult life is just a reaction of your
[1:21:25] childhood so you take a child a a little
[1:21:28] girl who never receives affection and
[1:21:31] love
[1:21:32] and she and she she never receives uh
[1:21:35] proper uh uh uh uh uh uh cherishing and
[1:21:39] nourishment from a family
[1:21:41] then what happens there's a void created
[1:21:44] in that little girl and she grows up
[1:21:45] with that void and then she gets older
[1:21:48] and then then years pile over top of
[1:21:51] years the pain and the bruise is still
[1:21:52] there the herd is still there and then
[1:21:55] she goes later in marriage and she has
[1:21:57] children herself
[1:21:59] and you ever heard the statement it's
[1:22:00] very popular i'm sure you have that hurt
[1:22:03] people hurt people
[1:22:07] hurt people hurt people and so you take
[1:22:10] that same pain and now that's translated
[1:22:13] and transcended into a new relationship
[1:22:16] only most of the time it's worse
[1:22:19] a child who's raised under militant
[1:22:21] family and a militant dad and it's
[1:22:23] always a pressure to perform and
[1:22:24] everything's like a drill sergeant
[1:22:26] you've gotta you always feel like you
[1:22:28] gotta perform that your worth or your
[1:22:30] value is measured in how well you
[1:22:33] perform
[1:22:34] and if you drill that into a child so
[1:22:36] much that their worth and their value is
[1:22:38] how well they do then guess what happens
[1:22:41] when they get older they're performing
[1:22:43] their entire life they're trying they
[1:22:45] got a pressure to perform and then they
[1:22:47] pass that down to a wife
[1:22:49] and to sons and two daughters
[1:22:52] and then pain is just trans transcended
[1:22:55] into pain are you here this morning
[1:22:58] remember there's a reason for everything
[1:23:03] and you take you take that person maybe
[1:23:05] you grew up without a dad and a dad was
[1:23:07] an alcoholic and never was there never
[1:23:09] was home and then they'd grown up with
[1:23:11] that void
[1:23:13] of what it is to know a father then what
[1:23:15] happens that void is never filled and so
[1:23:18] when you go to preach to that person
[1:23:20] about a kind loving heavenly father they
[1:23:24] almost don't know how to receive that
[1:23:28] they know a militant angry upset god
[1:23:31] who's ready to strike them down and they
[1:23:34] live under that condemnation and
[1:23:35] pressure that's not from the lord it's
[1:23:37] from a bruise in their past
[1:23:41] because remember brother adam gives that
[1:23:43] gives that example of the tree the wheat
[1:23:45] plant and he says he says the wheat
[1:23:48] plants that he sees all the wheats in
[1:23:49] the field are growing straight up and
[1:23:51] got their head i think it was wheat
[1:23:52] maybe it wasn't but he says they they
[1:23:54] grow up straight he says but then i
[1:23:55] noticed a little one he says it was it
[1:23:58] was crooked he said it went like this
[1:24:00] and then it bent around this way and it
[1:24:02] came up this way then it sort of stuck
[1:24:03] its arm out like this it looked so
[1:24:06] deformed now it was alive
[1:24:08] he says now what happened he says maybe
[1:24:10] when it was just little
[1:24:12] he says a branch came down and fell over
[1:24:14] top of it
[1:24:16] and he says and
[1:24:17] and it deformed its life
[1:24:21] now let's here's the miracle it didn't
[1:24:23] die
[1:24:25] it's still alive
[1:24:28] and and brother branham says brother
[1:24:30] branham says something maybe it didn't
[1:24:32] do anything it didn't didn't do anything
[1:24:34] to deserve that didn't do anything wrong
[1:24:38] but just out of circumstances and
[1:24:40] atmospheres and families and conditions
[1:24:43] and places and you'd go through things
[1:24:45] and you didn't do anything wrong the
[1:24:46] miracle is that they survived
[1:24:49] though deformed
[1:24:52] amen and and and and so remember there's
[1:24:55] a reason for everything i'm going to
[1:24:56] keep saying that amen
[1:25:00] it's incredible second corinthians 12 14
[1:25:04] it talks about a a a and i'm just going
[1:25:06] to go through some of this here it talks
[1:25:08] about he says behold the third time you
[1:25:10] don't need to put it up
[1:25:11] he says the third time i am ready to
[1:25:13] come to you and i will not be burdensome
[1:25:14] to you for i seek not yours but for you
[1:25:16] for the children for the children
[1:25:20] for the children
[1:25:22] ought not to lay up for the parents
[1:25:26] but the parents
[1:25:27] for the children amen
[1:25:30] now brother matt i provide i know what
[1:25:32] you're thinking i
[1:25:33] the children ought not to provide for
[1:25:35] the parents but the parents provide for
[1:25:37] the children yes we know that that's why
[1:25:39] our children we don't believe in child
[1:25:40] labor and he's not at work providing
[1:25:43] listen it's what it's much more than you
[1:25:44] putting a roof over their head
[1:25:47] it's much more than us putting a roof
[1:25:48] over their head or supplying them with
[1:25:50] correct training on how to get a job and
[1:25:52] how to be a responsible person there's
[1:25:54] much more to your biblical
[1:25:56] responsibility as a christian parent
[1:25:59] than training them how to be a good
[1:26:00] citizen in the world
[1:26:02] but the children ought not provide for
[1:26:04] the parent but the parents ought to
[1:26:06] train up a child in the way they should
[1:26:09] go
[1:26:11] y'all are quiet but i'm just going to
[1:26:13] keep plowing through
[1:26:17] so there's a reason he says you've got
[1:26:19] to clean out the channels purge your
[1:26:21] spirit you say brother matt what
[1:26:23] what should we do you should be purging
[1:26:26] your spirit
[1:26:27] every day of your life
[1:26:29] you should be saying lord today is a new
[1:26:32] day wash my mind wash my memory wash my
[1:26:36] conscience wash my imagination wash my
[1:26:39] affection wash me again lord let me
[1:26:42] clean out the channel so that i don't
[1:26:43] become a blowed up christian
[1:26:50] that's why brother branham even speaks
[1:26:52] about and we read it last time and it's
[1:26:54] in this powerpoint but i won't go to it
[1:26:55] you can pull up the next one
[1:26:57] brother adam talks about how that he had
[1:26:59] developed a complex
[1:27:01] and he says and he says i was calling
[1:27:03] them rickies and mercedes and he and his
[1:27:05] attitude he would come to the pulpit
[1:27:07] though a prophet of god
[1:27:09] though born again of the spirit he says
[1:27:11] but my attitude towards people was wrong
[1:27:15] and he says and the lord showed me you
[1:27:17] ought and you shouldn't do that he said
[1:27:18] those are those people are he says they
[1:27:21] would serve the lord
[1:27:23] if they knew what who to serve
[1:27:25] you remember that
[1:27:26] and brother branham says i got a complex
[1:27:28] he says maybe because he says i i wasn't
[1:27:31] a i wasn't made to kiss the babies and
[1:27:34] he says i wasn't that kind of a pastor
[1:27:35] to uh he says but but he says but my job
[1:27:38] was to hold the sword of the word and he
[1:27:41] says and cut the the head of the devil
[1:27:44] off
[1:27:44] and he said so i was in war i was in
[1:27:46] battle all the time and because of that
[1:27:49] i got a lot of scars i've been cut
[1:27:52] deep
[1:27:54] many times
[1:27:57] so brother brandon relates his attitude
[1:28:00] to people
[1:28:01] to a complex through pain and hurt that
[1:28:04] had been caused by other christians
[1:28:07] he says the reason i had the wrong
[1:28:09] attitude was because of if pain that i
[1:28:12] received i passed that pain off to
[1:28:14] people
[1:28:16] you say well you know br everybody can
[1:28:18] be guilty i mean we all got to repent of
[1:28:20] our attitude sometimes let me tell you
[1:28:22] what brother branham thought of that
[1:28:24] he didn't minor on it he didn't just say
[1:28:25] it's just not a big deal you know i mean
[1:28:28] i had the wrong attitude so i'm just
[1:28:30] going to go and repent i'm going to go
[1:28:31] pray and it'll all be okay brother
[1:28:32] branham says no
[1:28:34] he says i'm leaving the field
[1:28:39] he says i'm leaving the field you pray
[1:28:41] for me
[1:28:42] hold on brother brandon hol wait hold on
[1:28:45] a minute
[1:28:47] it's not that big of a deal brother
[1:28:48] brandon it's just your attitude just
[1:28:49] stop calling them ricky's and mercedes
[1:28:51] and it's just your attitude you repented
[1:28:53] you made it right brother branham says
[1:28:54] no i'm leaving the field i'm not going
[1:28:56] to preach he said it'd be better for me
[1:28:57] not to come to the pulpit until my heart
[1:29:00] is right
[1:29:02] and i can love those people and care for
[1:29:04] them again he says i ought not to preach
[1:29:11] until my spirit is right
[1:29:14] i've lost my love
[1:29:17] for people
[1:29:21] i want you to notice here what brother
[1:29:22] branham says and this is just so
[1:29:23] powerful i gotta i don't want to miss it
[1:29:26] he says now a cancer
[1:29:29] that's second greatest enemy the world
[1:29:31] has heart troubles first then cancer and
[1:29:33] tubercular according to the insurance
[1:29:35] companies now the cancer would be called
[1:29:38] in the natural
[1:29:39] a scavenger
[1:29:42] or a buzzard
[1:29:44] something that eats dead things
[1:29:48] this is a cancer brother is beginning to
[1:29:50] talk about this he says this is what a
[1:29:52] cancer is it's like a scavenger or a
[1:29:54] buzzard
[1:29:56] it's something that eats dead things a
[1:29:59] cancer usually comes from a bruise
[1:30:02] a bruise it strikes and the cells break
[1:30:05] and in other words this is the cells in
[1:30:07] other words they backslide
[1:30:10] and then their sets up
[1:30:13] say it with me
[1:30:18] so he's beginning to talk about cancer
[1:30:19] and he says it sets up another life
[1:30:24] it's about it's a bruise it says it
[1:30:26] starts with the bruise starts with
[1:30:27] something he says then those cells
[1:30:30] backslide
[1:30:32] and then their sets up now it didn't say
[1:30:35] it's another life yet
[1:30:36] but the stage has been set the betting
[1:30:39] ground is perfect
[1:30:41] amen
[1:30:42] it's ready to breed
[1:30:44] and make
[1:30:46] life so you say brother matt why are we
[1:30:49] shifting and turning this i want you to
[1:30:51] notice something here because this is
[1:30:52] how brother branham talks about a cancer
[1:30:54] it's amazing
[1:30:56] brother travis has a very close friend
[1:30:58] of his who he
[1:31:00] associate pastor of was us he was or he
[1:31:03] still i guess was uh of the of the
[1:31:06] seaside vineyard church who travis the
[1:31:07] church had came to before he came to our
[1:31:10] church and you know his testimony and
[1:31:12] this man was a very
[1:31:13] influential man
[1:31:15] and his life marcus and was a wonderful
[1:31:18] wonderful brother and just loves the
[1:31:20] lord and had and was just a strong firm
[1:31:23] uh uh individual strong leader just a
[1:31:26] powerful person and served a great role
[1:31:29] of influence in brother travis's life
[1:31:31] and and this this man 68 years old and
[1:31:34] strong and straight you know tall guy
[1:31:36] and and and and i just seen him had just
[1:31:38] met him at a basketball gideon's
[1:31:40] basketball game maybe just a few months
[1:31:42] ago and and now travis coles and this
[1:31:45] man has just been diagnosed had a lump
[1:31:47] that started growing on the side of his
[1:31:49] neck started just like the size of a
[1:31:51] golf ball that was became the size of
[1:31:53] like a nerf football
[1:31:55] and he had this growth and he's
[1:31:57] diagnosed with stage four cancer
[1:32:01] and so brother travis and me went there
[1:32:03] yesterday to
[1:32:04] to encourage him and to also lay hands
[1:32:07] on him and pray for him and it was just
[1:32:09] a
[1:32:10] wonderful powerful the way the lord
[1:32:12] could spend time to testify about it but
[1:32:14] the way the lord met us there
[1:32:16] in that living room with him and his
[1:32:18] wife and then two for a man and a
[1:32:20] husband another husband and wife who
[1:32:21] went to his church and and uh and were
[1:32:24] there also to in who had lost their son
[1:32:26] to cancer were there to encourage him
[1:32:28] and he's been given a death sentence and
[1:32:30] and brother travis just boldness begins
[1:32:32] to just change the atmosphere and it
[1:32:34] begins to testify about the truth and
[1:32:37] and the way the lord opened his eyes to
[1:32:39] the message and the way the lord opened
[1:32:41] his eyes to to the the holy spirit
[1:32:43] changed his entire life when he raised
[1:32:45] up his hands and said lord all i ever
[1:32:47] wanted was you and the world has nothing
[1:32:49] for me and you could just feel the
[1:32:50] atmosphere completely changing as he
[1:32:52] begins to testify to this brother
[1:32:55] and then then i spoke just for a moment
[1:32:57] this is what i spoke to him was on on
[1:33:00] what we're reading here out of this
[1:33:01] message healing brother brandon preaches
[1:33:03] this healing and he has a prayer line
[1:33:04] it's what cancer is
[1:33:06] and i begin to tell him and testify to
[1:33:08] him about what cancer is some of the
[1:33:10] things you're going to read is exactly
[1:33:12] what i quoted to him before we prayed
[1:33:15] brother adam says it's like a scavenger
[1:33:16] buzzer something that eats dead things
[1:33:18] he says it sets up they backslide and
[1:33:21] then there sets up
[1:33:23] another life
[1:33:26] now look the pollen from the male to the
[1:33:28] female is a tiny little germ so small
[1:33:30] the i can't see it it has to be seen
[1:33:32] through glasses and the first little
[1:33:34] thing looks like there is a knot tied in
[1:33:36] that little cell and then it starts in
[1:33:38] the spine and begins to develop cells
[1:33:40] and every seed after its kind log after
[1:33:43] dog human after human foul after foul
[1:33:45] and so forth according to the male and
[1:33:47] female now if you'll notice that little
[1:33:49] germ begins to swell and it forms and
[1:33:52] that was you one time begin to push out
[1:33:56] sales push out sales push out cells
[1:33:59] until it becomes nine months of age born
[1:34:03] then it becomes an adult woman or a man
[1:34:05] and here you are today
[1:34:08] come from one little germ just
[1:34:10] developing cells
[1:34:13] sell on cell
[1:34:17] and he's speaking about a cancer how a
[1:34:18] cancer begins
[1:34:21] and he says well now for instance a
[1:34:23] cancer a cancer comes from a bruise and
[1:34:26] it's a growth so it's so is tumor
[1:34:28] cataract and oh we could spend hours on
[1:34:31] it of what it is now let's say cancer
[1:34:33] now first it's a teeny little cell and
[1:34:36] it begins to develop cells it doesn't
[1:34:37] have any form
[1:34:39] it just goes anyway spreads out with
[1:34:42] legs and some wraps around
[1:34:45] and sums like a rose cancer and diffuses
[1:34:47] red cancer and black cancer and sarcomas
[1:34:50] cancer and different varieties of them
[1:34:52] but they're they're not any certain way
[1:34:54] because they're a spirit
[1:34:57] hold on big clue they're a spirit
[1:35:02] and a spirit
[1:35:04] has no form
[1:35:06] that's exactly what i told marcus i said
[1:35:08] marcus the first thing you need to
[1:35:10] understand is that growth that's on the
[1:35:11] side of your neck is just the vehicle
[1:35:14] it's just the body that's been formed so
[1:35:17] when we pray a doctor deals with the
[1:35:20] body a doctor deals and if he can thank
[1:35:22] god if he can go in there with a knife
[1:35:24] and he could remove it and he could get
[1:35:26] every trace and every ounce of it out
[1:35:28] then wonderful but but but but you got
[1:35:31] to understand it's not the flesh that
[1:35:33] when we pray we're not going to pray
[1:35:35] that the over the flesh but there's a
[1:35:37] spirit that's under that tumor
[1:35:41] there's actually a life
[1:35:44] a living vessel a life
[1:35:48] and it started with the germ it started
[1:35:50] with the bruises it started so small and
[1:35:53] now it builds sale upon cell and now
[1:35:55] it's formed to where you can visibly see
[1:35:57] it i feel like some of you are are just
[1:36:00] struggling with attention here so just
[1:36:02] take just a moment take a deep breath
[1:36:04] i believe this is from the lord i want i
[1:36:06] just feel the holy spirit wanting so
[1:36:08] hard to remember satan will attack you
[1:36:11] so that he could hinder someone else
[1:36:12] from getting their freedom
[1:36:14] so let's all let's all just pay
[1:36:16] attention here real close amen
[1:36:19] he says he says they're not any certain
[1:36:21] way their spirit and a spirit has no
[1:36:23] form you say a cancer spirit yes sir
[1:36:27] i can prove to you that that it is a
[1:36:29] life and the devil now as old-fashioned
[1:36:32] as it seems to be but there's not a
[1:36:33] sickness in the world but what's caused
[1:36:35] by the devil sickness came from the
[1:36:37] devil sickness is in a is he said
[1:36:39] sitting as sickness as a direct or
[1:36:41] indirect result from sin now watch this
[1:36:44] maybe not your sin
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:54] maybe not your sin
[1:36:57] but something you
[1:36:59] inherited
[1:37:01] oh there's a reason for
[1:37:03] everything
[1:37:06] i'm made a certain way i'm built a
[1:37:08] certain way
[1:37:09] i i i'm attracted to certain things i'm
[1:37:12] disattracted and repeal other things i
[1:37:14] have a certain personality and i think a
[1:37:16] certain way
[1:37:17] there's a reason for everything he says
[1:37:19] maybe not your sin
[1:37:21] but something you inherited
[1:37:24] now he's using a physical thing here
[1:37:25] like cancer but he reveals to us that
[1:37:29] beyond that fleshly thing is a spirit i
[1:37:32] just want to extract from that and say
[1:37:35] you may label and attach any physical
[1:37:37] characteristic that you have in your
[1:37:39] life
[1:37:40] i want you to realize it's not a temper
[1:37:43] it's a spirit
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:46] it's not lusting it's a spirit
[1:37:49] there's a life that's there
[1:37:52] it's not pride it's a spirit
[1:37:57] it's not a cancer it's not just not just
[1:37:59] the form not just what you see visibly
[1:38:02] it's a spirit
[1:38:05] and until you recognize you'll keep
[1:38:08] attacking the symptoms
[1:38:10] and you'll keep attacking the body and
[1:38:12] you need to get free of the spirit
[1:38:16] before we had he says but something you
[1:38:17] inherited something you didn't even do
[1:38:20] maybe in your makeup and how you were
[1:38:23] the sign you were born under we read a
[1:38:25] lot about that brother adam uses another
[1:38:27] example of a woman who has heart trouble
[1:38:29] and he says you're just nervous and you
[1:38:30] can hear on there and she's shaking and
[1:38:33] you can hear a voice trembling and
[1:38:34] brother branham he falls into desert and
[1:38:37] says it's a lie
[1:38:38] and he says someone's told a lie on you
[1:38:41] and she says yes brother branham he says
[1:38:43] they're they're claiming at that church
[1:38:45] and he's a man who professes divine
[1:38:46] healing and he's called you a witch and
[1:38:49] immediately what happens the spirit
[1:38:53] the heart disease is the body the heart
[1:38:55] disease is the physical condition but
[1:38:58] now brother random doesn't speak to the
[1:38:59] heart he speaks to the spirit that's
[1:39:02] hiding behind
[1:39:04] the body
[1:39:07] and he says it's a lie they've told a
[1:39:09] lie on you and immediately that woman
[1:39:11] begins to say yes and then brother
[1:39:13] branham says
[1:39:14] you're not a witch
[1:39:18] you're a daughter of god and right there
[1:39:21] she's free
[1:39:24] what did it take was it hocus pocus and
[1:39:26] it wasn't that brother all it took was
[1:39:28] the exposing of the spirit
[1:39:32] and when the devil's exposed for who he
[1:39:35] is
[1:39:36] that's why it's important for you to
[1:39:37] with your
[1:39:38] mouth with your mouth i loved our camp
[1:39:41] that we had and brother diggs said it's
[1:39:43] important in a prayer line you have a
[1:39:45] prayer line where kids just pass through
[1:39:46] and they have their hands that's
[1:39:48] wonderful i have nothing against that in
[1:39:49] some youth camps there's too many to
[1:39:51] pray for everybody
[1:39:53] but we said we want to do something
[1:39:54] we've only got about 400 kids we're
[1:39:56] going to do something different we're
[1:39:57] going to create a prayer line a prayer
[1:39:58] line a prayer we're going to have uh
[1:40:00] five or six ministers
[1:40:02] and there we were at camp and the reason
[1:40:04] we did it that way is brother dick says
[1:40:06] i found in prayer and deliverance it's
[1:40:09] important that the young person with
[1:40:12] their mouth speaks what their problem is
[1:40:17] it's important that they confess with
[1:40:20] their mouth and they identify not just
[1:40:22] to generally say i just need the lord
[1:40:24] you can say that but you've got to speak
[1:40:27] to the spirit that's tripping you up and
[1:40:30] say i'm addicted to this and it's a
[1:40:32] spirit my depression is not who i am my
[1:40:35] anxiety is not who i am my addiction is
[1:40:38] not who i am i'm a child of god and i'm
[1:40:40] going to identify the spirit so that i
[1:40:43] can be free
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:47] what did brother man do he exposed the
[1:40:50] devil and the devil when the light of
[1:40:53] god's word exposes him he has no choice
[1:40:56] but to run
[1:41:01] there's a reason for
[1:41:02] everything heart trouble there was a
[1:41:05] reason for it
[1:41:06] are you here
[1:41:09] he says after sin came he says that
[1:41:10] maybe not something you did but
[1:41:12] something you inherited now watch watch
[1:41:14] this cancer now say oh my hand now
[1:41:16] there's one there's none there now look
[1:41:18] at my hand there's no cancer there now
[1:41:20] there could be someday well there it is
[1:41:23] then if it's a growth comes on that hand
[1:41:25] a cancer whatever it may be it's another
[1:41:29] hello
[1:41:31] it's another
[1:41:33] life
[1:41:35] and we're preaching on
[1:41:37] on deliverance here this morning to
[1:41:39] being being changed
[1:41:41] being delivered he says it's another
[1:41:44] life it's developing a different cell
[1:41:48] through it is a cell but it started from
[1:41:51] a life just like you started first
[1:41:53] before that little germ that's as far as
[1:41:55] we can tear your body down to that one
[1:41:56] single cell then the little germ is a
[1:41:58] tiny little cell but beyond that cell is
[1:42:01] a spirit because it's got a life well
[1:42:03] then that life came from god for you but
[1:42:06] where did this life this cancer where
[1:42:08] did this life or death come in your body
[1:42:10] which it's called cancer who brought
[1:42:12] that there that's the devil
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:17] that's
[1:42:18] the devil
[1:42:20] now jesus called it a devil and by being
[1:42:23] a minister that terms that's the terms
[1:42:24] of take that's what the bible says i
[1:42:26] want you to notice this he says today we
[1:42:28] see a man that's deaf
[1:42:29] and dumb the doctors say well his vocal
[1:42:32] cord is dead his hearing over here his
[1:42:34] eardrums the nerve died what caused it
[1:42:36] doctor well i don't know it just died
[1:42:39] some fever done it or something well why
[1:42:42] didn't the nerves die all over see it
[1:42:44] just died there now jesus said
[1:42:47] that it was a deaf spirit
[1:42:51] is that right
[1:42:52] that's when the deaf and dumb spirit
[1:42:54] came out of a man he could speak and
[1:42:56] hear now it's just like a transparent
[1:42:58] band around my hand shutting the
[1:43:00] circulation off you notice these people
[1:43:03] come up on the platform here that's deaf
[1:43:05] and dumb walk off speaking and hearing
[1:43:08] you can go to this tape and you can
[1:43:10] scream you can fast forward it to the
[1:43:11] prayer line and there's a man who comes
[1:43:13] up completely deaf brother branham says
[1:43:15] can you hear me man doesn't say anything
[1:43:17] the prophet of god exposes the devil and
[1:43:20] then says can you hear me the man says
[1:43:21] yes i can hear you can you hear that
[1:43:23] better yes brother hallelujah i'm free i
[1:43:25] can hear a deaf spirit not a deaf nerve
[1:43:29] that's dead but he spoke to the life
[1:43:32] that was squeezing his eardrum
[1:43:37] and that spirit breaks and the man can
[1:43:38] hear
[1:43:41] he says now what happens no man comes
[1:43:43] here he's deaf you've seen it night
[1:43:44] after night he can't hear a woman she's
[1:43:46] looking around now on the ears i want
[1:43:47] you to notice this because this is
[1:43:48] exactly what i said to marcus i said
[1:43:50] marcus now the doctor's doing his job he
[1:43:53] calls it a cancer scientifically he gave
[1:43:55] it a name but when i pray i'm not going
[1:43:57] to call it a cancer i'm going to call it
[1:44:00] i'm not going to speak to the cancer i'm
[1:44:02] going to speak to this life that's
[1:44:04] behind that cancer living
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:08] you say well what did jesus do well look
[1:44:10] what jesus did when just as mark 9 25
[1:44:12] when jesus saw that the people came
[1:44:14] running together he rebuked the foul
[1:44:17] spirit
[1:44:18] saying unto him thou dumb and deaf
[1:44:24] spirit
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:27] you see there's a reason for everything
[1:44:32] i charge thee come out of him
[1:44:35] well that's just the way i was born and
[1:44:37] i was don't accept the lie of the devil
[1:44:40] that's just how i was born and i how
[1:44:42] could god ever judge me i was born this
[1:44:44] way no no no the bible says that you all
[1:44:47] have a choice that's what you are born
[1:44:49] with that's a choice
[1:44:51] and whether you have a memory
[1:44:53] or a you're conscious enough to the time
[1:44:55] when you gave entrance to a spirit
[1:44:58] doesn't change the fact that the reason
[1:45:00] you're that way is because you've
[1:45:02] accepted a spirit amen
[1:45:06] well i'm suicidal i'm i'm just i'm
[1:45:09] depressed and i'm i'm i'm this and i've
[1:45:11] just i've found that i'm just that way
[1:45:12] i'm i'm this that way just that's how i
[1:45:14] was born friends i'm not here to attack
[1:45:17] you or to condemn you i'm here to tell
[1:45:18] you the lord jesus can set you free of
[1:45:22] any spirit but you first got to
[1:45:24] recognize it as a spirit
[1:45:27] you first got to realize that's not me
[1:45:30] that's not who i am
[1:45:33] each is led away when he sins he's led
[1:45:36] away of his own
[1:45:37] lusts
[1:45:39] so you've accepted something somewhere
[1:45:41] and you're in bondage you're a slave
[1:45:44] whether you realize it or not you're a
[1:45:46] slave to that thing but let me give you
[1:45:48] the good news a slave can be set free
[1:45:51] and we've got a message of emancipation
[1:45:54] who can set you free of any spirit
[1:45:57] let me tell you what the spirit what a
[1:45:59] what a foul spirit will do in a service
[1:46:01] like this
[1:46:02] your message of freedom has been
[1:46:04] preached and the devil has your mind
[1:46:06] distracted on a million different things
[1:46:08] let me tell you what that is that's not
[1:46:10] you you're a child of god that's the
[1:46:13] devil pushing thoughts into your mind
[1:46:15] getting you to think about after the
[1:46:16] service before the service what's
[1:46:18] happening in your life because when free
[1:46:20] you know you know when the devil gets
[1:46:21] the scaredest
[1:46:23] when jesus is the closest
[1:46:26] you when the devil fights the hardest
[1:46:28] and tries everything to get every kind
[1:46:30] of thought in your mind he's saying this
[1:46:32] because and he's talking about and it's
[1:46:34] just a man he's just listen when jesus
[1:46:36] is the closest
[1:46:38] the devil begins to do everything he
[1:46:40] possibly can because he knows if he's
[1:46:42] exposed he's got to leave
[1:46:47] jesus spoke to that spirit and said thou
[1:46:49] deaf and dumb spirit i charge thee come
[1:46:51] out of him
[1:46:54] and enter him no enter no more in them
[1:46:58] then it's brother adam says then it's an
[1:46:59] unseen force just like a transparent
[1:47:01] band around my hand no no matter how
[1:47:03] much sav you put on the end of this
[1:47:05] finger brother adam says like a band
[1:47:07] like a rubber band that's been squeezed
[1:47:08] onto this hand and he says no matter how
[1:47:10] much salve you put on this the end of
[1:47:12] this finger
[1:47:14] around my hand no matter how much that
[1:47:16] you put on the end of this finger it's
[1:47:17] got the circulation shut off and it
[1:47:19] can't get well
[1:47:21] until you move
[1:47:23] this band
[1:47:27] well i'm just gonna keep coming to
[1:47:28] church and i'm just gonna i'm just gonna
[1:47:30] keep doing the same exact thing and i'm
[1:47:32] just gonna keep on going and keep on
[1:47:33] going remember i preached years many
[1:47:35] years ago and brother branham the the
[1:47:36] the bible actually speaks about the
[1:47:38] spirit of of of bondage that it's like a
[1:47:41] snake
[1:47:42] and it's like a python and a python you
[1:47:45] know how it kills its prey it doesn't
[1:47:47] have any venomous bite so it wraps
[1:47:49] itself around its victim
[1:47:53] and then every time that that victim
[1:47:55] breathes in
[1:47:57] it cinches up just a little tighter
[1:48:02] and no matter how much salve you put on
[1:48:04] the forehead of that person or how much
[1:48:06] you anoint them or how much you pray for
[1:48:08] them until you break the python
[1:48:11] the band the spirit that's binding them
[1:48:16] and every time they breathe in
[1:48:18] it gets a little tighter
[1:48:21] they keep coming to church
[1:48:24] that spirit's still there
[1:48:27] worship's there shouldn't worship set
[1:48:29] them free it should there's the
[1:48:30] preaching of the word there there's the
[1:48:32] pull of the word the atmosphere is being
[1:48:34] created but that python every time they
[1:48:36] breathe in
[1:48:37] every time they say oh it's just me
[1:48:39] i was just born this way
[1:48:43] i could never be free
[1:48:46] there's no hope for me
[1:48:51] and then you see them in church and
[1:48:52] they're anemic they can't even hear the
[1:48:54] preaching of the word of god
[1:49:00] say brother matt what do you got to do
[1:49:01] for someone like that you got to break
[1:49:03] the spirit
[1:49:07] there's a reason for everything
[1:49:14] you speak to it
[1:49:17] you call it what it is
[1:49:20] you identify it
[1:49:22] not me identifying it to you i may not
[1:49:24] have identified your specific problem
[1:49:26] through words i've used this morning
[1:49:29] but you've heard the word
[1:49:32] and now it's up to you
[1:49:34] to identify and say this foul
[1:49:37] spirit
[1:49:39] that i may not have done anything to
[1:49:41] deserve and have been somebody else and
[1:49:43] it was this that or the other but lord i
[1:49:45] just i'm going to confess it i'm going
[1:49:47] to repent of it this morning i'm going
[1:49:49] to raise my hands and say lord i need
[1:49:51] freedom i recognize the toxic nature of
[1:49:54] sin that dwells within me i dwell and
[1:49:57] see inside of me there's no good thing
[1:49:59] and i want to be free i want to break
[1:50:00] the ban
[1:50:02] i want to free the circulation
[1:50:05] hallelujah
[1:50:07] he says it's got the circulation shelf
[1:50:09] it can't get well until you move this
[1:50:11] band well now that band and the k in
[1:50:13] this case he says in this case i'm
[1:50:15] talking about deafness it's the spirit
[1:50:16] of an unseen person when that thing is
[1:50:18] cast away of course that gives nature a
[1:50:20] chance to operate then they begin to
[1:50:22] hear now cancer begins to develop a body
[1:50:24] gets larger large it's got one
[1:50:25] alternative
[1:50:27] it's got one alternative this is what
[1:50:29] that cancer inside of you wants to do to
[1:50:32] you it wants to take
[1:50:35] your life
[1:50:38] now all the natural is spiritual you
[1:50:40] believe that don't you now the cancer
[1:50:42] come into this store place or that
[1:50:44] bruised place he took a body he begins
[1:50:46] to suck on your blood
[1:50:49] one purpose
[1:50:52] one purpose
[1:50:54] take your life
[1:50:55] the doctor can cut it out if there's one
[1:50:57] speck of it left it'll start right there
[1:50:59] growing again now the thing happens in
[1:51:02] the way if the doctor could operate and
[1:51:04] take it out that's very well that's good
[1:51:06] he will take it out now on the doctor's
[1:51:08] way of destroying my body or your body
[1:51:11] if you was a cancer would just will be
[1:51:13] just diminish me from this earth that's
[1:51:15] all now the way of divine healing it
[1:51:17] isn't dealing with that body at all it's
[1:51:20] dealing with the life that's in the body
[1:51:23] if you was a cancer and i was healing
[1:51:25] the earth of you being a cancer i'd call
[1:51:27] your life out of you well there lays
[1:51:30] your body well your body is just as
[1:51:31] natural there as it would be if the life
[1:51:33] was in it it's laying there and every
[1:51:35] feature and everything now many people
[1:51:38] don't understand divine healing that's
[1:51:39] the reason they never get their divine
[1:51:41] healing
[1:51:44] they don't realize they're not dealing
[1:51:46] with the physical outward external
[1:51:50] problem
[1:51:52] but the problem is something you were
[1:51:54] born with
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:59] it's a problem with something you're
[1:52:01] born with
[1:52:03] i said brother matt i thought you said i
[1:52:05] was i was not born this way well well
[1:52:08] here's the one here's the one thing you
[1:52:10] were born with a carnal nature
[1:52:13] and that sticky nature can bring into
[1:52:15] every kind of complex and every kind of
[1:52:18] fear and anxiety and hurt and pain and
[1:52:21] you know the devil will give you phantom
[1:52:23] pain
[1:52:25] man the devil has sold so many people
[1:52:27] placebos of pain
[1:52:32] he'll do anything he can to make you
[1:52:34] think someone spoke about you or they
[1:52:36] did it and they had an agenda and they
[1:52:38] did it because of this and that person
[1:52:39] be completely oblivious to anything
[1:52:42] happening
[1:52:43] and as innocent as as the day is long
[1:52:45] and but the devil will give you phantom
[1:52:48] pain
[1:52:49] well that person and this that they just
[1:52:50] did this because of this don't you
[1:52:52] realize that's the devil speaking to you
[1:52:55] don't you realize that's the devil
[1:52:56] speaking to you
[1:52:58] anytime the devil's in your mind
[1:53:00] whispering he'll be telling you about
[1:53:01] this person that person said this and
[1:53:03] they're thinking this and they're just
[1:53:05] doing this and i'm not part of their
[1:53:06] group and i must not be good enough and
[1:53:08] they must not like me in this group over
[1:53:10] and this person listen friends it's a
[1:53:12] lie of the devil and until you expose it
[1:53:15] and say i want free of it it'll keep
[1:53:18] polluting you and poisoning you and
[1:53:20] sucking the life out of
[1:53:23] you amen
[1:53:27] many people don't understand i want you
[1:53:28] to notice this here i want you to watch
[1:53:30] what brother brandon begins to do here
[1:53:32] i'm just going to close it's 12 50
[1:53:34] 4 and i just want to i want to come to
[1:53:36] something and then stop
[1:53:38] listen the way brother brandon begins to
[1:53:39] deal with this case of this young man
[1:53:43] now
[1:53:44] remember we spoke we we we've taken a
[1:53:47] lot of time to to lay a good foundation
[1:53:49] on this so
[1:53:51] i trust that you just write with me
[1:53:54] there's a reason to everything
[1:53:57] and until you identify
[1:54:00] he said brother matt while i don't have
[1:54:02] in a in a private interview what would
[1:54:04] brother branham do he would begin to go
[1:54:06] in those private interviews and he would
[1:54:07] begin to listen and diagnose and begin
[1:54:09] to pray we gave examples of of of a man
[1:54:12] that goes to a honeymoon he comes back
[1:54:14] he goes there's blows up doesn't know
[1:54:16] why he's angry
[1:54:17] as brother says just just marry this man
[1:54:20] he's wonderful he's happy but you know
[1:54:21] something triggered something something
[1:54:23] triggered in him
[1:54:25] and he comes back and the marriage is
[1:54:27] about just right starting about to end
[1:54:29] and brother branham says just then he
[1:54:31] said the lord just revealed what it was
[1:54:34] and he said and set that man free
[1:54:39] takes that woman as we gave remember a
[1:54:41] story of the woman who was chased by
[1:54:42] that dog when she was a little girl
[1:54:45] and she lives her entire life because of
[1:54:47] a fear
[1:54:48] there was a spirit that came upon her
[1:54:51] and it haunted her and haunted her and
[1:54:54] haunted her and troubled her she was
[1:54:56] nervous
[1:54:57] and brother brandon begins to diagnose
[1:54:59] and goes in discernment looks at her
[1:55:00] life and says when you were just a
[1:55:01] little girl you were chased by a dog
[1:55:04] that put a fear inside of you you didn't
[1:55:06] realize it you didn't recognize it but
[1:55:08] you've grown up with that life
[1:55:10] that's been growing and growing and
[1:55:12] growing and growing like a tumor and
[1:55:15] there's a spirit there
[1:55:18] and it's haunting you and it's tripping
[1:55:20] you up and it's making you the way that
[1:55:22] you are
[1:55:24] and brother branham you you say brother
[1:55:26] matthew then then what what what what do
[1:55:28] you do for a person the work actually at
[1:55:30] that point
[1:55:31] if the woman would just accept it the
[1:55:34] work's over
[1:55:36] it's over
[1:55:37] the devil's exposed he already knows man
[1:55:39] he's three miles up the road
[1:55:44] because it's not the job of brother
[1:55:46] brandon remember brother and says i'm
[1:55:47] not the healer i can't heal you but if
[1:55:49] jesus were here
[1:55:51] and he says and he was here as a man
[1:55:53] he'd lay his hands on you
[1:55:55] and he'd do sometimes he would take
[1:55:57] earth he would take as we said here
[1:55:59] preach the last time he'd spit into the
[1:56:00] ground and he'd
[1:56:02] he'd take some put some mud over their
[1:56:04] eye like this you say why was jesus
[1:56:06] doing that because jesus had had a was
[1:56:08] trying to get you to understand there's
[1:56:10] a connection between the physical world
[1:56:12] and the spiritual world and what you do
[1:56:15] physically has a reaction spiritually
[1:56:18] i testified to marcus of sister elena
[1:56:21] curlett sister elena butts there in
[1:56:23] minden and brother tim's church
[1:56:24] testified to her we stood the pictures
[1:56:26] here some number of years ago and and he
[1:56:28] this marcus his wife had just got
[1:56:30] through telling me he was diagnosed with
[1:56:31] hodgkin's lymphoma and i and i told her
[1:56:33] i said that's a and stage four said you
[1:56:35] know i got a good friend of ours who's
[1:56:37] at a church just uh louisiana there and
[1:56:39] she was diagnosed the day before
[1:56:41] christmas or the day after day before
[1:56:43] right near christmas was diagnosed with
[1:56:45] hodgkin's lymphoma stage four same exact
[1:56:48] thing showed him the pet scan which he
[1:56:50] showed me marcus his wife mary showed us
[1:56:53] the pet scan of marcus and you could see
[1:56:54] the lumps you could see the cancer and i
[1:56:56] said here's her pet skin and you could
[1:56:58] see in in elena's arms here in the pet
[1:57:01] scan like this and you could see this
[1:57:03] lump that was here this big black spot
[1:57:05] of this cancer and i was just testifying
[1:57:07] to him and i said see right there's her
[1:57:10] before and i said but sister elena had
[1:57:12] been prayed for and she'd been praying
[1:57:14] and asking the lord to touch her and to
[1:57:16] heal her of this and and she was in a
[1:57:18] service in a service in a church service
[1:57:20] on a sunday morning i said no it doesn't
[1:57:21] have to be church we we can
[1:57:23] traditionalize things doesn't have to be
[1:57:24] church but she was in church that sunday
[1:57:26] morning she's sitting there and the word
[1:57:28] was going forth and this after the word
[1:57:31] went forth they were singing i said the
[1:57:32] lord just said something came upon her
[1:57:35] heart and something came upon her spirit
[1:57:37] she said david danced before the lord
[1:57:39] and the with the when the ark was
[1:57:40] returned and and marry him took a
[1:57:42] tambourine and danced and sister elena
[1:57:44] said she got up out of her seat and as
[1:57:47] awkward as it was as much as it might
[1:57:49] have embarrassed her as much as people
[1:57:50] might have thought she's crazy what's
[1:57:52] she doing i said she started running
[1:57:54] around the church you can go back online
[1:57:56] and go to brother tim's website and see
[1:57:57] sister elena jumping like this running
[1:58:00] across the church doing a jericho march
[1:58:02] hallelujah hallelujah she said the lord
[1:58:04] just anointed her faith to do that
[1:58:06] what was it she was doing something
[1:58:09] physically and it got the attention of
[1:58:12] something spiritually
[1:58:15] remember brother brandon picks up that
[1:58:16] rock and he throws it up in the air and
[1:58:18] it started a little whirlwind and an
[1:58:20] earthquake strunk a lot salmo sankulaski
[1:58:22] said what was it something in the
[1:58:24] physical dimension atta attached itself
[1:58:27] to a spiritual dimension
[1:58:30] and i said now here she went days later
[1:58:32] for her pet scan and i said here's the
[1:58:34] new pet scan and the cancer is
[1:58:36] completely gone completely clear that's
[1:58:38] two or three years ago she's living
[1:58:40] cancer free today from stage four
[1:58:43] hopkins lymphoma because why there was a
[1:58:46] spirit
[1:58:48] not the cancer that was exposed
[1:58:56] and something that had been infesting
[1:58:58] and something had been laying in her
[1:59:00] life
[1:59:02] is now set free
[1:59:06] because something physically
[1:59:09] something that she did
[1:59:10] maybe all you have to do this morning is
[1:59:12] just physically outwardly with your own
[1:59:15] lips and vocal cords
[1:59:18] confess it
[1:59:20] and say lord i want free
[1:59:24] there's freedom here this morning
[1:59:26] in this church on this sunday morning on
[1:59:28] march 13th there's freedom here this
[1:59:31] morning
[1:59:32] and slaves can be set free may have
[1:59:34] something that bound you and tied you up
[1:59:37] tied up your mind maybe in your spirit
[1:59:39] god can set you free of that
[1:59:44] watch how brother brandon begins to deal
[1:59:46] with something in this young man he says
[1:59:47] for instance a few moments ago a few
[1:59:48] days ago i was called in on the scene or
[1:59:50] a little something going on there was a
[1:59:52] fine young man very fine boy he was
[1:59:54] going with the girl very fine little
[1:59:55] girl out of a fine family this boy all
[1:59:57] of a sudden came up with some of an idea
[1:59:59] he just walked away he did something
[2:00:01] wrong to the little girl as much as
[2:00:03] promised her to do a certain thing and
[2:00:04] then he didn't do it and instead of
[2:00:06] coming to the girl and apologizing like
[2:00:09] a gentleman should do
[2:00:12] it just
[2:00:14] wasn't
[2:00:15] in him
[2:00:17] to do it
[2:00:18] there's a reason for everything
[2:00:22] he couldn't apologize unforgiveness
[2:00:24] couldn't say he was sorry
[2:00:27] and the father and mother called me to
[2:00:28] the scene and said we would desire to
[2:00:30] know what's wrong with her boy
[2:00:32] now it's not easy to do sometimes but
[2:00:34] you must be truthful and honest
[2:00:36] therefore the boy was a christian now
[2:00:38] notice you've got to follow this close
[2:00:40] the boy was a christian
[2:00:42] as far as a believer
[2:00:46] that's going to clarify that here in a
[2:00:47] moment
[2:00:48] he was a christian what is a christian a
[2:00:50] person who names the name of christ
[2:00:52] that's
[2:00:53] the terminology brother branham is using
[2:00:55] here as far as a believer he wasn't born
[2:00:57] again you mean you can be a professed
[2:00:59] christian a professed believer not be
[2:01:01] born of the spirit yes amen
[2:01:04] he had repented
[2:01:08] he had been baptized
[2:01:10] he had his
[2:01:11] position among the believers
[2:01:14] yet had not received the baptism
[2:01:17] of the holy spirit
[2:01:20] all that was before the seals ah let's
[2:01:22] look at the date there 63 august
[2:01:29] yeah he had not received the baptism of
[2:01:31] the holy spirit no matter how much he
[2:01:34] thought no matter how much mom thought
[2:01:37] no matter how much dad thought no matter
[2:01:39] how much the pastor thought no matter
[2:01:41] how much the rest of the church had saw
[2:01:43] amen
[2:01:44] amen
[2:01:45] he had not received the baptism of the
[2:01:47] holy ghost
[2:01:48] you thinking you have
[2:01:50] and having it is two different things
[2:01:54] you might be able to try to say you have
[2:01:56] you might be able to show some evidence
[2:01:58] of some emotions but unless your life
[2:02:02] is vindicating what you're professing to
[2:02:05] have you still haven't got it
[2:02:09] we preach against a lot of things about
[2:02:11] your life what it manifests why brother
[2:02:14] matter we all about sin all about how we
[2:02:16] dress no but your dress identifies how
[2:02:18] you what's what's happened took place in
[2:02:19] your life
[2:02:21] where you go identifies if your life is
[2:02:23] coping with the word
[2:02:25] what you watch identifies and it's not
[2:02:27] to identify to criticize you it's to get
[2:02:30] you to recognize to open your eyes
[2:02:35] he says unless your life copes he says
[2:02:38] he says but unless your life is
[2:02:39] vindicating what you're professing you
[2:02:41] still haven't got it no matter how many
[2:02:42] emotions how much you jump run
[2:02:43] sensations speaking in tongues or
[2:02:45] shouting whatever you might lay upon
[2:02:46] which is all right i believe in all that
[2:02:48] too
[2:02:49] but unless your life copes with your
[2:02:51] testimony you
[2:02:53] haven't
[2:02:54] got it
[2:02:55] help us lord make our call in an
[2:02:57] election can somebody say that with me
[2:02:59] here can we unify as bethel tabernacle
[2:03:02] and say help us to make our call in and
[2:03:04] he go if you raise your hands if you
[2:03:06] want to unify with that and say lord
[2:03:08] help us to make our call in an election
[2:03:10] sure
[2:03:11] to work out our own salvation with fear
[2:03:13] and trembling
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:15] amen and he says unless then you have it
[2:03:17] because the fruit of the spirit
[2:03:18] vindicates what you are just like the
[2:03:20] fruit of any tree tells you what it is
[2:03:23] jesus said by their fruits you shall
[2:03:24] know them now this young fellow's
[2:03:26] parents his mother why are you going to
[2:03:28] his parent why
[2:03:30] brother branham would you go to his mom
[2:03:31] and dad there's a reason
[2:03:35] for everything
[2:03:37] i want you to chill i want to challenge
[2:03:39] you here this morning
[2:03:40] there's a reason for everything now the
[2:03:43] father
[2:03:44] uh this the mother is german no
[2:03:46] reflection on the german
[2:03:48] but there's a strain
[2:03:50] in that family that is they'll just sit
[2:03:54] you can talk to them they'll just stare
[2:03:56] you right in the face
[2:03:58] like a lot of people this morning
[2:04:03] this girl's sister the mother of this
[2:04:06] boy her sister i've come down the street
[2:04:08] many morning this young lady being
[2:04:10] sitting out in the yard i'd say good
[2:04:12] morning to you she just looked at me
[2:04:15] i'd stop and i'd say
[2:04:17] sure a fine morning
[2:04:19] she would just stand
[2:04:21] look right at you
[2:04:22] an intelligent woman
[2:04:24] and i'd say
[2:04:25] come up to see us sometime
[2:04:28] she'd just stand and look
[2:04:30] well her brothers are the are that way
[2:04:33] father and mother
[2:04:35] is that way there's a strain on that
[2:04:37] family
[2:04:40] born of the spirit of god the father and
[2:04:42] mother were
[2:04:45] hold on logjam
[2:04:49] no don't let your minds explode
[2:04:51] there are strains upon that family that
[2:04:53] are not removed with the baptism of the
[2:04:55] holy ghost it's something you're at war
[2:04:58] with and you've got to fight
[2:05:00] and you've got to starve out that old
[2:05:02] nature
[2:05:04] and feed the new nature
[2:05:06] or else that old nature will bring you
[2:05:08] back into bondage
[2:05:09] say a believer well didn't paul say be
[2:05:11] you not entangled again
[2:05:14] with a yoke of bondage wherewith christ
[2:05:16] has set you free
[2:05:19] father and mother that way now the
[2:05:20] father of the boy let's go to the father
[2:05:23] is strictly an irishman moody
[2:05:27] high tempered
[2:05:29] high strong
[2:05:31] you could think of a lot of people
[2:05:33] brother brannon was thinking about
[2:05:34] himself
[2:05:36] because this is his family
[2:05:40] that's his whole family like that except
[2:05:42] one
[2:05:43] other out of the family
[2:05:46] converted
[2:05:48] now in this this boy the father and
[2:05:51] mother both are christians
[2:05:54] filled with the holy ghost and they have
[2:05:56] brought this young man up in the way of
[2:05:57] the lord now the young man is about 17
[2:06:00] or 18 years old something along there
[2:06:02] very fine kid he's been a real model boy
[2:06:04] at home nice kid he's got a brother
[2:06:07] that's just vice versa
[2:06:09] but the girls the mother's family lives
[2:06:13] close to a fine church but do you think
[2:06:15] they'd ever come over there no
[2:06:18] they know it's right but it's just not
[2:06:22] in them
[2:06:23] to ask
[2:06:25] forgiveness
[2:06:26] or ask
[2:06:28] pardoning
[2:06:29] isn't it incredible brother branham says
[2:06:32] some of the family goes to this church
[2:06:35] and other of the family go to the church
[2:06:37] down the road
[2:06:39] now why is that brother matt
[2:06:41] because they can't ask for forgiveness
[2:06:42] it's amazing his brother jason i was
[2:06:45] streaming last night he was preaching
[2:06:46] brother john andy's his title pride and
[2:06:49] his prisoners
[2:06:52] it's amazing how much what pride will do
[2:06:55] to a believer
[2:07:00] they know it's right but it's just not
[2:07:01] in the natural forgiveness they're part
[2:07:03] of them they just won't do it it's just
[2:07:04] not in them now the genes in the father
[2:07:06] and the mother of this boy no matter how
[2:07:09] much they are converted
[2:07:12] still remains the flesh
[2:07:15] that's been interbred out to this boy
[2:07:19] therefore the boy has got a complex in
[2:07:22] him remember brother adam says the sin
[2:07:25] maybe not your sin
[2:07:28] there's a reason for everything
[2:07:30] therefore the boy's got a complex just
[2:07:32] like his mother's family they are not
[2:07:33] forgiving they will not apologize that's
[2:07:36] where the boy stands

[2:08:35] to forgive you he's got this little
[2:08:36] problem i need your help brother branham
[2:08:38] now look at you
[2:08:40] talking to the dad
[2:08:42] out of your family all of them drunks
[2:08:46] fighting shooting and cutting and so
[2:08:50] forth
[2:08:51] now look at your family to the mother
[2:08:53] now he points to the mother there are a
[2:08:55] bunch of people just sit there and won't
[2:08:57] speak very independent
[2:09:00] so forth irreverent to religion
[2:09:03] but i said
[2:09:05] it's not you
[2:09:09] you're the only one of all your sisters
[2:09:12] and brothers
[2:09:13] and you're sweet
[2:09:14] kind and forgiving
[2:09:17] what does that
[2:09:18] your tree part of that family tree yet
[2:09:22] you have received the holy ghost
[2:09:24] that's the thing that made you tender
[2:09:27] and sweet
[2:09:29] it's not your people anymore
[2:09:35] it's your christ that lives in you
[2:09:40] it's not your people
[2:09:42] when you're really born of the spirit of
[2:09:44] god you are no longer bound it may be a
[2:09:47] point of influence but you are no longer
[2:09:50] bound by anything in your past
[2:09:55] that ought to set you free this morning
[2:09:57] when you are born of the spirit of god
[2:09:59] you are no longer a slave
[2:10:03] to your past
[2:10:07] that's not your people anymore that's
[2:10:10] your christ that lives in you i said to
[2:10:11] the boy this is to the this is to the
[2:10:13] father
[2:10:14] look at your family practically all of
[2:10:17] them are drunks i said and how moody and
[2:10:18] high tempered and high strung
[2:10:21] but you're not
[2:10:23] you're kind
[2:10:25] you're forgiving what is it say brother
[2:10:28] matt what is that sweet nature what is
[2:10:30] that thing that wants to forgive what is
[2:10:32] that thing that desires though i may not
[2:10:35] know how to perform it what is it in me
[2:10:37] that craves for the word of god what is
[2:10:39] it inside of me that when i hear the
[2:10:41] preaching of the word i raise my hands
[2:10:43] and say amen what is it in me that when
[2:10:46] i sin i fight just feel so guilty and i
[2:10:48] just repent and feel so sorry it's not
[2:10:51] you brother or sister that's your christ
[2:10:54] that's living down inside of you
[2:10:56] that's the real you
[2:10:58] that's the real part of you that's
[2:11:00] eternal that will never fade away
[2:11:05] he says you're kind you're forgiving
[2:11:07] what is it that's the holy spirit you're
[2:11:09] no more what you are it's christ in you
[2:11:13] and i said now that same thing has to
[2:11:17] happen to
[2:11:18] your son
[2:11:20] amen the father raised up much like many
[2:11:22] parents do much like i'm sure i would
[2:11:24] have
[2:11:26] my son went to the altar
[2:11:29] he was baptized correctly in the name of
[2:11:30] jesus and water baptism in the pool said
[2:11:32] i know my son has come to christ
[2:11:35] i said
[2:11:37] may be all right the outward emotions he
[2:11:39] might be identified as a believer with
[2:11:41] believers
[2:11:42] but until he's regenerated
[2:11:45] born again
[2:11:47] i'd advise that young man to never
[2:11:50] marry a woman
[2:11:53] why
[2:11:54] because pain
[2:11:55] transfers to pain
[2:12:00] let me just say this and i'm just gonna
[2:12:02] just pause just for a moment
[2:12:06] this is why it's so important you know
[2:12:08] none of us are perfect
[2:12:11] none of us are good
[2:12:13] oh my god
[2:12:16] but it's so important before a man
[2:12:19] lord help us to teach this correctly to
[2:12:21] our young people
[2:12:22] lord help us to be good examples
[2:12:25] in our life
[2:12:27] you could never lead someone to a place
[2:12:30] you've never been yourself
[2:12:34] you may be able to try and give them
[2:12:36] directions i could tell you how to get
[2:12:37] to a person's house but if i've never
[2:12:40] been there before i can't lead you there
[2:12:41] myself
[2:12:44] and it's amazing how many times someone
[2:12:46] never confronts
[2:12:48] their own self
[2:12:51] and never can open up their heart enough
[2:12:54] to them own self you know sometimes you
[2:12:56] lie and some of the biggest persons we
[2:12:58] deceive is our self
[2:13:00] you never face who you are as a person
[2:13:03] and you never open up all your channels
[2:13:05] and open up every corner and give the
[2:13:07] lord every key
[2:13:09] and you take those same people who have
[2:13:11] never really dealt with the pain from a
[2:13:13] dad or from a mom or from a pastor or
[2:13:16] done wrong or a church or bitterness or
[2:13:18] some situation if you never and you
[2:13:20] block that and you defend that and you
[2:13:23] just don't want to touch that
[2:13:25] and then you attach yourself to a wife
[2:13:27] and you get
[2:13:28] married and then you have children and
[2:13:32] that unprocessed and undealt with issue
[2:13:36] now that pain is just going to be
[2:13:37] transferred to another generation
[2:13:41] it's important
[2:13:42] we clean out the channels brother
[2:13:45] i say this morning lord clean them all
[2:13:47] out
[2:13:48] clean out every channel lord
[2:13:50] purge my mind purge my spirit let me be
[2:13:53] able to confront my own self in the
[2:13:56] mirror
[2:13:58] anything i see that's not according to
[2:14:00] the life of christ well it's just my
[2:14:02] personality you need to stop saying that
[2:14:05] because your personality needs to be the
[2:14:07] person of jesus
[2:14:12] that's why brother branham says i'd
[2:14:14] advise him don't get married
[2:14:16] he'll make hell on earth for her until
[2:14:19] that gentle
[2:14:21] sweet
[2:14:22] forgiving spirit of christ
[2:14:25] comes in i just want to raise my hand
[2:14:28] maybe you want to say it with me and say
[2:14:29] let that humble
[2:14:31] gentle
[2:14:32] sweet
[2:14:33] forgiving spirit of christ
[2:14:36] let it come in
[2:14:38] i invite you lord to come in
[2:14:40] if i've blocked you out if something's
[2:14:42] hindered you out of my life i'm raising
[2:14:44] my hands in front of all these people in
[2:14:46] front of everybody and saying let that
[2:14:48] humble gentle forgiving sweet caring
[2:14:51] kind compassionate spirit
[2:14:55] let it come in
[2:14:58] brother branham says then
[2:15:01] that will be a paradox in itself
[2:15:04] musicians could you come
[2:15:07] then that will be a paradox stand to
[2:15:10] your feet
[2:15:14] and that will be a paradox
[2:15:18] until that gentle humble caring
[2:15:20] forgiving spirit
[2:15:23] comes in
[2:15:26] just gonna wait a moment
[2:15:31] being changed that's what we're
[2:15:33] preaching on
[2:15:34] being changed remember what we said last
[2:15:37] time
[2:15:37] you're constantly evolving
[2:15:40] you should constantly be growing
[2:15:42] we should constantly be changing
[2:15:44] don't ever hold on to anything
[2:15:47] let it go say lord let me move past it
[2:15:52] move past it
[2:15:54] brother adam says that'll be a paradox
[2:15:57] to take the very nature of a boy
[2:16:01] that's bred
[2:16:02] between father and mother
[2:16:06] and yet in his intellectuals
[2:16:08] he's trying his
[2:16:10] best
[2:16:12] to overcome it amen you might be trying
[2:16:16] your best
[2:16:17] you might be trying you might have tried
[2:16:19] your best for 30 years
[2:16:22] he says he's trying his best to overcome
[2:16:25] it
[2:16:27] he can't do it
[2:16:29] he'll never overcome it christ will have
[2:16:32] to overcome it
[2:16:34] when he lets christ
[2:16:36] in
[2:16:38] then he's already overcome then
[2:16:41] i love how brother branham says this i
[2:16:43] wish i could highlight it in green and
[2:16:45] neon and flashing
[2:16:47] when a man
[2:16:49] it'll be a perfect paradox when a man
[2:16:52] is born
[2:16:54] a life
[2:16:56] a spirit of batting ground just like we
[2:16:58] talked about that cancer that it has a
[2:17:00] body
[2:17:01] the holy spirit needs a tabernacle it
[2:17:03] needs a temple to live in when a man is
[2:17:06] born
[2:17:07] of the spirit of god
[2:17:09] by your head's with me
[2:17:11] every head bowed every eye closed
[2:17:21] i wonder how many
[2:17:23] people
[2:17:25] we live with we even ourselves
[2:17:28] on how many
[2:17:30] spiritually not talking naturally here
[2:17:34] but if we would really to diagnose the
[2:17:36] case
[2:17:37] not just throw out a pill to give to
[2:17:39] everybody and you just need to conform
[2:17:41] and you just need to change
[2:17:42] you just you just need this and you're
[2:17:43] just not like us because of this i
[2:17:45] wonder if we were really to take the
[2:17:47] time
[2:17:48] and let a person face them themselves
[2:17:52] let me do it this morning lord i want to
[2:17:54] raise my hands up and say let me do it
[2:17:56] this morning
[2:17:58] let me fall under the knife
[2:18:02] let me fall under that surgeon's hand
[2:18:04] this morning god has your spirits moving
[2:18:06] in this place over every heart and every
[2:18:08] life
[2:18:10] don't let us resist it lord this morning
[2:18:13] lord they're not resisting me
[2:18:15] we resist this morning we're resisting
[2:18:17] you
[2:18:18] let us give over let us give up
[2:18:22] let me fall into that surgeon's hand
[2:18:24] this morning
[2:18:26] and let me not be just a person who just
[2:18:28] throws out a quick easy solution but if
[2:18:30] we were really to diagnose the case
[2:18:33] or really to look into the innermost
[2:18:35] part of our heart
[2:18:37] we don't have a prophet here to sit you
[2:18:38] down in a private interview and to
[2:18:40] diagnose you and tell you what happened
[2:18:42] when you were two and three and four and
[2:18:43] five but friends let me just tell you we
[2:18:45] don't need that this morning because the
[2:18:47] bible says that the word of god is a
[2:18:49] discerner of the thoughts and the
[2:18:51] intents of the heart and let me just say
[2:18:53] it to you in case so i can so i can
[2:18:55] silence the mouth of the devil your life
[2:18:59] every single life that's here has been
[2:19:01] diagnosed this morning
[2:19:03] while you've sat there in your chair the
[2:19:05] lord jesus has slowly diagnosed the case
[2:19:08] and now you're sitting there at your
[2:19:10] seat this morning
[2:19:11] satan's been exposed it's up to you
[2:19:14] to reach out and take it
[2:19:16] i wonder how many people if we were to
[2:19:17] really diagnose we'd speak we'd see
[2:19:19] spiritually
[2:19:21] spiritual
[2:19:22] handicaps spiritual wheelchair spiritual
[2:19:25] blindness
[2:19:26] spiritual nerves where the ear has been
[2:19:29] pinched
[2:19:30] and cut off and hearts that have been
[2:19:32] hardened can't even hear the word of god
[2:19:34] anymore
[2:19:36] but i want to send out a freedom call
[2:19:38] this morning
[2:19:39] i want to let you know this morning the
[2:19:41] light of the gospel has shined it's

[2:20:16] is right where we look at things
[2:20:18] correctly

[2:20:28] husband help me to be the leader that
[2:20:31] you need me to be god i give it all to
[2:20:33] you i raise up my hands this morning and
[2:20:35] say help me to change
[2:20:37] lord what i can't change come and change

[2:21:12] here right now and all you got to do is
[2:21:14] reach out and accept it in faith sister
[2:21:17] elena just reached out in faith
[2:21:19] she took a hold of a promise and god
[2:21:22] backed up what she did
[2:21:23] god can back it up this morning god can
[2:21:26] come and ah he honors his own word
[2:21:29] and satan has no authority he's just a
[2:21:31] bluff he's a liar he's a trespasser who
[2:21:35] may be hid under a cancer and but let me
[2:21:37] not call it let me speak to that spirit
[2:21:39] this morning
[2:21:40] let me confess it let me call it
[2:21:42] literally really what it is
[2:21:44] say satan you're on offense to me you're
[2:21:46] a liar satan you've been exposed you've
[2:21:50] been trying to suck the blood and the
[2:21:51] life out of me but i stand here today
[2:21:54] confessing my sins repenting of my sins
[2:21:57] and jesus is here to accept me
[2:22:01] to make me new again
