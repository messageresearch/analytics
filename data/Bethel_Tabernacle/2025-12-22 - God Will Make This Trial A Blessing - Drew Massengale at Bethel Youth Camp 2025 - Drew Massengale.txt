TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I've just came [singing and music] into the valley like I've never been before. I keep searching [music] for a way out. Seems like [singing] padlocks are on the door. [music] Oh, there must be another sunrise, another sunset [music] that I'll [singing] see. God will make this trial a blessing [music] and the whole wide world will see. [singing] God will make [music] this trial a blessing. Though he sends me to my knees, [singing] though [music] my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's [singing] no need to get discouraged. There's no [music] need to talk defeat. [singing] God will make my child a blessing. That's the love he has for me. [music] I am not the first man to come into [singing] this place. You [music] see, every child of God, these tests we must face. It is [singing] here that God [music] will mold you and make you what you want to be. God will make your child [music and singing] a blessing. And the whole world will see. God [music] will [singing] make his child a blessing. Know it sends me to my [music] knees. Though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. [music] There's no need to get discouraged. There's no need to talk [music] to me. God has made my trial a [singing] blessing. That's the love he [music] has for me. Now I'm standing [singing] on the mountain. Looking back, [music] I can see when I was in that lowest valley, father's [music] hand was leading me. Oh, it's good to see [music] the sunshine and to taste [singing] victory. God has made your childless and all [music] our world will see. God will [music and singing] make his triless though he [music and singing] me to my knees. Though my tears flow like a river yet [music] there sweet there's no need to get discouraged. I'm not going to talk defeat. [music] God has made this trial [singing] a blessing and [music] the whole wide world will see. There's no need to get discouraged. We're not going to talk [music and singing] defeat. God has made your child a blessing. [music] That's the love he has for me. &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Heat.
