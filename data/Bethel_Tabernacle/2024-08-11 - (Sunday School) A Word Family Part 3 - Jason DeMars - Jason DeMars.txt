[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] morning everyone God bless you let's stand and we'll go directly to the word going to read Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4 Paul writing there and he says and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord Heavenly Father we just want to commit this time to you Lord I pray that you take your word Lord Make It live in our hearts father this this world and the culture that we live in and culture that everyone lives in around around the world is not for the word but it's against the word and Lord it it's necessary that that you by your spirit come and raise up a standard against it Lord so that we don't drift off into the ways of the world but that we would instead conform ourselves to the word no matter how difficult it is and and how uh um strange it might be to those around us or even impossible uh uh fiscally impossible based upon the systems of the world but with you there's nothing that's impossible and with you Lord a heart of that says yes to the word and walks in it you will always meet every need and you will always deliver many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of them all we thank you for that we ask it in Jesus name amen I want to continue part three on a word family and as we look and study this um I believe I believe just uh as as we start um our culture and the world around us is pushing us in a direction and and uh if if we're not if we don't search everything that we do by the scriptures and by the message we end up falling in line with what the word says now everybody every every body's C circumstance and situation is different and the leadership of the Lord is different and we have to follow the leadership of the Lord but we always remember that the leadership of the Lord takes us into the word he doesn't lead us contrary to the word at all if it's contrary to the word we know it's not God's leading so when we look at this God has brought to us a full restoration back to the original Faith so we can't continue the way the cissified denominational programs work where they are doing everything they can to amalgamate themselves to a world that hates them anyways yeah and so we're not here to try to please the world we're not here to try to make the message more palatable to the world we're here to dig right into what the prophet said what because the prophet is pointing us back to the scriptures and so I always looked at this verse you see God's speaking to fathers fathers bring your children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord it it doesn't say hey mothers bring your children up in in the nurture and admonition of the Lord but many cultures say well the children are mother's domain the CH mother is responsible for the children father is going to go and provide for the family but I don't think that's what scripture is teaching us or showing us at all in fact the the onus and the responsibility is on fathers to bring up the children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord just as we talked about before when you look at the vi the the the vision that God gives a man has to have a vision God's vision for himself for his life and it's his duty to take Dominion amen now the Lord comes and by his grace provides a helper to the man to operate in that Vision so of course mother is involved but father has to have the vision and the direction and she helps in that vision and direction to bring the children up in the nurture and administ of the Lord but without the father's involvement there will be a real sickness in the children and in the family that they're going to require Supernatural healing for in the future in their life because father wasn't involved he just left it all to mother and again again it says children children so not just Boys the boys are for Dad and the girls are for Mom no the boys and the girls must be brought up in this way by their fathers in the nurture and admonition of the Lord so every father has to be a teacher say I'm I'm I don't have the gift of teaching I can't teach well get over it get over it because it's your duty to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and that's impossible without teaching and training and and again we we spoke about it before but I feel like it's important to mention it is the father who provides the identity of the child it provides brings calls them into the mission that they have right so just as in the birth father provides the chromosome to deter determine whether it's a boy or a girl when bringing a child to maturity to manhood or Womanhood the father has to call them to their Destiny as well um and and you know for for for young people and for people growing up it's it's critical that the father is directly involved in calling their son from being a boy to a man if you just go by what the culture says and just let it sort of happen if you look around the world every culture has some sort of ceremony where they call a a a a boy a son to be a man or a daughter to be a woman in America in the western culture we've lost all of that and now we have men men that grow up they have the title of man but they don't they've never been told by their father that they're man so they're in their minds they're sitting there wondering who am I and the and the women are doing the same thing their father never said I love you you're beautiful you're a woman God has ordained you to be uh a mother a wife not in that order a housekeeper um he's he's called you to that and they're wondering what am I and that's you see the I identity crisis they think think they're maybe a cat or a lion or a dog or girls think they're boys boys think they're girls it's it's a crisis not of motherhood it's a crisis of fatherhood the father never knew who he was was never told who he was was never even okay so you were never told by your father failed okay so now you get to be an unhealthy individual the rest of your life no the Lord Jesus comes to bring healing he comes to enter right into your pain right into your suffering and say you're you're my son I'm calling you to manhood you're my daughter I'm calling you to Womanhood even if your father failed but how about we just bypass that and not be fathers that fail to call our sons to manhood and our daughters to Womanhood you know when your your daughter looks in the mirror and sees herself she doesn't actually see the reflection that is actually there you know what she sees she sees the reflection that the father puts in front of her that's what she sees and so if the father fails to put the right reflection there she's going to look and say I'm ugly I'm horrible I'm this I'm that and so and again it's never too late maybe you failed your whole life you can still go back back to your children and say I love you I'm with you I'm for you you're beautiful God has a purpose for you every child is longing for their parents to speak these words of life and blessing over them and so it starts with Dad it absolutely starts with Dad mother can do it mother can support and help but unless dad speaks the words over his children speaks the blessing you know Jacob wasn't coming to his mother for the blessing it had to be the father that gave him G gave the identity forward there all right I didn't have that planned but we thank the Lord so man the husband is the head of the home so sometimes we get a perverted idea and think that men in general are the leaders of women that's not what the scripture ever says just the husband is the head of the wife you as a as a as a as a lady as a female you're either under the headship of your father or you're under the headship of your husband the scripture of course says if if person's a widow or unmarried away they have their own household so and and the next scripture that we're going to read speaks about that but outside of those situations you're either under the headship of your dad or you're under the headship of your husband and the headship it's not just an ethereal thing in the Scripture it it designates specifically what that means what does it mean well let's read the scripture numbers 30 if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her Youth and her father hear her vow and her bond where with she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand but if her father disallow her in that day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her bonds where with sheath bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her and if she had it all and husband when she vowed or uttered ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul and her husband heard it and and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which he vowed and that which uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the Lord shall forgive her and I want to just speak that feminism's first line of attack was this scripture they wanted to do away with this this understanding is that the husband or the father is the deciding factor in the home he is the decision maker so headship without this becomes just an ethereal philosophy but when you understand that this is to be this is the husband is the final say in the home he's the final word our our our legal system doesn't follow the word but if you're Christians right we follow the word amen no amens okay so I'll say Amen to myself because I believe it and it's important that we understand the the correct I'm looking at my phone because I'm going to pull up a quote and as we as we look at these types of things again the world has their own system and program and we can get under the spirit of the world so that when we hear the word preached we become offended by the word isn't that sad that a Christian would become offended by the word because they've been so deceived by the culture it's it's it's so sad in the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel he said now they got so that I was preaching the other night somewhere about women to obey their husbands obey yeah that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago but they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they'll let you know so they're not going to obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian because you're not I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God Amen that's the scripture and and we'll read it we'll read it later um if we get to it today probably not today but as we look as we look at this is this is what God's requirement this is a responsibility that's put upon the husband now again has it been abused has it been misused that's the Fallen world that we live in we're T talking about the abuse and misuse of it we can deal with that separately what we're talking about is this is what the word says the decision making person in the home is ultimately the father and I'll tell I'll say what I said before when a father abdicates his position when a husband abdicates his position even even if his wife is a feminist she will automatically begin to resent him she will not be upset she will make his life miserable because she will then take the authority and she'll resent him all the time for for not doing that not really being a man verse n but every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith they have bonded their souls shall stand against her and if she vowed in her husband's house or bound her soul by a bound with an oath and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and do allow her not then all her vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand even a dead husband that disallowed her gets to disallow her if she's a widow every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband May establish it or her husband may make it void but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from from day to day then he establishes all her vows see abdicate abdicating his deciding factor so if he abdicates it her vows are are are bound and she's Bound by them in other words if he says nothing God confirms the oath see that's what he says he conf of all her bounds which are upon her he confirms them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them so even even so God designs that if the man keeps his mouth shut he's still the deciding factor in God's sight but if he shall any ways make them void after that he had heard them then he shall bear her iniquity amen these are the statutes which the Lord commanded which the Lord commanded Moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father's house all right so so again as we're looking at this God establishes an order in the home and in the family amen and if we're not ordering our you can be you can say I was ignorant of this that's fine you're not now and so we want to be found walking in obedience to the word no matter how much it skins us skins us down now next we understand from this that the father then is a guardian we spoke of that before uh in our first I think first or I don't know which one before we talked about it that when God put the garden together he told the man he was to dress it and to keep it and to keep it meant that he was to be to guard and so God made man to be a stronger vessel than a woman so that he could guard and keep the woman and his children and so when we realize that then it's the duty of the father to instruct his daughters in the word this is what the word says many times we have problems and we have homes out of order and we have families ruined and broken is because they've failed to show they're just letting feminism and the entertainment systems of the world raise their children and instead of showing your daughters hey your husband's the deciding factor your husband will be your head I am until the moment that I give you over to your husband you say man this guy takes a lot of authority and a lot the word says I'm supposed to do it you might not like it you might think I'm a jerk I literally don't care what you think because I'm not responsible to you you can jump in the lake if you want to because I am I'm literally going to do what the word says for my as for me in my house we will serve the Lord if the culture wants to throw me in the jail or kill me let him do it it's fine but I'm not going without a fight am so I you know God has ordained me to be the guardian and the protector of my family and he's ordained me to be the deciding factor for my family and I'm not going to have made many mistakes I will make more mistakes but I'm not going to uh uh leave my children and my wife to the world and to the devil and so re regardless of the of the costs I'm going to teach my daughters what the word says and I'm going to live as the word says that's why every boy should be on notice that if they want to talk to their my daughters they should talk to me first and if they go around me I will not I don't bear The Sword in vain amen we we have to take that authority of course you understand that the boy might end up being your son-in-law so you want to work with love and wisdom because you want a good relationship you know we we tease about sitting and cleaning your gun and so forth but I don't want to shoot any boys but if I have to I guess I will um and and that's the authority and that's the love that a father must have for their daughters to to know that hey dad's got my back dad's watching over me he's he's he's my guardian and uh we should teach men we should teach our daughters the three sacred trusts that brother Branham showed us in the invisible Union they should know this they should know what it is and know this is what God has entrusted them with and they're in God's sight they're holy God's sight they're sacred and he's given these specific things to women to keep now we'll go back and we'll get those look at the quotes So notice now we find that her body is the beding grounds and therefore it's a sacred trusts not to defile that so it's the father's duty to work together with the mother to teach them about their body to teach them about the function of their body and to teach them what it's for in God's sight and that shouldn't beut be a mystery to them the day they get getting engaged or married or it shouldn't be training for them from their friends or from searching Google and looking at filthy stuff it's the parents duty to help your children to understand these sacred trusts your body is a betting ground it's the place to bring forth life and it's sacred it's to be kept holy and pure and undefiled and then when you get married even then the Bible says the marriage bed is undefiled even even after that changes at the marriage bed go in God's sight you have kept yourself undefiled and you not been defiled you're using your body for the purpose that God wants you to use it for that he designed you for and so so don't defile that before the hour that it's in God's season by her Lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman right that's committed to her by God she must not defile that virtue amen it think it sounds like we're saying the same thing but as we look at it you'll see that he's he's developing on that the third one now we find out that she has been given the sa trust that she must not break it of Womanhood act have her character raise her children be honorable to her husband so what are the three sacred trusts what are what what are they one your body it's the betting ground keep it pure and undefiled two virtue virtue means what strength right Jesus said virtue has gone out of me so it's its strength its power has gone gone out so what is a woman's strength and power it's your ability to say yes or no your ability to say to that boy no no this is for God's timing and God's purpose amen three he says Womanhood it's the character and conduct to your children and husband so again your body your virtue and your character of Womanhood and so these are the things that fathers have to establish in their home with their daughters it's it's again it isn't mom's ultimate responsibility it's Dad's responsibility to be sure that the understanding is there and Mom is there as the helper of the father's vision and again it's not men it's not up to us men to determine what our own vision is number one is we have a pre-existing Vision given to Adam at the very beginning number two is then we have a specific calling each one of us has for what we are to do in our life but nevertheless I can tell you all with confidence other than a very very small few that God has ordained to be uh Unix for the kingdom of God that's a that's a minimal amount of people for most people they're going to be called and ordained to take dominion and to multiply and fill up the Earth it's pretty full now but God has not sent Christ back to end the vision and SEC and the other part of it is as well is that many times we look at this and we we have a Rapture mentality you think well that's a good thing isn't it well yes and no because the prophet dealt with people that were that were that were thinking when the seals are done being preached the Rapture will take place they're selling everything and moving and becoming Fanatics and he wants to emphasize when he's preaching the seals live a good clean Godly Christian Life right so what did he tell us if I knew if I was planting potatoes and I knew the Rapture was going to take place to tomorrow I would plant potatoes today so keep planting potatoes yeah keep taking dominion and multiplying this is what God wants us to do where does that Dominion start right in our family that's the that's the that that is the that's the primary calling of every man you say no so some people are called to preach that's their primary calling no because if he can't lead his family he cannot preach that's part of the qualif if ation of being able to stand behind the pulpit and preach the word and so without leading your family properly you become disqualified so it shows us a man's first responsibility is his own family if his family is falling and dying spiritually he should get himself out of the pulpit and figure out a way to be with his family and make sure that they're taken care of they're provided for and that they're nurtured and raised up in the admiss admonition of the Lord too many ministers and quote unquote missionaries are going out ruining their families and say well I can't I can't be disobedient to my calling you already were you already were you you you you destroyed your your your second calling by not following through with your first calling and I know we all we all make mistakes I do too and it's only by the grace of God that any of us but we we should remember fathers and mothers that you know the statement of I believe it's Charles Spurgeon says that if a sinner is going to go to hell then let it be that they have to crawl over my dead and lifeless body to get there so we say that for somebody 7,000 miles away in Africa but what about our own children they should have to leap over our dead bodies into into the pit of Hell before they can get there because we've put all our efforts and we've said you know what Satan you can't have them I don't care what you do what you do to me how much you light me on fire I am going after my kids and I am not it's not going to be for a lack of effort am on my part you say well it's just predestinated seat of God yes it is and yet how many kids have been destroyed because their parents have abdicated their position as in spiritual teach teaching and Leadership why should our children have to suffer because we're fools and we think our primary responsibility is to go to church and to just preach and do Mission strips it's not our primary responsibility it's not our first calling it's not our first position it's not it's your home it's your children fathers provoke not your children to wrath but raise them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord and and again God has made a man the deciding factor in his home he's not to you say oh man this this is sure anti-feminism yes it is I will fight that evil spirit till the day that I die because it's ruining churches it's ruining families it's ruining lives and that Spirit has creeped into the minds of message Believers why should I go to a church and preach this and feel so much angst coming against me and it's not just in the atmosphere it's people's faces that are upset and frustrated about it why because the spirit of feminism has con gone in into your spirit and you need to be we need to be delivered from this thing we're raising our children just like the world says not for what the word says we're making the word secondary and and and what the world says primary we're putting our daughters into a direction that the Lord hasn't put putting our wives into places the Lord hasn't put them because why because you by faith men a woman out of order shows a man out of order it's it can't be in any other way because he's too cissified to stand up to his wife and say this is how it's going to be not with a fist with love but determination and say as for me in my house we will serve the Lord honey you're serving the lord oh no but I want to do this you're not when a when whenever brother branam blames women for cutting their hair wearing makeup being immodest he goes to the man and says shame on you men for being such a that you can't control what your wife is doing this is the condition that we've found ourselves in around the message we've become allow feminism to sissify the men and allowed the women to take over but a man has to abdicate that because he's the stronger vessel he's less he's less able to be deceived see that's scripture the world might not like it you might not like it but I don't care it's exactly what the word says let's forget about the worldly system and worldly order that says we must raise our family like
