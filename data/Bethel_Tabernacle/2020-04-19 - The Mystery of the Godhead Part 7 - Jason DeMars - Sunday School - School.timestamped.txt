[4:49] good morning everyone god bless you so
[4:53] thankful to be here with you can't wait
[4:55] for the soon approaching hour that we'll
[4:58] all be together again and thankful to
[5:02] see things or the governor's starting to
[5:04] open things up in South Carolina and so
[5:07] we're it slowly in that process I love
[5:09] you all and can't wait to see you
[5:11] gathered together here again and with
[5:14] that said let's stand and pray a few of
[5:16] us that are gathered here father we just
[5:19] look to you Lord it's your spirit that's
[5:22] the teacher you promised us to guide us
[5:25] into all truth Lord and I just want to
[5:27] step myself out of the way Lord and let
[5:29] your spirit come and guide us Lord teach
[5:33] us may the spirit of Revelation work in
[5:38] every heart that's tuned in here Lord I
[5:40] pray for the families and those at home
[5:45] with young children and knowing how
[5:48] difficult many times it is to be able to
[5:51] focus with kids in their normal
[5:54] environment of play and running around
[5:57] to get snacks and so forth Lord help
[5:59] just I pray you'd calm everyone's spirit
[6:01] Lord calm the children's spirit help
[6:04] everyone to just sit and relax and enjoy
[6:08] your presence and receive something from
[6:11] your word Lord we commit ourselves to
[6:13] you and Jesus precious name Amen so
[6:18] we're onto part 7 of the mystery of the
[6:21] Godhead this time we'll be looking
[6:23] mostly at the birth baptism and
[6:25] crucifixion of Christ
[6:27] last time we we got a little bit into
[6:30] the birth or maybe a lot bit into the
[6:32] birth and I just wanted to kind of
[6:35] reiterate some of that maybe look at it
[6:38] from another angle and then move on to
[6:40] the baptism and crucifixion and then
[6:43] then if we get far enough we will talk
[6:46] about the fruits of Nicaea so let's go
[6:53] forward if we can
[6:57] if technology allows us when we turn it
[7:01] off and on all right so three
[7:07] significant events in Jesus life birth
[7:10] baptism and crucifixion Luke 1:35 and
[7:15] the angel answered and said unto her the
[7:17] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[7:20] power of the highest shall overshadow
[7:21] thee now watch this next word therefore
[7:25] also that holy thing which shall be born
[7:28] of thee shall be called the Son of God
[7:30] so why is Jesus the Son of God because
[7:33] he was a second koete erna person with
[7:36] the father no it says the Holy Ghost
[7:39] will overshadow you therefore which
[7:42] means because of this or based upon this
[7:45] action he's called the Son of God so why
[7:49] is Jesus the Son of God supernatural
[7:51] birth it's so simple so scriptural not
[7:57] not based on some eternal Godhead of
[8:01] three persons but the simple fact God
[8:04] who is a spirit overshadowed the Virgin
[8:10] created that that cell within her
[8:14] because of that he's the son of God why
[8:16] God is his father God is his progenitor
[8:21] so that leads us to look at some other
[8:24] things which is if he's the son of God
[8:28] I'm the son of Jim DeMars
[8:31] that means I carry and Susan DeMars I
[8:34] carry within myself their DNA so I have
[8:39] the life of Jim and Susan DeMars you
[8:45] know if if Jesus had the life of Mary
[8:49] then we have a problem because Mary was
[8:51] a sinner she would have passed her
[8:53] genetics onto them then we have to
[8:56] create as the Roman Catholics did a
[8:58] doctrine of Immaculate Conception which
[9:01] is that Mary was born without the stain
[9:04] of original sin therefore she could pass
[9:07] on her genetics to Jesus
[9:10] but this is a this is fanciful nonsense
[9:14] what we're talking about is the
[9:16] scripture as we read last time that we
[9:19] are saved by the blood of God that's in
[9:22] Acts chapter 20 so God doesn't have any
[9:25] blood he's a spirit he's invisible you
[9:28] can't even see him so what did he do he
[9:30] had an offspring he brought from his
[9:32] very own life and made the the whole DNA
[9:36] genetic structure the nature body soul
[9:40] and spirit made the man Christ Jesus so
[9:43] now this man is the exact imprint of the
[9:48] invisible God so God has now taken on a
[9:53] shape of form yes he's the son of God
[9:56] yes he's a man but God himself now has
[10:00] put a part of his life into human flesh
[10:05] to live a perfect life for us then we go
[10:10] to the baptism of Jesus Matthew 3:16 and
[10:13] 17 we've addressed this before that the
[10:16] Trinitarians use these verses to say
[10:18] spirit of god is descending son of god
[10:21] is in the water God the Father speaking
[10:23] from heaven see it's three persons it
[10:25] doesn't say anything about that and
[10:27] don't don't Trinitarians themselves
[10:30] believe it that God is omnipresent
[10:33] he can be in many many places at the
[10:35] same time so the Spirit of God can
[10:38] descend from heaven God can still be in
[10:40] heaven and the body of God the Son of
[10:44] God can be there on earth at the same
[10:47] time it's not a difficult concept to
[10:50] understand so when Jesus was baptized
[10:53] immediately he went up from the water
[10:54] and behold the heavens were opened to
[10:56] him and he saw the Spirit of God
[10:58] descending like a dove and coming to
[11:00] rest on him and behold a voice from
[11:02] heaven said this is my beloved son with
[11:05] whom I am well pleased so so I'm gonna
[11:11] back up a second so think about this
[11:13] Jesus being the image of the invisible
[11:16] God so understand that God is outside of
[11:21] this dimension he's not limited by this
[11:24] too
[11:24] mention similar to how we you let you
[11:28] and I dwell in another dimension like
[11:30] called the Internet you and I for
[11:34] example the dimension of Facebook we
[11:37] have a profile on Facebook that profile
[11:41] is an expression of us that profile in
[11:44] facebook is us okay but we are not
[11:49] limited by that dimension we're also
[11:51] outside of that dimension we exist apart
[11:54] from that and yet we're in that
[11:56] dimension through our profile and that
[11:59] is the same way with God God's a spirit
[12:02] he's not limited by this he's completely
[12:03] out of this dimension he's not he's not
[12:07] limited by time space and matter
[12:10] whatsoever but God wanted to come into
[12:15] this dimension so he gave birth
[12:19] he brought his begotten Son forth from
[12:23] there now God is still apart from that
[12:26] you know you see the different instances
[12:28] in Jesus life he says lifts his eyes to
[12:31] heaven father the hour has come
[12:33] well the fullness was in him all he
[12:35] needed to do is look in the mirror well
[12:37] God is not merely limited this dimension
[12:41] Jesus was God made visible here in this
[12:46] dimension yet God is apart from that and
[12:49] outside of that amen okay so the baptism
[12:53] of Jesus now we have this these are some
[12:57] statements from brother Branham when
[13:00] he's discussing the baptism of Jesus
[13:02] what is it significance what happened
[13:04] there he showed that that where it says
[13:08] in whom I'm pleased well pleased he says
[13:11] in whom I'm pleased to dwell in he says
[13:18] God did not dwell in him until that time
[13:24] he says he became God he says he was
[13:31] anointed with God he said
[13:35] he became Emanuel he became the Messiah
[13:40] he was anointed with the Spirit of God
[13:42] at that time the fullness came down to
[13:45] dwell in him Jesus was always the exact
[13:48] imprint of God when you saw the baby you
[13:51] were seeing God when you saw the
[13:52] teenager you were seeing God but God had
[13:56] to come down and dwell in him and anoint
[13:59] him to activate him for his ministry
[14:03] then we go to the crucifixion of Christ
[14:06] in the Garden of Gethsemane brother
[14:08] Branham tells us the anointing left him
[14:10] in the garden we have Jesus on the cross
[14:14] saying my God my God why hast thou
[14:16] forsaken me
[14:18] so God forsook Jesus he left him in the
[14:22] garden and yet it was the blood of God
[14:25] that was there see it's it's a number
[14:28] one it's a revelation number two is you
[14:33] have to you have to let go of your
[14:35] preconceived ideas based on theology and
[14:39] just think like the scripture thinks all
[14:47] right so we have just to summarize those
[14:52] things the blood of God was born the DNA
[14:55] and exact imprint of God God came to
[14:58] dwell in Jesus in fullness at his
[15:01] baptism and the anointing left him in
[15:03] the garden those are the three steps to
[15:06] really give us a big picture of the
[15:10] Godhead and how in the relationship of
[15:13] Jesus Christ to the Godhead brother
[15:16] Branham says the man the body was not
[15:19] deity but deity was in the body now let
[15:23] me back up here people say oh my
[15:24] goodness what are you saying do you
[15:26] realize that Jesus only in Trinitarians
[15:29] don't believe that the body of Jesus
[15:31] Christ was God himself
[15:34] he was a man it was not God to the body
[15:36] but God was dwelling in the body and
[15:40] fully identified in that body and
[15:42] brother Branham MacLeod again and again
[15:45] makes that clear they say they were
[15:49] said we were for a good work we don't
[15:51] stone you because you're a man making
[15:53] yourself God he was God but brother
[15:56] Branham says the problem was it they was
[15:57] looking at that body that was born of
[16:00] Mary he says that wasn't God that was
[16:03] the son of God see it was God dwelling
[16:07] in that body God fully identified to
[16:09] that body so that when we look at that
[16:11] man we say that's the father that's God
[16:15] that's God tabernacling in a body of
[16:18] flesh that's God become a man a man we
[16:23] have to have we have to have the balance
[16:24] we don't want to throw out these
[16:27] statements of brother Branham and we
[16:28] don't want to throw out these statements
[16:30] of brother Branham we want to say yes
[16:32] and amen
[16:33] and keep it in a scriptural balance
[16:36] because you know the person that says
[16:40] emphasizes on the one side he says Jesus
[16:42] is not God
[16:43] all right the other one says Jesus is
[16:47] God he's the only true God okay so what
[16:51] about the other things that have been
[16:52] said what about the thousands of times
[16:56] that brother Branham said Jesus Christ
[16:58] was God is God okay what about the times
[17:03] that he did say he wasn't okay we don't
[17:06] want to ignore either those well what do
[17:09] we have to be afraid of what do we have
[17:10] to be ashamed of I don't have to fix
[17:14] what brother Branham said I'm not I'm
[17:16] not one of these preachers to come up
[17:18] and say well I'm gonna correct brother
[17:20] Branham know there's many there's many
[17:24] who have done it that that spirit has
[17:27] infected the message and all around the
[17:29] world there's people impacted by that
[17:31] nonsense I don't have to correct brother
[17:34] Branham God vindicated him and if
[17:37] there's a problem it's in my
[17:40] understanding of it and so that you know
[17:43] that's I I want to see the balance of it
[17:46] in the scriptures and if we don't if we
[17:49] ignore some quotes and accept only these
[17:51] quotes we have a problem brother Branham
[17:55] doesn't have a problem we have a problem
[17:58] so let's look at a few quotes as we kind
[18:01] of
[18:02] change directions here and kind of close
[18:05] up the portion talking about why the
[18:08] Trinity is false so here's the new
[18:11] international encyclopedia the Trinity
[18:13] doctrine the Catholic faith is this we
[18:16] worship one in Trinity but there is one
[18:19] person of the Father another of the son
[18:21] and another of the Holy Ghost the glory
[18:22] equal the Majesty Co eternal the
[18:25] doctrine is not found in its fully
[18:27] developed form in the scriptures modern
[18:30] theology does not seek to find it in the
[18:32] Old Testament at the time of the
[18:34] Reformation the Protestant church took
[18:36] over the doctrine of the Trinity without
[18:38] serious examination that is the new
[18:42] international encyclopedia speaking the
[18:45] truth
[18:48] Life magazine says this the Catholics
[18:52] made this statement concerning their
[18:54] doctrine of the Trinity to defend the
[18:56] dogma of the Assumption of Mary in
[18:58] article by Graham Greene
[19:00] our opponents sometimes claim that no
[19:02] belief should be held dogmatically which
[19:04] is not explicitly stated in the
[19:06] scripture but the protestant churches
[19:08] have themselves accepted such dogma as
[19:11] the trinity for which there exists no
[19:13] such authority in the gospels wow that's
[19:19] a mouthful this is the international
[19:24] encyclopedia 1st edition the doctrine of
[19:27] the trinity did not form part of the
[19:29] Apostles preachings as this is reported
[19:33] in the New Testament well from the
[19:40] Oxford Companion to the Bible because
[19:42] the trinity is such an important part of
[19:44] later Christian doctrine it is striking
[19:46] that the term does not appear in the New
[19:48] Testament likewise the developed concept
[19:51] of three co-equal partners in the
[19:53] Godhead found in later creedal formed
[19:55] formulations cannot be clearly detected
[19:59] within the confines of the Canon Wow
[20:03] these things should be staggering to
[20:06] anyone that's listening in that believes
[20:08] in a trinity of three persons it's not
[20:14] found in the Bible this is open
[20:16] it's not part of the apostles preachings
[20:19] that's openly admitted it was it was
[20:23] developed later also openly admitted
[20:27] these are shocking statements and ones
[20:30] that literally cannot be proven as false
[20:35] you can't go here and say oh look you
[20:37] know actually this is right in the Bible
[20:40] you can only you can only take this
[20:44] understanding and try to force it upon
[20:46] the Bible but there's so much that
[20:50] contradicts it that that the Trinity of
[20:54] three persons is absolutely proven to be
[20:59] a false doctrine proven to be a Catholic
[21:02] tradition that was accepted and carried
[21:06] on by the Protestants and so you know
[21:09] we're in good company to question this
[21:13] doctrine and say we have to return to
[21:15] the scriptures
[21:17] we have to turn away from false doctrine
[21:22] that was developed later our final
[21:24] authority is this book you've heard me
[21:27] emphasize this this Bible study again
[21:30] and again and again but this is an
[21:33] important point it's not the church is
[21:35] not defined our church is not the final
[21:37] authority I'm not the final authority
[21:39] even a prophet that comes after the
[21:42] Bible is written is not the final
[21:44] authority the Bible is the final
[21:46] authority and of course God vindicates
[21:50] vindicated brother Branham proved his
[21:53] message and yet that prophet told us
[21:56] make sure you're understanding it make
[21:57] sure you're hearing correctly make sure
[22:00] you're understand under standing and
[22:02] according to the scriptures he says all
[22:05] doctrine must be based on the Bible he
[22:09] didn't say all doctrine must be based on
[22:11] my quotes he said all doctrine must be
[22:14] based on the Bible his sermons and his
[22:18] messages were to point us back to the
[22:20] Bible now he wasn't pointing us back to
[22:22] the Bible so that we could take some
[22:24] things he said throw him away and other
[22:27] things that he said and accept them
[22:28] because we like we
[22:30] like this one quote we got 17 pages of
[22:33] quotes over here about this subject but
[22:35] we got one quote over here but that
[22:37] seems to be contradicting though it
[22:39] isn't but we'll accept this one and
[22:41] dismiss the rest or as I've seen people
[22:45] say as you're introducing them to the
[22:46] message we love the message but please
[22:49] don't teach us about modesty we don't
[22:51] like that part of it
[22:52] maybe brother Branham wasn't mistaken
[22:55] about that well I usually say well he
[22:59] preached the same thing from the very
[23:01] beginning until the very end and I
[23:04] believe the Lord would have corrected
[23:05] him about that there's other things the
[23:07] Lord corrected him about and any
[23:09] corrected himself on that but that is
[23:11] one point where from the beginning to
[23:14] the end it didn't even change one iota
[23:16] and so you know there's these things
[23:19] that people do that they they completely
[23:22] dismiss what brother Branham taught and
[23:26] we can't do that we can't do that and
[23:28] that's not what I'm saying when I say
[23:29] the Bible is the absolute some people
[23:33] hear you saying the Bible is the
[23:34] absolute and they say oh he's dismissing
[23:36] the Prophet no that's not right you know
[23:40] the word of the Lord comes to the
[23:42] Prophet God does nothing unless he
[23:44] reveals his secrets to the servants the
[23:45] prophets but if we try to take brother
[23:48] Branham and piece it together with our
[23:51] own understanding we're gonna come to
[23:52] some fantastic error but if we take
[23:55] brother Branham and say oh that's in the
[23:58] scripture let me search search it out in
[24:01] the word from Genesis to Revelation then
[24:05] the Spirit of God can take that and give
[24:08] you an understanding of what the Prophet
[24:09] said if we want to piece it together
[24:13] we'll have some nonsense and we'll bring
[24:18] destruction to ourselves and to those
[24:20] around us we need the Spirit of God you
[24:23] know it isn't a matter well we have the
[24:25] Prophet we don't need the Spirit of God
[24:27] the the tapes are the token well you and
[24:33] your flesh will take this message into
[24:35] idolatry you will turn you'll turn the
[24:38] prophet into an idol like now because
[24:41] Nebuchadnezzar did
[24:43] and you'll be embracing all kinds of
[24:45] false doctrines we need the Holy Spirit
[24:48] to guide us into all truth it didn't say
[24:51] I will send you the Prophet to guide you
[24:52] into all truth he said I'll send you the
[24:56] Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth to guide
[24:58] you into all truth and then he says I'll
[25:00] send you prophets and teachers and so
[25:04] forth but we have to have that guide
[25:06] within us to lead us and guide us to
[25:11] what is true I'll give an example I got
[25:15] saved and I got the Holy Spirit I was
[25:18] still in a denominational Church but
[25:21] guess what the whole time God was
[25:24] leading and speaking to me and teaching
[25:26] me about so many different things that
[25:28] and then when the message when someone
[25:32] introduced the message to me it was just
[25:34] like okay he'd already been leading the
[25:36] Lord had already been teaching me these
[25:37] things now I hear the message like oh
[25:39] it's confirmed and now there's so much
[25:42] more that had no idea about that's
[25:45] coming the spirit leads us into all
[25:47] truth and it keeps us in the scripture
[25:51] that that's the problem too many times
[25:55] today as we don't return back to the
[25:58] Bible we don't love our Bibles we love
[26:02] the Prophet we love the message that's
[26:04] wonderful but we got to take it back to
[26:06] the scripture I don't know where we're
[26:09] at here we got time still so we'll
[26:12] continue on all right this is from the
[26:17] Encyclopedia Britannica on dogma and
[26:20] dogmatic theology the adoption of a non
[26:23] biblical phrase at Nicaea constituted a
[26:25] landmark in the growth of dogma the
[26:27] Trinity is true since the church the
[26:30] universal Church speaking by its bishops
[26:32] says so though the Bible does not we
[26:35] have a formula but what does that
[26:37] formula contain no child of the church
[26:39] seek to answer wow it's true because the
[26:45] universal church speaking by the bishops
[26:47] that's that's the Catholic doctrine
[26:50] that's what they believe is their final
[26:52] authority and their absolute the
[26:55] universal church speaking by it
[26:57] chips is above the Bible that's a
[26:59] mistake all right if I can quickly get
[27:11] through this the fruits of Nicaea of the
[27:15] Athanasian version of Christianity that
[27:18] we talked about the Athanasian Creed
[27:20] so Christianity had spread throughout
[27:22] the Roman Empire and beyond into Britain
[27:25] Norway Germany Russia Sudan Somalia all
[27:29] of North Africa into turkey into all of
[27:32] Turkey most of Iran Iraq Arabia
[27:36] Afghanistan and India so I mean it
[27:40] really had spread subsequent to the
[27:46] church declaring the Nicene
[27:49] Constantinople and Ephesian Creed's it
[27:52] began to settle down into formal
[27:54] religious acts that's that's documented
[27:58] history it started descending from the
[28:02] leadership of the Spirit into this is
[28:06] our form of worship this is how we do it
[28:08] now we have catechism you have to take a
[28:10] catechism class for two years before you
[28:12] can be baptized you you know all these
[28:16] different things that they'd set up that
[28:18] you can't find anywhere in Scripture now
[28:22] and the church grew to such a place that
[28:24] it was such a big organism that it
[28:29] became connected politically both in
[28:33] Rome and in Constantinople it was still
[28:36] being persecuted in other in other areas
[28:38] that we talked about but especially in
[28:40] what is modern-day Turkey in the the
[28:43] Middle East North Africa and Europe
[28:47] where it had spread - it was connected
[28:51] politically it began to spiritually die
[28:57] it started relying on its form and its
[29:03] connection to politics it formed layers
[29:07] of hierarchy it continued to formally
[29:10] formulate its own doctrines loosely
[29:12] based on Scripture
[29:14] but mostly based on the authority of the
[29:16] church fathers of history it descended
[29:22] to the point where people even
[29:24] theologians had never even seen a Bible
[29:28] in who imagined theologians trained in
[29:32] the in the by the Catholic in Eastern
[29:34] Orthodox churches didn't even have a
[29:36] Bible in their possession roughly 300
[29:40] years later after Nicaea Muhammad began
[29:43] his Crusades and doctrines that directly
[29:46] opposed the Christian faith or we would
[29:49] say they for sure the Catholic faith but
[29:51] the Christian faith is in general as
[29:53] well as a result the territories where
[29:56] there were Christians diminished and
[29:58] receded mostly to the Byzantine Empire
[30:01] and Mediterranean Europe with a few
[30:04] spots here and there in northern and
[30:05] western Europe the fruits of Nicaea
[30:10] based upon history were spiritual death
[30:13] God cursed the world with Islam and as a
[30:19] result of that with the Dark Ages the
[30:27] world did not change at all it stayed
[30:30] the same in almost every way until the
[30:35] Bible began to be restored to its
[30:37] rightful place as the final authority of
[30:39] the church once that happened the world
[30:43] began to progress again and within a
[30:47] short period of time missionary started
[30:49] going out to all these lands that were
[30:52] teaching not Catholicism but a return
[30:56] back to the Bible and the different
[30:58] messages that the Lord began to restore
[31:00] through the Reformers throughout the
[31:02] ages so these these things are I guess
[31:08] simple to a message believer brother
[31:10] Branham sometimes summarizes them in
[31:13] just a few sentences but it's kind of
[31:15] wonderful to see at least for me to see
[31:17] kind of looking at the history in the
[31:19] big picture to see how you know exactly
[31:23] these things happen I mean it's not
[31:24] just a crazy statement that the church
[31:26] went the wrong way at Nicaea and went
[31:29] you know went swung over to Rome and
[31:31] went into false doctrine for sure there
[31:33] was a process leading up to that and
[31:35] then there was a process after that but
[31:38] it was a turning point for the church
[31:41] because deciding things through a
[31:43] Council of bishops became the norm and
[31:47] it by no means is a scriptural means of
[31:51] how God decides what his word means so
[31:54] we thank the Lord for a restored truth
[31:57] in this day and then so so glad that God
[32:01] sent this message to us and it brings
[32:03] that balanced scriptural truth it's not
[32:07] it's not a Trinity of three persons it's
[32:10] not a oneness Jesus only its bet its
[32:13] balance in the middle right in the
[32:16] scriptures amen let's stand and pray
[32:20] gracious father we love you
[32:22] we're thankful for this truth Lord we
[32:25] want to take everything the Prophet
[32:28] spoke Lord and we want to take every
[32:30] everything in the scriptures and not be
[32:33] ashamed and not feel like we have to run
[32:35] from everything Lord but just to be
[32:37] rejoicing and in a balanced word Lord we
[32:42] know we know and we've seen you
[32:46] manifested and displayed the Lord you've
[32:51] been unveiled before us made known
[32:53] before us in this our Lord not that we
[32:56] can know some doctrine and become good
[32:59] at arguing a point Lord but that we
[33:01] would know you because knowing you is
[33:03] life may we continue to grow into that
[33:08] word Lord may that life be expressed
[33:11] more and more may we surrender more and
[33:15] more to the life of Jesus Christ help us
[33:18] lord help us to be help help our eyes to
[33:22] be single lord help us help our hearts
[33:26] to be pure Lord cleanse us and cleanness
[33:29] Lord we commit ourselves to you we ask
[33:32] your blessing upon the worship and the
[33:34] preaching of the word today in the name
[33:37] of Jesus Christ
[33:38] amen amen god bless you
