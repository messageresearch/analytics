i'm so thankful for his grace and mercy we encountered a great honor and a great privilege to be here this night what a victory night that he has allowed us to triumphant that we might be partakers tonight of his suffering oh my what a privilege that he is in order to just stir your souls that he has kept us in the time of trouble he has not left us for he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you even in you to the end what a promise he's the true promise keeper he has never left us he's always been with us always caring for us i'm so thankful that he's still governing the affairs of man oh we're so thankful for that we appreciate the lord we appreciate his grace and mercy and we sure appreciate each and every one of you we appreciate your welcome spirit you make me feel so welcome i don't know what caused that but i'm so thankful for that i you know you know the it's the same way when we come to church at night you know we we just don't want to invite him here tonight oh my you know see that's where simeon made his mistake he just invited him but he said there was one she made him welcome you know what the bride can make him welcome and let's make him welcome here tonight as he comes and ministers to us and our needs and whatever we have need of tonight knowing that we we don't have to leave the same we came in amen we can leave better what a promise you don't have to come in the same you if you can go to the doctor's office and all those things and leave the same make a lot of times worse because of the diagnosis but the diagnosis tonight is you can leave better amen would you turn away that'll be all the singing and all the music would you turn with me to matthew chapter 25. i want to read just a few things and i'm getting a little feedback but i want to read starting it at verse 1 in matthew 25 and i want to take a little thought tonight by god's grace i'll try not to be very long but i pray god will help me say what he wants me to say to you i just want to be a microphone tonight amen matthew 25 verse 1 says then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said said unto the wise give us of your all for our lamps are gone out but none of the wise answered not so least there be not enough for us and you but you but go ye rather to them that sail and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh oh father i tremble and shake at your word lord father with such great respect and honor for your word oh holy spirit would you come now and speak through these lips of clay tonight lord that father the lord that i can be used in such a way to lift you up so high that you draw men to yourself father i pray you take total control of this service god for this is a victory day for us lord because you have caused us to be victorious and to live a christian life father we're so thankful to be partakers here tonight lord we ask you to do these things in the name of jesus christ our savior amen and amen you may be seated i want to talk about tonight by god's grace just for a few minutes preparation we see here that this lesson shows us about the value of being prepared amen what a what a warning to us because the bible says that they took all in their vessels with their lamps and the others did not because they had a plan but they wasn't prepared see many times we have plans and see god is the one that's got the plan all we have to do is be prepared when the pro when the plan is in the process and we're so thankful for that tonight you know we see that the five wives they are prepared they have you know they they had the all they needed they wasn't depending on nobody else they had already seen what god required of those to come but others the other five was slawful and and lazy and said well i'll just wait till you know right to the you know satan wants you to do that you know he'll many times he tries to attack us to him you know you don't have to be you don't you you don't have to be the bride just let out a little bit you know just go ahead and you you can you can be the five foolish you can make it you know but you realize you do you realize do you people do not understand are you really prepared for the tribulation are you really that that close to god that you think that you don't need to go in the rapture that you can make the make it through the tribulation see how satan tries to take give you an opportunity for a less what he tries to do i remember brother biscuit spoke the message one time land for peace and that's what satan tries to do he wants you to give your promised land and he promises you peace but he brings destruction and we look at this as it is because as we talk about the bible approach you know the bible approaching the prophet made it so simple for us in our walk with christ he said if you want to get closer to god read your bible and pray amen he said prayer is the greatest weapon we have oh i'm so thankful for that weapon tonight aren't you because the bible said when the weakest christian gets on his knees hail shakes and i challenge you tonight do a little shaking and then you'll do less quaking amen aren't you thankful for the grace of god look at the preparations i thought about this just for a minute about this look at you know when a when a surfer he is he's going out you know he begins to he's he's looking for the waves you know he's not you know he can't plan the ways when they come or how high they're going to be or what they're going to face but you know he has a preparation plan he you know he waxes his board and you know he sits out there and he's waiting for those you know for those waves to come along to ride them you know and he he if he is prepared to do this if he has been trained and taught the way to do this he'll be able to ride those waves many people have a plan that they can do this a lot of people plan that they oh yes i can i can live this message but you cannot live this message because it takes the holy ghost to live the message through you a lot of people have a plan that i'm going to be a christian i'm going to turn over a new leaf i'm going to do this i'm going to do that i'm going to do better but it's more than a plan it's a preparation god is preparing a bride tonight god is preparing us for a rapture he has a preparation for us i like what the prophet said god said he said god requires us he has one way of escape and that's through jesus christ only one provided way and i'm thankful that we have received that way i believe with all my heart this message is nothing more than jesus christ well you see we don't you know we don't know what the future holds for us a lot of people are planning for the future they're getting paranoid they're stocking up bullets they're stocking up food what good will that do when they come and take it from you because my bible tells me who can make war with the beast or its image you me let me tell you there's only one here tonight that can make war with the pieces and that's god almighty and that is who we're serving tonight that's the one that has a plan of escape from me and you he has a provided way for me in you we see that you know the the the surfer he don't know when the winds are coming or when the storms are coming but he's prepared he is preparing himself to to ride you know i like this uh oh everybody says you know we say this many times you know you you know you want to get god to laugh you just tell him your plans for your life i'm glad god laughed at my plan because my plan was way off the mark my plan was missing it by a million miles so i'm glad that god has given us this opportunity to receive the word of god proverbs 19 21 says devices devices in man's heart never did let never the less the counsel of the lord that shall stand you know no matter what device in our mind because the apostle paul told us he said casting down the imaginations and bring every thought into the obedience of jesus christ you know why they didn't accept jesus christ because he didn't come the way they planned if they would have been prepared they would have received him because those that received him was prepared to receive him we see over in the book turn women to the book of proverbs just for a minute i i'm trying to move fastly proverbs 16. do you still love the lord oh i tell you this is so real this is this is so rich for us proverbs 16 it says a man's heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps oh and you're glad you have direction tonight aren't you aren't you glad that god sent us a message that has directed mind in your steps that has brought us in the presence of god in such a way that he has revealed himself to us in the message things that ought to be 1965 he says what is science preparing for you where did they say this cove with virus come from from a laboratory brother branham already warned us that they would start germ warfare he said be prepared have the token and the bible promises those that love and fear he'll protect him he said he encamps his angels around them so he already has a plan of protection for us if we'll be prepared by praying and reading our bible like we should don't ever lose your love for christ he said what are they preparing for what is science preparing for you more death that's right spudniks on everything to scatter death and everything across the earth he said don't look to that turn your head higher than that towards heaven he said look where jesus sits on the right hand of god tonight ever living to make intercessions on our confession what about the intercessions on our confessions he said of what of what we believe his word he we our you know he he didn't ask me and you yeah to understand everything and it seems like this is the age where everybody needs to understand everybody information is flowing everywhere information everybody you want to go and you say well i i need to know what this is i need to know what that is and when we didn't have all that we didn't have the need tonight amen ever since the tree of knowledge has come man has had a desire to know and fail to see god by wanting to know they didn't want to know the right things they wanted to know knowledge they wanted to become as gods there was already gods they took a lesser lesser position because what they accepted and that's what caused all of us to fall into this chaos same message and things that ought to be he said you you must be filled with the holy spirit see amen i'm glad of that yeah you know total obedience to every word entitles you to them brother brown said we don't even need to take the lord's supper if we don't have the holy spirit right we need to come and take things lightly i'm thankful that god has given us the ability to be partakers of him how are you partaker of him by receiving his spirit in your heart amen he said just he said you must be filled with the holy ghost see just keep adding on don't just stop with your experience years ago every day every minute say god i need a refreshing i need a refilling lord lord i'm not going to leave here tonight until i receive a refreshing of your spirit amen amen he said keep on going you're growing into the statue of a son and daughter of god he said my god is able to prepare us and to give to us that which we crave in our life amen that we must see something how in here once how many in here wants him more wants more of god i can say me me i've got him but i want more [Applause] i have an addiction to him i have been vulcanized to him i have a need to lay on the breast of el shaddai because david said i've tasted of him and i know he's good he said how many here once more of god he said the congregation says amen he said why he said it goes to show that there is more for you see many people come and they recognize brother brahem as a prophet and that's good they're satisfied i want to see the god of the prophet [Applause] i want to i want to be like him and he said the prophet said i want to see the god of elijah and that's what elijah come to do to restore us back restore the children back to the faith of the fathers the first one with the spirit of elijah had was john the baptist and he restored the hearts of the fathers back to the children but through all the ages god had to send a preparation for us to prepare me in you for a breath amen he said he said why it goes to show that there's more for you see you're craving it amen i say tonight if you're not craving it i'm pray god create a greater craving for you in my heart than i've ever had put a greater hunger a greater desire for you amen he said your little birth pains are coming on see you need more so that we can be happy and free and perfect he said we've got to be god does the planning he expects us to be prepared let's turn to jeremiah just for a minute jeremiah 29 29 start at verse 11. listen to this god already had a plan for jeremiah jeremiah didn't have a god already had had a preparation had a plan for him he just needed jeremiah to be ready to be prepared for the journey amen verse 11 says in jeremiah 21 says for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not evil to give you an expectation what are you expecting of your end as a christian just to die and go into the grave i'm expecting to be in a rapture [Applause] and if the grave was to take me it's not going to keep me right like the old brother used to saying brother willie terry ain't no grave gonna hold my body down he said there was a sleep oh hallelujah he said listen expect it in then shall you call upon me he said i'm gonna he said my oh i love that thoughts of peace not evil to give you and expect it in then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart that's what he desires he said seek ye first the kingdom of god amen and all his righteousness and everything will be added unto you see we try to get ahead of the pain the plan we want to receive all this will be added first but he has a plan seek ye first in other words put me first let me be the centerpiece of your life let me be the lord of your life not just god but lord there are many gods but there's only one lord jesus christ there's only one lord one faith one baptism can you imagine how it would be if there was two with two there would be two opinions there would be two ways but he said i'm going to make it so easy that you won't stumble at it oh hallelujah notice that god doesn't say let me know what your plan is what your plans are and i'll bless you god's not asking jeremiah let me know what your plans is and i'll bless you he's telling you i have an expected end for you be prepared for the journey preparing involves calling upon the lord coming to jesus in a relationship praying seeking the lord with all your heart he said seek me with all your heart listen i love this right here our faith is not one more item on our to-do list our faith is not one more item and on our to-do list our faith forms our to-do list our faith prepares us for the to-do list oh glory to god look at the 10 ver all the 10 virgins for the wedding with the lamps with lamps in expectation you know i like what charles spurgeon said he said i don't i don't want to a lamp just a lamp profession with not a without at all possession many people have seen the lamp many people carry the lamp but only a few have the possession of the oil it's more than a profession it's a possession do you know that your condition does not determine your position for many are the reflections of the righteous but i am why like that that conjunction word but i am the lord thy god that delivereth them out of them sometimes oh that's good enough for me he didn't say we wouldn't go through it he said i'll bring you out of it it didn't come to stay come to leave and when it leaves it gives you a testimony how can you have a test demoni without a test a test brings a testimony and you know sometimes we don't realize that during the test is when the teacher is the quietest he don't have to tell you how you're doing you just keep taking the test and say lord be it unto me according to thy word amen no hallelujah he said we look at this we could never guess look at this if we just went a lot of people said well the message is just long dress long hair this do's and don'ts do you know that that the foolish had the same apparel they had the same lamp they had the same wedding garment they had all the same but they failed to have the oil it's not the dress that sets us apart from the foolish it's the oil that separates us from the hallelujah the foolish were on their own timetable i'll do it when i really need it instead of preparing for the journey he said let your lamps be trimmed and full and see when the the wise caught that revelation they said lord i don't want to run out keep me full every day keep my lamp trimmed lord sometimes i may get sleepy and slawful because of this age but lord don't let me go to sleep without no oil hallelujah god will not let us sleep without oil that's our his predestinated bride she may have been intoxicated by this laodicean spirit she may have slept she may have slumbered but she didn't lose her oil and she was not willing to give it up many are willing to give up but not the bride oh hallelujah if they were just see they was not prepared brother jason for the delay they was not prepared they thought it's going to happen right now as soon as we hear it we're gonna run down and get it don't plan prepare god already has the plan you just be prepared to go through the process oh hallelujah the foolish they they had planned a certain time a time when they were just you know i like this can i say it like this right here tonight the foolish remind me of a fan instead of a follower that's what i believe around the message a lot of people we're finding out that we thought was followers of this message are really fans and it's not going the way they planned so guess what what is a fan an enthusiastic admirer we're not here admiring it we're here absorbing it we're being partakers of it hallelujah this is not a game this is not a sport this is life and death amen oh glory to god what does the word preparation mean the action or process of making ready are you making yourself ready the bible even commissioned us he said the bride hath made herself ready why she has wrote herself in his word she has received his all his life his holy spirit she's prepared for the journey amen why would you go on a camping trip and not bring supplies why would you go anywhere and not be why would you get in your car on a trip and not put gas in it it's the same perspiration with christ you know why we don't receive more when we're in church it's because we don't prepare before we get here it's a preparation program said we need to be prayed up when we come here not just planned up right we need to be prayed up we need to take time and say god i need something because our times sister debbie is running out we're not going to have this opportunity very much longer you better make the best of it what if this is the glory be to god what if this night is the last time they allow us to come together but i want to tell you something right there when abraham had communion with melchizedek with the bread and the wine that's when the promised sign was spoken oh hallelujah this could be the last time we take communion now what's what is god's promise this promised son coming taking his wife on oh hallelujah aren't you thankful for the grace of god we just don't need a lamp profession we need all possession it says making ready or being made ready for us god has making us ready through giving us this message turn with me to john chapter 17. verse starts at verse 17. oh i love the script this right here i take this and you know that brother brown said that the the word of god will defeat satan anytime anywhere any place under any circumstance 17 17. look at this right here this oh look at the preparation jesus did for us let's look at this starting in verse 17. let's see listen to this sanctify them through thy truth thy word what a message of sanctification what a message of placing us in the scriptures showing you your position in christ that's what this message did he said for sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth listen to this and he says as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes who says our saints he said i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth what a message this message was truth disprove this message with the bible you cannot do it there's nothing that matches it amen no hallelujah amen listen to this i love i use this on the devil all the time verse 20 neither pray i for these alone but for them which also shall believe on me through their word god had to send a word for us to believe through he had to send somebody somebody had to come and bring the word so god always uses a prophet to bring the word to us it was like the eunuch when the unit was there reading reading the scrolls of isaiah and here here is philip in this great revival it looked like well that was the plan to be there but there was one that needed needed instruction so he was prepared for the journey so he just got plucked up and sat there and there was that eunuch and he said oh i love this i use this on on many people understand this thou what thou read us how many people has read this bible how many how many men has come and poked and prodded at this i love the answer of the eunuch he said how can i understand except a man show me glory be to god the holy ghost is a person oh glory to god he said look verse 21 said that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me do you believe he said if you don't believe me believe the words for they are eternal life he said search the scriptures for anything you think you have eternal life but they are they they testify of me oh hallelujah what a more sure a word we have what a promise what a what a what a magnificent revelation what was this man what is the message to us it's the mighty god unveiled it's the invisible union of the bridegroom oh glory the action or process of making ready modern events made clear by prophecy again he said if we know the hour we're living in then we can't prepare for it if it wasn't god's sense of profit everything was looking when we was it looked bad then little did we know it was going to get worse we really had we really had no idea what i was going to go on we would be like other people thinking well god's in control you know he brought us through eight eight years of this regime in four years of this one how come he came bring us through four more and fail to see the signs fail to be prepared to recognize your day in this message that's where people fail to recognize their day and their message he said then we can prepare for the ire but if we go in blindly then jesus said if the blind lead the blind they'll all fall into the ditch i'd hate to be following a blind man trying to lead me through the scriptures it took a prophet what is the prophet it's the seer the eyes the eyes god send us the understanding of the word that we might see more clearly paul said i look through a stained glass that's what now we see clearly god has removed this he i tell you i cannot say enough about this message it is the it is the glasses to see the word amen god didn't write his word in braille for blind people he give us i saved to see his word that's what this message is to me as i say i tell you it's a gold mine i'm a prospector oh i get in there and i get lost there's so many nuggets i can't even keep up with them i'm just polishing then packing polishing the packet preparing for the journey [Applause] so father listen to this so father we pray you let us see the ark there the door open the message is calling us in what is the art it's not a boat anymore it's christ christ is our ark right now in him he said he is the cliff and the rock that the righteous can run there and be saved oh hallelujah i'll tell you preparation we must be prepared for this journey if you're on a run running you have to train yourself and prepare for the long distance but you know what god sent us a word in this hour that we would be able to run the distance we would be able to carry the baton of truth in this hour we find out and in the message isaiah 40 also vindicated look at this john he said a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his past straight he said the church did not believe him for he was not of their group he was not part of their plan right brother i said this message did not come to the world and come to the bride it's not a social event it's a revelation things that ought to be he said i look daily for him i watch keeping myself prepared for that hour are you prepared for the hour amen listen to this in in first corinthians chapter 14. let's turn there just for a minute let me see if oh yeah i'm trying god is so good how many people have started this journey without a preparation without a born-again experience with god they can receive it on their flesh every day of their life and die and go to hell yeah it's not it's not a stimulate not i know i love it when it when it comes and it makes you shout scream speak in tongues all that but you know what that's not that's not just that's not that's not it right when it changes the nature in your heart and it takes away the desire and the water you say you can do this you have the rights you're under freedom or let you do what you want to but when god comes in there sister gene he takes away the wonky you know why i don't do it because i don't want to because i don't want to do anything to hurt him because he done everything he took my hurt he took my shame he took everything and nailed it to a cross why would i want to shame him by disbelieving him no hallelujah 14 started verse 8. listen to this he said for if a trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself from battle and she could have god the same i love that because you know what the bible said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow the trumpet has sound what is the trumpet oh hallelujah it's a message he if it give an uncertain sound who can prepare ain't you glad that god has prepared us for this hour has made us ready by his love and grace verse 9 says so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air aren't you glad god's in fourth grade easy to understand spoke the common man's language who received him gladly the common man yeah amen what did jesus speak the common man's language and they received him gladly amen have you received this matches with gladness if you're answer you're really not prepared you just think you are even though you may recognize but until you realize you'll never be part of it there's a difference between recognizing and realizing realizing that you're part of it it's not a history story but when you become part of it it's a realization to you it's a living reality living in your heart oh hallelujah luke 1 17 says and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord they tell what this message did john look at the look at the beautiful parallel with this message in the message of john the baptist amen look at the parallels that come to prepare the people for the coming of the lord that's what this message has prepared us for john did his part people say oh john the baptist fulfilled all of malachi 4. no he didn't because it never said he'd turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers people failed to see that there is a conjunction there john did what he do but behold i send them to you elijah the prophet personal to you brother luther to me to each one of us it's got to become personal to you he said behold i send unto you he didn't send it to everybody he sent it to those jews what is it you it's a little lamb and who is he the good shepherd amen amen he sent his word to his little lambs and they received it gladly oh hallelujah oh i'm so thankful for the grace of god ain't you what was john's commission the things that he was commissioned can we not see the types of the preparation that was going through john's ministry the same thing that went through the prophet brother branham's men i'm not ashamed of this message my goodness i cannot say enough about it i'm so glad yeah the light has come i'm so glad that he said rise and shine for thy light has come what did john do he made he how did he get them ready by getting their attention yeah what did the prophet do through that first rule getting their attention getting them to recognize that this is something of god this is not man this is god secondly what happened what did it do by getting their attention and await their conscience you ought to be so glad you have a conscience tonight the holy spirit telling you you shouldn't have done that right many people say it don't bother me then is your conscience being seared with an eye yeah people say oh the hormone say don't bother me now that's tough that don't bother me do you know what i like what charles peters said about that he said he said if sin does not vets you i doubt you have the faith of lot because the bible said it vexed his soul daily it doesn't bother it doesn't bother you it even bothered lot yes we're not locked then shouldn't it bother the bride not not maggie or discouraged or or discontent but letting her know this is not my home you know what this is doing you know what this is causing he is plucking the feathers out of the nest and every time we think we can get comfortable brother magic time to fly wait a minute let me get let me relax oh he said keep flapping keep flapping take flight little bride be prepared for the flight this is ahead listen to this the third thing john did pointing out the nature of true religion not man's religion but the nature of god his religion what is true religion john told us what it was james told us in the book of jesus this is true you can go back and read it for yourself what did the word point us back to true we see that the fourth thing declaring the grace and power of jesus christ behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world amen and those that heard it received it gladly amen amen lamb of god who is this man illegitimate child born out of wetlock he can't be this we know then they even had professions we have abraham we named be not born in fornication oh yes there was spiritual fornication amen amen because they become religious instead of becoming christians what do we need to do we need to put complete trust in jesus christ luke chapter 8 i'm trying to speed up luke chapter eight start at verse five with me look at this just for a few minutes i'm not gonna i'm trying to go but you know how old country boys are not real fast they're not real fast hey but i believe the lord would want us to this to soak down in our heart for us start let's read it verse five just for a minute just to teach things just for a minute talking about the preparation aren't you glad god sent a place for us to go luke chapter 8 verse 5 amen satan trying to play tricks with my eyes amen they said i had good eyesight and then the doctor tried to give me some medicine in this he prayed for me god i tried to man his brothers my eyes i just quit taking he said why don't you take it i said cause i don't need it i said i see better without it he said that's just side effects i said i don't want to take something with side effects i want to take something they don't have no no side effects you know what that is the stripes of jesus christ comes without side effects starting at verse five let's look he said a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some some fell by the wayside and was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture you ever been around people that lack moisture the joy of the lord i'm a christian i went to church today i said my somebody needs some water oh cactus take a drink represent said if they would if the water would be there in in the desert that old sticky would turn into a leaf i said just emerge yourself in the washing of the water the word and you won't be so sticky we don't need sticky christians we need christians with love and peace and joy in their heart lack moisture and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it what was that jesus said the cares of this life you know the sea can come and if you let the cares of this life override what you've received it will choke out the sea oh my how dangerous it is we live in he said i like this verse eight and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit in a hundred fold and when he had said these things he cried he that happened here's to here let him hear you know some of the grain you know some of the grain fell on ground and the birds plucked it up others fell among thorns and was choked out by the cares of this life but you know what there was a place of the ground as the sowing process was going that it was already prepared your heart has to be prepared for the word when we come to the house of god your heart must be prepared for the sowing of the word oh hallelujah he said prepared ground brother brown said when he said and some went on prepared ground pre-prepared ground i like that not just prepared ground pre-prepared ground that shows predestination and brought forth god's word is a seed the ground must be prepared before the word what is the what is the things that went out what did the what come was a shout what was the shout that come in this hour it was a message for the people to get ready for the coming of the lord the second thing was the voice was was the second thing was the voice what was the voice the voice of the resurrection getting the bride ready for the marriage supper of the lamb and for the dead in christ to be rised make you glad god showed us these things amen the third thing the trumpet is the calling the people to the feast the feast of the trumpets what is the feast of the trumpets to the gentiles it's the marriage supper of the lamb amen let us stand aren't you glad tonight that god sent us a message of preparation to prepare a bride to take a rapture what a privilege and honor we have here tonight don't ever let satan devalue what god has given you don't ever take it lightly don't ever half-heartedly handle it but treasure it with all of your heart let's bow our heads lord as we come to this time of triumphant lord you have caused us as paul said to triumphant to be partakers of this lord this communion tonight lord i pray father that it will do supernatural things to us lord when we protect this lord may it refill us with your holy spirit if we're sick in our bodies aches and pains may we be healed father lord let it be done that you might receive glory tonight lord father i pray you bless the remainder of this service bless your children here tonight lord let them realize that we must be prepared let us not have just a lamp profession but may we have an oil possession god thank you for the holy ghost thank you for these people may you bless them lord they've been kind to your unworthy servant now father may you reign out spiritual physical and financial blessings upon them god may you let them know to be prepared for the journey for it's going home time we thank you lord for your grace and mercy we give the remainder of service to you in jesus christ's name amen brother jason hallelujah hallelujah he hadn't left us unprepared hey man god bless you can be seated [Music] wow what a word you know i've um throughout the whole day have had a thing on my heart that i've just kind of been preparing as we come to the to the lord's supper and i just was left rather astonished at how very tracking right along brother richie's sermon was tonight with the burden that's been on my heart and um then even just as i was um sitting there listening and then another confirmation came in so i know it's the lord amen you know we're going to take the lord's supper just in a few minutes this okay i could just give you my heart for a few minutes yes i'm gonna do it anyway amen you know i we we come up here and we we take the lord's supper we take the wine and the bread and the you know there's a lot of care and preparation that go into there's a lot of a lot of preparing as brother richie was talking about and you know now and that doesn't that doesn't set us apart from other churches that take the lord's supper they have a lot of preparing too they do it in different ways i've seen i've seen ways before that were so sacrilegious that i was a visitor and uh had a way back in the day years ago had a friend of mine that we worked with and kind of made one of those deals i'll come to your church if you'll come to mind don't make those deals because they don't keep them amen i kept my side of it he never did show up i think he thought i'd become a mormon and he wouldn't have to show up at my church but it didn't work out that way because god god already had a plan for my life and it wasn't going to be that thank you jesus and you know it was so it was so really just so irreverent that i wouldn't even the lord even spoke to me very directly you you not only will you not take it when they come to you won't even look at it and when they step to my status looked away and they moved on i believe that the lord's supper is a solemn amen thing and it means something it's not just uh it's not just religiosity it's not just a form you know it's not just some ritual no sir there's no magic potion in these little wine cups there's no incantation we don't transform this bread into anything no sir that's that's babylonian heathenism that's exactly right brother but it does have tremendous representation hallelujah i thought about that that scripture that brother richie was referring to there is one of my favorite passages where jesus said sanctify them by thy truth thy word is truth so how do you get a sanctified life by feeding on the word amen see the the remember friends don't lose sight of the parable the seed that was being sown that jesus talks about that's the gospel amen jesus called it a seed and it's good seed i want you to understand that the gospel is good seed friend you can put your bank your life on it that's exactly right but it it falls in in ground and that's the people hearing the gospel that's you amen that's anybody and so you know even even certain ground where the seed falls in you know that ground is not dedicated to just receiving the seed alone that ground also has thorns that grow in it and you know where that comes from because we haven't sanctified our lives because the way you sanctify your life is by feeding on the word which is the body which is what the bread represents exactly right amen you're following me but you know we it this this area of ground is like that person that's kind of a mixed betting ground they feed on the word but they also feed on the world and the seed of the word comes up but the seed of the world comes right up and chokes it right down and you just never really produce anything for the lord i want you to realize tonight when you come to take this bread and this wine this represents something it's not magic there's there it's not anything special we we prepare it in a special way but it it's it's like you can't go to the to the water and because you were baptized in water that gives you the new birth that water only is a is an answer to your conscience of a good testimony that you've already you've already believed the word and so you go to the water as your first act of obedience the first of many acts of obedience but the water doesn't save you no sir this bread and this wine isn't going to do one thing for you if you don't absorb and take ownership of what it stands for and it stands for his body his broken body that was broken for you and his blood in the new testament which in the blood is the life so it's the holy ghost amen and i i was thinking all day today i thought lord i don't even i can't even get my i can't even i can't figure out how to put a how would i equal the value of the word that we have today in this message amen this message that we feed on you're coming to take bread but i'm here to tell you something friends you're already feeding on i'll say this that that this feeding and that feeding ought to be the same they ought to be ken you ought not to be feeding on this if you're not feeding on that amen does that make sense god has sent this word and this message and it has every thing every purifying element in it and i just thought to myself lord you know it it it begs the question i i have to ask myself i mean i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to come up here and you know sister gene has labored to prepare the bread and brother luther has taken care with the wine and and you know and we come up here and we uncover it and we find all kinds of other items up here you know that sister gene and brother luther thought well this might be good to throw this into no we want the pure form right here i want exactly the word formula and i don't want any contaminants and i don't want any other thing there i want exactly what he what he did and told me to do and that's exactly why i'm here and and when i'm feeding on the body word of the son of man i'm gonna tell you something friends i'm gonna i'm gonna take our text tonight from luke 22. turn there with me and i don't normally take luke i normally take first corinthians 11 or i have occasionally taken mark 14. [Music] but i i just kept feeling strangely the lord just kept saying no not that keep going and i found myself i said well maybe he wants me to read it from luke and as soon as i read it i felt there it is now watch luke 22. verse 14. and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer it wasn't his first passover it wasn't their first passover they had been eating passover every year of their jewish life you understand that jesus had they had had the passover every year of his ministry so so so when you when you think about the passover jesus said it's not about any other passover i've ever had i've been waiting and waiting for this one because this is going to be the the it's going to be a first and the last it's going to be the last time i eat it with you and i won't ever eat it again until i eat it with you again in my father's kingdom so in that sense it's now the first passover for the church that's getting ready to be born and i'm here to tell you something friends you have arrived and i believe that we're looking at a passover and it might as brother richie said it might be tonight the lord's voice might echo through this building any minute and say i've been waiting for a while to eat this passover with you hallelujah amen pray lord we see prophecy unfolding with shocking clarity more clear than any of us i can tell you something friends just as as stunned as i am and we have been to say we're still here in 2021. equally or more so was i shocked to see brother branham's sixth vision fulfilled with such clarity such minute detail and i'm looking at an image that's on the news and i'm listen i'm reading brother branham's description and he says i saw it he's seeing a vision and i just said to some brothers i said now put yourself in a prophet's position put yourself in his shoes for a moment you're standing there looking at a vision and you're describing it this is going to take place and i said now look at that picture and find any detail that's not precisely what he described seeing even to the color of the garment that she's wearing we're almost home we're almost home hallelujah we're almost home jesus desired to eat this passover and he's desiring to eat that one with us anew and i want to tell you something friends when you come tonight to take the lord's supper we're going to read it here in a minute i want you just to bear in mind that you're feeding what you're eating here is representative of what you should be eating on a daily basis exactly right that's that's what's been on my heart all day long i want to say it again what you're eating here is representative of what you ought to be feeding on every day of your life we don't we don't take we don't have sister gene bake this bread and pass it out for to put in your cupboards for every day this is representative we do this we we wanted to do it man i was we were talking about was it november december i i we loved it so much i wanted i said man let's do it every week and then covet did what it did in 2020 spiraled sideways on us and we weren't even able to have our our december lord's supper but i'm gonna have it tonight thank you jesus and it is my prayer tonight and it will be my prayer if i stand here and preside over another community service you'll hear me with this desire every time going forward it is my great hope that tonight is the last time i will eat this supper this side of glory [Music] i i want that world i want that that kingdom oh yes lord and like brother richie said this there's no way there's no way to be comfortable if you are comfortable with the sin of this world you are not born again and you need the holy ghost you need a new birth because for one thing that the new birth will do is leave you uncomfortable dabbling around in laodicea it will grieve you it will drive sleep from you it will it will break your you'll break your own heart doing it i want to say i want to say it today friends god has given us a body word of the son of man to sanctify our lives by thank you avail yourselves of it feed on it day and night because that's what jesus did and he said that's how i sanctified myself and i've given them the same the same tool i've used i'm going to give to my church amen luke 22 and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and broken and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you isn't that beautiful brother luther come and bring me a mask please brother i didn't bring one out of the back we're going to as we did last time just start with this side over here and you'll just come this way and pass along brother luther and i will set set it out and uh and as you come by just for distancing purposes uh we're going to think sir we're going to um stand back so as you come brother luther when we pray he'll break it go ahead you can begin now brother and um and then once that then the when the line gets short the middle just get in line go back around when that's lined short then this side come back around remember when you leave your seat you need to wear a mask so god bless you amen let's pray father we thank you i thank you for this service tonight i thank you for the word that i heard wow what a word what an affinity my heart has with your word oh i'm so glad that it does because no man can make himself love the word of god that is given sovereignly by god it is given by god to his family to love the word and i love the word and that's the greatest thing you could ever have done for me lord is i love your word i love your life i love i love your righteousness i love your lifestyle that's why i get grieved at myself if i find that my lifestyle doesn't match your lifestyle that's not what i'm here for lord i'm here to to carry on the testimony of jesus christ to the world if if the father if all that the father was he poured into you and then you acted just like him and then everything that you were you poured into us shouldn't we act just like you is not our lives to prove hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever jesus christ is the same in the galilean as he is in the church he's identical he that same being that created everything that is when he lived in in the sonship of a man when that same life lives in the church we will live and conduct act and react the same ways that he did now lord thankfully you know that we being born in sin we'd never live it as perfect as you did and that's why you lived the perfective you lived that perceptive side for us so our faith is in that sacrifice and in that atonement and in that life that you lived and we know that if we do make a mistake that we do have an advocate with the father which is you christ jesus so tonight lord for for those here tonight who know [Music] who know that they are firm believers and they love your word of course they make mistakes we all make mistakes but it's not in our heart to do it and so for that believer tonight that lord has made mistakes which is 100 of every believer in here we confess them to you right now we commit our hearts and we rededicate ourselves and we purpose lord from this night that my life my diet going forward is going to be reflective of the supper i'm taking now this supper is very specifically laid out in the scripture we can't just do it any old way there's an exact way to do it and i i realize lord that there is an exact way to be sanctified there's an exact way to be an overcomer there's an exact way to have the power of god operating in your life and if we live outside of that exact way then it's no wonder we feel so powerless at times so lord help us now forgive us of all of our trespasses we come to take this supper humbly and soberly i want the people to realize what it means it's not just religiosity it's not just a ritual this is a type and a shadow a symbolism of the of the accuracy of the precise preciseness the precise way of the word that we ought to have in our lives may you grant it as we come lord if we paul said if we would if we would just judge ourselves then we won't be judged with the world so tonight may we how do we judge ourselves by humbling ourselves to every word of god and saying lord i'm going to judge myself and if i see something in my life that's contrary to your nature i'm going to stop i'm gonna get that out of my life i'm gonna judge my own self so that i don't get judged with the world [Music] let a man examine himself and then once he's done that and met the requirement then let him eat of that bread and drink of that wine we commit it to you tonight lord in jesus name god bless you let this side begin to come forward at this time [Music] with [Music] way [Music] be their sins [Music] there is a fountain [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lose all [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] and see nurse plunged beneath all their kills [Music] rejoice to see [Music] his day and then [Music] my sins my sins [Music] away [Music] [Music] my sins i'll [Music] thy praise just blood shall never lose its power [Music] to the right [Music] [Music] [Laughter] to see no more be safe to sing no [Music] more [Music] till the wrath of church of god to see no more so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] um oh yes lord [Music] glory and [Music] worthy thou art worthy thou art worthy [Music] to receive glory [Music] glory and honor glory and on earth [Music] like a river attending my way when souls like sea billows what is my love thou has told me to say my soul and it is where [Music] with my soul it is well it is well with my soul [Music] my sin though satan should buff it though trials should come let this blessed assurance control [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that christ has [Music] regarded [Applause] [Music] [Music] blood [Music] [Music] yes lord with my soul oh it is well it is well with my soul my sin all the bliss my the sins of this glory asl my sin my sin not it is nailed to the cross and i'll bear it no more praise the lord praise the lord oh my soul could you raise your hands and sing it now it is well it is with my soul [Music] it is where it is my soul lord haste the day sing that verse and lord hates the day when my faith shall be sad the clouds be rolled back like a scroll [Music] the trump shall resound and the lord shall descend even so it is well with my soul [Music] it is where [Music] with my soul [Music] yes it is my soul hallelujah sing that song lord you're more precious lord you are more precious than silver [Music] and lord you are more called sleep than gold and lord you are more beautiful more beautiful than diamonds and nothing i desire compares with you why don't you raise your hands and sing that now to the lord let's just worship him lord you are and lord you are more precious than silver [Music] and lord you are more costly than gold and lord you are more beautiful than diamonds and nothing i these are compares with one more time lord you are oh and alone [Music] you are more precious than silver and lord you are more call sleep than gold and lord you are more beautiful than dawn and nothing ideas are compared with you oh and the lord yes you are more precious than silver and lord costly than gold and lord you are more beautiful than diamonds and nothing i deserve compared [Music] a man and amen it's wonderful to be a christian i want you to join me in that prayer i just prayed for brother joe you know i was i was reading an article recently um i'm sure brother andrew could probably speak to this that they're noticing that people even that were asymptomatic who caught this virus that their lungs are left in terrible condition even after they recover uh and and and some people need oxygen up to a year later and some may never get off of it and i was watching the brother in the service the other night and there with that oxygen still struggling and i just said you know lord i that ain't that ain't i ain't gonna have that amen we don't have to put up with that amen i'm the god that healeth all of thy diseases amen the word of god is health to all your flesh amen brother joe every time you open the bible and start reading scriptures open a book and start reading a message you just say i'm reading healing into my body amen and i want to see those lungs completely amen recovered so nice to have you all here tonight brother richie wow you're you're such an amazing friend amen if i was ever going to proselyted brother that would be one of them man we've been friends for a long time amen and uh you know when you find brother richie you'll find that same that same bubbling swell of water every time and uh i i've had i've had so many people say to me man i want some of what he's got amen so we appreciate him they'll be with us again in the service uh tomorrow i'll be ministering praise the lord amen amen i've been looking forward to that amen i think brother matt you have sunday school hey son yeah brother matthew i have the sunday school in the morning adult class and so uh travis are you running your class yeah praise the lord so brother travis will be i was in the fellowship hall this morning and i was looking at his board i said travis wow i'm gonna take down some of these notes i'm gonna preach on some of this stuff so i know that those children are getting some really good word-based instructions and i could see i mean he's got it right down into their life it's
