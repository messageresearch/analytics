[35:18] Practical side of things today I find
[35:21] that that comes in Seasons as it were
[35:24] and uh I think my last series dealt a
[35:26] lot with practical
[35:28] applications of life amen that's part of
[35:31] what the gospel is for amen the holy
[35:33] spirit's purpose is to lead you and
[35:37] guide you into all truth amen if it
[35:40] feels a little stuffy to you the AC was
[35:43] down Amen brother Gideon and brother
[35:45] Ethan jumped on it and got it running
[35:47] for us so we're happy amen it'll it'll
[35:50] start cooling off here in just in a
[35:52] little bit amen praise the Lord oh I
[35:56] love the these verses here here from
[35:58] Solomon Proverbs
[36:01] 3:1 my son forget not my
[36:05] law but let thine heart keep my
[36:09] Commandments for length of days and long
[36:13] life and peace shall they add to thee I
[36:18] don't really think you could get more of
[36:19] a practical lesson than that I mean
[36:24] that's like a that's like a blanket life
[36:26] insurance policy that you get to collect
[36:28] on while you're
[36:31] alive for length of days and long life
[36:34] and peace shall they add to
[36:37] thee let not mercy and Truth forsake
[36:41] thee bind them about thy neck well these
[36:44] things must be important write them upon
[36:47] the table of thine heart wow this is
[36:51] really important so shalt thou find
[36:55] favor and good understanding
[36:58] in the sight of God and
[37:01] man trust in the Lord with all thine
[37:06] heart and lean not oh listen lean not
[37:11] unto thine own understanding Amen in all
[37:16] thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall
[37:21] direct thy
[37:23] paths amen let's
[37:25] pray father we thank you than you for
[37:27] your word this
[37:29] morning thank you that we can stand here
[37:32] Lord and I I guess I would best describe
[37:36] Lord I I thought this is an odd way Lord
[37:39] all week long I've pondered this thought
[37:41] you dropped it from the heavens start to
[37:44] finish in its entirety in in in in 20
[37:48] minutes early early last Monday and all
[37:52] week Lord I've ruminated and all week
[37:54] I've added and tweaked and moved and sat
[37:58] and took the scriptures Lord because
[38:00] everything must go back to the
[38:01] scriptures we can say something is from
[38:04] you but we've got to be able to take it
[38:06] back to the word and prove that it's
[38:08] from you we can't trust just our own
[38:10] feelings and emotions Lord we've got to
[38:13] be established on your word so I've just
[38:16] Lord been able to go through the
[38:18] scriptures Point by point and every bit
[38:21] of this Lord is established in thy word
[38:24] father we won't it won't be necessary to
[38:26] read every single there's so many
[38:28] scriptures I have we'd spend the whole
[38:30] time but Lord I know that these are
[38:32] believers and I know Lord that the holy
[38:35] spirit will make it real and so we will
[38:38] give the references that we feel are
[38:40] necessary Lord and we'll track it back
[38:43] and connected to the word at all times I
[38:45] feel this morning Lord as I pondered
[38:48] this thought I thought I feel like
[38:51] Simeon who who was who was led by the
[38:54] Holy Spirit and he came to the to the
[38:57] word he came to Christ to the little
[38:59] babe Lord as Mary brought him in that
[39:02] day Lord and he was led of the Holy
[39:04] Ghost Lord and I just feel like all this
[39:07] week that's where I've arrived to Lord
[39:09] I've come now to the word lord to bless
[39:13] the word and to be blessed by the word
[39:15] and to say it's true and pledge my
[39:18] allegiance to the word of God lord I
[39:20] want to have a fresh Allegiance Lord in
[39:22] my heart to your word today may it be so
[39:25] may you be our portion we commit it to
[39:27] you in jesus' name amen God bless you as
[39:31] you are
[39:39] seated as I said there are so many
[39:44] passages that I could have
[39:48] um read today we're going to read a
[39:51] number of them so bubs just stay ready
[39:54] because we're going to give you a
[39:55] workout today amen praise the
[40:05] Lord Advantage is something
[40:09] that I would say is has a universal
[40:13] appeal I I certainly would say that we
[40:16] definitely don't want to find ourselves
[40:19] disadvantaged you know as soon as you
[40:21] know as soon as you start to come up on
[40:24] an idea you know the human mind mind
[40:27] automatically begins to work on well is
[40:30] this going to be good or bad is this
[40:32] going to be to my advantage or to my
[40:35] disadvantage and we make decisions all
[40:37] the time based on that we make business
[40:40] decisions amen we make family decisions
[40:44] we make you know uh we we make where
[40:48] where where we're going to live is this
[40:51] going to be to my advantage or to my
[40:52] disadvantage will this job be to my
[40:54] advantage or to my disadvantage and you
[40:57] know will this relationship will this
[41:00] friendship will this activity will will
[41:04] this Venture will this investment is
[41:08] this going to work to my advantage I'm
[41:10] pretty sure that we would have 100%
[41:13] agreement that we like advantage and we
[41:17] don't too much like
[41:18] disadvantage amen and there's nothing
[41:21] wrong with that that's human nature and
[41:24] and the Lord you know even even said
[41:27] that he says I would that you prosper
[41:30] and be in health we'll read that just in
[41:32] a few minutes I would that you prosper
[41:35] and be in health I remember you know
[41:39] some time ago way back in the day
[41:41] actually when I was just a young
[41:43] Minister you know I had a little bit of
[41:45] a struggle you know I hadn't been uh
[41:49] preaching in the pull pit all that long
[41:50] I'd been working in Ministry for years
[41:52] ahead of preaching in the pull pit but I
[41:55] remember that when I finally St St
[41:57] behind the pull pit it was a it was a
[41:59] whole new world and it was next level
[42:01] and I realized that and and and I you
[42:04] know and I I wouldn't do it for a long
[42:06] time until I felt fully equipped and
[42:08] ready for that so I I stayed in in in in
[42:11] lower levels of ministry and public
[42:13] Bible studies and Sunday School classes
[42:16] and things like that not that there's uh
[42:18] lower and Le and higher levels of
[42:20] ministry it's all Ministry I'm just
[42:22] talking about that you know you've got a
[42:24] different kind of an audience when
[42:25] you're standing behind a pull pit
[42:28] there's expectations and that's not
[42:30] wrong and I I think that if somebody
[42:33] comes behind a pull pit he ought to have
[42:35] something to say and I'll tell you
[42:37] something friends I appreciate the
[42:39] ministry God has given us at bethl
[42:41] Tabernacle I I I will confess openly
[42:44] that high octane delivery will entertain
[42:47] me for about 15 minutes but after that
[42:50] you better have something to say or I'm
[42:52] going to be very much impatient and I
[42:55] over the years I've been very zealous
[42:57] and guarded the pull pit here at bethl
[43:00] Tabernacle we don't want to see you come
[43:03] here and waste your time this is not a
[43:05] social gospel you being here is not a
[43:09] social experiment this is the house of
[43:12] God this the house of God's bread this
[43:14] is bethl Tabernacle and we believe that
[43:17] we are coming it's a house of correction
[43:20] it's a house of of instruction it's a
[43:23] house of judgment it's a house of
[43:24] encouragement it's a House of Prayer
[43:27] it's a house of the presence of God and
[43:30] it is a privilege to come to it for me
[43:33] for you and it is a great privilege to
[43:36] hear the word of God and find within you
[43:39] an amen that's beyond
[43:42] you I love the fact that that even when
[43:45] I even when I hear things preached
[43:47] across the pull pit that might scald me
[43:49] a little bit might might you know really
[43:52] bring some correction and and and and in
[43:54] my own human Spirit I'm a little bit
[43:56] quiet it but I hear another voice down
[43:59] inside of me saying amen amen amen I'm
[44:03] here to tell you friends that's that's
[44:05] what a new birth is that there is a
[44:07] being other than you living in you
[44:10] Hallelujah and so that we were we were
[44:13] dealing with the young people on that
[44:14] the other night at the at the minister I
[44:16] mean at the youth service Brother Brad
[44:18] was teaching on what is the Holy Ghost
[44:20] and we were just in our wrapping up
[44:21] comments showing that it is the new
[44:24] birth it is the spirit of Christ
[44:27] living inside you and here's the beauty
[44:30] that was always the plan yes am that was
[44:34] always the plan God was always after
[44:37] that he was never going to just stay God
[44:39] above us he wanted to be God Among Us
[44:43] and God with us and that's what Jesus
[44:45] was he was God with us but even even
[44:49] Jesus wasn't prep even Jesus was never
[44:52] going to be willing and God was never
[44:55] going to be willing to stay bottled up
[44:59] in the body of one man walking the
[45:01] shores of Galilee uh because he wanted
[45:04] to not just be in Christ he wanted
[45:08] through Christ to be in all of us and so
[45:12] what is the Holy Ghost it is the new
[45:14] birth what is the new birth it's being
[45:16] born again of the spirit of God and that
[45:20] is a beautiful thing and that that is
[45:22] what begins to challenge us to push us
[45:26] forward and drive us with Zeal to allow
[45:29] the word because that's where you know
[45:31] brother Brandon made it so clear
[45:33] concerning we we've told you know don't
[45:36] ever don't ever try to put God in a box
[45:38] don't ever dictate to him how he must
[45:42] answer your prayer don't do that he's a
[45:45] king and he's not he's not accustomed to
[45:47] being dictated to you understand we'll
[45:50] get to more of that in a little bit I'm
[45:51] getting ahead of myself but I'm already
[45:53] feeling like preaching and so so we we
[45:57] that that it is it is Christ taking the
[46:01] head the position of headship in your
[46:03] life that's what being a Christian is I
[46:06] want you to know he's earned
[46:07] it I want you to know he's worthy of it
[46:11] he deserves to be first in your life he
[46:13] has earned first place in your life he
[46:16] doesn't want to be second he does not
[46:18] deserve to be second and it's to your
[46:20] disadvantage to make him
[46:23] second say well why don't he just make
[46:25] himself first cuz he's a gentleman he
[46:27] won't do that it's like a young lady
[46:30] wouldn't want wouldn't want some young
[46:32] man to force himself on her Christ is a
[46:35] he she'd want him to be a gentleman
[46:37] Christ is a gentleman he will not force
[46:39] himself on uh even his elect lady as as
[46:42] the possible calls or even the bride of
[46:44] Christ it's and he has every right to do
[46:46] it because he gave his life to purchase
[46:49] you and therefore you are no longer
[46:51] yours you're his you belong to him and
[46:54] that's an advantage because that means
[46:56] you have eternal
[46:58] life so so what if the world has to
[47:02] reject me and Scorn me and ridicule me
[47:05] I'll still be alive 20 million years
[47:07] after they're
[47:09] gone Hallelujah so what does it matter
[47:13] anyway I'll be alive 20 million years
[47:15] after Lucifer's
[47:17] gone and when I'm a 20 million years
[47:20] past him I won't be one day older or
[47:23] have one day less to be past luer I'm
[47:26] going to be glad had to be past
[47:30] him so there are so many advantages of
[47:33] loving the true God it doesn't do you a
[47:36] lot of good I'm not saying it doesn't do
[47:39] you some good to be a church member to
[47:43] clean up your life to appreciate the
[47:45] fine qualities of Jesus to try to
[47:48] emulate some of his uh decent moral ways
[47:51] of honesty and integrity uh those things
[47:54] are fine but you understand friends that
[47:57] none of your works of your flesh will
[48:00] ever gain you eternal life you can't
[48:02] earn eternal life like that you have to
[48:05] die and be reborn again that's how the
[48:08] Holy Spirit comes it's got to be a
[48:09] willing death it's got to be you know
[48:13] Christ in you the hope of
[48:15] glory so when you when you're willing to
[48:19] go the way of the word all the way fully
[48:22] cuz that's the only way the Seal of the
[48:24] Holy Spirit comes and it's you got to be
[48:27] willing like Jesus to die be buried and
[48:31] then resurrected amen see so so when you
[48:35] when you won't do that then you you live
[48:38] you know in in just varying degrees of
[48:41] sanctification there's value in that uh
[48:44] but there's but really to pass from
[48:47] Death un life you must be born again you
[48:51] must
[48:53] be go living you know going to a church
[48:56] is good but you know parking your car in
[49:01] a garage is a good thing but parking it
[49:05] in a garage didn't ain't what made it a
[49:07] car you can't sit in a garage and become
[49:10] a car so going to church can be a good
[49:14] thing although the devil can use that
[49:17] against you you know it I mean whenever
[49:20] you refuse let me just put it this way
[49:22] say well how how can how can let me just
[49:24] take that side of it for a second how
[49:26] can go going to a church be a bad thing
[49:28] well brother ROM talks about that
[49:31] there's this principle that sometimes
[49:33] can happen it's not in every case but it
[49:35] can happen is that you you bring
[49:38] unconverted people and set them in a
[49:40] church and tell them they're okay
[49:43] right and they really know they're not
[49:47] but they take your word for it and then
[49:50] God can't deal with them anymore cuz
[49:52] they already think they're okay and
[49:54] they're not okay and brother said all
[49:57] you're doing is piling up Stones he said
[49:59] you'd have been better to left them out
[50:00] there then they knew what they were and
[50:03] then God could deal with them I I heard
[50:05] brother Glenn Miller many years ago a
[50:06] former pastor of mine gone on to be with
[50:08] the Lord he said you cannot convince a
[50:11] man that he needs salvation if you first
[50:15] can't convince him that he's
[50:17] lost you can't convince him to be saved
[50:21] and be found unless you can first prove
[50:23] to him that he's lost see and so as
[50:27] preachers we go through the the word of
[50:29] God and we make that case we prove that
[50:32] you're born in sin the Bible proves that
[50:35] you're conceived and you're shaped in
[50:37] iniquity uh the Bible proves in in in
[50:41] separate places I know people daisy
[50:43] chain that together that's actually not
[50:45] grouped together like that in any verse
[50:47] born in you know born in sin shapen in
[50:50] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[50:51] that's a daisy chain of of truths that
[50:54] are found in various places of the
[50:55] scripture it's certainly true and and so
[50:59] the Bible proves these things and it
[51:01] proves that there's none good no not one
[51:04] it proves that we're we're all Sinners
[51:06] and we all need to be
[51:10] reborn so so there there there comes
[51:13] then this this Advantage so there's
[51:16] advantages and
[51:18] disadvantages to joining a church to
[51:21] being a better just to being a better
[51:24] person but just being a better person
[51:26] right does that make sense so there's
[51:29] advantages and there's
[51:30] disadvantages when I'm when I'm thinking
[51:33] of
[51:34] something that would certainly have to
[51:38] be the most important thing to any human
[51:42] being is eternal life amen and so if if
[51:47] it's something that's not important but
[51:50] the most important thing then I want to
[51:53] I would like to know that I have the
[51:56] version
[51:57] that is all
[51:59] Advantage completely Advantage say well
[52:03] but don't Born Again people make
[52:05] mistakes that's the advantage they do
[52:08] and it don't
[52:11] count say but but but do do they get do
[52:15] they get punished also they do because
[52:18] because Godly Parents will correct
[52:20] children and he's first a heavenly
[52:22] father and he will correct his children
[52:25] see but and that's why brother Ram said
[52:27] you'll do wrong as a Believer you're
[52:29] still in the flesh you'll even willfully
[52:31] do wrong you'll make mistakes but it's
[52:33] not in your heart to do it and that's
[52:36] why you repent I mean otherwise then why
[52:38] did you repent because it means you
[52:40] didn't want to do that you didn't want
[52:41] to be that and you go to the Lord you
[52:43] say I didn't I don't want that in my
[52:45] life and if we're and if we're faithful
[52:48] to confess our sins then he's faithful
[52:50] to forgive our sinsen so the prophet
[52:53] said you will do wrong as in making
[52:55] stumbles and mistakes
[52:57] he says but that doesn't mean you're not
[52:58] a son it just means the rod of
[53:00] Correction is on the way now it's hard
[53:02] to pray for the rod of Correction but I
[53:05] can pray Lord I want to be like you and
[53:08] whatever it
[53:12] takes I want to I want to know that I
[53:15] have every Advantage you say what is the
[53:17] most advantageous position you could be
[53:19] in to believe every word of God because
[53:22] if you believe every word of God then
[53:24] all Heaven is behind you and all hell
[53:27] and demons are subject to you and
[53:30] they're all under your
[53:32] feet I would say that's an epic
[53:34] Advantage amen
[53:36] amen John 15:15
[53:39] Noah Jesus speaking here in St John
[53:43] chapter 15 verse 15 henceforth I call
[53:48] you not servants for the servant knoweth
[53:52] not what his Lord doeth but
[53:55] I
[53:57] have called you
[53:59] friends for all things that I have heard
[54:02] of my father I have made known unto you
[54:07] so you know having Jesus as a close
[54:10] friend is a wonderful thing you know the
[54:13] Bible talks about how that Abraham in
[54:15] James chapter 2 Noah James chapter 2
[54:18] verse
[54:19] 23 and the scripture
[54:22] uh wait I'll wait till he till he pulls
[54:25] that up and the scripture was fulfilled
[54:28] which saith Abraham believed God and it
[54:33] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[54:36] and he was called the most ad
[54:38] advantageous thing you could be
[54:41] called what a an
[54:44] advantage to be called the friend of I
[54:48] mean I'm glad if I'm your friend but I'm
[54:50] really glad if I'm his friend
[54:52] amen see because I might do things so AG
[54:56] es to you that you wouldn't want to be
[54:57] my friend anymore but if I do that to
[55:00] him he'll he'll correct me and remain my
[55:03] friend and as long as as long as he's my
[55:07] friend the devil's my
[55:09] enemy right so you don't want to be
[55:13] friends with the world Jesus showed how
[55:16] impossible that friendship with the
[55:18] world does not work for the Kingdom of
[55:21] Heaven it does not work that will put
[55:24] you at an extreme disadvantage because
[55:27] you're following the devil who's lying
[55:29] to
[55:30] you and you're outside of the reliable
[55:35] protection and support of the holy
[55:38] spirit because you're holding hands with
[55:39] the
[55:40] world you're you're I mean you're in a
[55:43] really bad position when you do that so
[55:48] so then we find then that that having
[55:51] faith in God from our scripture here in
[55:53] James
[55:54] 2:23 you notice the context of it that
[55:58] the scripture was fulfilled which saith
[56:00] Abraham believed God all right and it
[56:03] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[56:05] so having faith in God and living a life
[56:09] of righteousness leads to a friendship
[56:13] with God is that easy and I would say to
[56:16] you today that the only kind of friend
[56:19] God has our close
[56:23] friends
[56:24] Rejoice because you're a close friend I
[56:28] got friends and I got close friends you
[56:30] got friends you got we got close friends
[56:31] we got we got acquaintances then we got
[56:34] friends and we got close friends but
[56:36] With God all of his F the ground is
[56:39] level at the foot of the cross and he
[56:41] loves us all equally
[56:44] Hallelujah he loves a faithful listen he
[56:48] loves a faithful housewife as much as he
[56:51] loves a faithful
[56:53] Prophet amen what a beautiful thing you
[56:58] have just as much access to him as as a
[57:02] as a ditch digger as you would if you
[57:04] were a prophet to the ages you you have
[57:07] the ability to lift yourself up into his
[57:10] presence and say father and have a
[57:13] father say yes my
[57:15] child see so there's there's Great
[57:19] Value in knowing Christ as a close
[57:25] friend when we look at Genesis chapter
[57:30] 13 and we we'll catch Genesis 13 and
[57:34] we'll read 14-1 17 this is the Lord
[57:37] speaking to Abraham or Abram at the
[57:40] time Genesis 13:14 and the Lord said
[57:44] unto Abram after that lot was separated
[57:48] from him lift up now Thine Eyes now
[57:52] that's the second time that a that a
[57:55] person does this in recorded in the
[57:58] Bible the first time someone lifted up
[58:01] their
[58:02] eyes they it was lot and Abram said to
[58:06] him look where you'll go and choose and
[58:10] wherever you choose I'll go the opposite
[58:12] direction CU our we we we need to
[58:14] separate and that was God separating out
[58:18] his family to walk alone with him I'm
[58:21] here to tell you something God has an
[58:23] elected family and they are separate
[58:26] from the rest of the world they're
[58:28] separate from the unwise Virgin they're
[58:30] not even that they are they're separate
[58:33] from just good people they're separate
[58:35] from just church people they are the
[58:38] Holy Ghost filled Born Again family of
[58:41] God a gene of God before the foundation
[58:44] of the world the only ability to be
[58:47] fully redeemed and say Amen to every
[58:49] word that's Bible
[58:52] teaching only the predestinated are
[58:55] considered in Redemption
[58:56] God offers a legitimate opportunity for
[58:58] everyone to be saved from destruction
[59:01] that doesn't mean he doesn't have a
[59:03] family whose names were recorded in the
[59:05] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[59:06] foundation of the
[59:09] world and so so we we find that that
[59:14] they are to be separate and and it took
[59:17] Abraham listen it took Abraham a a
[59:20] while and some hardships to finally do
[59:25] that amen God had already told him
[59:28] separate yourself and leave and I'll
[59:32] take you to a place and I'll show you
[59:34] where just leave and I'll show
[59:36] you and when he obeyed the Lord started
[59:40] leading and and SP and kept kept kept
[59:43] with him as soon as Abraham halted first
[59:47] of all he didn't make a clean uh cut he
[59:50] took family with him that were holding
[59:52] him back you know and kin folk that were
[59:54] holding him back and and God was trying
[59:57] to get him to this point right here God
[1:00:00] was trying to get him to Genesis 13 and
[1:00:03] Abraham took a longer than he needed to
[1:00:06] to get there amen see but finally after
[1:00:09] Abraham went through enough
[1:00:12] disadvantage from trying to serve god
[1:00:17] listen trying to serve God but not
[1:00:21] willing to separate himself from
[1:00:24] everything
[1:00:26] and after he went through finally enough
[1:00:28] hardship and and and difficulty and
[1:00:31] disadvantage Abram finally separated
[1:00:34] himself and fact is he never would
[1:00:36] separate himself from one part God had
[1:00:38] to take him home to
[1:00:40] Glory he just wouldn't make the choice
[1:00:43] and sometimes God does that sometimes
[1:00:45] you just won't let something go and God
[1:00:47] has to rip it from you and it
[1:00:50] hurts but he
[1:00:52] will and then finally it got to the
[1:00:55] point where he has to separate from the
[1:00:57] last vestage of connection now he's
[1:00:59] still he's still in a close association
[1:01:03] with a type of the unwise Virgin lot
[1:01:06] lot's a righteous man but lot's not the
[1:01:10] part of the elected he's never going to
[1:01:11] get Abraham's promise he's going to get
[1:01:13] a promise he's going to get God's going
[1:01:14] to take care of him God's got something
[1:01:17] for him God's got something for the
[1:01:19] they're all virgins whether they're wise
[1:01:21] or unwise you're never going to make the
[1:01:23] unwise Virgin the Harlot Daughters of
[1:01:25] the Book of Revelation they're not
[1:01:26] they're virgins unto God but they never
[1:01:29] get the Holy Ghost they never get born
[1:01:31] again they they never can quite see
[1:01:34] completely the message of the hour of
[1:01:36] any hour they've been in every age
[1:01:38] there's always been a Remnant uh and and
[1:01:40] God has a place for them and they'll be
[1:01:42] in heaven but they that's that's
[1:01:44] different than living in the Royal City
[1:01:46] and being part of the royal
[1:01:50] family I'll take it but I'd much rather
[1:01:53] be where I'm
[1:01:54] at it's an
[1:01:57] advantage so so we find that finally
[1:02:01] he's willing to separate and now the
[1:02:03] first time these words got said he
[1:02:06] lifted up his eyes was when Abra Abram
[1:02:09] offered him to say you choose which way
[1:02:11] you'll go and here is where that
[1:02:13] righteous man showed his exact colors he
[1:02:17] the Bible says he lifted up his eyes
[1:02:19] first time in the scripture he lifted up
[1:02:21] his eyes and he looked toward the what
[1:02:24] he thought was an advantage the fertile
[1:02:26] Plains looked toward Sodom he looked
[1:02:30] toward that Metropolis that Cosmopolitan
[1:02:33] City he looked toward that that that
[1:02:37] modern version you know where where he
[1:02:40] could actually intermingle to the degree
[1:02:43] that he became like a mayor of the city
[1:02:44] and became a judge and sat in the gate
[1:02:46] and judged people became accepted in
[1:02:49] high society and his wife was a society
[1:02:51] woman cost her her
[1:02:53] life cost her her life that was a that
[1:02:56] would that was a hard lesson for brother
[1:03:00] lot because he had to there was no way
[1:03:03] to escape feeling
[1:03:05] responsible that that all of his family
[1:03:08] didn't get out and even his wife didn't
[1:03:10] make it out see and that that's hard on
[1:03:13] a father and on a husband when you when
[1:03:15] you have to uh face the music on that
[1:03:18] and I I don't wish that upon anybody but
[1:03:20] his mistake was he lifted up his eyes
[1:03:23] and looked toward what he thought was an
[1:03:25] advant vage which was actually a
[1:03:28] disadvantage and then once that was done
[1:03:31] now the Lord said to Abram now lift up
[1:03:34] your eyes now now the beauty of it is is
[1:03:38] because that Abram had stayed separated
[1:03:41] and had not made that choice to go down
[1:03:44] there then God is simply saying to him
[1:03:48] lift up now thine eyes and look from the
[1:03:51] place where thou Thou Art northward and
[1:03:54] Southward and Eastward and Westward for
[1:03:57] all the land which thou seest to thee
[1:03:59] will I give it and to thy seed forever
[1:04:03] and I will make thy seed as the dust of
[1:04:05] the earth so that if any man could
[1:04:07] number the dust of the earth so shall
[1:04:08] thy seed also be numbered now this is
[1:04:11] not just going to be Israelites in the
[1:04:15] natural this is going to be the family
[1:04:18] of God spiritually Jew Gentile both
[1:04:22] sides of it Hallelujah Bond free male
[1:04:25] female is are all going to be the
[1:04:27] firstborn of the family of God they're
[1:04:30] all going to be priests and kings and
[1:04:32] and of the increase of his kingdom there
[1:04:34] shall be no end I'm telling you
[1:04:36] something friends we got some Advantage
[1:04:42] coming arise see now this is the beauty
[1:04:46] of it once Abram had finally hear me
[1:04:51] once Abram finally got tired of the of
[1:04:55] the things God had to do to get him to
[1:04:58] separate everything and he actually did
[1:05:00] it then Abraham didn't have to Abraham
[1:05:04] didn't have to even figure out his
[1:05:06] future God said all I need you to do is
[1:05:09] look in every direction everything
[1:05:12] around you that you can see is
[1:05:14] yours I created I built it and I'm
[1:05:17] deeding it to you and to your family
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:23] forever arise verse 7
[1:05:26] walk through the land now brother bradam
[1:05:29] taught us in a trumpet giving an
[1:05:31] uncertain sound he taught us that
[1:05:33] footsteps means possession I'm going to
[1:05:36] read it here in a moment so he says
[1:05:39] arise walk through the land in the
[1:05:43] length of it and in the breadth of it
[1:05:46] for I will give it unto thee so brother
[1:05:49] brandham picks this up in in now the now
[1:05:54] the next time let me let me let me let
[1:05:56] me give you this first then that's what
[1:05:59] he says to
[1:06:00] Abram walk through it then he comes to
[1:06:04] Deuteronomy chap
[1:06:06] 11 and verse 24 single verse Deuteronomy
[1:06:13] 1124 every place wherein The Souls of
[1:06:18] your feet first time that phrase is used
[1:06:21] The Souls of your
[1:06:23] feet he said every Place whereon The
[1:06:26] Souls of your feet shall tread speaking
[1:06:30] to Moses to the children of Israel shall
[1:06:32] be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon
[1:06:36] from the river the river Euphrates even
[1:06:38] unto the uttermost sea shall be your
[1:06:42] Coast all right now now we go to Joshua
[1:06:46] chapter
[1:06:47] 1 Joshua chapter 1 verse three here it
[1:06:53] is again second time it's in the script
[1:06:55] scripture every place that the soul of
[1:06:59] your foot shall tread upon that have I
[1:07:02] given unto you as I said unto Moses and
[1:07:05] he said it unto Moses in Deuteronomy 11
[1:07:08] and he had before he had said it to
[1:07:11] Joshua he said it to Moses and before he
[1:07:14] said it to Moses he' said it to Abraham
[1:07:17] see so so Moses then brought the first
[1:07:22] Exodus right he brought them out of of
[1:07:25] Egypt and then Joshua which was a type
[1:07:29] of the Holy Ghost took them into the
[1:07:32] promised land to possess it they didn't
[1:07:35] go in there to hang out they went in
[1:07:37] there to possess it that's right why
[1:07:40] what what what audacity there were
[1:07:42] people already living there right but
[1:07:44] God had already been warning them you
[1:07:47] need to clear out because this land is
[1:07:50] already titled and deeded to my people
[1:07:53] and they've sojourned for 4 UND years
[1:07:56] but they're coming
[1:07:57] home and you either get out or you'll be
[1:08:01] driven out or you'll be destroyed and so
[1:08:04] we find that when Moses brings them out
[1:08:07] and Pharaoh tried to stop him and that
[1:08:09] didn't work and then the Holy Ghost
[1:08:11] under Joshua took them into the promised
[1:08:14] land to possess it and it began now
[1:08:17] listen this
[1:08:20] possession which look like a complete
[1:08:23] Advantage you're being given the
[1:08:25] Promised Land would you call that an
[1:08:29] advantage but it began with possessing
[1:08:33] the Gate of the enemy under
[1:08:36] Joshua so now you say wait a minute I
[1:08:39] thought I thought this was pure
[1:08:41] Advantage It is Well then why do we got
[1:08:43] to fight because that's the way God has
[1:08:46] it for you in this life and you God
[1:08:50] brought you out of the world and God
[1:08:52] brought you into the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:54] you're headed for a millennium but
[1:08:55] you're here to fight you're not here for
[1:08:57] a picnic you're here to fight you're
[1:09:00] here to prove God's word you're here to
[1:09:02] prove the devil's a liar that's why I'm
[1:09:04] a Christian that's why you have the
[1:09:07] advantage of the Holy Ghost so that you
[1:09:10] have weapons of of warfare and those
[1:09:12] weapons are Mighty to the pulling down
[1:09:14] of
[1:09:16] strongholds so we find that literally
[1:09:21] they've got to possess the Gate of the
[1:09:23] enemy and that that begins under Joshua
[1:09:26] and it ends with Solomon because in
[1:09:29] Solomon's day all the enemies were
[1:09:32] conquered all the land was taken
[1:09:35] everything was under his feet his very
[1:09:37] name meant peace he's the son of David
[1:09:40] and that's a type of Christ in the
[1:09:42] Millennium and so I'm here to tell you
[1:09:45] from The Upper Room experience to the
[1:09:48] millennial rain Hallelujah we are
[1:09:51] possessing the Gate of the enemy
[1:09:56] amen amen see we're all the children of
[1:09:59] Abraham today and we're still taking the
[1:10:03] land and taking every enemy until the
[1:10:07] kingdoms of this world have become the
[1:10:10] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[1:10:13] oh there's Great Value in knowing Christ
[1:10:17] as a close
[1:10:20] friend there's great
[1:10:22] advantage in knowing him in this way
[1:10:27] you are carrying on that today you are
[1:10:30] brother and I want to give you that
[1:10:31] quote brother I promised it to you
[1:10:33] trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother
[1:10:34] brandom says God told Joshua every place
[1:10:37] The Souls of your foot Treads upon that
[1:10:41] I give you so footsteps meant possession
[1:10:45] so from the very earliest time God said
[1:10:50] to Abram walk through it amen don't just
[1:10:56] stand here and look at it don't just
[1:10:59] talk about it and read about it walk
[1:11:02] through it Abram I'm teaching you a
[1:11:05] lesson footsteps mean possession I'm
[1:11:09] giving it to you but you're only going
[1:11:10] to get an advantage when you go take it
[1:11:14] and you might have to fight cuz there's
[1:11:16] enemies but go take it the advantage
[1:11:19] Joshua had was the captain of the Lord's
[1:11:23] host was among them
[1:11:26] that was an advantage never has an army
[1:11:28] had that kind of Advantage where they
[1:11:30] said you're going to have Supernatural
[1:11:33] power so much so that every enemy will
[1:11:35] be destroyed and you won't even lose a
[1:11:38] soldier you won't need a field Hospital
[1:11:40] you won't need a medic first Army never
[1:11:42] needed a
[1:11:44] medic now they end up needing a medic
[1:11:47] and and a mortician because they failed
[1:11:49] to keep God's word and 30 some odd of
[1:11:52] them perished and the after taking
[1:11:54] Jericho oh a little bitty city AI it was
[1:11:58] more than 30 men trying to do that see
[1:12:00] because when you're walking through the
[1:12:03] land you're not here to just to just you
[1:12:07] know we're not here to just have so
[1:12:09] everything oh a little Jubilee there
[1:12:12] there's Jubilee after the
[1:12:14] fighting there's Jubilee after the
[1:12:16] victory say how do I know I have the
[1:12:18] victory I promise you you'll have the
[1:12:19] victory if you'll fight the right
[1:12:22] way
[1:12:23] see so we find then that we are no
[1:12:27] wonder we're the children of Abraham
[1:12:30] today that's part of why because we're
[1:12:33] walking through the land of the word
[1:12:37] possessing the Gate of the
[1:12:39] enemy see so there's Great Value in
[1:12:44] knowing Christ as a close
[1:12:47] friend he's The Sovereign
[1:12:50] ruler of a great Kingdom there's an
[1:12:54] advantage yeah and knowing a sovereign
[1:12:56] ruler of a great Kingdom not only is he
[1:13:00] a sovereign ruler of a great Kingdom but
[1:13:03] he actually wants to share he wants to
[1:13:06] share that Kingdom with all of his
[1:13:10] family and
[1:13:11] friends he says to his disciples I don't
[1:13:13] call you servants anymore because a
[1:13:15] servant doesn't really know what his
[1:13:16] master's doing the servant doesn't
[1:13:18] really he's not on the inside he's not
[1:13:20] privy but but but the master tells his
[1:13:23] friends things that he would never tell
[1:13:24] the ser so Jesus said I'm not going to
[1:13:26] call you servants anymore because I have
[1:13:28] told you everything my father I've given
[1:13:31] you the most Insider secrets of the
[1:13:34] Kingdom say why are you doing that to
[1:13:36] empower you to believe God like I do
[1:13:39] that's what that's why Jesus did it see
[1:13:42] and so he wants to share it with his
[1:13:45] family and with his friends you know I I
[1:13:49] I would a lot of lot of times and boy I
[1:13:52] have to be so careful
[1:13:54] here
[1:13:56] so you you you know okay first let me
[1:13:59] say nobody's done this to
[1:14:02] me okay and I just had a big family
[1:14:05] shindig last night they definitely
[1:14:07] haven't done this to me although we have
[1:14:09] a running joke about well I going to go
[1:14:11] into Family Jokes but but let me just
[1:14:14] say this has not happened to me by
[1:14:17] anybody uh here today uh or that I can
[1:14:22] think
[1:14:24] of
[1:14:26] but the but the Bible talks about not to
[1:14:28] weary your neighbor with your often
[1:14:32] coming
[1:14:36] see but that's a scripture you know so
[1:14:40] so there's all there's always balance
[1:14:42] and so but you know the Lord wants to
[1:14:46] share his
[1:14:48] kingdom with his family and with his
[1:14:52] friends and he wants everybody to come
[1:14:54] over
[1:14:57] all the
[1:14:58] time Rejoice that's an advantage this
[1:15:02] great Monarch this great king this great
[1:15:06] Sovereign of this great Kingdom wants
[1:15:09] everybody to come over come over any
[1:15:12] time he's always up he doesn't sleep
[1:15:16] he's never tired you know we have a we
[1:15:19] have a lot of sayings here in the South
[1:15:20] they all mean the same thing y'all come
[1:15:22] see us or sometimes it gets shortened
[1:15:24] y'all come and people in the north go
[1:15:27] what does that mean what does that even
[1:15:28] mean like oh it's I'm sorry it's a
[1:15:29] southern way of saying come see us you
[1:15:31] know and so you know so so the a lot of
[1:15:35] times in the South you know when we'd
[1:15:37] leave you know friends or family I grew
[1:15:39] up hearing that kind of language hey
[1:15:40] y'all come see us and we're we're there
[1:15:42] now we're just leaving and they're
[1:15:44] already saying y'all come back you know
[1:15:46] and so that's kind of a southern way I'm
[1:15:48] here to tell you that he wants everybody
[1:15:50] over all the time he doesn't sleep he's
[1:15:52] always up and and and that means that
[1:15:56] means that he's instant in season and
[1:16:00] out of season he but the Bible says he's
[1:16:04] a very present help in time of trouble
[1:16:07] now that's great because since since
[1:16:09] since job has said that a man born of a
[1:16:12] woman is full of trouble I'm glad he's a
[1:16:16] present help in trouble I have an
[1:16:19] advantage because I have a friend in
[1:16:22] Jesus what a friend we have have in
[1:16:27] Jesus all our sins and griefs to bear so
[1:16:32] we find then that Hebrews 13 watch this
[1:16:36] now Hebrews
[1:16:40] 135 Paul speaking to his own countrymen
[1:16:44] the Hebrews Hebrews 13:5 keep your
[1:16:49] lives uh well that's I've actually got a
[1:16:52] different translation Noah give me the
[1:16:53] uh King James version so I'll read it
[1:16:55] read it from there Hebrews 13:5 let your
[1:16:59] conversation be without
[1:17:02] covetousness and be content with such
[1:17:04] things as you have for he hath said I
[1:17:09] will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:17:13] so in this translation I have here I
[1:17:16] don't have it noted which one it is but
[1:17:17] it says keep your lives free from and
[1:17:21] there because it says keep your lives
[1:17:23] free from the Love of Money and be
[1:17:25] content but I don't want to I just don't
[1:17:27] I don't want to cabbage down on on the
[1:17:29] love of money and riches there not
[1:17:32] there's there's nothing wrong with that
[1:17:34] per se it's the love of it see it it's
[1:17:37] trying to get an advantage when actually
[1:17:39] often times many men James said have
[1:17:42] pierced themselves through with riches
[1:17:45] I've seen that happen so many times
[1:17:47] people who just their Church their
[1:17:49] Church schedule was so regular their
[1:17:51] prayer life was so regular they were
[1:17:53] living in the tape they were always in
[1:17:55] their Bible they weren't just religious
[1:17:57] they were
[1:17:58] spiritual and then a career change come
[1:18:01] along and the next thing you know they
[1:18:03] come to church half the time pray about
[1:18:05] a third of the time read their Bible you
[1:18:08] hope and maybe hear a tape and you can
[1:18:10] see the effect in their lives are they
[1:18:12] God's children yeah but they're not
[1:18:13] living to the advantage of the
[1:18:16] word they're piercing themselves through
[1:18:19] with what they thought was an
[1:18:22] advantage and it wasn't
[1:18:25] so so the point is I'm keying on these
[1:18:28] two words keep your lives free from amen
[1:18:34] from what anything that makes you have a
[1:18:36] disadvantage from having the
[1:18:39] advantage it says he the Love of Money
[1:18:41] be content with what you have because
[1:18:43] God has said here's the beauty here's
[1:18:45] why you can do here's the advantage of
[1:18:48] letting God orchestrate your life and
[1:18:50] not chasing the American dream God has
[1:18:53] said never will I leave you never will I
[1:18:56] forsake
[1:18:58] you so what are you
[1:19:02] chasing what are you running after why
[1:19:04] are you why are you trying to win the
[1:19:06] rat race and still be a
[1:19:08] rat see what a disadvantage what a trick
[1:19:12] the devil is playing on God's family so
[1:19:14] I'm here to tell you keep your lives
[1:19:17] free from free from the things free from
[1:19:21] the things that are not of the truth
[1:19:24] tree of
[1:19:27] life now I I I get I I I certainly get
[1:19:31] give me First Corinthians 713 bubs 1
[1:19:35] Corinthians
[1:19:36] 7:13 I'm sorry 1 Corinthians
[1:19:41] 7:31 and they that use this
[1:19:45] world as not abusing it for the fashion
[1:19:49] of this world passeth away 1 Corinthians
[1:19:53] 7:31
[1:19:56] I want everybody to read it with me so
[1:19:57] we're just going wait a second they that
[1:19:59] use this world as not abusing it the new
[1:20:01] King James says misusing it same thing
[1:20:05] and they that use this world as not
[1:20:07] misusing it for the fashion of this
[1:20:09] world passes the way I'll leave that
[1:20:11] there for a second Noah so I'm going to
[1:20:14] give you two other versions of it I'm
[1:20:16] going to give you from the ESV and those
[1:20:19] who deal with the world as though they
[1:20:22] had no dealings with the world
[1:20:25] from the whis translation and those who
[1:20:27] are making use of this world the things
[1:20:29] of human existence as not making
[1:20:31] excessive use of the same for the
[1:20:34] temporary fashion of this world is
[1:20:35] passing away so the Bible understands
[1:20:38] the Apostle Paul understands you live
[1:20:41] here and it understands that there are
[1:20:44] items that come from the Tree of
[1:20:46] knowledge of Good and Evil the tree of
[1:20:49] knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree
[1:20:51] of knowledge of good and the tree of
[1:20:53] knowledge of good the tree of knowledge
[1:20:55] of Good and
[1:20:56] Evil so we do live here you've got a
[1:20:59] we've got parking lots on both sides
[1:21:01] filled with fruit from the Tree of
[1:21:04] knowledge you understand so he he's not
[1:21:08] he's not he's not trying to say oh go
[1:21:11] live in a
[1:21:12] commune you know just go go go live in
[1:21:15] the wilderness somewhere but he's saying
[1:21:18] while you live here yeah you do live
[1:21:20] here but don't live here like you live
[1:21:23] here live here like you're passing
[1:21:25] through
[1:21:26] here I'm going to tell you something
[1:21:28] friends this world is not my home I'm
[1:21:32] just passing
[1:21:35] through and that informs my thinking of
[1:21:37] what I chase after and how hard I go
[1:21:39] after trying to get it
[1:21:42] see so keep yourselves free from
[1:21:46] whatever you're chasing in life whatever
[1:21:48] you have to en encounter in the tree of
[1:21:52] knowledge of Good and Evil just remember
[1:21:54] you might use it but don't abuse it or
[1:21:57] or or could I say it this way don't let
[1:21:59] it abuse you don't you misuse it and it
[1:22:02] won't misuse you understand see it for
[1:22:05] what it
[1:22:06] is see so there so there's something
[1:22:10] then to be said uh for not being overly
[1:22:14] attached to this life there there
[1:22:17] there's something we're going to go to
[1:22:18] Colossians 3 no get ready for that
[1:22:21] Colossians 3 and I'll give you the
[1:22:24] verses in just in a
[1:22:26] minute so there's something to be said
[1:22:29] about not being overly attached to this
[1:22:33] life you
[1:22:35] know I could say Holding On Loosely
[1:22:39] there are things in this life that are
[1:22:41] dear and precious and there's nothing
[1:22:43] wrong with holding the things that you
[1:22:46] love that are wholesome that are to your
[1:22:47] advantage that are based on the word of
[1:22:49] God you want to hold on to that very
[1:22:51] tightly but you just want to live in the
[1:22:54] world you young people you're in school
[1:22:57] you're you're going to have careers just
[1:23:00] understand what Paul is saying this
[1:23:02] world is passing away amen you can't
[1:23:07] stay here it's like a house burning down
[1:23:11] and you're you're sitting stubbornly in
[1:23:14] your rocking chair and the house is
[1:23:15] burning down around you and the fireman
[1:23:18] is in your face screaming you got to get
[1:23:23] out you can't stay
[1:23:26] here it's burning down and just bear
[1:23:29] that in mind friends that you you need
[1:23:32] to start thinking about there and not so
[1:23:37] much about here see so Colossians 3
[1:23:41] addresses that chapter 3 verses let's
[1:23:44] read uh verse
[1:23:47] two set your affection on University and
[1:23:52] a new
[1:23:53] job
[1:23:57] now it's not a Prohibition to University
[1:23:59] in a new job it's not prohibiting it
[1:24:02] it's it's asking you where's your heart
[1:24:04] where are your affections what do you
[1:24:06] see that as you know it doesn't say you
[1:24:10] know don't have those things it's asking
[1:24:13] you where your heart is set your
[1:24:15] affections on things above not on things
[1:24:18] of the earth you do live here you do use
[1:24:22] it but don't misuse it see second Peter
[1:24:27] uh yeah second Peter brother Noah
[1:24:30] chapter
[1:24:32] 3 and we'll catch verses um 11 to 12 is
[1:24:37] this okay all
[1:24:41] right second Peter 3: 11 and 12 seeing
[1:24:45] then that all these things shall be
[1:24:49] dissolved here's a very good
[1:24:52] question what manner of person are ought
[1:24:54] ye to
[1:24:55] be in all holy conversation and
[1:24:59] godliness looking for and hastening to
[1:25:03] my next pay
[1:25:08] raise it's amusing isn't
[1:25:11] it it's on purpose I'm I'm being amusing
[1:25:14] on purpose I'm trying to draw contrast
[1:25:16] trying to get you to actually go wait a
[1:25:18] minute no it brother Jason didn't say
[1:25:20] that looking for and hastening unto the
[1:25:23] coming of the day of
[1:25:25] God looking for and hastening so this
[1:25:29] means this is where your activity is
[1:25:31] this is where your heart is this is
[1:25:32] where your mindset is you do live here
[1:25:35] that's true we when Paul told you know I
[1:25:37] think it was the I believe uh I want to
[1:25:40] say the Thessalonian Church how that
[1:25:42] they you know should live separate from
[1:25:44] the world they wrote him up they wrote
[1:25:45] him back because Paul in his second
[1:25:47] later says now as you wrote unto me
[1:25:50] asking because you you took off on my
[1:25:52] comment where I said don't be a part of
[1:25:54] the world and you wrote back and said
[1:25:55] Paul what do you mean we have jobs we
[1:25:57] have careers we're in school we got kids
[1:25:59] what to go live in a commune and Paul
[1:26:01] writes back in his second later saying
[1:26:03] no what I meant was you live in the
[1:26:05] world but you don't abuse the world you
[1:26:07] don't you don't you don't let it
[1:26:09] manipulate you Paul said it like this he
[1:26:11] said I mean if you were going to obey
[1:26:13] what I said literally you'd have to go
[1:26:15] out of the
[1:26:16] world and some day we're going to go out
[1:26:19] of this world and but right now right
[1:26:22] now I'm here right now I'm conquering
[1:26:25] right now I'm fighting right now right
[1:26:27] now I'm pressing the mark right now I'm
[1:26:30] pressing the battle I'm Conquering the
[1:26:32] enemy see so so Peter just like here
[1:26:37] Peter is not suggesting you know that we
[1:26:40] live in fear he talks about hastening
[1:26:41] under the coming of the day of God and
[1:26:43] he goes off into some very ominous
[1:26:44] language he's not suggesting that we
[1:26:46] live in fear he's trying to get us to
[1:26:49] understand what a small window of
[1:26:52] existence this life is amen it is so
[1:26:56] small so short especially compared to
[1:27:00] Eternity I've showed you many times
[1:27:03] we've talked about this recently
[1:27:04] numerous times about you've got if
[1:27:08] you've got a promise 70 years that's
[1:27:10] 3652 weeks you're done so what are you
[1:27:14] chasing see it's it's just a little over
[1:27:17] 3600 weeks for 70 years and you're
[1:27:20] out so this life is like not even that
[1:27:24] that not even that compared to what's
[1:27:28] coming so Peter is not trying to get us
[1:27:30] to live in fear he's trying to get us to
[1:27:33] understand the that what this life this
[1:27:35] Fallen life really is because what is
[1:27:39] your life as we heard uh I believe
[1:27:41] brother Chris uh preaching here when he
[1:27:44] was here uh the other service what is
[1:27:46] your life it's just a
[1:27:48] vapor it's one little blip on the radar
[1:27:51] and and and and little more than that
[1:27:54] yeah no matter how much you think of it
[1:27:56] it's just little more than a blip on the
[1:27:58] radar see and so its purpose is
[1:28:02] singularly for God to fulfill his Plan
[1:28:05] of Redemption in Saving you and then to
[1:28:08] express his attributes through you
[1:28:10] because you're now a born again vessel
[1:28:12] full of the Holy Spirit and the love of
[1:28:16] God is shed abroad to the world through
[1:28:19] youen see amen so First Peter chapter
[1:28:24] 5 and verse 7 here's a beautiful
[1:28:28] scripture 1 Peter chap 5 verse S casting
[1:28:34] all your care upon him for he carth for
[1:28:41] you that that should be such a
[1:28:44] comforting scripture to us today you
[1:28:47] want an advantage how many want an
[1:28:49] advantage I'm going to give you a life
[1:28:51] tip cast all your care upon him
[1:28:54] amen that'll serve you way better than
[1:28:57] any stock market tip I could give you or
[1:29:00] any trade I could teach you or any words
[1:29:03] of wisdom I could say the best thing
[1:29:05] that you could ever do in this life is
[1:29:07] find yourself in a position to be
[1:29:09] friends with God so you can cast your
[1:29:12] care upon him for he carth for you
[1:29:15] Psalms
[1:29:17] 461 Psalms 461 God is our refuge and I
[1:29:22] want you to notice the two words
[1:29:24] together God is our refuge and strength
[1:29:28] see so we go to him for trouble but it's
[1:29:31] all it's also where we abide because he
[1:29:33] is not only he's not just here to help
[1:29:36] you he's here to sustain you see he's
[1:29:39] our refuge and our strength he's a very
[1:29:41] present help in trouble so look to him
[1:29:44] for all
[1:29:45] things look to him for all things and
[1:29:48] abide in him it's just like it's just
[1:29:50] like in marriage when we when we have
[1:29:52] the vow to have and to hold
[1:29:54] that's the same thing a refuge and
[1:29:56] strength it's it's it's it's provision
[1:30:01] and it's abiding it's to have to hold
[1:30:04] that's where the whole term of
[1:30:05] cherishing you've heard me talk about
[1:30:07] the The Vow that gets broken the soonest
[1:30:09] is is the vow to cherish and that that a
[1:30:12] lot of times in marriage ceremonies that
[1:30:14] word cherish is not even in the vows but
[1:30:15] it's it's contained in the meaning of to
[1:30:18] having to hold see so I'm not just
[1:30:20] marrying this person but this person is
[1:30:22] going to belong to me and I'm going to
[1:30:24] belong to them and I'm going to hold on
[1:30:26] to them and they're going to hold on to
[1:30:28] me and it's going to sustain me so it's
[1:30:30] it's an advantage on both sides and you
[1:30:32] you don't want to to let things happen
[1:30:34] in a marriage that break that apart say
[1:30:38] well we're still married yeah but you're
[1:30:39] at a disadvantage see you're at a
[1:30:42] disadvantage when you let the things of
[1:30:45] the world come between you and Christ
[1:30:48] there's no simpler way to say it you are
[1:30:50] a you are living in a disadvantage when
[1:30:53] you do that
[1:30:55] see so when we read our text today let's
[1:30:59] go back and take a look at our original
[1:31:00] text Noah in Proverbs chapter
[1:31:03] 3 because we're talking about God's
[1:31:06] guidance and God's wisdom in Proverbs
[1:31:09] chapter three verse
[1:31:12] 5 and and six trust in the Lord with all
[1:31:18] thine
[1:31:19] heart and lean not unto thy own
[1:31:22] understanding we didn't read that from
[1:31:23] my text I yeah we read Proverbs right
[1:31:26] okay we read Proverbs 3 okay correct all
[1:31:29] right let me get back to my spot
[1:31:32] here all right so so Pro again Proverbs
[1:31:35] 35 and 6 trust in the Lord with all your
[1:31:38] heart and lean not to your own
[1:31:41] understanding and all your ways submit
[1:31:44] to him and he will make he shall direct
[1:31:49] thy paths another version says he shall
[1:31:51] make your paths straight
[1:31:54] you
[1:31:55] know this King that we're speaking of
[1:32:00] this wonderful king of this wonderful
[1:32:04] Kingdom the Lord Jesus Christ he's very
[1:32:07] much unlike uh arrogant monarchs that we
[1:32:11] have seen down through history who tend
[1:32:14] to make you gravel first and you know uh
[1:32:17] before you can even approach them you
[1:32:18] have to gravel and you have to crawl and
[1:32:20] they do it all just to boost their own
[1:32:22] ego and their own arrogance you know I I
[1:32:24] when I read about ancient Kings doing
[1:32:27] humans that way I just think my goodness
[1:32:30] if I'd have been standing there I'd have
[1:32:31] probably lived about two seconds
[1:32:33] because I would have said what what do
[1:32:35] you you think like you H you put the
[1:32:38] breath in your lungs sir you think you
[1:32:40] can keep it there you think you're in
[1:32:42] control you think you won't they won't
[1:32:44] even find a spoonful of your ashes a
[1:32:46] thousand years from
[1:32:48] now you know sometimes people just need
[1:32:50] a reality check I'm sorry but this is
[1:32:53] what it is if you don't have eternal
[1:32:55] life your life is just that and then
[1:32:58] later you're just a spoon of Ashes
[1:33:01] there's there's there's more material in
[1:33:03] your grave marker than
[1:33:06] you amen there there's more material in
[1:33:10] some of the the things that they put up
[1:33:12] over people's tombs than the person what
[1:33:15] good is the person what good was their
[1:33:17] life if you don't have eternal life life
[1:33:19] is so beautiful and so wonderful that I
[1:33:22] mean if I don't get to live for forever
[1:33:24] then it's like wow invite me to a seven
[1:33:26] course meal and tell me and let me see
[1:33:27] it and smell it I don't get to eat it I
[1:33:30] mean why' I even have life if I don't
[1:33:31] have eternal life for me friends it's
[1:33:33] heaven or
[1:33:34] nothing I'm going all the way I'm
[1:33:37] serious about this I want to be there I
[1:33:40] want to live with him
[1:33:42] forever this life is too short too hard
[1:33:45] there's too many trials it's not worth
[1:33:46] it life a man born of a woman is a few
[1:33:49] days and full of trouble and comes to
[1:33:52] nothing your life is Vapor a blip on a
[1:33:55] radar oh but if you have eternal
[1:33:59] life
[1:34:01] see so these arrogant Kings you know
[1:34:04] King Jesus does not require any of that
[1:34:08] I want to say to you today that he is
[1:34:11] the kind of King who doesn't need any
[1:34:12] buttering
[1:34:14] up he doesn't need any coaxing he
[1:34:17] doesn't need you to work anything up he
[1:34:19] doesn't need you to jump up and down and
[1:34:20] throw dirt in the air to get his
[1:34:22] attention he's always always awake he's
[1:34:24] always listening he's always full of
[1:34:27] love he's always ready to hear a prayer
[1:34:30] he's all now he's ready he's ready to
[1:34:32] hear a prayer of repentance amen so so
[1:34:35] so we find that he's not he's not a
[1:34:37] pushover I want to say that he's not a
[1:34:41] pushover he's not right for abuse you've
[1:34:44] heard me say uh many times maybe if
[1:34:47] you're a visitor here are listening on
[1:34:48] the internet you've never heard this my
[1:34:49] church has heard me say it over the
[1:34:50] years many many many times you don't
[1:34:53] he's not Santa Claus he's not Santa so
[1:34:56] you don't just give him a wish list he's
[1:34:58] just Santa he's and you've heard me talk
[1:35:00] about that he he's not Social Services
[1:35:03] he's not a vending machine he he's not a
[1:35:05] god of convenience now brother branham's
[1:35:08] language was he's not a doie
[1:35:10] grandpa I can't use that one because I
[1:35:12] am one of those but but God is not like
[1:35:16] that he's not a doie grandpa he's not a
[1:35:18] pushover he's he he he Jesus Jesus has a
[1:35:23] very generous Spirit but he also has a
[1:35:26] royal
[1:35:27] heart he knows who he is see he he has a
[1:35:32] very generous Spirit but he has a royal
[1:35:34] heart he is a king I realize you know
[1:35:38] say well the lowly Nazar sure he took
[1:35:41] the form the Bible says he took the form
[1:35:43] of a servant and he moved in the earth
[1:35:47] and he moved while he was in the earth
[1:35:48] he moved as a lowly Nazarene he did that
[1:35:52] for a season see
[1:35:54] but but but he rejects today this King
[1:35:58] rejects all dictation he's not going to
[1:36:01] be dictated to he maintains his
[1:36:03] sovereignty in all action and I'm here
[1:36:06] to tell the world yes he was a lowely
[1:36:09] Nazarene yes he took the form of a
[1:36:11] servant yes he laid his own life down
[1:36:14] you didn't take it from him but I'm here
[1:36:16] to tell you he is a king and you're not
[1:36:19] going to crucify him again you're not
[1:36:22] going to take up B to Stone him for
[1:36:24] declaring the true word you're not going
[1:36:27] to arrest him in a garden because you
[1:36:28] don't like his teaching those days are
[1:36:31] over that time is passed and that window
[1:36:34] is closed Romans 6:9 says knowing that
[1:36:38] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[1:36:41] no more death hath no more dominion over
[1:36:44] him I'm here to tell you friends the
[1:36:46] next time unbelievers stand before him
[1:36:49] they'll be bowing the knee and they'll
[1:36:52] be begging for mercy
[1:36:56] he's a real person he's a real king he's
[1:37:00] a he he has a real personality
[1:37:04] listen let let me let me turn change
[1:37:07] gears and turn a corner and head for the
[1:37:09] Finish Line I'm running out of
[1:37:12] time his
[1:37:15] Humanity when God became a human and
[1:37:18] walked among us as one of
[1:37:20] us it gave him it gave him every
[1:37:26] Advantage you would
[1:37:29] need see because that he was a real
[1:37:33] person with real emotions Jesus had tons
[1:37:37] of
[1:37:38] emotions he was a human Jesus had tons
[1:37:42] of feelings he invented
[1:37:45] them
[1:37:46] amen so emotions and feelings he
[1:37:49] invented
[1:37:50] them he he he was not a robot he was was
[1:37:53] not he was the Bible says he filled with
[1:37:56] compassion for the people so he had lots
[1:38:00] of emotions he had lots of feelings but
[1:38:04] he but his emotions and his feelings
[1:38:08] were always in
[1:38:10] control you've heard me say before that
[1:38:14] he do he the the the that the Holy
[1:38:17] Spirit never wakes up on the wrong side
[1:38:19] of the bed like we
[1:38:22] do look at your neighbor and say we
[1:38:24] don't say you say we
[1:38:28] do men were afraid to do that to their
[1:38:30] wives but he never wakes up on the wrong
[1:38:33] side of the bed he never has a bad mood
[1:38:36] see but here's the ad here's the
[1:38:39] advantage he's not
[1:38:41] inhibited in his
[1:38:43] Relationships by
[1:38:46] complexes so he's he's never
[1:38:50] complexed he he could have been
[1:38:54] he had all kinds of emotions he had all
[1:38:56] kinds of hurts but but he Jesus human
[1:39:00] beings have this fantastic ability to to
[1:39:04] live in the past and feel hurts and
[1:39:08] pains that are long ago
[1:39:11] gone humans are amazing at that to live
[1:39:15] in places of pain and and and
[1:39:18] disadvantage that are long ago gone and
[1:39:22] they're still living there
[1:39:24] bound trapped by that their emotions
[1:39:28] inhibited they you know I I'm so glad
[1:39:30] that he's not locked up he's not he's
[1:39:33] never unable to express his love
[1:39:36] sometimes that happens in marriages
[1:39:38] people husbands can't this happened or
[1:39:40] wife and this happened or people under a
[1:39:42] certain preacher and this happened let
[1:39:43] it
[1:39:44] go let it go I'm here to tell you Jesus
[1:39:47] already experienced and got the victory
[1:39:50] on that for you and you can live under
[1:39:52] the under the blessing under the
[1:39:55] advantage of Freedom
[1:39:56] today he's loving he's kind he's full of
[1:40:00] compassion he has supreme power he
[1:40:04] Soares of everything the devil ever
[1:40:07] tries to bring upon him he Soares right
[1:40:11] over the devil and if you have him in
[1:40:14] your life so can
[1:40:17] you in fact is I would say to you
[1:40:20] today that this is part of the high call
[1:40:24] calling this is part of the high calling
[1:40:27] not just to clean your life up and live
[1:40:28] a Sanctified life but to set your
[1:40:31] affections which the devil wants to trap
[1:40:34] up take them off the world and put them
[1:40:35] up on
[1:40:37] heaven let go of complexes let go of
[1:40:40] those pains let go of that stuff you can
[1:40:41] be free you're Eagles you're meant to
[1:40:44] soar in the heavens this king is loving
[1:40:48] he's kind he's full of compassion he
[1:40:51] even loves The Sinner he loves the
[1:40:53] people who sin against him and do him
[1:40:54] dirty and and and and cheat on him he
[1:40:57] you you think he wasn't there you think
[1:41:00] he he didn't experience in the Garden of
[1:41:02] Eden when his very first family betrayed
[1:41:04] him you think he doesn't know what
[1:41:05] betrayal feels
[1:41:08] like he knows what that feels like he
[1:41:11] knows what Satan he knows what Satan has
[1:41:13] done to us in the disadvantage of being
[1:41:15] born in sin Paul deals with that in the
[1:41:17] Book of Romans Satan took advantage of
[1:41:20] the law Paul said that which was meant
[1:41:22] for my good ended up being for my death
[1:41:24] because Satan went hm okay so they got a
[1:41:27] law I already know they can't keep it
[1:41:29] because they're born in sin so I'm going
[1:41:31] to make it to where every mistake they
[1:41:34] make I'm going to use it to disqualify
[1:41:36] them and it was
[1:41:38] working but I'm here to tell you the
[1:41:40] beauty of the new birth is is that that
[1:41:43] Satan can't do that after you're born
[1:41:46] again because when you're born
[1:41:50] again he's not accusing you
[1:41:53] he thinks he's accusing you of making a
[1:41:56] mistake but because it's no longer you
[1:41:58] that live it's Christ he's accusing
[1:42:00] Christ and that don't hold up in
[1:42:03] court so when God looks at you he
[1:42:06] doesn't see you he looks at your
[1:42:07] sacrifice which was Christ which was
[1:42:09] perfect in the case is dismissed see so
[1:42:13] so he he knows what Satan tries that you
[1:42:16] know the I mean the Lord loved us even
[1:42:18] when we were Sinners and he gave his
[1:42:20] life for us he gave his life long before
[1:42:22] you were ever born and trapped up in sin
[1:42:25] he's so faithful to us he's so faithful
[1:42:28] that even when Adam and Eve brother
[1:42:29] brandham deals with this that when when
[1:42:31] God saw his creation laying face down in
[1:42:35] in ruin and he said he wouldn't just
[1:42:38] leave it there I have I'm so glad I'm so
[1:42:41] glad that when I'm laying on my face in
[1:42:43] ruin before God he won't leave me laying
[1:42:46] there he said he went he said he because
[1:42:49] he's God and he won't be defeated I'm
[1:42:52] glad I'm so glad CU I get defeated but
[1:42:55] he's never
[1:42:57] defeated and he doesn't leave us laying
[1:42:59] there he he said he went to work
[1:43:02] immediately building back not just
[1:43:04] building me up to what I was he's never
[1:43:07] he's never trying to get me to me he's
[1:43:09] trying to get me to him he's building
[1:43:11] back an image in His
[1:43:14] image oh that's the beauty you talking
[1:43:17] about it an an advantage that we have
[1:43:20] he's already made that way at Calvary
[1:43:23] and the price has already been paid on
[1:43:25] the cross the earnest young people
[1:43:27] listen the earnest the deposit is ready
[1:43:30] to be deposited into your soul that's
[1:43:33] going to make you a new creation in
[1:43:36] Christ
[1:43:37] Jesus he's ready to save to the
[1:43:40] uttermost he's ready to forgive and to
[1:43:44] forget every transgression you've ever
[1:43:46] committed who wants an advantage like
[1:43:49] that today he's willing to forgive and
[1:43:52] forget
[1:43:53] everything you've ever done against him
