[36:55] look in the Book of Leviticus the 25th
[36:58] chapter we want to look in Leviticus and
[37:00] also we have a couple other places we'd
[37:02] like to read in the scripture Leviticus
[37:04] 25 I totally lost it in my ear Leviticus
[37:08] 25 and then we're going to look in the
[37:09] New Testament there it is that's good
[37:12] Leviticus 25 and I know this is a very
[37:14] very familiar reading we just want
[37:17] tonight to pull some things from here
[37:19] and just have a simple thought here on
[37:21] my heart but I was actually going to go
[37:24] a whole different direction and the Lord
[37:26] dealt with my heart early Friday morning
[37:28] to speak this thought so we just pray
[37:30] it'll be a blessing to you and if we
[37:32] read the word let's just buy our hearts
[37:34] together and I wonder maybe if you
[37:36] wouldn't mind just to lay your hand over
[37:37] on someone next to you brother to
[37:39] brother sister to sister husband to wife
[37:41] in a Godly order and let's just speak to
[37:43] him and let's invite him to come I

[41:28] I want to read Luke's gospel the fourth
[41:31] chapter another very a very familiar
[41:33] reading to you in Luke the fourth
[41:36] chapter
[41:37] in the 16th verse
[41:39] we know a study in the message this is
[41:41] Brother brahm's text for this day this
[41:44] scripture is fulfilled and he comes to
[41:47] the 16th verse
[41:49] of Luke 4
[41:51] and the Bible said and he came to
[41:53] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[41:55] and his custom was he went into the
[41:57] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[42:00] up for it to read now there was
[42:02] delivered unto him the book of the
[42:03] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[42:06] the book he found the place where it was
[42:08] written when he had opened the book
[42:10] somebody said well the opening the book
[42:12] is not in the Bible I have just read to
[42:13] you where the prophet of God takes this
[42:16] text to preach this day this scripture
[42:18] fulfilled and the Very words is he
[42:20] opened the book found the place where it
[42:22] was written and said the spirit of the
[42:25] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[42:27] me to preach the gospel to the poor sent
[42:30] me to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[42:31] Deliverance to the captives recovering
[42:33] of sight to the blind to sit at Liberty
[42:35] them of the bruised and to preach the
[42:38] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[42:40] closed the book gave it again to the
[42:41] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[42:44] all them that were in the synagogue were
[42:45] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[42:48] them this day is this scripture
[42:51] fulfilled in your ears amen this day is
[42:55] this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[42:57] and one other place I want to look with
[42:58] you is in John the eighth chapter John
[43:02] the eighth chapter another very familiar
[43:04] reading in John the eighth chapter and
[43:07] the 36th verse just one verse there
[43:10] Jesus here speaking again he says if the
[43:14] son therefore shall make you free you
[43:17] shall be free
[43:19] indeed if the son therefore shall make
[43:22] you free you shall be free indeed amen
[43:25] how many believes that here we ask the
[43:27] Lord to add the blessing to reading of
[43:29] his word as you can be seated here this
[43:30] afternoon I also want to say God bless
[43:32] you brother Samuel it sure is good to
[43:34] see you and amen in The Book of
[43:36] Leviticus there The Book of Luke The
[43:38] Book of John I want to if I can to speak
[43:41] to you tonight from those passages of
[43:42] scripture and if I title this tonight I
[43:44] want to speak to you on the hour of
[43:46] Jubilee amen the hour of Jubilee brother
[43:49] Branham preaches three messages on the
[43:52] word uh Jubilee He preaches Jubilee year
[43:55] he preaches the Azusa Jubilee and then
[43:57] he preaches return in Jubilee and in
[44:00] 1962 he's preaching return in Jubilee in
[44:02] paragraph 32 he says now is the hour of
[44:06] Jubilee so not in the past not in the
[44:08] present amen but now is the hour of
[44:11] Jubilee He said come back to your
[44:13] original inheritance to a real Holy
[44:16] Ghost again so now is the hour amen of
[44:18] Jubilee to come back to your inheritance
[44:21] your original inheritance Amen to a real
[44:23] Holy Ghost again so therefore he could
[44:25] say return in Jubilee now when you look
[44:28] at this word return it has a powerful
[44:30] definition it means to bring back it
[44:33] means to allow to return to put back to
[44:35] drawback give back restore it means to
[44:38] relinquish one's rights given payment to
[44:41] bring back to refresh to restore the the
[44:44] word Jubilee is another very powerful
[44:46] word it is a special anniversary of an
[44:49] event especially one celebrating 25 or
[44:52] 50 years amen of a Reign or activity so
[44:55] when brother bam is actually preaching
[44:57] returning jubilees preaching in 1962 at
[44:59] Jack Morris in Shreveport and he's
[45:01] actually there in a celebration of when
[45:03] the Holy Ghost fail and he said it's
[45:05] been 50 years since the Holy Ghost fell
[45:07] and he said now watch when the Holy
[45:09] Ghost fail it fell in a barn he said as
[45:12] a type of women when the Lord came to
[45:14] the Earth he said he was born and he
[45:16] said in a in a barn and a cow stable he
[45:19] said showing you that the Holy Ghost is
[45:21] coming to places that are humble but yet
[45:24] they will receive him not he's not going
[45:26] to the dignitaries he's not going to the
[45:28] to the fancy to the high polish but he's
[45:30] going to places amen that will receive
[45:32] him and they will welcome him in the
[45:34] power amen and not try to change him
[45:36] amen but they will allow him to be who
[45:39] he is when he comes on the scene now in
[45:41] the message he turns you believe again
[45:42] he said that Jubilee was God's manner of
[45:45] expressing Grace to his people amen for
[45:48] restoring or being brought back to their
[45:50] rightful position amen so Jubilee was
[45:53] God's grace being expressed to his
[45:55] people of being restored or brought back
[45:58] to their rightful position he said now I
[46:00] believe that this is the hour again of
[46:03] Jubilee He said I believe it's the time
[46:05] of Jubilee can we can we agree there
[46:07] it's the hour of Jubilee it's the it's
[46:09] the time of Jubilee it's the season of
[46:12] Jubilee He said the hour again of
[46:14] Jubilee now if there's been an hour
[46:16] again of Jubilee that means somewhere
[46:18] sometime amen there's been a jubilee
[46:21] amen and if there is another Jubilee
[46:23] then there's one in the future so there
[46:25] has been a jubilee amen there is a
[46:27] jubilee and according to a prophet he
[46:29] said we are headed for another great
[46:31] Jubilee so amen no matter what you're
[46:33] facing tonight no matter what you're
[46:35] going through no matter what situations
[46:37] and and battles and disappointments are
[46:39] plagued in your life amen as the Bride
[46:41] of Jesus Christ you have not been called
[46:43] amen unto bondage and Corruption and
[46:46] destruction and defilement of laodicea
[46:49] but you have been called anointed and
[46:51] positionally placed Amen in the Jubilee
[46:54] of God's word this hour is in the hour
[46:56] of Jubilee Abraham said many years has
[46:58] passed amen but the same God that sent
[47:01] the Jubilee in them days amen is the
[47:03] same God who sins the Jubilee today so
[47:06] therefore it's not a man bringing the
[47:08] Jubilee amen but it's God bringing the
[47:10] Jubilee brother Brandman off the scene
[47:11] nearly 60 years amen and we're still in
[47:14] a jubilee amen because the Jubilee is
[47:17] not coming from a man it's not coming
[47:19] from a church amen but the Jubilee is
[47:21] coming amen from the opening of the word
[47:24] and the age that we're living in what we
[47:25] need today my Christian friend is a
[47:27] jubilee time he said the devil has taken
[47:30] many Believers captive during this time
[47:32] for instance coldness and worldliness
[47:34] has slipped into the church but the
[47:36] thing we're here for today is in
[47:38] celebration of the old-fashioned Holy
[47:40] Ghost revivals that we used to have he
[47:42] said I hear our fathers talk about how
[47:44] the Angels Came Down amen and sang in
[47:46] the meetings now listen friends amen you
[47:48] you you've heard your song Leader's
[47:50] voice you've heard your preacher's voice
[47:52] amen you've even heard your voice but
[47:54] when is the last time amen you've been
[47:56] in a meeting and the angels come down
[47:58] amen and you didn't just hear Brother
[48:00] Tony's Voice or brother Jason's voice
[48:02] amen but you was actually hearing the
[48:04] voice of angels amen that was singing
[48:06] you say well preacher that's far out let
[48:08] me say this message is not a pipe dream
[48:10] this message is not something that was
[48:12] hatched out of one Walt Disney amen but
[48:14] this message is a reality amen and if
[48:17] it's a message of reality then it's
[48:19] coming to a people amen that are not the
[48:21] Sons and Daughters of fiction amen but
[48:23] they are children of Reality by the word
[48:25] amen that God is restored in the age of
[48:28] living him he said the Angels came down
[48:30] and saying and the power of God taken
[48:32] over and the Saints were born again and
[48:34] great things happen it comes from the
[48:36] old-fashioned backwards sky blue sin
[48:38] killing preacher the old sassafras type
[48:40] maybe men didn't even know their ABCs
[48:42] but they know Christ and they had the
[48:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that's
[48:47] what we hunger for today is an
[48:49] old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:51] amen and a pouring out of God's blessing
[48:54] amen let me say this revival is a
[48:56] promise in this message
[48:58] I meant a renewing from the presence of
[49:01] God is a promise in this message amen
[49:03] are refreshing from the presence of God
[49:05] is a promise in this message people say
[49:08] well amen we need a Revival I agree we
[49:10] don't just need a Revival once a year we
[49:12] don't just need a Revival twice a year
[49:14] amen but I believe I'm just going to
[49:16] preach since I'm here amen I believe
[49:18] we've come to a time where it doesn't
[49:19] take a special meeting Amen to enjoy the
[49:22] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost I believe
[49:24] we've come to a time where it don't take
[49:25] a special evangelist coming through town
[49:27] amen and announcing getting a bunch of
[49:29] people together amen but we have broke
[49:31] out into a dimension with God Amen that
[49:34] Wednesday nights can be conventions amen
[49:36] Sunday mornings can be special meaning
[49:38] amen this message is not limited to just
[49:41] a preacher amen or to a location amen
[49:44] but this is the message of the king amen
[49:46] it's the message of Resurrection it's
[49:48] the message of power it's the message of
[49:50] redemption this message is not looking
[49:52] for your education it's not looking for
[49:54] your abilities this message is looking
[49:56] amen for somebody who give their voice
[49:59] Amen to the infallible proofs of the
[50:01] resurrection of what Jesus Christ has
[50:03] done in our age and will give themselves
[50:06] to it and as you give yourself to it it
[50:08] will lift you up into a dimension where
[50:10] you can see things amen beyond the way
[50:12] the world sees them amen you can believe
[50:14] things beyond the way denomination

[50:17] said well this message is different I
[50:19] said Thank God Amen we finally got

[50:25] what her prostitute daughters are saying
[50:27] amen we have received amen the
[50:30] Fulfillment of the word and the age
[50:31] we're living in and it's a sound that
[50:33] you believe then we need a Revival but
[50:36] I'll say this we don't need a new
[50:37] building to have a Revival we don't need
[50:39] a new Bible to have a Revival we don't
[50:41] need a new choir to have a Revival amen
[50:44] we need a rededication and a
[50:46] re-outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen the

[51:15] realize
[51:17] our walk as a Christian is more you say
[51:19] why do we need a Revival why do we need
[51:21] to refreshing why do we need to renew

[56:07] I've knocked over a base a cello and a
[56:09] violin
[56:12] we just need a guitar right no bro now
[56:18] the life that we're living here present
[56:21] is reflecting our inheritance in the
[56:23] future in First Corinthians 15 40 that
[56:25] there are also celestial bodies and
[56:27] bodies terrestrial but the glory of the
[56:29] celestial is one and the glory of the
[56:31] terrestrial is another I remember saying
[56:33] question answers 54. I believe in the
[56:35] church here there's a role here I can
[56:37] hear Liv's mortal being so in this role
[56:39] lives mortal beings each one of us in
[56:42] this great conglomeration of gaiety
[56:43] Blackness and darkness he said Mortals
[56:46] live in here now they are influenced
[56:48] either from this away or from that away
[56:50] see you cannot have here be a spiritual
[56:54] being sinner of saints without having an
[56:56] influence from the underworld or the
[56:58] above world so we have just identified
[57:01] amen where the inheritance in the future
[57:03] is laying according to the way you're
[57:05] walking amen if you're walking a certain
[57:08] way then you're being influenced from
[57:09] the underworld if you're walking another
[57:12] way you're being influenced from above
[57:13] world if you're an influence from here
[57:15] amen then you're from above and your
[57:18] celestial your body is waiting up here
[57:19] but if you're Wicked hypocritical and
[57:21] different then your Celestial body is
[57:23] down here regardless of how much you
[57:26] think it's up here because they're fruit
[57:28] that you bear before the pre people
[57:30] proves where you're from
[57:32] so you can't think it's up there and
[57:35] make it be there but the life you're
[57:37] living here is a testimony of The
[57:40] Inheritance that's laying in the future
[57:42] so you are here what you are somewhere
[57:44] else I'm on church amen I heard
[57:46] Birmingham say yesterday he said death
[57:48] is not changing so good or bad he said
[57:51] the only thing death does is change the
[57:53] dwelling place amen so if you lived a
[57:55] bad life amen death ain't all of a
[57:57] sudden going to make you live a good
[57:58] life and put you in a good place Amen
[58:00] brother Joe death is just going to
[58:02] change amen you from here Amen to the
[58:04] place where your inheritance is you're
[58:06] reflecting while you were living He said
[58:08] see you life that you live here is just
[58:11] reflecting what inheritance is when you
[58:13] leave here so if you want to know what
[58:15] kind of inheritance you've got in the
[58:17] future amen look at the life you're
[58:19] living now you say well preacher the
[58:21] life I lived in the past don't look good
[58:22] I'm not talking about the life before
[58:25] the blood I'm talking about the life
[58:27] after the blood amen because amen if
[58:29] we're going before the blood we're ever
[58:31] one influence from the under world if
[58:33] we're going from before the blood
[58:34] wherever one on our way to hell if we're
[58:37] going before the blood we're not worthy
[58:39] to stand in the Shekinah glory amen that
[58:42] I say thank God for the blood amen that
[58:44] divorced us from the old nature that we
[58:46] was born in and introduced us to a new
[58:49] Nature by the baptism of the Holy Ghost

[1:02:21] vision you judge a church by the word

[1:02:25] God didn't call me to travel the country
[1:02:27] amen judging churches he called me to

[1:02:57] it's a word of anointing it's a word
[1:02:59] about amen don't you reduce this message
[1:03:01] down there's some little feeling or
[1:03:03] sensation or emotion this message is the

[1:03:22] to Liberty
[1:03:23] oh brother Andrew I don't know if I'm
[1:03:27] asked the question he repeats Jesus from
[1:03:29] Luke 18 and says will I find faith when
[1:03:31] I come the Earth he said Lord you never
[1:03:33] asked will I find church members will I
[1:03:36] find Creeds listen he never even asked
[1:03:38] will I find sincerity you said well I
[1:03:40] find faith when I come to this earth
[1:03:43] amen go study and only ones at the end
[1:03:44] time he said well I find Faith or will I
[1:03:46] find the word fulfilled come on Church
[1:03:49] the faith of God in this hour is the
[1:03:52] Fulfillment of the word of the Hour See
[1:03:54] Lord May these sick people let their
[1:03:57] faith loose just now and if they turn
[1:03:59] their faith loose then the sickness will
[1:04:01] have to turn loose
[1:04:03] show me and I believe in Mark 16 laying
[1:04:06] on his hands amen but show me where
[1:04:08] between turning your faith loose and the
[1:04:10] devil turning loose amen was a hand laid
[1:04:12] on you
[1:04:13] come on church and then show me where
[1:04:16] between turning your faith loose amen
[1:04:17] and coming through a prayer line though
[1:04:19] I believe in him had many will have more
[1:04:20] but show me where amen he said it he
[1:04:23] didn't say he said turn your faith loose
[1:04:26] and the minute you turn your faithful
[1:04:28] loose amen the devil will turn Loose as
[1:04:30] well amen he will leave his holy and
[1:04:33] they'll be set free by the power of the
[1:04:35] almighty God you say preacher why amen
[1:04:38] did you say let my faith loose then the
[1:04:40] devil will turn loose amen because when
[1:04:42] two men shake hands amen that means
[1:04:44] they're walking in agreement amen and
[1:04:46] the devil of your Affliction is not
[1:04:48] going to shake hands amen with the
[1:04:50] almighty God of your faith and then them
[1:04:52] walk in agreement amen but if you get a
[1:04:54] hold of Faith the devil turns loose of
[1:04:56] your body if you'll get a hold of the
[1:04:58] Word of Promise amen the devil turns
[1:05:00] loose for your children listen I know
[1:05:02] there's some bad situations amen but
[1:05:04] when did we stop believing in a God who
[1:05:06] could change the situation at any moment
[1:05:09] any second anytime listen I know you may
[1:05:11] not think it is happening but I'm going
[1:05:12] to tell you by the word it is amen while
[1:05:14] the word is being preached amen things
[1:05:17] are taking place
[1:05:19] you may not see it you may not feel it
[1:05:21] but that does not change the fact that
[1:05:23] it's happening
[1:05:25] oh yeah let the holy ghost search every
[1:05:27] heart baptize Every Soul heal everybody
[1:05:29] that's in divine presence now listen
[1:05:31] friends if Mark 16 be the truth it says
[1:05:34] they shall what lay hands on the sick
[1:05:36] and I believe it's the truth they shall
[1:05:39] cast out devils in my name I believe
[1:05:41] it's the truth then I heard the prophet
[1:05:43] say today he said I come here with
[1:05:45] orders from the Lord he said the Church
[1:05:47] of the Living God is Freeborn of the
[1:05:49] spirit of God don't need any
[1:05:51] denomination they follow the king of the
[1:05:53] Messianic and Kingdom they don't have to
[1:05:55] take people's things they they're
[1:05:57] Freeborn made free by the son who makes
[1:06:00] them free indeed these signs shall
[1:06:03] follow them
[1:06:04] now you say brother Andrew how does God
[1:06:06] free somebody can I just tell you
[1:06:08] according to a prophet God frees his
[1:06:10] church by the word
[1:06:12] God frees his church by the word look
[1:06:16] here in the message Junction or just
[1:06:17] once more he said Satan has no more
[1:06:19] power only as he can Bluff with it if he
[1:06:22] can only Bluff you into it then you'll
[1:06:24] have to have it but legally he has no
[1:06:27] power at all every Power he had was
[1:06:30] taken from him at Calvary that's where
[1:06:32] the price was paid he is nothing but a
[1:06:35] bluff if you want to listen to his bluff
[1:06:37] well all right but you don't have to you
[1:06:40] are free tonight if you want to listen
[1:06:43] to Satan's Bluff you can if you want to
[1:06:45] but you don't have to because you are
[1:06:48] free tonight he has made you free and
[1:06:51] now if something listen if something in
[1:06:54] the word can make you realize you are
[1:06:56] free by his grace or if something
[1:06:57] realized the word makes you understand
[1:06:59] or some Act of God that it included you
[1:07:02] it includes us all then you just accept
[1:07:05] it on those basis and you're free also
[1:07:08] you don't have to feel any different you
[1:07:10] don't have to feel anything at all Jesus
[1:07:11] never said that you feel it he said did
[1:07:14] you believe it it's Faith friends and
[1:07:16] that sharp two-edged sword will cut
[1:07:18] every Promise free if that arm of faith
[1:07:21] is able to yield the sword a great
[1:07:24] strong arm holding this Bible can cut
[1:07:27] every promise of it free I'm on Church a
[1:07:30] great strong hand of this Bible can pick
[1:07:33] up the word and can cut every promise of
[1:07:36] it free you say then why are you saying
[1:07:37] that because it's time to be strong in
[1:07:39] the Lord amen it's time to put on the
[1:07:42] Power of his mind it's time to quit
[1:07:44] letting the devil run us around the
[1:07:45] church they've been like we're a bunch
[1:07:47] of trespassers in the promises of God
[1:07:49] it's time to quit letting the devil amen
[1:07:51] say boo when we get little and he gets
[1:07:53] bigger I think it's time somebody
[1:07:55] somewhere sometime amen pick up the
[1:07:57] sword of the Lord and begin to say boo
[1:07:59] back at that devil and as you say boo
[1:08:02] he'll get smaller and you'll get bigger
[1:08:04] come on church amen you can only get so
[1:08:06] small and he can only get so big before
[1:08:09] something's gonna happen and maybe this
[1:08:11] sermon finds you in the car owner amen
[1:08:13] but release your faith and pick up the
[1:08:16] strong hand of God and accept the word
[1:08:18] if you believe it's not a man it's the
[1:08:21] ministering Spirit sent from the
[1:08:23] presence of God or they sent poor amen I
[1:08:25] love this brother brother Brad they're
[1:08:27] sent to minister amen forth the word to
[1:08:30] them who are The Heirs of Salvation
[1:08:31] remember said what does he do he stays
[1:08:34] right with the word amen Cuts every
[1:08:36] devil what does it the word what is it
[1:08:39] the ministering Spirit sent from the
[1:08:41] presence of God to anoint the speakers
[1:08:43] of God the word that stays with the word
[1:08:46] and he confirms the word with signs amen
[1:08:49] following which brings Jesus the same
[1:08:52] yesterday today and forever
[1:08:55] now you say brother Andrew you mentioned
[1:08:57] the bride's Jubilee what is the rights
[1:08:59] you believe well if you study the
[1:09:01] message you'll find that the bride's
[1:09:03] Jubilee amen is the interpreted word
[1:09:06] fulfilled the bride's Jubilee actually
[1:09:09] happens when the written word becomes
[1:09:12] manifested word by interpretating the
[1:09:14] word of God and then it is fulfilled
[1:09:16] remember said what a word to say this
[1:09:18] scripture 65 what a word think of it
[1:09:20] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:09:23] your ears before your eyes who said it
[1:09:25] God himself who is what The Interpreter
[1:09:28] of his own word then this day is this
[1:09:31] scripture fulfilled he said the Messiah
[1:09:33] himself amen standing in the presence of
[1:09:36] the congregation and reading a word out
[1:09:39] of the Bible pertaining to himself and
[1:09:41] then saying amen today this scripture is
[1:09:44] fulfilled watch and they still failed to
[1:09:47] see it now now that would I mean amen
[1:09:49] y'all got to forgive me cause I'm just a
[1:09:51] country boy okay but that would be like
[1:09:52] you go in a room and in the room amen
[1:09:55] there's a book written and the book says
[1:09:57] Andrew Glover will walk in at seven
[1:09:58] o'clock in a great pair of pants a white
[1:10:00] shirt purple top black coat pick up this
[1:10:03] word read it close it hand it back and
[1:10:05] sit down and it'll be fulfilled
[1:10:07] so Andrew Glover comes in seven o'clock
[1:10:09] gray pants white shirt purple tie black
[1:10:12] coat picks up the Bible reads the word
[1:10:14] goes over sits down and somebody says
[1:10:16] well I just don't think that's what it
[1:10:17] is
[1:10:19] well why don't you think it is well so
[1:10:21] and so told me that he would have on a
[1:10:23] black shirt and he would have on gray
[1:10:24] pants but he would have a different
[1:10:26] color tie but why don't you think it was
[1:10:27] so-and-so told me that he wouldn't be
[1:10:29] six foot three he'd be five foot four
[1:10:31] amen but if you if you read the
[1:10:33] description come on church if you read
[1:10:35] the description when you see the
[1:10:37] Fulfillment match the description it's a
[1:10:40] sin to disbelieve it and that's exactly
[1:10:42] what happened amen Jesus according to
[1:10:44] Isaiah walked in the temple picked up
[1:10:47] the Bible found the place that was
[1:10:48] written read it right out and their eyes
[1:10:50] saw it their ears heard it they've been
[1:10:52] their mouths dropped open as he done it
[1:10:54] but because they were believing man's
[1:10:56] interpretation amen they missed the
[1:10:58] Jubilee and they continue to serve under
[1:11:01] the traditions of the Pharisees and the
[1:11:03] Sadducees and I'm just going to go and
[1:11:05] preach since I'm here amen this message
[1:11:07] amen has not changed since a prophet
[1:11:09] walked off the scene man has changed it
[1:11:11] man is trying to interpret but this
[1:11:14] message Remains the Same amen Jesus
[1:11:16] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:11:18] forever this word is not being
[1:11:20] interpreted by man it's being
[1:11:22] interpreted by God which is bringing the
[1:11:25] perfect interpretation of the word in
[1:11:27] the church which by the perfect
[1:11:29] interpretation it is literally bringing
[1:11:31] us back Amen to our original inheritance
[1:11:34] see our original inheritance is an
[1:11:37] Incorruptible inheritance she loved that
[1:11:39] Peter said it like this he said which
[1:11:41] according to His abundant Mercy hath
[1:11:43] begotten us again unto a lively hope
[1:11:45] Amen to an inheritance is Incorruptible
[1:11:47] undefiled and Faith it's not a way and
[1:11:50] it is reserved in heaven for you now
[1:11:52] watch this word incorruptable it's
[1:11:54] something that has no principles of
[1:11:57] dissolution or decay in it therefore it
[1:12:00] must be totally different from this
[1:12:03] Earth
[1:12:04] this inheritance must be something
[1:12:07] totally different from this Earth why
[1:12:09] who now watch the next verse who were
[1:12:12] kept by the power of God Amen through
[1:12:14] faith unto salvation and they are ready
[1:12:16] to be revealed in the last time Peter
[1:12:19] goes on to say we've been born again
[1:12:20] amen not of corruptable seed but of
[1:12:23] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:12:26] liveth and abideth forever now if a man
[1:12:28] is born of a word he will produce the
[1:12:31] word and the fruit or works of his life
[1:12:33] will be a product of the kind of seed or
[1:12:35] life that is in him his Works therefore
[1:12:38] will be scriptural so if you've got a
[1:12:40] corruptable seed you'll have corruptable
[1:12:43] Works amen which will end in destruction
[1:12:45] of the corruption but if you have an
[1:12:47] Incorruptible seat that is received an
[1:12:49] Incorruptible inheritance it will that
[1:12:52] the inheritance sin will end up in an
[1:12:54] Incorruptible body then I say this to
[1:12:56] you with everything within me our
[1:12:58] inheritance is scriptural
[1:13:00] don't you ever let anybody tell you that
[1:13:03] this inheritance is not scriptural this
[1:13:05] inheritance is scriptural amen and where
[1:13:07] did it come from it did not come from
[1:13:09] the hybrid beginning but it comes from
[1:13:11] the original beginning said it very
[1:13:13] plain he said we are on our road back to
[1:13:15] that original beginning of the creation
[1:13:18] of God then what is the way back amen
[1:13:20] the way back or the road back is the
[1:13:23] Holy Ghost then how did the Holy Ghost
[1:13:25] come to the church amen on the day of
[1:13:27] Pentecost amen the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:29] released back into the church which was
[1:13:31] the abstract which was the token which
[1:13:33] was the sign which was the mark amen
[1:13:35] listen friends when something is sent
[1:13:37] you will either receive it or you will
[1:13:39] reject it
[1:13:40] when something from God is sent you will
[1:13:43] either receive it or you will reject it
[1:13:45] now brother Brahm said if you receive it
[1:13:47] he said it will be a golden age he said
[1:13:49] but if you reject it amen now watch when
[1:13:51] people rejected amen the place always
[1:13:54] goes into chaos and just rots in its
[1:13:56] condition now amen if you want to preach
[1:13:58] with me we can amen go to go to Life
[1:14:00] Tabernacle Shreveport amen and look
[1:14:02] where they're at today amen they meant
[1:14:04] their Generations removed from when a
[1:14:06] prophet stood there but you go in there
[1:14:07] and brother Jason there's no resemblance
[1:14:09] that a prophet ever stepped foot in that
[1:14:11] place amen you know why because God sent
[1:14:14] the word fulfilled amen by the voice of
[1:14:16] the seventh angel which that word was
[1:14:18] going to be a jubilee amen not to the
[1:14:21] denominational people amen but to the
[1:14:23] gene seed of God Amen to show them
[1:14:25] you're headed for another true belief
[1:14:27] amen and what do they do they slam the
[1:14:29] door in the face and said we don't want
[1:14:31] that here rather you know it or not
[1:14:32] when's preached in last part of his
[1:14:34] ministry 1965 in Shreveport amen he's
[1:14:37] down there preaching predestination he's
[1:14:39] preaching invisible Union amen and Jack
[1:14:42] Moore actually goes to the hotel to tell
[1:14:44] him you cannot continue the meetings
[1:14:46] amen you have to take him somewhere else
[1:14:47] but they kept giving him the wrong room
[1:14:49] and REM comes to the pulpit and makes a
[1:14:52] joke about it and says well they never
[1:14:53] found me guess we'll have to go
[1:14:54] somewhere else amen now you believe what
[1:14:56] you want to believe but I believe that
[1:14:57] was the hand of God Amen because
[1:14:59] hundreds are not hundreds of feathers
[1:15:01] amen but years later right here on
[1:15:03] Beaufort South Carolina on a Saturday
[1:15:05] night Amen in the back part of God's
[1:15:07] mind he had a bride who would be sitting
[1:15:10] here in the age when the message was to
[1:15:12] be sent and she would not reject it she
[1:15:14] would not say take it somewhere else but
[1:15:16] she would say be it unto me Lord
[1:15:18] according to Thy word amen amen my hands
[1:15:21] are yours my mouth is yours my heart is
[1:15:24] yours amen my family my church my
[1:15:27] Ministry amen I give my life amen to the
[1:15:30] message of it I say we ought to open up
[1:15:32] a door and welcome back the authority of
[1:15:35] what a prophet told in this generation
[1:15:37] until it frees our kids it frees our
[1:15:39] marriages
[1:15:41] come on church I'm I'm just going to
[1:15:43] preach and then we got situations that
[1:15:45] counselors can't fix we got problems
[1:15:47] that psychologists can't get us out of
[1:15:49] and the only hope for the church is the
[1:15:52] return of the true holy ghost in the
[1:15:55] Dynamics of its power I say we welcome
[1:15:57] the Holy Ghost we welcome him to move
[1:16:01] come on Church he'll do things that we
[1:16:03] can't do come on he can do more in five
[1:16:05] minutes brother Jason then five hour
[1:16:07] prayer meetings can do amen he can do
[1:16:09] more in five minutes than 50 years of
[1:16:12] trying to figure it out can do yeah when
[1:16:15] he comes in except him come on because
[1:16:18] he's coming to bring you into your
[1:16:20] position
[1:16:22] he's not coming to leave you in the
[1:16:25] bondage he's coming to bring you into
[1:16:27] the Liberty now when program says this
[1:16:29] he opens returning Jubilee amen by
[1:16:31] showing Israel's portion of inheritance
[1:16:34] in the land of Palestine and he said see
[1:16:36] the portion of inheritance could not be
[1:16:39] fulfilled by anyone else so you're
[1:16:42] sitting there thinking someday somebody
[1:16:44] somewhere is going to come along and
[1:16:47] they're going to do a lot better job
[1:16:48] than me and God's going to give them my
[1:16:50] position well I don't know who you're
[1:16:52] serving amen but that's not how my God
[1:16:54] works come on Church my God if he gets
[1:16:57] your position amen he will make sure you
[1:17:00] fill that position and every devil in
[1:17:02] hell amen will have to stand back and
[1:17:04] watch him amen use you in that position
[1:17:08] come on Amen these are not given take
[1:17:10] positions amen do you want to be the
[1:17:12] bride today or you didn't do good today

[1:17:15] son tomorrow here no that's not the way
[1:17:17] God works amen if you ever was the son
[1:17:19] of God you always was the son of God if
[1:17:22] you ever was a part of this bride you
[1:17:24] always was because the predestination
[1:17:26] position of God is Not Upon A give and
[1:17:29] take basis it's Upon Us thus saith the
[1:17:32] Lord in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[1:17:34] before the foundation I tell you what I
[1:17:36] feel like preaching here for a second I
[1:17:38] think we ought to take a few moments and
[1:17:39] let that devil know after everything he
[1:17:42] done to destroy us and try to take us
[1:17:44] out and try to bury us and try to make
[1:17:46] us just another church on the side of

[1:17:57] we're still here amen we're still in the
[1:18:00] fight amen because we didn't put
[1:18:01] ourselves in amen but God from before
[1:18:04] the foundation of the world persistently
[1:18:06] placed this church in its position and
[1:18:09] there ain't enough devils in hell right
[1:18:10] enough devils in time right enough
[1:18:12] devils in this Dimension Amen to pull

[1:18:42] like that we'll be back Wednesday and if
[1:18:44] you don't like that we'll be here 10
[1:18:45] years until this bride leaves the Earth
[1:18:48] this bride will be in her position
[1:18:51] and she will not be swayed by the
[1:18:54] situations of her life she will not be
[1:18:56] moved by the conditions of laodicea

[1:28:21] their position Amen in The Inheritance
[1:28:24] in the land but they didn't feel it till
[1:28:26] a hundred years later
[1:28:29] so when she called their name she was
[1:28:32] positionally placing them in Palestine
[1:28:35] and they're still babies coming out of
[1:28:37] her womb
[1:28:39] but they've already got their position
[1:28:40] and years goes by but brother Josh
[1:28:43] nothing changes what she screamed out in
[1:28:46] her labor pains nothing they went
[1:28:48] through could change their position they
[1:28:51] was ordained to it they was born to fill
[1:28:53] that position listen and you say well
[1:28:55] well what's this so important about that
[1:28:56] called because called means to call it
[1:29:00] means to name so when something calls
[1:29:02] you it names you
[1:29:04] it means to call by name it means to
[1:29:07] give a name to it means to receive the
[1:29:10] name of receive as a name to give some
[1:29:13] name to one it means to call his name
[1:29:15] then our old name listen amen I'm just
[1:29:18] going to preach here because there's
[1:29:20] nobody in here got a right to hold up a
[1:29:22] Halo and say well I'm better than
[1:29:23] so-and-so and I've been here this long
[1:29:25] and I know every one of us was born in
[1:29:28] sin shaping in iniquity and brother John
[1:29:31] the only thing we had going for us was a
[1:29:33] prophet said that when God created the
[1:29:36] foundation of the world he said God in
[1:29:38] his labor pains was bringing forth you
[1:29:41] knowing what you would do the same level
[1:29:44] cause the same Pains of those Hebrew
[1:29:46] mothers amen called their names and
[1:29:49] their tribes and positionally placed
[1:29:51] them amen years before they got in their
[1:29:53] position amen and the prophet of God
[1:29:55] said God called your name when he was
[1:29:58] bringing forth the Earth he positionally
[1:30:00] placed you into his own body to be a
[1:30:03] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:30:05] preacher a prophet to be this or that he
[1:30:07] placed you positionally then what
[1:30:09] happened God in his Masterworks knew he
[1:30:12] would not be defeated and so he promised
[1:30:14] there would be a church in the end time
[1:30:16] that would be positionally placed in the
[1:30:20] position he saw her all the way from
[1:30:22] when he was creating the Book of Genesis
[1:30:24] listen friends Jesus did the works of
[1:30:27] the father why because the father was in
[1:30:29] him then the god which is the word which
[1:30:32] was invisible was invisible until it was
[1:30:35] made visible and then the word became
[1:30:37] visible listen friends in God's labor
[1:30:40] pains when he was bringing forth he
[1:30:42] called you unto Liberty he called you
[1:30:45] into this Liberty amen but it was an
[1:30:46] invisible calling until the word become
[1:30:49] flesh in your flesh and when the word
[1:30:51] become flesh in your flesh it called you
[1:30:53] into your position listen that's why
[1:30:56] when you're sitting in church and you
[1:30:58] hear the word and some literally pulls
[1:31:00] you up out of your seat brother Jason
[1:31:01] and you say Amen you're not doing that
[1:31:04] because the preachers begging you you're
[1:31:06] not doing well well some do but I don't
[1:31:08] amen you're not doing that amen because
[1:31:10] somebody's working you up you're doing
[1:31:12] that because the word that's being
[1:31:14] preached is calling you into your
[1:31:16] position and it's not a word of defeat
[1:31:18] it's not a word of bondage it is a word
[1:31:22] of Liberty and as you hear the word you
[1:31:25] receive the word and as you receive the
[1:31:27] word you become the word and you're
[1:31:29] being positionally placed not as a
[1:31:31] defeated housewife but as a liberated
[1:31:34] housewife amen not as a defeated farmer
[1:31:37] but a liberate is harmor not as a
[1:31:39] defeated Pastor brother Jason but a
[1:31:41] liberated Pastor listen I say we ought
[1:31:43] to declare war on every devil in hell
[1:31:46] it's time to take our Liberty amen we've
[1:31:48] been called unto Liberty my name is not
[1:31:51] depression my name is not suicide my
[1:31:54] name is not defeat and failure but my
[1:31:56] name is Miss Jesus Christ and I have
[1:31:59] been called by the word of my age
[1:32:02] you say preacher why are you free cause
[1:32:05] I can't help but be free
[1:32:07] I got y'all forgive me I got to dance
[1:32:09] the other day when I was preaching
[1:32:10] somebody's sitting there staring at me

[1:32:14] caught me wrong you know I tried he's
[1:32:17] just kind of sitting around at me I said

[1:32:46] to a Pentecostal church and just sit
[1:32:48] there and raise your hand and not and

[1:33:09] people that did there'll be people
[1:33:10] that'll sit at the marriage supper of
[1:33:12] the lamb and they never one time spoke
[1:33:14] in tongues but there'll be people sent
[1:33:16] there that did they'll be people that'll
[1:33:18] fellowship with Paul around the tree of
[1:33:21] life and they'll drink water from the
[1:33:22] River of Life and they never one time
[1:33:24] stood up and shouted amen but the word

[1:33:41] like sitting there raving your hands and

[1:33:45] Liberty to do that because a man didn't
[1:33:48] give us your position but Church didn't
[1:33:50] give you this position but you were

[1:34:19] I feel like shout hallelujah you've been
[1:34:23] called to it
[1:34:25] I've been called this position you've

[1:34:31] Oh Glory to God
[1:34:33] you've been given the name Liberty I
[1:34:36] don't have time to preach it to you but
[1:34:37] it's a beautiful story Israel
[1:34:40] goes in the mud pits of Egypt right
[1:34:43] 400 years
[1:34:46] Abraham receives a vision after 400
[1:34:49] years
[1:34:51] sister you're gonna walk out defeated
[1:34:54] with no joy barely holding on barely
[1:34:59] believing it's not what the vision said
[1:35:01] the vision said after 400 years you'll
[1:35:03] come out with great substance
[1:35:07] 400 years passed
[1:35:09] and all they had was the vision that God
[1:35:12] gave Father Abraham
[1:35:15] but they knew in 400 years we're leaving
[1:35:17] here do you know what I got to study one
[1:35:19] day and I got to thinking about
[1:35:20] something realization how many times did
[1:35:23] those Israelite fathers come home get in
[1:35:26] the tent have enough time just to get La
[1:35:28] get Salve put in their in their straps
[1:35:31] in their stripes from the day before and
[1:35:34] barely get the skin the touch and then
[1:35:36] the next morning wake up and go back in
[1:35:38] those mud pits
[1:35:41] how did they do that for 400 years
[1:35:45] they didn't have three services a week
[1:35:47] they didn't have 50 youth camps a year
[1:35:50] they didn't have 20 special meetings and
[1:35:52] 10 conventions come on Church they
[1:35:55] didn't have men's prayer breakfast every
[1:35:56] two weeks they didn't have come on they
[1:35:59] didn't they didn't have Friday night
[1:36:00] Youth Services over at the as they
[1:36:02] didn't have those all they had was a
[1:36:05] vision God gave Abraham that your seed
[1:36:08] will sojourn in a Strange Land but after
[1:36:11] 400 years I'll bring a jubilee upon this
[1:36:14] seed and when the Jubilee comes upon it
[1:36:16] I'll bring you out with great substance
[1:36:18] but you know what I found I found out in
[1:36:20] the Bible there's a principle you know
[1:36:22] what I call it I call it David's
[1:36:23] principle
[1:36:25] say with me David's principal
[1:36:27] you know what it is it's when they spoke
[1:36:30] of stone and David the Bible says that
[1:36:33] David encouraged himself
[1:36:37] David encouraged himself in the Lord he
[1:36:40] didn't have nobody to pray for with him
[1:36:42] he didn't have nobody to sing with him
[1:36:44] but brother Samuel he reached over and
[1:36:47] got a hold of David's principle and said
[1:36:49] I will encourage myself in the Lord and
[1:36:51] I can see those Israelites walking for
[1:36:53] the chase in those mud pits every day
[1:36:56] saying be of good cheer be of good
[1:36:58] courage hold on Church we're leaving
[1:37:00] here one of these days just a few more
[1:37:03] whips and we're out of here just a few
[1:37:05] more days of pain and Agony and we're
[1:37:07] out of here because the seed is under
[1:37:09] the promise of Jubilee what are you
[1:37:11] saying preacher I'm saying that this is
[1:37:13] the ear of Jubilee it's the season of
[1:37:15] Jubilee by the vision of the word
[1:37:17] remember said look if they was in a
[1:37:19] walled City or Within Walls he said
[1:37:21] those walls paraphrase him will never
[1:37:24] stop the Jubilee
[1:37:26] I'm coming into my message right now
[1:37:28] from my heart okay amen I'm not y'all
[1:37:31] forgive me I'm not prone to Fanatics hey
[1:37:33] man but I had a whole service whole
[1:37:35] whole other direction laid out but
[1:37:37] wrestling in my mind and praying at 1 42
[1:37:39] a.m Friday morning I don't know what it
[1:37:41] was but it was a voice spoke to my heart
[1:37:43] and said preach the Jubilee so that's
[1:37:45] all I'm going to do here tonight is
[1:37:47] preach what God spoke to my heart preach
[1:37:49] the Jubilee preach the people that you
[1:37:51] believe you say preacher what are you
[1:37:53] getting at I'm saying that your walls
[1:37:55] will never stop this Jubilee I'm saying
[1:37:57] this situations that look impossible
[1:37:59] will never stop this true belief we have
[1:38:02] received the leadership of the Holy
[1:38:05] Ghost we have not rejected it we have a
[1:38:08] sure confidence in the leadership of the
[1:38:10] Holy Ghost and we're not bowing down but
[1:38:13] we're in the end of the season and
[1:38:15] Reverend said at the end of the season
[1:38:16] he said those drift fences was taken
[1:38:18] down and all the cattle got together and
[1:38:21] they celebrated a great big Jubilee He
[1:38:23] said and I pray God in the coming week
[1:38:25] we'll take all the dress finches a
[1:38:27] denomination will be torn down and all
[1:38:30] born again children of God will be
[1:38:32] brought together in one great big Holy
[1:38:34] Ghost rally of Jubilee where they all
[1:38:36] get together you say now preacher I've
[1:38:39] heard you believe tonight I've heard the
[1:38:41] word but I'm sitting here I've heard
[1:38:43] about a position I've heard about these
[1:38:45] things but brother Andrew you don't
[1:38:46] realize I don't have an inheritance okay
[1:38:49] well let me ask you this how many
[1:38:51] children of God do we have here
[1:38:57] you testify you're a child of God then
[1:39:00] will you receive the words of a
[1:39:02] Vindicated prophet
[1:39:03] every child of God has an inheritance
[1:39:10] every child of God has an inheritance
[1:39:13] and if that inheritance is lost then you
[1:39:16] have a god-given right to go back and
[1:39:19] take the inheritance back you say
[1:39:21] preacher how in the world am I going to
[1:39:23] do this because Grace made a way for the
[1:39:26] Lost inheritance to be returned
[1:39:30] Grace made a way for the Lost
[1:39:33] inheritance to be returned you say what
[1:39:35] is it preacher it's nothing but the
[1:39:37] pardoning grace of God remember I'm
[1:39:39] sitting in that Jubilee year every man
[1:39:41] lost his Heritage by some means if he
[1:39:44] was a Freeborn True Blood is right no
[1:39:46] matter who held the possession it had to
[1:39:48] go back to him free he didn't have to
[1:39:51] pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing
[1:39:53] what did he have to do he just stopped
[1:39:55] what he was doing and go back to his
[1:39:57] inheritance what a picture it gives to
[1:40:00] church in the last days you see what man
[1:40:02] can do and what God does but the Jubilee
[1:40:05] was God's manner of expressing Grace to
[1:40:08] his people or bringing them back to
[1:40:10] their right for possession what are you
[1:40:12] saying I'm saying the hour of Jubilee
[1:40:14] there was the sounding of the Jubilee
[1:40:17] trumpet Leviticus 25 9 the trumpet sound
[1:40:19] throughout all your land first
[1:40:21] Thessalonians 4 16 the Lord himself
[1:40:23] shall descend from heaven with what a
[1:40:25] shout with a voice of the Archangel and
[1:40:28] with the Trump of God first Corinthians
[1:40:30] 14 8 if the trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:40:33] sound then who shall prepare himself for
[1:40:36] the battle listen now a man in his
[1:40:38] family could hear the Jubilee trumpet
[1:40:39] which is the gospel and right then they
[1:40:42] could go back to their original Heritage
[1:40:44] if they could hear the Jubilee a trumpet
[1:40:47] sound and know what it meant listen are
[1:40:49] you ready for this the whole family
[1:40:51] could come and receive their inheritance
[1:40:57] the whole family could come and receive
[1:41:00] their inheritance he said what is that
[1:41:03] inheritance the Pentecostal experience
[1:41:05] which is your possession now I don't
[1:41:07] find this strange brother Matt that in
[1:41:09] Leviticus 25 it says on the 10th day of
[1:41:13] the seventh month amen so you hear but
[1:41:16] day of atonement and shall the sound of
[1:41:18] the trumpet be that's not strange to me
[1:41:20] because I read brother Kent in
[1:41:22] Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice
[1:41:25] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:41:28] to sound the same words used in
[1:41:31] Leviticus 25 have now oh God have now
[1:41:35] come over in Revelation 10 and he says
[1:41:38] the mystery of God will be finished as
[1:41:40] it declared to his servants of prophets
[1:41:41] remember he said what is it both of them
[1:41:43] working for the same Master amen slave
[1:41:46] amen just a slave and then a son they're
[1:41:49] both working for the same master so the
[1:41:51] slave don't have one master and the son
[1:41:54] that's a slave have another they've got
[1:41:55] this same Master he said now watch amen
[1:41:59] their soul under sin he said many a time
[1:42:01] he said they stay that way but now watch
[1:42:03] he said they take dogma's rituals Creeds
[1:42:06] in the church instead of taking the real
[1:42:07] word but when the real word sounds
[1:42:09] itself out they don't know what you're
[1:42:11] talking about they call you a Holy
[1:42:13] Roller see why amen because the real
[1:42:16] word is the Holy Ghost itself amen
[1:42:19] sounding through human flesh come on
[1:42:22] church when when the priest picked up
[1:42:24] the trumpet am I going too long
[1:42:26] when the priest picked up the trumpet in
[1:42:29] Leviticus 25 amen and sounded amen the
[1:42:32] breath he was blowing was coming out of
[1:42:35] his mouth into the trumpet and it was
[1:42:37] connected with the trumpet and it was
[1:42:39] putting out a sound and that sound amen
[1:42:42] was the sound of Jubilee without the
[1:42:45] trumpet sound it was just a breath
[1:42:47] without the breath connecting with
[1:42:50] something it was just a breath but when
[1:42:52] the breath of the priest connected with
[1:42:54] the instrument of the trumpet and began
[1:42:57] to sound it changed it from just a voice
[1:42:59] into a supernatural sound amen and when
[1:43:03] they heard that sound when they heard
[1:43:05] the trumpet they could throw down the
[1:43:07] hole let me tell you young people let me
[1:43:09] tell you church this Holy Ghost message
[1:43:11] is not the sound of a bunch of preachers
[1:43:13] it's not the sound of a box of
[1:43:15] personalities this message is the holy
[1:43:18] ghost that has been bound by
[1:43:20] denominational Rivers for 2 000 years
[1:43:22] being released in the evening time come
[1:43:25] on Church the mess message is not just
[1:43:27] in books the messages and flesh
[1:43:31] come on I don't have a shofar tonight
[1:43:33] Brad I don't have a trumpet tonight but
[1:43:36] I'm sounding the Jubilee
[1:43:40] oh I've sounded just like pressure how
[1:43:42] you sounding amen because when you hear
[1:43:44] it you can go free somebody say free
[1:43:47] you can go free
[1:43:49] you can't go free
[1:43:51] it feels good to say it you can go free
[1:43:53] you say preacher what are you getting at
[1:43:55] only the son that had lost his
[1:43:58] inheritance was able to go free and as
[1:44:00] many as received him to them gave you
[1:44:03] power to become the sons look at this
[1:44:04] word power it's the liberty of doing as
[1:44:07] one pleases
[1:44:09] foreign
[1:44:10] are you ready for this it means to leave
[1:44:17] so when you heard the Jubilee trumpet
[1:44:19] sound
[1:44:20] you didn't have to ask for permission to
[1:44:23] leave
[1:44:25] testing one two it's still working when
[1:44:28] you heard the Jubilee trumpet you didn't
[1:44:31] have to go to the Taskmaster and say Sir
[1:44:34] I've got a wife at home I've got babies
[1:44:36] and starving I've got a home falling
[1:44:38] apart would you mind if I go back to my
[1:44:41] family when you heard that trumpet
[1:44:44] program said like this he said you could
[1:44:47] throw down the hole and you could go and
[1:44:49] walk off and say don't you ever hit me
[1:44:51] again don't you ever touch me again he
[1:44:54] said why because you was being loosed
[1:44:57] from the slave bill of sin you was being
[1:44:59] loosed from the slave out of the
[1:45:01] Taskmaster now you all know according to
[1:45:03] Revelation 1 5 how we are loose we are
[1:45:05] loose by the blood right the perfect
[1:45:08] blood of God looses us entirely no
[1:45:11] longer to serve the Taskmaster but to
[1:45:13] walk in the liberty and go back to our
[1:45:16] original Heritage then turns you and
[1:45:18] says it like this he says the man in the
[1:45:20] museum the other day crying his eyes out
[1:45:22] an old black fella he said I walked over
[1:45:24] and put my arm around him I said sir
[1:45:25] what's wrong he said do you see that
[1:45:27] dress he said I do and Michael he said
[1:45:30] that dress is the dress of the wife of
[1:45:33] Abraham Lincoln he said the blood on
[1:45:35] that dress is Abraham Lincoln's blood he
[1:45:37] said sir then why are you crying he said
[1:45:39] he turned around and lifted up his shirt
[1:45:41] he said do you see these scars on my
[1:45:43] back he's said that blood on that dress
[1:45:46] sister Debbie that blood on that dress
[1:45:48] stopped the scars on that man's back
[1:45:51] brother said I'll look put my arm around
[1:45:53] him and I said the blood of a sinful man
[1:45:56] named Abraham Lincoln meant so much to a
[1:45:58] man that he could move him into worship
[1:46:00] he said but then I got to thinking about
[1:46:02] some more scars
[1:46:05] he said I got to thinking about some
[1:46:07] more scars he said I got to thinking
[1:46:09] amen about the sleigh bell to sin he
[1:46:12] said then I begin to think about how it
[1:46:13] control me he said but then all of a
[1:46:16] sudden he said one day I recognize that
[1:46:19] the blood of Jesus Christ had been said
[1:46:21] and I no longer had to serve under sin I
[1:46:24] was freed by the blood
[1:46:27] I was free somebody say freed by the
[1:46:31] blood oh I was freed
[1:46:35] by the blood the devil don't want to
[1:46:37] hear that but I'm going to say it to him
[1:46:38] again you were freed by the blood you
[1:46:41] were born in sin but you were subject to
[1:46:44] bondage by the fall but God through his
[1:46:46] grace declared a Year of Jubilee and I
[1:46:48] said now watch we were under a load can
[1:46:50] I can I read this to you our parents
[1:46:52] sold us out to sin the Garden of Eden we
[1:46:54] were laid under the bonds of sin we were
[1:46:56] a slave to the devil we were born in sin
[1:46:57] safe and equally now listen there was
[1:47:00] nothing we could do to help us
[1:47:03] brother Aaron there was nothing we could
[1:47:05] do to help us cause our whole makeup our
[1:47:08] whole nature everything we are a Sin
[1:47:10] brother Andrew I'm trying to help myself
[1:47:13] get out of this condition can I give you
[1:47:15] a jubilee tonight you can't help
[1:47:17] yourself
[1:47:18] [Applause]
[1:47:20] you can't help yourself message Jubilee
[1:47:22] here remember him said I met a young
[1:47:23] lady not long ago she said brother ma'am
[1:47:25] I'd give anything if I could only break
[1:47:26] this band of whiskey she said I started
[1:47:29] when I was little girl with a boy that
[1:47:31] drank we started mixing drinks now watch
[1:47:33] her words and I become a perfect slave
[1:47:36] to it
[1:47:38] foreign
[1:47:39] I become a perfect slave to it and if I
[1:47:42] don't have it she says I just go wild if
[1:47:45] I can only get rid of this he said I
[1:47:47] looked at her and said you can't do it
[1:47:49] yourself but I know someone brother
[1:47:52] Luther I know someone who can break it
[1:47:55] for you the Lord Jesus Christ has come
[1:47:58] to make you free I'm just going to
[1:48:00] preach to you right now because some of
[1:48:02] y'all has become perfect slaves
[1:48:04] you become perfect slaves to situation
[1:48:07] amen come on don't get tired on me you
[1:48:10] know it's the truth you become a perfect
[1:48:12] slave to the way people think about you

[1:48:31] so looked at me I tell you brother Jason
[1:48:32] was preaching he looked right at me when
[1:48:34] he said that who else is he supposed to
[1:48:36] look at the walls
[1:48:39] come on and some people have been
[1:48:42] brought out of situations but they're
[1:48:44] still wearing the band to those
[1:48:45] situations

[1:48:49] never give their new church a chance but
[1:48:51] come on you know I'm telling you the
[1:48:52] truth but it's the hour of Jubilee I

[1:48:58] church scarred by a minister come to my
[1:49:00] church he said and sit there for years
[1:49:02] judging me based on how the former
[1:49:04] Minister scarred them and never give me

[1:52:05] now you'll make primitive from the Bible
[1:52:07] I can in Genesis the third chapter the
[1:52:10] Bible says that the seed of the woman
[1:52:12] would bruise the head of the serpent but
[1:52:15] the serpent brother Joe said the serpent
[1:52:17] would bruise her heel the serpent would
[1:52:19] only bruise his heel in other words you
[1:52:22] got a position but so does the devil
[1:52:26] I said you got a possession Brother JD
[1:52:29] but so does the devil you say the devil
[1:52:31] yeah the devil has a position it's under
[1:52:34] your foot
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:37] the devil has a position but it's under
[1:52:40] your foot God give the devil a position
[1:52:43] but it's under your foot
[1:52:46] you say well preacher the devil's
[1:52:48] Afflicted me he had a right to according
[1:52:51] to Genesis 3 God gave him a right to
[1:52:53] afflict you but you know where brother
[1:52:55] Steve the only place he has a right to
[1:52:57] afflict you is your heel
[1:53:00] if he afflicts you anywhere else he's
[1:53:03] out of his position brother Chris if he
[1:53:05] afflicts your mind he's out of his
[1:53:07] position if he afflicts your knee he's
[1:53:10] out of his position if he afflicts your
[1:53:12] emotions he's out of his position the
[1:53:15] Bible said put your foot on that devil
[1:53:17] then you know what I say in closing
[1:53:19] brother I say it's time for the bride to
[1:53:21] bring back some old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[1:53:24] Field foot stomping religion amen back
[1:53:27] in the house of God
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:30] it's time to put your foot on that devil
[1:53:33] some of y'all think I'm crazy join me
[1:53:35] I'm free it's time to put your foot on
[1:53:37] that devil it's a preacher you better be
[1:53:40] careful now if you got scripture I do
[1:53:41] Luke the 10th chapter Jesus said I
[1:53:44] beheld Satan amen fall from Heaven as
[1:53:47] lightning look at the definition of the
[1:53:49] word fall the word fall means come to
[1:53:51] its end right after Luke 10 the very
[1:53:54] next verse Jesus says I sing Satan come
[1:53:57] to his end very next verse brother Tony
[1:53:59] behold I give you power to put your foot
[1:54:02] to tread upon serpents and score in
[1:54:05] other words there was a connection
[1:54:07] between the devil's end and your foot
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:11] there was a connection between the
[1:54:14] devil's hand and your foot the very
[1:54:16] minute the devil come to his hand was
[1:54:18] the very minute God released the power
[1:54:20] in the church to put their foot on that
[1:54:23] devil can I go a little bit further with
[1:54:26] it you know what brother Ben said he
[1:54:28] said now we don't stomp a devil out
[1:54:31] you agree with me we don't stop it so I
[1:54:34] got to study I thought man why is there
[1:54:36] so much in the Bible about stomping the
[1:54:38] devil and then remember so we don't stop
[1:54:40] it able to make him go out he said now
[1:54:42] but listen when the devil is Defeated
[1:54:44] You've Got a right to stomp on him I
[1:54:47] said oh okay we don't stop to defeat a
[1:54:50] devil but we stomp on the defeated devil
[1:54:54] foreign
[1:54:57] you know me and I got thinking I got to
[1:55:00] thinking you get your straight animal
[1:55:02] around your property amen and that thing
[1:55:04] stands here and you throw something at
[1:55:06] you put a little bit of lead in it y'all
[1:55:07] forgive me
[1:55:09] just no comfortable okay you put a
[1:55:12] little lead in that boy amen that
[1:55:13] thing's gonna stand there and he's going
[1:55:15] to torment you but you know what he's
[1:55:17] defeated while he's doing it so I got to
[1:55:19] thinking amen if we got a ride to stomp
[1:55:22] amen then we can Stomp and get that
[1:55:24] defeated devil out here a lot quicker
[1:55:26] cause you know what you say you say get
[1:55:29] out of here
[1:55:30] go on
[1:55:32] get out of here y'all know I'm telling
[1:55:35] you the truth and some of y'all sitting
[1:55:37] there right now letting an old defeated
[1:55:38] devil has followed you since you as a
[1:55:41] child amen panelize you and torment you
[1:55:44] but the word of Jubilee has put a
[1:55:46] strength in your foot you've got to
[1:55:48] write by the word to put your foot on
[1:55:51] that devil now
[1:55:52] well I gotta close here I'm gonna preach
[1:55:54] all night but I gotta quit right here
[1:55:55] but then I got to study it you know what
[1:55:57] else program said he said Jesus Christ
[1:55:59] the son of God heals you of arthritis
[1:56:03] over 31 times he says that brother Steve
[1:56:06] he says the Lord Jesus heals you of our
[1:56:08] spirit anybody here ever been healed of
[1:56:10] it
[1:56:11] you've been healed of arthritis God
[1:56:13] heals arthritis don't he so I'm thanking
[1:56:15] brother Aaron we don't stomp on the
[1:56:17] devil but temperament says this
[1:56:20] he says now go out of this field and and
[1:56:22] stomp on that devil he heals you of
[1:56:25] arthritis I said oh there it is when the
[1:56:29] devil is Defeated You've Got a right to
[1:56:32] stomp on him as a sign he's back in his
[1:56:35] position
[1:56:38] can I go a little bit further you know
[1:56:40] what I found out I found out arthritis
[1:56:43] is the stiffness of joints
[1:56:46] and you know what happens the older you
[1:56:49] get the more age accumulates the stiffer
[1:56:52] you get
[1:56:54] I got to think of man praise God the
[1:56:57] Lord heals natural arthritis but then
[1:56:59] you know what brother Chris I found out
[1:57:01] there's another kind of arthritis it's
[1:57:02] called spiritual arthritis
[1:57:06] and we got a lot of cases around the
[1:57:08] church y'all know I'm telling the truth
[1:57:10] amen not gonna just tell you where it's
[1:57:11] at amen some people brother Jason they
[1:57:14] got spiritual arthritis in their hands
[1:57:15] you say how do you know that they can't
[1:57:17] shake hands with certain people
[1:57:19] their hands too stiff they can't shake
[1:57:22] somebody's hand you know why because 20
[1:57:24] years ago somebody done somebody wrong
[1:57:26] and they've held that little something
[1:57:28] in their heart and for 20 years they let
[1:57:30] spiritual arthritis amen Harden their
[1:57:33] hand and they see the brothers see the
[1:57:35] sister can't shake their hands oh you
[1:57:37] know I'm telling you the truth amen I
[1:57:39] found out people got spiritual arthritis
[1:57:40] in their elbow Brothers used to be able
[1:57:42] to hug their brothers necks amen but now
[1:57:44] they avoid them sisters used to be a
[1:57:47] brother Luther it might just be me and
[1:57:49] you time I get done they used to be able
[1:57:51] to hug their sisters but now they got
[1:57:53] spirituals right what can I go on I
[1:57:55] found out brother Joe some people got in
[1:57:57] their shoulder man when they first got
[1:57:59] saved brother Jason every sermon he
[1:58:01] preached was the most powerful sermon
[1:58:02] they raised their hand I mean they they
[1:58:05] were waving their hand they were
[1:58:06] praising God they were pumping fists
[1:58:08] preaching brother but give them a little
[1:58:10] time they memorized some quotes they
[1:58:12] went through a few things they didn't
[1:58:13] like about brother Jason and now that
[1:58:15] spiritual arthritis has gotten their
[1:58:17] shoulder but occasionally they get
[1:58:19] temporary healings when a Vista comes
[1:58:21] through and then they can raise it up
[1:58:22] but come Wednesday night
[1:58:25] it'll show back up and they won't be
[1:58:27] able to race amen but then I found out
[1:58:28] there's another place it is it gotten
[1:58:30] their knees
[1:58:32] they used to be able to stand up when
[1:58:34] the preacher preached amen but now they
[1:58:36] complain because other people stand up
[1:58:37] it's because she got spiritual arthritis
[1:58:40] well I might as well keep on going I
[1:58:42] found out they got it in their ankles
[1:58:44] they used to shout and dance and enjoy
[1:58:46] the blessings of God Amen but it's been
[1:58:49] 50 years since they stood up it's been
[1:58:51] 50 years since they danced it's been 20
[1:58:53] years since they shouted amen but if
[1:58:55] Jesus Christ the son of God can go into
[1:58:58] a meeting and heal somebody of natural
[1:59:00] arthritis then I propose to you vessel
[1:59:03] Tabernacle that that same Lord Jesus has
[1:59:06] come in this church tonight and he is
[1:59:08] here to heal spiritual arthritis I say
[1:59:11] it ought to leave our hands in order to
[1:59:13] leave our Harms in ought to leave our
[1:59:15] feet I say bring back celebrity I say
[1:59:18] bling back to Joy bring back the unity
[1:59:20] bring back the fellowship
[1:59:24] but your mouse must stand up and put
[1:59:27] your foot on that devil
[1:59:29] said put your foot on that devil but
[1:59:31] then I can't but sometimes you just
[1:59:33] gotta stand up and put your foot on that
[1:59:35] brother Aaron how do you do it you just
[1:59:37] kind of stand up and put your foot on
[1:59:38] Brad how do you do it you just kind of

[1:59:46] some of you all and I'm giving you an
[1:59:48] opportunity right now by the word to
[1:59:51] stand up on your feet and put that devil
[1:59:53] under his
[1:59:54] [Applause]
[1:59:56] put him in his position
[1:59:59] put that table under your feet come on
[2:00:02] musicians I'm done push that devil back
[2:00:04] in this place it's the hour of Jubilee
[2:00:09] y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[2:00:11] you serve that never long enough
[2:00:14] it's time to put him back in his place
[2:00:21] put your foot on that devil
[2:00:27] that was nervous but just kind of put
[2:00:30] your foot on him
[2:00:33] he's defeated
[2:00:34] if you want the quotes I'll send them to
[2:00:36] you but I'm giving you prophetic
[2:00:37] instructions
[2:00:39] he said stomp on that devil
[2:00:42] you know what he called it
[2:00:44] he called it imaginary things
[2:00:47] he said stomp on him look it up
[2:00:49] another I found brother Jason
[2:00:51] he said it's unreasonable fault
[2:00:55] stomp on them
[2:00:57] now listen
[2:00:58] I know this is simple but it's coming
[2:01:00] from a heart
[2:01:02] it's the hour of Jubilee
[2:01:05] you've been a perfect slave to those
[2:01:07] unreasonable thoughts long enough
[2:01:13] now listen
[2:01:14] I know what I'm talking about
[2:01:16] unreasonable thought
[2:01:18] s that say I'll never be good enough
[2:01:22] thoughts that say you know
[2:01:24] brother Jason I have no inheritance
[2:01:27] I guess this is the future of my family
[2:01:29] and this is the future of my life
[2:01:32] but I propose to you tonight Church
[2:01:35] that's an unreasonable thought
[2:01:38] and you've got a right to put your foot
[2:01:39] on it
[2:01:42] you've been anointed by the word of
[2:01:43] Jubilee
[2:01:45] put your foot on it
[2:01:49] anybody won't see that devil get back in
[2:01:51] this position
[2:01:54] you remember what it was like
[2:01:58] you remember what it was like before you
[2:02:00] had spiritual arthritis
[2:02:03] couldn't nobody sing a bad song
[2:02:08] ever Sherman was the best
[2:02:11] ever meat was the best
[2:02:14] then you got a little something
[2:02:16] and listen I know what I'm talking about
[2:02:19] because we go through things
[2:02:21] and if we don't deal with them we
[2:02:23] accumulate them
[2:02:24] and then 20 years down the road we're
[2:02:26] still serving them thinking we're free
[2:02:29] but you know what happens there Comes A
[2:02:31] Time
[2:02:32] you gotta buried
[2:02:35] Comes A Time you gotta let it go
[2:02:39] sh I said to you like this
[2:02:45] who the sun is set free
[2:02:49] who the word has set free
[2:02:52] is free indeed
[2:02:54] I know right now you may say brother I
[2:02:56] don't feel like I'm free I don't care if
[2:02:58] you feel like you are or not
[2:03:00] the word
[2:03:02] is greater than my feelings
[2:03:05] the word is greater than the way I sense
[2:03:07] things are going
[2:03:09] the word declares you're free
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] I was in a meeting something like this
[2:03:15] a few years ago I was in
[2:03:17] church and there was a
[2:03:19] there was a sister come up for prayer
[2:03:22] she was an elderly sister and she come
[2:03:24] up and she said with Andrew she said
[2:03:26] a couple years ago I lost my husband
[2:03:28] she said when I did
[2:03:30] she said me and my daughter we had
[2:03:31] crosswords and she said she's the only
[2:03:33] daughter of God only child I've got left
[2:03:35] she said and ever since then
[2:03:38] she said we've not spoken we've not
[2:03:40] shaken hands or nothing for two years
[2:03:43] he said she said we just been distant I
[2:03:45] said really she said
[2:03:47] she said and something happened in my
[2:03:48] life 50 years ago
[2:03:50] she said that still torments me to this
[2:03:52] day she said and so adding that on top
[2:03:55] of this is this okay
[2:03:57] she said add that on top of this she
[2:03:59] said it's come to a spot she said where
[2:04:02] I can't even enjoy my salvation anymore
[2:04:06] she said I need help and brother Brad
[2:04:09] I have no power of my own
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] but I took these hands and just laid
[2:04:14] them over on her head
[2:04:16] and I began to speak the word over her
[2:04:18] life
[2:04:18] begin to say since the word says who the
[2:04:21] sun is set free it's free I said is it
[2:04:23] on the bus you said brother and send the
[2:04:24] blood
[2:04:25] I said that I believe right now the Lord
[2:04:27] can take that thing that you've been
[2:04:28] serving for 50 years totally dismiss it
[2:04:32] put you in a position you can heal this
[2:04:34] situation with your daughter and you can
[2:04:36] move forward
[2:04:37] I got done praying the spirit Lord
[2:04:39] dropped on the lady the pastor is down
[2:04:41] there with us she was speaking in
[2:04:43] tongues rejoicing I'm free I'm free and
[2:04:45] about that time another lady walks up
[2:04:48] his brother Andrew she said two years
[2:04:50] ago
[2:04:51] she said my mom and I had a fallen out
[2:04:53] she said we ain't talked in two years
[2:04:55] I said
[2:04:56] really she said yeah she said dad died
[2:04:58] something happened she said we ain't
[2:05:00] talked in two years I said well do you
[2:05:02] believe the Lord can heal that right now
[2:05:03] and you'll go make it right she said I
[2:05:05] will as soon as I can I said now when
[2:05:07] you get out of church I said God it
[2:05:09] never dawned on me brother Brad
[2:05:10] I said when you get out of church just
[2:05:12] go call her up make it right so I
[2:05:14] started praying for her Lord hit her
[2:05:16] brother Jason I walked back up on the
[2:05:18] platform and I turned around I looked
[2:05:20] over and the woman was hugging the young
[2:05:22] lady and she was hugging and the pastor
[2:05:24] come by and said that's mother and
[2:05:25] daughter they've been at odds for two
[2:05:26] years
[2:05:29] but in a presence of the word
[2:05:33] the word just dropped in the room
[2:05:35] and released her
[2:05:37] listen friends you're not slaves to
[2:05:39] things in your past

[2:06:03] in the face and said don't you ever
[2:06:05] touch me again

[2:46:45] systems of man can't give you Jubilee it
[2:46:48] takes the family of God with the word of
[2:46:50] God brother random said that that a seal
[2:46:53] has something bound up on the inside and
[2:46:56] he said when that seal is broken it
[2:46:58] releases that word on the inside and

[2:47:03] word to make it live inside your life

[2:47:27] could quite understand a puzzled over
[2:47:30] that statement brother Brandon would say
[2:47:31] he would say now see God had a thought
[2:47:35] but but then God had to speak
[2:47:37] and then when he spoke then it became a
[2:47:40] reality
[2:47:40] see he says and then he comes down he
[2:47:42] says now that's like you he says God can
[2:47:45] give you a thought now how many here
[2:47:46] tonight had the Lord speaking to them
[2:47:48] see but but but he says but it's but
[2:47:51] it's just a thought
[2:47:52] until you speak it Hallelujah
[2:47:56] he said just like Moses he said Moses
[2:47:59] went down there and the Lord said speak
[2:48:00] and said raise your stick out over that
[2:48:03] Red Sea
[2:48:04] Raise Your Rod Moses brother Branham
