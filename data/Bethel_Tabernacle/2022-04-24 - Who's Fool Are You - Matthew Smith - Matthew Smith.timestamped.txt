[3:11] they would have an open heart and open
[3:12] ears and anointed ears to hear the word
[3:15] that you'd be able to take
[3:16] this little sunday school thought just
[3:18] this little teaching and and
[3:20] give them some ammunition to fight the
[3:22] devil with and they would be able to
[3:24] sharpen their sword a little bit
[3:25] and father we asked that you would
[3:28] be with us and
[3:29] and uh
[3:30] north of service services going forward
[3:32] that we'd invite you and we to create an
[3:33] atmosphere through the through the
[3:34] hearing of the word this morning and
[3:36] into the song service that when the
[3:38] preaching would come that we would have
[3:40] open hearts and be blessed and have the
[3:42] food that we need for this day and for
[3:44] this week going forward we ask these
[3:45] things in jesus name amen
[3:48] y'all can be seated
[3:53] so
[3:58] i wanted one of the things that has
[4:00] caught me um this i guess about the last
[4:03] week one of the things that y'all
[4:05] probably heard about is
[4:06] um it's been all over the news you know
[4:08] elon musk is trying to buy twitter
[4:10] right uh what is it 45 billion dollars
[4:14] is and he already spent nine billion on
[4:16] on twitter um
[4:19] and i was trying to spend another 45
[4:20] billion and it's
[4:22] you know i was just thinking about how
[4:25] crazy it is that you have all these
[4:26] social media companies that
[4:29] are worth untold billions of dollars i
[4:31] don't remember exactly what um
[4:33] facebook and youtube are worth but it's
[4:35] some astronomical amount of money um
[4:39] and
[4:43] everybody seems to you know the the
[4:44] whole new cycle all of society is so
[4:46] invested in the goings-on on social
[4:48] media
[4:50] you know the you know political
[4:51] positions that you know mark zuckerberg
[4:53] is going to take or you know his
[4:55] appearances before congress or whatever
[4:58] this is all very important
[4:59] to the entire news cycle anytime
[5:01] something like this happens everybody's
[5:03] involved in it
[5:05] and they're worth so much money um
[5:08] you know
[5:09] the which which kind of on its face is a
[5:12] little bit odd that you would have
[5:15] companies like say twitter that's worth
[5:17] again
[5:18] 50 plus billion dollars
[5:20] and its entire business model is letting
[5:24] people use it for free
[5:26] and so that you know you can
[5:29] send rude text to strangers on the
[5:31] internet um
[5:32] but like it's this free service and and
[5:35] and you know same thing with facebook
[5:38] how are these companies worth billions
[5:40] and billions of dollars
[5:42] when their entire user base doesn't pay
[5:44] a nickel
[5:45] right you have what was it um like
[5:47] facebook has over a billion users
[5:50] and nobody pays a dime for it
[5:53] well
[5:54] you know and not only that but then you
[5:56] have stuff like google right
[5:58] google is one of the largest most widely
[6:01] used services on the planet just a
[6:03] google search
[6:04] and again nobody pays a dime for it um
[6:06] and not that's that's just on the face
[6:08] of it
[6:09] most of y'all are using google and don't
[6:11] don't even realize it because you're
[6:12] using things like their their back-end
[6:14] infrastructure like server processing or
[6:17] you know
[6:18] and like security certificates and
[6:20] things like that most of the websites
[6:21] you go to are using google in some form
[6:23] or another even if they have nothing to
[6:24] do with google
[6:25] um and that's all free you don't pay
[6:27] anything for it yet it is a service that
[6:28] you're using and so you have to wonder
[6:31] why how are these companies worth all
[6:33] this money yet most of the people using
[6:35] it
[6:36] aren't paying anything
[6:39] right
[6:40] well
[6:41] a long time ago um i believe was the ceo
[6:45] of google actually
[6:47] made a really profound statement
[6:50] in reference to all of this and i'm sure
[6:52] some of y'all might have heard it and he
[6:54] said
[6:55] if you're getting anything for free
[6:57] you're not the customer you're the
[6:58] product
[7:00] okay
[7:01] so
[7:03] facebook
[7:05] when you're on facebook you know
[7:06] scrolling through your news feed being
[7:07] mad mad at strangers on the internet
[7:10] the
[7:10] [Music]
[7:12] you're not facebook's customer
[7:14] right you are the product that facebook
[7:16] is selling to their actual customers
[7:18] who are
[7:19] advertisers and
[7:23] you know whoever is promoting their
[7:24] products usually a product though
[7:26] sometimes you get political campaigns or
[7:28] you know political advertising things
[7:30] like that
[7:31] through whatever social media company
[7:33] and
[7:35] facebook you know it's funny to me a lot
[7:38] of people
[7:39] um
[7:40] get you know upset at various social
[7:42] media companies because their policies
[7:44] and oh well you're censoring me or you
[7:46] know you're
[7:47] you know you have some stance or you
[7:49] know on some particular issue
[7:52] and everyone gets all mad and upset but
[7:54] facebook doesn't care because you're not
[7:56] their customer right you're just a
[7:58] product to them and there's many more
[8:00] like you
[8:02] so
[8:03] what facebook or or twitter or whoever
[8:06] social media
[8:07] what they're what they're
[8:09] aiming at is to get people to become
[8:12] addicted to their pro to what they're
[8:14] actually selling right
[8:16] you know there's a lot of of work that
[8:19] goes into
[8:21] psychological manipulation a lot of
[8:23] people don't really think about this but
[8:25] it absolutely happens facebook employs
[8:28] thousands and not just facebook but any
[8:30] social media company everything from
[8:33] you know twitter to
[8:34] pinterest anything they're going to hire
[8:37] psychologists who are going to engineer
[8:40] they they very meticulously engineer
[8:42] that user interface to become addictive
[8:45] right
[8:46] um
[8:47] you know youtube recently removed the
[8:49] dislike bar
[8:50] i don't know if you all are familiar
[8:52] with that but it shows how many people
[8:54] dislike the video well
[8:56] why do they do that
[8:58] it has to do with
[9:00] psychologists are saying well if people
[9:02] are seeing this video the dislikes on
[9:04] this video it's going to affect them
[9:06] negatively and they're not going to want
[9:07] to watch it so they're going to be less
[9:08] likely to click something else right
[9:10] there it's it's an engineered
[9:13] in the entire environment that you're in
[9:15] when you when you're entering a social
[9:17] media environment is engineered to get
[9:19] you to keep scrolling get you to keep
[9:20] watching whatever it is because every
[9:23] time
[9:25] you know the auto player you click next
[9:27] video on youtube you get another ad
[9:30] you know with some
[9:31] you know weird dude and a pet emu trying
[9:33] to sell you car insurance or whatever
[9:35] like this is
[9:37] you know they're
[9:38] the whole idea is every time they're
[9:40] getting you to click
[9:41] they're pulling you in so they're gonna
[9:42] get you addicted to this and it's not
[9:44] just social media um you know they've
[9:47] they've done some studies with social
[9:49] like facebook in particular and also
[9:51] twitter where when you're getting likes
[9:52] on your posts your brain releases
[9:54] dopamine
[9:55] right it's a little hit a dopamine it
[9:56] makes you feel good it's feel-good
[9:58] chemicals these are the same feel-good
[9:59] chemicals that heroin produce by the way
[10:02] right it literally creates an addictive
[10:04] cycle and they know that and they're
[10:06] getting you addicted because the longer
[10:07] you stay there the longer you're
[10:09] invested in their platform
[10:12] the more you're going to
[10:14] uh you know keep hitting their ad
[10:15] revenue or whatever
[10:17] now
[10:18] it kind of goes beyond that though so i
[10:20] wanted to um i saw some headlines these
[10:23] are older headlines this is from about
[10:25] 2012 2014.
[10:28] um
[10:30] and this is so here's one from newsweek
[10:32] this is from 2014 it says uh talking
[10:34] about how facebook performed a
[10:36] psychology experiment on thousands of
[10:38] users without telling them
[10:40] right well because when you sign that
[10:41] terms of service somewhere buried in
[10:42] that 10 000 page document that nobody
[10:44] reads is a
[10:47] basically psychology
[10:49] psychological experimentation consent
[10:51] form that you just check your your name
[10:53] next to and they get to run all kinds of
[10:55] experiments on you
[10:57] in this particular instance they were
[10:59] manipulating people's news feeds to give
[11:01] them
[11:02] happy content or sad content and get and
[11:05] affect their actual mood
[11:07] right they can do that
[11:10] you know hiding happy news from your
[11:12] friends and showing you sad news or news
[11:14] articles or whatever
[11:15] um
[11:16] the uh another one this is from nature
[11:18] by the way nature's a in case any of you
[11:20] have not heard of it about it nature is
[11:22] a problem with the top scientific
[11:24] journals on the planet
[11:26] um uh
[11:28] where facebook published their data
[11:30] um showing that they were able to
[11:33] uh boost voter turnout
[11:36] through
[11:37] editing you know putting notifications
[11:39] on people's timelines
[11:40] okay
[11:41] so it's not so now we're starting to see
[11:43] wait a minute it's not just advertising
[11:46] you know when it's just people selling
[11:47] you car insurance is not that big of a
[11:48] deal but you got to realize the same
[11:51] techniques the same technology that will
[11:53] get you to open your wallet and pay for
[11:56] car insurance is the same thing that'll
[11:57] get you to vote a certain way
[11:59] it's really what it is and it's so
[12:02] mundane and it's so common to us we
[12:04] don't really think about it but what
[12:05] advertising is these especially when it
[12:07] comes to social media advertising
[12:09] because they know
[12:11] your habits they know your daily cycle
[12:13] they can track you through your phone
[12:15] and know where you're going
[12:17] i recently saw i don't have it down here
[12:19] but there was a headline where
[12:22] facebook talked about how they know
[12:24] your daily routines
[12:27] um and and when you're doing what every
[12:29] day and when you know if you have a
[12:31] routine they know what you're doing
[12:32] every day and they can and they will
[12:34] custom feed you notifications to check
[12:37] your facebook
[12:38] depending on what time of you know day
[12:40] it is they know when you're most
[12:42] susceptible to kind of get hooked on it
[12:44] for 15 20 30 minutes or whatever
[12:46] and not do your work um
[12:49] and
[12:50] there was and so they know people really
[12:52] really well we i've all had that weird
[12:54] experience of talking about something
[12:56] with somebody and then you open facebook
[12:58] and there's six ads for the thing that
[13:00] you were talking about even though
[13:01] you've never searched that thing
[13:02] right it's really bizarre some people
[13:04] like while they're they're listening
[13:06] through your phone which they might be
[13:07] though i have heard some stuff from an
[13:09] actual google engineer where he talked
[13:10] about actually no listening to your
[13:12] conversations would be harder than what
[13:14] we actually do
[13:15] because they can
[13:17] through massive amounts of data
[13:19] collection they can get way more
[13:20] accurate than just listening to your to
[13:22] your conversations
[13:24] an example of that
[13:25] is a one that some of you might have
[13:27] also heard about is
[13:29] incident with target
[13:32] the headline reads how target figured
[13:35] out a teen girl was pregnant before her
[13:37] father did
[13:38] okay now if you read that article um
[13:41] they did this because they tracked the
[13:43] buying habits of pregnant women who they
[13:45] knew they were pregnant because they
[13:46] signed on to their baby registry through
[13:48] target
[13:48] right well they tracked all their buying
[13:51] habits
[13:52] across hundreds of thousands of women
[13:55] you know because they were all linked to
[13:56] their target account or email or
[13:57] whatever
[13:58] and then
[14:00] through that data they were able to
[14:02] predict anyone else who wasn't on the
[14:04] registry who was also falling in those
[14:06] buying patterns they could predict that
[14:07] they were
[14:09] pregnant
[14:10] and so
[14:11] this the story is a guy start his
[14:14] daughter's 16 year old daughter starts
[14:15] getting ads in the mail for
[14:18] baby stuff and he goes into target all
[14:20] upset like why are you trying to like
[14:22] influence my daughter to get pregnant
[14:24] and like well i'm sorry sir you know i
[14:25] don't know what's going on well then
[14:27] come to find out the man ends up talking
[14:28] to the manager later and apologizes
[14:30] actually turns out there's been some
[14:32] stuff going on that i didn't know about
[14:33] and i'm really sorry
[14:35] right how do they know that well
[14:37] funnily enough um they actually go into
[14:40] how they did this specifically one of
[14:42] the things that they noticed was the
[14:44] increase in purchase of unscented lotion
[14:47] for all of you ladies who were
[14:49] interested
[14:50] um that literally that was that was the
[14:52] number one indicator there was three or
[14:54] four indicators that target said that
[14:56] one of the main ones was the the
[14:58] increase in purchase rat like dramatic
[15:00] increase in purchase of unscented lotion
[15:02] accompanied with a couple other things
[15:03] meant that they had an 86
[15:05] likelihood of guessing that any given
[15:07] woman was pregnant
[15:09] so
[15:11] this is they know you better than you do
[15:14] right
[15:15] they know you're right and so
[15:19] when they have that kind of power over
[15:21] you
[15:22] when they they know you that well
[15:24] they're going to control you if they if
[15:27] they know when you're pregnant before
[15:29] you do i guarantee you they know how to
[15:32] addict you to their device
[15:34] um i've seen the same thing in and we
[15:36] kind of think it's kind of unimportant
[15:38] but those little mobile games that
[15:40] people get on their phones well you
[15:42] spend any amount of time looking at the
[15:44] psychology literature on those so
[15:46] they're actually what they are is
[15:47] something called a skinner box
[15:50] which is actually somebody some guy's
[15:51] last name but basically it's a little
[15:54] mechanism that gets people to feel good
[15:57] every time they basically push a button
[15:59] and it gets you addicted and that's why
[16:00] people you know start playing angry
[16:02] birds or whatever and then it's 30
[16:03] minutes an hour later and they don't
[16:05] know where their time went it's because
[16:06] they're getting a little dopamine hit
[16:08] every couple of seconds
[16:10] and they're just going to keep doing it
[16:11] over and over again well again every
[16:13] time you get that little dopamine hit
[16:15] you're also getting it in conjunction
[16:16] with
[16:18] buying car insurance
[16:20] right
[16:21] and so
[16:22] this is
[16:23] how
[16:24] the entire media industry especially
[16:26] social media it's all driven by the
[16:28] ability to control people now it's
[16:31] again we think it's kind of funny like
[16:33] like not unimportant because it's
[16:35] advertising it's buying car insurance or
[16:38] headphones or a new car or whatever
[16:41] but again
[16:42] if they can do that they can get you to
[16:44] do a lot of other stuff too
[16:46] right they need you to vote a certain
[16:47] way and i i guarantee you there's people
[16:50] paying a whole lot of money for the
[16:51] ability to control how you vote
[16:54] okay
[16:55] and so
[16:57] they they control and again because it
[17:00] becomes addictive
[17:01] they own a lot more real estate in your
[17:03] mind than people give them credit for
[17:06] right and so i wanted to read jump to um
[17:12] uh
[17:13] see here
[17:14] scripture revelations chapter 18.
[17:26] and so again i just want to again
[17:28] emphasize this point advertising
[17:31] it might seem like an insignificant
[17:33] version of it but advertising at its
[17:35] core is a form of mind control
[17:37] it is a mind control program that's what
[17:40] it's for
[17:41] um
[17:43] to always get you thinking about one
[17:44] thing or other again it might be
[17:46] something insignificant like car
[17:47] insurance but they're still getting you
[17:48] to think about car insurance
[17:50] um
[17:52] so revelations chapter uh 18 verse
[17:56] 11 through 13.
[17:58] um and so a little bit of context for
[17:59] this scripture is
[18:01] um
[18:03] this is babylon has fallen in brother
[18:05] braham describes how the the um
[18:08] vatican is bombed in this chapter and
[18:10] how all the it's it's all the merchants
[18:11] of the world lamenting
[18:13] babylon being destroyed okay
[18:15] and it says
[18:16] um and the merchants of the earth shall
[18:19] weep and mourn over her for no man
[18:21] buyeth her merchandise anymore the
[18:23] merchandise of gold and silver and
[18:25] precious stones
[18:27] and of pearls and fine linen and purple
[18:29] and silk and scarlet and all thine wood
[18:32] and all manner
[18:34] vessels of ivory in all manner vessels
[18:36] of most precious wood and of brass and
[18:38] iron and marble and cinnamon and odors
[18:41] and ointments and frankincense and wine
[18:43] and oil and fine flour and wheat and
[18:46] beasts and sheep and horses and chariots
[18:48] and slaves and the souls of men
[18:52] that here's the book of revelations
[18:54] predicting that in the end times the
[18:56] business world would be able to buy and
[18:58] sell the souls of men
[19:02] right now attach that to facebook and
[19:04] twitter and instagram and all that right
[19:07] they're
[19:08] you know
[19:10] you you think well how is car insurance
[19:12] getting someone to you know
[19:13] how is that selling somebody's soul well
[19:17] it's not just insurance it's the fact
[19:19] that
[19:20] there was a recent poll where they they
[19:21] looked at young people and they said
[19:23] that the the grand aspiration that the
[19:26] vast majority of teenagers have nowadays
[19:28] is not to be an astronaut or a scientist
[19:30] or whatever it's to be a social media
[19:31] influencer
[19:33] right all the this entire new generation
[19:36] of people their entire goals dreams and
[19:38] aspirations is to be part of the social
[19:40] media world
[19:42] right i mean that sounds a whole lot
[19:43] like they're they're owning people's
[19:45] souls to me
[19:46] right and they're and so they're going
[19:47] to go in that entire direction
[19:49] their whole life is going to be attached
[19:51] to that look at again and i'm including
[19:54] myself in this too when i say the
[19:55] younger generation
[19:56] my generation of people it's when you're
[19:59] when you were raised in a world where
[20:01] everybody had a smartphone and everybody
[20:02] had an internet connection and you could
[20:05] literally spend 18 hours a day
[20:07] hooked up to whatever
[20:09] you know whatever media platform or
[20:11] gaming platform you want they pretty
[20:13] much own you at that point
[20:15] right i mean kids will
[20:18] when you i've seen this myself when you
[20:21] walk into a room of
[20:23] 10 year olds
[20:26] and mention fortnite and they all start
[20:29] dancing
[20:31] that's bizarre
[20:33] and it tells you something about what's
[20:35] going on there
[20:36] right
[20:37] and i i
[20:39] sure you're giving me a look because you
[20:41] know exactly what i'm talking about
[20:43] right it's it's really bizarre
[20:46] this is the
[20:49] anyway so
[20:50] moving on from that
[20:52] um
[20:53] i don't want to get hung up on that
[20:55] because this is because i want to get to
[20:56] my what i'm actually trying to get at
[20:57] and that is
[20:59] god has advertising too right there's
[21:03] this is a a quote from let your line uh
[21:05] so shine before men
[21:07] for the random talking about a billboard
[21:08] i'm sure many of you have probably heard
[21:09] about heard this quote before we're
[21:11] talking about the billboard that just
[21:12] says hungry on it right
[21:13] um and so this is kind of where he's
[21:15] coming from this he says and we know um
[21:18] that the day that we live in it pays to
[21:20] advertise and we find out that these
[21:22] people who are making such big progress
[21:23] in business are great men of
[21:24] advertisement they put it on television
[21:26] they smear it on boards everywhere they
[21:28] can to advertise their products smoke
[21:30] this one not a coffin a carload and a
[21:33] thinking demand filter and some other
[21:34] man's taste or something like that
[21:37] and stay lively longer with their beer
[21:39] and all stuff like that it's
[21:41] advertisement and they write off a lot
[21:43] of their income tax just for
[21:44] advertisement and it certainly pays off
[21:47] so if it pays off
[21:49] for that i begin to think then why won't
[21:52] christianity pay off its if it's
[21:55] advertised well i thought then what is
[21:58] advertisement you've got to have
[22:00] something that is a little different
[22:01] from what the rest of them has got or if
[22:03] it's just so common like the things the
[22:05] world it'll never attract the attention
[22:07] of the people now if a man had been
[22:09] looking for an automobile he would went
[22:12] on past that sign but if he'd been
[22:14] hungry he'd been looking for that sign
[22:16] so i believe the christian is god's
[22:18] billboard i believe that each one of us
[22:21] is god's billboard and we don't have to
[22:23] do so much carrying on about it as we do
[22:27] just simply live a life that'll make the
[22:29] people hungry to be like you
[22:31] now
[22:33] the natural types of spiritual and the
[22:35] modern advertising scheme is one of
[22:39] mind control
[22:41] well that tells us something right
[22:43] god's interested in controlling your
[22:45] mind too
[22:46] right there's a
[22:48] and
[22:51] there's
[22:52] we are the entire christian experience
[22:54] is based around the idea that there is
[22:57] something free right salvation's free
[23:00] you don't pay a nickel for it
[23:02] well
[23:02] if you're getting something for free
[23:04] you're not the customer you're the
[23:06] product
[23:08] who's the customer in the world of
[23:10] salvation god is god paid the price
[23:12] christ paid the price for your
[23:13] redemption you're not the customer
[23:15] you're the product
[23:17] and
[23:18] with that
[23:19] under that
[23:20] that idea
[23:23] god's kind of trying to control your
[23:24] mind if you're the product of of
[23:26] salvation
[23:28] then god is interested in controlling
[23:29] what you're thinking about your hopes
[23:30] your dreams your ambitions
[23:33] um
[23:34] not only that but
[23:35] people again remember i mentioned that
[23:37] people get all upset about facebook and
[23:38] all these these different companies and
[23:40] their business practices but facebook
[23:42] doesn't care what you think
[23:43] right because you're not their customers
[23:46] if if i'm have a donut stand and some
[23:50] guy walks up to me who's deathly
[23:51] allergic to donuts and is like i don't
[23:54] like your donuts i'm boycotting you
[23:56] i don't care you weren't going to buy my
[23:58] donuts to begin with
[24:00] so
[24:02] likewise
[24:03] facebook and and
[24:05] to add on to that if i don't care what
[24:07] that guy thinks about my donuts i
[24:09] certainly don't care what the donut
[24:10] thinks about
[24:11] you know what the donut's opinion is
[24:14] likewise facebook doesn't care about
[24:15] your opinion any more than i would care
[24:17] about a donut's opinion because they're
[24:18] both products right
[24:21] and
[24:23] on top of that if the donut doesn't get
[24:25] an opinion in the on in the owner the
[24:27] donut stand then you don't really have
[24:29] much of an opini you don't really have
[24:31] much of an opinion on god and what god
[24:34] is doing
[24:35] right if if salve if you're not if you
[24:38] are not the
[24:40] customer in the scenario god is you
[24:42] don't get a say in how salvation works
[24:45] right people
[24:46] i wrote this down
[24:48] people get so entitled about
[24:49] christianity and the way
[24:52] things work
[24:53] but you're not the customer you didn't
[24:55] decide any of this
[24:56] right
[24:57] um you know people want
[24:59] convenient crucifixion
[25:02] right and then i'm not talking about
[25:04] like christ crucifixion i'm talking
[25:05] about your own crucifixion right are you
[25:07] carrying your cross and and people will
[25:09] be well it's not convenient to be a
[25:11] christian well of course it's not but
[25:13] then again you're not
[25:15] you're not supposed like this isn't for
[25:18] you necessarily right
[25:21] you know you don't you don't get amazon
[25:22] prime amazing grace
[25:24] that's not
[25:25] that's not how that works god is not a
[25:27] drive-through deity and it's not gonna
[25:29] work that way
[25:31] right you have to
[25:34] we have to not be so self-entitled when
[25:36] it comes to christianity and
[25:40] salvation
[25:41] because guess what god's gonna require
[25:43] some things of you
[25:45] um and it's not gonna be for your
[25:47] convenience
[25:50] there was a um but there's kind of a
[25:53] a
[25:55] good you know that sounds a little bit
[25:57] harsh but there's a there's a a good
[25:59] aspect to that and that is that
[26:01] the product isn't necessarily
[26:03] responsible for what it is
[26:05] right so
[26:08] give you an example if i you know say
[26:10] there's some guy right he's a
[26:12] old auto mechanic and he likes fixing up
[26:14] old cars and he goes and finds some old
[26:16] beaten down classic car that's all
[26:18] mangled and rotten in some old barn
[26:20] somewhere
[26:22] excuse me and he buys that car it's not
[26:24] the car's fault that it's is the way it
[26:26] is
[26:27] and it's not the car's fault to do
[26:29] anything with it like it's not the car's
[26:31] responsibility all that car has to do is
[26:34] let that mechanic work on it
[26:36] right the the mechanic is gonna pull it
[26:38] apart clean all the junk out of it clean
[26:40] it up put a new coat of paint on it fix
[26:42] the engine up get all the burden s out
[26:43] of it and make it run and he's slowly
[26:46] gonna
[26:47] you know clean that car up and go back
[26:48] with all original parts and it's gonna
[26:50] be just like it was when it rolled off
[26:52] the showroom floor
[26:54] eventually
[26:56] and it's not going to be the car's job
[26:57] to do that
[26:59] it's just you the car's only job
[27:02] is to surrender to the mechanic because
[27:04] it's not the customer it has no
[27:07] responsibility in that
[27:09] the only responsibility it has is not
[27:12] uh
[27:14] not being a hindrance and just simply
[27:16] yielding itself to the hand of of that
[27:18] which can restore it
[27:21] so i think uh
[27:23] we're uh out of time for today
[27:25] and um
[27:26] we'll stand and have a word of prayer
[27:32] lord thank you for this opportunity to
[27:34] speak to your people and ask that you
[27:36] would bless the words that have gone out
[27:37] and that they would anoint the people's
[27:38] hearts and if there would be anything
[27:40] that could help them that they would
[27:41] take it to heart and
[27:42] be able to use it in the days going
[27:44] forward and use it for the furthering of
[27:46] your kingdom father that we would not be
[27:48] so
[27:49] hung up on our own desires and and what
[27:51] we would need but that would be
[27:52] surrendered to you and how you would
[27:54] want to work on us and and and perfect
[27:56] us father we ask these things in your
[27:58] heavenly name jesus christ amen
[28:57] you
[29:59] [Music]
[32:40] [Music]
[32:47] [Music]
[32:59] you
