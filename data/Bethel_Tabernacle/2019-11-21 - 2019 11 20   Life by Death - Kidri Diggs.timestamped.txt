[34:30] the Galatians the second chapter a man
[34:34] praise God chapter 2 let's just read um
[35:05] Galatians chapter 2 lists this reverse
[35:10] nineteen for I through the law am dead
[35:18] to the law that I might live unto God I
[35:23] am crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[35:26] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[35:31] and the life which I now live in the
[35:35] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[35:38] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[35:43] I do not frustrate the grace of God for
[35:46] I for if righteousness come by the law
[35:51] then Christ is dead in vain amen I just
[35:57] love that scripture praise the Lord
[35:59] let's let's go to UM Philippians chapter
[36:04] 1 you probably pick up or catch up where
[36:12] I'm going tonight by these scriptures
[36:16] Philippians 1
[36:28] Philippians chapter 1 let's start
[36:31] reading at verse 20 according to my
[36:36] earnest expectation and my hope that in
[36:39] nothing I shall be ashamed but that
[36:42] which all boldness as always so now also
[36:47] Christ shall be magnified in my body
[36:50] whether it be by life or by death for to
[36:56] me to live is Christ and to die is gain
[37:00] a mail order bless reading of His Word
[37:03] you can have your seats by the grace of
[37:05] God amen tonight my subject is a
[37:14] familiar subject but I just pray that
[37:16] God just you know make make it alive to
[37:19] us tonight
[37:20] you know I was I was I was here some
[37:23] some some weeks ago and brought Jason
[37:26] made a statement you know I was thinking
[37:27] about it coming down the road it is some
[37:29] about 95 95 you clear your mind you know
[37:33] and God just talks to you while you're
[37:35] going down that long highway but anyway
[37:38] you know I was thinking about the
[37:39] thought when he says he loves that
[37:40] message that day on Calvary you know and
[37:43] how thick and jam-packed that message is
[37:48] but the greatest thing about that is to
[37:51] get the revelation of Calvary and what
[37:54] it means to you as an individual you
[37:57] know tonight I just pray that God will
[37:59] shed some light on it but my subject is
[38:01] life by death amen
[38:04] life by death you know and that's the
[38:07] question that a lot of people have you
[38:09] know do we live after we die is there
[38:12] life after death and church even in in
[38:16] in in natural things that statement is
[38:20] made alive you know because sometimes we
[38:23] look at natural things we can see the
[38:25] rebirth of things or or the coming forth
[38:28] of the Resurrection in natural things
[38:31] but you know when we think about the
[38:34] death of Christ and
[38:35] what it means to you and I you know in
[38:39] him given his life he who knew no sin
[38:42] became sin so that we could become his
[38:45] righteousness why did he do that because
[38:48] we were on our way to a death of no
[38:51] redemption
[38:52] so God came he made a way that even if
[38:56] you die you still live
[38:59] hallelujah you know and that's what we
[39:02] call grace even though you deserve death
[39:04] God gives us life and you know church if
[39:07] I could just start in the natural room
[39:09] and how we look at the cycle of life and
[39:12] how did you know the prophet made a
[39:13] statement and he's saying you know he
[39:16] was talking to a doctor and he asked the
[39:18] doctor he said doc I can't I won't
[39:21] understand this he says as long as I eat
[39:23] right I drink right I put the right
[39:26] things in my body that it will produce
[39:28] more cells for me to live and the
[39:31] doctors like yes sir that's right he
[39:33] says well how come I'm constantly dying
[39:35] every day and see that is the attribute
[39:39] of death but the power of the cross
[39:43] hallelujah
[39:43] the power of Jesus Christ is life it
[39:47] changed that forever hallelujah once he
[39:50] died haruya even though your natural
[39:54] body may be dying your spirit man will
[39:57] live how your soul will live forever
[40:00] under the redemption of his name
[40:02] hallelujah but you know when you look at
[40:05] that particular statement of you know we
[40:07] all try to eat healthy within that day
[40:10] when everybody's on a diet amen
[40:13] whether it's on a keto or lead or
[40:16] whatever South Beach or North Beach
[40:19] whatever it is
[40:20] everybody's on some kind of diet trying
[40:23] to preserve their life but earlier under
[40:26] those circumstances the only thing
[40:29] you'll get is death because there's no
[40:32] promise of this flesh living Hurley we
[40:35] have the promise when God's saying the
[40:37] day you eat of is the day you shall
[40:40] surely die but when we look and we see
[40:42] what God did through his brother oh yeah
[40:46] church he came
[40:47] and he gave his life haruya that we
[40:50] would never have to die again man can't
[40:54] oh yeah under the compassion of Jesus
[40:56] Christ as my personal Savior
[40:59] you never ha you have to remain halia in
[41:03] a place of death again oh yeah but let
[41:07] me say like this you meet us our dying
[41:10] holier makes way for us to live huh cuz
[41:14] Powell said I die daily ain't man but
[41:17] the reason he died daily because he can
[41:19] only give God his best if he died first
[41:24] hallelujah
[41:25] so death is very important to the
[41:28] believer so we must hurry get rid of our
[41:33] own thoughts out almost everything in
[41:35] dr. I will hallelujah and become a
[41:39] sacrifice to the will and presence of
[41:41] God and the Bible also says how
[41:44] beautiful is the death of the Saints
[41:46] hallelujah
[41:47] so death is beautiful in God's eyes in
[41:50] charge if we look at natural things
[41:52] again you take a seed holy you don't
[41:56] even know what's in that ceiling to the
[41:58] dies you don't know an apple honey you
[42:03] can Apple seeking bring forth apples
[42:06] until that she dies hurry and goes
[42:09] through a resurrection and Greece full
[42:12] of life so it takes a death earlier to
[42:15] bring forth the strength of the seed in
[42:18] that life honey
[42:18] so church it'll take a death in you and
[42:21] I to bring forth the strength of the
[42:24] seed inside of us and the strength of
[42:27] the seed inside of us is the revelation
[42:29] of Jesus Christ
[42:30] perlier crucified and risen again so
[42:34] turns we must hurry you be identified
[42:37] with the death of Christ he said so if
[42:41] you suffer with me you reign with me so
[42:43] we must enter to a place where we forget
[42:46] about self
[42:46] earlier but you know what we would I
[42:49] begin to think about this thought in the
[42:51] scripture
[42:51] Paul said I am crucified a crucifixion
[42:56] is just not a regular kind of death
[42:58] honey please sir
[43:02] it's an agony it's a pain honey it's not
[43:04] just an ordinary way to die huh
[43:07] you're dying in a way that holier it
[43:09] causes her all of your body and hurting
[43:13] different members of your flesh and
[43:14] things to agonizing pain
[43:17] pause went through that kind of
[43:18] crucifixion a man he was he was a whip
[43:22] more than five times we knew his story
[43:25] and night and day as he bit my Vipers
[43:27] throat over the wall all kind of these
[43:29] things that's my Paul could say I am
[43:31] crucified with Christ honey but did not
[43:34] like he says nevertheless hallelujah now
[43:39] you explain the phonics or all other
[43:43] than the right salt behind that how do I
[43:47] live in death like he said it's not i
[43:54] but it's Christ that liveth in me Amen
[43:57] hallelujah he says but Christ liveth in
[44:00] me that the life which I now live in the
[44:03] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[44:06] God so when you die you live but you
[44:10] live by the faith of Jesus Christ what a
[44:14] powerful statement who loved me and gave
[44:17] himself for me so it's imperative that
[44:21] we die to our own self-will because the
[44:24] only way we're gonna bring forth life is
[44:27] if we die hurry to our flesh to our own
[44:31] holier I own our human minds how human
[44:36] ways that's the only way you will be for
[44:38] Christ cuz we must get it right they
[44:41] crucified Him
[44:42] hurry not because of the work she did
[44:46] they crucified Him because they said
[44:48] he'll being a man earlier made himself
[44:52] God see they couldn't died to their own
[44:55] sinking honey
[44:56] they had it completely wrong he wasn't
[44:59] hurry
[44:59] a man called himself God he was God
[45:03] calling himself a man she's naked and
[45:06] died to their own sauce their own
[45:08] reasoning to see that God the prophet of
[45:11] God
[45:11] said what made god so great that he
[45:14] could leave his greatness and become
[45:16] Lohani and take on fresh and be
[45:21] crucified look at a church he was
[45:23] crucified by his own creation so to live
[45:30] as Christ but the dice game what did he
[45:35] gain at his death hallelujah the Bible
[45:38] says earlier when he died and he rose
[45:41] again the whole heavens and earth haruya
[45:44] amen
[45:45] they identified with that death
[45:48] everybody knew from that point that he
[45:51] was Lord and King oh yeah and his only
[45:54] by a guest of self will that you will be
[45:58] identified with Christ because with that
[46:00] a self holy your crucifixion
[46:03] you just live your own life come on but
[46:07] the Bible says earlier the Bible says in
[46:10] Philippians he said for me to live is
[46:13] Christ and to die is gain honey how do
[46:16] you gain by dying well let's look at
[46:22] look at Christ when he died and what did
[46:24] he gain he gains the respect of the
[46:29] whole world by his death heard those
[46:32] that would believe in him oh yeah there
[46:35] is a tree that is called a large pole
[46:42] pine tree and this particular tree is
[46:45] like any other tree you know in order
[46:48] for this tree to bring forth life it has
[46:52] to be put in a very very very very very
[46:56] bad situation most trees it just takes
[47:01] some water and some sunlight and it
[47:03] grows and then then you know fruit drop
[47:05] off and all these things and it brings
[47:07] forth the only way this tree brings
[47:09] forth life is in a forest fire
[47:13] hallo hey hey not just an ordinary fire
[47:17] but a fire that comes down and it burns
[47:20] up everything in his path huh
[47:22] so as this tree is dying hurry is
[47:26] opening up to drop seed in the midst of
[47:29] all of that destruction oh yeah so it
[47:33] takes a crucifixion of death of that
[47:36] tree to brief of life oh yeah
[47:38] so sometimes God put us in situations
[47:40] why so we can breathe for life
[47:44] hallelujah you know I was thinking today
[47:46] how do you what identifies us holy is
[47:50] how we respond we meet corruption that
[47:55] will identify what's inside your seed
[47:58] will you meet corruption because
[48:00] remember unless the seed dies you never
[48:03] see what kind of life inside of it and
[48:06] unless you meet corruption we all know
[48:08] who you are
[48:11] so God allows troubles allow tribulation
[48:15] all these things hallelujah so that you
[48:18] have to die to your own will and ask God
[48:21] for him oh yeah look Church how did we
[48:29] know David was a man after God's own
[48:33] heart it's bad the trials he went it's
[48:40] by the mistakes he made because every
[48:43] time David met corruption always saw us
[48:48] God hurry
[48:51] you take receiver after that Souls 51
[48:55] God you take a human soul soul was
[49:00] trying to kill him and just like Christ
[49:02] he's always trying to kill him what do
[49:04] we see from David God huh
[49:07] even when Saul was put in David's hands
[49:09] David still wouldn't hurt him what did
[49:12] we see God in the only way David could
[49:15] do that is he became jealous hallelujah
[49:17] if he was able to live a life earlier of
[49:21] gas before life
[49:24] David doing that hallelujah the people
[49:27] saw what a true king is not only just a
[49:32] true King but they saw a man after God's
[49:35] very own heart so it was David meeting
[49:38] the corruption of soul and the
[49:40] corruption of Shiva and all these things
[49:42] Uriah hallelujah that brought out the
[49:44] character of God who yeah
[49:48] it took a strenuous fire a strenuous
[49:51] situation huh
[49:52] to bring out the elements of the life
[49:54] inside that she and God puts us in
[49:58] strenuous situations and steals child in
[50:00] tribulations why to bring out that real
[50:03] life inside you'll see hallelujah go
[50:06] away it took a painting in a car earlier
[50:09] to break out the meekness and Moses
[50:12] whose hey honey yeah before he met her
[50:18] painted in car he was a murderer he got
[50:23] angry and he put things in his own hands
[50:28] he couldn't die but once he learned how
[50:32] to die life came for her Lorraine God
[50:37] would come and step in her Leah and he
[50:41] tells him say hey I speak to prophets
[50:44] with dreams and
[50:53] yes and I believe the Bible said it was
[50:57] never a man as meek as Moses but you
[51:02] think church oh we greens like greens I
[51:08] get you how many like cauliflower
[51:12] spinach mushrooms I got some more you're
[51:17] shaking here but you know you think
[51:20] about that eating okra and all these
[51:21] things that are supposed to be good for
[51:23] you you know those things have to die so
[51:26] you can live so let me ask you something
[51:28] if it dies oh yeah if it dies how does
[51:34] it still has nourishment in it so that
[51:37] you can leave okay I thought I thought
[51:43] we'd have to experience strength from
[51:47] something that's living but the way the
[51:49] body is created we draw strength off of
[51:53] things that die the spirit dies this is
[51:58] the chicken - the cow dies all these
[52:01] things die and our fresh holier feasel
[52:04] in church that's just a shadow of what
[52:08] was really going to happen if you're
[52:13] fresh lives of dance substance to stay
[52:16] alive your so does the same thing you're
[52:21] so holy eats of the blood of the Lamb oh
[52:24] yeah I mean the bread of the Lamb huh
[52:27] he's not the bread of the lamrim him he
[52:29] says I am that bread that came from him
[52:33] drink of this water he was first no more
[52:36] holy see we're really supposed to be
[52:38] eating off of Christ and we ate off of
[52:43] him we ate off of his substance we live
[52:47] and we eat that by revelation huh
[52:52] we're not eating on his is his little
[52:55] body we're eating off of his revelation
[52:59] knowing who he is
[53:02] Hebrews
[53:04] the third chapter verse 1 the Bible says
[53:15] you know before I go there I want to
[53:17] read you something in the in the lives
[53:19] of that same thought and I don't plan on
[53:22] being alone y'all know I'm about to
[53:23] close but you know let me read this team
[53:27] listen what the Prophet God says he says
[53:31] it makes a difference listeners it makes
[53:34] a difference when you come sincerely to
[53:38] God
[53:38] look you have to die for you only live
[53:43] by their substance something has to die
[53:46] so you can live so you can eight to
[53:49] Christ died so we could ante he would
[53:56] have never died holy
[53:57] we wouldn't be hugging for the
[53:59] revelation of who he is
[54:02] he had to die and go away and when he
[54:06] died him in a way that made us hungry
[54:08] for more Koecher CH as long as he was
[54:16] around the disciples didn't know what
[54:19] they had in their presence remember they
[54:24] said they said uh-uh
[54:25] why don't show the sciples wash their
[54:26] hands he said for what the righteousness
[54:28] is here why don't they fans who they're
[54:31] gonna be fastened to I'm here you know
[54:34] so everything that they would have done
[54:35] it would have kind of been in vain
[54:37] because God was right there they had no
[54:40] need to die to themselves so God had to
[54:44] leave and go away huh why so mankind
[54:48] could hunger for his presence haruya so
[54:55] by him dying it causes something to
[54:58] awaken inside of us that wants to live
[55:03] and feed on him what have we been doing
[55:07] all of these years we've been feeding on
[55:11] the body of Christ
[55:16] we've been feeling of the revelation
[55:19] hallelujah of Jesus Christ and you know
[55:22] what you know you eat some things in the
[55:25] natural and you get full right question
[55:32] how many of us have ever gotten
[55:35] completely full off of Jesus Christ
[55:41] [Music]
[55:44] you can't cuz there's no satisfaction in
[55:51] the flesh for Christ honey the only way
[55:55] you'd be completely full is when you're
[55:58] in his presence earlier and I'm not
[56:01] talking about for church I'm talking
[56:03] about the little corporal body of Jesus
[56:06] Christ that's the only way your hunger
[56:09] will leave her because you hunger have
[56:12] to cease that are not in your presence
[56:16] but let me show you how great your hyung
[56:19] is you can only hunger after something
[56:22] that you've had before so if you have a
[56:31] hunger or craving for the bread of the
[56:35] Lamb hallelujah or that water will you
[56:38] never thirst again maybe because you've
[56:41] had a taste maybe because you've had a
[56:44] sip okay like I say all the time I like
[56:47] chocolate cake and the only way I could
[56:50] crave it is because I've had it before
[56:56] so why are we hunger in for him because
[57:02] that's where we come from
[57:07] why are we hunger Holly I'm just gonna
[57:11] get into it I don't want to be too long
[57:12] why don't we hunger huh for the
[57:16] manifestation of the atonement listen
[57:21] the Bible Hebrews 3 and 1 the Bible says
[57:29] Hebrews 3 chapter 1 he says wherefore
[57:31] holy brethren partakers of the heavenly
[57:34] calling consider the Apostle and high
[57:37] priest of our profession Christ Jesus
[57:40] now we know that a prophet of God says
[57:42] profession and confession is the same
[57:45] thing honey
[57:46] but he is the high priest what does he
[57:49] do this high priest he's making
[57:51] intercession oh yeah he knows exactly
[57:55] what we're craving for so he makes a way
[58:02] that your desires can be met your holy
[58:07] cravings can be met why because he's the
[58:10] high priest
[58:11] nothing gets past him listen he says and
[58:16] freest not sign a car but something died
[58:20] that you could live furthermore Jesus
[58:22] Christ God's Son and became holy and
[58:25] because he lives you live also now I'm
[58:29] going to turn the service to the past
[58:31] see is because Christ died we live you
[58:36] know we sing that song because he I can
[58:40] fade tomorrow you know why you can face
[58:43] tomorrow because of what his death meant
[58:49] his death took away every agony of pain
[58:54] that would bother you huh that would
[58:57] hinder you from living this life that he
[58:59] wants you to live but when we look at
[59:03] the atonement honey when we look at what
[59:05] Jesus did for us you have to go cuddly
[59:09] and you have to turn to Isaiah 53 honey
[59:13] you have to turn the Isaiah 53 and you
[59:16] have to take it up from there
[59:27] thinking about this subject you know it
[59:30] brought me to the redemptive names of
[59:35] Jehovah you know what how God is
[59:38] revealed in all the names of Jaffa but
[59:44] you have to see how those names apply to
[59:47] your life the church if we I don't know
[59:50] if I said this before but we don't see
[59:52] it again if we are Abraham's seed we
[59:55] have to see the great God Jehovah that
[59:57] revealed himself to Abraham but what we
[1:00:00] see we think oh he was just revealed as
[1:00:04] to provide oh no oh no he was every
[1:00:10] redemptive name to Abraham huh let's
[1:00:14] just say he wants to provide he said
[1:00:16] Lord the Lord shall provide himself but
[1:00:20] did he stop days and know he was over
[1:00:23] Rafa
[1:00:24] he was the hill he was say ball he wants
[1:00:28] to protect the honey he was nice he he
[1:00:31] was the para holy and on and on and on
[1:00:34] he was Shama he was they have a present
[1:00:37] all of these names of Jehovah was
[1:00:40] reveled in the journey of Abraham huh
[1:00:44] but Abraham had to die to his own ways
[1:00:48] and as he died to his own ways God
[1:00:54] reveals more of himself if I can just
[1:01:06] listen if we take the redemptive names
[1:01:11] of Jehovah and you say well God was he
[1:01:18] was just a provider you're missing it
[1:01:22] because the prophet of God said they
[1:01:25] asked him is healing a part of the
[1:01:30] atonement
[1:01:32] if you say yes that means that
[1:01:36] everything else is over is is the part
[1:01:38] of the atonement and what is the
[1:01:42] atonement honey the death burial
[1:01:44] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:01:47] his blood atoning for our sins so if God
[1:01:52] is a provider he has to be healed
[1:01:55] because that makes up who he is
[1:01:58] listen he's over jiraiya provider he's
[1:02:02] over Niecy our banner church he's alone
[1:02:05] Luke church
[1:02:06] he gave Abraham a pace that surpasses
[1:02:09] all understanding even though his body
[1:02:12] was dead Holly was stricken with O age
[1:02:16] God gave him a peace that one day he'd
[1:02:19] have a child he didn't worry he didn't
[1:02:23] go said oh how this gonna happen Church
[1:02:25] he had such a piece of Jehovah Salome
[1:02:28] the Bible said he didn't get weak in
[1:02:30] faith he got strong in faith Roth I was
[1:02:38] reveal Salone was revealed amen this
[1:02:42] canoe hurry up in Abraham
[1:02:45] the Lord is your righteousness you say
[1:02:50] where was he revealed in Abraham
[1:02:51] remember there was somebody with Abraham
[1:02:54] called locked and the Bible says the
[1:02:58] sins of Sodom facts like righteous soul
[1:03:01] who you read the scriptures what made
[1:03:04] not righteous it wasn't his actions it
[1:03:09] was the prayers of Abraham because God
[1:03:13] says he's gonna destroy us all and
[1:03:17] Abraham comes and he starts to bleed he
[1:03:20] starts to plead for lighting so you're
[1:03:22] gonna destroy the righteous with the
[1:03:23] wicked he goes down you notice God came
[1:03:26] all the way down because he couldn't
[1:03:28] find no righteous so where was the
[1:03:32] righteous holding back the fire it was
[1:03:35] in Abraham
[1:03:40] he was over oh yeah
[1:03:44] Shama you ever present huh he was
[1:03:47] everywhere remember when the king took
[1:03:49] Sarah huh
[1:03:50] who was it they got Sarah back it was go
[1:03:55] see over Shama Wow Church and if we are
[1:04:01] Abraham's seed the redemptive names of
[1:04:04] Jehovah walk with us he's peace he's a
[1:04:10] badass he's a protector he's a healer
[1:04:13] he's a provider Hey
[1:04:18] Oh you know and one of my favorites is
[1:04:24] Jehovah say both the Lord is our
[1:04:28] protector remember Abraham would to go
[1:04:33] fight three kings with armies with me
[1:04:38] and well trained soldiers and finals
[1:04:40] Abraham went with surface Abraham where
[1:04:46] they probably had rates and holes and
[1:04:47] all kind of stuff and they would
[1:04:50] identify tongue fight three kings with
[1:04:54] 318 service how could he do that because
[1:05:00] he homo save up was revealed in Abraham
[1:05:03] well God is our protector even when
[1:05:09] there's three kings that want to destroy
[1:05:11] God comes it says I am your exceeding
[1:05:14] and great reward
[1:05:17] does anybody know him as a protector see
[1:05:21] Oliver Sabel was with you tonight as you
[1:05:24] came to church because the devil wanted
[1:05:26] to save us that's weak but God says I
[1:05:29] have prayed for thee he's your protector
[1:05:32] oh yeah church when we die we live in
[1:05:38] Christ we live in the revelation of
[1:05:41] Jehovah God who lives with his family
[1:05:52] I know y'all can't even say that you
[1:05:55] know it's what I like you know what I
[1:05:57] like you know it's what I like I like it
[1:06:00] all
[1:06:00] because all of it reveals who he is but
[1:06:06] part of that that's what I'm gonna talk
[1:06:07] about his G / rah rah nah-ah
[1:06:18] not to scare you honey but - rah like
[1:06:24] what is he Jehovah is our Shepherd he's
[1:06:29] our leader hallelujah
[1:06:31] he keeps the Wolves back oh yeah he
[1:06:35] keeps you from harm he's over round who
[1:06:38] you trust he guys and lead us into the
[1:06:42] paths of righteousness why because he's
[1:06:45] our shot I love the story the Prophet
[1:06:51] told
[1:06:51] oh the shepherd who has disobedient
[1:06:54] sheep he broke the sheep's leg so he
[1:06:59] could care for it
[1:07:00] and that she would fall in love with him
[1:07:02] and that sheep from that point would
[1:07:05] follow him anywhere
[1:07:07] why because in him break the shepherd
[1:07:11] breaking his leg there were other names
[1:07:14] of Jehovah also revealed in that
[1:07:16] struggle he then became a protector by
[1:07:22] the broken leg because the shepherd the
[1:07:24] sheep couldn't fend for itself
[1:07:25] he also became Holly - who were some
[1:07:27] honey why could the simple was always
[1:07:30] present he also became Jehovah Rapha why
[1:07:33] because the sever was Dara make sure he
[1:07:35] got healed honey to look at your life
[1:07:39] and see if God is with you
[1:07:45] somebody say J over B God who dwells
[1:07:50] with his family God is a family man he's
[1:07:58] not a baby daddy he's a father he
[1:08:06] doesn't have uncircumcised shade but we
[1:08:14] have C that can only bring forth life
[1:08:16] this kind of life you look at God being
[1:08:31] revealed in the names of Jehovah
[1:08:34] I begin to think about life after death
[1:08:38] and how God's death meant life to us the
[1:08:42] furthermore we should just what I want
[1:08:45] everybody to do from now on is what I'm
[1:08:47] practicing on myself I'm just giving up
[1:08:54] I'm not quitting I'm just giving up
[1:08:59] quitting and giving up is two different
[1:09:01] things
[1:09:01] quitting is walking away from something
[1:09:04] Halla giving up is surrender oh what a
[1:09:14] pleasant thing is you know you stronger
[1:09:17] struggle against something and then you
[1:09:19] surrender and everything falls in place
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:24] that's what God wants from us he wants
[1:09:27] us to die and surrender coz your
[1:09:32] surrender allows God to take over your
[1:09:35] life in the only way you can get there
[1:09:41] is if you first before I close we look
[1:09:49] at the seed of God meeting corruption
[1:09:51] and how each person each see of God when
[1:09:56] they met corruption they brought forth
[1:09:58] life she met death not once but three
[1:10:09] times
[1:10:10] definitely father though getting a
[1:10:13] brother-in-law and death in her own
[1:10:15] husband and what did those deaths do
[1:10:18] those deaths led her to a surrender a
[1:10:23] surrender of her own self-will so she
[1:10:29] died to her own wants and desires to
[1:10:32] follow Naomi and by her dying to herself
[1:10:38] she meant life in a kiss me redeemer
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:45] once you say you know what I'm sick of
[1:10:48] this I'm gonna get married again I don't
[1:10:50] know I'm tired of being lonely you know
[1:10:52] I need a man in my life and no doubt she
[1:10:58] probably had those kind of talks but she
[1:11:04] died thinking and she allows herself to
[1:11:09] be led by revelation you say she be led
[1:11:20] by Naomi no she's been laid by Naomi's
[1:11:23] revelation because they you mean that it
[1:11:28] would take a near kinsman to redeem not
[1:11:32] only just Ruth but her also
[1:11:37] so we before she got there who say you
[1:11:40] know what yo God is my god they she said
[1:11:44] I'm dead well you died
[1:11:47] well you launched our launch yo people
[1:11:50] is my people you know she was saying my
[1:11:53] mind according to this situation is gone
[1:11:58] lose your mind lose your thoughts hug
[1:12:03] and let the mind of Christ lead you you
[1:12:08] know something I was just saying to some
[1:12:09] friends of mine yesterday you know
[1:12:11] charge when we go through situations
[1:12:15] that seem to be fuss in that moment if
[1:12:21] for scripture comes that's not the devil
[1:12:26] in your trials and tribulations the
[1:12:31] devil will never give you a word
[1:12:35] normally a word comes because it's that
[1:12:40] word that will set you free in that
[1:12:42] situation I give you a prime example I
[1:12:46] think I've told you testimony before I
[1:12:49] was traveling you know I was going on
[1:12:52] the road father please no no I need to
[1:13:06] work with y'all work you come stay with
[1:13:09] jobs about a month but anyway I'm going
[1:13:14] on the road have you stopped yeah I have
[1:13:16] so much so much need and so much like at
[1:13:20] the same time I'm feeling st. Lords you
[1:13:23] know I gotta pay this be like pities me
[1:13:25] I need as I need that script and he
[1:13:28] scripture says give and it shall be
[1:13:30] given to you now I want you to wait a
[1:13:36] situation wait a situation I don't get
[1:13:38] nervous on by the clothes but let's
[1:13:41] weigh it out I'm praying to God I was
[1:13:43] thinking conversing with God in my sauce
[1:13:46] I'm saying Lord I got neither got me I
[1:13:49] got need and God comes with a word that
[1:13:51] says I know you got knee but gills
[1:13:56] now if you ain't dead to your own self
[1:13:59] you say why would I give when I'm in
[1:14:04] need that don't make sense if I need a
[1:14:08] hundred dollars why am I gonna give a
[1:14:10] hundred dollars
[1:14:11] it don't make sense but God's Word
[1:14:14] always has a two-fold mean you just got
[1:14:18] to be able to die to your own reasonings
[1:14:20] to operate in that truth huh
[1:14:23] now that scripture hurry up holy that
[1:14:26] scripture accepted on good ground
[1:14:29] what's my freedom you know Church what I
[1:14:36] did I said okay Lord that scripture come
[1:14:40] to me plenty of time but in this moment
[1:14:44] you ever been in church and you caught
[1:14:46] something and see I'm one of them people

[1:15:14] don't just catch it like this he it take
[1:15:17] everything you know it is sometimes it's
[1:15:21] like a struggle because it's it's
[1:15:22] rewarding to catch that before I go over
[1:15:26] the wall sometimes you got to go up high
[1:15:28] you got to catch the ball when it's
[1:15:30] elevating that one's coming down so
[1:15:34] sometimes you gotta catch your blessings
[1:15:36] when the elevator we always want God to
[1:15:39] come down where we get weary in turns
[1:15:41] just chillin you know sometimes a

[1:17:06] blessing you know what we do
[1:17:11] I'm all right I appreciate you though
[1:17:13] I'm all right you've been praying about
[1:17:20] the blessing that God is using somebody
[1:17:22] to bless you and you like I'm waiting on
[1:17:26] the Lord no problem
[1:17:33] the proper God say it's not hard for us
[1:17:36] to believe supernatural things it's hard
[1:17:39] for us to believe God can use our system
[1:17:41] brother but anyway you know I come in
[1:17:45] you know I couldn't leave him my
[1:17:47] blessing so I took some woman out you
[1:17:51] know that seem like I'm being crazy cuz
[1:17:54] I got a need but you know what I can't I
[1:17:56] can't keep him you say what's this for
[1:17:58] just take all right I appreciate you put
[1:18:04] it on in this pocket
[1:18:05] I got the rule so I took the breath back
[1:18:09] knock on my mom hey my say-so
[1:18:12] just kind of laying in the bed I got the
[1:18:15] breakfast and I got the money
[1:18:17] I was a good feeling that day so I go in
[1:18:20] and I give her like you're the fool and
[1:18:23] I give her $100 and she just raised
[1:18:25] hands and she just started worshipping
[1:18:28] God she started giving God praise me I'm
[1:18:43] your son you gonna say thank you son but
[1:18:47] she went into a worship holiday she
[1:18:51] started to give God praise so much she
[1:18:54] started give God so much praise I kind
[1:18:56] of got uncomfortable being in it so I I
[1:19:03] waited for a little bit too seriously
[1:19:06] thank you son but it seemed like I
[1:19:08] wasn't coming you know I believe still
[1:19:13] ain't getting that walk out the door sit
[1:19:16] in my car I get in the car and I start
[1:19:23] right and God started talking to me and
[1:19:25] God I said see in that moment you reason
[1:19:29] why you didn't get any things because
[1:19:31] that wasn't you as her son she said in
[1:19:35] that moment you was Joe Vijaya Church we
[1:19:42] are his attributes
[1:19:44] oh yeah so God uses you haruya in your
[1:19:48] flesh to provide is not you as God it's
[1:19:51] the guy they're praying to honey
[1:19:53] so in those moments your Joubert IRA if
[1:19:56] you lay hands on somebody and pray for
[1:19:58] it's over i-5 they get healed
[1:20:02] we eyes attributes and to make a long
[1:20:07] story short earlier I just had to be
[1:20:10] obedient dancing myself to that song and
[1:20:12] give her I went out and preached earlier
[1:20:15] $100 is a tenth of what and I was
[1:20:22] preaching a sister walk up to me gave me
[1:20:24] two checks it
[1:20:26] to guess how much oh and sometimes God
[1:20:32] got things for you if you could get out
[1:20:34] your own way if you can die to the way
[1:20:38] you think it ought to operate and just
[1:20:41] let God do it he'll do it
[1:20:47] it'll be so powerful because in that
[1:20:50] moment it was me a preacher blessing my
[1:20:53] mom earlier but when it came back around
[1:20:55] it was a preacher's mom blessing me we
[1:21:06] are his attributes jehovah is revealed
[1:21:11] in his family death brings forth life
[1:21:20] such as we could just let musicians come
[1:21:23] on close I feel like closing let me
[1:21:24] close fifty three before I close we look
[1:21:31] and see what all was revealed in the
[1:21:34] atonement a scripture if we just take
[1:21:38] some of you can go back and read it but
[1:21:40] if we just start at verse three saying
[1:21:42] he is despised and rejected of me church
[1:21:46] because oh yeah look at the atonement
[1:21:49] and this is the atonement Isaiah 53 he
[1:21:51] was despised and rejected of man because
[1:21:54] he was despised and rejected we don't
[1:21:56] have to feel that way everything he went
[1:22:01] through was because he didn't want us to
[1:22:04] have to go through that alone so if you
[1:22:08] feel despised and rejected
[1:22:10] you're feeling their own feelings those
[1:22:14] are perverted selves because those
[1:22:17] thoughts have been covered by the blood
[1:22:24] this
[1:22:26] he says a man of sorrow who you touch
[1:22:30] God has already felt the sorrows and
[1:22:33] pains of the flesh you shouldn't be
[1:22:36] feeling that he atoned for that he
[1:22:40] covered all of our sorrows died to your
[1:22:44] own Souls
[1:22:48] he says acquainted with grief oh how
[1:22:52] many of us fall in that category
[1:22:54] we're acquainted with situations that
[1:22:58] brings full of grief you know the cross
[1:23:01] took away those kind of feelings when
[1:23:05] you can follow up under that atonement
[1:23:08] when you follow up under that atonement
[1:23:10] you should be acquainted acquainted me
[1:23:13] to having fellowship how often we
[1:23:18] fellowship with pain we fellowship with
[1:23:21] grief we fellowship with sorrow God
[1:23:24] already did it for us it's been put in
[1:23:30] the atonement Saint doesn't have a right
[1:23:33] to make you feel grief agony and pain
[1:23:38] it's somebody saying it's under the
[1:23:41] blood
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:48] see we look at Isaiah 53 and we think by
[1:23:52] strikes I'm healed
[1:23:54] it's much more than that look at all the
[1:23:59] stuff he atoned for
[1:24:04] he says that we hid as they were our
[1:24:07] faces from him he was despised and we
[1:24:13] esteemed him not
[1:24:14] so he knows what it's like to be
[1:24:16] despised you don't see cuz I want you to
[1:24:19] catch this all of these feelings of
[1:24:21] agony and pain and these feelings of
[1:24:24] disruption you don't have to feel them
[1:24:29] God died so that you could live you ever
[1:24:36] heard of somebody dying because they're
[1:24:38] depressed or maybe feeling despised it
[1:24:44] happens in old couples a lot one one one
[1:24:47] one one one of the couples one of the
[1:24:49] husband of the wife is going to be with
[1:24:51] the Lord but the other one just feels so
[1:24:54] much grief do they end up passing on we
[1:24:59] don't have to be acquainted with that
[1:25:01] death can be a celebration
[1:25:07] who is there surely listeners surely
[1:25:12] poor how Greece God took them and
[1:25:16] carried our sorrows he carried out some
[1:25:19] that means is not yours God carried our
[1:25:24] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:25:32] smitten of God and afflicted but he was
[1:25:36] wounded for our transgressions you say

[1:25:41] hurt by my family I've been hurt but
[1:25:42] he's been wounded already you don't have

[1:26:55] expecting to get the flu now he's
[1:26:57] already been afflicted you don't have to
[1:27:01] carry sickness and disease but he was
[1:27:08] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:27:11] bruised for our iniquities Omaha people
[1:27:16] may accuse you they may say things about
[1:27:18] you but God has our Aryan rules he's
[1:27:23] already been bruised for your iniquities

[1:29:59] grief because we're hailed you don't
[1:30:02] have to be Queen it because we're healed
[1:30:05] you don't have to be bruised because we
[1:30:08] held die in Christ and then leave
[1:30:19] his death got for flight huh so children
[1:30:25] we think about the kind of life we
[1:30:27] living is it worthy of the toilet
[1:30:32] because he died for every piece of
[1:30:34] strength that we will need nobody in
[1:30:39] this in this room should be feeling weak
[1:30:44] because God died that that we could say
[1:30:47] they're strong
[1:30:51] you didn't say hello say you're not weak

[1:31:30] back this blood is already been poured
[1:31:33] out in the last verse of that says with
[1:31:36] his times we are here

[1:44:15] I want to just break one more time this
[1:44:20] request just came in from from brother
[1:44:28] Sampson posted today to please pray for
[1:44:31] them they're in a great trial I think I
[1:44:34] might know what that's about they've
[1:44:36] brother Samson and his travels to the
[1:44:40] u.s. he comes annually comes by our way
[1:44:43] we love brother Samson with a great love
[1:44:45] and such a sincere brother and all of
[1:44:49] the new adjustments to immigration that
[1:44:52] are coming from Washington have
[1:44:54] tightened up and he actually had a
[1:44:57] multi-year already said and it was taken
[1:45:01] taken away and they wanted to start over
[1:45:03] and reapply and the requirements now to
[1:45:06] come under the way that he comes it's
[1:45:08] almost become impossible so we've been
[1:45:11] trying to give him advice on how to do
[1:45:13] it and go about it and let's just pray
[1:45:15] and I think that's probably what it is
[1:45:17] if it's not the Lord knows what it is
[1:45:19] Amen join hands with somebody new master
[1:45:22] Lord our great friend for the Samson
[1:45:25] Shetty there in India a little brother
[1:45:27] who we love Lord and we cherish you

[1:45:32] Lord and father you see how the enemy
[1:45:34] has now restricted his ability to come
[1:45:37] among us Lord to travel here through
[1:45:39] America Lord it's been a great blessing
[1:45:42] to us as Western Americans it's been a
[1:45:45] great blessing to him at his church Lord
[1:45:48] were able to gain garner support for him
[1:45:51] around the country and father we're
[1:45:54] asking now for you to have mercy on this
[1:45:56] situation look to it master whatever it
[1:45:58] is if that I know that that is a need
[1:46:00] Lord and if there's another need here
[1:46:02] that's not spoken then we commit that to
[1:46:04] you you know it all too well lord I pray
[1:46:07] that you meet it by your abundant mercy
[1:46:09] and grace Lord we found out on Sunday
[1:46:12] that grace is very powerful Lord when
[1:46:15] grace projects Lord what love projects
[1:46:18] grace takes over
[1:46:19] father the Bible says that
[1:46:22] that love will carry it as far as it
[1:46:25] possibly can and when it can't carry it
[1:46:27] no further grace we'll pick it up from
[1:46:29] there and take it over yeah so Lord may
[1:46:32] it be so tonight we offer this prayer we
[1:46:34] half-brother Samson Shetty and his
[1:46:36] assembly there in India committed to you
[1:46:39] in Jesus name Amen

[1:46:44] testimony tonight before we go
[1:46:47] I had put a prayer request in for my

[1:47:04] prayer for her eyes and I spoke with her
[1:47:08] today and she was able to drive today
[1:47:11] for the first time in Lourdes and I want
[1:47:13] to thank the Lord and thanks for all the
[1:47:15] I just want to return things to the Lord
[1:47:30] a couple week a couple of Wednesday's
[1:47:33] ago I was out sick and that was
[1:47:36] streaming and you know had prayed for me
[1:47:39] and in just a few hours later we're
[1:47:41] doing much better
[1:47:43] I was ended up which what Meredith got
[1:47:47] home I was kidding around with her
[1:47:48] summer she's thinking you're feeling
[1:47:50] better
[1:47:50] and then the next day I was about 99% so
[1:47:54] I just want to face the awkward for
[1:47:56] answered prayer long time gone so a few
[1:48:10] like it last month I haven't had a
[1:48:12] chance to give this testimony yet but it
[1:48:14] was like a month ago we had some family
[1:48:16] in town and Travis's uncle asked if I
[1:48:20] could make a chocolate cake and I was
[1:48:21] like well sure and I was almost done
[1:48:26] making it when I remembered that since I
[1:48:30] moved into that house really since the
[1:48:32] last couple years mostly my oven does
[1:48:35] not bake anything at all and you think I
[1:48:39] remember that but I just don't bake much
[1:48:41] so I completely forgot about it and I
[1:48:43] was sliding me up the cake into the oven
[1:48:46] and I just almost burst into tears I was
[1:48:49] so upset and I was like I can't believe
[1:48:52] I forgot this but this cake isn't gonna
[1:48:54] turn out every cake I've made for the
[1:48:57] last several years is as flat as a
[1:48:59] pancake and I know it's the oven I just
[1:49:03] I know it is so I you know the ovens
[1:49:05] almost 25 years old that there's other
[1:49:07] problems with it and I was so upset
[1:49:09] Travis's cousin was there and she was
[1:49:11] like why don't you just lay hands on it
[1:49:13] and pray for it and I was like okay okay
[1:49:17] I'll do that
[1:49:17] so I waited for everyone to leave
[1:49:19] because I was I felt like the house was
[1:49:22] kind of crowded and it got kind of quiet
[1:49:24] and I just really simply said Lord this
[1:49:27] might seem silly to other people but
[1:49:30] this cake is important to me and I
[1:49:33] worked hard on it I would like it to
[1:49:35] turn out please just not only fix this
[1:49:38] cake but fix my whole oven and that was
[1:49:42] the best cake I've ever made and it has
[1:49:44] worked perfectly I've baked so much
[1:49:46] stuff since then it's like every week
[1:49:48] I'm baking something
[1:49:51] and then I also have another testimony
[1:49:53] I'll make it quicker but some of you
[1:49:56] guys might remember a couple months ago
[1:49:58] I lost my glasses and Elijah let me step
[1:50:01] by step to them and I did not learn my
[1:50:03] lesson I left my glasses outside again
[1:50:06] came inside same story had a massive
[1:50:10] headache for days could not find my
[1:50:11] glasses I was so upset really
[1:50:14] embarrassed and I was sitting on the
[1:50:16] couch and I was like Lord you did it for
[1:50:19] me before you had a toddler lead me to
[1:50:22] my glasses outside I know you can do
[1:50:25] that again please help me find them
[1:50:27] before the words were out of my mouth
[1:50:29] Travis walked in with my glasses and was
[1:50:31] like you've been looking for these and I
[1:50:34] was like yes four days and then he said
[1:50:36] well maybe you can get up and help me
[1:50:38] find my wallet cuz I've lost that I
[1:50:40] guess we're not good at keeping a hold
[1:50:42] of our stuff but I was like okay sure
[1:50:45] and I was walking up the stairs just to
[1:50:48] look around he'd been looking for that
[1:50:49] all day and I was like well you just
[1:50:53] help me find my glasses Lord please help
[1:50:55] us find this wallet reveal to me where
[1:50:58] this wallet is and as I said that I
[1:51:00] picked up a blanket and the wallet was
[1:51:02] underneath the blanket while I was
[1:51:04] praying we found these things so I don't
[1:51:07] think those are accidents and I'm so
[1:51:09] thankful
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:16] so while faith is on the roll if you

[1:51:38] right ahead you go sis so I think about
[1:51:44] everybody that I've talked who knows
[1:51:45] this story and it kind of goes with what
[1:51:48] Deb was talking about if your kitchen is
[1:51:51] not working it's a really page four
[1:51:53] thing especially for a woman you can't
[1:51:55] cook can't do anything we haven't
[1:51:58] haven't for it had a fridge for a month
[1:52:00] and a half because our fridge just broke
[1:52:02] down and threw all we've had to go
[1:52:03] through the warranty but today I we got
[1:52:07] a new fridge and we didn't even pay for
[1:52:10] it thank the Lord I think they're gonna
[1:52:13] give us a food allowance too because we
[1:52:15] lost something that's really nice to
[1:52:19] hear that ice go bang in the freezer now
[1:52:31] you know nothing nothing's for free even
[1:52:34] if you get it free somebody paid so it's
[1:52:37] good to know that God just gives his
[1:52:38] children thing to make somebody else pay
[1:52:40] for it maybe we're gonna let you go turn
[1:52:44] around shake hands with somebody in the
