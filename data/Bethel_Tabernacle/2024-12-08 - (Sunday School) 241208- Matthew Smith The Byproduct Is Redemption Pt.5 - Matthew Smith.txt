TRANSCRIPT
========================================
things the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I want to turn if you would um to the Book of Ruth chapter 1 and verse one I'm I'm going to continue my series and hopefully by the grace of God part five will be the last one um and hopefully I can wrap it up today and put a bow on it otherwise maybe there'll be a part six um but I want to start in uh Ruth chapter 1 and verse one and um we'll uh I wanted to I guess the series has had a lot of um I guess uh what's the what's the word maybe the what nots to do and I want to I want to maybe this time maybe rather than focusing on where people go astray maybe focus on what it looks like when things go right and uh focus on on what we should be aiming for um so here is Ruth chapter 1 and verse one it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was IMC and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Malon and kilon ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah and they came came into the country of Moab and continued there and ALC Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was orpa and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and maalan and kilon died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband yall can be seated um now I want to maybe just you know kind of go over the the um story of Ruth briefly um if the booth could do me a favor and cut that display off because it is flickering and it's going to really distract me um and it's I'm not going to be able to focus because I'm going to be looking at that uh so um the anyway so so the story of of Ruth I'm sure everybody's very familiar with it um but you know so we you know we know that uh Ruth and orpa and and Naomi start heading back to Israel um Ruth or Naomi rather um kind of convinces them uh you know tries to convince them to both turn around and go home go back to to uh uh Moab and um orpa turns back roof doesn't they they ultimately go back to um uh Naomi's late husband his in his portion of the promised land you know every Jewish man had an inheritance a portion of of Israel that was allotted to him according to his family and according to his tribe and so when he had left that land was still belonging to him they just weren't it was sort of um maybe maybe abandoned or something like that you might say so Naomi and Ruth go back to basically take up that Old Homestead back in in Israel and that's where they're living but the problem is they get back around barley Harvest there's no food in the ground there's you know the the the field has been abandoned for however many years at least 10 years um there's no they're they're probably starving at this point and they need to get by um and you know it's just the two of them and they they can't work the field themselves and even if they could there it's wrong season to even plant anything it's going be a whole year before Anything Grows so they they Ruth goes out and decides that she's going to start gleaning in the fields right and she goes and you know this is a this was a a precept in Israel that uh you know during Harvest Time you don't harvest the corners of the fields and if if the Reapers drop anything on the ground they're not supposed to pick it up you leave that for the destitute and the and the and the the uh the people who don't have anything the Beggars essentially to come behind him and they could pick up the little the the leftovers right out of the field you know and so they would that's what gleaning is and so Ruth goes out there to just to find something to eat and so she's going out there and and and um she comes upon this field owned by a guy by the name of Boaz and she's out there gleaning um and then we get to um chapter 2 and verse 4 and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servants said unto his servant that was set over the Reapers whose who damsel is this and the servant that was set over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabi is damsel that came back from Naomi out of the country of Moab and she and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the Sheep so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she carried a little in the house um and uh I'm gonna so Boaz calls are over they have this conversation um he you know tells her you know hey uh you know I've recognized your character he he acknowledges the fact that she had left her Homeland to come to he that she had rejected her previous life to come be part of God's family um he recognizes this strong character and he um you know he he recog he you can see within himself that that's something that he wants to be associated with and he tells he pours out kindness upon her and tells her don't go anywhere else right he said keep your eyes on this field my the Reapers under my charge will take care of you don't go anywhere else right this is this is a portion set aside for you because this is mine and I have control over it and he invites her to basically have lunch with them at you know at lunchtime and he feeds her and takes care of her and then unbeknownst to her he pulls the Reapers in and he says Hey listen when you're out in the field and you see her coming in behind you dump a little on the ground on purpose right you know more than what you know just leave some for her right like we're going to we're going to take care of this girl because she had found favor in his sight he had recognized her character and um there was something about her that he had recognized not just as something Noble but something that was the same as he was right and because you know the Book of Ruth is titled The Book of Ruth and it's obviously about Ruth but it's also about Boaz right and the side of the story that a lot of people don't notice don't recognize because it's not really explicitly written although it is there is the fact that Boaz could recognize the plight that she was in because here she was a gentile the locals aren't going to take kindly to her right they might you know have some sort of you know well we're supposed to be nice to people so we're not going to be n well but you know we're not going to be go out of our way to help this woman right she's going to be absolutely be discriminated there's going to be some sort of of you know tension there she's going to be an outcast because she's a gentile right she's this Gentile woman who came in and people are going to treat her well because of that now why would Boaz taking a liking to that particularly because his mother's name was Rahab right his mama was Rahab who is a a gentile prostitute who had been incorporate like been prited into the family and been absolved of all of her past life but that didn't wipe away the fact of the way people probably treated her right no it didn't just go away people's perceptions of of who Rahab was and the perceptions of who Boaz was right no doubt there was some people who raised some eyebrows about boaz's Origins right about redeemer's Origins right there was no doubt some some some questions there so he could recognize the same kind of character that made his mother be the kind of person that she was was the same kind of character that made Ruth be who she was right there was he could see now this is why it is so important that a mother be a good mother right if young men are going to are going to use their mother as the example of who they're going to marry and if you have a poor example of motherhood then you're going to get young men marrying poor examples of motherhood okay a mother's job is probably the single most important job that any human being will ever do on the planet okay they are the determining factor in the in the in the uh trajectory of all mankind right every human being has a mother all of them and if and a good mother will will create good children and poor examples of motherhood will create poor examples of people okay and it is only by the grace of God that that anybody has a a hope of being truly good but a good good mother will certainly uh be a benefit yes amen um now so you know moving on with the story um so Ruth goes down to the down to the threshing floor or sorry you know time goes on they're they're going going along Naomi eventually tells Ruth you know that you need to go and basically um because she there's there's a connection there they we're going to go and and uh how do we say um there was a law in Israel that basically said that when you had a a a a woman who had been married and her husband died and there was no Sons to carry on the family lineage that there would be a near Kinsman who would take her as a wife and that continue the lineage of the dead husband okay now this goes all the way back to um Judah and Tamar if you're familiar with that and it's actually referenced specifically in here and hopefully we'll get to reading it um and so she's going to go to Boaz as the Kinsman to restore Naomi's dead husband's family tree right right that's what so Naomi's Redemption is in here and Ruth's Redemption is in is all tied up in this um and so she goes and so Naomi they they come together with this plan how Ruth is going to go about this and then this is going to be in um chapter 3 and: 6 and she went down the under the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had B her her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went um to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly in un covered his feet and laid her down and then skipping down to verse 14 um and she laid his feet until the morning and she Rose um up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor and also he said bring the veil that is upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the SE City and when she came into her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not rest until he have finished the thing this day um and I'm going to skip some of this reading um uh so this is in chapter 4 um and in verse 11 we'll say and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said this is after Boaz uh goes and meets the near Kinsman right because there's a near Kinsman that technically had rights and when he went to that near Kinsman and said hey are you going to buy this this land off of Naomi right because the land had to remain in the family that was part of the law and she say oh sure I'll I'll buy the land go ah but if you do you got to marry this moabit right right and the the near Kinsman says I no no I'm not going to pollute my Bloodline with that Gentile right I'm not going to do that so he it says you know I will not Mar my inheritance so he doesn't so he he basically rejects Ruth and in doing so Boaz now has rights to buy the land and marry Ruth and so then um you know and as a token brother brand if you ever hear way brother BR tells a story he basically he says that boas took his shoe off and threw it at him as the because that's the that's the uh the ancient sign that you they would give the other person their shoe so he he slaps the guy in the face with the shoe and um says all right I'm gonna go marry this girl and um the uh doesn't say that but you know brother brandom said it happened um uh okay so this is verse 11 of chapter 4 and all the people that were in the gate and all the elders said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and Leah which to did build the house of Israel and do thou worthy of Ephrata and be famous in Bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of FZ whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman okay so they're recognizing that this is a this is the whole purpose of this entire thing is the restoration of the seed line okay and then it says uh verse 13 so Boaz took Ruth and she uh she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son and the woman said unto Naomi blessed be the Lord um which hath not left thee this day without a Kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath borne him all right so this is great story a lot of people you know and so you see this as sort of like this this Romance of here's this this young woman who's kind of an outcast she comes to Israel she's got a lot of baggage previous marriage that Man's dead she's got all who knows what kind of emotional Trauma from that um and this guy decides to fall you know he falls in love with her and he marries her and it's a beautiful romantic story and it's a great example of how men should treat their wives and how women should treat their husbands and how a marriage is supposed to function and it is that it is it is all of that because it is also a type of Christ and the bride okay not only Christ and the bride both Jew and Gentile because you have Naomi and you have Ruth amen and so look at this story you have a gentile woman goes to leaves the promised land because it is no longer hospitable she goes away goes to another place into a gentile Kingdom where which if you know the name of her husband it means um I'm drawing it's I don't remember exact verbage but it's I believe it is um the Lord is my king I think is is what his name meant ALC um or something very similar to that it was a reference to God being the king over Israel and he died because the Kingdom of Israel failed when they left the promised land they go on a diaspora they go to a a gentile land when so watch this to place the story of Ruth and Boaz and how it is a type of Christ in the bride it is when Naomi the Jews go back to their Homeland in that moment now we have an uh the the um the romance between Christ and the bride that is where we have an invisible Union happened once the Jews are back in the Homeland here you have Ruth who comes into the Homeland or goes you know is now in a place where she can meet the kinsman redeemer the Redeemer watch what happens when she's gleaning in the field here you have the Boaz is a type of Christ comes to the field the field is the world right we know this is if you're study the student of the scripture you know the the field is is a representation of the world he's going to the Reapers the Reapers represent Ministry okay so here's the bride being fed by the Reapers being fed by the ministers as they as they drop you know food on the ground for her and he goes and who does he talk to the servant over the Reapers there is one man who is set over the Reapers he is part of the Reapers but he is not on you know he's a little higher because he is the intermediary between the Redeemer and the Reapers okay and his job is to one instruct the reapers on how they are supposed to handle the boaz's Affairs number one and number two he is there so that when Boaz shows up and says who is this woman the head over the Reapers presents the Gentile bride to the Redeemer okay we see the parallels here okay we have we have a a gentile bride in this day okay who is what is she's being fed there's there's ministers but there is one Prophet right there is a there is a a messenger who is the intermediary between right he's the one who's who's representing who's who's who's Christ is speaking through right who instructs the ministers on how to properly handle the bride and he's the one who presents the bride to the Redeemer okay so and so there's this and so they build this relationship this is a type of how Christians deal with our our our our relationship with God and how you know you know there there's ministers and Ministry and all these things but at the end of the day what it all comes down to is there's this moment excuse me when when it's time to actually have a real relationship they have a friendship they have an association they spend time with each other but when it comes time to really build a something that's going to be permanent right when it comes time for for Ruth to really lay claim to Boaz as the kinsman redeemer it takes Solitude it takes a moment in which she goes to Boaz alone okay that the relationship between Ruth and Boaz ultimately came down to them having a private conversation right that when she went to him it for Boaz to really be a redeemer in Ruth's life they had to have something special that didn't involve a lot of Reapers it didn't involve a lot of people right and it when people come to Christ and get a real experience with God it is a solitary experience it doesn't matter where you are you can be on in out in the woods crying out to God or you can be at an altar with 100 preachers around you it doesn't matter at the end of the day you go to God alone okay you leave behind everything else because you know nobody else is going with you it is a solitary experience amen and but when you do that you and you present your Veil to the Redeemer he watch this is such a beautiful type he puts six measures of barley in her in her veil which is a type of her submission right he reveals six seals to to her because there's a SE because he he he pulled it out of the seventh which was this giant it was the whole mountain of barley that they just harvested out of the field right there was a seventh measure but it was him yeah right the the the Redeemer was the seventh uh portion right and so when by building this relationship with the Redeemer the the whole thing is this uh it's this type of of of of the of the bride and Christ and it all culminates in one in in this um uh I would say the Pinnacle the culmination of this entire thing is the Sun that is born it's the key to the entire thing every single time that you have that you speak of redemption it all uh anytime you have um uh in the Bible throughout the Bible whenever you're talking about Redemption almost always is it associated with the birth of a child amen with the birth of a son right you look at look at Eve and Adam when Adam redeems Eve how does he do that right he does it by you know associate putting his life into her which produces Abel right Eve was redeemed through the birth of Abel okay obviously you have Ruth and and her son and and the Redemption of Ruth and Naomi were both facilitated through the through the birth of Ruth's Son by Ruth reproducing and replicating the Redeemer right that she took his life and then made that manifest we see the same thing with Mary what does Mary do she sees the word for her day and says be it unto me and produces a redeemer okay John when in in uh Revelations chap 10 what happens the mighty Angel comes down and he's given the book feed on the word and then prophesy again okay Redemption happens by feeding on the word and then prophesying if you go back to Enoch what happens with Enoch Enoch looks up at the stars brother Bram said that God wrote his his first Bible in the Stars okay wrote his first Bible in the Stars that's why Paul could say that the people in the anian world um uh rejected go the word of God because they rejected the god of nature right because God is wrote a Bible in the stars and it you know the so Enoch looks at the stars takes in the word and what does he do he builds a pyramid and brother brandom said that God the second Bible that was written was Enoch's pyramid yeah okay and if you study the pyramids you know exactly how much I mean nobody actually knows it's it's every time the more people look into this like you know people study this the more it's just mindblowing how many things are associated with that pyramid where it is like a perfect reflection of the Stars where the the astrologic the the the alignments and the the way it's it's it's shaped the the curvature there are curvatures in it that that perfectly match the curvature of the earth it's incredible but what was it Enoch took the word of his day which was written in the heavens and then believed it and then manifested it through a spoken word into a into a into again he replicated the word of God and then God raptured him right that is the purpose of this day so that we as the bride of Christ can take on the Life of Christ right that we have been given the word we've been we we have a relationship with the Redeemer you build a relationship with the Redeemer you feed on the word you you you you you all you have to do right all Ruth had to do was have a relationship with Boaz it wasn't like something that she had to like you know have this conscious decision about right it wasn't like um all she had to do was build that relationship draw close to the Redeemer to fall in love with the Redeemer that's all she had to do and when she did that then she just expressed his life right it all happened automatically and naturally as a as just a a byproduct of the relationship that she had built and that's exactly what we have to do in this day that we draw close unto God right we draw close to the word we feed on the word we draw close to it because it's the thing when you do that it will change your nature it will change who you are you know when a when you know when a uh a a woman is taking on the life of a man and is and is going to express that in the form of a baby her attitude changes radically right who she is is very different than who she was just a couple of weeks ago and it happens really fast okay you can have a a a skinny 100 PB girl who can't eat a four piece chicken nugget without leaving leftovers and then a week later she will demolish a half a meatloaf and it's like where did that come from and it's because there was there's a a new nature growing inside of her that's changing who she is she has desires she has she has has uh hunger that she didn't have before she has need to feed on things that she didn't have the need of to feed on before because the her Nature has changed because of the life that she's expressing and is and it doesn't require a whole bunch of you know chemistry lab to make that happen doesn't require a a a mathematics degree to figure that out all that has to happen is that there was a relationship that there was a closeness there was a a romance between the the Redeemer and the redeemed and it just happens automatically right and um that is the end because I'm out of time but that's that if you know I'll I'll I'll I'll we can stand and I'll and I'll pray but just in one one final statement that is the key that is going to bring people in a in a Rapture that when we feed on the word that's all it takes you feed on the word word you you draw close to God you read your Bible and pray every day because in doing that okay in doing that in drawing close to God your nature will change the your faith will grow and the thing that will bring you in a Rapture the the manifestation of that life will happen by itself automatically you don't redeem yourself Ruth did not redeem herself Boaz did the redeeming all Ruth had to do was build a relationship with the Redeemer let's pray father father Lord we thank you for this time that you've given us we thank you for the the word that you've given us we ask that you would be with us throughout the service be with us in the worship in the in the the the ultimate form of worship which is the hearing of the word the ministry would come forward and bring your word that we could feed on it and be edified by it Lord we need you in this time we couldn't do it without you lord we draw close to you we ask that you would pour out your Revelation upon us that we could see you more perfectly every day we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
