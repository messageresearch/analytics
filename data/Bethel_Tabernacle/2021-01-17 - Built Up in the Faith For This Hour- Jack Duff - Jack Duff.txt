getting your bibles we'll turn to scripture and also good to see my precious friend brother dale smith from arizona but brother dale has made tremendous impact i would say there's been ministries that come out of this church that has made many impacts in west palm beach uh brother dale was one he came down one time and he preached on the restoring of the dance i believe god my god my god my god and i will never forget that sermon and we had a wonderful time and you know i remember um brother jason coming and preaching on royalty letting us know who we were there and we had a powerful time with that and i remember we had a sister in our church that was in a wheelchair and brother matt came down and he preached um a god of the mountain and it's also god of the valley and as he was preaching just the sister in the wheelchair was so excited about the word of god she couldn't get out the wheelchair so she just took a motorized chair and just pushed it towards the front of the church saying amen amen amen we thought she was going to come out the chair that day you know all over the word of god you know but we've had some really really wonderful services amen from the various ministries that's come out of this church and we're just happy to be here with you uh on this morning i want to turn to matthew 17 musicians thank you all so much god bless you amen matthew 17. i'll read from two passages of scripture on today uh i'll read from matthew 17 and then i'll also go back to first kings 17 as well praise the lord just get my little timer set amen i try not to go over time amen matthew 17 and we're starting here at verse 14. it says this and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and so vexed for all times he falleth into the fire and off time and oft into the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me when the lord jesus can make words a declaration like that he knew he was going to take care of the situation bring him hither to me and jesus rebuked the devil amen and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast them out jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you amen how be it this kind go if not out but by prayer and fasting also let's read amen over here in first kings 17. just the first verse amen in this chapter bible declares and elijah the tishbite was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated i also just want to say how i enjoyed hearing brother jason to mars on yesterday we've talked uh via text and and uh other means of communication but uh hearing them in person i was just really blessed brother god bless you amen god bless you and we'll certainly look forward to you coming down south at some point in time amen praise the lord um i want to just take for a topic on today a man built up in the faith for this hour amen built up in the faith for this hour um there's a quote coming directly out of the message spirit i mean spiritual food in due season uh brother branham preaches this in 1965 and he says and i want you to get built up now in the holy oracles of god and the faith the faith of this hour it says the faith he said it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age amen is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up it says and so we want you to believe tonight and all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be god or not so based on all the experiences that you have gone through amen uh all the things that god allowed us to overcome before we came into this season amen let's accumulate all of that whether it was god or not and amen and as we accumulate it we should come to a spot where we realize if god did it before he's going to do it again no matter what it is that we face and i want to tell you church we haven't seen anything yet praise the lord it's more coming as it was mentioned yesterday brother branham already told us about germ warfare we knew this was coming amen but we also know that as the bride of christ we will not be defeated praise the lord amen i wanted to just kind of take us back on a a little story that we're all very familiar with and and i want to make this statement if you are a christian amen you already believe in miracles i want to say this if you are a christian uh not only do you believe in miracles but you actually believe in the impossible just being a christian amen means that you believe in the impossible things that just uh uh uh i mean that the ordinary world will not believe in you as a christian already believe in it amen glory to god now how do you say that brother jack i want to just take us back to uh just a little scene here in the book of luke if we can maybe just pick this up uh in luke chapter one and we'll we'll read a little bit from verse 26 but i just want to show you where your faith is actually resting glory to god amen just to be a christian you have to believe this amen look at this in luke chapter 1 verse 26 it says and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god uh unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin a spouse in a spouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary amen to be a christian you have to believe in this story you have to believe in the virgin birth you have to believe in the impossible just by being a christian right it says and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his thing and cast in her mind what matter uh what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god look at this and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus hallelujah he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and uh and uh and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel not like this mary didn't get so excited on on the announcement hallelujah that i'm gonna have this son i mean she had she had a legitimate question amen i realized that i'm in the presence of an angel but and i'm in the presence of something supernatural but i got a very legitimate question because i i i believe the reason mary could have this question because she had a testimony that she was ki i am a virgin i've been keeping myself i'm a spouse to a man now how am i gonna have a child you realize what this will do to my testimony hallelujah i thank god for the supernatural experience but i want to know how does this fit and she and she asked this question mary said how shall this be seeing i know not a man now watch this watch this watch this because this is language that had never been used before mary's about to hear something that she'd never heard in church before see here here i mean never one sunday that mary sit in church and the priest talk about the holy ghost not one time but here she hears something that she never heard before but she responded in a way hallelujah that we need to respond today glory to god sometimes people come to the message and they hear things that they never heard before amen as the word has been brought to them that i've never seen that in scripture before but we just want you to respond the same way mary responded mary represents you this morning you find yourself in scripture you are represented as mary this morning hallelujah look at this now look at this it says in the angel answer and said unto her the holy ghost amen shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be a born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin i love the way the angel does this because again she's never heard this before i mean wait a minute the holy ghost come upon me what what is the holy ghost she could have had more questions what is the holy ghost hallelujah and then she could ask what was the holy ghost given for [Applause] amen the holy ghost is supposed to overshadow me and cause this to come to pass mary had no clue what the angel was talking about we take the story amen because we've heard it so much we don't we don't really look at the details mary had no idea what the angel gabriel was saying to her but here she had faith in what the angel said to be truth brothers sisters there's some things we might not understand about this message but we have to have faith that what the angel brought to us is truth and what that angel spoke it shall be according to the word that is pope i believe that with all my heart he says to me hold thy cousin now this is what he does the angel says i know you've never heard this but what i'm going to do is give you something to increase your faith i'm going to tell you about something that just happened that maybe only you know that elizabeth was looking for a baby for a number of years and she could never get pregnant but i'm going to tell you something that your cousin elizabeth your cousin elizabeth amen she has also conceived a son in her old age and the angel's putting emphasis in certain parts because mary can say to herself now if if if elizabeth can have a baby in her old age then i can also have a child without knowing a man watch this it says in our old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baron i love that i love the word of god she was call bearing because now that she's expecting the baby ain't gonna bring forth the baby she won't be barren anymore [Applause] and look at this statement for with god nothing should be impossible here the angel tells her you know mary don't doubt with god everything's gonna every everything will work out just fine nothing even though you never heard this before you never heard anybody preach about the holy ghost but marry with god nothing's gonna be impossible look at mary's response because this is your this is this is in this hour when we're building you up and the faith of this hour and your pastor's coming and preaching promise after promising other ministers are coming and preaching promise after promise your response has got to be the same way mary's response was look at this and mary said see this something's got to come out of your mouth something has got to come out of your mouth not just not just mentally agree with this we got to get beyond just mentally agreeing with this something has got to be stated out of your mouth hallelujah mary said glory to god see we heard what the angel said we heard what brother branham said but now it's time to figure out what is the pride saying the bride should be saying the exact same thing that the prophet said because the spirit and the pride say come on hallelujah glory to god what does mary say mary said be it on behold the handmaiden lord be it unto me according to thy word no more questions no no no i mean i i didn't i didn't underst i didn't understand that that topic about the holy ghost i didn't understand what the angel said but no more questions being unto me according to thy word i didn't make this up i didn't come up with this you spoke it to me so i say be it unto me according to that word there are things in this message that i did not hear when i was in denominations are things that the prophet said that it really challenges that position change that we were talking about it challenges you to come to a point like mary did being unto me according to that word and notice the angel departed from her after she accepted yes the word now i got a couple things i just want to say here amen uh when we look at the word impossible because the angel said there's nothing that's impossible with god but with god all things nothing shall be impossible when we look at the word impossible that means it's incapable of occurring [Music] cannot happen now if there was anything impossible in our reading of the scripture a virgin cannot conceive and have a child it's impossible for anything like that to happen unless god is involved in the process hallelujah it's impossible for a virgin conceived we know how children are born right so so if there was anything impossible that very story was impossible but if you believe in the virgin birth it means that you already believe in miracles and you already believe in the impossible whether you experience one or not you still believe it [Applause] hallelujah here here uh uh when we look at this you know the very word impossible means it cannot be done it can't uh god god cannot violate his word that's another thing that's impossible he cannot lie uh when i was looking at a little statement here that brother branham made in spoken words original seed i won't read all of this quote but he said when mary said be it unto me according to thy word he said that statement along is what brought life into mary can you imagine that the statement that she released out of her mouth is what brought life no feeling no emotion a statement a statement a and if you want to see life come into your situation i have to ask a question what are you speaking [Applause] what are you saying right amen because just the statement alone be it unto me no not not trying to figure out let me see how this quote titled that quote and let me see how this scripture tied that no no no no be it unto me according to thy word that statement alone brought life into mary it caused her to become pregnant just by agreeing with the word of god and i believe this is what god has been trying to get his people to just agree with my word you don't have to figure it out amen just agree with my word watch it while he said uh said some other statements here amen he said mary shook away the doubt mary shook away the reason mary shook away the the unbelief and i'm gonna tell you we're gonna have to do the exact same thing in this hour in order to build our faith up for the hour in which we live we gotta shake away doubt we gotta shake away unbelief hallelujah we we feed ourselves too much unbelief oh yeah i'm gonna just put it that way we feed ourselves too much unbelief what we what we read on the internet what we see amen on cnn and on the news amen or something like that we feed ourselves too much unbelief we gotta get back to feeding ourselves the word of god hallelujah brother branham makes a statement here in the message jehovah miracles and i'm just just quoting not going to have time to read all of this she says she had mary he was talking about her set she had to believe the impossibles something that had never happened before but she never argued she never questioned anymore his word was enough for her and i i wonder are you sufficiently impressed with the word that is in your midst is the word enough for you glory to god it says but god takes the impossibles and makes them real when he is took at his word amen he says impossibles fade out when god is took at his word glory to god he says give us more mary's around here that can take god at his word and praise him whether you feel anything or not you know after mary got this this word from the angel mary didn't just hold it to herself mary actually began to testify about what had happened to him glory to god she told joseph what had happened to her he had some problems with it but god god revealed it to him and he was able to stay in his place amen but she also went to elizabeth and she began to talk to elizabeth about this testimony of the angel coming to her and uh elizabeth's like uh okay uh so uh uh you and uh joseph you're you're married right uh no uh you're you're not married you know what that means that's uh yeah i know but the angel came to me and the angel said this but i understand that but but you realize what society is going to say but i want to also want to tell you something elizabeth says you're giving me a hard time the angel also said something else the angel said that you are expecting what so now nobody knew that she was probably in hiding because she might have had so many mischaracters that she didn't think in her own age she could carry this baby but the angel said you're six months expecting yeah and then then they literally like okay now we can talk a little bit so yeah i am expecting but i need to let you know something the baby has not moved in my womb so i really don't know what to what to expect here it says but the angel told me that that my child's name is going to be called jesus hallelujah somebody elizabeth had an experience she said what did you say his name was gonna be jesus said something began to leap inside of elizabeth as soon as john heard the name jesus he had to come to life praise god hallelujah glory to god things changed inside of you literally when she heard the name jesus see see see mary just had to begin to testify about her experience and this began to bring life to other people why don't you start testifying about what god let it accumulate the things that god has already done let it accumulate so you have faith for this hour we need rapturing faith amen this statement here in the message christ is the mystery of god reveal brother branham says this is a new birth it's christ it's a revelation he says god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's that's a new birth now what are you gonna do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony i believe god is actually doing that right now bringing the revelation perfectly in harmony he says in god expressing him through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he says oh if the church only knew its position and i love this statement it will one day he says the rapture will go when it knows what it is now i'll tell you when the prophets say it will one day i believe we're coming into that day right now where the church is recognizing her position what scriptures are you fulfilling amen what scripture are you fulfilling glory to god we're recognizing who we are in the scripture i'll just give you one real easy one that you know you're fulfilling it's a it's an easy scripture very easy the bible says behold i send you elijah before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord and so i was telling telling some saints one time say i've never been able to find my name in the bible one sister say wait brother jack wait brother jack your name is in the bible i said is it she said yeah anytime you see the word you he's talking to you so just by having my heart turn to the word i can find myself in the scripture [Music] hallelujah that's an easy one we'll go a little deeper later on let's go here amen to this uh this another message here a shame uh brother branham makes this statement in his message he says so his word has to live out for every generation it says it lived itself in the days of moses because in that day the bible said in hebrews first chapter god and sundered our times and died as man spake to the fathers by the prophets and those prophets the church got all so twisted up that those prophets those daring messages of god come without church without denomination without organization without anything defy kings amen kingdoms churches and everything when the priest was brought before they was brought before the priest they wasn't ashamed because they had directly thus saith the lord he goes and says if you notice the prophet in one sense of the word in the old testament when he said thus saith the lord he says now watch him he says he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of god watch this when a prophet amen said thus saith the lord that prophet was going into the phrase of taking the place of god it says you notice when he placed out before him thus saith the lord he fell right into god and he acted as god it says then he gave his message which was god speaking through him thus saith the lord now you know that's why i read uh for us out of first kings 17 amen and verse 1 because here in this particular passage notice uh uh you know elijah he's just kind of coming and making a statement and taking the place of god oh yeah hallelujah and the bible says elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor rain these years amen but according to my words who controls the rain amen god does but here this prophet has actually taken the place of god by telling the king it's not going to rain until i say so that means you can stop your fasting you can stop your prayer you can stop on it nothing will happen can you imagine this this man said nothing will happen until i come back and call for rain the reason that elijah can say that god was actually dwelling inside of elijah he could take this authority because he knew he who he was in christ or in god let me put it that way my god what a what a place that he stood in that he could he could say when it's going to rain and when it's not going to rain amen i want you to just get this now um i want to let me just read a quote here out of spiritual food and due season the prophet makes this he said make the statement he says thank you says the prophets of the old testament or any time when they lived in the presence of god until they become the word their message is the word itself and remember he said thus saith the lord and when those men had those messages from god and they become so wrapped up and wrapped up that their own thinking it might have been against their thinking i love this statement it might have been against their thinking they might have they might not have ain't been able to see it right but they will speak in the word of god thus saith the lord there there will be there will not be any rain till i till i call for it oh what a statement he had been in the presence of god been vindicated so perfect and remember that also follows amos 3 7 the lord god will do nothing until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets said there's not going to be any rainfall now you know brother branham said sometimes these prophets get so wrapped up that it goes even against their own thinking can you imagine isaiah going around and saying a virgin shall conceive imagine you having to be the one to come out and say something like that a virgin shall conceive but he knew that god spoke that to him and he knew that no matter what god somehow was gonna bring it to pass even if it didn't make sense it was still going to be brought to pass now i was looking at this and i want to just uh take us a little deeper in this because in spiritual food and due season brother branham preaches this sermon from first kings he preaches in first kings 17 but he made some statements here you know and and and i want to make sure i'm making this very clear to us here a prophet elijah is saying it won't be any rain till i call for what a place that this man took but he was taking the place of god the reason he could take the place of god is because god was dwelling in him right yeah amen i want you to know god is dwelling in you amen i i hear brother brother brother jason been been making the statement we got to find where the i am is yes we got to find where the i am is and i'm telling the i am is in you amen but this prophet amen takes the place of god and makes this statement but in the message of a spiritual food and due season brother branham does something that just caught my attention brother branham says amen in this man says i'm going to type elijah with the church of today i want you to think about that now here's a prophet preaching about another prophet and he's actually taking on the spirit of elijah but rather in spiritual food and due season type that prophet to his ministry brother branham makes a statement i'm gonna type elijah with the church of today which means the bride of today hallelujah [Applause] it's in there i can't i can't read it all you can go back and listen to the prophet type elijah to the bride now don't don't get me wrong sometimes you say things like this and people think you're going way over here somewhere no i know brother branham was the type of elijah but i'm telling you amen that brother branham typed in this message elijah to the bride why would he do that so the bride can recognize who she is and if the if the prophet elijah has the ability because god was dwelling in him to say it would not be any rain i need you to understand you have that same ability inside of you if god would ask you to do it now you don't just do this on your own but if god calls you to it you have that ability why because there's nothing impossible unto you [Applause] let's look at these statements that the brother that the prophet makes he says i'm to type elijah with the church today the church of today it says sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought uh brought it to a place of oncoming judgment they turn from god's word and his prophet to a modern theological terms of the word he says just before the judgment and he was taught about this judgment that was given to come you know the fire is going to fall uh there uh against the the prophets of baal and so on and so forth but before that judgment he says a message was received glory to god and we can see ourselves in this because before the judgment's getting ready straight to earth we have received a message we're fellowshipping under this message and brother brandon made the statement i'll repeat it he said if this ain't that i'm just gonna hold on to this until that comes so there really is no need i had a conversation with somebody that you know had walked away from the word and and uh they they approached us you know they began to talk they say they say i guess it's really no need to talk to you i said you're absolutely right i'm not even considering it i'm not even thinking about it so there's no need to even waste your breath and talk to me i'm sorry i i i tried baptists i've tried pentecost there's no way i'm going back to that and i'm gonna tell you where where when when i was there it's much worse today than it was when i was there so there's no way you're going to get me to go back into nothing like that so if this ain't that let me just hold on to this until that comes [Applause] before the message before the message of judgment he said he said they received this message a message of grace that come and another thing he said about uh typing typing elijah to the bride to the church he says he had received he had a secret place hallelujah he says he had a secret place that was ordained of god and provided by god during the time of drought amen elijah had a secret place we as the bride we have a secret place that has been ordained by god to keep us during this time of drought glory he says if the bride is sustained through the spiritual drought of today glory to god another thing he said he said he received food every day elijah received food every day and i love the way this this this worked out because elijah didn't just have room service elijah had raven service blessed be the name of the lord i mean he didn't i mean he didn't even have to say what he wanted to eat the ravens just brought it in in the morning and they brought it in in the evening god made sure that the prophet was sustained during this time of drought a drought that he caused god will sustain your church and if we can just look back through the last year if we're sitting here right now we know god did sustain us and if we can just accumulate just accumulate what god has already done just keep accumulating that we'll see that he's going to bring us through again and again and again and again he received food every day he never had to worry about it running out and our secret place is found in christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just reading this a little quote here out of spiritual food and ducey says during the time that he was going to punish the unbeliever uh he made a way for the believer and this isn't there any time in the days of noah god made a way for noah amen in the days of and lot was a mate believer but god still made a way for him so here in this hour we know god's going to make a way for us during the time that he was going to punish the unbeliever he made a way for the believer the same thing he does each time in the days when he was going to destroy the world by water amen he made a way of escape of no for noah in the days that he was going to drown egypt he made a way of escape across the sea for his people how god makes his way and where there is no way he is that way he is that way you know we say how a prophet can just take the place of god can speak something sometimes it goes against uh what he's even thinking but because uh uh because he's so wrapped up in god that these things just come out hallelujah and god actually backs up what he says it wasn't just with elijah that just happened in scripture but we we can look at the story of moses in the book of exodus they were coming out of egypt amen and god you know many of those things that god told moses to speak uh you know and and it was just spoken word creation that was happening down inside of egypt but they finally got to a spot where now they're coming out they're on their way uh their only way to the promised land and as they're coming out as they're exiting egypt god had multiple ways that they could go but he actually said no i don't want them to get too early in battle and all that they might get a little discouraged it says so i'm going to have them go by the way of the red sea now it seems like god is not a good general that he forces the people to go to the red sea and when they get there they're at the red sea can't see their way through it can't see their way over it can't see anywhere under it can't see nothing because they've never faced anything like this hallelujah glory to god and not only that they hear the chariots of pharaoh coming behind them and they begin to just maybe a panic uh moses what are we gonna do hallelujah to the lamb of god moses what are we going to do and and unless they're in that condition moses had no idea of what to do glory to god i want to read this amen let's read it from exodus 14. i want to read this i want us to see brother branham also picks this up and he makes a statement to us that we hold dear exodus chapter 14. i want to read from verse 13 i believe glory glory glory glory amen manny man uh i might have the exodus 14. okay uh yeah so here here it says uh moses now while they're in this this this um panic state let's put it that way they're panicking it says moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you to show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever and i need you to understand god never told moses to say that god never told him amen moses i want you to go out and do it this way god never gave him instruction on speaking that verse moses spoke that under inspiration i want to know what's coming out of your mouth [Music] and not only did moses speak speaking on inspiration god backed it up [Applause] the egyptians that you see today you will see them no more forever now after moses comes from under the inspiration he says this in verse 14 he says the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace now the problem is this is where the prophet brings it out to us the problem is verse 15 and the lord said unto moses wherefore cries down to me speaking to the children of israel that they go forward the problem is here what happened between his inspiration amen and now the action what happened in between here now inspiration he says they know the lord gonna fight for you you know the egyptians that you've seen today you'll see him no more forever but what happened between that and god having to rebuke moses [Applause] in between verse 14 and 15 something happened and brother branham told us this is this is the nature of man to do this when we begin to go through certain things in our life we begin to cry unto god but god speaks back to his people god says why cry speak open up your mouth and speak and move forward we must recognize who we are so we all get trapped in between verse 14 and 15. but it doesn't change god's mind glory god still wants us to speak and move forward didn't you just say moses that i'm going to fight for you then you just say it's going to happen then you say the egyptians not going to be seen anymore why are you doubting and crying now moses speak and go forward god did something so supernatural that we still talk about it today when he parted the red sea and they walked through on dry land hallelujah look if god can do things like that in the old testament i want to tell you jesus christ is the same yesterday today of heaven amen he can take care of a virus he can take care of a plague he can do it no matter how many strands come forth our god is able to take care of that hallelujah glory to god i believe that church moses spoke under inspiration he could take the place of god and speak this and then god backed it up what happened when they went through the red sea that the children of israel made it through on dry land but the the egyptians were drowned the egyptians they sing that day they saw no more forever that's right now there's gonna be some other egyptians just not those egyptians let's go on brother brandon makes a statement i i just he said um god was going to sit down after he saw moses and children of israel coming out god was so pleased with what he was seeing that brother bram said god was on his way to go sit down when he heard moses cry out what shall i do he said what you can't you can't be you gotta you gotta be kidding what what did jesus say what shall i do speak and move forward moses i want to tell you that this morning church speak amen go forward and i'm going to say it like this whether you feel it whether you see it whether you understand it [Music] the prophet says this and god hiding himself in simplicity revealing himself in the same it says if you abide in me my words abide in you ask what you will it shall be given to you amen where is the church standing at it says let there be frogs and there wasn't a frog in the country and he says uh and there wasn't a frog in the country in an hour's time they were 10 foot deep in places it says what was it it was god the creator hiding himself in a simple man amen that same god is hiding himself in you now i want to go a little further here we got uh taking the place of god we see uh moses can do that moses did it uh uh elijah did it i want to show you also brother branham did it in a different situation there's multiple situations where brother branham actually said he took the place of god all right but i won't read all of that but i want to show you in one one situation that you all would uh probably remember this isn't a message speak to this mountain it says well i i stepped out to one side and the spirit of the lord came upon me and began to shake and they said and i said the spirit lord said there is a trap set for you and be thou careful what you say amen it says fred where are you at it says are you in the meeting here tonight he says i know he come over yes right back here that's right we left there and i told brother sophomores something's fixing to happen and when he when we got to that to the meeting that night i said to the audience remember thus saith the lord there's a trap set for me and all of you pray that i'll know what no no to do the right thing when this comes to pass now now i find this i'm gonna i'm gonna keep reading but i have to just inject this the same god that knew there was a trap for the prophet yeah it's also the same god that could have stopped the trap from happening amen amen you have to ask the question why didn't god stop it it's because god wanted to see what was in his prophet can i ask you another question i want to give this to you why does god allow you to go through certain trials and tribulations because god wants to see what is inside of the next thing next night it happened the devil sent in two people a young boy and a girl to break up the meeting and that was it was in not new hampshire but vermont freddie you remember the name of the city it was the capital of vermont we were just across lake champlain and so when we uh so when we were in the meeting this boy the girl looked like just across uh looked like kind of a mongolian girl but the boy was just holding him they were both at least 25 years old a piece but such immoral acts in a church it says they were setting about like this from me and when i started preaching he would just grab him throw her head back and climb up and make uh uh climb up on our kids and carry on just act off when the meetings and the ushers couldn't make him be quiet and i said to him from the platform i said young man don't do that you're attracting the attention while i'm preaching he said and he just laughed right out at me i thought oh oh there it is there's the trap right there now now i don't know if many of us here would have been spiritual enough to recognize that was a trap but here the prophet called he said oh there it is there's a trap right there it says i went right ahead speaking just the same and though he got so immoral with her till i had to stop again i said don't do that sir please i said if you want to make uh make love to the young lady then you leave the building but this is a religious meeting say you shouldn't do that please don't do that while i'm preaching i started again he just made it worse look at this it says and then when i when i was a turn i said now something said to me something said to me say what you will and it'll be done i stood there mr mercer the tape boy and all of them standing brother bread brother fred and many of them standing uh standing pretty the perspiration was just running from me something said say blindness it'll be blind say death they'll pack them out say what you will hallelujah say what you will i couldn't speak i couldn't move and they just left i thought god what must i do and i turned and he stood there and his face white looking at me i i thought what must i say then i turn and looked before i ever know what i'd said i said i forgive you [Music] of your act yes look at this the prophet says and it must have been the right thing to say it was god trying a reaction on an action and i want to tell you something when you're going through different trials and tribulations god is just trying to react it's not the action that's the problem the reaction is what god is looking at and here in this situation brother branham took the place of god he could have pronounced death and it would have been death he could have pronounced blindness and there would have been blindness whatever he said would have come to pass right there at that moment but because god was in him he said the right thing i forgive you maybe just maybe yeah we might see a freedom or release and some of our family members if we could practice the same words maybe after this service maybe we can go tell somebody i forgive you amen yes even if they didn't apologize i forgive you did this group did this get brother and sister i can't even call him brother and sister this young man and young woman did they apologize no they laughed at the prophet but he still said i forgive you he took the place of god in this situation see this type of power is something that we know we need character with because power without character is satanic let me go forward here in uh in our in our sermon now i want to slip back over to our scripture i want to ask this question i i brought out three different instances where prophets have taken taken the place of god elijah took the place of god moses took the place of god and even in our day god's prophet took the place of god i have a question for you is this only for prophets is this only for prophets and i can prove to you that in scripture it's not only for prophets because there was one day uh a man that was begging at the at the temple gate he wanted some wanted some arms he's you know i need this and i need that and he's just sitting there begging and just trying to get whatever he can from whoever would give it but on this day peter and john happen to be coming to the temple and they saw him sitting there at the gate and when they saw him something just began to rise up and pete and brother branham said no doubt jesus passed by that gate many times and the reason jesus passed by saw the man he never did anything because he was leaving this for the disciples there are some things that have been left for us brother branham's not here anymore but jesus is here and there are some things that have been left for us to take care of church we have to rise to our position in christ and take care of god's business amen he says he left him there he left him there and here come the disciples passing by the gate on this day and something just struck me and said i don't know i don't know why this this he says wait a minute stop stop stop john says hey sir yes you know give me a give me a dollar two dollars whatever no no no no look on us what do you mean it's silver and gold have we none we don't i don't have any money to give you hallelujah it says but such as i have i give unto thee he had the power of god in him amen the faith that the and the brother branham even said this about this man he says the faith that was in jesus christ dropped down inside of this man and cause him to believe what peter was saying to him hallelujah church when our faith has run out we need the faith of god to come on the inside and it's gonna take that kind of faith to get ready for a rapture hallelujah the faith of jesus christ dropped down to this man and calls him to believe the word of god amen it says he said simon go have a number look on us simon go have we done but such as we have we give unto thee rise up and walk in the name of the lord jesus christ peter was not a prophet amen but the spirit of god was dwelling in peter that caused him to be able to bring this miracle to pass amen oh yes hallelujah church amen hallelujah church brother branham makes some statements here it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he says it was behold behooving the saint peter the old fisherman didn't have enough education to sign his own name but one day when he was going through the beautiful gate that solomon had built there laid a man who was lame his knees was weak ankles he couldn't walk he bend that way hat he had no strength a man about 40 years old he had no strength but when peter heard the cup rattle and he looked down and seen a crippled man laying there something pounded in his heart he he had been at pentecost his experience produced this he had been at pentecost he had the holy ghost he had the promise of jesus so it was behooven it was becoming to him that he said still and go have a nun he gave his testimony wow that's all it did that's what produced a miracle he gave his testimony sometimes we want to be so deep with people brother branham say just tell them how it got lit give your testimony simple things he gave his testimony i have no silver and gold but such as i have i'll give it i'll give it to you if you can receive it it's like his brother ma'am said i can imagine the man say i can receive it it says then in the name of jesus christ of now to stand on your feet and be made well and he reached down and got him to exercise his faith raise him up like that and his ankle bones received strength and he went leaping and praising and glorifying god we need services like this amen we need a move of the spirit like this but we just need people to just get a hold of some simple faith now i want to get back to this scripture here uh before before i do uh i i got to say this uh this god perfected this church brother branham makes this no no no i can i'll save that i'll save that this scripture that we read in matthew glory to god matthew 17. this man had an epileptic son that was falling in fire and falling in water and the devil was trying to kill this this little boy i mean he was trying to kill him just in anything he could to kill this boy yeah the father had brought because he saw uh the disciples uh in the company of jesus he thought for sure if i just get him to the disciples they'll they'll get this thing taken care of i just need him to be with somebody that's been with jesus that's what the father's faith was but here jesus you know comes on the scene and and brother branham gives us um an understanding as to what was really going on here brother adams showed us that the reason that the disciples really couldn't do anything about this is because they were competing with one another hallelujah he says what was happening say peter would say well see this happened when i went out and prayed for the sick so let me show you how to do it and then nothing would happen so then maybe john said peter the reason you know you're not getting any results because that that wasn't you that you know let me show you what i did and this is what happened in my meeting and then maybe maybe the next one said this is what happened i mean they were competing with one another and as they were competing with one another nobody was getting any work done we make it all about us i'm not trying to make it like that amen it's still all about christ but we have to realize when we find out where the i am is the i am is living inside of us it's not you're doing this in your own strengths hallelujah this is because the i am is dwelling on the inside of you now look at this brother adam brother branham tells us that they were competing with one another and as they're going through this these motions and then if the father finally see jesus come on the scene he's like you know look i took him to your disciples they weren't able to get nothing accomplished says is there anything you would be able to do for me i i don't like seeing my son in this condition i don't like seeing them you know i have to i'm constantly watching i'm not sure winning on getting fired when he gonna i just don't know jesus i need help yeah yeah amen amen jesus said to what faithless generation bring them unto me and the bible say he rebuked that devil and and when he rebuked it that devil had the hardest fit that he ever had i'm gonna tell you something when things get harder it might be because it's getting better right now [Music] i want to say that again when things get harder it might be because it's actually getting better man you know his son has this this terrible feeling jesus said no just pick him up he's going to be all right going home with him now and you know the boy was delivered and you know just a supernatural event took place the disciples had their eyes on that and privately i love the way he does this not publicly they he didn't put it on on facebook or instagram or anything you know the reason that they couldn't get it done he didn't do any of that it was privately that he spoke to the disciple they asked say why can we get the job done yeah i want you to understand his answer right your unbelief amen you know what brother branham said it wasn't that the disciples did not have the power right they actually had the power jesus gave them the power and never took it away from them right right right it was their unbelief amen you want to know what's stopping us our unbelief and this is why i have a prayer i'll be the first one to admit some it's my unbelief that gets in god's way my unbelief right he said but but i have a prayer the same way there was another gentleman that approached jesus he said lord i believe but help my unbelief amen and that's my prayer god help my unbelief help me to just just to doubt my doubts help me to believe god and to only brother branham makes a statement here in the message god perfecting his church see how the devil robs you says oh you can't do this and all things are possible to them that believe no matter what it is you're a part of deity she said don't let the devil rob you says you're part of deity son or daughter not a servant a son or daughter he goes on he says why brother it surpasses all angels archangels and everything else it becomes right into the presence of the potter himself and how are we brought through the blood amen then you come into deity you become a part you're welded in amen amen he says let's think of god unfolding around him now we're going to enlarge it billions of times from this blood cell and there god and his blood cell folded himself up and wrapped himself in this blood cell and come to redeem man to life hallelujah then when the blood cells spread out spread out and brought the body of christ jesus jehovah himself was tabernacled in him that through the bursting of that blood cell at calvary might bring sons and daughters to himself the blood cell to the blood of the lord jesus christ into himself and we become part of god amen i told you i didn't hear that in my baptist church i didn't hear that in my pentecostal church i only heard things like that in this message we become part of god amen and look at what the prophets say after he makes that statement he says that's what makes satan mad amen it says that's what shakes him when the church of jesus christ only knew who they were brother oh you say i know there is nothing impossible with god i know there's nothing impossible god he said he said there's nothing impossible to you amen amen that changes the subject amen and if we just spend a little bit more time on on what the new subject is that there's nothing impossible to you see in mary's situation said there was nothing impossible with god but in this situation where jesus was casting out this devil he told them there's nothing impossible to you brother branham say that change is the subject yeah recently we were on a minister's call and i mean uh one of the morning calls and brother eugene braun made a statement he says you know typically when we're preaching now because of how brother branham brought the message to us he says typically you know there's there's three things that god was trying to do says he was trying to reveal himself to the his people threefold mystery of god is then he was trying to um you know have the preeminence in his people yeah and then he was trying to restore us back to eating conditions again these were the three things god's trying to do he said in most sermons that you're going to hear from now on are going to be sermons that deal with one of those three things this is just where we're at church this just we're at you're going to hear this until we get into that place where we're recognized who we are yeah the prophet says that's what makes satan mad that's what shakes him when the church of jesus christ only knew who they were brother or you say i know there's nothing impossible god he said there's nothing impossible to you amen that changes the subject doesn't it oh says there's nothing nothing impossible to god he said there's nothing impossible with you whatever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it good hallelujah i gotta read a couple more statements here this is out of the message resurrects resurrection of lazarus he says now notice then there's that's where you are that's what's the matter with you pentecostal people now i it's my lot this afternoon to preach and i have a right here at the platform and i don't never i don't ever want to know any person from the flesh when i'm standing here that's what's the matter with the pentecostal people they don't recognize who they are your sons and daughters of god you have in your hand look g then jesus uh it was one time quoting scripture ye are gods it says look deity says i'm a part of charles branham because i was born from charlie branham my daddy i'm a part of him i've got a forehead like him my hair was like him i'm a small man like him i'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of god deity dwells in the man hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open he said they said nothing impossible to god god said nothing impossible with you if you believe not with god but you deities in man [Music] it says the very god that stood back during the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off of his hands and created these things gives you the privilege to be his son and you are part of him and god dwells in mankind and man himself is deity hallelujah there you are it might choke you but study over that a little while see god dwells in man man becomes a son of god not him in himself but the holy spirit that's in him is god the creator lives in the creation [Music] oh my how i think of that then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done unto you there he is god there he is we found where the i am is he's dwelling in those that have the baptism of the holy ghost there are some other statements i'm just going to drive this home when a spirit born spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips it's the same yeah as deity speaking amen amen another the prophet also said every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man glory to god now i want to just slip into a little thing here there's another statement here out of the message the comforter brother branham say the word that was made flesh is talking about john 1. the word that was made flesh the word that was was god was with god and you know all that he said that word was made flesh but he also said that word has become our flesh it says all uh and who is god it says all they have to do is just speak the word not pray just speak the word that's all it says it would be done because every demon had to obey him this is when jesus came to you know the centurion's house and prayed for that servant he said he spoke spoke the word he said never even lay hands on him he spoke the word he says every demon would have to obey him do you believe that tonight he says every demon will obey god it has to amen but it didn't stop there everything obeys god and it'll obey you yes that's right if you have faith i said every demon obeys god and it will obey you yes if you have faith all right church i want to bring this to a close and i'm going to read to you a quote this is a faith for this hour you know when brother branham would preach various things and i mean like i said i didn't hear this in my denominational churches no one told me that deity was dwelling inside of me i didn't hear that come on i i mean deities in in in heaven even brother branham say you know we're not worshiping christ in a manger we worship with christ the christ in you the hope of glory right i mean it's time for us to recognize who we are and that that's that's why i can i can have faith to even come out at a time like this and still go to a meeting there's some people you know they're afraid to get out and go anywhere right now and and i hate to say it but i think they're going to be that way for a long time you're going to be that way for a long time because every time you turn around there's something new coming out and now you're you're running from that you we we can't run we got to speak and move forward amen that's all we can do church glory to god amen i'm not taking it lightly i realize that you know we have some that have lost loved ones to this it's real cancer is also real right cancer is real diabetes is real you know all these things are real people die from all kinds of things but we don't know how we're going to leave here we don't know so you know i mean playing planes going down is real car accidents happen every day these things are real you couldn't leave here and get in a car accident but does that mean stop driving cars no no stop getting in planes no that's not what it means to me all right amen glory to god so i mean we gotta we gotta we have to have a elevated faith let's accumulate the things that god has already done let's think on those things and if he's brought us through before we automatically know he's going to bring us through again amen we need faith for rapture amen praise the lord there's this this message here brother branham is going to start us out in a prayer i want to read this quote i'm going to set you up this quote is what i call an interactive quote there's things you need to do right i'm not going to tell you what to do i'm going to tell you just listen to the word act like mary be it unto me amen according to that word in the message oneness the brother brother branham says ah heavenly father laying here is a bunch of handkerchiefs gloves they may go out in the mail i don't know who laid them here maybe billy maybe the people here in the audience i just feel to do this now lord there's nothing in my hands nothing in me as a human being i couldn't rely on my own human understanding i don't understand why this is so but i'm following what you said they took from the body of paul handkerchiefs and aprons and evil spirits went out of the people it wasn't because he was a great man it was because that god was with him in word and power and he never consulted the apostles but found out when they met together that same gospel the same form of baptism the same everything that they were doing was i to i the same now i'm asking lord for these precious people that's believing you that that you will heal them them in the audience heal them lord may their faith just reach up and get a hold of what that word uh what the of of that word right now said and say tumor sickness evil you might as well leave i'm cutting with the sword of god i'm believing my faith is strong i'm pressing the sword deep move out of my way i'm rising from my seat to be well i'm laying my hands upon my father upon my sister and my child

let that uncircumcised philistine stand there and defy the armies of the living god oh god make man and women rise in the power of the spirit let that unconverted that dejected devil that's harmed the human race down through the age stand there and defy the church of the living god satan come out in the name of the lord jesus christ now the prophet saying now you that got strength enough to yield a sword it says now that you got understanding enough in god's word to claim it to be your personal property every promise that he made you it is your personal property it says who can pick up the word of god and now in your hand hold it out in the hand of faith and say i take my side with the lord i'll be oneness with my god from this on our yield the sword of the spirit in this word and i'll cut

thank you for the opportunity to be able to stand before his congregation and i pray that you bless the people father it's in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you church god bless you hallelujah [Applause] my goodness how many happy to be in the house of god today amen you know i was thinking about um as brother jack was just going from point to point to point building such a beautiful picture for us you know everything you heard today is exactly the truth and has been taught not only taught but proven in the age that we live in was taught to us clearly by a prophet you know i'm thinking about mary and i i never realized that brother jack how that i mean she's hearing the holy ghost will overshadow you wha what is that what i don't i never heard that in synagogue what are you talking about how's that going to work but you know something there was there was something in mary that you almost couldn't quite explain i doubt she could fully explain it to herself but son like the queen of sheba the queen of sheba just said all my heart was made i mean everything was discerned somehow the word reached down and she said it was even more than i imagined it would be he told me all my heart i think that's what happened to mary i think mary i mean listen friends that's happened to you how many can witness in here today say i heard the word of god and somehow it told me my whole life it must be the truth i'm going to say amen to every word of god i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know what it's going to look like but i know it's true and i know i believe it said why do you believe it the world don't believe it well i don't know but i do amen amen i don't know how they don't believe it i can't not believe it something inside me brother this ain't about this ain't you this is him hallelujah wow man oh man oh man now you know i'm gonna tell you something don't don't be like don't be like moses where you know he got up under all that inspiration here you are in this church service and under all that inspiration but you know what when my when church service was over the sea was still there and it was still closed and the egyptians were still coming [Applause] and somehow after the anointing was gone and the trials were still there faith began and god said don't you cry to me you remember how you felt when you were hearing a word you remember how you felt when you were inspired to claim it so we can go forward stretch out your rod over that one hallelujah that's what this is about friends we're here to stretch a rod out over to the circumstance and speak and say give way hallelujah oh my god that that's what he that is in you is all about and you know what moses could have done that if he had if his heart would have been condemning him if moses would have still been like some of those israelites and still craving egypt he'd have never had the courage to stretch that rod out i'm gonna tell you something friends if you got a craving for egypt get that out of your heart because god can do more for you than you can ever even imagine he's here to do the impossible i just accept it i just accepted i gave up long time ago trying to make me perfect i'm just going to let him do it i'm just going to believe his word i'm going to get rid of egypt out of my life and i'm going to say now lord you take it from here hallelujah oh my god had to be the one to do it moses stretched that rod out but then a strong east wind had to blow all night and i'm looking for that that's what it means for the i am to be speaking in you you know that's what when when god told brother branham pick up your pen and write that's i mean we we were stunned i remember talking to my daddy they were stunned to have a prophet go off the scene and you mean it's not going to be him anymore it's going to be that the final voice is going to be the people it's going to be the bride yeah and the lord told him that and pick up your pen and write i went and found the quote and he says as the end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came that's john from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner all right now what's he going to do when he comes he's going to do the same thing by pointing the people to a word-born bride now this is god speaking brother brown said i know what i was writing until i went back and read it the bride of christ the bride of christ the prophet's gone the bride of christ will be pointing to the skies at the appearing of jesus screaming behold the lamb of god guess what the next words are the lamb of god will come forth from his lips because the i am is the one speaking and it's the i am in his bride it's coming forth from his lips and a bride hallelujah i say we call for the rapture i say we call for the millennium i say we call to an end of the devil's power over our life and the influence of the enemy oh you can tell i ain't got to preach in a while i'm here today some friends it's time for the bride to rise up and put the devil in his place [Applause] and let him know that we know who's running things around and it ain't lucifer hallelujah he can't even begin his ride because the bride is here to hinder it and it burns him it burns him that he's got he's got all the presidents all the premiers all the prime ministers all the cabinets all he got a kremlin he's got the white house he's got the u.n he got all the churches all the schools all the social all the entertainment and it burns him that he can't get that little bitty bride it just burns when i say we were to burn him today you ain't getting me you ain't getting my family you ain't getting anything that god has given me blessed be the name of the lord god is good friends yes how many heard from god today you know what you were doing you were drinking from the fountain that never runs dry [Applause] why don't you just try it one time and just take the word of god believe what a prophet said put it on your lips and speak it when you get done speaking that red sea might still be there it might still be closed the egyptians might still be on you but when you speak that that goes forth like a seed and brother brown said creativity creation starts turning and things start moving it can't fail if you'll stand and believe every word of god i don't care what your situation is today how many wanna take your situation i don't care what it is you might have more than one bothering you right now and say i'm gonna put my situation on the word of god and lay it on his shoulders and say father i'm here today to believe what i heard and i'm gonna speak my deliverance today in the name of jesus christ how many willing to say that in the name of jesus christ because we realize where the word is where the i am is it's in the bride and she has thus saith the lord as it comes from his lips [Applause] you tell the devil that next time when you give a command and the devil don't move say listen satan that didn't come from my lips that came from his lips and you best get to move hallelujah [Music] oh my brother anthony you better sing wow
