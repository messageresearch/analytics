[25:51] amen do you want to do his will do you
[25:53] love him tonight amen don't you just
[25:55] love to be in church wouldn't wouldn't
[25:56] want to be anywhere else been looking
[25:58] forward to this all day long wouldn't
[26:00] want to be at work that's for sure
[26:02] wouldn't want to be out in the world
[26:03] somewhere that's for sure rather be
[26:06] right here with Believers for looking
[26:07] forward to the word and we got brother
[26:09] Jason he's coming out just in a moment
[26:11] gonna speak for us and give us a report
[26:14] and also and carry the word tonight so
[26:16] I've been looking forward to this all
[26:18] day amen you can have your seats just
[26:20] for a moment we just wanted to make just
[26:22] a few announcements and I know there's a
[26:25] lot missing here tonight
[26:26] but they'll get this uh either by live
[26:29] stream or by archive we just have more
[26:32] things to say uh with youth camp coming
[26:35] up so I'll just take just two minutes
[26:36] really quick then I'll have brother Ken
[26:38] sing again and why Brother JD come out
[26:40] and if anything I miss brother Jason can
[26:43] clear up if I'm if I quote from October
[26:45] chapter 4 verse 3 or anything like that
[26:48] he can certainly clear that up for me I
[26:51] just wanted to make just a couple
[26:52] clarifications because there's been a
[26:55] lot of uh questions now that
[26:57] registration is over registration is
[26:59] full we filled up
[27:01] um yesterday so we were about a day and
[27:05] I think by noon the next day it was full
[27:07] and we've got quite a waiting list now
[27:09] uh seemed like about every 30 minutes we
[27:11] had people signing up for that so God's
[27:14] got everything in control amen and if he
[27:16] wants a young person there at the last
[27:18] two years we've been able to get every
[27:20] single one on the list there's actually
[27:22] potentially more room with this Camp
[27:24] than what we've held registration at but
[27:27] we really need to get through the first
[27:29] year uh rather than have everyone show
[27:31] up for our first time and be unprepared
[27:33] so uh Lord willing we'll we'll be able
[27:35] to look at that a little bit closer but
[27:37] Camp is coming up
[27:39] and it's not October chapter four it's
[27:41] October 19th
[27:43] um and so
[27:44] we wanted to say as far as the
[27:47] registration because there was some
[27:49] confusion on the pricing for
[27:51] registration so let me just clarify this
[27:53] uh for everybody and there my dad also
[27:57] who's not here tonight they've traveled
[27:58] to North Carolina for my great aunt and
[28:01] Jules uh great great aunt Jules uh
[28:03] funeral with my grandmother also so keep
[28:06] them in prayer they traveled up there
[28:08] today and will be there at the funerals
[28:10] tomorrow but he will when he returns
[28:13] make some more just remarks bringing
[28:16] everybody up to speed as far as this
[28:17] church
[28:19] um I am so excited that we've got a
[28:22] church that has a vision for youth and I
[28:25] believe that that's a unanimous Vision
[28:28] amongst the body of Believers here we've
[28:30] got a lot of young families a lot of
[28:31] young people and so the the Youth Camp
[28:34] was started out of a burden from parents
[28:37] all the parents collectively uh in this
[28:39] church wanting to see God do something
[28:41] for their children and I am so glad I
[28:44] can report the Lord Has Done miraculous
[28:46] things in our family in this church and
[28:49] families and not just the blessing that
[28:52] he's brought to the young people but
[28:54] even to us old folk and some of us older
[28:57] folk than me the Lord has brought a lot
[29:00] of a lot of blessing it's been a
[29:02] refreshing amen is that how you feel
[29:04] been a refreshing Youth Camp has been so
[29:06] refreshing so we're looking forward to
[29:08] that and all the youth functions that we
[29:10] have throughout the year
[29:12] um we're just thankful for all the work
[29:14] and all the help that goes into that so
[29:16] as far as pay it actually the 250
[29:21] dollars I want to say it's 252 is
[29:23] actually the price for everybody
[29:25] everyone so when we charge 250 we don't
[29:30] make a dime we don't make one dollar Off
[29:32] Youth Camp there won't be a penny made
[29:34] from registration
[29:35] my dad has elected as a from a burden
[29:38] for the young people and the counselors
[29:40] who are coming to work the whole week
[29:43] um going to be given of themselves to
[29:46] the young people they serve an essential
[29:48] role at Youth Camp they played a massive
[29:51] part to the success of our camp because
[29:53] we did things so different with the
[29:56] counselor we didn't do as we said this
[29:57] before we did not do a sign up sheet for
[30:00] counselors but part of the original
[30:02] Vision that we had was to hand select as
[30:06] the Lord would allow people that we know
[30:08] that we have trust in we trust their
[30:11] testimony and that we know personally
[30:12] not just the Holy Ghost Field adult
[30:15] that's an absolute given but also
[30:18] there's certain characteristics of of
[30:21] certain personalities of people who work
[30:24] well with young people and so we wanted
[30:26] to make sure it was people that that
[30:28] were willing able and that that would
[30:30] meet the criteria that we were going for
[30:32] and the Lord really blessed that we got
[30:36] reports of that from so many other
[30:38] churches just the way that when there
[30:41] was not us it was the Lord who put it
[30:42] upon our heart to do it that way this
[30:44] year we have more we have 45 is that
[30:48] right counselors this year so quite a
[30:50] number
[30:51] uh and we have all of those everybody
[30:53] all the counselors are full we have all
[30:55] the brothers and all the sisters we have
[30:58] registration for kids uh is full the
[31:01] work crew that we needed
[31:03] um is at 20 I think is 20 daily is that
[31:06] right something around that so we need
[31:08] about 25 more but I wanted to clarify my
[31:11] dad as a burden decided to subsidize the
[31:14] price for young people and counselors so
[31:18] uh he'll say more on that when he comes
[31:20] but that is a deficit no matter how you
[31:24] look at it because the amount the
[31:25] difference between that will be
[31:26] subsidized obviously he couldn't do that
[31:28] for everybody who's coming and so myself
[31:31] my family all the families who are have
[31:35] spent
[31:36] you know countless months for the past
[31:38] eight or nine months uh preparing
[31:41] working planning we've taken multiple
[31:44] trips to Greenville of our own out of
[31:47] our own pocket take it off work uh spent
[31:49] hours and time so it's a labor of love
[31:52] it's a it's a sacrifice uh of love that
[31:55] everybody who's in who who has who has
[31:58] given the musicians who have played for
[31:59] the last two years have came up and all
[32:02] the helpers the deacons the brothers the
[32:03] sisters sound crew tech crew Everybody I
[32:06] don't want to leave anybody out that has
[32:08] went it has been out of our own accord
[32:09] no one's got paid we haven't made a dime
[32:12] so if that was ever assumed uh or
[32:15] presumed I should say it's incorrect
[32:16] we've not been paid for it I paid for my
[32:19] kids everybody in the group pays for
[32:21] their kids I pay my 250 everybody does
[32:24] so no one's exempt from that the only
[32:26] ones who don't pay that amount is the
[32:28] group of the young people and the um the
[32:33] counselors I want to make sure we got
[32:36] that it's a labor of love but it's for
[32:38] our young people and uh and so we we
[32:40] want to invest in that I believe it's a
[32:42] worthy cause so we appreciate as I said
[32:45] everybody's sacrifice and I also wanted
[32:47] just to say
[32:49] um you know we we want as many of our
[32:52] church as we possibly can get that would
[32:55] be willing whether it's musicians or
[32:57] deacons or security or families to come
[33:00] up and help but we totally understand
[33:03] that not everyone can do that so I
[33:06] wanted to make sure there was no no one
[33:08] felt there was any pressure you don't
[33:10] have to go no one's obligating you
[33:12] musicians
[33:14] um uh laity we have the best a musician
[33:18] group and we much prefer to have our
[33:20] brothers and sisters play and and our
[33:22] people we have the best deacons and the
[33:24] the best uh you know the the best
[33:26] families in the planet right here in
[33:28] Beaufort South Carolina and Bluffton and
[33:30] ladies Allen and the rest of the places
[33:31] y'all live ah
[33:34] going to disclude anybody but we
[33:36] understand if someone couldn't go it's
[33:38] there's no obligation fortunately the
[33:41] Lord is we've had a list of people from
[33:44] Camp musicians and security any any spot
[33:47] that we couldn't feel there's been a
[33:49] line of people wanting to fill that spot
[33:51] but we wanted to give our group our
[33:53] people first dibs first chance first
[33:56] opportunity at that so uh we just I just
[34:00] wanted to be crystal clear that there
[34:01] wasn't any there's no pressure we don't
[34:04] want any pressure from uh we we wouldn't
[34:06] want anybody to feel pressured by that
[34:08] but I may make a plea again and again
[34:10] and again if you're able to help and
[34:12] able to go we would greatly appreciate
[34:13] it we would rather uh fill up the staff
[34:16] that we need from our church that would
[34:18] be our desire uh and our church only but
[34:20] we know that's not always not always
[34:22] possible there's families that can't go
[34:24] they just have already let me know that
[34:27] one I know would be there they've been
[34:28] there years past and just can't make it
[34:31] as much as they want to and so I just
[34:33] wanted to say we we totally understand
[34:35] that completely
[34:36] so I got a text okay I cleared that up
[34:40] right already okay good sorry Deb didn't
[34:41] mean to look at you to give it away that
[34:43] you texted in church so it's not so the
[34:47] work crew also thank you the work crew
[34:49] doesn't pay that the worker has a less
[34:51] amount now the work crew uh that's the
[34:54] epitome of the word work because that's
[34:56] all they're coming to do they are
[34:57] staying in a bunk house they're not even
[34:59] staying they're staying in bunks or the
[35:01] brothers all stay in one and the sisters
[35:02] stay in another bunk house so they're
[35:04] charged a lesser amounts of amount
[35:06] that's a lot less but they're also
[35:08] coming to work the entire time they're
[35:10] going to be there what's been Carolina
[35:12] Point has asked for 10 hours a day so uh
[35:15] free a labor of love and so they're
[35:18] paying quite a substantial amount less
[35:20] if there's any questions if I've not
[35:22] been clear then please get with JD I'm
[35:25] sure he'll clear it up
[35:27] but uh I just wanted to say that and
[35:30] make sure that uh we were clear on that
[35:32] we still need 25 I believe more so work
[35:36] crew and I'm sure there'll be more
[35:38] announcements coming up for Youth Camp
[35:40] as we get closer let's all stand
[35:42] do you love the Lord Jesus

[37:55] pray that your Holy Spirit would move in
[37:57] our hearts father even as we give this
[38:00] missions report Lord I pray that people

[38:15] missions field surrounding us father
[38:17] guide and direct our footsteps guide and
[38:19] direct our thoughts here tonight use
[38:21] this for your glory we ask in Jesus name
[38:23] amen
[38:25] God bless you we're gonna start with a
[38:27] scripture in First Corinthians chapter
[38:28] 16. I'm going to be giving my missions
[38:32] report
[38:33] and if there's enough time speak in a
[38:35] few short words to preach
[38:39] so First Corinthians 16 9
[38:43] for a great door an effectual is open
[38:46] unto me and there are many adversaries
[38:48] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[38:50] reading of his word it can be seated
[38:52] thank you musicians
[38:57] so if you want to bring up that
[38:58] PowerPoint brother Mark
[39:11] so I went to uh two different countries
[39:15] in the end of May
[39:17] and into early June went to Turkey and
[39:20] also to Israel and I just want to start
[39:25] with a disclaimer
[39:27] um
[39:27] that I'm not Moses or Elijah
[39:33] and also I don't think that I'm being
[39:36] sent in the spirit and power of Moses or
[39:39] Elijah I don't believe that there'll be
[39:42] Gentiles I did check my DNA and I'm not
[39:46] Jewish at all so I don't think I'll ever
[39:50] qualify as Moses or Elijah to the Jews
[39:54] so it's a it's a funny thing but there's
[39:57] been many raised up that would go in in
[39:59] Pride and say I'm Moses or this one's
[40:03] Elijah and I just want to say that right
[40:05] away because a misunderstanding can come
[40:08] not necessarily from you but maybe for
[40:10] people that are listening to the
[40:11] testimony
[40:14] so first disclaimer
[40:19] I had a testimony that led to this trip
[40:24] prior to the trip anytime I go on a
[40:26] missions trip I really
[40:28] look to the Lord in his his leadership
[40:31] and I get something out of my heart and
[40:33] I start moving towards that and I see if
[40:36] the doors are opened or if the Lord is
[40:39] blocking or if things go through
[40:40] smoothly and then ultimately if I really
[40:44] feel at peace in my heart like this is
[40:46] this is what it's supposed to be and so
[40:48] I was kind of moving forward in early
[40:50] May thinking my goodness I better book
[40:52] my ticket it's I'm about to leave in a
[40:54] couple three weeks if I'm going to do it
[40:56] so
[40:58] um
[40:59] I was just really waiting on the Lord
[41:01] for that unction and that peace and that
[41:04] confirmation and honestly was feeling
[41:06] very discouraged
[41:09] um
[41:10] and a little bit down just wondering
[41:12] what am I doing what's my purpose what
[41:13] am I supposed to go forward in and
[41:17] um
[41:18] uh brother Nehemiah
[41:21] the the translator and Minister that I
[41:23] work with he lives in Canada and I've
[41:24] been working with since 2009 on
[41:28] translations for the Farsi language it
[41:30] gave me a call he said I have a
[41:32] testimony to share with you
[41:34] he said
[41:36] an Iranian man living in Paris
[41:38] who was
[41:40] was a Baha'i
[41:43] I'm not sure if you're familiar with
[41:45] Baha'i but it's sort of an amalgamation
[41:47] of different religions and they accept
[41:49] every religion's holy man as like the
[41:53] messenger of the their age kind of thing
[41:56] and so they they respect every religion
[41:58] but he
[41:59] he uh went to
[42:03] Jerusalem
[42:05] and put what he called a wish in the
[42:09] Western Wall they put a little paper
[42:11] saying I want to know
[42:14] God more personally
[42:17] and so he had
[42:19] a dream showing that showing him that
[42:22] Jesus was the way the truth and the life
[42:24] and so he became a Christian and he
[42:27] started fasting
[42:29] and he was doing a fast for each person
[42:32] of the Trinity so he was going to do one
[42:34] week to the father one week to the Son
[42:36] and one week to the Holy Ghost and so he
[42:39] started out this fasting process and the
[42:42] lord gave him a dream and said I'm not
[42:44] three persons I'm one
[42:48] and from there he started trying to find
[42:52] teaching about this online and he got in
[42:56] contact with with the pastor we mentored
[42:59] and worked with previously in Turkey but
[43:01] ended up that that Pastor ended up
[43:04] leaving us and kind of turning against
[43:06] us and going into some
[43:09] different doctrines but
[43:12] um that particular Pastor did introduce
[43:14] him to at least the basics of the
[43:16] message and he started following it but
[43:19] then at some point in time this pastor
[43:21] starts on his sermon starts boasting and
[43:24] saying I've got I'm the only one that
[43:26] has the truth you see this guy had a
[43:28] dream and he got led to me and it's a
[43:30] Vindication of my Ministry
[43:32] so anyways this this brother is like
[43:35] this doesn't
[43:36] this isn't sitting well with me I don't
[43:38] like this
[43:41] so he went to the Lord in prayer and
[43:43] asking for direction and he said
[43:45] he saw a man in his dream that was
[43:49] teaching on a screen that was a big guy
[43:51] with a beard
[43:53] and a voice said
[43:54] look for Demars and so he went on
[43:57] YouTube and found me started watching my
[43:59] videos and then from me he ended up
[44:01] finding brother Nehemiah getting in
[44:04] touch with him
[44:05] and that that particular brother he
[44:07] started a little Fellowship in Paris and
[44:10] so
[44:11] uh just started uh got in contact with
[44:14] him this afternoon actually
[44:17] um to to uh to speak with him and and
[44:20] will be interested to see what direction
[44:22] the Lord gives but it it really at that
[44:25] point in time it was just immediate okay
[44:27] now I know what I'm supposed to do keep
[44:29] go forward with the missions trip and be
[44:32] encouraged keep keep uh keep going
[44:35] forward to see how you can help
[44:37] Iranian people so
[44:40] um
[44:41] that's that's how the trip started they
[44:44] are flying from Atlanta to
[44:47] Amsterdam then Istanbul and then right
[44:51] away I think we I think I had uh what
[44:53] was I in in transit for about 20 26 27
[44:56] hours something like that so slightly
[44:58] exhausting
[45:00] um
[45:01] and got to kaiseri
[45:05] late in the evening and then
[45:08] um met up the next day with brother
[45:10] Nehemiah and uh brother Shaheen which
[45:13] I'll show you a picture of them in a
[45:15] second but I think a forgotten part of
[45:17] Missions many times we think of missions
[45:19] and we think the big services and
[45:21] meetings in the Philippines or India or
[45:25] um
[45:25] uh Africa and it looks fantastic on you
[45:29] know the screen and wow it's amazing but
[45:32] a lot of times there's there's missions
[45:34] that you have to do that's
[45:37] like in a coffee shop or at somebody's
[45:40] house or
[45:41] you know doing missions you got to go
[45:44] and make assessments on the ground or on
[45:46] site I could talk to these people all
[45:48] day long but until I'm face to face
[45:50] sitting down with them you know you
[45:51] can't really get an idea of what's
[45:53] Happening zoom and and Google meet and
[45:57] all that is great but it's just not
[45:59] going to do the same thing
[46:01] giving you know you got to be there face
[46:03] to face to really connect with them give
[46:05] correction give directions by the Holy
[46:07] Spirit
[46:08] you know don't think when you think
[46:10] missions don't always think brother
[46:12] branham's meetings in Africa but think
[46:15] maybe like David Livingstone who's an
[46:17] explorer
[46:18] on the ground seeking soil to break up
[46:21] and place into the ground brother
[46:23] Branham is going to Africa and having
[46:25] meetings like that because David
[46:26] Livingstone went and broke up the rocky
[46:30] horrible ground that you couldn't do
[46:33] anything in
[46:34] to bring to the results where someone
[46:36] can just plant the seed and boom it
[46:39] explodes
[46:40] and so that's kind of what we're doing
[46:42] that's basically what we're doing in the
[46:43] Middle East right now we're trying to
[46:44] the work has to be short
[46:46] so we're trusting the Lord is going to
[46:48] break it up quick and accomplish that
[46:50] purpose quick
[46:53] so
[46:55] brother Shaheen is there on the left
[46:57] we've been working here with him for
[46:59] since 2013.
[47:01] and brother Nehemiah I spoke about good
[47:05] friend and and translator there the
[47:08] message into Farsi
[47:12] I can't even read my own stuff so I'm
[47:15] going to turn around and look at it
[47:16] so yeah the church services are a part
[47:20] of it but they aren't all of it
[47:23] you know sometimes the time after
[47:24] service drinking tea or Turkish coffee
[47:27] and answering people's questions is
[47:29] maybe more memorable for them than even
[47:32] the service
[47:33] sometimes the holy spirit moves and and
[47:36] gets a hold of them and grips them after
[47:37] you've preached the word and broken
[47:39] things down their hearts open now
[47:42] they're asking their own questions and
[47:44] you're pointing them back to the word
[47:50] they're outside of the hotel with
[47:52] brother Nehemiah and brother Shaheen and
[47:54] kaiseri
[47:57] and there with the
[47:59] most of the little church in kaiseri
[48:02] there's a few people missing
[48:04] this
[48:06] this family I'm I'm every time I see him
[48:08] I'm so excited because I think I think
[48:11] it was seven years ago brother Omid and
[48:14] I were there in kaiseri on a on a trip
[48:16] and um got introduced to them and we LED
[48:20] them to Christ and baptized them so to
[48:23] see them walking with the Lord and
[48:25] growing in the message is such a
[48:27] great encouragement
[48:32] um
[48:33] the the Sunday School series that I'm
[48:36] preaching now seven women take hold of
[48:38] one man as I preached that in two
[48:40] sermons there and you know you imagine
[48:44] in the Middle East everybody has a
[48:47] different mindset but I was preaching it
[48:49] and I'm pretty sure they thought I was
[48:51] like the Taliban encouraging them to
[48:53] become the Taliban or something
[48:57] so you've reached something here and you
[48:58] get one response and you preach
[49:00] something in the Middle East and you get
[49:01] a completely
[49:03] around the similar response but
[49:05] completely different approach because
[49:07] where their background is coming from is
[49:09] is totally different
[49:14] so I I'm not sure how I'm going to get
[49:16] this to play but we're going to try
[49:18] uh can we get the sound out of that
[49:31] Caleb can you unmute the computer
[49:39] so this was from the hotel I was very
[49:43] glad to be 10 floors up
[49:46] um
[49:46] there was a warning to refugees not to
[49:49] go on the streets because they could not
[49:51] guarantee their safety
[49:54] because there was you know funny all
[49:57] around the world if you want to suddenly
[50:00] get nationalists support of your for
[50:04] your party you just become instantly
[50:07] anti-immigrant
[50:09] and so this is what one of the not aired
[50:12] one but the other person became and so
[50:14] there was a lot of attacks and and
[50:17] warnings and different things against
[50:19] refugees
[50:21] there and um it's pretty crazy because
[50:24] this this went on until
[50:28] probably 1 30 2 in the morning
[50:31] just I don't know how they hand how do
[50:33] you handle it you just sit in your car
[50:34] and hunt the horn for
[50:37] six hours
[50:38] I was in my room and
[50:42] it was driving me crazy let alone being
[50:44] down there I guess you're excited about
[50:46] politics
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:54] and it was this this is like the main
[50:56] artery of the of the city and I could
[50:59] look One Direction it was as far as the
[51:02] eye could see this way and
[51:05] far as the eye could see down the other
[51:07] way that they were all lined up
[51:09] getting out and and you could see some
[51:11] rioting stuff happening too so
[51:14] thankful for a good security uh hotel
[51:17] that we were staying in
[51:21] so then after that we went just for a
[51:23] brief
[51:23] time to Denis Lee to visit brother
[51:26] Shaheen's family
[51:28] and speak with them
[51:32] Anna had spent a lot of time when we
[51:37] were into nisley with brother Nehemiah
[51:38] praying and talking about future plans
[51:41] of missions and uh what direction to
[51:44] take as it's kind of a transition time
[51:46] there
[51:48] is a I didn't get too much food in this
[51:51] one I did at least had to get this
[51:53] because we were at brother Shaheen and
[51:56] sister Miriam's house this was the the
[51:58] last time that we were going to be there
[52:00] with them because their Refugee process
[52:02] was finishing and they were going to be
[52:04] going being directed to Canada so I was
[52:07] texting with nehemiah's saying why did
[52:10] we not take a picture with them in their
[52:12] house
[52:12] guess we were enjoying the food too much
[52:14] so
[52:18] so then I got on a plane got to Istanbul
[52:21] and then flew down to
[52:24] Tel Aviv it's my first time in Israel
[52:26] it's Ben gerion airport there
[52:30] in Tel Aviv
[52:32] and again disclaimer I am not Moses or
[52:34] Elijah
[52:37] Hey sir just tuning in now
[52:40] well what are you doing going to Israel
[52:42] we'll talk about it
[52:45] so this is the the zigzags you see there
[52:48] is the it's hard to tell but the the the
[52:52] first one on the far left that's uh Tel
[52:56] Aviv
[52:56] and then up the up to there that's
[53:00] called zikranyakov that's where I ended
[53:03] up staying
[53:05] um and then the farthest one to the top
[53:07] is Capernaum
[53:10] and then the one farthest at the bottom
[53:12] that's Jerusalem
[53:15] those are the different areas we went
[53:19] so there he is I'm just not going to say
[53:21] his name uh here as by his request
[53:27] not
[53:29] not all is as it would seem in Israel
[53:32] for Christians
[53:34] it's not easy to operate there and there
[53:38] is a real movement in their government
[53:41] to
[53:42] stop any Christian activity but they're
[53:46] walking on eggshells because they also
[53:47] know that a lot of their international
[53:49] support comes from Christians so it's
[53:52] sort of they try to keep that portion of
[53:54] it as quiet as possible
[53:59] oh
[54:00] we went in Jerusalem took me to see some
[54:03] different sites this is the this is the
[54:05] tomb of David
[54:07] and
[54:10] um let's see I'm thinking why don't you
[54:12] brother Mark will you pull up that
[54:15] um Upper Room video
[54:20] right outside of the tomb of David is
[54:23] where is the tomb of David is on Mount
[54:25] Zion
[54:26] So when you say Mount Zion in your brain
[54:29] God bless you everyone it's this huge
[54:32] thing way high it's a little it's a hill
[54:37] God bless you everyone matter
[54:52] God bless you everyone we are here in
[54:56] Jerusalem and what's this is astounding
[54:59] I had no idea but right up right up
[55:02] there is the upper room The Acts 2
[55:05] experience
[55:06] was inaugurated right here
[55:09] and that's what we're to continuous to
[55:11] be another book of Acts we're writing
[55:13] another book of Acts we should say God
[55:15] is writing another book of Acts through
[55:16] his bride in this hour and this is where
[55:19] it started right here Acts 2 experience
[55:21] but what's incredible is is right in
[55:24] front of me is King David's tomb so
[55:26] we'll play this is Mount Zion
[55:28] so on Mount Zion the place where the
[55:31] bride started Acts 2 is right there and
[55:34] right next to it is King David's tomb
[55:36] King's David's tomb is right here they
[55:38] have the upper room experience and he
[55:40] says King David is when Peter was
[55:43] speaking on in in Acts 2 said
[55:46] his Sepulcher is with us to this day but
[55:49] he was speaking of another to come the
[55:51] Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my
[55:54] right hand it's the Messiah Jesus Christ
[55:56] that was raised from the dead because
[55:57] David's tomb was right here
[56:00] it's incredible
[56:07] so it was a it was an amazing experience
[56:09] to see these different things and
[56:12] um
[56:16] yeah PowerPoint sorry
[56:22] listening to my own voice in front of
[56:24] everyone on a videos
[56:27] very difficult so pray for me
[56:32] so this is at the Western Wall
[56:35] so anywhere anytime you go into a
[56:38] one of the Jewish holy sites that you
[56:39] got to put on a yamaka
[56:42] there
[56:43] man this it's hot there it's like uh
[56:46] Tucson and with those stones and
[56:49] everything and and the sun beating down
[56:52] it was like I couldn't even couldn't
[56:53] hardly think
[56:55] that'd be in town there
[56:58] and
[57:00] this was this is uh Calvary
[57:04] Mount Calvary and so it's it's hard to
[57:07] tell in this View and it's hard to get
[57:09] to the the place but
[57:11] um
[57:12] just uh
[57:14] you can see those old cave openings
[57:16] that's why they say it was called
[57:19] Golgotha or the place of the skull if
[57:21] you could see the whole thing it would
[57:23] you would you would sort of see and you
[57:24] can look it up on the on Google and see
[57:27] there's a couple eyes and nose you can
[57:30] kind of see an outline of a head and he
[57:33] would have been
[57:34] then crucified on the road so there's a
[57:38] bunch of buses and everything there it's
[57:40] basically a bus stop now
[57:42] but the Damascus gate is right there and
[57:46] right and so it's right this is right
[57:48] outside the Damascus gate and right on
[57:51] basically this is the road to Damascus
[57:54] where the start of it
[57:56] and that's where he was crucified and
[57:59] then behind me is this the garden tomb
[58:03] so it's right and basically in the same
[58:05] facility if you go to the Garden tomb in
[58:08] Jerusalem
[58:10] um
[58:10] on one side they have a sitting area and
[58:14] a plate like a where they you can
[58:17] um
[58:17] like have a service and so forth there
[58:20] by where Golgotha is and then there's
[58:23] another place where you can go where the
[58:26] garden tube is which is right here
[58:30] a great experience around this is the
[58:33] Western Wall
[58:35] and the Dome of the Rock is where the
[58:37] Temple Mount is what what shocked me was
[58:39] how small that mosque is is I've been to
[58:42] Turkey and in Istanbul they have two
[58:45] different mosques I mean actually almost
[58:47] any city in Turkey has bigger mosques
[58:49] and than the Dome of the Rock I guess
[58:52] the difference is none of those have
[58:54] gold-plated uh covering on the top
[58:59] can't imagine the expense
[59:04] um
[59:08] I think this is another
[59:11] video that I'll need the sound on
[59:24] [Music]
[59:30] oh you guys aren't used to that sound
[59:33] that's the one I get to hear at four in
[59:36] the morning and all through the day
[59:38] whenever I go to the Middle East but
[59:40] that that is what they call the
[59:42] disciples
[59:43] steps going up into the temple see where
[59:47] that Dome is
[59:49] um that's the
[59:51] Al-Aqsa mosque which is also the
[59:54] location of where Solomon's Temple was
[59:56] so Solomon's Temple was right there
[59:58] right in our Solomon's not Solomon's
[1:00:01] Temple Solomon's Palace
[1:00:03] Solomon's Palace was there on the Temple
[1:00:05] Mount right next to the temple
[1:00:10] and behind so where I'm standing behind
[1:00:13] me is
[1:00:15] what they call the city of David they're
[1:00:17] Excavating it it's way further down on
[1:00:20] the level of this
[1:00:22] it's it's from when David built his
[1:00:25] Palace there that's where David's Palace
[1:00:27] was down behind me from right at this
[1:00:30] vantage point
[1:00:34] there it is at night
[1:00:37] and
[1:00:40] there I am with the brother although I
[1:00:42] said his name but hopefully you missed
[1:00:44] it
[1:00:45] um
[1:00:50] here we are at Capernaum
[1:00:52] and the Sea of Galilee went there
[1:00:55] this is just
[1:00:57] the countryside in Galilee is quite
[1:01:00] different than what I imagined it as
[1:01:02] it's very all of Israel that I was in
[1:01:05] was ex green and
[1:01:08] um very beautiful farmland and and pine
[1:01:12] trees and
[1:01:14] um
[1:01:15] very different than what I anticipated
[1:01:17] so here's the church there
[1:01:20] in Israel
[1:01:22] um
[1:01:23] kind of the some of the history of that
[1:01:25] there's
[1:01:26] there was a Russian Jewish Church
[1:01:30] a number of years back a Russian Jewish
[1:01:33] Church there
[1:01:34] and they've been gathering for a while
[1:01:37] and then there was a
[1:01:40] English-speaking Church there
[1:01:42] the pastor of the
[1:01:44] English-speaking Church ended up
[1:01:47] um
[1:01:47] some things happened and he ended up
[1:01:49] getting voted out and so they were
[1:01:52] without a pastor and the Russian church
[1:01:54] was also without a pastor so when the
[1:01:57] the brother moved there
[1:02:00] um
[1:02:01] he ended up
[1:02:02] being asked by each of these churches to
[1:02:04] minister to them so he would travel from
[1:02:06] one side of the city to the other side
[1:02:07] of the city on the day of their services
[1:02:10] to minister to each group and he was
[1:02:12] trying to get them together and then
[1:02:15] covet struck and they were locked down
[1:02:17] really hard in Israel
[1:02:19] and so then they had Zoom meetings and
[1:02:23] their Zoom meetings were all together so
[1:02:25] when they started Gathering again they
[1:02:27] had to find a place again they all
[1:02:29] decided to come together
[1:02:31] so right now the services are in English
[1:02:34] and Russian because they're all like I
[1:02:36] said they're all Russian Jews but it's
[1:02:39] soon it's going to move to Hebrew and
[1:02:41] um
[1:02:42] in Russian Hebrew and English sorry
[1:02:47] let's just uh kind of a small part of
[1:02:49] the group this was our first evening
[1:02:52] service that we had
[1:02:55] I think on yeah Friday night so every in
[1:02:58] in Israel the weekend is Friday
[1:03:02] afternoon
[1:03:03] and most of Saturday
[1:03:06] and so the the week starts again at in
[1:03:09] the evening of of Shabbat once Shabbat
[1:03:12] is over some people go back to work but
[1:03:15] otherwise Sunday is their first day of
[1:03:17] the first day of the week is they're
[1:03:19] basically their Monday
[1:03:21] so for church it'd be very difficult to
[1:03:23] gather on Sunday so most churches ended
[1:03:26] up end up having services on
[1:03:28] um on Shabbat
[1:03:31] um
[1:03:31] on the Saturday morning
[1:03:34] but it's crazy because everything
[1:03:36] everything is shut down there there's
[1:03:38] the only thing that's open is gas
[1:03:39] stations no restaurant nothing else like
[1:03:43] in the hotel
[1:03:44] you could go down and get get cold food
[1:03:47] but they didn't have any hot food and um
[1:03:50] you could make your own coffee from in
[1:03:54] from instant but you couldn't get an
[1:03:56] espresso because it's that would be
[1:03:58] breaking the Sabbath they can put the
[1:04:00] food out for you but they can't make any
[1:04:03] food for you so it's
[1:04:06] different rules and different things
[1:04:07] very interesting
[1:04:17] so
[1:04:19] um
[1:04:20] I've known him for some of you might
[1:04:22] know him but if you don't that's fine
[1:04:24] I'm happy to talk offline
[1:04:27] with anybody about him but he's he's a a
[1:04:30] been a good friend for probably
[1:04:34] 11 11 years now
[1:04:36] and he's from the states
[1:04:39] the Lord
[1:04:41] it's quite a supernatural testimony the
[1:04:44] Lord let him
[1:04:47] go to Israel
[1:04:50] probably about six years ago seven years
[1:04:52] ago
[1:04:53] and he
[1:04:56] he said Lord You're gonna have to pay
[1:04:58] for my trip to go because I I don't know
[1:05:00] how I'm gonna do it
[1:05:02] so he was he was listening to
[1:05:05] some Jewish worship music and this trip
[1:05:10] that you could apply for or or you know
[1:05:14] enroll in to win
[1:05:16] so he put his name in he bought the CD
[1:05:19] or whatever and
[1:05:21] he won the trip
[1:05:24] and so he went on that trip well his
[1:05:28] wife also applied
[1:05:31] and
[1:05:32] it was only supposed to be one person
[1:05:34] that won but they felt so bad for her
[1:05:35] that they gave her because of her
[1:05:38] situation she won it she was living
[1:05:41] there in Israel though so they gave her
[1:05:43] the ability to go on this trip she was a
[1:05:46] Messianic Jew
[1:05:48] grew up as a Orthodox Jew and so they
[1:05:52] ended up meeting on this trip and
[1:05:56] just to make a long story short he led
[1:05:58] her to the message
[1:05:59] and they got married
[1:06:03] and they're living there together in in
[1:06:05] Israel so
[1:06:07] pray for him he's he's uh it's a lonely
[1:06:10] walk
[1:06:11] for sure
[1:06:12] but the Lord is Lord is leading him
[1:06:14] there's as I mentioned in the or I read
[1:06:18] in that scripture there's open doors he
[1:06:20] had
[1:06:35] so
[1:06:37] I better not tell the story brother Matt
[1:06:41] there's a story here well
[1:06:45] I'll tell it
[1:06:47] this brother leads songs
[1:06:49] and plays the piano and translates the
[1:06:52] service so we had three services
[1:06:55] so he comes and before the first service
[1:06:58] and he says
[1:07:00] oh do you have any big words that you
[1:07:02] use
[1:07:04] um
[1:07:05] or fantastic words is what he said you
[1:07:07] have any fantastic words I said brother
[1:07:09] it's all fantastic words
[1:07:12] and he goes
[1:07:15] okay so then I'm preaching I open up my
[1:07:19] notes and he looks and sees how many
[1:07:20] quotes there are and he in front of the
[1:07:23] whole congregation who says oh no
[1:07:31] and so just imagine I'm trying to read
[1:07:33] brother branham's quotes but also
[1:07:34] simplify it for him
[1:07:37] so that he could so we're not taking six
[1:07:38] hours to preach a 45-minute sermon
[1:07:42] and so he is really nervous and stressed
[1:07:45] out about it and uh it was it was
[1:07:48] difficult the first night then the next
[1:07:49] service it was next next morning we had
[1:07:52] service again and it went very well he
[1:07:55] did a wonderful job
[1:07:57] then we then we had a meal in between
[1:07:59] service and uh we came back and I think
[1:08:02] he was just exhausted so
[1:08:04] service starts he's leading songs
[1:08:07] playing piano gets up to start
[1:08:10] translating and he makes it like 10
[1:08:11] minutes in
[1:08:13] and
[1:08:14] I was I was going between scriptures
[1:08:16] quotes and telling stories
[1:08:19] and I got to the story and I was saying
[1:08:22] he said and then the brother said and
[1:08:25] then he said and he just looks at me and
[1:08:27] goes
[1:08:29] do you mind if I go outside
[1:08:32] and I've had lots of things happen but
[1:08:35] not that
[1:08:37] yet on the missions trip so
[1:08:39] and
[1:08:40] I said
[1:08:42] um
[1:08:43] what's wrong
[1:08:45] I'm I'm not feeling good and I said
[1:08:49] sure
[1:08:52] so he just goes outside so I'm looking
[1:08:55] at him and I turn and look at the
[1:08:56] congregation 40 people all eyes on me
[1:09:00] let's sing a song
[1:09:02] hopefully some of you know it if not
[1:09:04] I'll just enjoy myself
[1:09:06] thankfully I chose one that they knew
[1:09:08] and both English and Russian so and we
[1:09:12] sang a few songs and then we prayed for
[1:09:14] prayed for the brother and found another
[1:09:17] translator
[1:09:19] that was a Russian speaker and he came
[1:09:22] and did okay you know wasn't normally a
[1:09:25] translator but uh everything's an
[1:09:28] adventure when you're on a missions trip
[1:09:30] like this
[1:09:31] you know you go to another country where
[1:09:33] the message has been established for a
[1:09:35] long time they probably have a line of
[1:09:37] translators waiting to translate but
[1:09:39] here it's it's uh you take what you can
[1:09:41] get and trust the Lord anoints the word
[1:09:44] to the people's hearts
[1:09:50] so there's a fellowship meal between the
[1:09:52] time
[1:09:56] it's definitely a multicultural Church
[1:09:58] Africans Filipinos
[1:10:00] Russians tajikistanis
[1:10:07] here is Mount Carmel
[1:10:11] and I think we have the video did I send
[1:10:14] you that video brother Mark
[1:10:18] but I'm standing on Mount Carmel on the
[1:10:20] left and the other one I'll we'll bring
[1:10:22] it up in a minute to replay that video
[1:10:25] foreign
[1:10:35] God bless you Saints we're here on Mount
[1:10:38] Carmel the place where Elijah confronted
[1:10:42] the prophets of Baal the 450 prophets of
[1:10:44] vale Baal and fire Came From Heaven uh
[1:10:48] and God vindicating his Prophet here in
[1:10:51] this spot as you're looking here you
[1:10:53] look out this way is the valley of
[1:10:57] megiddo
[1:10:58] what they call Jezreel now and beyond
[1:11:01] that you can see the mountains and those
[1:11:03] mountains are as Mount
[1:11:06] hormone or Mount Hermon as we know what
[1:11:10] the Bible is probably the more than
[1:11:12] likely the place where Jesus went up
[1:11:15] with Peter
[1:11:17] James and John for the amount of
[1:11:20] transfiguration so just an incredible
[1:11:22] spot to be I was preaching today about
[1:11:25] Elijah and the prophets of Baal and just
[1:11:28] thinking what a what a parallel to our
[1:11:31] day with the spirit of Elijah and God
[1:11:33] confronting the world with this message
[1:11:36] and here here's where God confronted
[1:11:38] Israel
[1:11:39] to see whether they would Worship the
[1:11:42] Lord and Obey him
[1:11:44] and here in our age
[1:11:47] the seventh Church age God sent a
[1:11:49] prophet to confront the whole world and
[1:11:51] let the whole world know receive my word
[1:11:54] or turn away from my word and he says
[1:11:57] I'll send you Elijah to the prophet
[1:11:59] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:12:01] Lord lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:12:04] with a curse so he sent the message to
[1:12:07] the whole world and it's a it's it's a
[1:12:09] message of Grace
[1:12:11] but when it's rejected it turns into a
[1:12:13] message of Mercy all through the Old
[1:12:15] Testament God sent prophets and those
[1:12:17] prophets were
[1:12:19] to be a reminder of God's love God's
[1:12:22] mercy and if if but if they didn't
[1:12:24] receive God's love and mercy by
[1:12:26] repenting and turning to him what was
[1:12:30] the what was the result it was judgment
[1:12:31] it was God confronted the ten tribes and
[1:12:36] later on continued to send prophets and
[1:12:39] they ended up being sent out of the land
[1:12:41] and sent all over the Earth and now
[1:12:45] we're now
[1:12:46] just to testify of restoration God's
[1:12:48] bringing those people that were
[1:12:50] scattered all over the Earth they're
[1:12:51] brought back to Israel now
[1:12:53] any time God's going to turn back and
[1:12:55] begin to deal with this country in the
[1:12:57] nation of Israel again through the two
[1:12:59] witnesses and sealing 144 000 with the
[1:13:03] Holy Ghost so God bless you what a
[1:13:05] incredible time it's been here in Israel
[1:13:06] so thankful for this opportunity and uh
[1:13:09] trust the Lord will make a way for me to
[1:13:11] be back here again
[1:13:16] back on the PowerPoint on that last
[1:13:19] picture on the top of
[1:13:21] Mount Carmel isn't it different than
[1:13:23] what you pictured it would be like it's
[1:13:26] it's a wooded with all kinds of
[1:13:29] different trees pine trees Etc and uh
[1:13:33] it's definitely Rocky but in my mind
[1:13:35] whenever I picture that scripture it's
[1:13:37] like the Dead Sea area you know where
[1:13:39] it's just very arid dry but no this is
[1:13:43] this is not that so the valley I'm
[1:13:46] looking down at is the valley of megiddo
[1:13:48] so all the way across that Valley is
[1:13:52] Jezreel Jezreel is where the Palace of
[1:13:56] Ahab and Jezebel was at
[1:13:59] so Elijah ran from there all the way
[1:14:02] across to that that Hill area
[1:14:08] um it's incredible to see that and
[1:14:10] obviously you know the the term
[1:14:12] Armageddon so this this Valley there
[1:14:16] that stretches from basically from the
[1:14:18] ocean all the way over into Galilee
[1:14:22] and that's the other part is Galilee was
[1:14:24] you know very rugged I I can tell you
[1:14:27] this Jesus was a really good hiker
[1:14:31] because that's some serious hiking you
[1:14:33] go through those Rocky rugged lands uh
[1:14:38] definitely a lot wetter a lot more water
[1:14:41] than I would have ever imagined in that
[1:14:44] particular area so I'm gonna take
[1:14:48] 15 minutes God willing to speak on
[1:14:51] something
[1:14:53] Proverbs 16 verse 18.
[1:14:59] we are in uh
[1:15:01] what the world calls
[1:15:03] pride month
[1:15:04] so I thought I'd speak a little bit
[1:15:06] about Pride
[1:15:08] and what the scripture speaks about
[1:15:10] Pride
[1:15:14] proverbs
[1:15:15] 16 Verse 18 Pride goes Before
[1:15:19] Destruction
[1:15:21] and a haughty spirit
[1:15:23] before a fall
[1:15:26] so whenever you see destruction
[1:15:29] what are you looking what are you going
[1:15:32] to understand that went before it
[1:15:35] so you you look in our day and age
[1:15:39] and you see God's Wrath you know Paul
[1:15:42] Paul looked at people and saw their
[1:15:46] behavior towards the gospel looked at
[1:15:48] the Jews saw saw their behavior towards
[1:15:51] the gospel and he said
[1:15:53] the wrath of God has come upon them to
[1:15:55] the uttermost
[1:15:57] so you think well what do you mean they
[1:15:59] were living their life just a normal
[1:16:01] life and everything was just as usual
[1:16:06] but Paul here boldly speaks God's Wrath
[1:16:09] has come upon them to the uttermost why
[1:16:11] because of their response to the gospel
[1:16:13] your response to the gospel Kicking It
[1:16:16] Away pushing it away you're already in
[1:16:19] destruction
[1:16:21] and even further than that is if you
[1:16:24] don't receive the Gospel you were born
[1:16:26] in destruction
[1:16:28] you were born in the condition where
[1:16:30] you're under God's curse
[1:16:32] I think the scripture says anyone that
[1:16:36] does not love the Lord Jesus Christ let
[1:16:39] him be anathema anathema means under
[1:16:41] God's curse so if you don't love the
[1:16:44] Lord Jesus Christ you're under a curse
[1:16:46] that's the fact of scripture and you're
[1:16:49] not going to love the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:50] until God does something with your heart
[1:16:54] until he draws you to himself opens your
[1:16:57] heart and fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:59] you'll you'll never have a true love for
[1:17:01] him that's not something we by Nature do
[1:17:04] I was just born with a nature to love
[1:17:06] God no you were not
[1:17:08] you were born with the nature to run
[1:17:10] from God to be proud to fight against
[1:17:12] God to fight against God's Authority in
[1:17:15] your life
[1:17:20] just ask the teenagers or the parents of
[1:17:22] teenagers if they think that their
[1:17:25] children are born with a nature to love
[1:17:27] God and respect God's Authority
[1:17:30] they're not
[1:17:31] they're born with a nature to rebel
[1:17:33] against Authority
[1:17:35] and so that's the that's why we need the
[1:17:37] new birth
[1:17:38] that's why we need God's mercy and so
[1:17:41] when you step over God's mercy and you
[1:17:44] rejoice
[1:17:45] in
[1:17:47] sin and Evil
[1:17:49] destruction
[1:17:50] you're living in destruction already
[1:17:54] whether you've seen the results of end
[1:17:56] results of that you're walking and
[1:17:58] living in destructions this country
[1:18:02] celebrating pride month Pride for what
[1:18:05] perverted Acts
[1:18:07] that's what they're proud of
[1:18:09] and every business is seeking to
[1:18:12] celebrate being proud of perverted Acts
[1:18:16] that's ultimately what this is about
[1:18:18] it's not about love
[1:18:20] They Don't Know What Love Is
[1:18:22] they have an idea of what love is but
[1:18:24] it's an absolute
[1:18:27] perversion
[1:18:28] and God hates it he said he hated it
[1:18:31] it's an abomination
[1:18:33] in his eye in his eyes and when you're
[1:18:35] walking in that Abomination you're
[1:18:38] walking under his curse
[1:18:41] and so
[1:18:44] you're just you're living over
[1:18:48] of that
[1:18:50] of God's Wrath that's when you're it
[1:18:53] when you're walking and living in that
[1:18:55] condition
[1:18:57] and so pride is is a is a thing
[1:19:01] that
[1:19:03] is literally
[1:19:04] the greatest evil
[1:19:06] it's the reason why there's sin in the
[1:19:08] world
[1:19:09] it's the reason why we suffer it's the
[1:19:12] reason why
[1:19:14] we're living in a world like we're
[1:19:16] living is because
[1:19:17] an angel
[1:19:19] was exalted in Pride
[1:19:21] against his maker
[1:19:24] C.S Lewis writes according to Christian
[1:19:26] teachers the essential Vice the utmost
[1:19:28] evil is pride
[1:19:30] unchastity anger greed drunkenness and
[1:19:33] all that are mere flea bites in
[1:19:35] comparison it was through Pride that the
[1:19:37] devil became the devil
[1:19:39] Pride leads to every other Vice it's the
[1:19:42] complete anti-god State of Mind
[1:19:45] it is pride which has been the chief
[1:19:47] cause of misery in every nation and
[1:19:50] every family since the world began
[1:19:55] this is God's viewpoint on Pride what is
[1:19:58] God's viewpoint on pride month
[1:20:06] James 4 6 says moreover he gives greater
[1:20:09] Grace for this reason he says God sets
[1:20:12] himself in battle array against the
[1:20:14] arrogant and haughty but gives grace to
[1:20:16] the humble and lowly
[1:20:19] what did that say God sets himself in
[1:20:23] battle array in the King James it says
[1:20:25] God resists the proud that resistance is
[1:20:28] not just merely that God's pushing
[1:20:30] against it it's it said he's saying he
[1:20:33] takes his sword he unsheaths it and he
[1:20:36] goes to war against it
[1:20:41] so he that arrogant and haughty Spirit
[1:20:45] God despises
[1:20:55] Pride
[1:20:57] Pride they're in the streets
[1:20:59] dressing like perverts doing perverted
[1:21:02] Acts
[1:21:05] and they think this is something to
[1:21:07] celebrate
[1:21:08] they will be destroyed
[1:21:10] the country this country is going to be
[1:21:13] destroyed the evidence of their
[1:21:16] destruction is the fact that they're
[1:21:18] rejoicing in those things
[1:21:21] I'm sorry about your YouTube account
[1:21:23] brother
[1:21:28] we have to preach the truth and what
[1:21:30] God's put God puts on our heart
[1:21:32] and to be arrogant and proud of your
[1:21:36] Acts
[1:21:37] it doesn't matter what act it is
[1:21:39] it could be a small thing or it could be
[1:21:42] a big thing
[1:21:43] but to be a proud and arrogant of your
[1:21:46] sin is
[1:21:48] shaking your fist against God
[1:21:53] too often though a person that struggles
[1:21:56] with pride doesn't see it in their own
[1:21:58] lives doesn't identify it but very
[1:22:02] frequently they're the most skilled at
[1:22:06] finding pride in others and pointing it
[1:22:09] out in others
[1:22:12] you know in a Christian atmosphere
[1:22:14] people aren't a hundred percent prideful
[1:22:18] because they've at least acknowledged
[1:22:20] there's a God there's a Creator there's
[1:22:23] someone I have to be obedient to there's
[1:22:25] someone I have to submit to and yet in
[1:22:29] when we walk in Pride we become blind to
[1:22:32] the fact that you know we're
[1:22:34] doing part of God's way but we're doing
[1:22:38] God's way our way
[1:22:40] that's usually the problem that happens
[1:22:41] you've humbled yourself to a certain
[1:22:44] point
[1:22:46] but then after that you're not willing
[1:22:49] to
[1:22:50] surrender yourself completely to God
[1:22:55] I think honestly there's probably
[1:22:57] rarely any more sins that are more
[1:23:00] concealed to us Than Pride
[1:23:06] you know
[1:23:07] all of us hate extreme levels of pride
[1:23:11] in others
[1:23:12] I say that with you know the hatred in
[1:23:16] the right sense we we don't like it we
[1:23:18] we recognize it and we say that's deadly
[1:23:22] that's dangerous but
[1:23:24] it's easy to recognize it in others but
[1:23:26] what about ourselves
[1:23:28] Pride
[1:23:30] is being selfish you know think let's
[1:23:32] let's think about one great example
[1:23:35] Peter in Matthew chapter 16 verse 23.
[1:23:40] Peter just finishes
[1:23:44] stating the great Revelation that Jesus
[1:23:46] is the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:23:47] that that's that's fantastic he
[1:23:50] surrendered to that revelation
[1:23:53] then the next minute Jesus is going to
[1:23:56] challenge him and about what does that
[1:23:58] mean that I'm the Messiah he says I'm
[1:24:00] going to be rejected and I'm going to go
[1:24:03] to the Cross I'm going to be killed I'm
[1:24:06] going to be rejected
[1:24:08] Peter says it'll never be that way
[1:24:12] Lord it'll never be that way oh my
[1:24:14] that's Pride
[1:24:16] you don't you don't say to the lord it's
[1:24:19] not going to be that way I'm not going
[1:24:21] to do that I've been guilty of saying
[1:24:24] that
[1:24:25] the missions trips that I go go on
[1:24:27] initially in my heart it was Lord I'm
[1:24:30] not going to Turkey that's too dangerous
[1:24:33] that's Pride
[1:24:36] does not surrender so here Peter on the
[1:24:39] one hand is surrendered on the other
[1:24:41] hand speaks his own mind speaks his own
[1:24:43] heart and what does Jesus say return to
[1:24:46] Peter and said get behind me Satan
[1:24:47] you're hindrance to me you're not set in
[1:24:50] your mind on the things of God but on
[1:24:51] the things of man
[1:24:54] pride is being
[1:24:56] selfish
[1:24:57] pride is accept thinking about yourself
[1:25:01] excessively about yourself
[1:25:04] Pride's Foundation is too much self-love
[1:25:10] Pride thinks the worth of ourself is
[1:25:13] higher than it actually is
[1:25:16] pride is preoccupied with our own image
[1:25:19] or our own self
[1:25:22] pride is really narcissism in other
[1:25:25] words we're Your Love you're in love
[1:25:26] with your own self-image
[1:25:30] pride is self-centered it's egocentric
[1:25:33] everything revolves around me
[1:25:35] and everybody that everybody everything
[1:25:37] that everybody talks about is about me
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:42] Pride wants to keep the focus on self
[1:25:48] that's what that's what pride is
[1:25:50] centered on me my thinking my thoughts
[1:25:54] my feelings my emotions
[1:25:57] those are real
[1:25:59] that's what that's what America has
[1:26:02] turned the truth into you listen to him
[1:26:04] well that's your truth no that's your
[1:26:06] emotions your own ideas your own
[1:26:09] feelings that's not truth truth is
[1:26:12] objective reality
[1:26:15] truth can be recognized by everyone if
[1:26:18] their eyes are opened
[1:26:20] truth is out there to grasp hold of
[1:26:23] there's no such thing as my truth and
[1:26:25] your truth that's emotions yeah but as a
[1:26:29] nurse that's the gospel of narcissism
[1:26:32] the gospel of self-centeredness
[1:26:36] just imagine we live in a world you
[1:26:38] where you say a woman is a biological
[1:26:41] adult female well that's your truth
[1:26:49] it's what
[1:26:51] it's objective reality
[1:26:54] but you say that and you'll if you're a
[1:26:56] college professor you don't have a job
[1:27:00] and what is it it's it's a
[1:27:02] it's a complete embracing of the maniac
[1:27:06] Pride
[1:27:09] the maniac of pride is the god
[1:27:12] of this world
[1:27:14] Satan is the God of this evil age he is
[1:27:17] an absolute Maniac named Pride
[1:27:21] truth matters nothing power
[1:27:24] Authority
[1:27:27] control is what matters to the devil
[1:27:30] and it's obvious he's got a lot of
[1:27:32] people under control his control
[1:27:36] Philippians 2 3 and 4 in the NLT says
[1:27:39] don't be selfish
[1:27:41] this is what we as Christians need to do
[1:27:43] don't be selfish don't try to impress
[1:27:45] others
[1:27:47] be humble thinking of others as better
[1:27:50] than yourselves don't look only out for
[1:27:52] your own interests but take an interest
[1:27:54] in others too
[1:27:57] we're in a look
[1:27:59] to the interests of others we're to seek
[1:28:02] the blessing of others pride is seeking
[1:28:05] our own self-interest
[1:28:08] humility
[1:28:10] is the opposite it's the emptying out of
[1:28:13] self
[1:28:14] I've said this before but you think of
[1:28:16] it like a thermometer when the
[1:28:17] thermometer is completely full that's
[1:28:19] Pride you're full of self
[1:28:21] when the thermometer is empty that's
[1:28:25] humility self is emptied out and
[1:28:27] surrendered it's not just emptied out
[1:28:30] we are not Buddhists
[1:28:32] but it's literally it's surrendered to
[1:28:35] the Almighty that we would be of service
[1:28:38] to him to be a help and a blessing for
[1:28:41] others
[1:28:43] if you're living to bless yourself
[1:28:46] you're not living for Christ
[1:28:48] you're living for pride
[1:28:52] pride is unteachable
[1:28:55] it gets irritated when someone tries to
[1:28:57] instruct it pride refuses to own a fault
[1:29:01] Pride refuses to listen to the advice of
[1:29:04] the ideas of others
[1:29:08] Pride manipulates situations using
[1:29:11] emotion
[1:29:13] Pride manipulates others using guilt you
[1:29:16] owe me or I'm this to you so therefore
[1:29:18] you should do this to me
[1:29:21] Pride uses self-image as a reason why
[1:29:25] their children should obey them or look
[1:29:28] the part
[1:29:31] hates being told what to do
[1:29:34] Pride wants its own autonomy to decide
[1:29:36] when they will and when they won't
[1:29:39] submit to the word
[1:29:43] pride is a person he has to be
[1:29:45] recognized for what you're done what
[1:29:46] he's done or else he feels hurt and
[1:29:48] angered when he doesn't get the credit
[1:29:50] for what what he's done
[1:29:54] Pride hates sharing the spotlight
[1:29:59] Pride takes credit
[1:30:01] for things they didn't do or didn't even
[1:30:03] think of
[1:30:07] Pride brags about their own Ministry in
[1:30:11] a very humble sounding way
[1:30:16] Pride claims I'm the best at a certain
[1:30:19] this thing and they'll take their time
[1:30:21] to explain every detail why they are the
[1:30:25] best I'm I'm not listing off the EV the
[1:30:28] attributes of Donald Trump's I'm not
[1:30:30] stop thinking that
[1:30:36] Pride
[1:30:38] is a person that feels certain tax tasks
[1:30:40] would be beneath them and they would
[1:30:43] lower them in other people's sight
[1:30:49] Pride likes to drop names about people
[1:30:52] in your circle so that some of their
[1:30:54] notoriety will rub off on you
[1:30:59] pride is not interested in getting to
[1:31:01] know and connecting with others it's
[1:31:03] aloof uninterested
[1:31:06] Pride constantly thinks of itself
[1:31:09] and what others think about you
[1:31:15] also people who are extremely sensitive
[1:31:19] have another form of Pride sure they're
[1:31:21] easily hurt because they think
[1:31:23] everything's about them
[1:31:25] and how they should be involved how they
[1:31:27] should be leading how they should be
[1:31:29] participating
[1:31:30] Etc these are things that
[1:31:32] uh on every on some levels
[1:31:36] some of them cut all of us cut me
[1:31:41] Jonathan Edwards writes the first and
[1:31:43] worst cause of errors that abound in our
[1:31:45] day and age is spiritual Pride
[1:31:48] this is the main door by which the Devil
[1:31:50] comes into the hearts of those who are
[1:31:52] zealous for the advancement of Christ
[1:31:54] it is the chief Inlet of smoke from the
[1:31:57] bottomless pit to darken the mind and
[1:31:59] mislead the judgment
[1:32:01] pride is the main Handle by which he has
[1:32:03] hold of Christian persons and the chief
[1:32:05] source of all the Mischief that he
[1:32:07] introduces to clog and hinder a work of
[1:32:10] God
[1:32:11] spiritual pride is the mainspring or at
[1:32:13] least the main support of all other
[1:32:14] errors until this disease is cured
[1:32:17] medicines are applied in vain to heal
[1:32:20] all other diseases
[1:32:22] so true how quickly Zeal goes from
[1:32:26] from being
[1:32:28] enthusiastic about the things of God to
[1:32:31] being hey you're not doing this and
[1:32:33] you're not doing that and why aren't you
[1:32:34] doing this and hey you said that to that
[1:32:37] one and why did you looked at me like
[1:32:39] that
[1:32:40] you know that's the that's the approach
[1:32:42] is no how about yourself
[1:32:46] you know the Revival should start in me
[1:32:49] the change in transformations to start
[1:32:51] in me
[1:32:53] and so if I'm zealous then that should
[1:32:55] rub off on other people I shouldn't have
[1:32:56] to throw rocks at everybody's head to
[1:32:59] get them zealous because that's you
[1:33:01] don't
[1:33:02] you know you don't trap
[1:33:04] uh a bear
[1:33:07] by making all kinds of noise and trying
[1:33:09] to get rid of them you throw out a bunch
[1:33:11] of cakes and stuff to to try to draw
[1:33:14] them in and you know you want to make
[1:33:17] somebody else zealous for the gospel you
[1:33:19] should do it in a in a in a way that is
[1:33:22] enthusiastic that spreads not that a way
[1:33:25] that condemns and tears people down
[1:33:29] Isaiah 57 15.
[1:33:32] for thus saith the high and lofty one
[1:33:34] that inhabits
[1:33:36] eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in
[1:33:39] the high and holy place I love this
[1:33:45] painting such a picture this is Isaiah
[1:33:47] 57 15.
[1:33:49] painting such a picture of the greatness
[1:33:52] and the majesty and the glory of God
[1:33:55] and it's all to set up the last part of
[1:33:58] the verse which says with him also that
[1:34:00] is of a contrite and humble spirit
[1:34:04] to revive the spirit of the humble
[1:34:07] and to revive the heart of the contrite
[1:34:10] ones
[1:34:11] amen isn't that beautiful
[1:34:13] the greatness of God is his
[1:34:16] condescending to those who are humble
[1:34:19] but remember this is God's attitude
[1:34:21] towards the humble right he condescends
[1:34:24] he comes down to revive them to build
[1:34:27] them up to strengthen them but to the
[1:34:29] proud he takes out his sword
[1:34:32] and he girds himself to go to war
[1:34:35] against the against the proud so just
[1:34:38] which one do you want to be
[1:34:41] do you want to be proud and have God as
[1:34:43] your enemy or do you want to humble
[1:34:45] yourself empty yourself out surrender
[1:34:48] yourself to the Lord
[1:34:49] be as low as you could be to let him
[1:34:52] flow down to where you are
[1:34:55] God is God is like a river it flows to
[1:35:00] the lowest parts right that's where
[1:35:02] God's going to flow to the lowest parts
[1:35:04] to the most humble
[1:35:11] musicians if you come
[1:35:17] William law writes there can be no sure
[1:35:20] proof of a confirmed Pride than a belief
[1:35:22] that one is sufficiently humble
[1:35:26] also if you want to find out how proud
[1:35:28] you are the easiest way is to ask
[1:35:29] yourself how much do I dislike it when
[1:35:31] other people snub me or refuse to take
[1:35:33] any notice of me
[1:35:35] or shove their ore in or patronize me or
[1:35:39] show off
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] let's ask the Lord to to search our
[1:35:45] hearts
[1:35:48] let's ask him let's stand
[1:35:51] let's ask him to reveal to us if there's
[1:35:53] any Pride
[1:35:55] within us
[1:35:56] and for him to cleanse us from that and
[1:35:59] Lord Lord we come to you and Lord we
[1:36:02] just want to get
[1:36:04] lower and we want to be
[1:36:06] more humble Lord
[1:36:09] we want to see more of your
[1:36:11] Holy Spirit
[1:36:14] Lord we we often pray and we ask Lord to
[1:36:17] send Revival fires into our hearts Lord
[1:36:21] well we learn tonight what what an
[1:36:24] incredible key
[1:36:26] to that Revival is is we we need to have
[1:36:29] a humble and contrite spirit
[1:36:35] Lord that's where you go that you the
[1:36:37] high
[1:36:38] the lofty one who inhabits eternity
[1:36:41] comes down lord and even in Isaiah 66
[1:36:44] you say you dwell in the one who is has
[1:36:48] a humble and contrite heart and who
[1:36:51] trembles
[1:36:52] at your word Lord
[1:36:54] may we have such a spirit of reverence
[1:36:56] we know this age
[1:36:58] battles against any kind of reverence
[1:37:02] and fear for you Lord
[1:37:05] but I pray that you'd give us that that
[1:37:06] true reverence and that true fear of the
[1:37:10] Lord which would tremble at your word
[1:37:12] Lord
[1:37:13] because we want to have you dwelling
[1:37:15] inside of us not Pride
[1:37:17] but we want to be emptied out
[1:37:19] of ourselves Lord that your Holy Spirit
[1:37:21] would flow through US Lord
[1:37:24] move in our hearts Lord May that just
[1:37:27] this not just be a word spoken Lord but
[1:37:29] it may be a reality to us Lord
[1:37:34] search our hearts
[1:37:37] move within us Lord we ask it
[1:37:40] in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:45:18] I think so but I don't know
[1:45:22] foreign
[1:45:28] for a couple week vacation for our for
[1:45:31] our anniversary and uh somebody asked me
[1:45:34] what my favorite part of Ireland was and
[1:45:37] um I thought about it and uh
[1:45:40] this testimony goes back to right before
[1:45:43] I came down here I was working on my
[1:45:45] truck in Idaho and I don't know what I
[1:45:48] did but I blew my knee my right knee out
[1:45:50] and
[1:45:51] for for a while I thought it was like
[1:45:53] bursitis but it like lingered and it's
[1:45:56] been this way for over a year and a half
[1:45:58] now that I've I've been down here and
[1:46:00] it's like there's this ball right where
[1:46:02] your quadrice where my quadricep
[1:46:05] attaches and it's like the muscles
[1:46:07] balled up it's it's hard when I flex it
[1:46:10] I and I don't know
[1:46:12] I guess I could have gone to the doctor
[1:46:14] but I hate I hate even the thought of
[1:46:16] that and I just asked the Lord
[1:46:19] to I mean a year and a half ago I asked
[1:46:21] him just to to help me and heal me but
[1:46:24] um so I've been putting it off and and a
[1:46:27] and I don't really notice it unless I
[1:46:29] like walk even up the steps here it's
[1:46:31] like ooh and I have to like throw my
[1:46:33] weight off of this leg this foot and
[1:46:36] kind of Step Up well um Ireland has a
[1:46:39] lot of steps like in those castles and
[1:46:41] stuff and it was starting to really
[1:46:44] um bother me
[1:46:46] and uh I told Emily I said when we get
[1:46:48] back make me an appointment and I'll go
[1:46:50] to the doctor you know finally after a
[1:46:53] year and a half I'm I'm I've had enough
[1:46:55] and uh
[1:46:57] but my favorite part of Ireland there's
[1:47:00] this waterfall just off the off the road
[1:47:03] and there's a pathway that goes down to
[1:47:05] that waterfall and on that pathway
[1:47:07] there's some rocks you kind of have to
[1:47:09] step up and over you know to get to this
[1:47:11] uh really pretty waterfall well I I
[1:47:15] stepped up on one of those rocks and I
[1:47:17] stepped off of it and my right foot was
[1:47:19] still on the Rock and I stepped down and
[1:47:21] I don't know it hit my leg just right
[1:47:24] and something in that knee popped and it
[1:47:26] felt like if you uh took like a
[1:47:29] tourniquet and put right above the
[1:47:31] kneecap and just cinched it down like
[1:47:32] with a stick in there just tightened it
[1:47:34] as tight as you could get it and she was
[1:47:36] off somewhere else I was by myself but I
[1:47:38] let out a good yell oh and uh I thought
[1:47:43] man I really did it now but like a
[1:47:46] little later that day or even the next
[1:47:48] day I think it might have been I
[1:47:50] realized this feels different and uh and
[1:47:54] now that that ball that was always there
[1:47:57] it's getting smaller there's still a
[1:48:00] little bit of discomfort in there but it
[1:48:02] is totally different than it ever was
[1:48:04] and uh I'm just trusting the Lord to
[1:48:07] heal the rest of the way yeah you know
[1:48:09] all the symptoms praise the Lord that's
[1:48:11] awesome
[1:48:12] thank you
[1:48:17] I just wanted to give the Lord a
[1:48:19] praise for answering prayer still an
[1:48:23] ongoing situation so I'm not going to
[1:48:25] really get into a lot of the detail
[1:48:26] about it but we've been a lot of prayer
[1:48:29] for our children
[1:48:30] different ones and some of the
[1:48:33] situations they've been in and and um

[1:48:39] the faith of a mustard seed if you say
[1:48:42] it in this mountain

[1:48:46] see the whole Mountain Moving one time
[1:48:47] but you know maybe one stone one one
[1:48:51] rock here one rock there so I'm claiming
[1:48:54] that I'm seeing it and I just thank the
[1:48:56] Lord for what he's doing already God
[1:48:58] knows all about it so I'm giving him
