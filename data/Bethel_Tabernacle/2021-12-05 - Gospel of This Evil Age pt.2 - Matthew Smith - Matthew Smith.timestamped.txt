[3:55] [Music]
[5:55] so
[6:01] [Music]
[6:24] all right
[6:27] good morning everybody uh
[6:29] let's all uh
[6:30] stand and read our scripture here
[6:38] see
[6:46] all right let's um let's turn to um
[6:50] ecclesiastes 1 9.
[6:58] everybody got it
[7:00] i'll give you
[7:08] all right
[7:11] so um
[7:14] let's let's read here starting at verse
[7:16] nine um the thing that has been
[7:18] it is that which shall be and that which
[7:20] is done is that which shall be and there
[7:23] is no new thing under the sun
[7:26] is there anything whereof it may be said
[7:28] see it is new
[7:30] it has been already of old time which is
[7:33] before us
[7:34] there is no remembrance of former things
[7:36] neither shall there be any remembrance
[7:38] of things that are to come
[7:40] with those
[7:42] that shall come after
[7:45] bow our hearts dear lord ask that you
[7:47] bless this scripture that we've read and
[7:48] blessed the hearts of the people as you
[7:50] be with us the sunday school and anoint
[7:52] my my lips that i would speak the things
[7:54] that the people need to hear i said not
[7:56] just be some information but they would
[7:58] be able to see
[8:00] what you need them to see in this father
[8:01] that you would nourish them spiritually
[8:03] has these things in jesus name amen
[8:05] y'all can be seated
[8:06] um
[8:08] i want to re read that from the new
[8:10] living translation um just because i
[8:12] think it's
[8:13] it phrases a little bit better um not
[8:15] necessarily better but in a more plain
[8:17] english that
[8:19] i liked a little bit more a little spoke
[8:20] a little more to me um
[8:22] it says history merely repeats itself
[8:25] it has all been done before nothing
[8:27] under the sun is truly new
[8:30] sometimes people say here's something
[8:32] new but actually it is old
[8:34] nothing is ever truly new
[8:37] oh we got the nlt on ah cool um
[8:41] we don't remember what happened in the
[8:42] past and in future generations no one
[8:45] will remember what we are doing now
[8:48] and
[8:49] i think that's really the whole theme of
[8:52] any of the sunday schools that from last
[8:54] week and and moving on into this week
[8:56] that really everything that we're seeing
[8:58] now in the in the world in politics in
[9:00] the
[9:01] developments in the religious world
[9:03] they've all been done before
[9:04] it's none of it's new
[9:06] and
[9:07] these things
[9:10] like i said last week it is just a
[9:12] it is the same spirit with a different
[9:14] coat of paint on it
[9:16] coming back around and
[9:19] we can see these things in the past
[9:21] um now with this this week what i want
[9:24] to do is um
[9:26] i understand there was some terminology
[9:27] that i used from last week
[9:29] um things like the word woke people a
[9:30] lot of people were like well scratching
[9:32] their head what in the world does that
[9:33] mean
[9:35] and i want to take some time to go into
[9:38] that and kind of explain the history of
[9:39] where this stuff came from um
[9:43] i remember
[9:44] i mentioned that um
[9:46] the
[9:47] the gospel coalition was putting out uh
[9:49] training on how to see the the scripture
[9:51] through foucault and dereda a lot of
[9:53] people have no idea what i what that
[9:55] what that is but event uh not this week
[9:57] but hopefully next time i'll be able to
[9:59] explain what that is and you can really
[10:00] understand just how
[10:03] dangerous that is to be accepting into
[10:05] the church
[10:06] and how that
[10:08] if you do that
[10:09] i mean it is literally completely
[10:13] i i used the term anti-christ before but
[10:16] really it's anti-scripture that it
[10:18] actually
[10:20] to believe the bible as an authority
[10:22] from god just falls apart if that's the
[10:24] road you want to go down
[10:26] um
[10:29] uh
[10:30] i also don't want to shy away from using
[10:32] some of the academic terminology i know
[10:33] people get scared with big words and i
[10:35] could break a lot of that down into
[10:36] really simple terminology and use simple
[10:38] terms but the problem is we live in a
[10:40] world where
[10:41] people have some really sinister
[10:42] intentions and they use that kind of
[10:44] terminology and if you don't know what
[10:45] it means they'll be speaking a different
[10:46] language and plotting your demise and
[10:48] you will have no idea what they're
[10:50] talking about and you won't see it
[10:51] coming
[10:52] a lot of times there's some really nasty
[10:54] things that they have put into the
[10:55] education system and nobody knew what
[10:57] they were talking about because they
[10:59] didn't take the time to learn the
[11:00] terminology and people like well i don't
[11:01] know what that means so i'm not going to
[11:03] think about it too much
[11:04] and then
[11:05] they end up
[11:07] allowing some really nasty things being
[11:09] taught in schools especially to kids
[11:12] i also think brother jason characterized
[11:15] it correctly when he said that this is
[11:17] really modern events made clear by
[11:18] prophecy um brother branham talked about
[11:21] a lot of this stuff that the way it
[11:22] would come down and what would happen
[11:24] and
[11:25] here it is um you and really you have to
[11:28] understand the history of where this
[11:29] stuff came from and that's why i'm going
[11:31] to go back and talk about that
[11:35] so i want to go back to um
[11:38] and and start with
[11:40] um
[11:42] what i'm calling well it's marxism karl
[11:45] marx back in wrote a book in
[11:47] 1848 called the communist manifesto
[11:50] now
[11:51] 1848 is
[11:54] like 20 years before the civil war
[11:57] right this is
[11:58] this is a long time ago
[12:00] back when nobody would have thought that
[12:03] our current politics
[12:05] would have applied at all like the
[12:06] things that we're seeing
[12:08] today what it's almost like they're such
[12:10] a different people back then
[12:12] how would they be struggling with things
[12:14] like
[12:15] you know the dissolving of christian
[12:17] society you know christian morality as a
[12:19] as a part of politics and yet it's there
[12:21] it's all there i mean marx was talking
[12:23] about this all the way back then
[12:25] and i want to talk about sort of the
[12:27] planks of marxism because
[12:29] marxism communism socialism they're all
[12:31] technically different things but you can
[12:33] pretty much interchange them for our
[12:35] purposes and so last week when i read
[12:37] from the the
[12:39] uh theology of a social gospel they're
[12:41] talking about how they're emerging the
[12:43] gospel with socialism it's another way
[12:45] of saying emerging with marxism so you
[12:47] kind of want to know what marx taught so
[12:49] you know what the exactly what they were
[12:50] trying to put together
[12:52] and why it's so insidious and why we can
[12:54] see that coming back in the church today
[12:57] and i know it might kind of come off as
[12:59] a little bit dry and a little bit boring
[13:00] nobody wants to go back to history class
[13:01] but we're going to talk about a little
[13:03] bit um
[13:04] i
[13:05] ran a lot of this stuff by katie my
[13:07] wife she gets to hear all of this stuff
[13:09] ahead of time and get all the trial runs
[13:12] and um
[13:14] you can i guess she told me she's like
[13:16] you know the more you go into this the
[13:17] more you realize
[13:19] it seems kind of dry on the surface but
[13:21] once you get into it it
[13:23] you can really see how it applies today
[13:26] so please stay with me and try to
[13:28] pardon me if i can make it a little bit
[13:30] boring um
[13:32] so
[13:32] the uh
[13:35] a lot of people think that marxism or
[13:36] communism is about money it's not
[13:39] um
[13:40] on the surface it is but ultimately what
[13:42] marxism was about was the
[13:45] destruction of any sort of leadership
[13:47] structure or hierarchy of authority
[13:49] that's what it was about if you go read
[13:51] the communist manifesto he talks about
[13:52] this how really society is built into
[13:55] these hierarchies and we need to knock
[13:56] it all down but the way to knock it down
[13:58] is through money because he believed
[13:59] that the moving of money through the
[14:01] economy is how everyone patterned
[14:03] everything in their lives so if you
[14:05] knock down the monetary system knock
[14:07] down the economy everything else follow
[14:09] suit
[14:10] um
[14:12] really what he was against was headship
[14:14] and we'll get into that a little bit
[14:15] later when i'm going to read some of the
[14:16] quotes from there so you can really see
[14:18] what he's talking about um
[14:20] but really it's based it's based on
[14:22] resentment it's based on being
[14:24] being
[14:25] bitter that your life isn't as awesome
[14:27] as it somebody else's and so you want to
[14:29] burn the whole world down so that you
[14:31] can build your own kingdom out of the
[14:32] ashes that's what it's about
[14:35] and um
[14:36] [Music]
[14:37] uh the other couple core things is you
[14:40] need to know that mark's taught that
[14:42] the whole world um
[14:45] uh hang on let me share
[14:48] there's all these uh like i said the
[14:49] sort of the products of the economy and
[14:52] capitalism uh and he believed things
[14:54] like the family religion
[14:56] um politics all of it and he mentioned
[14:58] specifically family and religion these
[15:00] are products of the economy and so if
[15:02] you flatten the economy you're going to
[15:04] flatten the family and religion and
[15:06] everything else
[15:08] and it also puts
[15:11] this divides society into into social
[15:13] classes rich and poor he used the terms
[15:16] bourgeoisie and proletariat i'm going to
[15:17] mention those to you because it'll come
[15:19] back later
[15:20] um because anytime you hear people using
[15:22] that kind of terminology you know that
[15:23] they're talking they're directly
[15:25] referencing marx nobody but him kind of
[15:27] came up with that
[15:28] he's sort of the originator of that
[15:31] so when you hear people using that kind
[15:32] of terminology you know what they're
[15:33] actually talking about they're not
[15:34] talking about anything other than marx
[15:38] but based everything on a pressure of
[15:39] press classes a pressure class and a
[15:41] press class that there's this pressure
[15:43] class that's got everybody down and all
[15:44] societies built by the oppressors and us
[15:47] poor working-class people who are just
[15:48] you know trying to make our way through
[15:50] the through our lives or we gotta come
[15:53] together in sort of this class
[15:54] consciousness we've got to be aware of
[15:55] our class we're not an individual we're
[15:57] part of this greater collective of
[15:58] workers and we're going to overthrow the
[16:00] rulers and make our class the ruling
[16:03] class and all of society is is
[16:05] constructed to keep us down so i want to
[16:08] read a couple couple things here
[16:11] um
[16:12] i can skip over that
[16:15] um
[16:15] [Music]
[16:16] so when i mention things like the the
[16:18] product of the family um
[16:21] marx uh
[16:23] was a directly believed that the the
[16:26] what we would call the nuclear family
[16:27] needed to be destroyed
[16:29] that the you know the man
[16:31] the wife the kids sort of in a structure
[16:34] where the man is the head that needs to
[16:36] be flattened
[16:37] because like i said it's all about
[16:38] powers of hierarchy it's not about the
[16:40] economy he just thought that if you blew
[16:42] the economy up
[16:43] that's the social glue that holds all
[16:44] this together and the family would fall
[16:46] apart because he actually hated family
[16:47] and religion
[16:50] so
[16:51] um
[16:52] [Music]
[16:55] let's see here
[16:59] and he says but you say we destroy the
[17:01] most hallowed of relations when we
[17:03] replace home education by social
[17:07] and your education is not that also
[17:09] social and determined by the social
[17:10] conditions under which you educate
[17:12] by the invent intervention directed
[17:15] direct or indirect of society by means
[17:17] of schools etc
[17:18] the communists have not invented the
[17:21] intervention of society and education
[17:23] they do but seek to alter the character
[17:25] of that intervention and to rescue
[17:27] education from the influence of the
[17:29] ruling class so they believe that you
[17:31] they have to take over education to
[17:33] teach your kids
[17:34] how to be communists
[17:37] because that's
[17:38] literally what they believed
[17:42] and he goes on to talk about how
[17:45] uh that the communists wanted to create
[17:46] uh what they call a community of women
[17:48] that there would basically be no
[17:49] marriage and it's all free love right
[17:51] the women just sort of do whatever and
[17:53] they don't have to worry about taking
[17:54] care of the kids because the state's
[17:55] gonna take care of the kids
[17:56] um
[17:57] and
[17:58] the um so you can complete you can see
[18:01] how it completely destroys the family
[18:03] and
[18:04] it's completely against any sort of
[18:06] christian morality
[18:09] um
[18:10] now like i said this book was written in
[18:11] 1848
[18:13] at first it was kind of
[18:15] cast by the wayside but over the course
[18:17] of 70 or so years people started taking
[18:19] it seriously and by 1917 you had the
[18:21] soviet revolution in russia
[18:24] where you had a bunch of communists
[18:26] take it seriously and
[18:28] put into practice
[18:31] you had a lot of other people throughout
[18:33] europe also kind of try to put into
[18:34] practice
[18:35] and um
[18:36] [Music]
[18:38] you got this something called what they
[18:40] call neo-marxism neo means new so it's a
[18:44] new version of marxism
[18:46] um
[18:46] and they talked about how marx was wrong
[18:48] because he was right in wanting to tear
[18:50] down all of society and burn it all down
[18:52] and destroy christian values
[18:54] because
[18:56] how else are we going to get to utopia
[18:58] except by destroying christianity as
[19:00] they put it um
[19:02] but
[19:03] they wanted to do it through social
[19:04] media because they believed that he was
[19:05] wrong and thinking it was about
[19:06] economics because they said well if
[19:09] he was writing about economics then
[19:11] according to marx everything all the
[19:12] stuff should have happened in the uk
[19:14] america france these are very rich
[19:15] countries but it happened in really poor
[19:17] economically broke russia
[19:20] and it didn't make any sense to them so
[19:21] they said well it's got to be the
[19:23] culture we have to annihilate the
[19:25] culture that means anything that holds
[19:28] the culture together has to be destroyed
[19:30] specifically
[19:32] christian values
[19:34] um
[19:35] and so you had two people specifically
[19:38] who really founded this one was guy
[19:40] named antonio gramsci and the other one
[19:43] was a guy by the name of george lucox
[19:45] graham she
[19:48] came with this thing called cultural
[19:49] hegemony
[19:51] and he said that he uh is the idea that
[19:53] the dominant culture was constructed to
[19:55] cause its subjects to conform to itself
[19:58] in order to keep them all in line with
[19:59] the will of the ruling class
[20:02] and he also believed that there were
[20:03] five pillars to culture that should all
[20:05] be broken down to collapse the cultural
[20:07] hegemony namely these were religion
[20:09] family education media and law
[20:11] and he believed that it was the job of
[20:13] the communist party in every country to
[20:15] infiltrate all those institutions
[20:17] and over time
[20:19] inject communist propaganda into them
[20:21] until they completely dissolve you can
[20:23] break them all down and then you can get
[20:24] your revolution because society has
[20:26] collapsed because as long as there's a
[20:27] social glue holding everyone together
[20:29] no one's going to be bitter at each
[20:31] other and you can't use that bitterness
[20:32] to form a revolution
[20:34] right if everyone's happy and getting
[20:35] along you get no revolution
[20:38] right
[20:39] so
[20:41] um
[20:45] the um
[20:46] he also
[20:47] talked about things like that you know
[20:49] working-class people can only be
[20:50] properly educated by
[20:53] um
[20:54] uh other um
[20:56] working-class people that you can't have
[20:58] uh sort of wealthy intellectuals
[21:01] teaching them because they'll just teach
[21:02] them in ways that prop up the
[21:03] intellectual's own culture
[21:05] um and this is actually uh
[21:07] a uh
[21:09] sort of the precursor to something that
[21:10] later became known as critical pedagogy
[21:12] we'll talk about that later but just so
[21:14] you're all aware um but the other guy
[21:16] who's a lot more important this guy by
[21:18] the name of george lucas he was a
[21:20] hungarian who in 1917 was the um
[21:26] the
[21:27] government of hungary became communist
[21:29] for about four months until the people
[21:30] of hungary had enough and threw them all
[21:32] out but in that four months
[21:35] georgia cox was named the people's
[21:38] commissar for education and culture
[21:40] and under his
[21:42] one of his big programs was
[21:45] the institution of mandatory sex
[21:47] education in the schools
[21:49] um
[21:50] he's the very first as far as i'm aware
[21:51] the very first person to ever institute
[21:53] mandatory sex education in the public
[21:55] education system
[21:57] and
[21:58] his explicit goal like this is what he
[22:01] said he was trying to do this isn't
[22:03] some
[22:04] uh
[22:05] nobody was reading into this this is
[22:06] what he said he was trying to do was
[22:08] specifically
[22:10] um he wanted to strip
[22:13] christian sexual ethics from the
[22:14] children
[22:16] um and he did this by showing them
[22:17] graphic sexual content
[22:19] he did this by uh teaching them that
[22:21] they should openly mock monogamy
[22:24] and traditional marriage that free love
[22:26] was the way to go and anyone who didn't
[22:28] want to have some sort of like free love
[22:29] society was just backwards and was being
[22:32] sexually repressed
[22:33] and anyone who's going to try to keep
[22:35] you under their boot of trying to keep
[22:37] you down and not let you have your free
[22:39] love society is just oppressive and not
[22:42] tolerant and you need to throw off their
[22:45] shackles and overthrow them
[22:47] and in a country in the 1917
[22:50] hungary is very christian the older
[22:52] generations did not believe in in this
[22:54] free love thing they were deeply
[22:56] christian and was completely contrary to
[22:57] their values and he said that it was his
[23:00] goal to drive a wedge between the
[23:02] younger generations and the older
[23:04] generations so that the younger
[23:05] generations would be bitter and angry
[23:07] and resentful towards the older
[23:08] generations
[23:09] so that they would later become violent
[23:11] revolutionaries that he could use to
[23:13] overthrow the government this is
[23:16] and if you don't see that happening
[23:17] today turn on the news
[23:19] the amount of
[23:22] look into anything like the terms
[23:24] they'll use is things like comprehensive
[23:25] sexual education and social emotional
[23:28] learning
[23:29] seo is not necessarily um
[23:33] explicitly going down that road but if
[23:35] you if anybody has any kids in in sort
[23:37] of any sort of
[23:38] public education or
[23:40] or private school anything like that any
[23:43] institutional education system
[23:45] if they have sel courses on their course
[23:47] schedule be very careful about what
[23:50] those the school is teaching them
[23:51] because they
[23:52] will get into it later but the stuff
[23:54] that they are starting to come out with
[23:55] is this it is this exactly
[23:58] um they are they are uh directly using
[24:01] sex ed and as i said social emotional
[24:04] learning to bring in
[24:07] what is literally um
[24:09] propaganda communist propaganda
[24:12] to destroy the the sexual morality of
[24:14] children and i'm talking about
[24:16] ten-year-olds
[24:17] right
[24:18] because if you if you destroy their
[24:21] morality at that young of an age they're
[24:22] not going to grow up in anything
[24:24] anything more
[24:25] and so lou cox his whole aim he believed
[24:29] that if you wanted to bring a country to
[24:32] communism you had to completely rip
[24:36] any sort of christian culture out of it
[24:38] he explicitly said
[24:40] that christianity was an antidote to
[24:45] communism if a nation was christian they
[24:47] could not be communist if they were
[24:49] completely mutually exclusive
[24:52] one will destroy the other and if you're
[24:54] a communist obviously you know which one
[24:56] you want to win so you make sure you
[24:57] destroy that christian culture any means
[25:00] necessary if that means destroying the
[25:02] psychologies of children because they
[25:04] know that's what happens if you show
[25:05] children a bunch of graphic sexual
[25:06] content
[25:07] they said that kids who are exposed to
[25:09] extreme sexual content at a young age
[25:13] have a incredibly higher rate of
[25:17] schizophrenia bipolar disorder clinical
[25:20] depression all these things can be
[25:22] directly linked to the exposure of
[25:24] graphic sexual content at a young age
[25:26] and we are
[25:29] i mean
[25:30] there are uh various news stories of of
[25:32] places like um especially in california
[25:35] no no surprise there um that they're
[25:38] starting to implement this stuff where
[25:39] they're teaching children and they're
[25:41] using graphic sexual content to do it um
[25:44] like i said we'll get into that a little
[25:45] bit later i just want to cover this
[25:47] stuff because
[25:48] it's important these people um
[25:51] okay
[25:52] these people were the foundation for
[25:54] what we are seeing today
[25:56] because
[25:58] they would later go on to form something
[26:00] known as the frankfurt school
[26:03] because a lot of maybe you were
[26:04] wondering how does a couple of obscure
[26:06] intellectuals in hungary and italy have
[26:09] anything to do with american culture
[26:11] it's because um around 1919 like after
[26:14] luke cox got run out of hungary
[26:17] and uh
[26:18] gramsci
[26:20] he was italian he eventually also went
[26:22] to frankfurt as well and influenced them
[26:24] as well there was this um
[26:26] organization called the institute for
[26:27] social research in frankfurt germany and
[26:30] they were
[26:31] explicitly marxist they were communists
[26:33] and when lucox and gramsci came down
[26:36] they took them in they heard what they
[26:38] had to say and were absolutely enamored
[26:39] with it they said these guys know
[26:40] exactly what the right way to communism
[26:43] is we're going to use their teachings to
[26:45] implement communism across the world
[26:47] we're going to develop it into
[26:49] not just theoretical but practical
[26:51] applications we're going to learn how to
[26:54] implement
[26:55] the destruction of culture as a way to
[26:59] push in
[27:01] communist politics
[27:03] we're going to figure out ways of doing
[27:05] that practically speaking and um
[27:08] they create the frankfurt school they
[27:09] lived there for for from it was
[27:11] officially established in 1927 and by
[27:14] the 1930s the nazi party had come along
[27:16] in germany and the nazis didn't really
[27:18] like communists all that much so they
[27:19] ran them all out of germany and the
[27:22] frankfurt school packed up and came to
[27:24] the shores of america
[27:25] and i believe was princeton a university
[27:28] they set up there and that's how you get
[27:30] a bunch of
[27:32] fringe communist academics became
[27:34] integral to american education
[27:38] they were taken very seriously in
[27:39] america they had a lot of authority and
[27:41] they
[27:42] over the course of
[27:44] 50 years
[27:46] began to produce a lot of
[27:48] academics out of that school that went
[27:51] on to become professors at every
[27:52] university in america
[27:54] and by the
[27:55] 1950s or so you had
[27:59] herbert marcuzza who was one of those
[28:01] academics
[28:02] published a paper called um
[28:04] arrows in society where he is talking
[28:06] about
[28:07] how you basically need to rethink age of
[28:10] consent laws for children
[28:12] because this is a path to
[28:14] if you can sexualize children at a
[28:16] younger and younger age and lower the
[28:18] age of consent from 18 to 16 to 12
[28:22] and start
[28:23] exposing children to this sort of
[28:26] sexual behavior at a very young age you
[28:27] can destroy christian morality in the
[28:30] nation and this is a path to communism
[28:32] this was
[28:33] well established by the 1950s
[28:35] and in the frankfurt school and it was
[28:36] well established in american academics
[28:40] and i think we're about out of time but
[28:43] that's the history of how you got this
[28:46] theory things like um
[28:48] uh
[28:49] just as in my last couple minutes i just
[28:51] want to make one last
[28:52] clarification i did use the terms
[28:54] critical race theory and critical gender
[28:56] theory last time the frankfurt school
[28:57] took the ideas of of um
[29:01] lucox and gramsci and several other
[29:03] people
[29:04] packaged them up into sort of one
[29:07] umbrella and said yes the way to
[29:08] communism to destroy the culture
[29:10] especially christian morality
[29:12] specifically because if you have a
[29:13] christian people they will be completely
[29:15] immune to this stuff so we have to find
[29:17] a way to just rip sexual or christian
[29:19] sexual morality away from the people any
[29:21] sort of christian morality at all take
[29:23] it all away because this is the path to
[29:25] communism and
[29:27] um
[29:28] they titled they packaged all up on
[29:30] umbrella called critical theory they're
[29:32] gonna be critical of the dominant
[29:33] culture
[29:34] and
[29:35] um
[29:36] this is and they is critical they have a
[29:39] larger bill of critical theory and then
[29:40] you underneath that you have things like
[29:41] critical race theory critical gender
[29:43] theory uh critical pedagogy which is a
[29:45] study of education um all these
[29:47] different critical theories and this is
[29:50] how you can take the principles of marx
[29:52] this is why i started with him the idea
[29:54] that everyone's an oppressor and
[29:54] oppressed everyone is you gotta you know
[29:57] fight the power destroy all of culture
[29:59] to promote this
[30:02] uh you know to lift up the oppressed
[30:04] people and um
[30:07] you can apply it to pretty much any
[30:08] different group of people that you want
[30:10] and because they believe that
[30:12] we're not just going to break society up
[30:13] along any one line we're going to attack
[30:15] every line of division that we can
[30:17] possibly find and blow society to pieces
[30:19] so that we can build our utopia
[30:22] and it all come down to the reality of
[30:24] it is
[30:25] human beings
[30:28] wanted to bring the millennium onto
[30:30] earth
[30:31] it's all utopian so they they can see
[30:33] that the world is broken they can see
[30:35] that the human beings are flawed
[30:38] and
[30:39] they want to bring they want they they
[30:41] have a deep longing for
[30:43] god and and what god can do for humanity
[30:46] but they don't actually have a means of
[30:49] doing it outside of politics because
[30:51] they can't conform to the word
[30:53] so
[30:54] they're going to do it through politics
[30:55] they're going to do it through
[30:57] ways that end up killing millions of
[30:58] people
[30:59] and um
[31:02] it's it's just the re-manifestation uh
[31:04] of that is what we're seeing today so uh
[31:06] i guess we're out of time thank you for
[31:08] being patient listening and dealing and
[31:11] going through our bit of a dry history
[31:13] class um
[31:15] and hopefully we'll get into a little
[31:16] bit more practical stuff next week and i
[31:18] can kind of tie it all together for you
[31:20] and make you see how it's really applies
[31:23] in the modern day so we'll stand and
[31:25] have a word of prayer
[31:27] lord ask thank you for this opportunity
[31:30] to speak to the people and hope that you
[31:31] would take my words and
[31:34] do something with it with them that they
[31:36] would be able to
[31:38] apply to their lives and see how the day
[31:41] is becoming evil and corrupt
[31:43] and ask that you would
[31:45] would
[31:46] take all my broken speaking and stitch
[31:49] it together into something beautiful ask
[31:50] these things in jesus name amen
[32:33] [Music]
[32:41] [Music]
[32:49] [Music]
[33:02] do
[33:04] [Music]
[33:11] [Music]
[33:18] [Music]
[33:39] so
