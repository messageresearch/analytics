saying that the entire tape of communion I just felt the Lord put this upon my heart to uh to play there's so much good in it I I was just going to read some of the quotes from it um just paragraphs before we took communion tonight but it was just so good I thought it's only 15 minutes long I think we can definitely have time for that and just keep playing that if you could and um just as you as you enter into that that tape you know I just want you to uh to enter in to that I believe that the Lord has something for us in that and even when brother Brandon prays is going to be a portion to

strain from the heart go ahead brother Mark you can play that you can be seated amen go ahead brother Mark you can start that now amen maybe just play something just as he's getting that ready brother Andrew softly if you [Music] could tonight hear this wonderful message from from the lips of our brother we believe to be anointed of the Holy Spirit to bring us these great Tidings of as the set of exhortation how we should live in this present day and Holiness before God and before one another we we want this Holiness Among Us that no filthy Communications be heard Among Us at all as we profess this great calling of God we must walk worthy of this thing that God has brought us to and we're waiting down towards the end of the journey now where we're expecting exceeding abundantly above all that we do and remember we want to constantly be in prayer Above All Things watch your life if your life don't tally up with God's holiness then go back and start praying again there's something wrong see we must live in that kind of a state that the fruits of the spirit will make itself known through it that's what we want to live you know sometime we you're great preachers who can preach mighty but we'd rather see a sermon live than we would heard one preach that's the evidence that God is on the inside now we are having coming to the communion table and now uh there's some that doesn't take communion and maybe they just take it in their own churches but we'd be happy tonight if you could want to fellowship with us around these things we never draw any lines of who as long as you're walking worthy uh of the gospel that you're you're listening to and confessing to be part of you know you're part of this gospel amen you are you are written Epistles of what we're talking about and as long as we do something that's reproachful then we are an indent to what we're listening to we must live what we believe and live it in such a way that it will never reproach but reflect Jesus Christ in all things that we do and say that's the way it is we just love him for this and now tonight we're going to read the order of the Lord's table that's found over in 2 Corinthians about the 11th chapter and we read this and just like each individual how we do this if there's newcomers among us we call the people around the altar in in succession as they come in take the communion and every Christian is worthy now if you live a life that proves what you are you want to search your heart or let me be sure to mentioned it that the scripture reads here if we take it unworthily now we know that we are not worthy in ourselves none of God Amen but that we are not trusting in our own worthiness we're trusting in Him who has we're trusting in his worthy amen that we have died to our own thinking and just think his thoughts and live that everything that we believe he commands us to and look back and see what we're living look our life over and if we're doing things that's not worthy of the Gospel then we shouldn't take the communion but if we're doing things that we think that it that our lives could be read of all man that if anybody could not point a finger and say I seen this man in a barroom the other day I I heard this man standing telling filthy jokes this woman doing wrong then if you know that that's the Holy Spirit pointing to you that then don't take the communion but if you if you feel that that you're living at look back and see all your sins are confessed in another Blood then you you're supposed to take it you're part of it now let us read the scripture just as St Paul exorts us here in the book of St John the I figure Parton in book of 1 Corinthians the U the 11th chapter beginning with the 23rd verse for I have received of the Lord which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which is betrayed took bread wish I had time to to speak that a little bit the same night that he was betrayed you see he took bread and when he had give thanks he break it said Take and Eat This is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he took saying this cup is of the new test in my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as off as you as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show forth the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man EXA Exon himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among it many sleep for if we should judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world yeah I bring that a point when we are judged by the word which is Christ we're chasen if we're doing wrong we're not living up to this word we're chastened of the Lord and when the Lord chastens us that means corrects us that we should not be condemned with the world we are not of the world Amen we are different from the world live a different life a separated life hallelujah we're never to live the life of the world and be a Christian we're to live a an outstanding life a different life not I don't mean in such social ranks but I mean we're to live a life of genuine Holiness amen that the fruits of the spirit might be seen in us the meekness and gentleness and patience longsuffering Faith the fruit of the spirit for for when we are hear these things then we know we're chasen of the Lord that we don't do then we are condemned and if we have no condemnation within us that we're living Above That Thing by the grace of God then we're not condemned of the world but we're living above the things of the world you see amen wherefor my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for the other and if any man hungry let him eat at home that you be not come together unto condation and the rest I will set in order when I come we've always made great exhortations on this that when we come together even though that we can see nothing there might be something in somebody else that we noticed that wasn't right when you come together to eat this communion I'll wait on one another pray for one another pray that we always make it this I pray for you that if you if there's some sin in you that some unrighteous deed or something you've done as a believer I I pray that God will take it out of you that he'll forgive you for it and you pray for me that if there's some something that I've done that I don't know just about if I've done it and know that's wrong I I'll confess it right now I'm fixing because he that eateth and drth unworthy eat and drinks damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body the discern of knowing that you are the Lord's body you can't discern it in wickedness and sin we've got to be above that that we we discern that the Lord is righteous and we discern that he's our propitiation that all of our sins we confess and we believe in him and waiting upon his atonement to cleanse us from all of our iniquity then we're Discerning the Lord's body of what it discernment of what is far then Discerning again that in among us as the Lord's bride body let's discern if there's anything wrong with us in here that would hinder the gospel from growing or the Lord from presenting us to before God as a Chase version let's discern that out right now and find if it's wrong let's confess it let's say Lord I'm sorry about that so therefore there might be something that we've done you've done something I've done it might not be consciously right now let's ask God to forgive us for we used to sing a song Here forgive the the sins I have confessed to thee they don't even unknown things we we we pray God forgive him now I said when you come together carry one for the other and that really would be like this carry one with the other carry means to wait wait on each other let's do that now I pray for you if you know anything that you've done wrong that God forgive me I didn't mean that and if you help me from this night on I will do it again I I mean it Lord I won't do it again if you just forgive me and up all my confession I believe you have for forgive me I go to take the body of Christ feeling in my heart that you forgive me for all my sins I pray then for your secret sin you pray for mine that maybe something we don't know about that we won't come together condemn with the world we don't want the world in here this little spot of people that God has given us to worship with here we want to keep ourselves clean from selfishness keep our thing our s Our Lives clean from all the things of the world that we've been spotted with that we want to be ready for the Rapture amen so let us pray now silently for one another just a moment you pray for me as I pray for you Lord Jesus let it be Lord that all of our sins be now in the blood of the Lord Jesus in the forgetfulness of God's recollection that we come together now as beloved Believers and children in Christ well we ask it in his name amen now at this time while the the elders I think they come to the front is that still the Tony brother Tony a and he will direct it and if there's any has to go now don't want to stay for the communion we're happy to have you in tonight remember our Wednesday Wednesday night prayer meeting and you slip out quietly while the rest of them come to the Altar and brother Z here will direct the the people to the altar while we make ready the [Music]
