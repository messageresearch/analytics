[30:46] they're real
[30:47] real loud and so you could turn those
[30:49] down just a little bit on my left and
[30:51] right just here
[30:52] the age of neurotics and i'd like to
[30:56] subtitle this
[30:57] the spirit of the last days or the
[31:00] spirit
[31:01] of the end time i want to read you
[31:03] something that i didn't have time to put
[31:05] up
[31:06] uh on the overhead but i'm just going to
[31:08] read it i want you just to listen as
[31:09] best that you can
[31:10] amen i have it here before me that's
[31:12] better perfect thank you brother mark
[31:14] uh and i want to just read this before
[31:17] you and just listen
[31:18] this is brother branham and the lady you
[31:19] see in church age god says
[31:22] this church of the ladies see in age is
[31:24] wretched
[31:25] that word comes from two greek words
[31:27] which mean
[31:28] endure and trial has nothing to do with
[31:31] trials that come to a true christian for
[31:33] god describes a christian
[31:35] in trial as blessed his attitude and his
[31:39] attitude one of joy
[31:40] whereas this description is phrased as
[31:43] wretched
[31:44] and miserable how strange now listen to
[31:47] how he says this how strange
[31:49] in this age of plenty and in this age of
[31:53] progress in this age of abundance
[31:56] how can there be trials well now it is
[31:59] strange
[32:00] but in this age of plenty and
[32:02] opportunity
[32:03] when everyone has so much and there is
[32:07] so much more to be had what with all the
[32:10] inventions to do our work
[32:12] and so many things to give us pleasure
[32:15] suddenly
[32:16] we find mental illness taking such a
[32:19] toll
[32:19] as to alarm the nation when everybody
[32:22] ought to be happy
[32:24] with really nothing to be unhappy about
[32:27] millions are taking sedatives at night
[32:30] pet pills in the morning
[32:32] rushing to doctors entering institutions
[32:35] and trying to drown out unknown fears
[32:39] by alcohol yes this age
[32:43] boasts of its tremendous stores
[32:46] of worldly goods but the people are less
[32:49] happy than ever this age
[32:52] boasts of better moral values and it's
[32:55] more corrupt
[32:56] than any age since the flood
[33:00] it talks about its knowledge in science
[33:02] but it's fighting a losing battle
[33:04] in all fields for the human mind and
[33:08] soul and spirit cannot comprehend
[33:12] or keep abreast with all the changes
[33:15] that have come upon the earth in one
[33:18] generation
[33:19] we have went from the horse and buggy
[33:22] all the way
[33:23] in one generation we've went from the
[33:26] horse and buggy
[33:27] all the way to the space age and we're
[33:30] proud
[33:31] and boastful about it but inside
[33:34] is a dark void cavern
[33:38] that is crying out in torment
[33:41] and without a known reason
[33:44] men's hearts are felling for fear
[33:48] and the world is so darkened that this
[33:51] age could well be called
[33:53] the age of neurotics
[33:56] it boasts but it cannot back it up
[34:00] and brother joe carter texted this in
[34:02] our sound booth chat and
[34:03] actually had it pulled up as a
[34:06] definition i'm just going to read it
[34:08] for some of us who would hear the word
[34:10] neurotic and i'm sure we could all
[34:11] derive
[34:13] our own meanings from that word but i
[34:16] want to read you just exactly what
[34:18] a neurotic would mean and i think
[34:20] brother branham even
[34:21] would apply this word differently you'll
[34:23] find brother branham in one place saying
[34:25] that he's been in erotic his whole life
[34:27] he says anyone who's who's inspired or
[34:29] he says inspired musicians to
[34:31] songwriters he said they tend to be
[34:33] neurotics now what he's speaking of
[34:35] there is a nervous person a person who's
[34:37] just nervous that's a
[34:38] a condition that some people have others
[34:40] don't have it
[34:41] uh and it's not at all what i'm
[34:43] preaching on tonight so i just wanted to
[34:44] clear
[34:45] to make sure we're clear on that i'm
[34:47] speaking of a condition of the end time
[34:49] that the world would
[34:50] fall under and neurotic means that
[34:53] you're afflicted
[34:55] by neurosis a word that has been in use
[34:58] since the 1700s to describe mental
[35:01] emotional or physical reactions
[35:05] that are drastic and irrational
[35:08] at its root a neurotic behavior is an
[35:11] automatic unconscious effort to manage
[35:15] deep
[35:16] anxiety now listen to what brother
[35:19] manning begins to say here about this
[35:21] age of neurotics
[35:23] he says it boasts now listen uh because
[35:25] we don't have it so just i wish i could
[35:27] uh post this but we don't he says there
[35:30] without a known reason their hearts are
[35:31] falling for fear he says
[35:33] it could well be called the age of
[35:35] neurotics
[35:36] it boasts but it cannot back it up
[35:39] it cries peace and there is no peace
[35:43] it cries that it has great amplitude of
[35:46] all things
[35:47] but it keeps burning with desire like an
[35:49] unsatisfied fire
[35:51] there is no peace saith my god to the
[35:54] wicked they are
[35:55] miserable that means they're objects to
[35:58] be pitied
[35:59] they're full of pride they want what
[36:01] they have
[36:02] but what they have will not stand the
[36:05] test of time
[36:06] they have built upon quicksand
[36:09] rather than the rock of revelation of
[36:12] god's word
[36:13] soon cometh the earthquake soon
[36:17] there will come the storms
[36:20] of the wrath of god in judgment
[36:24] then comes sudden
[36:27] destruction i thought it was amazing how
[36:30] the prophet lays that out
[36:33] soon cometh the earthquake soon cometh
[36:36] the
[36:36] storms of judgment my brother my sister
[36:40] i believe we're in a storm they call
[36:43] covet 19. let me tell you what it is
[36:45] this is a storm of judgment
[36:47] this is a precursor even brother branham
[36:50] when he preaches the oncoming storm and
[36:52] he points to a hurricane going to strike
[36:54] florida
[36:55] brother branham says that's a storm of
[36:57] judgment god's pouring a little bit of
[37:00] wrath
[37:00] upon a state for their sinfulness and
[37:03] for rejecting god
[37:04] so you say what is this end time that's
[37:07] taken place
[37:08] uh it's pre-tribulational storms
[37:12] and and as a storm brewing brother
[37:13] branham says he says first comes the
[37:16] earthquake after all this age boasts of
[37:18] all that it has
[37:19] and he says but inside he says they're
[37:21] empty they're they're their own pain
[37:23] pills they're on
[37:24] uh they're they're they're going to
[37:25] doctors they're going to institutions
[37:27] they have everything it's the
[37:29] age of increase of knowledge it's the
[37:31] age of increase of goods and worldly
[37:33] pleasures he says but more than ever
[37:36] they're neurotics they're insane they're
[37:38] on the edge their stress is high their
[37:40] anxiety and depression is uh suffocating
[37:44] a generation of young people
[37:46] suicide on the rise higher than any
[37:49] other
[37:49] if you look at a graph of of of death by
[37:52] suicide from the age of 13 and under
[37:54] it's unparalleled in 2000
[37:57] from 2001 to 2020. just that graph alone
[38:01] is unparalleled than any other
[38:02] generation of people
[38:04] young people taking their lives uh older
[38:07] addicted to pain pills yet more
[38:09] increased have more
[38:10] uh money than you could ever ask for
[38:13] have more goods than you could ever ask
[38:14] for
[38:15] and he says but that's why he says
[38:16] they're an object of pity
[38:18] they've built upon quickstand instead of
[38:21] the revelation of god's word
[38:22] soon cometh the earthquake soon cometh
[38:25] the storms of wrath of god and judgment
[38:27] then comes sudden destruction and in
[38:31] spite of all of their carnal preparation
[38:34] they will still be unprepared for what
[38:37] comes upon the earth
[38:40] brother brandon begins to preach on this
[38:42] age of neurotics and the holy spirit
[38:43] just begin to deal with me
[38:45] uh this past sunday as i was just even
[38:47] uh the saturday night and
[38:49] and preparing to minister sunday this uh
[38:52] yesterday or sunday
[38:53] the day after and also sunday morning
[38:56] and the lord began to just ask me a
[38:57] question
[38:58] what are you pursuing and what are you
[39:01] chasing
[39:02] and i've stopped to ask myself that
[39:04] question even as i was just in my
[39:06] vehicle and thought
[39:07] you know what it what am i what am i
[39:09] going for what am i
[39:10] after what is what am i pursuing in life
[39:13] have you ever stopped and just asked
[39:15] yourself that question
[39:16] and what is it that i'm chasing what am
[39:19] i trying to obtain not
[39:21] not saying that it's wrong i believe you
[39:23] should have something you're pursuing
[39:25] something you're chasing but i also
[39:27] believe that you should be able to
[39:28] clearly
[39:29] define what you're chasing and what
[39:31] you're pursuing
[39:33] and it should line up with what the word
[39:34] of god tells us of what we should be
[39:36] after
[39:37] because everyone is pursuing something
[39:40] in this life and the lord just begin to
[39:42] deal with my heart
[39:44] you know thomas jefferson said that it
[39:46] was the government's job to protect our
[39:49] right
[39:49] uh of liberty and and justice and life
[39:53] that
[39:53] that it's in the deca relation
[39:55] declaration of independence to
[39:57] to the the pursuit of liberty and the
[39:59] pursuit of justice and
[40:01] the pursuit of life liberty and and the
[40:03] pursuit of happiness
[40:05] and i thought it was amazing because
[40:07] even the crafters who wrote this
[40:09] document
[40:10] uh you have john adams and benjamin
[40:13] franklin and sherman and livingston
[40:15] and jefferson and they said it's it's
[40:17] our inalienable
[40:19] right thought of this as humanity that
[40:21] we're endowed by our creator that we've
[40:24] been given
[40:24] god-given inalienable rights and i
[40:27] believe that we have
[40:29] but i also believe that man as the
[40:31] prophet said
[40:32] always perverts what god gives him
[40:35] god gives them life and man chooses
[40:38] death he gives them creation and man
[40:40] uses creation
[40:41] to destroy himself life liberty
[40:45] and the pursuit of happiness those three
[40:48] words
[40:49] you find in the declaration of
[40:51] independence and it tells us their
[40:54] our unalienable rights that the
[40:56] governments are created to protect the
[40:58] right to life
[41:00] the right to happiness the right for the
[41:02] american citizen to pursue it
[41:05] to pursue life to pursue liberty
[41:08] to pursue happiness and we find that
[41:12] humanity has been on a
[41:14] lifelong pursuit a lifelong
[41:17] quest trying to capture what the
[41:20] crafters meant
[41:21] trying to uh to to to to to capture
[41:25] what's been coined as the american dream
[41:29] and everybody's pursuing something i
[41:32] begin to just write this
[41:33] in the lord as the lord gave it to me
[41:35] you know some people pursue
[41:37] a career and it's okay to have a career
[41:40] it's okay to pursue a career so make
[41:41] sure
[41:42] you don't misunderstand me here today
[41:44] but some people pursue
[41:46] a career a vocation something god has
[41:50] called them to no doubt something god
[41:51] has gifted them to
[41:53] but they can pursue that career
[41:56] uh so hard and chase something their
[42:00] entire life
[42:01] trying to excel and trying to climb the
[42:04] ladder trying to break the barrier
[42:06] trying to get a promotion
[42:08] trying to go further and they run and
[42:10] spend their money and spend their wheels
[42:12] and they invest their time
[42:14] and if they're not careful rather than
[42:16] being content
[42:17] in the gift that god made them there's a
[42:21] chase there's a always pursuing they're
[42:23] never satisfied it's
[42:25] enough is never enough as rockefeller
[42:27] was asked how much money is enough
[42:29] a little more than i've got and there's
[42:31] always just this pursuit of it's never
[42:33] enough it's never there's never any
[42:35] contentment
[42:36] within the confines of the american
[42:39] dream
[42:40] it's never enough will you say i've
[42:42] arrived when have you arrived when have
[42:43] someone actually
[42:45] when you say i made it well when have
[42:47] you made it when you make
[42:48] a million when you're making six figures
[42:50] a year when you have a uh
[42:52] you know the nicest cars what what
[42:54] defines
[42:55] i've made it they're always pursuing
[42:59] they're always chasing they're always
[43:01] building they're always
[43:02] bettering and you say brother man is
[43:04] something wrong no there's nothing god
[43:06] sometimes
[43:06] inspires you to better yourself or to
[43:10] excel at what you do in your vocation
[43:12] and life
[43:13] but if we're not careful we come under
[43:15] the spirit
[43:16] of a neurotic we come under the spirit
[43:19] of the last day and what we realize is
[43:22] that the entire world is
[43:24] under an anointing they're under a
[43:26] spirit they're there it's a spirit of
[43:28] greed
[43:29] and an unsatiable unsatisfiable
[43:33] appetite for more and then more and then
[43:36] more
[43:36] and then more and then more and then a
[43:38] little bit more of that
[43:40] and they pursue and they chase and they
[43:42] run and the lord began to ask me what
[43:44] are you chasing
[43:45] what is your pursuit in life what do you
[43:47] call successful
[43:49] what do you call what do you call it
[43:52] when you can say i made it
[43:55] you know some pursue money they're
[43:57] always chasing the next big
[43:59] paycheck or the next big opportunity
[44:02] some
[44:02] are chasing the bigger uh things of life
[44:05] a better car
[44:06] better house some are pursuing social
[44:08] acceptance
[44:09] in a higher class than what they are
[44:11] right now
[44:13] some people pursue an image their entire
[44:15] life
[44:16] and they they have an image of what it
[44:18] looks like to be successful and
[44:20] what successful people drive and what
[44:22] successful people wear
[44:24] and their as brother adam said in the
[44:25] world has the phrase keeping up with the
[44:27] joneses
[44:28] and it's an intoxicating spirit that is
[44:32] suffocating and it's it's all
[44:34] encompassing
[44:35] the minds of the world today they
[44:38] they do and then they're trying to make
[44:40] it they're trying to run after it
[44:42] they're trying to gain it they're trying
[44:43] to accomplish something
[44:46] and then the lord told me and i just
[44:48] began to write down
[44:49] you know some takes money some chase
[44:51] career some chase
[44:52] this or social acceptance or an image
[44:55] and then there's others who are pursuing
[44:57] something and they really don't know
[44:59] what they're pursuing
[45:01] they really can't quantify or qualify or
[45:05] justify
[45:06] or explain to you really they're driven
[45:09] they wake up every day they
[45:11] they're pushing towards something they
[45:13] don't really know what they're pursuing
[45:15] they wake up every day chasing running
[45:18] working
[45:18] laboring sweating but at the end of it
[45:21] all what are they striving for
[45:23] what is it that they're trying to obtain
[45:29] and i believe even us ourself if we're
[45:31] not careful
[45:32] we can ingest and and become almost
[45:35] under that same spirit that's upon this
[45:37] age that we live in
[45:39] where we have to stop just for a moment
[45:41] and say what am i
[45:43] seeking what am i chasing what am i
[45:45] pursuing
[45:46] what is driving me because something is
[45:49] driving you
[45:51] the world is chasing this american dream
[45:54] you're to pursue life you're to pursue
[45:56] liberty you're to pursue happiness
[46:00] and some find nothing but uh you know
[46:04] as the bible says and i found this is
[46:05] amazing in jonah chapter 2 verse 8 it
[46:08] says they
[46:09] that observe lying vanities forsake
[46:12] their own mercy
[46:13] listen what solomon says in ecclesiastes
[46:15] one vanity of vanity saith the preacher
[46:18] vanity of vanities all is vanity what
[46:21] prophet hath a man of all his labor
[46:23] which he taketh under the sun one
[46:25] generation passeth away
[46:27] and another generation cometh but the
[46:29] earth abideth forever
[46:30] job 15 let him that is deceived trust in
[46:34] vanity
[46:35] for vanity shall be his recompense
[46:39] david says in psalms 31 i have hated
[46:42] them that regard
[46:43] lying vanity but i trust
[46:46] in the lord
[46:50] you wonder why the world is constantly
[46:53] under a
[46:54] cycle of of or brother adam said it was
[46:56] an age of neurotics
[46:58] and it's under you're even born with
[47:01] this pursuit of happiness
[47:03] you're born with this pursuit of success
[47:06] to live the american dream to be
[47:08] successful
[47:09] what does it mean i'm to get a career go
[47:11] to college have a 401k
[47:12] retire young you know my children go to
[47:14] college and we picture in this entire
[47:16] envision
[47:17] of an american dream and they're chasing
[47:19] it they're looking for it they're
[47:20] pursuing it
[47:22] but my question tonight is have they
[47:24] found it
[47:26] have they found what they're looking for
[47:30] have they found that satisfaction after
[47:32] all of their gaining and all of their
[47:34] attaining and all of their pursuing
[47:37] what is it given them have they
[47:40] found what they're looking for let me
[47:42] tell you
[47:43] what i think when i look around the
[47:45] united states of america
[47:47] and i ask myself have you found what
[47:50] you're pursuing
[47:52] well our streets are burning
[47:58] our our our cities are are our leaders
[48:01] are screaming
[48:04] our our parties of of republican uh of
[48:07] of of democrats and republicans and
[48:09] conservatives
[48:10] our entire world is in each other's
[48:12] throats
[48:13] the entire world is on fire our our
[48:16] cities are being looted our streets are
[48:18] being burned
[48:19] no one has an answer it's all full of
[48:21] hatred and malice and jealousy
[48:25] the world today is full of fear it's a
[48:28] world full of fear
[48:30] where people live in a constant state of
[48:32] panic
[48:34] and just they're just always on the edge
[48:36] and they're always just
[48:37] ready to explode you don't know who's
[48:39] beside you at the stoplight you better
[48:41] be careful how you look at them you
[48:42] never know
[48:43] how quickly someone can just snap
[48:47] because it's an age of neurotics with a
[48:48] very thin veneer
[48:50] of happiness and the world has a very
[48:54] thin
[48:55] shallow veneer of happiness and joy
[48:58] have they found what they're looking for
[49:00] has all of this brought them
[49:02] real true joy have they really found
[49:05] life our streets are burning our leaders
[49:08] are screaming
[49:09] our people are fighting our world is
[49:11] full of fear
[49:12] our world is full of pressure our world
[49:14] is full of of hatred and
[49:16] malice and envy you know
[49:19] news i thought of this news has always
[49:21] been news
[49:23] and your generation some of you elderly
[49:26] when you were
[49:27] young there was news then there was news
[49:30] a new
[49:30] cycle was always revolving there was
[49:32] always something happening in the world
[49:34] we don't live in the age where suddenly
[49:36] things are taking place it's always been
[49:38] that way
[49:39] the only difference was is back then you
[49:40] heard about something at the barber shop
[49:43] maybe something someone read or a
[49:44] telegram someone sent you or a letter
[49:46] someone wrote you or
[49:47] maybe you heard about it you read it in
[49:49] a local newspaper but there was no
[49:51] connection between
[49:52] nation and nation and state and state
[49:56] there was nothing unifying there was
[49:58] nothing connecting and so you just lived
[50:00] in your own little nucleus their own
[50:01] little world
[50:03] but but what's changed today news cycle
[50:06] has always
[50:07] been here but now we live in the age
[50:11] of information we live in the age of the
[50:15] dawning of the internet the cord
[50:19] that unifies everybody
[50:22] the we live in the age of social
[50:24] connection where
[50:25] we're more connected than we've ever
[50:27] been and it's just at the click of a
[50:29] finger
[50:29] you can contact someone in another
[50:31] country you can be on skype or on
[50:33] a facetime or whatever a video
[50:36] conferencing
[50:37] you want to name with somebody thousands
[50:39] of miles across the world
[50:41] and and we live in an age listen to me
[50:43] friends we live in an
[50:44] age of information and with just the
[50:47] click
[50:47] of a button the press of a finger
[50:50] the pinch of two fingers you can ingest
[50:53] and
[50:54] consume a gallon of hatred
[50:57] you can congest and ingest just log on
[51:00] to your social platforms and scroll
[51:02] through
[51:02] three or four pages you can ingest all
[51:05] the hatred you could ever want
[51:07] all of the malice you ever want where
[51:09] everyone has an opinion and everyone has
[51:11] something to say and everybody's
[51:12] attacking everybody and everybody's
[51:14] making a stand for something and
[51:16] everybody's trying to be identified by
[51:17] something
[51:18] and everyone wants to give their two
[51:19] cents and they're constantly ingesting
[51:22] and constantly consuming
[51:24] your phones ding with notifications
[51:26] breaking news just now
[51:28] just in breaking and they live in this
[51:31] constant cycle of a new cycle of what's
[51:34] next and what's happening
[51:35] what's taking place and what's this
[51:37] person doing what's happening over here
[51:39] and they wonder why the world's going
[51:41] completely insane
[51:44] it's incessant uh you're just consumed
[51:47] listen to me friend this is no accident
[51:49] this is not
[51:50] random this is not just it just turned
[51:53] out this way how did we get here
[51:55] very intentionally how did we arrive
[51:58] here by a spirit
[51:59] intentionally that has led us to this
[52:01] moment
[52:03] because we're living in what's called
[52:04] satan's eden
[52:06] and satan has perfected his eden
[52:10] it's a constant notification a constant
[52:12] ingesting constant consumption
[52:15] it's not just random everything you read
[52:17] about uh the this this state of
[52:20] of this neurotic age that you live in is
[52:22] not by accident
[52:24] and listen to me brother it is being
[52:25] controlled it is very
[52:27] intentional it's controlled by an
[52:30] end-time
[52:31] spirit there is a leader to this great
[52:34] movement
[52:35] and that leader is greater than any

[1:02:15] how they begin to move it's the spirit
[1:02:18] of
[1:02:18] anything that does the work of it anyhow
[1:02:22] it's the spirit of anything that does
[1:02:26] remember what we said you're driven by
[1:02:28] something look this way
[1:02:29] you're driven by something you're
[1:02:30] pursuing something it's the spirit of
[1:02:32] anything that's motivating you
[1:02:34] that's why paul says try the spirit see
[1:02:36] whether they be of god or not
[1:02:38] right amen that's what we're taught you
[1:02:41] don't just take in anything you don't
[1:02:42] just do anything you pray about it you
[1:02:44] ask god lord
[1:02:45] i have the right spirit is my intention
[1:02:46] right is my motive right
[1:02:48] am i sure that that that i'm that i'm
[1:02:50] this is in the line and order of your
[1:02:52] word
[1:02:53] he says they're in the spirit he says
[1:02:55] the spirit of anything
[1:02:56] that does the work of it the people have
[1:02:58] to be in this kind of a spirit
[1:03:01] to bring in the latter days the peoples
[1:03:04] in the spirit of the latter days the
[1:03:06] nations are in the spirit
[1:03:08] of the end time they've got atomic
[1:03:11] weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of
[1:03:13] things

[1:03:26] had it wrong on my screen he says the
[1:03:28] people are in the spirit of the end time
[1:03:30] the church and he stops and he pivots
[1:03:34] the church is moving together
[1:03:37] under the power and the impact of the
[1:03:39] holy spirit
[1:03:41] notice we're not moving under the signs
[1:03:43] of the time we're not moving by the
[1:03:44] pressure
[1:03:45] we're not moving by the anxiety we're
[1:03:47] not under the spirit of tribulation
[1:03:49] or the spirit of destruction or the
[1:03:51] spirit of fear
[1:03:52] or the spirit of panic that's not what
[1:03:54] gets the bride ready
[1:03:55] she's under the power of the holy ghost
[1:03:58] she's hid away and tucked away in christ
[1:04:00] jesus who is her rock and mighty tower
[1:04:03] who is her strong tower who delivers her
[1:04:06] in the time of trouble
[1:04:07] [Music]

[1:04:18] playing that video not at all i'm glad
[1:04:20] that i did i believe it i believe
[1:04:21] there's
[1:04:22] uh a an importance there i believe it's
[1:04:24] something believers should be watching
[1:04:26] uh that it's good it's perfectly uh
[1:04:29] how would i say it it's perfectly
[1:04:31] harmless
[1:04:33] but let me just stop and say this that's
[1:04:35] not the spirit that you're under
[1:04:37] amen we've not received the spirit of
[1:04:39] fear the man the brother keeps saying
[1:04:42] brace yourself
[1:04:42] and those that miss the rapture and
[1:04:45] those that haven't received a rapture
[1:04:46] message
[1:04:47] here's their message brace yourself
[1:04:50] but let me tell you the message of the
[1:04:52] bride prepare yourself
[1:04:54] little bride the bride hath made herself
[1:04:57] ready
[1:04:58] to escape all of the judgments that are
[1:05:01] coming upon the earth
[1:05:02] that's why the bible says in the book of
[1:05:03] luke that that you count yourself that
[1:05:06] you watch
[1:05:06] that you're ready that you're vigilant
[1:05:08] that you're not taken by the cares of
[1:05:10] this world
[1:05:11] so that that day should take you unaware
[1:05:13] but that you could be found
[1:05:14] worthy to escape all of these things and
[1:05:17] stand before the son of man
[1:05:19] that's the message to the bride of jesus
[1:05:22] christ
[1:05:23] it's not a message of fear it's not a
[1:05:24] message of neurotics it's not a spirit
[1:05:26] of the last days
[1:05:28] we're under the spirit of the holy ghost
[1:05:30] we're under the power of the holy ghost
[1:05:32] we're being moved and motivated
[1:05:34] that's why we don't we're careful what
[1:05:36] we read we're careful what we watch
[1:05:38] we care for what we listen to some
[1:05:42] people will
[1:05:42] you better not watch you better stay
[1:05:44] away from those this movie or that movie
[1:05:46] absolutely amen you better watch what
[1:05:48] you watch you better pay attention to
[1:05:50] what you listen to
[1:05:51] let me go further than that you're not
[1:05:53] to be consumed with
[1:05:55] social media all the time you're not to
[1:05:57] be consumed with fox news and sean
[1:05:59] hannity and cnn and nbc i've never
[1:06:01] watched those anyways
[1:06:03] but you're not to be consumed with a
[1:06:05] constant
[1:06:06] cycle of news you're to be informed
[1:06:09] be careful you're not part of that age
[1:06:11] of neurotics that's just waiting for the
[1:06:13] next breaking news or the next thing to
[1:06:15] happen
[1:06:15] i'm watching and i'm waiting but my
[1:06:17] expectation is it's something that's
[1:06:19] worldly
[1:06:19] it's something that's heavenly i'm not
[1:06:22] looking for something natural i'm
[1:06:23] looking for the supernatural
[1:06:26] hallelujah he says the world's moving
[1:06:29] together into the church is moving
[1:06:31] together
[1:06:32] under the power and the impact of the
[1:06:34] holy spirit
[1:06:35] love how he says let's go to the next
[1:06:36] slide for the gideon he says
[1:06:38] god's getting ready to take his and the
[1:06:40] devil's getting ready to take his
[1:06:43] hallelujah getting ready to take his and
[1:06:47] i say lord come even so lord jesus
[1:06:50] come quickly and he says hallelujah we
[1:06:53] can't have the last days
[1:06:55] until people gets in the spirit
[1:06:58] of the last days
[1:07:03] we can't have a healing service now
[1:07:05] watch we can't have a healing service
[1:07:07] here
[1:07:08] until the people gets in the spirit of a
[1:07:10] healing service we can't have a feeling
[1:07:12] of the holy ghost
[1:07:13] until the people gets in that kind of an
[1:07:15] atmosphere and the people was in the
[1:07:16] atmosphere it pointed to noah
[1:07:18] he says the people was in that kind of
[1:07:20] atmosphere to bring judgment upon the
[1:07:22] earth
[1:07:22] and they're in the same atmosphere today
[1:07:25] eating drinking marion giving in
[1:07:28] marriage
[1:07:28] and all this kind of a thing like that
[1:07:31] it's producing
[1:07:32] a spirit that's why i told you it's
[1:07:34] preparing they have received a messenger
[1:07:37] and it's not the messenger of malachi 4
[1:07:39] it's the
[1:07:40] it's the angel of the bottomless pit and
[1:07:43] he's
[1:07:43] preaching to them a gospel and he's
[1:07:45] giving them a beat to march to
[1:07:47] they've got their music they've got
[1:07:49] their movies they've got their dance
[1:07:50] they've got their drugs
[1:07:52] they've got their alcohol they've got
[1:07:53] their cycles of news what is it doing
[1:07:56] it's literally preparing a people for
[1:07:58] destruction
[1:08:00] brother branham says god cannot sin
[1:08:02] destruction
[1:08:04] until they're in the spirit of
[1:08:05] destruction my brother led me to stop
[1:08:08] and say god cannot rapture a people
[1:08:10] until a people's in the spirit of a
[1:08:12] rapture god cannot
[1:08:13] god cannot send a revival until somebody
[1:08:16] says god send a revival
[1:08:18] i want a spirit of revival a spirit of
[1:08:20] the burning
[1:08:21] of the holy ghost god consider refilling
[1:08:24] if you're in the spirit of a refilling
[1:08:27] amen i say lord get us in the spirit not
[1:08:30] of an age of neurotics
[1:08:32] get us in the spirit not to believe a
[1:08:34] lie and be damned by it
[1:08:35] but to receive a message to be raptured
[1:08:38] by it
[1:08:39] to take me off of this earth to escape
[1:08:41] the destruction that's coming
[1:08:43] amen and i don't get there by
[1:08:47] giving my opinion on facebook and giving
[1:08:49] my opinion on this political party what
[1:08:50] donald trump and what this nancy pelosi
[1:08:52] and all the same brother matt do you
[1:08:53] what do you think about all those things

[1:08:59] this world
[1:09:00] is not my home i'm just passing through
[1:09:02] my treasures are somewhere laid up
[1:09:04] beyond the blue
[1:09:07] he says the people was in an atmosphere
[1:09:09] of the day to bring judgment
[1:09:11] he says upon the earth and they're in
[1:09:12] the same atmosphere today
[1:09:14] eating drinking marrying giving to
[1:09:15] marriage all kind all this kind of thing
[1:09:18] like that and the glory of god is being
[1:09:19] preached and demonstrated
[1:09:21] the power of the holy ghost setting
[1:09:22] forth an example of the resurrection of
[1:09:24] jesus christ that's going to take the
[1:09:26] church into glory
[1:09:27] just as certain as i'm standing here
[1:09:28] that's right and men
[1:09:30] are ignoring it paying no attention to
[1:09:33] it walking away from it because
[1:09:35] they're in the spirit amen

[1:11:05] movements that you have here's our
[1:11:07] our latest that seems to be a catch
[1:11:09] phrase today black lives matter
[1:11:11] and it's it's social let me just say
[1:11:12] this here just for a moment
[1:11:14] it's a it's a it's become becoming a
[1:11:16] cultural sign
[1:11:18] uh that that you better stand for
[1:11:19] something you better agree with
[1:11:21] something you better you better believe
[1:11:22] something
[1:11:23] and and the entire world i thought about
[1:11:25] this i thought you know it's amazing i
[1:11:27] was behind an individual and they had
[1:11:29] bumper stickers
[1:11:29] i couldn't even i couldn't even read
[1:11:33] uh what kind of vehicle it was i didn't
[1:11:35] know because the bumper stickers just
[1:11:36] were all over plastered all over the
[1:11:38] back of it
[1:11:40] and they had all of these man you just
[1:11:42] read just read a couple of them and you
[1:11:43] know sort of
[1:11:44] uh what kind of individual it is and i
[1:11:47] just thought i thought my goodness
[1:11:48] so so that this person is
[1:11:52] so in just determined to have a voice
[1:11:56] so determined to let you know this is
[1:11:58] how i feel
[1:12:00] this is where i stand this is what i
[1:12:02] think this is the bible prophesies we
[1:12:04] would have a generation of people like
[1:12:06] that
[1:12:07] that they would be lovers of their own
[1:12:10] self amen they don't stand in the mirror
[1:12:13] and go i'm so
[1:12:14] nice i look so good no no they exalt
[1:12:17] their opinions
[1:12:18] so high yes amen they believe what they
[1:12:21] think
[1:12:22] read a good bumper sticker one time you
[1:12:24] know the statement don't always believe
[1:12:25] what you hear
[1:12:26] this one says don't always believe what
[1:12:27] you think
[1:12:29] because you might be wrong amen amen
[1:12:34] don't always believe what you think
[1:12:36] because it's just what you
[1:12:37] think it's at the end of the day it's
[1:12:38] your opinion what do you see by the map
[1:12:40] when you look into the world i see do
[1:12:42] you see racism
[1:12:44] i see sin so i see racism does racism
[1:12:47] exist
[1:12:47] absolutely unequivocally exist amen why
[1:12:50] why does it exist because sin exists
[1:12:53] right of course it exists as injustices
[1:12:56] happen to different races
[1:12:58] absolutely it happens police brutality
[1:13:01] happens
[1:13:01] absolutely unequivocally happens because
[1:13:04] you have an unregenerate unborn again
[1:13:06] man
[1:13:06] and the bible says that he's a brute
[1:13:08] beast outside of the nature of god
[1:13:11] his his natural nature is a brute beast
[1:13:16] and so you put that man without
[1:13:18] character brother adam says what is
[1:13:20] power without character
[1:13:22] satanic yes amen power with characters
[1:13:25] fit to rule power without character
[1:13:26] satanic so you put a man with a badge
[1:13:28] behind behind a man with a badge give
[1:13:30] him a little bit of authority
[1:13:32] i'm thankful to god for good police
[1:13:35] but that doesn't mean every police is
[1:13:36] good police

[1:19:04] the word of god says
[1:19:05] we foster a queer affirming network when
[1:19:08] we gather we do so with the intention of
[1:19:10] freeing ourselves
[1:19:12] from the tight grip of heteronormative
[1:19:15] thinking
[1:19:16] or rather the belief that all in the
[1:19:18] world are heterosexual
[1:19:20] we cultivate an intergenerational and
[1:19:23] communal network
[1:19:25] free from this thinking notice you say
[1:19:28] brother matt what is this movement i'm
[1:19:29] going to tell you what this movement is
[1:19:31] this
[1:19:31] movement is a satanic movement
[1:19:35] that plays upon the suffering of people
[1:19:39] racism real absolutely is it suffering
[1:19:42] absolutely
[1:19:43] absolutely but what they've done is
[1:19:46] they've taken the suffering of some
[1:19:47] people and it's not about black lives
[1:19:50] right it's not about it it's not about
[1:19:52] progressing
[1:19:53] or helping the african-americans that's
[1:19:55] not what it's about at all it's agenda
[1:19:57] is a homosexual transgender agenda amen
[1:20:01] it's a guys listen to what brother
[1:20:04] branham says here and we're going to
[1:20:05] close here i know we're getting
[1:20:06] 8 25 now he says but god has provided a
[1:20:09] way that way of escape
[1:20:11] is jesus christ by being born
[1:20:14] again jesus says that there will be
[1:20:17] perilous times shall come men's hearts
[1:20:19] would fell for fear
[1:20:20] he said there would be distress between
[1:20:22] the nations roaring tidal waves that's
[1:20:24] never been heard of before
[1:20:25] bursting forth into the seas how then
[1:20:28] all these things signs would be coming
[1:20:29] to pass
[1:20:30] just like it was in the days of noah it
[1:20:32] would be again how marvelous just
[1:20:33] remember
[1:20:34] just remember the last plague that fell
[1:20:37] was
[1:20:37] death and the last thing
[1:20:40] god has given us a warning after warning
[1:20:43] after warning after warning
[1:20:45] now the last thing that's come is death
[1:20:48] spiritual
[1:20:49] death the churches are spiritually
[1:20:52] dying amen here they go you have the
[1:20:56] slide brother getting if you can display
[1:20:58] it i don't know where we're at on the
[1:20:59] slides let me make sure we're
[1:21:01] at the right space just press start from
[1:21:03] that slide oh you went from the
[1:21:04] beginning
[1:21:05] you have to go on down to it uh keep
[1:21:08] going
[1:21:08] yep keep going right there here they go
[1:21:11] moving down there one of the writers
[1:21:12] said now listen to what he begins to say
[1:21:14] and i'm gonna
[1:21:14] just turn a corner and then we'll we'll
[1:21:17] close
[1:21:18] because what jesus prophesies of this
[1:21:20] generation
[1:21:21] and the book of revelations chapter
[1:21:22] three is that this would be a lukewarm
[1:21:24] age
[1:21:26] it would be a lukewarm generation and he
[1:21:28] said there would be cut there would
[1:21:30] there would be a church that would
[1:21:32] evolve in the end time
[1:21:34] that the church notice not the heathen
[1:21:36] now but there would be a church
[1:21:38] that would evolve in the last days right
[1:21:40] before the coming of the lord
[1:21:42] that would boast it was rich boast it
[1:21:44] was growing
[1:21:45] boast it was increasing that it's
[1:21:47] self-sufficient
[1:21:50] a world a church world that has great
[1:21:52] influence
[1:21:54] in the world what we need today is a
[1:21:56] church
[1:21:57] with great influence let me tell you
[1:21:59] what jesus said of this church
[1:22:00] he said in this church who's rich and
[1:22:03] increased with goods they have need of
[1:22:04] nothing yet
[1:22:05] you're miserable poor wretched blind and
[1:22:07] naked and you don't even know it
[1:22:10] revelations 3 17 uh
[1:22:13] as as one evangelical was just reading
[1:22:16] the other day you know was praising
[1:22:19] donald trump and oh
[1:22:20] you know we we we're going to have godly
[1:22:22] leaders and we're gonna have godly godly
[1:22:24] president godly congress
[1:22:25] and we could just get those supreme
[1:22:26] court justices i thought you know
[1:22:28] i mean it's easy to get behind some of
[1:22:30] that and go yeah i really wish yeah oh
[1:22:32] boy it'd be
[1:22:33] it'd be so nice you know and that but
[1:22:35] they have this entire vision of
[1:22:37] of that that we're going to have this
[1:22:38] great christian that the the church
[1:22:41] world is going to have power again we're
[1:22:42] going to have influence again
[1:22:44] the church of god needs to rise up we
[1:22:46] need to protest we need to rise up we
[1:22:48] need to make a stand
[1:22:50] we we have our rights brother branham
[1:22:52] said a real christian lays down its
[1:22:55] rights
[1:22:57] we have our rights we we we're not going
[1:22:58] to be pushed upon we're not going to be
[1:23:00] pressured upon
[1:23:01] and this church this man was saying oh
[1:23:03] it's it's going to move into government
[1:23:05] we're going to have government positions
[1:23:06] and it's going to be in all of the
[1:23:08] greatest
[1:23:08] uh halls of finances and buildings and
[1:23:10] leaders of the world
[1:23:12] we're going to take over and we're going
[1:23:13] to we're going to have spirit-filled men
[1:23:15] passing laws and
[1:23:16] and doing away with abortion and doing
[1:23:18] away with pornography
[1:23:20] and crime and and all of this other
[1:23:21] thing and god's is going to raise up
[1:23:23] this great church
[1:23:24] and to take dominion and you know what
[1:23:26] it is it's a it's a
[1:23:27] it's a it's a false thinking a false
[1:23:30] dichotomy
[1:23:31] that says that of a kingdom of god on
[1:23:34] earth
[1:23:35] there's a kingdom of god on earth coming
[1:23:37] but it's not in this earth it's not in
[1:23:38] this
[1:23:39] this condition of this earth amen amen
[1:23:42] there will be no peace till jesus comes
[1:23:44] it's this thinking of this kingdom of
[1:23:46] god on earth that
[1:23:48] we're we're to better ourself even the
[1:23:50] church world has gotten behind this
[1:23:52] that that that it's that we're we're to
[1:23:54] have you know a righteous rule and
[1:23:57] and we're to all of the nations we're
[1:23:58] just joining together and we'll all be
[1:24:00] bound up and
[1:24:01] and all unified and they will it's
[1:24:04] prophesied they will
[1:24:09] and they want you know what they want
[1:24:10] this church wants power
[1:24:12] yeah now they don't want the kind of
[1:24:14] power you want they want political power
[1:24:17] i'm not looking for political power i'm
[1:24:19] not looking for political influence i'm
[1:24:21] looking for the power of this word to
[1:24:23] come alive
[1:24:25] in me and change me and change me at an
[1:24:28] atomic level
[1:24:29] at my atoms that changed me from this
[1:24:31] vile creature to a
[1:24:33] incorruptible they're looking for the
[1:24:35] power of politics i'm looking for the
[1:24:37] power of god
[1:24:39] they're looking for political influence
[1:24:40] i'm looking for spiritual influence upon
[1:24:43] my life
[1:24:45] god says this a ladies in church that
[1:24:47] you're lukewarm
[1:24:49] you're you're you're lukewarm you're
[1:24:51] you're you're not cold you're not hot
[1:24:53] and he says i'm gonna spew you
[1:24:55] out of my mouth they're destined
[1:24:58] for judgment destined for wrath
[1:25:02] he said brother matt does that mean that
[1:25:03] god just doesn't have anybody let me
[1:25:05] tell you something brother and sister
[1:25:06] god has a church that's not lukewarm
[1:25:09] that's not in spiritual lethargy that's
[1:25:12] not
[1:25:13] intoxicated with this world and its vain
[1:25:15] riches
[1:25:16] god has a people that is going to be
[1:25:18] existing
[1:25:19] in the final days before the rapture who
[1:25:22] is living holy

[1:25:53] oh they have spiritual discernment in
[1:25:55] the age of
[1:25:56] spiritual blindness
[1:26:00] you say brother matters this the church
[1:26:01] is supposed to be progressing and we're
[1:26:03] going to be
[1:26:04] busting out of the seams and all it's
[1:26:06] david said it this way in the rapture
[1:26:07] psalm
[1:26:09] in the time of trouble you'll hide me
[1:26:12] in the time of trouble you'll hide me in
[1:26:15] the cleft of the rock and the secret of
[1:26:17] your tabernacle
[1:26:19] it's going to be a time of trouble luke
[1:26:21] 21 12
[1:26:22] says and this is this is what jesus says
[1:26:24] he says they shall lay their hands on
[1:26:26] you
[1:26:26] and persecute you delivering you up to
[1:26:28] the synagogues and into prisons
[1:26:31] being brought before kings and rulers
[1:26:32] for my name's sake
[1:26:34] he goes on to say some of you shall be
[1:26:36] put to death you shall be hated of all
[1:26:38] men for my name's sake
[1:26:40] what did paul say in second timothy paul
[1:26:42] says all that live
[1:26:44] godly will suffer persecution amen
[1:26:48] all that live godly will suffer
[1:26:50] persecution
[1:26:52] uh woe unto you this is what jesus says
[1:26:54] woe unto you when men
[1:26:56] shall speak well for you for so did
[1:26:58] their fathers to the false
[1:27:00] prophets
[1:27:03] you say brother matt is what what is
[1:27:05] what does that mean that means that this
[1:27:07] elected group this elected
[1:27:10] people won't be a popular people right
[1:27:13] right
[1:27:14] we're gonna have political power and
[1:27:15] protesting out here in the street
[1:27:17] we don't live by the same we don't live
[1:27:19] by the same ideals of the church nominal
[1:27:21] world
[1:27:21] we don't think the same man we're not
[1:27:24] looking for social acceptance
[1:27:26] right in fact we're looking for the
[1:27:27] opposite to say when they speak if
[1:27:29] they're speaking woe unto you if they
[1:27:31] say good things about
[1:27:32] you right yeah so matt does that mean go
[1:27:35] ahead and cause trouble no
[1:27:36] shouldn't be causing trouble but let me
[1:27:39] just say it this way if you're
[1:27:40] if you're socially if you're able to be
[1:27:43] accepted
[1:27:44] and you believe the message of the hour
[1:27:45] and you're living the message of your
[1:27:47] generation

[1:27:49] preached the gospel it got him crucified

[1:27:52] tell you what it did to paul it got him
[1:27:53] beaten with stripes
[1:27:55] got his head cut off eventually yeah
