And uh she is just really suffering. The devil is attacked her. And uh with that flu bug going around, we don't know if it's the COVID flu, the non-COVID flu. Anyway, she's pretty sick and um and so she was asking to please ask you for extra prayer today.

And I'm also uh like to ask extended prayer for me. Amen. Uh for those of you who weren't able to be here, I took the Sunday school class today. Uh, brother Matthew is taking the Sunday regular service. I've got to um try to keep myself uh unexerted because these uh this shingles has now moved through its fourth week and it's still um bothering me to some degree. In fact, is it seems to be migrating now to the other side of my head. I don't know. I don't want to think about it. But um four weeks of medication have have have also kind of destroyed my system as it were and um suffering a lot and I've not got a lot of sleep over the last four weeks. Last night was a pretty bad night uh for sleep and um a lot of discomfort today. So your pastor needs your prayer. Amen.

Because he's already said I would. Amen. Hallelujah. So thankful for Amen. the spirit of the Lord. We [clears throat] know where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. And so we just uh are so grateful for that. Tonight, I want you to turn to Ephesians uh chapter 3. So grateful for that this morning, I should say. Beautiful morning. Amen. Lovely morning to serve the Lord, to worship the Lord. No other place I'd rather be than right here in the house of God with believers. Amen. I want you to turn to Ephesians chapter 3 if you have that uh PowerPoint. Also, um Brother Mark, I think I got that sent off right at the right uh time. Um, my typical time to send my PowerPoint is right before I walk out. So, Brother Mark says, "Not that one. Not that one. That's the wrong preacher." Ephesians chapter 3. While he's finding that, I sent that, I think, to the uh He's got it. Okay. Ephesians chapter 3. I want to preach to you this morning, and I'm got a very simple title. There's always more. That's my title. Let's just begin reading here at verse 7. This is Ephesians 3:7. Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of whose power? His power. By the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than who am less than the least of all saints. How many feel that way? Amen. Is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created all things by Jesus Christ. To the intent, let's look at verse 10. to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church, the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Now remember in Christ Jesus was not just all of God. We know that brother Brandham said that Jesus wasn't in the Godhead but the Godhead was in Jesus. That's a very big distinction. He wasn't part of a three-fold godhead, right? But he was the Godhead himself, all of the fullness of God. So he says according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. But we know that not just was it wasn't just God in flesh. It wasn't just deity, but you were in Christ. I was in Christ. So that means that the eternal purpose that God had didn't just have Christ in mind, but it also had you in mind because there's a people who are literally Mrs. Jesus Christ. So the conquering that God would do through Christ, he would ultimately do through his body, his wife, the the lamb's wife. We know that that's who overcomes the wicked one in this generation is Christ through the lamb's wife, the bride. Not notice here again verse 11. according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and I'm so grateful for this access with confidence that means we don't need to be sheepish about it we don't need to be shy or timid about it but you have access and you can be bold about that access not because of anything you did but the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and given you boldness to enter in notice he says for this in whom We have boldness and access and with confidence by faith of him. Wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man. Lord, we're so grateful for the reading of your word. Knowing, Lord Jesus, that today, Father, as we stand here, Lord, and that I'm here, Father, just right in the midst of all of those that are under the sound of my voice, Lord, I'm just right here. We're all, Father, as it were at your table, Lord. And your prophet said that even before the world began, before the earth began, that our bodies were laying there already in the earth. the material was already there, Lord. And your prophet said before you ever started spinning the first star, creating the first tree, causing the grass or the the Lord, the the flowers to bloom, that you already had our purpose and a vision for our life laying in the seed. Lord, we're so grateful for that. knowing, Lord, that you've brought us here for a specific time, Lord, to serve you in this generation, a wicked generation, a world that's dark, Lord. But in that darkness, there's a light in the evening time, Lord. And we have that light inside of our hearts. That's why we're here. We ask now, Lord, for you to come and take your word, Lord. How we need you this morning, to come and take your word, Father, and break it to our hearts. We're standing in great need, Lord, of you. In the allsufficient name of Jesus Christ, we ask these things. Amen. Amen. You can be seated this morning. I'm preaching to you today on a title. There's always more. I've could have named it there's more. Just this was the title the Lord gave me. But very quite simply, very simple title with a very simple message. There's always more. Brother Brandham says in a hidden life and I just want to use this as a keynote quote. Uh I listened to this message just two nights ago and and just feasted feasted on it. If you want a real good one, 1955, this message here, a hidden life, Brother Brandham says here, and I thought that when Martin Luther reached justification by faith, he thought that settled it. That was the light for his day. and he preached it and believed it and held on to it and it was the light of that day. Then he entered another veil, a man John Wesley when Calvinism began to sweep the nation and they settled down to saying, "What's God going to do? He will do and does us no good to have a revival." God raised up John Wesley and he certainly smashed Calvinism to the ground to the place where it ought to have its right balance under the works of sanctification, the second work of grace. In other words, the prophet is saying it was good that Martin Luther believed in the just shall live by faith. What Calvin believed and what God originally revealed was there was nothing wrong with that, but there was more coming. And so God said, 'I don't want you to settle down on just what Calvin, just what Luther brought of the just shall live by faith, but John Wesley raised up. And he says, and the Nazarines carried it on, and along come the Pentecostals, the next the baptism of the Holy Spirit, moving on up into higher heights. Remember, God's always going up. He's never staying here, and he's never going down. He's always moving up. The way God has is forward. He doesn't have a gear of neutral and he doesn't have a gear of reverse. I know we love we hate change. All of us here today, there would be almost no person you'd talk to who would say, "I like change." Because that's not part of human nature. Human nature loves things to stay the same. Now, of course, if your world is falling apart and your house is on fire, of course, you won't change. But when the when the going's good and and you you like people, what do we do? As creatures of of humanity, we we like to, you know, get all things in order, get our life in order, and we accomplish our dreams and our visions of what we planned. And then once we get somewhere just closely akin to what we called perfect, we like it to stay that way. We don't like change. None of us here like change. I don't like seeing people, my children grow up. I can't even look at the pictures of my children when they were small. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would relate and feel that way. Do you feel that way? You hate change. You want things to always stay just like they are. If they could just be just like this. But we've got to realize we're creatures that are moving. We're on the move. And there's always change. There's always God always has a gear and he's trying to move you forward. No, we don't like to hear that. I want the church the way that the church always was. If we could only go back to how it was yesterday. Listen friends, you can keep wishing for how it was yesterday and you'll miss what God is doing right now. That what God does in progression is always greater than anything he's done in the past because it's a further progression. So God says, notice Wesley comes along and it was a second work of grace. He's always moving up. He's moving up into higher heights. And he says, "And now when the brethren received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they said, "This is the summit." This is all of it. Now, this is brother Brandon referring to though when the baptism of the Holy Ghost was poured out on Pentecost. This was the restoration. It was another work of grace. And brother Brandham says Martin or Luther thought when justification came, this is it. This is all there is to it. This is all God wants to reveal. So what did he do? He preached it. He lived it. An entire generation of people gathered under that revelation of the just shall live by faith. They've made churches out of it. They made a doctrine out of it. They made an entire denomination around it. Notice what man always does is he likes to get some of God, settle with what God sends, create a denomination, and say, "We're the only ones who have it. This is it. If you want it, you got to get it here." And they put a period on God and [snorts] restrict the Holy Spirit from moving and bringing more. But you see, God always has more. He always has more. See, brother M, we received the message over the hour. Let me just tell you what we read in Ephesians 3. There's the uncarchable riches of God. Let me just say there's always more of God unfolding himself. Got a very simple just just right here, right now. Well, I just want to tell you I've got a very simple message today. So, don't wait for some big bang at the end. This is it. There's always more. God always has more for you. If you thought you were done growing, you're not. If you thought you were done receiving, you're not. If you thought that God was done developing, he's not. And until this body changes, there's an always an ever growing and ever increasing and everchanging. There's always a dying out and emptying out and a refilling. Brother Brandham says even when they received the Holy Ghost, they said, "This is the summit. This is all of it." As God opens the gate and swings out the welcome mat, Brother Brandham says here, I must have missed a a portion. Let me just read it from from uh from the table here because I I missed it. I want to make sure I get it. Brother Brandham says, "And now when the brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost," did I not get that? Uh moving on. Ah, my goodness, I didn't. I don't think I pasted it in. Let me try it again. Okay, let me go back. If not, you're just going to have to listen close. This is the summit of it. Yes, I've missed it. That's all right. He says, "This is the summit of it. This is all of it." I promise I wasn't trying to hide anything. He says, "But brethren, that's wrong." See, there's no summit to God's power. Amen. Amen. I want that just to stick here for a moment. There's no summit to God's power. No summit. In other words, you don't reach the height. One day we're traveling and then we reach it and then that's it. Then we settle down. He says there's no summit to God's power. We move on and on and on. It's the unlimited resources of God that has never been tapped yet. Blessings and powers that we know nothing about. It's never been even revealed to archangels. Is laying just ahead for his church that will believe. Amen. For eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither has it entered the hearts of man what God has for them in store that love him. I just want to preach to you today. There is no summit to the power of God. If you want more, there's more for you to receive. If there's a desire for more of God, then that means there must be more of God for you to have. If there's more, if there's a desire for more revelation than God has himself, he wants to reveal to you. There's no summit of it. There's power, untapped resources, blessings, and powers. It's never even been revealed. So, let's move on up. Brother says, "So, let's move on up and claim our rights as God opens the gate and swings out the welcome map. Let's move on up into deeper depths." and never notice here I've got it right here on the screen. Let's move into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves to organize ourselves and to get into a place where well we believe this and that's all. Let's believe this PLUS HOW MUCH MORE we can hear from God. I think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the Lord Jesus. And I say, "God, that's my motive of my heart to say, Lord, I'm never going to get to a place to where I colonize and camp down, but I'm going to say, if you've got more, Lord, then here's my cup. Fill it up." And he says, "Every man, TO RECEIVE ALL THAT YOU can from the hand of his bountiful mercies." That's my heart. That's my heart, too, brother Brandham. TO RECEIVE ALL OF HIS bountiful mercies. Notice, brother Madam says, "But brethren, that's wrong there. I have it. I knew that I had it and it was just out of order." That's okay. Brother says this, "And you must be born again." Notice because notice the prophet of God even types this in the in the countdown. And forgive me and bear with me just for a moment as I just take just a minute to maybe teach and lay a foundation here. Brother Manam even uses the countdown and he preaches that message multiple times. And he begins to talk about how that every time man made an achievement that it was it was something that man did in the natural that only signified something that God was doing in the spiritual. Is that right? And so brother man says uses the create the the the horse and buggy and he says when man uh you know discovered the horse and buggy it was a further power to do what to move to go forward to for transportation. And it was always God moving forward. And he said when when God when they discovered the horse and buggy, it was only representative of something God was doing in the supernatural. He uses the same thing to talk about the automobile. And he says when Henry Ford discovered the model T4 discovered the automobile and he says it was only representative that man was discovering something, God was allowing him to tap into an intellect or a knowledge. And that knowledge was only representative of God about to release a revelation. Remember, God doesn't work by information. God doesn't work by knowledge. That's what the devil works by. Hello, somebody. Are you here this morning? So God So the So God doesn't work by information. He works by revelation. There's a very very big difference between information and revelation. You can understand all the mysteries. You can understand all of the doctrines of the message and miss the person and then what good does it do you? Let me just ask you, what good would it do for me to understand all the mysteries from the beginning of the Bible? This Bible can become a brand new book intellectually and understand all of the mysteries of who the serpent seed was and what the Godhead was and what predestination was and what that there was no eternal hell and all of these wonderful truths. But friends, if at the end of all of that, it doesn't tell me who I am, then what good does it do? So when God reveals the word, IT'S TO REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. THAT YOU'RE connected to the mystery, that you're connected to the knowledge, that you're connected to the revelation. And so God wanted to reveal more. So what did he brother Brandon says? He would discover the automobile. AND HE SAID, "WHAT WAS THAT?" That was only a representation that God was unveiling himself or releasing a part of himself back to the body. And so John Wesley comes with sanctification. Brother Brandon moves beyond that and says then they discover the jet aircraft and they took off. He said about the time the Wright brothers there in North Carolina were discovering flight. And he says about the time they were coming off of the ground, there was a little group in in Isuza Street in California that were coming off of the ground spiritually. Hallelujah. And he says about the time go man's always achieved something, God's always typed it because he was ready to unleash or release something about himself to his church. You say, "Did Wesley have it all?" He certainly didn't. Did Luther have it all? He certainly didn't. DID PENTECOST HAVE IT ALL? THEY CERTAINLY DID. DIDN'T. I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT THEY HAD. WE DON'T DO AWAY WITH what they have. Brother Adam says, "Notice, one always added to the next one. IT NEVER TOOK AWAY." RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS. I didn't have time to put to read. I don't want to take the time. And he says, "Anytime God never takes away, he always adds to." I love that Jesus always multiplied. He never subtracted. He never took many and then He never took a lot and then made a few. He took just a couple and made many. He's always adding. He's always giving. He's always revealing. So, Brother Brandham says, "Notice." But notice each time that man discovered something, the material was always there. Hello. The material WHEN WHEN THEY DISCOVERED FLIGHT, GUESS WHAT? IN THE STONE AGES, FLIGHT WAS POSSIBLE. Brother Bham says even in the very beginning of creation, astronaut power was already available. Rocket power. Listen, they didn't come and create something. They took what was already there and mixed those together and then there was AN INVENTION. AND BROTHER BAM SAYS, WHAT DID Wesley do when he discovered sanctification? He didn't come up with some kind of new doctrine. He took the material that was already in the word, mixed the chemicals together, and he got SOMETHING FROM GOD. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "What did they do at Isuza Street?" They didn't come up with something new. THE POWER WAS ALWAYS THERE. AMEN. Imagine that the material was already in the earth. Amen. Brother says this, listen in our quote here and and you must be born again. Do you ever know the body that you're living in this morning was here 10,000 years BEFORE ONE SPECK of life ever laid on the earth? The body you're IN NOW, SOMEBODY RAISE THEIR HAND. Look at your hand. The body that you live in was here thousands of years ago. Amen. Now I'm just reading what a prophet said so you can you can choke if you want but I'll just I'll say I I believe it Lord when notice what he says here is when God had this old missile hanging out yonder turning AROUND THE SUN AND REVOLVING AROUND IT THIS WAY AND WAS CREATED IN THERE CALCIUM pod ash and petroleums and so forth he laid in his notice he says and so forth he had in his great mind then that you'd set at this table this morning when he was creating pod ash and petroleum and calcium and all these things so forth and he was revolving it rolling together. He had in his great mind you sitting at this table this morning. When a carpenter goes to build I love this right here. When a carpenter goes to build a house, how does he do? He lay out he lays out all of his lumber first. He's got in his mind just what he's going to build. Amen. God had before the world was ever had a speck of life in it. He had your body laying right there. Don't ever let the devil tell you that your body is his body. Your body belongs to the Lord. The Bible even says, "Don't you know, KNOW YOU NOT, YOUR BODY, your body is a temple, is the temple of the Holy Ghost." So, you know what you TELL THE DEVIL? YOU DON'T belong in the temple of God. This isn't your body. This isn't your mind. This isn't your mouth. I'm not going to lend my mouth to your spirit. This body belongs to the HOLY GHOST. YOU OUGHT to tell the devil when he comes knocking at your door with doubt in YOUR MIND AND SAY, "DOUBT doesn't belong here. Jesus lives here." And in Jesus, there's no doubt. There's only faith. When dark thoughts start to creep in your mind, you ought to say, "Satan, you don't belong here. This is a temple of the Holy Ghost purchased by the blood of God. And he said he had your body laying. If he didn't, where did it come from? That's the reason he's twisting and rolling and turning. He would have to have the sun this way and it make pot ash. You turn it back this way and it make calcium. He turn it back this way, it would make petroleum. And after the earth had been shaped and all of it laying there, just a bleached desert, never had life on it. Notice he does all of this work creating all of the spinning all of the we don't know we can only imagine in our mind we could dramatize it you can watch uh you know maybe the story of creation and and artists have tried to to put maybe some kind of imagination of what it was like when the volcanoes were erupting. Brother Brandham does a wonderful job uh at dramatizing that. But but here God makes all of creation and everything he's making. And notice he's not I hope you catch this here. HE'S MAKING ALL OF the creation with all of the materials. But notice he's making the pot ash for something. HE'S NOT making it for itself. HE'S MAKING THE CALCIUM FOR SOMEBODY, NOT FOR THE CALCIUM ITSELF. He's provisioning something for somebody. AND SO ANYTIME GOD IS WORKING, I hope you catch it here. The events and circumstances around you are not are not being controlled by the let me say this here today. The things that are happening in your life, God is using those things for you. And brother Brandham says he's making all of this. He's twist spinning and twisting it. AND NOTICE ALL OF THE all after he gets it ALL DONE AND ALL COMPLETED. It was a bleached desert. Never had life on it. Never was nothing called life. But all the material was laying there to make our bodies. Amen. It was all ready there. I that that stood out to me so much hearing brother Caleb on Wednesday night. I came in the back office and told him, "Lord just started pondering, putting this thought I'm preaching today on my heart." Brother Adam says, "All of the material to discover the automobile was already in the earth. It just took somebody with enough faith to not trust what he understands or sees." Because if he stayed there with what he had, he'd say, "This is all of it. I guess there's nothing more. I GUESS WE'LL WALK TO GET AROUND the earth. Oh, we'll ride donkeys or ride camels. Brother Bam says, "BUT IT TOOK SOMEBODY TO BREAK OUT of that thinking. IT TOOK SOMEBODY TO BREAK THOSE CHAINS AND SAY, "NO, this isn't ALL OF IT. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING GREATER. IT WASN'T IN HIS MIND YET. He hadn't discovered it yet. But the material was already [screaming] laying there. I'm just going to skip ahead and tell you today, the material for your body to change is already here. It's not something that's coming. IT'S ALREADY IN THE seed laying down inside of you. But it takes somebody to believe and have rapturing faith to say that this isn't all of it. There's got to be more. Brother says, "All the material was laying there to make our bodies." I can hear him say to the great Holy Spirit, "Go now. Go forth now and brood over the earth. Now we know the word brood is the mother like the like like h like like the hen her brood or to coup like a dove calling to its mate go brood over the earth. Wow. Then this great Holy Spirit went forth and spread forth his wings over the earth and began to brood for a purpose. And that was to bring forth something to project what God was. As I said the other night, which was first, a sinner or A SAVIOR? WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS ANYHOW? WHICH WAS FIRST, a healer or sickness? You get what BROTHER MAN I'M SAYING? THE HEALER WAS FIRST. THE SAVIOR WAS FIRST. SO IN ORDER FOR GOD TO BE A HEALER, he had to allow you to get sick. But remember the sickness that he gave you was only to manifest who he was. And he says now we know that he says he says a sinner or a savior. What about it anyhow? And he says HE SAYS WHAT ABOUT IT ANYHOW? I'm reading the head of you. I'm sorry. Didn't didn't skip ahead. I thought that I did. Which was first, a healer or sickness? So notice what brother Brandham says. This is what came first. Remember God always creates the atmosphere or the habitat or the ecosystem before he ever puts creation in the earth. Before he ever made the first star, he makes the firmament. Before he ever plants the first FLOWER OR PUTS THE FIRST BEAUTIFUL, you want to enjoy it. But God said before I can put that flower on the earth, I first have to create the conditions or the home or the dwelling place or the atmosphere for it to live in or else it can never live. SO WHAT WAS GOD'S PURPOSE? THE SOIL OR THE FLOWER? AMEN. I'LL ASK IT MORE SIMPLY. Was the flower created for the earth or was the earth created for the flower? Amen. You ask for the same question for the fish. God had in his mind the creation of a fish. But before he could ever create the fish, he first had to create the condition or the water or the atmosphere or the habitat. SO GOD BEFORE HE EVER BEFORE THE PROBLEM ever came, he already had the solution. Before the fish ever needed water, water was already here. BEFORE THE FLOWER EVER came to be, the earth and the soil with all the nutrients, God already had it in the earth. Notice it's the same exact thing with the with with all of creation that God made before he made the creation. He first created the atmosphere. And as long as the creation dwells in the material that God created for him, that was already here, that was already provisioned, then it'll blossom and it'll bloom. What do you do when you plant a flower in the ground? And that seed starts to take take life. You don't see anything at first, but after a while, that soil that was there begins to break up and you have just a little bit of what is it? It's life coming forth. But before the seed was the soil and if you don't have the soil, you don't have the seed coming to life. It remains a seed. So you say, "Brother Matt, what are you saying?" I'm saying exactly what a prophet said. It takes the atmosphere to do anything. Brother says, "If you want to have a healing service, you've got to get in the spirit of a healing service." Did you know he said that? If you want to have a revival, you've got to get in the spirit of a revival. Hello. If you want to have a healing service, you got to get in the spirit of it. Brother takes that further and he says, "In order for there to be a last days, the people have to first get in the spirit of the last days." Amen. So, you say, "Well, we know this is a certainty. There's going to be a last days. That's for ordained for for for that was predestinated in the back part of God's mind. There's going to be a last days. And so if there's going to be a last days, there's going to be a last day people. You say, why does God allow all the conditions of the world to take place? Man, if God is a loving God and God loves everybody, why wouldn't he uh, you know, just do WHY WOULDN'T HE STOP IT? WHY WOULDN'T HE STOP SOME of the hatred that we see? WHY WHY WOULD HE STOP SOME OF THE SOME of the problems we see in the world? You have to understand there has to be. Brother Adam says, in order for there to be a last day, there's got to be a last people fall in the spirit of the last days. You say, "Brother Matt, what are you saying?" I'm saying that in order for the insanity to come upon the world, people's got to go insane. That's why the that's why the the world is in the condition that it is. Because brother random said in order for there to be a last day, the people had to get into the last day spirit. In order for there TO BE A REVIVAL, the people have to get in THE SPIRIT OF REVIVAL. YOU SAY, "BROTHER MATT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?" In order for a word to come, there's got to be a PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THAT WORD. IN ORDER [screaming] FOR GOD TO UNVEIL HIMSELF, THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE WHO SAY, "UNVEIL YOURSELF TO ME, LORD." A HEART THAT'S OPEN. AMEN. And so, brother says, notice before there before there could ever be life that takes an atmosphere. Amen. What is in that atmosphere? Light. Takes light. Water takes water. It takes sunlight for that seed to come forth. You've got to get it in the right atmosphere. You can wish it. You can beg it. Put it in a closet. Put it in a dark room. Beg it. Wish it. plead over it, even pray over it, but until you get it in the right material that God provisioned for it, it will never come to life. Amen. Oh, I hope you're catching me here today. You can beg somebody to be a Christian. You could beg your children to serve the Lord. You could pressure them. You could prod them. You could push them. And I believe you should do everything you can to get them in the house of God. try to make um you know uh give them standards, hold rules, hold boundaries. But until the light in that atmosphere strikes that seed, IT'LL NEVER COME TO LIFE. YOU SAY, "THEN WHAT DO YOU NEED, BROTHER MATT?" YOU DON'T NEED PRESSURE. YOU DON'T NEED CRITICISM. YOU DON'T NEED TO TRY TO FORCE THEM. JUST GET THEM IN THE LIGHT. And if there's A SEED, THE LIGHT WILL COME FORTH. SO WHAT DO WE PRAY FOR? THE LIGHT OF THE REVELATION of God's word, the presence and the atmosphere of Jesus Christ. I SAID, "WHAT DO WE PRAY FOR? WHAT DO WE PREACH in our churches? WHAT DO WE WANT TO HAVE IN OUR ASSEMBLY? The presence of the sen to shine down on the seed that's in the earth." Amen. So God before he ever created that flower, he first creates the soil. And before he ever created the fish, he creates the water. And as long as the fish stays in the water, he breathes. But when you remove him from the from the material or the atmosphere or the condition in which God made him, he might breathe for a little while, but eventually those little gills will stop. You take that flower and you uproot it from the soil. You know, you put it in a pretty vase, put it in a glass, put it in the kitchen, RIGHT IN THE WINDOW SEAL, HAS WATER, brother Matt, it has the HAS THE WATER, IT HAS THE LIGHT. But let ME ASK YOU, SISTER, does those roses that that brother that your husband gets you on every every year for your anniversary, if you keep it in a pot and you keep it there, will it live forever? It won't live forever. Why? It wasn't made [screaming] to be in that atmosphere. AND IN THAT ATMOSPHERE, your atmosphere, and that atmosphere, it'll die. It'll wither. Amen. The blossoms, the petals will begin to fall. The leaves will begin to wither. Why? It wasn't created for that atmosphere. It was created for the soil that God made it for. You take the star out of the firmament and what do you have? A falling star. And you sit there at night and you watch it and it burns. You know, it wasn't created to do that. It was created to stay in the firmament, in its position, in its place, in its atmosphere. Listen to me, friends. He created the water for the fish. He created the soil for the flower. He creates the firmament for the stars. And what did he give for man? He gave him the material that he needed to live. Amen. The presence of Jesus, the presence of God. And as long as that seed gets in that atmosphere, he'll blossom. He'll bloom. He'll be what God created him to be. But when you remove man from that Eden, from that atmosphere, from that condition, from the material God made him for, then he becomes something God never intended for him to become. Amen. There's always there's I I love how brother Adam says this. Which was first, the healer or the sickness? The healer was which was first, the the the sinner or the savior? AND SO GOD ALREADY PUT THE MATERIAL THERE. The material was already laying there. Listen to what the prophet of God says in the message countdown. And I'm just going to read it. I don't have it here for you to read, but that's okay. I'm just going to read a couple just a couple quotes from it. If Wesley hadn't stepped out on the word and got a bad name behind him, was called a crazy man and everything else, he would have never been able to achieve. Amen. You say, "What did what did it take for Wesley?" It took Wesley to step out of what was norm. It took Wesley to make himself a spectacle. It took for Wesley to be called a crazy man. If he would have just stayed where he was, he would have never been able to achieve spiritual science. [snorts] Amen. That's what brother Brandham called it, spiritual scientist. He would have never been able to understand the mystery that God was wanting to reveal. But Wesley was one of God's great scientist. Luther was one of God's greatest scientists. Amen. They didn't care. WHY WERE they one of the greatest? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAID. They didn't care what anybody else thought. They didn't care what the rest of the church thought. Listen, until you stop caring about what everybody else thought, everything will just stay the same as it always was. It takes somebody to say, "I don't care what the rest of the world thinks. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE rest of the church thinks." Then God can do something for you. I don't care about my reputation. I don't care if people like me or dislike me. That's weird. You're right. You're weird. And anytime you're not, you're not what you're supposed to be. Hello. They didn't care what the church said. They didn't care. Listen, all those Roman Catholics, the Catholic Church, he didn't care. HE BELIEVED THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE TOOK GOD'S CHEMICALS OF THE word and put it together and the church moved by faith. Wesley, come along. What did he do? He put it together by the blood and proved it by the blood. And you know what happened? The church got sanctified. Amen. The Pentecostals believe that the promise, notice, believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the promise is to you and your children and them that's far off. And they put the chemicals together out of the word. So they didn't create something new. They didn't come up with something new. Man's always looking for his solution elsewhere. He never believes it's right in front of him. That's how we are. We always look for our answers somewhere else. I'm going to keep preaching and you guys can just be as quiet as you want. That's just fine. I'm just going to keep preaching. MAN ALWAYS LOOKS for his answers elsewhere. He misses the answer is right in front of him. The question that you're asking, it's already given. The problem, the thing that you think that YOU NEED THAT'S SOMEWHERE down the street, it's right here. And he says, WESLEY PUT IT TOGETHER AND HE SAYS he took the CHEMICALS OUT OF THE word and they moved up into the air. Hallelujah. They moved out because they were able to accomplish. Did you notice something? Every one of those achievements accompanied the other one, complimented the other one. It was only a higher form. So everything God wanted to give was right here waiting to be tapped into. Hallelujah. Not something coming, something already here. Praise God. You notice even when God pours out his spirit in the first early church, and I'm just going to take just a moment to to to to spend just some time here. So, just bear with me. If we pull that PowerPoint back up, I'm going to skip some of these uh down. We'll we'll get back to these. But listen to what Brother Brandham says here. Uh I have it. Yeah. Here. No, let me let me find it here. I've got it uh on my screen. It is here. Yes. And he says, "This is the identified Christ of all ages." So many people have different opinions of Christ. As I travel in different parts of the country and around the world, I find that so many people have their different opinions. You'd be surprised to know what some of their opinions are. I'm sure we would. Some of them thinks that he's just a wonderful teacher. Well, he was that. That's just exactly. Many of them thinks he was a great philosopher, which he was that. He certainly he was. Some of them think he was a good man. He was that. But see, he was more than that. HE WAS ALL OF THAT PLUS. Now notice, to miss any of him was to miss all of him. To miss any of him was to miss all of him. You could reach him and believe him as a GOOD TEACHER. BUT HE WAS A GOOD TEACHER. But if you only received HIM AS A GOOD TEACHER, YOU didn't receive any of him. You could believe he was a good man and he was a good man. But if you didn't believe all of him, you didn't receive any of him. Say the message of the hour is the power of God. It sure is. The message of the hour came to a came to a prophet. Uh I believe that with all of my heart. I believe he was Malachi 4. Listen friends, TO BELIEVE JUST PART of it, you miss all of it. Amen. Just to accept one part is to miss all of it. Notice brother Ram says he was all of that. He was a prophet. He was more than a prophet. He was the prophet. He was he was what the prophets was. Plus, how would we know now if he was teaching of his teachings? He was a teacher and he was a great philosopher. But the only way that we'll ever know today, if we wanted to identify him today, and I believe that he's raised from the dead, I believe that with all of my heart. I believe that he's promised here. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I am with thee always, and I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee. Now those words, they're either true or they're not true. So in other words, brother Brandham is saying either you believe that not only that he was, but also that he is. That's either true or that's not true. And if they're not true, then what are we doing here tonight? Right? We're wretched people. We're people that's well we're deceived. The whole Christian world is deceived. If he isn't the same yesterday, today, and forever. If he isn't alive tonight. I love this. And with us as he promised. Lo, I am with you always. Even at the consummation or the end of the world, I'm with you always. Now, if that isn't the truth, then there's something wrong. And we are found false witnesses. Not only are we making ourselves miserable under a false pretense, but we are deceiving others. We are found deceivers of something we're talking about. Oh my, this just hit home SO MUCH. EITHER [screaming] WE BELIEVE ALL OF IT or we believe none of it. EITHER WE ACCEPT ALL OF IT or we believe none of it. Brother Vam says, "If not, we're just false witnesses." And he says, "Under false pretense, we're found deceivers of something we're talking about, which isn't if he's just a myth. If he's just a myth, or he's just a historical, what good is a historical Christ if he isn't the same today?" I say, "AMEN." BROTHER BRANDON, WHAT GOOD IS THE GOD of Moses if he isn't the same God today? I say amen. What good does it do to take your canary bird and feed him vitamins to make him have PRETTY FEATHERS AND GOOD strong wings and then keep him in a cage? See, it doesn't do him any good. And we talk about how great God was and then don't say he's the same today. Then there's something wrong. We're caged up somewhere. And that's a false conception of what God is. Amen. We preached on it here just a little while ago. Man always never has trouble. There's no intellectual dilemma. There's no pride problems which always get in the way. There's no intellectual problems that get in the way when we put Christ yesterday in history. They never have an issue with that. Man never has a problem looking at a historical Jesus and saying, "I believe him with all of my heart as long as you seal him up, contain him up to my denomination and my church and MY PASTOR AND ALL OF RECEIVED." LISTEN, this is what they believe. Everything God wanted to say, he already said it in Christ. Everything he wanted to reveal, he revealed in his word. I believe every bit of that. But if if the Wright brothers had that same attitude, WE WOULDN'T HAVE airplanes today. The material was already there. But it took the stimulation of faith by revelation to make it live. They never have trouble accepting Jesus yesterday. Hello. They never have trouble accepting Jesus yesterday. But when you make him or tomorrow, Brother Brandon would go on to say that they never have trouble if YOU PUT THE PROMISE OFF TO SOME OTHER DAY. AMEN. But make him the God of today, the Jesus of today. And then I don't know about that. That's getting a That's getting a little bit weird. That's getting a little bit strange. I don't know about that. You people put so much on that prophet and you quote brother Brandham so much. You just quote quote and quote unquote. You put so much on that. I mean, I can accept the you long as you're Isn't it amazing? People have no the the the the critical spirit that wants to come into the message ranks has no problem as long as I'm quoting Jesus from yesterday. But when I quote Jesus from today and what Jesus said today, suddenly, oh, y'all are just saying that y'all are quoting that prophet way too much. All right, somebody. I ain't afraid of that spirit. I'll keep preaching. THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH SAYING HE WAS GOD OF YESTERDAY. But you put him today AND THEN SUDDENLY SUDDENLY WE DON'T WANT NO MORE. WE DON'T WANT NO. WE DON'T WANT THAT. DON'T PROGRESS ANYMORE. BUT LET ME JUST PREACH. THERE'S ALWAYS MORE. GOD ALWAYS WANTS TO GIVE MORE. HE WASN'T WANTING TO STAY IN CHRIST IN A MA A BABY IN a manger. So what DID HE DO? HE CAME AND PUT PUT HIMSELF IN A MAN. HE DIDN'T WANT TO STAY ON A CROSS. He wanted to come into a body of a person and speak through their lips. He wanted to live through a living church and a living bride. Anytime you put that God of today, then no, no, no. You know what? Just stop right there. We can't I don't don't don't want to go any further. Why can't we just accept what God did yesterday? You see what people want to do? They want to put Jesus as a Sunday school coloring book. And that's totally fine because you're coloring what he did yesterday. And I'm thankful for what he did yesterday. Amen. Amen. But you got to understand, church, there's more. THERE'S MORE. THERE'S MORE THAT GOD WANTS to reveal. AND I SAY, GOD, IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME MORE, THEN I JUST WANT to never stop. I never want to put a period. I never want to clog up the channels. I want to open them to say, "Give me more, Lord. Give me more. Jesus, I believe you came." Listen to me, FRIENDS. HE WAS, WHAT WAS HE? AND IN in the book of Revelations, he was THE MIGHTY ANGEL. THE SAME ONE THAT APPEARED to Abraham and Sarah. Do you realize that's the pre-incarnate Christ? That was the same one. Melzdc was this was was Christ in a prefigure. Amen. This this who who was this king of Salem? It was Christ. Amen. But you couldn't stop there. Amen. You couldn't stop there. Are you with me here this morning? He was going to give more. He was going to open himself more. He was He was going to reveal himself more. IN REVELATIONS 5, LISTEN TO WHAT IT SAYS HERE. AND I SAW IT IN the right hand. Revelations 5. If you have your Bible, turn there with me. We'll keep the PowerPoint up so we don't have to go back and forth. Notice what he says here. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written and within and on the back side. This is Revelations 5:1. I'm still hearing pages turned, so I'll just wait just a moment. Some of these young guys on the front. That's that's perfect. I want you to read it. So notice here. And I saw in the right hand him that sat on the throne a book written within AND ON THE BACKSIDE sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with A LOUD VOICE. WHO IS worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. So I want you TO NOTICE SOMETHING. REVELATIONS 5, THE BOOKS CLOSED. But what happens in Revelations 10 VERSE ONE? I SAW ANOTHER MIGHTY ANGEL COME down from heaven clothed with a cloud, rainbow upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, his feet as pillars of fire, and he had in his hand a little book open. So what's happened? Progression. There was more. Are you following me this morning? THERE WAS MORE. GOD WASN'T GOING TO STAY WITH A SEALED BOOK. He was going to open that book and in his hand a book, a little book opened and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. And he says here, notice this here. What does he what does he tell John? Is it going to stay there? Did it stay sealed? No. Did it stay in the in his hand? No. It was going to have to progress. Yeah, that book was going to go have to go from being closed to not just being open and going, "Thank God we got the open book." But now God, the angel says, "Now John, take the book." John says, "Give me the angel says take it and eat it. Consume it. FOR YOU MUST PROPHESY AGAIN." WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS SOMETHING FURTHER. IT WAS GOD UM FURTHER UNVEILING HIMSELF, FURTHER RELEASING HIMSELF, FURTHER UNVEILING HIMSELF TO HIS FAMILY. HE WASN'T DONE AT CALVARY. He wasn't done in a manger. He wasn't done when HE WAS CRUCIFIED. I'LL GO FURTHER AND SAY he wasn't done when he sent his spirit on the day of Pentecost in AD.33. THERE WAS MORE GOD wanted to do. And it and it required someone to step out and say, "I'm not going to settle with what I've received, but I want more. I want more." You say, "Brother Matt, is there more of God?" There certainly is. Amen. I want you to notice this here. We took this into Sunday school. I'm just going to It's 12:30 now. Can I have 10 12 more minutes? I'll make it 12. And then I'll ask for 12 more. No, I'm just kidding. No, I actually might, but we'll see. I want you to notice this here. We took this into Sunday school. This was after the spirit of God is poured out on the day of Pentecost. after they've received the the the gift of the Holy Ghost, after they're endued with power. WHAT DO YOU HAVE AFTER the Holy Ghost comes? You don't just have a people that's gathered up in buildings and synagogues opening the scroll and just studying the word and then the next they just study the word and then they study the word and then they read. Listen, study is good of the word, but there's got to be a manifestation of what you're studying. So, what do you have in the book of Acts church? You have a PEOPLE THAT WAS MOVING ON, THAT WAS PROGRESSING, THAT WAS OPEN TO MORE OF GOD. SO WHAT DID GOD DO? He sent power. He sent demonstration. He sent miracles. He spent He sent signs. He sent wonders TO A BODY. NOT JUST A WORD, not just an intellect, not just something you study. He sent himself back to the church. Amen. And when he unveiled himself, he was giving everything that he was. Hallelujah. Amen. Well, then surely, you know, brother Matt, after after the, you know, the death of the last apostle and, you know, at some point there's got to be an ending to this. At some point, it's got to be a completion to all of this. At some point, surely God had, you know, everything he accomplished, he he was certainly done. When Paul died, you know, when the last last apostle died, when John died, surely God was done. And then what they were to do, what the disciples, what all of the early church was to do was just to go backwards and go refer to everything Jesus said, refer to everything the that the apostles said, refer to everything that they have and and and just seal it up, close it up, stop it up, and say, "We've received it all. Now we just wait." Well, let's read if that's what they that's what they did. This is this is this is after the death of the last apostle. This is between AD55 and AD 160. This is Justin Martyr. This is right out of history. You don't have to you I didn't you you can go and Google this up for yourself if you want. Don't do it while you're in church, but you can do it after church. Justin Martyr AD 5155. FOR THE PROPHETICAL GIFTS remain with us even to the present time. Amen. Wait a minute. You mean the prophetical gifts didn't stop with John? You mean the You mean God wasn't done prophesying, speaking, moving, acting, revealing, unveiling? AMEN. HERE'S JUSTIN MARTYR 8155. THE prophetic grips are still in operation. Here's Irenus 8180. I want to just read this and it's small, but you read it with me. Those who are in his truth, his disciples receiving grace from him do in his name, read this with me, perform miracles. Amen. We read that wrong. Surely Ireneius said those who were in the B, those uh the last apostles and Paul, they performed miracles. No, no. Those disciples receiving grace from him doing in his name perform miracles so as to promote the welfare of other men according to the gift which each one has received from him. For some do certainly and TRULY DRIVE OUT DEVILS. AMEN. YOU MEAN ALL THE DEVIL DRIVING OUT DIDN'T STOP with the apostles? No, it didn't stop. We still need devils driven out today. Amen. Hello Yes. So that those who have been thus cleansed from evil spirits frequently both believe in Christ and join themselves to the church. Others have fornowledge of things to come. Amen. WHO'S HE TESTIFYING ABOUT? HIS CHURCH. AMEN. These are believers. OTHERS HAVE [screaming] FORNOWLEDGE. NOTICE THIS. OF THINGS TO COME. THEY see visions. Amen. Brother Matt, you still believe we can see visions? Well, if you believe the Bible, you believe there's still visions. In fact, the prophecy of Joel was that your young men, your old men will young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams. Is that the word? Notice here, see visions AND UTTER PROPHETIC EXPRESSIONS. OTHERS STILL, you would think that Irene was writing this because he knew there'd be gains coming down the road. And so he wrote it just to make sure you understood. If you can get a picture, if you could go back in a time machine and you were to go back to that f first early church and say, "What do they look like? What did they believe? What what what did they practice? What did church look like for them? What did the church look like for Ireneius?" Well, we're reading about it here. There were people WITH VISIONS, MIRACLES, DRIVING OUT DEVILS, PROPHETIC EXPRESSIONS. Others still heal the sick by laying their hands upon them, and they are made whole. Amen. Yay. Moreover, as I have said, the dead even have been raised up and remained among us for many years. And shall I more say? Yes, please do, brother. Is it not possible? It is not possible to name the number of gifts which the church scattered through the whole world has received from God in the name of Jesus Christ who was crucified under Pontis Pilate and which she exerts day by day for the benefit of the Gentiles. Neither practicing deception upon any nor taking any reward from them on account of such miraculous interpositions. For as she has received freely from God, freely also does she minister to others. Amen. For this reason does the apostle declare, "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect." Preach, brother Irene. NOW HE'S QUOTING PAUL. THIS IS THE REASON THAT PAUL SAID, "WE speak wisdom among them that ARE PERFECT." TERMING THOSE PERSONS PERFECT who have received THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND WHO THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF GOD DO speak in all languages as he used himself also to speak and like manner we do also hear many brethren in the church who possess prophetic gifts and who through the spirit speak all kinds of languages and bring to light for the gen general benefit of the hidden things of men and declare the mysteries of God whom also the apostles term spiritual they being spiritual because they partake of the spirit. Amen. They don't just partake of the written word. They partake of the spirit. I know some of you are asleep. Pinch yourself here just for a moment. THEY DON'T JUST READ. THEY DON'T JUST HEAR. They do. Oh, I just say, GOD, DON'T JUST LET ME BE A HEARER. Let me be a doer of the word. I want to partake. I want to partake. I don't just want to stop and hear and listen. It's wonderful. But I want to partake of that living, breathing spirit that wants to move worse than I want him to move. That wants to speak more than I want him to use my vessel to speak. Notice this is tiring. I got got a few of these. Just read along with me. Let Marcy on exhibit this is 8208. What are we doing? We're moving just a little bit further. Surely after I brother Matt had to stop then. Well, let's keep going. Let Marcy and exhibit gifts as as gifts of his God. Some prophets, some as such have not spoken by human sense, but with the spirit of God, such as hath both predicted things to come, and have made manifest the secrets of the heart. Let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer. Do you know what Turion's doing? He's mocking Marcion, who was declaring that Jesus, EVERYTHING JESUS WANTED TO SAY, he said. Everything he wanted to do, he did. There's no more gifts. There's no more signs. There's no more wonders. There's nothing ELSE MORE TO GIVE. AND AND WE are the true church. You know what? You know what uh Tertian does? He says, "Okay, if you're the true church, if you're the true church like you say you are, then produce a vision. Produce a prophecy. GO AHEAD. LET HIM produce a psalm. Only let it be by the spirit and an ecstasy that is in rapture whenever an interpretations interpretation of tongues has occurred to him. Let him show to me also that any woman of boastful tongue in his community has ever prophesied from among those specially holy sisters of his." He's being VERY SARCASTIC HERE. NOW ALL THESE THINGS OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO produce are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty. [laughter] Right? Would you have the boldness to say that? Wow. And they agree too with the rules and the dispensations and the instructions of the creator. Therefore, without doubt, the Christ and the spirit and the apostle belong severally to my God. Here's origin of Alex Alexandria. We have to say this is AD 248. Let's go a little bit further away from the Bible times. Let's go A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE ROAD. We have more. We have to say moreover that the gospel has demonstration of its own. I believe that you don't need to fabricate it. You don't need to manufacture it. The gospel HAS DEMONSTRATION OF ITS OWN. All you got to do is believe it, preach it, live it. God will manifest himself. It has a demonstration of its own more divine than any est than than any established by Grecian dialects. And this diver method is called by the apostle the manifestation of the spirit and of power of the spirit on account of the prophecies which are sufficient to produce faith. and anyone who reads them, especially in those things which relate to Christ AND OF POWER, BECAUSE of the signs and wonders which we must believe to have been performed both on many other grounds and on this that traces of them are still preserved among those who regulate their lives by the precepts of precepts of the gospel. They are still preserved among those who regulate their lives by the precepts of the gospel. And there are still preserved among Christians traces of that holy spirit dove. They expel evil spirits and perform many cures and foresee certain events according to the will of the logos. Amen. And in the name of Jesus, they didn't change that name. Hallelujah. Didn't come as some other man, some other messenger, some other person, but in the name of Jesus. You see, as long as you got the name of Jesus, you still got the same Holy Ghost. If you got the same Holy Ghost, you got the same power. Brother Brandham said, "If God ever did anything in the word and you find it written in the word and you meet him on the same basis of faith, he'll have to do the same thing he did for them." He's no respector of persons. IF YOU NEED HEALING, YOU MEET GOD ON THE SAME BASIS OF FAITH. And God's required to do it for you, too. And he says THEY EXPEL DEMONS, TAKE AWAY DISEASES, produce marvelous meekness of spirit. WHAT? WHERE DID THAT come from? That was a curveball out of left field. We're talking about casting out demons and healing PEOPLE AND HAVING PROPHECIES AND VISIONS and meekness of spirit. Amen. Amen. And complete I love that complete change of character. Amen. And a humanity and goodness and gentleness. And those individuals who do fain themselves to be Christian. And some evid some give evidence of their having received through this faith a marvelous power by the cures which they performed revoking no other name over those who need their help than that of the God of all things and of Jesus along with the mention of his history. For by these means we too have seen many persons freed from grievous calamities and from distractions. Did Jesus stop setting people free at the death of the last apostle? I SAY, "NO, THERE'S STILL FREEDOM IN CHRIST JESUS. THERE'S STILL FREEDOM FROM DEPRESSION." I SAID, "THERE'S STILL FREEDOM FROM ADDICTIONS. THERE'S STILL FREEDOM IN JESUS." You don't have to be bound. There's freedom. Freed from grievous calamities and from distractions of mind. There's a lot of distractions. Boy, we got them. We got We got distractions everywhere. Distractions and notifications and push notifications. See, people can't even sit in church anymore without being on their phone. I watch people almost all service just texting away, try typing away. Don't you realize that's a spirit of the devil trying to keep you, NOT FROM BROTHER MATT. HE'S TRYING TO keep you from the Holy Spirit to give you the answer you need. OH FRIENDS, WE OUGHT TO SHAKE OURSEL TODAY AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT MORE. I DON'T WANT TO STOP. I DON'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTED. I DON'T WANT TO BE UH CONFUSED. I want to be clear of mine. I want to be available and ready when you go to speak to me, Lord. So the same God who delivered from distractions in that day, we believe in the same God today. Hallelujah. AMEN. DISTRACTIONS OF MIND and madness. Boy, they had it then. Boy, do we have it now. And countless other ills which could be cured neither by men nor devils. God desired to commend. I love this. God desired to commend the doctrine of Jesus as a doctrine which was to save mankind. And let me say when Jesus saves from one, he saves from all. You need saved today not just of your soul, you need saved of yourself, your mind, your evil, your your corruption. And when Jesus saves, he saves all. Amen. As a doctrine which was to save mankind, which was based indeed upon the apostles as foundations of the rising edifice of Christianity, but which increased in magnitude also in the succeeding ages. My brothers and sisters, if a man in 248 a believed that God was going to increase in magnitude, then we ought we surely OUGHT NOT TO STOP HIM NOW. WE OUGHT TO SAY, "GOD, INCREASE IN MAGNITUDE, increase in power, increase in love, increase in hope, increase in meekness, INCREASE IN GIFTS, INCREASE IN SIGNS." LORD, the increase in magnitude also in the succeeding ages in which not a few cures are wrought in the name of Jesus and certain other manifestations of no small moment have taken place. I got a few more. Martin. I you realize I'm reading you not just not just these men of history. These are church age messengers. He read Ireneius. Here's Martin of Tors. Notice this here. Three times the dead were raised in Martin's ministry. Wow. Three times. Amen. You mean Jesus didn't wasn't the only one who raised the dead? No. Paul raised the dead. His disciples the apostles raised the dead. and his church after him still had the power to raise the dead. Amen. Surely that had to stop. Well, we read about it here. It didn't stop. THREE TIMES WHILE ST. MARTIN WAS TRAVELING AWAY TRAVELING for three days. THE UNBAPTIZED CATECHUMAN CAME DOWN with a high fever and died. His body lay lifeless in one of the cells awaiting burial. Martin stretched himself at full length on the dead limbs of his departed brother. After he had stayed lying there sometime in prayer, he and had become aware through the spirit that the power of God was present, he rose up for a short time and fixing his gaze on the dead man's face. He waited with confidence for the result of his prayer and the mercy of the Lord. And after scarcely two hours had passed, he saw the dead man begin to move, all his limbs little by little, and his eyes trembling and blinking as he recovered sight. GALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WHAT KIND OF GOD IS THAT?" THAT'S THE GOD YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO TODAY. THAT'S THE GOD THAT'S BEEN RESTORED TO THIS PEOPLE THAT'S IN THIS CHURCH RIGHT NOW. OH, FRIENDS, do you believe IT THIS MORNING? THIS IS THE KIND OF GOD WE SERVE. AMEN. There's more. There's always more. Amen. St. Columba. Okay, let's go to another messenger. Columba is remembered as a missionary and a miracle worker. Below is just an excerpt of miracles in his life. Brother Matt, where are you getting these things? The BBC. There there's my citation for my source. Oh, you must have found this somewhere. You know, some old crazy quack wrote this. No, this is the BBC. This is history. Wherever Columba went, he shared his mystical insights and spiritual visions, introduced the good news of the gospel to pagans and offered pastoral counseling. According to Adaman, he performed miracles too, healing the sick, killing a boar of amazing size merely com by COMMANDING IT TO DIE WHERE YOU ARE. [laughter] You imagine this is right out of the BBC. COLUMBA TELLS A BOORE DIE WHERE YOU ARE. You see it doesn't take any magical hocus pocus phrase and they got to come up with this special prayer. Man, he was just as plain and straight just as he could be. As simple as HE CAN BE. DIE WHERE YOU ARE DRAWING WATER FROM a stone. This is Cola. Amen. DID COLUMBA BELIEVE IN MIRACLES? DRAWING WATER FROM A STONE, TUSTLING successfully with pagan wizards. ONCE THE SAINT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A BRIGHT column of fiery light, like the pillar of fire. Hold on a minute. You mean another church age messenger had a column of light like the pillar of fire appear over his ministry? Wow. You know what that was doing when that pillar of fire appeared over the prophet's head? It was signifying this ain't his message. This is my message. These are not his words. These are my words. Amen. YOU SAY, "WHAT DID THAT PILLAR OF FIRE DO?" IT VINDICATED AND BACKED UP WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. ACCOMPANIED BY A BRIGHT COLUMN OF FIERY LIGHT LIKE THE PILLAR OF FIRE that preceded the Israelites in the book of Exodus. And if that wasn't protection enough, he could call upon the support of holy angels. Go a little bit further. Cyro of Jerusalem. We just read AD. This is that was AD 606. Let's go a little bit closer. AD350. Notice this here. AND THOUGH HE'S ONE IN NATURE, yet many are the virtues by which the will of God in the name of Christ. I had this out of order, but that's all right. For he employs the tongue of one man for wisdom, the soul of another he enlightens by prophecy. To another he gives power to drive away devils. to another he gives to interpret THE DIVINE SCRIPTURES. HERE'S Austinine of Hippo. In his book, CITY OF GOD, AUGUSTINE dedicates an entire chapter to the continuation of miracles. indignant at the suggestion that they ceased with the apostles. He claimed to have witnessed a number himself and list an extraordinary range of healings from blindness, rectal vestula, breast cancer, gout, paralysis, hernia, demonization, and even death. Amen. Say, brother Matt, what does that mean? It means God wanted to give more and more and more. Brother Brandon would say it this way. baptism after baptism after baptism after baptism. Pouring out after pouring out after pouring out, refilling after refilling after refilling. You say, "Brother Matt, what does that mean?" That means we have the witness. We have the witness of Justin, Ireanius, Tertion, Origin. I didn't even read some of these. Espicius. This is men that I didn't even I didn't even put what what I didn't have time. Basil, Syral of Augustine. We have a massive spread chronologically from the mid 2nd century to the early fifth century that shows a charismatic church of visions, tongues, interpretation of tongues, healings, miracles, and geographically all the way from the far east to the far west of the empire and north and south of the Mediterranean. Brother Random says in the Sardisian church age now Paul had baptized in Jesus' name and rebaptized where people had not been so immersed. He set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came. How many accept the words of God's vindicated prophet? Now this is your messenger speaking that they were to remain in the church until Jesus came. Thus the next messengers, all the remaining six would be by the would by the same Holy Ghost burn with the same fire and give the same light of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the signs would follow them. Amen. Amen. Did I Did Irenas qualify? Yes. Did Martin? Yes. Say it with him. Did Columba Amen. DID WESLEY? Oh yes. He had a great ministry. Even prayed for his horse to get well. And it did. There you are. Seven church ages and seven messengers who were alike. And Paul pronounced a curse on anyone who said he was a messenger but had a different gospel and lived in a different light. God was not done. Amen. When he sent Jesus, God was not done when he sent the Holy Ghost. Let me propose to you, God was not done when he sent brother Brandham in a message. He's still working. He's still moving. He still wants to speak. And I just want to raise my hands. How many could stand to their feet, raise their hand, and say, "Lord, if there's more, I want to raise a hand today and say, I want more." Lord, you see the hands that are up all over this building. I raise both of mine up right now. Lord Jesus, we read about it. Father, a church moving, a church operating, a church acting. Lord, they weren't just stagnant and stale, but it was a dynamic church. Lord, the witness that we have is from every age, every man, Lord, that would believe and preach the same gospel. Your prophet said, would get the same result. So today Lord, we stand upon the same faith. We stand upon the same promise and we say, "Lord, whatsoever we raise hands now. We represent our needs that we have. Maybe the needs of somebody else in this body, in this church, maybe somewhere in another state. I represent those needs by an uplifted hand. And I say, "Oh God, you're the same miracle worker today. You're a light in the darkness. You heal the sick. You even raise the dead, oh God. And if my loved ones are dead in sins and trespasses, I believe in a God who raises the dead. They might be at home, not even here in this church today, but don't you ever let the devil get tell you that God is done moving. I want to preach to you today, and I want to tell you and encourage you, God's not done. He'll never stop. He'll never be done. He'll continue to move so long as you give him a a freeway for him to walk down. Hallelujah. I want to say, Lord, I lift my hands up and I say, God, I give you access. I give you passage. I give you the right of way, Holy Spirit. There's more. Amen. And I want more. There's more of God. Oh, and I want more of God. I know it's a simple sermon, every head bowed, every eye closed. Wonder if there'd be a hand that would just go up and simple faith would just say that I want more of God. I want more. I believe that if I want more, there is more. I want more, [music] Lord. Yes, Jesus. Yes, Lord. I love how Brother Brandham says this. Every head doubt ever I close. I'm just going to read you something. Felt led. The Lord has put it upon my heart. Brother Brandham's speaking about this even when he's talking about the gift of tongues. And he says, "Now, let me just not get away from that now because I don't want to dishonor a great gift that God has given. I believe that a spiritfilled man or woman or a child that lives under the altar of God won't live there long until they'll be speaking with tongues. I believe he'll do it." Now, you can receive the Holy Ghost and maybe you didn't speak with tongues when you get it. But if you constantly lay before God all the time with baptism after baptism. Oh, I just want to stop right there and raise my hand and say, "Lord, give me baptism after baptism. I might have had it yesterday, but I need it again today." Lord, my family might have had a real revival breakout, but oh, we need it once more. Lord Jesus, I'm not going to settle for what you did yesterday. I could stand here all afternoon and testify about God who moved yesterday. But I want to say, God, I want a baptism of after baptism striking my heart. And he says, if you get baptism after baptism striking you, something's going to take place. You'll get so full someday till you can't talk nothing else. You try to say something, you can't say it no more, and you just can't say. Many times if people realized that there was the Holy Spirit, they'd go ahead and just open their heart up and let God speak to them. I want to ask you, brethren, have you ever felt the Holy Ghost shake you so bad till you just couldn't hardly say nothing? Would just sit quiet sometimes, just sit there and cry? Have you did that? Well, that's the Holy Ghost. The reason people don't speak with tongues many times, they don't know how to yield themselves to the spirit. They're looking for something way off when it's right on them. That's the reason they don't. Then sometimes people just gets theirel worked up in emotion and say a bunch of words has no meaning to it. Still ain't got the Holy Ghost to try to say that because they try to say that they have because they spoke in tongues. But by Jesus said by their fruits they shall know them. I just want to raise a hand and say Lord let me learn to yield myself to you. If it's to yield myself in love. If it's to yield myself in humility then let it be Lord. If it's to yield myself to speak in tongues, then let me yield myself, Lord. If it's to yield myself for a vision, Lord, for you to speak to me by a dream. I DON'T WANT TO CLOSE MYSELF OFF UP, JESUS. I want to open myself right now. If I've left you up in the past, God, I want to bring you out of the past. I want to bring you to present day right now. You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're still the need meter. We're still believers. We believe in your word, Lord. We accept your word that was spoken by a vindicated [music] prophet. We don't question it. We don't just accept some of it or else we'll lose all of it. We accept it all with open heart, with open minds. Lord, we accept it. Jesus, your spirit, Lord, I feel it even here this morning so badly wanting to press. Let us not restrict you, Lord. Let us not hinder you. Let us have a spirit that says have freedom. Oh, could this church just pray that and raise a hand and say, "Lord, I wanna I want to go ahead and show whose side I own, whose side I'm on." I want to raise a hand and say, "Let the Holy Spirit have freedom. Let it have freedom in this assembly. LET IT HAVE IT. FREEDOM IN MY HOME. I want to give you freedom in my mind, freedom in my body. I don't want to restrict you, Lord. Don't let any idea tradition of man get in the way and restrict your spirit from moving. We want to be open to the Holy Ghost. He's the Joshua. He's the leader of the church. And we yield oursel to him right now, Lord Jesus. We yield oursel to him. This is my desire to honor you. Lord, with all my heart [singing] I worship you. All I have [music] and all I have within me. [music] [music] [music] Lord, I give [music] you my heart. [singing] I give you my soul. [music] I live for [singing] you, Lord.
