amen and we'll sing it through one more time I wanted to make sure you knew it good amen happy to have brother Andrew Coffey here with us today amen so we're happy to have him brother Barry's eldest son amen happy to have him you were he's working in Savannah and so came through to be in service with us today amen see other visitors Evelyn good to see you again some sisters in the back brother God bless you happy to have you here today all the different ones of you amen young lady happy to have you again praise the Lord so we're happy to have everyone in the house of God today I'm sure I'm missing someone but just know that you're loved and appreciated amen Rosie feeling better honey so I've been praying for you so we've got a couple of prayer requests here amen um sister Phyllis writes in with two prayer requests but she gives us some some testimony first she says good morning she says first of all I want to give a praise report I think that's so scriptural because Paul said first I thank my God he says he says good says good morning first I want to give a praise report from my last prayer request for Hope's friend sister Joanne who is a believer in San Diego and if you'd hear the supernatural way hope met this lady it's it'll blow your mind she immediately and she's elderly I'm guessing probably up in years and I don't know the exact age but she said she immediately started improving and is home and well and on her way to a complete recovery from a full stroke amen hallelujah [Music] [Applause] also the job that we prayed about for Richard he has started and so she says I have two more requests so she's on a roll hey man my sister Jackie from Florida requested the church pray for her son Jonathan who suffers from alcoholism my sister Bridget asked for prayer for her ex-son-in-law Billy he's suffering from symptoms dropping things Etc and the doctors are sending him for an MRI to find out what's going on thank you and God is good amen we agree God is good how many be remembering those two requests amen that God will continue to move we've had a a number of people sick and we came back from camp and the devil tried to exact Revenge but I just I just constantly tell him you ain't nobody Satan you don't make no decisions about my life you don't run nothing in my life you don't run nothing but your mouth amen and I don't live by the mercies of Lucifer do we know we live by the mercies of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord what'd you decide brother Jack oh no I tried to give it back to him he's going to give it back to me so uh so you know the uh the testimonies that sister Gene has been doing and uh by the way we've I've gotten so many requests from around the world I don't think sister Gene knew how far and wide her testimonies have gone and Everywhere I Go people are asking me and emailing me and when is Sister Gene going to get to do part three when is she going to do part three amen so she's uh working on that and brother Jack has one that he's wanting to do and I want him to do it it is it is power packed amen of course it doesn't have to be that power it could be a common story but hearing brother Jack tell it amen it'll be power packed but trust me this one is this one is power packed with God moving and so we wanted to do it today at four o'clock but me in all of my travel and hustle and bustling I didn't let you know about it so I said to brother Jack I can let the church know today and we can do it at four and I think he has friends here who are who are here to actually hear it today but we might take advantage of that and make them come back next week and and that way I can announce it from the pulpit and I love to have all the senior youth group there and say why brother Jason why does he use because I want you to know that he lives that Christ is powerful and this is not a myth it's not a story this is not just some movement this is the Living God Among Us today that this is a restoration that's what the restoration brings it brings back the book of Acts so we're this isn't this is more than just some doctrinal movement that we're in this is the restoration of the Bright Tree to perfect her for a flight home and I want you to I want you to hear that in the 21st century God is still on the scene moving for his people amen and so uh hopefully uh brother Jack my my my if I go 51 to 49 for next Sunday it's a real close one for me because I really wanted I've done I hear part of it but I want to hear the rest of it and so maybe that and some of it's in development right now so will you keep praying for brother Jack Amen the devil trying to trying to move behind the scenes but every time the devil sticks his head up God it's like the holy spirit is like whack-a-mold is waxing every time he pops his head a bow and he's uh you'd think the devil would finally get discouraged and leave brother Jack alone but amen if he wants to take a beat and the Lord will be she uh be sure to give him one amen so amen I think that's the way we'll go brother Jack so next Sunday you all heard it here first next Sunday at four we want to have brother Jack do that and as soon as sister Gene gets hers ready we're gonna get her to come forward also God bless you I want to sing this song again this meant a lot to me when I heard it and um I'm trusting the Lord for the service today but I want to have this mindset as we go in from the top again sister Dev give me those words G now let's just enter in get your hearts and Minds ready to receive the word oh my the Lord's got a wonderful word for us today amen hide me now [Music] think about this now all that great Jehovah [Music] hide a slope cover us Lord world falling apart but hide us Lord no matter what comes lift your voice as friends lift it up now I will soar with you above [Music] [Applause] [Music] find rest my eyes [Music] and there's where you find it friends [Music] [Music] [Music] when the Oceans Rise Again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] with you [Music] our King today [Music] I know you God [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen thank you sister Deborah God bless you we're going to invite you to the book of Acts this morning chapter 7. happy to have you here in the camp of the king amen praise the Lord amen amen I was up early this morning earlier than normal actually the last two mornings up a little earlier than normal and just looking to the Lord and the Lord seemed to move on me last several days in an in a rather unusual way and I found out why this morning I want to take a title if this was Resurrection morning amen I was astonished to hear Brother Brad and I don't know if him seeing my title put the seed in his heart or or the Holy Spirit anointing him to encourage me but one of the last lines of his Sunday school was I want this to be Resurrection morning oh my come back in my office and I said get out of my office get I don't want to talk to you go away get away you don't even we're not even going to take a chance here leave bye hahaha amen so that's the way the anointing works when it hits a preacher you have to be careful amen because it's just it's all one channel and a preacher with a gift will step in it and and Away you go and send you back to the drawing board amen so praise the Lord sometimes I wonder if I need to put a trap door here so that I can push a button and just disappear I preacher if he starts getting into my territory praise the Lord amen amen amen move the move the tank forward and baptize him again or something amen praise the Lord what if this morning was Resurrection morning my Prophet talked about between six and nine in the morning I was up early this morning thinking along those lines Acts chapter 7 verse 44 would catch 44 through 56. Stephen in his um indictment of of his own countrymen this is his indictment sermon Peter had already preached his indictment sermon in Acts 2 and here's Stephen uh with his our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drove out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob Solomon built him a house now how many know Jesus was that house every Tabernacle in the wilderness they built was all in type of Jesus Christ the entire Book of Leviticus in fact is I have often called The Book of Leviticus the the gospels of the Old Testament because it it covers all the things that you read in the gospels in manifestation it was in type in The Book of Leviticus because it was the priesthood of Christ and so we find here that he says Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things now watch this turn here you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye to always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom you had of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers now Stephen had him dead to rights they knew this was true no one could deny it see they're they're they're they're they're they're so offended they can't defend themselves so they execute the the man bringing them the messenger that's bringing them the truth he says verse 53 who have received the law by the dispensation of angels and have not kept it see when they heard these things they didn't repent when they heard these things they didn't own it sometimes you just need to own the word sometimes you just need to raise up your hands in the universal sign of surrender and say Amen or old me or oh my or help me God amen but whatever you do don't resist it your life is on the line your life is on the line and even if even if it were even if you're sealed into the Holy Spirit and your life to come is not on the line which it wouldn't be because Saint John 5 24 you've passed from Death to life but while you're still living here your life and what happens to you on this side is on the line don't resist the word of God just say amen and own it see when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and here's here's the difference between a Believer and an unbeliever we get cut to the heart they gnashed on him with their teeth so that's a big difference from raising your hands and saying Amen to the word but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up and looked up steadfastly into heaven let me tell you something that is the reward of every Minister who stands In a Pulpit and the people are resisting what he's saying it doesn't matter he can still see the Holy Spirit he can still look up if the people turn red in the face and get mad he can just look up because he knows he's in the path of the Holy Spirit he looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God let's pray father we thank you for your word and for the preacher anointing that I feel now help me to be studious Lord as I go through I I I have a great burden on my heart but yet I also want to lay the enough Foundation Lord that it becomes effectual to the people I commit it to you to this end that you will accomplish it Lord I am here just as your servant just as your assistant I give it to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you friends you can be seated foreign if I were to begin I could begin if I were to begin with something familiar to you we would go to Revelation chapter 10 which is very familiar probably exceptionally familiar to members of the of the message of the hour we we realize what it means to us I hope we do and and we see that that that that that when chapter 10 when the events of chapter 10 which are a seventh age messenger standing on the earth a mighty Angel which is Christ descending down with now a book that is open because he opened it the lamb opened it and he brings it to his seventh Church age messenger who then gives it to the people and then the people take the book and eat the book and become the book amen and when all of that is accomplished the last visible sign that you see and it's a visible one that it's not just spiritual it's not just spiritual the last visible sign you see of this bride before Moses and Elijah go to the Jews in 11 verse 2 in verse 1 you find that the the inside of the of the of the temple is being measured not the outside the outside is left to the Gentiles they're going into a tribulation the foolish virgin they're going to miss it they'll be saved in them in in the and brought into the new heavens and the new Earth and they'll Rest in paradise while we are back here on Earth in a millennial Reign for a thousand years but we find that the Bride As She the last visible sign of her before you see Moses and Elijah in the gospel going to the Jews is the bride is now the the measurable Perfection of the Lord Jesus Christ she is the temple she's being measured she's now the word she's become like him it's now Mr and Mrs Jesus Christ to the world and that's the last sign you see we don't get trapped up by chapters and verses because those were added hundreds of years later by translators when John wrote it it was just continuous it went from Revelation 10 11 all and it just moved into the to the wording of rev of Revelation 11 1 and we see that connection there that the inside of the of the temple was measured because the bride is the measurable standard let the world say what they want she's the measurable standard the word it didn't matter what people thought of Paul's teaching it was the Gospel that God would judge the World by because now that now since the gospel since the world is only going to be judged by Jesus Christ and can only be judged by Jesus Christ then that then that proves that Paul's teaching and Jesus Christ was Jesus Christ in the form of the word you follow me because Paul said that it can't be changed it can't be countermanded I've laid a foundation whoever Builds on here has to build it according to the way the foundation you can't build contrary to it and so if even an angel or any other preacher if even if I myself come back so it wasn't the man if even I myself come back and teach any other thing if it's anybody else if it's an angel let them be cursed because what I say God will judge the World by Jesus Christ but and so what he said was the word and that was Christ in word form see so so we find then that today when we make a statement that this is the gospel this message of the hour is the gospel by which the Lord by which you will make a Rapture or you want we're only we're only saying that because this message is the restoration of Paul's teaching amen so quite naturally we would say that quite naturally we would believe that that if if it's going to have to be what Paul established and and that gets lost down through the church ages and we can see that historically and then it gets restored at the end time according to prophecy and it happens exactly like he said then why would I not put my faith that this that this message is giving me rapturing Faith and rapturing Faith as beautiful as it is and as necessary as it is I'm so glad that it is preceded by Rapture and Grace I want you to know it's not just Grace it's not just the favor of God it's rapturing Grace it's a Grace that the grace of God I'm going to say a little bit more about it you you could never say too much about the grace of God that came to us by that day on Calvary so we find that when we talk about the measurable standard what is it what is it what's being measured the temple and that and that's what Solomon was building and that's what Jesus was and therefore whatever he was his bride would be you see and so because they are one they become one flesh and she's she's life of his life word of his word amen and so so it's based on that that brother Brandon would say she is him not meaning she's literally him because we don't we don't baptize in each other's names and you don't I don't pray to you and you can't save me but Hebrews 13 8 is the key to unlock the how is she him she's the same as him because in whatever form Jesus Christ came whether it was Jesus creating the heavens and the Earth as the Bible said he did or whether it was walking in the prophets of the Old Testament that was Jesus or whether it was or whether it was Jesus living in a in a body that walked the shores of Galilee or whether it when he went away and came back and he said I go away but I'll come again I will come again and I'll live inside you that and so now his church his body is quite naturally misses Jesus Christ the same as he's always been that's how you identify the word for your hour when it produces and if this message didn't produce it I'd be looking for another one when it produces the same life that you see in the Lord Jesus Christ when you see the same life It produced in Abraham that same faith when you see the same kind of commitment It produced in Joseph when you see the same kind of Courage It produced in Gideon when you see the same kind of the same kind of uh uh commitment and courage and faith that It produced in Moses and Moses said here's how you'll know the Lord God will raise up a prophet among you and he'll be a human he won't be some mystical being coming down it'll be God coming to you in human form see and so if you ever wanted to know how would God live or what would he be like if he were a human like me just read your Bible and read the story of Jesus you'd read about God being in Christ see and so so it's all about it's all it all comes down to being willing because this is what the message of restoration that was promised in this hour this is what it calls you to it it doesn't first of all let me let me clarify what it does by telling you what it's not come for it's not come to make us another denomination it's not come to make another organized religion we got 30 33 000 of them not interested in getting at the end of that line and forming another one amen so it's it's not come to give you better theology although it accomplishes that to give you better understanding theologically but what it comes for is to to make you the living Tabernacle of a living God's presence brother Donald that's why come that's why it come you understand it came to make us the living Tabernacle Peter said your Lively Stones built up see we could we could look at so many scriptures I'm gonna I'm gonna try to cut down today on on too much reading but we could easily go to Hebrews 12 and I'm thinking I should and then I think I shouldn't but but but but but but Paul let me just make a reference without putting it on the screen um no good to see you in the booth today Noah and so Paul speaks about that in the second chapter of Ephesians how that that we're built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets and Christ is the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto an Holy Temple of the Lord in whom ye also are building together so what I need to convince you of why the message came I just read you why the gospel comes say well what's the message this is the restored gospel that's all it is it's not a new message it's not a different one it's just the restoration of the original that's why it turns Believers into original kind of Christians that's exactly why that happens see it's not about a list of do's and don'ts we're not even about that at all this has nothing to do with that I'm I'm faithful to Christ's word because I'm in love with him I'm faithful to to you're faithful to your spouse because you're in love with that person so he goes on we could we could we could go to Hebrews 12 and oh my so many different places in Saint Peter where he talked about it and and and and but I but I I I want to I want to just move a little bit further and try to get get a little further along so when Stephen is preaching his sermon um Noah go back to our text in Acts 7 and give me verse 50 or let's get on to verse 50 again in Acts 7 and 50. now I want you to watch the line of demarcation between two verses verse 50 hath not my hands made all these things verse 51. you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and hardened ears I mean you talking about a that's a hairpin turn and so we find that that the Divide between verse 50 and 51 is Christian by the hearers to disallow their lives to be the living Tabernacle his whole subject that he's preaching on that he we started out in verse 44 and he starts talking about this Tabernacle built and by the time you get down to verse 50 those people have already made the decision they're hearing a holy ghost-filled preacher and right while he's preaching you want to talk about the polar opposite of Peter in the house of Cornelius the Bible says while he yet spanked these words the Holy Ghost fell so you got a big difference between that crowd and this crowd Stephen is preaching to them about being the Tabernacle of the living God's presence and by the by the as soon as he finishes the 50th verse which is 50s Jubilee and they refuse the Jubilee and immediately the very next verse he turns and says you stiff neck you uncircumcised people you do always resist God's Jubilee you resisted it in the days of Moses you resisted it in the days of the prophets which one of them did your fathers not kill and you polish their tombs indicating you agree with what they did you show by your works that you agree with their Rebellion and they were refusing can you imagine that you're hearing the Living Word of God that's inviting you I hope you're catching this today and bringing it home because I'm preaching in the 21st century I'm preaching today see this is what the message is about this is what it came for and it's an invitation to become the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place and the choice is yours and these people actually God's people Israel doctors of divinity Scholars that's brother as brother Brad was showing that in his Sunday school class today I've heard that same thing that they could take a a road scroll and run a pen through it and tell you every Hebrew letter it hit going through that's how studied they were and yet they not only rejected that scroll when it was in flesh that scroll lived in front of them and Stephen busted him on that he said he was right here you know it you know what you did and God proved it see so instead of repenting they got angry and what they're saying is and what many are saying today and I hope none of us are saying it they are saying I will not allow myself to be the living Temple of the living God's presence which is exactly what the message calls for today I said to the audience in Washington where I was just preaching what to God you could hear Stephen's voice crying out today what to God I could press play today and hear the voice of Stephen but I have an advantage that I can pick up this Bible and you can hear the same voice that was speaking through Stephen speaking to you what a privileged friend their way that way you're still not resting your Eternal destination on a man you're resting it on that's not a it's not a it's not a man it's the body word or the son of man what a privilege we have today to know that the same Christ who spoke to and through Stephen can speak to and through you and me and we can make the decision today to say I'll get in line I'm not going to get in line to be an organized religion but I'll get in line and fight to get to the head of the line if it means I can be the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence oh my because I I want to hear that voice that says come up my brother Jack Duff says you'll never hear come up if you don't first hear come out on that morning of our crossing over friends and I just thought what if this is that morning oh this might be that morning when we'll all cross over together oh my are the heavens open to you today like they were to Stephen can you can you stand in this Christ's rejecting world and see the same Jesus that he saw he saw him standing on the right hand of God's power can you see God's living power moving inside your life I asked them there and I'll ask you here here's a further question would you like to where is your heart today who or what holds your affections today I had never preached a sermon from the book of haggai until I was in Washington and the Lord anointed my heart for it and I'm not here to repreach that sermon this morning but I I thought it this would be perfectly in line with the real burden on my heart today because in the book of haggai he God comes to the people and it's the time of the restoration again and there and what are they restoring worship and they're there to build the temple back and you know we we've heard a lot of preaching on it recently brother Matt was preaching on that recently how that you know they're not to to despise the day of small things because it wasn't going to look like Solomon's Temple and and brother Matt pointed out so definitely how that that that every time there's an iteration of the of the of the next Temple it's it's less it's smaller it's not it's less beautiful but it's greater so that by the time you get to Jesus of Nazareth he has no Beauty at all that we should desire him and he's just one man walking the shores of Galilee but in him dwelt the fullness of the entire godhead bodily he was the greatest manifestation of this Temple and the whole reason he stepped forward to claim a book in Revelation 5 that was sealed up and and there was no way to get a bride ready the church could not go in its condition and she couldn't get any better so he had to unlock the sealed book and then bring that book down into the hands of an Angel messenger so that we could feed upon it because as brother Brad was saying this morning you are what you eat and I'm eating my way to a body change for the bread oh my goodness I'm eating my way to a body change this morning but he he came heck yeah I came on the scene and he you know he the the problem that the work had stopped now he's talking naturally and for anybody that thinks that you shouldn't you know why do we need a new church why do we got to redo a remodel why do we got to do all this we should you know why are we going to spend that kind of money and and a lot of times it's just people miserly and stingy and they don't want to help out a lot of times and and and you can say oh well you know and you get all these arguments all the the heavens you know that's his church and it's not a building a church ain't a building anyway and you hear that that's that somehow's just supposed to silence all the argument and it works pretty good until you run into haggai and then you get blasted in the mug when you when you read haggai because he gets in their face over that and he actually ties it back to their lives which are just running in circles and they're they're the people who've come back because Cyrus decreed Cyrus got anointed by God and said I'm going to send back the Israelites to build a house and to the true God and so you know Hagia comes on the scene and and he's going to look at this this unfinished project and he's going to say he's going to correlate that to their lives and he's because he's going to say now you look for much he's now he's talking about their natural lives I hope you'll just put yourself here this morning and ask that's what the word comes for to measure Yourself by e all right so are you willing to look into the liberty of God's word today he says you look for much and lo it came to little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it people get on the rat race of life and they and they just run full steam ahead and church is lower prioritized and fellowship is lower prioritized and prayer life is lower prayer terrorist and reading the Bible and listening to the message and coming you know all of these things get prioritized way down the list when they should be at the top and we're running here and running there say well I got to make a living I got a family I got to do I got a Bill's got this yeah you do but your heavenly father already knows that and that's why he said seek first the kingdom of heaven and it's righteousness and your father will add all those things to you why why would you want your version of them anyway I'd much rather have his version of them when I've tried to bless myself you know sometimes you say well I kind of got ahead well it was it was a mixed bag it was a mixed bag but when I just let him bless me it's just all good [Applause] think about this young people you young men and young women you're starting out now in your career starting to make money you know he he taught I mean here's here's here's people they're they're not willing to come and work on the house of God this is naturally and he's typing into spiritual they're not they're not they're not paying their tithes and offerings to the Lord because you know why they think they can't afford it and the truth is you're a thief if you do that and you can't not if you can't afford to not do it see and I I was just I was just you know encouraging our senior youth group sometimes I think in our last thing to say listen don't lose sight of that you know if you want to be successful in this life you obey God's word because it's not it's not yours to give it's not yours to even decide to give it belongs to him and if you keep it you're a thief period play an end of story and there's no way God can bless you when you do that I'm not preaching on tithes today I don't need to this church is very good at giving ties and offerings we were accomplished a lot around the world but but I'm trying to make these spiritual points he says why has everything you've chased come to nothing and the harder you chase it the further away it gets and the more chaos and if I can just just by next week I'll I'll get it and next week comes well by next week I'll be there and the next week comes and you just find out you're just going in a circle Where's God Where's God Where's God and he's he's right there where he always was waiting on you to follow the order of his word see it's not rocket science anything outside of the line in order God's word will fail see and so he says so why has it happened to you you looked for much you worked hard you went strong man you you as brother Eddie said you shook the bushes you you burnt the fields man you went you went hard at it he said but it came to little and when you and when you brought home you're little the Lord went and you went where'd all my stuff go [Laughter] and the Lord asked a question he's not waiting on you to ask it the Lord presupposes and just asked the question on your behalf why because of my house that is waste and ye run every man into his own house see so it was all about priorities there's been all kinds of building projects both naturally and spiritually down Through the Ages that's what God's been doing we're we're a house brother by Adam showed the pyramid there and and it speaks of the ages and there's faith and virtue and these things are all have to be in a in an individual believer but they also span and talk about the church ages right right that's the church so they've had all kinds of building projects they've they've built you know they've had Wilderness Tabernacles they've had Revival tents they've had Gothic Cathedrals they've had Wayside chapels they've had synagogues Temple meeting houses storefront missions catacombs see but one one of the things that Eugene Peterson in his translation uh his Bible translation called the message which I deeply love and uh not all of it because sometimes he Waters it down too much but just put that in there but but he he makes an observation here of all these things that they built he said there doesn't know there doesn't seem sometimes there doesn't seem to be any connection between the buildings themselves and the belief and behavior of the people who assemble in them something's wrong with this picture you're going you're you're trying to build a certain kind of life that looks a certain way that you think needs to be a certain way but what you're trying to accomplish as an end you're you're not anywhere your life is even is never conducive to that you're never going to get there because you won't organize the priorities of your life according to my word you know we want to go to heaven amen well Jesus said that he wanted the Lord he in in his prayer that he you know that he wanted God's will to be in Earth as it is in heaven so if you want to go to heaven you need to let this Earth become heavenly this Earth see thy will be done in this Earth as it is in heaven the image you saw that you see of me Lord let me today come closer to that image I gotta hurry so so we find that you know it it went on and on because but but but now we come to the spiritual connection of it all because Hagia is pointing out naturally now I'm going to just say the natural ones I want you to make the spiritual ones because I'm not a prophet only you know and God knows where the supplies hi guys trying to get them to see you've spent a lot of money but you don't have much to show for it no think spiritually even you've ran like crazy you've been in church for years you've been raising a message you've read your Bible and heard how many thousands of sermons how many in 28 years how sermons have you heard me preach alone just me see my family grew up listening to me preached I was preaching when my when you know right as my children are being born I started in the ministry how many sermons have they heard me how many sermons have my grandchildren heard me see you've spent a lot of money but you don't have much to show for it you keep filling your plates but you never get filled up you keep drinking and drinking and drinking but you're always thirsty this is what haggy I say unto him naturally you put on layer after layer of clothes but you can't get warm thus saith the Lord of hosts he says there in verse seven thus saith the Lord of hosts which is God of the Angel Armies thus saith god of the Angel armies consider your ways because there's a reason why it's like that what do I do haggy I he said here's what you do here's what I want you to do get up in the hills and cut some Timber and bring down and rebuild this Temple and do it just for me in honor of me I would say to you alone not because you're going to get a golden pot at the end of a rainbow or not because you're going to be the most popular person but live your life to glorify God stop living for you and start living for him living for you is a train wreck it's worthless [Applause] you've had great Ambitions for yourselves haggai says but nothing came of it but little you do have that you have brought to my temple I've blown it away there was nothing to it why and God ask again why you've run around this is a different translation from verse 9 to 11. while you've run around caught up with taking care of your own houses my house is in Ruins now I'm not talking about our building project I'm talking about your house you live in where's your spirituality where's your power with God where's your Holiness unto the Lord as a sacrifice see you've you have an assembling of people little doubt that the Lord will supply you with the proper building but what will you fill it with that's the real question friends so so we do remodel this inside our phase three we finally get this to this part we remodel it what are we going to fill it with what do you want to fill it with I mean are you sure you want this team of preachers because I can tell you you got seven men who are not going to compromise we're going to preach it straighter and hotter and harder you want a new building we're going to put all this labor and all this money but what do you want what do you want it to be for listen what do I preach for why do I want you to be I want you to be filled with all the knowledge of almighty God filled with the Holy Ghost see so we're to be the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place you go back and Deuteronomy and numbers in different places in Leviticus and you'll find that whether it didn't matter whether it was people bringing their offerings to the temple and the priests gathered and they had to Gather By The Altar and they had to consume the meat Parts the priest did and they had to consume it in a clean place so the church couldn't have funny business going on the word had to go forth from a clean pulpit and preachers had to have clean Minds and clean Hearts but it also whenever whenever the ashes of the heifer the Bullock was carried without the camp it also had to be a clean place I'm here to tell you you come to this clean place but when you take this word home when you take it home it needs to go home to a clean home with clean people with clean Minds [Applause] we're to be the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place in his life story he's told it numbers of times and my favorite is the 1955 in Los Angeles at the Angeles Temple brother Brown starts talking about the loss of his maybe Sharon Rose and his wife Mita and uh no I'm sorry he's telling about sister hope Branham and and he says here this is his little girl I put my hand over on her I said bless you sweetheart daddy wanted to raise you with all my heart I wanted to raise you and raise you to love the Lord but the angels are coming for you sweetheart daddy will take your little body down and lay it on the arms of Mama I'll bear you with her someday daddy will meet you you just wait up there with Mama when her mother was dying she had already passed away and brother Brandon backs up to tell that when her mother was dying she said last word she said bill stay on the field she said she said you don't why'd you call me back she said I was being escorted by these beings and there are trees and great birds and flying and she said I was at peace and you know that's what I've said so many times when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time he had no trouble describing what he heard and what he saw but he couldn't describe what he felt what does that feel like when all troubles are over forever oh man this life's journey this hard I'm born a man born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble when this little short life is a vapor it's filled with trouble when it's over and I sing on that beautiful Shore here to tell you this gospel is worth living for she said bill it's everything you said the Holy Ghost was it's divine love perfect love she says stay on the field Bill stay on the field and I said she said I said if I'm I said if I'm on the field when he comes I'll get the kids and meet if I'm not I'll be buried with you and you go over on the right side of the Great Gate he called it one place the Eastern Gate east side of the gate go to one side of the Great Gate [Applause] this is so real to him his wife is dying this woman he loves and she's slipping away she's already crossed and he called her back for a few minutes and he says and when you see all of them come in and he starts talking about when you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all of them coming in he said you stand there and start hollering bill bill bill just as loud as you can I'm here to tell you I don't want anything too quiet around here Heaven's going to be a loud place [Applause] just as loud as you can I'll meet you there I kissed her goodbye I'm on the battlefield today that's been nearly 20 years ago this was 59 he says I got my date with my wife I'm going to meet her I was up early this morning and oh the last two mornings have gotten up even earlier than normal and Lord why are you waking me up it's four o'clock and laying there and you know hour before my alarm even goes off which I almost never use because I'm always usually awake but and I just got up and I just started thinking about Resurrection morning you know I I was pondering and I thought and I and I and I was just meditating on some different things and thinking about this sermon today and and and and I've got different Bible studies that I've got made commitments to and different things and I was just thanking God I woke up this morning and it just came out of me so naturally I just started saying Lord thank you for this word thank you for this life oh I could be waking up somewhere with them not know you and be a million miles from you but I'm waking up today as Son of God I got another 24 hours another opportunity to go forward and I'd been thinking that the whole morning and and and when you get in those Realms hours just fly by you don't even realize it's five o'clock it's 5 30. and and I'm thinking well sister sweetheart I'll be waking up soon I should probably make some coffee and and I I'm standing there at the pot I'm starting to make a little bit of coffee and I thought to myself and I I thought you know between six and nine in the morning wow what If Today Was Resurrection morning between six and nine and I thought I wonder what time it is and I looked at my clock 6 A.M 6 colon zero zero I didn't know whether to shout run out in the street scream or I didn't know whether it wasn't cry there for the longest time and I said Lord what if this is that morning and you know the Lord just seemed to come upon me and say I want you to go ask the church today what if this was Resurrection morning oh I said Lord because I was asking him you know I and I thought to myself he came to me this morning because he knew I would believe that word and he knew I'd stand here with courage and carry it forward to you he knew I would try to fill your hearts with with faith and and even if we have to go down the line of Hagia and it gets a little tight I I knew I'm preaching to believers [Applause] such a privilege I thought to myself what if this was Resurrection morning I'm going to tell you something friend something that came across my mind I said Lord if this was a resurrection morning with the same ease that you walked into my living room as I said in my chair with that sames my family would walk right into my living room and I'd stand there and see them I'm here to tell you it's going to be that smooth and that easy one of these mornings friends they're just going to be standing there and it's going to be home going time [Applause] on Resurrection at my own Resurrection morning it won't be any more difficult for my loved ones to come walking right into my living room than it was for him you know why because there's Faith laying in my heart that I don't have to try to have that's the beauty in fact I in fact I can't even get it to go away and not only do I not try I have to try to get it I can't even get rid of it it just it just it's faith it just believes it just loves God it just loves his word it loves his presence [Music] I thought about the inscription on our Statue of Liberty in the harbor with Silent Lips give me your tired you're poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free The Wretched refuse of your teeming Shore send these the homeless Tempest tossed to me I lift my lamp beside the golden door and I thought about the fact that oh you know that's interesting because it says with Silent Lips and that statue is just a statue Lady Liberty her lips never move she can't she's Stone and meddle she can't utter a word she doesn't speak at all or say a word at all yet on just the sighting of her from afar disparaged and weary people with broken lives take hope again men and women and even children cry just I've seen old films of of refugees coming in from hardship and lands afar and they enter the harbor and they just see a statue with her torch raised up and she it's it's called Uh uh imprisoned lightning this torch that you see this light this lamp is in prison lightning that that that that that that I lifted I stand beside I lift my lamp beside the golden door and you get men and women and and and they've come from hardship or from tyranny and they're they're weeping and they they they hear it they hear a voice that's beyond the ears because she doesn't speak but it's what they're seeing it's an image of something what is it friends if the world can see you maybe you'll never say a word to them but God will see this book living inside of you they will see this book living inside of you oh my it's a deep calling in these people yearning to breathe free longing it's heartbreaking When You See It grown men and grown women and children sobbing and they're just seeing it she's not saying a word and I'm not I'm not here to data take away that which Millions have experienced coming to these Shores by you know laying out the sad plight of what America has become or the immoral caused her Freedom exacts upon human lives in the 21st century I'll only point to what she used to stand for when she was one nation under God you see it was never about a statue in a harbor this nation was founded under the bloodstained banner of Christ men have gotten flawed men flawed men for sure history has taught us that they weren't perfect men they made horrible horrible mistakes and and and and we recognize that but at the same time they weren't afraid to pray and they weren't afraid to take a stand for God's word you see great men and women both of God raised raised the banner high and you know this this blood-stained Banner is the is the cross and it's and it's a Blood Stained like a flag waving and and I you know I'm still calling for for anyone who wants to meet me there I raised my torch today I raise a torch for Freedom if you're tired of being terrorized by the devil then I raise my torch meet me at the bloodstained banner Hallelujah I've assembled under this inside it's an inside the Bible said he would raise up an end sign and and he said Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men to me you have no greater drawing card for your loved ones than to let Christ be lifted up inside you oh I called him my loved ones in this building today to meet me under the bloodstained banner Say Peppa where are you going to be I'll be right there I call for this church and people on the internet whoever whoever whoever appreciates this ministry meet me at the bloodstain Banner because from there will Marshall to go home [Applause] not under a man but under the word high and lifted up Hallelujah and it's not imprisoned lightning sending it around the world oh I just say Lord take everything I got but grant me that take my houses and lands change my dreams and my plans I'm placing my whole life in your hands Hallelujah I want nothing more than that I want I want I only want to know Jesus Christ and him crucified [Applause] that I might live to the Eternal purpose for which he gave me life and that you may do the same when sister hope Branham when she's passing away brother tells that in 1959 it had happened many years before 20 years ago the 1930s well after his encounter with his wife at her bedside as she lay dying brother Brandon would later understand that before they met at the Eastern Gate Had A procession that Jesus would be leading he found out after he went beyond the curtain of time that they actually meet right back here first they would meet right back here again I wonder what I would do and that's why I thought this morning I wonder what I would do if this was that day if this was the morning when they would come between six and nine and that's not an established thing because six and nine at what time zone I don't know maybe it's maybe God's going to do it that way maybe as the sun rises and goes around the earth he'll just start resurrecting them oh my goodness if I got if I got up one morning at four o'clock and started getting text messages from Australia they're already here what all right at four in the morning I'd call every one of you and get you out of bed and say go in your living room it's almost time [Applause] Hallelujah I believe it it's not real friends Hallelujah I was running around and I was thinking I was trying to make notes and I and I thought oh my well I wonder if there's any time left is it nine o'clock yet and I looked and it was only 7 52 and I said I'm still looking Eastward I'm still looking at the Rising Sun could this be that happy day Hallelujah I decided that if this was that morning now I'm going to close right here when I get finished but it's not like brother Diggs 10 minutes into any sermon I'm feeding the clothes don't don't get nervous I decided that if this was that morning I was thinking this at 7 52. I said if this was that morning I would what would I do if I knew any minute my loved ones are going to be standing in front of me what would I do I'd go to God first the first thing I would do is I'd go to God and thank him for this I would thank him for his word I would thank him for his restored word in this hour that he has given me back every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I am standing in his love divine every promise in the book is mine that's what the opening of the seals did that's what a mighty angel came down for that's what an open book was given to you to feed upon if this was that morning I would go and thank him for his word I would thank him not only for sending it but I would thank him for the Supernatural and you better believe it has to be Supernatural I would thank him for the supernatural ability to receive it and to believe it and to apply it I would thank him that I could hear and recognize and act upon the word of God [Applause] I would repent I'd get on my knees and I'd repent for all the times when I didn't keep its precepts or all the times when I didn't walk perfectly in its statutes but because of the opening of the word I would know that those are all under the blood I would know that I stand perfect before Christ because I when he said I believe the report I received him upon uh the whom God sent not because of my works it's all listen friends all of those missteps I want to hear you I want you to know today I want you to hear it when you have fully received Christ in this hour all your missteps you're like that woman who came and Jesus said I say unto thee her sins which are many are all forgiven Hallelujah a believer it's all his grace not because of my works I'm neither admitted nor rejected by success or failures you understand that I'm not admitted into heaven because of successes I'm not rejected from Heaven because of failures it is it's nothing but the Sovereign Love And The Sovereign Grace of almighty God upon my life hallelujah oh friends May whoever come in I I started walking through my house and I I started going room to room and I I thought tomorrow I went and I started in the back bedroom my little girls had been there not so little anymore but my little girls had spent the night there with me and my mom and they're gone and my mom's got the bed made back nice and I just walked in there and I thought about my little angels had been asleep right here and they were they were so safe and they were so secure because they were pebble's house and they were under a token home and the Holy Ghost was here and Angels were around the house and they were able to rest in comfort and I laid my hands and I thought about them and whoever would lay in this bed I said Lord let it be that whoever lays in this bed will be filled with the Holy Ghost I want whoever lays on this bed to be filled with all the fullness of the knowledge of him Hallelujah I started walking through my house I started touching my doors I said whoever comes in and out of this door whoever goes in and out of this door whoever goes in and out of this door may they come in the power of the Resurrection May they know it's a token applied home whoever lives here may they be safe whoever believes here may God prove himself alive oh my friends may this home I'm saying Lord may this home be a place where your word is revered where your word is loved where your word is respected and where your word is obeyed how many want that today Hallelujah that's what I want that's that's what I would want if this was Resurrection morning if this was Resurrection morning I thought I was going through my house between six and nine saying what would I want if this was the morning what I want to make sure is in play here if this was Resurrection morning I wouldn't worry about all the cares of this life the cares of this life would mean very little to me if this was Resurrection morning the things we spend so much time worrying about and the things we Chase and the things that we give ourselves to the cares of this life would mean very little to me I just thought that to myself do you agree with that if you had got up this morning and an angel Gabriel like appeared to Mary would have said to you good morning highly favored of God it's Resurrection morning say that's Fantasy Land it happened to Mary it happened it happened it had it happened Gideon it happened to Moses it happened to Abraham come on it happened to Solomon why are you part of that family he tends to show up with his family Hallelujah if this was Resurrection morning I wouldn't care what Misfortune had befallen me if this was Resurrection morning I wouldn't care who had offended me if this was Resurrection morning none of that stuff would hang on to me any longer I would only want I'd only want to know one thing am I in love with the Lord Jesus Christ my savior does he have my whole heart does he have my whole mind does he have my whole purpose does he have my full commitment what about it Bethel Tabernacle what about it on the air does he have your whole heart your whole mind your whole purpose your full commitment is my life pleasing to him if it's not let me get it there quickly Lord I want to tell you some friends I thought to myself as I was coming out of that beautiful Realm had to start getting ready I just thought to myself is one of the last things I said to myself self you need to ponder this in the morning when you rise when you lay your head to sleep and all through the day I just need to be saying is this Resurrection morning God I'm going to go throughout the day is the Resurrection coming I'm going to go to sleep tonight is the Resurrection coming I'm going to wake up the next morning is this the morning oh how different my life could be what an impact it could have as I go through they're sometimes wearing Journey how much more useful I could be to the master one I want nothing more out of this life than that and when I don't care about any the pursuit of anything else sure you got families and bills to pay and jobs to work so school to attend places to go I understand that Paul said that we live in the world we can't go out of it not yet but just don't live like you're of it I am from it but I'm not of it I did come from its soil and it's
