[7:29] And with these few foolish words that I
[7:32] have
[7:34] that the people would be able to take
[7:37] something of value from it, be able to
[7:40] hide your word into their hearts, face
[7:42] this dark day.
[7:45] Be with us. We invite you into our
[7:46] service knowing full well that you
[7:48] always come when you're invited.
[7:50] We ask these things in the name of the
[7:52] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[7:54] So, um I want to take a brief reading
[7:58] and let y'all be seated. Um
[8:01] and we'll just and you don't necessarily
[8:03] have to turn. I'll just read it. Um this
[8:05] is from Acts chapter 1. When they
[8:07] therefore were come together, they asked
[8:08] of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this
[8:11] time restore again the kingdom to
[8:12] Israel? And he said unto them, "It is
[8:15] not for you to know the times or the
[8:17] seasons which the Father hath put in his
[8:20] own power, but you shall receive power
[8:23] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you,
[8:25] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[8:27] in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in
[8:29] Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of
[8:31] the earth." Y'all could be seated.
[8:34] So, um I want to um take So, last time I
[8:39] was here, which was back in December, I
[8:42] don't remember exactly when um it's been
[8:44] a been a while. Um seems like um
[8:48] the um
[8:51] last time I was here, I I did a a Sunday
[8:53] school and I took the the title Dynamo
[8:55] um and just sort of talking about um
[8:57] putting mechanics with dynamics and
[8:59] things like that. Um, and I wanted to
[9:01] kind of um, kind of take that thought
[9:05] and and spend a little more time on it.
[9:07] Um, it's just been what's burning me up
[9:10] um, the last couple weeks. And, um, I
[9:12] just felt like I didn't kind of rushed
[9:14] it last time because I was trying to do
[9:15] it all in one in one Sunday school. So,
[9:17] if you don't mind if some you hear some
[9:19] repeated things, I'm sorry. Um, but
[9:21] that's just kind of where um, where the
[9:24] Lord feel like the Lord's leading me. So
[9:26] um
[9:29] so anyhow um the um I want to take this
[9:34] this scripture here and where it talks
[9:36] about um but you shall receive power
[9:38] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[9:41] Now
[9:43] um
[9:45] I also read here this is second Peter
[9:47] chapter uh 1 verse 5 and it says and
[9:51] beside this giving all diligence add to
[9:53] your faith virtue and to virtue
[9:55] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[9:56] and temperance patience and to patience
[9:58] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[9:59] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[10:02] charity.
[10:04] So
[10:06] uh this is from we all are very familiar
[10:08] with this the statue of the perfect man.
[10:10] Um this is the the scriptural basis for
[10:13] I'm sure what I'm sure we're all very
[10:14] familiar with with you know we've all
[10:16] seen the diagram of the pyramid with all
[10:17] the different levels and the church ages
[10:19] and the messengers and everything all
[10:21] kind of stacked up together. And um
[10:27] you know, I just want to take a a minute
[10:29] here and just notice that this is
[10:33] if you're going to have the stature of
[10:34] the perfect man, you cannot leave out
[10:35] any one layer of that, right? You know,
[10:39] you have to have you have to have the
[10:40] faith and then you have to build each
[10:42] step upon the next. If you try to get
[10:45] away, if you try to do things out of
[10:47] order, then you're going to have
[10:48] problems, right?
[10:50] Um, and I'll and this is the analogy
[10:52] that I'm going to keep coming back to,
[10:53] right? Because this is just what I know,
[10:55] right? I'm a mechanic. I'm that's what I
[10:57] I you know, I work on generators every
[10:59] day. I work on engines. And um,
[11:02] [clears throat] you know, every single
[11:04] component, we talk a lot about the the
[11:06] God having a line and order to his word,
[11:08] right? There's a line, right? Meaning
[11:10] that there's there's a a an
[11:12] organization, right? Every every part of
[11:14] the word has a place. Um, but then
[11:17] there's also an order to it. There's
[11:19] it's not it's both, right? Because you
[11:21] can have all the right components, but
[11:23] if they're not ordered, if they're not
[11:25] um set in the right timing, then you
[11:27] also have problems, right? You can take
[11:30] like on an engine, you can take there's
[11:32] a you know big big chain on the front of
[11:34] engine block called a timing chain. If
[11:36] that timing chain is and that's just
[11:39] that timing what its job is, if you
[11:40] can't figure it out from the name is it
[11:42] sets the timing for every cylinder. It
[11:44] says that for every rocker, every push
[11:45] rod, every spark plug, every single part
[11:48] of that engine is the timing of it is
[11:51] set by that timing chain and um and the
[11:54] timing gears. And so if if any if that
[11:57] chain gets out of align, if that if the
[11:59] gears get out of align with and things
[12:01] aren't in in proper order, you're going
[12:03] to get misfires. You're going to get um
[12:05] you know, spark is going to be going off
[12:07] when there's no fuel in the cylinder. Um
[12:08] there's going to be you know, you're
[12:10] going to be venting fuel out before the
[12:11] spark hits. Nothing. and you're going to
[12:13] get misfires in the in the in the in the
[12:15] cylinders. Nothing's going to work
[12:16] right. It's going to be kind of
[12:18] powerless. The engine it you might get
[12:20] some some fire in some of the the the
[12:22] cylinders. It'll make some noise, but it
[12:24] won't be right. And you're it's going to
[12:26] be kind of gutless, right? It'll be
[12:28] it'll be making a lot of noise like it's
[12:29] got power. It, you know, potentially.
[12:32] Um, but it's not it's not going to be
[12:34] working right. And so, it's it's
[12:36] actually important when we look at the
[12:37] statue of the perfect man. There is a
[12:39] line, right? You have to have all the
[12:40] components in there. But there's also an
[12:41] order to this, right?
[12:44] There's also an order to this. And if
[12:46] you try to um get things out of order,
[12:49] you're going to have problems.
[12:52] You know, God, it really does matter to
[12:55] to God the order in which we do things,
[12:58] right? There's a reason why we have a
[13:00] song service before the preaching.
[13:02] There's a reason why um you know that
[13:06] there's a reason why we have, you know,
[13:08] repentance before baptism, right?
[13:10] There's these are things are important
[13:11] and if we try to we try to get um get
[13:15] out of order, we try to do things um out
[13:17] of sequence, you know, timing timing is
[13:20] is
[13:22] timing is everything with God, right?
[13:24] Timing is is is everything with God. You
[13:26] I mean, you take a um a seed, you know,
[13:30] you don't you you there's a lot of
[13:32] planting and watering and waiting before
[13:34] you get fruit, right? There's a there's
[13:36] a lot of there's a process. And so, you
[13:40] know, I just want to, you know, that's a
[13:41] I think that's a key thing to to bear in
[13:42] mind in all of this. Um,
[13:46] but I want to read this is from the the
[13:48] sermon statue of a perfect man 1962.
[13:51] Says, "Then add to your faith virtue."
[13:53] Now, right there knocks a lot of us
[13:55] down. Yes, sir. Yes. Add virtue to your
[13:58] faith. That doesn't just mean living a
[14:00] virgin life, you know, like the woman or
[14:02] a man and so forth. That doesn't have
[14:04] nothing to do with that. The Bible said,
[14:06] we read over here in the book of Luke
[14:08] where it said virtue went out of him. Is
[14:11] that right? If we're going to be like
[14:13] him, we must have virtue. Then we must
[14:16] have it to be like him.
[14:19] And so, you know, I think this is a very
[14:22] very striking um striking quote. I think
[14:25] I heard this when brother Caleb uh read
[14:27] this during Sunday study school and it
[14:28] kind of floored me a little bit um
[14:30] because I had never put that together um
[14:32] that you know in the where it's talking
[14:33] about statue of perfect man it's
[14:34] referring brother Brandham links the
[14:37] virtue in the statue of perfect man to
[14:39] the virtue that went out of out of
[14:41] Christ when the woman got healed. Um and
[14:44] so we'll just kind of to add a little
[14:47] bit of of um context there. This is Luke
[14:49] chapter 8 is the scripture that he's
[14:51] referencing there. Um Luke chapter 8
[14:53] vers 45 and Jesus said who touched me
[14:56] when all denied Peter um and they that
[14:59] were with him said master the multitude
[15:01] throng theemp and press thee and sayest
[15:03] thou who touched me and Jesus said
[15:05] somebody hath touched me for I perceive
[15:08] that virtue has gone out of me now if
[15:10] you take that you know it obviously
[15:13] doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[15:14] necessarily if if you're equating the
[15:18] word virtue to simply like what brother
[15:19] Brandham said like a virgin life a lot
[15:21] doesn't make any sense. How does how
[15:24] does you know
[15:26] the touching Jesus cause his his
[15:30] holiness lif style to leave him? That
[15:32] doesn't make any sense. But if the
[15:34] reason why it doesn't make any sense is
[15:36] because, you know, with in spite of
[15:38] their best efforts, the folks who
[15:39] translate the King James didn't exactly
[15:41] translate that word exactly one to one
[15:43] to into English. Um the the Greek word
[15:48] there
[15:50] um is actually the that the word virtue
[15:54] is actually translated from the Greek
[15:56] word dynamin is how we would pronounce
[15:59] it. Um and what that word means is uh
[16:04] force specifically miraculous power.
[16:07] Okay. So, so it's not um and so
[16:12] obviously if we if we were to translate
[16:14] it that way and Jesus said, "Somebody
[16:15] had touched me for I perceived that
[16:16] miraculous power is gone out of me."
[16:19] Okay, so we we we follow that. Um
[16:22] now that word dynamon is um I'm sure
[16:25] some of you may be familiar with that.
[16:27] It's where we get the word dynamo. It's
[16:29] also where we get the word dynamite. Um
[16:32] it's or dynamic. anything with dynamism
[16:35] comes from um that word damon or
[16:37] technically um dunami but dynamon is is
[16:40] kind of the more um direct English to
[16:43] that but um
[16:45] so the the point here is that
[16:50] what Jesus is referring to and it's by
[16:52] the way it's the same word in that he
[16:53] used in Acts chapter 1 when he said you
[16:55] will be endued with power from on high
[16:56] what he said was you should be endued
[16:57] with dynam on high and so you know and
[17:02] so for for brother Brandham to pick this
[17:04] up and say, "Listen, if you want to be
[17:05] like Christ, right? In order," which
[17:07] notice how he says this, right? um if
[17:10] we're going to be like him, we must have
[17:12] virtue then, right? So, in other words,
[17:14] if we're going to be like Christ, we
[17:16] have to have power like Christ had.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; We have to have we must have it to be
[17:22] like him. Well,
[17:26] what does the word Christian mean?
[17:29] Right? What does the word Christian
[17:30] mean? It means it was and by the way the
[17:32] Christians did not name themselves
[17:34] Christians.
[17:35] The people named themsel named them
[17:37] Christians, right? The people I believe
[17:40] it was Corinth Corinth was I believe is
[17:42] the is where that was done. I might I
[17:43] got that wrong. Um I'm sure a Sunday
[17:45] school teacher can correct me. Um but
[17:48] either way it was in a Greek city where
[17:49] the where they were first called
[17:51] Christians.
[17:53] And it wasn't they were they were called
[17:55] Christians. Not that they called
[17:56] themselves Christians, but that the
[17:58] people were able to the people around
[17:59] them were rec recognized that whatever
[18:01] was in Christ is in these people.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Right? That's what you know. And so if
[18:08] you're going to be like Christ, how in
[18:10] the world did the did the people
[18:11] recognize
[18:13] that they were the same thing as Christ?
[18:14] How did they recognize that? you know,
[18:17] it wasn't it wasn't that um
[18:22] you know, it wasn't because you know,
[18:23] yes, Jesus was a was a a a very good man
[18:27] and just he was a he was a a loving
[18:29] person. There were many loving people
[18:31] that did not go before him, right? That
[18:34] did not spread his name far and wide.
[18:36] There's a Greek city far away from
[18:37] Jerusalem had heard of Jesus. And it
[18:40] wasn't because, you know, Jesus cared
[18:44] for people and and ate dinner with the
[18:46] the outcasts. That's not what spread his
[18:49] name far and wide. What spread his name
[18:51] far and wide is that he fed 5,000. He
[18:54] there were there were works that
[18:55] accompanied who he was. There was
[18:57] vindication and power that went with
[18:59] that. Right now, like I said, um my job
[19:03] I'm a generator mechanic. Um, and that
[19:07] word dynam, right? I said it also is
[19:08] where we get the word dynamo. Well, a
[19:09] dynamo is a generator. That's what it
[19:11] is. It's a fancy word for a generator.
[19:12] And anything from a little pole start,
[19:14] you know, 3 and a half kilowatt pull
[19:16] start that you get from a hardware store
[19:18] all the way up to a multi-megawatt
[19:20] nuclear power plant. Those are all of
[19:21] different scale and scope of dynamo.
[19:25] Dynamo is anything that produces
[19:26] electricity
[19:28] and um or any you know generator of some
[19:31] it generates electricity. I guess
[19:32] technically a battery is technically
[19:34] generator but it's that's not really
[19:36] what it's not really a dynamo per se. Um
[19:40] but any kind of generator and that's
[19:41] what I work on every day. Now I also
[19:44] know that the reason why I'm kind of uh
[19:47] making this point about um power is
[19:50] because when you're talking about a
[19:51] generator um notice when I said the
[19:53] scale of it right you can have a 3 and a
[19:55] half kilowatt all the way up to a
[19:56] multimegawatt. Well, the watt rating is
[19:59] the measure of power output.
[20:02] Specifically, it's a scientific word,
[20:04] like the scientific term, the word
[20:06] power, right? There's a there's a
[20:07] scientific definition for that. Um, and
[20:10] what power is scientifically
[20:12] is the ability to convert energy or
[20:15] rather potential into work. There's
[20:19] actually another another the science
[20:21] uses another word work, right? There's a
[20:22] scientific definition for that. It's not
[20:23] just, you know, what um a lot of people
[20:26] don't do. Um the the right so what work
[20:30] is scientifically is the ability to
[20:33] affect change on the world. That's what
[20:35] it is. So realistically to kind of sum
[20:38] all that up. In other words, what we are
[20:42] measuring the the the power output of a
[20:44] generator
[20:46] is how much
[20:49] um capacity that machine has to convert
[20:54] energy
[20:55] into productive output and affect change
[20:58] on the world.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Another way to another way to
[21:01] phrase this into into you know maybe
[21:03] analogy that a little more familiar if
[21:06] another another measure of hor of uh
[21:09] power is horsepower. We're a little more
[21:11] familiar with this. You can take a big
[21:14] truck and the amount of the fuel
[21:17] capacity. You you don't measure how
[21:18] powerful a truck is by how big the gas
[21:20] tank is, right? You don't measure it by
[21:22] how loud it is. You don't measure it by
[21:25] um you know a lot of things. What you
[21:26] measure you don't measure by the
[21:28] wheelbase. what you measure the truck by
[21:31] is how big of a load it can haul, right?
[21:34] That that's what we're, you know, when
[21:35] you look at a Ford F-150 versus an F-250
[21:38] versus an F350, all that that number
[21:40] increase is the is the difference and
[21:42] how big of a load you can set in the
[21:43] back of that thing, right? Is how big of
[21:46] a, you know, what's the tow capacity.
[21:48] That's what we that's what we care about
[21:49] if you're buying a truck.
[21:51] Unless you're just in it for the
[21:52] aesthetics, in which case, why are you
[21:54] buying a truck? Um, I always, this
[21:57] always bugs me. And you see all these
[21:58] guys with the the big lift kit and the
[22:00] shiny rims and the lights and all that
[22:01] stuff. And like what? Why did you buy a
[22:03] truck, man? You can't even You can't put
[22:06] a couch in that thing. What are you
[22:07] talking about? Go throw go throw a half
[22:10] a ton of of uh of you know gravel in the
[22:12] back of that truck and go unload it and
[22:14] see how much you like it after that. Um
[22:19] uh anyhow um so
[22:24] so the point is so that's what power is,
[22:26] right? That's what what a what a
[22:27] generator does. It has power output. And
[22:30] that power output is the ability to
[22:32] affect change on the world, right? We're
[22:33] measuring the size of a generator not
[22:35] by, like I said, not by how loud it is,
[22:37] not by how um how much fuel it consumes,
[22:39] not the footprint, not how much
[22:41] horsepower the engine has, but we're
[22:42] we're measuring it by how many light
[22:44] bulbs can this thing turn on, how many
[22:46] air conditioners can it turn on, how big
[22:48] of a machine can run off of this
[22:49] generator. If you're talking about like
[22:51] a uh you know, a lot of job sites will
[22:53] have those big um portables or mobile
[22:55] technically. There's a big mobile
[22:57] generator, you know, um, how many
[22:59] welding rigs can this thing fire up? How
[23:01] many, you know, what's the, you know,
[23:03] how many electric jackhammers can this
[23:05] thing run? This is this is this is what
[23:07] we we care about when we're talking
[23:08] about a generator because the generator,
[23:09] the whole purpose of it is it's going to
[23:11] have productive work that has to come
[23:13] out of it. It's got to produce
[23:14] something.
[23:16] And so likewise, you know, we take this
[23:17] and we talk about with when Jesus is
[23:19] saying, you will be imbued with power
[23:21] from on high.
[23:24] You know, that doesn't mean you will
[23:29] have a big church meeting. You'll have a
[23:30] big jumping up and down move of the
[23:32] spirit. It's not what he's saying. He's
[23:34] saying you will be imbued with something
[23:36] that's going to produce something in the
[23:38] world. It's going to have productive
[23:40] output. It's not just going to be um
[23:44] you know, it's not just going to be a
[23:45] bunch of hype. It's not going to be a
[23:47] bunch of emotional workup. It's not just
[23:48] going to be, you know, and and see
[23:50] that's ultimately that's where brother
[23:51] Brandham had his big break with the
[23:53] Pentecostals in the in the early 1900s
[23:55] because they focused on Acts chapter 2
[23:58] where they spoke in tongues. They they
[24:01] went out, they were preaching on the
[24:02] streets, they had this big outpouring of
[24:04] the spirit and that's good. That's
[24:06] wonderful. And we I don't have anything
[24:07] against that obviously. Um brother Brand
[24:10] didn't have anything against that. Um,
[24:12] but ultimately if that's as far as it
[24:15] went, if they had had their big church
[24:17] meeting and then and then nothing after
[24:20] that, then what was the point?
[24:23] So what? I mean, you can get an
[24:25] emotional work up at a ball game. You
[24:27] can get an emotional workup. I've been
[24:29] to rock concerts and had emotional
[24:31] workup, right? You can do you can get an
[24:33] emotional workup in a lot of things,
[24:34] right? You go talk to some of the
[24:35] missionaries who have been out to um you
[24:38] know in Africa and in India and some of
[24:40] these places where you got you know you
[24:42] got the witch doctors beating the drums
[24:43] and people do all kinds of stuff. If all
[24:46] we're in it is for emotional workup you
[24:48] know I mean
[24:51] if if if that's what if that's what we
[24:53] want. I mean you you look at even in the
[24:55] in the the secular
[24:58] the secular world or not secular I'm
[25:00] sorry um the nominal Christian world
[25:03] where you have a lot of these you know
[25:04] sort of u nominally nominally Christian
[25:07] they're a lot of them are if not
[25:09] outright Pentecostal have their roots in
[25:10] Pentecostal churches part of the
[25:12] charismatic moves a lot of them are
[25:14] non-denominational but you could watch
[25:16] videos of these people and they'll get
[25:17] the band out there and the you know
[25:19] working the people up get the the the
[25:21] you know the bass guitar bumping and the
[25:24] the the drums pounding and and people
[25:26] will get up on their on their feet and
[25:28] dancing and and waving their arms and
[25:30] you can look at them and it's not
[25:33] it's not
[25:35] um
[25:38] it's not fake. They're not just they're
[25:40] not just putting on they they really
[25:41] mean what they're doing, but you can
[25:43] tell that there's no real power in it.
[25:45] They they all all the women are are are
[25:48] dressed immorally and got their haircut.
[25:50] All the men are are um you know, you
[25:54] talk to them after after the the church
[25:56] is over. You know, you I'm sure we've
[25:57] all met people like this. You you know,
[25:59] they they'll go they'll be all worked up
[26:01] in some emotional workup during church,
[26:04] but as soon as they hit the back door,
[26:05] they'll go back to whatever heistic
[26:07] lifestyle they've got, right? You know,
[26:09] I I um
[26:12] as I said um I think I said this last
[26:16] time, you know, the great um the great
[26:19] world traveling international
[26:21] missionary, Brother Dale Smith once told
[26:23] me that it doesn't matter how, you know,
[26:25] because people will measure the the
[26:27] success of a camp meeting or a church
[26:29] meeting or a youth camp or whatever by
[26:31] how high the people jumped, like were
[26:32] the people jumping. He goes, "I don't
[26:34] care if they jumped." That's good. He
[26:35] goes, "But ultimately what I care about
[26:36] is do they walk straight when they hit
[26:38] the ground?" Right? There has to be some
[26:40] productive output to this. If all you've
[26:42] got is a lot of noise, if all you've got
[26:44] is a lot of of charisma, a lot of
[26:48] emotional
[26:50] release
[26:51] that
[26:53] you're not a Christian, right? Because
[26:55] remember, put it like this. The
[26:58] definition of a Christian is somebody
[26:59] who lives a life that is like under
[27:00] Christ. And if it is like Christ and if
[27:03] it is true Christian, it will follow the
[27:05] same pattern that it did in the Bible,
[27:06] which was the people around you will be
[27:09] able to tell. They will know that you're
[27:12] a Christian, right? You didn't have to,
[27:14] right? They they knew that those people
[27:16] were Christians before the word
[27:17] Christian even was invented,
[27:20] &gt;&gt; right? They in had to invent a whole new
[27:21] word to explain what these people were.
[27:24] And so,
[27:26] you know, if if what we're doing if if
[27:28] our if our religion is not producing
[27:31] that, we got a problem, right? What are
[27:34] we doing here? If we're not being
[27:35] Christians, if it's not producing a
[27:37] lifestyle that the people around you can
[27:38] look at you and say, "Wow, whatever is
[27:40] inside of you has produced a work in you
[27:43] has produced you do things the way
[27:46] Christ did them." Right? you you there
[27:48] is something that's causing you to live
[27:50] and behave in a way that is beyond what
[27:53] just simply some psychology can produce,
[27:55] right? You know, um here's I'll give you
[28:00] another kind of an example. Um you take
[28:02] like the 12step programs like AA or um
[28:04] Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics
[28:06] Anonymous and these different ones, you
[28:07] know, addiction recovery programs. I
[28:09] don't have anything against them. I know
[28:10] several people who've been greatly
[28:12] helped by those programs. Um
[28:15] but and and frankly there's a and if you
[28:17] look at them um so I'm sure everyone's
[28:19] if you're familiar with these at all um
[28:21] you know the the first step is admitting
[28:23] that you have a problem and I don't
[28:24] remember if it's the second step or
[28:25] third step but it's it's one of the one
[28:27] of the first couple is um submitting
[28:30] yourself to a higher power
[28:32] &gt;&gt; right the even within those programs
[28:33] they recognize and by the way these
[28:35] programs the reason why I'm mentioning
[28:36] them is because the 12step programs are
[28:38] the single best sort of um uh secular
[28:43] psychology mechanism in the world for um
[28:47] addiction recovery. They they have the
[28:49] best success rate of anybody and even
[28:51] they have to admit that you have to
[28:53] submit yourself to a higher power.
[28:54] That's why most of these programs are
[28:55] held in like church basement and things
[28:57] like that. Um because it's directly
[28:59] connected to some sort of uh most of the
[29:00] people who go through those programs end
[29:02] up some form of um nominal Christian or
[29:04] at least um God conscious some kind. you
[29:07] you have to according to the program.
[29:09] But those programs, the best that they
[29:10] can produce, not a single one of them
[29:13] ever claim to cure an addict. Not one of
[29:15] them claim a to cure addiction. Um, in
[29:19] fact, they tell you off the right off
[29:21] the front, you know, right off the front
[29:24] page, you will never be a recovered
[29:27] addict. You will be an addict the rest
[29:29] of your life. That's the best they can
[29:31] offer you.
[29:32] And that and and it's right there.
[29:34] Everybody knows, right? You have to you
[29:36] have you can never quit AA. You're
[29:38] always in it forever because the minute
[29:40] cuz anyone you can you can have kicked a
[29:42] bottle for 15 20 years and you go
[29:44] through one bad spell, a loved one
[29:46] passes, you know, some you know your
[29:48] business blows up, something happens,
[29:50] some event happens and you're right back
[29:52] down the rabbit hole,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; right? You're right. You will go right
[29:55] back and and anybody no matter how long
[29:57] they've been, you know, recovered can
[30:00] always relapse. And that's why they
[30:02] never offered because what happened was
[30:04] they never offered deliverance.
[30:06] All they offered was remission.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; They they that's the and that's the best
[30:11] psychology can offer anybody,
[30:14] you know, because and that's what that's
[30:17] what just psych that's the best
[30:19] psychology can offer. But what what God
[30:22] offers, what the spirit offers is an
[30:24] actual work of deliverance, right? an
[30:27] actual work of deliverance where it's
[30:28] not you don't have to you know you know
[30:31] aa can can can kind of help you uh
[30:35] silence the monkey on your back but only
[30:37] God can get it off your back
[30:39] &gt;&gt; right there there's a different there's
[30:41] a difference between just simply
[30:43] producing some change in your life you
[30:46] know some some hard work you know some
[30:48] work ethic and actual deliverance actual
[30:52] changing what's down on the inside and
[30:54] so that's I guess a good place. So,
[30:57] stop. I'm out of time. And um we'll uh
[31:00] let's stand and have a word of prayer
[31:01] and we'll dismiss.
[31:07] Father, Lord, we
[31:10] come before you this morning. Hopefully,
[31:12] something that was said would be of
[31:13] benefit to the people. Trust that you
[31:16] would uh have have said something to
[31:19] benefit the people.
[31:22] Lord, that we could hold your hand and
[31:24] know that let your spirit move through
[31:27] us. Let your spirit anoint the word in
[31:29] our hearts to produce a work in us.
[31:31] Father, we could not produce it
[31:32] ourselves. That anything we would
[31:33] produce would be of a failure. But Lord,
[31:35] that what you produce would be right
[31:38] every time and would never fail. So we
[31:41] commit the people into your hands.
[31:43] Commit the service into your hands.
[31:46] It would go into the into the worship
[31:48] service, Lord, and into the into the um
[31:51] the preaching. Father, we trust that
[31:53] your spirit would go before us and that
[31:56] it' be a uh your anointing would be
[31:59] guiding the spirit, guiding the people,
[32:01] bringing us into an atmosphere of of
[32:03] unity, bringing us into an atmosphere of
[32:05] of having a of one mind and one accord
[32:08] that we could all be agreed upon your
[32:09] word this morning that your spirit could
[32:11] move. We ask these things in the name of
[32:13] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
