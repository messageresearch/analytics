[35:10] in all the world and so we just want to
[35:14] be ready have our minds ready for the
[35:17] word now
[35:18] i'm gonna invite you to first
[35:19] corinthians chapter 10 this morning
[35:22] amen want to look right into the word i
[35:24] sure appreciated
[35:25] all of that uh singing
[35:28] my so wonderful
[35:36] first corinthians 10 and we
[35:40] are going to catch those first
[35:43] 12 verses
[35:52] moreover brethren
[35:55] i would not that ye should be ignorant
[35:58] how that all our fathers were under the
[36:01] cloud
[36:03] and all passed through the sea now
[36:06] this is uh paul's gone about to use a
[36:09] teach a lesson by contrast so he's going
[36:12] to make the point
[36:13] first hey we all all our fathers
[36:17] came out all of them went through the
[36:19] red sea all right
[36:20] watch at verse 2 again
[36:23] and we're all baptized unto moses
[36:27] in the cloud and in the sea and
[36:30] did how many all eat the same spiritual
[36:34] meat
[36:35] and did how many all drink the same
[36:38] spiritual drink
[36:40] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[36:42] that followed them and that
[36:43] rock was christ but with how many
[36:48] many of them god was not well pleased
[36:52] for they were overthrown in the
[36:54] wilderness this is not all of them but
[36:56] many of them
[36:58] now these things here it is these things
[37:01] were for
[37:02] our examples to the
[37:05] intent we should not lust
[37:08] after evil things as they also
[37:11] lusted neither be ye idolaters
[37:15] as were some of them as it is written
[37:19] the people sat down to eat and drink
[37:22] and rose up to play neither let us
[37:25] commit
[37:26] fornication as some of them committed
[37:29] and fell in one day three and twenty
[37:33] thousand
[37:34] neither let us now this is the this is
[37:37] the ones who don't fall
[37:39] okay neither let us tempt
[37:42] christ as some of them the ones who fell
[37:45] also tempted and were destroyed of
[37:48] serpents
[37:49] now he's in a whole other example all
[37:52] right
[37:53] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[37:56] murmured
[37:57] and were destroyed of the destroyer now
[37:59] isn't a whole other example
[38:01] i mean he's trying to get the church to
[38:03] understand this is a repeating pattern
[38:06] so three's a witness right paul's saying
[38:09] i'm giving you three
[38:11] clear examples you all know what i'm
[38:13] talking about
[38:14] this is the mistake they made and this
[38:16] is exactly how it all
[38:18] came up came about verse 11.
[38:22] now all these things happened unto them
[38:27] for examples and they are written for
[38:30] our admonition upon whom the
[38:34] ends of the world are come
[38:38] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[38:40] standeth take
[38:41] heed lest he fall
[38:45] let's pray father we thank you for your
[38:49] word today master these divinely
[38:52] revealed truths that we
[38:54] have been given access to by your grace
[38:57] and your mercy alone
[38:58] so now i'm praying lord that you be with
[39:02] both
[39:02] speaker and hearer lord i
[39:06] have lots on my heart and
[39:09] plenty of material probably more than i
[39:12] can
[39:12] get to lord in a reasonable amount of
[39:14] time so i'm going to be looking to you
[39:16] now
[39:17] to make it efficient and ordered father
[39:21] so that it
[39:22] meet so that it hits the target father
[39:24] when we shoot an arrow of deliverance we
[39:26] want to make sure we hit the target
[39:28] father i want to bring this a death blow
[39:31] to the enemy's grip
[39:32] in our lives too often times he lives in
[39:35] our lives a long time lives in our home
[39:37] lives in our family and
[39:38] he just goes unchallenged well today
[39:41] lord we want to shoot at that guy
[39:43] father i want to see if we can put an
[39:45] arrow right in his heart i pray you'll
[39:46] grant it today lord
[39:48] in jesus name you see the great need
[39:50] master you see the need of the hour
[39:53] so we're looking to you father in jesus
[39:55] name
[39:56] amen god bless you friends you can be
[39:58] seated
[40:00] i want to continue by the help of the
[40:02] lord today on the greatest sign
[40:04] this will be part three as i would
[40:06] understand how they're titling it
[40:12] now there's a number of things that i
[40:15] started to
[40:16] put in put up today a number of quotes i
[40:19] decided not to i'm just going to
[40:20] reference them
[40:21] and kind of skip through them and not
[40:24] read them in their entirety perhaps so
[40:27] you just be a tentative and you make a
[40:29] mental note maybe you
[40:30] want to go home and read the whole the
[40:33] whole thing in context or
[40:35] better yet hear the whole sermon amen
[40:37] because you
[40:39] you can't hear you can't feed on too
[40:41] much of the word of god amen
[40:43] so we were thinking today along this
[40:47] line
[40:48] that all of these things happened unto
[40:50] them for our examples they're written
[40:53] for our admonition upon whom
[40:57] the ends of the world are come so now
[41:00] that's us just
[41:04] absorb that that's us we're right here
[41:07] you're the ones he's speaking to and we
[41:10] realize
[41:11] that yeah paul said it to the age he
[41:13] lived in
[41:14] and yeah it was a 2 000 year old
[41:17] statement brother jason that's a 2
[41:19] 000 year old statement you know upon
[41:22] whom the ends of the world have come but
[41:25] that's why
[41:27] i don't often say
[41:30] oftentimes i amend the term we're at the
[41:33] end time
[41:34] and you've heard me amend it and i say
[41:36] we're not merely
[41:37] at the end time because the the last
[41:40] days plural
[41:41] are the last two thousand years brother
[41:44] i'm taught us that over and over
[41:45] that's why it says in the last days and
[41:47] there's an s on there
[41:49] because a day with the lord is a
[41:50] thousand years and so in the last
[41:52] two days or the last 2000 years brother
[41:55] ram says that over and over and over and
[41:57] over again
[41:58] and so we realize that we're not just
[42:01] merely
[42:02] in the last days we're at the end of the
[42:05] last days
[42:06] we're not just merely at the end time
[42:08] we're at the end of the
[42:10] end time all right so now nothing's out
[42:13] of cater the scripture's perfectly in
[42:15] line
[42:16] but just understand this friends that
[42:19] the bride of christ
[42:20] leaves the seventh age and goes in a
[42:22] rapture there's not another age this
[42:24] thing
[42:25] you understand it can't it can't
[42:29] it cannot just keep going on and on and
[42:32] on
[42:32] there's no more margin now there's no
[42:34] more age there's
[42:36] he only had seven stars in his right
[42:39] hand
[42:39] and they've all been expended there's no
[42:43] more stars left
[42:44] the the last thing we see happening is a
[42:47] bride who has taken the book
[42:49] and eaten the book has become the book
[42:52] and is now a
[42:53] living voice not redoing the shout amen
[42:57] see not an eighth messenger but uh
[43:00] the final voice under her messenger and
[43:03] and her voice is a living voice
[43:07] it's a voice of lived life so when the
[43:09] world
[43:11] when the world looks around
[43:14] and they see madness they have another
[43:17] book they can read and that's you and
[43:20] when everything when all the news
[43:22] headlines
[43:24] are nothing but doom and gloom wouldn't
[43:26] it be nice
[43:27] if your neighbor could actually read
[43:30] your headline and go
[43:31] well there's hope yet
[43:33] [Applause]
[43:34] that's what i want to be able to do
[43:36] friends that's the that's the life
[43:38] that's the impact that i want to have
[43:40] because i'm here to tell you
[43:41] you're supposed to have an impact
[43:45] we were so fed this morning on brother
[43:47] jd's sunday school lesson on humility
[43:50] i just hope and trust and i don't need
[43:53] you to fill out a questionnaire we're
[43:55] not about that we're not a denomination
[43:58] i just hope and trust that you're if for
[44:01] those of you who aren't here we started
[44:02] a class with four people
[44:04] and i and thank god many more came in
[44:06] write it write it read it the buzzer
[44:08] and uh we had a nice crowd but and but
[44:10] my trust is
[44:11] that you're all catching the stream or
[44:14] you're going back and get the archive
[44:16] because what he's covering these
[44:17] characteristics of god
[44:19] i ca i could not overstate the
[44:22] the vital importance that they are
[44:25] because what they're teaching you is
[44:27] is how to be the bride of jesus christ
[44:30] because if you're going to be his bride
[44:32] it's not winning a lottery
[44:34] it means that you have become something
[44:37] you didn't just get a mantle put on you
[44:39] you've turned into something
[44:41] you've been created into something
[44:42] you've been recreated
[44:44] you're now being molded according to the
[44:47] image god had and what are you
[44:48] you're a continuation
[44:52] you're part of a plan you're part of
[44:56] god's plans
[44:57] absorb this you ready you're part of
[45:00] god's plans
[45:01] 6 000 years in the making
[45:05] you've arrived amen you are those
[45:08] upon whom the ends of the earth
[45:11] of the world have come and
[45:15] and the and the bride knows what
[45:18] he wants done with his word that is
[45:21] significant
[45:22] two things were so significant for this
[45:25] bride
[45:25] under her messenger as the final voice
[45:28] she has firstly
[45:29] thus saith the lord or she keeps still
[45:32] but also
[45:32] and not necessarily an order of
[45:34] importance but also
[45:36] she knows what he wants done with his
[45:39] word
[45:40] and and you say well how how does she
[45:42] know is is this
[45:43] book learning is this some kind of uh
[45:45] doctrinal education no
[45:47] you know it's you know i i don't need
[45:50] you to put a book in front of my face
[45:53] that tells me i love sister debbie
[45:57] you could stack a thousand of them that
[45:59] say i don't and i would burn them
[46:02] they would mean nothing to me you
[46:06] couldn't disprove it to me
[46:07] i don't care what laboratory i don't
[46:09] care what scientific experiment
[46:11] you couldn't disprove it to me because i
[46:13] say i know it's there how do you know
[46:15] because i do
[46:15] i know it's there you can't put love
[46:19] under a microscope
[46:21] and so the bride knows what he wants
[46:23] done with his word and
[46:24] and and she in humility his brother jd
[46:27] was talking today
[46:28] that's how she finds it that's how she's
[46:30] the final voice that's how she knows
[46:32] what he wants done with his word because
[46:34] she's not trying to go off in her own
[46:36] self-esteem
[46:38] running her own accomplishments she
[46:41] stays humble
[46:42] i thought that was that was quite an
[46:44] image today brother jason was talking
[46:46] about
[46:47] ships of war in perfect battle formation
[46:49] that's a thing
[46:51] lots of things you ever seen the seventh
[46:53] fleet out in the out in the ocean it's
[46:55] quite an amazing thing when they're in
[46:57] battle
[46:57] battle order and you've got the aircraft
[47:00] carriers and they're flanked by
[47:01] by frigates and and missile cruisers and
[47:04] destroyers and the submarines are
[47:05] underneath and the air
[47:06] the aircraft are overhead i mean this is
[47:09] this is this is the united states coming
[47:11] to deal a blow
[47:13] and so you realize that he said that
[47:16] that
[47:16] how that that that here
[47:20] you know when you rise up in your own
[47:23] arrogance
[47:24] and your own self-determination then god
[47:27] just understand that that's that fleet
[47:30] is coming after you
[47:32] and it's going to resist you
[47:35] and all your plans trying to go forward
[47:37] because you're trying to do it in your
[47:39] own
[47:40] self-interest in your own wit instead of
[47:43] being humble
[47:44] and let god and i i met by the gd in the
[47:46] back and we talked about i said don't
[47:48] you think it's also and he agreed
[47:50] that even if you are actually trying to
[47:53] accomplish
[47:54] god's plan for you to accomplish if you
[47:57] do it in self-assurance and arrogance
[48:00] god will even resist that
[48:03] say man i'm only trying to do his will
[48:05] well then be humble about it
[48:06] and let him be in control
[48:12] i'm here to tell you if you're his
[48:16] arrogant child
[48:19] you get how said that you are his child
[48:23] but you're you're determined to keep
[48:25] going your own way
[48:27] he will break you down
[48:30] and it'll all be done in love he will
[48:34] not allow you to have your own way
[48:36] because you are bought with the price
[48:39] you have been purchased you're not your
[48:41] own you don't own you he does
[48:44] he saved you from hell you were going to
[48:46] hell and there was nothing
[48:48] you could do if somebody didn't if
[48:49] somebody didn't throw you a lifeline but
[48:51] he did it today
[48:53] he threw a lifeline and pulled you into
[48:55] his his boat understand the ship of zion
[48:58] is his boat
[48:59] you don't suddenly get to decide your
[49:01] life you're on a ship headed for zion
[49:04] all right so so we realize that this is
[49:07] where
[49:08] the world is stumbling today
[49:12] and you know you know we we have arrived
[49:15] where
[49:16] um you know we we've all seen the the
[49:20] picture
[49:20] and boy are they that thing is hitting
[49:23] the headlines even among charismatic
[49:25] circles
[49:26] evangelicals they're already putting
[49:28] youtube up saying
[49:30] my goodness it looks like william
[49:31] branham was correct
[49:33] and they they seen kamala harris stand
[49:35] up there in her royal purple
[49:37] and they they go back and look at the
[49:39] prophet's words and
[49:41] it's it's and i'm i was getting emails
[49:43] from all over the world today have you
[49:44] seen this brother jason have you seen
[49:45] this and brother donnie had
[49:46] put it in the in the in the minister's
[49:49] chat the other day
[49:50] and they're already starting to talk
[49:51] about it to say wow
[49:53] i mean he he was on the money and they
[49:56] know that the next thing he saw
[50:00] that that was the last thing he saw
[50:02] before total annihilation
[50:05] he had already seen where technology
[50:10] uh crests when the bride is gone
[50:13] and of course mankind is always with his
[50:16] technology he's always still trying to
[50:18] go forward they're talking about
[50:20] a a lunar base they're talking about
[50:23] putting a man on mars
[50:24] but that level of technology is down the
[50:26] road and a prophet didn't see that
[50:29] what he saw was a pilotless car
[50:32] where a family could ride in a car and
[50:34] they wouldn't have to steer it
[50:36] and we're there that was the that was
[50:39] the zenith of
[50:40] technology that he saw before the bride
[50:42] was gone say how you know she was gone
[50:43] because everything got blown up and
[50:44] she's not here for that
[50:47] hallelujah
[50:50] now curiously or maybe that's the wrong
[50:53] word
[50:54] but ironically i should say i should
[50:57] maybe even say predictably
[51:00] i pointed out to my wife here this
[51:01] morning we were i said i want you to
[51:04] watch this
[51:04] 17-minute youtube of i forget the man's
[51:07] name
[51:08] big he's a big name among those
[51:10] charismatics and evangelicals and
[51:12] he was saying that um you know the first
[51:15] vision the second vision third vision he
[51:17] and he's and they all do this
[51:19] you watch they they hit about hitler and
[51:22] mussolini
[51:22] and communism and then they they make a
[51:25] big jump and they go to the pilotless
[51:27] car and then they go to a woman in power
[51:29] and then they say then the world was
[51:31] destroyed
[51:32] a country was destroyed i said you
[51:33] notice the one they always jump
[51:35] she said which one i said the immorality
[51:37] and the fall of women
[51:40] she said why did they do that i said
[51:41] because they can't say that
[51:43] they'll empty their churches overnight
[51:48] and then they'll have to do like us and
[51:49] walk by faith and just believe that
[51:51] if i if i have the carcass you eagles
[51:53] will gather
[51:54] hallelujah i'm so glad it's that way i'm
[51:57] so glad i'm not depending on a program
[51:59] or some denominational headquarters all
[52:02] i got to do is
[52:03] cook you a meal and have the carcass of
[52:05] the word and eagles will gather around
[52:08] that
[52:10] hallelujah and that's why brother
[52:13] branham said brother branham said
[52:15] i feel sorry for them they say brother
[52:19] man if i'd preach that
[52:20] then i i'd lose my status lose my
[52:22] ministry and brother branham said any
[52:24] ministry the word would destroy needs
[52:25] destroying
[52:28] so you know something friends we have
[52:30] more courage than we thought we had
[52:31] don't we
[52:33] faith runs runs deeper than we even
[52:36] realized
[52:37] i think maybe we could say i i know what
[52:39] he wants done with his word
[52:41] hallelujah what does he want done he
[52:43] wants your life to be given over to it
[52:45] he wants to see
[52:46] you here hearing and rejoicing over the
[52:48] word of god he wants to see you as a
[52:49] believer
[52:51] he wants to see you believe on him whom
[52:53] he hath sent
[52:55] you're already doing the works of god
[52:59] and and but but they jumped that part
[53:02] because they dare not
[53:04] touch that one and yet that's one of the
[53:06] ones brother branham
[53:08] talked about the most
[53:11] and so so we realized that that we've
[53:14] come to an hour now
[53:16] i mean that's just that's just recent
[53:19] to where now something that had been
[53:24] somewhat ambiguous is it in prophecy
[53:26] still
[53:27] has it partly is it the catholic church
[53:29] and if that's the case it's kind of
[53:31] already fulfilled kind of sort of in a
[53:32] way
[53:33] but now all of that kind of sort of in a
[53:35] way maybe kind of sort of is done
[53:37] gone that prophecy is history
[53:42] that all six prophecies
[53:45] are now history and you're living just
[53:49] before the seventh and you can't be here
[53:51] when the seventh one
[53:52] unfolds where are we
[53:57] you know where we are we are those upon
[53:58] whom the ends of the world have come
[54:01] you're in the last days you're in the
[54:03] end of the last days
[54:07] you know here's here's a concept that
[54:10] you need to understand
[54:12] all right where would i start to explain
[54:14] this
[54:15] all right let me try to keep it simple
[54:17] so
[54:18] you've heard we talk about it before
[54:20] brother branham taught us how that
[54:22] when you go back and you read the
[54:24] characteristics
[54:25] in the church ages and you read the
[54:28] seals about the white horse rider and
[54:29] the
[54:30] red and the black and the pale and you
[54:32] read the
[54:33] the complaints that he had in every age
[54:36] and
[54:36] i i i acknowledge your works and i know
[54:39] this and i know that but here's what the
[54:40] problem here's another problem here's
[54:41] another problem here's the problem
[54:42] right and brother madam says now
[54:45] remember all of that
[54:46] all of that historical all of those
[54:48] historical characteristics
[54:50] are all piled up and come into full
[54:52] steam in the last day
[54:54] so everything of the white horse
[54:56] deception and everything of the red
[54:58] horse and everything of the black horse
[54:59] is
[54:59] all wound up in the pale horses why it's
[55:01] pale it's grisly sickly
[55:04] see it's just a big conglomeration of
[55:06] colors that you normally wouldn't put
[55:07] together hoping to get something pretty
[55:10] and so so you find that that we have
[55:14] arrived at it
[55:15] so now so now just bear that concept in
[55:18] mind
[55:19] everything that has been will be again
[55:22] as solomon said and it's all heaped upon
[55:25] us now
[55:26] now the beauty of it is is every good
[55:28] thing everything of the lion
[55:31] who was the defender of the faith
[55:33] everything
[55:34] of the ox who gave the people the right
[55:36] kind of
[55:37] humble spirit everything in the man with
[55:39] the cunningness to
[55:41] to to rightly divide the word of truth
[55:43] and resist the
[55:44] uh the you know the theological takeover
[55:47] of the world
[55:48] and and then everything in the flying
[55:50] eagle it's all
[55:51] heaped up in the flying eagle and in
[55:53] fact is you're in the age where the
[55:55] anointing
[55:56] doesn't isn't isn't an earthbound
[55:59] creature
[56:01] so quite naturally it's a heavenly
[56:04] creature
[56:05] just like isaiah 60 says for you to
[56:07] arise
[56:08] just like in revelation chapter 4 the
[56:11] bride is in an order of ascending
[56:13] see of course she leaves the seventh age
[56:16] and goes in the rapture that
[56:17] that's absolutely clear but you can't
[56:20] separate chapter four from chapter five
[56:22] and chapter six and it all runs into
[56:24] chapter ten
[56:26] i mean this is god unfolding one step at
[56:29] a time
[56:29] until now we realize my goodness we've
[56:32] arrived we've got the full measure of
[56:35] everything amen good and bad
[56:39] see now if you think about
[56:42] how that these seals and the trumpets
[56:44] and the vials have all ran
[56:45] concurrently they've all run together
[56:47] and they all have an association
[56:48] especially the viles and trumpets
[56:50] because trump is what god's doing in
[56:52] israel all down just like the seals when
[56:54] you read the seals
[56:55] you're reading about the history of the
[56:56] church and things that went on back
[56:57] there right
[56:59] amen well the trumpets are the same
[57:01] thing only it's not the gentile church
[57:03] it's the jews
[57:04] and while the gentile church was being
[57:06] molded through ages jews were scattered
[57:08] around the world and god was moving in
[57:10] among them as a nation you got that and
[57:13] so
[57:13] so the the the vials then that that's
[57:17] why when you read
[57:18] the sixth trumpet you
[57:22] what do you have you you ha what's the
[57:25] sixth vial the sixth vial is the
[57:27] euphrates is dried up to make ways for
[57:28] the kings of the north
[57:30] all right everybody goes oh that's in a
[57:32] tribulation well i'm quite sure
[57:34] it'll have a magnificent uh application
[57:37] just like everything all down through
[57:38] the ages all through the seals all
[57:39] through the trumpets
[57:40] we'll all wind up in the in the time of
[57:42] of jacob's trouble amen
[57:44] but don't disregard what's happening
[57:47] right now and what has already happened
[57:48] in history
[57:49] because the sixth the sixth trumpet is
[57:52] the river euphrate
[57:53] the sixth vial is the river euphrates
[57:55] drying up the sixth trumpet
[57:57] is the 200 million special demon
[58:00] chargers released
[58:02] at euphrates how they get released
[58:05] because it dried up under the vial
[58:08] you understand now it may it may we you
[58:10] know you say is it going to have an
[58:11] application or is it actually going to
[58:13] dry them kings are going to come across
[58:15] it may happen i don't want to be here
[58:17] i'd rather not be able to answer that
[58:19] question
[58:19] i'd rather be on the other side safe
[58:22] home hallelujah
[58:24] and say oh yeah i did it did have an
[58:25] actual but don't dismiss what it's
[58:28] already
[58:29] unfolding they the vial is simply this
[58:31] here's here's a way to understand the
[58:32] vials
[58:33] the vials are simply god doing something
[58:36] to allow the antichrist to take another
[58:38] step
[58:39] that's what the vials are every time a
[58:41] vial
[58:42] is released it gave the antichrist
[58:44] another opportunity to step forward
[58:46] see so the sixth vial gave the enemy
[58:50] an opportunity under the sixth trumpet
[58:52] to release 200 million chargers
[58:55] against the jews that's easy isn't it
[58:57] you got you got me
[58:59] you're kind of blinking i hope i haven't
[59:01] bogged you down
[59:02] all right let i just want to set that in
[59:04] motion because i'm about to make a point
[59:06] so so now and so now in regards what am
[59:10] i saying that
[59:11] everything that has been in a measure is
[59:14] still being in a greater measure
[59:16] and will be in another greater measure
[59:18] when we're gone
[59:19] that's all okay so now
[59:22] now you can understand when somebody
[59:26] says
[59:27] and they look at some of these diseases
[59:29] and things that are falling on the world
[59:31] and say
[59:33] brother jason and i get this question
[59:34] could that be
[59:36] pre-tribulation and that's that's a
[59:38] thing though it's not a direct
[59:39] statement but we find that brother
[59:42] branham does
[59:42] point to it because remember that
[59:46] the judgments of god that are going to
[59:49] fall in the tribulation period
[59:52] began to fall in 1964
[59:57] when the earthquake struck alaska that
[1:00:00] brother branham pitched a rock up in the
[1:00:02] air and said thus saith the lord and
[1:00:03] brother rem set up and away it went
[1:00:05] headed west and he said and when it hit
[1:00:07] alaska that just switched its tail he
[1:00:09] said
[1:00:10] wait until that dragon comes down head
[1:00:12] and shoulders and sinks hollywood
[1:00:15] and now you're right in matthew 27
[1:00:17] matthew 28
[1:00:18] now you've got the word has been
[1:00:20] crucified an earthquake strikes on good
[1:00:22] friday
[1:00:23] come on friends this is real amen
[1:00:27] and then there's another earthquake
[1:00:28] comes and you know what it does it
[1:00:30] brings the sleeping saints back among us
[1:00:33] oh we're here we're here we're here
[1:00:35] we're here we're here we're here
[1:00:37] hallelujah and so you you find that
[1:00:41] these judgments have already
[1:00:43] begun and they're they're they they
[1:00:47] can't go in their full ride
[1:00:49] while we're still here the the pale
[1:00:51] horse rider
[1:00:53] where you say well where is he he's been
[1:00:55] named he was never named
[1:00:57] until the last messenger named him his
[1:00:59] death
[1:01:01] he had description of him but no one
[1:01:03] ever named him until brother branham
[1:01:05] comes on the scene today
[1:01:07] and says it's death it's it's man-made
[1:01:09] religion it's denominationalism
[1:01:13] and he identifies the work of that horse
[1:01:16] but he says
[1:01:16] he can't write his full right because
[1:01:19] there's an injunction
[1:01:21] and there's no court high enough to undo
[1:01:24] it
[1:01:25] there's an injunction on him that you
[1:01:28] that i'll uh
[1:01:29] he that letteth christ
[1:01:32] will let will hold i'll hold him
[1:01:36] until christ in you has been taken from
[1:01:38] the earth in a rapture
[1:01:40] and then the injunction's lifted so
[1:01:43] understand friends you might feel weak
[1:01:45] today you might feel not very much like
[1:01:48] a christian
[1:01:49] but the devil don't think that of you
[1:01:52] i know he might tell you that and i know
[1:01:55] he might be
[1:01:56] whispering it in your ears right now
[1:01:59] and you feel like the worst hypocrite in
[1:02:01] the world but understand
[1:02:03] the devil don't actually believe that
[1:02:05] about you he knows he can't even get on
[1:02:07] his horse
[1:02:08] because you're in the way
[1:02:14] this is part of the bride knowing who
[1:02:16] she is
[1:02:17] and knows what he wants done with his
[1:02:20] word
[1:02:20] why because she's humbled herself to it
[1:02:26] sometimes i feel like blowing up it just
[1:02:29] gets
[1:02:30] so big like brother dale told me one
[1:02:32] time he was standing across
[1:02:34] my yard and a fence he said man i got a
[1:02:36] humdinger for for wednesday night and i
[1:02:38] said really brother dale he said
[1:02:40] i i said it's so big it's it's i said
[1:02:42] how big is it he said it's too big
[1:02:44] i said what are you gonna do he said i
[1:02:45] don't know i'm just gonna walk out and
[1:02:46] just blow up
[1:02:51] so we we me and him have had that
[1:02:55] little wink kind of uh did you blow up
[1:03:00] how'd your service go man i blew up i
[1:03:01] didn't know what else to do i just come
[1:03:02] out and blew up
[1:03:05] and he gets it and i get it amen
[1:03:11] so okay now
[1:03:14] watch i'm gonna wake you up watch this
[1:03:18] i'm talking about i'm gonna make you
[1:03:19] aware of something in prophecy
[1:03:22] so now with this idea of partial
[1:03:27] pre-tribulation and full after the
[1:03:29] tribulation
[1:03:31] you're with me in full tribulation
[1:03:34] you can't buy or sell except you have
[1:03:37] that mark
[1:03:39] and brother branham said the bride does
[1:03:40] not see that she's already in glory
[1:03:43] see but now in pre-tribulation we've
[1:03:46] already had the alaska earthquake
[1:03:48] we've already got viruses and mutations
[1:03:50] of viruses
[1:03:51] and there's five more coming behind
[1:03:52] those and ten more behind those
[1:03:54] you understand that when they crucified
[1:03:57] the word that set off a cycle that
[1:03:59] doesn't end
[1:04:01] until the bride is in glory and the
[1:04:02] world goes into self-destruction
[1:04:04] you understand the rapture's on that
[1:04:07] that sets up a cycle for you
[1:04:09] and that also sets up an end game for
[1:04:12] the world
[1:04:13] and this thing is moving like a
[1:04:15] locomotive going down the tracks you
[1:04:17] can't stop it
[1:04:18] i don't care who they elect you're not
[1:04:20] going to stop it doesn't matter what
[1:04:22] they throw money at you're not going to
[1:04:23] fix it
[1:04:25] it's over mankind is now headed toward a
[1:04:29] certain end
[1:04:30] and it's rolling down the track and it's
[1:04:31] headed toward a cliff and i just say
[1:04:33] hide me in the rock lord jesus
[1:04:38] because we already see plagues falling
[1:04:40] we already see earthquakes falling that
[1:04:42] are going to have fullness
[1:04:44] we already know there's another one
[1:04:45] coming like the world hasn't seen
[1:04:48] and and if it follows matthew 27 and 28
[1:04:50] which brother branham talks about the
[1:04:52] events of matthew 27 repeat at the end
[1:04:53] time and we've seen it
[1:04:55] that's why alaska was struck on a good
[1:04:57] friday you know why because they
[1:04:58] crucified jesus on a good friday
[1:05:01] so it was an indication that that
[1:05:04] matches this
[1:05:05] was a good friday crucifixion and an
[1:05:08] earthquake
[1:05:09] when you killed him on the cross well
[1:05:11] guess what i'm going to bring another
[1:05:13] earthquake at the end time and i'm not
[1:05:15] going to have it on thursday
[1:05:16] and i'm not going to wait till saturday
[1:05:18] i'm going to hit it on good friday
[1:05:21] and my prophet will catch that and warn
[1:05:23] the people this is that
[1:05:26] and you're now you're caught in
[1:05:27] something now we're on the move now
[1:05:29] christ's been kicked out now he's called
[1:05:30] a church out now you're out
[1:05:32] now we're on now we're moving up amen
[1:05:35] satan's coming down hallelujah this
[1:05:38] bride
[1:05:39] in an order of ascending while satan is
[1:05:41] falling
[1:05:42] hallelujah revelation 12 sees him
[1:05:45] completely
[1:05:46] fallen woe into the earth for satan has
[1:05:49] come down to you
[1:05:52] this is happening in real time
[1:05:56] this is hd this is hd
[1:06:00] in real time and you're it
[1:06:05] you say why are you emphasizing that so
[1:06:07] hard because paul's warning
[1:06:11] they were in hd they were in real time
[1:06:14] they all went came out they all went
[1:06:16] through the sea they all drank of that
[1:06:18] water
[1:06:18] and paul says but not all of them
[1:06:20] pleased the lord
[1:06:22] many of them fell in the wilderness
[1:06:24] because they didn't
[1:06:26] they didn't do anything about the
[1:06:28] real-time situation
[1:06:30] they just had this idea we're just we're
[1:06:32] just here
[1:06:33] we're just passing time well i need to
[1:06:35] do this i need to do that i need to do
[1:06:37] this what you need to do is become
[1:06:38] this that's all that matters
[1:06:43] say well well i you know i i got a life
[1:06:46] to live and i got a family and i got a
[1:06:48] i got a career and i got education if if
[1:06:50] you caught the sunday school lesson this
[1:06:52] morning you'll understand
[1:06:53] it's not you deciding anything it's you
[1:06:55] humbling yourself so that he can decide
[1:06:57] your life
[1:06:58] because i'll promise you he will give
[1:07:02] you the best
[1:07:03] life you can imagine and it doesn't
[1:07:06] matter what crucibles or trials or
[1:07:08] afflictions you have to go through
[1:07:09] just understand father knows best
[1:07:12] and he makes it all beautiful in his
[1:07:16] time
[1:07:18] if you'll just be patient he turns it
[1:07:21] into something beautiful
[1:07:23] it's when you run ahead of him that you
[1:07:25] stumble and get in the way
[1:07:27] that's probably the last thing in the
[1:07:28] world i think i would just rather die
[1:07:30] than be
[1:07:31] found in the way of god just
[1:07:34] get out of his way let the holy spirit
[1:07:37] lead
[1:07:39] see he'll bring it to pass you don't
[1:07:42] have anything to worry about
[1:07:43] jesus said be anxious for nothing
[1:07:47] be anxious for nothing see your father
[1:07:50] knows what you have need of
[1:07:51] he's already got this so
[1:07:55] now post i mean during the tribulation
[1:07:59] period you can't buy or sell
[1:08:03] but did you know that
[1:08:06] you had i forget the number it was a
[1:08:09] large number
[1:08:11] of people conservatives
[1:08:14] who were making a living buying and
[1:08:18] selling
[1:08:20] with their youtube channels with their
[1:08:22] facebook channels
[1:08:23] with their instagrams with their social
[1:08:25] media platforms
[1:08:28] amen until the beast decides to
[1:08:32] shut them down for what
[1:08:35] they were saying say oh here we go into
[1:08:38] conspiracy
[1:08:39] conspiracy nothing it's all over the
[1:08:41] headlines
[1:08:42] congress is holding hearings over it
[1:08:44] because these big tech giants have
[1:08:46] have flexed their muscles and now you've
[1:08:49] got people
[1:08:50] who can't buy or sell
[1:08:53] except they agree with the system
[1:09:00] this ain't no joke this is happening in
[1:09:04] real time
[1:09:05] friends you're already seeing
[1:09:07] tribulation events happening here
[1:09:10] in a pre-preliminary way amen
[1:09:13] now the world is to run in fear but not
[1:09:16] the bride
[1:09:17] the bride has a different message lift
[1:09:20] up your head
[1:09:21] your redemption draweth nigh rejoice and
[1:09:24] be glad
[1:09:26] for you know many many old sages and
[1:09:29] saints and even angels
[1:09:31] looked in on and wanting to understand
[1:09:34] what
[1:09:34] you're understanding and you're not
[1:09:36] understanding it by by theology
[1:09:38] you're becoming it amen
[1:09:42] amen this is the hour they've all wanted
[1:09:44] and this is the hour god has called
[1:09:46] you too so you don't want to be
[1:09:53] here at this critical junction of time
[1:09:57] a junction is joining to the next event
[1:10:00] and we're in the final junction the next
[1:10:03] the junk the next event is tribulation
[1:10:05] the next event is vision number seven
[1:10:07] we're already gone
[1:10:08] when that unfolds
[1:10:12] so we find then friends that already
[1:10:15] the constitution is not going to protect
[1:10:17] your free speech much longer
[1:10:21] it's not going to protect you much
[1:10:22] longer say what's it going to look like
[1:10:24] i don't know
[1:10:25] i'm just going to preach the gospel
[1:10:27] somebody said what if they put you in
[1:10:29] jail i said then i'll convert the jail
[1:10:32] amen uh if they if they they threw
[1:10:34] joseph in jail thinking they did a good
[1:10:36] thing he converted the jailer and the
[1:10:38] prisoners and i mean the whole thing i
[1:10:40] mean wherever i am i'm gonna be
[1:10:42] casting out devils whatever happens to
[1:10:45] me i'm going to be keep preaching the
[1:10:46] word of god until death sets me free or
[1:10:49] i go on a rapture
[1:10:51] what about you what about the sermon of
[1:10:54] your life what are your plans for your
[1:10:57] life
[1:10:59] see so yes
[1:11:02] we plan like it could be another hundred
[1:11:04] years though i don't
[1:11:05] it has nothing to do with prophecy i
[1:11:07] don't see mankind being able to survive
[1:11:09] another hundred years he's so he's so
[1:11:12] far gone now
[1:11:14] i don't see how he could possibly
[1:11:15] survive another hundred
[1:11:17] but brother branham says nonetheless
[1:11:19] that that we do plan like that
[1:11:21] so you know if you're a farmer go ahead
[1:11:23] and plant your potatoes if you're in
[1:11:25] school go ahead and finish your
[1:11:26] education you need a career get a career
[1:11:28] fine but but live like he's coming in
[1:11:31] the morning
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:33] plan like it's a hundred years but live
[1:11:36] like it's in the morning
[1:11:38] see so brother branham comes to a point
[1:11:42] where he
[1:11:43] he makes um
[1:11:46] this statement and just be prepared
[1:11:49] g-man with that uh
[1:11:50] image just in a moment so
[1:11:54] brother branham says in the breach
[1:11:58] he starts telling the testimony
[1:12:01] you're familiar with it of he was in
[1:12:04] sabine praying and he said i had my
[1:12:06] hands up
[1:12:08] he's wondering about his ministry about
[1:12:10] his life he heard a great explosion he
[1:12:12] thought nobody could survive it
[1:12:14] uh and he's wondering he said but i
[1:12:17] heard
[1:12:18] joseph's voice saying daddy he said i
[1:12:20] thought well if it would have
[1:12:21] got me it would have got him how so he's
[1:12:24] all in a confusion
[1:12:25] you know and the lord is going to show
[1:12:27] him it's not the end of your life it's
[1:12:30] your ministry
[1:12:31] you see now his in the end of his life
[1:12:33] was going to be a couple more years out
[1:12:36] but it was a ministry change and a sword
[1:12:39] he said a sword something struck my hand
[1:12:41] and he looked
[1:12:42] and he said it was a sword now it's
[1:12:45] contrary to his nature because he didn't
[1:12:47] like knives he didn't like swords he
[1:12:48] said i was so glad
[1:12:50] i wasn't alive in that day when they
[1:12:52] fought with swords
[1:12:53] some he didn't like the idea of being
[1:12:55] run through with cold steel
[1:12:57] somehow getting shot doesn't matter but
[1:12:59] i don't want to be
[1:13:01] stabbed with a sword so i think maybe i
[1:13:04] get it too
[1:13:05] so so so he he he
[1:13:08] he's noticing he says now watch now i
[1:13:13] oh he okay so he first talks about the
[1:13:15] the guard
[1:13:16] remember and he says made of pearl so
[1:13:19] beautiful and the
[1:13:21] s and the blade he said just
[1:13:24] not very long but razor-sharp
[1:13:28] which if you study if you study the
[1:13:31] history of
[1:13:32] you know of of war swords
[1:13:36] you'll find that that short sword that's
[1:13:38] what the zulus used
[1:13:39] that's what the romans used they didn't
[1:13:41] use a big long
[1:13:43] broadsword the guys who did that were
[1:13:45] nights and got killed
[1:13:47] because they wanted a short story a
[1:13:49] short sword
[1:13:50] so that you because you're this is going
[1:13:52] to be almost hand-to-hand combat
[1:13:55] so that's where we are god hasn't given
[1:13:57] you a standoff weapon
[1:13:59] he's given you a weapon for close hand
[1:14:01] combat
[1:14:02] i mean the enemy's on you he's trying to
[1:14:05] get inside your house
[1:14:08] trying to get inside the heart of your
[1:14:10] children you're going to need a sword
[1:14:12] and brother branham said it wasn't too
[1:14:14] long
[1:14:14] but glistening and razor sharp
[1:14:18] just razor sharp
[1:14:21] and so he said now now he picks up the
[1:14:24] scene he says now in
[1:14:25] dueling and he says i don't understand
[1:14:28] one word of it
[1:14:28] but are one principle of dueling but the
[1:14:31] best of my
[1:14:32] understanding the knife striking across
[1:14:36] finally
[1:14:39] the swords if they lock
[1:14:44] if they lock the enemy and
[1:14:47] you lock swords
[1:14:51] then it takes the strength of the man
[1:14:54] dueling
[1:14:55] because see his sword is pointed to my
[1:14:59] heart
[1:15:00] and mine is pointed at his heart see
[1:15:04] that they're locked as our knives come
[1:15:07] together we're trying to kill each other
[1:15:10] i'm not trying to wound the enemy i'm
[1:15:11] trying to destroy him and he's not just
[1:15:13] trying to hinder you or give you a bad
[1:15:15] day
[1:15:15] he's trying to kill you he's trying to
[1:15:18] destroy your influence trying to destroy
[1:15:20] your children he's trying to kill him
[1:15:22] see so that's why we say don't flirt
[1:15:24] with him he's a killer
[1:15:26] he doesn't just want to give you bad
[1:15:28] luck he doesn't just want to give you
[1:15:31] you know a bad day he wants to destroy
[1:15:34] you
[1:15:35] and so he says and they strike and then
[1:15:37] the swords come together
[1:15:40] and whichever one can shove the other
[1:15:42] one down
[1:15:44] the sword is straight to the heart now
[1:15:47] here is the bombshell you ready
[1:15:51] say well my sword is the word
[1:15:56] i gotta i got the word brother brahman
[1:15:58] said
[1:15:59] even though the sword be the word
[1:16:03] it takes the hand of strong
[1:16:07] faith to hold it there to bring it
[1:16:11] to the heart of the enemy
[1:16:14] amen see now that's in the breach this
[1:16:17] is why brother branham would come along
[1:16:19] later in the fourth seal
[1:16:21] because in the breach he doesn't have he
[1:16:23] doesn't know the first seal yet
[1:16:25] and he's giving this principle an
[1:16:26] accurate principle that's going to
[1:16:28] really have a lot to say later on when
[1:16:30] the seals actually start to break
[1:16:32] and in the fourth seal brother branham
[1:16:34] says now we had him coming last night
[1:16:36] with a sword and we find out he gets
[1:16:39] killed by that sword
[1:16:40] and brother brahm said the sword of the
[1:16:42] word to put him right down
[1:16:43] because that's what he's trying to fight
[1:16:44] with and he's uh he's a trespasser he's
[1:16:46] got no right to it
[1:16:47] right and false teaching amen so
[1:16:50] so that's his sword of influence on the
[1:16:52] world and he's
[1:16:53] he's taught them easy believism he's
[1:16:56] taught them that you don't need the holy
[1:16:57] ghost he's taught them that it doesn't
[1:16:58] matter how you live
[1:17:00] oh it matters that's what paul is trying
[1:17:03] to get across to the church it matters
[1:17:05] see and and he says he says wait till
[1:17:09] that group
[1:17:10] rises up there that seven thunders group
[1:17:12] who can
[1:17:13] hand that sword and brother branham
[1:17:15] doesn't say handle it
[1:17:18] he doesn't say handle it understand
[1:17:21] he says hand it a hand is at the end of
[1:17:24] an arm
[1:17:25] and therefore wait till that group rises
[1:17:28] up
[1:17:28] who's at the end of god's arm that group
[1:17:32] who can
[1:17:32] accomplish his word and accomplish his
[1:17:35] will
[1:17:36] it'll slice and cut and of course that
[1:17:38] has a big application
[1:17:39] under moses and elijah brother branham
[1:17:41] makes that clear under the sixth
[1:17:42] seal that the ones who close the heavens
[1:17:45] and do all of that that's moses and
[1:17:46] elijah that's not our ministry
[1:17:48] as brother matt and brother jason been
[1:17:50] been teaching on and
[1:17:51] the article they're writing we've got to
[1:17:53] keep that separate but there is an
[1:17:55] application
[1:17:56] to us for it here that you're that
[1:17:59] you're literally he has no hands but
[1:18:01] your hand there's no feet but your feet
[1:18:02] no mouth but your mouth
[1:18:03] but it's going to take a strong arm of
[1:18:06] faith a strong
[1:18:07] hand uh it takes the hand of
[1:18:10] strong faith the hand is you it's going
[1:18:13] to take strong faith
[1:18:14] and to give you the strength to bring
[1:18:17] the sword of the word
[1:18:18] to slay your enemy and i'm here to tell
[1:18:21] you
[1:18:21] it's you or him
[1:18:25] face it either you kill him
[1:18:28] or he kills you either you he's coming
[1:18:32] for your children
[1:18:33] fathers you're the only one who can stop
[1:18:35] him
[1:18:36] he's coming for your babies mama you're
[1:18:38] the one who can stop him
[1:18:40] hallelujah is coming for your church
[1:18:42] pastor i have a responsibility
[1:18:44] to stop him today how am i doing i'm
[1:18:48] preaching the word and cast out
[1:18:50] devils takes authority over the enemy
[1:18:53] we'll tell you something friends we have
[1:18:55] not followed cunningly devised
[1:18:57] tales we are not eating the opinions of
[1:19:00] a man we are feeding on the body word
[1:19:02] of the son of man it's a living word
[1:19:05] it's a bleeding word
[1:19:06] it's a powerful word it'll put the enemy
[1:19:09] down
[1:19:12] if it's wielded in a hand of strong
[1:19:14] faith
[1:19:17] see the further we go along
[1:19:20] the more i realized
[1:19:24] that this has really been one of the
[1:19:25] biggest letdowns
[1:19:28] among god's people and preachers
[1:19:33] is a life that surrenders
[1:19:38] on a daily basis and
[1:19:41] lives in the spirit constantly
[1:19:45] to have the faith to handle the sword
[1:19:52] to wield the sword of the word against
[1:19:55] this enemy
[1:19:57] you know everybody loves rejoicing over
[1:20:01] the word it thrills us
[1:20:03] amen indeed it does but we remember
[1:20:07] that satan is not afraid of how
[1:20:10] religious you are
[1:20:12] and he doesn't care this is
[1:20:15] top secret intel this is insider trading
[1:20:20] it should be illegal for you to know
[1:20:21] this
[1:20:24] but we had a prophet who knows we had a
[1:20:27] prophet who told us what satan
[1:20:29] thinks of when he's in his bed chamber
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:33] and he says satan doesn't care how
[1:20:36] religious you are
[1:20:38] i'll just go to church more he doesn't
[1:20:39] care he'll help you
[1:20:42] you lose your keys he'll find them for
[1:20:43] you
[1:20:45] he doesn't care say well we got brother
[1:20:48] jason
[1:20:49] we got brother jason watkins we got
[1:20:51] brother matt watkins we got brother
[1:20:52] jason demars we got good teachers satan
[1:20:55] doesn't care how right you
[1:20:56] are in your teaching he doesn't care how
[1:21:00] religious you are he doesn't care how
[1:21:01] right you are in your doctrine
[1:21:04] because here's his great secret that he
[1:21:06] didn't want you to know what a prophet
[1:21:07] out of him
[1:21:08] he he knows that it's that as long as
[1:21:11] you miss that
[1:21:12] life see you won't you won't come up in
[1:21:15] the resurrection and more than that you
[1:21:16] won't be able to put the sword to his
[1:21:18] heart
[1:21:19] because your hand won't be strong enough
[1:21:22] and you'll sit back and watch one at a
[1:21:25] time as your children are sifted by the
[1:21:27] devil you watch
[1:21:28] one at a time as your family and your
[1:21:30] marriage is sifted by the devil you'll
[1:21:32] just sit back and watch it
[1:21:33] powerless god got a sword of the word in
[1:21:36] your home and not enough strength in
[1:21:38] your hand to use it
[1:21:42] see listen teenagers
[1:21:45] this is on you you you reach a point in
[1:21:48] your life where
[1:21:49] mama can't do it for you there there was
[1:21:51] a time when mama or daddy swung the
[1:21:53] sword for you but hey
[1:21:54] the sword is in your lap today teenager
[1:21:57] what are you going to do with jesus
[1:21:59] called the christ
[1:22:00] you're going to need a strong hand of
[1:22:02] faith to put down the enemy
[1:22:04] amen don't y'all go to get quiet on me
[1:22:08] now
[1:22:10] so satan's not afraid of those things
[1:22:13] see
[1:22:14] so so then that to me
[1:22:17] this is what i want god to keep at the
[1:22:19] front of my mind at all times
[1:22:22] that that that that rich spiritual life
[1:22:27] and that is available to us as
[1:22:30] individuals
[1:22:32] and and and because i mean listen
[1:22:36] we get the word for free
[1:22:40] come on that's just god's grace
[1:22:43] i get the word for free preaching is the
[1:22:45] easiest part of pastoring because i get
[1:22:47] it for free
[1:22:49] sometimes i don't even sometimes he
[1:22:51] makes me labor and
[1:22:52] go through and burn the midnight oil but
[1:22:54] not all times sometimes
[1:22:56] i can be driving down the road and in
[1:22:58] six and a half minutes he'll give me a
[1:22:59] whole sermon i'll try to drive a not
[1:23:01] wreck and write a sermon or record my
[1:23:02] voice
[1:23:03] and come in here and turn it into an
[1:23:04] hour and ten minutes sermon to you
[1:23:07] see but so so so a lot of times you sit
[1:23:11] here
[1:23:11] you get all this great preaching you
[1:23:13] know we get revelation
[1:23:15] for free because that just comes down
[1:23:18] from the father of lights
[1:23:20] that comes down from him who is above
[1:23:22] all good things come down
[1:23:24] from the father of lights and so you
[1:23:26] know and
[1:23:27] and so so now so now when we
[1:23:30] when we think about what is incumbent
[1:23:32] upon us
[1:23:33] if we get the word for free and we get
[1:23:36] the revelation for free
[1:23:37] that comes down from the father of
[1:23:39] lights but it's that
[1:23:41] but now there's we got to talk about
[1:23:43] that spiritual
[1:23:44] life that re that that requires
[1:23:48] a willingness to be a prisoner
[1:23:52] and there's the rub because this guy
[1:23:55] doesn't like that that's right amen
[1:23:59] remember when i was preaching wednesday
[1:24:01] and we we read from david
[1:24:04] that he talks about his enemies that
[1:24:06] they just
[1:24:07] destroyed his soul and and uh and i said
[1:24:10] to you
[1:24:11] there's no enemy closer to your soul
[1:24:14] than your own flesh
[1:24:17] the man in the mirror is always your
[1:24:19] greatest enemy see
[1:24:21] and so it requires that willingness to
[1:24:23] become a prisoner and that's why brother
[1:24:25] branham
[1:24:27] that's why brother branham well you're
[1:24:29] familiar i'll slow myself down
[1:24:31] trying to go book to book but you've
[1:24:33] read your bible enough to know
[1:24:35] that paul would start one letter and he
[1:24:37] would say paul an apostle
[1:24:39] of jesus christ remember that or he
[1:24:41] might say you know
[1:24:43] not by the will of god i mean not by the
[1:24:45] will of man but by the spirit of god
[1:24:47] see paul an apostle or you might say
[1:24:49] paul a servant
[1:24:50] and timothy our brother paul is you know
[1:24:53] he's got all of these
[1:24:54] entry introductions establishing his
[1:24:57] ministry
[1:24:58] but when he comes to the book of
[1:24:59] philemon he uses a term that he never
[1:25:00] uses anywhere else
[1:25:02] he says paul a prisoner
[1:25:06] and brother branham now paul talks about
[1:25:08] being a prisoner in
[1:25:10] different places in the in his letters
[1:25:11] that's for sure
[1:25:13] but this is the only letter he opens it
[1:25:15] up with that line
[1:25:17] brother branham talks about this in paul
[1:25:18] a prisoner and he says paul opened he
[1:25:20] said now brother and says now
[1:25:22] to be an apostle that you can't that's
[1:25:25] just god
[1:25:26] gotta do that god has to call that to be
[1:25:28] his servant you don't get to choose
[1:25:29] that's god
[1:25:30] calling you to be his servant he said
[1:25:33] but
[1:25:34] to be his prisoner you have to decide
[1:25:37] to do that you have to decide
[1:25:41] she said god has called me to be a
[1:25:43] member of his bride but are you a
[1:25:44] prisoner
[1:25:45] amen see and so brother branham's
[1:25:49] imagery then of the two swordsmen in
[1:25:51] this life and death struggle is so vivid
[1:25:55] when he's telling this story it's so
[1:25:57] vivid because
[1:25:58] it it in this position at
[1:26:02] at this stage of the duel
[1:26:05] where we are 20 21. i'm here to tell you
[1:26:08] something friends at this stage of the
[1:26:10] duel
[1:26:11] only two outcomes are possible here at
[1:26:14] the end time
[1:26:16] either the enemy is defeated or i'm
[1:26:18] defeated
[1:26:19] but compromise somewhere in the middle
[1:26:21] we're going to sign a treaty that's not
[1:26:23] possible we've arrived at the end
[1:26:27] and we've arrived at the locking of
[1:26:30] swords
[1:26:31] and i want you to be aware that today
[1:26:33] that's why i took paul's
[1:26:35] admonition in first corinthians that's
[1:26:37] why we talked about
[1:26:39] you can't buy or sell we already see it
[1:26:41] happening that's why we talk about
[1:26:43] the earthquakes that are taking place
[1:26:44] and they've already started that's why
[1:26:46] we correlated
[1:26:47] down through the ages all of those beast
[1:26:49] writers those powers and anointings of
[1:26:51] the
[1:26:51] white horse and red horse and black
[1:26:53] horse and the and the lion and the ox
[1:26:55] and the man and now it's knots to the
[1:26:57] pale horse and through the flying eagle
[1:26:58] it you understand that you you're on a
[1:27:01] journey god this whole time god
[1:27:03] life's not just been happening
[1:27:06] you're all your part brother branham
[1:27:07] said to god it's all a great
[1:27:09] drama and we're all involved in this
[1:27:13] we're all
[1:27:14] players in this and i'm here to tell you
[1:27:15] we've arrived at the locking of the
[1:27:18] swords that's how overrun
[1:27:22] the world is with wickedness the days of
[1:27:25] noah which had already struck the world
[1:27:30] the days of lot which had already struck
[1:27:32] the world
[1:27:34] but now we come to a convergence of
[1:27:36] those two
[1:27:37] times that jesus said is coming now that
[1:27:40] never happened
[1:27:41] in any age the bible told about how that
[1:27:43] there would be a time when satan would
[1:27:45] be the god of thee
[1:27:46] of the age that had never happened until
[1:27:48] now
[1:27:50] and here we are in the convergence of it
[1:27:52] all the days of noah complete the days
[1:27:55] of lot
[1:27:56] complete the next level surely surely
[1:27:59] is the tribulation period so i'm here to
[1:28:02] tell you something that
[1:28:03] friend the fight is ready to be decided
[1:28:07] in individuals the fight is now
[1:28:11] being decided by individuals
[1:28:16] they all went out of egypt we all
[1:28:18] followed the message they all passed
[1:28:20] through the red sea
[1:28:21] they all we all got baptized they all
[1:28:23] drank from that spiritual rock which was
[1:28:24] christ
[1:28:25] you've done that sunday after sunday
[1:28:26] after sunday but with not all of them
[1:28:28] was he well pleased
[1:28:30] some of them were overthrown in the
[1:28:32] wilderness
[1:28:33] i'm here to tell you you're in the time
[1:28:34] of locking swords
[1:28:36] and it's going to take a life of
[1:28:38] sincerity before god
[1:28:40] who's willing to be a prisoner willing
[1:28:43] to be a prisoner
[1:28:44] that means you're willing to lay aside
[1:28:46] the weights and the sins
[1:28:47] that death so easily beset us you're
[1:28:49] ready to run this race with patience
[1:28:55] we've arrived
[1:29:00] only one person's gonna walk away from
[1:29:01] this battle alive
[1:29:03] amen you get me
[1:29:06] amen the battle you're in
[1:29:09] at this junction of time six of the
[1:29:13] seven
[1:29:13] visions already history
[1:29:18] tribulation plagues and judgments
[1:29:23] and power grabs from the beast already
[1:29:26] happening in pre-tribulation
[1:29:29] the swords in your hand the enemy comes
[1:29:32] with his sword the seventh under group
[1:29:34] is on the scene
[1:29:37] who's going to win you can't both win
[1:29:41] that one you're in a duel with you're
[1:29:43] locked in a life and death struggle
[1:29:45] and there's not two people going to
[1:29:47] leave this battle alive
[1:29:48] only one person
[1:29:52] this is an epic battle it's a final
[1:29:54] battle
[1:29:57] and god is god says and i'm gonna i'm
[1:29:59] gonna pause with this because if i take
[1:30:01] another
[1:30:01] step i'll need more time and i i don't
[1:30:04] want to do that
[1:30:07] filling in my spirit just stop right
[1:30:09] here you've had you've heard enough
[1:30:11] but i want to give you this last point i
[1:30:13] still got you
[1:30:21] god has said to you
[1:30:24] god has notified you
[1:30:28] you're in the greatest battle ever
[1:30:31] ever fought there's never been a day
[1:30:36] like this day
[1:30:39] you're facing things your family's
[1:30:41] facing things
[1:30:42] humanity and all of its history
[1:30:46] has never encountered as a convergence
[1:30:51] the lid there's another one torn off of
[1:30:55] hell
[1:30:56] never happened till now demon powers
[1:30:59] streaming into the earth
[1:31:03] 200 million demon chargers
[1:31:06] held at the river euphrates released
[1:31:09] under the sixth trumpet because a vile
[1:31:12] has a has a has a correlation and allows
[1:31:15] the enemy to take another step and he
[1:31:17] goes after the jews
[1:31:19] and we have all of that holocaust in
[1:31:21] first and second woe
[1:31:22] and these woes have already passed and
[1:31:24] now there cometh one more woe
[1:31:27] and you're you're right in that last
[1:31:29] you're right up against the wall
[1:31:31] and the next event on the other side of
[1:31:33] this wall is global tribulation
[1:31:36] and before we push through that wall the
[1:31:38] bride takes off
[1:31:41] that's where we are friends it's an epic
[1:31:45] final battle and god's word
[1:31:50] tells me that he has sent a word
[1:31:53] in this day
[1:31:56] for you to feed on so
[1:31:59] you should be feeding on this but i mean
[1:32:02] come on

[1:32:28] enough to hold this
[1:32:30] how do you expect to bring it to the
[1:32:31] heart of the enemy
[1:32:33] when when hollywood has your attention
[1:32:35] more than this
[1:32:36] your career has your attention more than

[1:48:02] intercede
[1:48:02] for ignorance don't ever let anybody
