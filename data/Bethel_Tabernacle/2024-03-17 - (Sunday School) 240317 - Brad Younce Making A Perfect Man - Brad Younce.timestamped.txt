[0:30] brother strength Lord be with brother
[0:32] Jason this morning as he brings forth
[0:34] the word to minister to us we ask in
[0:37] Jesus name
[0:40] amen you turn these monitors
[0:44] down um if you have your bibl let's turn
[0:47] to Second Peter chapter

[1:27] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:29] Christ
[1:30] may God add His blessings you can have
[1:32] your
[1:34] seats I put a title to this to making of
[1:39] a perfect
[1:41] man the definition of
[1:43] make is to bring in into being by
[1:48] forming you know Genesis says in the
[1:52] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:54] earth that the Earth was without form
[1:55] and void and so what he done he started
[1:57] bringing it into being so to make is to
[2:00] bring into being by
[2:01] forming shaping or altering a material
[2:06] amen so if we're going to be made
[2:08] perfect who you going to be made after
[2:11] what image is God wanting us to be
[2:14] because he tells us in Matthew 5:48 be
[2:17] ye therefore
[2:18] perfect which that definition is brought
[2:21] to its end finished amen be ye therefore
[2:26] perfect even as your father which is in
[2:28] heaven is perfect
[2:30] wanting
[2:31] nothing necessary is completed amen so
[2:36] whatever perfect is if you're perfect
[2:38] this morning you're
[2:39] completed you have reached the goal and
[2:42] I was speaking to the youth uh Friday
[2:46] night we started a little little thing
[2:47] on the Holy Spirit what is the Holy
[2:49] Spirit and brother I read a quote where
[2:51] brother Bram says that the
[2:53] goal that our our goal should be to
[2:57] obtain the Holy Ghost and I kind of miss
[3:00] it to them like it was our ultimate goal
[3:02] the ultimate goal is to receive the Holy
[3:04] Ghost now if you rece I told him if you
[3:05] receive the holy ghost in your soul you
[3:08] have reached that ultimate goal because
[3:10] your but we know brother BR says once
[3:12] you got your Holy Ghost your soul is
[3:13] already in
[3:15] eternity but there's things that has to
[3:17] take place as we go along becoming a
[3:19] Christian we have another goal we have a
[3:22] goal to reach the stature of a perfect
[3:25] man you know brother BR preached that
[3:26] message if he ain't heard it in a while
[3:27] you should go back and and listen to it
[3:30] it's a stature of perfect man he didn't
[3:32] say statue of a perfect man you know
[3:35] what a statue is it just something
[3:36] stands up strong and it don't move and
[3:38] it's it's hard and solid but a stature
[3:41] the stature is a quality or a status
[3:44] gained by growth or development or
[3:50] achievement Man full grown you're an
[3:55] adult a full age you're
[3:58] mature so that's why would become a
[4:00] perfect person so what what is it be ye
[4:03] therefore perfect even as your father
[4:05] which is in heaven is perfect that's who
[4:09] would be making into the image of of God
[4:12] so you know one day you were born in
[4:14] sin you come to the world speaking Lies
[4:17] We Were Lost we had no hope we were
[4:20] wandering around in the darkness we were
[4:22] without form and void we weren't in any
[4:25] shape any form that God could even use
[4:28] us
[4:30] we were just a bunch of
[4:32] heathens walking around that's what we
[4:35] were bunch of heathens because he
[4:37] without God you're a
[4:38] heathen doing what we wanted to do but
[4:42] all we needed was a
[4:44] Potter not just any Potter but the
[4:48] Potter we didn't need any man to come
[4:50] and mold us but we needed the man the
[4:53] man Christ Jesus in Jeremiah
[4:56] 18:1 it says the word which came to
[4:59] Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise go
[5:03] down to The Potter's House and there I
[5:05] will cause thee to hear my words and
[5:08] then I went down to The Potter's House
[5:10] and behold he wrought a work on the
[5:12] wheels amen and the vessel that he made
[5:15] of clay was marred in the hand of the
[5:18] Potter so he made it again another
[5:21] vessel has seemed good to the Potter to
[5:24] make it and then the word of the Lord
[5:26] came unto me saying oh House of Israel
[5:31] or should I say oh bethl Tabernacle can
[5:34] I not do with you as this Potter sayith
[5:38] the Lord behold as the clay is in The
[5:40] Potter's hand so are ye in my hands oh
[5:44] bethl Tabernacle you know he's the
[5:46] Potter we're the
[5:48] clay so what happens when that lump of
[5:51] clay gets into the Potter's
[5:53] hand you know when a Potter starts with
[5:55] a piece of clay it's hard he just looks
[5:59] at at it he can't do anything with it
[6:02] it's
[6:04] stubborn he wants everything his way he
[6:08] doesn't want anyone to tell him what to
[6:10] do the sin of the world has made him a
[6:13] hard person you get where I'm
[6:15] going I'm going to live any way I want
[6:19] to so Potter would just kind of walk by
[6:21] and he just look at it like and kick it
[6:25] be like what am I going to make out of
[6:27] this
[6:28] thing
[6:30] I'm trying to I'm trying to behave so I
[6:32] told I went ahead and apologize to
[6:34] brother Jason this morning in advance I
[6:37] said I'll try not to preach
[6:40] this the Potter he'll walk by he'll give
[6:42] it a kick and'll say what am I going to
[6:43] do with this what am I going to make out
[6:46] of this amen seemed like an impossible
[6:51] task the poter will walk by look at that
[6:53] Clump lump of clay and he kind of
[6:55] scratch his
[6:56] head says what in the world am I going
[6:59] to do you just like God he walked around
[7:01] us one day and he walked around he said
[7:04] oh man Brad Y and you don't have to amen
[7:10] this he is
[7:12] sorry low down good for nothing just
[7:16] kind of what am I going to do with this
[7:17] thing it seems impossible to some of us
[7:21] of the lives that we have lived you know
[7:24] you wonder what what would what did God
[7:26] even see in us when he walked by us and
[7:28] see what kind of shape we were in cuz we
[7:30] were shaped in
[7:32] sin born in born in sin this you know he
[7:36] walked
[7:37] around he's just a hard stubborn piece
[7:39] of
[7:41] clay but when the Potter comes and picks
[7:45] up that hard piece of clay he just looks
[7:48] at it he sees a potential there amen he
[7:53] sees a potential finished product
[7:58] amen it doesn't doesn't matter what the
[8:00] clay look like at the beginning amen
[8:03] hallelujah the Potter has an image in
[8:05] his mind on what the finished work would
[8:09] look
[8:10] like he looks he looks at this thing he
[8:13] goes that piece of Potter right there I
[8:15] can make a cup out
[8:17] of that one I can make a vase or maybe
[8:20] that one a plate but he has in his
[8:24] mind the Potter looks at that clay in
[8:26] his mind he says you'll be a vase amen
[8:30] and so the clay becomes what is in The
[8:32] Potter's mind you know like
[8:34] Michelangelo when he was sculpting the
[8:37] the image of
[8:38] Moses and it took him a while the the
[8:41] more he chipped away at at Moses and
[8:43] this image the more he did the more real
[8:46] it looked to to Michelangelo it looked
[8:48] so real he said this thing should
[8:51] talk and so what did he do he took his
[8:53] hammer he he was so he was so inspired
[8:56] by the image of Moses he said speak
[9:00] and he smot him then Moses became a
[9:04] perfect image being smitten that's what
[9:08] happened to Jesus Christ he become
[9:10] perfect man when he was smitten and the
[9:12] brother BR said the bride has been
[9:14] smitten just like Christ was that's what
[9:16] makes us
[9:17] perfect so God looked at
[9:20] me he didn't see all my
[9:23] faults amen he looked beyond my fault
[9:26] and saw my needs it wasn't what I needed
[9:29] it's what he needed me to be yes he I
[9:32] needed hope I needed saving I needed
[9:35] salvation I needed Deliverance so that's
[9:37] what God's seen in
[9:39] me Hallelujah so when that Potter picks
[9:42] up the clay the only way he was going to
[9:45] be able to do anything with the clay was
[9:48] to put water on
[9:50] it he had to justify the
[9:54] clay so the Potter must put water to
[9:57] soften it up so he can use it you know
[9:59] what sounds like to us before we were
[10:02] saved we were hardened by this world no
[10:05] one could do anything with us but one
[10:09] day God said it's time it's time for you
[10:13] to come in
[10:15] amen so you come to a church service
[10:18] under the preaching of the word god
[10:21] convicts your heart and you come running
[10:23] up to the altar tears are streaming down
[10:26] your face father forgive me God God
[10:29] forgive me of my sins God forgive me of
[10:31] what I've done God forgive I'm sorry
[10:33] Lord and you truly repenting and then
[10:35] the preacher then you come up to the
[10:37] preacher and he baptizes you with
[10:40] water he's justifying you so now you're
[10:43] he's God he's got water on this clay
[10:46] he's able to mold you to make you what
[10:50] you need to be the preachers took you
[10:53] and baptize you you started softening up
[10:56] and now God the Potter can start working
[10:58] on you amen notice when that Clay is on
[11:01] the wheel and that wheel is
[11:04] spinning the clay is always in his hands
[11:08] molded into an image that is in his
[11:12] mind so while the clay is on the wheel
[11:16] the Potter just don't turn around and
[11:17] walk off and leave you there cuz if the
[11:20] Potter did that it just start going
[11:22] everywhere it just become a mess but the
[11:26] Potter keeps his hands on it and so
[11:28] while the thing is and he is molding a
[11:31] vase a beautiful vase to be used and so
[11:35] he keeps molding it and molding and
[11:40] shaping at the beginning you can't tell
[11:42] what it's going to be amen at the
[11:44] beginning when you get saved you don't
[11:45] know what you're going to
[11:47] be but God says I have you in the palm
[11:50] of my
[11:51] hand says Jeremiah says behold I have
[11:54] Graven thee in the palms of my hand so
[11:57] God can't forget who you are he can't
[11:59] walk away and say forget
[12:01] you you're already in his hands he's
[12:04] already got you on the wheel and he's
[12:05] molding it and he's and he's and he's
[12:08] spinning the wheel and shaping and
[12:10] molding you to his very image that he
[12:13] had in his mind before the foundation of
[12:16] the
[12:17] world what an
[12:19] image signifying that God is always in
[12:23] his sight his eyes were ever upon them
[12:28] he never withdraws from them has
[12:30] everything is held in his hand so the
[12:34] clay is always in the hand of the Potter
[12:36] so the clay becomes what is in his mind
[12:39] amen I must say it might be a vase or a
[12:42] cup or whatever is in The Potter's mind
[12:44] he will mow that's what the clay becomes
[12:47] you know that clay just don't become
[12:48] anything it wants to amen you know a
[12:51] part of might say hey I want you to be a
[12:52] cup but this he says I don't want to be
[12:54] a cup I want to be a
[12:58] plate
[13:01] so if God called you to be a deacon
[13:03] don't try to preach amen if God called
[13:06] you to be a trustee don't try to preach
[13:08] if God called you to be a preacher don't
[13:10] be a trustee or a
[13:11] deacon you be what God's called you to
[13:14] be
[13:15] amen sometimes I wished I was brother
[13:19] Luther and brother Luther was up here
[13:22] then I could be
[13:27] mean sorry love you brother
[13:32] that was
[13:34] free so we we are in the hands of God
[13:37] molded into his very
[13:40] image
[13:42] Hallelujah sometimes a Potter must take
[13:44] out a sharp
[13:45] knife and start digging stuff out of
[13:49] you digging stuff that should there's a
[13:51] rock there let me get that rock out you
[13:54] know sometimes during the preaching of
[13:55] the word the preacher up here has a
[13:56] sharp tool and he starts digging and you
[13:59] start hurting go ahead and say ouch it's
[14:02] okay Amen Let Let preacher and God know
[14:06] it oh he just took something hard out of
[14:08] my life maybe there's something else
[14:10] that needs to be in there maybe God
[14:11] needs to take a little tool and start
[14:12] taking out your bitterness taking out
[14:14] your envy and strife and your hard
[14:15] feelings and and your grudges
[14:18] and and start shaping you cuz you can't
[14:21] be a smooth little vase with a rock
[14:23] sticking out of
[14:26] you glory to God
[14:29] he'll dig out that temper he'll dig out
[14:32] that lust the jealous Spirit whatever
[14:35] that's in you that is hindering the
[14:37] Potter from creating that Perfect Image
[14:40] in his
[14:42] mind Romans 9:18 says therefore hath he
[14:45] Mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[14:49] whom he will he hardeneth thou Willl say
[14:52] thou then unto me why does he yet find
[14:57] fault for who hath resisted his will nay
[15:02] but oh man who art thou that repliest
[15:06] against God Amen shall the thing
[15:10] formed say to him that formed it why in
[15:14] the world did you make me a cup
[15:17] yeah sometimes I do that why in the
[15:20] world did you make me a
[15:23] preacher I would just like to sit there
[15:25] with my wife ever
[15:27] service and just run sound
[15:32] why hast Thou made me
[15:35] thus but hath not the Potter power over
[15:40] the clay amen of the same lump he made
[15:43] one vessel unto honor and unto another
[15:47] dishonor so what if God willing to show
[15:50] his wrath and do make his power known
[15:55] endureth with much longsuffering the
[15:57] vessels of Wrath
[15:59] fitted to
[16:01] destruction wow here's your
[16:04] predestination and he might make known
[16:06] to The Riches of his glory on the
[16:08] vessels of Mercy which he had off a four
[16:11] prepared unto
[16:13] Glory
[16:16] predestination he chose he knows who's
[16:18] going to be he's got vessels of honor
[16:19] and vessels of Dishonor we know
[16:22] Ephesians 1:4 according as he chose us
[16:24] in him before the foundation world that
[16:25] we should be holy and Without Blame
[16:26] before him in love having predes
[16:28] destinated us unto the adoption of
[16:31] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[16:35] according to the good pleasure of his
[16:37] will amen so hath not the Potter power
[16:42] over the
[16:43] clay the power the Potter has over the
[16:46] Clays to shape it into what form he
[16:50] pleases and out of it to make what
[16:53] vessel he pleases for what purpose he
[16:56] thinks fit amen so he's got a plan for
[16:59] any one of you young people he's got
[17:02] something you're going to fit into he's
[17:04] molding
[17:06] you which will I like this for what
[17:09] purpose he thinks fit which will be most
[17:13] to his own
[17:14] Advantage so whatever God's making you
[17:17] it's to his Advantage not ours the
[17:20] unlimited power which God has over
[17:23] us in which God is represented to as the
[17:27] Potter and the man as the clay cuz as I
[17:28] Isaiah 648 says but now oh Lord Thou Art
[17:30] the father we are the clay Thou Art the
[17:34] Potter we all are the work of thy hand
[17:37] amen so if the Potter has such power
[17:39] over the clay you talking about the reg
[17:41] a natural Potter has such power over the
[17:44] clay which he did not make he went out
[17:47] and bought
[17:49] it and is it has it in his possession
[17:52] how much more has God a power who has
[17:55] created the clay to a point out of it
[17:59] persons to different uses and
[18:03] purposes he'll make some Housewives some
[18:06] Farmers some Factory workers some
[18:07] Carpenters some computer
[18:11] techs
[18:14] Hallelujah of the same lump to make one
[18:17] vessel to honor and another to dishonor
[18:19] all the clay cannot be used cuz some of
[18:21] it is bad amen and the Potter can't use
[18:25] it so he'll just throw it away but
[18:27] there's some clay
[18:29] that is predestinated to life that's
[18:32] what he uses to honor so whatever God is
[18:36] making you you're going to honor you're
[18:39] for his
[18:41] honor
[18:47] Hallelujah in the hands of God as
[18:49] Jeremiah says it says you are in the
[18:51] palms of his hands how can he forget you
[18:54] if you are in his hands and then
[18:57] we can be sure that if you are he's
[19:01] molding you he is the Potter we're the
[19:04] clay God is molding us into his very
[19:06] image so what happens when the Potter is
[19:09] finished with the molding of the
[19:13] clay he then lets it Harden for several
[19:16] days and then he'll take it into the
[19:19] fire to be fired
[19:23] amen and then it becomes
[19:27] indestructible nothing can penetrate so
[19:30] it's a cup you pour water into it it
[19:33] stays
[19:34] there you get the God gives you the Holy
[19:37] Ghost he has put you in this fire fired
[19:40] you nothing can penetrate you you are
[19:44] indestructible am Hallelujah Am Lord
[19:48] fire
[19:50] us once the Potter is finished with a
[19:53] clay it has been
[19:57] fired
[19:59] glory to
[20:02] God then the vessel is ready for
[20:07] service if it's a cup it's ready to hold
[20:10] your favorite
[20:11] drink if it's a plate go get you a plate
[20:14] of food if it's a vase put you a flour
[20:17] into
[20:18] it it's ready for its attended use so
[20:22] when God has fired you you he's ready to
[20:26] use you for his attended use amen wow
[20:29] if he called you to preach it preach it
[20:31] if he's called you to be a deacon be a
[20:32] deacon if he's called you to be a
[20:34] trustee be a trustee if he's called you
[20:36] to be a housewife be one amen because
[20:39] God is wanting you to to use you for his
[20:43] intended
[20:44] use so when we have been fired by God
[20:48] received of the Holy Ghost it is time
[20:50] for us to Bear the
[20:53] fruit now we have a goal to reach the
[20:56] Fruit of the Spirit the making of a
[21:01] perfect
[21:03] man Bible says by their fruits you shall
[21:06] know
[21:12] them I better stop right there I better
[21:16] I've got more I'll just I got a couple
[21:18] weeks I'll do part
[21:20] two but molded into his very image amen
[21:25] that's what we get into our open
[21:26] scripture amen by their fruits you shall
[21:29] know them let God mold us let let's be
[21:34] what God wants us to be not what we want
[21:37] to be cuz if you want to be a preacher
[21:39] you're crazy and brother Luther says you
[21:41] want to be a deacon you're
[21:45] crazy you love
[21:47] him I'll cut it short it's a few minutes
[21:49] that way give y'all time to pray for
[21:50] brother
[21:51] Jason God bless
[21:57] y'all
