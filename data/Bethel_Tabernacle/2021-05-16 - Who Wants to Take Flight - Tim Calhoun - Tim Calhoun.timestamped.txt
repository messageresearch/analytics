[5:00] okay oh i forgot turn it on okay sorry
[5:04] about that
[5:12] all right so we'll read down from verse
[5:13] 1 down to
[5:15] verse 7. it says and i saw an angel come
[5:20] down from heaven having the key of the
[5:21] bottomless pit in a great chain
[5:24] in his hand and he laid hold on the
[5:27] dragon that old serpent which is the
[5:29] devil
[5:30] and satan and bound him a thousand years
[5:33] and cast him into the bottomless pit and
[5:36] shut him up
[5:37] set a seal upon him that he should
[5:40] deceive the nations no more
[5:42] till the thousand years should be
[5:44] fulfilled and after that he must be
[5:46] loosed a little season
[5:48] and i saw thrones and they sat upon them
[5:51] and judgment was given unto them and i
[5:54] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[5:56] for the witness of jesus
[5:58] and for the word of god and which had
[6:00] not worshipped the beast
[6:02] neither his image neither had received
[6:04] his mark upon their foreheads
[6:06] are in their hands and they lived and
[6:09] reigned with christ a thousand years
[6:12] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[6:15] until the thousand years were finished
[6:18] this is the first resurrection
[6:20] blessed and holy is he that hath part
[6:24] in the first resurrection on such the
[6:27] second death hath no
[6:28] power but they shall be priest of god
[6:32] and of christ and shall reign with him a
[6:34] thousand years
[6:36] and when the thousand years are expired
[6:38] satan shall be loosed
[6:40] out of his prison so the lord god bless
[6:43] you may be seated this morning
[6:46] um and we will also
[6:50] uh take a look at chapter 21
[6:53] there in the book of revelation starting
[6:56] with verse 1.
[7:01] give the brothers just a minute to catch
[7:03] up we didn't have time to
[7:05] get everything together 21 verse 1 and i
[7:08] saw a new heaven and a new earth
[7:11] for the first heaven and the first earth
[7:13] were passed away
[7:14] and there was no more sea
[7:18] and i john saw the holy city
[7:21] new jerusalem coming down from god
[7:24] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[7:27] adorned for her husband
[7:30] and i heard a great voice out of say
[7:32] heaven saying
[7:33] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[7:37] and he will dwell with them and they
[7:39] shall be his people
[7:41] and god himself shall be with them and
[7:44] be
[7:45] their god so
[7:48] this morning let's go on to
[7:52] verse 4 there brothers and god shall
[7:55] wipe away
[7:56] all tears from their eyes and there
[7:59] shall be
[8:00] no more death neither sorrow
[8:03] nor crying neither shall there be
[8:06] any more pain for the former things
[8:09] are passed away okay and then let's jump
[8:13] over to
[8:14] uh 22.
[8:21] and let's see
[8:26] we will start at verse 1
[8:31] and we will go through verse 5. and he
[8:34] showed me a pure river of water of life
[8:36] clear as crystal
[8:37] proceeding out of the throne of god and
[8:40] of the lamb
[8:42] and in the midst of the street of it and
[8:44] on either side of the river was there
[8:46] the tree of life which bear twelve
[8:47] manner of fruits
[8:49] and yielded her fruit every month and
[8:51] the leaves of the tree were for the
[8:52] healing of the nations
[8:54] and there shall be no more curse but the
[8:57] throne of god and of the lamb shall be
[8:59] in it
[9:00] and his servants shall serve him and
[9:03] they shall see his face and his name
[9:05] shall be in their foreheads and there
[9:08] shall be no night there
[9:10] and they need no candle neither light of
[9:12] the sun
[9:13] for the lord god giveth them light and

[17:02] unfruitful so again we're talking about
[17:05] fruits right
[17:07] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[17:10] jesus christ so now this is not the
[17:12] knowledge that you go down to the local

[17:27] in the divine nature and the and you
[17:29] have to go to where that's
[17:30] at it's not down here at the schoolhouse
[17:33] it's not at the theological seminary
[17:35] and you know what it's not right here in
[17:37] this church
[17:39] you say oh but
[17:43] it's not it's not here in the church
[17:47] building
[17:53] but it better be in the church
[17:59] next verse there brother
[18:13] for if these things be in you and abound
[18:15] they make you shall neither be barren
[18:17] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[18:19] jesus christ
[18:20] we're going to go one other place we're
[18:21] going to go matthew
[18:23] chapter 6 verses 9 through
[18:26] 15. matthew 6
[18:30] 9 through 15. so
[18:34] again if you want to take that flight
[18:36] now this is the flight that's bound
[18:40] for the wedding supper for the
[18:42] millennium
[18:43] and for the new jerusalem so
[18:47] it's the only fly going there's not
[18:49] another one that you can
[18:51] can get on there's no alternative flight
[18:53] this is the only flight going
[18:55] and like we said in two hours and a half
[18:58] final boarding
[18:59] so you know
[19:03] you got to be ready it's not not
[19:04] something you can wait and make
[19:06] tomorrow it's it's today
[19:10] so you got to be ready to get on this
[19:12] flight
[19:14] now understand that there are two other
[19:17] flights
[19:17] okay i will tell you that there are two
[19:19] other flights
[19:21] all right so there is another flight
[19:24] that we'll be leaving
[19:25] later we don't know exactly when that
[19:27] one's going to be
[19:28] okay but that flight
[19:33] its destination is first stop
[19:36] and it's required you have to de-plane
[19:39] is the tribulation
[19:40] okay and so you you have to take
[19:43] you have to de-plane you have to get off
[19:46] and then once the tribulation is
[19:48] finished you get back on that flight
[19:52] and now it's going to fly for a thousand
[19:54] years
[19:58] and then it'll finally reach its
[19:59] destination and you know what that
[20:01] destination is it's called the white
[20:02] throne judgment
[20:04] now this particular flight okay this
[20:06] particular flight
[20:09] the final destination is has two
[20:11] separate places okay
[20:13] it has a place called the sea of glass
[20:16] where
[20:17] there's part of them going to go and
[20:19] then it has a destination called
[20:21] outside the city where the rest of them
[20:23] are going to go
[20:25] so it's in heaven it has a final
[20:26] destination of
[20:28] heaven but you have to go through the
[20:31] tribulation
[20:32] and you have to stay with the dead for a
[20:35] thousand years
[20:37] and then you're brought up and then
[20:40] there is the final flight
[20:43] it's the final flight so everybody that
[20:46] misses flight one
[20:48] and flight number two they go
[20:51] in flight number three and flight number
[20:55] three's destination is also the
[20:57] tribulation
[21:01] and then the final stop is white throne
[21:03] judgment
[21:06] and there their destination is actually
[21:09] the lake of fire
[21:11] so you're the one who makes the choice
[21:14] now
[21:16] you're the one who makes a choice
[21:20] not even god makes that choice did you
[21:22] know that
[21:24] you make that choice because he said
[21:27] whosoever
[21:28] will let him take of the water of life
[21:30] freely
[21:31] and so if you will to do it then he has
[21:34] to provide it don't he
[21:37] but if you don't will to do it then he
[21:40] has provided and you chose not to
[21:45] so all of those that want to get on that
[21:47] first flight
[21:49] you've got two and a half hours boarding
[21:52] starts here in about 10 minutes
[21:56] and you got two hours beyond that
[21:59] all right so you can't take on board any
[22:04] food or drink
[22:06] as the food and drink is all provided on
[22:08] the flight at no charge
[22:10] oh by the way this plane
[22:13] there's no ticket that you can purchase
[22:18] you have to go through the exams and
[22:20] once you go through the exams and pass
[22:22] the exams
[22:24] then you have the right to board the
[22:26] flight
[22:27] otherwise you you do not have right to
[22:29] board the flight
[22:32] okay all right so
[22:35] everybody has has witnessed that they
[22:38] want to take
[22:39] flight on that first plane that takes
[22:42] them to the
[22:43] wedding supper and the millennium and to
[22:46] dwell eternally in the new jerusalem
[22:49] okay all right so boarding is ready to
[22:52] begin
[22:54] and the line begins at the altar okay
[22:58] all of the exams are done here okay
[23:01] there's no

[23:14] guards that handles those exams
[23:18] okay there's a line of ox a man an eagle

[26:25] it's not the ox it's not the man it's
[26:27] not the eagle
[26:28] they're just the testing people they
[26:30] provide the test
[26:32] and and once you get through their test
[26:34] they just give you the certificate and
[26:35] you pass on
[26:37] but it's the boarding agent that's
[26:39] standing there at the door where that
[26:41] blood
[26:41] test is going to be done that's the
[26:44] person
[26:46] that gives you full access to the flight
[26:48] okay
[26:51] so everybody that wants to get on this
[26:54] flight
[26:55] it's available to you today and like i
[26:58] said boarding begins
[27:00] you know the altar you you go you pass
[27:04] through the altar
[27:05] you can't remember how it was i'm sure
[27:09] that uh brother jason's had plenty of
[27:11] examples of the
[27:13] ark of the covenant and the new the
[27:15] tabernacle in the wilderness and
[27:18] all those kind of things that y'all have
[27:19] seen and been taught in
[27:21] and if you remember you come in the
[27:23] eastern gate right
[27:26] and when you come in the eastern gate
[27:27] what's the first thing
[27:30] the altar so that's the axis you got to
[27:34] go through the altar
[27:37] and and then once you pass the altar
[27:39] then you enter into the next phase
[27:41] to get to the the holy place and that's
[27:44] where those line ox man and eagle that's
[27:46] where
[27:47] that's where they do those final tests
[27:50] and then standing at that door to the
[27:52] holy of holies
[27:53] is where that boarding agent is at okay
[27:57] and so if you make it through all of
[27:59] those
[28:00] and there's really no reason for you not
[28:02] to unless
[28:05] you want to take some of these things
[28:08] here you got
[28:09] matthew chapter 5 verses 17
[28:13] through 47. you got
[28:16] second corinthians 12
[28:20] verses 19 through 21.
[28:23] revelations third i mean romans 13
[28:26] verses 7 through 14. first timothy
[28:29] chapter 6
[28:32] james chapter 3 and galatians chapter 5.
[28:37] now i know that's a lot of of of reading
[28:39] there but
[28:40] uh i'll i'll be here after service if
[28:43] anybody
[28:44] wants to talk to me about what those
[28:45] were but those are disqualifying items
[28:48] okay
[28:49] um i've tried to give you the qualified
[28:52] items the ones that'll qualify you
[28:54] so that you know that's the ones that
[28:57] matter these that disqualify they really
[29:00] don't matter if you just let go
[29:01] because that's all you got to do you
[29:03] just drop it in the garbage as you go by
[29:05] it's no big deal
[29:07] but now if you won't let go
[29:11] then you just can't get through the
[29:12] examination
[29:14] you know that x-ray screen it it it
[29:17] shows everything
[29:19] whatever you got in your pockets and in
[29:21] in in your shoes and what you got in
[29:24] your hair and
[29:25] you know if you got a belt on it it'll
[29:28] even show up that stuff you swallow
[29:32] and boy that mri you better not have
[29:34] nothing magnetic on you because boy when
[29:36] that thing goes it goes
[29:37] squirreling around you it's it'll it'll
[29:40] it'll snatch that magnetic stuff
[29:42] problems now that cat scan's pretty
[29:46] slick
[29:47] because it even goes inside your skull
[29:49] and checks all that
[29:50] you know that funny stuff out inside
[29:52] your head
[29:53] and that sonogram it checks out all
[29:55] these innards in here you know
[29:57] figures out whether or not you got good
[29:59] digestion or not
[30:01] so in other words what have you been
[30:03] eating you know you've been eating good
[30:04] stuff or not
[30:06] so you get through those tests and then
[30:08] the last thing
[30:10] is that blood test and you know that
[30:14] one's simple it's just a little prick of
[30:15] your finger you know it ain't no big
[30:17] deal they just wipe it you know
[30:18] see be sure you got the right kind of
[30:20] blood that's all
[30:24] so this morning who wants to take the
[30:27] flight
[30:28] amen
[30:31] see it's really not that complicated to
[30:33] go to heaven is it
[30:37] it's really not a big deal is it it's
[30:38] just like getting on an airplane at the
[30:40] airport
[30:42] you just got to be prepared
[30:46] but now the challenge about this flight
[30:48] is just like i said at the beginning
[30:51] it takes off today and you say
[30:55] brother tim are you saying the rapture
[30:57] is today absolutely
[30:59] it's today today's the day there's no
[31:02] other day
[31:02] you ain't got any other choice
[31:06] and you say but i thought nobody's
[31:08] supposed to know the day they're in the
[31:09] hour
[31:11] according to my bible today is the day
[31:13] of salvation right
[31:16] what does your say so there's no other
[31:20] day
[31:21] if we want to get on the flight today's
[31:23] the day to make your choice
[31:25] today's the day to set aside yourself
[31:29] as the one that's going to go
[31:34] don't worry about that person sitting
[31:35] beside you worry about you
[31:39] now once you get you ready to go
[31:42] then you think about your loved ones and
[31:44] stuff but until
[31:46] the boarding agent says you are ready to
[31:49] go
[31:50] i wouldn't worry about anybody else
[31:53] i wouldn't worry about what the pastor's
[31:55] wife's doing or what the pastor's doing
[31:58] or what the deacon's wife's doing or
[32:00] what the deacon's doing
[32:02] or what their kids are doing or what the
[32:05] prophet's
[32:06] family is doing or anybody else
[32:11] be concerned about you and you alone
[32:14] because you know that prophet that we
[32:16] that we talk about he said
[32:21] you got to be to such a place
[32:24] that if anybody in this church is going
[32:29] it's you so i'm here to tell you this
[32:32] morning
[32:34] if he comes and there's only one going
[32:35] out of this church today
[32:37] i'm sorry y'all but it's me
[32:40] because i'm here today y'all understand
[32:44] that's the way i believe it wherever i'm
[32:47] at
[32:48] i'm listening and when he calls
[32:51] i will answer because that boarding
[32:55] agent
[32:55] i got him on board we're walking
[32:58] together
[32:59] so this morning it's just sort of a word
[33:02] of encouragement but a checkup
[33:06] what if it was right now
[33:11] are you ready to go because if you're
[33:14] not
[33:15] that's a problem
[33:18] now that don't mean that you might not
[33:20] have made a mistake
[33:22] 10 minutes ago
[33:26] but when you made the mistake did you
[33:28] repent
[33:29] amen
[33:32] be zealous therefore and repent that's
[33:34] what the message is to the bride of this
[33:37] day
[33:39] when you make a mistake repent
[33:42] don't keep going in it repent
[33:46] why because nobody knows
[33:49] the day nor the hour
[33:53] so what would you do
[33:57] if the bell rang
[34:00] for you to get on board right now
[34:05] god bless you
