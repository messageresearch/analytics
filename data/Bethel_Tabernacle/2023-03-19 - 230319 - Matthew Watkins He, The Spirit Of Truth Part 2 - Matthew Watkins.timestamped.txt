[36:21] you for all the music God bless you amen
[36:24] this morning good to be here in the
[36:25] house of the Lord first John chapter 4
[36:28] we'll just begin reading here at the
[36:29] first verse
[36:31] and I just want to take a text here what
[36:33] we took part two to what we preached on
[36:35] Wednesday
[36:38] and we won't read that scripture again
[36:40] but we're just going to read here from
[36:41] first John chapter 40. you love the Lord
[36:43] Jesus
[36:44] amen I'm just so thankful that uh he's
[36:47] faithful always amen and we want to be
[36:50] in prayer for my dad today my pastor
[36:53] he's actually here in the back but just
[36:55] suffering from shingles in his head and
[36:58] wasn't able to preach today something
[37:00] that just started a few days maybe a few
[37:02] days ago or so and uh so he's in a lot
[37:05] of pain and suffering and he can't move
[37:07] at all he he said he's found a secret to
[37:10] manage his pain and that was to not move
[37:12] and then not talk so you can't preach if
[37:15] you can't move and can't talk so uh we
[37:18] want to be remembering him how many will
[37:20] you of you will pray for him amen even
[37:22] when we pray over our scripture we'll
[37:24] just pray amen for a pastor
[37:27] so we just want to uh continue on from
[37:29] where we were Wednesday let's just begin
[37:31] reading here at the first verse I'm
[37:33] going to preach to you again on he the
[37:35] spirit of Truth beloved believe not
[37:38] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[37:41] they are of God because many false
[37:44] prophets are going out into the world
[37:47] hereby know you the spirit of God every
[37:50] spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
[37:53] has come in the flesh is of God
[37:56] and every spirit that confesseth not
[37:59] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[38:01] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[38:04] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[38:07] it should come and even now now we're
[38:09] even now already is it in the world now
[38:13] remember what brother Branham teaches us
[38:14] in the anointed ones at the end time
[38:17] that what does Christ mean Christ means
[38:21] the anointed one
[38:23] is that clear we're clearly taught that
[38:25] what does anointing mean it means what
[38:28] does Christ mean it means an anointed
[38:30] one there there will rise false Christ
[38:33] which brother Branham would say that
[38:35] would mean false anointed ones so let's
[38:38] read this back up here at verse three
[38:40] let's read it one more time in every
[38:42] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[38:46] Christ has come in the flesh is not of
[38:49] God now remember not just pointing back
[38:51] to 2000 years ago many people can point
[38:54] to that appearing of Christ coming in
[38:57] the flesh and say that was God but they
[38:59] they won't admit that or recognize that
[39:02] present day they never have and they
[39:05] never will only the elect can recognize
[39:08] Christ can you say Amen
[39:11] that has come in the flesh and confess
[39:14] Christ Has Come In the Flesh notice this
[39:16] here in verse 3 and this is that Spirit
[39:20] of anti-anointing
[39:24] that's really what it means this is that
[39:26] Spirit of
[39:28] anti-anointing
[39:30] antichrist wherever you have heard that
[39:32] it should come and even now already is
[39:35] it in the world you are of God I'm
[39:38] thankful for that
[39:40] little children have and have overcome
[39:42] them because greater is he that is
[39:46] inside of you
[39:47] than he that is in the world
[39:51] amen they are they are of the world
[39:53] therefore let's keep reading here in
[39:54] verse five they are of the world
[39:56] therefore speak they of the world and
[40:00] the world heareth them we are of God he
[40:03] that knoweth God heareth us he that is
[40:06] not of God heareth not us hereby know we
[40:10] the spirit of
[40:13] truth
[40:14] hereby we know the spirit of truth and
[40:19] the spirit of error
[40:22] verse 7 beloved let us love one another
[40:26] for love is of God and everyone that
[40:30] loveth is born of God and knoweth God he
[40:35] that loveth not knoweth not God for God
[40:39] is love
[40:41] in this was manifested the love of God
[40:44] toward us because that God sent his only
[40:48] begotten son into the world that we
[40:51] might live through him
[40:53] herein is love not that we loved God but
[40:57] that he loved us and sent his son to be
[41:00] the propitiation for our sin beloved if
[41:04] God so loved us we ought also to love
[41:08] one another
[41:11] hereby notice this here we all ought to
[41:13] love one another let's read the next
[41:14] verse verse 12 no man hath seen God at
[41:17] any time if we love one another God
[41:19] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[41:22] in US hereby know we that we dwell in
[41:26] him and he and us because he hath given
[41:29] us his Spirit Lord we're thankful this
[41:33] morning as we just bow our heads here
[41:36] Lord and we're so thankful for that
[41:38] all-sufficient name the name of Jesus
[41:41] the name that is that was given that is
[41:44] above every name Lord and we declare it
[41:47] today father is a group of people all
[41:50] here Lord in one place Lord now we just
[41:53] move aside from those natural elements
[41:56] Lord and those Natural Things Lord we
[41:59] move aside from our our own mental
[42:02] thinking Lord and we move into a channel
[42:05] Lord where you can commune and we can
[42:07] commune with you that's our prayer Lord
[42:10] Jesus is that we would enter into
[42:11] another dimension Lord another Channel
[42:14] where we could commune with you because
[42:15] we just want to say Lord with an
[42:17] uplifted hand we love you Lord Jesus we
[42:21] thank you Father for this place that we
[42:23] can gather and commune with you and we
[42:24] just ask you now would you come and take
[42:27] Lord uh the word that you've spoken Lord
[42:30] father make it fresh make it real to
[42:33] your children how we need a fresh touch
[42:35] from above Lord I pray God for my dad

[42:43] control we know that Lord father you
[42:45] said many are the afflictions of the
[42:47] righteous but the Lord God delivereth
[42:49] them from them all so God we pray Lord
[42:52] for a healing touch to in his body Lord
[42:55] I pray fathers we call upon your name

[43:11] lay their hands on the sick and they
[43:13] shall recover Lord they'll ask anything
[43:15] in my name so God we're asking because
[43:17] you told us to will you touch him
[43:19] supernaturally Lord we ask it now in the
[43:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for
[43:25] this church Lord in this audience now we
[43:27] just give it to you in Jesus name amen
[43:30] amen you can be seated
[43:34] amen thank you God bless you you could
[43:37] put up that slide thank you brother Mark
[43:42] let's just keep reading here in first
[43:44] John chapter 4. if you have your Bible
[43:46] just keep it open I don't know what just
[43:48] happened to the monitor if you could fix
[43:50] just reverse whatever you just did thank
[43:52] you amen notice here thank you it was
[43:55] notice this is pick it up here again
[43:58] actually let's move to First John
[44:00] chapter five can we do that one chapter
[44:02] over you don't have to put this up uh
[44:05] brother Mark you could just keep my
[44:06] slides up and uh we want to look at it
[44:09] here together who so this is this is
[44:11] first John 5 verse 1. whosoever
[44:15] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[44:18] born of God and everyone that loveth him
[44:21] that begot loveth loveth him that begot
[44:24] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[44:27] but but notice by this we know that we
[44:31] love the children of God when we love
[44:33] God and keep his Commandments for this
[44:37] is the love of God I'm hearing Pages
[44:39] turn so that's all right make sure you
[44:41] got it and your phone or in your Bible
[44:43] uh here this morning we want to read it
[44:46] together I believe it's important to
[44:48] read the word of God you believe that
[44:49] and it's important for us to to read it
[44:52] and so notice he says this for this is
[44:55] the love of God verse 3 that we keep his
[44:57] Commandments and his Commandments are
[44:59] not Grievous how many could just say
[45:01] that today to the Lord Lord I keep your
[45:03] Commandments and they're not Grievous to
[45:06] me in other words they're not burdensome
[45:08] I don't live what I live because of a
[45:11] law I don't live them because of
[45:13] pressure I'm not living them what what a
[45:15] horrible life that would be to live a
[45:17] life that was Grievous that you did what
[45:19] you did just because of pressure or just
[45:22] because of uh of of out of fear I don't
[45:25] serve the Lord based upon fear that is
[45:27] going to destroy me or even fear uh you
[45:31] know that that some bad thing will
[45:32] happen to me in my life but I live and
[45:35] serve the Lord Jesus because I love him
[45:37] because I love his word it's what Jesus
[45:40] is saying here this is what first John
[45:42] is saying here when he says the
[45:44] Commandments are not Grievous for for
[45:46] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[45:50] world and this is the victory that
[45:52] overcometh the world even our faith
[45:57] who is he that overcometh the world but
[46:00] he that believeth that Jesus is the son
[46:04] of God this is he that came by water and
[46:07] blood and even Jesus Christ not by water
[46:09] only but by water and blood and it is
[46:12] the spirit that beareth witnessed
[46:15] because the spirit is truth we took time
[46:19] to preach to you that on Wednesday that
[46:21] the spirit of the Holy Ghost is the
[46:24] spirit of Truth and that truth is a
[46:26] person can you say Amen this morning
[46:28] Spirit truth is not a Doctrine truth is
[46:31] not a teaching though we teach it though
[46:33] it's it is as we believe the truth
[46:35] that's been restored does come with
[46:37] Doctrine but truth is a person and
[46:40] inside of that person is attributes and
[46:43] the attribute of that person is not
[46:45] Darkness the Bible says that in him
[46:47] there is no Darkness at all there is
[46:50] light uh and he's the Father of Lights
[46:53] he's the light over the world and so
[46:55] there's no darkness in him there's no
[46:58] misunderstanding in God he there's
[47:00] there's no confusion uh in God and so
[47:03] when you have his Spirit of his Spirit
[47:05] doesn't bring confusion it brings a
[47:08] soundness to your mind it brings a
[47:10] soundness to your spirit it brings a
[47:12] settledness in spite of everything
[47:14] that's happening in your life the spirit
[47:17] of God will will settle you it won't you
[47:21] won't be in an upheaval you'll be
[47:23] settled in your spirit say brother Matt
[47:25] does that mean we can't get enough evil
[47:27] no it certainly doesn't mean that we're
[47:29] still the Bible says greater is he that
[47:32] is in you than he that is in the world
[47:34] so there's two of me there's one that's
[47:36] inside of me that's Jesus and then
[47:38] there's one out here that can get
[47:40] confused that can get misunderstood it
[47:43] can get in an upheaval it could become
[47:44] unsettled but I've got something living
[47:47] on the inside of me that stabilizes me
[47:50] in circumstances when I can't understand
[47:53] and I can't explain there's something
[47:55] inside of me that stayed realizes me and
[47:59] that's the spirit of Truth he's a person
[48:01] can you say Amen this morning I need
[48:03] your amens I learned it about eight
[48:05] o'clock this morning I was going to be
[48:07] preaching so you pull on the word of God
[48:08] Amen God will give you something uh and
[48:11] and so notice here this is this is what
[48:13] the Bible says it says we spoke on this
[48:16] on on uh Wednesday
[48:18] and we spoke of this scripture here in
[48:21] first John
[48:22] and and notice this in first John
[48:24] chapter 2 turn back in your Bible to
[48:26] chapter two I'm writing to you little
[48:28] children because your sins have been
[48:30] forgiven first this is first John uh two
[48:34] let me make sure you get it in your
[48:36] Bibles on your phones however you got to
[48:38] get it get it amen if and I believe it
[48:41] it'll do you good if you read it with
[48:42] your eyes this morning notice this here
[48:45] this is First John chapter 2 and verse
[48:49] 12.
[48:50] first John chapter 2 and verse 12. I
[48:53] read unto you fathers because you have
[48:54] known him that is from the beginning I
[48:57] write unto you young men because you
[48:59] have overcome the wicked one I write
[49:02] unto you little children because you
[49:04] have known the father I have written
[49:06] unto you I have written unto you fathers
[49:09] because you have known him that is from
[49:12] the beginning I have written unto you
[49:14] young men because you're strong and the
[49:16] word of God abideth in you and you have
[49:19] overcome the wicked one now notice here
[49:21] verse 15 love not the world neither the
[49:26] things that are in the world if any man
[49:29] love the world the love of the father is
[49:33] not in him for all that is in the world
[49:36] the lust of the Flesh and the lust of
[49:39] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[49:42] the father but it is of the world and
[49:45] the world passeth away and the lust
[49:48] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[49:50] God abideth forever now notice our verse
[49:54] here again love not the world this is
[49:56] what the what we spoke on Wednesday this
[49:58] is the cosmos it means the structure or
[50:02] the the order and and it's the as we
[50:05] said it's the opposite of the word chaos
[50:07] chaos meaning disorder and dysfunction
[50:10] you could say this world is a world of
[50:14] chaos if there was ever a more chaotic
[50:16] time it's the day and age that you live
[50:19] in today it's an age of chaos but we
[50:22] know that that in first John he's
[50:23] speaking in first John 2 this is a world
[50:25] order we read it in first John chapter 4
[50:28] and chapter five uh you you have
[50:31] overcome the world little little
[50:33] children he that loves God is is not of
[50:36] the world but he's of the father and so
[50:38] notice this here don't love the world
[50:40] and so you say well God is the god of
[50:43] love I understand that God's the god of
[50:45] love but in order to love you've got to
[50:48] hate
[50:51] in fact you by contrast God if he has if
[50:55] he's absolutely love then that means he
[50:58] has to hate and that's a strong word
[51:00] that the world doesn't like today it's a
[51:02] world that's not popular the world hate
[51:04] and we have enough we have enough hate
[51:06] we need to end hate hate speech and and
[51:09] that's I'm sure what they would call
[51:10] most of our sermons that we preach from
[51:12] this Pulpit here today is most of the
[51:14] world and the in the in the ways of the
[51:16] road would call this sermon hate speech
[51:19] and we don't need hate we just need love
[51:21] God is love and and so we just need to
[51:24] love listen I understand that God is
[51:26] love I understand that love is the
[51:28] greatest weapon that God has ever given
[51:31] to man brother Branham said Is Love
[51:33] perfect love casteth out all fear and so
[51:36] we preach love we pray we we preach it
[51:39] in the in the in the way that the Bible
[51:41] teaches love not the way that the world
[51:44] believes in love not the way that the
[51:46] world teaches love or that Hollywood
[51:47] teaches love because that's a perversion
[51:50] of the true love of God listen to me
[51:52] friends if you think that Hollywood has
[51:55] the true understanding of what love is
[51:57] you're under a delusion of the devil
[51:59] Hollywood's love is is a is a perversion
[52:02] of true love
[52:04] first John chapter 4 verse 7 it say we
[52:07] just read it we're told to love one
[52:09] another and everyone who who loves this
[52:11] of God and and knows God in verse 8 it
[52:14] says the one who doesn't love doesn't
[52:17] know God for God is love it's repeated
[52:19] in verse 11 of chapter four if God so
[52:22] loved us we ought also to love one
[52:25] another so there are certain things in
[52:28] the Bible that we are commanded to love
[52:30] one of them is each other
[52:34] and I know that we believe in a god of
[52:36] Miracles so we can say Amen to that to
[52:39] that verse we can have love for one
[52:41] another and even Jesus said how will
[52:44] they know that you're my disciples that
[52:46] you have love one for another it doesn't
[52:49] mean that we all agree on everything it
[52:51] doesn't mean that we're all in syncing
[52:53] and Harmony that we never I heard it
[52:55] hurt each other's feelings or we never
[52:57] offend each other listen to me I'm just
[52:59] going to go ahead and tell you today I'm
[53:01] going to hurt your feelings I'm sure
[53:03] you're gonna hurt mine if you get to
[53:06] know me and maybe not here today but if
[53:07] you know me if you're a friend of mine
[53:09] and you have a friend I'm sure listen
[53:11] even that wife is going to hurt you that
[53:13] husband that you love it's gonna hurt
[53:15] your feelings but that doesn't change
[53:17] that there's a Love or there's a union
[53:19] or there's a bond there's something
[53:21] that's Inseparable one with another
[53:23] that's why brother Branham says you ever
[53:25] talk about it Branham you're going to
[53:27] get all the branhams to fight and he
[53:29] says because that's what happens in the
[53:31] front yard but don't you know in the
[53:32] backyard where no one's looking branhams
[53:34] are fighting branhams
[53:37] but we keep those fights in the backyard
[53:40] we don't take them to the front yard in
[53:42] the front yard we have each other's back
[53:44] oh can I get an amen this morning in the
[53:47] front yard we encourage one another we
[53:50] love one we might have our disagreements
[53:52] we might not see uh things directly or
[53:55] eye to eye but there's a there's a love
[53:57] you say then what is that thing that
[53:59] joins us one to another it's the love of
[54:02] Christ which is the word and so because
[54:05] you love the word and I love the word
[54:07] then it doesn't matter what our human
[54:09] disagreements are there's an affinity we
[54:12] have with one another that we love the
[54:14] word
[54:17] oh let me just preach to you this
[54:18] morning there's only one thing that will
[54:20] unite us and it's something it's not a
[54:22] Doctrine it's not a theory it's not a
[54:24] teaching it's the word of the hour
[54:26] there's only one thing that unites the
[54:28] body of Christ and that's the word
[54:30] that's been revealed
[54:33] notice this here he says if you love God
[54:36] it's repeated again God is love and the
[54:38] one who who abides and love abides in
[54:40] God and God abides in him we get that so
[54:42] but if you go to the Old Testament in
[54:45] Psalms chapter 97 and and verse 10.
[54:49] he says hate evil
[54:52] you who love the Lord
[54:55] hold on a minute I thought I'm supposed
[54:57] to love well if you love that means you
[55:00] hate
[55:01] wait hold on brother Matt did you say
[55:04] that right I said it right
[55:05] notice this this is Psalms 97 verse 10
[55:08] and so he says hate evil you who love
[55:14] the Lord so if you love God then there's
[55:18] going to be things you hate
[55:24] say that again if you have the love of
[55:27] God in you then if God hated you'll hate
[55:32] I'm just preaching the most simplistic
[55:34] Sunday school ABCs it's not complicated
[55:37] here this morning it's pretty simple if
[55:40] you've got the love of God then by
[55:42] necessity you have a hatred for certain
[55:45] things
[55:45] you'll also hate the things that God
[55:48] hates and so what is love it defines an
[55:51] attitude what is hate it defines an
[55:53] attitude towards something or an object
[55:55] or an idea and so the love of God and
[55:59] notice this here in Psalms 97 he says
[56:01] hate evil you who love the Lord Psalms
[56:04] 119 verse 104 from your precepts this is
[56:08] what David says from your precepts I get
[56:11] understanding therefore
[56:14] I hate the evil way
[56:18] this is Psalms 119 brother Mark he says
[56:22] from your precepts I get understanding
[56:24] therefore I hate every evil way verse 13
[56:27] I hate those who are double-minded but I
[56:31] love your law
[56:35] verse 128 of Psalms 119 I esteem all
[56:39] your precepts how many can say that
[56:41] today to say Lord I value I esteem I
[56:45] hold in high regard all of your word not
[56:48] just some of your word not the parts
[56:49] that I like and the parts I don't like I
[56:52] just sort of even minimize over here and
[56:54] I don't major no the True Believer says
[56:57] Lord I love all of your word I love
[56:58] every part of it God I'm raising my
[57:01] hands so you can raise yours I love
[57:03] every part of it God I love even the
[57:05] parts I don't like you say there's parts
[57:07] of the word you don't like this old for
[57:09] rotten flesh has parts that I don't like
[57:11] but I love every part of it I believe
[57:14] every part of it I love every part that
[57:16] I don't understand I love every part
[57:18] that I do understand I love every part
[57:20] that I can explain but I also love every
[57:22] part that I can explain why because I
[57:25] love the word and David could say I love
[57:28] I esteem all of thy precepts
[57:31] concerning all things to be right and I
[57:34] hate every false way
[57:39] now Believers I need your help this
[57:41] morning I need you to pull on the word
[57:42] of God and every church service their
[57:44] spirits that are good they're spirits
[57:46] that are evil they're spirits of brother
[57:48] Adam said there's Angels trying to
[57:49] energize people's face there's also
[57:51] demon Spirits trying to discourage you
[57:53] trying to criticize what the preacher's
[57:55] saying so you that are true believers
[57:57] why don't you pull on the word of God
[57:59] here join in the fight with me this
[58:01] morning call on the word of God say Amen
[58:04] to the word of God David said I esteem
[58:07] all thy precepts concerning all things
[58:09] to be right and I hate every false way
[58:13] he says he says in verse 163 I hate and
[58:17] despise lies
[58:21] I hate I hate and a poor lying but thy
[58:25] law do I love
[58:29] you wonder why you hate the news media
[58:31] that's why
[58:33] I don't say that kidding that's why you
[58:36] hate it because there's something in you
[58:38] that doesn't like lying you don't like
[58:40] dishonesty you abhor it if you've got
[58:43] the real nature of Christ inside of you
[58:45] you hate it
[58:48] I love your law so the let me say this
[58:51] way the love of God demands
[58:55] that you hate certain things
[58:59] notice in Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16
[59:03] there are six things which the Lord
[59:05] hates
[59:07] there are six things this is Proverbs uh
[59:10] chapter 6 verse 16. there are six things
[59:14] which the Lord hates uh and and he says
[59:17] it's what is it it's a proud look it's a
[59:19] boastful a lion tongue hands that shed
[59:22] innocent blood and a heart that devises
[59:24] evil feet that runs swiftly uh for one
[59:27] who tells a false witness and and one
[59:30] who sows Discord or raises Strife
[59:33] amongst brethrens or tries to break up
[59:35] unity and you know that the Bible says
[59:37] that God hates a spirit that would try
[59:40] to break up Unity he hates a spirit that
[59:43] tries to break up Harmony within a body
[59:46] and let me tell you that's what the
[59:48] devil's good at he will try everything
[59:50] he can to break up brother random says
[59:52] you're one lovely group of people right
[59:54] now you all love one another I could say
[59:56] that about a church we can say that
[59:58] about a newlywed when you're first
[1:00:00] married your lovely group you you love
[1:00:02] each other you just you you just want to
[1:00:05] be in each other's company all the time
[1:00:07] my brother Brandon says but don't you
[1:00:09] know the devil ain't gonna to let it
[1:00:10] stay that way he's gonna do everything
[1:00:13] he can to break up to cause dysfunction
[1:00:15] to cause disharmony oh but but I got
[1:00:18] news for him today I'm not going to
[1:00:20] allow the demon spirit I want to say I
[1:00:22] pray I I I I I I curse any spirit that
[1:00:26] would try to bring disruption or Harmony
[1:00:28] to my home to my family to my church to
[1:00:32] my children I want the love of God to
[1:00:34] reign supreme in my heart
[1:00:38] so he says he hates he hates one who
[1:00:41] would spread Strife amongst even there
[1:00:44] do you say that that then there's seven
[1:00:46] things there's actually much more than
[1:00:48] seven Solomon only named seven here in
[1:00:50] Proverbs but there's more in the Book of
[1:00:52] Malachi God says I hate divorce
[1:00:59] did you hear me
[1:01:01] I hate divorce
[1:01:03] this is one thing God says he hates he
[1:01:06] he says in the Book of Malachi chapter
[1:01:08] one that he he he hates wickedness
[1:01:14] Hosea chapter 9 and in Jeremiah 44
[1:01:18] verses 3 and 4. the Bible says God hates
[1:01:21] idolatry he hates the worship of
[1:01:24] anything that comes between you and him
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:01:31] that's a strong word god actually
[1:01:34] hates it
[1:01:37] anything that you put before God Thou
[1:01:40] shalt have no other gods before me
[1:01:42] because he's a jealous God
[1:01:44] he hates anything that would break up
[1:01:47] fellowship or communion with him he's
[1:01:51] number one he's the number one prior
[1:01:53] he's the number one priority he ought to
[1:01:55] be first place in every part of your
[1:01:57] life and when we take him and put him to
[1:01:59] a second place let me just tell you what
[1:02:01] the Bible says he hates that
[1:02:07] God says in Amos chapter 5 that he hates
[1:02:10] hypocrisy
[1:02:12] this is the word goes all the way in the
[1:02:14] Book of Revelations it talks about
[1:02:15] hating that false uh spirit of the false
[1:02:18] Antichrist system so God is a god of
[1:02:22] love but because he's a god of love it
[1:02:25] it necessitates that he hates anything
[1:02:27] that is in contradiction to himself
[1:02:33] he hates it in his word he hated it in
[1:02:35] Israel he hated in the New Testament
[1:02:37] Church and he hates it in our lives as
[1:02:40] believers anything that is contrary to
[1:02:43] the word of God anything that is dish
[1:02:46] disharmony or or or or or or or
[1:02:48] disagreement with the word of God and I
[1:02:51] just want to stop here and say Lord I
[1:02:53] want to sanctify myself of anything that
[1:02:55] is in contradiction to you Lord anything
[1:02:58] that's in my tongue I want you to purge
[1:03:01] it from my tongue come on somebody help
[1:03:04] me preach anything that's in my mind if
[1:03:06] my thoughts are are not pleasing to the
[1:03:09] Holy Spirit I don't want to grieve you
[1:03:11] Lord I want to be in harmony with your
[1:03:13] word I don't want to be in contradiction
[1:03:18] can you say that about your dress code
[1:03:20] sisters brothers can we say oh you
[1:03:23] thought oh my why would we go to that
[1:03:25] well we just read why we would go to
[1:03:27] that
[1:03:27] anything that that is in contradiction
[1:03:30] to the word of God God hates
[1:03:35] I don't just want to Elizabeth think
[1:03:37] like a Christian I want to live like a
[1:03:39] Christian I just want to say that I'm a
[1:03:42] Christian I want to dress like I'm a
[1:03:44] Christian I want to live like I'm a
[1:03:46] believer of the word of God
[1:03:49] whosoever dude don't love the things of
[1:03:52] the world the more you love God the more
[1:03:55] you hate those things that dishonor him
[1:03:58] the more you get in love with Jesus the
[1:04:01] more you hate evil the more you fall in
[1:04:03] love with this word the more you want to
[1:04:06] surrender your entire being to every
[1:04:08] part of the word of God
[1:04:12] do not love the world neither the things
[1:04:14] of the world
[1:04:16] none of those things even the things
[1:04:18] which blaspheme his name or bring
[1:04:21] dishonor to his word don't love the
[1:04:23] world this is first John 2 nor the
[1:04:26] things of the world
[1:04:30] so God's a god of love but he's also a
[1:04:33] god of hate can you say Amen
[1:04:35] the one who loves his brother notice
[1:04:37] this or tonight we're not to we're not
[1:04:39] to love the world you are from God this
[1:04:42] is first John 4 verse 4. you are from
[1:04:44] God little children and have overcome
[1:04:47] them because greater is he who is in you
[1:04:52] than he that is in the world
[1:04:57] notice they speak us from the things it
[1:04:59] says keep going here and he says they
[1:05:01] speak is from the world and the world
[1:05:03] listens to them we are from God he who
[1:05:06] knows God listens to us he who is not
[1:05:10] from God does not listen to us
[1:05:16] why won't they listened
[1:05:20] I try to tell them
[1:05:22] I invite them to church I tell them the
[1:05:24] word of God why won't they listen
[1:05:29] I try to witness to them I try to give
[1:05:32] them I try to give them the word of God
[1:05:34] why won't they listen hereby we know the
[1:05:37] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[1:05:44] so because there's a spirit of error
[1:05:47] that must mean there's a spirit of Truth
[1:05:50] if I can be an error if I was once an
[1:05:53] error that means I can be in the truth
[1:05:56] and so notice this here he says don't
[1:05:58] don't love the world which is what we
[1:06:01] spoke about is it's the cosmos
[1:06:04] it's not not just talking about the
[1:06:06] physical world although I there is a
[1:06:09] part of the Bible says that brother
[1:06:10] Branham said that even the world was in
[1:06:13] the book of redemption
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:16] so the world's a part of God so if I
[1:06:18] love God I'll love the world now not the
[1:06:21] cosmos not the order not the structure
[1:06:25] if you're a riff you really got the love
[1:06:27] of God you'll love God's creation
[1:06:31] well amen anyway
[1:06:34] you won't destroy man God you do you do
[1:06:36] everything you can uh to to preserve
[1:06:39] God's creation you'll love animals
[1:06:44] amen all of our animal lovers
[1:06:47] my wife just said amen
[1:06:50] you love them that don't mean you'll
[1:06:52] have to have to I'm not preaching you
[1:06:53] got to have dogs in your house or cats
[1:06:55] in your house or cows or chickens in
[1:06:57] your backyard but you'll love animals
[1:07:00] you won't hate them
[1:07:01] all right Lord I don't know where I'm at
[1:07:04] but
[1:07:06] so notice here you'll love the the world
[1:07:09] the cause not but you won't love the
[1:07:11] cosmos you want love of the order you
[1:07:14] want love the structure you want love
[1:07:16] the system
[1:07:18] of this world now so when we think of a
[1:07:22] world we could use that in terminology
[1:07:23] the World of Sports or the world of
[1:07:26] science it's not what we're talking
[1:07:27] about we're talking about an atmosphere
[1:07:29] we're talking about a construct we're
[1:07:31] talking about a system that was from the
[1:07:34] beginning the spirit of antichrist Paul
[1:07:37] said that even doth now work
[1:07:40] and the sons of Disobedience you say oh
[1:07:43] boy we're waiting for that Antichrist to
[1:07:44] come listen the Antichrist that comes in
[1:07:47] the flesh is only a physical
[1:07:49] manifestation of the spirit of the
[1:07:51] Antichrist that's here right now
[1:07:57] right it's an anti-anointing as we as we
[1:08:00] spoke to you just uh but when we came
[1:08:03] out here it's an anti-anointing can you
[1:08:05] say Amen
[1:08:07] so it's a it's a it's an anti-anointing
[1:08:11] it's incredible to me and even as I was
[1:08:14] even as I was just uh let me just find a
[1:08:16] note that I I wrote down here just the
[1:08:19] other day
[1:08:21] uh but it's amazing to me as I as I
[1:08:24] thought about this this is Hebrews
[1:08:25] chapter 12 verse 25.
[1:08:29] you see you see that you refuse not him
[1:08:33] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 see that you
[1:08:36] refuse not him that speaketh for if they
[1:08:40] who's speaking
[1:08:42] him
[1:08:45] and who is him the spirit of Truth
[1:08:48] now remember if you're of Truth you'll
[1:08:50] love truth
[1:08:52] I said if you're of Truth you won't
[1:08:54] question truth you'll believe truth
[1:08:57] because that's what a Believer does he
[1:08:59] believes the word of God he doesn't
[1:09:01] question the word of God he doesn't
[1:09:02] qualify the word of God he doesn't treat
[1:09:04] it like taxes and find a loophole in the
[1:09:06] word of God he surrenders his life to
[1:09:09] the word of God he that speaketh what is
[1:09:13] that voice it's the Voice of Truth
[1:09:16] notice this here Hebrews chapter 12
[1:09:18] verse 25 see that you refuse not him
[1:09:22] that speaketh for if they escape not who
[1:09:24] refused him that spoke on Earth much
[1:09:27] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[1:09:31] from him that speaketh from heaven
[1:09:36] isn't it amazing that the people who
[1:09:39] could sit and study the written law of
[1:09:42] Moses
[1:09:43] brother Brandon would say in one place
[1:09:45] that the scroll that can take a bound up
[1:09:47] Scroll of the law of Moses and they
[1:09:49] could take a pen and stick it through
[1:09:51] one side and out the other and tell you
[1:09:53] every letter that it hit is the PIN
[1:09:55] passed through that scroll they studied
[1:09:57] it they taught it they believed it they
[1:10:00] read it they heard about it
[1:10:01] intellectually they had it all bottled
[1:10:03] up in here
[1:10:05] yet those same people who could sit and
[1:10:08] study the written word of Moses and
[1:10:10] believe listen
[1:10:12] and believe the law of Moses yet they
[1:10:16] rejected the spoken words of Jesus
[1:10:19] coming from his mouth and his words were
[1:10:23] the Fulfillment of the scroll they
[1:10:25] believed
[1:10:30] so the same people refuse not him that
[1:10:32] speaketh so in other words people will
[1:10:35] never have trouble
[1:10:38] accepting the word that's written
[1:10:43] but where the Trouble Comes is when the
[1:10:45] word is spoken
[1:10:49] hello somebody
[1:10:51] they'll accept the word that's written
[1:10:53] they can accept the past the history as
[1:10:55] brother random says they're always
[1:10:56] thanking God for what he did always
[1:10:58] praising him for what he's going to do
[1:11:00] but missing or let me go further and say
[1:11:02] rejecting what he's doing right now see
[1:11:05] that she refused not him that speaketh
[1:11:08] they can believe the words of Moses they
[1:11:11] can accept the law of Moses but now when
[1:11:14] the Fulfillment of all of that law is
[1:11:16] now speaking They Crucified that one
[1:11:21] it's amazing to me they rejected the
[1:11:24] spoken word so what was it the law let
[1:11:27] me say this the law the word that was
[1:11:29] written became their comfort zone
[1:11:35] you think the devil you say well who
[1:11:36] gave them that the devil gave them that
[1:11:39] the devil will use religion and the word
[1:11:41] of God the devil will use the words
[1:11:43] written in your Bible that you read
[1:11:45] every day if you refuse him that
[1:11:48] speaketh
[1:11:49] he'll use that same written word to
[1:11:52] destroy you and blind you
[1:11:55] you say give me a scripture for that all
[1:11:57] right the letter killeth
[1:12:00] but the spirit giveth life
[1:12:03] and so just the written words of the
[1:12:06] Bible listen you can have all of the
[1:12:08] words of the message of the hour I'll go
[1:12:10] further than that and know all of the
[1:12:12] things the prophet taught now all of the
[1:12:14] doctrines but miss the spirit of him
[1:12:16] that speaketh
[1:12:20] so they can believe the words of Moses
[1:12:23] they can accept it the word of Moses the
[1:12:26] law of Moses became their comfort zone
[1:12:29] it's their religious duties it's their
[1:12:32] procedures and their rituals you know
[1:12:36] church and and religion can become like
[1:12:39] a comfort blanket to some people
[1:12:42] well I'm just going to keep preaching
[1:12:45] it can become a religious religion can
[1:12:47] become a covering as it did for Cain I
[1:12:50] think you did for Adam and Eve it can
[1:12:52] become just a covering something that
[1:12:54] covers you up and it and it drowns out
[1:12:57] him that speaketh
[1:12:59] you say then because why who's him that
[1:13:01] speaketh the anointed word
[1:13:03] the anointed word that's speaking by the
[1:13:06] spoken word
[1:13:09] and so the law became their comfort zone
[1:13:12] in so much that they use the law to
[1:13:16] justify rejecting the spoken word
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] oh I hope you're listening to me today
[1:13:33] the Fulfillment of that law
[1:13:39] let me just go further today
[1:13:41] then they could accept a prophet named
[1:13:44] Moses but ex but reject and refuse and
[1:13:46] crucify the word made flesh
[1:13:49] well let's just take it on a little bit
[1:13:51] further today they by the masses can
[1:13:54] accept the written words of Jesus but
[1:13:57] they reject the Jesus who spoke in this
[1:14:00] generation through a Vindicated prophet
[1:14:04] and even further than that they reject
[1:14:07] the voice of God that's speaking now
[1:14:09] through the bride of Christ that is the
[1:14:12] echo of that message that was sent
[1:14:16] let me say it again today they accept
[1:14:18] the words of Jesus don't you see friends
[1:14:21] it's the same exact thing
[1:14:24] it's the same exact pattern they accept
[1:14:26] what is people who say when they leave
[1:14:28] this message I just want Jesus I'm just
[1:14:31] going to find Jesus what are they saying
[1:14:33] they're comfortable with a Jesus written
[1:14:36] down on paper they're comfortable with
[1:14:38] the knowledge they can have in their
[1:14:40] mind but they refuse the Jesus who is
[1:14:43] still speaking who is still prophesying
[1:14:45] who is still showing himself alive oh I
[1:14:48] say today let this church say we accept
[1:14:50] the voice that's speaking we accept the
[1:14:53] Vindicated word of the hour we accept
[1:14:55] the Manifest of Jesus not just the Jesus
[1:14:59] of History
[1:15:02] they can accept it but they reject Jesus
[1:15:05] who spoke through this is why the very
[1:15:07] first verse that we wanted the first
[1:15:09] verses we read he that confesses that
[1:15:12] Jesus has come in the flesh
[1:15:16] that's where the brother random say
[1:15:18] that's where the trouble starts
[1:15:22] that's where the trouble begins
[1:15:25] when you say I and my father are one
[1:15:29] then they'll take up stones to crucify
[1:15:33] you
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:38] brother Brandon says if you want to know
[1:15:39] whose side you would have been and what
[1:15:41] have you been on if you lived in the
[1:15:42] days of Jesus look at what you did
[1:15:44] listen to me brother random says oh if I
[1:15:46] would have lived in those days of Jesus
[1:15:48] I wouldn't have been part of that mob
[1:15:50] yelling crucify him I would I would I
[1:15:52] wouldn't have been those Roman soldiers
[1:15:54] taking a hammer to nail his hands to
[1:15:57] that cross oh surely I would have never
[1:15:59] been if I if I was living in those days
[1:16:01] of Jesus I would have taken his side
[1:16:02] brother random says look at what you do
[1:16:05] with the word that's been made manifest
[1:16:08] today and it will tell you whose side
[1:16:10] you would have been on if you look at
[1:16:12] what you do with the word today it will
[1:16:15] tell you whose side you're really on
[1:16:19] brother Brandon says look at what you
[1:16:21] did look at what you do with the word
[1:16:23] made flesh today and your day and it
[1:16:26] will tell you
[1:16:28] whose side you would have been on and
[1:16:30] the days of Jesus
[1:16:34] people who loved listen to me people
[1:16:37] love the written word because it's
[1:16:40] contained like a painted fire
[1:16:43] you know there's a big difference
[1:16:44] between a painted fire you went to a
[1:16:46] restaurant there and we were there
[1:16:47] enough in Charlotte I think it was our
[1:16:49] Jacksonville and and they had the all in
[1:16:52] the restaurant they had eight or nine
[1:16:54] big TVs like this I don't play in a fire
[1:16:59] and it was it was a 24-hour uh unending
[1:17:03] fire and that thing just crackled it it
[1:17:05] popped and you could hear all the sound
[1:17:07] from it you could watch it and even
[1:17:09] there for a minute became sort of help
[1:17:11] the atmosphere it become mesmerized by
[1:17:13] just watching it but let me just tell
[1:17:15] you I didn't draw any warmth from that
[1:17:17] fire that fire was never a danger to me
[1:17:20] it was always contained on a screen so I
[1:17:23] was perfectly comfortable with all this
[1:17:24] the same exact way today people are fine
[1:17:27] as long as you preach a Jesus of
[1:17:29] yesterday oh somebody help me preach
[1:17:30] this morning people are always okay with
[1:17:33] the god you preach of yesterday because
[1:17:35] it's a painted fire a painted scripture
[1:17:37] or a contained quote but when you make
[1:17:40] that quote today when you take that
[1:17:42] Bible and you bring Jesus out of history
[1:17:45] and say he's present tense he is
[1:17:48] speaking right now that's where the
[1:17:50] Trouble Comes
[1:17:53] they're okay with that painted fire of
[1:17:55] Jesus they're okay with that historical
[1:17:57] figure of Jesus but they refuse him
[1:18:01] who's speaking
[1:18:04] are you with me here this morning
[1:18:07] so he says love not the things of the
[1:18:10] world the cosmos
[1:18:13] no we're not talking about Mother Nature
[1:18:14] listen there is no such thing as Mother
[1:18:17] Nature
[1:18:20] Jaws just dropped in it
[1:18:24] it's like I told you there's no such
[1:18:25] thing as the Tooth Fairy there's not
[1:18:26] there's no such thing as Santa Claus
[1:18:28] there's no such thing as Mother Nature
[1:18:33] listen Mother Nature doesn't deserve any
[1:18:35] glory god deserves all the glory and all
[1:18:38] the honor and all the praise you say
[1:18:39] well then how was the World created go
[1:18:41] read the book of Genesis the first two
[1:18:43] chapters I'll tell you who created the
[1:18:45] world it wasn't Mother Nature it was
[1:18:47] Papa God it was father God he deserves
[1:18:50] all the credit and all of the praise and
[1:18:52] all of the glory
[1:18:55] and so listen you say well what about
[1:18:57] science and so listen science has
[1:19:00] nothing to say about creation
[1:19:02] besides that did you read the Genesis
[1:19:04] account science has nothing to do with
[1:19:07] creation uh because it has absolutely
[1:19:09] nothing to do with it because it wasn't
[1:19:11] a scientific event the world being
[1:19:14] created was not a scientific event that
[1:19:16] happened
[1:19:19] it wasn't just nothing came from nothing
[1:19:22] and then more nothing created everything
[1:19:26] say them what was it it was a miracle
[1:19:30] it was the miracle of all miracles the
[1:19:32] world that you live in today is a
[1:19:33] miracle that's the problem is people
[1:19:35] can't accept the miraculous
[1:19:38] but it was a miracle you say what kind
[1:19:40] of Miracle one that can't be explained
[1:19:42] by science one that can't be studied or
[1:19:45] observed by nature or by a microscope it
[1:19:48] took the miraculous god brother random
[1:19:50] said he spoke and it was by his words of
[1:19:53] his mouth he said let there be and there
[1:19:56] was
[1:19:58] praise God
[1:20:00] so it was a miracle you can't explain it
[1:20:03] and notice when you acknowledge God as
[1:20:06] the Creator you have to acknowledge God
[1:20:09] that's why science cannot acknowledge
[1:20:12] and they will do every possible thing
[1:20:14] they can to watch why to to disprove the
[1:20:18] creation they'll do everything they can
[1:20:20] to to cause doubt or to or to try to
[1:20:23] bring up some kind of debate with
[1:20:25] creation because they can't understand a
[1:20:28] miracle and let me just go further and
[1:20:30] say some Christians will make the
[1:20:31] mistake of trying to go scientifically
[1:20:33] with them and scientifically prove
[1:20:35] creation you're going to get yourself in
[1:20:37] a in a pretzel that you can't untie
[1:20:39] because it can't be understood by
[1:20:42] science it can be understood by by
[1:20:45] knowledge or by reasoning that the the
[1:20:47] uh the Eternal God is not known by
[1:20:49] understanding he was a miracle he's a
[1:20:52] god of Miracles he can't be understood
[1:20:54] by knowledge he's got to be believed by
[1:20:57] a heart of Faith who says whether I
[1:20:59] understand it or not Lord whether I can
[1:21:01] explain it I believe every bit of
[1:21:03] whether I can put it on a chalkboard I
[1:21:06] accept everything that the word of God
[1:21:08] said and I don't need to understand it
[1:21:15] I don't need to understand everything
[1:21:17] say brother Matt hold on a minute you
[1:21:19] you are you are you saying there's
[1:21:21] anything wrong with trying to understand
[1:21:22] creation no I'm not trying to say that
[1:21:24] at all all creation gives glory and
[1:21:26] credit to God but you see the reason why
[1:21:29] people with the reason why the carnal
[1:21:31] mind cannot accept or call God the
[1:21:34] Creator is because when you call God the
[1:21:37] Creator then it must mean he was also
[1:21:40] the law Giver
[1:21:44] and that morals were given were
[1:21:46] established not by men not by not by
[1:21:48] reasoning but God gave us what it means
[1:21:51] to what right was and what wrong was
[1:21:54] when you call God the Creator that means
[1:21:57] he's the one who creates the the the law
[1:21:59] that means he's the one who creates the
[1:22:01] rules
[1:22:04] can you say Amen this morning
[1:22:07] because listen to me when you
[1:22:09] acknowledge Him as Creator you
[1:22:11] acknowledge Him as lawgiver because part
[1:22:13] of that creation part of what God
[1:22:16] created when he spoke was he put a law
[1:22:19] down inside of every human being to tell
[1:22:21] you what's right and what's wrong I
[1:22:24] to tell a boy how to not tell Allah
[1:22:26] listen that's why you hear Brother
[1:22:28] random saying you don't have to teach
[1:22:29] them kids how to lie they do it
[1:22:31] naturally
[1:22:32] when they're born you don't have to tell
[1:22:34] them they don't have to read a manual
[1:22:36] it's part of their nature
[1:22:38] to tell a lie
[1:22:41] well if you believe that then I must
[1:22:42] also believe that God also put something
[1:22:45] inside of a sea Gene of God and I don't
[1:22:47] have to indoctrinate them all that God
[1:22:49] has to do is flash his light across it
[1:22:51] and there's a nature down inside of them
[1:22:54] to accept God and to glorify God and to
[1:22:57] say I'm a Believer because that's a law
[1:22:59] he put down on the inside of me
[1:23:03] Hallelujah
[1:23:06] but they don't want to acknowledge God
[1:23:08] as Creator that's why men run from God
[1:23:11] as the Creator not because they don't
[1:23:14] like the idea that God created them but
[1:23:18] they don't like the idea that God is
[1:23:21] also their judge
[1:23:26] because when you acknowledge Him as
[1:23:28] Creator you acknowledge Him as judge
[1:23:32] so Jesus said don't love the things of
[1:23:34] the world the cosmos
[1:23:37] this is the order this is the physical
[1:23:39] structure we could say this is the this
[1:23:42] is the uh uh first John 15 18 if the
[1:23:46] world hates you you know that it hated
[1:23:48] me before it hated you if you were of
[1:23:50] the world the world would love its own
[1:23:51] but because you're not of the world but
[1:23:52] I chose you out of the world aren't you
[1:23:54] glad he chose me out of all of the
[1:23:57] construct and all of the structure and
[1:23:59] and all of the world order God chose me
[1:24:02] and pulled me out of this structure
[1:24:06] it shows you I have chose you because of
[1:24:09] this the world hates you
[1:24:13] because of this
[1:24:16] the world hates you
[1:24:19] listen to Jesus when he prays in John
[1:24:21] 17. I know we all love this chapter and
[1:24:23] he says I have given them your word
[1:24:29] speaking of the Apostles that were with
[1:24:30] him I have given
[1:24:33] film your word and the world has hated
[1:24:37] them
[1:24:39] the world has hated them because they're
[1:24:43] not of this world
[1:24:45] when you
[1:24:47] are not of this world
[1:24:49] the world will hate you
[1:24:54] let me go a little bit further than this
[1:24:55] and say that if in our social structures
[1:24:57] I don't care if it's in our business I'm
[1:25:00] not talking about you know that that you
[1:25:02] got to live like you know a a person who
[1:25:05] no one can't stand to be everyone can't
[1:25:07] stand to be around and and you're just
[1:25:09] always preaching repent or perish that's
[1:25:10] not what I'm talking about that's not
[1:25:11] what Jesus did Jesus lived the word of
[1:25:13] God and his works or his life reproved
[1:25:17] the darkness you don't have to say very
[1:25:20] much to make a sinner uncomfortable in
[1:25:22] your presence just live the life of
[1:25:24] Jesus and your life will reprove the
[1:25:27] darkness
[1:25:29] trust me I have we deal with it all the
[1:25:31] time you tell man we women men well I
[1:25:34] have to work around and tell a dirty
[1:25:36] joke and then there's that awkward
[1:25:37] silence when I don't laugh
[1:25:42] well it's true and if you go really god
[1:25:44] listen to me brother if you would laugh
[1:25:46] at a dirty joke I'd say there's
[1:25:47] something wrong with your experience you
[1:25:49] better go back and check it by the word
[1:25:51] of God if you're not if you're so
[1:25:53] awkwardly uncomfortable that you can't
[1:25:55] make yourself a spectacle and you gotta
[1:25:57] laugh with the jokes tell the dirty
[1:25:59] jokes and I listen to me brothers and
[1:26:01] sisters it's time the world knew that
[1:26:04] there's a body of believers who aren't
[1:26:06] of this world they don't live like the
[1:26:09] world they don't joke like the world
[1:26:11] they don't dress like The World God Made
[1:26:13] You different for a reason
[1:26:19] they hate because I've given them your
[1:26:21] word because they're not of the world
[1:26:23] the world hates you listen if you're
[1:26:26] comfortable in this world I would doubt
[1:26:28] your experience I'm just going to go
[1:26:30] ahead and preach it today if you're
[1:26:31] living in laodicea and you're
[1:26:33] comfortable and you fit in I would doubt
[1:26:35] your experience in the Holy Ghost
[1:26:37] because the Bible says whoever's in
[1:26:40] Christ is a new creation all his old
[1:26:43] life and his old worldly ways are God
[1:26:45] and he's new with newness of life he
[1:26:48] walks different he talks different he
[1:26:50] sings different he dresses different he
[1:26:52] lives different and everybody knows it
[1:26:57] how many Believers we got that believes
[1:26:59] that
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:01] so John is saying you can't love the
[1:27:03] world
[1:27:04] because why because this world is
[1:27:07] Satan's Eden
[1:27:09] it's a system of evil
[1:27:14] and boy if it's ever made more manifest
[1:27:17] than it is today than it's ever been
[1:27:19] before it's in opposition to everything
[1:27:22] that the Bible stands for
[1:27:25] now I'm not talking about the
[1:27:27] watered-down world that wants to make
[1:27:29] Jesus relatable
[1:27:32] to the world come on somebody help me
[1:27:34] don't let me lose you on this we're
[1:27:35] believers I'm not talking about the
[1:27:38] Jesus who socially accepted and socially
[1:27:40] taught and we just preach that God is
[1:27:42] the god of love and we preach all of the
[1:27:44] gospels but we don't preach that God's
[1:27:46] also a god of hate he's also a God of
[1:27:48] Justice he's also a god of his word he's
[1:27:50] not a god of compromise
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] as we said Wednesday night when Jesus
[1:27:57] preached his gospel it got him crucified
[1:28:00] when Paul did it got his head cut off
[1:28:02] when all of the Apostles preach you go
[1:28:04] and read the way each one of those
[1:28:06] Apostles died
[1:28:08] what was it it was the truth and the
[1:28:11] truth brings separation
[1:28:13] can you say Amen
[1:28:15] the truth brings a separation
[1:28:19] and so notice this here in first John 4
[1:28:21] beloved do not believe every spirit
[1:28:26] but try the spirits
[1:28:29] to see whether they're from God because
[1:28:32] many false prophets have gone out into
[1:28:36] this world
[1:28:38] many so you can't believe everything
[1:28:40] don't he said don't don't just accept
[1:28:43] anything
[1:28:44] but try it you say try it by what the
[1:28:47] word
[1:28:49] as brother Brandon said give it the word
[1:28:51] test
[1:28:53] and he says don't he says don't believe
[1:28:55] every spirit and he and he says because
[1:28:57] there's many false prophets that have
[1:28:59] gone out of this world so by this you
[1:29:01] know the spirit of God and every spirit
[1:29:04] that confess that Jesus Christ has come
[1:29:06] in the flesh is from God every spirit
[1:29:08] that doesn't confess Jesus is not from
[1:29:10] God this is the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:29:13] of which you've heard that it is coming
[1:29:15] and now it's already in the world you're
[1:29:18] from God little children and have
[1:29:20] overcome them because greater is he
[1:29:22] that's in you than who he that is in the
[1:29:25] world so in John 12 Jesus calls him the
[1:29:29] prince of the world not God not Jehovah
[1:29:33] the devil
[1:29:35] you want to know who the prince of the
[1:29:36] world is Satan
[1:29:40] that'll give you more sense why God says
[1:29:42] don't love this world because it's
[1:29:44] Prince is the devil
[1:29:47] and he's in control of politics he's in
[1:29:51] control of religion
[1:29:54] it was bad enough when he was out in the
[1:29:56] white house it's even worse now that
[1:29:57] he's in the church
[1:30:00] foreign
[1:30:05] he controls politics he's the prince of
[1:30:09] the world
[1:30:10] Ephesians 2 2. notice this here this is
[1:30:13] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 in which you
[1:30:16] formally walked according to the course
[1:30:19] of this world
[1:30:21] according to the prince of the power of
[1:30:24] the air of the spirit that is now
[1:30:27] working in the sons of disobedience
[1:30:33] he walked according to the lust of your
[1:30:35] flesh the lust of your eyes the pride of
[1:30:37] life all of us of such were some of you
[1:30:39] there's not one of us that was exempt
[1:30:41] from that that's why we can have Grace
[1:30:43] for anybody
[1:30:46] I don't care how dark I don't care how
[1:30:48] demented I don't care how tattooed and
[1:30:50] earring they are up I don't care how far
[1:30:52] and how distant they are of such were
[1:30:55] some of you if God gives us Grace how
[1:30:57] much more should we give Grace to others
[1:30:59] to say God can transform your life he
[1:31:02] could take that old heart of evil desire
[1:31:04] out of you he could deliver you from
[1:31:06] those cigarettes in that nicotine he can
[1:31:08] deliver how do I know that because God
[1:31:10] I've watched God do it over and over and
[1:31:13] over again to believe he's still the god
[1:31:15] of transformation
[1:31:18] and so notice he says you walked
[1:31:20] according to the desires of the Flesh
[1:31:22] and in the mind remember why when were
[1:31:24] by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:31:28] even as others so notice this here even
[1:31:33] in Isaiah if you have your Bible we're
[1:31:34] going to close here just in a few
[1:31:36] minutes so don't get nervous as brother
[1:31:38] Diggs says we're going to close
[1:31:40] notice this here in Isaiah if you have
[1:31:42] if you have your Bible to turn to Isaiah
[1:31:43] chapter 20. I want to just read this
[1:31:46] together
[1:31:49] you love the Lord
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:52] notice this here this is Isaiah this is
[1:31:55] uh this is the words as we as we quoted
[1:31:58] this there's pick it up from where we
[1:31:59] took off Isaiah 21 sorry forgive me
[1:32:01] Isaiah chapter 21 verse 3. brother Mark
[1:32:04] Isaiah 21 and verse 3. so the prophet
[1:32:07] gives us here's here's Isaiah and he's
[1:32:10] prophesying and he's and he's he's
[1:32:13] lamenting he's we're not going to read
[1:32:15] the entire chapter but he says my loins
[1:32:17] are are filled up and I I'm in Graham
[1:32:20] and Isaiah seeing this vision of this
[1:32:21] coming Army that's going to come and
[1:32:24] destroy the entire world and he says
[1:32:26] here in verse 3 he says therefore are my
[1:32:29] loins filled with pain pains have not
[1:32:31] taken hold upon me as the pangs of a
[1:32:33] woman that trevella our pains have taken
[1:32:35] a hold of me as the pangs of a woman
[1:32:37] that child this is what a prophet does
[1:32:39] because he's a Seer because he could see
[1:32:42] what you can't see
[1:32:45] I'm so glad we've had a prophet in this
[1:32:47] age and he could see what I couldn't see
[1:32:51] you say why are you happy because he
[1:32:53] could warn me of those things I would
[1:32:55] have been clueless about listen had it
[1:32:58] not been for a Vindicated prophet in
[1:33:00] this age I would be just like the rest
[1:33:02] of the world going to the church down
[1:33:04] the street but God opened my eyes and
[1:33:07] warned me of things to come I'm so
[1:33:10] thankful today that to be identified by
[1:33:13] Jesus who revealed himself in this day
[1:33:17] you said brother man do you believe
[1:33:18] that's what the message is that is what
[1:33:20] the message is
[1:33:21] it's him he the spirit of Truth speaking
[1:33:25] through a Vindicated mouthpiece
[1:33:28] so notice this here he says as the Pains
[1:33:31] of omen the throne are bowed down at the
[1:33:33] hearing of it I was dismayed at the
[1:33:36] scene of it
[1:33:38] something that was terrifying Isaiah
[1:33:41] it's a horrifying vision
[1:33:44] his brother random says he even tries to
[1:33:45] relate that to visions and he's talking
[1:33:47] to to Gordon Lindsay and brother Gordon
[1:33:50] asked him said brother Adam how does it
[1:33:51] work he says up just like I'm seeing you
[1:33:54] now brother Gordon just as I'm standing
[1:33:56] here watching you and and looking at you
[1:33:58] and hearing your words the same exact
[1:33:59] way I'll break into a vision and he says
[1:34:02] it's just as real as you're standing
[1:34:03] right here and as a Seer he sees
[1:34:06] everything from the past to the present
[1:34:08] to the future he could look at someone's
[1:34:10] life and he could look all the way
[1:34:12] they're that person is standing in front
[1:34:14] of them at 30 40 years old and he looks
[1:34:18] all the way to the day when they were an
[1:34:20] eight-year-old girl
[1:34:24] he could look all the way in the past of
[1:34:27] their life and so Isaiah's not looking
[1:34:28] in the past he's looking in the future
[1:34:32] and he says that Vision this Vision that
[1:34:34] I had was terrifying oh it seized me
[1:34:37] like the Pains of a woman in in labor he
[1:34:41] says I'm so terrified my my mind reels
[1:34:44] horror listen to Listen to verse four
[1:34:47] just keep going and he says my heart
[1:34:49] panted
[1:34:50] fearfulness afraided me the night of my
[1:34:54] pleasure hath he turned into fear unto
[1:34:57] me Isaiah couldn't control this this was
[1:34:59] the vision of the Lord
[1:35:01] and so you say brother brother Matt what
[1:35:03] caused the convulsion of this Prophet
[1:35:06] what caused all of the sorrow why did
[1:35:09] his beat he says my you know what that
[1:35:10] means when it says my heart panted it
[1:35:13] means it's deadly
[1:35:15] this is something so overwhelming to him
[1:35:17] he's an anguish
[1:35:19] and he says because I've seen a storm
[1:35:21] coming in the desert
[1:35:24] and that storm it was a massive enemy
[1:35:27] all of the Dust he sees the look like a
[1:35:29] twister in the desert look like an ocean
[1:35:32] and he says the the the the the sand and
[1:35:35] the the the the the the the the Cyclones
[1:35:37] and Isaiah says and I realized it was an
[1:35:40] Army
[1:35:41] it was an army of soldiers Riders
[1:35:44] horsemens
[1:35:46] trains of donkeys and camels and pears
[1:35:50] it was a massive enemy Army coming to
[1:35:54] destroy
[1:35:55] and he says he that hears in this
[1:35:57] spiritual with the spiritual eyes the
[1:35:59] downfall look at verse 20. look at verse
[1:36:01] 9 brother Mark let's just read it
[1:36:03] together
[1:36:04] and I'm just going to take a minute to
[1:36:05] read some of these verses look at verse
[1:36:07] 9. verse nine okay that's fine I've got
[1:36:09] it here before me and he says it was the
[1:36:11] downfall I've got the the notation wrong
[1:36:13] and he sees the listen to me you say
[1:36:16] what's he seeing brother Matt he's
[1:36:17] seeing the end of all he's in the end of
[1:36:19] all things
[1:36:20] do you know there's coming an end
[1:36:23] to all things
[1:36:26] there's coming an end to time there's
[1:36:29] coming in and there's coming an end to
[1:36:31] to the world there's coming into these
[1:36:33] things
[1:36:34] there's a day of expiration
[1:36:39] you know what that ought to do that
[1:36:41] ought to make us make our call in an
[1:36:42] election sure
[1:36:45] it also ought to make us rejoice that
[1:36:47] there's coming into pain
[1:36:49] there's coming an end to sorrow
[1:36:52] oh come on somebody there's coming an
[1:36:55] end distress there's coming an end
[1:36:57] anxiety you don't have to work all your
[1:36:59] life there's coming an end to all of
[1:37:01] that trouble
[1:37:03] and Isaiah sees the incoming he says in
[1:37:07] verse 7 this is Isaiah 21 and he says he
[1:37:10] sees the coming judgment and he says in
[1:37:12] Isaiah 21 verse 7 do you have that
[1:37:15] brother Mark 20 21 7. I must have it
[1:37:18] wrong that's okay no no problem
[1:37:22] Isaiah 21 you've got 21 7.
[1:37:25] I'm reading it here in in my Bible I'm
[1:37:27] sorry
[1:37:29] Isaiah chapter 21. so notice this here
[1:37:33] that's all right you can you can you can
[1:37:34] lit you can just have have me read it
[1:37:36] that's just that's just fine so he sees
[1:37:38] the end of all things he says here and
[1:37:40] he says he says uh uh he said he says
[1:37:43] pay close attention pay very close
[1:37:46] attention rise up
[1:37:48] rise up this is the words of Isaiah to
[1:37:52] the family of God
[1:37:53] this is the words of a prophet rise up
[1:37:57] oil the shields
[1:38:00] sharpen the swords what's he saying
[1:38:03] prepare yourself
[1:38:04] get ready wake up this is what Jesus
[1:38:07] said when he said watch
[1:38:09] that that you be found worthy to escape
[1:38:12] all these things watch and be sober

[1:38:39] you got to tell it reprove rebuke with
[1:38:42] all long suffering
[1:38:44] not to declare the whole counsel of God
[1:38:49] this is what the Bible says we read it
[1:38:51] Wednesday for there's coming a
[1:38:53] generation of people that have no
[1:38:55] spiritual appetite for the true word of

[1:41:39] just tell me things I want to hear
[1:41:43] just don't tell me tell me how good I am
[1:41:46] you say brother Matt that sounds comical
[1:41:48] listen friends this is whether you
[1:41:50] realize it or not it's inside of my
[1:41:51] nature and it's inside of your nature to
[1:41:54] hate correction we hate it
[1:41:57] this flesh
[1:42:00] but down on the inside man there's
[1:42:03] something that rises up and says I want
[1:42:05] to be right
[1:42:08] how many believe that today and say I
[1:42:09] want to be right Lord
[1:42:13] I want to be right for this coming a
[1:42:15] time when they shall not endure sound
[1:42:16] Doctrine but shall Heap unto themselves
[1:42:18] teachers
[1:42:20] having itching ears
[1:42:24] Isaiah says pick up the swords
[1:42:27] oil oil the shields
[1:42:30] I'm closing okay
[1:42:33] rise up oil the shields verse 5.
[1:42:36] but you know what the Bible says
[1:42:38] no one's listening
[1:42:41] imagine what this would do for for
[1:42:43] Isaiah
[1:42:46] hear the prophets sees the destruction
[1:42:50] and he's yelling it he's preaching it
[1:42:53] he's declaring it he's taking him by the
[1:42:56] hand he's saying listen this is what's
[1:42:58] coming and Isaiah says no one's listened
[1:43:01] prepare the table watch in the
[1:43:04] Watchtower eat drink arise you princess
[1:43:07] and anoint the shield this is the words
[1:43:11] he's declaring
[1:43:12] but no one's listening
[1:43:17] here it is judgment's coming
[1:43:22] it's been pronounced brother random says
[1:43:24] what what's left after you neglect to
[1:43:29] heed the warning
[1:43:33] there's only one thing left
[1:43:36] judgment
[1:43:38] and here's judgment coming marching
[1:43:41] armies outside the gate the Day of
[1:43:44] Reckoning
[1:43:45] has come and the prophet's voice is
[1:43:48] shouting get back in line
[1:43:51] get back in Step the prophet's word is
[1:43:55] is declaring pay attention be sober be
[1:43:58] vigilant oil The Shield sharpen the
[1:44:01] swords
[1:44:03] but what are they doing they ignore the
[1:44:05] warning
[1:44:06] they go about their ways eating drinking
[1:44:08] making Mary spreading out of table of
[1:44:11] prosperity and success they say brother
[1:44:13] Matt How could a person how could a
[1:44:16] person hear the warning of judgment and
[1:44:18] just keep going about their merry way
[1:44:20] I'm going to tell you why because Jesus
[1:44:22] says with ears they hear not and with
[1:44:25] eyes they see not they're deaf they're
[1:44:29] blind you say what's death and film
[1:44:31] what's blinded them their own deceits
[1:44:34] that's what the scripture says their own
[1:44:36] vanity their own deceit has blinded
[1:44:38] their minds they don't want to hear
[1:44:41] about it they want to hear good things
[1:44:42] they don't want to hear about Gloom they
[1:44:44] don't want to hear about destruction
[1:44:45] they want to have Happy Days prosperous
[1:44:48] days uh tell me tell me tell me about
[1:44:51] the good days coming
[1:44:53] don't tell me about the bad days
[1:44:54] awaiting
[1:44:57] this is so far that in Isaiah chapter
[1:45:00] 30. notice what it says in verse 9
[1:45:02] Isaiah chapter 30 brother Mark
[1:45:05] this is the rebellious children
[1:45:08] lying children Isaiah 30. verse 9 and
[1:45:11] verse 10. you can have it if you have it
[1:45:12] in your Bible you can turn there
[1:45:14] yourself
[1:45:15] that this is the rebellious people
[1:45:19] that will not hear the law of the Lord
[1:45:22] verse 10 verse 10.
