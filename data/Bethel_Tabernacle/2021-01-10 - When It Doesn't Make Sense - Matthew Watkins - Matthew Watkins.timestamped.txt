[38:57] how often we've
[38:59] been in this place where david is the
[39:02] lord praying and
[39:03] asking you lord how long oh lord i pray
[39:06] god that your word would be
[39:08] father may it be very lord comforting to
[39:11] your people may it
[39:12] speak to their hearts specifically lord
[39:15] i know god that you
[39:16] move lord in mysterious ways i trust you
[39:19] lord and i lean upon you now may you
[39:20] just come and bless it
[39:22] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[39:24] you can be seated
[39:29] i'm going to move this here
[39:39] we know that the bible declares
[39:43] so many things about david and it calls
[39:46] him
[39:46] a man after my own heart the lord said
[39:50] i'll give you a man after mine own heart
[39:53] and so
[39:53] david repeats this in psalms chapter 13
[39:57] and we're just going to go through this
[39:59] slowly here as we go through some of
[40:00] these verses and just lay out
[40:02] maybe a foundation and see what where
[40:05] the lord brings us to this morning
[40:08] but i think it's amazing because he goes
[40:11] through this uh cry here in psalms
[40:14] chapter 13
[40:16] and he says we're just going to read
[40:18] verse 1 again
[40:19] how long will thou forget me o lord
[40:22] and then he asks forever how long will
[40:25] thou
[40:26] wilt thou hide thy face for me
[40:29] it's amazing because you don't find
[40:31] anywhere in psalms 13 that i could find
[40:34] that david has sinned there's prayers
[40:36] that you'll read
[40:38] that he prays after sin psalms 55 would
[40:41] be one of them
[40:42] but we don't have any indication here
[40:44] that david is praying because
[40:47] of some trap that he's fallen into or
[40:50] some sin in his life
[40:52] but actually this was uh the enemy who
[40:54] was
[40:55] uh trying to kill him and trying to take
[40:58] his life
[40:59] and in spite of all of david's prayers
[41:03] and praying out to god and in spite of
[41:06] how many times he had no doubt cried
[41:08] unto the lord he's saying this in psalms
[41:10] 13
[41:11] how long will thou forget me o lord
[41:13] because
[41:14] no doubt he had cried unto the lord he
[41:16] had
[41:17] petitioned god he had brought his need
[41:20] to the lord
[41:21] already in times past he had maybe
[41:24] consulted the lord we see this
[41:26] as something that paul says i
[41:30] consulted the lord three times to ask
[41:33] him to take it away from me
[41:34] same exact language where you have the
[41:37] apostle paul
[41:38] saying and confessing you're not the
[41:41] only one who has approached
[41:43] god more than one time for a need in
[41:46] your life
[41:48] and so many times you know we could say
[41:50] that here today that there's been
[41:51] multiple
[41:52] times maybe something that you're
[41:54] praying about today or you've considered
[41:56] and asked the lord and you've petitioned
[41:58] from your heart
[41:59] and you you've you've asked the lord for
[42:01] something specific in your life or
[42:03] you're
[42:04] praying about the uh the will of god and
[42:07] you know sometimes we can
[42:08] uh if you know we can become in this we
[42:11] can get to this place that
[42:13] that david was where we could say this
[42:15] from our hearts and say
[42:17] how long lord will you forget me how
[42:20] long will you hide your face for me says
[42:22] in verse 2
[42:23] how long shall i take counsel in my soul
[42:26] having sorrow in my heart daily
[42:30] how long shall my enemy be exalted
[42:34] over me and it seems that david is
[42:38] is asking this petition and he's crying
[42:40] out to god and you know that can be
[42:42] a very discouraging thing for a believer
[42:45] it can become to the point to where the
[42:47] mind battle of why god
[42:49] isn't answering is worse than the fact
[42:51] that he hasn't answered
[42:55] yeah sometimes it could become more
[42:58] perplexing trying to find the will of
[43:00] god
[43:00] than the will of god itself and just to
[43:03] say lord i'm in such a quandary i've
[43:05] i've
[43:06] petitioned you i've asked you maybe
[43:08] prayers over
[43:09] uh you know an unsaved loved one maybe a
[43:12] child or a situation
[43:14] in your home or in your health or
[43:16] whatever
[43:17] uh front the enemy is attacking because
[43:19] the enemy attacks on all levels
[43:22] if he can't get you mentally he'll
[43:24] attack you physically and if he can't
[43:26] attack you physically
[43:27] he'll come to you spiritually and then
[43:29] if he can't get there he'll come into
[43:31] some root of bitterness and attach you
[43:33] attack you
[43:34] emotionally can i preach to somebody
[43:36] this morning
[43:37] and so on all fronts uh satan is is uh
[43:40] can bombard us
[43:42] and david was crying over his own life
[43:44] and it seemed like god was just
[43:47] unavailable it seemed like god had just
[43:49] taken a vacation this is what he's
[43:51] expressing here in psalms 13.
[43:54] it seems like i've petitioned you i've
[43:56] prayed i've
[43:57] i've brought my request i've made them
[43:59] known i've obeyed the scriptures i've
[44:01] i don't understand this just doesn't
[44:04] make any sense to me god
[44:06] and there's sometimes god doesn't make
[44:08] sense
[44:10] there's times when his word uh if
[44:13] applied to our life and there's a
[44:15] certain situation and
[44:16] uh whatever it would be this morning
[44:18] sometimes it just doesn't make sense and
[44:20] we can ask that
[44:22] question uh why lord what as david is
[44:25] asking here why
[44:26] why why did it happen why did i why did
[44:29] why did why am i at this place that i'm
[44:31] at right now and you can look back over
[44:33] your life sometime and the devil will be
[44:35] quick to remind you of
[44:37] all of the the obedience that you've had
[44:39] and all of the things you've done for
[44:41] the lord and all that you've given up
[44:43] just as he did brother branham oh look
[44:45] at you you've given up everything for
[44:47] him you've preached and
[44:48] everybody's rejected you and what have
[44:50] you done for the lord notice
[44:52] he wasn't the devil didn't come to
[44:53] brother branham just highlighting his
[44:55] baby
[44:56] are you here today but he started going
[44:59] over his life and his ministry and
[45:01] saying look at what you've done for the
[45:02] lord look at how you've lived
[45:04] for him you've preached and you you've
[45:06] had nowhere to lay your head you've been
[45:07] in meetings for hours and hours and
[45:09] hours and
[45:10] and he says and you've given up
[45:12] everything and brother adam says yeah
[45:13] that's true
[45:16] this is the perplexity david was in when
[45:18] he says
[45:19] you know it just seems like god is not
[45:22] speaking he's not available it's it's it
[45:26] seems that he's
[45:27] so distant from me and oftentimes that's
[45:30] exactly if we'd
[45:32] uh be honest here today sometimes it
[45:34] seems like
[45:35] god has forgotten you amen sometimes it
[45:39] seems like if he's not forgotten you
[45:41] he's hiding from you he's hiding his
[45:43] face from you
[45:44] and and and david asked this question in
[45:46] such a just
[45:47] such a real a way that we could so
[45:50] relate to
[45:52] and he says how long will you forgive me
[45:54] o lord
[45:55] forever forever david just ask is it
[45:59] going to be forever is this
[46:01] is it always going to be like this lord
[46:03] is it just going to keep lasting and
[46:04] going on and on and on
[46:06] and it seems like sometimes we can go
[46:09] through certain
[46:10] struggles in our life and trials in our
[46:12] life and it just
[46:13] feels like it's lasting forever
[46:16] and it seems like there's just no end in
[46:19] sight
[46:20] and it just seems like it's it's just so
[46:22] drawn out and
[46:24] and it's and it's long and how long am i
[46:26] going to go through this and you're and
[46:28] it just seems like such a waiting period
[46:29] and man
[46:30] we hate to wait we
[46:33] hate to wait i don't care if i'm waiting
[46:36] on my kids if i'm waiting on my family
[46:38] if i'm waiting at the stoplight or if
[46:40] i'm waiting on god
[46:42] we hate to wait right
[46:46] some of us hate it worse than others
[46:49] but waiting is especially hard when you
[46:53] don't have anything to occupy yourself
[46:56] when you don't have anything to do
[46:57] you're just you're just waiting it feels
[46:58] like you're waiting for nothing
[47:00] and and and it's it's just a it seems
[47:03] like just
[47:04] such a and you can notice this in psalms
[47:07] this is psalms 13 where david is being
[47:09] pursued
[47:10] by a man who he tried to save
[47:14] now remember this came out of a
[47:15] righteous act
[47:17] this is after david's anointing after
[47:20] samuel pours the anointed oil over his
[47:22] head and the oil's running from his head
[47:24] down
[47:25] through his beard and he's anointing him
[47:27] as king and he's 80s and it's all about
[47:29] the projection of where
[47:30] david's going to be and where he's going
[47:32] to finally end up and where
[47:34] after it's not it's not just the here
[47:36] and now david but
[47:37] it's the ultimate picture of where
[47:39] you're going to be where your life's
[47:40] going to end up
[47:42] it's never the problem never comes with
[47:44] the beginning of the anointing
[47:46] or where the anointing is going to end
[47:48] it's what happens in the middle that we
[47:50] have so much trouble with
[47:53] if you can lay out the life of men of
[47:54] god take joseph
[47:56] you know just for example if you could
[47:59] lay out their life
[48:00] and we can look at it linearly
[48:03] can i say that word right linear if we
[48:05] could look at it linear
[48:07] and you were to lay out almost like a 3d
[48:10] scale if you were to ever look at a 3d
[48:12] or a a you know like a city that you
[48:15] could look at
[48:15] you know like a little um city miniature
[48:17] city and you could look at
[48:20] and shrink the life of joseph and you
[48:23] were to look at the
[48:24] from the time that he gets the dream
[48:28] and here he comes with the dream and
[48:29] god's gonna you know what what god
[48:31] of the the the vision that god has for
[48:34] his life he has the
[48:35] code of many colors and and we know
[48:38] joseph's entire life of the promise that
[48:40] god has given him
[48:41] but so much had happened if you look at
[48:44] it linear
[48:45] so much had happened from the time he
[48:47] had gotten the dream
[48:49] all the way to the time he's sitting
[48:52] on the throne amen now we'd love to just
[48:55] fast forward and go straight from the
[48:57] vision straight from the dream
[48:59] straight from the promise to the tower
[49:02] to the kingdom
[49:03] to the throne but it's
[49:06] it's you have to understand that it's
[49:09] what
[49:09] happens in the middle
[49:12] that brings you to the throne it's what
[49:16] happens in the middle it's what happens
[49:18] from the anointing running down david's
[49:21] beard
[49:21] uh to the time when he's sitting in
[49:23] jerusalem as the king
[49:25] it's god says david in order for me to
[49:27] get you from the anointing to the place
[49:29] i'm trying to bring
[49:30] you you've got to go through what's in
[49:32] the middle
[49:33] because the secret is in what's in the
[49:35] middle
[49:36] because your character to sit on that
[49:38] throne happens in the middle
[49:41] hallelujah joseph for you to ever sit
[49:44] on the throne you've got to go through
[49:46] the slavery you've got to go through
[49:47] being sold you've got to go through
[49:48] potiphar's house and through the prison
[49:52] and david before you ever get to the
[49:54] throne you've got to go through the cave
[49:56] of a dulum
[49:57] where you're running for your life
[50:01] you imagine just the the shock that he
[50:03] has
[50:05] as many times we don't we get the
[50:07] promise of god
[50:08] but we don't see everything that's going
[50:09] to happen in the middle
[50:11] and and and no no david never seen this
[50:14] coming
[50:15] and there he is running for his life and
[50:19] uh as we said he's being chased by by
[50:22] by saul and he's holed up
[50:26] he's a he's a brother and calls him a
[50:28] renegade
[50:29] and he's running and he's just a
[50:31] renegade and and
[50:32] and he's he's he's a nobody at this time
[50:35] he's not a king
[50:36] he doesn't have a throne he doesn't have
[50:38] an army doesn't have men
[50:40] it doesn't have a great great great uh
[50:42] great great uh a great army to fight for
[50:44] him he just has a few men
[50:46] who are faithful to david and the bible
[50:50] says that david is
[50:51] is begins to cry this and he says how
[50:53] long consider and hear me o lord in
[50:55] verse 3
[50:56] lighten my eyes lest i sleep the sleep
[50:58] of death lest mine enemies say i
[51:00] prevailed against him and those that
[51:01] trouble me rejoice
[51:04] when i am moved he's here in the
[51:07] desolate
[51:08] wilderness of judah and about
[51:11] all that he has at this time is just the
[51:14] men
[51:15] that he and his daily provisions just a
[51:17] few men that around him
[51:19] and his daily provisions and he's he's
[51:21] he's he's hiding for
[51:23] days and then uh days or hours and then
[51:27] hours turn into days and days turn into
[51:29] weeks and weeks turn into months and
[51:31] months turn into years sometimes
[51:34] through that middle stage
[51:37] and he's and and no doubt it this seems
[51:40] to just drag on and
[51:42] drag on and drag on and my how long is
[51:45] this gonna
[51:45] drag on and it's just going on and on
[51:48] before god
[51:50] uh begins to act and begin begins to
[51:52] speak
[51:53] and sometimes you know it's it's it's
[51:55] god moves brother branham said the holy
[51:57] spirit the holy ghost isn't
[51:59] hasty so don't be hasty he's not in a
[52:02] hurry you know we get in a hurry but
[52:05] god's not in a hurry
[52:08] god's not in a hurry and sometimes it
[52:10] seems god is moving slower
[52:12] than what we want to move at and he's
[52:14] moving at a slower pace and god's
[52:16] moving slow and it seems like we live in
[52:19] that
[52:20] the age of such brother branham called
[52:22] it uh the the
[52:23] age of neurotics and he said it's just a
[52:25] pressurized age and you're constantly
[52:27] under pressure
[52:28] you're in a hurry hurry hurry hurry go
[52:30] go go only to stop and wait you remember
[52:32] that and letting off the pressure
[52:34] he says you go from one place and if
[52:35] we're not careful we can
[52:37] we can this can this can trickle down
[52:39] into our relationship with the lord
[52:42] well we're just in a hurry just come on
[52:44] god just speed it up i mean
[52:46] let's let's let's go you know let's go
[52:49] what are we waiting on let's let's hurry
[52:52] i've already got anointed
[52:54] give me the throne i already got my
[52:57] anointing let me be king now
[52:59] no david you got to go through the
[53:01] wilderness you got to go through the
[53:02] rejection you got to go through the
[53:03] misery
[53:04] amen because the only way you'll ever be
[53:07] fit
[53:08] for the throne is if you can come
[53:11] through times in your life where
[53:14] it just doesn't make any sense
[53:19] and god is moving and moving and moving
[53:21] in and and
[53:23] it's amazing because god has such a
[53:26] different i just want to slow down on
[53:27] this less i just
[53:28] gloss over it sometimes it feels like
[53:30] god has such a different timetable
[53:33] than us we would have thought years ago
[53:36] we would have been out of here you'd
[53:39] have never thought you were
[53:40] you are where you are right now you
[53:43] never would have thought here we are at
[53:44] 2021
[53:47] you never would have thought that never
[53:50] thought i'm at 20
[53:51] 21. you got to be kidding me and we got
[53:54] it we got a new administration and the
[53:55] world's just gonna
[53:56] how long is this going god's timetable
[53:58] is completely different than ours
[54:02] and we can think in terms of hours and
[54:04] minutes and days but
[54:05] and and sometimes god works in years or
[54:08] he works in a timetable that maybe
[54:12] isn't the same as what you're
[54:13] comfortable with as we said
[54:15] even the we pointed to the life of you
[54:18] think of joseph's life
[54:20] if you were to look at it linear you're
[54:23] able to
[54:24] shrink it down to a microscopic size
[54:26] just to a size where you could look at
[54:28] everything
[54:28] now we can see the picture
[54:32] of joseph's life that god has a plan for
[54:34] him
[54:35] i'm going to jump here back and forth so
[54:37] just stay with me here
[54:39] god has a plan for him you're going to
[54:41] raise up to a mighty position in
[54:43] egypt it's going to ultimately be for
[54:46] the
[54:47] salvation of you and your entire family
[54:51] you're going to be a ruler over all of
[54:54] egypt
[54:55] but it's amazing because when when
[54:59] how god gets joseph there
[55:02] god says i've given you a dream
[55:06] and he says but how i'm going to place
[55:08] you and what the
[55:10] where you're going to have to what
[55:11] you're going to have to go through to
[55:12] get from here
[55:14] to here joseph first
[55:17] over here we see about right here's the
[55:20] dream and about right here
[55:22] you're going to be sold as a slave
[55:27] it'll be sold into slavery joseph
[55:31] and it's going to be hard it's not going
[55:32] to make sense
[55:34] it's not going to make sense i'll give
[55:36] you a dream with all this potential and
[55:38] then you're at the bottom of a
[55:39] of a pit being sold into slavery
[55:41] rejected by your
[55:43] own family
[55:46] by your own brothers never would have
[55:48] thought your brothers would have
[55:49] rejected you
[55:51] never could have imagined it would be
[55:53] family
[55:54] sometimes family can hurt us worse than
[55:58] anybody
[56:00] and the rejection of family can hurt us
[56:01] worse than anybody
[56:03] never would have thought it would have
[56:04] been in my own house
[56:06] ray rose up or in my own by my own
[56:08] brothers
[56:09] never would have pictured never would
[56:11] have imagined but god
[56:12] looks at this whole picture and says
[56:14] yeah yeah about right there it's going
[56:16] to be slavery
[56:18] joseph it's going to be come by your own
[56:20] at the hand of your own brothers
[56:23] and and and and this is going to happen
[56:27] joseph's you know a teenage boy
[56:30] and he's there he is you imagine just
[56:32] the shock as we said that he finds
[56:34] himself
[56:34] in and now he's hauled off
[56:38] in the you know and he's hauled off to
[56:40] some
[56:41] foreign land some foreign nation
[56:44] i guarantee you he didn't expect to be
[56:46] getting hauled off
[56:48] as a slave to a foreign nation when he
[56:51] woke up that day
[56:53] never would have pictured it never would
[56:56] have imagined his life would ever get to
[56:57] this place
[56:59] but about that time then he he he goes
[57:01] and we know the story
[57:03] and then you look at the continue to
[57:04] look at the timetable and god says
[57:07] then joseph you're you're going to come
[57:09] to a place to where you're in potiphar's
[57:10] house and about right
[57:12] there you're going to get accused by
[57:15] potiphar's wife
[57:18] now god sees as brother branham says
[57:20] over and over and over and over again
[57:22] god sees the
[57:23] end from the beginning
[57:27] we don't see the end from the beginning
[57:29] we trust the word of god
[57:30] we we believe the word of god we stand
[57:32] on the promises of god
[57:34] but we see what's right in front of us
[57:38] and for joseph he didn't have a blown-up
[57:40] view
[57:41] of this timeline of his life where all
[57:44] of these events are going to take place
[57:45] all joseph is living in is the here and
[57:48] now
[57:48] he knows what's taking place to him now
[57:50] he knows how he's affected right now he
[57:52] knows how he feels right now
[57:55] he's a believer he has a dream from god
[57:58] he's got a promise from god but yet
[58:00] it's not making any sense
[58:04] are you here today about right here
[58:07] you're going to get accused
[58:09] uh by potter for his wife you're gonna
[58:11] be thrown into prison
[58:12] you'll be thrown into prison joseph if
[58:15] you look at it
[58:16] linear and you stack all the events up
[58:19] in his life from the time of the dream
[58:21] to the time
[58:22] of the throne about right there you're
[58:24] gonna you're gonna be in
[58:25] prison you're gonna be thrown into
[58:26] prison and a long
[58:29] time we got a long time's gonna go by
[58:32] you say god what's in that long time
[58:34] nothing
[58:39] nothing wait
[58:42] what are you doing right there in that
[58:44] little and that's long space because
[58:45] that could mean that could represent
[58:46] years and for joseph it did represent
[58:48] years
[58:49] nothing
[58:52] what's going to take place well it's
[58:55] going to seem like nothing to you
[58:57] but i'm doing something it's going to
[59:00] seem like nothing to you
[59:02] and sometimes in the moments when it
[59:05] feels like
[59:06] nothing to us god is doing the most in
[59:09] our life
[59:11] because he's doing not an external work
[59:14] but he's doing an
[59:14] inward work something on the inside of
[59:17] our hearts
[59:19] and joseph in that moment you're going
[59:21] to go through that space there you're
[59:22] going to be thrown into prison and
[59:24] you're going to
[59:25] be forgotten in that prison
[59:28] joseph long time goes by
[59:32] you know you imagine many times in that
[59:35] if we could
[59:36] move the we could zoom in on the
[59:37] timeline i'm sure somewhere in that
[59:39] prison joseph got down on his knees and
[59:41] began to fervently
[59:43] pray fervently
[59:47] fervently not hypocritically
[59:50] not well not with any pretense but
[59:53] joseph is praying sincerely thank you
[59:57] he's praying sincerely he's praying
[59:59] fervently god
[1:00:00] deliver me from this prison
[1:00:04] deliver me from this from this
[1:00:06] affliction
[1:00:09] can you get me out of here god i'm
[1:00:11] believing lord you're gonna you're gonna
[1:00:12] deliver me you're gonna get me out of
[1:00:14] here
[1:00:17] humanly now i'm just gonna speak humanly
[1:00:19] here it seemed like
[1:00:21] god didn't even hear
[1:00:24] he just sits and sits and sits and sits
[1:00:27] and time goes by finally an opportunity
[1:00:29] comes about right here
[1:00:30] about right here joseph now you're not
[1:00:32] going to see this
[1:00:34] you're not going to you're not going to
[1:00:35] look at this view i'm not going to give
[1:00:37] you this view
[1:00:39] i'm going to put you right in the middle
[1:00:40] of it
[1:00:42] and about right there there's going to
[1:00:44] come an opportunity for you
[1:00:46] joseph when the interpretation of dreams
[1:00:50] couple fellow inmates
[1:00:52] the butler and the baker we know the
[1:00:54] story king's cup bearer
[1:00:56] would be released from prison and he's
[1:00:59] restored after
[1:01:00] after all of the after uh it looked like
[1:01:03] an
[1:01:04] opportunity he's going to get out of
[1:01:05] jail looks like god's doing something
[1:01:07] he's finally working in his life
[1:01:10] and then that that king's cup bearer
[1:01:13] gets released from prison and gets
[1:01:16] restored
[1:01:17] back to his position and you know what
[1:01:19] joseph says to that man
[1:01:20] he says remember me that's what he tells
[1:01:23] him
[1:01:24] remember me and he pleads with him
[1:01:27] and he says when you get out when you
[1:01:29] when you're out just
[1:01:30] remember me and and make
[1:01:34] and get me out of here get me out of
[1:01:36] this prison i want to i want to get out
[1:01:38] could you imagine
[1:01:39] could you imagine the agony could you
[1:01:41] imagine the playground
[1:01:43] that the devil had on his mind could you
[1:01:46] imagine the
[1:01:47] the whispers that satan was whispering
[1:01:50] every night as he laid his head just
[1:01:52] another night in the prison cell
[1:01:54] could you imagine how much of a punching
[1:01:56] bag joseph felt like for the devil
[1:01:58] amen god's forgotten you
[1:02:02] the cupbearer tells him oh don't worry
[1:02:05] i'll
[1:02:06] don't worry joseph i got this and you
[1:02:07] know what happens he forgets
[1:02:11] amen he forgets him completely
[1:02:15] the next verse genesis 41 1 says now it
[1:02:18] happened
[1:02:18] genesis 41 1 brother josh if you want to
[1:02:21] bring that up i
[1:02:22] want to have it on the screen
[1:02:25] the next verse here in genesis 41 1.
[1:02:28] notice how it says this here i'm going
[1:02:31] to wait for you to get it
[1:02:34] this is after all of the this is after
[1:02:37] the
[1:02:38] the opportunity no doubt expectation no
[1:02:41] doubt joseph's thinking
[1:02:43] oh this is you know here's a chance
[1:02:46] here's an opportunity
[1:02:48] and it says here it says now it happened
[1:02:52] at the end of two full years
[1:02:57] that pharaoh had a dream now it happened
[1:03:01] at the end of two full
[1:03:05] notice how the bible writes that
[1:03:08] intentionally
[1:03:09] it happened after the end of two full
[1:03:13] years two long years
[1:03:18] pharaoh had a dream two years think
[1:03:21] think just for a moment go back two
[1:03:22] years in your life
[1:03:24] go back that's a long time
[1:03:31] now you know why david's praying words
[1:03:33] and says how long lord
[1:03:35] will you forget me forever
[1:03:38] how long god joseph could say how long
[1:03:42] lord forever amen it's gonna now notice
[1:03:44] i want i want to make sure you get this
[1:03:47] we know we smile we say amen because we
[1:03:50] see this picture
[1:03:52] and we have an assurance we know that he
[1:03:55] goes to prison but he gets out of prison
[1:03:58] he goes to the throne but joseph didn't
[1:04:00] know that
[1:04:02] for all joseph knew he was going to die
[1:04:05] in that prison cell
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:09] for all joseph knew that was the end of
[1:04:10] it all for all david knew
[1:04:12] i got an anointing but i mean chased
[1:04:14] down for all david knew he was going to
[1:04:16] be
[1:04:16] he was going to be killed by by saul for
[1:04:19] two long
[1:04:20] years two full years
[1:04:24] joseph languishes he's waiting in prison
[1:04:28] you know why you asked the question
[1:04:31] god could you not have given pharaoh a
[1:04:34] dream a little
[1:04:35] few nights before
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:39] why couldn't you have given him this
[1:04:40] dream two years before
[1:04:42] why the two years
[1:04:45] why the waiting why why
[1:04:48] why this why this timeline lord
[1:04:52] why do why am i going through it it's uh
[1:04:55] in all of these it just doesn't make
[1:04:57] sense lord joseph
[1:05:01] spends the better part of his twenties
[1:05:06] either a slave or in prison in
[1:05:10] egypt goes through all of his 20s of his
[1:05:14] life
[1:05:14] and that's his that's his memory goes
[1:05:18] through all of that time
[1:05:19] we we took paul even the apostle paul
[1:05:22] who the bible says i
[1:05:23] consulted the lord i taught i asked him
[1:05:25] three different times on three
[1:05:26] occasions here was the greatest uh here
[1:05:30] was the apostle paul
[1:05:31] and the bible says that he had done so
[1:05:34] much work for the lord you look at
[1:05:36] all of his life and the bible says
[1:05:40] paul goes all the way from all over
[1:05:43] europe you look at the journeys of paul
[1:05:45] in such a small amount of time
[1:05:47] such a small little window and all of
[1:05:50] the great things god did through
[1:05:52] the life of paul so much
[1:05:55] so much accomplished so little time that
[1:05:58] he did
[1:05:59] that he did it in he goes all the way to
[1:06:01] rome but how did god get
[1:06:04] paul to rome through prison
[1:06:08] through beatings they're scorchings
[1:06:14] imprisoned him on a false charge amen
[1:06:17] completely falsely accused
[1:06:20] remember paul and silas there in in
[1:06:22] prison
[1:06:24] false charge they didn't do anything
[1:06:26] wrong completely false
[1:06:28] if anybody ever had a reason to say i
[1:06:31] don't deserve this
[1:06:33] it was paul and silas but yeah what's
[1:06:35] their reaction
[1:06:36] in prison with with uh with chains on
[1:06:39] their hands
[1:06:40] the bible says they begin to sing a song
[1:06:42] unto the lord begin to worship him begin
[1:06:44] to praise him
[1:06:47] it was it was through all of that after
[1:06:50] two years even when paul's
[1:06:51] it's amazing because even when paul's
[1:06:54] falsely charged in
[1:06:55] in uh caesarea and you go read the story
[1:06:59] with felix
[1:07:00] and if you go read that verse in acts it
[1:07:02] says but after
[1:07:03] two years the bible says i thought i had
[1:07:06] it written down here
[1:07:08] in acts 24 27 it says after two years
[1:07:13] had passed felix was succeeded by festus
[1:07:17] and
[1:07:17] wishing of the jews a favor felix left
[1:07:19] paul imprisoned
[1:07:20] left him imprisoned two years
[1:07:24] david's going through the same exact
[1:07:26] thing he had been anointed
[1:07:28] as a king as we said on his linear
[1:07:30] timeline he gets his anointing but
[1:07:33] now david is anointed king by a prophet
[1:07:36] has a promise when he's a teenager but
[1:07:39] now he's running for his life in the
[1:07:42] caves
[1:07:45] he's running for his life anointed
[1:07:48] by running you know no doubt he goes
[1:07:51] through all of those teenage years and
[1:07:53] now he's in his 20s very much like
[1:07:54] joseph
[1:07:56] and david's could be is crying this out
[1:07:58] how long lord
[1:08:00] will thou forgive me forever how long
[1:08:03] will i hide thy face for me consider and
[1:08:05] hear me oh lord lest my enemy say i have
[1:08:06] prevailed against him
[1:08:08] and those that trouble me rejoice when i
[1:08:12] am moved where where's god where is he
[1:08:15] have you forgotten about me lord
[1:08:18] perhaps you maybe can relate in your own
[1:08:20] life when it feels like the lord is so
[1:08:22] distant
[1:08:23] so far seems like god is doing nothing
[1:08:26] but god is doing something
[1:08:28] i said it seems like god is doing
[1:08:30] nothing but god is doing something
[1:08:33] he doesn't slumber and he doesn't sleep
[1:08:36] he's always working he's always busy
[1:08:40] maybe not in the ways that you think he
[1:08:41] should be maybe not in the ways that you
[1:08:43] feel him or are used to filling him
[1:08:46] but god is ever busy about his promises
[1:08:49] he's ever tending to his garden which is
[1:08:51] you
[1:08:52] he's ever he's ever busy may it's maybe
[1:08:54] it seemed like a silent time for david's
[1:08:56] life but god was building character
[1:08:59] that was fit to rule on a throne god was
[1:09:01] doing something in david's heart through
[1:09:04] the silence
[1:09:05] and through the forsaken filling that he
[1:09:08] himself is experiencing
[1:09:11] and it seemed like to david seemed like
[1:09:14] his enemy was winning
[1:09:16] you know that that makes it worse when
[1:09:18] you get to a place
[1:09:19] to where you feel like the devil's
[1:09:21] winning not only am i losing
[1:09:23] not only am i not only does the lord
[1:09:25] feel distant but it looks like saul's
[1:09:27] winning
[1:09:28] looks like he was just winning imagine
[1:09:30] here's saul and it looks like he's
[1:09:32] uh to to david he's still the king he's
[1:09:35] still in the palace
[1:09:36] here i've saved his life i've spared his
[1:09:38] life and he's coming after me
[1:09:39] and here i am sleeping in caves uh
[1:09:43] saul's not out seeking the lord so it's
[1:09:45] not out fervently praying for the lord
[1:09:47] but i
[1:09:47] am god don't you know what's happening
[1:09:49] don't you know what you're doing don't
[1:09:51] you know i'm the good guy
[1:09:53] don't you know lord that what i've done
[1:09:56] lord says oh i've know i know all about
[1:09:58] it david
[1:10:00] i know all about it you're preaching to
[1:10:02] the choir
[1:10:05] because david doesn't know his life is
[1:10:07] actually a representation
[1:10:09] of the life of christ joseph doesn't
[1:10:11] know that what he's going through
[1:10:12] is just a type of what jesus is going to
[1:10:14] go through
[1:10:16] he doesn't see it all he sees is though
[1:10:18] we have the linear picture of everything
[1:10:20] he goes through but god never tells him
[1:10:22] and so his confidence you notice this
[1:10:24] even here you know we we preached this
[1:10:27] maybe i guess it was a couple years ago
[1:10:29] now and i was
[1:10:31] going back to it even reading in exodus
[1:10:33] you could go back and read the story
[1:10:35] uh you you you hear about even what we
[1:10:38] just read in david and what we read
[1:10:40] about joseph
[1:10:42] and the the bible says this the same
[1:10:43] exact thing about
[1:10:45] about uh about jehoshaphat when he goes
[1:10:47] to pray
[1:10:48] it's amazing because we know that the
[1:10:50] lord is the ruler
[1:10:51] he's the he's the king he's the he's the
[1:10:54] he's the
[1:10:55] there is no dictator uh in the economy
[1:10:57] of god he's a sovereign king he rules by
[1:11:00] love
[1:11:01] not by law not by condemnation he rules
[1:11:03] by grace
[1:11:05] his precepts are mercy and grace and
[1:11:07] love
[1:11:09] but he's lord over everything david he's
[1:11:11] lord over
[1:11:12] the good times in your life and he's
[1:11:14] lord in the bad times
[1:11:16] he's king and sovereign in the cave and
[1:11:18] he's king and sovereign on the throne
[1:11:20] glory he's king and sovereign in the
[1:11:23] times of daylight and the night
[1:11:25] he's the god of the mountain and he's
[1:11:27] the god of the valley
[1:11:30] he's the lord of all creation the bible
[1:11:33] says
[1:11:33] that he says he ruleth in psalm 66 7
[1:11:36] he ruleth by his power forever
[1:11:40] not that that's that's forever not not
[1:11:43] not just in
[1:11:44] the bible times he's still ruling right
[1:11:46] now
[1:11:47] he's still on the throne right now he's
[1:11:50] still controlling what's happening in
[1:11:52] the government and in the world right
[1:11:53] now
[1:11:56] over every nation over every kindred
[1:11:58] over every tongue over every dictator
[1:12:00] over every president
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:04] he is king the bible says in psalms 93
[1:12:09] 1 it says the lord reigns he is clothed
[1:12:12] with majesty the lord is clothed with
[1:12:14] strength
[1:12:15] thy throne is established of old thou
[1:12:17] art from everlasting
[1:12:19] verse 5 thy testimonies are very sure
[1:12:23] this was the same man who prays in
[1:12:25] psalms 13
[1:12:26] and says how long o lord will thou
[1:12:29] forget me forever o god
[1:12:32] how long will i consult in my soul
[1:12:35] and and he says how long lord this is
[1:12:37] the same one and psalms 93 thy
[1:12:39] testimonies are very sure
[1:12:42] my testimonies are sure the statutes are
[1:12:44] just i
[1:12:45] thou reigneth forever and he says lord
[1:12:48] your decrees your laws your word
[1:12:52] are irrevocable
[1:12:56] your law now the law of the land you
[1:12:58] take the law of
[1:12:59] a of a of a president well that can be
[1:13:01] changed the law of a congress that can
[1:13:03] be changed law of the senate that can be
[1:13:04] changed
[1:13:05] local law here in buford could be
[1:13:07] superseded
[1:13:08] you know by by a higher power and then
[1:13:10] they could supersede that then the
[1:13:12] supreme court could
[1:13:13] overthrow that but let me tell you
[1:13:15] something about this law
[1:13:17] nothing supersedes this
[1:13:20] this is irrevocable this is the supreme
[1:13:25] court this is the supreme
[1:13:29] court people think they vote in justices
[1:13:32] and they they
[1:13:33] and that's that's the the highest law of
[1:13:35] the land that's not the highest law of
[1:13:37] the land this is the highest law of the
[1:13:38] land
[1:13:40] this is the supreme court and there is
[1:13:43] the supreme
[1:13:44] judge and david says this he says your
[1:13:48] testimonies your laws are irrevocable
[1:13:50] they're not just irrevocable laws
[1:13:53] they're reliable i can rely upon them
[1:13:57] that's what he's saying your testimony
[1:13:59] is sure
[1:14:01] it has integrity it has foundation it
[1:14:03] has stability
[1:14:04] i don't need to question it
[1:14:08] it's solid it's irrevocable
[1:14:11] it's reliable even paul even you go read
[1:14:14] the book of hebrews says the same exact
[1:14:16] thing
[1:14:17] in hebrews chapter 13. i'm going to give
[1:14:19] you a very
[1:14:20] famous verse here hebrews 13 verse 8.
[1:14:25] anybody know that that's that verse the
[1:14:28] bible says that jesus christ is the same
[1:14:31] yesterday
[1:14:32] today and forever
[1:14:38] paul's echoing the same thing david was
[1:14:40] your laws are irrevocable they're
[1:14:42] forever they're from everlasting to
[1:14:44] everlasting
[1:14:46] your words are from everlasting uh to
[1:14:49] everlasting
[1:14:50] you even notice the the law that he put
[1:14:52] in the earth
[1:14:53] to rule the moon to rule the tides
[1:14:57] the the the the law to to to rule the
[1:15:00] movement of the sun and the earth and
[1:15:02] the moon and the stars
[1:15:04] the heavenly the heavenly bodies that we
[1:15:07] have
[1:15:08] they are sure they are forever they are
[1:15:10] eternal
[1:15:12] an eternal part of god brother brandon
[1:15:14] said the earth was in the book of life
[1:15:15] it's an eternal part of god
[1:15:18] an eternal attribute
[1:15:22] and it's forever david says that it's
[1:15:26] forever
[1:15:30] we're told all the way and you notice
[1:15:31] this all the way throughout the entire
[1:15:33] bible
[1:15:34] i want to read you so good just take a
[1:15:36] pause from that here for a moment
[1:15:38] the bible says but without even turning
[1:15:40] it says
[1:15:41] that that he's that the the scripture
[1:15:44] says that the that
[1:15:45] we have a high priest who is touched
[1:15:48] by the feelings of our infirmities do
[1:15:50] you believe that
[1:15:53] you think god wasn't touched by david's
[1:15:55] words how long will thou forgive me o
[1:15:56] lord the bible says he's a high priest
[1:15:58] who can be touched
[1:16:00] by the fillings of our infirmities
[1:16:03] it says in another place in the old
[1:16:05] testament it says he bottles up david
[1:16:07] said that he bottles up our tears
[1:16:09] he says in the in thy bottle thou has
[1:16:11] held all my tears
[1:16:12] every tear i've cried every sorrow that
[1:16:15] i've
[1:16:16] had lord you you felt
[1:16:20] you're a high priest who can be touched
[1:16:22] after the feelings of our infirmities
[1:16:24] you bottle every tear but let me
[1:16:26] let me pause from that here just for a
[1:16:28] moment because we believe that about the
[1:16:30] attribute of god
[1:16:31] he's a high priest who can be touched he
[1:16:33] bills every tear
[1:16:34] he's compassionate he's loving but let
[1:16:37] me tell you something also
[1:16:39] about the lord he's a righteous
[1:16:42] sovereign king and his word
[1:16:46] is sure and it's everlasting
[1:16:50] he's a righteous sovereign god and his
[1:16:53] word
[1:16:54] his word is his thoughts and his
[1:16:57] thoughts is his words
[1:16:59] and his words is his constitution it's
[1:17:02] his
[1:17:02] law it's his rule it's what he believes
[1:17:08] not the opinion of some man not the
[1:17:09] opinion of some group of men
[1:17:11] this is the constitution of god
[1:17:14] this is the law that he lives by this is
[1:17:17] his word
[1:17:19] the bible says where the word of a king
[1:17:21] is there is power and who can say unto
[1:17:23] him what doest thou this is speaking of
[1:17:25] the lord
[1:17:26] solomon was speaking of the lord where
[1:17:28] the word of the king is there is power
[1:17:33] when he speaks he's a sovereign he's the
[1:17:36] lord
[1:17:37] and let me say it like the prophet of
[1:17:38] god said it he his
[1:17:40] he is bound to his own word
[1:17:45] i love that i was rejoicing last night
[1:17:47] listening to the brother of adam preach
[1:17:48] that
[1:17:49] god proven his word god keeps his word
[1:17:52] and brother varian says why does god
[1:17:53] keep his word because he's bound to his
[1:17:56] own word his opinion can't be changed
[1:17:59] there's going to be no dissent to this
[1:18:00] word there's going to be no opinions or
[1:18:02] or some group of of uh
[1:18:05] you know some consensus of how we should
[1:18:07] change the word the word is unchanging
[1:18:10] and he's bound to it it's his word it's
[1:18:13] his decree
[1:18:14] and it's irrevocable and it's reliable
[1:18:18] and it's sure and it will last forever
[1:18:22] it'll last forever it's his constitution
[1:18:26] it's exactly what he believes it's what
[1:18:27] he rules by
[1:18:29] it's what he will judge the world by
[1:18:33] amen did you hear me it's what brother
[1:18:36] madam says
[1:18:36] is what he'll judge the world by oh i
[1:18:40] can hear the words of brother adam say
[1:18:41] it over and over
[1:18:42] he is god is duty bound
[1:18:45] he is duty bound to keep his own word
[1:18:49] amen his duty bound to keep his own
[1:18:54] word it has he rules by it
[1:18:57] he judges the earth by it everything
[1:19:01] that you have that you interact with
[1:19:03] consists and was created by that word
[1:19:07] brother branham says he'll judge the
[1:19:09] world by that word
[1:19:11] oh let me just say this to you my
[1:19:12] brother you can hold this book
[1:19:14] if you got your bible put it in your
[1:19:16] hand you can hold this book
[1:19:18] right now and say if there is something
[1:19:20] that is sure in this world
[1:19:22] i got something that is sure if i've got
[1:19:25] something that is irrevocable i got it
[1:19:27] right here
[1:19:28] i've got something that god is bound to
[1:19:31] he has
[1:19:32] tied to he can't reject it it's part of
[1:19:34] himself
[1:19:37] you can hold the bible in your hand and
[1:19:39] you can know who god is
[1:19:43] the bible tells us his nature his
[1:19:44] promises his judgments
[1:19:46] his laws from his own mouth and it's
[1:19:49] what he
[1:19:50] rules by it's a word
[1:19:53] that the bible says he has bound himself
[1:19:57] to do you know every judge today they
[1:19:59] swear by a law
[1:20:02] the judge is duty-bound that judge is
[1:20:04] duty-bound to the law
[1:20:06] now that law can change and then that
[1:20:09] judge
[1:20:09] is now dutily bound by that law by the
[1:20:12] change law are you here
[1:20:14] even even today they determine cases
[1:20:17] according to
[1:20:18] law that is established
[1:20:22] laws that are already established
[1:20:23] precedent you ever heard that word
[1:20:26] and then you ever heard of a binding
[1:20:28] precedent
[1:20:30] it's something that a judge will
[1:20:31] immediately go to because it's a binding
[1:20:33] precedent it's something that is
[1:20:35] that is sure some it's an absolute
[1:20:38] it's an anchor something he can rule by
[1:20:41] if he doesn't have a law he can't rule
[1:20:43] he doesn't have to rely a judge doesn't
[1:20:46] rely
[1:20:46] or does he have to rely upon his
[1:20:49] feelings
[1:20:51] are you here he doesn't have to rely
[1:20:54] upon
[1:20:54] feeling sorry for the defendant or
[1:20:56] feeling sorry for this or
[1:20:58] or what does he think he's not swayed by
[1:21:00] his emotions
[1:21:02] because he's got a law he can go back to
[1:21:04] by that binding law he's bound to
[1:21:07] to execute the law that's his own that's
[1:21:10] the word that he's bound to
[1:21:12] and then and he says his judgment his
[1:21:15] rulings are
[1:21:16] issued based upon that they are guided
[1:21:18] by a constitution
[1:21:20] and he's up he has to uphold his rulings
[1:21:23] have to be upheld
[1:21:25] and bound to that constitution
[1:21:28] well likewise god rules and judges
[1:21:30] everything by a word
[1:21:33] and he is the righteous judge and he has
[1:21:36] a constitution
[1:21:37] and he is bound to that constitution are
[1:21:40] you here today friends
[1:21:42] he's got an established law and it's not
[1:21:44] based upon his feelings it's not based
[1:21:46] upon his emotions
[1:21:48] it's not based upon anger it's not based
[1:21:50] upon love it's based upon his word
[1:21:53] and his word is sure david said it's
[1:21:55] from everlasting to everlasting
[1:21:57] it doesn't change with me or with you it
[1:22:00] doesn't change with this president or
[1:22:02] that president or this time or that time
[1:22:04] his word is sure it lasts forever
[1:22:09] it's his constitution it's his
[1:22:11] established word when he rules he
[1:22:13] rules by a living
[1:22:17] word and he is bound
[1:22:20] he said brother matt why are you why are
[1:22:22] you preaching this just hold on
[1:22:25] he is bound to that word
[1:22:28] i love to remind myself of that
[1:22:32] yes sir you ought to remind yourself of
[1:22:35] that this morning
[1:22:37] god is bound to his own word
[1:22:42] he's anchored to his own
[1:22:46] word the king
[1:22:49] the judge this king this judge
[1:22:53] you say brother matt why is that
[1:22:55] important for david
[1:22:56] why is why was that important for joseph
[1:22:59] why is that important for paul
[1:23:00] the same reason it's important for you
[1:23:02] because if god's bound by his
[1:23:04] own word then we can hold god to his
[1:23:07] own word and in the times when it
[1:23:10] doesn't make sense you know what you
[1:23:12] ought to do you ought to remind god of
[1:23:14] his own word
[1:23:15] you ought to read i said you ought to
[1:23:17] remind god of his own
[1:23:19] word in fact in isaiah he tells them
[1:23:22] that he says remind me of my own law
[1:23:25] what is it you think god suddenly needs
[1:23:27] to be reminded goes ah oh yeah oh
[1:23:29] oh gee i'm sorry i forgot
[1:23:32] no but brother adam said the bible says
[1:23:36] that god
[1:23:37] god is bound duty-bound to his own word
[1:23:41] to his own promise and this is what god
[1:23:43] says
[1:23:44] therefore come boldly
[1:23:49] into the courtroom come boldly
[1:23:54] this is your approach this is how god
[1:23:56] told you to approach his throne
[1:23:58] therefore come boldly into the unto
[1:24:02] the unto the throne of god that you may
[1:24:04] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[1:24:06] the time of need approach
[1:24:08] boldly this is how god says to make our
[1:24:11] request
[1:24:12] in philippians don't be anxious for
[1:24:14] nothing
[1:24:15] but in everything by prayer and
[1:24:16] supplication with thanksgiving let
[1:24:18] your request that's your petitions
[1:24:21] that's your needs that's your burdens
[1:24:22] that's what you need in life
[1:24:25] let your requests be known unto god
[1:24:31] without worry without fear
[1:24:34] without anxiety without stress come to
[1:24:37] the throne of god boldly
[1:24:39] because he's a king and he's a king
[1:24:41] that's bound to his own word
[1:24:44] and brother branham says you find god he
[1:24:46] says anywhere acting one way in the
[1:24:48] bible
[1:24:49] he's bound he said he's duty bound to
[1:24:51] act the same way when you approach him
[1:24:53] under the same circumstances
[1:24:55] do you believe that here today
[1:24:58] he says he's duty-bound he's duty-bound
[1:25:02] he's bound to his
[1:25:03] own word he's bound to it let us
[1:25:06] therefore
[1:25:07] come boldly to the throne of grace this
[1:25:10] is ephesians 3
[1:25:11] verse 12 brother josh he says let us
[1:25:13] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[1:25:15] grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[1:25:17] grace to help in the time of need
[1:25:21] amen what is your attitude when you
[1:25:23] approach the throne of god
[1:25:26] paul says it should be bold in all
[1:25:29] boldness
[1:25:30] in whom we have this is ephesians 3
[1:25:34] notice this that was hebrews 4 16 hebrew
[1:25:37] ephesians 3

[1:25:55] now in whom you should have boldness and
[1:25:58] access
[1:25:59] with confidence by the faith of him
[1:26:03] you approach him boldly why by the man
[1:26:05] because he's bound to his own word
[1:26:08] and when it doesn't make sense you
[1:26:10] remind him of his own word
[1:26:12] when it doesn't make sense what did
[1:26:14] jehoshaphat do when it didn't make any
[1:26:16] sense at all he reminded god of his own
[1:26:18] word
[1:26:20] go go and look at that here just for a
[1:26:22] minute just

[1:26:32] this written down the effectual fervent
[1:26:35] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:26:37] that word effectual
[1:26:38] comes from a greek word that means a
[1:26:41] fixed position
[1:26:42] meaning that it's unmovable unshakable
[1:26:45] it's an unshakable
[1:26:46] mindset the effectual fervent
[1:26:50] prayer of a righteous man availeth
[1:26:53] much it's a fervency which speaks of
[1:26:56] boldness

[1:32:05] reminding god
[1:32:06] of his word this wasn't jehoshaphat's
[1:32:09] word
[1:32:10] this was the word of the lord and he
[1:32:14] says he's reminding him lord
[1:32:16] ah are you not our god of our fathers
[1:32:18] our art not thou
[1:32:19] god in heaven and rule us thou not over
[1:32:22] all the kingdoms
[1:32:23] of the heathen and thy hand as they're
[1:32:24] not power and mind so that none is
[1:32:26] able to withstand thee jehoshaphat
[1:32:30] is reminding the lord of his precedent
[1:32:33] he's reminding the lord of his own
[1:32:36] constitution
[1:32:37] he's reminding the lord of his own words
[1:32:40] of his
[1:32:40] own law he's saying god you are bound to
[1:32:43] this
[1:32:43] this is your word not our word
[1:32:47] are you here to are you catching it
[1:32:49] friends jehoshaphat was
[1:32:51] binding god are you not our god who to
[1:32:54] drive out the inhabitants of the slam
[1:32:56] from before you
[1:32:57] your people israel and gave it to the
[1:32:59] seed of abraham your friend forever
[1:33:03] amen is that not you
[1:33:06] the lord could say yes
[1:33:10] it's me and then jehoshaphat could say
[1:33:14] lord we are your seed
[1:33:19] we are your seed you promised it to
[1:33:21] abraham thy friend forever
[1:33:24] where were abraham's seed lord
[1:33:27] this is your word this is what you said
[1:33:30] lord
[1:33:30] i'm just reading back to you what you
[1:33:32] promised lord
[1:33:34] i'm a king and i'm held by my word
[1:33:36] you're a king and you're bound by your
[1:33:38] word
[1:33:40] we are your seed lord you gave your
[1:33:43] people an eternal word
[1:33:44] and lord i'm bringing that word before
[1:33:47] you now
[1:33:49] i'm i'm presenting my case i'm not going
[1:33:51] to talk about my problems i'm not going
[1:33:53] to talk about my issues i'm not going to
[1:33:54] talk about the current circumstance
[1:33:56] because the kings are coming they're
[1:33:57] coming to wipe us out
[1:33:59] here's what i'm going to do lord it
[1:34:01] doesn't make sense right now
[1:34:03] so i'm going to do the only thing i have
[1:34:05] and that's your word
[1:34:06] and i'm going to remind you of your own
[1:34:08] word lord you promised it to abraham
[1:34:11] your seed forever
[1:34:12] and i'm your seed and these are your
[1:34:14] seed and these are your children lord
[1:34:17] this is your children god i'm bringing
[1:34:19] your word before you now
[1:34:21] you promised it you made a promise to
[1:34:23] abraham and our fathers
[1:34:25] and the same promise that you made to
[1:34:28] abraham
[1:34:28] was binding to abraham and that same
[1:34:31] promise is binding to me
[1:34:33] because why because i'm your child and
[1:34:35] if you're a part of the family of god
[1:34:37] the promises of god god is bound duty
[1:34:40] bound to those promises for you
[1:34:42] all you got to do is claim them and say
[1:34:44] i'm a son of god
[1:34:46] i'm a daughter of god and the promise
[1:34:48] that you made to my father's before me
[1:34:50] is bound to my family and my children
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:55] joseph had said lord they're binding
[1:34:57] they obey we're bound to abraham now
[1:34:59] they're
[1:35:00] bound to us
[1:35:04] you know what god says god goes further
[1:35:07] than that
[1:35:08] and the bible says that that a a a
[1:35:11] prophet comes on the scene and the bible
[1:35:14] says that he begins to
[1:35:16] begins to say stand still jehoshaphat
[1:35:20] he says stand still jehoshaphat and he
[1:35:23] says
[1:35:24] and see the salvation of the lord and he
[1:35:26] says for the battle is not
[1:35:28] yours it's the lord's
[1:35:32] the battle is not yours stands you feel
[1:35:35] it says only
[1:35:36] praise him that's all you're going to do
[1:35:38] you're going to bring the musicians
[1:35:40] and you're going to begin to praise and
[1:35:42] god's going to do the rest
[1:35:44] and the bible goes on to record that
[1:35:45] jehoshaphat goes to battle now no what i
[1:35:48] want you to catch here
[1:35:49] before we close is that god knew his
[1:35:52] word
[1:35:53] before jehoshaphat rehearsed his word to
[1:35:57] him
[1:35:59] god could have sent that prophet to
[1:36:01] steal the people
[1:36:03] and to tell them the battle's not yours
[1:36:05] it's the lord you won't fight today
[1:36:09] but he waited for jehoshaphat
[1:36:12] to read the word back to him and when
[1:36:16] jehoshaphat begin to declare the word of
[1:36:18] god
[1:36:18] god sends a prophet and the prophet
[1:36:21] comes with a word
[1:36:22] and says you won't fight he says only in
[1:36:24] this battle you won't fight for the
[1:36:25] battle is not yours it's the lord and
[1:36:27] you know what jehoshaphat does he goes
[1:36:28] the next day and they set themselves in
[1:36:30] a ray with musicians
[1:36:31] no swords no chariots
[1:36:34] no army and the bible says that
[1:36:38] jehoshaphat
[1:36:39] as they go into battle he begins to
[1:36:41] remind them now
[1:36:43] of the prophet's words
[1:36:46] he goes back he didn't notice he's not
[1:36:48] quoting now he doesn't quote to the
[1:36:50] people
[1:36:51] he doesn't quote back to god we're the
[1:36:52] seed of abraham but the bible says
[1:36:54] jehoshaphat begins to say
[1:36:56] believe in the lord your god and you
[1:36:59] shall pray and you shall be sin you
[1:37:00] shall prosper
[1:37:01] believe in his prophets and so shall you
[1:37:05] be established you may have that
[1:37:06] backwards but what's he doing
[1:37:07] he's repeating the word of god back to
[1:37:10] the people
[1:37:11] let this be your confidence that it's
[1:37:13] not your word
[1:37:14] it's not your promise it's not your ba
[1:37:17] it's not even your battle it's the
[1:37:19] lord's battle
[1:37:20] and it's not your words it's the words
[1:37:22] of god
[1:37:23] and it's the words of god's prophet what
[1:37:25] you should do today
[1:37:26] is remind god you sent a word and i'm
[1:37:29] claiming that word
[1:37:31] i'm repeating that word i'm confessing
[1:37:33] that word it's not my word it's your
[1:37:35] word lord
[1:37:37] and now god was bound to the word
[1:37:40] of the prophet praise the lord
[1:37:44] moses finds himself in the same exact
[1:37:46] place david finds himself in the you
[1:37:48] remember in exodus
[1:37:49] when it when he begins and when moses
[1:37:52] begins this conversation with the lord
[1:37:54] and he goes back and forth and back and
[1:37:56] forth
[1:37:58] and you know for moses it didn't make
[1:38:00] any sense
[1:38:03] god wasn't making any sense and you find
[1:38:05] this as he goes in this dialogue
[1:38:07] and he goes back and forth with god and
[1:38:09] back and forth with god
[1:38:11] in exodus chapter 32. if you have that
[1:38:14] brother uh
[1:38:16] matt brother josh exodus 33 verse 8
[1:38:19] verse 9 came to pass i just want to read
[1:38:21] this
[1:38:22] and it came to pass i'm fixing to close
[1:38:24] brother dick says
[1:38:25] as moses entered into the tabernacle how
[1:38:27] to build her to sin and stood at the
[1:38:28] door of the
[1:38:29] i could talk with moses and all the
[1:38:30] people saw the cloudy the pillar stand
[1:38:32] at the tabernacle door and all the
[1:38:33] people rose up in worship
[1:38:34] now notice this verse 11 and the lord
[1:38:36] spoke unto moses face to face as a man
[1:38:38] speaketh unto his friend and he turned
[1:38:40] again to the camp
[1:38:40] but his servant joshua young a young man
[1:38:43] departed not
[1:38:44] out of the tabernacle and moses said
[1:38:46] unto the lord
[1:38:47] see
[1:38:51] you know what he's doing here this is a
[1:38:54] conversation

[1:39:12] your heart
[1:39:13] well see here's the issue that's exactly
[1:39:15] what moses is doing

[1:39:22] not let me know whom thou wilt sin with
[1:39:24] me yet thou has said i know
[1:39:26] thee by name and that was also found
[1:39:28] grace in my sight
[1:39:29] verse 13. now therefore i pray thee if
[1:39:33] i have found grace in thy sight in other
[1:39:35] words if that's really true
[1:39:36] show me now thy way that i may know thee
[1:39:38] that i may find grace in thy sight
[1:39:40] and consider that this and consider that

[1:40:06] and he said my presence shall go with
[1:40:08] thee and i will give thee rest
[1:40:11] verse 15 and he said unto him if thy
[1:40:13] presence god says
[1:40:15] my presence shall go with thee and i
[1:40:17] shall give thee rest
[1:40:18] and moses says if thy presence if thou

[1:40:52] to say verse for wherein shall it be
[1:40:54] known

[1:40:56] not enough it's not enough for him he's
[1:40:58] got to just keep going and keep going
[1:41:00] and keep going
[1:41:01] you've already got the word of the lord
[1:41:02] moses he's already promised to
[1:41:04] you moses he's already told you my
[1:41:06] presence will go you've not even told me
[1:41:07] my presence will go with me good but if
[1:41:08] your presence doesn't go
[1:41:10] and then he keeps on for wherein shall
[1:41:12] that be known that here that i and that
[1:41:13] people have found grace on thy side is
[1:41:15] it not
[1:41:15] that thou go is with us so we shall we
[1:41:18] be separated i and thy people from all
[1:41:20] the people that are upon the face
[1:41:23] of the earth what's
[1:41:26] what's god starting to do god told moses
[1:41:31] he says moses i'm going to go with you
[1:41:33] i'm going to go before you
[1:41:36] and moses says that's good god i believe
[1:41:39] it
[1:41:39] you know i'm a believer that's what
[1:41:42] believers do
[1:41:44] i believe your word but i want to let
[1:41:47] you know lord just in case just in case
[1:41:49] there's any chance lord
[1:41:51] moses says just in case lord i just want
[1:41:53] to let you know don't even send me
[1:41:54] unless you lo
[1:41:55] lord i just don't even know and god says
[1:41:56] okay moses okay okay i got it now now
[1:41:59] here's my answer
[1:42:00] my presence will go with you and i shall
[1:42:02] give you rest
[1:42:04] you think that'd be enough for brother
[1:42:05] moses
[1:42:08] you know why it's not because it's not
[1:42:09] enough for you either
[1:42:12] it's not enough for me either and we got
[1:42:14] to be told time and time and time and
[1:42:16] time and time and time again
[1:42:19] it would have been enough for moses
[1:42:20] moses what are you doing well it just
[1:42:22] keeps going on lord my presence going to
[1:42:23] go with you moses lord said unto moses i
[1:42:25] will do this thing also that i was
[1:42:26] spoken of that was found grace in my
[1:42:28] sight and i would know that my name and
[1:42:29] moses just goes on and now notice what
[1:42:31] he does go back to verse 16 brother josh
[1:42:33] he begins to say for when shall it be
[1:42:35] known here that i am that people of from
[1:42:36] grace and i say
[1:42:37] is it not that thou goes with us now
[1:42:40] paul's here so shall we be separated
[1:42:44] i and thy people from all the people
[1:42:46] that are upon the face of the earth
[1:42:48] do you realize that's not moses he
[1:42:50] didn't alter that statement
[1:42:52] amen that's literally repeating
[1:42:56] god's words verbatim back
[1:42:59] to god so god says so thou
[1:43:02] shall be separated no go back to 16
[1:43:05] brother josh
[1:43:06] so thou shall be separated from all the
[1:43:08] people that are upon the face of the
[1:43:10] earth what is moses doing
[1:43:13] he's starting to repeat the word of god
[1:43:15] back to god
[1:43:17] as if god didn't already know this moses
[1:43:19] begins to repeat it he begins to speak
[1:43:21] it
[1:43:22] he begins to tell it why because he's
[1:43:24] binding god to his own word
[1:43:27] you promised this lord i didn't promise
[1:43:29] it you made this decree not me
[1:43:32] i want to make sure you know this god my
[1:43:34] confidence is not in my thinking because
[1:43:37] my thinking can change
[1:43:38] from day to day my confidence in me
[1:43:41] lord is nothing my confidence and my
[1:43:43] emotions is nothing
[1:43:45] my confidence and my ability is nothing
[1:43:47] my confidence is in this
[1:43:49] your word o god shall be established
[1:43:52] forever
[1:43:52] your word is from everlasting to
[1:43:54] everlasting and i'm going to begin to
[1:43:56] remind you
[1:43:57] of your own word because it's a promise
[1:43:59] and it's sure because it came from the
[1:44:02] king
[1:44:04] it's not my word it's your word it's not
[1:44:07] my promises it's your promises
[1:44:09] you are the bible said god the bible
[1:44:12] calls the lord
[1:44:13] the author and the finisher
[1:44:17] of our faith and let me tell you
[1:44:20] something he's not just the author and
[1:44:21] the finisher he's everything in the
[1:44:22] middle too
[1:44:25] he's everything in the m in the middle
[1:44:27] he's from the beginning to the end he's
[1:44:29] everything in the middle
[1:44:31] oh as we we've said this here before you
[1:44:33] the the difference in this race that
[1:44:35] you're running of life we're
[1:44:36] we're running a race of life you know
[1:44:39] you run a race there's a man there at
[1:44:40] the beginning of the race and he
[1:44:41] takes a pistol and he blows the trigger
[1:44:44] and he pulls the trigger and the shot
[1:44:45] goes off and everyone goes running
[1:44:47] there's something very unique about this
[1:44:49] race of life though because the same man
[1:44:51] who pulled the trigger to start the race
[1:44:53] is actually the same man at the finish
[1:44:55] line waiting to
[1:44:56] congratulate you when you cross your
[1:44:58] finish line
[1:45:00] why because he's the author and he's the
[1:45:02] finisher
[1:45:03] you know what else he is he's also the
[1:45:05] the audience
[1:45:06] uh cheering you on he's also the man
[1:45:09] there with a cup of water
[1:45:11] just say take a drink you can make it
[1:45:13] keep going keep pressing
[1:45:14] you've almost crossed the finish line
[1:45:17] he's there if i'm not breathing my first
[1:45:19] breath
[1:45:19] he's there when i breathe my last breath
[1:45:21] and he's there all in the middle
[1:45:23] even when it doesn't make sense
[1:45:28] even when it doesn't make sense
[1:45:29] musicians could you come
[1:45:31] even when it doesn't make sense
[1:45:36] you remind him of his own word
[1:45:40] you promised lord you're bound to a
[1:45:43] promised god
[1:45:45] bless the lord amen you said these
[1:45:48] people are your seed
[1:45:50] and that your seed would last and endure
[1:45:54] forever you started it lord
[1:45:59] it's not making much sense right now you
[1:46:02] know there's times in your life when it
[1:46:04] does
[1:46:06] there's times in your life when you you
[1:46:08] have a feeling at least
[1:46:12] stand to your feet times in your life
[1:46:15] you
[1:46:15] have a feeling of maybe a sense of
[1:46:19] security that's all i got it figured out
[1:46:21] you know i got it got planned for my
[1:46:23] life and
[1:46:24] looks like it's all going to go you know
[1:46:26] but if we'd be honest here today there
[1:46:28] are times when
[1:46:29] we can feel like that one day one year
[1:46:32] one
[1:46:33] set of years and then suddenly we enter
[1:46:35] into a place in our life where it's just
[1:46:38] what happened it just doesn't make sense
[1:46:40] lord
[1:46:41] it's not making any sense what's you
[1:46:42] could feel that way even now
[1:46:44] so lord it's not making sense what's
[1:46:46] happening in the world today
[1:46:48] what's happening how long is this going
[1:46:50] to last
[1:46:51] what's what's taking place right now
[1:46:53] lord you can feel like you got it all
[1:46:55] figured out
[1:46:58] then there's other times you say lord
[1:46:59] this doesn't just don't feel like it
[1:47:02] makes any sense to me it's
[1:47:03] david says pray david prayed you know
[1:47:06] how long lord will you forget me forever
[1:47:09] is it just going to be that way is it
[1:47:11] going to be like this forever
[1:47:12] how long will it and sometimes as we
[1:47:14] said at the beginning it can drag out
[1:47:16] like joseph
[1:47:17] drags out for years like paul and felix
[1:47:20] goes for years two years in prison
[1:47:22] how long will it go lord but let me just
[1:47:25] remind you here this morning

[1:48:13] 32
[1:48:14] i say moses let me just tell you
[1:48:16] something buddy
[1:48:18] right before i read that entire
[1:48:19] perplexing conversation that you just
[1:48:21] had with the lord
[1:48:22] i read that god spoke to you face to
[1:48:25] face as a man speaks to another man to
[1:48:26] his friend
[1:48:30] and i want to let you know moses um
[1:48:33] i've never experienced that
[1:48:36] i've never had a chance to sit down with
[1:48:38] god i've talked to him felt him in my
[1:48:39] soul
[1:48:40] i've never sat down and got had to have
[1:48:41] a conversation
[1:48:43] if moses is i want you to catch this if
[1:48:46] moses could sit
[1:48:47] face to face and talk to god as a man
[1:48:49] talks with his friend and still
[1:48:51] question not the word but the man the
[1:48:54] vessel
[1:48:56] the promise if he could do that with the
[1:48:59] face-to-face
[1:49:00] conversation how much more us here
[1:49:03] today could we get to a place in our own
[1:49:06] hearts where we're going i just don't
[1:49:07] know
[1:49:07] lord it just doesn't make sense lord and
[1:49:10] you could say moses
[1:49:12] my goodness moses how much is it going
[1:49:14] to take how much
[1:49:15] more is god going to have to do to get
[1:49:18] your attention to give you confidence
[1:49:20] that it's him
[1:49:21] how much more is he going to have to say
[1:49:22] god if you don't go for me moses my
[1:49:24] presence go with that's good god but if
[1:49:26] you don't go don't even send us because
[1:49:27] how will our people know my presence
[1:49:29] will go you found grace
[1:49:30] if i found grace in your sight you found
[1:49:32] grace in my sight moses
[1:49:34] you know you just look at it and go my
[1:49:36] goodness you know god
[1:49:37] you know could have just looked at him
[1:49:39] and said you know what just
[1:49:40] forget it moses my goodness
[1:49:44] how many times do i gotta tell you how
[1:49:46] sure do i gotta you know what you know
[1:49:47] what moses you know what
[1:49:49] never mind harry i'm face to face i've
[1:49:52] already given my word two or three times
[1:49:53] and you're still
[1:49:54] questioning the word i am so glad that
[1:49:57] god didn't do that to moses
[1:50:00] i'm so glad he didn't push him aside i'm
[1:50:02] so glad he doesn't cast him aside
[1:50:04] but he just keeps talking to him and he
[1:50:06] keeps commuting with him and he keeps
[1:50:08] telling him god can say to me
[1:50:10] how long is it going to take you how how
[1:50:12] many times uh how many times the devil
[1:50:14] could say
[1:50:15] how many times how much is it going to
[1:50:16] take for you to believe the word of god
[1:50:19] how when will you ever believe god says
[1:50:20] i'm not going to quit i'm going to keep
[1:50:22] preaching it to you i'm going to keep
[1:50:24] telling it to you
[1:50:25] i'm going to keep expressing it to you
[1:50:27] and you may walk out of here today and
[1:50:29] doubt it tomorrow
[1:50:30] will you give up on me then god no i'll
[1:50:32] just keep talking moses
[1:50:34] i'll keep preaching moses i'm going to
[1:50:35] keep standing moses
[1:50:37] until when until you believe moses i'm
[1:50:40] going to
[1:50:41] keep on pouring it on you moses
[1:50:48] because it's not always going to make
[1:50:49] sense buy your heads with
[1:50:52] me here this morning not always going to
[1:50:55] make sense
[1:50:56] it doesn't always make sense
[1:51:01] when it didn't make sense to moses he
[1:51:02] reminded god
[1:51:04] of his word when it didn't make sense to
[1:51:07] jehoshaphat he begins to remind god
[1:51:11] of his own word this is your people
[1:51:14] this is your seed you said your seed
[1:51:16] would last forever and we are your seed
[1:51:18] i wonder if you could do that today
[1:51:20] maybe by an uplifted hand
[1:51:22] say lord this is your word this is not
[1:51:25] my word
[1:51:27] this is your promise this was not my
[1:51:29] promise i'm only here because you put me

[1:51:35] finish it
