[6:09] [Music]
[6:10] Worthy is the lamb.
[6:16] Worthy is the lamb.
[6:19] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord some
[6:21] praise. Amen. Brother Luther,
[6:24] [Applause]
[6:27] [Music]
[6:29] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Uh, Brother Jackson in
[6:31] a request. He's still battling a head
[6:34] cold. He didn't want to spread any
[6:35] germs.
[6:38] You know, I I had somebody text me. He
[6:40] said,
[6:42] "They murdered him,
[6:44] Charlie Kirk." And I was like, "Who's
[6:46] Charlie Kirk?" Shows you how much I paid
[6:49] attention. But once I saw his face, I
[6:51] realized who he was,
[6:54] you know. And um you know, you think
[6:56] about come up here and pray. And
[6:59] thing is, we don't battle flesh and
[7:01] blood, principalities and powers, dark
[7:05] places.
[7:06] And if you're any kind of a student of
[7:09] the message of the hour, you know, it's
[7:11] not going to be any kind of political
[7:13] thing. You know, like our brother said,
[7:18] watch Romanism.
[7:19] and the World Council churches and all
[7:22] that will con congregate together
[7:26] and like he said they'll chase down the
[7:28] foolish virgin like dogs.
[7:30] So we how this affected us is just um oh
[7:35] it just hits you in the heart it just
[7:38] but once that Holy Spirit leaves with
[7:40] the bride
[7:42] that's going to be nothing.
[7:44] Amen. So we just want to remember the
[7:47] family also remember brother Jack this
[7:51] morning
[7:52] but you know he is still on the throne.
[7:56] That's who we look to today. Let's pray.
[7:59] Father I love you this morning.
[8:02] And Lord we see the dark times around
[8:04] us. Father
[8:06] help us Lord to look above those dark
[8:09] clouds.
[8:10] You are still seated on the throne. Help
[8:14] us to be more bold,
[8:17] more fervent for you, for your kingdom.
[8:20] Fill us with thy holy spirit again and
[8:22] again, Father.
[8:25] Bless the ministry as he would come,
[8:27] Lord, and
[8:29] break the bread of life.
[8:32] Bless these people here, Father,
[8:34] visitors, and
[8:36] all your children.
[8:38] Strengthen them, Father. Help us all to
[8:41] look to you, the author and finisher of
[8:42] our faith today.
[8:45] Thank you for your grace to us. Father,
[8:47] I pray that you bless the tithes and
[8:48] offerings. Lord,
[8:51] bless the cheerful giver, those that
[8:53] would stream, those that aren't able to,
[8:55] Father, assemble together,
[8:59] as a group of believers in the name of
[9:01] Jesus Christ. May across the airwaves as
[9:04] they gather in your name that you would
[9:06] be with them, strengthen them, Father.
[9:09] We see the day we're in, Lord. We're not
[9:12] deceived.
[9:14] As the bride matures, so does the the
[9:17] other side.
[9:18] Bless your people, we pray in Jesus
[9:20] name. Amen.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; The church says, "Amen." Let's give the
[9:26] Lord another hand. Amen.

[26:27] ever do that. Amen. Amen. Praise the

[26:31] into the scripture this morning. Um want
[26:35] to start in the Gospel of Luke, chapter
[26:38] 10. Amen. Praise the Lord. Luke chapter
[26:42] 10. I I've got just a couple of
[26:45] announcements. one I'm um one I decided
[26:49] to um wait and just um um send out. Just
[26:55] be looking for it. Um at the end,
[26:57] Brother Kenny, don't let me forget,
[26:59] we're going to call you up and get a
[27:00] prayer cloth prayed for your mom. Um and
[27:04] then um another note, just be on the
[27:07] lookout for it. Uh it's a one of those
[27:09] common things you remember here a week
[27:11] or two ago we had to just remind you
[27:14] about you know electronic device usage
[27:16] you know we we have teams that use to
[27:19] communicate from up here to back there
[27:21] different things going on and sometimes
[27:22] people use their electronics for taking
[27:25] notes I get it just be careful remember
[27:28] there's an allseeing eye uh knows what
[27:30] you're really doing. Amen. And then um
[27:33] and those are just um items of
[27:35] maintenance. you you you make those
[27:37] kinds of statements every so often.
[27:39] Every so often, we have to remind
[27:40] people, you really should get to church
[27:41] early.
[27:43] Now, that one wasn't on my mind, so that
[27:45] one's free. Um, but we've had a little
[27:48] bit of um we've had to do this over the
[27:50] years. Every time we have a baby wave, I
[27:53] don't know, something gets in the water
[27:54] and we have a baby wave. Uh, we have to
[27:56] remind um people to say, "Look, the
[28:00] nursery is for mothers with nursing.
[28:03] Babies are very small children. It's not
[28:05] a playroom,
[28:07] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. Amen. And um it's not a
[28:10] place for grandma,
[28:12] &gt;&gt; you know, and so it's a place for
[28:13] mothers. And here's the here's the real
[28:16] takeaway. Here's the real takeaway.
[28:18] Church order is in no way diminished in
[28:22] the nursery at all. The same way you
[28:25] would never carry on a conversation and
[28:27] here that is not relaxed in the nursery.
[28:31] Amen. So just a reminder of that. And uh
[28:35] and I get grandma's help. I I get that.
[28:37] But that's not a place for grandmothers
[28:39] to pile up back there. That's for
[28:41] nursing mothers. It's not even for older
[28:43] children who just want to go in there
[28:44] and play. You know, by the time they get
[28:46] up to that age, they are more taught
[28:48] that to sit still in church and behave
[28:51] themselves. And that's something we
[28:53] learn at home. I'm going to send a note
[28:55] just to remind you just so when you see
[28:57] it, you'll know what's up with that.
[28:59] Amen. God bless you. I don't want to
[29:00] take more more time than that on that
[29:02] this morning. We have a wonderful
[29:03] atmosphere. Um, Amen. Praise the Lord.
[29:07] Wonderful atmosphere. Amen. Amen.
[29:13] Amen. So, let's look in our scripture in
[29:16] Luke chapter 10. I sure appreciate the
[29:19] wonderful atmosphere that you sit, the
[29:21] singing and the worship. I was enjoying
[29:23] Brother Jason's class this morning.
[29:25] Amen. Luke chapter 10.
[29:29] And I'll read this and then we have some
[29:30] more to read. will let you be seated.
[29:32] Luke chapter 10. We're going to start at
[29:34] verse 21 and we're going to catch 21
[29:36] through 24.
[29:39] And um I don't know. I may have sent
[29:41] something different to the to the booth.
[29:44] I'm not even sure if I sent a opening
[29:46] text. Ah, okay. I'm in the clear. I said
[29:50] TBD. Okay. Well, there it is. That's the
[29:52] text. Amen. Luke 10:21-24.
[29:57] In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[30:01] and said,"I thank thee, oh Father, Lord
[30:04] of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid
[30:07] these things from the wise and prudent,
[30:10] and has revealed them unto babes. Even
[30:13] so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[30:17] sight." And all verse 22, all things are
[30:21] delivered to me of my father. And no man
[30:24] knoweth who the son is but the father
[30:27] and who the father is but the son. And
[30:31] he to whom the son will reveal him.
[30:35] And he turned him unto his disciples and
[30:38] said privately, blessed are the eyes
[30:41] which see the things that ye see. For I
[30:44] tell you that many prophets and kings
[30:47] have desired to see those things which
[30:50] ye see and have not seen them, and to
[30:53] hear those things which ye hear and have
[30:56] not heard them. Amen. Let's bow our
[31:00] heads.
[31:03] Master, I stand before you today
[31:05] completely dependent upon you. And Lord,
[31:08] this is um a thought that I want to take
[31:11] my time on, Lord, but yet I want to um
[31:14] get through to a certain point. So, I'm
[31:16] just I'm just trusting in you. I know
[31:19] nothing more to do than just to give it
[31:21] into your complete control. I'll go as I
[31:24] feel led and say what I feel led to say,
[31:27] Lord, and we'll skip along and pass by
[31:30] what we don't feel a direct anointing
[31:33] for. I know that everything you reveal
[31:34] to me and I put in my notes is not
[31:36] necessarily everything I have to say to
[31:38] the people. Sometimes it's not
[31:39] necessary. Lord, we're going to say
[31:42] everything that you want said. So, I
[31:44] just commit myself to that end to you
[31:47] and to your wonderful hands in Jesus
[31:49] name. Amen. God bless you friends. You
[31:51] can be seated.
[32:16] Now, um, Gideon, we're going to go to,
[32:18] uh, Matthew chapter, uh, 11
[32:22] and just get that ready. I'll give you
[32:24] the verses just in a moment. Um um so go
[32:29] ahead and put up Matthew 11:25. Let's do
[32:32] that. And then we'll go from 25
[32:34] through30. But before I start reading in
[32:37] Matthew, you're reading the exact same
[32:40] event. And you can see right there in
[32:42] the 25th verse, at that time Jesus
[32:45] answered and said, "I thank thee, oh
[32:47] father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[32:48] because thou has hid these things from
[32:50] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[32:52] them unto babes." Right? Hold right
[32:53] there, G. So today I want to speak on a
[32:57] sermon I'm going to title um uh let me
[33:02] see get it exactly how I sent it to the
[33:03] booth. Redemption God's great drama.
[33:07] Redemption. God's great drama. So one of
[33:12] the couple of things that I want you to
[33:14] notice before we move on into our text
[33:16] here in Matthew 11 is where we read in
[33:19] Luke 10. You're finding out a number of
[33:22] things that that Jesus is thanking the
[33:26] father that he hides things and only
[33:28] reveals them in as he chooses. He
[33:33] actually says that the father thinks
[33:35] that's a good idea. So, so it's uh you
[33:39] know when we begin to say look you the
[33:42] spirit of God has to reveal the word to
[33:44] you or you'll never get it. And a lot of
[33:46] times people don't want to believe it
[33:48] like that. They want to believe that I
[33:50] can study it or I can go to Bible school
[33:52] or I can memorize verses and I can know
[33:55] it as good as anybody. Well, I'm not
[33:57] saying you can't acquire the data, but
[34:00] I'm here to say and you're going to
[34:01] acquire data today, but nonetheless, God
[34:04] thinks it's a good idea to withhold
[34:07] understanding from who he chooses to and
[34:09] to reveal it to whom he chooses to. And
[34:12] that's not my idea or William Brandham's
[34:14] idea. That's what Jesus says. The father
[34:17] says that's a good idea. I'm going to
[34:19] make it. I'm going to set up the mystery
[34:21] of myself that the only way anyone can
[34:25] discover me is if I reveal myself to
[34:27] them. Therefore, it's grace.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; It's grace. It's mercy. It's not him
[34:32] that willth or him that runth. It's not
[34:34] that you built hospitals or schools.
[34:36] It's that God showed mercy.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; See? And so, so, you know, we find that
[34:42] you say, "Well, how many will believe on
[34:45] him?" Because St. John 3 tells us that
[34:48] whosoever believes and that's certainly
[34:50] a true statement. It doesn't St. John uh
[34:54] 3:16 doesn't say who will believe. In
[34:58] fact is it doesn't even say anyone will.
[35:01] It just says whoever does that they'll
[35:03] re that that's the path to eternal life.
[35:05] You're going to have to believe the word
[35:06] of God. We you have to go over into the
[35:09] book of Acts where it says as many as
[35:11] were ordained believed. SO GOD HAS ALL
[35:15] OF THIS UNDER his complete control. He's
[35:18] never rolling dice.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; You see, and it's not a lottery at pick
[35:25] and it's not lucky. You're not fortunate
[35:27] because you're a believer. It's because
[35:29] God knew you before the foundation of
[35:31] the world and put your name in his book
[35:33] and HAS DETERMINED YOU'RE HIS CHILD, NOT
[35:35] YOU. HE DETERMINED IT. when he comes to
[35:38] Abraham, brother Brandham says he didn't
[35:40] he didn't come to Abraham to say, you
[35:42] know, Abraham, this is what I I want to
[35:44] do and this is what I'm going to do. He
[35:47] he came to Abraham to say, I'M JUST HERE
[35:49] TO NOTIFY YOU WHAT I'VE ALREADY DONE.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to be the father OF MANY
[35:54] NATIONS. THAT'S IT. DONE. FINISHED. FULL
[35:56] STOP. AND NOTHING YOU DO OR DON'T DO IS
[35:59] EVER GOING TO MAKE THAT GO OR NOT GO. IT
[36:02] IS MY PLAN. It's for MY GLORY. IT'S MY
[36:05] FAMILY. IT'S MY HEAVEN. IT'S MY WORLD.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; SEE? SO, SO NO WONDER Jesus would turn
[36:13] to HIS DISCIPLES AND SAY, "BLESSED ARE
[36:16] YOUR EYES.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; You see in your ears and you hear." And
[36:21] and I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY GREAT
[36:23] PROPHETS AND MANY GREAT KINGS DESIRED TO
[36:25] SEE the day THAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW. AND
[36:28] IT WASN'T GRANTED TO THEM. SEE, and that
[36:31] was in the days when Jesus WALKED THE
[36:33] EARTH. SO CAN I SAY THIS TO YOU today to
[36:36] remind by way of rem stirring you up by
[36:38] way of remembrance. DON'T DON'T DON'T BE
[36:42] CASUAL THAT GOD CHOSE YOU. DON'T JUST BE
[36:45] HO HUM. WE SHOULD REJOICE. LET
[36:48] EVERYTHING THAT HATH BREATH PRAISE THE
[36:50] LORD.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY GRATEFUL AND
[36:53] SAYING LORD HOW CAN I DO MY PART IN THE
[36:55] PLAN THAT YOU CHOSE ME AND YOU DIDN'T
[36:57] HAVE TO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OPEN MY EYES.
[37:00] YOU COULD HAVE EASILY PASSED ME BY. THE
[37:03] WORLD I WAS LIVING IN WAS WRETCHED,
[37:04] POOR, AND BLIND. BUT THEN I HEARD
[37:07] RECOGNIZING YOUR DAY. SERPENT SEED AND
[37:10] PERFECT FAITH, THE BREACH AND THE
[37:12] MESSAGE OF GRACE.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; AND LORD, FROM MY WHOLE HEART AND MY
[37:16] WHOLE LIFE, I THANK THEE.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHAT LUKE brings out. LUKE
[37:24] WANTS PEOPLE TO HAVE A DOCTOR. HE WANTS
[37:28] THEM TO HAVE A, you know, uh, in their
[37:31] spirit, IN THEIR HUMAN SPIRIT, A
[37:33] THANKFULNESS AND A GRATITUDE. DON'T
[37:35] EVER, THIS IS WHY THE WORLD NAUSEATES
[37:39] GOD with lukewarmness.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you mean after all that
[37:43] he's done and he he gave his WORD AND HE
[37:46] SENT JESUS AND SENT GIFTS INTO THE
[37:48] CHURCH AND HIS SPIRIT WAS DIVIDED AND
[37:50] AND PEOPLE STILL DON'T BELIEVE OR THEY
[37:53] OR THEY JUST HAVE A A CASUAL
[37:55] CHRISTIANITY
[37:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[37:58] &gt;&gt; WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THEY JUST
[37:59] ADMIRE THE FINE QUALITIES of Jesus
[38:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A FAR CRY from what the church
[38:04] had
[38:06] &gt;&gt; they had the living power they had the
[38:09] very literal life that was in Jesus
[38:11] living in them. HE GOES ON NOW, NOW ONE
[38:13] OF NOW MATTHEW'S GOING TO PICK up a
[38:15] different angle because Luke is a
[38:17] doctor. Matthew's a TAX COLLECTOR. ALL
[38:19] RIGHT, WATCH. And he go, we've read it.
[38:22] Verse 25 26. Even so, Father. Matthew
[38:24] 11:26. For so it SEEMED GOOD IN THY
[38:27] SIGHT. All things are delivered unto me
[38:30] of my father. And no man knoweth the
[38:33] Son, but the Father, neither knoweth ANY
[38:36] MAN THE FATHER, SAVE THE SON, and to he
[38:40] whom THE SON WILL REVEAL HIM. SO,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; SO I I'M SAYING TO YOU,
[38:46] &gt;&gt; THIS IS JESUS SAYING TO HIS DISCIPLES, I
[38:49] AND THE FATHER ARE ONE.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; YOU IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. IT
[38:53] WAS WITH GOD AND WAS GOD. AND NOW THAT
[38:56] WORD HAS BEEN MADE FLESH. AND YOU CAN'T
[38:58] SAY I KNOW JESUS WITHOUT SAYING I KNOW
[39:01] THE FATHER. AND YOU CAN'T SAY I KNOW THE
[39:03] FATHER WITHOUT SAYING I KNOW HIS SON.
[39:05] YOU CAN'T SAY I KNOW THE WORD EXCEPT
[39:07] THAT THE THAT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST HAS
[39:10] REVEALED HIMSELF TO YOU.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; This is him in another form.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] So, so then the so then the new birth by
[39:22] THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GHOST REVEALING
[39:27] HIMSELF to you is the new birth.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; IT IS A PERSONAL REVELATION OF THE
[39:34] SPIRIT OF HIMSELF TO YOU
[39:37] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. AND YOU SAY,
[39:40] "WELL, WHAT'S THE X'S AND O'S? HOW DID
[39:41] WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? WHAT DID THAT
[39:43] WORK OUT?" THERE WAS A GENE OF GOD DOWN
[39:45] INSIDE YOU AND THE LIGHT WHICH CHRIST
[39:48] WAS THE LIGHT. IN HIM WAS LIFE AND THAT
[39:51] LIFE WAS THE LIGHT OF MEN. RIGHT? AMEN.
[39:53] AND THAT LIGHT FLASHED ACROSS THE SEED
[39:55] AND LIFE THAT WAS ALREADY IN THE SEED
[39:58] CAME TO LIFE
[40:00] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE BORN AGAIN. AND IF THAT HAS
[40:02] NOT HAPPENED, IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE
[40:04] EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST REVEALING
[40:07] HIMSELF TO YOU PERSONALLY, THEN YOU I'M
[40:09] NOT SAYING YOU HAVEN'T HAD EXPERIENCES
[40:11] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THERE'S A
[40:13] DIFFERENCE. WHEN YOU HAVE PASSED FROM
[40:15] DEATH UNTO LIFE, YOU ARE A NEW CREATION
[40:18] IN CHRIST JESUS.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE FAR BEYOND. YOU'RE ORDERS OF
[40:23] MAGNITUDE FURTHER HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN
[40:26] THAN JUST MERE SALVATION FROM
[40:29] DESTRUCTION. YOU'VE BEEN REDEEMED.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; AND SO MATTHEW GOES ON, "COME UNTO ME
[40:38] ALL ye that labor and are heavy laden,
[40:41] and I will give YOU REST. TAKE MY YOKE
[40:43] UPON YOU AND LEARN OF me for I am meek
[40:45] and lowly in heart and ye shall find
[40:47] rest to your souls for my yoke is easy
[40:50] and my burden is light. SEE FRIENDS SO
[40:53] MATTHEW IS POINTING OUT AND connecting
[40:56] you know LUKE CONNECTED TO THE FACT THAT
[40:58] ABOUT YOUR STATE OF MIND REGARDING THE
[41:01] WORD. YOU SHOULD REJOICE AND BE GLAD FOR
[41:03] MANY DESIRED IT. BUT YOU GET IT. BUT
[41:06] MATTHEW TAKES ANOTHER THING, SAYS,
[41:08] "LISTEN, IF YOU, BY THE WAY, IF YOU WANT
[41:10] PEACE, REAL PEACE, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
[41:13] TO COME THIS PATH. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A
[41:16] REST IN YOUR SOUL,
[41:19] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THE ONLY WAY
[41:21] YOU'RE GOING TO GET REST IN YOUR SOUL IS
[41:23] TO FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT TO REVEAL HIMSELF
[41:26] TO YOU." AND THEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT
[41:28] MAKES THE YOKE EASY AND THE BURDEN
[41:31] LIGHT.
[41:32] THIS IS EXACTLY WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
[41:38] BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD live a
[41:43] CHRISTIAN LIFE, BUT THEY DON'T LIVE ALL
[41:46] THE WORD
[41:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S TOO HEAVY.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S TOO DIFFICULT. AND SO THEY CHOOSE
[41:54] EASY BELIEISM AND EASY STREET. I REALLY
[41:57] DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING. I CAN
[41:59] STILL BE THE SAME TATTED UP HEATHEN THAT
[42:01] I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; I CAN STILL BE THE SAME UNGODLY PERSON.
[42:06] I DON'T NEED TO CHANGE MY DRINKING
[42:08] HABITS, CURSING HABITS, CHURCH HABITS,
[42:10] DRESS HABITS, UH APPEARANCE HABITS. ALL
[42:13] I HAVE TO DO IS BELIEVE IN A HISTORICAL
[42:16] MAN.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; SEE, BECAUSE TO DO ALL THAT STUFF, TO TO
[42:20] BE A REAL CHRISTIAN, A REAL ONE, AND
[42:22] LIVE LIKE A REAL ONE, LET ME SAY IT THAT
[42:24] WAY. TO LIVE LIKE A real Christian
[42:26] WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST IS HEAVY and hard
[42:30] to do cuz you're a weirdo. YOU'RE AN
[42:32] ODDBALL. YOU'RE AN OUTCAST. YOU DON'T
[42:35] FIT IN AND YOU HARM YOURSELF. YOU OPEN
[42:38] YOURSELF UP TO PERSECUTION. NOT ONLY
[42:40] THAT, THAT YOUR YOUR DOG ON FLESH, YOUR
[42:43] STINKING FLESH IS A CONSTANT BATTLE FOR
[42:46] YOU AND YOU'RE ALL THE TIME FIGHTING IT.
[42:49] SO JESUS SAYS, "DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE MY
[42:52] YOKE IS EASY. MY BURDEN IS LIGHT. HOW DO
[42:55] I GET THAT? BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU YOU BECOME BORN AGAIN OF THE
[43:01] SPIRIT OF GOD.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:14] SO IN REVELATION CHAPTER 1, GIDEON,
[43:19] let's go there.
[43:22] REVELATION CHAPTER 1.
[43:26] Now catch it. VERSE ONE. THE REVELATION
[43:29] OF JESUS Christ which God gave to him to
[43:34] do what? Keep it to himself. NO, TO SHOW
[43:36] IT TO HIS SERVANTS, things which must
[43:38] SHORTLY COME TO PASS. And moreover, HE
[43:42] SENT AND SIGNIFIED IT BY HIS ANGEL UNTO
[43:44] HIS SERVANT JOHN, WHO BEAR RECORD OF THE
[43:46] WORD. SO THIS THING IS SO SECURED AND
[43:48] DOUBLE SECURED AND triple secured. WHO
[43:50] BEAR RECORD OF THE WORD OF GOD AND OF
[43:52] THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST AND OF ALL
[43:54] THINGS THAT HE SAW. SO IF YOU BELIEVE
[43:57] JOHN WAS a real Christian, you can
[43:58] believe the book of Revelation
[44:00] &gt;&gt; because he's writing what he saw and
[44:01] heard.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Blessed is he that readeth and they that
[44:04] hear THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY AND KEEP
[44:06] THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN FOR THE
[44:09] TIME IS AT HAND. NOW LET ME SAY IT LIKE
[44:11] THIS. SO THE THE BOOK OF revelation
[44:16] arriving uh you know to the early church
[44:20] very late in its in ITS DEVELOPMENT BY
[44:24] THE TIME THE JOHN COMES BACK. HE'S AN
[44:26] OLD MAN. HE'S THE LAST LIVING APOSTLE.
[44:28] THEY'VE ALL BEEN KILLED. HE'S THE LAST
[44:29] ONE ALIVE. PAUL'S LONG AGO GONE. THEY'VE
[44:33] ALL JAMES WAS PUT TO THE SWORD. PETER
[44:36] HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED. THOMAS WAS, YOU
[44:38] KNOW, lanced in IN INDIA FROM BEHIND AS
[44:41] HE WAS PRAYING. THEY and and you can go
[44:43] read the history. Some of them were
[44:45] flayed alive. I THINK BARTHOLOMEW AND
[44:47] DIFFERENT ONES. JOHN IS THE LAST ONE. HE
[44:49] COMES BACK FROM PATMAS WITH THIS BOOK.
[44:52] AND SO WHEN WE WHEN WE REALIZE THAT THE
[44:54] BOOK OF revelation that arrived to the
[44:57] church very late in its in the
[44:59] development of the church and that when
[45:01] it arrived IT ARRIVED SEALED FROM
[45:05] UNDERSTANDING.
[45:06] SO IT ARRIVED LATE. THE MESSENGER IS
[45:09] ALREADY GONE.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; PAUL CAN'T EVEN PREACH FROM IT.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU GET ME?
[45:15] &gt;&gt; SO IT ARRIVES LATE. PAUL'S ALREADY GONE.
[45:18] THERE'S NO ONE TO UNLOCK IT. IT'S SEALED
[45:20] UP FROM UNDERSTANDING SO THAT IT
[45:22] SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US. IT SHOULD NOT BE
[45:26] SURPRISING OR DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THAT
[45:29] THE BOOK OF REVELATION IS A BOOK FOR THE
[45:32] END TIME BRIDE TO RECEIVE.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; See uh and and and AND UNDER PER AND
[45:40] WITH PERFECT CLARITY SEE OF THE SPIRIT
[45:43] OF GOD. AND NOT ONLY NOT ONLY TO RECEIVE
[45:47] IT IN THE END TIME WITH PERFECT CLARITY
[45:51] CUZ NO AGE HAD REMEMBER IT CAME LATE.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ALREADY SEALED.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; PAUL'S GONE. SO AND THE AND THE AGES
[45:59] ONLY WENT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE TRUTH.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; SO IT BECAME WHAT ONCE ONCE THE BOOK
[46:05] ARRIVED THERE WAS ALREADY LESS THAN NO
[46:08] CHANCE FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND IT.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT CONTAINED THINGS OF PROPHECY
[46:14] THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEY WERE
[46:16] GOING TO BE FACING.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; THOSE THOSE CHURCH AGES MEANT REALLY
[46:21] THEY COULD READ WHAT PETER WHAT JOHN
[46:23] WROTE MEANT NOTHING TO THEM. THEY READ
[46:25] ABOUT YOU KNOW I SAW AND I WAS IN THE
[46:27] THRONE ROOM AND ONE SAT ON THE THRONE
[46:28] AND THERE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIVING
[46:30] CREATURES AND THERE'S SEVEN STARS IN HIS
[46:32] RIGHT HAND AND YOU KNOW AND AND IF YOU
[46:34] WOULD HAVE BEEN STANDING THERE GO LISTEN
[46:35] HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. CHURCH IS
[46:36] GOING TO FALL AWAY. There's going to be
[46:37] seven ages of seven messengers. you're
[46:39] going to restore it back under, you
[46:40] know, as a caterpillar. What? What?
[46:42] What? Huh?
[46:44] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about?
[46:46] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT AT
[46:48] ALL BECAUSE IT DIDN'T APPLY TO THEM.
[46:49] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID JESUS DIDN'T EVEN
[46:51] LET THEM KNOW.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS SO MUCH THEY THEY THEY THEY
[46:56] DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT it would mean
[46:58] that the seven seals would be open at
[47:00] THE END TIME. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY IT
[47:02] WAS SEVEN SEALED.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHOLE SEALING
[47:06] ABOUT? AND SO YOU KNOW WHY WHY IS THAT
[47:08] ONE STANDING THERE AND JOHN SAID I WAS
[47:10] CRYING AND THE THEOPHONY SAID TO ME
[47:11] DON'T WEEP THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF
[47:13] JUDAH. I'M NOT SAYING THEY COULDN'T
[47:15] UNDERSTAND AND SEE LITTLE PORTRAITS OF
[47:16] CHRIST BUT THAT BOOK WAS HELD TO THE END
[47:19] TIME FOR THE BRIDE OF CHRIST TO RECEIVE
[47:22] THE UNSEALING OF THE BOOK AND IN SEE
[47:25] UNSEALING IT SHE CAN KNOW WHO BY
[47:28] REVELATION THAT CHRIST IS. AND WHEN YOU
[47:30] KNOW THAT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND WHO YOU
[47:31] ARE AND THEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE DRAMA.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU LOOK BACK UNDER THAT WHITE
[47:37] HORSE RIDER AND ALL THE EARLY CHURCH AND
[47:39] THE MARTYRDOM AND THE red horse and the
[47:40] black horse and Luther AND ALL AND THE
[47:42] MAN age and the eagle age and YOU GO,
[47:43] "WOW."
[47:45] &gt;&gt; IT MAKES SENSE TO ME. IT'S A DRAMA. IT
[47:48] WAS A DRAMA ALL ALONG IS BEING PLAYED
[47:50] OUT LIKE A PLAYWRIGHT WROTE IT.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT THAT IN YOUR MIND SO YOU CAN
[47:56] FOLLOW ME MORE EASILY.
[47:58] SO WE WE CAN SEE THEN THAT THE BRIDE OF
[48:00] THE END time
[48:02] would literally
[48:04] BE BIRTHED BY THE OPENING OF THESE
[48:07] mysteries contained IN THIS SEALED UP
[48:10] BOOK. AND SHE WOULD ACTUALLY WITH THAT
[48:14] OPENING RECEIVE HER MARCHING ORDERS FOR
[48:17] HER DAY CUZ SHE'S GOT MARCHING ORDERS.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; There's other marching ORDERS THAT WERE
[48:21] HISTORICAL THAT APPLIED TO THE TO THE
[48:24] OTHER CHURCHES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
[48:26] ANY BEARING ON. HERE'S THE ONLY BEARING
[48:28] THAT THOSE PAST AGES HAVE ON YOU.
[48:31] EVERYTHING THAT SATAN WAS IN THE
[48:33] DECEPTION OF THE WHITE HORSE, EVERYTHING
[48:35] HE WAS IN THE TYRANNY OF THE RED HORSE,
[48:38] EVERYTHING HE WAS IN THE DARK AGE BLACK
[48:40] HORSE IS ALL BOUND UP TOGETHER. AND
[48:42] YOU'RE FACING IT IN THE DAYS OF THE PALE
[48:44] HORSE.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THANK GOD, EVERYTHING THAT THE
[48:47] CHURCH WAS UNDER THE LION AND UNDER THE
[48:49] OX AND UNDER THE MAN AND UNDER THE
[48:51] FLYING EAGLE, WE HAVE THE DEVIL'S
[48:54] ANSWER.
[48:56] AMEN.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE COME DOWN AND THE WHOLE THING
[48:59] HAS BEEN A DRAMA PLAYING OUT ACROSS 20
[49:01] CENTURIES.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOTHING BY ACCIDENT.
[49:06] HOW COULD YOU LOOK AT THAT AND SEE HOW
[49:08] IT OVERLAYS WITH HISTORY? AND WHEN
[49:09] BROTHER BRANDHAM took the book of
[49:10] Revelation and laid it over with history
[49:12] and you could see it all PLAY OUT, THEN
[49:14] HOW WOULD YOU THINK THIS HAS NOT BEEN AN
[49:16] EXACT SCIENCE?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; THIS HAS NOT BEEN FUZZY MATH. THIS HAS
[49:19] BEEN AN EXACT SCIENCE. AND I'M HERE TO
[49:22] TELL YOU TODAY, GOD HAS EXACTLY HIS
[49:24] BRIDE. HE HAS EXACTLY HIS WORD. HE HAS
[49:27] EXACTLY THE HOLY GHOST. YOU'RE GOING TO
[49:29] EXACTLY BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[49:31] YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY GOING TO BRING THE
[49:33] DEAD OUT OF THE GRAVE. YOU'RE EXACTLY
[49:35] GOING TO BE CAUGHT UP IN A RAPTURE.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; THIS HASN'T BEEN LEFT TO GUESSWORK OR
[49:39] SOMEBODY FLIPPING A SWITCH. THIS IS GOD
[49:42] DOING IT.
[49:44] AND AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY PAUL
[49:47] LOOKED BACK ON THE OLD, YOU KNOW, ON THE
[49:49] SAINTS BEFORE AND SAID, "THEY WITHOUT US
[49:50] COULDN'T BE MADE PERFECT." WELL, HEY
[49:52] PAUL, YOU WITHOUT US CAN NEVER BE MADE
[49:56] PERFECT.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT THE
[50:03] FIVE STARS LINING UP AND THE APPROACH OF
[50:05] THE SEALS. HE SAID, "WHAT IS IT
[50:06] ANNOUNCING? AN INFANT BRIDE?
[50:09] &gt;&gt; It's announcing her approach."
[50:13] SO, SHE'S BIRTHED BY THE END TIME WORD
[50:15] BEING BEING brought to light. She's
[50:18] receiving her marching orders.
[50:21] Her day
[50:22] would be the last day. What's called the
[50:26] last day. In fact, is not merely the end
[50:28] time, but the end of the end time. The
[50:31] final parts
[50:33] to be played out in God's great drama of
[50:37] redemption.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; To redeem a gentile bride.
[50:42] matching Joseph having Azeneath.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[50:47] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Dale AND I WERE JUST
[50:49] DISCUSSING THIS THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW,
[50:51] YOU you you LOOK REMEMBER AS I'VE SHOWED
[50:54] YOU that
[50:56] those four living creatures around the
[50:59] throne. Right.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; The the the lion, the ox, the man, the
[51:06] eagle.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; And they were around the throne. They
[51:08] were they were spirits OF GOD. AND SO
[51:10] THEY WERE ANOINTINGS FOR EACH AGE, FOR
[51:13] HISTORICAL AGES, and and each and it AND
[51:16] IT KEPT COMBINING AND THE NEXT AGE AND
[51:17] THE NEXT AGE TILL FINALLY WE'VE GOT ALL
[51:19] OF THAT. SO WE FIND OUT THAT WHEN the
[51:23] bride goes up in a rapture, and this is
[51:26] rudimentary to you. I've taught it to
[51:27] you for years. When the bride goes up,
[51:30] that eagle ANOINTING DOES NOT FLY BACK
[51:32] TO THE THRONE. IT FLIES EAST. IT PICKS
[51:35] UP MOSES AND ELIJAH AND GOES TO THE
[51:38] 144,000 WHICH IS TYPED IN THE BIBLE AS
[51:41] BENJAMIN. SO IT'S 12,000 OUT OF EACH
[51:43] TRIBE, RIGHT? AND SO YOU SO AND BROTHER
[51:46] BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT HOW THIS BENJAMIN
[51:49] WHO WAS BORN IN JOSEPH'S ABSENCE. NOW,
[51:51] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS IS NOT CONTRADICTING
[51:53] THE SCRIPTURE. WE KNOW THAT BENJAMIN WAS
[51:55] A LITTLE BOY WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN INTO
[51:58] CAPTIVITY. THAT THAT'S NOT A CONFLICT
[52:00] BECAUSE THAT MATCHES THE THE NEW
[52:02] TESTAMENT GOSPELS PERFECTLY BECAUSE
[52:04] THOSE TRUE BROTHER BRAM SAID THOSE TRUE
[52:07] JEWS IN THE DAYS OF JESUS WOULD HAVE
[52:09] BELIEVED HIM BUT THEY WERE BLINDED. NOW
[52:11] WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PHARISEES.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PHARISEES AND
[52:15] SADDUCEES AND AND AND AND THAT WE'RE
[52:17] TALKING ABOUT TRUE JEWS. YOU SEE THEM
[52:20] LATER UNDER THE FIFTH SEAL. THEY GET
[52:22] ACCUMULATED UNDER THE UNDER THE NEW
[52:24] TESTAMENT ERA UNDER THE ERA OF OF
[52:25] CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS THREE AND A HALF
[52:27] YEARS OF JESUS MINISTRY AND THEN SEVEN
[52:29] CHURCH AGES OF THE ERA OF THE HOLY GHOST
[52:31] UNDER 2,000 YEARS AND THE FIFTH SEAL
[52:34] THERE IS PILED UP UNDER THE THRONE AND
[52:37] AND AND AND WE SEE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE
[52:40] TRUE JEWS WHO DID NOT HAVE THE TESTIMONY
[52:43] OF JESUS.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THE TESTIMONY THAT THEY HELD
[52:46] WHICH WAS THE LAW OF MOSES BUT THEY'RE
[52:48] GOD'S TRUE FAMILY. THEY'RE DESTINED TO
[52:50] BE IN THE MILLENNIUM BECAUSE HE'S GOING
[52:53] TO SET UP JERUSALEM AND ISRAEL IS GOING
[52:54] TO BE THE LEADING NATION OF THE WORLD
[52:56] AND FROM THERE THE KING AND THE QUEEN
[52:58] WILL REIGN AND THROUGH A THOUSAND YEARS
[53:00] OF MILLENNIUM HIS JUSTICE AND HIS LAWS
[53:02] WILL BE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD AS
[53:04] NATIONS RISE. YOU FOLLOW ME?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; SO, SO YOU REALIZE THEN THAT IT IT SO SO
[53:09] SO IT'S NOT THAT BENJAMIN WASN'T
[53:12] ACTUALLY BORN. IT'S THAT BY THE TIME BY
[53:15] THE TIME JOSEPH GOES INTO CAPTIVITY,
[53:17] THEY'VE HAD NO RELATIONSHIP. JUST LIKE
[53:19] JESUS, HE WAS ALIVE. THEY WERE ALIVE,
[53:20] BUT THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP CUZ THEY
[53:22] WERE BLINDED. THE TYPE FITS PERFECTLY.
[53:24] BUT NOW, AFTER 2,000 YEARS, SOMETHING IN
[53:27] THE LOINS OF JOSEPH, SOMETHING DEEP
[53:30] WITHIN HIM WAS BURNING. I WANT TO KNOW
[53:32] BENJAMIN. I WANT TO KNOW THOSE 144,000,
[53:36] 12,000 OUT OF EACH TRIBE BECAUSE I'VE
[53:38] GOT A WHOLE PLACE UNDER THE ALTAR, UNDER
[53:41] THE FIFTH SEAL WHERE THEY'RE HELD THERE.
[53:43] AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE JUST LIKE THE
[53:45] BRIDE'S PERFECTION TO RAISE THE DEAD FOR
[53:47] HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF GENTILES. IT'S
[53:49] GOING TO TAKE THE BENJAMIN PERFECTION TO
[53:52] BELIEVE THE MESSAGE AND RECEIVE THE HOLY
[53:54] GHOST. AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO EMPTY
[53:56] OUT THE SOULS UNDER THE ALTAR AND
[53:58] THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO EARTH WITH
[54:00] US IN A MILLENNIUM.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YES.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT UP. THAT FITS SO
[54:07] PERFECTLY IN THE SCRIPTURE.
[54:13] SO,
[54:15] SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT IN THIS WAY, WE
[54:18] SEE
[54:20] FOR THESE BLESSED IS HE THAT readeth
[54:23] verse three of uh Revelation 1. AND THEY
[54:27] THAT HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY AND
[54:29] KEEP THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN.
[54:32] NOW, I've already proved to you this is
[54:34] you for the time is at hand. So, the
[54:39] real meat of this book of Revelation is
[54:42] to be lived out when the time is at
[54:45] hand.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; NOW, I GET IT. 2,000 YEARS IS ONLY TWO
[54:49] DAYS WITH GOD. I understand all of that.
[54:51] But let's let's BE FOR REAL. I MEAN, I
[54:54] I'M NOT 2,000 YEARS AWAY FROM THE FROM
[54:57] THE MILLENNIUM. I'M NOT 2,000 YEARS AWAY
[55:00] FROM A RAPTURE. I DON'T BELIEVE I MIGHT
[55:02] NOT BE TWO YEARS. WE MIGHT NOT BE TWO
[55:04] MONTHS OR TWO WEEKS. OUR HOMECOMING IS
[55:06] SOON. AND THIS IS THE TIME. THE TIME IS
[55:09] AT HAND. AND WHEN THE TIME IS AT HAND,
[55:12] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE'S SUPPOSED
[55:13] TO BE A PEOPLE WHO HEAR THE PROPHECY AND
[55:16] KEEP THOSE THINGS
[55:19] &gt;&gt; WHICH ARE WRITTEN.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE
[55:25] TIME TO BE GETTING SLACK.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE TIME
[55:30] TO be carnal.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; This is the exact opposite OF THAT TIME.
[55:34] WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IS IS THE
[55:36] CUTTING EDGE ON FIRE. DO YOU HONESTLY
[55:39] THINK that when they're at the last
[55:43] STAGE OF THE TRIBULATION PERIOD, MOSES
[55:47] AND ELIJAH ARE GOING TO HAVE TO, YOU
[55:49] KNOW, FUMBLE AROUND WITH THOSE JEWS
[55:53] BEING CARNAL?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[55:57] CONSTANTLY TELL THE WOMEN HOW THEY
[55:58] SHOULD DRESS AND HOW THE MEN SHOULD DO
[56:00] AND ACT AND HOW TEENAGE YEAH, I DON'T
[56:02] THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO ANY OF
[56:03] THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A ZEAL.
[56:05] THEY'RE GOING TO BE READY. WE'LL ALREADY
[56:07] BE AT A MARRIAGE SUPPER. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[56:09] WELL, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, FRIENDS,
[56:10] THAT MARRIAGE SUPPER IS RIGHT UPON US.
[56:13] AND THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE CONSTANTLY
[56:15] LIVING ON THE EDGE OF CARNALITY. YOUR
[56:17] REDEMPTION DRAWETH NIGH.
[56:21] [Music]
[56:25] &gt;&gt; SO, IT BE THE LAST DAY. AND SO, THE
[56:26] FINAL PARTS OF THAT BOOK ARE TO BE
[56:29] PLAYED OUT IN GOD'S GREAT DRAMA OF
[56:32] REDEMPTION.
[56:35] You know, you can you can see
[56:38] and I AND I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY THE THE
[56:41] THE MILLIONS THAT WILL NO DOUBT FILL THE
[56:45] MILLENNIAL WORLD.
[56:47] Uh even heathens raised UP TO HEAR THE
[56:49] GOSPEL. IT WON'T TAKE LONG TO POPULATE.
[56:52] Go back to the days of Noah. It was just
[56:54] a couple of generations. They were
[56:55] already forming nations.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; This nation's 250 whatever years old.
[57:00] And look, I mean, we look back on George
[57:03] Washington, man, that was ages ago. To
[57:05] us, it was. IMAGINE IF YOU WERE IF THAT
[57:07] WAS RIGHT NOW, WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE A
[57:10] QUARTER OF THE WAY
[57:11] &gt;&gt; through the millennium. SO, YOU
[57:13] UNDERSTAND? TRY TO GET YOUR MIND AROUND
[57:15] THOUSAND YEARS IS A LONG TIME. AND SO,
[57:18] AND THEN, OF COURSE, AFTER THAT, WE KNOW
[57:20] THAT THAT UH THE JUDGMENT WILL COME AND
[57:23] and the dead, both small AND GREAT, WILL
[57:26] STAND. THE SEA WILL GIVE UP ITS DEAD.
[57:27] THE GRAVES, ALL THE GRAVES WILL THERE
[57:30] THERE'LL BE A SECOND GENERAL
[57:31] RESURRECTION.
[57:33] AND WE KNOW THAT THAT the new heavens
[57:35] and the new earth WILL BE FILLED WITH
[57:38] MANY MILLIONS, NO DOUBT, WHO NEVER WERE
[57:41] ELECTED BRIDE. THEY NEVER COULD SEE THE
[57:44] MESSAGE. BROTHER BROWN TALKS ABOUT THE
[57:45] FOOLISH virgin who go through THE
[57:48] TRIBULATION FOR THEIR SIN OF REJECTING
[57:51] THE MESSAGE CUZ SEE THE MESSAGE WOULD
[57:53] HAVE GAVE THEM THE NEW BIRTH. YEAH.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; SO, THEY HAD A AN OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY
[57:58] SPIRIT ON THEIR FLESH AND ON THEIR on on
[58:00] THEIR FLESH AND THEIR SPIRIT. AND THE
[58:02] PROOF OF that is THAT THEY LIVED
[58:05] SANCTIFIED LIVES.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE TRUTH, BUT
[58:10] THEY WERE RIGHTEOUS LIVING PEOPLE. THE
[58:12] BOOK OF REVELATION CALLS THEM SAINTS.
[58:14] MATTHEW 25 CALLS THEM RIGHTEOUS, YOU
[58:17] KNOW. AND AND I AND AND AND I HEARD
[58:19] BROTHER JD THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT
[58:21] THE SAD DEATH OF CHARLIE KIRK. LISTEN
[58:23] FRIENDS, THAT IF THAT DOESN'T DO
[58:25] ANYTHING FOR YOU, IT SHOULD SHOW YOU IT
[58:27] THAT IT'S A PRECURSOR TO THE RIGHTEOUS
[58:30] REMNANT OF THE WOMAN'S SEED IN THE
[58:32] TRIBULATION WHO WILL BE HUNTED DOWN LIKE
[58:34] DOGS AND KILLED.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT, MAN, HOW'S THAT
[58:38] WITH OUR CONSTITUTION IN THE CIVILIZED
[58:41] WORLD? HOW ARE THEY GOING TO HUNT DOWN
[58:43] GOD'S THE REMNANT OF THE WOMAN'S SEED,
[58:45] THOSE UNWISE VIRGINS? HOW ARE THEY GOING
[58:47] TO BE HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED? I THINK WE
[58:49] MIGHT HAVE SAW AN EXAMPLE, A PRECURSOR
[58:50] OF IT. YEAH.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[58:54] &gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW, UM, WHEN THAT HAPPENED,
[58:56] BROTHER JASON PUT IN OUR BETHL MINISTRY
[58:59] TEAM CHAT. UM, he said, "WITHIN MINUTES,
[59:02] I SAW THE FOOTAGE ON X AND KNEW HE WAS
[59:04] DEAD. I BROKE OUT INTO TEARS.
[59:06] IMMEDIATELY WE WATCHED HUNDREDS OF HIS
[59:08] VIDEOS AS A FAMILY. BETWEEN THIS AND
[59:10] WHAT HAPPENED TO THE UKRAINIAN girl on
[59:12] the train IN CHARLOTTE, THE STAGE IS
[59:14] BEING SET FOR A FULL UNITING OF
[59:16] CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS TO JOIN
[59:18] TOGETHER TO FIGHT COMMUNISM. EVEN ELON
[59:20] MUSK IS CALLING FOR RELIGIOUS REVIVAL.
[59:22] THE STAGE IS BEING SET FOR A MAJOR
[59:24] CRACKDOWN BY THE RIGHT. When when I read
[59:28] that, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S QUOTE POPPED
[59:30] INTO MY MIND FROM THE BOOK FROM HIS
[59:32] SERIES ON Hebrews 1957. Now remember
[59:36] THIS IS 57 THE FIRST THIS IS YEAR ONE OF
[59:40] AMERICA IN JUDGMENT.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD FOR ALL OF THOSE YOU KNOW for
[59:45] for HUNDREDS OF YEARS SHE HAD BEEN A
[59:47] NATION BLESSED BY GOD. BUT NOW 1956 WAS
[59:51] HER LAST OPPORTUNITY AND SHE REJECTED IT
[59:54] AND NOW SHE'S UNDER JUDGMENT AND THAT
[59:56] WAS THE LAST NATION.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; ALL THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY REJECTED IT
[1:00:00] AND AND HAD ALREADY BEEN PUT UNDER
[1:00:02] JUDGMENT AND NOW AMERICA NOW THE WHOLE
[1:00:04] WORLD.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER A PROPHET COULD COME AND SAY I
[1:00:06] INDICT THIS GENERATION.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GENERATION THAT
[1:00:10] lived 2,000 YEARS AGO. I'M INDICTING
[1:00:12] THIS GENERATION for the second
[1:00:14] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:18] because they crucified his word.
[1:00:21] THIS IS 1957,
[1:00:23] FIRST JUDGMENT, year one.
[1:00:26] GREAT PERILOUS TIMES ARE AT hand
[1:00:30] and more trouble laying in the road.
[1:00:33] Boy,
[1:00:35] wouldn't we love to go back to the
[1:00:36] perilous times of 1957?
[1:00:40] Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Goodness,
[1:00:43] GREAT PERILOUS TIMES ARE AT HAND. OKAY,
[1:00:46] BROTHER BRANDHAM, I get it. Boy, if you
[1:00:48] see our day, AND MORE TROUBLE IS LAYING
[1:00:52] IN THE ROAD. AND HOW?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And we know, AND YOU WEREN'T WRONG,
[1:00:58] BROTHER BRANDHAM. You weren't wrong.
[1:01:00] We're witnesses. You weren't wrong. AND
[1:01:02] WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE BETTER
[1:01:05] TIMES.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT WE'RE AT THE END. AMEN.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; FROM 1957, YEAR ONE OF JUDGMENT, TIMES
[1:01:14] WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND WORSE
[1:01:18] UNTIL JESUS comes according to the
[1:01:21] scripture. And I wrote a response when
[1:01:23] brother Jason wrote that in. I said, I
[1:01:25] have surmised for some time now from
[1:01:28] various scriptures and things. Brother
[1:01:30] Brandham said that the that the that
[1:01:33] Brother Brandham said that the RADICAL
[1:01:35] LEFT WOULD DRIVE THE PROTESTANTS AND
[1:01:37] CATHOLIC CHURCH together uh to crush THE
[1:01:40] LEFT WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY WEAPONIZE
[1:01:44] THE BEAST TO CRUSH ALL OTHER DISSCENT
[1:01:47] GOING FORWARD. WE KNOW THE WORLD IS ON A
[1:01:50] ONE-WAY ROAD TO ARMAGEDDON AND MUST get
[1:01:54] worse and worse. SEE BECAUSE THE BINDING
[1:01:58] OF THE TEARS, THEY DON'T NEVER UNBIND.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY GO TO THE BURNING
[1:02:04] BOUND.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; SO ONCE THE ONCE THIS UNION OF THE BEAST
[1:02:10] AND THE CHURCH FORMS, IT WILL NEVER
[1:02:13] UNWIND UNTIL HUMANITY SELF-DESTRUCTS
[1:02:18] GLOBALLY.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; You still got me? Yeah,
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; I'm watching my time and I want to I'm
[1:02:27] trying to pace myself. I want to get so
[1:02:29] far
[1:02:31] and I don't want to hurry too much.
[1:02:37] BROTHER BRANDON MAKES A REFERENCE to
[1:02:41] you know many Bible stories and we could
[1:02:43] spend the whole rest of the services
[1:02:44] going over them in depth. Brother would
[1:02:46] take one and preach a whole sermon on
[1:02:47] it. you know, uh, when he talks about,
[1:02:50] uh, having conferences and he talks
[1:02:51] about the Eden conference and what are
[1:02:53] we going to do about sin and, uh, the
[1:02:55] family of God has fallen AND BROTHER
[1:02:57] BRANDHAM DESCRIBES THAT AS A AS A DRAMA.
[1:03:00] And I mean, it's it's it's riveting. I
[1:03:04] mean, you want to talk about MAKE FOR
[1:03:05] GOOD READING, GO LISTEN TO THE TAPE.
[1:03:06] IT'S IT'S IT'S SPINE TINGLING, BROTHER
[1:03:09] BRANDON. AND I CAN'T EVEN DUPLICATE THE
[1:03:11] WAY HE SAYS IT. UH, WE MIGHT HAVE PLAYED
[1:03:13] A SOUND BITE HERE. I SOMEWHERE I
[1:03:16] RECENTLY PLAYED A SOUNDBITE. GOD KNEW
[1:03:19] THAT THAT SHOCKING STATE WHEN GOD KNEW
[1:03:22] THAT THAT SHOCKING STATE OF EMERGENCY.
[1:03:25] HE SAYS IN ANOTHER PLACE WHEN WORD
[1:03:27] REACHED GOD THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD
[1:03:29] FALLEN.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE DIDN'T SEND AN ANGEL DOWN. HE
[1:03:33] SAID HE STEPPED OUT AND WENT DOWN
[1:03:35] HIMSELF. AND HE SAYS, "GOD, WHEN GOD
[1:03:37] KNEW THAT THAT SHOCKING STATE OF
[1:03:39] EMERGENCY, I SUPPOSE THE FIRST EVER CAME
[1:03:41] TO HEAVEN, WAS WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS
[1:03:44] children was lost, he came frantically
[1:03:47] up and down the garden. ADAM, MY SON,
[1:03:51] ADAM, WHERE ART THOU?" THAT HE SAYS,
[1:03:54] "THE THE FATHER, THERE STOOD ADAM AND
[1:03:57] EVE, THEIR FIG LEAVES SEWED TOGETHER
[1:03:59] BEHIND A BUSH, AND THE FATHER GOING BACK
[1:04:01] AND FORTH SCREAMING, WHERE ARE YOU?
[1:04:03] WHERE ARE YOU?"
[1:04:05] AND I AND I AND I THINK THE LAST TIME I
[1:04:07] BELIEVE IT WAS HERE WHERE I WAS SHOWING
[1:04:09] YOU THE INFLECTION WHERE HE SAYS, "WHERE
[1:04:11] ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU?"
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; AND YOU GO LISTEN TO THE TAPE, THAT'S
[1:04:15] HOW HE SAYS IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ADAM, I
[1:04:17] DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. I'M GOD, BUT
[1:04:18] YOU'RE HIDING AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
[1:04:20] ARE. IT'S NEVER going to BE THAT. IT'S
[1:04:22] GOD WHO HIDES THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
[1:04:24] HE IS. BUT IT'S NE THERE'S NOTHING YOU
[1:04:26] WILL EVER DO. DAVID SAID, "IF I MAKE MY
[1:04:28] BED IN HELL, HE SEES ME. IF I TAKE THE
[1:04:31] WINGS AND SOAR INTO THE WILDERNESS, NO
[1:04:33] MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, THOU ART WITH ME.
[1:04:35] I'M SO GLAD FOR THAT. AND SO HE SAYS, HE
[1:04:38] WHERE ARE YOU? IT'S NOT WHERE ARE YOU? I
[1:04:40] CAN'T FIND YOU. IT'S WHERE ARE YOU,
[1:04:42] ADAM? HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS FALLEN
[1:04:44] STATE? HOW DID YOU LET THAT HAPPEN?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME MESSAGE TO THE
[1:04:50] BRIDE TODAY. HOW ARE YOU FIND YOURSELF
[1:04:52] CARNAL?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PRAYER LIFE? WHAT
[1:04:55] HAPPENED TO YOUR CHURCH ATTENDANCE? WHAT
[1:04:57] HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY? COME ON. WE'RE
[1:04:59] AT THE END TIME. THIS ISN'T A TIME TO BE
[1:05:01] WALKING AROUND IN THE WILDERNESS. THIS A
[1:05:03] TIME FOR GOING HOME.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU, ADAM?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A DRAMA. HE TALKS ABOUT THE DRAMA
[1:05:11] AT KADES. HE SAYS, "A GREAT DRAMA OF THE
[1:05:14] BIBLE." THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
[1:05:16] THERE. HE COMES TO THE JUNCTION OF TIME,
[1:05:19] THE COMING DRAMA. NOW, WATCH THIS.
[1:05:20] HERE'S A COMING DRAMA IN THE FUTURE.
[1:05:23] We're going into the millennium. That's
[1:05:25] right. TIME WILL CEASE AT THIS JUNCTION
[1:05:28] AND ETERNITY will begin FOR US AND NEVER
[1:05:31] NO MORE. AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH
[1:05:34] ALL OF THESE THINGS when all the world's
[1:05:37] history is climaxing
[1:05:39] in this great drama and he's talking
[1:05:41] about going into the millennium.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; You're talking about a drama for the
[1:05:45] ages. a climaxing final scene. The last
[1:05:49] scenes OF FALLEN MAN, HIS 6,000-YEAR RUN
[1:05:55] IN A FALLEN condition coming to an end.
[1:05:58] And Armageddon is on the scene. And
[1:06:00] Christ has come out with his bride. And
[1:06:02] Moses and Elijah have been killed and
[1:06:04] resurrected. The 144,000 KILLED AND
[1:06:07] RESURRECTED. AND NOW HE COMES BACK AND
[1:06:09] THE WORLD GOES DOWN INTO NUCLEAR
[1:06:11] ANNIHILATION. AND THE BRIDE STEPS OUT ON
[1:06:13] THE ASHES OF THE WICKED TO REBUILD the
[1:06:15] earth AND START IT AGAIN. YOU TALKING
[1:06:17] ABOUT A DRAMA. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A
[1:06:19] FINAL SCENE IN THE CLOSING SCRIPT.
[1:06:22] THAT'S THE PART I WANT TO BE AT.
[1:06:24] HALLELUJAH. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT
[1:06:25] ONE THAT GOES DOWN IN NUCLEAR FIRE. I
[1:06:27] WANT TO BE THAT ONE THAT IS RIDING RIGHT
[1:06:29] BESIDE OF CHRIST. AND YOU SAY, "WELL,
[1:06:32] HOW DO I KNOW HIM?" THE BIBLE SAYS HIS
[1:06:34] NAME WAS THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A MYSTERY TO US WHO HE IS. IT'S
[1:06:41] A MYSTERY TO THE WORLD.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S BEEN REVEALED to us.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S NOT JUST TO FILL US WITH
[1:06:49] SUPERNOWLEDGE.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S TO MAKE A SUPER CHURCH. IN OTHER
[1:06:53] WORDS, IT'S TO BE A MANIFESTATION. YOUR
[1:06:55] KNOWLEDGE IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSED TO ACT
[1:06:58] ITSELF OUT.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE JESUS ACTED OUT THE LIFE OF
[1:07:02] GOD, YOU'RE TO ACT OUT THE LIFE OF
[1:07:04] CHRIST.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; So then WE COME TO OUR HERE. I'M JUST
[1:07:08] GIVING YOU EXAMPLES OF DRAMA. HERE'S
[1:07:10] PRESENT DAY DRAMA THAT'S UNFOLDING RIGHT
[1:07:13] NOW. HE GOES ON IN THE JUNCTION OF TIME.
[1:07:15] WHAT'S THE MATTER?
[1:07:18] What makes people so nervous?
[1:07:21] WHY IS IT EVEN PSYCHIATRISTS ARE COMING
[1:07:23] TO BE PRAYED FOR? WHY IS IT THE WORLD IS
[1:07:27] IN A NERVOUS AGE,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; A NEUROTIC AGE? AND THAT'S THE end the
[1:07:32] the beginning of 56, the last year of
[1:07:34] mercy,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; THE LAST YEAR OF GRACE. AND
[1:07:38] PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ARE ALREADY COMING FOR
[1:07:40] PRAYER.
[1:07:42] THE LAST YEAR OF GOD'S GRACE AND IT'S
[1:07:45] ALREADY A NERVOUS age and a neurotic
[1:07:47] age.
[1:07:49] HE SAYS, "WHAT'S THE MATTER? THERE'S a
[1:07:52] great drama being set."
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the lion
[1:07:58] hungered nations are RAVISHING IN. BUT
[1:08:02] JUST BEFORE HE GETS ABLE TO TAKE IT, God
[1:08:05] will take his church.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS, THAT'S
[1:08:09] THE DRAMA THAT'S SETTING IN UPON US
[1:08:11] RIGHT NOW.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IN THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS 1963
[1:08:17] HE GOES AND REFERENCES MATTHEW 16 and
[1:08:20] you know who do men say that I the son
[1:08:22] of man am? You've read it and well some
[1:08:24] say Elias or Jeremiah one of the
[1:08:27] prophets but who do you say that I am?
[1:08:29] And Simon said those notable
[1:08:31] unforgettable words thou art the Christ
[1:08:33] the son of the living God. And there's
[1:08:35] where you remember Jesus says blessed
[1:08:37] art thou Simon and I've shown you it
[1:08:39] from the Greek that is a word mccarius
[1:08:41] which doesn't it means anything but
[1:08:43] fortunate a lot of times it I remember
[1:08:45] spirit zodiatis the the eminent Greek
[1:08:48] scholar and and my first bible was
[1:08:51] edited by him uh key greek key Greek
[1:08:55] Hebrew key study Bible and he says it's
[1:08:57] it's it's sad that sometimes that word
[1:09:00] blessed art thou Simon gets translated
[1:09:02] as fortune he says not fortunate at all.
[1:09:04] It has nothing to do with being lucky.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; What he's saying to Peter McCarius, he's
[1:09:09] saying, Peter, there is something in you
[1:09:12] possess the characteristic of deity. And
[1:09:15] that's how you know who I am cuz we have
[1:09:18] a mutual father and we're of the same
[1:09:20] bloodline. And you know who I am and I
[1:09:22] know who I say thou art Peter AND UPON
[1:09:25] THIS I'LL BUILD MY WHOLE CHURCH UPON THE
[1:09:27] REVELATION OF WHO I AM THAT GOD HAS
[1:09:29] GIVEN US.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS, YOU REALIZE
[1:09:33] THAT YOU ARE GOD'S VALIDATION IN THIS
[1:09:35] DAY OF HIS REVELATION.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; BLESSED ART THOU SON OF JONAS. SEE, THOU
[1:09:45] ALONE, PETER SAYS, THOU ALONE HAS THE
[1:09:47] WORDS OF LIFE. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE. SEE?
[1:09:50] And so, SO, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM GOES ON.
[1:09:53] I'M JUST SKIPPING DOWN. THEN, YOU KNOW,
[1:09:55] HE go when when many leave him, says,
[1:09:57] "Will you go also?" And there comes
[1:09:59] Peter again. Lord, where will we go?
[1:10:00] Thou hast the words of eternal life. AND
[1:10:03] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, YOU KNOW, HE
[1:10:04] PICKING UP HERE, THOU ALONE HAS THE
[1:10:06] WORDS OF LIFE. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE. NOT
[1:10:08] ONLY DID HE HAVE THE WORDS OF LIFE, HE
[1:10:10] WAS the word of life.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; See, it was revealed to him. It was
[1:10:16] revealed to Peter that Jesus was that
[1:10:20] living word.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a genuine believer.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; That's a genuine believer.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. When it's revealed to you that he's
[1:10:32] a living word, that is never true unless
[1:10:36] he's living the word in you.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; If the word is not living in you, I
[1:10:42] understand we make mistakes and flub ups
[1:10:44] and trip and fall and stumble, but I
[1:10:47] can't live there anymore. I can't stay
[1:10:49] there. I can't stay down. I got to
[1:10:52] repent and get back up because I got to
[1:10:54] live the word. I can't help myself but
[1:10:56] be a Christian.
[1:10:59] Amen. That's right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; See, it was revealed to him that he was
[1:11:04] that LIVING WORD. NOW, THAT'S A GENUINE
[1:11:07] BELIEVER WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT, NOT SOME
[1:11:11] PERSUADED BY ANOTHER PERSON, NOT NOT BY
[1:11:14] SOME OTHER THING. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS I
[1:11:17] WAS SPEAKING TO UM SARAH VLAD IN A IN IN
[1:11:20] a conversation pre premarital counseling
[1:11:23] and I and I WAS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
[1:11:24] THE MESSAGE AND I SAID, "LISTEN, I SAID
[1:11:27] IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE YOU of
[1:11:29] the of the message doctrines because
[1:11:31] they're easy to prove in the Bible.
[1:11:32] That's easy. That's the THAT'S THAT'S
[1:11:34] THE THAT'S THE sugar on top. That's not
[1:11:37] hard to do. We take all comers, all
[1:11:39] challengers, all questions, no no
[1:11:41] hesitation at all. We can easily defend
[1:11:44] the doctrines and the message of the
[1:11:45] hour, but that wouldn't give you a
[1:11:48] correct understanding of doctrine
[1:11:49] wouldn't give you the new birth.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; It the the CORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF THE
[1:11:53] WORD EQUIPS YOU WHEN YOU'VE HAD the new
[1:11:56] birth.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; So then you KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW, YOU
[1:11:59] UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UP. YOU CAN SEE YOU
[1:12:01] HAVE THE ANSWERS THAT THE WORLD IS
[1:12:03] LOOKING FOR AND YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S
[1:12:04] GOING ON AND YOU ALREADY RECOGNIZE YOUR
[1:12:06] PLACE AND YOUR POSITION.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAID IT'S NOT PERSUADED BY SOME
[1:12:12] OTHER PERSON OR SOME OTHER THING, BUT
[1:12:14] WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT, HERE'S WHAT YOU
[1:12:17] SHOULD LONG FOR. IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD THIS
[1:12:19] EXPERIENCE, HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD LONG
[1:12:21] FOR. NOT TO MEMORIZE DOCTRINE, BUT WHEN
[1:12:24] THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS REVEALED TO YOU the
[1:12:27] word itself and you SEE THE WORD MADE
[1:12:31] PLAIN VINDICATED, THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:12:34] COME AND GET INTO THAT AGE FOR THE WORD
[1:12:37] FOR THAT AGE and make IT MANIFESTED.
[1:12:41] THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE PASSED
[1:12:43] FROM DEATH TO LIFE. WHEN ALL YOUR WHOLE
[1:12:45] DESIRES OF EVERYTHING ARE CHANGED AND
[1:12:47] YOUR LIFE BECOMES A NEW MANIFESTATION,
[1:12:50] YOUR LIFE GETS A NEW SCRIPT AND YOUR
[1:12:52] LIFE IS A NEW DRAMA THAT'S BEING LIVED
[1:12:55] OUT AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND IT HAS
[1:12:58] AN ENDING SCENE. YOU GO UP,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; SATAN COMES DOWN AND A TABLE THOUSANDS
[1:13:02] OF MILES LONG.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE CLOSING SCENES OF MY DRAMA
[1:13:06] TODAY.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:13:10] SO HE SAYS, "HOW COULD A MAN KEEP FROM
[1:13:13] BELIEVING Luther Wesley?" The same way
[1:13:15] they THEY HAD TO BELIEVE IT. THAT WAS
[1:13:17] THE MESSAGE TO THAT AGE. HERE WE ARE
[1:13:21] NOW. HERE WE ARE DOWN TO THE LEODYSIAN
[1:13:24] AGE. AND WE'RE TAUGHT IN THE LEODYSIAN
[1:13:26] AGE THAT CHRIST WAS PUT ON THE OUTSIDE
[1:13:27] OF HIS CHURCH. THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE.
[1:13:29] You can see that. AND WAS EVEN KNOCKING
[1:13:31] ON THE DOOR TRYING TO GET BACK IN. SO
[1:13:34] WHEN WE SEE THAT HAPPENING, WE KNOW WHAT
[1:13:36] AGE WE'RE LIVING IN. THEN WE'RE AT THE
[1:13:40] CLOSING HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE BOOK
[1:13:44] IS NOW BEING FINISHED. THE LAST LINE
[1:13:47] WILL BE WROTE. YES, SIR. I WILL. I GOT
[1:13:50] TO BACK UP. I'M SORRY. THEN HE SAYS
[1:13:53] HERE, THIS IS HOW I GOT TO READ IT
[1:13:56] AGAIN. I'M SORRY. I'M under direction
[1:13:58] here. HE SAYS, WHEN WE SEE THAT
[1:14:00] HAPPENING, WHAT HAPPENING? WHEN WE CAN
[1:14:03] SEE CHRIST BEING PUT OUT OF THE CHURCH,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; WE CAN SEE THAT. WE CAN SEE THAT THE
[1:14:08] THAT THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH CERTAINLY HAS
[1:14:10] PUT CHRIST OUT.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS THAT'S WHEN WE SEE THAT
[1:14:14] THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WHAT AGE WE'RE LIVING
[1:14:16] IN. WHEN YOU CLAIM TO BE A MESSAGE
[1:14:20] BELIEVER AND YOU ARE NOT LIVING
[1:14:22] ACCORDING TO WHAT THE MESSAGE HAS
[1:14:24] BROUGHT TO US. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE
[1:14:25] NOT MANIFESTING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[1:14:28] BEHIND SKIN. THEN IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE
[1:14:31] THAT YOU STILL SEE THAT CHURCH AS JUST
[1:14:33] FINE
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A
[1:14:36] TIGHTER VERSION OF THAT, BUT WE'RE ALL
[1:14:37] GOING TO HEAVEN AND JESUS LOVES
[1:14:39] EVERYBODY, WHICH IS A PATENT LIE. THAT
[1:14:42] IS NOT TRUE. NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. IT'S
[1:14:45] ONLY TO WHOM THE SPIRIT WILL REVEAL IT
[1:14:47] AND THOSE HAVE TO BE ORDAINED BEFORE THE
[1:14:49] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:14:52] AND SO WHEN WHEN I WHEN I NO WONDER THAT
[1:14:55] SOMETIMES OUR SISTERS DON'T DRESS LIKE
[1:14:58] THEY SHOULD AND OUR BROTHERS DON'T AND
[1:15:00] CONDUCT THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY SHOULD
[1:15:02] IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE.
[1:15:04] GOD THE HOLY GHOST HAS NOT COME INTO YOU
[1:15:06] TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I'M HERE TO
[1:15:08] TELL YOU WE ARE DIFFERENT. WE ARE NOT
[1:15:10] THAT AT ALL. WE HAVE BROUGHT CHRIST INTO
[1:15:13] OUR HEARTS AND WE ARE A DIFFERENT KIND
[1:15:15] OF PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHO'S GOING IN THE
[1:15:18] RAPTURE. AND NO ONE
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; ELSE.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GO IN
[1:15:25] THE RAPTURE IS HIS WORD.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. IT'S NOT THE MAN THAT COMES
[1:15:30] PREDESTINATED.
[1:15:32] IT'S THE seed in the man.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; See, SO YOU REMEMBER THAT THE THAT THE
[1:15:39] BRIDE IN BROTHER BRANDHAM'S PREVIEW OF
[1:15:41] THE BRIDE, SHE GOT OUT OF STEP. BROTHER
[1:15:44] BRANDHAM SAID, "Watching that other
[1:15:46] church,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; with her boogie woogie dance
[1:15:50] Christianity,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; with her rock and roll Christian music,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; WITH HER STRIPPING OFF THE women
[1:15:57] indecent and call themselves Christians
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and IT CAUSED THE SEE, THE BRIDE CAN'T
[1:16:02] BE DECEIVED, BUT SHE CAN SOMETIMES ALLOW
[1:16:04] THE CARNAL EDGES, ALLOW SATAN TO PULL
[1:16:06] HER AWAY AND LOOK AT THE WRONG THING."
[1:16:08] AND SHE STARTED GETTING OUT OF STEP AND
[1:16:10] IT TOOK A PROPHET TO SCREAM OUT, "GET
[1:16:11] BACK IN STEP. GET BACK IN LINE. I WANT
[1:16:14] TO TELL YOU TODAY, WE'RE ALMOST HOME.
[1:16:15] GET BACK IN LINE. QUIT WATCHING THE
[1:16:18] OTHER THING. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY GO OFF
[1:16:20] A CLIFF. I UNDERSTAND GOD'S GONNA GIVE
[1:16:23] THEM MANY OF THEM SALVATION. THEY'RE
[1:16:24] THERE. MANY OF THEM GOING TO BE IN THE
[1:16:26] NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH. PROBABLY
[1:16:27] MILLIONS OF THEM. BUT THAT'S A REMNANT
[1:16:29] OF THE WOMAN'S SEAT. DON'T CONFLATE THAT
[1:16:32] WITH A TOMMY ROD AND THE HYPOCRISY OF
[1:16:35] WHAT'S CALLED TODAY THE CHRISTIAN
[1:16:37] CHURCH. THAT'S FILTH BEFORE GOD. THAT'S
[1:16:40] A HARLOT DAUGHTER TO THE HARLOT MOTHER.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; I MAY NOT GET DOWN TO IT IN MY NOTES FAR
[1:16:47] ENOUGH TODAY, SO I'M GOING TO SAY IT
[1:16:48] NOW.
[1:16:50] We can WE CAN WE CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF
[1:16:54] DEBATES, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU
[1:16:56] KNOW, EVEN EVEN WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE
[1:16:58] BRIDE, IT'S TOO BAD AND TOO SAD THAT
[1:17:00] SOMETIMES WE SPEND OUR OUR CURRENCY. YOU
[1:17:03] KNOW WHAT YOUR CURRENCY IS? YOUR LIFE
[1:17:05] SORT YOUR LIFE. YOUR TIME. YOU CAN'T GET
[1:17:08] IT BACK.
[1:17:09] I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CURRENCY IN YOUR
[1:17:11] BANK.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; That's going to go up in flames.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the value of your
[1:17:16] home. That's going to go. The antichrist
[1:17:18] is going to take that.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real currency.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Where Jesus said, "Buy of me gold. Tried
[1:17:24] it in the fire." See, that you might be
[1:17:27] really rich.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; The one thing you can't get back is
[1:17:30] time. The one thing you can't get back
[1:17:32] is life. You're burning like a candle.
[1:17:34] You're burning it every day, and it's
[1:17:36] getting lower and lower and lower.
[1:17:37] That's your currency. How are you
[1:17:39] spending your currency? It's too bad
[1:17:41] that, you know, even within the ranks of
[1:17:42] the message, we we spend our currency
[1:17:45] ARGUING OVER WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DAY OF
[1:17:48] PENTECOST AND AND YOU KNOW, AND THE AND
[1:17:50] THE ARGUMENT IS, WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:17:51] AND AND WHEN IT COMES, WHAT DOES IT LOOK
[1:17:54] LIKE AND WHAT WILL IT DO AND WHAT WILL
[1:17:55] IT MANIFEST AND WHAT GIFT AND WHAT'LL
[1:17:57] HAPPEN? AND AND THIS ONE ARGUES AGAINST
[1:17:59] THAT ONE. AND AND AND THAT THAT AR NOW
[1:18:02] LISTEN THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY RELATIVE
[1:18:04] THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY RELATIVE IS ONLY
[1:18:07] IMPORTANT TO THE BRIDE TO THE TO THE
[1:18:09] DENOMINATIONAL WORLD. THAT ARGUMENT IS
[1:18:13] moot completely.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE ARGUMENTS AND
[1:18:17] DEBATES IS A MOOT POINT TO THE
[1:18:20] DENOMINATIONAL CHURCH BECAUSE EVERYONE
[1:18:23] WHO IS FOUND INSIDE OF A DENOMINATION
[1:18:26] WILL TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. THE
[1:18:29] DENOMINATIONS ARE THE HARLOT DAUGHTERS
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; OF THE GREAT
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; AND AND AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE THE
[1:18:37] FOOLISH VIRGIN, THE ONLY THING THAT'LL
[1:18:39] SAVE HER SKIN IN THE TRIBULATION IS SHE
[1:18:43] WILL COME OUT OF THAT AND NOT TAKE THE
[1:18:45] MARK OF THE BEAST. SO THE ONLY WAY THEY
[1:18:47] EVEN ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE IS
[1:18:49] LISTEN, EVERYBODY THAT WANTS TO BE IN
[1:18:51] HEAVEN IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT OF
[1:18:53] HER. AMEN.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PRIVILEGED TO COME ALL THE WAY
[1:18:57] OUT OF HER AND RECEIVE THE ENGRAFTED
[1:18:59] WORD.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; BUT EVERYBODY, CHARLIE KIRK AND ALL OF
[1:19:02] THEM WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF EVERY
[1:19:05] SINGLE SOLITARY DENOMINATION BECAUSE
[1:19:07] DENOMINATION, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT,
[1:19:09] TAUGHT IT, THUS SAYITH THE LORD, IT WILL
[1:19:11] LEAD YOU TO THE MARK OF THE BEAST AND
[1:19:13] THERE'S NO COMING BACK FROM THAT.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; IN FACT IS HE SAID, "OH, PEOPLE SAY,
[1:19:18] "OH, WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, I'LL GET
[1:19:20] OUT WHEN I SEE IT." HE SAID, "NO, YOU'LL
[1:19:22] YOU'LL FIND OUT. YOU'RE ALREADY TRAPPED
[1:19:23] IN IT.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; You're already marked. HE SAID, "YOU GET
[1:19:26] OUT NOW." SO, SO, SO THOSE KIND OF
[1:19:29] ARGUMENTS ARE REALLY ONLY RELATIVE TO
[1:19:31] THE BRIDE ANYWAY, YOU KNOW. AND I WOULD
[1:19:33] JUST SAY TO THE BRIDE AROUND THE WORLD
[1:19:35] WHO MAY BE LISTENING, CAN WE CAN WE
[1:19:37] SPEND OUR OUR CURRENCY ON BETTER THINGS?
[1:19:40] COULD I SPEND MY CURRENCY ON JUST MAKING
[1:19:43] SURE I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND LET GOD
[1:19:45] DECIDE HOW IT'LL MANIFEST IN WHAT GIFT
[1:19:47] AND HOW HE'LL GIFT THE CHURCH SEVERALLY
[1:19:49] AS HE WILL AND WHO WILL PROVIDE WHAT
[1:19:51] WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW UH THE THE JOINT THE
[1:19:54] PART THAT EVERY JOINT SUPPLY IT IT IT
[1:19:56] LET GOD DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO SUPPLY
[1:19:59] WHAT JOINT TO THIS PART OF THE CHURCH.
[1:20:01] LET GOD DECIDE HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
[1:20:03] JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.
[1:20:05] AMEN.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; USE YOUR CURRENCY DOING THAT.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF THE SILLY ARGUMENTS THAT GO
[1:20:13] BACK AND FORTH.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I THINK IF YOU REALLY SPEND YOUR
[1:20:17] CURRENCY CORRECTLY, YOU WON'T BE A PARTY
[1:20:20] TO nonsense arguments like that. I think
[1:20:23] you'll be you'll be looking in the book
[1:20:24] going, "Lord, HOW CAN I MANIFEST YOU
[1:20:26] MORE?"
[1:20:28] AND WHATEVER way you want to, how you
[1:20:30] ever you want to gift THE CHURCH
[1:20:32] SEVERALLY AS YOU WILL. However you want
[1:20:34] EACH JOINT TO SUPPLY ITS OWN PART,
[1:20:36] HOWEVER YOU WANT IT TO MANIFEST IN ME,
[1:20:38] THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM MY NEIGHBOR
[1:20:40] OR DIFFERENT IN ONE CHURCH and different
[1:20:41] AT THIS CHURCH AND OR VICE VERSA. AND IT
[1:20:44] MIGHT BE ONE THIS MONTH AND FLIP TO THE
[1:20:45] NEXT MONTH. I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T
[1:20:47] MATTER. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HIM.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW HIM AND THE POWER OF HIS
[1:20:53] RESURRECTION.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:56] WE'RE IN A DRAMA AND IT'S ALMOST OVER.
[1:20:58] WE'RE AT THE CLOSING SCENES. BROTHER
[1:21:00] BRANDHAM SAYS THAT HERE. WE'RE AT THE
[1:21:03] CLOSING OF HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE
[1:21:06] BOOK IS NOW BEING FINISHED.
[1:21:09] THE LAST LINE WILL BE WROTE ACROSS IT
[1:21:12] SOMEDAY AND SHALL BE closed up. Then
[1:21:16] time shall be no more. And there is a
[1:21:19] great drama being set and angels ARE
[1:21:23] STANDING OVER THE SKIES WATCHING. YOU
[1:21:24] KNOW WHAT A DRAMA IS? THE ACTORS ARE
[1:21:26] READY. You can see them acting. You can
[1:21:28] see the evil one acting. You can see the
[1:21:30] villain of the play. HOW HE'S COME ON
[1:21:32] THE scene with his cunningness to
[1:21:33] deceive. And and you REMEMBER BROTHER
[1:21:35] BRANDON TALKS ABOUT SHAKESPEARE AND
[1:21:37] MCBTH and Carmen. And I think Rebecca
[1:21:39] played in Carmen. AND AND BROTHER BROWN
[1:21:42] SAID, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN WHEN he
[1:21:44] wrote that for the king of England, he
[1:21:46] Shakespeare did not believe in witches,
[1:21:48] but the king of England believed in
[1:21:50] witches. So Shakespeare to make the king
[1:21:52] happy had to include witches inside of
[1:21:54] his
[1:21:56] play. AND SO THERE AND BROTHER BAM TALKS
[1:21:59] ABOUT HOW THAT THEY HAD JUST HAD IT AT
[1:22:00] JEFF Jeff High AND I'VE I'VE BEEN TO
[1:22:02] Jeff High and they have really
[1:22:04] tremendous productions there. Uh it's
[1:22:06] kind of one of THEIR THINGS. AND SO HE
[1:22:08] SAID AND SO BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD SEEN IT
[1:22:10] HAD SAW EVEN REBECCA PLAYING A PART. HE
[1:22:12] SAYS you can see the evil one acting.
[1:22:14] You can see THE VILLAIN OF THE PLAY AND
[1:22:16] NOW HE'S COME ON THE SCENE WITH HIS
[1:22:18] CUNNINGNESS TO DECEIVE, BUT YOU CAN ALSO
[1:22:20] SEE THE RAPTURED CHURCH MAKING HERSELF
[1:22:22] READY. IT'S A GREAT SCENE.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Oh man, it's a great scene.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:22:31] VINDICATING AND MAKING THE DRAMA THAT'S
[1:22:34] FORETOLD here in this Bible TO ACT
[1:22:36] ITSELF OUT. WHAT A TIME TO LIVE.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU AMEN THAT TODAY? WHAT A TIME TO
[1:22:42] LIVE. THE MOST GLORIOUS TIME. THE MAN OF
[1:22:47] ALL AGES HAS LONGED FOR THIS TIME. THE
[1:22:51] PROPHETS OF OLD LONGED TO SEE THIS HOUR,
[1:22:54] BUT WASN'T PRIVILEGED.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; But you have been privileged to not only
[1:23:02] see it, but to and to believe it, but to
[1:23:06] be it.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; How many beers are here today?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; How many believers? How many beers?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANNABE BEERS?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; COME ON, STAND UP. STAND UP TO YOUR FEET
[1:23:19] WITH ME. RAISE UP THOSE HANDS SO THE
[1:23:21] LORD CAN SEE IT. I WANT TO BE THE WORD,
[1:23:23] LORD. I WANT TO FULFILL MY PART OF THE
[1:23:25] DRAMA. I WANT TO LIVE OUT. I WANT THE
[1:23:28] SCRIPT. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE MATCHING
[1:23:30] THE SHEETWORK.
[1:23:32] I DON'T WANT TO BE FIGURING MY OWN SELF
[1:23:34] OUT. THE WORLD'S GOING TO GO INTO CHAOS
[1:23:36] AND IT'S ALREADY GONE INTO CHAOS AND I
[1:23:38] DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT. I want
[1:23:40] to be in that number.
