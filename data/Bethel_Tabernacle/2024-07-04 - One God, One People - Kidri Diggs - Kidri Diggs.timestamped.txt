[53:35] them that they may be one even as we
[53:41] are even as we are one i in them and
[53:47] thou in me that they may be made perfect
[53:52] in one and that the world may know that
[53:56] thou has sent me and has loved them as
[54:00] thou has loved me amen May Lord a bless
[54:04] reading of his word you can have your
[54:06] seats by the grace of
[54:09] God oh
[54:12] my I want to read uh one more verse of
[54:15] scripture um in Ephesians chapter
[54:19] 4 just
[54:20] to keep going with that channel right
[54:23] there Ephesians chap 4:4 it says
[54:26] there is one body and one Spirit even as
[54:30] ye are called in one hope of your
[54:32] calling one Lord One Faith one baptism
[54:37] one God and Father of all who is above
[54:40] all and through all and in you all amen
[54:44] you know by the grace of God I want to
[54:46] use for a
[54:48] subject one God one people amen one God
[54:53] one people and you know Church uh as we
[54:57] look
[54:58] around there are a lot of churches all
[55:00] over the place there are a lot of
[55:03] different doctrines and denominations
[55:05] and a lot of people proclaiming to be
[55:08] the people of
[55:09] God but at the same time everybody is
[55:12] saying they serve that one God Amen and
[55:16] tonight I I believe that we're we're
[55:19] we're further alone trying to describe
[55:22] that there's just one God we should
[55:25] believe that amen
[55:27] we that that should even be a a question
[55:30] in our mind that there is one God but I
[55:33] think the the greatest question we have
[55:35] to answer is the one people amen and you
[55:39] know I uh the only way I I can see
[55:42] answering that is how you respond to the
[55:45] word of God because God is in his word
[55:48] and God is his word amen and you know uh
[55:51] uh the Bible says in the beginning was
[55:53] the word the word was with God and the
[55:55] Word was made flesh
[55:56] so no matter which dispensation you put
[55:59] it in the beginning the coming and now
[56:02] here it's still that same one God and
[56:06] you know if and and if you can see
[56:08] yourself being the people of that one
[56:11] God you have to be able to see yourself
[56:13] identified with him in the beginning
[56:15] amen you have to be able to see yourself
[56:18] identified with him coming Hallelujah
[56:21] but most of all you have to be able to
[56:22] see yourself identified in the now
[56:25] Hallelujah that that same one God is
[56:27] here right now amen and you know if I
[56:30] could just go uh to Genesis 1 you know
[56:33] familiar verse of scripture let's just
[56:35] look at it church just one God and just
[56:37] one people amen now we believe uh that
[56:41] our God is one God you know in the in
[56:44] the Old Testament they call him Jehovah
[56:46] and God Almighty and as the revelation
[56:48] of God unfolded it came into the uh uh
[56:52] uh the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[56:56] you know know uh different churches or
[56:58] different teachings try to separate
[57:01] those two Hallelujah but we know that
[57:03] there's one amen one God hallelujah but
[57:07] when we look at that one God and we look
[57:09] at what he did and as he created God
[57:12] created the heavens and the Earth and
[57:14] all these things and even in Genesis 1
[57:17] and verse uh 26 the Bible says uh and
[57:23] God said let us make man in our image
[57:27] after our likeness Hallelujah now you
[57:30] take those words right there let us make
[57:32] man in our image after our likeness now
[57:36] it look like there's there's more than
[57:38] one entity
[57:40] there that's what it looks like but we
[57:43] know God to be one amen hallelujah so
[57:47] I'm not going to go on and on into that
[57:49] but you know you think about he said let
[57:51] us make man in our image in our likeness
[57:55] now uh I'm just going to hit it maybe
[57:57] brother Jason or brother mat can come
[57:58] back down and and give you the teachings
[58:00] of it but we know when God was saying us
[58:04] he was talking to that which pertained
[58:06] to him amen because there was nothing
[58:09] else that could make something in his
[58:11] image in that moment Hallelujah the only
[58:15] thing that existed the only thing that
[58:17] created was God and I'll say right now
[58:20] the only one that was speaking was God
[58:23] hallelujah nobody else could talk in
[58:25] that moment because the Bible the the
[58:27] the word of God said that God be to
[58:29] speak and he begin to say Let There be
[58:32] uh there was nobody else saying let
[58:34] there be God was the only one Hallelujah
[58:37] and now that same God was going to
[58:39] create Hallelujah a people amen or
[58:43] should I say a person Hallelujah but
[58:45] this person being created was in the
[58:48] very image and likeness of God oh my I'm
[58:51] trying not to go there but I got to go
[58:53] there man Hallelujah the image and
[58:55] likeness of God and we know that God was
[58:58] eternal Hallelujah so in that person was
[59:02] eternity yes oh I got to help you out a
[59:05] little bit
[59:06] okay praise God I don't mind helping
[59:09] that's what I do I'm I'm here to help
[59:12] Hallelujah I was created to help the
[59:22] church now you uh uh the word of God has
[59:25] been preaching this church so much you
[59:27] should know your part
[59:29] already Hallelujah you should know
[59:31] Hallelujah that there's something in you
[59:33] that agrees with the word and when you
[59:35] agree with it there's something that
[59:37] comes out of you that sounds like
[59:40] this Hallelujah and you know Church
[59:43] Hallelujah that that that God him all by
[59:46] himself he was eternal and he said let
[59:49] us create men in our image and likeness
[59:52] so eternity was in those people
[59:54] hallelujah in His image in his likeness
[59:57] and his greatness amen the power of the
[59:59] spoken word was in those people
[1:00:01] hallelujah and as God begin to
[1:00:04] condescend the different Hallelujah the
[1:00:07] different stages of God begin to unveil
[1:00:10] as God became Hallelujah self-existing
[1:00:13] Elohim self-existing power of God is in
[1:00:17] those people hallelujah you don't need
[1:00:19] alcohol you don't need drugs you don't
[1:00:21] need the things of the world why because
[1:00:23] God is self-existing amen you don't need
[1:00:26] help from Tylenol help from all this
[1:00:30] other medicine and all the why because
[1:00:32] God is self-existing amen he already put
[1:00:35] that inside of you you don't need help
[1:00:37] from anything else but
[1:00:41] God you can't separate God from his
[1:00:46] people hallelujah that's the whole just
[1:00:49] of my message Hallelujah you what we've
[1:00:53] done through all these years and we put
[1:00:56] God over here and we put the people over
[1:00:58] here if we could just see what God
[1:01:01] sees if you could just look in the
[1:01:03] mirror and see what God sees Hallelujah
[1:01:07] that's already there in you that's
[1:01:10] already there Hallelujah according to
[1:01:13] what God created from the beginning amen
[1:01:16] hallelujah and as God created he talked
[1:01:19] and the another stage of God was the
[1:01:21] logos which was creative power that also
[1:01:25] is in his
[1:01:31] people the power to create is in the
[1:01:35] bride of Christ oh see let's make it
[1:01:38] personal in the family of
[1:01:41] God Amen oh hallelujah oh my yeah we say
[1:01:46] bride over here church over here bride
[1:01:48] over here I like the word family
[1:01:51] Hallelujah family of God hallelujah to
[1:01:54] have a family amen that there has to be
[1:01:56] some kind of conception there there has
[1:01:59] to be some kind of Kindred or connection
[1:02:01] there Hallelujah and God had to
[1:02:03] fertilize your life with the word of God
[1:02:06] so that you could come forth as what
[1:02:09] word
[1:02:10] beings hallelujah we're not coming we're
[1:02:13] not coming forth as Church gos
[1:02:15] hallelujah we're coming forth as word
[1:02:18] beings because who is God God is the
[1:02:21] word and you cannot separate me from the
[1:02:24] word why because we are a part of God so
[1:02:28] as you grow and as you hear the word
[1:02:30] what do you become the
[1:02:34] word I shouldn't say become because
[1:02:37] you're already
[1:02:39] it hallelujah what God is trying to
[1:02:43] do is to get you back in that thought
[1:02:46] process the right thought process you
[1:02:50] know it's like having a child and that
[1:02:52] when that child is is is is Young and is
[1:02:55] a little baby that child really doesn't
[1:02:58] understand who you
[1:03:00] are to a certain extent they know that
[1:03:04] you're mother or your father but they
[1:03:06] don't know the depths of your love yet W
[1:03:10] hallelujah oh my they don't know how
[1:03:13] much of a protector you are Hallelujah
[1:03:17] they don't know that you'll give your
[1:03:18] own life just so they oh
[1:03:21] my you give your whole life just so that
[1:03:25] they can have have life how many times
[1:03:27] we've heard of mothers lifting up cars
[1:03:30] or snatching kids out of the road why so
[1:03:32] they could be protected amen Church
[1:03:35] where did that come from where does
[1:03:37] protection come from it didn't come from
[1:03:40] the devil Hallelujah protection comes
[1:03:43] from God that's already in his
[1:03:46] people
[1:03:48] hallelujah W Hallelujah and as God came
[1:03:52] down he began to condescend and the
[1:03:54] different uh stages of God came down and
[1:03:57] then God spoke and he said let us make
[1:04:00] man Hallelujah in our image and our
[1:04:03] likeness anything else he created before
[1:04:05] that he never uttered those
[1:04:08] words but you were so special when God
[1:04:12] created you he wanted to see
[1:04:17] himself oh
[1:04:22] my and if that one ain't good enough for
[1:04:24] you I got it written in blood
[1:04:28] blood I'm going get you to come along
[1:04:30] one way or another Hallelujah but church
[1:04:33] when when we look at the start the start
[1:04:35] of and don't get nervous I'm about to
[1:04:37] close as we look at the start of we
[1:04:39] think about God and his people you know
[1:04:42] God has given us various scriptures to
[1:04:46] identify that we are
[1:04:50] him who yes a part of him but when you
[1:04:55] really really get the Revelation you are
[1:04:58] him cuz look I can't separate my head
[1:05:01] from my body and say it's
[1:05:04] living no if something happens to my
[1:05:08] hand it's a part of my body I want every
[1:05:11] Limb and everything working like it's
[1:05:12] supposed to why because it's a part of
[1:05:15] who I am Hallelujah my hand has a
[1:05:19] purpose in the body Hallelujah most of
[1:05:22] us have 10 toes
[1:05:27] I thought everybody going to say Amen on
[1:05:29] that one some of you got a little
[1:05:30] problem
[1:05:32] huh Hallelujah most of us have 10 toes
[1:05:36] why you cut one of those toes off it
[1:05:39] will affect your
[1:05:41] balance so God has given you things in
[1:05:43] your life in your body Hallelujah for
[1:05:47] balance amen and he's given us a word
[1:05:50] hallelujah a word that came Hallelujah
[1:05:53] in our day to do what bring back the
[1:05:55] balance in his house bring back the
[1:05:59] balance to his family amen the worst
[1:06:01] thing you can see is a family that's
[1:06:04] unbalance but God hallelujah sent the
[1:06:07] prophet why did he sent the prophet he
[1:06:09] said behold I see
[1:06:13] you because of
[1:06:16] you that's the only only reason oh my
[1:06:19] church look at it the only reason God
[1:06:22] came out of hiding come on
[1:06:27] the only reason he came out of hiding
[1:06:29] was because of you oh my he wanted you
[1:06:33] to know that you are his child and
[1:06:37] better yet more than just his child you
[1:06:39] are a part of
[1:06:41] him but in our day we in our time where
[1:06:45] we are right now we should be living a
[1:06:47] little bit higher than just saying I'm a
[1:06:50] part of
[1:06:54] God CU my hand is a part of me but there
[1:06:57] are certain things it has to
[1:07:00] do it has to do
[1:07:02] amen yeah I could put my face down in a
[1:07:05] plate and eat like
[1:07:08] the no but it'll be so much easier with
[1:07:11] my hands Hallelujah because my hands are
[1:07:14] there what to feed the body amen see
[1:07:18] there's perp there's purpose in this
[1:07:20] church there's purpose in every
[1:07:22] individual here why because you are a
[1:07:25] part of of the body Hallelujah and God
[1:07:28] created man in His image and in his
[1:07:30] likeness nothing else did he create like
[1:07:33] that there are things that he created
[1:07:36] that's a type of God hallelujah but we
[1:07:38] are more than just a type we are the
[1:07:41] real
[1:07:43] deal I want you to catch it church every
[1:07:46] Church age up to now was just a shadow
[1:07:49] of
[1:07:50] God that's right Hallelujah it was a
[1:07:54] shadow of what's the come but in our day
[1:07:57] so much was revealed to let us know who
[1:08:00] we are we're no longer living in the
[1:08:03] shadows we can step out there like Jesus
[1:08:06] said when you see me you see the
[1:08:11] father
[1:08:13] Hallelujah well let's go
[1:08:16] look God has been throwing us hints in
[1:08:19] the
[1:08:21] scripture
[1:08:22] Hallelujah he says in Colossians 1
[1:08:26] he says to whom
[1:08:28] God would make known what is the richest
[1:08:31] of his glory to the to this mystery
[1:08:35] among the Gentiles there is a mystery of
[1:08:38] God's glory Among
[1:08:43] Us and you'll never understand it until
[1:08:46] you start seeing yourself like God sees
[1:08:49] you he says uh the glory of his mystery
[1:08:52] among the Gentiles which is now he's
[1:08:54] going to tell what the mystery is
[1:08:57] according to the scripture here is your
[1:09:00] hint and the Mystery is hallelujah
[1:09:02] Christ in you the hope of glory now if
[1:09:05] Christ is in me that must mean I am
[1:09:11] Christ now I know that this is this is a
[1:09:15] a little hard to swallow but I'm not
[1:09:17] talking as a person taking God's Place
[1:09:21] per se but what I'm saying church is
[1:09:23] that God has put attributes of himself
[1:09:27] in
[1:09:27] us hallelujah God has put the natures
[1:09:31] and characteristics of himself in us
[1:09:34] hallelujah so there are times in our
[1:09:36] lives when things happen where we will
[1:09:39] reflect who's in
[1:09:42] us hallelujah and it comes out in a
[1:09:45] trial it comes out Hallelujah in
[1:09:47] Tribulation the mystery of how we keep
[1:09:50] going what is it Christ in you which
[1:09:53] gives us hope
[1:09:55] amen yes sir
[1:09:58] Hallelujah that's why you just saying
[1:10:00] I'm a Baptist is not good enough Christ
[1:10:03] is not identified with that anymore
[1:10:05] there's more of him that's been
[1:10:08] unveiled hallelujah or even I'm in the
[1:10:11] message hallelujah amen that has to be
[1:10:14] more than just a statement it has to
[1:10:16] become a literal living
[1:10:24] being look he says in the beginning was
[1:10:28] the word and the Word was with God the
[1:10:33] beginning
[1:10:34] word the word was with God and then it
[1:10:39] says and the Word was
[1:10:42] God so the
[1:10:44] beginning was a word and that beginning
[1:10:48] in that word was God so I want you to
[1:10:51] understand that your beginning was God
[1:10:55] yeah hallu W Hallelujah glory and if God
[1:11:01] gave you his own life your beginning
[1:11:04] Hallelujah has no
[1:11:13] beginning if you was with God and the
[1:11:16] Word was God Hallelujah the beginning
[1:11:19] and the Word was all
[1:11:22] God and if you was there you have the
[1:11:24] same characteristics as who
[1:11:31] God if we if we just take a natural
[1:11:33] point of view for a second Hallelujah my
[1:11:36] daughter Kier is here with me
[1:11:39] tonight that's my travel buddy she
[1:11:41] normally goes with me everywhere I go if
[1:11:43] she can and you know church if you look
[1:11:47] at her deep enough you'll see some of my
[1:11:51] characteristics as much as she might not
[1:11:53] like that there's a reflection of a
[1:11:57] father in her
[1:12:00] oh W Hallelujah there's Natures that
[1:12:05] will just come out that belong to me
[1:12:08] that are in
[1:12:09] her why it's passed down through the
[1:12:12] bloodline Hallelujah and better yet it's
[1:12:15] a part of her DNA that comes from me
[1:12:20] Hallelujah now that was already in me
[1:12:22] but then it transformed Hallelujah it
[1:12:25] transformed to her when she was born so
[1:12:28] I want you to understand when there is a
[1:12:31] birth there is a transfer or
[1:12:34] DNA hallelujah hallelujah DNA nature
[1:12:40] characteristics Hallelujah the way you
[1:12:42] look all the things that comes from that
[1:12:44] father begins to be injected in another
[1:12:47] cycle of
[1:12:48] life but as that life begins to live and
[1:12:51] it grows Hallelujah the your father will
[1:12:54] just begin to come out whether you like
[1:12:56] it or
[1:12:57] not there's certain strands there's
[1:13:00] certain grains Hallelujah of me that in
[1:13:02] her
[1:13:03] hallelujah oh my I got brown eyes she
[1:13:07] got brown don't you got brown eyes yeah
[1:13:09] I think
[1:13:11] so H
[1:13:14] Hallelujah
[1:13:17] Glory where does that come
[1:13:19] from it comes from the father Hallelujah
[1:13:23] but look God giving us hints and he
[1:13:26] says in the beginning was the word and
[1:13:28] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:13:30] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:13:34] god wow and then we drop on down and we
[1:13:37] read a little bit more and it says and
[1:13:39] the word became
[1:13:43] flesh it dwelt among us and it became
[1:13:47] flesh so in this room there's something
[1:13:50] dwelling among us hallelujah not us as
[1:13:53] the individual but the revealing of our
[1:13:59] father Hallelujah if we just keep
[1:14:02] looking at scripture amen the different
[1:14:04] things that God has done hallelujah it
[1:14:07] says hallelujah in mark it says and they
[1:14:10] look at this now church after Christ
[1:14:12] left he will still
[1:14:16] sing Hallelujah how many know that just
[1:14:20] because God left the scene that doesn't
[1:14:22] mean he wasn't still there that's right
[1:14:25] and I give you one Hallelujah the
[1:14:27] prophet of God say after he leaves a
[1:14:29] city he says the angel of the Lord may
[1:14:32] stay behind for weeks dealing with the
[1:14:34] people why is God having communion with
[1:14:38] his
[1:14:39] creation God loves you so much his whole
[1:14:43] job his whole Destiny his whole purpose
[1:14:46] is to get you back how he originally
[1:14:49] created
[1:14:50] you that's all he's trying to do
[1:14:52] Hallelujah is get us back to what
[1:14:55] Genesis
[1:14:57] 1:26 to where there's no more fear in
[1:15:00] your
[1:15:01] spirit there's no more doubt in your
[1:15:03] spirit Hallelujah there's no more sin
[1:15:06] that's attracting your eyes before sin
[1:15:09] Hallelujah Adam looked at God Adam
[1:15:11] talked to God Adam was in his presence
[1:15:14] Adam wasn't confused by his
[1:15:18] voice
[1:15:20] amen it was one God one
[1:15:23] people
[1:15:26] Hallelujah he says and they went forth
[1:15:29] and preaching everywhere the Lord
[1:15:32] working with them I want you to
[1:15:34] understand something tonight he said the
[1:15:36] Lord working with them and confirming
[1:15:39] the word with signs following and after
[1:15:43] that following you know what comes by
[1:15:44] that
[1:15:46] following that was kind of
[1:15:49] weak
[1:15:50] Hallelujah after God sent them forth
[1:15:53] with the word showing them who they are
[1:15:55] are it says that he went with them so
[1:15:59] they were not all alone they were not by
[1:16:02] themselves God was there confirming that
[1:16:05] this is my family these are my people
[1:16:08] this is my son this is my daughter and
[1:16:11] I'm going to confirm their
[1:16:14] life
[1:16:15] hallelujah oh my listen
[1:16:20] Church you cannot separate God from his
[1:16:24] people
[1:16:26] look at what the scripture says now Paul
[1:16:27] Paul was a man who was chosen of God but
[1:16:32] God had to bring him to a place that is
[1:16:34] more than you just knowing good
[1:16:38] teaching because he had good teaching in
[1:16:40] his life he was raised up Hallelujah
[1:16:43] under the under the toolers ship of CIA
[1:16:46] amen one of the strongest old testate
[1:16:49] teachers but God wanted to come and show
[1:16:51] Paul there is more of me to be revealed
[1:16:55] and when God knocked him off his high
[1:16:57] horse he said who are thy Lord he said I
[1:16:59] am Jesus Hallelujah and from that point
[1:17:03] something came alive in
[1:17:05] Paul it was always there but it took a
[1:17:10] knockdown it took a a
[1:17:13] blindness amen it took God knocking him
[1:17:16] off his high horse just to open up his
[1:17:19] understanding and sometimes that's what
[1:17:21] trials hallelujah what was that message
[1:17:24] broken but
[1:17:25] broken but not bitter
[1:17:27] Hallelujah I hope y'all still go back
[1:17:29] and feed on these
[1:17:31] messages because God be saying things
[1:17:34] Hallelujah that will loose us God be
[1:17:37] saying things that'll help us put one
[1:17:38] foot in front of the other Hallelujah
[1:17:41] but look Church look listen what Paul
[1:17:43] said after he got converted now I want
[1:17:46] you to understand this what I keep
[1:17:49] saying one God one people he said I want
[1:17:53] them to be one like we We Are One in
[1:17:55] them and one in us hallelujah so
[1:17:58] whenever you see it all you're going to
[1:18:00] see is one amen remember Hallelujah in
[1:18:03] Acts the 4th chapter amen the disciples
[1:18:05] went out Healing The Sick and raising
[1:18:07] the dead and they said these people must
[1:18:10] have been with
[1:18:12] Jesus they saw one God hallelujah they
[1:18:16] begin to ask John the Baptist they say
[1:18:18] John who are you are you the Messiah
[1:18:20] they saw one God they saw John doing
[1:18:23] things that only God should be to do
[1:18:25] amen and John wasn't doing Mighty
[1:18:28] Miracles John was just preaching under
[1:18:31] the authority that God gave
[1:18:35] him but I love the statement that Paul
[1:18:39] makes in
[1:18:40] Romans the eighth chapter he says who
[1:18:44] shall separate us from the love of
[1:18:47] Christ I want you to understand this
[1:18:50] there's nothing in this world that can
[1:18:54] separate you from the love of
[1:18:57] Christ
[1:18:59] nothing let's go back and read it Romans
[1:19:02] the 8th
[1:19:04] chapter Romans
[1:19:15] 8 Romans 8 and
[1:19:18] 35 the Bible
[1:19:22] says who shall separate us
[1:19:25] from the love of Christ shell
[1:19:30] tribulation now you your part in that is
[1:19:32] to say
[1:19:35] no unless you believe
[1:19:38] otherwise
[1:19:39] Hallelujah shall tribulation no or
[1:19:44] distress persecution famine and we see a
[1:19:48] lot of nakedness no Hallelujah Peril
[1:19:52] sword none of these things
[1:19:55] can separate us from the love of God
[1:19:58] hallelujah oh my church and as we look
[1:20:02] at the scriptures one thing I want you
[1:20:03] to catch look I want to read you
[1:20:06] something the prophet of God
[1:20:08] said he said then see God came down and
[1:20:12] the character of God was
[1:20:17] Christ now I'm going to throw you
[1:20:19] another
[1:20:20] hint what I'm trying to do is get us all
[1:20:23] to live up to the standard of what's in
[1:20:29] us
[1:20:32] hallelujah G read that
[1:20:35] again then see God came down and the
[1:20:38] character of God was in
[1:20:42] Christ all that was in the father he
[1:20:45] poured into Christ all that was in
[1:20:48] Christ he poured
[1:20:52] into somebody say me
[1:20:57] so if he put the
[1:20:58] character in Jesus and then Jesus took
[1:21:02] that same character and where is it now
[1:21:05] in US you should see Hallelujah God's
[1:21:09] character the stature of a perfect man
[1:21:12] flowing out of you it should be a full
[1:21:15] development by
[1:21:17] now
[1:21:19] Hallelujah he said he was the reflection
[1:21:22] oh my Christ was the reflection of God
[1:21:25] the Father amen so if he poured all that
[1:21:28] into the church all that into the bride
[1:21:30] all that into you and I who are we we
[1:21:33] should be the reflection of
[1:21:36] Christ God looking back over the
[1:21:38] banister at Adam again saying oh I can
[1:21:41] rest cuz I see my image and my
[1:21:46] likeness why did God rest because there
[1:21:49] was nothing missing out of Adam's life
[1:21:52] Wow
[1:21:54] Adam was
[1:21:56] complete Oh my he was a complete son
[1:22:01] Hallelujah he said in the beginning was
[1:22:03] God he was even God then no God
[1:22:07] hallelujah is an object of worship only
[1:22:10] thing he was was eternal Hallelujah and
[1:22:14] in him was attributes and those
[1:22:16] attributes were thoughts and those
[1:22:18] thoughts was expressed now we know that
[1:22:21] we are part of God's thoughts but I'm
[1:22:24] more than just his thought I am the
[1:22:27] expression you are the expression amen
[1:22:30] because Church what is it it's no good
[1:22:32] in God's mind God
[1:22:35] was the thing about God is he loves to
[1:22:42] speak we don't have a God that sits by
[1:22:44] the side no he loves to speak so we're
[1:22:48] more than just the thought of God we are
[1:22:51] the expression of God one God one
[1:22:59] people I'mma weigh you out with us
[1:23:03] now
[1:23:04] Hallelujah
[1:23:06] listen he said we his attributes we his
[1:23:10] thoughts the thoughts was expressed to
[1:23:13] words and the words was made
[1:23:18] manifest so when you think of the
[1:23:20] thoughts being expressed even the
[1:23:23] expression go Hallelujah into something
[1:23:26] even more
[1:23:29] solid that you can put your finger on it
[1:23:32] and say I know this is God because they
[1:23:36] say it started up here as his mind then
[1:23:38] God be to speak in it and Hallelujah and
[1:23:40] it was expressed and as it was expressed
[1:23:43] it began to do
[1:23:45] something Hallelujah and as it be to do
[1:23:48] what it did it was manifesting the
[1:23:50] character of God it was manifesting the
[1:23:53] person of God
[1:23:55] see I challenge you Church Hallelujah a
[1:23:57] lot of times we preach uh people say
[1:23:59] give me something deep give me something
[1:24:00] I never heard before and then we get in
[1:24:03] these channels Hallelujah and it seems
[1:24:05] like sometimes people are lost in the
[1:24:07] atmosphere you know why because you
[1:24:09] don't study the
[1:24:15] message don't rely on the fivefold
[1:24:17] ministry to give it to
[1:24:20] you you got to spend time with God Amen
[1:24:25] hallelujah amen this is not a
[1:24:28] developmental
[1:24:31] program hallelujah we're not here to
[1:24:34] develop you we are not
[1:24:37] reformers hallelujah we're here to
[1:24:40] preach the word so that you may be
[1:24:43] quickened Hallelujah Made Alive you know
[1:24:46] when something is quickened you say man
[1:24:49] W hallelujah it's me think about sister
[1:24:53] Hallelujah when that man got down on his
[1:24:55] knee and said I want to marry you oh my
[1:24:59] something came alive inside of
[1:25:02] you I ain't getting no amens from the
[1:25:06] sisters got to tighten up Brothers you
[1:25:08] got to do a little bit
[1:25:10] more
[1:25:12] Hallelujah church when you when she or
[1:25:16] he realized that they were the one
[1:25:18] Hallelujah something begin to move
[1:25:21] inside Hallelujah all the if if it if it
[1:25:24] was something true everybody else
[1:25:26] Hallelujah that may have had an interest
[1:25:28] was shut off hallu every other phone
[1:25:32] number was
[1:25:33] erased or should I say an hour day
[1:25:36] Hallelujah every other
[1:25:41] DM Hallelujah every DM every person on
[1:25:45] social media that may have had interest
[1:25:47] interest when that person that you were
[1:25:49] longing Hallelujah to be with made up
[1:25:52] their mind and say I've chosen you
[1:25:54] it did something to you on the inside
[1:25:57] Church think about that God hallelujah
[1:26:00] God let the devil have us
[1:26:06] first don't you realize
[1:26:08] that you know
[1:26:10] why because he had all confidence in
[1:26:13] what he put inside of
[1:26:17] you he knew alcohol wasn't going to stop
[1:26:20] it from coming forth he knew a
[1:26:22] promiscuous life wasn't going to stop it
[1:26:23] from coming forth he knew drugs wasn't
[1:26:26] going to stop him from coming forth he
[1:26:28] knew the entertainment Hallelujah of the
[1:26:30] 2000s wasn't going to stop him from
[1:26:32] coming forward he knew Hollywood
[1:26:34] couldn't stop it Hallelujah he was
[1:26:37] confident he is confident that what he
[1:26:40] put inside of you will reflect who he is
[1:26:45] that's why he put you in the midst of
[1:26:47] Satan eatting and stand back just like
[1:26:49] he did in Jo's day and say watch
[1:26:52] this amen
[1:26:57] he's
[1:26:59] confident
[1:27:02] look in the beginning was God and he was
[1:27:06] he wasn't even God de he was the object
[1:27:07] of worship only thing that he was was
[1:27:10] eternal and in him was his attributes
[1:27:12] and those attributes were thoughts and
[1:27:14] those thoughts were expressed to words
[1:27:16] and the words were made manifest now
[1:27:18] this is what I like right here what is
[1:27:22] it what is it all what what is it it's
[1:27:26] all
[1:27:31] God to get you here where you are in

[1:28:12] but even even brother Jason or other
[1:28:15] preachers have had opportunities to do
[1:28:17] other things but it's been all God they
[1:28:21] say no I want you to do this why because
[1:28:23] I have Hallelujah some people for you to
[1:28:26] feed

[1:28:35] of
[1:28:38] sacrifice for God to come out in his
[1:28:41] fullness hallelujah look he said it's
[1:28:45] been all

[1:29:14] it and see it and know what it is now we
[1:29:17] know that's matad right Hallelujah he
[1:29:20] right there in that moment he's tangible
[1:29:24] if anybody want to come touch him all
[1:29:26] you got to do is come up these stairs
[1:29:27] and touch you if he'll let
[1:29:30] you Hallelujah but he's right here in
[1:29:33] our midst he's tangible he's no longer a
[1:29:36] mystery right Hallelujah some of you may
[1:29:40] have had a thought to say I wonder if
[1:29:43] Matt's coming to church tonight he's
[1:29:45] here in the
[1:29:47] flesh we can put that thought to rest
[1:29:50] and what we've been doing we've been
[1:29:51] traveling we've been going about our
[1:29:53] life wondering if God is with us church
[1:29:56] he promised I'll never leave you nor
[1:29:58] forsake you Hallelujah church he has
[1:30:01] become
[1:30:03] tangible Jes thank you man he's become
[1:30:07] tangible we shouldn't be wondering if
[1:30:09] God is with us he's with us how could we
[1:30:13] go without him it's been all God Chris
[1:30:17] it's been all God
[1:30:19] Amen oh my
[1:30:25] what I always
[1:30:26] say you know we all go through trials
[1:30:29] and tribulations and things and
[1:30:31] Hallelujah you know I was coming down
[1:30:33] the road and I felt the quicker and
[1:30:35] power God talking to me and you know I
[1:30:39] just start to go back in my life and
[1:30:43] look at all the great things God has
[1:30:45] done I met I met a guy a guy I used to
[1:30:49] work
[1:30:49] with back in 200
[1:30:54] six somewhere in
[1:30:55] there from 1998 to 2006 right before God
[1:31:00] started dealing with me by going
[1:31:01] full-time in the ministry and I was
[1:31:04] working at the city which was a good
[1:31:07] job had three weeks
[1:31:10] vacation I was making good money I had
[1:31:14] sick time all that stuff but then
[1:31:17] something start to flow up in
[1:31:21] me about giving God more than just a
[1:31:24] 10-hour shift on a job and God start
[1:31:28] dealing with me about going full-time in
[1:31:30] the ministry and and you know we all can
[1:31:34] see I'm there amen and I've been there
[1:31:37] for so many years now by God's grace but
[1:31:40] Church it took something for me to get
[1:31:43] there but it was like what God will do
[1:31:46] sometimes he'll push you just to let you
[1:31:49] know he's
[1:31:52] there because what is faith faith is
[1:31:55] walking without
[1:32:01] control hallelujah hallelujah it don't
[1:32:04] take no faith for me to come down these
[1:32:06] steps
[1:32:07] and and just run back here it don't take
[1:32:10] no faith to do that that just take a
[1:32:12] little bit of balance but you know
[1:32:14] what'll take some faith for me to get on
[1:32:17] the top of these pews right here JD and
[1:32:19] jump from this one to this one to this
[1:32:21] one and this one to this one to this one
[1:32:24] and I guarantee if I do that I have
[1:32:26] everybody attention in
[1:32:29] here as long as my walk looks normal we
[1:32:32] don't even pay it
[1:32:34] attention but let me do something I
[1:32:37] ain't supposed to do then it's
[1:32:41] extraordinary then it catches our
[1:32:43] attention
[1:32:44] attention but the mistake we're making
[1:32:47] Hallelujah God is hidden and revealed in
[1:32:50] what
[1:32:51] simplicity so your ordinary walk with
[1:32:54] God hallelujah is something
[1:32:59] powerful
[1:33:02] Hallelujah
[1:33:04] listen he said and he he said is all God
[1:33:07] becoming tangible and you are a part of
[1:33:14] God and Jesus come to redeem those that
[1:33:18] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:33:19] before the foundation of the world it
[1:33:22] was in God's thoughts and that's what he
[1:33:25] come to redeem and them as soon as it
[1:33:29] strikes Hallelujah to
[1:33:32] them see something has to take place in
[1:33:35] that walk of Faith where you realize you
[1:33:37] are
[1:33:39] different Hallelujah see Abraham got to
[1:33:43] a place to where he realized he was
[1:33:45] different Hallelujah and once he
[1:33:47] realized he was different he stopped
[1:33:49] living in
[1:33:50] fear he stopped trying to control things
[1:33:53] and he just walked by
[1:33:55] faith and as he walked Hallelujah it was
[1:33:59] God walking with him and becoming
[1:34:01] tangible Hallelujah think about the
[1:34:04] church even his fear
[1:34:06] Hallelujah God introduced himself to
[1:34:09] somebody because of
[1:34:12] Abraham when the king went and took
[1:34:14] Sarah Hallelujah he probably wasn't even
[1:34:17] a part of the promise which he wasn't
[1:34:19] but when Abraham got out of Step God had
[1:34:22] to make himself known
[1:34:27] and there are things in your life
[1:34:28] Hallelujah that make it out of step and
[1:34:31] then the tangible God will come and make
[1:34:33] himself
[1:34:35] known whether it be in your child's life
[1:34:37] the direction they're going or on your
[1:34:39] job or whatever it may be God will come
[1:34:42] and make himself
[1:34:44] tangible oh my listen he said to them as
[1:34:48] soon as it strikes they see it because
[1:34:52] the life is in
[1:34:54] there I'm going hit this and then I'm
[1:34:56] going jump out the way
[1:34:59] Hallelujah why are we living this
[1:35:01] message why are we in this message it's
[1:35:04] simple because there's something inside
[1:35:07] of us that identifies with it
[1:35:10] am Hallelujah I like I like to make this
[1:35:13] I like to make this
[1:35:15] parallel most of us in here were
[1:35:18] born after 65
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:26] some of you stal in the fence a little
[1:35:29] bit but if we look around most of
[1:35:32] us the voice of the Prophet was gone I
[1:35:36] mean the the physical physical part is
[1:35:39] gone Hallelujah we couldn't go we can't
[1:35:41] go there and sit in the services or
[1:35:44] follow where he's going to be we
[1:35:45] couldn't do none of that
[1:35:47] Hallelujah but you know what Billy
[1:35:50] Graham was still here yeah In the
[1:35:55] Flesh still going around preaching still
[1:35:58] holding Services why didn't we connect
[1:36:01] with
[1:36:04] that because there was nothing in us
[1:36:07] that could
[1:36:10] agree Hallelujah as far as a body change
[1:36:14] and then you know who else was here or
[1:36:16] Roberts was here also both of the Angels
[1:36:19] were there were still here hallelujah
[1:36:22] why didn't we connect with him
[1:36:23] Hallelujah because there was something
[1:36:26] Hallelujah about us where we needed
[1:36:28] more that's right but then let's look at
[1:36:31] God and how strategic he is church just
[1:36:34] the voice on Magnetic Tape brought us to
[1:36:39] an
[1:36:41] Awakening Hallelujah I want to show you
[1:36:44] how powerful that is not going to a
[1:36:47] service not being in a tent meeting not
[1:36:50] traveling up to Jeffersonville just
[1:36:52] hearing the V
[1:36:55] what are you saying brother JS you've
[1:36:57] heard that voice
[1:37:00] before not the voice of the man but the
[1:37:03] voice of the word and there's something
[1:37:05] inside of you that when you heard that
[1:37:07] Voice Hallelujah preaching the word
[1:37:10] something came
[1:37:12] alive what was it it was that one God
[1:37:16] connecting with that one
[1:37:18] people because a lot of other people
[1:37:20] heard that voice but they didn't hear
[1:37:22] God
[1:37:29] wow that's how special you
[1:37:34] are church do you
[1:37:37] realize there are people in Jeff that
[1:37:40] have never even heard of the
[1:37:45] Prophet but I can travel thousands of
[1:37:47] thousands JD travel thousands and
[1:37:49] thousands miles into foreign lands
[1:37:52] people listening to that
[1:37:54] voice what is it it is a chosen people
[1:37:58] that's
[1:37:59] right a people that were destined
[1:38:03] Hallelujah to connect with what one
[1:38:07] God not the god of denomination not the
[1:38:11] God of this world but the God of this
[1:38:13] word the god of Eternity the god of
[1:38:17] Deliverance the god of healing the god
[1:38:19] of Salvation the god of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:23] amen amen you were
[1:38:29] destined to
[1:38:31] connect and once you connect what was
[1:38:35] it it was one being one
[1:38:39] again
[1:38:41] hallelujah hallelujah not one being two
[1:38:44] it was one being one because that's the
[1:38:46] way God originally created Hallelujah he
[1:38:49] created man to be what one
[1:38:54] yeah and and the prophet of God say Eve
[1:38:57] didn't wait Hallelujah because her

[1:39:50] give up yeah a lot of times we give up

[1:42:00] cell
[1:42:03] phone this is
[1:42:06] a uh
[1:42:12] Galaxy I I was waiting on it I was
[1:42:15] waiting on
[1:42:16] it if if you want to go there the
[1:42:19] prophet said that we are astronauts
[1:42:21] [Applause]
[1:42:23] I can't find them for an apple but a
[1:42:27] curse so I'd rather be identified with
[1:42:29] the
[1:42:34] message this ain't no Doctrine
[1:42:38] now I was just waiting on it thank you
[1:42:41] brother
[1:42:42] Jason Hallelujah but we know this a
[1:42:45] Samsung creation and their name is on it
[1:42:49] so their name reflects who created it
[1:42:51] hallah but you take Samson when you see
[1:42:55] this you don't see the Creator
[1:42:59] yeah you just see his thoughts
[1:43:02] Hallelujah and those that piggyback
[1:43:04] office thoughts the same thing with
[1:43:06] apple you think about Steve Jobs but you
[1:43:10] don't see Steve you think about Mac
[1:43:12] computers and all these things every
[1:43:14] creation you think about Ford Motor
[1:43:16] Company you see the Ford but you don't
[1:43:18] see Henry himself you take Chevrolet or
[1:43:21] whatever it is Toyota what whatever it
[1:43:23] is you see what was created but you
[1:43:25] don't see the
[1:43:27] person God is the only one that could
[1:43:30] create something and then live in
[1:43:39] it
[1:43:41] my you may have Michelin tires but you
[1:43:45] don't see Michelin himself Hallelujah
[1:43:47] you may see Good Year tires but you
[1:43:49] don't see Hallelujah the creator of Good
[1:43:52] Year you just see what was on their mind
[1:43:54] Church who we are we are the
[1:43:57] manifestation of what was on God's mind
[1:44:00] we're more than just his thoughts we are
[1:44:03] the real
[1:44:05] deal Hallelujah cuz you can build a
[1:44:08] computer Hallelujah but the person
[1:44:10] building can't control it and show his
[1:44:12] whole person and character and
[1:44:14] everything coming out of that computer
[1:44:16] God made a man and then he show the
[1:44:18] whole world what that man should be
[1:44:21] doing
[1:44:29] Hallelujah
[1:44:31] listen as we prepare to try to
[1:44:36] close listen what what does it
[1:44:39] take just what it
[1:44:41] takes now remember my thought one God
[1:44:47] one people when you leave out of the
[1:44:49] service I don't want you to look at
[1:44:51] yourself as separate from
[1:44:55] God because that's not how God created
[1:44:58] it when God saw Adam what did he see
[1:45:03] himself he was so happy with what he
[1:45:07] created he went to Adam and he put the
[1:45:10] rest of Creation in Adam's
[1:45:13] hands he said I want you to name it I
[1:45:16] want you to tell it what to do tell her
[1:45:17] where to go I leave it all to you Adam
[1:45:20] and all of that was good as long as Adam
[1:45:23] knew he was one with
[1:45:26] God but when fear and sin came in and
[1:45:29] Adam couldn't think like that anymore
[1:45:32] Hallelujah he lost the ability to
[1:45:35] operate in those
[1:45:37] channels but the channels were still
[1:45:41] there and God in his grace he made sure
[1:45:45] we had a way
[1:45:48] back listen he says now the first man
[1:45:51] and first woman in the garden of eaten
[1:45:53] was in a perfect harmony with God so
[1:45:58] much that God could come down at any
[1:46:00] time he desired to talk lip to ear with
[1:46:04] Adam and Eve what will get us there at
[1:46:06] church Perfect
[1:46:10] Harmony One Lord One Faith one baptism
[1:46:14] what is that Perfect
[1:46:19] Harmony what'll happen if we have
[1:46:21] Perfect Harmony in here tonight
[1:46:25] oh with our thoughts of who we are and
[1:46:29] our imperfections and all these things
[1:46:32] didn't exist in our
[1:46:35] minds what if we got to a place where we
[1:46:37] just we sitting in our
[1:46:39] seat Hallelujah you sitting right there
[1:46:42] aing and you
[1:46:43] say I know God is my
[1:46:47] father I know Hallelujah that God is
[1:46:50] here and we all as one people hallelujah
[1:46:56] find that one channel of that one God
[1:46:59] and produce a perfect harmony what will
[1:47:02] it do it'll bring us back to
[1:47:09] eaten now that is perfect
[1:47:14] Oneness God in his creation God speaking
[1:47:17] lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they
[1:47:19] were in perfect harmony with god Till
[1:47:22] They Were one with God God and his
[1:47:26] family was one see he never put it a God
[1:47:30] and them no God and his family won
[1:47:34] Hallelujah when you go on a family
[1:47:36] vacation most of the times uh everybody
[1:47:39] go together the father don't just send
[1:47:41] his family down there and then he say he
[1:47:43] coming no normally everybody goes
[1:47:46] together
[1:47:48] Hallelujah listen he says that's God's
[1:47:52] purpose and his purpose as father
[1:47:54] Supreme was to be one with his family
[1:47:57] Hallelujah Earthly family Adam and Eve
[1:48:00] and the only way that they could be one
[1:48:02] with the family or with God was because
[1:48:06] God's nature was in
[1:48:08] them
[1:48:13] Hallelujah so we have a promise of
[1:48:16] Perfect Harmony and relationship with
[1:48:18] God is because the same nature of him is
[1:48:23] in
[1:48:26] you I know that's a little heavy to
[1:48:28] swallow but I want everybody do like
[1:48:34] this we're more than just church
[1:48:37] gos I've been preaching on
[1:48:41] fundamentalism
[1:48:43] fundamental church with Pentecostal
[1:48:48] Faith that's what I've been preaching on
[1:48:50] but tonight God wanted me to kind of go
[1:48:51] this way but I'll drop a little
[1:48:53] a snippet in there we're happy with
[1:48:57] being fundamental there's nothing wrong
[1:48:58] with being
[1:48:59] fundamental but what good is your
[1:49:01] fundamentalism with no faith that's
[1:49:04] it'll make the word of no effect you
[1:49:06] have all the doctrine you have all the
[1:49:08] law the dos and don'ts all that stuff
[1:49:11] fundamental but when Jesus come when
[1:49:13] Jesus came what do they do they call him
[1:49:15] a devil but they were fundamental
[1:49:18] Hallelujah the prophet say you couldn't
[1:49:20] put a finger on their lives but when the
[1:49:22] opening of the word came they couldn't
[1:49:24] receive it why because the word heard
[1:49:27] was not mixed with faith
[1:49:30] that's and this message is no good if
[1:49:33] it's not mixed with Holy Ghost Faith
[1:49:35] that's what Pentecost faith is it's the
[1:49:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[1:49:40] remember the prophet of God said Cain
[1:49:42] was fundamental he wasn't an unbeliever
[1:49:45] he was a
[1:49:46] Believer but he couldn't allow himself
[1:49:49] to open up to the regions of Faith he
[1:49:52] wanted to control his
[1:49:56] worship unlike his brother Hallelujah
[1:49:59] Abel was able to open up to the regions
[1:50:02] of faith and God took him into spaces
[1:50:05] that hadn't even been revealed yet on
[1:50:10] Earth so let's not just be fundamental
[1:50:12] people let's be fundamental people with
[1:50:14] Pentecostal Faith Hallelujah because he
[1:50:17] said one is like having a checkbook
[1:50:19] Hallelujah with no money in the bank he
[1:50:21] said the other is like having money in
[1:50:22] the bank with no checkbook and then he
[1:50:24] says if I could ever get those two
[1:50:28] together we should be in the blend
[1:50:33] already we should be fundamental with
[1:50:36] Pentecostal
[1:50:38] Faith H and he says if I can ever get
[1:50:42] those two together it'll bring the
[1:50:47] Millennium oh
[1:50:51] my everybody all right don't get
[1:50:55] nervous he said oh with God or was God
[1:50:58] God's nature was in them so that made
[1:51:01] them with God's nature in
[1:51:04] them remember he said I'm not only going
[1:51:07] to just be with you but I'll be in
[1:51:11] you how many of us are looking for
[1:51:15] that
[1:51:17] amen Church you know something happened
[1:51:19] to me one day this week I had to go take
[1:51:21] care of some business do some
[1:51:23] things but it was just you know it was
[1:51:26] just pressing me before I get my day
[1:51:29] started pray about
[1:51:32] it so I did prayed about it and I just
[1:51:36] asked God to leave me to the right
[1:51:39] places Church in just that
[1:51:43] prayer God begin to open this door
[1:51:47] direct me over here to this person who I
[1:51:49] may have thought had the answer and they
[1:51:51] didn't have it so they told me to go to
[1:51:53] this person and this person say okay
[1:51:55] yeah I take care of this but if you need
[1:51:57] this go to this person God was just
[1:52:00] directing that's what we want to be we
[1:52:02] want to be in perfect harmony with
[1:52:09] God I hope your goal on this Earth
[1:52:13] wasn't just to find a good Christian
[1:52:15] wife or a good Christian
[1:52:18] husband it got to be more than that
[1:52:21] because there'll be when you get tired
[1:52:23] of that
[1:52:31] person don't say it too loud
[1:52:36] bro oh
[1:52:38] my
[1:52:41] listen as I prepare the
[1:52:45] cloth but it becomes a real revelation
[1:52:48] of God that you see it before it happens
[1:52:52] and and express it in word form the word
[1:52:55] takes a hold and becomes material a
[1:52:58] thought expressed see we are the
[1:53:03] material
[1:53:05] Hallelujah because we heard it we
[1:53:08] received it and now we're seeing it as
[1:53:10] it happens
[1:53:13] Hallelujah he said my how God could see
[1:53:16] it your heart your mind is so and filled
[1:53:20] with God's spirit until your thoughts be
[1:53:22] his thoughts amen there you are when
[1:53:25] your mind and your leading and your
[1:53:27] guiding becomes a direct place or direct
[1:53:31] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:53:34] moving your mortal
[1:53:39] being not you and God just
[1:53:44] God what kind of people should we
[1:53:47] be if the very Holy
[1:53:50] Spirit has you so embodied or empowered
[1:53:54] that you don't use your own
[1:53:57] thoughts see he's already given us a
[1:54:00] hint the scripture says let this mind be
[1:54:04] in
[1:54:05] you don't use your mind use his
[1:54:08] mind it's all
[1:54:11] God hallelujah Paul say it's no longer I
[1:54:16] but Christ that liveth in
[1:54:21] me he you don't use your own thoughts
[1:54:23] you don't use your own mind you don't
[1:54:24] use your own opinions but the Holy
[1:54:27] Spirit has you so built unto your
[1:54:29] thoughts and your being is God's spirit
[1:54:33] expressing itself through you what kind
[1:54:35] of church would we
[1:54:37] be come on musicians I'm
[1:54:41] closing one
[1:54:44] God one
[1:54:47] people I want to challenge you tonight
[1:54:53] if you come to
[1:54:54] church and there's nothing stirring in
[1:54:57] you there's another Spirit pulling on
[1:55:01] you there's another power drawing you
[1:55:04] out so you don't hear this and be
[1:55:06] quickened and what that spirit will do
[1:55:09] that spirit will try to kill steal and
[1:55:11] destroy
[1:55:12] you and you may have heard these things
[1:55:15] all the time Hallelujah you know what
[1:55:17] happened to young people they look at
[1:55:18] their unsaved family members and they
[1:55:20] think they having a ball but you don't
[1:55:23] see them at
[1:55:24] night when they in the bed maybe think
[1:55:27] about how they going to kill
[1:55:29] theyel or you don't see them when they
[1:55:31] bouncing from job to job and wondering
[1:55:33] how they going to survive all these
[1:55:35] other things it looks real good on the
[1:55:37] outside and I'm saying to you if you
[1:55:40] Hallelujah if there's nothing in you
[1:55:42] stirring you need to get on your knees
[1:55:45] that's right and say
[1:55:48] Lord
[1:55:50] anybody be what God wants to be but just
[1:55:54] don't be
[1:55:57] nobody Hallelujah you want to be one
[1:56:00] with
[1:56:02] God hallelujah because we're finding and
[1:56:05] we're seeing so many people are going on
[1:56:07] to be with the Lord the courses are
[1:56:09] being
[1:56:11] finished the courses are moving
[1:56:14] on I don't know about you but I want to
[1:56:16] know Hallelujah I want to make sure that
[1:56:20] I'll be there by the grace of God
[1:56:26] hallelujah I'll tell you a
[1:56:29] testimony I was in Arizona a couple
[1:56:32] weeks
[1:56:35] ago and you know I was just kind of
[1:56:37] looking at my life and you know and I
[1:56:41] think it's good sometimes to examine
[1:56:43] yourself you know when I was examining
[1:56:46] myself and but just be careful don't
[1:56:48] examine Yourself by the trials you going
[1:56:51] through
[1:56:53] examine Yourself by what God has
[1:56:56] done in my mistake I was examining
[1:56:59] Myself by the battle
[1:57:01] Hallelujah like man boy this is tough
[1:57:04] this is hard to battle you know I got to
[1:57:06] I got to get to this I got to get to
[1:57:07] that you know the battle and I was
[1:57:10] looking at my testimony how God healed
[1:57:12] me from cancer all those years ago and
[1:57:14] like the devil was saying that's all you
[1:57:17] got which God and I know God has done
[1:57:20] more Hallelujah remember we made that
[1:57:22] video let me tell you a spirit of
[1:57:25] depression had came and the enemy wanted
[1:57:28] me to call you and tell you let's take
[1:57:30] that video
[1:57:34] down let's take that video down and redo
[1:57:37] it with something
[1:57:39] else and in a moment when I was thinking
[1:57:42] that a sister sent me a a clip of a
[1:57:46] service I was preaching somewhere and I
[1:57:48] was talking about my testimony and she
[1:57:50] went to the com comment and she
[1:57:53] highlighted somebody in the comments
[1:57:55] said I thank God for this testimony cuz
[1:57:57] I was just diagnosed with
[1:58:00] cancer what if my feelings would have
[1:58:02] gotten way out of Miss God that's why
[1:58:05] it's so important to be in perfect
[1:58:07] harmony with him and even in that God

[2:05:52] how's it going to be it seems like it's
[2:05:54] going to be impossible all of God's
[2:05:55] family to be one well you know what I'm
[2:05:57] so grateful for I love I heard a brother
[2:06:01] um I think it was brother Josh Bennett
[2:06:03] maybe it's another brother but he gave a
[2:06:05] you know he gave the example of what
[2:06:07] real Oneness is and he talked about how
[2:06:10] that you know that it would be if it
[2:06:13] would be a a mess if we tried to tune
[2:06:16] that piano off the guitar and then try
[2:06:19] to tune the organ off the guitar off the
[2:06:21] piano and then you know the the mandolin
[2:06:24] off of the organ and then the doo off of
[2:06:27] the mandolin I said you be tun in one
[2:06:29] after the other and eventually to get it
[2:06:30] wrong but what you need is you need a
[2:06:32] tuning fork you need one absolute come
[2:06:35] on
[2:06:36] somebody you need one absolute and I'm
[2:06:39] so glad God sent one absolute amen and
[2:06:42] that's real Unity it isn't that we
[2:06:44] always agree on everything and everybody
[2:06:45] agrees but friends I believe that
[2:06:47] Oneness brother Brandon I love how
[2:06:49] brother digs preached that out of the
[2:06:50] message he's quote not a Oneness and
[2:06:53] brother bandham said that that was the
[2:06:54] prayer of Jesus in John 17711 he said
[2:06:58] father this is my prayer that they may
[2:07:01] be one even as I and you are
[2:07:04] one and then the prophet took it further
[2:07:07] than I say well brother Matt it's good
[2:07:08] we're all one with Jesus but we don't
[2:07:10] have to be one with each other brother
[2:07:12] brandham says go further in that prayer
[2:07:14] that they'd be one with each
[2:07:16] other and then the prophet says that's
[2:07:19] the church that Jesus has coming coming
[2:07:21] back for a church one one with another
[2:07:25] and brother bam says and when he comes
[2:07:27] that'll be the the answer to that prayer
[2:07:29] that Jesus prayed how many just desire
[2:07:31] that amen how many desire that say Lord
[2:07:34] I want to be one one with your word one
