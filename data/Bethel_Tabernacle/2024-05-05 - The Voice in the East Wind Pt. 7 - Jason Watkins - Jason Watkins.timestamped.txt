[36:24] chapter
[36:25] 20 I'm sorry chapter 12 chapter 12
[36:32] amen while you're finding your spot I'm
[36:36] sure that you were able to see as you

[36:45] grounds amen we we had a team of
[36:49] Brothers yesterday we were able to do
[36:52] quite a bit move some things around and
[36:55] I tell you friends I was standing out
[36:56] there and I was looking
[36:58] after we'd kind of cleaned everything up
[37:00] and uh where it's the way you see it
[37:02] now and I just realized that that this
[37:07] renovation of the fellowship hall I told
[37:10] sister Debbie I said it's going to be
[37:11] more than you think it is it's more I
[37:14] realize it's more than I think it is
[37:16] brother Steve's renderings not
[37:18] withstanding it's going to be amazing

[37:45] wondering who I'm calling honey on the U
[37:47] internet in case you don't see her amen
[37:49] so that's sister Rachel amen so um you
[37:55] know I I mentioned in my prayer
[37:58] yesterday that uh that it was
[38:02] reminiscent of the time of Nehemiah when
[38:05] he came back to to rebuild there and he
[38:09] had followed Ezra about 13 or so years
[38:12] after Ezra they had started the
[38:14] foundation of the temple and uh when
[38:16] Nehemiah come back he realized there was
[38:18] a lot more work that needed to be done
[38:21] it couldn't just be start a foundation
[38:23] we need to finish this thing and so you
[38:26] know he he he admonished the people and
[38:29] the Bible says that there Came Upon the
[38:32] people a spirit to work like an
[38:35] anointing and every family took their
[38:38] place on the wall if you go back and
[38:39] read the book of Nehemiah it's fantastic
[38:42] Story one of my favorite stories in all
[38:43] the Bible Nehemiah was not even really a
[38:46] preacher he was he was a governor he was
[38:49] a a man who God put his hand on that
[38:52] could get things done amen and the and
[38:56] the Bible says that all the families
[38:58] took their place on the wall all of them
[39:02] even even and then there were a couple
[39:04] of families who uh only had daughters
[39:08] and so they came to Nehemiah and they
[39:10] said hey we get a portion too we don't
[39:12] have sons Nehemiah said get on the wall
[39:15] and those girls got up there uh with Dad
[39:18] and Mom and they had their tools and
[39:20] went to work amen so it's a it's a group
[39:24] family wide effort amen aren't you glad
[39:27] that the Lord recognizes all the family
[39:29] of God and so we wanted to just remind
[39:33] you that going forward we're going to
[39:35] need a lot more help it's going to take
[39:37] that kind of solidarity that we saw
[39:40] yesterday and that kind of Amen we told
[39:42] brother Aaron Simmons that we found out
[39:45] he was smoking and so we I told him that
[39:48] the meat was so
[39:50] good that I was going to give him an
[39:52] Absolution and write an Indulgence that
[39:55] he's free to smoke amen
[39:58] amen till the project is over amen
[40:01] praise the Lord amen so if you have any
[40:03] trouble just tell them I said it was
[40:05] [Laughter]
[40:07] okay amen praise the Lord but he he uh
[40:11] he he he first we were a little bit
[40:12] alarmed because when he got here he said
[40:15] fellas were not going to be able to eat
[40:16] this meat at all we said why not he said
[40:18] as soon as I took it out he said it all
[40:20] fell
[40:21] apart and he wasn't wrong it was really
[40:24] good and we had a wonderful time we're
[40:26] sure grateful to be brother Aaron amen
[40:28] for fixing all that and all the
[40:30] different food that was made amen I ate
[40:33] too much but what's happens at the
[40:35] fellowship Paul stays at the fellowship
[40:38] PA amen and what sister Debbie doesn't
[40:41] actually
[40:43] see won't hurt
[40:46] her amen praise the Lord amen turn
[40:50] around and shake hands with somebody
[40:51] standing near you say God bless you amen
[40:54] praise the Lord
[41:02] so we're we're looking forward to what
[41:05] the Lord will do in coming months we
[41:07] finally actually have our permit in hand
[41:10] we can go forward I think the next stage
[41:13] is probably putting some concrete down
[41:15] out here and that's where the vision
[41:17] really came clear to me when I realized
[41:19] how much concrete is going to be added
[41:21] to the existing foundation so wonderful
[41:25] things lie ahead amen I trust that we
[41:28] won't ever get to finish it the Rapture
[41:29] will come first and amen and then the
[41:32] Antichrist can have it for 42 months
[41:35] we'll be back to claim it and but but as
[41:39] if we're still here we're going to
[41:41] finish it amen praise the Lord Exodus
[41:44] chap
[41:46] 12 this is where we started last
[41:49] week and we're continuing in our series
[41:54] on The Voice in the East Wind and I I
[41:57] don't need to read all of that 12th
[41:59] chapter again that we read last time
[42:02] let's just um they they were T they were
[42:05] commanded to take a lamb and let's begin
[42:09] reading at verse
[42:12] 8 they shall eat the Flesh of it in that
[42:15] night roast with
[42:17] fire and unleavened bread and with
[42:20] bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not
[42:23] of it raw nor Soden at all with water
[42:27] but roast with fire his head with his
[42:30] legs and with the pertinence thereof you
[42:32] shall let nothing of it remain until the
[42:35] morning and that which remaineth of it
[42:36] until the morning you shall burn with
[42:39] fire and thus shall you eat it with your
[42:41] loins girded your shoes on your feet and
[42:43] your staff in your hand and you shall
[42:45] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[42:49] Passover for I will pass through the
[42:51] land of Egypt this night and will Smite
[42:53] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
[42:55] both man and Beast and and against all
[42:57] the gods of
[42:59] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[43:02] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[43:05] token upon the houses where you are and
[43:08] when I see the blood I will pass over
[43:11] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[43:14] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[43:17] Egypt amen let's
[43:20] pray father we're just relaxing oursel
[43:23] once more in your word Lord and we want
[43:26] to to look at these very important
[43:29] things and scriptures as we tie them
[43:31] together as best as we can understand
[43:34] them Lord we have many quotes of the
[43:37] Prophet we're going to display today and
[43:39] Lord It's a little outside of Lord um my
[43:43] wheelhouse to do that normally I
[43:45] wouldn't do that that many at at any
[43:48] rate I have many and we want to go
[43:51] through them Lord but I I I think that
[43:53] it's so important so vital that I dare
[43:56] not not do it and so I commit it now to
[44:00] you that you'll give us understanding
[44:02] hearts and Minds today we commit it into
[44:05] your hands with perfect confidence in
[44:07] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[44:10] you can be
[44:12] [Music]
[44:17] seated a couple of points that I made
[44:20] last time and I want to just uh make a
[44:23] few of those points that we closed with
[44:25] last time this was not a closing point
[44:28] this was actually an opening point that
[44:30] I used last Sunday and I want to
[44:36] reemphasize that where the the verse
[44:38] said that you shall eat it with your
[44:41] loins girded your shoes on your feet and
[44:44] your staff in your hand and it it it
[44:47] sounds like this is something urgent
[44:51] that it has the language of something
[44:52] they're doing quickly and the very next
[44:56] words you
[45:02] shall we think of the implications for
[45:06] us today I'm of the opinion that that
[45:09] the that the that the lamb that we're
[45:12] feasting on today that you ought to not
[45:15] come to the house of God lethargically
[45:19] or whimsically or just because it's a
[45:22] habit I think that it's the Lord's
[45:24] Passover we are to eat it with our shoes
[45:27] ready our staff in our hand eat it in
[45:29] haste we're going somewhere this is
[45:32] important do you under do you read that
[45:35] the same way I read it that this is
[45:37] important this is vital this is critical
[45:40] and this is not something to take
[45:43] lightly this is not something to to say
[45:45] nothing of taking it halfhazard to say
[45:48] nothing even more uh uh of just taking
[45:52] the word of God casually I don't believe
[45:55] that God says anything in his word that
[45:58] we ought to just take
[46:01] casually God is very he he he you
[46:04] realize friends that the Bible says that
[46:07] that he values the word even above his
[46:11] own
[46:13] name now I mean if the whole family in
[46:16] heaven has a name and if the powers of
[46:20] the Kingdom operate by the name and if
[46:23] you're if you're if the only way to gain
[46:27] salvation is through the correct name
[46:30] then I would say name is Paramount amen
[46:33] amen amen so imagine now if you will
[46:37] what does it mean when we find that he
[46:40] actually values the word even higher
[46:43] than that amen so I think that it ought
[46:46] to be a little bit of a of a shock I if
[46:50] if I'm able today you know I I if if
[46:54] you're if you seem to have
[46:57] um a casualness about what the word has
[47:01] called us to in this hour I hope the
[47:04] Lord will throw cold water in your face
[47:06] and or or do something to shock you you
[47:10] know to to get a baby to take in the
[47:12] Breath of Life they give it a good SWAT
[47:14] they get they shake it they Jerk it they
[47:16] do something they they initialize it and
[47:19] so it is it is my prayer as a minister
[47:22] today that even if I have to shock you
[47:25] even if something is stun you then well
[47:28] and good and praise the name of the Lord
[47:30] because we need to get moving this is
[47:34] something we're almost home it's almost
[47:37] over we're coming to a to a crescendo of
[47:41] all the ages and you don't want to be
[47:44] taking that
[47:46] lightly say well why why would you say
[47:49] that people are taking that lightly well
[47:51] sometimes I can just see it in their
[47:53] church discipline and their Church
[47:55] schedule I can see it I can see how
[47:57] casually they take even obeying the word
[48:00] that says come to the house of God the
[48:01] more as you see the day approaching my I
[48:05] can only conclude they don't see the day
[48:06] approaching so all the more reason I
[48:09] need to shock you and say you can't stay
[48:11] here this world is burning down it's on
[48:14] fire now and and maybe you the Holy
[48:16] Spirit needs to shake you and say hey
[48:19] pay attention things are happening
[48:23] quickly and the and the world the bride
[48:25] is going to go
[48:29] suddenly even when Jesus that the
[48:32] prophecy concerning him was the one whom
[48:34] you seek shall suddenly come to his
[48:37] Temple and when he did almost all of
[48:41] Israel just nonchalantly a weighed it
[48:44] and thought about it and considered it
[48:45] and just moved
[48:47] on but there were a few who said is not
[48:50] this the Messiah is not this the one
[48:53] that we've looked for all this time I'm
[48:55] here to tell you something friends I I
[48:57] it's it's not the fault of the holy
[49:00] spirit that modern Christianity just
[49:04] sees uh Christianity as just a casual
[49:07] religion it's not that it's the power of
[49:10] God under salvation that's what the
[49:12] gospel is
[49:14] for we find that the world has lost its
[49:20] identity and that's pulpits are
[49:22] responsible for that because they
[49:25] stopped preaching the true identity of
[49:27] Christ in his word and every and things
[49:30] have become just Theory and just you
[49:33] know Theology and I'm here to tell you
[49:36] something friends the word of God is Not
[49:39] has never been and will never be
[49:42] theology it's not
[49:45] data in this data age it's not data the
[49:49] word of God I is is a person the word of
[49:54] God is Christ Christ was his word see
[49:57] and so when you're feeding on the word
[50:00] of God you need to realize this is the
[50:03] most vital thing that you can do and so
[50:07] you you you come to the presence of the
[50:09] Lord whether it's in prayer in your
[50:10] prayer Closet in your morning devotion
[50:12] time or in the house of God or before
[50:15] you back out of your driveway or before
[50:17] you step out on a job site I hope you're
[50:19] calling on the Lord to watch over you
[50:21] and keep you safe and help your family
[50:24] and bless you in your efforts that's
[50:26] it's important friends you have not
[50:28] because you ask
[50:29] not I learned a long time ago if I need
[50:32] something ask the
[50:33] Lord you can't believe how many things I
[50:36] get that other people don't CU they
[50:37] don't
[50:39] ask and I and I don't ask to to consume
[50:42] it upon my lust I ask because I need it
[50:46] I say Lord I need your presence in my
[50:48] life today I need sharp spiritual vision
[50:51] I need Zeal in my heart I need a I need
[50:54] a a a a desire in my heart for more of
[50:59] Christ nothing casual about
[51:03] it you know we we said last time how
[51:07] that we had arrived at a critical
[51:10] Tipping Point these were some of the
[51:12] very comments I I made last time and
[51:18] um this this is actually a transcript of
[51:21] the words I have a friend of mine in in
[51:23] Canada and years ago he started
[51:25] transcribing all my sermons and he sends
[51:27] them to me and it's he says does it help
[51:30] you I said is that's an understatement I
[51:31] said especially if I'm in a lengthy
[51:33] series and I'm not sure what I said have
[51:35] I already covered this do I need to say
[51:37] it again you know because I I preached
[51:40] all the time I'm either on the internet
[51:42] preaching I'm in a pull pit here or pull
[51:44] pit somewhere preaching and I say
[51:45] everything and I go wow did I even say
[51:47] that here and it was really important I
[51:48] need to say it here so I can go back and
[51:50] look amen and say oh no I haven't said
[51:52] that so here it
[51:55] comes but I but uh he and so especially
[51:58] in series preaching it's so helpful to
[52:00] me and I'm grateful to brother uh Mark
[52:02] coffee for it and he says um so I had
[52:07] said to you last time some of the very
[52:08] last statements is that we had reached a
[52:11] Tipping Point for
[52:13] Humanity and that there has been a sea
[52:16] change there has been something that has
[52:18] transpired that's not
[52:20] small it's not little it's not casual
[52:23] I'm here to tell you something friend
[52:25] says brother Jason that fantastic Sunday
[52:27] school sermon this morning lesson this
[52:29] morning and lining up you know it's it's
[52:32] something that we have to constantly do
[52:35] we can't just keep going back and
[52:37] identifying modern events of 1965 those
[52:40] aren't even modern events anymore and a
[52:43] prophet identified them and correlated
[52:44] them to prophecy and it excited the
[52:46] bride well this is 2024 and we still
[52:49] need to clarify modern events in
[52:52] Prophecy so that you know where you're
[52:55] standing so that you know where God is
[52:57] you've got to see his movements don't
[52:59] get caught not seeing his
[53:01] movements don't get caught in laziness
[53:04] and and you know and unconcerned because
[53:08] as we said the bride is going to leave
[53:10] here
[53:11] rapidly on that morning the Bible
[53:13] describes it that in a moment in the
[53:16] twinkling of an eye in a moment friends
[53:19] think of it the dead in Christ shall
[53:21] rise and then we which are alive and
[53:22] Reign shall be changed that's not
[53:24] something that's going to take a lot of
[53:26] time that's going to go around the world
[53:28] and one of these mornings you're going
[53:29] to brother bam said you're going to turn
[53:31] around and there'll be that loved one
[53:33] that's been gone on for years he said
[53:35] you'll feel a little something like a
[53:37] pain go through your body he said that's
[53:39] the last pain you will ever
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:46] feel amen so the Holy Spirit you know is
[53:50] uh is impressing his Prophet you know to
[53:55] to to bring out this end time danger
[53:58] that you must have the token on display
[54:01] because that's the identity of his
[54:03] family that's how the death angel
[54:06] identified God's family because it
[54:08] didn't say as we pointed out several
[54:11] Services ago it didn't say that the
[54:14] death angel would come through and
[54:16] strike all the
[54:17] Egyptians it said it would strike all
[54:20] the land of
[54:21] Egypt everybody that was in it who
[54:24] didn't have the token on display be they
[54:26] Hebrew or
[54:28] Egyptian amen so it's not you know I I'm
[54:32] in the message or I go to message church
[54:34] or my parents were in the prophets
[54:35] meetings that's not it there's no
[54:37] salvation for me because my mother was
[54:39] set in the prophet's meetings you know
[54:42] there there's no there's not brother
[54:44] brandham takes Jesus coming out of the
[54:46] Tomb in in the Rising Sun and he says
[54:49] that was great for him but what good
[54:51] does that do
[54:52] me unless I Rise with him
[54:57] see so don't get caught sleeping you see
[55:01] this is a this is an hour to be to
[55:03] really be checking and asking the Lord
[55:05] to help you to be marching to the step
[55:08] of the Gospel remember that the even the
[55:11] bride gets out of Step she has that
[55:13] weakness that tendency that let me just
[55:15] say and and here's the thing if you'll
[55:18] remember when brother brandham showed
[55:20] and he had the vision of the preview of
[55:22] the bride and he said what caused those
[55:27] those elected
[55:28] girls true Daughters of the Kingdom at
[55:31] the end of the line meaning it's us yeah
[55:34] the last ones coming through and he said
[55:37] what caused them to get now they didn't
[55:39] backslide they just got out of
[55:42] Step they just it just their life wasn't
[55:44] keeping up their Revelation wasn't
[55:47] matching the Holy Spirit and the Rhythm
[55:50] got messed up and he said what caused
[55:53] that is they were watching that other
[55:55] group yeah that fancy church that was
[56:00] being led by a witch and dancing to rock
[56:02] and roll and they went off you see it's
[56:05] not it's not just that they were
[56:06] admiring them because he said all the
[56:08] screaming as they went off and plunged
[56:10] into the abyss and I'm here to tell you
[56:13] something friends don't even get
[56:14] distracted by the judgments you see
[56:17] going and happening to the world the
[56:19] Lord will watch out for you just commit
[56:21] your life just get closer just snuggle
[56:24] up that much closer to the Lord
[56:28] amen amen yes sir amen so so we find
[56:34] then that that he he was warning his
[56:38] prophet in this day to take and he
[56:40] preached it four different times on the
[56:43] token and we've been ministering on The
[56:45] Voice in the East Wind and I I I have
[56:49] have said to you so many times about
[56:51] Pharaoh after after seven different um
[56:55] things had come to pass
[56:56] you would have thought that he would
[56:58] have heard the judgments coming in the
[57:00] East Wind cuz Moses had said here comes
[57:03] a judgment and then here come the East
[57:05] Wind and you would have think he would
[57:07] have went wow this has went this has hit
[57:09] seven out of seven times I better make
[57:11] some preparation he didn't amen he
[57:15] ignored it and in the
[57:18] morning on the wind came the Locust and
[57:21] then it was too
[57:22] late and so once Moses pronounced that
[57:26] plague by morning's light we said to you
[57:28] last time it was too late for Pharaoh
[57:31] because the morning brought the Locust
[57:33] on the Wind by morning it was too late
[57:35] for Egypt and uh you know and and and I
[57:39] I was just cautioning you that it's
[57:42] blowing hard we've it's been blowing for
[57:45] a while excuse me get this thing
[57:48] adjusted right it's been blowing for a
[57:50] while and it's ramping up and I'm I want
[57:54] you to understand that it's not going to
[57:58] get
[58:00] better the madness that you see in the
[58:03] world is not going to improve and it
[58:06] doesn't matter who they elect for
[58:08] president and it doesn't matter what the
[58:11] FED does with our monetary system it
[58:14] doesn't matter uh you know if this
[58:17] pontiff goes and they put another one it
[58:18] doesn't matter who wins what war uh
[58:22] across Europe it doesn't
[58:24] matter the only thing that that matters
[58:26] is Christ is getting ready to come for
[58:28] his bride and the world has slipped into
[58:32] complete Madness as a prophet said it
[58:34] would it would go totally insane it has
[58:37] and it's getting he said it must get
[58:39] worse it there'll be no peace till Jesus
[58:41] comes I'm glad he's coming I'm glad he's
[58:44] going to set up a new kingdom I'm glad
[58:46] that there's going to be a new king to
[58:48] rule the
[58:50] world do you hear the spirit calling you
[58:54] today that was what I was closing with
[58:56] last time do you hear the voice in the
[58:59] East Wind do you hear Do you hear here's
[59:01] a good question I asked you last time I
[59:03] want to this is the the basis that I
[59:05] need to launch with because of what
[59:07] we're about to look at do you hear the
[59:12] father's voice in the message of the
[59:15] hour I'm not talking about do you have
[59:17] physical ears that can hear a man
[59:19] preaching from 60 years ago and it's on
[59:21] a tape and now it's digital and we're
[59:23] gonna we can play it or we can read it
[59:24] it's not what I'm talking about I when I
[59:27] read the Bible I'm not reading a man
[59:30] named Paul sitting in a prison writing
[59:33] words that's not that's not how I look
[59:36] at it when I read his words I'm not
[59:38] hearing the words of Paul I'm hearing
[59:40] the words of the
[59:43] father do you hear the words of the
[59:46] father in the message of this hour
[59:49] because I can tell you that's where he's
[59:51] speaking
[59:56] that's where he's
[59:58] speaking and the so so when I say to you
[1:00:02] today pay Keen attention to this fact
[1:00:06] that the
[1:00:07] father not a man who's been gone 60
[1:00:10] years the Father of
[1:00:14] Lights from which every good thing comes
[1:00:16] down amen the one in whom is no Shadow
[1:00:20] no variableness no shadow of turning the
[1:00:23] one who's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:26] forever the one who appeared who talked
[1:00:29] with with Adam in the garden the one who
[1:00:31] talked with
[1:00:32] Abraham the one who came down into the
[1:00:35] water to John the one who came to Paul
[1:00:37] on the road to
[1:00:39] Damascus that one that one the one who
[1:00:43] said to Peter don't call unclean what
[1:00:45] I've called clean the one who John saw
[1:00:48] High Isaiah saw him high lifted up John
[1:00:51] confirmed it he was Seated on a throne
[1:00:54] that one that's the one who is now
[1:00:57] saying to you you must have the token on
[1:01:04] display it's your only way to escape it
[1:01:09] can't just be what they had in the ages
[1:01:12] and even
[1:01:14] if even
[1:01:17] if even if you have a faith in Christ
[1:01:21] speaking now we're not talking about a
[1:01:22] revealed Faith that's the new birth
[1:01:24] understand amen brother Brandon wasn't
[1:01:26] saying the new birth isn't isn't a
[1:01:28] revealed Faith he's talking about just a
[1:01:30] human Faith even if you have made a
[1:01:34] human choice and a human decision and
[1:01:36] spoke human words from a human faith in
[1:01:39] a human Jesus Christ from 2,000 years
[1:01:42] ago that e and and and there's a certain
[1:01:45] amount of Covenant that comes with that
[1:01:47] but that even if you have a faith a
[1:01:50] mental faith in Christ that faith is
[1:01:54] annulled and by itself will not and
[1:01:57] cannot take you in the Rapture what can
[1:02:00] take you on the rap in the Rapture is
[1:02:02] when you have the life of the
[1:02:06] speaker in you living out through you on
[1:02:11] display the reason that this is lost is
[1:02:14] because an understanding of who Christ
[1:02:16] was as a man and as God Is Lost and that
[1:02:21] that's that was attacked in the very
[1:02:23] first age and so that's that's
[1:02:26] where the message
[1:02:28] Begins the message of the hour comes
[1:02:32] because at the end of the Philadelphian
[1:02:34] age as the last age
[1:02:37] dawned he set an Open Door which was a
[1:02:40] revelation of Christ and he opened that
[1:02:43] door and what would it do it would begin
[1:02:46] the restoration of the deity of Jesus
[1:02:48] Christ to show that he's not a second or
[1:02:51] third person he's the person see and and
[1:02:55] and and that would that would just keep
[1:02:57] unfolding and unfolding until finally
[1:03:00] the lamb would would take the book open
[1:03:03] the seals and descend himself in a
[1:03:06] revelation of his person to a bride to a
[1:03:09] prophet who would then give it to a
[1:03:11] bride that's the scripture hallu and she
[1:03:14] would eat it and in eating it she would
[1:03:16] assimilate it and she would become it so
[1:03:19] when you become the word that's the
[1:03:21] token on display because that guides
[1:03:23] your life and informs your thinking
[1:03:25] makes your choices it governs your
[1:03:28] actions and your reactions brother Bram
[1:03:30] talks about how you might speak in
[1:03:32] tongues you might
[1:03:33] not we might hear the sound of a rushing
[1:03:37] wind today we might not did you know
[1:03:40] that in all of brother bram's Ministry
[1:03:42] he only ever had that experience one
[1:03:45] time that I can find in his entire
[1:03:46] Ministry and he's in a meeting and he
[1:03:48] tells just like on the day of Pentecost
[1:03:50] he said we heard a rushing wind and it's
[1:03:51] on tape you can hear
[1:03:53] it and brother brandham said that's the
[1:03:55] first and only time that's ever happened
[1:03:57] just like it happened on the day of
[1:03:59] Pentecost so it's not necessary that
[1:04:01] every time we gather that we hear a
[1:04:03] rushing Mighty win it's not necessary
[1:04:05] that you speak in tongues every time you
[1:04:07] come before God or that you or that you
[1:04:09] have any kind of sensation or any kind
[1:04:12] of uh any kind of display that Satan
[1:04:14] could possibly impersonate brother Bram
[1:04:17] says you might do those things and you
[1:04:18] might not but one thing for sure you
[1:04:21] will do you will come subject to every
[1:04:24] word and your life will say Amen to the
[1:04:27] revealed word that's the evidence of a
[1:04:30] new
[1:04:32] birth say well why does it got to be
[1:04:34] that way cuz that's what Jesus did
[1:04:37] that's how he came that's what he did
[1:04:40] that's how he lived and he said because
[1:04:43] I Live Now you can live also the way I
[1:04:46] lived you can live say oh well he had
[1:04:49] all kinds of great power but in the
[1:04:50] wilderness he didn't use it he could
[1:04:53] have used it against the devil the devil
[1:04:55] said turn these Stones you're hungry he
[1:04:57] was turn these stones into bread he
[1:04:59] wouldn't do it he refused he could have
[1:05:02] used his great power he had all power he
[1:05:05] had he had demonstrated his power when
[1:05:06] he came up to a fig tree that bore no
[1:05:10] figs and he destroyed it with a
[1:05:12] word see so he he he used his power when
[1:05:18] he came walking on the water defying the
[1:05:20] laws of
[1:05:22] physics he used his power when he
[1:05:25] extended it to Peter and said come on
[1:05:28] and Peter stepped out and then Peter is
[1:05:30] breaking the laws of physics until he
[1:05:32] took his eyes off of the word just like
[1:05:35] that little girl at the end of the line
[1:05:37] took her eyes and started watching the
[1:05:39] wrong thing don't watch the wrong thing
[1:05:41] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus commit your
[1:05:44] whole life to looking into his word and
[1:05:46] knowing his person
[1:05:49] am but in the wilderness he didn't use
[1:05:51] his great power because Prophet said he
[1:05:54] wanted to show to his children church
[1:05:56] that they could defeat the Devil also
[1:05:59] the way he did by the
[1:06:01] word and that's why the word and the
[1:06:04] word alone not a denominational word
[1:06:07] that's too limited that'll never move
[1:06:10] the devil but but when you have the
[1:06:12] Living Word then you're not it's not
[1:06:14] just memory verse it's not a School of
[1:06:17] Theology it's not that you're quoting
[1:06:20] even quotes of the Prophet that Satan is
[1:06:22] so not afraid of that he doesn't care
[1:06:25] how religious you are and he doesn't
[1:06:27] even care how right you are in your
[1:06:29] Doctrine what he fears is you'll get the
[1:06:32] life that the life will be on display
[1:06:34] and that's what he has to back down to
[1:06:37] not correct
[1:06:39] Doctrine he probably understands the
[1:06:42] doctrine correctly as good as you do he
[1:06:45] knows the will of God but he refuses to
[1:06:47] obey it listen the Bible says he's wiser
[1:06:49] than
[1:06:50] Daniel he ain't no
[1:06:52] joke when the Lord built him an enemy he
[1:06:55] didn't build 90 lb weak uh weakling he
[1:06:58] build an enemy that has equal to him in
[1:07:00] power in everything except creation he
[1:07:03] doesn't have the creative word you which
[1:07:06] means that he can't speak you into him
[1:07:09] you can take a creative word and resist
[1:07:11] him and so powerful is it that even
[1:07:14] though you're born in sin and belong to
[1:07:16] him the creative word can make you a new
[1:07:19] creation in Christ
[1:07:22] jesusall and you will be legit a child
[1:07:25] of God
[1:07:26] that every devil will howl and faint
[1:07:28] when you come walking down the road
[1:07:30] there's
[1:07:31] value in having the token on
[1:07:34] display I won't if I don't get going I'm
[1:07:37] not going to get very far again but it's
[1:07:40] okay so so we realize then that you have
[1:07:44] to have it on display all right let me
[1:07:48] let me power up and get going
[1:07:51] here all right that says part six that
[1:07:53] was last week that today was actually
[1:07:55] part seven and we're the identification
[1:07:57] of Christ in our lives and we were in
[1:08:00] the final plague part two because the
[1:08:02] final plague is death all right let's go
[1:08:05] all the way
[1:08:07] down uh I think to yeah there's where we
[1:08:10] finished what an hour we're living in oh
[1:08:13] what an hour what an hour friend you say
[1:08:14] Amen to that amen what an hour that we
[1:08:19] are living in let me get all my ducks in
[1:08:21] a row
[1:08:23] here all right so
[1:08:26] he says here the blood displayed over
[1:08:30] the
[1:08:30] door identified the believer because the
[1:08:35] innocent life had gone out of the lamb
[1:08:37] but could not come back on the believer
[1:08:40] so he had to have a display of chemistry
[1:08:43] he had to have like a paint a blood of
[1:08:45] chemistry that showed that life went
[1:08:47] from him now the just in case you've
[1:08:50] missed the the previous the point
[1:08:54] brother brandham is making
[1:08:56] is that people say oh the blood of Jesus
[1:08:59] the blood of Jesus and they don't even
[1:09:01] know what they're saying no one has the
[1:09:03] blood of
[1:09:04] Jesus the blood of Jesus was a chemistry
[1:09:07] that ran down the cross that's true and
[1:09:09] it fell on the earth and claimed the
[1:09:10] Earth that's correct it had its water
[1:09:13] baptism under Noah it got it had its
[1:09:15] sanctification experience under the
[1:09:17] blood of Christ coming down upon it you
[1:09:20] understand but but no one has that blood
[1:09:25] but
[1:09:26] it was not the the blood not the
[1:09:28] chemistry this was in the Old Testament
[1:09:31] they didn't have the ability like you
[1:09:33] have to get the Life In The Blood amen
[1:09:35] see that's what came back on the church
[1:09:38] God didn't pour blood said receive you
[1:09:40] the Holy Ghost meaning potentially of
[1:09:41] course the lamb hadn't died they
[1:09:43] couldn't receive the new birth just yet
[1:09:45] but it was a prophetic uh uh thing that
[1:09:47] he was doing just like when he came in
[1:09:50] the Garden of Eden and he Adam had had a
[1:09:53] form a theophonic form but God formed
[1:09:55] him a body Out of the Dust of the earth
[1:09:58] and the Bible says he breathed into him
[1:10:01] the breath of life amen so the it's the
[1:10:04] it's the the word of God that we have is
[1:10:07] the breathed word that's why it has life
[1:10:10] in it that's why when you take this word
[1:10:12] into your heart and you put Faith in it
[1:10:14] it's the same as deity
[1:10:16] speaking see so your voice doesn't
[1:10:20] travel without breath all right so all
[1:10:23] right so he says here this is back in
[1:10:26] the Old Testament they're leaving Egypt
[1:10:28] and he's making the point that you can't
[1:10:31] just claim the blood
[1:10:35] because I'm just going to say to you
[1:10:37] what does that even mean you don't got
[1:10:39] the
[1:10:40] blood oh I'm covered by the blood
[1:10:43] where where's the blood I'm I'm I'm kept
[1:10:47] by the blood okay how does what does
[1:10:49] that look like how does that
[1:10:51] work see so it's not just chemistry amen
[1:10:55] back here they had a chemistry but he's
[1:10:58] saying no more than the life of the
[1:11:01] innocent lamb could it could not come
[1:11:03] back on the believer see the life of the
[1:11:06] innocent lamb couldn't transfer to the
[1:11:08] believer making him white as snow make
[1:11:11] could not give anyone the Innocence the
[1:11:13] lamb had cuz his life wasn't
[1:11:15] transferable to a human see and so God
[1:11:19] had had the only holy life but God
[1:11:23] couldn't just transfer it into a human
[1:11:26] unless God came down and became a
[1:11:28] human and then as a human he suffered
[1:11:31] the penalty of his own law and he and
[1:11:34] that body hung on a tree you understand
[1:11:36] and blood ran down but then he came up
[1:11:39] out of a tomb and he ascended on high
[1:11:43] and he gave gifts unto men and he sent
[1:11:45] back his life and now the blood of the
[1:11:48] the Lamb of God can come back on the
[1:11:51] believer and make her see but that's got
[1:11:54] to drop down into here by a revelation
[1:11:56] it's got to make an 18-inch plunge down
[1:11:58] to your heart and it's got to and that's
[1:12:00] got to strike a gene of God in you and
[1:12:02] bring that thing to
[1:12:04] life see all right so so he goes
[1:12:09] on says now the Holy Spirit itself is
[1:12:13] the token not the physical blood of
[1:12:15] Jesus the blood of Jesus was shed at
[1:12:17] Calvary that is true but the blood as
[1:12:20] far as it is went back into the elements
[1:12:23] from which it came from the food that
[1:12:25] his human body lived on but you see
[1:12:29] inside that original created blood cell
[1:12:32] that began his body was a life of God
[1:12:36] that started the blood cell to moving
[1:12:38] the chemistry had no life in it itself
[1:12:42] and therefore it could not move now I I
[1:12:45] would just if you want to understand
[1:12:47] that in simpler terms if you die and you
[1:12:51] fall on this floor we could walk up to
[1:12:54] you all day long and say brother sister
[1:12:56] get up and get get go back to your seat
[1:12:58] blood is still inside
[1:13:01] you but there's no life in your blood so
[1:13:05] blood and of itself has to have the
[1:13:08] spirit of Life inside it you get that
[1:13:11] all right so he goes on but when the
[1:13:16] life of God came into the chemistry of
[1:13:18] his blood it formed a cell now brother
[1:13:21] brandham is describing here he's going
[1:13:23] to break it down how that Jesus was a a
[1:13:27] human being but he was also almighty God
[1:13:31] he was a it's a
[1:13:32] paradox in the form that he walked the
[1:13:35] shores of Galilee and we' never seen a
[1:13:37] human like that nor do we nor do will we
[1:13:40] ever have another human like that again
[1:13:42] because that he dieth he dieth no more
[1:13:44] and and the apostles said there was a
[1:13:46] time when we knew him after the flesh
[1:13:48] but henceforth we know him no longer
[1:13:50] like that because he died but he raised
[1:13:54] and he has Ed and he sent his life back
[1:13:56] and now we know him by the power of his
[1:13:59] resurrection see all
[1:14:02] right so he said so he says here let me
[1:14:06] read it again when the
[1:14:08] life of God came into the into the
[1:14:10] chemistry of his body it formed a cell
[1:14:12] it Formed its own cell then cell after
[1:14:15] cell then it became a man and that man
[1:14:18] was God Emanuel in flesh isn't that easy
[1:14:22] I love a prophet's simple way of
[1:14:23] explaining things that that flesh see
[1:14:27] then it became a man and that man was
[1:14:29] Emmanuel in flesh but when that life
[1:14:33] returned back the chemistry went back to
[1:14:35] the Earth elements but the token is the
[1:14:38] Holy Ghost upon the church that they see
[1:14:42] Christ all right so the so the token
[1:14:45] then I got to go slow I'm teaching all
[1:14:47] right so the token is not actually the
[1:14:51] physical chemistry of Jesus's blood but
[1:14:55] it's the life that moved through the
[1:14:58] chemistry of his blood amen he had human
[1:15:01] blood the physical
[1:15:04] chemistry of the blood of
[1:15:07] Jesus now I've spent a lot of time on
[1:15:10] this wording because wording is so
[1:15:11] important to me so pay close attention
[1:15:14] to how I say it the physical chemistry
[1:15:18] this is based on what brother bam is
[1:15:19] teaching us not only here but in all
[1:15:21] four sermons of the token right you're
[1:15:23] best to go hear them yeah all right so
[1:15:26] the physical chemistry of the blood of
[1:15:29] Jesus was human species blood the
[1:15:34] physical chemistry though it was not
[1:15:37] merely human species blood exactly like
[1:15:41] we have you understand and the reason
[1:15:44] for that is is because the first cell of
[1:15:47] it was a spoken word creation that's not
[1:15:49] how you came you came because an egg was
[1:15:53] fertilized and that produced produced a
[1:15:55] living life into a cell see and so from
[1:15:59] there it went through the natural
[1:16:00] birthing process and that cell
[1:16:02] multiplied into other cells build a
[1:16:04] spine pushed out arms pushed out legs
[1:16:06] amen and after a while you were born see
[1:16:09] it's a miracle brother Bram said the
[1:16:11] Virgin birth is easy to understand he
[1:16:13] said the natural birth is far more
[1:16:14] mysterious than the Virgin birth he said
[1:16:17] because the Virgin birth that's just God
[1:16:19] God can do anything he said but how does
[1:16:21] a a man and a woman come together and
[1:16:24] through through through the betting
[1:16:25] ground of of of human relations produce
[1:16:28] another human being that's alive as they
[1:16:30] are with its own individual personality
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:33] soul
[1:16:34] see all right so let's move a little
[1:16:38] further all right so here here I've I've
[1:16:41] quoted this to you I've even displayed
[1:16:43] it but I want to show it again today
[1:16:45] because I'm saying to you that his blood
[1:16:48] though it was human species blood was
[1:16:50] not merely human species blood exactly
[1:16:53] like we have here he is in 1965 lean not
[1:16:56] to th own understanding speaking of
[1:16:58] Jesus wasn't exactly like Solomon now
[1:17:01] the reason don't read the reason he was
[1:17:03] comparing to Solomon was because Solomon
[1:17:05] was a son of David and that's what Jesus
[1:17:06] was the son of David all right so he's
[1:17:09] going back to compare but he wasn't
[1:17:11] exactly like Solomon in so much that
[1:17:13] Solomon was a man born of a woman and
[1:17:16] begotten by an Earthly Father David but
[1:17:20] Jesus here's a paradox this is this
[1:17:22] makes him unique but Jesus Jesus was a
[1:17:25] virgin born son and now he's a human a
[1:17:29] virgin born human see but was not allog
[1:17:33] together a man but he was God the God
[1:17:36] man and he was more than a man he was a
[1:17:40] man plus but Solomon was just a man like
[1:17:44] you and
[1:17:45] I all right you got it so all right now
[1:17:49] I'm going to make some more statements I
[1:17:51] got your
[1:17:53] attention so the Spirit of God's
[1:17:56] life moving through human blood his
[1:18:01] human blood it made him
[1:18:04] more or I would say a further form
[1:18:09] beyond God just living as a spirit
[1:18:14] amen you got
[1:18:16] that it made God living in the form of a
[1:18:23] man am a human being now born of a woman
[1:18:29] to take the penalty of death in human
[1:18:32] flesh which was necessary amen this was
[1:18:35] the mystery of Jesus see he was he was
[1:18:38] not exactly like mzc though MDC was
[1:18:41] close because mzc was a spoken word
[1:18:42] creation also God spoke a body and
[1:18:44] stepped into it and went to talk to
[1:18:46] Abraham but but mzc couldn't die for
[1:18:49] your sins cuz he hadn't come through
[1:18:52] birth Jesus was the only begotten of the
[1:18:56] father see so the human blood that
[1:19:00] flowed through his veins which a prophet
[1:19:03] shows us which began as a single blood
[1:19:06] cell
[1:19:08] created by the spoken word of God but
[1:19:12] after his human Spirit of Life had left
[1:19:17] his body on the
[1:19:19] cross
[1:19:21] see after he was dead after his human
[1:19:25] life had left his body the Roman
[1:19:29] spear pierced that original blood
[1:19:34] cell that was a spoken word of God Amen
[1:19:38] and that released the life of God to
[1:19:42] come back on the believer you see the
[1:19:44] Paradox his human Spirit had already
[1:19:46] departed he was
[1:19:48] dead the Bible says they were going to
[1:19:51] break his legs they found out he's
[1:19:52] already dead but then but David had
[1:19:55] prophesied they pierce my side so the
[1:19:57] Roman doesn't even understand the
[1:19:59] soldier doesn't understand he falls
[1:20:01] under an inspiration to keep God's word
[1:20:04] and he pierces his side and that pierced
[1:20:07] that original blood cell and that
[1:20:09] released the life of God that released
[1:20:12] the bride as it were because you were
[1:20:14] contained in that life and that's the
[1:20:17] life that comes back on the believer so
[1:20:20] the life that's coming on you to give
[1:20:22] you a new birth is the life you had
[1:20:24] before the foundation of the world it
[1:20:26] was in God it was in
[1:20:31] Christ
[1:20:33] see so once God by his creative
[1:20:37] word had created both the seed and the
[1:20:40] egg in Mary's womb brother Brandon was
[1:20:42] about the only one who taught that they
[1:20:44] all said he was wrong but he wasn't he
[1:20:47] created both seed and egg in Mary's womb
[1:20:51] then nature just took it from there
[1:20:56] and the body of Jesus was constructed
[1:20:59] like any other human
[1:21:01] birth see there's no mystery in that he
[1:21:04] was a man but yet he was more than not
[1:21:07] exactly a man cuz he was a man plus he
[1:21:10] was the god man but I'm just a man see
[1:21:14] Solomon was just a man all right so we
[1:21:18] find that blood cells were multiplied
[1:21:21] and the body was formed and it pushed
[1:21:24] out arms brother Ram says that right on
[1:21:25] tape it pushed out arms it pushed out
[1:21:27] legs etc etc so a body which be which
[1:21:33] had its origin in the spoken word of God
[1:21:36] this is producing a body that had its
[1:21:39] origin in the spoken word of God
[1:21:42] beginning with a single blood cell by
[1:21:46] the creative spoken word of God human
[1:21:49] blood developed that carried within it
[1:21:53] the life of God's literal
[1:21:59] person not choking you am I this is
[1:22:02] necessary that you understand who Christ
[1:22:06] was and his relationship to the father
[1:22:08] this is how you understand what the
[1:22:09] token is because it's that life that's
[1:22:11] got to come back on you
[1:22:14] see not his chemistry not the blood that
[1:22:17] ran down the cross you ain't got that
[1:22:19] nobody does nobody kept it but even the
[1:22:23] disciples didn't run up and so let's
[1:22:24] collect
[1:22:25] it see and so so we we we realize then I
[1:22:30] want to make this statement again
[1:22:31] beginning with a single blood cell by
[1:22:32] the creative spoken word of God human
[1:22:35] blood developed and carried within it
[1:22:37] the life of God's literal person born as
[1:22:41] an infant baby he grew from there into a
[1:22:45] man making him from his very first day
[1:22:49] of life on the earth more than just an
[1:22:53] ordinary
[1:22:55] human it made him man plus it made him
[1:23:00] the God
[1:23:02] man the Bible uniquely describes him as
[1:23:08] the only begotten of the father being
[1:23:12] born of a woman through the paradoxical
[1:23:17] Miracle we call the Virgin
[1:23:21] birth amen
[1:23:24] this was a form of human being never
[1:23:27] before seen exactly MDC was close see
[1:23:32] but this this was a form of a human
[1:23:34] being that had never before been seen
[1:23:38] exactly
[1:23:39] God God now comes on the
[1:23:43] scene and he through the beding ground
[1:23:47] of a of a woman he brings into a human
[1:23:50] body as I've said before a for form of a
[1:23:54] man that would never need to be again in
[1:23:59] that limited form you say what Jesus in
[1:24:02] a limited form of
[1:24:05] course
[1:24:06] remember God never intended to stay
[1:24:11] bottled up in one human walking the
[1:24:14] shores of Galilee that was not going to
[1:24:17] build a kingdom the whole purpose was to
[1:24:20] God to come in that form a form you
[1:24:22] could never come in and satisfy the
[1:24:25] penalty of death and take death upon
[1:24:27] himself raise his own self up out of the
[1:24:30] Grave nobody did it for him and if that
[1:24:33] same spirit that raised Jesus from the
[1:24:35] grave dwell in you it shall also Quicken
[1:24:38] your mortal
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:43] bodyl so in this form a unique
[1:24:47] individual that had never been and would
[1:24:50] not be needed again Jesus moved on he
[1:24:54] moved on to the form of being
[1:25:00] glorified after his death and his
[1:25:04] burial right amen he resurrected in a
[1:25:08] glorified body the body that went to the
[1:25:12] Grave could be killed and was the body
[1:25:16] he rose in could not be killed the body
[1:25:20] he went to the grave in aged got sick
[1:25:23] and died
[1:25:24] the body that he rose in is immune from
[1:25:27] all of
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:29] that understand so he resurrected in the
[1:25:32] glorified body and that's the form that
[1:25:35] every son and daughter of God will come
[1:25:37] to in the end he doesn't need you to be
[1:25:40] a human and go to Calvary you you're you
[1:25:43] become a new creation in Christ and if
[1:25:45] you live and Believe on him you shall
[1:25:47] never die this body might lay down in a
[1:25:50] grave that's a that's a completely
[1:25:52] irrelevant point but it'll but when the
[1:25:55] trumpet sounds Prophet said he'll know
[1:25:57] it's me and my my elements will come
[1:26:00] back
[1:26:01] together see now brother brandham
[1:26:04] teaches us that and who is this MDC when
[1:26:07] Abraham met him he was mesc he unfolds
[1:26:10] here see cuz why why why mzc because mzc
[1:26:15] was in a spoken word body you understand
[1:26:19] he met he met him he was MDC he unfolds
[1:26:23] here what all the attributes will do in
[1:26:26] the Final End every son of Abraham every
[1:26:30] son of faith will absolutely do the same
[1:26:34] thing but I want you to watch how we
[1:26:36] have to come see he he he came he came
[1:26:41] from thought right into body you bypass
[1:26:44] that brother brandom said you bypassed
[1:26:46] that and so you're born in sin so he
[1:26:48] could redeem you and be a
[1:26:50] redeemer
[1:26:52] Hallelujah you say oh I'm glad He's My
[1:26:54] Redeemer I'm glad he's my
[1:26:57] father I'm redeemed because he's my dad
[1:27:00] I'm redeemed because I was part of him
[1:27:04] I'm not Redeemed by an accident I don't
[1:27:06] not a Believer by an accident I can't
[1:27:08] not believe his word because I came from
[1:27:12] his
[1:27:13] word and it found me no matter how hard
[1:27:16] I was running and I'm here to tell you
[1:27:18] friends I don't care how hard you're
[1:27:19] running today he knows where you're at
[1:27:21] and he will find you and I would advise
[1:27:23] you today just to throw up your hands
[1:27:25] and surrender right now cuz the Holy
[1:27:27] Ghost always gets his man or his woman
[1:27:30] and sometimes it can be a rough road to
[1:27:32] Ho so Just Surrender
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:36] today
[1:27:38] see so this is the Prototype that we are
[1:27:41] headed to Jesus rose as a prototype of
[1:27:45] the whole coming Kingdom we will have a
[1:27:48] body according to the scripture likened
[1:27:50] unto his glorified body not a body not a
[1:27:55] body merely formed and brought through a
[1:27:59] physical Union between a man and a woman
[1:28:02] we'll live in a body formed by the
[1:28:04] creative word of
[1:28:08] God
[1:28:10] right he goes
[1:28:14] on I'm running out of time again that's
[1:28:17] perfectly all
[1:28:18] right I already know I got two more
[1:28:20] parts so if we make three more four more
[1:28:23] five more brother Mark coffee just get
[1:28:25] ready to keep transcribing
[1:28:28] brother the token for the believer
[1:28:31] today friends do you see why that
[1:28:34] brother brandham would say to those
[1:28:39] theologians he said you believing that
[1:28:43] God is three persons he said Satan has
[1:28:46] told you that to make an idolator out of
[1:28:51] you you don't even understand the
[1:28:54] godhead you don't even understand the
[1:28:55] relationship between the Jesus as a as a
[1:28:59] human but not merely a human you don't
[1:29:01] understand how all of that worked and
[1:29:03] and it all goes back the whole reason
[1:29:05] that that works like I just explained it
[1:29:07] is because we understand what happened
[1:29:09] in the Garden of Eden we understand what
[1:29:12] broke
[1:29:13] everything so now Christ is coming back
[1:29:15] to fix
[1:29:17] it when when you know when someone asks
[1:29:20] you oh I don't know about that whole
[1:29:21] serpent seed thing just say Well then
[1:29:23] why did Jesus have to be virgin born
[1:29:26] what's the
[1:29:27] point why do you have to why do you have
[1:29:29] to come by a virgin why do you have to
[1:29:31] be a human at all see so so so he goes
[1:29:36] he goes on
[1:29:37] watch the token for the believer today
[1:29:42] is the Holy Ghost not a blood a
[1:29:43] chemistry but it's the holy spirit of
[1:29:46] God that is the token that God requires
[1:29:49] of the church today God must see this
[1:29:57] token he must see it in every one of
[1:30:01] us he must see
[1:30:05] it he must see it say but he already
[1:30:10] knows I have it he must see
[1:30:13] it I'll I'll assure you the death angel
[1:30:15] knew who had Lamb's blood but he had to
[1:30:19] see it on
[1:30:21] display then you know then what is
[1:30:25] in what what it that means that what is
[1:30:29] in you say I have the new birth well the
[1:30:32] fact that he has to see it means that
[1:30:34] what is in you is showing as something
[1:30:38] on
[1:30:39] you you understand they had the blood in
[1:30:42] the house but it had to be on the door
[1:30:45] on the outside so whatever you claim is
[1:30:49] in you it's got to be showing on you
[1:30:56] see so he goes
[1:30:58] on
[1:31:00] therefore as the evening Shadows are
[1:31:03] appearing and the Wrath is ready to be
[1:31:06] poured out from on high upon the ungodly
[1:31:09] Nations and upon the ungodly Believers
[1:31:12] upon the professors without a
[1:31:15] possession professing with no
[1:31:20] possession God is requiring a token that
[1:31:25] you yourself have received his token the
[1:31:30] Holy
[1:31:31] Ghost it's the only way everybody say
[1:31:34] the only way only way do you hear the
[1:31:36] voice of the father in the message it's
[1:31:39] the only way and the only sign that God
[1:31:44] will ever pass because it is the literal
[1:31:48] life of Jesus Christ returned back into
[1:31:52] the believer
[1:31:54] amen he goes
[1:31:56] on now is the token time that each house
[1:32:01] must be covered by the token each house
[1:32:04] of God must be covered by the token all
[1:32:09] that's inside of it must be covered by
[1:32:12] the token that's just simply saying it's
[1:32:14] got to be on display everywhere in your
[1:32:16] life in your home your activities your
[1:32:18] plans your dreams that your whole life
[1:32:21] that you you live breathe look and act
[1:32:25] and are a real Christian
[1:32:29] amen not a professor without being a
[1:32:33] possessor because the world is
[1:32:37] overrun by
[1:32:40] that amen the world is
[1:32:44] overrun by people who profess but don't
[1:32:48] possess and their life is a
[1:32:51] demonstration of it
[1:32:54] see so all that's inside of it must be
[1:32:57] covered by the token and the house of
[1:32:59] God is the body of Jesus Christ and by
[1:33:03] one Spirit we're all baptized into this
[1:33:06] token and become a part of it so these
[1:33:11] phrases
[1:33:12] then
[1:33:14] indicate that the individual just just
[1:33:18] like the the just like the house of the
[1:33:21] Lord right see we are we are called as
[1:33:25] individuals remember that the scripture
[1:33:28] says and I don't think I have it uh on
[1:33:30] the slides I do not but that's okay um I
[1:33:35] actually
[1:33:36] do know you not that ye are the temple
[1:33:40] of God and that the spirit of God
[1:33:43] dwelleth in you that your body is the
[1:33:47] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:33:49] which you have of God and ye are not
[1:33:53] your own
[1:33:55] how is it that people decide to live
[1:33:57] outside of the bounds of Sanctified
[1:33:59] Holiness and still claim that they are
[1:34:02] owned by
[1:34:04] Christ I'm sorry it doesn't work like
[1:34:08] that when he has ownership of you in
[1:34:11] your life you will say Amen to every
[1:34:14] word now you will stumble and you will
[1:34:16] make mistakes but you will never be
[1:34:18] satisfied to have that as a lifestyle
[1:34:21] and you'll constantly be repented and
[1:34:24] asking God to help you be an
[1:34:26] overcomer see because your nature he
[1:34:29] that's born of God hath no more
[1:34:31] conscious of sin the desires of the
[1:34:34] world are gone from him the body still
[1:34:37] has all kinds of temptable fallacies and
[1:34:39] problems and we still have to repent
[1:34:42] daily but I Repent daily cuz I don't
[1:34:45] want to be uh in a fallen condition my
[1:34:49] desires for that are
[1:34:51] gone see and that's that can only happen
[1:34:54] so by so by one Spirit brother brandham
[1:34:57] says here we're all baptized into this
[1:35:00] token and become part of it that God
[1:35:03] said when I see the token displayed I'll
[1:35:06] pass over you what an hour that we're
[1:35:10] living all right I'm going to
[1:35:14] read
[1:35:16] uh a bunch of quotes from
[1:35:19] 1954 I'm going to go through them I'm
[1:35:22] going to comment almost none at all I
[1:35:25] just want
[1:35:26] to give you this and then we'll close
[1:35:29] out you all right you got another five
[1:35:32] or 10
[1:35:33] minutes all right so brother brandham is
[1:35:36] all the way back in
[1:35:38] 1954 he's preaching a series of
[1:35:41] questions and answers and this is his
[1:35:43] second
[1:35:45] installment he says now we're fixing to
[1:35:48] take communion just in a moment and I
[1:35:51] want this to really sink into you the
[1:35:53] thing of it is what is in your heart
[1:35:56] will produce make your life what kind of
[1:35:59] a seed you put in the ground will
[1:36:01] produce after its
[1:36:03] kind you might take a gysum weed seed
[1:36:07] and an onion seed and they look so
[1:36:09] perfectly likee till the very best of
[1:36:12] man couldn't tell them apart that's
[1:36:14] right the only thing you have to do is
[1:36:16] plant them they both look alike natural
[1:36:19] but plant them they both will produce
[1:36:22] and one will be a gemson weed and the
[1:36:24] other one will be an
[1:36:26] onion so he's making the point that
[1:36:29] people can say I'm a Christian but what
[1:36:32] does their life produce because every
[1:36:36] seed brings forth after its
[1:36:42] kind and a and a man or a
[1:36:46] woman that professes to be a Christian
[1:36:49] and don't live that kind of Life by the
[1:36:52] grace of God is a gems some weed by
[1:36:55] their fruits you shall know them if that
[1:36:58] thing's in your heart Bears record of
[1:37:00] what you are somewhere else listen to
[1:37:02] this if it's evil it Bears record that
[1:37:05] you're down here when you die you'll
[1:37:07] just have to go to where you are
[1:37:10] already if you're good because God has
[1:37:13] made you good see now this is a
[1:37:15] revelation then you're born again and
[1:37:18] you're bound to go that way because that
[1:37:20] life will have to bear record with this
[1:37:22] place if it Bears record of here that
[1:37:26] there's where you go if it Bears record
[1:37:28] up
[1:37:30] there there's where you
[1:37:33] go I love a simple
[1:37:36] Prophet isn't that beautiful there's
[1:37:40] where you
[1:37:42] go what you are here get this in your
[1:37:45] mind now I'm going to close so am I
[1:37:48] right here but what you are here is a
[1:37:52] sign that you are something else
[1:37:56] somewhere you've always wanted to be in
[1:37:59] Perfection you Christians
[1:38:02] Hallelujah there is a
[1:38:05] Perfection and that Perfection is not in
[1:38:08] this life there's one coming where I
[1:38:09] will be perfect I've always wanted to be
[1:38:14] Hallelujah I've always say why do you
[1:38:17] want to be holy there's just something
[1:38:19] in me I hate unholiness I love Holiness
[1:38:22] I love clean
[1:38:25] I'm going somewhere where there's
[1:38:29] cleanness Hallelujah I lo my weaknesses
[1:38:32] I hope you loathe your weaknesses I want
[1:38:35] to be
[1:38:37] perfect I don't care about being rich I
[1:38:40] don't care about having friends and
[1:38:42] likes I want to be
[1:38:48] perfect but every man and woman here
[1:38:51] that's a Christian every person that is
[1:38:53] a Christian here now is already
[1:38:56] glorified in the presence of Jesus
[1:38:58] Christ and you've got another body you
[1:39:00] won't have some other time you have
[1:39:02] right now right now there's another body
[1:39:05] waiting for you if this one should
[1:39:07] perish
[1:39:08] amen you say well brother brandham my
[1:39:12] church teaches that we must accept Jesus
[1:39:14] Christ our personal savior if we believe
[1:39:17] on the Lord Jesus Christ we are saved if
[1:39:20] your life doesn't compare with that you
[1:39:24] haven't made it
[1:39:30] yet fine they're not wrong in that
[1:39:33] teaching brother brandom is just adding
[1:39:35] an addendum that's fine you believe that
[1:39:38] but if your life doesn't compare with
[1:39:39] that then you haven't made it
[1:39:42] yet let me help you today if your life
[1:39:45] doesn't compare with the word of God you
[1:39:47] haven't made it yet I'm not insulting
[1:39:49] you I'm helping
[1:39:50] you repent give your heart to the Lord
[1:39:54] for real become a Believer let the let
[1:39:58] the supernatural life of God come down
[1:40:00] like a rushing Mighty Wind into your
[1:40:03] life and fill all the
[1:40:05] house that you
[1:40:10] are oh my I'm almost got it
[1:40:15] here do you know the devil believes that
[1:40:18] Jesus Christ is the Son of God do you
[1:40:21] know the devil publicly confess Jesus to
[1:40:24] be the Son of God that's
[1:40:26] scripture and he wasn't saved and he
[1:40:30] couldn't be saved he's the devil so
[1:40:33] confessing Jesus to be the Son of God
[1:40:37] see do you know all those Pharisees and
[1:40:40] Sadducees everyone was very Pious and
[1:40:43] religious people how they loved god with
[1:40:46] their hearts they thought and failed to
[1:40:49] see that innocent one the Son of God to
[1:40:52] recognize him to be the Son of God and
[1:40:54] yet they were very
[1:40:57] religious is that right very Pious very
[1:41:01] scholarly know the Bible better than any
[1:41:04] other Scholars today amen finally now
[1:41:09] look what the scripture says in the last
[1:41:12] days to you my Christian friend with
[1:41:16] Godly love this is it if I never see you
[1:41:20] again you remember my last words I'm
[1:41:22] reading to you a proph it now look what
[1:41:25] the scripture says in the last days to
[1:41:28] you my Christian friends how many
[1:41:30] Christian friends I got here to you with
[1:41:32] Godly love the Bible said in the last
[1:41:36] days men would come a time where men
[1:41:40] would be heady high-minded lovers of
[1:41:42] pleasure more than lovers of God that's
[1:41:45] the age you live in don't get duped by
[1:41:50] that teenagers don't believe the Tommy
[1:41:54] rot nonsense that tries to tell you this
[1:41:56] message is false there's nothing but
[1:41:59] this message that can give you this kind
[1:42:01] of clarity and give you this kind of
[1:42:03] righteousness and give you this kind of
[1:42:05] Desire down inside your soul there's
[1:42:08] nothing else to compare to it you look
[1:42:12] up and look around at what's out there
[1:42:14] you'll see it right away people who
[1:42:16] attack it have no message to take you to
[1:42:19] so don't leave the one you
[1:42:21] got believe it
[1:42:23] absorb it assimilate it feed on it eat
[1:42:26] upon it you become it it's Christ trying
[1:42:30] to live inside of
[1:42:34] people and it's the power of God unto
[1:42:38] Salvation let's stand amen praise the
[1:42:41] Lord come brother Ken with your team
[1:42:44] amen it is the power of God unto
[1:42:48] salvation I'm not ashamed of
[1:42:51] it it's the power of God to Salvation I
[1:42:54] love it with my whole heart my whole
[1:42:57] mind and my all my soul amen do you love
[1:43:01] him
[1:43:03] friends my my my I hardly know what to
[1:43:07] sing brother Kenny you can sing whatever
[1:43:09] you feels on your heart I'll leave that
[1:43:10] with you amen do you love the Lord
[1:43:13] friends bow your heads with me across
[1:43:16] the
[1:43:18] building father as the musicians come
[1:43:22] around for their worship and singing
[1:43:26] after the as a prophet said now after
[1:43:28] the word is gone forth that's the time
[1:43:30] to really Worship the Lord because now
[1:43:33] Lord I have spent the better part of an
[1:43:34] hour casting out Devils amen that's what
[1:43:38] preaching does it cast out Devils it
[1:43:40] drives the prophet said it drives back
[1:43:42] the spirits of unbelief from people
[1:43:45] pushes them out the back door so that
[1:43:47] the Holy Spirit can deal with
[1:43:49] hearts now Lord the warning in the Bible
[1:43:52] is that when we come into the presence
[1:43:55] of God the word is like a
[1:43:57] mirror and it shows us who we really are
[1:44:00] it shows us to us we see it ourselves we
[1:44:04] see our shortcomings we see our faults
[1:44:06] and our failures we know now for sure
[1:44:08] that we have them there's no getting
[1:44:10] away getting away from
[1:44:12] it Lord the the the beauty is that this
[1:44:15] is what this is how you do it so that
[1:44:18] people can then repent cuz you can't get
[1:44:20] a man to repent unless you can show him
[1:44:22] he's wrong
[1:44:24] you can't get him saved unless you can
[1:44:25] prove to him he's lost so the gospel
[1:44:28] comes to prove to us Lord we know good
[1:44:31] and well here in your presence that
[1:44:33] there's nothing good that we can offer
[1:44:35] you nothing in my arms I bring simply to
[1:44:38] thy cross I
[1:44:40] cling Lord the danger becomes the Bible
[1:44:43] says that when we go out cuz those evil
[1:44:47] spirits are just waiting outside and
[1:44:49] when we go out of here we tend to forget
[1:44:51] the very kind of man or woman and that
[1:44:53] the word showed us we really were and
[1:44:56] therefore we just go right back to our
[1:44:58] old lifestyle and the word seems to have
[1:45:00] no effect on
[1:45:02] us don't let that happen today Father
[1:45:06] I'm preaching to people who I love with
[1:45:08] my whole heart people who you've loved
[1:45:10] and died for I don't think you have
[1:45:12] anything left to do to prove how much
[1:45:14] you love them all they have to do Lord
[1:45:17] if there's anyone here today any young
[1:45:19] person or old person single or married
[1:45:23] who has never really allowed the Holy
[1:45:27] Spirit to come in and be the Lord not
[1:45:30] just living not just they understand
[1:45:32] correct Doctrine and they live in
[1:45:34] varying degrees of a Sanctified life I
[1:45:37] know what I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:45:38] about where they really have allowed the
[1:45:41] Holy Ghost to come in and become the
[1:45:44] Lord of their entire
[1:45:47] life so that everything they do think
[1:45:50] and say is governed by another life
[1:45:54] that's beyond their own life and Lord
[1:45:58] that's the life that'll live on when
[1:46:00] this life this human life is over what I
[1:46:03] am for Christ is the only thing that
[1:46:05] will remain so I commit it to you today
[1:46:08] Lord I feel satisfied I feel that I that
[1:46:12] you're satisfied that I could stop where
[1:46:14] I stop there's much more to be said and
[1:46:17] we'll get to it Lord if there's time if
[1:46:19] we have life if you don't come in the
[1:46:21] morning if you're not here by next week
[1:46:23] we'll carry right on the Lord being
[1:46:26] willing father help us today help people
[1:46:30] they've heard enough Lord they've heard
[1:46:31] enough that you would be if you never
[1:46:34] spoke to them again they'd be
[1:46:36] accountable with what they've heard
[1:46:37] today so I commit it to you Lord in the
[1:46:40] name of Jesus Christ I commit this whole
[1:46:42] audience both visible and invisible
[1:46:45] those who are hearing it now live
[1:46:47] streaming those who are hearing it on an
[1:46:49] archive Lord may they just and if
[1:46:52] there's those who do know you in that
[1:46:54] way may they have a moment of
[1:46:55] rededication and say Lord I see it even
[1:46:58] more clearly today and I'm even more
[1:47:00] purposed in my heart to be like you Lord
[1:47:03] I raise up both my hands and I ask for
[1:47:05] that oh God grant that to me in all my
[1:47:07] life in all my activities and everything
