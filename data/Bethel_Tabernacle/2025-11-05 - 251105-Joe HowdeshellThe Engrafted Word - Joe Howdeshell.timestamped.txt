[6:00] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Amen.
[6:03] Brother Luther, if you come. [music]
[6:05] Amen. Let's open this service. Amen. In
[6:09] prayer, man. Brother, just pray over the
[6:10] offering also as you come. Amen.
[6:16] God bless you, buddy.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love the Lord.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Man, so we're going to couple of re
[6:24] reminders about church [music] order. Um
[6:28] had some discussions.
[6:30] So, um, like the cell phones, uh, unless
[6:34] you're part of, uh, the working [music]
[6:36] functions of the church sound booth or
[6:38] something,
[6:40] you should have your cell phones turned
[6:43] off. Now, before I became a deacon, I'm
[6:45] just going [music] to relax and talk.
[6:49] Um, I never brought my phone into the
[6:51] church to begin with, just because I had
[6:53] no need of it and I didn't want any
[6:55] [music] distractions.
[6:56] Um, so if you're texting somebody or if
[6:59] you're doing [music] something on eBay
[7:00] while you're in church, you're going to
[7:03] grieve the Holy Spirit, right?
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, [music] another thing we've
[7:08] all been taught, Brother Brandham said,
[7:10] that chewing gum in the sanctuary
[7:14] grieves the angel of the Lord. Um,
[7:16] [music] so
[7:19] if I was you, I would not come into the
[7:21] church chewing gum. Okay? whether you
[7:24] might hinder it for yourself or you may
[7:26] hinder it [music] for somebody else.
[7:28] [crying]
[7:28] Um, and we all get absent- minded. I'm
[7:32] not, you [music] know, um, if your heart
[7:34] is in the right place, you know, when
[7:36] you come in and I say something, I'm not
[7:38] I'm just I'm actually for your [music]
[7:40] good and for the good of everybody. So,
[7:42] uh, chewing gum is not allowed in the
[7:44] sanctuary.
[7:46] Okay. Um, now we have a nursery back
[7:49] there and we have a lot of lovely little
[7:51] babies
[7:53] and [music] we want to um, Brother
[7:56] Brandon was pretty clear on his church
[7:57] doctrine and church order. You know, if
[8:00] your baby's getting fussy and stuff like
[8:02] that, I'm not just going to say it
[8:04] tonight. I'm going to say it also on
[8:05] Wednesday. [music]
[8:07] Um, that's what the nursery is for. And
[8:09] the nursery
[8:12] and babies. And there may be instances
[8:14] where [music] grandma has to help or
[8:17] something, but toddlers and stuff like
[8:19] that don't need [music] to be going
[8:20] there playing. And church order needs to
[8:23] be maintained in the nursery also. It's
[8:25] not a place where okay, so the kids can
[8:27] go play. You have to mind your kids
[8:30] while they're in there, too. Um, another
[8:33] thing [music] is sometimes when people
[8:35] get out in front like it's 10 minutes to
[8:37] church time and stuff and they want to
[8:38] gather at the front door out in front of
[8:40] the sanctuary, out in front of the
[8:42] church. If you're talking loud and
[8:44] stuff, it comes right inside the church.
[8:47] You got people in here that are reading
[8:49] their Bible, praying. We're trying to
[8:51] make it a place to where the Holy Spirit
[8:53] will be comfortable. So, if you want to
[8:56] visit, don't visit by the front door of
[8:58] the [music] church. You can visit over
[9:00] there, over there. If it's 10 minutes,
[9:01] still church time, you should be in here
[9:03] anyhow. [music]
[9:05] Brother Brandham said a half an hour,
[9:07] but we're not we're not getting legal
[9:08] with it, but it's [music] we want to
[9:10] make this a place where the angel of the
[9:12] Lord and God is comfortable to [music]
[9:14] come. We want to rise higher. Okay?
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get things get common with
[9:20] us. We talk a little bit. You know how
[9:22] brother Brandham said, you know, you
[9:24] know, you shouldn't be playing around or
[9:26] [music] fiddling around in church. You
[9:28] want to say God bless you. That's fine.
[9:30] But you sit down, read your Bible or
[9:32] pray. [music]
[9:33] That was what the prophet of the age
[9:36] talked about the church [music] before
[9:38] service. Um I love you. I didn't I heard
[9:42] a few amens and that's good. And I hope
[9:44] you all say an amen from your heart. Um
[9:48] we do want to make it a place where God
[9:50] is very pleased to come. Amen. Let's
[9:53] pray. Father, we thank you for your
[9:55] grace this evening, Lord. We love you.
[9:57] We worship you and Father, we just come
[10:00] together. Lord, we come that you would
[10:02] come and be pleased with us. May our
[10:04] worship be in spirit and in truth this
[10:06] evening. Father, do not hold our
[10:09] iniquities against us. You said,
[10:10] "Blessed is the man to whom you [music]
[10:13] would not count iniquity, Father." And
[10:15] Lord, your bride comes in that category.
[10:18] We pray you forgive us for our
[10:19] shortcomings.
[10:21] And Lord, we lift you up this evening.
[10:23] We are expecting great things, a [music]
[10:24] wonderful time of fellowship in your
[10:26] word, of feeding that you would feed us
[10:29] and give us strength. [music] Father,
[10:31] Lord, we love you and worship you. As we
[10:33] collect the ties and offers, I pray that
[10:35] you bless the cheerful [music] giver.
[10:37] Lord, I don't want to forget the sick
[10:39] and the needy, those that are streaming
[10:40] that couldn't be here. Lord, I pray that
[10:43] you would bless them. Father, in Jesus
[10:45] [music] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] How many come ready to
[10:53] have church?
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord another.
[10:58] Amen. [music]

[25:58] Against
[26:00] a [singing and music] mountain
[26:04] there were three trees.
[26:10] There was [music] a good man.
[26:16] There were [music]
[26:18] two thieves.
[26:21] A man [singing] called
[26:24] Barabus
[26:27] was doomed
[26:29] [music] for the tree.
[26:33] But Jesus took
[26:36] the middle one [music] and Barabus
[26:41] went away.
[26:45] [music]
[26:47] And I love
[26:50] that man [music]
[26:53] in the middle
[26:57] [music]
[26:59] because I know

[27:06] me.
[27:12] Praise [music]
[27:14] to the one
[27:17] [music] who died on Mount Calvary.
[27:23] The middleman
[27:25] [music] made it possible
[27:28] that I [music] could go
[27:38] a [music and singing] hill called
[27:41] Gol Gotha
[27:44] the [music] place
[27:46] of the snow.
[27:48] [music]
[27:49] No yellow flowers, [singing]
[27:52] no trees in blue. [music]
[27:55] The scenery
[27:58] so [singing]
[28:01] three crosses stood
[28:04] black and bold [music]
[28:07] against
[28:09] a darkened sky.
[28:13] And not from pain, [music]
[28:15] but a broken heart
[28:18] that [singing] little
[28:21] man [music] died.
[28:27] And I love
[28:29] that [music] man
[28:32] in the middle
[28:38] because [music] I know
[28:41] he first
[28:43] [music] loved me.
[28:51] Praise
[28:53] to the one
[28:56] who [music] died on Mount Calvary.
[29:02] The middle man [music]
[29:04] made it possible
[29:07] that I could go.
[29:14] [music]
[29:16] And I love
[29:19] that man
[29:21] in [music] the middle
[29:26] because I [singing] know [music]
[29:30] he first
[29:32] loved me.
[29:35] [music]
[29:39] Praise
[29:40] to the one
[29:44] [music] who died on [singing] Mount
[29:47] Calvary.
[29:50] The little man
[29:52] made it possible
[29:55] that I [music] could go free.
[30:01] [music]
[30:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:09] [applause]
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you stand with me? Amen.
[30:18] Amen.
[30:21] Amen. We're going to get our brother.
[30:22] Amen. Brother out of shell tonight, this
[30:26] evening. Amen. Precious brother. Amen. I
[30:29] hope he gives us a few selections.
[30:33] Amen. Let's just sing a little bit of
[30:34] more of you. I believe I have B flat or
[30:37] C. I'm not sure which one.
[30:43] More of you.
[30:49] More of you.
[30:54] [music]
[30:56] I've had it all, [singing]
[31:00] but what I need
[31:04] is more of you.
[31:08] [music]
[31:11] Of things
[31:13] I've had, my fear,
[31:17] [music]
[31:18] but yet
[31:20] I hunger [music] still.
[31:26] empty and bare.
[31:30] Lord, hear [music] my prayer
[31:33] for more of you.
[31:39] Oh, more of you.
[31:46] Oh, more of you.
[31:53] [music]
[31:55] I've had it all, [singing]
[31:58] but what I need is more of you.
[32:05] [music]
[32:09] of things. I've had my fear,
[32:15] but yet I hunger
[32:19] still.
[32:23] Empty and
[32:26] Lord, [music] hear my
[32:30] whole of [singing and music] you.
[32:47] You see?
[33:15] Okay, I'll just do a hand.
[33:24] Got me tethered here.
[33:37] Praise the Lord.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Is it good?
[33:43] [snorts]
[33:44] &gt;&gt; When is he good?
[33:46] &gt;&gt; All the time. Amen. We're going to try
[33:48] one here.
[33:54] Is that on?
[33:57] Lord, you made my heart
[34:01] a garden filled with flowers.
[34:09] The green grass
[34:12] is like a carpet
[34:16] kissed by the morning
[34:19] dew.
[34:25] You bless the seeds
[34:29] of love I've sown.
[34:32] Warm my heart so they can grow. Lord,
[34:37] [music] shelter me in your arms, Lord,
[34:43] while the ragees [music]
[34:46] may blow.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Walk through the garden
[34:54] of my [music] heart.
[34:57] Calm the storms, Lord. [music]
[35:03] Lest the pretty roses
[35:07] fail to bloom again.
[35:11] [music]
[35:15] Make your rageing [music]
[35:17] winds
[35:19] a gentle breeze.
[35:22] Let me feel your sunshine [singing]
[35:26] [music] please. Lord walk
[35:30] through the garden [singing]
[35:32] [music] of my heart.
[35:38] [music]
[35:41] I can bring [singing] water to
[35:46] the roses. [music]
[35:51] I can [music] plant
[35:54] seeds of kindness
[35:58] so the bitter weeds don't grow. [music]
[36:07] [music]
[36:08] But I can't cause
[36:11] the rainfall
[36:13] [music]
[36:14] on a dry thirsty soul. And I [music]
[36:20] can't
[36:22] calm the storms, [singing] Lord, or the
[36:25] rageing winds that blow.
[36:32] Walk through [music] the garden
[36:36] of my heart.
[36:39] Calm the storms, [music]
[36:42] Lord.
[36:46] Lest the rose
[36:49] fail to bloom again. [music]
[36:57] [music]
[37:02] Gentle breeze,
[37:05] [music]
[37:05] let me feel your sunshine. [singing]
[37:10] Please, Lord, walk
[37:13] through the garden [singing]
[37:15] of my [music]
[37:17] heart.
[37:20] Walk through [music]
[37:22] the [singing] garden
[37:24] of my heart. [music]
[37:28] Calm the storms, Lord.
[37:33] Less the pretty [music]
[37:35] [singing] roses
[37:38] fail to bloom again. [music]
[37:45] Make [singing] your wageing
[37:48] wind
[37:50] gentle [music and singing]
[37:50] breeze.
[37:53] Let me feel your sunshine [music]
[37:57] please. Lord, walk
[38:01] through your garden
[38:03] [music] of my heart.
[38:09] Make [music] your rageing wind a gentle
[38:14] [singing] breeze.
[38:17] Let [music] me feel your sunshine.
[38:21] Please don't walk
[38:24] through the garden [singing]
[38:26] [music] of my heart.
[38:34] [applause]
[38:35] &gt;&gt; How many would like to hear brother Joe
[38:37] and Sister Becky sing another one?
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Are y'all in any hurry?
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Don't you love having Brother Joe and
[38:43] Sister Becky here with us? Give them
[38:44] [music] another big hand clap.
[38:45] [applause] Amen.
[38:47] Can I make a request, Brother Joe?
[38:49] [music] Can I make a request? Welcome
[38:51] home. Will you sing that?
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Could you try that? Amen. Let's let's
[38:56] have just a a minute of that. Just have
[38:58] that come upon my heart.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; You don't sing it with me, though.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, well,
[39:04] &gt;&gt; she could sing a third one. Do you sing
[39:05] the third one?
[39:06] &gt;&gt; No, we don't.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll just sing that one.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[39:17] &gt;&gt; There's a day [music and singing] just
[39:19] out in front of us. I know surely come.
[39:25] [music]
[39:26] Oh, that [singing]
[39:27] eastern sky will open wide, revealing
[39:32] [music and singing] God's dear son.
[39:35] And I know from here to heaven
[39:39] is but the twinkling [music and singing]
[39:41] of an eye.
[39:44] In the midst of all his [singing] glory
[39:48] [music] comes the sweetest cry.
[39:55] Welcome [singing] home.
[39:58] I knew you'd [music]
[39:59] come.
[40:03] Welcome [music and singing] home.
[40:06] You're here for good.
[40:11] Look [music] around.
[40:15] Was it worth the wait? [music]
[40:20] Welcome home
[40:22] [music]
[40:23] to step through the gate.
[40:28] I believe at least for me
[40:33] I'll see [music] my mom [singing]
[40:35] and dad. Oh my brothers and my sisters
[40:41] everywhere [music] we look are friends.
[40:46] And the meetings [singing] will be
[40:48] precious.
[40:50] Those we've known [music] so dear.
[40:54] And no mortal
[40:57] ever
[40:59] likes of 20 [music] years.
[41:04] Welcome home.
[41:08] [music] I knew you'd come.
[41:12] Welcome [music] home.
[41:16] You're here for good.
[41:19] [music]
[41:21] Look around.
[41:24] Was it worth the wait?
[41:26] [music and singing]
[41:29] Welcome home.
[41:32] Step through [music] the gate.
[41:38] I know that when we get there,
[41:42] not supposed to cry.
[41:46] Oh, but I can't help but wonder.
[41:50] There'll be tears [music]
[41:51] in our eyes
[41:54] when we finally see our loved ones
[41:59] haven't seen [music]
[42:00] in years.
[42:02] And the Savior takes his nail [music]
[42:05] scarred hand, wipes away [singing] the
[42:09] tears,
[42:12] and says, "Welcome home.
[42:16] I knew you'd come.
[42:21] Welcome home. [singing]
[42:25] You're here for good.
[42:29] Look all around.
[42:33] Was it worth the wait?
[42:38] Welcome home.
[42:41] Step through the gate.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; [music]
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Welcome home.
[42:50] I knew you'd come. [singing]
[42:52] [music]
[42:54] Welcome home.
[42:58] You're here for good.
[43:01] [music]
[43:02] Look around.
[43:06] Was it worth [singing] the wait?
[43:11] [music] Welcome home.
[43:14] Step through the gate.
[43:18] Oh, look around. [music]
[43:23] What's worth the wait.
[43:27] Welcome home. [music]
[43:33] Step through the gate.
[43:37] [music]
[43:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[43:49] &gt;&gt; It'll all be worth it then, won't it?
[43:57] &gt;&gt; They're having a little trouble out of
[43:58] this headset here, but that's all right.
[44:03] I tell you what, the devil just didn't
[44:04] want us to come. We had every kind of
[44:07] trouble you could think of. It seemed
[44:08] like I got a I was off today, but then I
[44:11] got a gas leak I had to go on. And then
[44:12] that kind of threw us a little bit late
[44:14] and then we hit traffic and we didn't
[44:16] know how late we were going to be. I
[44:18] told brother Matt, I said, "We'll get
[44:20] here sometime or another." And uh but we
[44:22] made it. I'm so glad. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; And now the headset's messed up, but I
[44:27] don't hardly ever use it anyway. Most
[44:29] time I use a pull pit mic, but we'll
[44:31] just try this handheld mic tonight. But
[44:33] it's good to be here. I see a lot of
[44:35] faces I know. A few of them I don't
[44:37] know, but God bless you. I'm Joe Howell.
[44:39] We uh pastor a church up in Byron,
[44:42] Georgia. And uh I've been pastoring
[44:45] there for about two years now. And used
[44:47] to be Jack Palmer's Assembly. And uh I
[44:50] see brother Brad back there. Are you
[44:52] motioning, Brother Brad? What are you
[44:53] motioning for? Oh, you just scratching
[44:55] your ear.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, I can do that. So, is it working
[44:59] now?
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. I don't have to
[45:01] hold this up.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; You got it now. All right. If you have
[45:05] your Bibles, why don't we stand and
[45:06] we'll read in the book of
[45:10] James.
[45:17] It's good you back there, brother. God
[45:19] bless you. Amen.
[45:22] Been a been a while since I've saw
[45:23] Brother Smith.
[45:26] Been a while since I've seen you, too,
[45:27] brother Tony, for that matter.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good to see you. You know, he's
[45:32] one of God's ministers, too.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Think we got another brother here, don't
[45:36] we, brother? Uh, who's the other brother
[45:38] that's a police officer?
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. There you go. I was I see
[45:44] you back there now.
[45:46] Read. If you don't believe they're God's
[45:48] ministers, read Romans the 13th chapter.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; They are absolutely ministers of God.
[45:52] Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Now, James the first chapter. We'll get
[45:58] straight to the word. Let's see. We got
[46:00] 10 minutes till 8. So, we don't want to
[46:02] hold you too long. I don't know about
[46:04] you, but that time change has just about
[46:05] put a whooping on me.
[46:08] It's feels like it's already close to
[46:10] nine. So, I know how you're feeling. So,
[46:13] all right.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; James chapter 1, we're going to start
[46:17] with verse 20. Verse 20.
[46:24] For the wrath of man workketh not the
[46:26] righteousness of God.
[46:28] Wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[46:32] and supuruity.
[46:35] I don't I've never heard of that before
[46:37] except for the Bible. And I had to look
[46:39] it up. And it means overflowing.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; An overflowing of naughtiness. Boy, we
[46:45] could say we see that today, don't we?
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Supurity of naughtiness or overflowing.
[46:51] And receive with meekness the engrafted
[46:54] word which is able to save your souls.
[46:58] Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we
[47:01] approach your word this evening, we just
[47:04] pray, Lord, that you would bless it,
[47:07] Lord. Just close my mouth, Lord, to any
[47:10] thought that I might have, dear Father,
[47:12] that's contrary to your word. And God, I
[47:14] pray that this precious word, Lord,
[47:16] would fall on the ears, oh God, tonight
[47:19] of your precious people, Lord, and they
[47:21] can receive it, Lord. It'd be a help to
[47:23] them. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You
[47:26] can be seated.
[47:29] So that was kind of a I was reading that
[47:31] the other night. Uh and I have read that
[47:35] scripture. Many of us read in James uh
[47:38] the first chapter how it says that uh
[47:41] you know if you sin and then uh when
[47:44] every man's tempted when he's drawn away
[47:46] of his own lust and and enticed and then
[47:48] lust when conceived bringeth forth sin
[47:50] and then sin death. And then if you read
[47:52] on down, it's it's almost
[47:55] uh of course we know about the var God.
[47:58] There's no variableness in him or shadow
[48:00] of turning.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; I had one fell say that he was talking
[48:03] about God as being like a ying yang, a
[48:05] little bit of good, like black and white
[48:08] and there's a little bit of evil in God
[48:09] and a little bit of good in the devil. I
[48:11] said, "Buddy, you come too late to tell
[48:12] me that
[48:13] &gt;&gt; because the Bible tells me there is in
[48:15] him is no shadow at all." Amen.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; He's the father of light. So now I read
[48:22] that and it was uh it kind of struck me
[48:25] about that word called the engrafted
[48:28] word. I've never really thought about
[48:29] that, but it led me to turn to the book
[48:33] of Romans. If you would turn to the book
[48:36] of Romans, it's just back a couple books
[48:39] there just after the book of Acts. If
[48:42] you're not that familiar with it, find
[48:44] the book of Acts and you'll find the
[48:45] book of Romans just after that. Romans
[48:47] the 11th chapter. And then we'll read
[48:52] starting with
[48:54] the 13th verse.
[48:59] For I speak to you Gentiles in as much
[49:02] as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I
[49:05] magnify mine office.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; If by any means I may provoke to
[49:11] emulation them which are my flesh and
[49:15] might save some of them. Now some of you
[49:17] might say, "What is he saying there?
[49:20] He's saying that what he wants to do is
[49:22] is is cause the Jewish people
[49:26] &gt;&gt; to emulate.
[49:29] What emulate means? Means to act like,
[49:31] right?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; That I might provoke to emulation them
[49:35] which are my flesh. Who's he speaking
[49:36] of? The Jewish people.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; And save some of them. For if the
[49:41] casting, Listen to this now. If you're
[49:43] not taking notes, I encourage you to
[49:45] take notes. I know sometimes our minds
[49:47] drift. We're not going to be up here
[49:48] very long just for a few moments. But if
[49:51] you if you have a a notebook and a
[49:53] paper, write it down. Uh I found that
[49:56] that is a really good way to to listen
[49:59] to what the minister say. And it's
[50:00] something about when you hear it and you
[50:02] put it down on paper. If you could I've
[50:05] wrote notes in my Bible. Some say you
[50:07] write notes in your Bible. I sure do. I
[50:09] got them right here on the back part
[50:11] here if I don't have a piece of paper.
[50:12] But we all have cell phones. And don't
[50:14] tell me you don't. and we all have notes
[50:16] on there and you can take down and just
[50:18] write down notes. So, that's one time
[50:20] you you have permission to use your cell
[50:22] phones in church. Now, uh take notes and
[50:25] and listen to what uh write down the
[50:27] scriptures here and and it does help
[50:29] you. Uh I've learned that I talked to
[50:31] brother Jason and brother Jason tells me
[50:33] that he is an avid notekeeper. I he I
[50:36] believe he told me he's been taking
[50:37] notes ever since he was a teenage boy or
[50:39] maybe younger than that. And uh I can't
[50:42] I can't I don't have the same claim at
[50:44] all. But I have taken up that and it
[50:46] does really help you. Now for if the
[50:49] casting away of them be the reconciling
[50:52] of the world, what shall the receiving
[50:56] of them be?
[50:58] But life from the dead. Isn't that
[51:00] wonderful? If them being cast away and
[51:03] cut off,
[51:05] amen, was the reconciling of the world,
[51:09] what shall the receiving of them be? Or
[51:12] when they are restored back into the
[51:16] fold. Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; For if the first fruit be holy, the lump
[51:20] is also holy. And if the root be holy,
[51:23] so are the branches. and have some of
[51:25] the branches be broken off and thou
[51:28] being a wild olive speaking about us. He
[51:30] was talking to the Romans here. This is
[51:32] Paul a Jew speaking to these high-minded
[51:36] thought that they were better than the
[51:38] Jewish people Romans.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And he said if if if some of the
[51:42] branches be broken off and thou you
[51:45] being a wild olive tree,
[51:47] &gt;&gt; that's the Gentile,
[51:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Were grafted in. Now that word is
[51:52] spelled a little bit different. G r a ff
[51:55] d. It's a little bit different from
[51:56] James. It said grafted, but it means
[51:58] exactly the same thing. It's past tense
[52:00] of being grafted in. If you were grafted
[52:03] in among them, and with them partakest
[52:07] of the root and fatness of the olive
[52:10] tree, boast not against the branches.
[52:13] But if thou boast, thou beest not the
[52:15] root, but the root thee. Now, I'm going
[52:18] to I'm going to break all this down in
[52:19] just a little bit. Thou wil say then the
[52:21] branches are broken off that I might be
[52:22] grafted in. Well, because now Paul stops
[52:26] there. He says, "Well," and you can see
[52:28] a pause. What that means is right.
[52:31] That's good. What you said is exactly
[52:34] right. They were broken off that we were
[52:37] grafted in. That's exactly right. Well,
[52:40] &gt;&gt; because of unbelief, they were broken
[52:42] off. And thou standest by faith. Be not
[52:47] highminded,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; but fear. So what he's telling them,
[52:50] don't beaughty. Don't think that you're
[52:52] something special,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; but fear
[52:56] &gt;&gt; because the same thing could happen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; For if God spared not the natural
[53:02] branches, take heed, lest he also spare
[53:05] not thee.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[53:09] when I was looking at this, I I was
[53:11] studying about grafting
[53:15] and and and and so we see what Paul is
[53:19] saying is and I got to look it up. Well,
[53:22] why did God graft in the gentile church?
[53:26] Yes, we were grafted in. Paul says here
[53:28] very plainly, we were grafted in. But
[53:32] when a farmer or a or a uh vine a
[53:35] vineyard keeper or if you have fruit
[53:38] trees especially this is this is when
[53:41] the grafting process takes place.
[53:44] Why were we grafted in?
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; What was the purpose of it?
[53:50] Well, now there's several reasons why
[53:52] grafting is is optimal.
[53:56] The first of which is if the branch
[53:59] becomes broken. Yeah.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Diseased.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Or just plain unfruitful.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; It can be broken off in a storm. This
[54:09] was a wonderful tree. It was a good
[54:11] tree. I love this tree. It It's It's got
[54:14] a strong root system in it. And And a
[54:18] lot of farmers, they'll take a tree, say
[54:19] it's a it's a lemon tree. Let's just use
[54:22] a citrus. And And say it's a lemon tree,
[54:25] and it was a great tree, but it got a
[54:27] limb broken off. And it takes so long to
[54:30] plant another tree, for it to grow up
[54:32] and to come to fruition. But it's easier
[54:35] to take a branch and to attach it to an
[54:38] established root system already.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And for that to grow.
[54:45] Now, that's one purpose is to is to
[54:48] repair what was been broken off. Another
[54:51] thing is to accelerate fruit production.
[54:55] Sometimes they'll do that. They'll
[54:57] they'll graft in a branch to accelerate
[55:00] the production.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; And and and so because it takes so long
[55:04] for a tree to grow up, they'll put it in
[55:06] there and and and that's what brings on
[55:10] the fruit. Now, um
[55:13] so what we see is what Paul is saying.
[55:16] Of course, this is the botany. This is a
[55:18] this is speaking of of the botney life
[55:21] and the farming and and and and so
[55:24] Israel being that original olive tree,
[55:29] &gt;&gt; that natural olive tree that was
[55:31] absolutely supernatural to start with.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; We all know that that God took Abraham
[55:39] &gt;&gt; and made a promise to him
[55:41] &gt;&gt; who his wife was barren. Abraham had no
[55:45] children AND HE MADE A PROMISE AND SAID,
[55:46] "YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SON."
[55:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And he didn't take any in consideration
[55:53] to the deadness of his own body. Is that
[55:55] right?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Or the deadness of his wife's womb or
[55:58] the age or any of those things, but he
[56:00] believed God. Amen. He believed what God
[56:03] said. AND FROM THAT FAITH,
[56:07] &gt;&gt; God brought a supernatural man on the
[56:10] scene. Amen. Isaac was born. YOU SAY
[56:13] SUPERNATURAL. Absolutely supernatural.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; He was brought, it was a spoken word
[56:18] that was brought and placed into the
[56:20] womb of Sarah. Is that right?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; It was spoken by Elohim himself. And it
[56:26] was BROUGHT TO PASS BY CHANGING ABRAHAM
[56:29] and Sarah back to a young man and a
[56:32] young woman. But not ONLY THAT, WHEN HE
[56:35] CHANGED HIM, he healed whatever was
[56:37] causing her to be barren to start with.
[56:39] So now she was changed from old to young
[56:42] and healed. What a supernatural man that
[56:46] was born. WHY? TO BRING ABOUT THE
[56:49] PURPOSE THAT GOD HAD SAID, ABRAHAM, your
[56:52] seed is going to be like the stars of
[56:53] heaven, like the sand of the sea. It was
[56:56] a spoken word coming to pass. Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Supernatural. And then from there came
[57:03] the lineage of of Jacob. Amen. And and
[57:06] and Israel and and and
[57:10] s of course and and and we see the
[57:12] prophets that came on the scene. We see
[57:15] the miracles that happened under Israel
[57:17] and that was that original that original
[57:20] tree. Amen. That original root system of
[57:24] the law and the prophets and and all
[57:26] that it was.
[57:28] But something happened.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Something happened that when the Messiah
[57:32] came,
[57:33] &gt;&gt; they rejected the Messiah. Yeah,
[57:36] &gt;&gt; but you know it wasn't all together for
[57:39] us. It was a wonderful thing
[57:41] &gt;&gt; that God blinded their eyes so that we
[57:44] Gentiles could be grafted in.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Now what happens when you graft?
[57:56] So, you take a you take a branch
[58:00] and and you have to take a branch that
[58:02] is compatible with the tree.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; You can't take a pine branch and put on
[58:07] a peach tree.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; It's got to be of the same kind.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And so, you take this you take this
[58:14] branch and if it's cut off, then you you
[58:17] make it a little straighter and you and
[58:18] you cut it. And then you take the other
[58:20] branch and you put it together.
[58:23] Now, just putting it together, you can't
[58:25] just take a branch and just nail it to a
[58:27] tree and it's going to grow.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; It's got to be cut a certain way.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And the and the what they call the
[58:34] cadmium. I had to study about this. I
[58:36] don't know about that. Some of you might
[58:37] know about horiculture and things like
[58:39] that, but the cadmium's the outside of
[58:41] the of the limb is where the bark is in
[58:44] the skin. So, that has to line up
[58:47] &gt;&gt; and and and you put it together. And
[58:50] there's a way that you cut it. There's
[58:53] different ways you can cut at an angle.
[58:55] You can cut it straight off, but an
[58:56] angle is a little bit better because
[58:58] when you cut at an angle, you have more
[58:59] surface.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; See, if you just cut it straight, you
[59:01] don't have as much surface. So, cut at
[59:03] an angle. Some even cut it in a V.
[59:06] They'll cut it and then they'll take the
[59:07] other one. They'll put them together
[59:08] like that. And then they bind it
[59:09] together and make sure that it's got a
[59:12] good connection.
[59:15] And and so when this happens,
[59:18] when this happens, it's not just nailing
[59:21] two pieces of wood together,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; It's literally the life that's in the
[59:28] branch that you have now attached
[59:31] &gt;&gt; is growing into the original tree
[59:35] &gt;&gt; at a molecular level,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; AT A CELLULAR LEVEL. THE VEINS in the
[59:39] water system IS GROWING TOGETHER. THE
[59:41] BARK IS NOW GROWING TOGETHER and it's
[59:44] now it is growing so that you cannot
[59:47] separate or distinguish between the
[59:50] branches.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; It's one is now the life of the original
[59:55] is now the life in THE NEW THAT'S PUT ON
[59:58] &gt;&gt; AND SO IS THAT ORIGINAL CHURCH.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; See when when Jesus died
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; he redeemed
[1:00:08] he redeemed Israel. Do you believe that
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; she was a his original wife?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT GOD DIVORCED ISRAEL BECAUSE of
[1:00:21] the pollution that she had, because of
[1:00:23] the corruption that she had, because of
[1:00:25] the WHORING THAT SHE DID time and time
[1:00:28] and time again.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] But when when God redeemed Israel, just
[1:00:35] as when Boaz redeemed Naomi,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; he got a gentile bride.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; You see, Ruth was never Ruth was never
[1:00:44] part of the redemption story, so to
[1:00:47] speak, as far as being PART OF THE
[1:00:49] JEWISH PEOPLE.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; But but Boaz, when he redeemed Naomi,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; HE GOT A gentile bride, too. Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when this little upstart
[1:01:03] group,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; started on the day of Pentecost, AMEN,
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST A FLEDGING, fledgling little
[1:01:11] group of people,
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS BLOWING IN THE WIND OF THE HOLY
[1:01:16] GHOST MOVING. AMEN. COMING ALONG. JUST A
[1:01:19] LITTLE SEED that have been planted.
[1:01:20] Hallelujah.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; They were planted on the day of
[1:01:25] Pentecost.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That seed. Hallelujah. that went into
[1:01:29] the ground. Amen. And was coming up that
[1:01:32] original seed,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; they were producing wonderful fruit.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That that original Jewish church had no
[1:01:41] longer was creating any fruit. No longer
[1:01:44] were they producing fruit.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; What they were producing was man's
[1:01:49] creeds,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; dogmas, ideas, traditions. They were
[1:01:54] producing everything except for that
[1:01:57] original word of God. Even though they
[1:01:59] were established into good soil, they
[1:02:02] were they were resistant to
[1:02:03] contamination. They were resistant to
[1:02:06] pesticides. They were resistant to all
[1:02:07] of these things,
[1:02:09] but they were not producing fruit.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; So what happened?
[1:02:16] the husbandmen or Christ took it where
[1:02:19] they were cut off and he and he joined
[1:02:23] together that new little group of of
[1:02:26] believers. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; That new little church into that
[1:02:29] original that original tree. Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; So now there's another thing that
[1:02:36] happens. There's another reason why
[1:02:38] people will graft on branches.
[1:02:44] you
[1:02:46] when you graft a branch on you share the
[1:02:49] traits of the original tree too.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; So it's not just all the new branch but
[1:02:55] it shares that original life. It shares
[1:02:57] the original traits of that tree
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and and the and how prolific it is of
[1:03:04] producing the fruit. It's got all that
[1:03:06] that limb can ever handle.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; It's got all that limb will ever need.
[1:03:10] Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so what is that? IT'S
[1:03:15] GOING BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL WORD. It's
[1:03:17] this little church that was grafted in
[1:03:21] Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; of the of the New Testament church with
[1:03:24] the OLD TESTAMENT. BROTHER BANDHAM SAID
[1:03:27] THAT WAS LIKE A a eagle's wings. THE OLD
[1:03:30] AND NEW FLAPPING TOGETHER, TAKING THE
[1:03:32] LITTLE CHURCH ALL THE WAY TO GLORY.
[1:03:34] AMEN.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; The Old and New Testament coming
[1:03:36] together. So now it's the traits of that
[1:03:39] original church coming and and the fruit
[1:03:42] being produced of the new church. Amen.
[1:03:44] Grafted in.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe I'm boring. Some of you
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; maybe some of you are I hope I'm not
[1:03:51] losing you.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to I'm trying to be as uh as
[1:03:54] thorough as I can
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; with the grafting process. I'm just
[1:03:58] going to preach for just a few more
[1:04:00] minutes. Now
[1:04:03] when when the two are joined together
[1:04:07] it it the life starts growing in and
[1:04:10] that was where I I looked in James where
[1:04:13] it said that it was an engrafted word.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Now you can graft with plants but
[1:04:18] there's also in the human body
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; you can have a graft. You can have a
[1:04:23] skin graft if you get burned. If you
[1:04:26] They can take the skin from your leg and
[1:04:28] put it on your arm
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; and it'll grow. Now, scientists don't
[1:04:32] know why.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; They can't understand life. All they
[1:04:35] know is if they put it there, it'll
[1:04:37] grow. It'll grow back and and it'll and
[1:04:39] when it starts growing, the blood
[1:04:41] vessels will go in there and the nerve
[1:04:43] endings will go in there and you can
[1:04:45] look at that and that is that is you.
[1:04:48] But now if you get your hip replaced, if
[1:04:50] you get implant, if you get a a dental
[1:04:52] implant or you get a a a new knee,
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; yes, you've been implanted,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; but that's not part of you.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; It's metal or it's plastic or it's
[1:05:01] carbon or whatever it might be, but it's
[1:05:03] not you. That is not a graft. That's
[1:05:06] being implanted.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; But a graft is when it literally grows
[1:05:10] together and it becomes part of you
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; and you become part of it. It's
[1:05:16] inseparable. And that is the word of
[1:05:18] God. Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; That once you once you believe this word
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; and you take it into your heart,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; it's not just, well, I got it. I'm going
[1:05:28] to carry it. No, no, no,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; no, no. It's engrafted in you.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S GROWING INSIDE OF YOU. AMEN. YOU'RE
[1:05:35] PART OF IT. IT'S PART OF YOU. YOU CAN'T
[1:05:37] SEPARATE IT.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The engrafted word.
[1:05:42] Oh, I tell you, this word of God is so
[1:05:45] perfect.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; It's so perfect.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to tell you
[1:05:56] there's something about the English
[1:05:58] language that that I I study words
[1:06:01] sometimes and I get plum befuddled.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I I don't understand how we come up with
[1:06:06] some of the words that we come up with
[1:06:08] and they don't even resemble the
[1:06:10] original meaning. Let let's just take
[1:06:12] the word commuter for just a second.
[1:06:15] Now, we all say that that means going to
[1:06:19] work, right? I'm a commuter. I I take
[1:06:21] the this is how this is my commute to
[1:06:23] work.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean go to work.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; If you look up the original word of
[1:06:29] commute, it means to lower or to reduce.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; You commute a sentence of a if a man had
[1:06:36] 10 years in prison, then the judge
[1:06:38] commutes his sentence to one year.
[1:06:40] So, the where the word commuter came
[1:06:43] from. I'm going to give you a little
[1:06:45] history lesson here.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; The word commuter was when they had the
[1:06:49] Long Island Railroad in New York and
[1:06:52] they wanted to bring people into the
[1:06:54] city to relieve congestion on the
[1:06:56] highways and the roads and the horse and
[1:06:58] buggies or whatever they had and all the
[1:06:59] manure. So in order to get the people to
[1:07:02] take the train, they uh they enticed
[1:07:06] them by commuting their fair.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And so they became commuters
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; because their fair was commuted. It was
[1:07:16] reduced from
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; a penny to half a penny or whatever it
[1:07:19] was back then,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; but it was it was commuted down. And so
[1:07:26] our vernacular now, our modern language,
[1:07:29] when we say commute, the first thing
[1:07:31] comes up, oh, travel to work. That's not
[1:07:33] what it means.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; But now we've made it mean that.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; So when I look in the Bible, just hold
[1:07:42] on to that thought for just a minute.
[1:07:44] When you look up the word cleave,
[1:07:47] now we know in the Bible it says that a
[1:07:51] man shall leave his father and his
[1:07:53] mother. I know we have some newlyweds
[1:07:55] here. Brother Gideon, I still call you a
[1:07:58] newlywed,
[1:08:00] brother Micah. Any more newlyweds here?
[1:08:02] Uh, two years or less. Anybody? Okay.
[1:08:06] Yeah, I forgot about y'all.
[1:08:10] All right. Oh, you back here. Okay. You
[1:08:12] got married. All right. Yeah, that's
[1:08:13] right. You supposed to be the devil in
[1:08:15] the play and you wasn't there. That's
[1:08:17] right.
[1:08:18] So,
[1:08:20] who who played the devil? Was that you?
[1:08:23] Good job. So now, so when you leave a
[1:08:28] father and mother
[1:08:30] and then you cleave unto your wife, that
[1:08:33] literally makes no sense. If you think
[1:08:36] about the word cleave. Now in the old
[1:08:38] English, they have taken that because of
[1:08:40] what the Bible says and they say, well,
[1:08:42] cleave means to join together and to
[1:08:45] separate. How in the world does that
[1:08:47] make any sense?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; It's a word they call it. I forget what
[1:08:52] it's called. You know how you have like
[1:08:53] different words, synonyms, homonyms.
[1:08:55] This is like the opposite M or whatever
[1:08:57] it is. It's words that it's a
[1:09:03] doesn't mean that it what that was was a
[1:09:05] a misunderstanding of what the word of
[1:09:07] God was saying.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Because what the word cleave means and
[1:09:11] we all know what's a meat cleaver. You
[1:09:13] cut meat. You separate it. The cleft of
[1:09:16] a rock is the root is a the root word is
[1:09:18] cleave. The cleft means it's separated.
[1:09:20] A hole in the rock, a a hiding place.
[1:09:23] Amen. A cloven hoof. That's also part of
[1:09:26] the word of cleave. It's a cloven hoof.
[1:09:28] It means a separated hoof. It's
[1:09:29] separated. Nowhere else in the English
[1:09:32] language does cleave mean to join
[1:09:34] together.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; There's nowhere except in that one
[1:09:38] scripture in the Bible.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; And here's the reason why. It is because
[1:09:44] before that you can be joined to your
[1:09:48] wife and you can be joined to your
[1:09:50] husband, there has to be a separating
[1:09:54] part.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; You have to leave your father and
[1:09:56] mother. You are cleaving from your
[1:09:59] family. You're cleaving from your good
[1:10:00] old buddies. You're cleaving from all of
[1:10:02] these things that held you a free man.
[1:10:04] Now you are now joining together. You
[1:10:07] are cleaving just like this. You She's
[1:10:10] cutting. You're cutting. You're joining
[1:10:13] together. And what happens? Are you two
[1:10:15] people? No. The Bible says you are one
[1:10:17] flesh now. Now you are one. You are
[1:10:20] joined together. Her life is your life.
[1:10:22] You live for her. She lives for you.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; AND YOU TAKE OUT OF THE EQUATION,
[1:10:27] brothers and sisters. We've got to close
[1:10:28] the back door. There's too many divorces
[1:10:30] even IN THIS MESSAGE. THERE'S TOO MANY
[1:10:32] PEOPLE WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH, YOU
[1:10:34] SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'll just go
[1:10:36] out the back door. You go find somebody
[1:10:38] else. I'll go find somebody else."
[1:10:41] It's too easy.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; BUT IT TAKES I call marriage a crucible.
[1:10:47] Marriage is a crucible to refine two
[1:10:50] people together.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Because it it can be rough.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; There's hard times there. You are you
[1:10:57] are absolutely
[1:10:59] giving of yourself.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; When I got married, I put myself on the
[1:11:03] back burner. I had seven kids, so I
[1:11:06] wasn't even on the stove anymore after
[1:11:08] that.
[1:11:12] I was lucky to be on the grill out in
[1:11:13] the backyard. I was back burner nothing.
[1:11:16] I was way out no toaster maybe.
[1:11:22] But you have got to do that as a man.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what the number one
[1:11:27] cause of divorce is. Oh, some might say
[1:11:30] adultery. Well, yeah, that's a lot.
[1:11:33] That's right, brother. Who said
[1:11:34] selfishness? That's exactly right. It's
[1:11:37] selfishness because you when it comes
[1:11:39] right down to it, if you don't
[1:11:41] completely give of yourself
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; and put the other person ahead of you,
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; then you will put yourself first
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; and that don't never come out good.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Now, that's why you've got to cut you've
[1:11:59] got to cut off. Now, I'm not saying cut
[1:12:02] your family off. I'm not saying that.
[1:12:04] But don't sit there and criticize your
[1:12:05] wife's food and say it ain't nothing
[1:12:06] like mama makes.
[1:12:08] You're not gonna join together too good
[1:12:10] like that.
[1:12:13] Or if the husband uh don't do like the
[1:12:17] chores like her her wife thinks that he
[1:12:19] should. Well, daddy sure done everything
[1:12:21] for mama like that. You know what I'm
[1:12:23] saying? So, you've got to leave that and
[1:12:25] you have to cleave to each other.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; If you got buddies that trying to drag
[1:12:29] you out there, come on, man. Let's go do
[1:12:31] You can't do that anymore. you know, you
[1:12:33] can't do that anymore. And a lot of
[1:12:34] times you kind of find yourself, but
[1:12:36] that's the way God designed it. You've
[1:12:38] got to leave and you've got to cleave.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; You've got to cut off.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm getting ready to uh we're
[1:12:45] moving right on down here. And now, so,
[1:12:48] so cleave means to separate. We know
[1:12:52] that.
[1:12:53] But now, here's the thing about it, too.
[1:12:56] How do we join to this word of God? How
[1:13:00] do we join? THAT MEANS THAT SOMETHING'S
[1:13:04] GOT TO BE CUT IN US.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; If the word is grafted in, then there
[1:13:08] had to be a cut. There had to be an
[1:13:10] abrasion somewhere. You can't just take
[1:13:12] two sticks and put them together. It's
[1:13:13] got to be cut a certain way. It's got to
[1:13:15] be joined a certain way so that that
[1:13:17] life can flow in one to the other.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; That's good. And as long as you still
[1:13:23] love the things of the world, as long as
[1:13:25] you're still hanging on to those things
[1:13:27] of the world, and you don't cut those
[1:13:29] things off, you will never have the
[1:13:31] engrafted word living in you.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; It cannot grow.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a clean cut. It's got to
[1:13:38] be a clean cut from you.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; We already know that Christ was bruised.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Christ was beaten. He was absolutely You
[1:13:46] couldn't even recognize him. He was
[1:13:47] beaten. So, he's already been cut,
[1:13:49] brother. He was the bleeding sacrifice.
[1:13:52] That's already happened. Now he's
[1:13:53] waiting on us. Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you what does that.
[1:13:58] Ephesians 4 says that the word of God is
[1:14:01] sharp
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; and it's quick. That means it's alive.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; It's a living word and it's powerful
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; and it'll divide. Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; It'll cleave, won't it?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; The word of God will cut off of the
[1:14:16] things in your life that don't need to
[1:14:18] be there. Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And the only now this ain't a one and
[1:14:21] done. This ain't a one and we don't come
[1:14:23] to church just one time and say, "Oh,
[1:14:25] bless God, I GOT IT." LET ME tell you
[1:14:27] something. Did you eat last week?
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Did it hold you to this week?
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; You got to continually feed. And the
[1:14:36] word of God is the same way. And you
[1:14:38] have to continually feed. And every time
[1:14:40] you feed, guess what? That word is
[1:14:42] cutting.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's cutting something in you that
[1:14:45] ain't like God. It's cutting something.
[1:14:46] Because let me tell you something. If
[1:14:47] you're breathing, you got something in
[1:14:49] you that ain't like God. As long as
[1:14:51] we're in this flesh, as long as our
[1:14:53] heart's beating, you got something in
[1:14:55] you that ain't like God. And it's got to
[1:14:57] continually continually cut. The word of
[1:15:00] God is sharp, brothers and sisters. And
[1:15:02] it's a two-edge. Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It'll cut right off. Now, I got
[1:15:07] to hurry up now.
[1:15:10] So
[1:15:14] this um this word that we believe, this
[1:15:16] message that we believe,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; we've heard all kinds of things lately.
[1:15:22] All kinds of folks that that just say
[1:15:24] we're a cult or say that we follow after
[1:15:27] a man. I've heard it all. I grew up
[1:15:29] having to defend it ever since I was a
[1:15:31] young boy. And it kind of sometimes you
[1:15:34] get a little weary of that. You know,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; people call you all kinds of things and
[1:15:38] they call you this that and the other
[1:15:39] and and but but there's one thing that I
[1:15:42] have learned that this message that we
[1:15:45] follow, this message that we believe was
[1:15:47] sent to us. Amen. By God.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; It's a message from God through his
[1:15:54] prophet. Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. If folks
[1:15:57] say, "Well, we can get it without a
[1:15:59] prophet." Good luck with that. Because
[1:16:01] Jesus never did one thing.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. except for going to the temple
[1:16:06] when he was 12 years old and talked to
[1:16:07] the rabbis. But there's not one account
[1:16:11] of anything that he ever did until he
[1:16:14] went to the prophet first.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; The word made flesh had to go to the
[1:16:19] prophet first. And that goes right back
[1:16:21] to Amos 3:7. God's word, it has to be
[1:16:24] the same.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change. Amos 3:7 says,
[1:16:28] "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:16:30] what he first shows it to his servants,
[1:16:33] the prophets."
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And so they say, "Well, uh, we don't why
[1:16:38] do we need a prophet?" Let me tell you
[1:16:39] what a prophet did is a prophet came and
[1:16:42] he had eagle eye vision
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and he and he when they were looking at
[1:16:45] two gods and three gods, he took that
[1:16:47] binocular and zeroed it right in and
[1:16:49] there's one God. Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; We believe that, don't we?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and so this this word,
[1:16:58] this message is this right here.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; This is the message. You say, "Oh, it's
[1:17:02] a seven seal book. It's the church age
[1:17:04] book." That's right here. It's every
[1:17:07] this is the message
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; that we believe is the word of God
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; subtracting
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; subtracting man's creeds
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; dogmas
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; that's good
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; doctrines ideas and everything that
[1:17:23] doesn't look like that original
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; anybody ever seen a movie after you read
[1:17:30] the book
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; and you're like that's nothing like the
[1:17:32] book
[1:17:34] Why? BECAUSE THEY TOOK a artistic
[1:17:37] license. THEY TOOK THE BOOK AND the only
[1:17:39] thing that still resembled that book you
[1:17:41] read was the title of the movie.
[1:17:42] Everything else was like, "What in the
[1:17:44] where'd that come from?"
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what they've done with the
[1:17:46] WORD OF GOD.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE TAKEN IT. JUST TAKE for
[1:17:50] instance, take this. I heard a man
[1:17:52] asking this question the other day on
[1:17:53] the radio. When Jesus told the disciples
[1:17:57] and he breathed on him and said,
[1:17:58] "Whosoever sins you remit, they're
[1:17:59] remitted. Whosoever sins you retain,
[1:18:02] they're retained." Well, that's where
[1:18:03] the Catholics get the priest's
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; confessional from.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; On the surface, it looks like
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; well, that's what he was saying that the
[1:18:11] church would have the power to forgive
[1:18:13] and the church would have this power and
[1:18:15] and that you could give it to Well, he
[1:18:17] was telling talking to Peter. He was the
[1:18:19] first pope. So, let let's just deduce it
[1:18:21] on down. The pope gives the the priest
[1:18:22] authority and the priest can go in
[1:18:24] there. But let me tell you where that
[1:18:26] garbage came from. came from Babylon
[1:18:28] when they would go in and they would
[1:18:29] confess and they would use it for
[1:18:31] extortion and they would use it for
[1:18:32] blackmail and it just all that
[1:18:34] Babylonian garbage came right on down
[1:18:36] and it's mixed in with the Christianity.
[1:18:39] See that's not the original.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HOW THAT WAS
[1:18:45] FULFILLED. Whosoever sins you remit,
[1:18:48] Jesus said in Luke 24 that the
[1:18:51] repentance and remission of sins MUST BE
[1:18:53] PREACHED FIRST IN Jerusalem in his name.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; AND PETER ON THE DAY OF Pentecost stood
[1:19:00] and they said, "What do we do?"
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; You know how Peter remitted their sins?
[1:19:04] HE PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO THEM. HE
[1:19:06] PREACHED THE WORD TO THEM
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; AND SAID TO REPENT, BE BAPTIZED, AND
[1:19:11] THEN YOUR SINS WILL BE REMITTED.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; They've taken that completely out. So it
[1:19:16] looks nothing like that original word.
[1:19:18] IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE the original.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; It's man's ideas. It's man's creeds.
[1:19:23] It's just a surface. Not even scratching
[1:19:26] the surface hardly.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And how does their sin retained? When
[1:19:31] they reject the word of God,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; when they reject the message
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; always.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; You don't believe. Therefore, your sin
[1:19:38] remains. Is that not what Jesus said?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; If you disbelieve, then your sin
[1:19:43] remains. And the only way to do it, I
[1:19:45] can't sit there and tell you your sins
[1:19:47] are forgiven you. I can by the word of
[1:19:49] God if you have met the requirements
[1:19:51] that the word of God has said
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; and that's the only way
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; now I've got to close. And now I know I
[1:19:58] done said it three times. Now I did want
[1:20:00] to leave you with this because it may be
[1:20:01] a little while before I get back here,
[1:20:03] but I wanted to say this
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:10] what is sin? It's unbelief. the but the
[1:20:13] root word of sin. How many's ever heard
[1:20:15] what the root word of sin is in the
[1:20:17] Greek in the Hebrew? Anybody ever heard
[1:20:19] that? Well, in the Greek, the word sin
[1:20:21] means hamarcia. That's a Greek word for
[1:20:24] it. You know what it means? It means to
[1:20:27] miss the mark.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; It means you're off.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; In the Greek, the word is I mean in the
[1:20:33] Hebrew, it's shata. This means the same
[1:20:36] thing.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It means to miss the mark.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And and that makes so much sense. now is
[1:20:42] is more than that too. We all know that.
[1:20:44] But that's the word they used. It's
[1:20:46] missing the mark. It's missing and and
[1:20:50] and so
[1:20:55] who when everything was so out of kilter
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; and every religion had their own brand
[1:21:01] and and everyone had it HAD TO BE
[1:21:03] SOMEBODY
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; WHO COULD HIT THAT MARK EVERY single
[1:21:07] time.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, I'm going to say this,
[1:21:12] and please, I'm going to I'm I'm going
[1:21:14] to preface it with saying that I don't
[1:21:16] mean this how it it may sound to you,
[1:21:19] but I don't know I don't know that
[1:21:22] brother Brandham knew that. I don't know
[1:21:24] if he knew that the root word of sin in
[1:21:27] the Greek was hamarcia. I never heard
[1:21:29] him say that. I don't know if he knew
[1:21:31] what the the root word of sin was in the
[1:21:34] Hebrew. I don't know if he knew that.
[1:21:36] Now, that's not I'm not putting anything
[1:21:38] I'm no in no way, shape, or form. not
[1:21:40] elevating myself. No, please don't
[1:21:42] misunderstand me. But I'm going to say
[1:21:45] that for this purpose and this purpose
[1:21:46] only.
[1:21:48] That even though he may not have known
[1:21:50] that that was the root word, his very
[1:21:52] life and his very nature bore out that
[1:21:56] he did not want to miss that mark.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Everything that he did, every aspect of
[1:22:04] his ministry, he wanted to hit that mark
[1:22:07] every time. I'm going to read you a
[1:22:10] quote here that he said
[1:22:14] who said I love to shoot and the targets
[1:22:17] and here not long ago I was squirrel
[1:22:18] hunting down in Kentucky. There was I
[1:22:20] had a little model 75 rifle. It sounds I
[1:22:23] hope it don't sound sacrilegious to you
[1:22:25] to say this in the sermon but I will
[1:22:27] tell you I'm trying to make a point and
[1:22:30] this little rifle I trained it in and
[1:22:32] I've dealt and fooled with guns since I
[1:22:34] was a little kid. I love them. And I had
[1:22:36] this little model 75 till I could just
[1:22:38] every time hit a squirrel's eye at 50
[1:22:42] yards with it. Now, I've heard brother
[1:22:43] Charlie Cox tell me testimony
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; stood and told me that he never saw
[1:22:49] anybody shoot like brother Brandham.
[1:22:51] Now, he was raised in the eastern
[1:22:52] mountains of Kentucky and they that's
[1:22:54] how they lived.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; If you didn't shoot good, you didn't eat
[1:22:57] a lot of them. And you know, anybody
[1:22:59] that shoots, military men, Brother
[1:23:02] Charles, Brother Luther, and different
[1:23:03] ones, Brother Tony, and all and anybody
[1:23:05] shoots, you know that when you sight in
[1:23:08] a rifle, you're you're going to sit on
[1:23:10] on a sandbag, preferably. And preferably
[1:23:13] the wind ain't blowing and preferably it
[1:23:15] ain't raining and and preferably you're
[1:23:18] so all these things. And then you
[1:23:20] breathe,
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; you wait for your breath. Sometimes you
[1:23:22] hold it, but you don't want to hold too
[1:23:23] long because your heart starts beating.
[1:23:24] So then you got to be real careful,
[1:23:25] especially them long shots. get way out
[1:23:27] there. So, they actually say the best
[1:23:29] shot in the world is a 15 year old girl.
[1:23:31] I've heard that because their hearts are
[1:23:32] smaller. They got good reflexes.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; But, but Brother Charlie said that
[1:23:38] brother Brandham could shoot standing
[1:23:40] offhanded. You know what offhand means?
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Standing up flatfooted, swaying,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; gun up and down, heartbeating,
[1:23:48] everything else, and nail thumbtacks at
[1:23:51] 50 yards every time. Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way in the world I could
[1:23:56] do that.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; If I had an automatic 18 shot Marlin
[1:24:00] Model 60, I might hit that thumbtack
[1:24:03] once and that's after 18 shots and just
[1:24:07] like that right there. I may be able to
[1:24:08] do it, but brother Charlie Cox said he
[1:24:11] could do it every time. Now, he had this
[1:24:13] model this model 75. I believe it was a
[1:24:15] Remington or Winchester 75. He said, "I
[1:24:18] I had this model 75 to every time hit a
[1:24:20] squirrel's eye at 50 yards with it." I
[1:24:23] had a paper from the range down there
[1:24:25] signed up that driving nine bullets
[1:24:29] through the same hole
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; at 50 yards on a rainy windy day.
[1:24:36] And I got it signed up and notorized.
[1:24:38] And that was the Lord helping me, of
[1:24:40] course, to do that. That's unusual.
[1:24:42] Yeah, I'd say
[1:24:45] nine shots through the same hole.
[1:24:48] And I started to shoot the squirrel. I
[1:24:50] find out I hit him somewhere else
[1:24:52] besides in the eye. I got nervous.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm talking about?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; His very nature of who he was.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to miss the mark.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; And you you say how oh that's got
[1:25:04] everything to do with it.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's who the man was.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to miss the mark.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I tried again on paper and it wouldn't
[1:25:11] hit the target. It would hit within oh
[1:25:14] quarter of an inch. I'd call that good
[1:25:17] or half an inch something at 50 yards.
[1:25:19] But I know it would do better than that.
[1:25:21] That's the key. He knew. He had tasted
[1:25:25] and he had seen. He had already that
[1:25:27] that rifle had proved itself to him. He
[1:25:30] had been in the He had shot that gun and
[1:25:32] he knew what that gun could do. Amen.
[1:25:34] I'm gonna get to that. I done everything
[1:25:36] to the gun that I know how to do and
[1:25:38] nothing seemed to fix it up. Right.
[1:25:42] Now,
[1:25:44] it said here, he says,
[1:25:47] let's see. I might have just messed
[1:25:49] myself up. Hang on. We'll find it.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go. Now, it says, "So, I
[1:25:56] wrapped it up in the box and sent it
[1:25:58] back to Winchester
[1:26:00] Company for examination
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; for rebedding." That means take the
[1:26:04] barrel off, shave, if you need to shave
[1:26:06] down the stock and see what's going on
[1:26:08] with it, uh, and then put it back
[1:26:09] together. Rebetting. They wrote me a
[1:26:11] nice letter. I have it my file at home
[1:26:13] and it said Reverend Brandham said that
[1:26:15] rifle will group an inch at 25 yards.
[1:26:18] It's just a model 75. They didn't think
[1:26:20] there's much to it.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; They only said it'll do an inch. He had
[1:26:23] the paper notorized saying it would put
[1:26:25] a hole nine times through at 50 yards on
[1:26:28] a rainy windy day. That rifle will
[1:26:31] groove an inch at 25 yards. Said it's
[1:26:33] just a model 75. Said it's not a target
[1:26:35] gun. It's just a little plinker. and
[1:26:38] said, "You'll never get any better than
[1:26:39] that." Now, that was Winchester Company
[1:26:42] that made the gun and an inch at 25
[1:26:45] yards and I drove nine straight holes at
[1:26:47] 50 yards. Now, here's my thought. My
[1:26:49] wife said, "Now look, Bill," she said,
[1:26:51] "if that company who made the rifle will
[1:26:53] just say that and it won't do no better
[1:26:55] than that, then who are you to say
[1:26:57] that?" I said, "Honey, here is here is
[1:27:00] what it is. I don't care what the
[1:27:03] company says. I've seen it do it
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; and I know it'll do it. Amen. [laughter]
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And I sat down there when the other
[1:27:11] brethren were shooting at squirrels.
[1:27:13] Anywhere they wanted to hit them was all
[1:27:14] right. Midcenter back or anywhere. I sit
[1:27:17] under a tree and was crying. I said,
[1:27:19] "God, I'm so nervous. I can't hold
[1:27:21] myself together. Why did you make me a
[1:27:23] little nervous fellow like this?" And
[1:27:25] just I realized where I'm standing here.
[1:27:27] The Bible before me and a voice just as
[1:27:30] plain as you would hear mine said, "You
[1:27:33] were made thus
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; for a purpose."
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Because until you know that rifle is
[1:27:40] going to zero once because if it zeroed
[1:27:42] once, it'll zero again. It's the same
[1:27:45] rifle. Therefore, I see it. If obeying
[1:27:48] this word, Amen. taking this rangefinder
[1:27:50] and bring it down to a place till I can
[1:27:53] see the same thing those apostles saw
[1:27:55] the same gospel they PREACHED IT'LL
[1:27:57] PRODUCE THE same results. Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz it did FOR THEM. IT'LL STRIKE THE
[1:28:02] TARGET every time. No matter what the
[1:28:04] church says and the people who claims to
[1:28:07] be I know it'll do it. Amen.
[1:28:10] Because there is what I want to look at
[1:28:12] that word to see that it's exactly in
[1:28:14] focus to see the same vision they saw
[1:28:17] and it'll do the same job that it did
[1:28:19] for them. IT'LL HEAL THE SICK. IT'LL
[1:28:22] RAISE THE DEAD. IT'LL CAST OUT DEVILS.
[1:28:24] IT'LL BRING FORTH the glorious church
[1:28:26] who is willing to seal their testimony
[1:28:28] with their own blood if it comes
[1:28:30] necessary to do that
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; because it depends on what you're
[1:28:34] looking at. Now, if I had looked to what
[1:28:36] the Winchester company said, which is
[1:28:38] supposed to be the one that made the
[1:28:39] gun, then I'd have listened to them. But
[1:28:42] I know different.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Now, if I looked to the church and they
[1:28:45] say, "Oh, them days IS GONE." AND
[1:28:47] THERE'S NO SUCH thing as that. See where
[1:28:49] you'd be? It'd be plum off of target.
[1:28:52] Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; But if he is ever God, he is still God.
[1:28:56] He's always God. And he can't BE NOTHING
[1:28:59] ELSE BUT GOD. AND HE IS GOD ETERNAL.
[1:29:02] THEREFORE, WE WANT TO LOOK to that
[1:29:03] target. Not what target the church is
[1:29:06] shooting at, but what target that Christ
[1:29:09] is shooting at. Amen. And he did not
[1:29:12] miss the mark.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, let me tell you
[1:29:15] something, brothers and sisters. He was
[1:29:17] wounded for my transgressions. He was
[1:29:20] bruised for my iniquity. Now, God, take
[1:29:23] my life, whatever it is in me that's not
[1:29:25] like you, God, and start cutting it out.
[1:29:28] Oh, I want to be JOINED TOGETHER WITH
[1:29:30] THAT WORD. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT LIFE
[1:29:32] CAN FLOW IN ME and through me. And I can
[1:29:35] produce the fruit.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That has to be produced.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; This little bride will produce the
[1:29:41] fruit.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; She'll produce it. Amen. Grafted the
[1:29:45] engrafted word. Amen. Hit that target
[1:29:47] every time.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, it ain't just close enough. That's
[1:29:51] horseshoes and hang grenades. I want to
[1:29:53] hit that target every time.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Come on, brother.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to God. Amen. [applause]
[1:30:04] Appreciate that. Amen. Did you
[1:30:06] appreciate that word?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Joe. I know
[1:30:09] that's our certainly our desire.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; We want to hit the mark. You know, I was
[1:30:15] hearing Brother Green tell a testimony,
[1:30:16] [clears throat] Brother Joe, was pretty
[1:30:18] powerful of uh being with Brother
[1:30:20] Brandham in a uh a tent while it was
[1:30:23] they were all snowed in. You just play
[1:30:25] something for me. um being in a tent. Uh
[1:30:29] they were all snowed in. Just an amazing
[1:30:31] personal story they told about just to
[1:30:33] show you what kind of man he was. And
[1:30:35] brother Green said that they had a dart
[1:30:37] board there. They were throwing darts.
[1:30:40] And he said that uh he'd watched Brother
[1:30:41] Brandham and he said, "Man, he would hit
[1:30:44] the bullseye every single time he threw
[1:30:46] that dart."
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And brother Green has it on his 8
[1:30:49] millimeter camera. He took shot, took
[1:30:50] pictures of it. He said every time, he
[1:30:52] said, "Brother Brandon would would throw
[1:30:54] that dart." He said he'd hit the mark.
[1:30:56] [music] Hit the mark. Hit the mark. And
[1:30:58] he said after a while, he said every
[1:31:00] every, you know, now and then the the
[1:31:02] brothers would come inside and said,
[1:31:03] "Oh, let's play a game." And so, Brother
[1:31:04] Brandon would play the game with him.
[1:31:06] And he said, "But every time they played
[1:31:08] competitively, he'd miss every time."
[1:31:12] And he said [music] he wouldn't even be
[1:31:13] close to the target. And brother Green
[1:31:15] called on for a while and he said he was
[1:31:17] doing it on purpose by himself. He was
[1:31:19] hitting the he was just hitting the
[1:31:20] bullseye, but it was it was competitive.
[1:31:23] And so he asked him, he said, 'Brother
[1:31:24] Brandon, why are you doing that? He
[1:31:25] said, 'Brother Green, he said, 'If
[1:31:27] there's any joy in winning.' And [music]
[1:31:29] he says, 'Why don't I give you that
[1:31:30] kind, why don't I give you that joy? And
[1:31:33] it just spoke to brother Green so much
[1:31:35] about his character. [music] And he
[1:31:36] actually quoted um I think it's
[1:31:40] Galatians 5 and it talks about
[1:31:41] emulations and and brother Brandon takes
[1:31:43] that word and says it's overly
[1:31:45] competitiveness.
[1:31:47] And it was just showing you the
[1:31:48] character, you know, in [music] in a
[1:31:50] prophet that he just let them win. never
[1:31:52] told him that, but that was the kind of
[1:31:54] man he was.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate that?
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we give the Lord Jesus
[1:31:59] another hand? Give our brother Joe.
[1:32:01] Thank you, brother. Amen. [applause]
[1:32:05] Amen. Appreciated that so much. Why
[1:32:06] don't you gather? We [music] don't just
[1:32:08] have a It's only 8:35. And so we'll just
[1:32:10] make our way forward. Amen. And just
[1:32:13] take up these needs, different prayer
[1:32:14] [music] requests here. Be it unto

[1:34:42] Just keep playing that. Brother Joe,
[1:34:44] I'll have you come and take these
[1:34:46] requests here. Brother Matthew Smith
[1:34:47] says, "Please pray for Katie tonight.
[1:34:50] Keep her in your prayer. She's [music]
[1:34:51] feeling poorly. We know that some uh
[1:34:53] sickness is still going around. So, we
[1:34:56] want to remember our sister Katie Smith.
[1:34:58] That's brother Matthew's wife. From
[1:35:00] brother Travis, my childhood friend
[1:35:01] named CB [music] Patterson is a few days
[1:35:04] or even hours away from passing away
[1:35:06] from cancer. He's 44 years old and has a
[1:35:09] family. Pray that the Lord will be
[1:35:11] merciful. Amen.
[1:35:15] Okay.
[1:35:18] Yeah. Yeah. So, just nausea, a severe
[1:35:21] headache, lightheaded. She like got a
[1:35:23] touch from the Lord. Amen. And also this
[1:35:25] need for brother Travis's childhood
[1:35:28] friend CB Patterson. My goodness. You
[1:35:32] know, Brother Brandham said, "You can't
[1:35:33] really pray for someone until you enter
[1:35:35] into their suffering." So, um I I could
[1:35:38] imagine, you know, what that family
[1:35:40] would be going through right now. So, we
[1:35:42] want to You believe that God is still a
[1:35:43] God of miracles? How many believe that?
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've watched God heal cancer
[1:35:48] before. Amen. God can do it. I want to
[1:35:52] uh bring also a need here tonight for a
[1:35:55] a work associate [music] of mine that
[1:35:57] I've worked with for years. Uh well, for
[1:35:59] about two years now and uh just uh see
[1:36:03] him just for an hour maybe every few
[1:36:05] days. Um conversation has always been
[1:36:08] very casual, just uh you know, never
[1:36:11] been able to have any time to speak to
[1:36:12] him. Um, but today we were just [music]
[1:36:16] talking and he started telling me about
[1:36:18] his situation he's in. He's 40. I want
[1:36:21] to say Jeremy's probably in his early
[1:36:23] 40s, about my age. And he um he uh had a
[1:36:27] heart transplant just
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; uh a few years ago. Very young to have
[1:36:31] that something in his family. Looks
[1:36:34] healthy. You never ever think that in a
[1:36:36] million years have you seen him. He he
[1:36:37] he works out every single day at four
[1:36:39] o'clock in the morning. found out
[1:36:41] [music] that was the main reason why uh
[1:36:43] he exercises and goes to the gym because
[1:36:45] they told him that would increase his
[1:36:47] odds of uh sustaining a heart
[1:36:49] transplant. It's one of the most
[1:36:50] dangerous surgeries you can have. Um not
[1:36:52] a even a great [music] survival rate
[1:36:54] from it. Uh well, I shouldn't say that,
[1:36:56] but a you know, one that you would think
[1:36:59] mortality rate is. It's a risky surgery.
[1:37:02] Um, [music] and so he told me that they
[1:37:04] they've told him that his his last
[1:37:06] doctor's visit doesn't look good and
[1:37:08] that in April they're going to give him
[1:37:10] his final followup and that if it
[1:37:12] continues to go the direction uh that
[1:37:15] he's going he will have to have another
[1:37:16] [music]
[1:37:17] heart transplant.
[1:37:19] And so he's real shook up over that. And
[1:37:21] he's also just uh his life is sort of uh
[1:37:24] you know uh already in a under a lot of
[1:37:26] pressure by different circumstances. So,
[1:37:28] I just told him, I said, "Jeremy,"
[1:37:29] [music]
[1:37:30] I said, "I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:37:32] believer." I said, "I might not have
[1:37:33] told you this, but I'm a minister." And
[1:37:34] I said, "And I believe in divine
[1:37:36] healing." And I testified to him about
[1:37:38] my hearing loss, the way the Lord
[1:37:40] supernaturally gave me back hearing, and
[1:37:42] also about um Marcus Humphrey who was
[1:37:45] healed of stage four cancer, Elena
[1:37:48] Butts, different ones that we know. and
[1:37:50] and you could just see the um the look
[1:37:52] in his face, you know, desperate times
[1:37:54] when someone's desperate like that, they
[1:37:56] grasp on to, you know, anything, any
[1:37:59] hope that [music] they can have it all.
[1:38:00] So, I just told him, I said, I just, you
[1:38:02] know, I want to tell you if if you'd be
[1:38:04] okay with it, I'd like to mention your
[1:38:05] name before our church tonight. It's
[1:38:07] funny, Brother Joe's preaching. He
[1:38:08] actually sort of knows he knows at least
[1:38:10] the [music] family, the dad there. And
[1:38:12] so, I I'll call his name, brother J. Uh
[1:38:14] his name is Jeremy Su. I think that's
[1:38:16] how you pronounce that last name, Su.
[1:38:19] Um, and so we want to remember him,
[1:38:21] Jeremy. Um, I told him, we'll pray.
[1:38:23] We'll believe that that in April when
[1:38:25] you go back for your followup, you'll
[1:38:26] have a [music] different report than
[1:38:28] what they're expecting.
[1:38:30] Amen. If anybody's here that would have
[1:38:32] an unspoken prayer request, something
[1:38:33] you didn't get [music] time to write
[1:38:34] down, why don't you just hold that up
[1:38:36] before the Lord, put your arm on your
[1:38:38] hand over on that person that's beside
[1:38:39] you. Let's not just let Brother Joe
[1:38:41] pray, but let's lift up our voices. The
[1:38:43] Lord wants to hear our voice, and prayer
[1:38:45] changes things. So, let's call on the
[1:38:47] Lord for these needs, right?
[1:38:52] We certainly believe the Lord is he's a
[1:38:54] healer. Amen.
[1:38:57] Let's just bow [music] our heads. Our
[1:39:00] kind, gracious heavenly father. Lord, as
[1:39:03] we come to you tonight at the close of
[1:39:05] this service,
[1:39:07] oh God, we've heard the word tonight.
[1:39:09] Lord, we've read the word. We've sung
[1:39:11] the songs. And Lord, we know dear
[1:39:14] Father, Lord, that you are the same
[1:39:17] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe this word, Father. We
[1:39:22] stand for it. Lord, we live for it. God,
[1:39:25] we know, Lord, that you are a healer.
[1:39:27] Lord, these needs that have come before
[1:39:30] us. Lord, the friend of brother Travis.
[1:39:33] [music] Oh God,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, we know that as far as physically
[1:39:37] and maybe the doctors have given him up,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; but God, we know, Lord, Father, that's
[1:39:43] when you come on the scene many times.
[1:39:46] And God, for your glory and for your
[1:39:48] honor, Lord, we just pray for this man,
[1:39:52] oh God, knowing, dear father, that
[1:39:54] nothing is too hard for you. God, may
[1:39:56] you move, dear father, is our prayer and
[1:39:59] heal the man for your glory. Lord, for
[1:40:02] sister Katie tonight. God, we pray for
[1:40:05] her. Lord, we just ask, oh God, that the
[1:40:08] sickness that she has, Lord, that your
[1:40:10] Holy Spirit, Lord, we just start at the
[1:40:13] top of her head, Lord, and burn out all
[1:40:15] the infection, all the sickness in her
[1:40:17] body, Lord, and may she be well for your
[1:40:20] glory. [music]
[1:40:21] And for this Mr. Su Lord, I just pray,
[1:40:25] Father, [music] as he was talking to
[1:40:28] brother Matt, Lord, and Brother Matt
[1:40:30] told him that we are believers. Lord, we
[1:40:34] know, dear Father, Lord Jesus, [music]
[1:40:36] that you are more than able,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; oh God, to heal this man,

[1:40:43] be, Lord, for for this little assembly,
[1:40:47] Lord. Lord, for this area, Lord, that he
[1:40:50] could proclaim, oh God, that this little
[1:40:52] church had prayer for him. The
[1:40:54] believers, the people that believe in
[1:40:56] Jesus Christ had prayer [music] for me.
[1:40:58] And now I'm a well man, oh God, for your
[1:41:01] glory, Lord. We pray that you would
[1:41:03] [music] touch him, Lord, and heal his
[1:41:05] body, dear father, is our prayer. And

[1:41:12] behind each one, Lord. Lord, if it's
[1:41:14] financial, if it's sickness, Lord, if
[1:41:16] it's for a loved one, Lord, whoever it
[1:41:19] might be, dear Father, God, we just
[1:41:21] pray, Father, you would meet that need.
[1:41:24] And oh God, the many request at our
[1:41:25] little assembly also Lord. You know each
[1:41:28] one God. We just pray father tonight
[1:41:30] [music]
[1:41:31] Lord that L Lord we bring them before
[1:41:33] thee God. Lord not just uh not just
[1:41:36] wishful thinking Lord but a a absolute
[1:41:39] steadfast [music] assurance Lord that we
[1:41:42] believe oh Father that you will meet our
[1:41:45] every need. [music]
[1:41:46] And God we commit this to you in the
[1:41:49] name of Jesus Christ we [music] pray.
[1:41:51] Amen.
[1:41:55] Would there be a testimony, something
[1:41:57] someone wants to share? Amen. Before we
[1:41:59] go, Brother Luther, come home. Amen.
[1:42:18] God bless you all. Um,
[1:42:22] I have a screen porch in the back of my
[1:42:24] house and what I did, it's pretty simple
[1:42:27] testimony, but I had a a key up there so
[1:42:30] I could unlock my back door to get in
[1:42:33] the house. Well, [music] I don't know,
[1:42:35] three, four months ago, it disappeared.
[1:42:39] Then I looked, I thought maybe the rain
[1:42:41] or something washed it away. I had it
[1:42:43] hidden and I I couldn't find it. So last
[1:42:46] week I got locked out of my house
[1:42:49] because the back door what it does is
[1:42:51] the the dead bolts unlock but sometimes
[1:42:53] the knob will not
[1:42:56] unlock when you go out and I was dumping
[1:42:58] something out in the backyard. I come
[1:43:00] back in and I had to leave in like 15
[1:43:02] minutes to go to work and u the front
[1:43:05] doors locked, the garage doors closed,
[1:43:07] my phone, everything is in the house and
[1:43:09] I'm like, "Oh my goodness, this is not
[1:43:11] good."
[1:43:12] So, I'm looking I I look on the ground
[1:43:14] out there. I'm like, and I did that
[1:43:17] before. I couldn't find it. And I So,
[1:43:19] then I started I tried to break into my
[1:43:21] house. It had some gardening tools in
[1:43:23] this green room. I can get [music] this
[1:43:25] bowl thing. I'm like, "No, that ain't
[1:43:26] working." So, I walk back out there and
[1:43:28] I'm looking on the ground. I'm going
[1:43:30] like, "Are you kidding me?"
[1:43:33] And it was the key. So, I get in the
[1:43:35] house. I was on work on time and
[1:43:36] everything.
[1:43:38] So, I was just very glad to get in the
[1:43:41] house. Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I do have a um Bruce
[1:43:45] Noak is a friend of mine. [music]
[1:43:48] He came to our wedding and stuff and um
[1:43:52] he's actually moving to Happy Valley.
[1:43:55] Not Happy Valley, but
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; not the church, but what's
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Johnson City?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; So, um we're just he's starting a covert
[1:44:05] thing there with his daughter, and I
[1:44:06] send him devotions every single morning.
[1:44:10] We talk a little bit Sometimes you say,
[1:44:12] "Well, Brother Brandham seems a little
[1:44:14] hard here and there." He's a Lutheran,
[1:44:16] German Lutheran, as staunch as can be.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; You know, Johnson City, maybe he'll run
[1:44:24] across somebody that's just a little
[1:44:26] more staunch than he is. [laughter]
[1:44:29] God bless you all. [music]
[1:44:31] [applause]
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Anybody else have a testimony? Somebody,
[1:44:34] brother Enoch, go ahead. Pass that
[1:44:35] brother Enoch.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, sister also. Um, like one or two
[1:44:42] days ago, my dad wasn't feeling very
[1:44:45] well and he was not able to go to work
[1:44:48] and I was just real upset because my dad
[1:44:52] wasn't feeling very well. Dad doesn't
[1:44:54] get sick a lot. So, it just worries me.
[1:44:57] So, yeah. Um, so I had just been praying
[1:45:01] and praying and praying and just having
[1:45:04] faith. And the next day, Dad was fine
[1:45:08] like and He's right there. He's doing
[1:45:12] fine. [applause]
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try and keep this one short
[1:45:25] even though it's been a long testimony.
[1:45:28] Um
[1:45:30] about 18 months ago, a little over 18
[1:45:33] months ago. um
[1:45:37] well longer than that cuz [music] God
[1:45:38] moves in seasons and for a long season I
[1:45:41] had felt that I wanted to be home with
[1:45:43] my family and my children but the time
[1:45:46] wasn't right everything wasn't lining up
[1:45:48] but 18 months ago kind of tugged on my
[1:45:51] heart that it was time to get ready so
[1:45:53] of course you know being the great
[1:45:55] Christian I am I wanted to do it my way
[1:45:57] so that looked like well let me see if I
[1:46:00] can step down let me see if I can kind
[1:46:03] of figure out how I can do it whatever
[1:46:05] way. And um of course that all blew up
[1:46:07] in my face. So then I thought, okay,
[1:46:10] God's saying the opposite. I'm really
[1:46:11] thinking that I'm supposed to go, but
[1:46:13] I'm not supposed to go. So I'm just
[1:46:14] going to buckle down and do what I can
[1:46:16] do. That was probably about June. And
[1:46:18] God took my health and he said, "No,
[1:46:20] that's not the way I wanted to." And
[1:46:22] finally, I surrendered and he took care
[1:46:26] of it all. Um, so last Friday was my
[1:46:30] last day working at the government,
[1:46:32] which was, as anybody knew when I was
[1:46:35] talking to them, it was not a fun trial.
[1:46:37] It was like prison. Um, but God
[1:46:39] delivered me out of [music] that. And
[1:46:41] that's so wonderful. And I got two phone
[1:46:44] calls today. Well, one yesterday, one
[1:46:46] today. One of them was from one of my
[1:46:48] employees, and she said, [music] you
[1:46:50] know, you took you brought light in and
[1:46:52] you took it out when you left. And so
[1:46:55] she was which was great. That was such a
[1:46:58] testimony to me. And another one from a
[1:47:00] my first employer with the government,
[1:47:02] she called me out of the blue. I haven't
[1:47:04] talked to her in about 5 years. And she
[1:47:06] said the same thing. She said, "When you
[1:47:07] left, you took the light with you and
[1:47:09] it's never been the same." So I thank
[1:47:12] God for to be a living testimony that to
[1:47:15] people that would have never met him.
[1:47:17] And I thank [music] God that that season
[1:47:19] of my life is over.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:47:22] Amen.
[1:47:23] [music]
[1:47:27] Anybody else? Nobody else. Sister
[1:47:30] Allison, give that back. Give that back
[1:47:32] to her.
[1:47:35] [snorts]
[1:47:36] So, on the first night of camp,
[1:47:39] um he said just say yes. And I felt
[1:47:41] something telling me [music]
[1:47:42] to pray for my friend beside me. And I
[1:47:45] kept pushing it off and pushing it off.
[1:47:47] And finally, I couldn't push it off
[1:47:48] anymore. So, I just said yes. And I
[1:47:50] started praying. And why I was praying,
[1:47:52] I was praying for her family and for
[1:47:54] whatever she was going through. And then
[1:47:56] the next day, she told me that she was
[1:47:59] struggling with her parents divorcing.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; She she wasn't um she was struggling
[1:48:05] with that and it really helped when I
[1:48:08] prayed for her and she said he gave her
[1:48:10] a touch from the Lord.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:13] [applause]
[1:48:14] Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Proves we always got to be sensitive.
[1:48:20] Amen. Sometimes it ain't us, it's the
[1:48:21] Holy Spirit tugging on our hearts.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Um, one more. If there's one more. Hey,
[1:48:27] Sister Jen, go ahead. That's all right.
[1:48:29] I'll do one more. It's just fine.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I always fight it when I fail to give a
[1:48:36] testimony.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; I'll get better. Um,
[1:48:41] since I've been since we've been here,
[1:48:43] [music] I've been battling something and
[1:48:45] I didn't understand what it was. And it
[1:48:48] just kept getting heavier and heavier
[1:48:50] and darker and darker and got to just a
[1:48:54] boiling point Sunday. And
[1:48:57] I was like, Lord, I'm I'm desperate
[1:48:59] here. I don't know what to do. And I
[1:49:01] didn't want to come back up again
[1:49:03] because I'd already come up. And brother
[1:49:05] Jason's like, "Doesn't matter how many
[1:49:06] times you you come again." And the Lord
[1:49:10] had laid on my heart the first Sunday
[1:49:12] when Sister Vicki was sitting over here
[1:49:15] [music] to pray for her. But I thought,
[1:49:17] I haven't seen her in almost seven
[1:49:19] years. We've both been through so much.
[1:49:21] I don't want to go over there and be
[1:49:22] dramatic because I know the second I hug
[1:49:24] her, I'm going to start crying. And uh
[1:49:26] so I I pushed it off that it got heavier
[1:49:30] or that's really when it started. And it
[1:49:33] got heavier after that. And then the
[1:49:34] next week she came back again and I had
[1:49:37] another opportunity and [music]
[1:49:40] it's you I'm just I I brushed it off and
[1:49:43] I what's it been four weeks and I came
[1:49:47] up and I honestly I wasn't coming to
[1:49:49] pray for her. I walked up here to get
[1:49:52] prayer for myself because I'm like man
[1:49:54] I'm in a dark place and I don't even
[1:49:56] know what to do anymore. I don't
[1:49:57] understand what I'm feeling, why I'm
[1:49:59] feeling this way. and came up here and I
[1:50:02] stood right here.
[1:50:04] And [music] anytime I go into prayer
[1:50:06] line, I just start praying for
[1:50:07] repentance and things like that. And
[1:50:09] [music]
[1:50:10] I found myself praying for her beside
[1:50:13] me. And I looked up and I realized I'd
[1:50:17] came up the wrong side and I didn't know
[1:50:19] if they would come over to me or if I
[1:50:21] needed to go over there. And [crying] in
[1:50:23] my heart I was just like, Lord, which
[1:50:25] way should I go? And I I felt him say,
[1:50:27] "Turn right." Vicki was beside me
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; and I started praying for her and it's
[1:50:34] one of those times when you start
[1:50:35] praying and you hear yourself praying
[1:50:37] instead of you praying. And um
[1:50:41] everything I prayed for her, I had been
[1:50:43] battling.
[1:50:45] And by the time by the time I was done
[1:50:48] praying, I'd been delivered of
[1:50:50] everything that I needed. And I walked
[1:50:54] out just feeling like a different
[1:50:55] person. And [music] I mean there was
[1:50:57] even scriptures that I didn't even
[1:50:59] remember knowing that I needed for me
[1:51:02] that was coming through me and [music]
[1:51:03] it it wasn't me. We know that. But I
[1:51:07] just even the kids today um Adeline
[1:51:10] looked at me and she's like, "Mommy,
[1:51:11] you're different since Sunday." And I
[1:51:13] was like, "Oh yeah, how's that?" And
[1:51:16] then her and Titus both started telling
[1:51:17] me how different [laughter] I was. So
[1:51:19] maybe I need to repent to them, too. But
[1:51:22] just want to thank God for his mercy
[1:51:23] that even when we don't do the right
[1:51:25] thing the first time, he
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; he still has.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:34] Good testimonies tonight. Got some
[1:51:36] special friends, family here, brother
[1:51:38] James, Sister Faith. So good to have
[1:51:40] them. This is Anna's parents. So good to
[1:51:44] have them. And and we do this uh we've
[1:51:46] been doing this for ever. [music]

[1:51:55] this and we've been doing it and I tell
[1:51:57] you what it's an encouragement to hear.
[1:51:59] You know I remember when Jason and Amy
[1:52:01] first moved here they thought do you all
[1:52:02] realize how profound some of these
[1:52:04] testimonies that are happening that
[1:52:06] God's doing. So you know the Bible says
[1:52:08] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:52:10] lamb and the word of their testimony. So
[1:52:13] you testify about what God does for
[1:52:14] [music] you. I believe the Lord that
[1:52:16] pleases him. Amen. Why don't you shake
[1:52:18] someone's hand before you go? Just greet
[1:52:20] them. We'll let you [music] go. Amen.
