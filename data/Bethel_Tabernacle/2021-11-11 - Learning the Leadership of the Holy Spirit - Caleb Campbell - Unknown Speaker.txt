tonight into uh first peter the second chapter we're gonna read from verses uh nine first peter second chapter versus nine nine and ten amen amen all right say amen if you got it amen all right it says first peter chapter two verse nine but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past you were not a people but are now the people of god which have which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy amen let's go to one more verse we're going to read in romans 8 romans 8 13 before we have our seats amen romans 8 and verse 13 it says for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye live through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen let's just bow our heads dear precious heavenly father lord god we're just in your house tonight father we have one one desire father and that's just to draw closer to you tonight father we invite your presence to be here tonight lord we pray over the reading of your word lord we pray that lord we can just get out of the way tonight father lord so that you can just lord speak through us lord lord that this message lord that you placed upon our hearts father god can just lord resonate lord in the hearts of their people tonight father we love you so much and appreciate you and we thank you for your house of worship tonight we ask all these things in the mighty precious name of jesus christ amen amen you can have your seats amen we're just happy to be here tonight um i i missed last wednesday when they were all given testimonies but i was but i was watching in those of you who were at camp we all had such a good time of fellowship and hearing the word our spirits get to listen to all that worship you know there's five six services and all that great worship and all that all those great services back to back then when we come we come home we find ourselves wishing to be back at camp amen uh of course you know we were around friends but you know we were around other believers like-minded people and just gathered together one accord which is awesome one sole purpose and that was to draw closer closer to jesus and that's i think that was the purpose of all of it i want to speak to you tonight on being led to the spirit this message is really close to my heart because of how the lord has been dealing with me over the past few months and especially over the past couple of days brother jason texted me just a few days ago um he was and he asked me uh to take tonight and before before we went to camp before covett and everything happened i was actually scheduled to to to minister that night and i had a sermon on my heart and so when he texted me i i was thought to myself awesome i already have a sermon but uh the lord had other intentions for tonight something that the lord has been personally dealing with me is uh lately on this subject matter itself just being submissive to his leadership um you know as human beings and as christians i believe we all fall short of this you know from time to time but i'm learning that god doesn't want us just to give us a task or a message and then come back when when he has another message or a task for us he wants to be with us through the whole process the whole process he wants to be their friends and so i've been learning that and just been trying to give it to the lord and you know he wants to direct your path he wants you to be a part of he wants to not just be a part of the decision but he wants to be a part of the whole the whole decision-making process amen um we were when we were at the men's meeting a couple a couple of months ago i believe it was i believe it was brother sam browning made a statement and it just really spoke to me it says god never made us to be independent of him in fact the closer you get to god the more you realize just how dependent on him that you need to be amen and that just spoke to my heart because you know young people you know as you get older you have the desire to be more independent of your parents you know you want to get a license and you know you want to get a car and you want to be able to drive yourself around and you want to have a job so you can have your own money and those things are natural you know that's great um i remember feeling that way too but now i look back and i'm like uh it was so great to not worry about bills or a mortgage or going to work so i'm thankful for those times amen but even though it's natural for us to grow up and you know and gain responsibility get married and you know have a place to live and be independent of our parents here on earth it should never be like that with our heavenly father amen he's here to do what it says in psalms 140 and that's to teach us to do his will and lead us into the land of uprightness just a little um thank you just a little personal testimony i had just being led of the spirit a few months back i i had an opportunity to do this little this little part-time job and um i didn't i didn't pray about it i didn't i just i applied and i got hired and um it was going i was going through the process and one night i was laying in bed i was actually at work and you know they had already hired me but i was just laying in bed and the lord started to really check my heart he's you know where where do i need to use that yeah okay can i just give you this then yeah okay all right yeah amen got some technical difficulties that's all right though perfect old-fashioned amen um but i was just laying there that night and i was just praying and the lord really started dealing with me started checking my heart and just saying you know how how are you you know you you've got your family at home now you're going to have this newborn and you you know you're you're doing the school you're doing these things and now you want to get a part-time job you know you don't it's not something that you need to do lord he was just really checking my heart he's like you didn't even ask me about this you didn't you didn't pray about it you didn't lay it before me you didn't do anything and i was just laying there and i was i had a serious conviction on my heart i was wow lord i'm sorry you know i'm sorry i did this and i just was praying and i i was just trying you know i was saying well maybe i just won't do it very often or i'm just trying to you know how we do kind of scapegoat around it a little bit you know i'm sorry lord but you know but the lord doesn't like butts amen so he was just dealing with me on that and so finally i just i lifted my hands i said lord i won't take it if this is something you know i'll call him you know tomorrow and i'll you know i'll say i decline it or and i'll have to go through that that awkward phone call that that awkward conversation um but friends you know the lord works in peculiar ways in mysterious ways and that makes us because we have the holy spirit it causes us to be peculiar amen and so i did i had to have a weird phone call an awkward conversation but it was it was led of the lord amen um uh it's just what a little bit of what i want to get into tonight just um how the spirit spirit-led lives of you know holy ghost-filled christians are often very peculiar so oftentimes a task that the lord has in store for our lives we feel unfit for and unready to do and another thing that was spoken at that meeting um in certain situations if you know if you're going through something or if if you feel like you're in a place that you shouldn't be in uh if you're unfit to do that task the lord the lord's ways are higher than our our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts so he'll if he places you into a position to do something or to be somebody then and and it's of him and it's and you're being spirit-led even if you feel unfit he will prepare you he will do on-the-job training amen and i thought that spoke to my heart a lot yeah i definitely don't feel like i need to be up here but he's doing all the job training amen so i'm just praising god for that satan has specific attacks that he uses to get us out of the will of god to question our faith to destroy our confidence in the leading of the lord he uses doubt um you know in the garden of eden uses reasoning he uses uneasiness he uses fear of the unknown like what pastor was talking about on sunday and the list just goes on and on and on um there's this there's this evangelist i was uh brother paula fontaine actually quoted him and so i started doing a little bit of research on him his name is watchman knee watchman knee was a faithful chinese evangelist in the early part of the 20th century and he dedicated his life to the work of gosp of the gospel in china in the 1930s and 40s watchmen actually had a you know faithful ministry of the gospel with his brothers in shanghai china where they labor for the lord but in 1949 which is near the end of the second world war and now the nationalist government of china fell and the struggle for christians in that country really began but his the burden was still upon his heart he was still a spirit-led christian and he still had that burden so at that time watchmen sent his brothers actually one of his brother's names was witness which is cool he sent his brothers that were faithfully working with him in the gospel at that time in taiwan he sent them to taiwan but he had a burden on his heart to return to mainland china where all the controversy was going on where where that government had fallen and to continue the work there by the leading of the holy spirit amen in an attempt to get his brother not to return to the to to the mainland um watchman's brother witness sent this advisement and but received a peculiar response he said before brother knee left hong kong brother lee advised him many times not to return to the mainland but brother nee said if a mother discovered that her house was on fire and she herself was outside the house doing the laundry what would she do although she realized the danger would she not rush into her home although i know that my return is fraught with dangers i know that many brothers and sisters are still inside how can i not return and that spoke to my heart so vastly because this is this is happening you know 75 years ago friends this isn't you know this isn't hundreds and hundred years ago in this in the bible this is this is happening now watchmen knee was arrested in 1952 because of his professed faith in christ so he was there evangelizing for two years doing a work and as well um he he had because of his professed faith in christ and his leadership in the local churches he was falsely condemned judged and sit sentenced in 1956 to 15 years of imprisonment although prisons didn't allow him to mention the lord's name in his letters his final letter written on the day of his death he alluded to the joy in the lord and it says in my sickness i still remain joyful at heart couldn't say the name of the lord but he used a scripture he used philippians 4 4 where it says rejoice in the lord always in my sickness i remain joyful at heart and watchman knee was practicing that word from apostle paul by the time watchman knee was arrested in 1952 listen to this friends approximately 400 local churches had been raised up in china in addition over 30 local churches had been raised up in the philippines and in singapore in malaysia and thailand and indonesia because why because he followed the leadership of the holy spirit amen simply put so this is one of his writings i have a few a few of his writings here but one of his writing says put verily very simply we were just talking about the devices that satan uses in in our lives amen put very simply satan's power in the world is everywhere yet wherever men and women walk in the spirit sensitive to the anointing they have from god that power of his of satan's just evaporates there is a line drawn there by god a boundary where by virtue of his own very presence satan's writ does not run let god occupy all the space himself and what room is left for the evil one amen friends what room is left for the evil one another one says it is imperative that believers recognize a spirit exists within them friends we have to recognize it is imperative it is it is it is so important to recognize that a holy spirit lives inside of you and if something extra is thought knowledge and imagination of the mind something beyond affection beyond sensation and pleasure of emotion something additional to desire decision and action of will it says god's children must be very humble before him and seek to know the teaching of the bible and the functioning of the spirit through the holy spirit in order that they may walk in the spirit amen we have to be very humble and to know that in order to walk in the spirit through the holy spirit we have to seek him amen this last one is where i kind of want to pivot here the book of acts is the best aid this is something that washmani said he says the book of acts is the best aid in approaching our work we do not find there anyone consecrating himself as a preacher nor anyone deciding to do the lord's work by making himself a missionary or a pastor amen he's talking about the book of acts what we do see is the holy spirit himself appointing and sending men out to do the work amen that's what we that's what we see in the book of acts and in this quotation it leads me to the thought that being spirit-led a spirit-led christian is supposed to closely resemble the book of acts church amen friends we're supposed to be living right now in the book of acts church the early apostles in acts had freshly received the greatest gift they had ever been given amen the holy spirit and that was their guide to preach the gospel amen let's look in acts 9 you guys if you want to turn with me you can it's in acts 9 and verse 1 but it's a familiar story so you don't have to turn with me but it it talks on the conversion of of saul saul was on the road to damascus with intentions of how the scripture states yeah let's turn it let's turn actually amen it's acts chapter 9 just so we get a little outline of what's going on here in acts chapter 9 and verse 1 the conversion and saul yet breathing out so this was saul on the road to damascus and on on his way on his way to damascus his thought and his intention was to breathe out threatenings and to to slaughter the disciples of the lord that was that was his intention that would that was what he was that was what he was going to do amen but friends a light shine down we're all familiar with the story a light shine down friends and blinded saul and gave him instructions he said he said lord what will i do he said go forward and wait amen so a few verses later we we see that ananias sees a vision from the lord and he says to go unto saul and pray for him and instruct him on what on what to do but ananias knew who saul was and what he had done amen he saw he knew that saul was a murderer he knew that saul hated jesus and he knew how evil he was but the lord said to an eyes go anyway amen it was a peculiar thing to do and then friends we we read in um our opening verse in peter you know we're we're a set apart nation we're a peculiar people friends i'm going to say that word a lot peculiar i i had to practice it a lot because it's a hard word to say but peculiar we are a very peculiar people amen ananias heeded to the lord's call and went to saul he prayed over him and he was filled with the holy ghost and that's in acts 9 17 amen friends he heeded what did he do he heeded to the call amen friends a few chapters later we're just kind of building up to something here a few chapters later paul was converted and now preaching the very name he persecuted just a few days earlier obviously he didn't have the credibility because of of his reputation but then another faithful servant of the cross which actually becomes his companion later on barnabas by the unusual leadings of the holy ghost sticks up for paul in verse 27 of acts chapter 9 and it was another peculiar thing that happened he was led by the holy spirit to change the course of history amen moving forward in chapters 15 chapters 15 and 16 specifically we see that paul now on his second missionary journey had already gone on one he had already given his heart to god he had already received the gift of the holy ghost he had this intention to go on a journey and the intention was to go into each city where he had previously been on his first missionary trip and to see how they were doing but the holy spirit had other plans amen he had other plans for tonight he had other plans for paul amen of course they made plans to go to a certain province but in acts chapter 16 verses 6 through 8 we can turn there if we want they were kept from preaching a certain in a certain part of asia let's let's turn friends in acts chapter 16 verses 6 through 8 it says now when they had gone throughout uh fergia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia after they were come to my asia they assayed to go to bithya but the spirit suffered them not the spirit had other intentions and they passing by maija came to treos so they came into this place into treos and during paul's time in treos him and his companion were at a loss of where to go next their original plan had changed and their route was going into a different direction and they they didn't they didn't know they were they were hanging on by by the leading of the spirit amen friends that night after praying and waiting on the lord which is exactly what we're supposed to do in every situation that's exactly what paul did he was praying and he was waiting on the lord paul went to lay his head to rest after after praying after talking with talking with his companion i think he was with timothy he was talking and they were just what are we going to do i don't know the lord hasn't spoke to me what do you think what do you think you should do what where do you think we should go i'm not sure we're just going to wait on the lord amen so they waited on the lord paul went to go lay his head to rest when a vision appeared to him and i want you to i want you to focus in on here now a man of macedonia appeared to him and says in in verse 9 a vision appeared to paul in the night and there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over in macedonia and help us after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them friends they were led of the spirit to go into this place into macedonia they were in a strange land and just for active drama you know they probably hadn't showered in weeks food was scarce but none of that mattered to them the only thing that mattered was the gospel the gospel needs to get to wherever the lord has it to go amen friends they were learning to be subject to his leading they were learning to be completely dependent on him remember friends we cannot be independent of god we have to be dependent on him that's the way we have to live we have to be completely reliant on his leading even in times when it seems so peculiar amen we want to do you want to know the outcome of that trip the outcome of that trip is they obeyed the vision they went into macedonia which is specifically into three places which we all are familiar with philippi thessalonika and corinth do those things those three things sound familiar thessalonians corinthians philippians we wouldn't have those scriptures in the bible we wouldn't have we wouldn't have that encouragement if the if they hadn't heeded to the call of the holy spirit to go into macedonia and to say these things and do these things and then friends they were called this area today this is what this is what got me friends this area today is still now known as the gateway into europe historians say that up until that point the gospel had been limited to just asia and many historians credit paul's heeding to that macedonian call with the spread of christianity into europe and the entire western world all because ananias and paul heeded to this the leading of the holy spirit they got they got the gospel into a place it had never been before friends they a simple messenger subjected himself to the leadings of the holy spirit and spread the gospel into the part of the world it had not yet been praised the name of god that is imagine friends if he did that with them back then what his spirit can lead each and every one of us to do right now today we have to we have to just heed that word that word heed is talked a lot about in the bible it just take notice of we have to take notice of his leading his call his spirit amen i want to take a look at another story that while we're going forward in gideon let's turn to um gideon in this uh the book of judges i'm sorry the book of judges the sixth chapter amen this has been this book this story had been has been speaking to me actually a lot lately about in a lot of different ways but tonight how it spoke to me specifically was being led of the lord so gideon a little background with gideon he was an uneducated farmer from the country it talks about in verse in chapter 6 unequipped in his own mind to save israel from the hand of the midianites the lord appeared to him an angel appeared before gideon and said thou mighty man of valor i have a task for you to do you're going to save the you're going to save um yeah we can turn first i think he just had it verse 12. the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor the lord um in verse 14 the lord looked upon him and said go this thou might thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have i not sent thee some bible commentary i was reading goes through the story of gideon and actually considers gideon to be a coward with no faith now i want you to just think about that for a second friends because we're going to go into to the reasons why but from carnal eyes with these three reasons it actually starts to make sense reasoning starts to kick in and it was like wow maybe he was a coward but from carnalize you look but from spiritual eyes you look and you're like so the first thing that gideon does he asks for a sign in verse 17 that the angel had actually talked to him and he said unto him if now i if i have found grace in my sight show me a sign that thou talkest to me second he laid a fleece before the lord in verses 36 and 37 and asked for a clear-cut sign that it was his direction and commission to lead israel into victory we can turn there in verse 30 verse 36 and verse 37 it says and gideon said unto god if thou will save israel by mine hand as thou has said i will uh behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the even the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand hast thou has said and what did god do the lord granted his request his circumstances dictated his action friends he had something he had a great task to be done he was an uneducated farmer that the lord spoke to and said you are going to go before israel or you're going to take israel and you're going to deliver them out of the hand of the midianites what do you mean lord i'm a i'm a farmer how do you expect me to do this so he you know what he does he doesn't he doesn't just accept the first sign he doesn't just accept the second sign with the fleece he lays another fleece before the lord but this time he asked it to be done the opposite way of the first fleece just so he knew that it was the lord the lord's direction and guess what god did the lord granted his request once more his circumstances dictated his action friends put yourself in his shoes he was asked by the lord to lead that army when the angel appeared unto gideon god already knew his attributes he already knew the very first thing he said to him he said gideon thou art a mighty man of valor how do you know that if he if he didn't see his spirit within him you may even get to a point to think like those commentators did i was reading and you know he had to lay a fleece before the lord and he had to you know he had to have the angel perform a sign and and he had to lay another fleece before the lord and i mean god had already given his word you know gideon already had the instruction does that sometimes happen in our lives god has already given you a word he has already given you instruction why did he lack faith to move forward with the plan god had given him why why why did he lack that faith friends if you ask me laying out the fleece before the lord didn't question his faith it proved his faith it proved that he wanted to be completely led by the lord and not do anything until he was sure it was god speaking to him amen a great task was placed upon him and he wanted to ensure that it was the lord's perfect will and not his own amen friends i'm so many times we i think that of that story and with carnal eyes you look at it you had to lay these he wanted to be completely led of the lord he had a great task at hand we have a great task at hand in these last days i want to be completely led of the lord i don't want to go on my own path i don't want to do my own thing i don't want to make my own decisions i don't i don't i i can't because i know that i can't do it i can't do it by my own will i have to do it by his will you know friends there's something that spoke to me that did you know that in hebrews so gideon was talked about in hebrews chapter 11. in hebrews chapter 11 it says you know there is a total of 16 names spoken about in hebrews chapter 11. 16 names i did a little uh research with dr google he helped me out a little bit there's over 3 200 names mentioned in the bible there's like 327 i think don't quote me on that mentioned in the whole bible and 16 made the cut 16 that is less than half of 1 less than half of 1 made the faith hall of fame and guess who was one of them gideon i don't think god makes mistakes do y'all do you think god makes mistakes gideon sought direction from the lord at every step during his commission that's what he did has this happened to you god gives you a great task or a great decision or something that you need to do whatever may be friends god wants to direct your paths he doesn't want to just give you a direction and then you go out and do it on your own he wants to give you direction and then guide you the whole way through it amen friends his confirmation of completing the task many times in our spirit we pray for certain things and ask the lord for direction and what we receive isn't what we want to hear this is something personal to me sometimes i'll pray and in the back of my mind i may already have that decision made up in my mind amen anybody else guilty of that we you know we we want the lord to lead us and we want the lord to guide us but sometimes it's we think we know what's what's best for ourselves amen so we pray because we know we're supposed to but then we step out and and we say okay well you know maybe we receive that that word but it's not exactly the word that we wanted to receive and and it wasn't exactly the way that we wanted to go but we still go the way that we wanted to go anybody guilty that i know i have been and and it's at those times that maybe we might reject the lord's leading a little bit or maybe just sidestep it from what we know is right amen has it i'll be praying about something it may even be something minor but i'll ask for his direction deep down in my heart even though i've known that that decision is already made or if there's something maybe i'm leaning more towards and then god through his holy spirit that each one of us have amen i hope we all have it amen will give me an answer the opposite of what i wanted to hear anybody guilty of that that's happened so many times it's times like that when it is most difficult to follow the leadership the most difficult but god wants to teach us his ways he wants us to learn how to follow every word of god amen you know another thing that you know when we go through things or when we have something in our life that we want to pray about and i i've been guilty of it too um we spend a few minutes in prayer about it you know we wake up in the morning and we you know we ask the lord maybe for 30 seconds lord would you help me with this or would you help me with that and then we have to go through our day you know we got to drive to work and we we have to you know do a certain thing and then we got to come home and we gotta you know maybe make some food and you know maybe you know do something or whatever it is and then we get we get to our our night and we need to relax right so then we you know maybe we might pick up the bible for 10 or 15 minutes or whatever and then maybe before we go to bed we we pray for 30 seconds or maybe for five minutes or maybe for 10 minutes how does the lord know that we're serious when we do that friends how will the lord ever know we're serious if we can't even spend five minutes in prayer with him and i've been guilty of it i'm looking at you but there's a mirror right here i've been so guilty of that so many times i'll spend i have something on my heart maybe that i need the lord to guide me and lead me it's a serious decision or it's a serious task or whatever the case may be and i spend three minutes in the morning and you know four and a half minutes at night maybe throughout the day i'll have it on my mind but am i praying i know the bible says to pray without ceasing but am i praying am i really am i really going before the lord are you going before the lord with this task that's what gideon did he went before the lord with that fleece because he wanted to make sure that his direction was completely led of the spirit amen do we ever really do that do we ever lay that fleece before the lord and say lord is this really what you want me to do is this really the way that you want me to go we need to we need to do that more friends amen i'm guilty i need to do it more we ought to be like gideon more times he had a big battle ahead we have big battles ahead friends i'm gonna tell you right now you've got if you're not in one then you're gonna be in one and if you know if you're not gonna be in one you just came out of one and you're probably in 14 right now amen but we have to be sure and he wanted to be sure i got a personal testimony i wanted to share i was you know talking to my parents about it a little bit and it happened when i was younger so i i needed to refresh myself on it but when i was younger we lived in indiana and my grandpa had just um within the past i don't know the exact timeline but he had closed his church he had he had a lot of sickness so we were going to to churches that were that were hours away um we were going to one church and it was two and a half hours and then we would maybe go for a while to another church but it was it was it was far it was a distance and um we were kind of out of fellowship and so the my dad mama had it on their heart to to put their kids us me and my sister into a place into a church get them into a church that had young people their age amen friends and that's that was a that was a heavy burden on their heart and him and my mom started searching and praying and so he felt like he had to move he wasn't sure yet what that meant or where that where that was to but he but he felt like he had that he had that he had that burden on his heart i need to get them into a church i need to get to him into a place i just don't know where so they started searching they started praying we sold our house and we moved in with our grandparents and we started visiting other churches you know we came here praise the lord and we came we went to arizona and we went to north carolina and we went to a different a bunch of different churches and he just wasn't sure where exactly the lord wanted him he you know he was he was praying and he was searching he was waiting on the lord he was asking for his leadership you know he owned a good business there we had a really nice house from the perspective of anyone looking at the outside when we look at it from carnal eyes it didn't make any sense to move didn't make any sense but friends when you're led of the spirit of the lord it's peculiar amen one day during a service um actually brother jewel was the one that was preaching that service he was feeling my dad was feeling the weight of all these changes and he just wasn't sure exactly what the lord wanted and and you know he had already sold the house and now he what you know we had come and visit here and you know he thought this was the place but that's a big that's a big change you know to move to a different place to move to not having a not knowing where you're supposed to be not having a place lined up not having a job lined up that's a that's a hard place to be in especially as a parent as a father i don't know yet but i will know soon amen two months three months um it was it was a peculiar thing for him and he wasn't sure if it was exactly what the lord wanted friends gideon wasn't sure that it was exactly what the lord wanted so what did he do he desired he desired to be spirit-led no matter how hard it was he was leaving his family we had all of his family live there he was my mom was leaving her family he was leaving a great job a nice house a pretty good life from the outside amen but god had other intentions for us amen praise god that service he was in he was in great travail he was just the lord had placed a heavy burden on him and he just didn't he wasn't sure he just raised his hands and he was just praying and asking and he was waiting on a confirmation he began praying in that service for something specific amen sometimes we need to be specific with god he likes it when we're specific little did he know that my mom was sitting next to him not telling him but praying the exact same prayer that he was praying for the exact same thing you'll never be able to convince me that there is not a leading of the holy spirit when something is placed upon your heart and you are impressed so deeply about something that is the holy spirit and when you know that his spirit led there is not you can't tell me that that isn't the holy spirit amen you can't tell me that that isn't real they prayed that once brother jewell closed that service that he would walk right back to him and then he would lay his hands on him and praise god for a minister who was under the spirit and under the anointing because they prayed that prayer specifically and brother jewell being led by that same spirit that was in both of them did that exact thing he closed the service really quick and i've actually i haven't been in one of brother jewel services in a long time but usually you know he sings after and maybe he'll go back to the office or hell of a prayer line or something but he closed immediately and he gave it back to the song leader he didn't sing any songs and he walked didn't go walk to the back office he walked straight to where my dad was sitting he's laid his hands on him and he just prayed over him friends that was the holy spirit leading him amen friends he closed that service just like gideon my dad didn't know what what the lord desired for him so he wanted to be sure amen friends he wanted to be sure that it was that he was guiding his entire path not just the main decision but every little decision along the way there's a story there's a story that brother benham tells in being led by the spirit in 1950 that really spoke to my heart the other day and it was about brother branham had just come back from he was coming back from a meeting and he was flying from i believe texas back home and some plane troubles happened or some weather happened and the plane had to ground in memphis so when the plane grounded in memphis the airline actually gave him a free a free night at a hotel they gave him a limousine to drive back they gave him the whole nine yards so he went back there and he was just he was writing some letters and he was just praying and he thought oh i'm you know i'm just gonna i'm just gonna write some letters pray and then go to bed so we had an early wake-up call and i think his flight was at seven so he went to bed early and he woke up really early the next morning and he just he had these letters written so he decided he was gonna walk down to the post office that morning before the limousine was gonna come and pick him up to go to his to his flight so he just started walking and he was just walking and all of a sudden something started impressing on him he was just walking he hadn't even made it to the post office yet and he's the lord the holy spirit said turn around go go the other way and he just kept walking sometimes we do that this is a prophet amen this is a prophet and he wasn't sure so he just kept walking kept walking and all of a sudden it it said it again turn around and go the other way so he stopped and he looks into a window and i don't remember what he was looking at but he looks into a window and he just bows his head and he just prays lord is that is that you is that you telling me to go the other way turn back around and the spirit just told him turn around and go the other way there was someone that was patiently waiting that had that same holy spirit in them that was praying that grounded a plane from texas to indiana right in memphis that caused an airline to pay for a hotel because she had a burden upon her heart for her son that was laying in his bed dying on his deathbed she had a burden upon her heart and she believed she he said in the story she believed that the holy spirit was still alive and that it still led people so she believed that so she said that she was praying and that you know the lord how the story exactly goes is um he tells it a in a few different places but you know he he comes up to the he walks finally up to this fence and he sees this old lady and he was just him and a hymn and he walks up to and he sees this old lady and she's just sitting on this hint on this fence and you know she's just tears are just running down her eyes and she says good morning parson he goes good morning ma'am how did how did you know i was a how did you know i was a person that's a minister how did you know i was a minister she said well i just i had a dream the other night that i needed to be here at this certain certain time at this certain certain place because a man a minister was going to walk down and he was going to have a hat that was crooked sideways a little bit he was going to be carrying some letters and he was going to come and be my elijah she was like do you remember that story about the shunamite woman in the in the bible where she was barren and she couldn't have children so she prayed to the lord and and he gave her children he goes oh man yeah i just preached on that not too long ago he goes she goes well i was at shooting my woman i had prayed and the lord had put it upon my heart to pray and the lord gave me my son and i raised him the best that i could but when he got older he got away from the lord he got away from from what was right and he got in with the wrong crowd and he got he got this disease and this venereal disease this social disease and and she just goes on and keeps talking to him and telling him the story and and she says i was just praying the other night you know the doctors have done all that they can for him they've given them all the shots that they know how they sent him on his way and they said that he's just got a few days to live now parson he's sitting in my home right now laying down in a bed of darkness and despair thinking that he is in a ship where there is just darkness and he can't find his way and it just breaks my heart parson he says all right well let's go i you know still in his mind he's thinking is this is this why you is this his plane this is now his hours past where his plane was supposed to supposed to leave he thought oh man well i'll just i'll just catch the next flight so he just follows this little old lady into her her little shack of a house and he they just go in and she sees they see them they see this boy you know just laying down and travail and what was happening everything that she had told him and he just asked her he said will you pray first you know he he said he said i've been in i've been in king's houses kings palaces i've been in you know i've been in the greatest places in the world but i felt more at home in that little shack of that little old woman than i've ever felt in my whole life because the holy spirit was there friends we feel at home and the holy spirit's there if we've got it amen and he just went in and he said he said man we you go ahead and pray and she started praying and he said man it was the anointing was there she knew how to pray knew all the old-fashioned pray she was just praying and she was praying and she gets done praying and he's just lord is you know is this why you had me come here is this is this what you want me to do still questioning so he prays he prays that prayer he just says you know i don't know exactly the prayer he prayed but he prayed and that boy health came back into that boy after that prayer that woman's faith that was led to the holy spirit to have that plane grounded to go to that certain certain place to speak to a certain minister to have him come into his house to pray over her that faith caused that boy to come back from where that place was he was in and he said that he talked to her two years later and that boy was serving the lord and doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing amen friends that can happen with each and every one of us for any request that is that's a story but that can happen if you just place yourself into that position he's the same god he's the same god that does that friends the holy spirit will impress you friends to do certain things and it's peculiar it makes us do peculiar things that we just don't understand it didn't make sense for him to turn around and go the other way he didn't have time he had 15 20 minutes to go to the post office and to do this and then he needed to get back to catch a taxi to go fly home because he had just been on all these meetings but that's not what the holy spirit had intended holy spirit the holy spirit didn't didn't care about what time he needed to be home he cared they she cared about that that woman's request because she was in travail she had a request upon her heart friends when you have a request upon your heart and you lay it before the lord and you ask and you know that you're going to receive when you ask then he'll do something for you we have to be sensitive to his leading we have to be sensitive to the leading of the spirit it's a dynamic process always moving always flowing even a prophet of god we notice in that story even a prophet of god at times was unclear if he was doing what the lord's will was he wasn't sure you know gideon wasn't sure paul wasn't positive but we're impressed a certain way to do a certain thing and if we step out on faith and do that thing as long as we're sensitive and we have him direct our whole path the whole way then he will lead and guide us every step of the way amen we just have to be sensitive to the leading of his spirit hallelujah friends oh praise god paul once said in calling jesus on the scene 1963 paul said the life that i once live i live no more not me but the christ that lives in me that's it he had just passed from death unto life and christ was alive in him safely secured christ was the one guiding the ship paul just had to sit in it still and obey notice god will make our bodies obey him and he just said in saint john the sixth chapter he eats my flesh and drinks my blood he has everlasting life and i will raise him up in the last day think of it friends our bodies obey when we have no more control over it and turns back to a spoonful of dust god will speak to that body and it will rise up again in the likeness of the resurrected jesus christ what are you worrying about it is in the hands of god let's go amen he will rise it up what day he promised to do it that's thus saith the lord he's written it in his word what are you scared about in this little ship he is in it friends he was in it with paul friends he was in it with gideon he was in it with ananias he was in it with my dad he was in it with me he's in it with you friends he's in that ship remember jesus said to follow me and get rid of what you got follow me that's the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he gives this man it was the only rhythm that he gives businessman it's the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes his decision so it's perfect every time and we must follow him it's the only way to have eternal life so the leadership of god is listen to this the leadership of god is to follow the vindicated word of the hour by the holy ghost by the leading of the holy ghost that was from leadership 1965. that's exactly what watchmen knee had to do he had to follow the leadership of the lord and even though he went and put he was put in prison he was doing a work and a service for the lord god and that was the way that he was supposed to go he died amen no one around me maybe you have recently dedicated your life to god or rededicated your life to god or you want his leadership in something in your life that's going on amen friends are any of us in that any of those boats i know that i'm in i'm in that boat a lot i want his leadership maybe you're going through something whatever your case is just stand with me tonight whatever your case is whatever it is that is weighing upon your heart god has a remedy just lift your hands up with me tonight we're going to apply proverbs 3 to our lives right now to trust in the lord with all thine heart to lean not on thine own understanding and we're gonna acknowledge him in all of our ways so that he will direct our paths does anybody else have that desire in their hearts tonight i know i do we need to learn to completely lean on jesus and learn to listen to that thing that impresses you amen no matter how peculiar that it may sound let the holy spirit lead you amen friends if we just want to bow our heads tonight even while preparing for this service the holy spirit was leading me in a different way than i thought i was going to go i was so impressed to go down this path i was so stricken to go down this different path and lord i thank you for your spirit lord i lift up my hands tonight and i thank you for your healing lord i want you to be a part of every aspect of my life i want you to be the center of it all lord and i'm learning lord i i'm young i'm learning lord it doesn't matter what age we are we're learning we're learning to be led of your spirit every day father god and we we make we make decisions we have to make we have to make decisions we have flaws we have slip ups the same satan fights us every step of the way but father god when we have the holy spirit inside of us lord to even if we make a wrong decision like i did i was talking about i made a wrong decision but lord you corrected me lord sometimes we just need a little bit of that correction lord and the holy spirit will do that father god but i pray that tonight that we can be so led of the spirit lord god that we don't have to look back on something and change it but we can look forward before it happens and just know that it's your will lord i want to be completely in your will lord just like paul was father god lord god he was in completely in trails he was he wanted to be in your will father god and what did it cause it caused him to go into a place that the gospel had never yet been father god i pray that right now to that you would lead and guide each and every one of us father into your perfect place lord that your holy spirit would lead and guide us father god if we're maybe off the beaten path a little bit maybe if we have made a decision that we shouldn't have lord maybe if we have a decision ahead of us or we have a task or we have a position or whatever it is lord jesus i pray that lord god you would as brother branham said would just impress upon our hearts lord he just imp just impress upon our hearts to do your will father god and maybe turn around and just go the other way father god i lift up my hands tonight and i'm just so thankful father to be in your presence tonight lord it's such a special place to be lord there's no other place that i'd rather be lord i was just sitting in the back and i was just praying and lord my soul prayer was that you would get glory tonight in the service lord god and that your message would be spoken father father i pray that it can just be a blessing tonight lord father god as we go out of these places we have to go to our homes and our jobs tomorrow lord god just let your holy spirit lead us father let us just be in that channel lord god just forgive us of our any hindrances forgive us of anything our failures everything lord lord as we lift up our hands tonight lord i just just pray that your spirit would lead in guide every step that we take right now i pray this in the name of jesus christ amen hey man thank you friends [Music] [Music] let's raise our hands now finding [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm learning to leave [Music] let's raise our hands and sing that again now i'm learning to leave [Music] jesus finding more power than i'd ever dreamed i'm learning to [Music] you know the lord wanted to speak tonight and i believe that he did amen i believe that the lord had a something that maybe you know as the phrase says still water goes deep runs deep and it was maybe something that you've heard something that was simple but yet so profound i believe the lord spoke to hearts because there were people praying maybe out there in this church maybe you were praying about something asking the lord to come by and speak to you and lord used our brother caleb amen here tonight thank you brother caleb amen for yielding to the holy spirit i love that so much and brother adam said he's the same god the same god that grounded a plane you know i was hearing that story even just a few i remember hearing that a few months ago and brother branham said that little auntie was praying and brother adam said how did you know i was a person she said well in that dream i seen a man in a tan suit had a western hat on had papers in his hand and you match that description now brother branham had no idea when he was putting on that tan suit he had no idea he was him a prophet was walking in a vision not even aware of it didn't know when he put on that tan suit his hat crooked a certain way had papers in his hand and yet the lord was meeting a need because there was someone praying for god to move on the scene and the lord used a yielded vessel how many want to be a yielded vessel amen amen just like that to answer that woman's prayer amen i believe that the lord is the same god here tonight amen he leads us sons of god are led by the spirit of god i just want to say lord let me be sensitive enough and my spirit to be led by your spirit get me out of the way lord amen we want to take up the request here tonight not going to gather here we have
