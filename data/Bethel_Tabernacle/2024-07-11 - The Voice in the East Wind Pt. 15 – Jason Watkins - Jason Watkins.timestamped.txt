[46:44] the contradiction of
[46:46] Christ you know the contradiction of

[46:51] that God would take a completely

[46:55] person convict him as a sinner send him
[46:59] to hell that's what brother Bram said he
[47:02] never committed a sin but he became sin

[47:07] brandom said as a sinner and sent him to
[47:09] Hell friends you and I never have to go
[47:12] there because of that and God traded the
[47:15] completely innocent for the totally
[47:17] guilty now how many convicts I got in
[47:20] here tonight oh come on come on every
[47:24] one of you you were born a convict

[48:25] girl very in very bad sit situation and

[48:30] amazing
[48:32] way Romans chap 5 we're going to take
[48:35] part 15 tonight y'all ready for
[48:39] that amen how many more parts brother
[48:46] Jason let's
[48:48] um amen let's begin now of course Romans
[48:52] 5 is where you know Paul's talking about
[48:54] where we're justified by the blood of
[48:56] Christ aren't you glad for that amen
[48:58] that's what brother Tony was singing
[48:59] about amen Paid a Debt that I couldn't
[49:02] pay so verse
[49:04] n much more then being now justified by
[49:09] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[49:13] through him that's almost enough to
[49:15] shout and go home for if now catch this
[49:19] if when we were enemies we were
[49:20] reconciled to God by death by the death
[49:23] of his son now notice he didn't say you
[49:26] you got reconciled when you repented at
[49:29] an
[49:30] altar you're reconciled in Christ 2,000
[49:33] years ago see watch all right for if
[49:36] when we were enemies we were reconciled
[49:39] to God by the death of his son much more
[49:42] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[49:44] his life and not only so but we also joy
[49:48] in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[49:50] whom we have now received the atonement
[49:53] so there's a lot a lot a lot of joy to
[49:55] be had in the knowledge of the atonement
[49:58] we're going to be preaching along those
[50:00] lines tonight verse
[50:02] 12 wherefore as by one man sin had
[50:05] entered into the world and death by sin
[50:07] and so death passed upon all men for
[50:09] that all have sinned for until the law
[50:12] sin was in the world but sin is not
[50:14] imputed when there is no law
[50:16] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[50:18] Moses even over them that had not sinned
[50:21] after the similitude of Adam's
[50:22] transgressions who is the figure of him
[50:25] that was to come but not is the offense
[50:28] so also is the free gift for if through
[50:30] the offense of one many be dead which is
[50:33] true much more the grace of God and the
[50:36] gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus
[50:39] Christ hath abounded unto many and not
[50:43] as it was by one that sins so is the
[50:46] gift for the Judgment was by one to
[50:49] condemnation but the free gift is of
[50:51] many offenses under justification for If
[50:54] by one man's offense death reigned by
[50:56] one much more they which receive
[51:00] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[51:04] righteousness righteousness shall reign
[51:07] in life by one Jesus Christ
[51:10] therefore as by the offense of one
[51:12] judgment Came Upon all men to
[51:15] condemnation even so by the
[51:17] righteousness of one the free gift came
[51:20] upon all men under justification of life
[51:24] for as by one man's Disobedience many
[51:26] were made made Sinners so by The
[51:27] Obedience of one shall many be made
[51:29] righteous moreover the law entered that
[51:33] the offense might abound but where sin
[51:36] abounded thank God grace did much more
[51:40] abound that as Sin hath reigned unto
[51:43] death even so might grace Reign through
[51:46] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[51:49] Christ Our Lord let's
[51:52] pray father we thank you for your word
[51:55] Lord we read it
[51:57] it's almost too good to be true at times
[51:59] Lord we stand here tonight so aware of
[52:02] that and as I've pondered Lord this
[52:05] material for weeks now Lord and all
[52:08] throughout the day today particularly
[52:10] Lord focusing on it over and over and
[52:13] over again Lord I would read across it
[52:16] and just try
[52:17] to comprehend what it is you have done
[52:20] for us Lord it it defies all expectation
[52:24] we who had a right to expect nothing but
[52:28] death and destruction Lord and somehow
[52:31] someway through some
[52:34] Supernatural otherworldly power we find
[52:37] ourselves on the way to heaven Lord it
[52:40] just seems astonishing to us and I pray
[52:42] tonight if I'm able to accomplish
[52:44] anything at all Lord it will be to
[52:47] astonish the people Lord you can you can
[52:50] you can it was said to me once by a
[52:52] foreigner she said it quite sincerely
[52:55] not trying to insult me she said you
[52:57] cannot Amaze Americans by anything but
[53:00] Lord may we be amazed tonight may we be
[53:03] astonished father at what you have done
[53:05] for us I commit myself into your hands
[53:09] for service to this end in Jesus name
[53:12] amen God bless you friends you can be
[53:17] seated Hallelujah
[53:33] amen praise the
[53:38] Lord several other requests that came in
[53:40] I'll get to those just in a minute just
[53:43] to preach to you a little bit amen
[53:48] now the last time we
[53:52] were preaching along part 14
[53:56] was Sunday or the Sunday previous I
[53:59] should say and we were trying to get you
[54:03] to understand how
[54:06] that when brother Brandon would say that
[54:09] the bride is ordained to not
[54:14] fall and that she is predestinated to
[54:17] stand and we were making the point that
[54:21] not only is she predestinated to stand
[54:25] but she's predestinated to stand
[54:28] victoriously and you know sometimes if
[54:31] we're If we're honest we don't always
[54:33] feel super
[54:35] Victorious you say well what happened to
[54:37] the predestination of God what happened
[54:39] I thought I was ordained to not fall why
[54:42] do I constantly seem to stumble and slip
[54:46] up I thought am I not ordained you know
[54:49] was either was brother bradam wrong or
[54:51] am I not in that number and I want to
[54:54] tell you that neither of those are true
[54:56] there's something else that we were
[54:58] trying to get you to understand what
[55:01] it's based on and that is I want to come
[55:04] tonight to the second half of what it's
[55:06] based on now give me my PowerPoint uh
[55:09] brother Josh want to uh look straight
[55:12] into some quotes that I did not put up
[55:15] last time we we put them up this time
[55:18] and I want to go over them and read them
[55:21] for you and have you read them along
[55:23] with me because we want to just review
[55:26] quick ly what the first half was and to
[55:29] cut to the chase the first half as
[55:31] you're going to remember from a couple
[55:34] of Sundays ago is that that you're
[55:38] you're ordained to to not fall because
[55:42] the seed that you're feeding on is not
[55:46] doesn't have fall in it and every seed
[55:50] brings forth of its kind and so when you
[55:52] eat the book you're becoming the book
[55:55] when you eat the seed of the word of God
[55:57] you become the word of God and your
[56:00] mistakes and your let me just keep with
[56:04] that word because that's the word
[56:05] brother bradam uses your mistakes not
[56:08] withstanding nothing changes what God
[56:11] has determined about his
[56:14] family so that was the first part we
[56:17] were really laboring to show you in the
[56:19] word of God why brother Brandon would
[56:22] say she's ordained to not fall she's
[56:26] predestinated to stand there see and
[56:29] it's not because you're we're we're all
[56:31] the time super people but it's God has
[56:35] declared it by his word and that seed
[56:38] that you're feeding on is the same
[56:42] genetic material of the gene of God
[56:45] that's in you which is the same genetic
[56:48] material that the Bible is made out of
[56:50] which is the same genetic material that
[56:53] the Holy Ghost is which is the same
[56:55] genetic material IAL that your new body
[56:57] will
[56:59] be so we're not talking about that we
[57:01] became children of God we only found out
[57:04] we always had been and the life of the
[57:06] Holy Ghost is you cooperating in the
[57:09] vision you don't always get it right but
[57:11] the vision don't change am amen see so
[57:15] now watch and I'm going to read through
[57:17] these quickly because we've already
[57:19] covered them and I don't want to spend
[57:20] more than about 10 minutes in rehearsal
[57:23] so brother brandham we're talking about
[57:24] seeds coming forth so brother Brandon
[57:27] makes this statement he says and
[57:29] everything this is after the Garden of
[57:31] Eden this is on the seventh day God has
[57:33] rested everything under control to bring
[57:35] forth of its kind now remember when he
[57:37] put the seed in the Earth the seed can
[57:39] only come forth with the power of life
[57:41] within it to transform it from seed to a
[57:44] plant listen friends regardless of your
[57:48] weakness and regardless of the devil's
[57:50] tyranny you can't not be a believer
[57:56] there is something inside you that
[57:58] shouts amen even when your when your
[58:02] human mind says but I'm not meeting the
[58:06] great and I just I'm unworthy and I I I
[58:09] don't have the goods it's not it's not
[58:11] anything you've done it's this is
[58:13] something God has determined before the
[58:16] foundation of the
[58:18] world so he says the seed can only come
[58:22] forth with the power of life within it I
[58:25] love that statement to transform it from
[58:27] a seed to a plant or whatever it was so
[58:30] you were going to get transformed from a
[58:32] sinner to a saint you were that was it
[58:34] that was a done deal the day you were
[58:36] born amen his transforming power because
[58:40] you became a good guy no because of his
[58:42] transforming power because I can because
[58:45] I'm super a super strong Christian no
[58:47] because of his transforming power see no
[58:51] God put the seed in there with
[58:54] potentials that it would be what he said
[58:56] it would be as long as it stayed in its
[58:58] right category it would be exactly what
[59:00] God said it would be this is why I've
[59:02] said that that your mission agents
[59:06] should you choose to
[59:09] accept don't worry I'm not going to
[59:12] self-destruct your mission should you
[59:14] choose to AC to accept is to line up
[59:17] your life in the line and Order of God's
[59:19] word and the seed will take care of
[59:22] itself you don't even have to chase
[59:24] God's will you don't have to worry about
[59:26] you don't have to wonder about it you
[59:28] just line up your life and you say well
[59:30] I'm trying to do that I don't always get
[59:32] it right well then try again and keep
[59:34] trying and just keep trying because it's
[59:36] not wins and losses it's the fight he's
[59:39] looking for it's faith in your heart
[59:41] brother brandom said it what you want to
[59:45] be I want to be quite a
[59:48] bit quite a bit more than I find myself
[59:51] to
[59:52] be it had to be that way because he had
[59:56] made it that way and made a channel see
[59:58] God's word once he does once he does it
[1:00:01] he can't ever change his mind you can't
[1:00:04] say he had a bad idea when he gave you a
[1:00:06] gene of God see so that anything that
[1:00:11] stays in his channel in his line of word
[1:00:14] it will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:00:15] his word said it would do it cannot move
[1:00:17] from there it's Channel just exactly
[1:00:19] right so with everything and Trust in
[1:00:21] his own son that it be that way then God
[1:00:23] said it's all good so I'll just rest and
[1:00:26] each and each of those seeds has power
[1:00:30] in itself to transform itself into the
[1:00:33] speci that I desired it to be please
[1:00:37] stop doubting God because of your
[1:00:42] weaknesses say Amen to every word God
[1:00:46] said you're an overcomer then say it so
[1:00:49] I don't feel like a Christian let the
[1:00:50] weak say I'm strong say I I want the
[1:00:53] Holy Ghost brother said then say you've
[1:00:55] got it and just believe it and then
[1:00:56] you'll have it because faith comes by
[1:00:59] hearing and then by our by the
[1:01:01] confession of our lips that's where you
[1:01:04] hear recognize and act upon the word of
[1:01:07] God so we got to put the devil to
[1:01:09] silence friends put him to silence in
[1:01:13] your life stop letting him accuse and
[1:01:16] harass you because of your human
[1:01:19] frailties because you got a ton of
[1:01:22] them
[1:01:23] see all right this is rigged election so
[1:01:28] just enjoy
[1:01:30] it so he says that's what it must be
[1:01:34] because I have given every seed
[1:01:37] transforming power to make out of itself
[1:01:41] in its potentials now to make out of
[1:01:43] itself exactly what I want it to be he
[1:01:45] goes to the church age book whatever
[1:01:48] seed started the church will come forth
[1:01:50] and be like the Original Seed because it
[1:01:52] is the same seed now this is exactly why
[1:01:56] we had to have a message because we had
[1:01:57] to have we had to get back to the
[1:01:59] original
[1:02:00] seed why would we need to get back to
[1:02:02] the original seed cuz we are Original
[1:02:05] Seed and we're predestined to go in a
[1:02:08] Rapture but since faith comes by hearing
[1:02:11] how's he going to get this seed in a
[1:02:13] Rapture he's going to bring back a word
[1:02:16] with the same genetic makeup as the gene
[1:02:19] inside you and the same Holy Spirit this
[1:02:22] brother brandham said this is the spirit
[1:02:24] in word form
[1:02:26] see so it's it's working this way
[1:02:29] regardless of whether the devil likes it
[1:02:31] or not now I'm I'm glad that it that it
[1:02:34] that it causes us to strain at it it
[1:02:39] does does me when I think of my own
[1:02:41] frailties and I say this is too rigged
[1:02:43] this is too stacked this is too unfair
[1:02:46] but you have to understand that when he
[1:02:49] sits on his throne and you're sitting
[1:02:51] there with him he's not going to
[1:02:53] entertain a an objection from
[1:02:56] Lucifer you understand so his his word
[1:03:00] is so case closed that even on that day
[1:03:04] when you read in the Bible that Lucifer
[1:03:06] is brought before him Lucifer does not
[1:03:09] try to raise a railing accusation
[1:03:11] against the family Seated on the throne
[1:03:13] he tried that in Zachariah and the Lord
[1:03:16] told him don't ever do that again get
[1:03:18] out of get out of here and don't ever
[1:03:19] accuse my family of that again it's all
[1:03:22] based on God's choosing say I chose to
[1:03:25] be Christian you did not you only chose
[1:03:28] to surrender you were already a child of
[1:03:31] God see all right whatever seed started
[1:03:35] the church so see this is why we had to
[1:03:37] have a message of restoration it will
[1:03:39] come forth and be like the Original Seed
[1:03:41] because it's the same seed in these last
[1:03:44] days the true bride Church Christ seed
[1:03:47] will come to The Headstone and she will
[1:03:49] be the Super Church a super race as she
[1:03:51] nears him they and the bride will be so
[1:03:54] much like him they will be in his very
[1:03:56] image this is
[1:03:58] non-negotiable this is not going to
[1:04:01] happen if you agree that it's going to
[1:04:03] happen this is going to happen see and
[1:04:06] so your best course is to start lining
[1:04:10] your life up with the word of God so
[1:04:12] that you're agreeing with the vision
[1:04:14] because it gets rough if you don't do
[1:04:16] that but you're ordained to do that
[1:04:20] amen there's plenty of Believers in here
[1:04:23] tonight who could raise their hand and
[1:04:25] say
[1:04:26] you know God brought me through a lot of
[1:04:29] my own rebellion and I really paid a
[1:04:31] heavy price that I wish I would have
[1:04:33] never had to pay amen how many old
[1:04:36] sinners we got in here that will say
[1:04:37] that say my goodness I I paid a heavy
[1:04:40] price why wouldn't he just leave me
[1:04:42] alone that's not that's not an option
[1:04:45] see every seed that the father gave him
[1:04:47] is coming all right he goes on there is
[1:04:51] in order this is in order to be United
[1:04:55] with him they will be one they will be
[1:04:57] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:04:58] the Living God denominations cannot
[1:05:00] produce this and this is such a sensible
[1:05:03] answer why can denominations of good
[1:05:05] people not produce this because it's an
[1:05:07] ad mixture it's a Mongol seed it's a
[1:05:10] it's got truth and error and that could
[1:05:12] never produce a Rapture that could never
[1:05:15] produce a body change that's
[1:05:18] impossible understand it it's got to
[1:05:21] come back to the original word that Paul
[1:05:24] swed for the the Christian Church it
[1:05:27] cannot deviate from that in any way
[1:05:30] shape or form so it doesn't matter that
[1:05:33] that I mean if churches want to survive
[1:05:37] why has the church nominal compromised
[1:05:41] with the political and social agendas of
[1:05:44] the world es especially starting in the
[1:05:47] 20th century and that's where you begin
[1:05:49] to see the the falling away of
[1:05:51] old-fashioned standards of Holiness that
[1:05:54] had been standards for 20 centuries and
[1:05:57] suddenly people want to say well you're
[1:06:01] misin spurge did did Matthew Henry did
[1:06:05] John Wesley these men with Brilliant
[1:06:07] Minds did they misinterpret it also see
[1:06:11] so so I mean I was I was looking at some
[1:06:14] notes from Spurgeon and he's talking
[1:06:16] about how that that there has to be an
[1:06:18] unfeigned obedience to Doctrine that's
[1:06:20] his words there has to be obedience to
[1:06:23] Doctrine not hearing only but doing and
[1:06:25] it has to be from the heart that's
[1:06:27] Charles Spurgeon from a couple hundred
[1:06:29] years ago so so this idea today that
[1:06:33] well you know it's just the grace of God
[1:06:35] and it doesn't matter that we don't keep
[1:06:37] anything what doesn't now and now in one
[1:06:40] sense that's true but that's only true
[1:06:42] for the elect lady and that only becomes
[1:06:45] true for her when she's born again of
[1:06:47] the spirit of God then then there is no
[1:06:49] condemnation possible to her but you
[1:06:52] have to be born again and how do you get
[1:06:55] born again you have to be able to agree
[1:06:57] and amen to every word of God see so
[1:07:00] that's what brings that's what entitles
[1:07:02] you to the Token that's what entitles
[1:07:04] you to the New
[1:07:05] Birth so so he says here this is in
[1:07:09] order to unite with them they will be
[1:07:12] one they will be the very manifestation
[1:07:14] of the word of the Living God
[1:07:15] denominations cannot produce this it's
[1:07:17] not that they're not good people it's
[1:07:19] that that's wrong seed they will produce
[1:07:21] their Creeds and their dogmas mixed with
[1:07:24] the word this mon rizing brings forth a
[1:07:27] hybrid hybrid product that's a law of
[1:07:30] nature
[1:07:32] inescapable see that's not something
[1:07:34] William brandham is inventing that's a
[1:07:36] law of nature a hybrid seed brings forth
[1:07:39] a hybrid product an original seed brings
[1:07:42] forth an original product the original
[1:07:44] word brings forth an original
[1:07:46] Christian you understand all right so so
[1:07:50] this is where we were we were
[1:07:53] showing um on couple of Sundays ago that
[1:07:57] when a prophet says she's predestinated
[1:08:00] not to fall and I gave you this example
[1:08:03] it's the here's the first side of it
[1:08:05] it's the same as as if I said uh that I
[1:08:09] will plant a wheat seed and it is
[1:08:12] ordained to not be corn because it can't
[1:08:15] be because I planted wheat see so that's
[1:08:18] the law of nature so so predestinated
[1:08:22] not to fall is a seed that is destined
[1:08:26] to grow to its intended crop and this is
[1:08:29] we we dealt with that and I I don't want
[1:08:31] to just keep backgrounding but this is
[1:08:33] exactly why we had the opening of the
[1:08:36] seals to bring forth a birth of a of a
[1:08:39] bride that would go in the Rapture not
[1:08:41] not even the years of background it it
[1:08:44] it's really comes with the opening of
[1:08:46] the seals now brother Bram was a prophet
[1:08:48] all through his life so we're we got
[1:08:50] plenty of quotes we quote from before
[1:08:51] seals in the seals after the seals it
[1:08:54] doesn't matter we we anytime he had
[1:08:56] anything that prior to the seals that he
[1:08:59] was uh needed further Clarity on the
[1:09:03] angel of the lord gave it to him and he
[1:09:04] brought it to us amen so so we find out
[1:09:08] then that that we made the point how
[1:09:11] that the same way that the false prophet
[1:09:16] literally prophesies people into the
[1:09:19] tribulation is the process the same
[1:09:22] process only in the other direction why
[1:09:24] the word of God preaches you right into
[1:09:27] a Rapture he literally prophesies them
[1:09:30] into a tribulation and God sends a true
[1:09:33] Prophet not the false prophet a true
[1:09:35] Prophet to prophesy you into a
[1:09:38] Rapture so so it's it's it's just
[1:09:41] beautiful in that way so brother
[1:09:44] brandham we we talked about there in
[1:09:46] Christ's mystery God revealed and he
[1:09:49] Christ manifested in his church all
[1:09:51] together to bring back the original Adam
[1:09:52] and Eve again man and woman let me let
[1:09:55] me darken that for a minute because I
[1:09:56] don't have that on the on the board and
[1:09:58] so this is where he makes that
[1:10:00] tremendous statement so it's man and
[1:10:02] woman which are one made out of the same
[1:10:04] blood and the same spirit and everything
[1:10:05] else and this is why he would say that
[1:10:08] profound statement the church is the
[1:10:10] blood of Christ by the spirit see so and
[1:10:14] you say why because the life is in the
[1:10:17] blood that's the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost that baptizes us into his body
[1:10:21] that recognizes only his body his flesh
[1:10:23] his word that's a part of see and and so
[1:10:27] so when he says she's it's predestinated
[1:10:30] the church to that great glorious stand
[1:10:35] and that was what was thrilling my heart
[1:10:37] a couple of Sundays ago that we're not
[1:10:39] just I I love that song it's probably
[1:10:42] one of my favorite worship songs brother
[1:10:44] Anthony was singing I'm gonna make it
[1:10:46] he's already said that I would but I I I
[1:10:49] I love the fact that when I think about
[1:10:51] that I'm going to make it I have no
[1:10:54] plans to have to crawl or creep or roll
[1:10:57] over the Finish Line I'm going to run
[1:11:00] across the Finish
[1:11:02] Line that's my plan what's your plan I
[1:11:05] plan to be running until he calls us
[1:11:08] home see so he says this is what
[1:11:12] denominations won't touch they'll never
[1:11:14] touch that because it's the Revelation
[1:11:16] so the first
[1:11:18] reason the first reason that she will
[1:11:22] that she is predestinated to not fall
[1:11:25] we said to you last time is the exact
[1:11:28] same reason why denominations can't
[1:11:31] touch it because they don't have the
[1:11:32] pure seed word they operate on seeds of
[1:11:36] discrepancy see and so it bars them from
[1:11:40] receiving the new birth now and I and I
[1:11:44] this was one of the last statements I
[1:11:45] made and I thought to myself but this
[1:11:49] gives me courage when I said it two
[1:11:51] weeks ago and it gives me courage to
[1:11:53] repeat it tonight that just just as
[1:11:56] receiving Life In The Blood and having
[1:11:59] that token on display of the word of God
[1:12:03] the the same the same
[1:12:06] requirement that that that that
[1:12:10] literally that seat of discrepancy
[1:12:12] they're preaching literally brings them
[1:12:15] into a
[1:12:16] tribulation the the word you believe
[1:12:19] literally takes you in a Rapture and and
[1:12:22] in fact is it's so beautiful because it
[1:12:25] it literally bars them their seat of
[1:12:27] discrepancy bars them from going in the
[1:12:31] Rapture see and but your pure seed bars
[1:12:35] you from going into the tribulation say
[1:12:38] I might go impossible to go the seed
[1:12:41] Gene of God bars you from going into the
[1:12:44] tribulation see so this is exactly why
[1:12:49] because when you pass from Death to life
[1:12:50] you can never come into the Judgment as
[1:12:52] John said in St John 5 Paul said in
[1:12:55] Romans 8 there's now there's therefore
[1:12:56] now no condemnation to them which you're
[1:12:58] in Christ
[1:13:00] now who walk not after the flesh but who
[1:13:03] walk after the spirit in other words
[1:13:04] who's been born
[1:13:06] again now secondly all right so enough
[1:13:09] backgrounding that was the what we were
[1:13:11] really emphasizing La couple of Sundays
[1:13:14] ago that that's why you go in the
[1:13:16] Rapture that's why they can't go in the
[1:13:18] Rapture that's why they go in the
[1:13:19] tribulation and why you can't go into
[1:13:21] the
[1:13:22] tribulation secondly here's the other
[1:13:24] side of of it brother Brandon talks
[1:13:27] about it like this so he says she knows
[1:13:29] it so did Eve know it but she
[1:13:34] fell but this one knows it and won't
[1:13:38] fall she is
[1:13:40] ordained
[1:13:41] Hallelujah she is ordained to not fall
[1:13:46] see so not only are you feeding on the
[1:13:49] right seed but we have found
[1:13:52] out you are the right seed amen you're
[1:13:56] not just feeding on the right seed you
[1:13:59] are the right
[1:14:02] seed there has been people who fed on
[1:14:05] this seed who then fell away from this
[1:14:07] seed but the but the real seed cannot
[1:14:10] fall away from the Original Seed see so
[1:14:15] so he says she won't fall she is
[1:14:19] predestinated to it now you ready for
[1:14:23] the scripture he's going to give you the
[1:14:24] second
[1:14:26] half she won't fall she is predestinated
[1:14:30] to it and he quotes the psalmist David
[1:14:34] blessed is the man who God will not
[1:14:37] impute
[1:14:38] sin and he says you ministers know what
[1:14:40] I'm speaking of when there's a couple
[1:14:43] dozen of you sitting here blessed is the
[1:14:45] man whom God will not impute sin so what
[1:14:49] we are discovering is that sometimes in
[1:14:53] the in the our Our Miss is to prove this
[1:14:56] word true but come on let's just look at
[1:14:59] each other in the eye and admit to the
[1:15:01] fact that sometimes we don't do a good
[1:15:03] job of that sometimes we fail to do that
[1:15:07] sometimes we stumble but I know that the
[1:15:12] image of me in heaven hasn't
[1:15:16] stumbled there is an image of you here
[1:15:20] there's an image of you already in
[1:15:22] heaven and this image stumbles that
[1:15:25] image not only doesn't and never has and
[1:15:27] never
[1:15:29] will see I know that my image in heaven
[1:15:33] has not stumbled neither has it been
[1:15:35] altered so when the Lord taught us to
[1:15:38] pray and I've preached on this before
[1:15:40] when the Lord taught us to pray part of
[1:15:43] our daily dying and dedication and
[1:15:46] repentance should be Lord thy kingdom
[1:15:50] come thy will be done in this earth
[1:15:55] as the in heaven see and so make me look
[1:15:59] like make me this is my prayer Lord make
[1:16:04] me look like I already do in that
[1:16:09] Kingdom move uh move on my desires to
[1:16:13] press for that Kingdom that's a prayer
[1:16:15] you should pray Lord move on my desires
[1:16:18] bring a supernatural power upon my
[1:16:21] desires that I want to press for that
[1:16:24] image image see let me reorganize all my
[1:16:28] priorities let me change my aims let me
[1:16:31] let me think about my life now here's
[1:16:33] where it comes down to brass tacks and
[1:16:34] nuts and bolts of our life Lord let me
[1:16:38] because it's not just a free ride let me
[1:16:41] let me organize my life so that I'm in
[1:16:44] the line and Order of God's word so that
[1:16:47] this image for goodness sake please let
[1:16:50] this image look close to that one I'm
[1:16:54] glad there's that one but I'd very much
[1:16:56] like to look like that
[1:16:58] one and that's a desire of a real
[1:17:02] Christian see so when you when you
[1:17:06] really preach it like Paul preached it
[1:17:09] the natural human tendency quite natural
[1:17:13] is to say wow then it doesn't even
[1:17:15] matter I can just do whatever I want to
[1:17:17] do do you know what now that and that
[1:17:19] not argument is not new it's not novel
[1:17:22] in any way they were arguing that in
[1:17:23] Paul's day
[1:17:25] Paul saidwell you know you're going to
[1:17:27] say to me Paul well then let if if if my
[1:17:31] sinning and him forgiving me and
[1:17:33] cleansing me and saving me gives him
[1:17:35] glory then let me sin more so I can give
[1:17:37] him more glory and Paul said you're a
[1:17:39] fool for thinking like that this isn't
[1:17:41] about that see Paul wasn't worried
[1:17:43] because Paul knew that heathens and
[1:17:45] sinners are going to abuse that they're
[1:17:47] going to have a easy believer ISM
[1:17:49] they're going to have a false Grace but
[1:17:51] they ignore the fact that the Bible says
[1:17:54] that Grace teaches us to deny
[1:17:57] ungodliness nobody none of them want to
[1:17:59] quote that one oh it's just his grace
[1:18:03] but Grace teaches us to deny
[1:18:05] ungodliness that's the grace that before
[1:18:09] as as as as as I I was reading
[1:18:11] spurgeon's notes as Spurgeon said before
[1:18:14] I was I I I forget exactly the the the
[1:18:17] two different words he used I was
[1:18:19] abstained I I couldn't love him but now
[1:18:23] by his grace I can't not love him before
[1:18:26] I had a mind enmity against God and now
[1:18:29] I love God and I can't love the world
[1:18:32] anymore
[1:18:34] see so so this is where David said
[1:18:38] Psalms 32 and2 blessed is the man unto
[1:18:41] whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and
[1:18:44] in whose Spirit there is no gu now I'm
[1:18:46] going to say something here that's right
[1:18:50] if that was true about every human then
[1:18:53] this is a redundant statement right and
[1:18:55] there are no redundant statements in the
[1:18:58] Bible the very fact that David is saying
[1:19:01] blessed is the man unto whom the Lord
[1:19:03] imputeth not iniquity signifies that
[1:19:05] there that's not
[1:19:07] everybody see and in whose Spirit there
[1:19:11] is no guile see this is the same th and
[1:19:15] what does that well what does it for the
[1:19:21] 144,000 the same thing's doing it for
[1:19:23] you amen the Bible speaking of the
[1:19:26] 144,000 in Revelation
[1:19:28] 141 verse 1 and verse 5 and I looked and
[1:19:31] lo a lamb now just listen
[1:19:34] because they're going to receive this
[1:19:36] same
[1:19:37] message this very same message that you
[1:19:40] have that you enjoy see and and the
[1:19:44] Bible says and I looked and L lamp stood
[1:19:46] on Mount Zion and with him 144 and 140
[1:19:50] and
[1:19:51] 4,000 having his father's name written
[1:19:54] in the forehead see theyve re they've
[1:19:56] received a revelation of the deity of
[1:19:59] Jesus Christ because it's a revelation
[1:20:01] of the name of God and the and the word
[1:20:03] interpreted is a
[1:20:06] manifestation of the name of
[1:20:15] God verse five I'll get through
[1:20:19] it verse five and in their mouth was
[1:20:24] found no gu for they are without fault
[1:20:29] Before the Throne of
[1:20:32] God if that message is going to do that
[1:20:34] for them how does it not do it for
[1:20:37] you now here's the be here's a more
[1:20:40] beautiful part god decreed this about
[1:20:44] them 2,000 years before they would ever
[1:20:48] even stand on the earth we don't even
[1:20:50] know who they are to this day they
[1:20:53] haven't even been identified to the
[1:20:55] themselves and 2,000 years before they
[1:20:58] would ever be on the earth God has
[1:21:01] already declared that and you say how
[1:21:04] how does he know that that's going to
[1:21:06] happen his word in Revelation 14 has
[1:21:09] already declared it I would tell you
[1:21:12] that it's going to be impossible for it
[1:21:14] to not happen because he's already put
[1:21:17] it in his
[1:21:19] Bible see
[1:21:22] now I want to take you back to our text
[1:21:26] tonight and I want to read that 9
[1:21:29] through 21 again except I'm going to use
[1:21:32] the JW
[1:21:33] version
[1:21:35] jwv all right this is from my work on my
[1:21:38] rewrite of the book of Romans I I I
[1:21:41] often go back to it when I'm trying to
[1:21:43] understand Paul writes in sometimes in
[1:21:45] such abstract ways King James English
[1:21:48] causes us in our modern Minds to have to
[1:21:50] really strain to get his full meaning so
[1:21:54] I've did all the heavy lifting for you
[1:21:56] this is this work is several years old I
[1:21:58] occasionally go through it and make
[1:22:00] edits but I want to just read I want to
[1:22:03] reread our text whoops is it gonna come
[1:22:06] back on for me let me go off and let me
[1:22:09] come back on uh okay let's Advance all
[1:22:13] right all
[1:22:15] right go right here and then now the
[1:22:17] next one all right now watch because
[1:22:20] here is the other side of why
[1:22:25] you're ordained to not fall why you are
[1:22:28] predestinated to stand and stand
[1:22:33] victoriously speaking of the blood of
[1:22:36] Christ and now that we have been
[1:22:40] justified by his
[1:22:42] blood we much more surely then will be
[1:22:46] saved through him from the wrath of God
[1:22:50] for since we were restored to favor with
[1:22:53] God by the death of his son while we
[1:22:56] were still enemies we will most
[1:22:58] certainly be delivered from Eternal
[1:23:00] punishment by his life makes sense and
[1:23:04] not only that but we even boast in God
[1:23:08] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[1:23:11] have received atonement so I can
[1:23:13] actually
[1:23:14] boast it's it's not me boasting In My
[1:23:17] Own Strength it's me boasting in what
[1:23:19] the blood of Christ has done and because
[1:23:22] I have received the Word of Promise and
[1:23:24] that has entitled me to the Holy Ghost
[1:23:27] and there's no condemnation possible to
[1:23:30] me see this is the beauty of it and I
[1:23:33] and I you know how I've preached you
[1:23:35] about that word atonement that atonement
[1:23:39] is is is is
[1:23:41] really when we talk about and this why a
[1:23:44] lot of the early church fathers use the
[1:23:46] word atonement but it only describes
[1:23:49] Christ's worthiness to be your
[1:23:52] sacrifice but they would often use the
[1:23:55] word satisfaction because that entails
[1:23:57] both sides that entails the atonement
[1:24:00] that he was a worthy lamb that you
[1:24:02] couldn't be but then it also covers the
[1:24:05] preceptive side and requirements of the
[1:24:07] word because every precept has to be
[1:24:09] upon precept somebody had to live it
[1:24:12] perfectly cuz you certainly won't and I
[1:24:14] certainly won't and we have't and we
[1:24:16] won't no one ever has anywhere in the
[1:24:20] Bible except one man the elected son of
[1:24:23] Isaiah 42
[1:24:24] and he's the elected son and I'm in him
[1:24:27] and therefore he lived the preceptive
[1:24:30] sight of the word on my behalf say does
[1:24:33] it is it really brother Jason that that
[1:24:35] my sins don't count against me it's that
[1:24:38] your your life has already been
[1:24:41] identified in the life of Jesus and the
[1:24:44] record is sealed and nothing else can be
[1:24:48] added and so all your failures don't get
[1:24:51] added to that record it's finished
[1:24:54] see so I'm I'm I gain access to this by
[1:24:58] the Holy Ghost baptism see not because I
[1:25:01] want a lottery not because I'm a better
[1:25:04] person but because I've received the
[1:25:06] word for my day see
[1:25:09] watch verse 11 again and not only that
[1:25:12] but we even boast in God through our
[1:25:14] Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have
[1:25:16] received
[1:25:17] atonement for death had passed upon all
[1:25:20] men the reason being that when one man
[1:25:23] Adam sinned sin entered into the whole
[1:25:26] world and through sin Came Death so then
[1:25:29] death automatically passed upon all men
[1:25:32] you see people sinned even before the
[1:25:35] law was given and and though there was
[1:25:38] no law to break since it had not yet
[1:25:41] been given they all died
[1:25:45] anyway even though they did not uh
[1:25:48] disobey an explicit commandment of God
[1:25:51] as Adam did what a contrast between Adam
[1:25:54] in Christ who was yet to come and what a
[1:25:58] difference between our sin and God's
[1:26:00] generous gift of salvation for if for if
[1:26:03] this one man Adam could bring death to
[1:26:06] all people through his sin did
[1:26:09] he anybody want to argue that if one man
[1:26:13] if this one man Adam could bring death
[1:26:16] to all people through his sin then how
[1:26:18] much more abundantly through the one man
[1:26:20] Jesus Christ will the grace of God
[1:26:22] Supply a pardon for them
[1:26:26] see this is Paul's
[1:26:28] point and the result of God's gracious
[1:26:31] gift is very different from the result
[1:26:33] of that one man's sin for Adam's one sin
[1:26:37] led to the total condemnation but God's
[1:26:40] free gift face many transgressions
[1:26:43] resulting in total
[1:26:44] justification besides if by the trespass
[1:26:48] of one man a Adam death reigned through
[1:26:51] that one man how much more surely will
[1:26:54] those who receive God's overflowing
[1:26:57] Grace and the free gift of his
[1:26:58] righteousness reign as kings in this
[1:27:01] present life and the one to come through
[1:27:05] the one man Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ
[1:27:09] therefore since everything I've just
[1:27:11] said therefore just as one man's
[1:27:14] trespass led to condemnation for all so
[1:27:17] one man's Act of righteousness leads to
[1:27:19] justification and life for all because
[1:27:22] of one man's Disobedience many were made
[1:27:24] Sinners so also by The Obedience of one
[1:27:26] many shall be made righteous the law was
[1:27:29] added so that the trespass might
[1:27:31] increase but people uh people then being
[1:27:34] able to see just how sinful they really
[1:27:38] were but where sin increased Grace
[1:27:41] increased all the
[1:27:44] more sin once used death to exercise
[1:27:47] dominion over us but God
[1:27:52] re Grace Grace could now rule over us
[1:27:56] through justification leading to eternal
[1:27:58] life through Jesus Christ Our Lord does
[1:28:00] it get any better can you hope for a
[1:28:03] better deal than that and guess what I
[1:28:06] mean it's
[1:28:07] free hey if I had a deal and I say how
[1:28:10] many will give me this and we can start
[1:28:11] a bid in an auction say what's what what
[1:28:13] are we bidding on eternal life my
[1:28:16] goodness you'd empty your bank account
[1:28:18] I'm here to tell you it don't cost you a
[1:28:20] dime all it takes is a complete
[1:28:22] surrender of your life to the word that
[1:28:25] God has brought in this hour or any hour
[1:28:28] and that entitled you to the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] you're born again of the spirit of God
[1:28:32] and there is no condemnation possible to
[1:28:35] you after that this is why he would say
[1:28:39] the bride is predestinated to stand
[1:28:42] there she is ordained to not fall why
[1:28:46] because even if she commit a
[1:28:48] transgression God blessed is the man who
[1:28:52] God will not impute
[1:28:54] iniquity
[1:28:56] to see so this is the beauty of it this
[1:29:00] is why when brother brandom comes to
[1:29:03] questions and answers I'm GNA stop in 11
[1:29:06] minutes listen I didn't put this one up
[1:29:09] here because I wanted to put some up and
[1:29:10] I wanted to read some now I'm coming
[1:29:13] down to the end and I just want you to
[1:29:15] catch
[1:29:16] this brother Ram comes to questions and
[1:29:18] answers and he's talking about this
[1:29:21] whole idea where John had said in 1 John
[1:29:27] 3:9 whosoever is born of
[1:29:32] God do not commit
[1:29:36] sin how do you get born of God uh to
[1:29:40] omnipotence
[1:29:42] meat the Holy Ghost which is Christ
[1:29:45] which is the word brings to life a seed
[1:29:49] that is part of the word that is part of
[1:29:51] Christ that was in God and just as
[1:29:55] Christ is a Offspring just as Jesus of
[1:29:58] Nazareth is an offspring of God so is
[1:30:00] the family of Jesus Christ an offspring
[1:30:02] of
[1:30:03] God so John says whosoever is born of
[1:30:06] God does not commit sin here's why his
[1:30:10] seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:30:13] because he is born of God is that your
[1:30:18] Bible so brother brandham says for by
[1:30:21] one spirit this is question answerers
[1:30:23] 195 for one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:30:26] into one body and are free from sin and
[1:30:30] we
[1:30:32] cannot there is an atonement waiting for
[1:30:35] us Christians don't
[1:30:38] sin they make
[1:30:45] mistakes but they don't
[1:30:51] sin brother Brandon is going to read
[1:30:53] this this is a this is a true story I
[1:30:55] lived in this city and mayor vissing and
[1:30:58] brother brandham were bosom
[1:31:00] friends brother Bram tells this story
[1:31:02] which was a a known fact in the city of
[1:31:06] Jeffersonville the mayor of the city
[1:31:08] says Mr
[1:31:09] Branham I know that you make sick calls
[1:31:12] there's speed limits highest speed limit
[1:31:15] in the city is about 35 miles an hour
[1:31:16] but I'm giving
[1:31:18] you permission to run 90 if you want to
[1:31:25] because I have faith in you that you
[1:31:28] wouldn't do it unless you had emergency
[1:31:31] call or somebody dying Yonder in a wreck
[1:31:34] and I'll give you permission as the
[1:31:37] mayor of this city that you can run any
[1:31:40] red
[1:31:41] light man my kind of
[1:31:45] Mayor you can run any red light do
[1:31:49] whatever you want to just go right on
[1:31:54] brother brandham talks about an officer
[1:31:55] he said How Could An Officer ever arrest
[1:31:58] me out here making 45 miles an hour in a
[1:32:00] 35 M Zone he
[1:32:03] can't I cannot break any speed laws in
[1:32:06] this
[1:32:09] city because why I'm above the speed
[1:32:15] law and when we are dead and God has
[1:32:18] recognized our repentance he's
[1:32:21] recognized our baptism he's recognized
[1:32:24] the blood of his own son which by faith
[1:32:26] has been applied he recognizes his
[1:32:29] foreordination and know that I do it and
[1:32:32] has recognized me in Christ dead and
[1:32:35] Christ in Christ died in my place when
[1:32:38] he was slain before the foundation of
[1:32:40] the world Christ is my sacrifice and God
[1:32:44] could not impute to me sin anymore he's
[1:32:48] given me the Seal of the Holy Ghost as a
[1:32:50] witness that I've passed from death to
[1:32:54] life so the law of sin and death has no
[1:32:59] jurisdiction over you
[1:33:01] friends it has no jurisdiction over you
[1:33:03] we're free I could say it like brother
[1:33:06] brandham said it we're Above the
[1:33:08] Law I realize that mankind makes
[1:33:11] mistakes and and and if he M if he
[1:33:14] breaks God's commandment then there's a
[1:33:16] penalty but not to the people who are
[1:33:19] above the law oh my Hallelujah because I
[1:33:23] am Above the Law I you've heard me say
[1:33:25] it before I I got a new passport I you
[1:33:28] know what kind I got I got it from
[1:33:30] Heaven you know what it is it's a
[1:33:32] diplomatic passport I you say aren't you
[1:33:35] an American I'm a Christian Hallelujah
[1:33:38] I've got a diplomatic passport you don't
[1:33:39] what that means that means I I am immune
[1:33:41] from prosecution Hallelujah I'm a
[1:33:44] diplomat from the kingdom of Christ and
[1:33:47] I'm not subject to the laws of the
[1:33:49] common Earthling oh people don't like
[1:33:52] that but I have diploma imunity because
[1:33:55] I am a child of God I am a son of The
[1:33:58] King and I am ordained to not fall it's
[1:34:01] not it's not just I'm not ordained I'm
[1:34:03] ordained to not fall I'm predestinated
[1:34:05] to stand there's a reason for that
[1:34:07] number one I'm feeding on the pure word
[1:34:10] how can I not become the word when I'm
[1:34:12] feeding on the pure word you well
[1:34:14] because of your mistakes they don't
[1:34:16] count against me this thing is sealed on
[1:34:19] both sides friends I'm here to tell you
[1:34:21] as you've heard me say it before once
[1:34:23] you're in Christ you've believed the
[1:34:25] word you've been baptized in the Holy
[1:34:27] Ghost you're going in the Rapture and
[1:34:29] there's nothing you can do about it
[1:34:31] Hallelujah I'm signed sealed and
[1:34:33] delivered I'm ordained for the Rapture
[1:34:37] I'm predestinated not to fall for
[1:34:40] Satan's trickery in this
[1:34:44] world that's what God has done for me
[1:34:49] and that is what God has done for you
[1:34:54] amen you know I I remember some time ago
[1:34:59] and I I'll close with this I remember
[1:35:01] some time ago I visited Ellis
[1:35:03] Island and I was just so amazed at the
[1:35:07] amount of people that trafficed through
[1:35:09] there from other lands coming to this
[1:35:13] land they came from other kingdoms into
[1:35:16] this Kingdom called the United States
[1:35:19] and it's not just Ellis Island the same
[1:35:20] principle that I'm talking about here
[1:35:23] the same principle at at our Southern
[1:35:24] border at our northern border where
[1:35:27] wherever whatever way you come into the
[1:35:28] United States you're going to have to go
[1:35:30] through
[1:35:32] processing you're going to have to be
[1:35:33] processed you're GNA they're going to
[1:35:35] have to determine do you qualify to stay
[1:35:39] here you see I I said this in Colombia
[1:35:41] on Sunday and I and I was talking about
[1:35:44] the great white Throne judgment when you
[1:35:47] when you take it from the perspective of
[1:35:50] Revelation 20 where the Bible says that
[1:35:53] the the sea gave up its dead and death
[1:35:56] and Hell gave up its dead and the dead
[1:35:58] both small and great stood Before the
[1:36:01] Throne and so I made this statement I
[1:36:03] said people talk about who gets to go to
[1:36:06] heaven
[1:36:10] everybody that's not the question
[1:36:13] everybody gets to go to heaven the
[1:36:15] question is who gets to
[1:36:17] stay amen and so you have to you know
[1:36:21] you know what the great white Throne is
[1:36:23] judgment is it's like a processing they
[1:36:25] come into Alis Island they come into
[1:36:26] Southern border they come into northern
[1:36:27] border however they get here they have
[1:36:29] to go through processing did you ever
[1:36:31] notice that the that the staff doing the
[1:36:35] processing aren't being
[1:36:37] processed you ever think about that the
[1:36:40] only people who are being processed are
[1:36:44] people who are coming there to see if
[1:36:46] they get to stay there but the staff has
[1:36:48] already been processed they're actually
[1:36:50] part of the processing team you're
[1:36:52] Seated on the thr on with Christ I'm not
[1:36:56] I'm not being processed I'm being
[1:36:57] processed now my whole life is standing
[1:37:01] before the word of God and I'm going
[1:37:02] through my processing right now oh
[1:37:05] Hallelujah friends they they want to
[1:37:06] know about your background they want to
[1:37:08] know about your life they want to know
[1:37:09] about your family they want to know if
[1:37:10] you got your documents they want to know

[1:37:27] you know I we all got our record pulled
[1:37:29] one day and you know what you know I
[1:37:32] thought I thought to myself I thought to
[1:37:33] myself when I thought about that and in
[1:37:35] the image of my mind I thought you
[1:37:38] know I was
[1:37:41] surprised when my record got pulled you
[1:37:43] know why
[1:37:45] because I knew what all I had
[1:37:48] done and I knew I had a wrap sheet a
[1:37:52] mile long and when they brought out my
[1:37:54] record it didn't have any of that on
[1:37:57] it it was completely clean I thought
[1:38:01] they had pulled the wrong file and I
[1:38:03] found out that they did and they didn't
[1:38:06] and I said well I don't understand my
[1:38:08] wrap sheet should be 100 miles long how
[1:38:10] does it not have any did you pull the
[1:38:12] wrong file they said no we pulled your
[1:38:14] file right here's your name at the top
[1:38:16] Mrs Jesus Christ I said wait a minute
[1:38:19] whose filed you pull they said the file
[1:38:21] of Jesus Christ you pulled his file yeah
[1:38:24] and his life was counted to you you got
[1:38:27] credit for his life and he never sinned
[1:38:29] so you never sin take your place
[1:38:31] Hallelujah friend that's where we stand
[1:38:34] tonight no wonder she's ordained to not
[1:38:37] fall she is predestinated to stand and
[1:38:41] stand
[1:38:42] victoriously oh I'm so glad he pulled
[1:38:45] somebody else's record besides mine he

[1:54:02] new vehicle um off a Facebook
[1:54:04] Marketplace and um we'd been praying for
[1:54:06] a new vehicle for a while trying to find
[1:54:08] a good deal we got what I thought was a
[1:54:10] pretty good deal and um we got it home
[1:54:14] and the great trial that everyone has to
[1:54:17] face is the DMV and uh so I had to go to
[1:54:20] the DMV to you know get my my title and
[1:54:22] tags and everything when I got there
[1:54:24] they let me know that the girl that I
[1:54:27] bought it from had made a mistake on the
[1:54:29] back of the title so I had to go hunt
[1:54:31] her down to get a title error
[1:54:34] acknowledgement form signed so they
[1:54:37] could transfer the the
[1:54:39] title well horror of Horrors um she had
[1:54:43] taken the listing down off the Facebook
[1:54:44] Marketplace and we had communicated
[1:54:46] entirely through Facebook Marketplace
[1:54:48] and she had her settings set to not
[1:54:50] accept new messages so she is now in the
[1:54:52] wind there is no no contacting her she's
[1:54:56] gone I don't have an address I don't
[1:54:58] have a phone number I don't have
[1:55:00] anything and I'm like well I call the
[1:55:03] DMV I'm like is there anything y'all can
[1:55:05] do and they're basically like no you're
[1:55:07] on your own so I I'm just completely at
[1:55:11] a loss I've I have now a car that I
[1:55:14] don't technically own in my driveway and
[1:55:17] no money to show for it so you know I'm
[1:55:20] I'm just kind of panicked and I was on
[1:55:23] the way home from the DMV I'm like

[1:55:57] public record we could find uh we she
[1:56:01] had just moved down from Massachusetts
[1:56:02] so we didn't even really have like so
[1:56:04] the address on her on the title that we

[1:56:11] records we I mean anybody with the same
[1:56:14] last name we're like looking for any
[1:56:16] public records and Kate had stepped into
[1:56:19] a back room and she just started praying
[1:56:21] about it and um she said it was like the
[1:56:23] Lord spoke to her and said hey that

[1:58:27] meaning to give one of them was with a
[1:58:29] pocket door that I had to do that um I
[1:58:32] could not get it back in the thing on
[1:58:34] the track or nothing like that I I tried
[1:58:36] and tried and I got crowbars under and
[1:58:39] it trying to get it up on over so it
[1:58:40] would be on the pulley and everything
[1:58:42] and I just kind of stopped I remember
[1:58:45] once I was working with Matt's dad and
[1:58:47] we had a window in a brick building that
[1:58:49] we were doing it was like 8 ft tall 8 18
[1:58:52] in wide and we had to grind on those
[1:58:55] bricks to get the thing to go in and we
[1:58:57] just couldn't get it to go in and uh he
[1:59:00] just we just stopped for a minute and
[1:59:02] prayed and then all of a sudden it
[1:59:03] popped in so I was doing this door and I
[1:59:06] was just like well I need help and um
[1:59:10] help me Lord and then somehow it got in
[1:59:13] there I don't I was just like you got to

[1:59:17] for that but that's happened several
[1:59:19] times on this job but the one that um

[1:59:26] fell down a couple of times because of

[1:59:55] felt pretty good and I really wrecked up
[1:59:57] my left knee bruised it I could still
[1:59:59] bend it and everything and it was the
[2:00:01] bruising kind of went away and then it
[2:00:03] was just like I couldn't straighten it I
[2:00:06] couldn't like I had hyperextended it or
[2:00:08] something and I was just like and this
