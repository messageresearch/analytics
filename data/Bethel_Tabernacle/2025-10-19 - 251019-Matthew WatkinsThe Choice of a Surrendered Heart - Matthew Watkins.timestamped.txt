[0:57] [music]
[1:02] [music]
[1:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:23] I was going to read uh the book of
[1:25] Psalms 124 [music] if you want to find
[1:27] it.
[1:29] We just all stand and have a prayer.
[1:35] [snorts]
[1:37] You happy to be in the house of [music]
[1:38] the Lord tonight?
[1:40] Amen.
[1:43] God is good.
[1:45] The book of Psalms 124 reads on this
[1:48] wise. It says, "If it had not been so,
[1:53] if it had not been the Lord who was on
[1:55] our side, now may Israel say, if it had
[1:59] not been the Lord who was on our side,
[2:02] when men rose up against us, [music]
[2:05] then they had swallowed us up quick, but
[2:08] their wrath was kindled against us. When
[2:11] the waters had [music] overwhelmed us,
[2:13] the stream had gone over our soul. Then
[2:17] the proud waters had gone over our soul.
[2:21] Blessed be the Lord who hath gotten us
[2:24] as a prey to their teeth. Has not given
[2:27] us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is
[2:31] escaped as a bird out of the snare of
[2:33] the followers. The snare is broken and
[2:36] we are escaped.
[2:38] Our help is in the name of the Lord who
[2:42] made heaven and earth. Amen. Aren't you
[2:46] glad for that as your help in the name
[2:49] of the Lord? Let's just bow our heads.
[2:51] Almighty God,
[2:54] Father, it's a privilege and an honor,
[2:56] Lord, to be able to come before your
[2:58] mighty throne tonight.
[3:00] Lord, I just pray that you would bless
[3:02] and anoint this worship service, Lord.
[3:05] Bless the word that comes forth tonight,
[3:08] Lord.
[3:09] May it be spoken, Lord, in such a way
[3:12] that we know that it's a living word.
[3:16] Lord, your words have life in them.
[3:18] Lord, they're not just like human words.
[3:22] Not just a noise with some [music]
[3:24] phonetics behind it that say something,
[3:28] Lord. Your words have more than just
[3:30] meaning, Lord, but your words have life.
[3:34] We just pray that tonight, Lord, your
[3:36] word would sink into the depths of our
[3:38] souls.
[3:40] Just watch over us tonight. Bless this
[3:42] service in a special way. Lord, we thank
[3:45] you so much for all that you are and all
[3:48] you do for us.
[3:50] In the wonderful and glorious name of
[3:52] Jesus Christ, we pray and ask.
[3:56] Amen.
[3:58] Quiet
[4:02] me.
[4:06] Let peaceful [music]
[4:08] [singing] waters
[4:10] flow
[4:13] and learn to be still.
[4:18] Oh my [music] soul
[4:23] and [music] let me
[4:28] [music]
[4:29] my Jesus walking near.
[4:34] Touch me Lord inqu
[4:39] [music]
[4:58] Oh my soul
[5:00] [music]
[5:03] And let me
[5:08] my [music] Jesus walk in near.
[5:14] Touch me [music] Lord and quiet
[5:19] me.
[5:23] [music] Quiet
[5:26] me.
[5:28] Let peaceful waters flow.
[5:34] Learn to be still,
[5:38] oh my soul,
[5:43] and let me hear
[5:48] my [music] Jesus. Walk in.
[5:54] Touch me Lord and quiet
[5:59] me.
[6:00] Sing it from the depths of your heart.
[6:03] From quiet [music]
[6:06] me.
[6:08] Let peaceful waters [music]
[6:11] flow
[6:14] and learn to be still.
[6:18] Oh my soul [music]
[6:23] and let me [singing]
[6:26] hear
[6:28] [music] my Jesus walking near.
[6:33] [music] Touch me Lord.
[6:36] Quiet
[6:40] me.
[6:44] Well, Luther, why don't you come on up
[6:46] and [music] we'll pray over the tithes
[6:47] and the offerings.
[6:51] Amen.
[6:56] Bless you, brother.
[7:00] Praise the Lord. There ain't nothing
[7:02] like just getting quiet in the presence
[7:04] of the Lord.
[7:06] Get your [music] spirit still. Get your
[7:08] mind still.
[7:10] Get rid of your devices.
[7:13] I'm not preaching tonight. Praise the
[7:15] Lord. [snorts] Amen. We all
[7:18] struggle with that, don't we? Amen. So,
[7:22] um, it gets a little slippery out on the
[7:24] concrete out here with the condensate
[7:26] water [music] on the concrete and stuff.
[7:27] So, just be careful out there. We don't
[7:29] want anyone to [music] get hurt in any
[7:31] way, shape, or form. I'm glad to be a
[7:34] Christian tonight. [music]
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad that he never leaves
[7:38] me nor forsakes me regardless of in
[7:41] spite of myself. [music] He looks beyond
[7:44] my faults and sees my needs. Let's pray.
[7:48] Father, I love you this evening, Lord.
[7:51] And Lord, [music] I'm eternally grateful
[7:52] and I'm grateful this evening, Father,
[7:56] for you and what your work does in my
[7:58] life. And Father, I [music] pray you
[8:01] forgive me for my many faults and
[8:03] failures, Father.
[8:05] Brother Donnie sings that song,
[8:09] Bars of Bone.
[8:11] And so many times, Father, I feel like
[8:13] I'm prisoned inside this old body, and I
[8:17] want to get out. I praise [music] you
[8:20] this evening, Lord, that we have an
[8:21] opportunity to just step aside from the
[8:24] cares and [music] busyness of life.
[8:26] Father, worship you in spirit and in
[8:29] truth.
[8:31] Was such a beautiful song, Lord. quiet
[8:34] me. How your presence just come down
[8:36] [music] and just you could feel the
[8:39] quietness settle in.
[8:42] And Lord, [music] we just praise and
[8:43] worship you this evening. We thank you
[8:45] for your grace and mercies to us.
[8:47] Father, as you spoke to Paul,
[8:50] your grace is sufficient, Father. We
[8:52] thank you for that. As we collect the
[8:54] tithes and offerings, we pray that you
[8:56] would bless the cheerful giver, Father.
[8:59] And Lord, just continue to be with us in
[9:01] [music] the service. We pray in Jesus
[9:02] name.
[9:03] Amen.
[9:09] For a long time [music] I've traveled

[17:37] &gt;&gt; Well, they're all expecting me. And
[17:41] that's one thing [music] I know.

[20:04] The angels [music] beckon me
[20:07] from heaven's open door [music] when I
[20:11] can't feel at home in this world
[20:16] anymore.
[20:17] [music]
[20:23] Amen.
[20:24] You ever think about the words sometimes
[20:26] of these songs that we sing? Man,

[22:19] will sing the [music] song of ages to
[22:23] the land.
[22:27] Your [music] name
[22:29] is the highest. Your name is the [music]
[22:34] greatest. Your name
[22:37] stands [music and singing] above them
[22:39] all.

[24:04] forever
[24:06] and amen.
[24:08] And the angels [singing] cry,
[24:12] "Holy,

[28:50] You've [music] brought me through.
[28:54] On [music and singing] Christ I stand.

[29:02] and by [singing]
[29:03] your hand my [music] victory [singing]

[30:32] [music]
[30:38] [applause]
[30:42] Amen.
[30:44] Could we just stand and give the Lord
[30:46] another hand clap of [music] praise?
[30:50] You're worthy, Lord, of our praise.
[30:54] Oh yes. Give me a key of Jesus.
[31:03] Listen to these words sometimes and they
[31:05] don't even make sense. [music] There is
[31:06] a river that flows from deep within.
[31:11] There is a fountain that frees the
[31:13] [music] soul from sin. There's a river
[31:16] that flows from deep within. Think about
[31:19] that. Really? There's a river that flows
[31:22] [music] from deep within.
[31:25] [snorts]
[31:26] There
[31:30] is
[31:33] a river
[31:38] when it flows
[31:42] from deep [singing]
[31:45] within. [music]
[31:47] Aren't you glad for that?
[31:51] Well, there
[31:54] is
[31:56] a fountain
[32:02] and it frees
[32:05] the soul
[32:07] from sin.
[32:10] [music]
[32:13] Oh, come
[32:16] [singing] to
[32:19] these waters.
[32:25] There is
[32:27] a vast
[32:30] sublime.
[32:36] There
[32:38] is
[32:41] a river.
[32:43] Oh, think about this next [music] words.
[32:46] And it never
[32:49] shall
[32:51] run dry.
[32:57] There was [music]
[32:59] a thirsty
[33:03] woman
[33:07] [music] who was drawing
[33:10] from
[33:13] the well.
[33:18] Will her life [music]
[33:20] it was ruined
[33:23] oh and wasted.
[33:27] Think about it. [music] And her soul
[33:31] it was bound
[33:33] for hell.
[33:36] [music]
[33:39] But then
[33:41] she met
[33:44] the master [music and singing]
[33:49] who told [music]
[33:52] of her
[33:54] great sin.
[33:59] And he said,
[34:02] "If you drink
[34:04] from this [music] water,
[34:09] you will never
[34:13] thirst
[34:15] [music] again."
[34:20] There [music] came
[34:22] [singing] a sound
[34:25] from heaven.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:30] &gt;&gt; was a rushing [singing]
[34:33] mighty
[34:35] [music]
[34:36] wind.
[34:40] [music] Well, it filled [singing]
[34:43] all their hearts
[34:45] with singing [music]
[34:50] and it gave [music]
[34:53] them peace
[34:56] within.
[34:57] [music]
[35:01] The prophets
[35:04] gave [singing]
[35:06] the promise
[35:10] God's [music]
[35:11] spirit
[35:14] will
[35:16] descend.
[35:18] Thank [music] you Lord for that.
[35:21] Oh and from [singing]
[35:24] your inner
[35:27] being. [music]
[35:32] A [music] river
[35:34] with
[35:36] no end.
[35:39] [music]
[35:42] Well, there
[35:45] [singing] is [music]
[35:47] a river
[35:51] [music]
[35:52] and it flows
[35:55] from deep
[35:57] [music] within.
[36:03] There
[36:05] is
[36:07] a fountain [music]
[36:12] and it frees [music and singing]
[36:15] the soul
[36:17] from sin.
[36:20] Thank you Lord for that. [music]
[36:23] Oh, [singing] come
[36:26] to
[36:28] these [music]
[36:29] waters
[36:32] where there is
[36:36] a [music and singing] vast
[36:38] supply.
[36:42] [music]
[36:44] There
[36:46] is [music]
[36:48] a river
[36:53] when it never
[36:56] shall
[36:58] run dry.
[37:01] [music]
[37:04] Amen. Are you thankful that there is a
[37:07] river? Amen. Thank you, brother Brad,
[37:09] for that song. Just love that worship.
[37:12] Amen. [music]
[37:12] Are you glad to be a Christian tonight?
[37:15] Amen. Happy that you have the love of
[37:17] the Lord in your [music] heart. Amen.
[37:19] Without that, we wouldn't be here. Amen.
[37:22] Amen. God bless you. If you have your
[37:23] Bible, we'll turn to the book of [music]
[37:24] Genesis chapter 32. Amen. Genesis
[37:27] chapter 32.
[37:31] just like to [music] say to keep our
[37:33] pastor, my dad in prayer still
[37:35] recovering uh today and just spoke spoke
[37:39] to him today and um still sounds pretty
[37:42] uh under the weather but he's feeling a
[37:44] little better about 60% I think he said
[37:47] and so we just want to uh keep
[37:48] remembering him in prayer the Lord would
[37:50] just restore his strength and bring him
[37:53] amen to a a speedy recovery. all of
[37:56] those that are uh out maybe under the
[37:59] weather. I know a few are and then
[38:00] others traveling. We just want to be
[38:02] remembering them. Amen. Tonight, Genesis
[38:05] chapter 32,
[38:07] [clears throat]
[38:08] I want to minister to you on the choice
[38:10] of a surrendered heart. The choice of a
[38:15] surrendered heart.
[38:17] Why don't we just pick it up here? I'm
[38:19] just uh find a place and then I'll have
[38:20] you be seated, read a few scriptures.
[38:22] This is very familiar story of Jacob.
[38:25] I'm going to read and then we'll skip
[38:27] down. Verse one says, "And Jacob went on
[38:29] his way and the angels of God met him.
[38:31] And when Jacob saw them, he said, "This
[38:33] is God's host. And he called the name of
[38:35] the place, I'm not going to pronounce
[38:37] that right, but Mahanam."
[38:40] And Jacob sent messengers before him to
[38:42] Esau his brother, unto the land of
[38:45] Seier, the country of Edom. Let's just
[38:48] move on down. I'm just going to skip
[38:49] some of this, but we're going to go to
[38:51] verse 21.
[38:52] So went the present over before him, and
[38:57] himself lodged that night in the
[38:59] company. And he rose up that night, and
[39:02] took his two wives and his two woman
[39:05] servants, his 11 sons, and passed over
[39:08] the Ford Jabbach. Now, this is maybe a
[39:11] river you've never heard of before, and
[39:13] I hadn't either till I read this. He
[39:15] passed over the Ford Jabbach and he took
[39:20] them and sent them over the brook and
[39:23] sent over that he had. And notice this
[39:26] verse 24 very important first few words
[39:30] here. Verse 24. And Jacob was left
[39:34] alone. And Jacob was left alone.
[39:39] Sometimes God surrounds us with people.
[39:41] Other times he leaves us all by oursel.
[39:44] And sometimes that's where the true
[39:47] change takes place when we're all left
[39:50] alone. And there wrestled a man with him
[39:53] unto the breaking of the day. Verse 25.
[39:57] And when he saw that he prevailed not
[39:59] against him, he touched the hollow of
[40:01] his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's
[40:04] thigh was out of joint as he wrestled
[40:06] with him. And he said, "Let me go, for
[40:09] the day breakth." And he said, "I will
[40:11] not let thee go except thou bless me."
[40:13] And he said unto him, "What is thy
[40:15] name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he
[40:18] said, "Thy name shall be called no more
[40:21] Jacob, but is
[40:25] actually God tells him what his name's
[40:28] going to be." But if you don't if you're
[40:29] not careful and you don't catch it, he's
[40:31] not actually renamed Israel here. This
[40:34] is speaking of what God's going to do in
[40:36] his life. Even after wrestling the
[40:40] angel, the real change hadn't taken
[40:43] place yet. The physical part had because
[40:46] when he leaves this wrestling match,
[40:49] he's limping.
[40:51] And for the rest of his life, he's going
[40:53] to walk with the limp. So notice his
[40:56] outward has changed, but his heart still
[40:58] hasn't changed. Let's keep reading here
[41:00] in verse 28. And he said, "Thy name
[41:03] shall no more be called Jacob, but
[41:04] Israel, for as a prince, thou has power
[41:06] with God and with men, and has
[41:09] prevailed." Jacob asked him and said,
[41:11] "Tell me, I pray thee thy name." And he
[41:13] said, "Wherefore is it that thou dost
[41:14] ask after my name?" And he blessed him
[41:17] there. And Jacob called the name of the
[41:19] place Penile, for I have seen God face
[41:21] to face, and my life is preserved. And
[41:24] as he passed over Panile, the sun rose
[41:26] upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
[41:30] Therefore, the children of Israel, eat
[41:32] not of the sineu which shrank, which is
[41:34] upon the hollow of the thigh unto this
[41:36] day, because he touched the hollow of
[41:39] Jacob's thigh, and the senue that
[41:42] shrank. If you have a need, maybe
[41:44] something upon your heart, you just want
[41:46] to hold your hand up before the Lord.
[41:48] Why don't you just hold that knee up
[41:49] while we go before the Lord in prayer?
[41:51] Jesus, we're needy people. It's
[41:53] identified, Lord, here tonight in just
[41:55] the simple raising of our hands. How we
[41:57] need you, Lord. Lord, there's many, my
[42:00] dad even tonight, Lord, suffering still
[42:03] physically into the effects of some flu
[42:05] bug. Lord, we just pray that you would
[42:08] just be his healer tonight. Be his
[42:10] strength, Jesus. Touch him in his body,
[42:12] Lord. He's weary from, Lord, a lot of
[42:15] change and things happening. Lord, I
[42:17] pray that you just renew his strength,
[42:18] Lord. My mom also and our family, all of
[42:21] those, Lord, in our assembly, Lord,
[42:23] those that couldn't be here tonight. We
[42:25] pray, God, that you would just be near
[42:26] to them, Lord Jesus. And God, while
[42:29] we're here, we just ask that you would
[42:31] let us get oursel out of the way
[42:33] completely, Lord. Both hearer, Lord, and
[42:36] speaker, may we just move oursel aside,
[42:39] our own thoughts aside, Lord, and may
[42:41] you just come and speak a word to our
[42:43] hearts. We want to hear. We ask it in
[42:45] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be
[42:48] seated.
[42:50] The choice of a surrendered heart.
[42:54] [snorts]
[42:55] It's amazing because you hear of this
[42:58] story here in Genesis and you hear of
[43:00] this river Jabbok. It's one that I maybe
[43:03] wasn't super familiar with. I'd read
[43:05] that passage in Genesis many times but
[43:07] never stopped to catch it. That this was
[43:10] actually going to speak to something
[43:11] very important in the spiritual journey
[43:15] of Jacob and to the spiritual journey of
[43:17] every believer. We know that the lives
[43:20] of the the the men's life that would be
[43:22] lived out in the Bible that the Apostle
[43:25] Paul would say that these things were
[43:27] written for our examples. Aren't you
[43:29] glad that others have lived lives before
[43:32] you and that now you can look at those
[43:34] as an example to know how to live your
[43:37] life? And the Bible, Paul would say that
[43:40] we wouldn't we would the things that
[43:41] they did that we seen that were godly,
[43:44] we follow after those kind of things.
[43:46] But the things that we seen that were
[43:48] ungodly, we shun from those kind of
[43:50] things. These things were written to the
[43:52] intent that we don't sin like they sin.
[43:54] That's what the apostle Paul said. And
[43:57] so Jbach is the place actually where
[43:59] Jacob wrestles the angel. It's a
[44:02] powerful life that you read about this
[44:04] man Jacob. And I think we can so relate
[44:06] to his life because Jacob was wasn't a a
[44:10] good man at all. In fact, we've said
[44:12] this many times before. Esau was a much
[44:15] better man than Jacob as far as what you
[44:18] would say from the outward qualities of
[44:21] a man. He was more honest. He was more
[44:24] uh uh you would say hospitable or kind
[44:27] or good-spirited. If you were to meet
[44:29] the two boys, you would think, "Boy, I
[44:32] really like that Esau. He's just a, you
[44:34] know, a guy I want to be around and
[44:36] someone that you really admire, you
[44:37] know, look up to maybe." as far as
[44:40] humanistic qualities, but we know that
[44:42] humanistic qualities is not what God is
[44:45] necessarily attracted to. And so from a
[44:48] humanistic standpoint, Esau was a much
[44:51] better man than Jacob. Jacob we know was
[44:54] his name would mean suppler. And that's
[44:56] not a word we use in our English today,
[44:58] but you would use the word con or or
[45:01] shyers, what brother Brandham actually
[45:03] calls him. He was a shyer. He was a man
[45:06] who didn't always do right. and his life
[45:09] is is chronicled and you could read that
[45:11] all the way through Jacob's life. It
[45:14] would be a a life that was riddled with
[45:16] a lot of uh mistakes, a lot of decisions
[45:19] that cost his not just himself but his
[45:22] own family, even his daughters and his
[45:24] sons. You know, it was his disobedience
[45:27] that led to uh many scars in his life
[45:31] because he never really had a
[45:33] surrendered heart. Brother
[45:35] [clears throat] Donnie and I'm just I
[45:37] sort of touched on this on uh Sunday and
[45:41] I just want to cover it just here just
[45:42] for a moment because there was so much
[45:44] of this that just so uh stuck with me
[45:47] out of uh the sermons that we read that
[45:49] we heard there at camp. One of the one
[45:52] of the sermons that so stuck with me was
[45:53] brother Donnie Saturday night all of
[45:55] them but when he ministered on the
[45:57] danger of an uncurrendered heart and he
[46:01] he distinguished something that I think
[46:04] I just want to bring uh here and the
[46:06] Lord just you know gave me this
[46:08] inspiration even from that sermon he
[46:11] preached on the danger of an
[46:12] unsurrendered heart and I'm te I'm
[46:13] preaching to you on the choice of a
[46:15] surrendered heart because a heart that
[46:17] surrenders is a choice And a heart
[46:21] that's not surrendered is also a choice.
[46:24] And he showed the difference or
[46:26] distinguish distinguished the difference
[46:29] between a lost heart, a lost heart, a
[46:33] heart that's lost, and a heart that
[46:35] isn't lost, but is uncurrendered.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Because the lost heart, we could say, is
[46:41] very obvious. It's never accepted the
[46:43] Lord in their life. They're they're
[46:45] they're in their still in their sinful
[46:46] condition. But the uncurrendered heart
[46:50] exists within a person who maybe had a
[46:53] start for the Lord, maybe had an even an
[46:55] experience with God. You could uh even
[46:58] have something that you could look back
[46:59] to and look to a memory in your life and
[47:01] think, you know, of the time that God
[47:03] dealt with you and maybe you'd point to
[47:05] a youth camp or you'd point to a, you
[47:08] know, some kind of special meeting or
[47:10] some service where God met you in your
[47:13] life. Well, you know, and you could look
[47:14] at some of those experiences that you
[47:16] had, and you've always looked back at
[47:17] that one moment where you felt like
[47:20] something in your heart changed. Well,
[47:22] Jacob could look back at some of those
[47:24] very same supernatural experiences in
[47:28] his own life. We talked about it Sunday,
[47:31] even having a dream and seeing a ladder
[47:33] that goes from heaven and and angels
[47:35] descending and ascending. And further
[47:38] than that, God spoke to Jacob by through
[47:40] those angels appeared unto him and he's
[47:42] in, you know, such so such an awe by
[47:45] that experience that he anoints a
[47:47] pillar, a rock there. And he and he
[47:49] says, "This is the gate of heaven and
[47:50] the house of God." And he calls the name
[47:52] of that place Bethl. But the problem was
[47:55] is that though he had a great
[47:57] experience, he mistook that great
[47:59] experience for a changed or surrendered
[48:03] heart. And so he leaves from that place.
[48:06] And you can read your Bible that for 40
[48:08] years God never you never records
[48:11] another thing in Jacob's life that God
[48:14] is appearing to him. He's serving the
[48:16] Lord. He's trusting God. He becomes
[48:18] actually an idol worshipper. Takes in
[48:20] idols in his own homes and and his
[48:23] wives, you know, you can read about it
[48:24] has those idols are worshiping those
[48:26] idols. some of the things he cast out
[48:29] before God gets a hold of him and he
[48:30] tells him to get rid of your earrings
[48:32] and and your and and your you know your
[48:34] idols and and build an altar. We
[48:36] preached on that on Sunday. But the that
[48:39] uncurrendered heart, Brother Donnie was
[48:41] speaking about is areas that that
[48:44] believers have given they've given, as
[48:46] brother Brandham said, they've given him
[48:48] their heart,
[48:49] &gt;&gt; but they there's parts of or places that
[48:53] they've never really given him full
[48:57] control.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; How many have heard the sermon brother
[49:00] Brandon preached? I'm sure al all as
[49:01] believers, most of us have heard the
[49:03] sermon brother Brandon preaches doors
[49:05] and door. He calls it door to the heart
[49:07] in another in another place. And you
[49:09] could hear brother Brandham as he begins
[49:10] to talk about that very same thought
[49:14] that that we accept him into our life.
[49:16] We accept him into our heart like we
[49:18] would accept a guest who comes knocking
[49:20] at our door and we allow them to come in
[49:22] and and you say, "Come on." And you
[49:24] might even invite them into the kitchen
[49:25] and say, "Would you like something to
[49:27] drink and are you thirsty and sit down,
[49:29] you know, in the living room?" And we
[49:31] what what are we doing? We're
[49:32] entertaining that guest. And the prophet
[49:34] uses that to teach us that that's how we
[49:37] can treat Christ. Sometimes we can
[49:39] invite him in and have a drink and
[49:41] entertain him and fellowship him. But
[49:44] with that guest, much like Christ,
[49:46] that's where we leave him. We don't let
[49:48] him go any further. You don't let that
[49:50] guest go into your, you know, into your
[49:52] bedroom, looking through your closets,
[49:54] underneath your bed. You won't even let
[49:56] him in your people in your cabinets
[49:57] sometime looking in there. But, but this
[49:59] is how Brother Brandham says how we
[50:01] treat Christ. with Christ. He's not just
[50:03] a guest who's there to visit us on the
[50:05] weekend, but we want him to live in the
[50:08] house
[50:09] &gt;&gt; and take up lordship and that that place
[50:13] of lordship over our life.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Many people call him master. Even even
[50:20] Nicodemus says that good master. You
[50:24] know what that word master means?
[50:25] Teacher. That's what that's what he
[50:28] called him. Good teacher.
[50:31] you know teacher what must we do but
[50:33] there's a very big difference you notice
[50:35] he never called him lord
[50:38] &gt;&gt; many people could know him as good
[50:39] teacher good master but do you know him
[50:42] as lord
[50:46] &gt;&gt; he talked about that how that they've
[50:48] never came to a place of true surrender
[50:52] and and that that brother Donnie began
[50:55] to talk about the the dangerous
[50:57] misconception that has crept even into
[50:59] the message amongst believers that you
[51:02] know that when you believe or even when
[51:04] you're you know fil even you could say
[51:06] you know that that when you're filled
[51:07] with the Holy Ghost and when you believe
[51:09] on Christ that somehow you get it all
[51:11] that at that very moment when you
[51:12] surrender your heart and you say I
[51:14] surrendered my heart to the Lord that
[51:16] you've got salvation sanctification the
[51:19] Holy Ghost eternal security and that
[51:21] nothing can go wrong from that point on
[51:24] nothing can happen in your life as
[51:25] brother Donnie said that's a lie
[51:27] straight from the pits of hell a true
[51:29] Christian life is not about a one-time
[51:32] surrender. It's about a daily surrender,
[51:35] a daily dying out. Can you can you help
[51:38] me preach tonight? A daily emptying of
[51:41] yourself and a feeling of the goodness
[51:44] and the fullness of Christ.
[51:47] THE SPIRIT DRAWS YOU FIRST, but that's
[51:50] only the beginning of a liflong
[51:53] work. Can you say amen?
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. talked about Abraham's promises
[51:58] land that God had given him a promise
[52:00] but he didn't inherit it all at
[52:03] land and your seed shall possess the
[52:05] gate of the enemy and your your your
[52:07] seed shall be like the sand of the of
[52:09] the of the shore it shall be like the
[52:11] stars of the sky so there was the
[52:13] promise but Abraham didn't obtain it at
[52:16] that moment can you follow that he had
[52:18] to go on a journey to possess those
[52:21] things that God had promised him
[52:24] and so total obedience
[52:27] as the Philippians 2 I think it's verse
[52:29] 5 says let this mind
[52:32] &gt;&gt; which was in Christ be also in you
[52:36] &gt;&gt; allow it so there's a part of that
[52:39] surrender that that we had that that
[52:41] takes place in our own life
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Jacob as we come back to our text here
[52:46] came to that place where he wrestles
[52:49] with the Lord it's that place called
[52:52] Jabbach
[52:54] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says says it this way that
[52:56] that he's left alone.
[52:59] He's left alone all by himself [snorts]
[53:05] and go and and he's going to the Bible
[53:07] says in verse 22, I'm just going to read
[53:08] it. You don't have to turn. He rose up
[53:10] that night. We read it and and passed
[53:14] over the ford Jabbok. Now this word
[53:17] Jbach is interesting. It means a place
[53:20] of passing over. A place of passing
[53:23] over. It also secondarily means it
[53:27] stands for struggle. Think about that
[53:30] and hold that for a moment.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; It means the place of struggle. He was
[53:34] going to struggle. God didn't int God
[53:36] intentionally brought him to this place
[53:38] of struggle. You've got to wrestle it
[53:40] out, Jacob.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; You've got to struggle with it.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; You've got to you've got to work this
[53:47] thing out.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; I I'm thinking I'm thinking of the words
[53:51] of of the Apostle Paul. when he says,
[53:55] "Work out your own salvation
[53:59] &gt;&gt; with fear
[54:01] &gt;&gt; and trembling."
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Right? And then right after that, he
[54:05] says, "For God workketh for you." It's a
[54:08] powerful thing when you contrast that.
[54:10] Work out your own for God workketh for
[54:13] you. So it's both parts. People say,
[54:16] "What is true surrender?" Well, true
[54:19] surrender has nothing to do with me. Oh
[54:21] yes, it does.
[54:22] True salvation isn't isn't isn't just
[54:24] falling on like quiet. You could study
[54:27] quietism and and it's it's the belief in
[54:29] many many books are written about it and
[54:31] part of part of part some approaches to
[54:34] Christianity is quietism where they
[54:36] believe that that all you really have to
[54:38] do is just surrender. And I'm preaching
[54:40] to you on surrender.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Can I just take just a moment to to to
[54:44] lay this out here for you? There's a
[54:45] very big difference in in just we could
[54:50] say salvation that is all done by God or
[54:54] salvation that you work out yourself
[54:58] or salvation that is all you and not God
[55:00] at all. It's very very big contrast
[55:03] between them. In other words, what is my
[55:05] place in sanctification?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Or is it that God does it all for me? Is
[55:12] there any such thing as is there any
[55:14] truth to true what you would call
[55:18] spiritual discipline in our life?
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Is there even such a thing as
[55:24] selfspiritual
[55:26] discipline? Well, let me read you the
[55:28] words of the Bible. The Bible says,
[55:29] "Gird up the loins of your mind."
[55:33] &gt;&gt; That sounds to me like something you got
[55:34] to do. Hello.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, pull in the loose ends
[55:38] of your own life. Gird them up. Gird
[55:40] them up. gard up the loins of your own
[55:43] mind. And so so we we would say what is
[55:46] the role, you know, in Philippians
[55:48] chapter 2, and you could read that in
[55:50] verse 12 and and verse 13. Why don't we
[55:53] look at that really quickly here just
[55:55] together, just trusting the Lord for
[55:57] this sermon here tonight. And so I just
[55:59] want to
[56:00] &gt;&gt; go at it go at the pace where he wants
[56:03] me here. Notice this is what we quoted.
[56:06] Wherefore, my beloved, as you have
[56:08] always obeyed, not only not as in my
[56:11] presence only, but now much more in my
[56:13] absence. Notice, work out, this is
[56:15] Philippians 2:12, brother Josh, work out
[56:19] your own salvation
[56:22] with fear and trembling.
[56:25] Verse 13, for it is God which workketh
[56:29] in you,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; both to will and to do of his good
[56:34] pleasure. So notice the contrast. Go
[56:36] back to the previous verse. Work out
[56:38] your own salvation with fear and
[56:41] trembling. That's something I've got to
[56:43] do. The very next verse. For it is God
[56:46] which workketh in you. Aha. So it's him
[56:49] that does it through me.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; But what does it take? My surrender.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that good?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Notice this here. And so so you would
[57:01] say, is it me? Is it him? Is it faith?
[57:04] Is it effort? Is it works? Is it faith?
[57:07] Is it just obedience?
[57:09] And so you can see that there's as the
[57:12] prophet of God said, and I love this so
[57:13] much. He talks about that that you could
[57:17] never, and this is in no direct quote,
[57:19] but in in a in and let me just
[57:21] paraphrase something here that anytime
[57:25] you remove the mystery,
[57:28] then you remove the paradox.
[57:31] And with every believer, true believer
[57:34] who's really truly born again, there
[57:36] remains an element of a paradox of your
[57:39] life.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, a paradox is what?
[57:42] Something that can't be, but it is.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon preaches the sermon
[57:46] called a paradox. Let me just sum it up
[57:48] to say that any true Christian who's
[57:51] born of a woman uh for born of a man and
[57:53] a woman by a sex desire and came into
[57:55] the world speaking lies and bred through
[57:58] uh problems and and family strains and
[58:01] complexes and fears and all of us got
[58:04] them. Anybody that is can take that kind
[58:06] of a vessel and really be born again by
[58:08] the spirit of God and yet have a nature
[58:11] change to desire the word of God to
[58:13] thirst for the word of God. You still
[58:15] got mistakes. YOU STILL GOT FAULT. YOU
[58:17] STILL FALL. YET YOU'RE BORN AGAIN OF THE
[58:19] SPIRIT of God. Yet you're at church on a
[58:21] Wednesday night with hands raised
[58:23] saying, "I want more of God." YET YOU'RE
[58:24] GOING TO WALK OUT THAT DOOR AND ALL OF
[58:26] US ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. We're all
[58:28] GOING TO STUMBLE. WE'RE ALL GOING TO
[58:29] TRIP UP. BUT ALL OF US WILL BE BACK HERE
[58:31] ON SUNDAY SAYING, "I I NEED MORE OF GOD.
[58:34] I WANT MORE OF GOD." WHAT IS IT? IT'S A
[58:36] PARADOX to the rest of THE WORLD. YOU
[58:39] SHOULDN'T BE A BELIEVER, but you are.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say hallelujah
[58:44] tonight.
[58:46] And so, so salvation, you could look at
[58:49] this as as this tension runs all the way
[58:52] throughout the Bible. Was it you? Was it
[58:53] God? You repented and believed. Yeah, it
[58:56] graces faith cometh uh you know, not of
[58:59] works but of grace, right?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So, is it is it is it like brother
[59:04] Brandham said, was he was Jesus a man?
[59:06] Yes. Was he a god? Was he God? Yes.
[59:10] Well, which was it? He was a paradox.
[59:13] Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; He was the God man.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You You go take the book of Philippians.
[59:20] Can I ask you something? Who wrote the
[59:23] book of Philippians? Who wrote it? Paul.
[59:26] Hello. Come on. Got Christians here,
[59:28] right? None of y'all believe that Adam
[59:30] wrote that, right? Not Moses.
[59:34] It was Paul.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; But can I ask you who wrote it? You You
[59:38] read the book of Philippians. You see
[59:39] the heart of Paul. You see the
[59:41] inspiration of Paul. He mixes his own
[59:43] experience as a Jew in that book.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Yet, CAN I JUST SAY IT WAS ALL OF PAUL,
[59:49] yet the Bible says that the scriptures
[59:53] were God breathed
[59:57] &gt;&gt; as men were moved on BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[59:59] SO, IT WASN'T PAUL'S WORD, IT WAS THE
[1:00:02] HOLY Ghost
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; speaking through Paul.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yet, it was Paul.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; So, who wrote Philippians?
[1:00:11] Paul or the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; A paradox.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; It's God using the vessel that's
[1:00:20] surrendered
[1:00:23] to him.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And so, let me just go in a little bit
[1:00:28] further. As we talked about quietism,
[1:00:31] it's just this and and we we we have it.
[1:00:33] There's parts of this that you could say
[1:00:35] would be true. You you have the song
[1:00:37] that we sing, let go and let God have
[1:00:41] his wonderful way. Well, that's
[1:00:43] quietism. Let go and let God. That
[1:00:45] mentality that takes it so far that it
[1:00:47] says just let go and let God. God's just
[1:00:49] going to do it all. All you got to do is
[1:00:52] surrender. I thought, brother Matt,
[1:00:54] that's what you're preaching. We we just
[1:00:55] have to surrender. But what role do we
[1:00:58] have
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; in that surrender? Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, it's it becomes a very
[1:01:04] passive way at looking. Just yield,
[1:01:06] surrender. God does everything. And and
[1:01:08] and you you know, you you have
[1:01:10] phosphrases you'll hear like not I but
[1:01:12] Christ. You know, it's all Christ. It's
[1:01:14] just what Christ does. It's not him that
[1:01:15] runth or him that willth, but God that
[1:01:17] showeth mercy. God just does it all,
[1:01:19] brother. You just sit back, relax, and
[1:01:21] just surrender.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; But what does that mean? What part do I
[1:01:25] play in that? Are you Are you hearing me
[1:01:27] here tonight?
[1:01:30] because that's only half the verse. Paul
[1:01:32] says, Paul says, uh, I live yet not I,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; but Christ that liveth in me.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; So, I live yet not I, Christ that liveth
[1:01:43] in me.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; And so, it's an effort to that that says
[1:01:47] we don't there's nothing we need to do
[1:01:49] uh, you know, of oursel. It's it's all
[1:01:52] Christ and and there's nothing we have.
[1:01:54] There's no part of that. There's no
[1:01:56] part, no role that we play in spiritual
[1:01:59] discipline. We just surrender our lives
[1:02:02] to God, get the Holy Ghost, and then God
[1:02:04] just does the rest. We just sit back and
[1:02:08] and I tell you where you end up. You end
[1:02:10] up just like Jacob.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; A lot of scars. Daughters that are uh
[1:02:16] you know uh d their lives are destroyed.
[1:02:19] sons become murderers because of that
[1:02:22] that her you know uh uh you know I don't
[1:02:24] want to get into it here tonight but
[1:02:25] some of the horrible things that
[1:02:27] happened to Dena Jacob's daughter and
[1:02:29] then the sons go to kill the go to kill
[1:02:31] the men so Jacob leaves after
[1:02:33] disobedience because he never
[1:02:34] surrendered his heart
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; and it and his family he doesn't just
[1:02:38] live with the scars
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; you see the danger of of an uncsured
[1:02:43] heart brothers can I just speak to you
[1:02:45] for a moment
[1:02:47] the danger of an uncured heart is all
[1:02:51] those who follow that uncsured heart
[1:02:55] and the collateral damage that followed
[1:02:59] Jacob's life would be worse in his wives
[1:03:02] and his his wife and his children.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; They lived with the scars in their own
[1:03:09] life of a father who never fully
[1:03:13] surrendered his heart.
[1:03:18] and and and you know the story he he
[1:03:21] ends up that way with just just a life
[1:03:24] that was never surrendered. Now on the
[1:03:26] other side of that you have pyotism.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; You know what that is?
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You know just work harder, do better,
[1:03:34] work harder, you know, just is we're
[1:03:37] just it's it's the thought or the belief
[1:03:38] that we can somehow work it all out
[1:03:40] oursel
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and we can be holy because of how we
[1:03:44] dress or how long our
[1:03:48] Don't smile. All listen friends, none of
[1:03:50] those things will get you in a rapture.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; If you want to talk about piety, go talk
[1:03:54] to a go talk to a, you know, a a
[1:03:57] hutterite or a Menite. Some of the most
[1:03:59] what you would call pious people that
[1:04:02] live holy lives, what we would call
[1:04:04] holy. None of that is going to get them
[1:04:05] in a rapture. The holiness that we need
[1:04:08] is, the Bible says, is be adorned with
[1:04:10] the holiness of the heart.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] And so
[1:04:16] pyotism on the other hand emphasizes
[1:04:18] personal effort, discipline, and
[1:04:20] obedience.
[1:04:24] And so it you say, "Brother Matt, well,
[1:04:26] do we believe that there's a part of
[1:04:29] this that we have to play?" Yes, there's
[1:04:31] a part in your own surrender that you
[1:04:33] have to play. There's a life of
[1:04:34] sanctification. Can we just get real
[1:04:36] simple here tonight? There's a dying
[1:04:38] out. And that dying out isn't just a
[1:04:40] fancy fancy cliche and you sit in a
[1:04:42] church service and we raise our hands
[1:04:43] and say, "I want to draw closer to the
[1:04:45] Lord." That's all well fine and good and
[1:04:47] wonderful. But if you don't put action
[1:04:49] to that prayer and start dying out by
[1:04:52] getting rid of things, cutting things
[1:04:54] off, I'm talking about very physical
[1:04:55] things and chopping off uh you know,
[1:04:58] friendships that aren't pleasing to God
[1:05:00] that lead you away from the from from
[1:05:02] the Lord. uh friendships or you know I
[1:05:05] don't care what you want to name friends
[1:05:06] family doesn't matter uh who it is or
[1:05:08] what it is things in our home things in
[1:05:10] our car things that we listen to things
[1:05:12] that we watch places that we go
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; you'll never come to a surrendered heart
[1:05:17] if you're not willing to DO SOMETHING TO
[1:05:20] SURRENDER your heart
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; and so so the scripture says in verse 12
[1:05:28] again brother Joshua put it back up work
[1:05:31] out your own salvation
[1:05:33] with fear and trembling. Verse 13, for
[1:05:36] it is God which workketh in you both to
[1:05:40] will and to do.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; His good pleasure.
[1:05:49] And so I just want to move from that
[1:05:50] here just for a moment and come back to
[1:05:53] our our story of Jacob because he comes
[1:05:56] to this place that means a struggle
[1:05:59] uh uh to empty and to pour out. There's
[1:06:04] got to be a struggle. Life is about a
[1:06:05] struggle. Your Christian life is about a
[1:06:08] struggle. Your journey's about a
[1:06:09] struggle. You say, "What's the struggle,
[1:06:11] Brother Matt? Bills and and No, not the
[1:06:14] not that kind of a struggle. That's just
[1:06:16] the that's just the curse that we live
[1:06:18] in. The kind of struggle I'm talking
[1:06:20] about is the struggle with yourself,
[1:06:22] your nature, your will, your passion,
[1:06:25] your desire, your mind, those things
[1:06:28] which are contrary to God. Any thought
[1:06:30] that exalts itself above the knowledge
[1:06:32] of Christ, the struggle is is taking
[1:06:35] those thoughts captive and saying, "I'm
[1:06:36] not going to think those thoughts
[1:06:37] anymore, Lord. I'm not going to confess
[1:06:40] those thoughts anymore." uh the the the
[1:06:42] the struggle to spend time with the
[1:06:45] Lord, a daily walk with the Lord. Can
[1:06:48] you say amen?
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That's the struggle I'm talking about.
[1:06:52] Jacob came to this place of struggle.
[1:06:54] That word Jbok also means to empty. To
[1:06:58] empty and to pour out.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; To empty and to pour out.
[1:07:08] This is the the place that so many of us
[1:07:12] need to come to. As the Lord just dealt
[1:07:14] with my heart this afternoon,
[1:07:16] this is the place where we come to the
[1:07:20] end of our self.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; And and and we've got, if you could just
[1:07:24] say it this way, YOU GOT TO HAVE IT OUT
[1:07:26] with God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; H one onone
[1:07:32] a place where you're as Jacob was left
[1:07:35] alone. No church, no choir, no singers,
[1:07:38] no pastor, no prayer, nobody laying
[1:07:41] hands on you. The prophet of God would
[1:07:43] call it the backside of the desert
[1:07:46] experience
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; where Moses had all of the intellect. He
[1:07:52] knew what the word was. He had all the
[1:07:54] he had all of the understanding of what
[1:07:56] his mother had taught him.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said he had all
[1:08:00] of his intellectuals and God had
[1:08:01] equipped him. But but he lacked that
[1:08:05] burning bush backside of the desert
[1:08:07] experience.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Yet with all of his intellectuals, he
[1:08:12] was trying his best to live a Christian
[1:08:15] life. And the prophet of God said it
[1:08:16] this way. What good did all of his
[1:08:18] intellect get him? One dead Egyptian.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's all it produced.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Same thing for the Apostle Paul. what it
[1:08:26] what it what it all of as knowledge and
[1:08:29] everything that he gained and everything
[1:08:31] that he learned and he comes to a place
[1:08:33] to where he says I count it all as dung
[1:08:36] for Christ
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I count it all as loss
[1:08:41] it got him nothing got him nowhere Jacob
[1:08:44] with all of your as we said Esau was a
[1:08:47] much better man Jacob was a terrible man
[1:08:49] a man who ran from God man who ran from
[1:08:52] the purpose of God or the plan of God
[1:08:54] for his life
[1:08:56] and and he comes to this spot of Jac
[1:08:59] Jabbach
[1:09:00] where he faces God for himself. It's a
[1:09:03] place of struggle. It's a place of
[1:09:06] pouring out and emptying out. It's a
[1:09:08] place of passing over,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; we could say.
[1:09:14] And it that that I think it's so
[1:09:15] powerful because you you think of the
[1:09:17] crossings of the Jordan. you think of
[1:09:20] and you hear that story and you think of
[1:09:22] the crossing of the Red Sea with Moses.
[1:09:24] There's two powerful places you could
[1:09:26] talk about in the scripture. One of them
[1:09:28] you could say symbolizes, you know,
[1:09:30] death, leaving Egypt, leaving the world,
[1:09:32] uh, you know, leaving sin and then then
[1:09:34] to cross the Red Sea would be to enter
[1:09:37] into the promise. Many who crossed the
[1:09:39] Red Sea never crossed the Jordan Sea.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Many people left
[1:09:44] Egypt, but Egypt never left their heart.
[1:09:48] You could take them out of Egypt, but
[1:09:49] you got to get Egypt out of the person.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Because many people left Egypt, but they
[1:09:54] never crossed the Jordan.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; And can I SAY, BUT IT'S NOT JUST IT'S
[1:10:00] NOT JUST THE Red Sea that you need to
[1:10:02] cross. It's not just Jordan that you
[1:10:04] need to cross, but this this spot of
[1:10:08] Jabbok,
[1:10:10] not just a spiritual land, a promised
[1:10:12] land of blessing or salvation, being
[1:10:13] baptized or filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:16] Uh uh all of those things are essential.
[1:10:20] But we hear so much about this word
[1:10:22] surrender. You say, "Brother Matt, you
[1:10:24] preach about surrender, but really what
[1:10:26] does it mean to say I surrender my
[1:10:28] heart?" As brother Donnie preached on
[1:10:30] the danger of an unsurrendered heart.
[1:10:32] How do I what is surrender? What does it
[1:10:35] mean in literal terms? The dictionary
[1:10:37] says it means to give up something to
[1:10:40] another person. It also means to
[1:10:42] relinquish something that was granted to
[1:10:46] you. This could mean possession, could
[1:10:48] mean power, it could mean your goal,
[1:10:49] your ambition, your desire, your drive,
[1:10:51] even your life.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; To give something, to surrender your
[1:10:55] life, to surrender something. But but we
[1:10:58] so so we talk about this. What does a
[1:11:01] surrender mean? But but but let me just
[1:11:03] say this. The surrendered life is the
[1:11:06] act of giving your life back to the one
[1:11:11] who granted you your life.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; It's relinquishing control.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; It's totally all power, all direction,
[1:11:23] all authority.
[1:11:25] It's totally resigning your life over to
[1:11:30] his hands
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; to do as he [snorts] pleases.
[1:11:36] Jesus
[1:11:38] comes to a spot in his life in John
[1:11:40] verse chapter 6 verse 38.
[1:11:43] He says, "I came down from heaven." You
[1:11:45] know this very well. John 63838 brother
[1:11:49] Josh he says I came from heaven not to
[1:11:52] do notice not his own will not what he
[1:11:55] wanted his earthly desire his earthly
[1:11:58] ambition that he had as a human but he
[1:12:00] says not to do my own will but the will
[1:12:05] of him that sent me
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; he says in chapter 8 and verse 50 I seek
[1:12:12] not my own glory I just want to say it
[1:12:15] this way Jesus did nothing for himself.
[1:12:20] He he made of himself, the Bible says,
[1:12:22] of no rep uh uh reputation. He took him
[1:12:25] took upon himself the form of a servant.
[1:12:29] Made himself of no reputation.
[1:12:33] He made no move. He spoke no word. He
[1:12:37] went no place except the father led him.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Except he had instructions. I'm
[1:12:44] preaching to you on what a surrendered
[1:12:47] life looks like.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; How many want it?
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; This is what it looks like. I do
[1:12:54] nothing. He says in chapter 8 verse 28,
[1:12:58] I do nothing of myself, but as my father
[1:13:02] hath taught me, I speak these things,
[1:13:05] for I do always that which pleases him.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; So you can see this humanity that came
[1:13:15] under surrender. Very different than
[1:13:17] Jacob.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Uh but but a a clay that came under the
[1:13:21] full surrender to the potter
[1:13:24] and and and he and he and you say,
[1:13:26] "Well, Jesus was God in flesh, brother
[1:13:28] Matt." You know, come on. You're talking
[1:13:30] about the Emmanuel. His blood flowed
[1:13:33] through. Emanuel's God's blood flowed.
[1:13:35] Let me tell you something, FRIENDS. GOD
[1:13:37] NEVER came to be a human TO SHOW YOU
[1:13:39] WHAT GOD HOW GOD CAN OVERCOME. HE CAME
[1:13:43] AS a man to SHOW YOU HOW A MAN CAN
[1:13:46] OVERCOME the world. HE WAS FULLY GOD. HE
[1:13:49] WAS FULLY MAN. AND HE WAS MADE A HIGH
[1:13:51] PRIEST. HE WAS MADE UH h you know in
[1:13:55] every form. Everything the prophet OF
[1:13:57] GOD SAID. AND HOW DO I OVERCOME
[1:13:59] EVERYTHING you could be tempted with in
[1:14:02] your human life? Jesus suffered that
[1:14:04] temptation.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Right. women. Brother Brandham says,
[1:14:08] alcohol, drugs, all of those things that
[1:14:10] you could ever suffer in temptation,
[1:14:14] Christ suffered it, was tempted by it,
[1:14:17] and overcame it.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; He says, you say he was well, he was,
[1:14:22] you know, you're talking about the blood
[1:14:23] of God, but he came to earth to live not
[1:14:26] as God, but as a human being. He
[1:14:29] experienced life. Can I say it to you
[1:14:31] this way? In the same exact way that you
[1:14:33] experience life, he experienced
[1:14:36] depression, anxiety, trouble, oppression
[1:14:40] to the place where angels would have to
[1:14:42] come and minister to his spirit because
[1:14:45] he was so low.
[1:14:48] Then he would say that my my the you
[1:14:50] know my my uh the spirit is he his
[1:14:53] spirit was heavy under great heaviness
[1:14:57] and and but yet he he he he surrendered
[1:14:59] his life. He says here in John chapter
[1:15:03] 10 verse1 17, therefore doth my father
[1:15:06] love me. Notice this is verse 17,
[1:15:08] brother Josh of chapter 10. Therefore
[1:15:11] doth my father love me because
[1:15:16] I laid down my life.
[1:15:21] Can I just say this to you here today?
[1:15:24] The the surrender that Jesus had to the
[1:15:29] father was not forced upon him
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; by his father
[1:15:37] but he chose to surrender his life.
[1:15:43] Amen.
[1:15:44] The surrendered life is not imposed on
[1:15:48] anyone. It's not forced upon anyone.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; It's not even asked. Listen to me
[1:15:54] friends. This is this is so powerful
[1:15:57] when you when you catch this. The way
[1:15:58] just the way that the even the scripture
[1:16:00] just makes it so clear. Therefore doth
[1:16:03] my father love me because I laid down my
[1:16:06] life that I might take it again. Notice
[1:16:08] no man taketh it from me. But he wanted
[1:16:12] to make this clear. But I lay it down of
[1:16:15] myself.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I have power to lay it down and I have
[1:16:19] power to take it up again. Hallelujah.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus was saying, "This
[1:16:26] is an act of self surrender that's
[1:16:29] totally within my power to either deny
[1:16:33] or accept."
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; This is my choice. I hope you're
[1:16:38] catching this here tonight. And I'm not
[1:16:40] doing this because someone told me. I'm
[1:16:42] not doing this because the father forced
[1:16:44] me. I want you to know I'm doing this of
[1:16:46] my own accord. I'm choosing to lay my I
[1:16:51] have the privilege over my life. Brother
[1:16:53] Brandham said he had that right as a man
[1:16:56] to live his own life to search his own
[1:16:58] dreams. But he chose as a man because of
[1:17:01] you and me the joy that was set before
[1:17:04] him. He chose to lay down his life.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I love this. And he says, "And I have
[1:17:12] the power to take it up again. So
[1:17:14] nobody's taking my life from me.
[1:17:18] He also gave me, listen, Jesus says,
[1:17:23] "If it be thy will,
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me."
[1:17:30] Nevertheless,
[1:17:32] not my will,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; but thine be done.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I choose to do it. I choose it out of
[1:17:42] love and surrender to him. So, can I
[1:17:46] just say this to you? God isn't going to
[1:17:48] force a surrendered life upon you. This
[1:17:52] is really what caught me and the
[1:17:54] inspiration I want to make sure I convey
[1:17:56] to you here tonight. No one's forced.
[1:18:00] I think of the words of Danny Henry. You
[1:18:03] know that prophecy that come over
[1:18:05] brother Brandham's life very well. And
[1:18:08] when that interpretation comes, it says
[1:18:11] because you have chosen the harder way.
[1:18:18] Because you, how many remember this?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Because you have chosen the harder way.
[1:18:24] [snorts]
[1:18:25] I'm failing to recall exactly exact
[1:18:27] words there, but he says because you
[1:18:30] chose the harder way.
[1:18:32] And he says, and it notice it wasn't
[1:18:35] wasn't it wasn't forced upon him. It
[1:18:38] wasn't even pressured upon him.
[1:18:41] And in fact, God could have given him a
[1:18:43] good life even beyond that.
[1:18:46] But he says because you have chosen the
[1:18:49] harder way. And he says, "And it's my
[1:18:52] way."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Thou has chosen," this is
[1:18:57] his words, "the precise."
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Love that. and correct way.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Because you have chosen. I DIDN'T FORCE
[1:19:08] YOU. I DIDN'T PRESSURE YOU. NO ONE MADE
[1:19:10] YOU. IT WASN'T FOR FAME. I promise you
[1:19:12] that. IT WASN'T FOR POPULARITY. THERE
[1:19:14] WAS MANY MEN who who DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT
[1:19:16] WAY THAT WERE a lot more popular than
[1:19:18] him. HE HAD DOORS CLOSED ON HIM, HAD
[1:19:21] FRIENDS WALK AWAY FROM HIM, HAD HIS
[1:19:23] FAMILY WALK AWAY FROM HIM. BUT I WANT TO
[1:19:25] TELL YOU WHAT HE CHOSE. THE PRECISE
[1:19:27] DECISION. BECAUSE IT WAS the same
[1:19:29] decision that Jesus made when he lived
[1:19:32] his life. It was the same decision Paul
[1:19:34] made when he lived his life that said
[1:19:36] IT'S NOT I THAT I MAY KNOW CHRIST AND
[1:19:39] THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION AND the
[1:19:41] fellowship of his sufferings to be made
[1:19:43] conformable unto his death. And brother
[1:19:45] and the PROPHECY SAYS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
[1:19:47] CHOSEN THAT A GREAT PORTION of heaven
[1:19:50] awaits you.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; It was his surrender. God didn't force
[1:19:57] him to do it.
[1:19:58] It was his choice. God leaves that
[1:20:02] choice up to us.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You can look at the life of the Apostle
[1:20:08] Paul. I have so much here. I'm never
[1:20:11] going to get to all of it. So, you just
[1:20:12] forgive me as I just get to the spot
[1:20:14] that I that I believe the Lord is
[1:20:16] calling me to get to and then we'll move
[1:20:18] past that. It was actually the life of
[1:20:21] the Apostle Paul that had a fully
[1:20:23] surrendered life. This is so amazing.
[1:20:26] And I'm just gonna I'm just going to get
[1:20:28] into just a piece of this just here for
[1:20:29] a moment and then uh what we don't get
[1:20:32] to we'll just leave to the Lord. But
[1:20:35] it's amazing because Paul had
[1:20:37] everything. He was a Jesus hater,
[1:20:38] self-righteous persecutor of the church,
[1:20:41] of the Christians. You know the story of
[1:20:43] Saul, he he literally uh you know ga uh
[1:20:46] gave consent and the scripture says he
[1:20:49] hated the church. He says I hated I
[1:20:52] hated them. I hated his followers. He
[1:20:54] was also a man of great education. He
[1:20:57] was greatly educated. Sat under the been
[1:21:00] trained by the best teachers of his
[1:21:02] time. Was a Pharisee as he says of the
[1:21:04] Pharisees.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; And he says I st I strove I forget the
[1:21:08] way he SAYS THAT I LABORED MORE THAN
[1:21:10] ALL.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; He he was zealous of all Jewish leaders.
[1:21:15] He was more zealous and he was on his
[1:21:18] way to success. He was climbing the
[1:21:20] ladder. You could say he had the
[1:21:21] acceptance of the religious school of
[1:21:23] that day. He had a clear mission. He
[1:21:25] had, you know, uh, uh, accolades from
[1:21:28] all of his superiors and patted him on
[1:21:30] the back. You're doing the right thing,
[1:21:31] Saul. You got your whole life planned
[1:21:33] out before you. You live a nice
[1:21:34] comfortable life and not a lot of
[1:21:36] trouble, a lot of money, anything you
[1:21:38] want in life. This was the life of the
[1:21:40] first church age messenger. His whole
[1:21:42] life planned out, knew exactly where he
[1:21:44] was going. I promise you this. He was
[1:21:46] confident that he was in the will of God
[1:21:49] at that moment in his own mind of his
[1:21:51] uncurrentered heart. Remember how
[1:21:53] brother brother Donnie showed us that as
[1:21:55] Peter thought he WAS JUST FINE. LORD,
[1:21:57] I'LL NEVER DENY YOU THOUGH ALL MEN walk
[1:22:00] away from you. He says, "I'll never deny
[1:22:02] you, Lord." And he didn't see his own
[1:22:04] heart wasn't even converted.
[1:22:08] Because just a few chapters later, he's
[1:22:09] denying that he even knows and cussing,
[1:22:11] using profanity to try to distance
[1:22:13] himself. Yet when one moment, I'll never
[1:22:16] deny you, Lord. Though all men walk away
[1:22:19] from you, Lord, I'll never deny you. He
[1:22:22] didn't discern, as brother Donnie said,
[1:22:24] he didn't discern his own heart. I
[1:22:27] promise you, Paul, Saul of Tarsus
[1:22:29] thought he was he was in the will of
[1:22:31] God, doing the work of God, headed for
[1:22:34] success. And so what is the first thing
[1:22:37] God has to do? I'll tell you what. It's
[1:22:39] the first thing God has to do to get a
[1:22:41] heart surrendered to him. He had to
[1:22:44] knock him off of his high horse.
[1:22:47] [laughter]
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; The first thing he had to do is knock
[1:22:51] him off of his horse, blind him.
[1:22:57] And to where he could lift up and say,
[1:22:58] "Who are who are you, Lord?" Saul, Saul,
[1:23:01] why persecutest thou me? Who are you,
[1:23:02] Lord? I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[1:23:07] And that man who was so self-reliant,
[1:23:11] self-built,
[1:23:12] self-made, self-success
[1:23:16] became one of the most surrendered
[1:23:19] vessels
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; in your Bible.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; He became one of the most self reliant,
[1:23:27] Godfilled,
[1:23:28] God dependent.
[1:23:31] And for everything, God led. In fact,
[1:23:34] Paul declared his life a pattern for all
[1:23:37] who desired to live fully surrendered to
[1:23:39] Christ. He says in 1 Timothy 1, "For
[1:23:42] this cause I obtained mercy, that in me
[1:23:45] first Jesus Christ might show forth all
[1:23:48] longsuffering." 1 Timothy 1:16, "For a
[1:23:51] pattern to them which should hereafter
[1:23:53] believe on him to life everlasting." So,
[1:23:57] so in other words, Paul says, "If you
[1:23:58] want to know what a surrendered life
[1:23:59] looks like, look at mine.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Follow me as I follow Christ."
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; You want to have your heart set to go
[1:24:06] deeper in Christ, here's what you can
[1:24:08] expect. Expect to live a life like me.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Now, that's big.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; You see how the the the mood just
[1:24:19] changed right there?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I want to be like Paul.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I want to have a heart surrendered like
[1:24:25] Paul. Okay, let me tell you what Paul's
[1:24:26] life looked like.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what he endured. I WANT
[1:24:30] TO BE LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM. I WANT TO
[1:24:31] LIVE LIKE A HEART LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:24:32] SURRENDERED. OKAY, let's talk about his
[1:24:34] loss.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about his children. Let's
[1:24:37] talk about his life story. Hello,
[1:24:40] somebody.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; He lived such a surrendered life to God.
[1:24:46] I think this is just so powerful. Such a
[1:24:49] surrendered life to God. I'm just going
[1:24:52] to catch my place here. I just had
[1:24:54] something I wanted to read. Brother Adam
[1:24:56] says, "And behold, and behold, I stand
[1:24:57] at the door and knock in 1958."
[1:25:00] He says here, "He cannot save you."
[1:25:02] Listen, he cannot save you against your
[1:25:06] will.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, he cannot save you
[1:25:12] against your will. He won't override
[1:25:15] your human will.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; He's not going to force himself into
[1:25:21] your heart. The prophet of God said it
[1:25:23] this way. He'll take as much as you give
[1:25:25] him.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And if all we're going to give him is
[1:25:28] 10%, he'll take it.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He deserves more, but he'll take what
[1:25:34] you give him. Can I go further?
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; He can't heal you against your will.
[1:25:40] You've got to be willing to open the
[1:25:44] door and invite him in. I just want to
[1:25:47] invite him in.
[1:25:49] in a paradox 1965. You have you do have
[1:25:53] something into it. You say, "What do I
[1:25:55] have in all of this Christian life? What
[1:25:57] part do I play, brother Matt?" Well,
[1:25:59] let's let a a vindicated prophet tell
[1:26:01] us.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You do have something into it. That's
[1:26:05] your surrender
[1:26:08] of your own will
[1:26:11] to the will and any and an idea, brother
[1:26:15] Brandham says, of Almighty God, it's
[1:26:18] finished. That's all there is to it.
[1:26:20] Perseverance
[1:26:22] 1962. You've got to surrender yourself.
[1:26:25] Got to give yourself completely to God.
[1:26:27] You've got to give, you've got to obey
[1:26:30] every bit of the word. Sell out
[1:26:32] completely. Unfelling realities. He says
[1:26:35] God wants a complete surrender. How can
[1:26:38] he show you realities before you
[1:26:39] surrender yourself to him? You've got to
[1:26:42] surrender. But surrender comes at a
[1:26:44] cost.
[1:26:46] It doesn't cost you, brother says in the
[1:26:48] uncertain sound.
[1:26:50] It doesn't cost you one thing. The only
[1:26:52] thing it cost you is just to surrender
[1:26:55] your life to him and receive it. Just
[1:26:59] forget all you ever knowed and surrender
[1:27:02] yourself to him.
[1:27:07] I could read many, many, many more of
[1:27:09] these and I just don't I won't just to
[1:27:11] save time. You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; I want to get to something here and I
[1:27:16] want to make sure I don't miss it before
[1:27:18] we run out of time.
[1:27:21] This pathway that led the Apostle Paul
[1:27:24] to a fully surrendered heart.
[1:27:28] Can I just say it to you this way? The
[1:27:31] path to surrender
[1:27:33] un is the key that unlocks true
[1:27:38] contentment
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; in life.
[1:27:42] path.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You see, so many believers live, we live
[1:27:46] in such sometimes dis such discontent.
[1:27:50] If we're not careful, friends, we'll be
[1:27:52] honest. All of us can be discontent.
[1:27:55] Amen. It's true. I'll raise both my
[1:27:57] hands for you that aren't willing. We
[1:27:59] can all be discontent, unsatisfied. We
[1:28:01] God can give us so much, do so much for
[1:28:04] us, testify only for just 12 months
[1:28:07] later and we're, you know, wy wousy woo
[1:28:10] as brother Jules says and ain't got
[1:28:12] nothing and ain't got nobody and God
[1:28:13] never does anything for me. Friends, if
[1:28:15] we'd be honest, we can all get to that
[1:28:17] place to where even after we get so far
[1:28:20] down the road, we can become so
[1:28:22] discontent, never satisfied with what we
[1:28:25] have, forever looking to the future and
[1:28:27] what's next. And I'm all for that. But
[1:28:29] if that's all we if that's all we do IS
[1:28:31] JUST LOOK TO WHAT CAN I DO? What can I
[1:28:33] get next? WE MISS WHAT GOD HAS DONE AND
[1:28:37] WHAT GOD IS DOING RIGHT NOW IN OUR LIFE.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL GET YOU TO LIVING
[1:28:41] TOMORROW. Live today.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Living today. If I could just do this,
[1:28:45] if I could do that, I'll be happy. And
[1:28:47] it is chase that fulfillment. And that
[1:28:49] fulfillment never comes. It's exactly
[1:28:52] what Paul had to come to in his own
[1:28:53] life. A great test God brought him to.
[1:28:56] God said, he says he's a chosen. Acts
[1:28:58] 9:15, a chosen vessel unto me to bear my
[1:29:01] name before the Gentiles and kings and
[1:29:03] the children of Israel. And so here Paul
[1:29:06] receives this commission. Here's the
[1:29:07] commission. You ready? Paul, you're
[1:29:10] going to stand before kings. Wow.
[1:29:14] Me, Lord, I'm going to stand before
[1:29:18] great men and rulers. What if God told
[1:29:22] you that?
[1:29:24] What if God gave you that kind of a
[1:29:26] promise? I'm going to lead you to such a
[1:29:28] place in your ministry. You're a chosen
[1:29:30] vessel unto me and you'll stand before
[1:29:33] kings. You can imagine. And right away,
[1:29:35] the Bible says straightway he preached
[1:29:36] Christ. Right after he received that
[1:29:38] commission, it says, "I was not
[1:29:39] disobedient to the heavenly vision." And
[1:29:41] he preaches that commission of Christ.
[1:29:43] Preaches Christ to the Gentiles. The
[1:29:45] Bible says straightway he preached
[1:29:47] Christ in the synagogues that he's the
[1:29:48] son of God. He he becomes bolder. He a
[1:29:52] and as God grew as you know in the faith
[1:29:55] the Bible says he increased in more
[1:29:56] strength confounded the Jews which dwelt
[1:29:58] at Damascus that's chapter nine of acts
[1:30:01] pro proving that this is the very Christ
[1:30:04] so he preaches he gets a commission he
[1:30:07] wasn't disobedient to the heavenly
[1:30:08] VISION HE PREACHES CHRIST HE HAS THIS
[1:30:11] GREAT COMMISSION AND THEN WHAT IS THE
[1:30:13] VERY NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS THE JEWS
[1:30:15] TAKE A COUNSEL to say we got to kill
[1:30:17] that man and NOW HE'S GOT A DEATH THREAT
[1:30:21] OH, HIS LIFE. YOU MEAN THIS IS WHAT I
[1:30:23] get for preaching Christ? They're going
[1:30:26] to try to kill me. Yeah. Jesus said they
[1:30:28] hated me. They will hate you.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; If they persecuted me. Somebody help me
[1:30:36] preach.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; They will persecute you. Come on,
[1:30:39] somebody. If you're really living a
[1:30:41] Christian life, it will not be one that
[1:30:43] everybody just admires and just accepts
[1:30:46] and YOU JUST GET SOCIALLY POPULAR AND
[1:30:48] THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS. YOU MIGHT do
[1:30:50] that live in a hybrid version of
[1:30:52] Christianity. But I tell you what, it
[1:30:54] got Paul. It got him cru. It got his
[1:30:56] HEAD CUT OFF. IT GOT JESUS CRUCIFIED.
[1:30:58] BUT I'M HERE TO SAY, I'M not ashamed of
[1:31:00] the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'M NOT HERE
[1:31:02] TO MODERNIZE IT, POPULARIZE IT, MAKE IT
[1:31:05] MORE PALPABLE FOR SINNERS. I'M HERE TO
[1:31:07] BE IDENTIFIED WITH THAT GOSPEL.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; He's he's he's he's told you're going to
[1:31:14] get we're going to kill him right after
[1:31:15] this sermon. The Bible says the Jews
[1:31:17] conspired. I think that's so amazing.
[1:31:20] They conspire to kill him. They take
[1:31:22] counsel so much for that great call to
[1:31:24] preach the gospel to Israel, to the
[1:31:26] Jews. They run him out of their city and
[1:31:28] they reject his message. Not only is it
[1:31:30] one thing to say, "Get out. We don't
[1:31:32] want you to come back." But also to say,
[1:31:34] "We're going to kill that man. We're
[1:31:35] going to we're going to take his life."
[1:31:37] And so he he runs from there and and you
[1:31:40] could say, "Boy, what a start to that
[1:31:41] ministry, man. and you got this
[1:31:43] commission and the next thing at your
[1:31:44] first meeting you ran out of town and
[1:31:47] you're getting chased. You sure you're
[1:31:49] doing right, Paul? You sure you are you
[1:31:52] sure you heard from God?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; So he goes to Jerusalem. You know what
[1:31:58] he wants to do? He says, "I want to meet
[1:31:59] the discip I want to meet Jesus's
[1:32:02] disciples. I want to meet him for
[1:32:04] myself." The Bible says in verse chapter
[1:32:06] nine of acts verse 26 brother Josh but
[1:32:09] they were all afraid of him and believed
[1:32:11] not what he was that he was a discipleh
[1:32:16] he say to join himself to disciples but
[1:32:17] they were afraid of him and believed not
[1:32:19] that he was a disciple. So now you've
[1:32:21] been rejected. It's one thing to get
[1:32:23] rejected by the world. It's another
[1:32:24] thing to get rejected by the brothers
[1:32:25] and sisters in the church.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; They were afraid. Didn't want him. So So
[1:32:32] I went to the Jews. I went to the
[1:32:34] brothers. Finally, alas, I'll turn to
[1:32:35] the Gentiles. Yet, here's Cornelius and
[1:32:38] his house. And and and it's not Paul.
[1:32:41] It's Peter
[1:32:43] who unlocks the door to the Gentiles
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; and preaches the Holy Ghost. And
[1:32:50] Cornelius, as we preached about it
[1:32:51] Sunday, his entire house, he didn't ask
[1:32:53] for Paul, he asked for Peter. Can you
[1:32:56] say amen?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You know, you I just got to be natural
[1:32:59] here. You don't think that that that
[1:33:01] Paul heard of that? think I thought I
[1:33:03] was given the commission. I thought the
[1:33:04] angel appeared to me and yet here's
[1:33:06] Peter over here and man, Lord, what did
[1:33:08] you even call me? Did I even hear from
[1:33:10] you in the first place? Not accept it. I
[1:33:13] tell you what it was. It was God's
[1:33:15] leading a man to full surrender.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be popular. You're
[1:33:23] not going to be accepted. You're not
[1:33:25] going to be loved if you want to live
[1:33:28] this life of surrender. I almost titled
[1:33:31] my sermon that here tonight
[1:33:34] the surrendered life
[1:33:36] because this is what it looks like.
[1:33:39] They they they they ran him out a
[1:33:42] afterwards. Then he goes there and so
[1:33:43] Paul he goes to to uh you know I just
[1:33:47] want to skip some of these notes here.
[1:33:49] And so you can imagine what is going
[1:33:51] through his mind. The disappointment the
[1:33:54] the the lackluster start of what you
[1:33:57] would call the pain the threats to his
[1:33:59] life. But God was teaching Paul one step
[1:34:02] at a time, one trial at a time, how to
[1:34:06] be content
[1:34:08] with whatever the Lord gives you. How to
[1:34:11] be content.
[1:34:14] He preaches in Antioch in Acts chapter
[1:34:16] 13 verse. I'm just going to go. Can I
[1:34:18] have just a five more minutes here?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how long. It's 8:34.
[1:34:26] So, just give me a few more minutes. He
[1:34:28] preaches in Antioch. We know this. And
[1:34:31] he says in Acts 13:46, "Lo, we turn to
[1:34:34] the Gentiles."
[1:34:36] And the word of the Lord is published.
[1:34:37] Verse 48, "Throughout all of the reason
[1:34:40] region,
[1:34:42] it says that yet the Jews stirred up the
[1:34:44] devout and honorable women and raised
[1:34:46] persecution against Paul." This is verse
[1:34:48] 50, "Against Paul and Barnabas and
[1:34:50] expelled them out of their course." I
[1:34:52] know you you think maybe like me and you
[1:34:55] think Paul had this wonderful you know
[1:34:57] lustrous career of preaching you know
[1:34:59] not career but ministry of preaching and
[1:35:01] he was just m preached in 10 revival and
[1:35:03] thousands of people and everybody just
[1:35:05] love I mean come on we're talking about
[1:35:06] the writer of the New Testament here no
[1:35:08] when you ACTUALLY READ HIS LIFE IT WAS A
[1:35:11] LIFE OF A LOT OF REJECTION NO FRIENDS
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN prison
[1:35:18] [laughter]
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; he had a good prison ministry
[1:35:23] Yeah. Had a really good prison ministry.
[1:35:29] And he he he goes from there and and and
[1:35:32] and the Bible says here in chapter 14,
[1:35:35] he says there was an assault made both
[1:35:37] of the Gentiles also the Jews with their
[1:35:38] rulers. Could you imagine the
[1:35:40] discouragement, the confusion that comes
[1:35:42] over the Apostle Paul? It's the same way
[1:35:45] for God's prophets. Same way for brother
[1:35:47] Brandon. parallels between the alpha
[1:35:49] messenger and the omega messenger, the
[1:35:51] first church age messenger, the Paul and
[1:35:53] the last brother Brandham. The parallels
[1:35:55] between both of them, as brother
[1:35:57] Brandham tells us in the church age
[1:35:58] book, those messengers will try to be
[1:36:00] like the apostle Paul. They will try to
[1:36:02] approximate his ministry, but I say none
[1:36:05] of them more so than the last messenger.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; And and the and you can imagine the
[1:36:12] discouragement. You can imagine trying
[1:36:14] to make sense out of all of this.
[1:36:17] And every turn he's trying to do
[1:36:19] something for God and there's a
[1:36:20] objection, there's a hindrance and they
[1:36:22] something's preventing it. And then he's
[1:36:24] he's shipwreck and he's, you know, he's
[1:36:26] he's put in prison. He's tried stone
[1:36:28] almost stoned to death and he just keeps
[1:36:30] going, keeps persevering, keeps going,
[1:36:33] keeps persevering, doesn't give up,
[1:36:35] doesn't question God, just keeps on
[1:36:36] preaching the gospel
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; and at every turn. But God promised him
[1:36:41] a ministry. Listen to this. Yet he was
[1:36:44] cursed, rejected, assaulted physically,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; stoned physically,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; AND HOW DID YOU RESPOND? HOW does a
[1:36:53] surrendered life respond? Philippians
[1:36:55] 4:1,
[1:36:57] I have learned
[1:37:00] in whatsoever state I am.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Therewith
[1:37:07] to be content.
[1:37:09] You didn't question it. You won't find
[1:37:12] it. I don't find it. No. Nowhere do I
[1:37:14] find Paul lamenting, complaining. Why
[1:37:17] me, Lord?
[1:37:19] He says, I've learned. That's an
[1:37:21] important key.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't just get it overnight,
[1:37:26] but he learned
[1:37:29] in whatsoever state. Philippians 4:11,
[1:37:31] brother Josh, in whatsoever state I am,
[1:37:34] therewith to be content.
[1:37:38] He didn't demand, you know, we make
[1:37:40] demands of God. Paul didn't demand
[1:37:42] anything.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; God, I gave my life. You owe me. You
[1:37:47] better do the God. Paul never demanded
[1:37:49] anything from God.
[1:37:51] Yeah. God promised you I promise you to
[1:37:53] stand before kings and rulers. You know,
[1:37:55] but I never find it in my Bible going,
[1:37:56] "Hey, God, what about that uh that thing
[1:37:59] there? You know, I'm getting stoned and
[1:38:02] you said I would preach for kings,
[1:38:05] rulers." He never brought it up.
[1:38:09] never never talked about it. You know
[1:38:12] what it was? Is that Paul was in no
[1:38:14] hurry to see the fulfillment of
[1:38:17] everything God said in his life. He was
[1:38:20] in no hurry.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He knew God would keep his word even if
[1:38:26] it was one day at a time.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; We get so much in a hurry. God, you
[1:38:31] promised this and you promised that and
[1:38:33] you promised THIS TO ME. BUT Paul
[1:38:34] learned, I'm not going to get in the
[1:38:36] hurry. God's faithful.
[1:38:38] God's faithful. I'm going to keep
[1:38:40] pressing. I'm going to keep believing.
[1:38:41] I'm going to keep preaching. I'm going
[1:38:43] to keep pursuing. He will, as Paul says,
[1:38:45] he will keep the thing that he's
[1:38:47] promised unto me unto the day. God will
[1:38:50] be faithful over those things which he
[1:38:51] has promised. He knew he had a promise
[1:38:54] from God. And at that moment, it wasn't
[1:38:57] real. It didn't look real. It didn't
[1:38:59] look possible. But he learned to be
[1:39:02] content to minister wherever he was to
[1:39:06] whoever he could preach to. Didn't have
[1:39:08] to be rulers. It didn't have TO BE GREAT
[1:39:11] CROWDS and thousands of people. Oh, come
[1:39:13] on. Come on. Can I get somebody to say,
[1:39:15] "Let me be that kind of a faithful
[1:39:17] servant." IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO'D YOU
[1:39:19] PREACH TO, PAUL. SELLERS,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; INMATES,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; JEELLERS.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; WHERE'S YOUR CROWDS? WHERE'S YOUR BIG
[1:39:27] MINISTRY? UH, YOU KNOW, WHERE'S ALL
[1:39:29] THOSE THINGS?
[1:39:32] HIM ON THE ON THE RIVER BANK. WHAT WAS
[1:39:34] IT? HE HAD A COMMISSION ON ON HIS LIFE
[1:39:37] AND HE WAS GOING TO BE F FAITHFUL TO
[1:39:39] SAY, "GOD, IT DOESN'T MATTER. I JUST
[1:39:41] WANT TO BE faithful to my commission
[1:39:43] you've placed in my life." I want to
[1:39:45] say, "Lord, let me be faithful. If it's
[1:39:47] to two, if it's to three, if it's just
[1:39:49] small, no matter what it looks like, let
[1:39:50] me be faithful in that commission. Lord,
[1:39:54] let me be faithful. Not jealous of
[1:39:57] others. maybe others he could be jealous
[1:39:59] of ministries that he could look at.
[1:40:02] Paul says in 1 Timothy 6, brother Josh
[1:40:05] verse 6, I love this. Just a few more
[1:40:06] verses and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:40:08] close. I promise.
[1:40:11] He says godliness with contentment. This
[1:40:13] is 1 Timothy 6:6.
[1:40:16] Godliness with How many want to be
[1:40:20] godly?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; But godliness with contentment
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; is great gain.
[1:40:27] He says in ver and having food and
[1:40:29] raignment verse you can keep going. It
[1:40:31] might be verse eight verse seven or
[1:40:33] verse eight. Brother Josh go to the next
[1:40:34] verse. And having food and raignment
[1:40:36] there having food and raignment let us
[1:40:40] be therewith
[1:40:42] content.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; What what's up Paul? What's up with your
[1:40:47] life? I mean you're at the end of your
[1:40:48] journey. You have no savings. You have
[1:40:50] no retirement. You have no house. You
[1:40:52] have no investment.
[1:40:55] And God promised you, God appeared to
[1:40:58] you, an angel. Okay?
[1:41:00] You know, all you have is food
[1:41:05] and clothing,
[1:41:08] a change of clothes,
[1:41:10] that's all you got? I tell you what,
[1:41:12] Paul's answer would be, "Oh, I got so
[1:41:14] much more than that.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; I have one Christ,
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; and that's all that matters.
[1:41:20] I have what real life is."
[1:41:24] Oh, BUT THE DEVIL'S AL ALWAYS COMING
[1:41:26] AFTER YOU, PAUL. No one likes you, Paul.
[1:41:28] You live in constant pain. You even got
[1:41:29] a physical issue in your stomach.
[1:41:32] BOTHERS YOU ALL THE TIME. GOD, AFTER ALL
[1:41:34] YOU'VE GIVEN TO GOD, AND GOD, you've
[1:41:35] prayed and prayed AND PRAYED AND AND
[1:41:37] GOD'S not going to take that. YOU KNOW
[1:41:39] WHAT ABOUT THAT, PAUL? What about what
[1:41:41] about all THAT CONSTANT PAIN? IN FACT,
[1:41:43] YOU SUFFER LIKE NO ONE ELSE SUFFERS,
[1:41:46] PAUL. HOW COULD YOU TRULY UH BE WITH ALL
[1:41:48] THOSE AFFLICTIONS BE TRULY CALLED OF
[1:41:50] GOD? I'LL GIVE YOU THE WORDS OF PAUL. I
[1:41:53] GLORY IN MY AFFLICTIONS. FOR WHEN I AM
[1:41:55] WEAK, THAT'S WHEN HE IS MADE STRONG. I
[1:41:58] don't measure my strength by the world's
[1:42:00] standards. I measure my strength by
[1:42:02] God's word.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; This was the end of his life. This is
[1:42:09] what a true surrendered life musicians
[1:42:11] come looks like.
[1:42:15] I thought you said you'd witness to
[1:42:16] kings. He did.
[1:42:19] He stood before kings.
[1:42:22] The only part God didn't show him
[1:42:26] is that he would have a ball in chains
[1:42:30] when he ministered before kings.
[1:42:33] He'd be an inmate,
[1:42:36] locked up.
[1:42:42] Paul
[1:42:43] a prisoner not of men
[1:42:47] but of Christ.
[1:42:49] Could
[1:42:55] you bow your heads with me here tonight?
[1:42:57] Every head bowed. You could just play
[1:42:58] something softly. Brother and sister
[1:43:00] Deborah.
[1:43:14] What about it, Paul?
[1:43:27] What about your life?
[1:43:30] Have you learned [music]
[1:43:35] in whatever state you find yourself
[1:43:37] [music]
[1:43:39] there with to be content?
[1:43:43] You have a choice. We have a choice.
[1:43:48] I just want to say something so simple,
[1:43:51] so simple. It just strikes me right now.
[1:43:56] Brothers, sisters, men, women, young
[1:43:59] people, it applies to old, young. God
[1:44:02] doesn't What is What does God ask of us?
[1:44:05] Think about that just for a moment.
[1:44:09] What's God asked of you?
[1:44:14] You ever thought about that?
[1:44:19] What's he a what has he asked of your
[1:44:21] life?
[1:44:26] Has he asked you to give your riches?
[1:44:32] Have he has he asked you to gain riches?
[1:44:34] Is that what God asked you to do? Did he
[1:44:37] ask you to rise to the [music] top of
[1:44:39] business and success?
[1:44:44] Did he ask you to chase, reach, [music]
[1:44:47] dream?
[1:44:51] No, actually all God asked
[1:44:55] was for your heart.
[1:44:58] That's all.
[1:45:00] All he asks for is your heart. That's
[1:45:04] it. That's all. Just your heart
[1:45:09] fully surrendered.
[1:45:12] That's all he asks.
[1:45:14] Wonder if we could by an uplifted hand,
[1:45:17] nobody looking around,
[1:45:19] we could just say, "Lord, I want to give
[1:45:22] you my heart fully [music]
[1:45:24] surrendered
[1:45:26] to your purpose."
[1:45:30] Whatever that [music] means for you,
[1:45:31] friend, might mean something different
[1:45:32] for me.
[1:45:36] But whatever that means for you, God
[1:45:38] knows.
[1:45:40] Will you give him
[1:45:42] your heart fully surrendered?
[1:45:50] He don't make you. He don't force you.
[1:45:52] He don't even pressure you.
[1:45:56] You give him 10%, he'll take it. [music]
[1:45:58] Give him half of it, he'll take it.
[1:45:59] He'll live there.
[1:46:02] But what he wants is all of you.
[1:46:06] I'd invite you tonight just to stand to
[1:46:07] your feet with your hands raised and
[1:46:09] say, "God, I want to give it all to you.
[1:46:13] All to Jesus.
[1:46:17] All to him.
[1:46:20] I fully give.
[1:46:24] That's my desire. Lord, I have my hands
[1:46:26] raised [music] on this Wednesday night.
[1:46:28] Service, Lord. Simple. just want our
[1:46:32] heart,
[1:46:33] our ambitions.
[1:46:36] What does it really mean if it has no
[1:46:39] eternal value?
[1:46:44] Paul knew he had didn't have a lot of
[1:46:47] earthly riches or treasures.
[1:46:52] Oh, but he was taken to the third
[1:46:54] heaven.
[1:46:56] He seen things that aren't lawful to be
[1:46:59] uttered.
[1:47:01] And when he got back as your prophet
[1:47:04] was, he was changed never to be the same
[1:47:06] cuz he seen that it's not this world.
[1:47:09] It's not [music] this life that that
[1:47:12] we're even living for. But our treasures
[1:47:15] [music]
[1:47:16] are laid up. Our heart, our true heart,
[1:47:20] Jesus [music] said, out of the
[1:47:23] where your treasure is, there your heart
[1:47:25] is also. And where [music] Paul's heart
[1:47:27] was was not this world, not this life.
[1:47:30] For he said, for it's better for me that
[1:47:32] I go, better for you that I stay. It's
[1:47:35] better for me that I go.
[1:47:38] Let me come to that place of my own
[1:47:39] life, Jesus. For nothing matters really,
[1:47:44] but you. All that really counts, all
[1:47:47] that's really true.
[1:47:50] When it's all been said and done, as the
[1:47:52] song says, did I live my life for truth?
[1:47:56] Did I live my life for you? When it's
[1:47:58] all been said and done, when all the
[1:48:00] dust is settled, when my life is over,
[1:48:05] what will I look back, [music] Lord, to
[1:48:08] things that I held so dear, were they
[1:48:10] really true? Things that I held so
[1:48:13] close, were they really eternal? or did
[1:48:16] I neglect those things that have the
[1:48:19] most value?
[1:48:22] I pray God [music] that you would help
[1:48:23] us Lord even in our daily priorities,
[1:48:26] our daily responsibilities.
[1:48:28] I want to put you first Lord.
[1:48:38] Yes, Jesus.
[1:48:42] All to Jesus [music]
[1:48:46] I
[1:48:47] surrender. [music]
[1:48:50] All to him I freely.
[1:48:57] [music]
[1:48:59] I
[1:49:00] will ever

[1:54:29] Brother George Buckman says, "Prayer
[1:54:31] request tonight for my cousin's husband,
[1:54:33] Steve Broom. He is [music] in St.
[1:54:35] Joseph's in Savannah. He just had his
[1:54:38] second shoulder reconstructive surgery
[1:54:40] after a fall, damaged, and broke the
[1:54:42] original. also suffering from advanced
[1:54:44] Parkinson's [music] and is being
[1:54:46] evaluated for possible stroke. He has
[1:54:48] really suffered a lot over the last few
[1:54:51] years starting with a back surgery that
[1:54:53] went wrong and left him partially
[1:54:55] paralyzed [music] having to use a
[1:54:56] walker. He loves the Lord and he is and
[1:54:59] he and his wife Debbie covet our
[1:55:02] prayers. That's brother George's
[1:55:05] cousin's husband Steve Broom. We want to
[1:55:08] call out his name. Sister Meredith, good
[1:55:11] morning. Um, we could put uh Sister
[1:55:15] Meredith's [music] mother. Sorry,
[1:55:16] reading this as you texted my dad. Uh, I
[1:55:19] want a prayer request for Sister
[1:55:21] Meredith's mom for tonight. She has a
[1:55:23] scan of her belly tomorrow. She's been
[1:55:25] having some symptoms. We're just praying
[1:55:27] [music] for a positive report. Amen. Why
[1:55:30] don't you just put your hand over on
[1:55:32] that one next to you? Let's just call
[1:55:33] out to the Lord Jesus. Lord, we just are
[1:55:36] so grateful [music] we have a refuge,
[1:55:38] Lord. Uh strong and mighty tower, Lord,
[1:55:41] that we can run to when [music] we need
[1:55:44] safety, Lord. And God, your name is
[1:55:48] greater than any disease, any affliction
[1:55:51] bodily. Lord, you see these [music]
[1:55:53] requests. You're the high priest, Lord
[1:55:55] God, who can be touched by the feelings
[1:55:57] of our infirmities. Your prophet taught
[1:56:00] us, Lord, that we can't really pray for
[1:56:02] someone and unless we're able to enter
[1:56:04] into their suffering. So God, I think of
[1:56:07] this man, Steve Broom. [music] Lord
[1:56:09] Jesus, who's there in St. Joseph's
[1:56:11] Hospital, Hel and Debbie, coveting our

[1:56:15] mindful to him. Be merciful, oh God.
[1:56:19] Lord Jesus, we believe that prayer is
[1:56:22] the weapon [music] that we use to fight
[1:56:23] the enemy. So now God, the family of God
[1:56:26] is praying, [music] crying out to you.
[1:56:29] Come and fight the battle that we can't
[1:56:30] win. Do it, Lord Jesus, for this man. I
[1:56:33] pray that there would be a testimony
[1:56:35] that would [music] come from it. Sister
[1:56:36] Meredith, Lord, for her mother having a
[1:56:39] scan of her belly tomorrow, having some
[1:56:41] symptoms. Lord, we believe, we confess a
[1:56:44] positive report. [music] We're just

[1:57:29] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:57:32] Friends, we're going to let you go. I'll

[1:57:35] one pressing testimony we have, we'll
[1:57:38] take a take it. No. Yes. Yeah.

[1:59:09] use your mic there, Ban?
[1:59:11] Yeah.
[1:59:13] Just just
[1:59:19] wanted to thank the Lord. Um, Monday
[1:59:22] morning, uh, we went took the trash. Um,
[1:59:29] and we're pulling in my road and there
[1:59:31] was this truck getting ready to pull out
[1:59:32] and he pulled out right into us and
[1:59:35] pitted us and and uh really the the
[1:59:39] biggest part and we're still waiting on
[1:59:41] insurance. We're just trusting the Lord
[1:59:42] that, you know, he's taking care of us.
[1:59:44] It works all things for our good. But
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; um
[1:59:49] um I was actually leaving the house
[1:59:51] after couple hours and getting
[1:59:54] everything all taken care of and I was
[1:59:56] able to thankfully drive the truck home
[1:59:58] even though the axle is, you know, but
[2:00:02] um so but I got to thinking when we left
[2:00:05] the house, you know, we had had this
[2:00:08] older car seat um that we had um gotten
[2:00:13] from a family here in the church and it
[2:00:16] was about to expire. So, I took the
[2:00:18] bottom portion off as a booster and I
[2:00:20] was she was four years old. I was
[2:00:21] thinking about using as a booster in the
[2:00:23] truck and
[2:00:26] um I had it in there
[2:00:29] and chested her [music] in it and I
[2:00:31] didn't really like the way that the seat
[2:00:32] belt kind of went across her. So, we
[2:00:36] ordered a new booster harness and that's
[2:00:39] what she was in. And I was like, "Thank
[2:00:41] God because you know that could have
[2:00:44] hurt her." So,
[2:00:46] Mindful. Praise God. [music] Thank you,
[2:00:48] Lord. [applause]
[2:00:50] Anybody else before we go? Testimony,
[2:00:53] nobody.
[2:00:55] Amen. We're going to let you be
[2:00:56] dismissed. Sister Jen. Yep. [music]
[2:00:59] Pass this on back to Sister Jennifer if
[2:01:01] you could.
[2:01:11] So, I know some of you guys [music] know
[2:01:13] I've been through a lot physically for
[2:01:15] the past few years, and the Lord's just
[2:01:18] been continue to
[2:01:20] give me my healing and help me to
[2:01:22] overcome. And I I made a promise to the
[2:01:24] devil that whenever I was struggling, I
[2:01:28] would make a point to give a testimony.
[2:01:30] So, I just wanted to thank the Lord for
[2:01:33] my continued healing.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. and um for the Lord just helping
[2:01:37] me to overcome little by little.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying]
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] It's how you give the
[2:01:42] devil a black eye.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen, sister Emily. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And um you you had me do the cameras and
[2:01:52] it was just when you were talking about
[2:01:54] the like the quality of the video and
[2:01:57] stuff.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I was sitting there and I was like,
[2:01:59] "Well, we found this church online, you
[2:02:02] know, in [music] 2020. Yeah,
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; we didn't know anybody here except for
[2:02:05] the demars. And then I'm I just I was
[2:02:09] just it was just like like full circle.
[2:02:11] And then I was doing the cameras
[2:02:12] actually Steve thought that like oh he
[2:02:15] stood back and saw me videoing. And the
[2:02:18] crazy thing is at when we first the
[2:02:22] first person I ever we didn't know any
[2:02:24] of the people any of the churches out
[2:02:25] here. We just were in our own little
[2:02:27] bubble kind of. And I somehow had gotten
[2:02:30] brother Donnie his [music] church. So I
[2:02:32] was like streaming. He was the only
[2:02:33] person I knew and brother Paul Hlet
[2:02:35] that's it. And it was just like so it
[2:02:37] was just like full circle and kind of
[2:02:39] cool that I was doing the cameras and
[2:02:40] I'm like this is our whole story. It's
[2:02:42] online. Um and then just a couple other
[2:02:45] things that the camp is so valuable. Um
[2:02:50] it's worth all the work. [music] I was
[2:02:52] thinking about Annaise a year ago coming
[2:02:54] to town to watch dogs and Rachel said
[2:02:58] you're an answer to prayer. And I
[2:02:59] thought, well, now I'm like, well, she
[2:03:01] was, but not about the dogs.
[2:03:04] Um, and that just is amazing. And then
[2:03:07] also like the first year of camp, Micah
[2:03:09] came to camp.
[2:03:11] You know, God touched him and he met
[2:03:13] Esther. And it's just our lives are so
[2:03:16] amazing. Um, from this being here and
[2:03:20] being at this church, and I'm just I'm
[2:03:22] so grateful. Um, gonna it's worth all
[2:03:25] the work, you guys. Camp's exhausting,
[2:03:28] but our lives have like never been
[2:03:31] better. This is such an amazing church.
[2:03:33] We're so happy to be here.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; We're so happy you're here,
[2:03:38] Lord. Amen.
[2:03:42] Don't you just love what God is doing in
[2:03:45] our lives? You believe the Lord cares?
[2:03:47] [music]
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. About the little details. Amen.
[2:03:50] We're going to take uh no more. I guess
[2:03:52] we'll just uh stop there. All that
[2:03:56] really counts.
[2:04:00] All that's really true.
[2:04:04] All that [music and singing] really
[2:04:06] matterers. No. Can we sing it just
[2:04:08] before we go? Oh,
[2:04:13] everything [music]
[2:04:14] to gain,
[2:04:18] nothing now [music] to lose.
