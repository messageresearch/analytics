[0:19] All right. Good morning.
[0:22] So, let's all stand and have a word of
[0:24] prayer.
[0:28] Gracious Father, Lord, we
[0:31] want to invite you into our Sunday
[0:32] school this morning. Start our Sunday
[0:34] school with a talking to you, Lord. that
[0:38] father that I could read some text, read
[0:41] some scripture, have some thoughts, but
[0:43] Lord, without you providing the context
[0:45] for it, without you providing the
[0:47] thoughts, Lord, we'd be surely in a bad
[0:50] situation.
[0:52] So, Father, we ask that you would meet
[0:53] us here. Grant, inspire me, Lord, in my
[0:56] thoughts and in my inspire my my words,
[1:00] Father, that what I would have for the
[1:02] people would not be in vain and it would
[1:04] not be um it would not be
[1:09] useless, Father. Father, that if you
[1:12] would speak through me, Lord, that these
[1:14] people would be able to take something
[1:15] from it. They'd be blessed, Lord, that
[1:19] they could draw strength and courage for
[1:21] what we would have to say today. We ask
[1:23] that you'd be with us throughout the
[1:24] morning into the service. Father, we ask
[1:26] this in Jesus precious name. Amen. Um, I
[1:31] want to turn to Hebrews 11:es
[1:36] 1 through3.
[1:43] This is
[1:44] going to be covering a pretty simple
[1:46] topic this morning. um want to go try
[1:49] try to go slower than I normally do
[1:51] because I it's more than what I can
[1:54] cover in one one go and I'll try to pick
[1:56] it up on another time uh if I can't
[1:59] finish today. But um I want to that my
[2:02] subject for today is uh my title is
[2:05] faith is a choice is my is my title and
[2:10] um we'll start with a real real um I
[2:15] guess well-known scripture here. um
[2:17] Hebrews 11 and verse one and it says,
[2:21] "Now faith is the substance of things
[2:23] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[2:24] seen. For by it the elders obtained a
[2:27] good report. Through faith we understand
[2:30] that the worlds were framed by the word
[2:33] of God, so that things which are seen
[2:35] were not made of things which do
[2:37] appear." Um y'all can be seated.
[2:40] Um, so
[2:46] I just
[2:49] I want to u just a little bit of
[2:52] commentary on this. Um, so obviously
[2:55] we're all familiar with the scripture.
[2:56] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:58] for the evidence of things not seen. Um
[3:01] and then down in verse three it says
[3:03] through faith we understand that the
[3:04] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[3:06] that things which are seen were not made
[3:09] of things which do appear. Now obviously
[3:12] you know especially in this particular
[3:14] church we all very familiar with the
[3:16] concept of faith. You can't really
[3:17] follow the message of the hour without
[3:19] being well um I guess inundated with
[3:23] concepts regarding faith and and having
[3:25] faith and that faith can move mountains
[3:27] and the power of faith and what faith
[3:29] can do and that faith is not simply some
[3:32] it's not just some name it claim it kind
[3:34] of a thing but it's it's got some power
[3:37] in it. It's got it's got um ability to
[3:41] actually do things in the world, right?
[3:43] I mean, a lot of people um you just
[3:45] different denominations that different
[3:47] different takes on theology would almost
[3:49] have God as a an uninterested entity
[3:53] that that God would have created
[3:56] mankind, created the world, created the
[3:58] universe, and just sort of let it go and
[4:00] isn't particularly involved in the
[4:01] day-to-day affairs of humanity or his
[4:04] children. And um you know and or or is
[4:08] something as simple as you know what
[4:09] brother Brandham dealt with a lot you
[4:11] know very summed up very uh poignantly
[4:13] is you know the idea that the days of
[4:16] miracles are passed that faith and the
[4:17] power of faith is just simply something
[4:19] that was for you know the Bible days or
[4:22] something that was for a select group of
[4:24] people who were around Jesus or you know
[4:26] the prophets or what have you. Um and
[4:30] that that their faith can actually do
[4:31] something in the world. Um but our faith
[4:33] is just more esoteric and and sort of
[4:36] ephemeral and we just sort of have faith
[4:37] in a concept and um the you know that's
[4:41] as far as it goes. It doesn't actually
[4:43] do anything in the real world other than
[4:45] you know when one day you you kick the
[4:46] bucket and you go to heaven. Um that's
[4:50] you know like that's the extent of a lot
[4:52] of people's idea of faith and you know
[4:56] you know you have you you make state you
[4:58] know say things like well I'm going to
[4:59] have faith for healing and you know oh
[5:02] you know that's very nice you know maybe
[5:03] maybe the Lord will do something for you
[5:06] um and that's like that you know that's
[5:08] about as far as it goes but nobody
[5:09] really thinks of like oh faith is is
[5:11] literally something that's going to
[5:13] alter the fabric of reality to make
[5:15] someone who's dying not dying. Um,
[5:19] unless you're in a message church, in
[5:20] which case, if you don't believe that,
[5:22] why are you here? You know, this is this
[5:26] is, you know, this is this is where we
[5:28] come to have faith, right? This is, you
[5:29] know, this is we we believe this that
[5:31] the same Christ that was alive 2,000
[5:34] years ago is alive today. And the same
[5:36] healing that was done then can be done
[5:37] now. on the same the same you know the
[5:40] same power of God that moved on in any
[5:42] prophet's life
[5:45] you know if if you have faith can move
[5:46] in your life you know it's the same
[5:49] whatever you would have need of God can
[5:50] move in a very tangible real way that
[5:52] it's not just some sort of conceptual
[5:53] healing or you know um it's not just
[5:57] some concept of of healing but but
[6:00] literal actual real deal make the lame
[6:03] walk blind to see healing
[6:05] or or provision or whatever you know of
[6:07] people who who are, you know, for
[6:09] whatever reason, maybe they're
[6:10] destitute. you know, things things
[6:12] happen um outside of our control and and
[6:15] we end up in a in a tight place. And
[6:16] sometimes we need not just healing in
[6:19] our in our body per se, but maybe we
[6:21] need healing in our spirit and our mind
[6:22] or perhaps we just need provision in
[6:24] terms of, you know, um like, you know,
[6:28] very, you know, we we we think of the uh
[6:31] the scripture of the of the of the woman
[6:33] who who was uh her her cruise of oil
[6:36] never went dry and her her flower never
[6:38] was gone, you And you know, brother
[6:39] Jason tells a story about this about how
[6:41] I went to India and there was a lady who
[6:42] is in India. So it's not like, you know,
[6:44] they're they're not exactly in a in an
[6:46] economy where food's just fallen out of
[6:48] the sky. And a lot of people are very
[6:50] destitute and poor and they literally
[6:51] live off of begging and the the handouts
[6:54] of strangers. And here's a woman who
[6:56] literally experienced that. She took a
[6:57] hold of a scripture, saw it in the a
[6:59] promise in the Bible of a of a woman who
[7:01] accepted the word for her day and that
[7:03] the Lord never let her her meal uh go
[7:07] empty. And brother Jason saw it with his
[7:09] own eyes. You ask him about it, he'll
[7:10] tell you about it.
[7:12] And you know how this woman took a hold
[7:14] of that promise and prayed and her
[7:16] flower jar literally never went empty.
[7:18] She could make a whole dinner out of it
[7:21] and at the at the end open the lid and
[7:23] there's it is full back so far that the
[7:25] logo on the bottom of the jar was
[7:26] stamped in the flower,
[7:28] right? It just packed it up. You know,
[7:30] this is this is what we believe. And if
[7:31] we don't believe this, then you know
[7:34] where's what's the purpose of of of
[7:37] believing,
[7:38] right? What's the purpose of anything?
[7:39] If God is just sort of, you know, at
[7:42] what point, how are you really any
[7:43] different than anybody else? if you know
[7:45] any other you know one of the other
[7:48] 40,000 interpretations of the scripture
[7:50] if it can't actually do anything you
[7:53] know it's not because if it can't if if
[7:55] if faith in the word for your day cannot
[8:00] do the miracles of the Bible right it
[8:02] cannot do the things in the Bible you
[8:04] know that the that the Bible has shown
[8:06] that the Lord has done then why should
[8:08] we believe that it's going to do
[8:09] anything as far as spiritually as far as
[8:10] changing who we are
[8:12] right I mean it's the same promise the
[8:14] The same promise of salvation is the
[8:16] same promise for healing, right? Isaiah
[8:18] 53, he was, you know, you know, he he
[8:22] was he was uh crucified for our sins,
[8:24] but also for our healing. So it's, you
[8:27] know, if you if it can't do one, then it
[8:28] can't do the other.
[8:31] And so that's why faith is so important.
[8:35] Um
[8:38] and it you know it it and believing
[8:41] right believing the word is so important
[8:44] right you believe the word for your day
[8:46] that's what that's you know and we we
[8:48] know this but
[8:50] you know and even so far as um you know
[8:52] it says through faith we understand that
[8:54] the worlds were framed by the word of
[8:56] God so that things which are seen were
[8:58] not made of things that do appear
[9:02] in verse three in in Hebrews 11.
[9:05] Um, and so even so even God had to have
[9:09] faith in his own word, right? If by
[9:12] faith well then if God made the world
[9:14] then he had to have faith in order to do
[9:15] that. He says by faith that he he did
[9:17] it. Um this is from uh who is God in
[9:22] 1950. He says, "And I can see him out
[9:24] there." And he spake and said, "Let
[9:27] there be light." And there was nothing.
[9:28] But there was something happened. And an
[9:30] atom turned turned there and began to
[9:33] whirl around this way. The sun began
[9:35] began to come into existence because he
[9:37] said, "Let there be." There's the
[9:39] authority. Where did he make it from? I
[9:42] don't know. There was nothing to make it
[9:44] from, but he believed his own word and
[9:47] there was light. I can see a piece fly
[9:49] off of that. It's a meteor. So God even
[9:53] God has God has to have faith in his own
[9:55] word.
[9:56] Amen.
[9:56] Right? That's the mechanism that God
[9:59] uses to speak things into existence. If
[10:02] you want to speak things into existence,
[10:04] you have to operate by the same
[10:05] mechanism God does, which is to have
[10:07] faith in God's word.
[10:08] Okay.
[10:10] Now, um I want to move on to Romans
[10:14] chapter 10 and verse 14. Says um how
[10:18] then shall they call on him whom they
[10:20] have not believed? And how shall they
[10:22] believe on him whom they have not heard?
[10:24] And how shall they hear without a
[10:26] preacher?
[10:28] And how shall they preach except they be
[10:30] sent? As it was written, how beautiful
[10:32] are the feet of them that preach the
[10:34] gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[10:36] of good things. But they have not all
[10:38] obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah said,
[10:40] Lord, who hath believed our report? So
[10:44] then faith cometh by hearing, and
[10:46] hearing by the word of God.
[10:49] Now I want to um note something here
[10:53] right again this is another well-known
[10:55] scripture that we have regarding faith
[10:56] and where what is it and where does it
[10:58] come from um
[11:02] so
[11:04] um
[11:06] because going back to my title I said
[11:07] faith is a decision right at the end of
[11:10] at least this is the way I think about
[11:12] it I mean people can people can have
[11:15] their own approach to it I guess but the
[11:18] I've it's always made sense to me is
[11:20] that faith is a decision. That's how it
[11:23] works tangibly, right? That's how it
[11:24] works in the real world. Because at some
[11:26] point, you're going to be presented with
[11:29] the word of God or your own experiences.
[11:33] And you have to make a decision as to
[11:35] whether to believe the word of God or
[11:38] the evidence of your lying eyes.
[11:40] Right? You have to make a decision. And
[11:42] it it's going to come down to a
[11:43] decision. Now, if you want and I'm going
[11:46] to get into that here in a minute. I'm
[11:47] just kind of laying a little bit of
[11:49] groundwork here. But the point about
[11:51] faith coming by hearing,
[11:54] you know, we we know that, okay, well,
[11:56] it's not just like, okay, well, you
[11:57] listen with your ears. Well, it's listen
[11:59] and believe, right? You listen and then
[12:02] when you hear the word of God, you have
[12:05] that is now a decision point. Do you
[12:10] accept it and say that's nothing but the
[12:11] truth? Or do you find some reason as to
[12:14] why it either doesn't apply to you or it
[12:16] doesn't apply the way that you would
[12:18] think it does or somehow not attach it
[12:21] to yourself? Right? There's a a um it's
[12:26] like that story brother Brandham tells
[12:27] about the the the pastor and he's like,
[12:29] "Well, I believe I can run across this
[12:30] log." And the brother says, "That's
[12:31] fine." "Well, I believe I can run across
[12:33] the log with another log on my back."
[12:34] "Oh, brother, I believe that's your
[12:36] faith. You can do it." Well, I can push
[12:37] a wheelbarrow across the log with a with
[12:39] another log on my back. Oh, brother.
[12:41] That's your faith. Believe pastor. I
[12:43] think that you could do it. You you you
[12:44] know, through all God all things are
[12:46] possible. All right. Now, you get in the
[12:48] wheelbarrow. No way. Right. It's it's
[12:52] people. We have this concept of faith.
[12:54] We have a concept of faith that oh well
[12:57] um you know we we have a mental
[12:59] understanding of it but the minute that
[13:01] it goes to attach to you suddenly our
[13:03] decision is to ah no we're not going to
[13:05] we're not going to attach that to me
[13:06] right um another example this is kind of
[13:09] for my own life um so I have a very
[13:12] natural respect for high places and
[13:14] falling from high places and I have
[13:17] always struggled with this which was
[13:18] great with working with my dad having to
[13:20] frame room additions and stuff and him
[13:23] being exasperated, yelling at me from
[13:25] the ground. Shoot the nail gun. You can
[13:27] do it. I'm like, I'm scared. Anyways, um
[13:31] uh anyways, thank God for my dad because
[13:32] he helped me learn how to be a man. Um
[13:34] anyways, the the point is I this is not
[13:38] my not my wheelhouse. And I one point
[13:40] went decided to go rock climbing at one
[13:42] of these indoor rock climbing places.
[13:43] And it's a lot of fun. But there comes a
[13:45] point at which they have those machines.
[13:47] I forget what they call it, but it's a
[13:49] it's like a basically a big winch that's
[13:51] auto it's automatic so that if you start
[13:53] falling, it will start applying the
[13:55] brakes the faster you fall so you won't
[13:56] hit the ground, right?
[13:58] And so you hook yourself to it. You have
[14:00] a harness, you hook yourself to it, and
[14:01] then you climb up the wall. And when
[14:02] it's time to get down, you repel off the
[14:04] wall, right? You got to let go of the
[14:06] wall and jump and have faith in this
[14:08] machine that it's not going to let you
[14:09] hit the ground. Well, you can watch
[14:12] somebody do it. You can go, "Yep, I know
[14:14] exactly what it is." You can Google it,
[14:16] find blueprints for the thing, figure
[14:18] out how it all works. But until you hook
[14:19] yourself to it, and climb up to the top,
[14:22] and then look down and go, "Oh, wow.
[14:24] That's a lot farther looking down than
[14:26] it is looking up, right?" And then you
[14:28] have to let go of it and jump.
[14:31] Well, that's the moment of faith,
[14:34] right? That's it's one thing to to see
[14:37] other people do it, but it's another
[14:38] thing when you're the one having to jump
[14:41] and there's always that moment where it
[14:43] doesn't because the brakes don't catch
[14:44] in quite as fast as you think they would
[14:46] and you're in that split second of freef
[14:48] fall and then you panic, you know, and
[14:50] the temptation is to start grabbing for
[14:52] the wall again. Now, if you do that,
[14:54] then you're going to hit the wall and
[14:55] break your arms, right? You will hurt
[14:57] yourself doing that. You have to jump
[14:59] and commit to it and not try to back
[15:01] out, right? You literally have to jump.
[15:04] It will catch you. You just have to do
[15:06] it. And
[15:09] that's the problem. You know, people
[15:11] people will will
[15:14] have this concept of faith. We'll have
[15:16] this understanding, well, we read the,
[15:18] you know, we heard it preached over the
[15:19] pulpit, whatever. But until you're in a
[15:21] situation where you're just out in the
[15:23] middle of it,
[15:24] and you've you don't have another
[15:26] choice, a lot of times we're going to
[15:29] hang on to that wall as long as we
[15:30] possibly can until there ain't no more
[15:33] options. until your arms until you just
[15:35] have to go. And you know, unfortunately,
[15:40] I wish it were human nature that we
[15:41] would be a little bit more courageous.
[15:43] But unfortunately, the Lord often times
[15:46] has to put us in situations. That's why
[15:48] we have trials and tribulations because
[15:51] the Lord is recognizing that we don't
[15:53] want to naturally go put ourselves in
[15:55] situations where we have to use faith
[15:56] because they're scary, right? And so the
[15:59] Lord will give us trials and
[16:00] tribulations. Now, having faith, hearing
[16:03] by the word, what that is is us
[16:07] attaching that to ourselves,
[16:10] right? And it's hard to do that
[16:12] sometimes because we the pe the the
[16:14] preacher will preach, the word will come
[16:16] forth, we read the scripture, we hear a
[16:18] tape, we hear the preacher preach, and
[16:19] we go, "Oh, that applies to my life, but
[16:23] I don't know that I really want to apply
[16:24] it because that's scary."
[16:26] Right?
[16:28] And so, now we're at a decision point.
[16:30] Do you decide to take the word of God or
[16:34] do you decide to just keep hanging on to
[16:37] your own strength?
[16:41] Now, I want to start getting into this
[16:43] bit about faith being a decision. I got
[16:46] several quotes here um that I want to
[16:48] read.
[16:50] Um
[16:52] uh if you want to hear a lot about this,
[16:53] I suggest listen to the sermon called um
[16:56] By Faith Moses. He gets into this a lot
[16:58] actually. He he said um at the beginning
[17:01] of that that sermon he he says um
[17:03] explicitly that's what he's talking
[17:04] about. It's not as necessary the title
[17:06] but that he says as a subject is um I
[17:09] forget exactly the phrase he used but
[17:10] basically faith being a decision or or
[17:12] deciding by faith.
[17:15] Um so this is this is from uh the true
[17:18] vine and a false vine. It says um now uh
[17:21] now to you them spirits are pulling one
[17:23] to another. Now, being that you're
[17:25] closer to me,
[17:27] um, you're closer to me. Uh, I want to
[17:29] talk to you just a minute. Now, it's
[17:32] still moving between the women. He's
[17:33] dealing with two women, and there's a
[17:34] spirit moving between them. Okay?
[17:36] He says, "Now, you have faith, lady,
[17:38] both of you, because you're right now on
[17:41] the decision ground,
[17:43] right? You he So, he's directly
[17:45] attaching faith to a decision. You have
[17:48] to decide. Do I accept the deliverance
[17:50] that's in front of me or do I say,
[17:52] "Well, it's not there's nothing to it."
[17:54] Right? And the their the decision ground
[17:56] is the moment between it's the the
[18:00] moment where you're deciding whether or
[18:01] not you step out and accept something or
[18:03] not.
[18:05] Um this is from by faith Moses. There is
[18:08] no way to ever please God only by faith.
[18:10] The scripture plainly states it that way
[18:13] and it's by faith. And without faith,
[18:15] says the scripture, it is impossible to
[18:17] please God. So if faith disagrees with
[18:20] science and science disagrees with
[18:22] faith, that puts them um at uh at edge
[18:27] at each other, then we must make take a
[18:30] choice as Moses did. By faith, we
[18:33] believe.
[18:35] Okay. Um also same same sermon. um says
[18:39] uh 5 years from today you may be in hell
[18:43] because you made the wrong decision. 5
[18:45] years from today you may be cleaning
[18:47] spatoons in a ballroom. 5 years from
[18:50] today you may be a prostitute on the
[18:51] street. Or you may be a man or a woman
[18:55] that's a credit to any society because
[18:57] of your choice for Christ. Five years
[19:00] from today you may be in glory gone in
[19:03] the rapture because you made your choice
[19:05] today. But you got to choose. And don't
[19:09] look at what you see. Choose what you
[19:12] see by faith. That's the only thing that
[19:15] will count. Um is what you choose by
[19:19] faith.
[19:20] Right? At some point, at some point,
[19:25] we have to come to a place where the
[19:28] evidence of what we see is recognized as
[19:32] contrary to the word of God. And we have
[19:34] to step out and say what is
[19:37] provable by science and provable by
[19:39] evidence and provable by observation is
[19:42] contrary to the word of God and
[19:43] therefore it is a lie.
[19:46] Right? Which is harder to say than do
[19:49] sometimes. Right?
[19:52] Sometimes that's you know because
[19:54] sometimes
[19:56] it's we unfortunately we are trapped in
[19:58] the flesh of the human body that c does
[20:01] not see the faith. We don't see the
[20:03] power of God moving. All we can see is
[20:05] what's in front of us. All we can see,
[20:08] all we know is what we feel. All we know
[20:09] is is our, you know, the the the product
[20:12] of our own senses, right? All we can see
[20:15] is, you know, what a doctor presents us
[20:17] with or or, you know, the the evidence
[20:20] that we see in front of us. And it it's
[20:23] so hard
[20:25] to believe something that you can't see,
[20:28] right?
[20:30] Because I mean, after all, the devil
[20:32] will come to you and say, "Well, I mean,
[20:34] if you can't see it, there's no evidence
[20:35] for it. How do you know that it's not
[20:37] just a lie?"
[20:38] Right? And it feels that way sometimes,
[20:42] you know? Um, I mean, think of it like
[20:44] this is one of my favorite scriptures
[20:46] when it comes to faith is Jonah in the
[20:49] fish's belly at the bottom of the ocean
[20:51] and he turns himself towards the temple
[20:53] and he prays and he calls the situation
[20:56] that he is in lying vanities. Amen.
[20:59] Okay. Now, it takes a certain amount of
[21:03] courage or insanity
[21:06] to be in a belly of a fish
[21:10] and say that it's a lie.
[21:12] Wow.
[21:12] Okay.
[21:13] That it is. And and and not only that,
[21:15] but the you know, in the Old Testament
[21:17] especially, the word vanity is is like
[21:19] it's something worthless. It's something
[21:20] insignificant and inconsequential. It's
[21:23] just it's just nothing. It's just a
[21:24] vanity, right? Not only is it a lie, but
[21:27] it's just it's an insignificant,
[21:28] inconsequential lie, right? It's it's
[21:31] it's just nothing. It is can be easily
[21:34] wiped away. But here's Jonah in the most
[21:37] horrible situation you could probably
[21:39] imagine. You know, I don't know. I mean,
[21:42] I don't know of anybody else who's ever
[21:43] heard of somebody going into the belly
[21:45] of a fish and surviving.
[21:47] But here he is saying, "No, this is all
[21:49] insignificant lies." because he knew
[21:54] that it ran contrary to the word of God.
[21:56] Amen,
[21:56] right? And no matter so,
[21:59] so when we when we come to our
[22:01] situations, you know, that's that's the
[22:03] model, right? That's the model. That's
[22:05] the that's the pattern that we have to
[22:06] follow is no matter what sort of thing
[22:08] comes against you, you have a decision
[22:10] to make. You can lay down and die. You
[22:13] know, Jonah Jonah had a decision to
[22:15] make. He could have said, "Well, I, you
[22:17] know, I contradicted the Lord. I ran
[22:18] away from ran the opposite direction of
[22:20] where I was going and you know now I'm
[22:22] in this fish and I guess this is the
[22:23] judgment of God on my life and here I am
[22:25] to die you know God's killing me by fish
[22:29] and
[22:31] you know that was that was a I mean it's
[22:34] perfectly reasonable to me you know but
[22:38] but no he said no this is I don't care
[22:40] what reasonable is I don't care what's
[22:42] rational I don't care what's logical I
[22:45] only care that the word of God said
[22:47] something different and the word of God
[22:49] is right.
[22:50] Okay. Regardless of my situation, the
[22:53] word of God is correct.
[22:59] Um,
[23:03] let's skip that. Now, I I only got a
[23:05] couple minutes left here and I'm going
[23:06] to finish up with
[23:08] um
[23:11] I want to finish up with this couple
[23:13] more quotes if I can. Um, this is from
[23:15] Jesus Christ, same yesterday, today, and
[23:16] forever.
[23:18] The scripture says, "He's the high
[23:20] priest of our confession now. Not the
[23:23] high priest of your feeling, the high
[23:25] priest of your confession."
[23:28] I'm going to skip a little bit in the in
[23:30] the quote just for time. It says, "Now
[23:32] he's sit sitting at the right hand of
[23:34] God to make intercession upon your
[23:37] confession." Amen.
[23:39] Now, he can't do nothing to you or for
[23:42] you until you accept what he has already
[23:46] done and confess it.
[23:49] I'm not saved tonight because I feel
[23:51] like I'm saved. I'm saved tonight
[23:54] because I met God's requirements in his
[23:57] word. God is under obligation.
[24:00] Take care of me if I meet those
[24:03] requirements. Is that right?
[24:07] Amen.
[24:08] So
[24:10] here uh uh
[24:14] I'm going to read this is again from a
[24:15] message called why says just simple just
[24:19] say thank you father you promised it to
[24:22] me I now receive it that's all watch
[24:25] what happens now mean it in your heart
[24:28] just keep saying it over and over if you
[24:32] don't believe it alto together keep
[24:34] saying it until you do believe it
[24:36] amen
[24:37] just keep saying it over. I thank you,
[24:39] Lord, for my healing.
[24:40] Hallelujah.
[24:41] Cuz um cuz what is he? Christ is the
[24:44] high priest of our confession. Is that
[24:46] right? Hebrews 3. All right. He's the
[24:49] high priest of our confession. Then he
[24:51] cannot do one thing for you. Can make no
[24:54] intercession until first you confess
[24:57] that it's done. Now, is that scriptural?
[25:00] High priest of our confession. Then he
[25:02] can only act when we confess.
[25:06] Okay.
[25:09] How many times I know I felt this way
[25:12] and I'm I bet you you felt this way too
[25:14] where we're not we are in a situation
[25:16] where we need healing. Usually it's
[25:18] healing or in a situation where we need
[25:21] the help of the Lord and we will
[25:24] confess, oh, I'm healed. But it doesn't
[25:26] feel that way. There's a little thing in
[25:28] the back of your head that goes, "Ah, do
[25:30] you really believe it?" Cuz it really
[25:31] feels like you're lying right now.
[25:33] Right? It really feels like it's a lie
[25:35] to say that. to say that you're healed
[25:37] when you're not. You know, you can say,
[25:40] "Oh, I'm healed." You know, when
[25:43] somebody asks you, "How you doing,
[25:44] brother?" You know, "How?" "Oh, I'm
[25:46] healed. Praise the Lord, I'm healed."
[25:48] But then there's that little thing in
[25:49] the back of your mind that says, "No,
[25:51] you're not." And to say that is almost a
[25:53] lie,
[25:54] but it's not a lie,
[25:56] right? The word of God is the truth,
[25:58] right? Your feelings are the lie. Right?
[26:01] The heart is desperately wicked. It is
[26:04] deceitful.
[26:06] what your feelings are are most of the
[26:08] time, especially when it comes to the
[26:10] word of God, a lie. They are a scam.
[26:13] They are a fraud. They will deceive you
[26:15] and lead you down the wrong road. Okay?
[26:17] You do not go based off what you feel in
[26:20] your heart. You not go based on what you
[26:21] feel in your emotions. You do not go
[26:23] based off of your experiences and your
[26:25] memories. Okay? These are all aspects of
[26:28] your five spiritual senses and they will
[26:30] they are not what you go off of, right?
[26:33] you don't go based off of anything other
[26:35] than I'm healed. I don't care what the
[26:37] doctor said. I don't care. I don't care
[26:39] that my situation, my symptoms in my
[26:42] body run directly contrary to the word
[26:44] of God. I claim it and say, "I am
[26:47] healed." And even if you don't believe
[26:48] it, you keep saying it over and over
[26:50] again until you do.
[26:53] Okay? We can prove this scientifically.
[26:55] By the way, what you say out of your
[26:57] mouth changes what you believe.
[26:59] Okay? People have this idea. We can
[27:02] again Science has proven this. If you um
[27:06] by the way, if you want to know what
[27:07] science proved this, it was Chinese
[27:09] brainwashing of Korean P or um PS during
[27:12] the Korean War. This is what they did to
[27:13] brainwash soldiers to turn against their
[27:15] home country.
[27:17] They made them write something that was
[27:21] critical of their home country every
[27:23] single day.
[27:24] They made them confess something
[27:26] critical and by the end of it, they were
[27:28] full-blown Chinese communists.
[27:29] Amen. Okay, just say doesn't have to be
[27:32] anything crazy. Just a little critique.
[27:34] You don't just say, "Oh, your home
[27:35] country's awful." Just a little
[27:37] criticism.
[27:38] Wow.
[27:38] You know, and over time that little
[27:40] criticism gets more and more and more
[27:42] because you they force you to dwell on
[27:43] it until eventually you're completely
[27:45] turned complete traitor,
[27:48] right? Well, the same thing works for
[27:50] Christ. Okay? It's the same thing.
[27:52] Brother Brandham said, "The right mental
[27:54] attitude towards any promise of God will
[27:56] bring it to pass."
[27:57] Mental attitude.
[27:59] Yeah.
[28:00] what you think.
[28:02] Okay? What you say, the approach that
[28:04] you have towards it. What you say
[28:07] changes what you think.
[28:09] It it people have this idea, oh, what I
[28:11] think is expressed in my words. To some
[28:13] extent, that's true. But it goes the
[28:14] other way, too.
[28:16] Okay? It's it's a two-way street. And
[28:18] what you say will change what you
[28:20] believe. It will change what you think.
[28:22] So when the prophet says, even if you
[28:24] don't necessarily believe it and you
[28:26] know you don't believe it and there's a
[28:27] little thing in your in your head saying
[28:28] it's a lie, you say it anyways because
[28:31] eventually it won't be a lie,
[28:33] right? Eventually you will silence that
[28:35] voice.
[28:37] Amen.
[28:38] And I am out of time. Let's stand and
[28:41] pray.
[28:47] Father, thank you for this this morning.
[28:49] Thank you for this message you've given
[28:51] us. Pray Lord that it would the people
[28:54] would be able to attach their their
[28:55] faith to it, Lord, be able to grab hold
[28:57] of it and today they would may be able
[28:58] to make a choice that that they would
[29:00] choose you, Father, they would choose
[29:02] your word that maybe this would be a
[29:04] word that they would help stick in their
[29:05] mind that as they would go through their
[29:07] days, weeks, and months that they could
[29:10] when they would encounter something,
[29:11] Father, that is outside of their control
[29:13] and they they would need you, Father.
[29:15] that we know that Lord that it is not
[29:16] that you help those who help themselves
[29:18] but father you help those who cannot
[29:20] help themselves
[29:22] and father that that Lord that you when
[29:25] we find ourselves in places where we
[29:28] cannot help ourselves we cannot help
[29:30] ourselves to to be healed we cannot help
[29:32] ourselves but to o to to to in order to
[29:35] overcome but father that you can you can
[29:37] help us so father we will have faith we
[29:40] will claim to be overcomers we will
[29:41] claim to be to be uh healed healed,
[29:45] Father, even when it doesn't feel that
[29:46] way. That Father, these few words that I
[29:48] might have said that through through
[29:51] you, Father, they might stick in the
[29:53] hearts of the people and that maybe,
[29:54] Lord, that they would have some courage
[29:56] going forward. And we ask these things
[29:58] in your precious name of Jesus Christ.
[29:59] Amen.
