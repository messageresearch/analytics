here if you could turn the these up monitor stage monitors down matthew that'd be good just a little bit matthew chapter 16. you love him amen he certainly amen good to us and his presence we can feel i'm glad i can feel glad i can understand the word god gave me a mind i could understand it but i'm really glad i could also not just understand it i can feel it i mean there's something so important about being able to sense the presence of the lord to say lord i've got something inside of me that connects amen when we get around believers and we start to worship amen there's a true there's really a connection that we have amen let's just uh we're going to turn to matthew 16 before we do amen and just to have a couple announcements i want to read i would like to first say my nephew is here i think he's here in the building dawson so glad he's here amen we're uh certainly love him very much and proud of him glad he came for gideon's graduation so uh certainly glad to have him here from tucson a little bit more humid here dawson but uh we got good weather i promise you just came at the wrong time [Laughter] i'd like to just make an announcement about the concessions that we talked about on wednesday the youth conceptions concessions are open starting today we ask that the children 10 and under be accompanied by an adult when purchasing items this is sort of one of the perils of what we're doing and we experienced this deer in co-op when back in the years and the days when we used to do concessions just make sure your children are any 10 and under accompanied by an adult when purchasing items so that no money goes missing or no no snacks go missing unpaid for the first refrigerator next to the counter uh where the concessions are so if you come in this door here to the first refrigerator on their left right to the right of the concessions the first refrigerator next to the counter where the concessions are has been set aside for drinks coffee etc that the youth are selling the middle fridge has now been converted to a freezer where the ice cream and popsicles that they are selling are the refrigerator closest to the bookshelf is for multi-purpose use for the church and congregation so the first two refrigerators are just for concessions so if you go in there and you grab something make sure you pay for what you take um or we'll we'll stick brother luther on you and i promise you don't want that the refrigerator closest to the bookshelf is for bookshelf is for multi-purpose as we mentioned on wednesday payment is on the honor system and there will be there will not be someone there watching at all times please discuss this with your younger children and make sure they know that everything on the counter and in the fridge and freezer is for sale not for free as mentioned on wednesday night this is a way for us to raise money for the youth fund 100 of every profit will go directly to that fund i mean i can just tell you that's a a fund that us we've we've already we're already a couple thousand dollars in the negative from just um uh the meeting that we just had so we've drained everything that we had and we're about a little over two thousand dollars short of what we had but i'm grateful for the word that was sewn into our kids hearts uh over the weekend last weekend and it's certainly value you couldn't put a price on it couldn't put a price tag on that but we would just like to say it's we have more things that we'd like to do we're wanting to take them to the believer's youth camp there in uh indiana and so that's a great expense we're trying to fund and so if the lord put something on your heart i know god will bless you for also we'll be having a church-wide memorial day dinner next sunday there will be an announcement sent out on the whatsapp later today discussing the details so watch for that it'll be a memorial day dinner next sunday we love the lord we want to remember our pastor who's my dad who's away ministering for brother dale uh in flagstaff and all those maybe that aren't present here today traveling some i know and vacation but we just we're glad that we're here amen glad that the lord jesus is here i've never had the devil fight me more to preach a sermon than what i'm going to preach today and so i just knew at the moment there even in the back i just stopped what i was doing and this god talked to the lord and said lord i know that you're in complete control and so we're going to get a little take a step i don't know how far we'll get but we just got a lot on our plate we'd like to get to let's begin reading here in matthew chapter 16 i'd like to minister and title this the order the order of the anointing and you'll see why here in a moment the order of the anointing the pharisees verse 1 the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven isn't it amazing how people always need a physical proof in order to accept something well that's how we are whether we like to admit it or not he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky does right skies right and lower and all you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but can you not discern the signs of the times now notice this is prophetic what jesus is going to speak here in verse 4 wasn't just speaking to the generation that he was there with but it would be a prophecy because this is speaking of the evening time that's what jesus said in the evening time and you see the sun is lowering so this is a prophecy that would come to pass in its perfection or for perfect fulfillment in the day and age you and i live in verse four a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign so one of the signs of the end time wicked and adulterous generation is that they would be sign seekers they would look for some proof or something and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed what's amazing is that what they didn't realize is that the sign was standing in front of them amen and they missed it entirely matthew chapter uh 26 let's just turn there quickly matthew chapter 26. let's just read it verse 30. and when they had sung in him they went out into the mount of olives then said jesus unto them and you shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended jesus said unto them unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all of the disciples lord we're so grateful that you're here so grateful lord that you've called us lord i'm so now just aware of my own incapability lord insufficiency lord i stand here in great need as all of these that are here praying bow on their heads stand i'm just right with them lord in great need of you to come and speak lord i don't come today with wisdom lord that surpasses or would be great or give some great understanding lord but i just come in humility before you asking you god that you would come as the divine revealer of your word and may you speak to your children lord all those that have came with a need and an expectation i pray lord you'd meet them at the faith that they have this morning may you bless us lord bless our pastor away ministering in flagstaff lord just in a little while pray god you would anoint him anoint your servants all around the world we ask it in jesus christ's name and the church said amen amen you can be seated amen brothers if you have that power point you can just have that displayed and ready just for me if you could it's amazing what you find here when peter speaks these words and you're going to see this in luke chapter 22 if you turn in your bible we'll just read just a portion of scripture from there and i want you to notice what jesus says here and speaking and speaking to his disciples here in matthew luke chapter 22 let's just begin reading at verse 48 but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with the kiss when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him lord shall we smite thee shall we smite with the sword and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear and jesus answered and said suffer you thus far and he touched his ear and healed him then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temples and the elders which were come to him but you come out as against a thief with swords and staves when i was daily with you in the temple you stretch forth no hands against me but this hour and the power of darkness then they took him and led him and brought him into the high priest house and peter followed afar off and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together peter sat down among them but a certain maid beheld him as they sat as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked on him and said this man was also with him and he denied him saying woman i know him not now it's incredible what happened to the faith that peter had that we just read about when peter's saying lord i'll never be offended in you lord i'll i'll never deny you it was it was it sounded very reasonable sounded like peter was really zealous for what he believed what happens to the faith that peter has when he's saying lord i'll never be offended in you i'll never though though i'd lord i'll die with you before i before i i ever deny you what happens to that faith is when faith when when that type of faith that peter has is put under pressure ah it changes very quickly because now you take the same man who is saying lord i'll never deny you uh uh though i die with you and it sounds zealous and it sounds real but the problem is is that peter only had an intellectual level of faith or believing and he didn't really have a true revelation at this point now it's important that you have an intellectual understanding of who jesus is it's important and it really it starts there i almost titled this sermon from your head to your heart because it has the start in your mind you've got it has to everything with the lord always starts in the flesh i started this sermon in the flesh i'm preaching to you now what we believe in by by faith and by prayers that we all came in here this morning in the flesh all of us begin to worship brother tony does what he does the music does what they do you do what you do and we start in the flesh but but what we're doing is we're pressing to say lord we're doing all this in the mechanics so that you can come down with an anointing and send the dynamics and take us out of the flesh and into the spirit so everything as as i said starts in the flesh it's always got to start from somewhere and i just feel pulled just pulled in many directions and so i just want to maybe just not not not glaze right over this but i i want to make sure that i i don't miss what the lord wants to say uh how can it as we said here when you preach when you open your bible when you start speaking you're you're in the flesh you're in a very intellectual natural realm when you begin to praise and you begin to worship and you begin to sing you start in the flesh you start in the human mind you start in the intellect but it shouldn't stay there the spirit should come in and take over oh i say god if you could do anything come and take over this service right now come and take over what i start in the flesh and let your spirit come and take control you start to witness to somebody and you start to share the the the the message of the hour with them or start just to start with something small to somebody you just a lot of times don't have some lightning strike lightning bolt anointing that comes to you and gives you a word and you just feel you know charged and you sort of feel like you're super spiritual and you just begin to speak and you begin to tell them about the message no that really friends if we'd be honest that never really happens but it starts very much in the flesh but jesus said take no thought for what you'll say at that moment because the spirit comes and takes over our words and what we can do in the flesh god can bring glory by taking control in the spirit so you must the bible says you must call upon the name of the lord to be saved what does that mean it starts in the flesh we're gonna just if you could put the powerpoint up i'm just gonna read this so you know where my title comes from and then we'll come back to this i want you to notice here what brother branham says uh i've titled this the order of the anointing if you just go to the first slide he says see how the holy spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside spirit can be anointed with the holy ghost and the soul as dark as pitch the cockle barrel grows on the same water that builds puts life into the wheat puts life into the cockleburn but at the bottom of the cuckoo bird here's the difference it's a cockabur life so the same water or the same anointing that anoints the wheat also anoints the tear right this is going to be very elementary but it's also going to just be very foundational to what we have to say so the same water that anoints the tear also anoints the wheat brother branham says it's got to be in the order of the anointing how can the holy spirit anoint to man it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside spirit can be anointed with the holy ghost and the soul is darkest pitch the cockapoo grows on the same water that builds that puts life into the wheat puts life into the cockapoo but at the bottom of the cockapoo it's a cockapoo life it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of it is cockleburn wow now you say brother matt how can you tell the difference brother baron i'm even in there and and uh forget what what the the name of the city who was therein and he's he's there preaching or they're watching at a revival meeting and he tells the story of the man who comes up to him and shakes his hand and he says this man just spoke in tongues he said aw i was just admiring the way that the spirit of the lord used him and he says just at that moment he goes outside and he shakes his hand and the lord he falls into discernment and sees that this man is living with another woman that's not his wife and the prophet of god says i don't understand what's i just watched this man speak in tongues be yielded unto the holy spirit and watched a real gift operate in his life but he's living with another woman brother branham gets troubled goes to his caving greens meal and he's there praying asking god about this and the lord gives him the scripture in hebrews 6 for the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same water the same anointing it's all the order of anointing it can anoint your flesh and you be in the spirit and you shout you speak in tongues you raise your hands you get excited you get emotional and brother brandon makes a statement he says and you can cry real tears and it not be the holy spirit at all [Music] it's all the order of the anointing it's a cocklebur that's trying to do god of service without his will if you go to the next slide here um on he says see false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be anointed with the holy ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can amen but by the word here that's what it does see what i mean brother man says so false teachers can rise there can come a true anointing that starts on the flesh what did peter have that wasn't sufficient to withstand the pressure because whatever happens from from the book of matthew then we read over in the book of luke and peter's saying in matthew lord i'll never deny you i'll go all the way to the death i i'll stand with you you know i'll i'll oh i'll i'll die with you lord i'll never be offended in you i'll never deny you and now here he stands and we're reading it and the bible says a woman says if you could turn there in your bible he says that he denied him verse 57 of luke 22 saying woman i know him not and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not what happened amen anointed in the flesh but never changed in the soul are you with me here this morning anointed in the flesh but never changed in the soul turn to the book of james you know the scripture very well thou believest i want you to look here in james chapter 2 verse 19 very familiar james chapter 2 verse 19 keep your bible just handy this morning we're going to use it a lot and i want them to be able to keep the slides on without having to go back and forth james chapter 2 verse 19 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe amen and tremble now this word is pisturio in the greek and i didn't have time to put it on the slide but i'm just going to read you this meaning when he says thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble the devils believe the message as much as you are more than you believe it here today there's a lot of people that have disbelieved the message and left the message i can promise you there's not been one devil that has denied the message not one not one has walked away from it not one has caught him a liar or a or a dishonest person i promise you not one of them it's incredible you go back and ask you go back and ask the cancer demon what you think of william branham you get a very different website than the websites who talk about william branham today go ask a demon of tuberculosis about what they think of william branham it's it'd be like sort of like if there was no record of any of mike tyson's fights and all we ever had today was just the stories of mike tyson it'd be one thing for me to get up here and tell you you know mike was really nothing i could i honestly i could have took mike mike was really nothing you know they talk about his punch in his right hand and the left hook but you know his jab it really wasn't that good guys i mean i'm telling you if there was no proof if we didn't have videos of what to watch a mike tyson fight but i promise you if you take one of those men that he ko'd and you put him here behind this pulpit and say hey was mike tyson all that i promised you you'd get a different story amen amen so he says thou believers that there is one god you do well the devil's also pisturio this is what it means to have faith the devils have faith oh yeah amen you see there's a difference between a faith which is a revelation and a faith which is an intellectual starting in the flesh had knowledge and you say but matter we're preaching against intellect no i'm not here today i'm telling you you've got to have an intellectual experience you've got to have something that starts in your mind that's right but it can't stay there or else you'll end up just like peter i'll never deny you lord i'll never walk away from you and then let the flames get higher and the heat start rising and that that intellectual faith will never hold you i'm afraid that's what's happened to many people who's left the truth they only ever had a peter intellectual faith where they believed but it never went from their head down into their heart to their soul you say brother matt why is that important because it's so important that we raise our children it's important to teach them the truth it's important that they believe the message it's important that they believe who god has sent i believe who god has sinned you know brother branham says you know the true evidence of the holy ghost is accepting uh the truth for your for your age i 100 believe that but i'm going to tell you what that is more of just because you accept the truth of your age does not mean you're born of the spirit of god [Music] amen i can tell you what it is it's a direct evidence that you've never been born again if you don't accept the truth for your age [Applause] it's a direct evidence you don't but if a person you telling me the people who've walked away from the message didn't believe telling me the devils didn't believe but james tells us that they did believe in so much that they trembled so it's got to move from an intellectual conception or a mental a mental ascent or agreement with the word and it's got to drop from your head down into your heart and a true revelation brother branham says faith is a true revelation from god faith is not something that you work up faith is not such what people talk about blind faith you know faith is not blind faith you don't just say well you know i i don't know i'm just gonna try this i'm just gonna guess at it and i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna take a chance at this that's not true faith true faith is a revelation it's something that's revealed to you and jesus said the gates of hell can't take it away from you hello they believe to have faith this is what it means here pisturio and the greek thou believeth there is one god thou do well the devils also have faith to give credit to give respect to a person or a thing to entrust people say that all the time i've trusted the lord well it's a good thing that you've trusted the lord but has the author of the book not just the book been made known unto you amen there's a very big difference as brother branham said to know his word and to know him to know him as life can you say amen it means to have faith by implication to entrust to believe to put trust with to have faith in so peter believed so much until the pressure came and he denied that he knew him let's look a little bit further here it's amazing when i read this in matthew 26 and i just hear the words in math in luke 22 when i just hear the words in matthew 16 and peter's vehemently saying i'll never deny you lord i'll stand with you verse 57 and he denied him saying woman i know him not and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not and about the space of one hour this is verse 59 after another most people don't have their bibles so put that up for me if you could brother caleb and that's that's that's that's fine i just want to make sure we read this luke 22 we're going to wait and have this on the screen i just feel impressed by the holy spirit so that you read this lemon is going to back up as he's finding in luke chapter 22 and he denied him verse 57 saying woman i know him not luke 22 brother caleb verse 57 verse 58 and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also then peter said man i am not about the space verse 59 of one hour after another confidently affirmed sin of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilean and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the crew and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice and peter went out and wept bitterly amen so something happens with an anointing that comes upon peter and he's so anointed with the power of god that he could say i'll never deny you lord i'll never walk away from you i'll go all the way to death i'll i'll go to the grave for you but when it really came the testing time his faith didn't hold him demas was the same exact way who walked with paul we can give example after example demas was the same exact way who had walked with paul in his entire ministry had watched the miracles had sat in the revivals had sat in the meetings but brother adam says but there was something he says demas wasn't a hypocrite that's what the prophet of god said he said he said but something in him looked at paul's ministry and said you know paul's just washed up it's easy to accept the word when the rest of the world is accepting the word it's very easy to accept paul when he's renowned jesus when he's multitudes are following him and man his ministry is just growing and we're on the front row man i just i'm right here with this i stand with this i'm identified with it i believe it yeah everyone else does too amen amen but watch what happens when that word becomes not so popular and jesus says unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no part with him and many of them said this is a hard saying who can bear this and the bible says many of them that had walked with him walk no no more amen and then jesus says will you go also everyone else is leaving the entire church could you imagine you say brother man i've heard this a million times well let me just let me just bring it let me just bring it in the way maybe that you've never thought of could you imagine if we if we preach something here today you were in a church here this morning and everyone in this entire building and church left everyone walked away it's one thing for one family here and one family there but the entire church let's make it larger the entire you're in a church with 500 people and 488 of them get up and walk out amen and then jesus as the door closes looks at you and says what are you doing here won't you go also won't you leave also where else would we go lord [Applause] [Music] where else could we go hallelujah it's incredible how faith intellect works and i'm going to get to this if you have the powerpoint you can go just a little bit further uh oh and just display the next the the next slide there he says as i've often said i found two classes of people one of them is the fundamental let's go beyond this and go all the way to the very first uh just go to the very keep going past that that slide there i just want to get to something i'm not going to nearly be able to cover all of this one more keep going keep going one more keep going keep going keep going rationalism there we go jesus is asked this question even by pontius pilate and he's he's asked the question what is truth it's incredible because truth you could say is the absolute standard by which everything in reality is measured truth in the view of any subject no matter what subject you want to debate or speak about here today uh any situation any question or idea and so they that we define this as the truth to matter and pila asked this question and said what is what is truth now the quest the wrong question was asked wasn't what is truth the right question is who is truth because truth is not an idea or something scholarly that you figure out truth is a person that's revealed to you and so truth is the absolute standard but truth is not what a scholar it's not what a theologian it's not what a preacher it's not what anyone it's not what i say to you here today is not what truth is truth is truth amen and the message let me just bring it a little bit further the message is not the message of the hour is not what i not what you not what any other person makes it or preaches it as dogmatic as they can sound and they are the end-all uh to end-all discussions i'm preaching the truth and it's the end-all my interpretation of what brother branham says is the end-all solution it's the it's the it's the finality doesn't matter if a man says that that doesn't make it true let me say it this way the truth speaks for itself [Music] and it doesn't need a preacher an interpreter to tell you what it means it speaks for itself can you say amen and so the message is not what i'm making it's not what any man makes it the message is what it is it's not the message of brother branham either you see him was it the message of william branham that's why a lot of people have have a misunderstanding the message of the hour was not the message of william branham he was the messenger that brought the message from jesus christ as the book of revelations was not the book that john wrote john was not the author john was just the scribe the author who wrote the book was jesus himself and the prophet of god was not the author of the message he was just the mailman the messenger who was vindicated not so that you'd have faith in a man but that you'd have faith that that message that man brought was from the throne of god [Music] and so the message brother branham he was not let me just say it this way brother branham was not who i say he was it's not who you say he was it's not what any man says he was he was who the word said he was yes amen that's good hallelujah what is truth it's the word which is the thought of god expressed it's communicated not by human not by a human dialect or a human language because a human cannot with his own words let me be careful how i say this i could try to get you to understand it i could teach it to you you could intellectually understand it you could intellectually ah ha now i understand i get it two plus two equals four and a lot of people have that kind of understanding of the message of what happened in the in the garden of eden that it was sex and it wasn't an apple it was adultery it wasn't a uh some fruit that we can understand that intellectually but i can't reveal to you the true revelation of the message only god himself can do that that's why the prophet of god says above everything else you should pray for true revelation in your life for with true revelation the gates of hell cannot prevail against it amen and so what is the word it's the thought of god expressed god is a god of truth the bible says the spirit of god is the spirit of truth jesus says i am the way i am the truth i am the life so god only functions in the realm of truth whereas evil the evil one our enemy the bible calls him the father of lies he's the father of distortions and brother branham says what satan's job is is to take the pure truth and distort it or deform it he won't come right out and have you deny it he'll give you a distorted view of something amen so the spiritual battle that we're in is a battle between lies and truth many times in our spiritual war we get everybody else's view of a matter including their own and our own opinion and we may even have all of the facts but you can have the fact of the gospel and not have the gospel you could have the truth of the revelation and not have the revelation that's a direct quote from god's prophet he says you can take the truth of the revelation and miss the revelation entirely so it's not a human understanding it's not something that we learn or that we're tall right or that we read in the book say brother matt are those things wrong know those that's where it always starts but i don't just want to start i want to finish and so it's amazing because you can have all the information but miss the truth you could have all of the emotions feelings or sensations but not have the truth oh i thought it was in if i felt him no it's not just in filling him all right amen i'm sorry to have you do acrobatics brother caleb but go back to the quotes i just want to go back to what you had on the third slide i think it was brother caleb this powerpoint you just had you can have all of the emotions go to the next ones here listen what brother brandon says i've often said i found two classes of people one of them is the fundamental positionally he knows where he is in christ because of the word but he doesn't have any faith in what he is doing he hasn't received the holy spirit then i find the pentecostals many of them has received the holy ghost but don't know who they are just like a man who's got money in the bank and can't write a check and the other one can write a check and got no money in the bank [Applause] go to the next try new god of service the next slide there just keep advancing he says if you could get those two together if you could get the pentecostal to realize who he is and come back to the real full word of god with the baptism of the holy ghost it'll set the world of fire again with a new pentecostal revival brother sister that's true listen he says that's the way it is tonight this is then jesus came people would rather stay in an old stale formal ungodly and different condition than to put up with a little wildfire now and then i'd rather have it a thousand to one [Music] brother bannon says i'd rather have a little bit of wildfire than no fire a thousand to one amen they feel better at home with the devils and their old condition drinking smoking gambling wearing old dirty clothes bobbing off their hair and doing all this other stuff that they do feel more at home doing that than you would than you do to be cold old-fashioned and have jesus around the house i'll take him a hundred billion times to one amen advance that slide for me brother caleb he says and that's the way it is he says when a man is converted did you go too far go back one i don't have it here i wish that i did go back one slide one slide yeah okay go to the next one that's good when a man is converted his eyes are set towards calvary this is surge we would see jesus he says when a man is converted his eyes are set towards calvary if he's just a little bit nervous if you don't watch him he will go over to the fanatic side if he's just a little scholarly he'll go over to the starchy side but right in the middle of the road is the same sensible born-again spirit-led endowed church of the living god going straight down the road to christ that's the real coming from both sides one went one way and one with the other shows fanaticism or either scholarly and too stiff to bow so either you got this ditch or you got this ditch and brother branham says i always stood in the middle of the two when he speaks of armenianism and calvinism and preaches how the calvinism has just been so predestinated they can't well if god wants to send a revival then he'll send it there's nothing we can do to cause it there's nothing we can do to ask for it you ought not even ask everything's just predestinated all ready to happen is what's going to happen we don't need to do anything we just sit here starchy cold formal and just repeat the word of god and if god wants to send a revival he'll send the holy ghost revival brother adam says now some of that is true he says but it goes off too far to seed on one side and then they go in the ditch and he says then you get the fanatics over here that believe unless you shout or speak in tongues you haven't even had a revival right and it's a ditch on this side brother madam says they go to the fanatic side and he says shows fanaticism are either scholarly to sift about next slide and he says they know more about the word then they know about the author to know the words not life but to know him to know him you don't have to be a scholar i'm so glad i don't have to be a scholar you have to be a submitted person you have to be a submitted person don't get so shy don't get so excited when he says you don't have to be a scholar i don't have to do anything i don't have to know anything i'm just in it i felt i felt something brother adam says it's not an emotion it's not because you spoke in tongues it's not because you shouted that may be all right but because you're a submitted person i love that amen and when you submit yourself to christ christ is obligated to feel that vacancy that you've poured out on the altar to him he's obligated to his word to do it he will not fail you amen not because you had an understanding of something you so rationalized it and you got the perfect seals over here in the trumpets and the vials and you've got it all on a chalkboard and you understand all the mysteries and you're under paul said though i know all the mysteries but you can still miss something and it's not because you were on this ditch and you shouted and you spoke in tongues or you you got some emotional experience that's good both are good but in the middle of the road is truth go to the next line and he says the methodists said when we shouted we had it but they didn't the nazarene said when they lived holy they had it but they didn't amen the pentecostal said we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't so wait a minute what is left brother branham what is left when we shouted we had it no we didn't have it no you didn't have it when you shouted okay then it must be when i live holy enough no no you didn't have it you didn't necessarily have you may you may shout you may live holy yeah but that don't mean you got it amen and he says the pentecostal says we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't see next slide god unfolded himself not in sensations right amen not in sensations not in sensations you know the quote very well brother branham says the one of the mysteries that was revealed by the baptism of the holy ghost he says was the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation now one ditch will take that so far and say see there to be born again i don't have to have any sensations whatsoever and i can receive the holy ghost and never even know it just sit in the church long enough like being in a car if i sit in a garage long enough i'll eventually be a car it's not by osmosis osmosis is just if you sit in an atmosphere long enough you'll just suddenly magically if i just go to church and i pay my tithes and i'm holy i follow all the rules and do everything that the message tells me to do and i check off that and check off that and check off that and check off that you know what your resume your resume is as good as your resume matches the devils you feel good could i imagine i heard her brother say just just the other day so you imagine he said a lot of these he says you take all the all the check marks of the devil you believe malachi 4 ah i do believe it with all my heart check you believe god sent a prophet check i believe it with all my heart you believe luke 17 30 was malachi 4 was the prophet of god was william branham i believe it with all of my heart but you believe that the original sin was adultery and it wasn't an apple i believe it with all of my heart i accept it 100 you don't believe in a trinity absolutely not you believe in one god absolutely not you know the brother said many people would take that man and elect him as their pastor and i've just read you the qualifications of lucifer yeah wow i believe it wow peter said i believe it i'll stand with it it's one thing to have a confession from your mouth and have a life that's submitted to the word there's a very big difference in saying you believe something and watching your life submit itself to what you say you believe now that's what the prophet of god taught us it's not in emotions it's not in head knowledge or intellect it's in a submitted life that you submit yourself to the word of god you say brother brother matt what does that mean it means i've submitted myself i've became subservient to the word that's been revealed amen that means all of my ideas i've throughout the window all of my opinions i've thrown out the window all of what i think i've thrown out the window and i've submitted myself to him who god has sent [Music] hello it's very different when you say you believe the message of the hour that god sent through william branham and when you actually submit yourself to that message that was sent yeah amen you see the devil can believe but he can't submit himself to the word the devil can say i accept that god sent a prophet but he will never submit himself or surrender himself to what that message brought and many people are willing to say they accept a creed or a dogma or an idea or a theology or a doctrine and i'm so afraid we teach our children the truth and it's good to teach them the truth oh my brother and my sister but i want to make sure that that truth becomes a revelation and if anything i could pray for my children and say lord don't let me just teach them a dress code because they'll go out into the world and find a dress code they like a lot better don't let me just teach them a lifestyle listen the message is not a lifestyle the message is not just a doctrine of books and tapes and ideas and theology and doctrines it's a person that's personally revealed to you and when god reveals himself to you nobody can take that away i say god give us a group of people that are have a revelation of who they are who god is who the word is and they've submitted their ideas to that voice that's why you look at the picture of the the the the cloud that appears over flagstaff what was that it was a headship it was a headship that came down to the body do you realize what that was it was christ in his dissension you see everybody look for brother branham on his last revival that his last pool would be some great other healing campaign or it'd be some sensation or it'd speak uh you know more squirrels into existence or he'd speak body change everyone looked for some sensation or emotional experience but the the next phase of the prophet's ministry was not an emotional experience or a healing revival but he said i was in sabino canyon and he says i stretched out my hand and a sword struck my hand and he says i looked up and he says this is not just a sword it's the sword it's the word of the lord the vindication of your ministry what was it it was christ vindicating himself with his prophet have we submitted ourself not to a man but have we submitted ourselves to christ it's one thing to say that we believe it it's another entirely different thing to submit yourself to it amen and say lord i check all my ideas and all of my opinions and all of my theories of what i think and i surrender to what your word has said through a vindicated prophet what was that it was we we'll get to it maybe just a little bit later don't want to get sidetracked he says god unfolded himself not in sensations no yet sensations yet is with it amen even the quote where brother branham says that the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation you read the rest of that quote and he says and the works of christ it's the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation yet the works and the works that he did of christ living through you the manifestation of christ oh my brother and my sister you may not speak in tongues you may not jump up and down you may not shout but the manifestation of christ better be manifesting and expressing himself through your life sensations yet is with it i love how brother branham says this you see the place i wish i wish people could see the place brother branham places this not in the left ditch not in the right ditch but right down the middle it gets so humble till anybody can see it if you don't try to put or inject your own mind to it see and your own thoughts it's god next slide now and then they become a bunch of fanatics then there's real cold formals on this side here's the fanatics on the other side here's the cold formals on this side it's the word and the word only and we just have the word and that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away with brother madam we don't need no more manifestation of the spirit we don't need no more gifts of the spirit we don't need to we don't need tongues anymore paul said i would that all of you spoke in tongues did you know that the gift of speaking in tongues is the only thing that you're allowed to covet in the bible go read your bible that's what it says it's the only thing god tells us to covet is the gift of speaking in tongues i told my brother just the uh last week i said you know i remember years later after i was born of the spirit of god and came back from a missions trip in my in in my mother-in-law's house actually in tucson and i remember coming back from that trip there and just was there home alone for three or four hours and just praying and just asking god not desiring to speak in tongues at all not desiring any kind of outward manifestation but just was on my knees and talking to god about something i'd been praying about all through the meetings and all through the week and i just said lord i just need an answer from you right now i'll never forget i grabbed that leather the back of that leather chair and it was it was like grabbing the horns of the altar for me and i grabbed i remember i probably damaged the chair when i did it but i just grabbed that leather so hard and for some reason i said lord this is you and i've got a hold of you and i'm not letting you go until you come and change me right now until you come and reveal yourself right now friends no more than i had spoke those words and all i can tell you is that a fountain from heaven almost like someone took a bucket of water and just dumped it and it went down in my head and it came out of my mouth and when i came to my you you he could do anything you didn't try to separate us brother and says here's the ride it god vindicated it as he goes along you say brother matt do we needly do do we need a pentecostal experience you ought to have one brother branham told that to the branham tabernacle in 1964 i would that you all had a pentecostal experience but you're too ashamed of it you say brother matt what does that mean means we draw from both sides amen he says he says that and here goes along he says god vindicated as he goes along go to the next line if you could here we come back if you could rationalism so it's amazing in reality our scope of knowledge is very limited no matter how much you knowledge you acquire by school or by college or by degree really your knowledge is just a drop in a bucket all of the knowledge you could ever acquire you may be a a a a a an expert an expert on one subject and have the expert knowledge and be you could even be called an expert witness to where you are you are you are you have a degree it's something you've studied but really if you take all of man's knowledge and everything he can acquire by learning it's just a drop in a bucket [Music] and if all we see is what we see we don't really see all there is to see if all you see is what you see yeah can i say it that way then we really don't see all there is to be seen amen since not everything that you see is all there is but there's an entire other dimension amen an invisible battle taking place an invisible war brother branham called it the greatest battle that was ever fought it's happening in the mind and you get truth listen to me i want to say this today i want the truth i want the whole truth and nothing but the truth and i don't just want knowledge i want the person of the truth i want him to sow and so fill me with his life to where i could say like jesus said i and my father are one hallelujah amen no sign listen to this gee pila asks this it's amazing because intellectual faith even pontus pilate it's incredible because for hundreds of years hundreds of years if you looked up brother google he would tell you pontius pilate never even existed if we had google back in the 20s and 30s and 40s you know there's no proof there's everyone wants a sign jesus said they seek a sign you know there was no proof that pontus pilate ever lived ever that he wasn't ever even a man now if you want to go with intellectual faith this is as far as it can take you well i didn't find any evidence of it i can't find any evidence and we do our research which for today that means www.google.com there's no evidence of pilate he never even lived and you know people's faith becomes so shaken by that they they they have no evidence you know what happened though in 1962 in an archaeologist's site they find a they find an inscription of pontus amen and then what happens to all those people whose faith was shaken because there was no physical proof of pontus pilate let me just tell you i didn't need an inscription to believe that pilate ever lived i didn't need an archaeologist to discover or to tell me to wear go oh now i can believe that pilate lived but there was a revelation of who he was there was a revelation of the person of christ and i don't need a physical proof i didn't need an archaeologist to discover it because my faith is not rested in an intellectual realm [Applause] amen hello it's a question that he asks what is truth you know this is actually something philosophers have asked for years you go and study a little bit of philosophy and i don't recommend that you do but if you do for centuries they've asked this question what is truth it's the same thing men are asking today what is real am i real is this real or do i just think uh or am i do i just think i'm here am i really here what is truth what is real truth what is the meaning of life what is the real true purpose of life you know that's the question we have to ask about everything and it's the question about religion today what's true and what's false one religion claims there's three gods one religion claims that there's only one god and there's another religion that claims there's 30 million gods go go study the hindu faith 30 million gods and we're fighting over three or one and then you have another entire philosophy that claims i actually there's not one there's not three there's not a million there's not 30 million there's no god there's none there's no god whatsoever no gods at all so let me say this the real question is not what we believe but is what we believe true and it doesn't matter what you believe and let me say it it matters what you believe is pilate asked the question and pilate had the same skepticism that many have today what is truth how do you know how do we find out how can you know the answer to pilate's question was standing ten feet from him amen and he's longing to know what is truth and it's right in front of him amen in plain sight you're searching for something that's just right there people in this world are searching for truth and it's just right there amen the answer to this question was standing 10 feet and you know what jesus says jesus says pilate i am the truth yeah now that's a that's a powerful claim but there's a reason why that claim was so contrary when he says i am the truth it was so contrarian so contradictory that it got him crucified now let's begs the question today if what jesus preached got him crucified if what paul preached god has got god got him killed got his head cut off if what all the disciples preached got them persecuted and killed then what are we preaching if what they preached was hated and despised by the world then we got to be careful to make sure what we're preaching if everybody in the masses accept it and the churches fill up and mega churches with thousands of members i got a question what are you preaching you say well this church isn't a man you see a mega church my goodness they just have thousands and thousands and thousands of people well what are they preaching well message churches there's only 50 here and maybe average on 100 people an average would be more probably more like 25 people in an average message church you got a hundred people in your church you've got a pretty good-sized church man you've got 500 you're a mega message church [Applause] but his brother jd says that's not a mega church you got that you got me you got me churches in dallas joel osteen's church has over somebody correct me over 20 000 people on a sunday but what are they preaching amen if what jesus preached got him crucified and that was the truth why did paul say i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ amen for i believe it's the power of salvation why was paul using words like this because it was something that was rejected and not acceptable to culture people say well jesus you know that the the the jesus was jesus was a good man you know jesus was a jesus was a he was a prophet i believe he was a prophet he's a good man he taught good morals he taught good things you got to love your neighbor and you know love your neighbor like yourself and you you know you know hey jesus preached all these morals and all these great concepts and people can oh man they'll just eat that all up oh yeah oh god is love well i love too and it's just a love culture and jesus jesus loves me oh i love me too jesus loves you that's great jesus thinks you're awesome i think i'm awesome too and people just swallow that hook line and sinker and they take it in and the entire church is built and you have thousands of people believing it yeah that's right amen one of the one of one of these isms is rationalism as we have it there if you ask the apostles or anyone in the book of acts church they would have a simple answer for you if you would ask them what is truth they would have one simple answer truth is the person of the word revealed no one questioned god no one questioned uh who god's word it was during the reformation that people rose up and said truth isn't what the church says or decrees but truth is god's word because you had an entire church of people declaring this is what church is and it's penances and it's it's uh it's indulgences you know that's why martin luther protested because luther said it's not what you say it is it's what it says it is it's what the word says that it is and so now you have a few hundred years later and there was a great shift in our world and you may not have realized that but a great shift they call it the enlightenment the enlightenment happened it was really an endarkenment more than it was an enlightenment and i mean that that sounds funny but i mean that it was more where man exalts man's knowledge thankful for great things that happen out of the enlightenment that we benefit from today but really that enlightenment was a further as brother branham says the more education more so civilization moves you further away from the kingdom of god can you say amen so the shift was this truth is no longer what god tells us but it's what we find out for ourselves to put it simply human reasoning replaced divine revelation you no longer accepted what the word taught you thought it through for yourself you used your own critical thinking amen got to use critical thinking i love that buzzword people like to use you got to use critical thinking or common sense truth was what i think that's the heart of this rationalism that affects our culture and permeates our schools and permeates our educational systems it makes man his own god whether he wants to admit that or not it makes man his own god because he could discover he could discover truth you want to know what truth is you can discover it you can learn it uh you can you you can rationalize it you don't need god to help you you don't need god to reveal it to you man can discover it with the use of critical thinking and common sense in his mind through his own senses god gave you a brain you better use your brain we can use our brain and we can learn by the brain god gave us we could find truth well they did that and there's how many denominations how many schools of theology how many think this way and think differently about this way that not one agrees with the next but we all have brains at least some of us do oh man can discover it with his own senses with his own mind which of course opens the entire world and the entire field for science discovery science is what you can observe to be true let me say this most of the scientists early scientists believed in god right amen you go study that for yourself galileo believed in god that's right isaac newton was a believer the first scientist believed in god bacon uh copernicus they were men who believed in god real scientists believe in god and that led them to what is called deism i think i have that giddy and you could put that up deism i'm just going to give you the exact and this could get wordy so just listen close but the deism is belief in the existence of a supreme being specifically of a creator it's the belief in a divine being a divine creator who does not intervene or have any interactions with the universe this term is used chiefly of an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th century that accepted the existence of a creator on the basis of reason but rejected belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with humankind deism they believe in god but they don't believe that god is closely interwoven and he gets involved in the affairs of the world well i'm here to tell you god's in control of every button and every lever and every lever god's in control of it all amen oh you better watch what putin listen putin can't do anything brother man said i'll take a crazy madman but i'm going to tell you what it'll take god at his designed and appointed time it'll be god who pushes the button really it won't be man and so they believe this they reject a belief in any supernatural deity interacts with humankind it means god created the world we believe that but he no longer is in control of his creation the world is like a watch sort of like a watch you know that you wind up and and and you just well god just took this watch and he just wound it up and wound it up and now it must go its own way it can't be altered uh it operates according to its own laws and and we still believe in god we still believe in god we still believe in a creator you know but many of these scientists believe that god himself could not change the order of nature so they gave their minds to discover the laws of nature and you know what happened it was good to discover the laws of nature but they become so exalted in pride in their own human intellect that they give no credit to god and by reasoning we became the people in charge of our universe in other words the authority of human reasoning took over from the authority of the divine revealer amen and this introduced the next age of skepticism it's prophesied in the bible in the book of jude if you read jude go to the next one if you could get in people no longer believe a thing just because they're told they want to find it out for themselves whether it's true or not whether it appeals to their logic whether they can understand it but it's tragic it's very tragic when a man will only believe what he understands i said that right it's tragic when people can only believe what they can understand you see there's so much that we don't understand yet we still believe i believed in pilate long before i got a record of pilate's inscription of a signature because i my belief is a revelation that's revealed and i believe outside of what i can discover or i understand i may never say brother than that you mean you preachers don't have all the answers uh-oh uh oh cat's out of the bag hallelujah right brother jd you got all the answers no no remember brother jason doesn't have all the answers we don't understand everything perfectly and clearly no but i know one who does and i put my trust in that man who does the age of skepticism as prophesied in the book of jude people no longer believe it just because what they're told uh the the man becomes listen you'll never fully understand god you can never discover god in his entirety in fact what happens is the result of rationalism is that we become uh we be we we exalt a creation but we forget our creator because science can tell you nothing about the creator it can only tell you about the creation which has changed our vision of from heaven to earth it's taken man's mind his brother aaron preached on the the in ecclesiastes the condition of the fallen man it takes his mind from looking up to a god and trusting a god and now he trusts in his own eyes and what he can figure out and understand and discover are you here still this morning amen and so he looks at it this way because it changes your earthly your heavenly vision to an earthly vision it brought man down to the material world in which we live and i'm thankful for that we can't be so heavily minded that we're of no earthly good but you should be as believers heavenly minded and look at everything through a heavenly vision so we preached wednesday night you don't look at your circumstances you look at the word amen amen and so what happens is the great shift was a shift from divine revelation of god revealing himself to human reasoning i can't understand it so it must not be true or you've got to explain it to me before i believe it's true the reaction of this rationalism was what was called a movement of romanticism go to the next slide also called the romantic era romanticism was an artistic literary musical intellectual movement that originates in europe towards the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the in the period from 1800 to 1850 some of the main characteristics of the romantic era the romantic literature includes a focus on the writer or narrators emotions and inner world it's a celebration of nature and beauty and imagination and it we're it's a rejection of of of of rationalism it's not just it's not what we learn or what we can understand or deduct by reasoning but oh you got to feel the music you got to feel it it's something you experience in your emotional realm a human it says humans are not just thinking creatures but they're filling creatures and reality needs to be felt what is true actually as you see this shift from skepticism rationalism everything that's true is what i can find out what i can discover and allah says no actually what is true is what i can feel why do you feel that why why do you think that i don't know i just feel like i just feel like it i don't know just something i feel you know it's just a feeling that i have and so there there came not just a desire for a scientific explanation we're not going to be much longer things but a desire not just for a scientific explanation but an experience of those things that we understand people want to feel something they don't feel it's real unless they felt it it's even the some people that's their true test of worship it wasn't really worship unless i felt it no listen friends real worship is when you can worship when you don't feel it at all real entering into worship is when you say i really had a rough week i had a tired week i got a headache i don't feel like going to church and i think i've got sniffles a good excuse for me to stay at home but yet you get in your car you dress yourself you go to church with a headache with a migraine and yet somehow you still raise your hands and say lord even though i don't feel like it you're still worthy of all of my praise i'm still going to give you adoration because you're worthy of it god that's true worship and so people want to feel it they don't feel it's real unless it's real it's romanticism you had the cold clinical very cold rationalism that everything's got to be rationalized which led to the field of science and then we had romanticism which led to the field of arts and paintings and music and and and it's it was a way to to help us better understand what we what is truth people look to the world around us and wanted to fill it we need to feel music music touches listen it's true music touches you at a very emotional level that's why when words can't change an atmosphere put a little music on and it changes the entire feeling remember it's drawing from both sides you do feel it music changes saul understood this and brought david in when he was troubled by an evil spirit to play music for him you say oh yeah brother matt that's true i do feel it well that's why it's important what music you listen to because music has a way to change someone that words never can and all the human intellect i can drill inside of you will never change you but you put the right music on and the right feeling and you got the right mood i could tell a funny story but i'll save time you got to feel it and it's important absolutely isn't is important music touches us at a level that intellectual can't if you can understand that's what they say you know modern art you take this picture and it's just like looks like a blob and it's just like someone took paint just and just flung it on there like i did you know as you see kids take mud and they just and then they got these paintings they sell for five thousand eight thousand dollars if you can't understand you say i can't understand it then you've understood it but i don't get it then you get it i don't understand why that's perfect leave it right there don't try to understand it because now you get it you're understanding it now you mean when i don't understand the art and the splatter and now i've somehow you felt it because what it's saying is the world doesn't really make sense i look at it you know it's it's nonsense if if foreign you it's true for me for you but that's just how you know that's that's how that's how i think you know i think of it that way it's just my opinion you know it may not be your opinion and that's okay if it's not your opinion you know what i could be right and you could be right we might both be right you might think differently live differently than me you know this is just my feeling just how i feel about it you know truth may be yours and then i have my truth and then everything just becomes relative you know this is what we have in our culture today everything's just relative and however you feel well let me just tell you right now that's not what we believe at this church that's not what we're ever going to preach at this church that's not what we stand for at this church we have an absolute that we're tied to and that absolute is a vindicated word that was vindicated thoroughly not to lift up a man but it was vindicated to lift up christ jesus the man and that word is our absolute and there is no relativeness about it and it's not my opinion or your opinion it's not what i think or what you think it's what jesus said and what he said i hold true and say lord i stand on it i may not understand it but i'm going to believe it with all of my heart and i'm going to submit and surrender myself to it truth is not a consensus of what everyone thinks and irrelevantistic or if i could say that word relativistic atmosphere there's no such there's no divisions it's true or false or right or wrong and all is relative nothing's black and white nothing everything is gray so you could never say that's wrong you know in islam there's 99 names for god father is not one of them because islam doesn't believe that as the quran says god has no son has had no son and has no sons yet we believe that god is a father because he had a son and we're his sons in an absolute age one of those is true and one of those is false but in a relative relative age both are true they're just both different aspects of truth but the real question is what's true what's truth a relativist says everything and everyone is right you know the bible has been questioned now as a source of absolute truth it's not regarded as a record of relative truth they believe i've even heard a man say philosophers well the bible is culturally conditioned the bible's culturally conditioned you know it you know what does that mean it means it's a reliable record of of how those in bible times view truth but it may not may or may not apply to our culture those things and you know what so people do they read the bible and they have a pair of scissors in this hand right and they go aha oh yeah oh i love your neighbor as yourself yeah i believe oh okay i oh no i i don't i don't know about that part clip clip clip clip clip now i don't know read the bible with a pair of scissors that's how people read the message too come on people how people read god's prophet too with a pair of scissors well you know that was just his opinion you know i don't really take that over here i don't really you know but i know his brother brandon but he was a man and you know i just i don't you know that's just not for me and i i don't know i'm just going to sort of put that on the shelf and you know people don't have a true revelation of what the bible is and so they cut it to pieces and people don't have a true revelation what the message is and so they cut it to pieces they don't realize they're cutting away not a man's idea so we said when you rejected jeremiah you weren't rejecting jeremiah you were rejecting jehovah jeremiah was just the messenger but it was jehovah's message amen everything is just relative you know jesus was a man of his time but he's not a man of our time then there's no right or wrong it's just sort of what you feel and what you understand there's no clear guidelines jesus says everyone that is of the truth that truth is something listen that truth is not something but it's someone amen the right question should have been who is truth because what pilate was searching for was standing right in front of him so truth doesn't come by scholarship it doesn't come by superior human intelligence or research because truth is a person and unless you know that person you don't you may know all about him but he said it's not to know his word but it's to know him as life you may know all about him but truth is a person no man jesus says can come to me unless the father draws him so without the inspiration of the holy spirit leading an individual to perceive spiritual things they never can many brilliant you take brilliant minds in the man age philosophers and brilliant men uh even even theologians today uh you know even even men who study the word of god yet study it their entire life rationalize it reason it understand the greek understand the hebrew can speak multiple languages yet never have met the author of the book that they're studying can you imagine understand it study it teach it have a degree in it but never meet the person because the truth can only be revealed it comes by divine revelation we're going to close un united under one head 1958 go to the next slide she said it's good to look at see the same that same devil if he can just get you to stop for a minute he can make you reason it out he can make you think with your mind but god doesn't use a man's head god uses his heart god works on his heart while the devil works on his head god chose the heart the bible says as a man thank us in his heart so is he he says intellectual conception is all right but remember when the eyes when the eye looks upon it the devil uses your eye yeah this is what brother adam says the devil uses your eye in the garden of eden he proved that the devil chose the head of man to work in but god chose the heart the devil shows him with his eyes something that he can see and he says seeing as believing but when god comes to a man i love this he comes to his heart and he lets him believe things by his heart through faith that his eyes can't see for the scripture says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen god's working here satan working here god's working here satan's working here so what god does these big schools and seminaries what do they do anyhow not always but too many times it pulls from here up to here when it ought to be taken from here down to the man's heart and now shady in 1959 a few nights before we took the subject and the garden of eden last quote i'm going to read the devil chose the man's head by intellectual god chose his heart by faith and if you walk by faith you have to believe things that you can't see or even reason with your mind we cast down reasonings when god says anything we don't look at it no more intellectually we let it soak right down into our heart and call anything contrary to it as though it wasn't right we look at what god said who gave the promise that's where the world is tangled today it's a too much intellectual preaching instead of spirit-filled churches worshiping in the spirit they're listening to intellectual messages and you can you brother madam says and you can't reason this you can't reason this out it's something that's revealed i wish i had the quote here and christ is the mystery of god revealed brother and says true faith is a revelation from god and above anything that we can pray for i pray that god anoints you in your flesh i love an anointing on my flesh i pray that god anoints you in your spirit i love that my spirit can become anointed by the power of god but above all of those things i say lord anoint me in that innermost part of my being where you can reveal yourself to me that no emotion doesn't matter how i feel doesn't matter what i see doesn't matter what i can't see doesn't matter even what i understand or what i can't understand there's something that's been revealed down on the inside of my inside and no man jesus says can take that away amen nobody can take that away it's only revealed to the elected of god and i'm so glad i'm elected oh are you glad today friends say lord i'm so glad you chose me amen i want to say lord and i want to lift the hand up and say lord don't let me be in this left ditch over here don't let me be in this right ditch over here let me walk straight down the middle of the road let me draw from both sides but let me stay balanced let me stay give me a church that's balanced give me a life that's balanced oh god don't let me be over starchy where i can't feel the presence of god but don't let me be so fanatical and emotional that i don't love my brother or love my sister or i don't understand the word itself let me stay right in the middle of both lord and let me walk down through the highway of heaven let's stand to our feet if you could musicians could you come can you give the lord a handclap of praise he's worthy of it oh give him a real praise offering this morning hallelujah hallelujah that's what the same thing happened today because that our churches listen to this has became so intellectual that we got the best-dressed crowds the best organization the smartest ministers that we have no use of the holy spirit in the way that it was back there they're full in other words action speaks louder than words they're seminaries they're the brain of their being and they're coming together and discussing this and more able they're more able more intellectual minds to set a church in order better than what the holy spirit could do they don't need the holy spirit any longer that's what brother branham's saying here they don't need it any longer it's something that we don't need today oh that's a day of the past we don't need the holy spirit to heal the sick we got doctors i'm thankful for doctors we don't need the holy spirit to speak in tongues we're all intelligent people and when you do that you take right from the framework the lifeline you cut the lifeline of the church off you cut it off he says you do that you take the lifeline jesus said to them jews in his day haven't you read this the stone that was rejected is the chief cornerstone that all the building is set upon now you see what i mean i'm sure you can catch that the reason of it is because they thought they never had a need of it we don't need to speak with tongues we don't need interpreters of tongues we no longer need the old testament prophets to set us in order by the holy spirit we understand it see they've adopted a man-made system to take the place of the holy spirit therefore there is people that's elected listen i love this he says but there's a people who's elected whose name is on the lamb's book of life and they can't go for that i say lord i can't go for that how do you feel that way church i still am in need of the holy spirit i'm thankful for doctors but i still need a healer i'm thankful for teachers i'm thankful for for the bible i'm thankful for the word of god but i still need a divine revealer of the truth [Applause] he says they can't go for that they're spiritual minded they can't go they can't stand for it no matter if they're fathers and mothers whatever lived brother branham says oh i love this [Music] i want to just read these last few quotes when a church makes maybe it wouldn't speak that right out oh maybe they wouldn't say that right out right they won't speak it right out we don't believe in the gifts of the spirit anymore but their actions prove it here's the word and the holy spirit proves it amongst them when he can get them gathered together that he still heals the sick he still raises the dead he still speaks in tongues he still casts out devils so it depends on what's on the inside of a person if a man says he's born again and he tries to place these promises of christ in the last day to some other age making him christ yesterday but not today then that man of the person has became as under a delusion by satan and if that man says he believes that and it doesn't manifest itself through him jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe into all the world into every age casting out devils speaking with tongues and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shall not they they he says they may they ought to they will yes amen say brother matthew you're saying we we need the gifts of the spirit we need the gifts of the spirit if you didn't hear me clearly enough we need the gifts of the of the spirit say we we need them foreign i said myself take my life as a living sacrifice oh my [Music] [Applause] dreams tell me hands i give myself away [Music] oh god i give myself away [Music] [Applause] [Music] i give myself away so you can use [Music] [Music] [Applause] my life is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my life is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] read this quote last night forgot to even put it up listen to what brother adam says he says we've held this ground so long keep playing that and i believe or whatever you want to change to brother tony he says i believe with all my heart that we're on the threshold of stepping into another veil yonder you believe that right on the threshold somewhere to where the greater listen he says and for me i've got both of my ears and my heart open for when it comes he says remember satan will put out a mini a false runner but just lay it aside remember it's only signifying that something real is going to take place when you see it for satan will do everything to blockade the real jewel of god when it's coming forth you'll hear it he put out a blockade to catch abel put one to catch joseph one to catch jesus he did one to catch moses for you can notice those things that satan will always try to block it that's what i believe that many cults and things that we see rising over the nation it's only a light post to say look out it'll be here real soon i've noticed among our brethren many of you is coming into you as the full gospel coming from the baptist church myself accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate work of the holy spirit and i thought then listen brother and says i accepted that that there's a work of grace that god does in our life when he not just justifies us not just sanctifies us but he fills us with the holy ghost brother brandon says i've accepted that and i thought martin luther when martin luther reached justification by faith he thought that settled it that was the light for his day and he preached it and then he entered another veil a man john wesley when calvinism began to sweep the nation and they'd settle down to saying what god's going to do he'll do it and it does it's no good to have a revival god raised up john wesley and he smashed calvinism to the ground to the place where ought to have its right balance under the works of sanctification the second work of grace nazarenes carried it on and along came the pentecostals the next the baptism of the holy spirit moving on up notice what brother ben is saying here there was a the holy spirit moving on up now listen keith on this part here and now when the brethren that's received the baptism of the holy ghost they said this is it this is the summit this this is all of it this is the summit we've reached it we've arrived this is the sum of it this is all of it brethren that's wrong there's no summit to god's power we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of god has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never been revealed to archangels laying just ahead what's been laying just ahead of his for his church if they'll believe it for i hath not seen ear has not heard neither has it entered into the hearts of man what god has for them in store that love him friends that's not just in heaven don't place that just to the other side i have not seen and near hath not heard what god has in store for you tomorrow and next month and next month and if the lord tarries next year say brother matt what will be for me for next year more of god more of a spirit more of his love how many want that more of his power more of himself that's what's waiting for me is more don't ever put a cap on it don't ever say i've arrived i'm at the summit he says oh so i love this he says so let's move up and claim our rights i say god i want to claim my rights as a son of god how many mothers and fathers can do that today and say lord i claim my rights as a father for my children on behalf of my home i claim my rights as the son of god on behalf of my body satan you're a trespasser if you're in my body today you're a liar you're a squatter and i'm claiming my rights as a son of god brother branham says as as god opens the gates and swings out the welcome mat let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourself and organize and get to a place where we say we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus plus how much more we can hear from god listen you can't hear more we've received the capstone message you're not going to get anything greater than what we've received already what you've received is enough to change your bodies from this human element to a supernatural element but that doesn't mean that i can't take more of what god's already given me and say lord increase my faith increase my hope increase my love and cr increase my revelation [Music] i think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the lord is to receive all that you can from the hand of his bountiful mercies i say lord i want to receive all that i can it's never enough you got to keep that's why brother adam says there's one filling oh but there's many refillings and refillings and refillings how many maybe someone here today would say lord i'm just in need of that refilling right now i've received i've received you lord but right now i want to receive you all raise those hands up say lord i want you to pour yourself so and me to where i'm overflowing i want to go to greater depths than i've seen before i want a high soar at higher heights than what i've had before more power more grace more love more truth more revelation increase it lord increase it brother says the greatest thing you could pray for is revelation and i raise my hands and say god give me not great not more information i have all the information i need but give me more revelation of your word let me submit myself could you buy your heads with me let me submit myself to the word that you've sent [Music] let me surrender myself i'll become subservient to you lord let me humble myself just now i humble myself i take my ideas i throw them aside i cast all of my vain understanding vain knowledge vain imaginations and i throw them to the side and say lord i want all that you want to give me i want all of your resources i want all of your life i i'm not going to say i've arrived lord i always want more and more and more so pour it on me lord pour it in me god fill me from my head to my toes granted to our church lord grant unto this little body of believers here in buford may god you pour your spirit out upon all flesh may we receive the gifts of the spirit may we live by the fruits of the spirit not just to be heady and puffed up let us be humble with love and faith and peace and long suffering let us be filled with all the goodness of god let our church have fruits not of man's intellect as knowledge but let it be the fruits of the spirit of god let the gifts of god operate in our lives on a daily basis if you need to revive us then i say revive us oh god give our young people more than just a head knowledge or an understanding give them a revelation of the true experience of the baptism of the holy ghost granted to our young granted to our old well how many can surrender and praise our hand and say lord i i want it it's a desire of me lord would you pour out your spirit once you pour out your power more than you ever have god i pray in my life and i'm gonna surrender my heart my vessel to it right now i want greater depths i want greater heights i want to go further than you've ever been before if i've not even started my journey then i want to start my journey today lord i want to know you as paul said in the power of your resurrection in the fellowship of your sufferings grant it to our church [Music] granted jesus [Music] whatever you have brother tony oh yes sing that [Music] something keeps holding me the pool i found all that was more than i could was this you and i was on the verge of giving over the strength within myself just wasn't there something keeps holding me [Music] every day he's helping me faithfully to overcome [Applause] guiding me constantly [Music] [Music] now satan lay before his temptation his desire to steal away my faith [Music] [Music] in his grace [Applause] something keeps
