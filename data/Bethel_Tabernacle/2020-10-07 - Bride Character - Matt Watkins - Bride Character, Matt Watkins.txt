you brother matthew and then certainly enjoyed that i want you to turn to revelations chapter 21 amen verse 9. let us begin reading here revelations chapter 21 amen verse 9 certainly appreciated amen brother matthew's willingness to step up and lead worship amen and is it okay if i share a little bit of that is that all right you could just uh play something with john if you don't mind just for a moment amen uh the lord put it upon my heart maybe honest give this real brief here before we uh turn to the word before we read the scripture um i guess it was brothers am i on here i don't hear myself at all yeah the monitors yeah we might need to go to uh the monitor yeah they're on so just go to the auxiliary for them on the this mike's channel and bump them up for me if you could amen about a month ago i guess it was september 1st um yeah about the first of september so almost a month ago now i was fellowshipping with a brother and we were just discussing certain things and brother matthew came up in the conversation and i expressed to him and it was i was brother travis who i was talking to and uh and i told him i said you know i said uh the lord put it upon my heart i was sitting in church sometime in the beginning of august and you know lord just drops a thought upon your heart sometimes and i just felt just right there in church the lord i've seen matthew just the back of his head and just the lord put a thought on my heart lord's got a call in in matthew's life to lead worship and so i had that thought in my heart and i thought well you know the thought came in my mind and i just said okay lord you know well maybe in your time in your season i'm sure you know you do all things well in your time we don't rush god we do everything according to his time and uh and i just expressed that to brother travis and uh brother travis his eyes lit up and he said who told you that and i said well i said no one know what he said he's brother you've never talked to matthew about that i said no never i said i didn't even know you know my mind if he'd be that'd be something he'd want to do i felt the lord told me in my heart but i sort of kept it to myself and uh and he said well then it has to be god you haven't talked to nobody said no he said then it has to be god i said why he said because matthew's told me privately that uh that the lord told him that but that he was waiting on the lord waiting for someone to ask him before he would do it and he said so it just has to be god i said well i said then it's just the holy spirit then we'll just wait for the lord so i just kept it in my heart uh and then coming back from arizona i was thinking about it some more and then this afternoon i had actually been scheduled to lead worship tonight on the calendar and then realized i had to preach so at about 11 o'clock today i realized i gotta get a song leader and i was gonna call brother brad maybe brother tony get someone to fill in for me and then i just at about three o'clock i came into the church was sitting right here and just prayed and waited on the lord and just studied got out my laptop said lord i'm just gonna turn to your word and and right then the thought came again you gotta have a worship leader tonight or you're gonna be in trouble so right when i thought that i picked up the phone and started starting to pick up the phone and the holy spirit just stopped and said maybe right now that's just how it came to me maybe right now i thought okay so i just got up my phone and said well lord i'm just gonna text him so you know i said to brother matthew i said i just texted him i said brother matthew said i've had you on my heart lord put you on my heart about the last few weeks i said i'll just make it real simple and ask you would you pray about leading songs tonight and i said and if not tonight then in the future and he just texted me back i'll call you right back and he calls me he says brother manny said i and i said let me just tell you so i told him what happened with my conversation and celadon with travis and uh and he said i was about to ask you the same thing he said in fact when you texted me and asked me these songs i was going to ask you did my dad call you and talk to you and ask me to ask you to ask me that i said really he said i was just in arizona and i just talked to my mom and dad about i guess maybe to pray about it or this was counseling with them and said i i want to pray about the lord for me to have a way to approach and let brother jason know and he said even this past weekend i had up my heart to talk to him but it didn't happen and now you're here asking me if i would lead songs tonight and i think you even said today you said the lord he told the lord lord i'll lead songs if someone will ask aren't you glad god does all things well give the lord a handclap of praise hallelujah praise the lord and certainly grateful for that well revelations chapter 21 verse 9 let us have you read and then we'll have you be seated i'm going to minister to you here tonight and the lord has just um given me this thought here today actually the past about a week ago he started dealing with my heart and putting it together today like always sometimes you have something and then it just gets larger so we'll just get to what portion he would have us get to amen and then we'll stop it's already 7 32 now i would like to speak to you on bride character bride character and there came unto me this is revelations 21 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife also uh turn to revelations 19 1 scripture and we'll read this verse 7 i know these are real familiar to you revelations 19 and verse 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready lord we're grateful to be in your house gathered once again lord to those that are gathered here present father those that aren't here lord but maybe streaming on line lord i pray father you would just connect us all by your spirit lord may your spirit father be in this building be in this pulpit lord lord may you give us unction to speak this what you've put upon our heart lord all throughout the day you've just been dealing with me lord and i just want to be able to express that to your children lord i pray that we would have an expectation lord and not only that but ground lord that could receive the seed lord for your word is a seed and that's what we look that's what we long for here tonight god not the idea lord of the theory lord we we've had enough of man's theories lord what we long for is truth lord and i believe your bride just wants truth lord that's what stabilizes us in this hour now may you come and give it to us lord each and every single one in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated tonight amen les can you hear me okay you can hear me okay out there in the audience okay good i'd like to speak to you and brothers i sent you a powerpoint on bride character and if you want to display that you can go ahead and have that displayed and ready and i'd like to just begin speaking here about a lot of things that i'm sure that we are familiar with and things that we've heard you know many times we hear things growing up in the message maybe just uh sitting on a church pew and we hear many things many good things amen but we'd like to sometimes just go back and to center in on what is it that we believe and what is it that we teach and so we'd like to just maybe take some rudimentary things things that would be maybe simple to you uh or a rehearsal of things that you already know but i just believe the lord could quicken them amen tonight amen and so we i don't know what we'll get to it's amazing the lord started me in a certain direction and so i'm not really sure i felt like the lord gave me a big shift at the end of the day so i'm just trusting him and uh and and i just don't know where we'll get to with this but we'd just like to begin we read here in in revelations uh the very last book of the bible that it's talking about a bribe and the scripture in revelation speaks a lot more than the two scriptures that we read about this in revelations 21 and also revelations uh 19 7. we know that scripture very well the bride has made herself ready but you know who is this bride that we speak of and we use that as a phrase the bride of jesus christ i'm and we have many different uh uh adjectives we'd use to describe that we would say she's the the wife of christ even the bible calls for that and says that his wife has made herself ready we would call her the elected lady brother brandon calls her that and says she's the elected lady by grace it's only by grace but the bible speaks of in revelations that there's this marriage of the lamb and so we see this relationship that god has and throughout the bible the bible is a book of marriage and we understand that that the the even the word is written in such a way that it would speak to many different classes of people it speaks to different many different uh what god what brother branham would take in the church age book and he would call that uh classes or he would call it designations of humanity we know there was designations of humanity all the way from the beginning with cain and abel that there was always brother branham said there was always uh twins of every revival amen and but we know that the bible is going to speak to the whole world it's going to have things that you that you read that has redemption for the jews that don't apply to us at all it's going to speak of the seven trumpets and the seven uh the seven thunders the seven sills the seven vials the seven stars we all know that that would have a designation that god was designating it or specifying it for a certain people a certain time and a certain purpose so what's important for us is it's one thing to understand what god is going to do with the jews we could we could spend weeks and and we could study about what god did uh with his jewish people and what god is going to do going to do and what he's doing presently what he's going to do in the future and it'd be good to understand that we could speak what god does to the heathen and and the one who never heard the gospel we can look at what god's going to do in the future to those that never had a chance to hear in the millennium yeah uh we could preach on any category of people we could preach on the foolish virgin we could preach on uh uh the make believer but tonight i want to turn our attention to the bride of jesus christ and i believe that it's important for us to understand what the scripture says not just for the whole world but for you and i yeah specifically how many can say lord i want to know that so we know that the bible is it's a book we could call it a book of marriage we find this all the way in the book in the in in the beginning with adam and eve you want to use this okay all right that helped my voice out a lot if i could hear myself amen all right god bless you there we go praise the lord so the bible is we said it's a it's a book of it's a book of marriage and we could see this even from the beginning uh in genesis the bible speaks of adam and his bride and you can go look at the first couple and you could see how the the scripture says in first corinthians 15 45 the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit so we know that adam and eve was real it was it was literal it wasn't an a allegorical it wasn't an analogy but it was two real people who really lived yet we know that their life would typify something greater than their life it would it would be spoken of even as we just read from the apostle paul when he spoke of the first adam and if there was a first adam there had to be a second adam and so we know that second man adam was the lord jesus christ we know that if there was a first eve there had to be a second eve if there was one man and adam all die then through the second man christ all live we know that if there was a first eve that fell there would come a second eve who didn't fall can you say amen and so god's thoughts are he's expressing something throughout the whole bible and he's telling us about the position that adam first held in the beginning the authority that adam had and then it goes on to speak of the fall of man and we know the restoration it was all going to be about the restoration and the redemption of man and don't let me lose you in some of this uh foundation here to stay with me close i believe it's going to uh it's going to just uh mean something here throughout but we know that the bible the the book of genesis uh means the seed book right it was the book of seeds it was the book of beginnings we know very much we could call it the alpha book we could call the book of revelation we could call the book of genesis the first book we could say revelations is the last book right we could say one was the the beginning once the end revelation the the the revelation the book of revelations was the ending of all things it was jesus says i am the first i am the last i am the alpha i am the omega so christ was throughout all of it through genesis to revelation so brother adam said if you can't see jesus in every verse go back and read your bible again because the bible speaks of men who would live parabolic lives even the life of noah the life of jonah when he goes into the belly of a well was a real happening but it spoke of something further it was a shadow it was a parable of what was going to happen to christ that he would say just as jonah was three days in the in the belly of a well so the son of man shall go into the belly of the earth and so when all of these things spoke of something ultimately it was all the plan of redemption it's any it's an i love uh uh brother aaron conte told said that years ago when i was just a teenager and i was trying to understand the book of revelation and he said brother matt you have to you have to write in your bible and he's and he showed me in his bible about every 100th page he has an arrow going left in the middle in the crease of his bible he had an arrow going this way and an arrow going that way and then a word eternal over top of it and he said just understand that everything you're reading it's an eternal book this book had no beginning it's the mind of god it's the word of god and it has no ending so it's it's multi it's has many types it has compound meanings it's the mind of god and it isn't just about the expression that god put on ink on paper but it was a thought expressed it was an eternal attribute of god the word of god is an eternal attribute it's his thought it's his mind so we know that the bible says that adam the first woman was made not from a different part of adam not from a part of the earth sorry but she was taken from the rib of adam so she was part of him and what was god the bible says in first corinthians 11 8 neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man brother brandon said she wasn't made of some outside material he says it wasn't another piece of dirt or god just picked up another piece of clay he said or else she'd just be a he said he said if that was the case that would show her position she's just made up the dirt like adam and he says but no she came out from adam she was part of adam that's why the bible says that adam looks at her and says thou art now bone of my bone flesh of my flesh thou shall be called as brother donny reagan says whoa man you shall be called woman because you came from the man you were part of the man and so we know that there was in genesis god was he says you're now born of my bone flesh of my flesh so what does that tell us the identity of eve was found in adam she could know who she was because of who adam was and in finding out or the revelation of adam would give her the revelation of herself and it's only when we know the second adam the man christ the word that we as the bride find our own identity and so genesis god is separating eve from adam but now there was going to be a bringing back of them together god removes that part of adam that feminist nature and he forms a woman and then he brings her back and introduces her brother branham says introduces eve to adam and she who was she she was adam in the female form right and just how she was adam expressed in a female form you are christ expressed in bride form i know this is very simple but it's profound when you really think about it who is the elected lady who is the bride of jesus christ she is jesus christ expressed in bride form she's born of his bone she's flesh of his flesh she's life of his life she was in the back part of god's mind before the foundation of the world and she's only been expressed in time in a body called time brother branham says you bypassed your theophany and so you come to this world to be tested and tempted and tried but you go back to your theophany who you really are who you really were we could just go on many different trails but we want to stay here close to our thought i don't want to spend all my time laying this foundation but i believe it's important and so god speaks of this first couple and we know that it shows us that this bride was part of the bridegroom that her identity was found in him and and now god then takes uh the role of of a marriage officer and god here's the first union brother adam says the first union the first couple the first what god you say who who's who instituted marriage god and when he instituted it he instituted it between a man and a woman amen so the world tries to redefine that the marriage covenant was between one man and one woman not one man and three women one man and one woman as brother as brother donnie says it wasn't even evelyn or brother harold beckett says it's not even evelyn it's not adam and steve it was adam and eve man and woman husband and wife and holy matrimony and he introduced the woman to adam and and and now adam introducing adam he was introducing himself in brian form and so the form was different but it was still adam she looked different than adam but it was still adam she had his mind she had his thoughts and brother branham says that even before adam uh could speak he illustrates and dramatizes this he says that eve would say you know what would speak something adam would say that's exactly what i was thinking she was in tune she was in sync she was in harmony because she was him only in a different form and so you the bible says here that we we know that the story goes on throughout genesis and you see this type of this bride even in adam and eve and now we know that that first eve falls but even throughout the entire bible what is the story of eliezer about uh the bible speaks of abraham and ali sends out uh eliezer to find uh jesus servant to go and find we don't we could preach an entire sermon on this here but i just want to pinch your minds here just for a moment when you read that story of eliezer who's the servant and and he goes to find a bride for isaac and he takes this long journey and and he has to wait at the well and and he prays uh you know uh uh for in a certain way for a certain woman uh and rebecca was going to have to respond in a certain way to identify to the servant that she was the bride of isaac and so it would show that that it would show us clearly uh that that it was god's choice it wasn't her own choice it was god's choice that he chose her to be a bride for isaac and so we when the bible says here of eliezer it says and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me god good speed and show me kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water the daughters of the men of the city come out to drill of the city come out to draw water let it come to pass at the dams of the whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thee thy camel's drink also let the same be she that has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born to bethuel uh son of milka the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy picture and she said drink my lord and she hastened and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink when she had done giving him drinks she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking that's genesis chapter 24. and so now what are you seeing a picture of a bride who's appointed for isaac who was isaac a type of christ who are you a type of rebecca it was all a marriage book it was all a love story and eliezer spoke to her we know the story begins to speak about isaac and and and she and the brother and says she believed every word that he spoke to her about him and so what did god do in this age he sent a messenger an eliezer uh the seventh church age messenger and what did that what did brother branham do he wasn't pointing anybody to himself it wasn't about fallen in love with eliezer or brother branham it was about he he told us about christ and we believed every word that he said he told us about the character of jesus christ and we believed every word that he said he expressed the character of christ and when we heard it we heard the voice of god when we heard the voice of god we weren't hearing the voice of a man we're hearing the voice of our beloved can you say amen and so the bible says that this uh story here you go on beyond that and the bible says jesus speaking in john chapter 10 and you already have my power point up that's just fine you can hold it there if you have a bible you can turn to john chapter 10 or i'll just read it to you uh he says we'll just do that because i'm going to turn to a few of them and it'll take you too long to to find them but this is john 10 27 and i want you to notice that that the it wasn't just genesis that speaks of a bride it wasn't just the story of eliezer it wasn't just what was the the theme of of the song of songs ellie solomon's song of solomon which means the song of songs it's like the king of kings it's the song of all songs and what was his greatest song that's what the song of songs means this was solomon's greatest song what was it about a bride and a groom and a bride who's waiting for her groom my beloved behold he quickly cometh i see him through the lattice what is solomon describing he's describing you say brother matt why what is this why is this important because this was to the bride this was to identify you this is your portion in the word of god the story of brother branham tells of the jewish the the first old testament bride and how she falls away then there's a you know the brother branham says but god's going to have him a pure unadulterated spotless chaste virgin the apostle paul speaks of this jesus spoke of that bride who would be made up that bride of jesus christ who would be in obedience to the word and who is that bride is she an organization no right is she uh is she does she have some headquarters no no headquarters at all it's an it's you say brother matt who is it it's individuals and jesus would speak to individuals not a group body but collectively they would make up the bride of jesus christ you say where would they come from the whole world what language would they speak every language in the world uh one organization no sort no uh organization what what kind of people all kinds of people from all kinds of walks of life from all kinds of backgrounds all colors of skin but she would be the bride the many membered mystical bride of jesus christ jesus says my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me uh he says in john 15 4 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in me if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done he says in john 14 15 if you love me keep my commandments so the apostle paul begins to speak about this and he says in ephesians husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so what is paul beginning to speak of he takes the same the same uh uh uh a story of marriage the same story of union you find in genesis and eliezer in the song of solomon and and and and now paul begins to say i'm i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband so he starts to talk about this and in the ephesians and he goes on he says husbands love your wife just as christ loved the church for he says so want men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh and then paul stomps because now is going to take the compound meaning is he talking about a literal husband and wife relationship yes husbands love your wives oh the wife says amen but then he stops and he says but there's a greater mystery in this you see because the word isn't just going to speak to one literal husband and wife then he says this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church so what's he identifying there would be a many membered body that comes from all walks of life a glorious church that would be holy and without blemish and would be a chaste virgin unto christ say brother matt why did you take all that time to lay out the foundation because i believe it's important rather than just quoting quotes and saying brother branham said to go back to our bible and say this is where this comes from it's a principle right here in the word i didn't make this up i just read it to you brother branham didn't make this up the prophet of god it wasn't his own doctrine it wasn't his own teaching it's only a restoration of the original word that's what we believe can you say amen uh we we we know this that the bible says that just as and so we could we could lay foundation of that i'm gonna read you something here and i just believe it's so good and i i got this really chopped up so forgive me while i i just find this find my place here i want to make sure that the that i get that i get this right uh and let me just find the find the right uh quote here i want to make sure we get get the right one because i got this chopped up on the wrong on the wrong one let me just find it here um let me just find my place here uh he says no matter how much teaching you got you can drum that into you god is not in big words i love this god is not in big words uh god is in an honest heart you might stand here and speak big words like i don't know what that doesn't bring you closer to god you can stand and practice how to repeat your sermon and say these things that don't get you closer to god you can learn dictionary till you sleep with one and it still wouldn't get you closer to god a humble submitted heart in the simplicity is what brings you to god amen and that's true amen a humble heart god loves no matter if you don't know your abcs that don't make any difference just a humble heart god dwells in a humble heart i want to get to these but i want to make sure we get to the right the right spot here he says the god of this evil age now notice her long hair nazarite vow to the word i'll picture the bride of christ now we picture the antichrist where she is religious and everything science and he speaks about that and god of this evil age and he's going to identify that antichrist he says but now let me give you the image of the bride because we're preaching on bride character and he says we picture the antichrist where she is religious and everything science now the humble little bride of christ just simply believes the word amen remember let's just picture the bride of christ here senator matt how do we identify what is what is the identity how do you what is the character of the bride of jesus christ brother branham says he makes it so simple and i love the words he uses he says now the humble little bride of christ just simply believes the word whoever she is that doesn't point to any group doesn't even point to himself but he's going to identify will picture the bride she just believes the word she can't always explain it and that's okay she believes it amen i know that makes a lot of intellectual people upset we got to understand it we've got to we've got to have we've got an understanding of the word of god brother adam says that whether she understands it or not she believes it she simply believes the word whoever she is he goes on he says it's individuals i hope and trust that there's many sitting present many listening in and notice this and i hope that myself and every one of you all are part of that bride notice what he's saying here he doesn't even say and i know that i am oh bless god you know i can see the opening i preach the opening of the seven seals i'm the bride of jesus christ here we are in 1965 and he says and i hope that myself amen what is he doing look beyond the words he's identifying the character of the bride what is the character of the bride oh bless god i'm in the bride no it's i hope i'm in the bride by his grace i will be all i want to do is believe it confess it and live it he says i hope and every one of you are part of that bride i hope many and it will all that's been ordained to that will be that yes now we can make this so complicated but it's so simple amen brother matt who's going to be the bride who's who's in the bride and who's not all that's been ordained to yeah amen that will be that say who's it going to be is it going to be the people we we force and we pressure when we've put him into fear no no she just simply believes the word you say but the man are you part of that i trust and believe in hope that i am amen brother branham says it'll it that's all that's been under he says every one of you are part of that right i hope many and it will all that's been ordained to that will be that cuz it's here's why because it's their nature in other words if she's the bride she'll act like the bride if she's god's cha if if she's the wife of christ she will be you don't have to force her you have to press her you have to pressure you won't have to fear tactic her into it it's who she is she wants to live this way she wants to dress this way she wants to act this way because it's her nature that's inside of her you know i fear sometimes we we spend too much time trying to force people into a mode of something that they're really not is that okay i believe we have to be careful because you can't make a person a believer you can't make them a believer no one could make me one all the prayers of my mom all the prayers of my dad couldn't make me one god had to make me one you can't force someone to believe you can't force someone you can you can try but unless it's in their heart brother branham says all that's ordained you say brother matt who's going to be a believer those that are believers because it's in their nature listen to what he says here the word can only recognize let me make sure that's right the word can only recognize the word the word can only recognize the word it can't recognize nothing and he stops a wheat can't be nothing but a wheat it started a wheat it'll head up a wheat and a weed can never be a wheat yet it's watered by the same anointing see but it ate a wheat amen listen to me friends no matter how much we try to force a weed to be a wheat it'll never be a wheat no matter how much you try to force it brother adam says a week can be nothing but a week at start of the week it'll head up a week and a weed can never be a wheat yet it's watered by the sow someone could sit under the same anointing but if it's not a wheat it'll never be a wheat it'll always be a weed who is the bride of jesus christ they are exactly who god has ordained before the foundation of the world to be the bride of christ and it's not an organization it's not a group it's not a clique it's not a denomination amen it's individuals uh brother adam says i'm having trouble here he says her long hair nazarite val there we go it's working shows that she's vowed to god her beautiful gown of his promised word for the age that she is living in wrapped around her vindicating her with himself of hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and she's part of the word groom true to him in every point now he's identifying the bride here right she's true to him in every point now look if a woman goes out here and is married to a man she goes out and makes love with another man has an affairs with him and come back to her husband he should kick her out is that right she must be true to him now he's using a a a human example to typify something spiritual a mystery behold i speak a mystery of christ in the church not all who say lord lord shall enter in not all who are saved are bride not all whose christians are elect this was in the very beginning even in genesis and eliezer what are we using we're using all of these types to show you that that god loves the whole world there's many who will be his children but then there's an elected group of people who are different they're his bride he said brother matt i know who it'll be it'll be those with long dresses long hair and they that that group no no it won't no it won't be them you say then who will it be it'll be those who god ordained to be amen you so so what do you say about what i'm saying is that you can have all of those things but if you're a weed you'll always be a weed if you're a wheat you'll always be a weed and a true believer an elected family of god some of the madness are you saying that we shouldn't have long hair and long no i'm not saying that that's not that's that's who you are it's not something you do as a result it's it's not it's not what you do to make you the bride you do that because that's who you are it's you say brother matt it goes to our conviction it goes it goes to our intellect no it goes further than your intellect goes to our conviction no it goes further to your conviction then it's in the heart no it's even further than the heart it's you know where it's at it's in the dna of who you are it's it's your gene that's why brother brandon's called it a gene seed of god and we as much as we can try we can never force that god's got to do that right amen brother adam says here and the bride of christ is vowed to christ he's the word not even weak at the other side a woman should not even weaken another man she should make no signs no emotions at all towards him for she is absolutely a bride to one bridegroom we don't want none of your mixed trees your denominations be true to christ the word he'll vindicate it to be true no sir not even any emotion of anything towards making love to him not join his ranks or anything else or or let him get in your arms or or in his care or talk to you over this way that way you listen only to his voice whose voice the voice of your beloved the voice of your husband and that's not your pastor and that's not the prophet you say brother matt who's my spiritual husband not the prophet not your pastor your spiritual husband is the husband of all christ you listen only to one voice my sheep know my voice a stranger what is his voice listen to what he says here any man's voice is his word and this is it the bible not one word to be added to it or taken away just stay right with that voice a stranger they won't follow a denomination she's part of the groom true to him in every point waiting for the wedding uniting not at the ecumenical council but in the sky at the wedding supper she's been given this is for our church she has been given and revealed to her the seven seal mysteries of the bible she sees the folly of the deceiver so you say for the man see all of these are identifying signs because she sees the the because she sees the revelation of the seven seals because she sees the false church then she's the bride no no no no no you got it backwards because she's the bride she sees the revelation of the seven seals because she's the bride she sees the two vines in the same church because she's the bride shall overcome the world and the lies and deceptions of the world because who she is is found in christ we're already at 809 and i'm i'm almost uh i'm just barely scratching the surf surface here but we know that the bible says all who say lord lord will not enter in we know that's from the bible so god's got an elected lady we're going to pick this up here in a moment god's got an elected lady can you see that in the word raise your hand if you can see it say i can see it for the man he's got a holy group an elected bride an elected people and you say brother matt what is god doing god is right now 2020 september preparing by the word that bride to meet her groom god is moving right now whether you feel him whether i feel him whether you recognize him whether i recognize him god's moving right now let me go further god is speaking the spirit is speaking to the elected church whether i hear him whether you hear him or not god is speaking and i want to say lord i want to hear your voice when you speak i want to see you when you move i want to be in tune with your spirit i want to be making myself ready to meet the groom god is preparing you say preparing what the marriage supper of the lamb and the body just as just as god introduced eve to adam god will introduce that he may present to himself a chaste virgin a holy without blemish without spot or any such thing god will introduce her and say you say brother man who are those it'll be those with the character how do you identify them they have the character of the bride of jesus christ they have the character that's laid out in the word they're they they have a they have a zeal in their heart for jesus they have a passion to know his word brother says what did that first church add they had a passion to know his word oh i ask you tonight very evangelistic here tonight but let me just ask you do you have a passion to know the word of god he says they they had a cry to reach out in the spirit i say lord let me reach out in the spirit they they the character of that bride those that make up that elected body they are absolutely in love with jesus christ brother adam says what will she be she won't be a lukewarm lady of seeing he says that bride of that last day she won't be a lukewarm she'll be fervent she'll be on fire she'll be in love she'll be madly in love with the lord she won't be falling away she'll be falling in love do you want to fall in love with him all over again and so they they they're love their love they're betrothal they're in expectation they're in love let me let me just preach to you here on the the character identifying this character they're marked by their love not their knowledge they're marked by their love not their knowledge who will be the bride those who have all the revelations all the mysteries and they can line up every seal and every horse rider and every vile every plague every trumpet they'll be they'll know everything don't know who the no it's not they're not known by their knowledge they're known by their love of the word of god they may not be able to explain it but they love it they may not be able to extribute but there's an attraction they're attracted to the word of god they long for it they thirst for it it's their daily bread because it's who they are they won't be known by their knowledge they'll be marked by their love of him what do we have in churches today millions of denominations thousands of dimensional churches marked by intellectual uh by an intellectual gospel an intellectual pursuit you said for the man oh we're condemning them no no no no that's what they're called to they're god's children not preaching against that necessarily we could preach against certain things of it but god didn't call us to theology is that okay i'm just going to say that here tonight god didn't call us to seminary god didn't call us to education god called us to a love letter and a love relationship one that's known brother branham says though he knew his bible really well brother branham says i may not know the author he says i may not know his book but i know his i know the author and he said i'd rather know the author than know his book i'd rather know him paul said to know him is life can you say amen tonight so what what is it what you say brother man are we preaching no but i'll go this far as to say it's the intellectual theological seminaries that produces the ladies and lukewarm church that kicked christ out right brother branham says in revelations 3 christ was outside of the church knocking behold i stand at the door but brother adam said how did they get him how did he get out there they kicked him out of their church says they didn't want this sin killing sky blue holy ghost filled religion they didn't want that kind of pentecostal experience so they kicked him out and they traded him not for heathens not for idols not for voodoo for religion cain was very religious we know that he says cain was more religious than abel was but he says but he didn't want to do the will of god his pride kept him from him so this this this the all this church uh that their bible schools their seminaries they're filled with teachers uh who spent years engrossed in language and doctrine i forget uh brother jason how many you told me before to be a get a doctor of uh of theology you have to know phi is it five languages five languages could you imagine just to get your degree you have to know five languages by the matter are you preaching against it no i want to be so clear i'm not preaching against it they are doing what god has called them to do and how dare we stand by and criticize the bible says all fruits will bring forth after their own kind amen they're they're schools but but but yet i am saying it is that that produces the the church that jesus says you're not hot you're not cold you're lukewarm so i'll spew you out of my mouth can you say amen they they they they study uh they spend years engrossed in the doctrines and the theology and they're engrossed and desp the even the inerrancy of the bible and and the textual variances of the bible the different translations and all of all of these things from a historical standpoint you're saying that is anything wrong nothing's wrong with that but let me just stop here and say something very simply we're not called to that we're called to believe the word of god not under not even understand you said but man does that mean we don't understand no god gives us understanding but it doesn't come by school it comes by revelation and even after you get a revelation you can't always describe it or put it on paper amen say describe it to me i can't then how do you believe it i don't know i just do amen give me the description put it on put it on a chalkboard i i can put some stuff here and there and i can line up certain stuff but brother branham says who are they says the true believer just humbly believes the word of god amen whoever she is they're intelligent they're they're ex they've exalted themself they're prideful about their large uh uh uh groups and programs uh let me just say this to you today they they they uh let me make sure don't miss this here just for a moment so that last day church is filled with intellect knowledge uh intellectual but but then there's a group of people who have accepted him not on the basis of knowledge but on the basis of love brother branham stops and i'm going to bring this powerpoint up here and i'm going to go to the very beginning you see how backwards i had it but i just want to catch some of these because this is what the lord originally started dealing with me on so lest we miss it uh i want to make sure we we catch it and i won't read all these don't get scared everyone's getting so scared might as well just preach till sunday more than that brother adam says wait on this is this is bright character wait on one another be servants to one another don't be bigger than somebody else try to see how little you can be i've often heard it say don't never be big in your own side if you're big let it be in god's sight belittle in your own sight every man that humbles himself god will exalt but those who exalt themselves god will abase see belittle what are you preaching on bride character uh he says no now both sides if you notice it started in genesis religious on both sides one of them denominational now that goes to the denominational church high-minded the other humble walking in the spirit by revelation you mean revelation doesn't exalt revelation humbles how could abel ever know that it was a lamb instead of fruits on the from the field because it was revealed to him by a divine revelation what's the denomination trying to do exalt itself like lucifer they so called themselves the church the bride which they are in revelation uh 17 as it is spoke of the false bride above christ little flock the bride lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of god's truth by the knowledge of the revelation and has placed himself by a seminary education and theology until they have gotten themselves up and if you don't belong to their group then you are an outwash i've heard of an outcast and i'll know what an outwash is now you see why we have so many different denominations you see why we have so much confusion one believing this the other one believing that because the spiritual rev because because the spiritual revealed truth has to come through god alone the words hid from the eyes of the wise and pruding god said so and he reveals it to babes such as we'll learn so be a baby amen that didn't get a lot of amen jealous so be a high proud intellectual message believer no be a baby humble yourself and say oh god here i am just make yourself known to me i love you god will reveal himself to you he'll make himself himself known to you how do i know more of god make yourself a baby humble yourself you say then how do i know more of god humble yourself more how do i get greater get littler get smaller humbling ourselves to the word brother says in these theologians see this bible they read it but they don't want to do it see it shows the serpent seed they've seen it vindicated and so simply before the people but it seems like it's so hard for people to humble themselves to the word of god don't you he says you're all fine you're talking women to girls about wearing long hair they say well why you got to have long hair see why do you wear skirts down long you got you go to talking to them they kind of give you the shoulder isn't that right see they know that's right if there's any lady in them they know that's right but you see they can't humble themselves to that see how cain did he couldn't humble himself to the vindicated word of god he couldn't do it you know brother adam says this and this is this is powerful here he says abel's message had been received cain saw it knowed that god had vindicated that message right but he just couldn't do it i thought about that he just couldn't do it his pride kept him from it that's right his pride kept him from doing it he says in god's power to transform so it seems to be so now so hard for people to humble themselves to the word of god they just don't want to do it they'll humble themselves to the to the creed of the church sure but not the word of god not the word of god i i you know i thought about that today and over the last couple weeks you know pride it is so easy to recognize pride in someone else but it's so hard to recognize pride in yourself let me just admit it here today we all have a huge blind spot to pride in ourselves and brother branham says what is the characteristic of the bride she's not proud she's not love boasteth not it's not arrogant it's not puffed up it's not prideful james the book of james says humble yourself in the sight of god resist the proud so humble yourself in the side of the lord and he'll lift you up what is it saying what is the characteristic of the bride brother and repeats it over and over she just humbly simply believes the word of god amen she has a humble attitude he says no matter how much teaching you got we already read this god's not a big word he's in an honest heart let me go pass some of this here he says god dwells in a humble heart not in education not in schools not in theology seminaries not in all these other different places not in big words not in classical places god dwells in human heart and the lower you can break yourself down the more simple you can become greater in the sight of god amen now notice brother branham says we just we just read this she simply believes the word whoever she is i was broken up and i'm sorry let me get to the same spot here because she's vowed to him the bride of christ is vowed to christ uh let me just get to it here and he says see the two opposing spirits at work in his evil age can you see that each very religious canaan abel spirits again coming on their heads still same as they started one worshiping by beauty by knowledge by education by science by ethics and the other one by faith of the revelation of the word of god both of them is standing right in this building this morning that's right revelation or faith he says in his word makes no claim of knowledge i love this quote right here revelation or faith in his word makes no claims of knowledge the real true christian so it's not about knowledge or education revelation isn't about knowledge education it's about knowing him can you say amen but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride the person here there here of somewhere else some of the church some of the nomination whatever it is some not he says believes the word of god obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she's watching for it she is part of that word and she's watching for her life oh can you raise a hand and say lord that's what i'm waiting for she who is that bride let's identify her she's waiting in love for the promise of this age she's watching for it she's part of that word she's watching for her life to manifest that word the body is waiting which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen then here it happens then she wakes up god said let there be and there comes forth like the first one come forth so what is that it's a it's a it's a bride now notice even the scripture speaks in matthew 24 and it talks about these servants wicked servants who would say the lord delayeth his coming you remember that scripture really well and so we know here that that jesus says in matthew 24 verse 44 he says therefore be also be ye also ready i'm trying to mute that for in such an hour you think not the son of man cometh for in an hour you think not i think it was my dad's sunday was it saying that that's when when is the lord cometh when you think not when all this happens and this happens no when you when you when you think not so what did we just read brother branham says what is the identified the character of that bride she's an expectation she's waiting she's watching she's looking it's a characteristic of the bride of jesus christ she's living in expectancy you say when brother matt continually continually what will you be doing tomorrow waiting for the coming of the lord what will you be doing in five years waiting for the coming of the lord if he doesn't come tomorrow i'll be waiting for him the next day why because i've already been betrothed i'm already engaged to this to the son of man now i'm just waiting for my groom waiting for him i'm expecting him my heart's an expectation for the lord say why because he could come at any moment where do we put the coming of the lord at any moment any moment at any moment could happen right now it could happen right now brother and i'm old but this has got to happen and this has got to happen remember that the sister came home but you preached on the coming lord but brother and all this has to be fulfilled and you got to look over here in his brother and says sister that could happen in five minutes just like that at the hour you think not are you are you here tonight the bible says while the bridegroom tarried this is matthew 25 while the bridegroom tarried what are we in now the terry while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and so so what was it it was a loss of expectation that there was a tarry that the excitement comes the bride's coming the groom's coming and there's an excitement but then in the terry portion when the lord terry is coming then they all slumbered and they all slept what do you do when you lose your spiritual expectation for the coming of the lord you slumber and you sleep peter says it this way uh he says this this is second peter chapter 2 chapter 3 verse 12 looking for and hastening brother josh can you put that up i'm going to read some of these and i want to have them on the screen second peter chapter 3 second peter chapter 3 verse 12 why you're finding that i'm just going to start reading and if you get it up before i'm done that's fine this is peter speaking he says looking for looking for watching looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat you're waiting for that yeah in fact hastening looking for hastening to the coming of the day where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved you say do you believe in global warming i do it's right here in the bible the bible will be globally warmed but as one man said it won't be because your hairspray it won't be because of of uh you know something we're putting in the environment but it'll be because god decides it's time amen and the element shall the the heavens be on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat paul says in first corinthians 1 7 he says we wait for the coming of the lord jesus christ but but what's the world saying maybe not by their words but by their life their life is saying the lord delayeth is coming for since the fathers have fallen asleep all things remain as they are amen that's that's the siren sound of the world but there's something another voice that we've heard that says behold the bridegroom cometh prepare yourself what is the voice of the bride saying in this age even so quickly even so come lord jesus what do you read when you read what you hear about oh you know you yeah we're not going to preach on it here by no means but some of you who uh who watched that wrestling match last night that boxing match last night what does it do to you brother matt it gets something deeper in size even so come lord jesus quickly lord jesus even so lord come what is the bride the spirit and the bride say come where does that come from from something down on the inside of you when you look at the chaos in the world something says come lord jesus even so come lord jesus i believe that's the identity that's a characteristic of the bride of christ she's not looking to stay here she's not looking to plant down roots she's looking to get out of here and he's coming soon we're going to close he's coming soon jesus is coming soon say how do you know it brother matt because i could feel the beating down on the inside of my soul there's something inside of me the word only recognizes the word there's a deep that calls to the deep there's something inside of the bride of jesus christ something pulsating something yearning in our hearts and yes even so come quickly lord jesus oh oh why do you think you feel the lateness of the hour why do you think you feel to pull away from the world to get rid of the world the vain riches of the world to separate yourself unto christ you didn't put that there god put that there oh he's not delaying his coming but i can hear his footsteps at the door i can hear the song soon and very soon we are going to see the king i can hear the song just any day now my lord is coming uh he'll be returning for you and me oh i've been watching and i've been waiting just any day his face i'll see oh what is the song of aegis said gladly may we herald the message of his blessed appearing what what is it it's an expectant bride who's in an expectation for his coming you think of think of of mary magdalene and the bible speaks of mary and and and and and john maybe we'll turn there john chapter 20 you can put it up uh verse one i want i want just to catch this before we before we close here it's just 8 30. so just give me just a couple more minutes he says here in john 20 verse 1 i want you to notice this here the bible says that that the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulcher and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher now this is a woman who loved jesus who was looking for the expectation she had an expectation for the lord jesus and the bible says that now now now this was this was uh this was a a who was she she's a woman typing what a bride typing what an expectation she had a fervency there was a zeal there was a love there was an affection for christ and the bible says that that she she in in in verse one the the reader the first day that we come to mary magdalene early when it was yet dark so it was sometime in the in the early wee hours of the morning maybe two or three uh a.m when it was yet dark even unto and he says unto the sepulcher and seeth the stone taketh away from the sepulchre and so mary comes to the to the to the sepulcher early in the morning notice where everyone else is why doesn't it say that all peter and everybody and and all the disciples it doesn't say everybody was there at the grave at the sepulcher it was one woman are you seeing this everybody else was asleep but mary's up early in the morning and the bible says she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciples and so she comes uh while everybody else sleeps and the bible says she sees the stone rode away and the body of jesus is missing and so she goes to peter and john and it says that she she she uh she runneth and cometh the simon peter and the other disciple whom jesus loved and said unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him uh verse 3 and it says peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre so what do they see now he's not there his body's gone and the bible says they they the the two disciples come the other discipline came to the sepulcher verse four let's just keep reading here so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulcher verse five and he's stooping down looking in saw the linen clothes line yet when he not in verse six then cometh simon peter following him went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie verse 7 and the napkin that was about his head not lying in the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went and also that other disciple which came first to the sepulcher and he saw and believed what did they do they remembered the words of jesus notice that they saw the bible says they saw and believed what mary's words his body's not there the bible says here they uh the next the next verse verse 9 first yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead verse 10 then the disciples went away again unto their home they leave who's these people peter amen john they they seen and believed and that was enough we're going home we've seen it we've seen it we've seen all we needed to see we're going home but notice the difference in mary but mary stood without a decepticon weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre what was it it was mary was longing mary was yearning she saw the napkin she saw and believed others left and went home but the bible says that mary seeing and believing that the the bible says that the disciples went away again unto their home so so there was there was there was something further though there was something more i want you to catch us here today there was something more not just like not just like most christians uh you know who says well i've seen the power of god and you know of course i believe in god and of course i've seen miracles i've seen the dead raised him and you know i love the lord with all my heart but and then they go home they believe and they go home but then there's a mary who stays at the sepulcher and says but but i want more than just the story i want more than just the history i want my lord i want more than just the evidence i want him there's a weeping there's a crying there's an expectation mary didn't want just his word she wanted him she wanted him what does the bride want she doesn't just want his words she wants amen can't understand it can't explain it but i want him mary stood without the sepulcher weeping oh what did mary realize this life is not worth living without him what about everything that had happened mary it was all good but if he's dead it ain't worth living what about all the miracles mary he delivered you of seven demons mary what about all the things god has done in your life all that was good i praise him for it but i want more than just what happened yesterday i got to know him today i've got to recognize him every day when on wednesday no then again on thursday then on friday then on saturday then on sunday i've got to have him because this world is not tolerable to live in unless i have him what is it it's the character of the bride she wants him she doesn't want us just the theology or seminary or a doctrine or mystery she wants him uh give

guess what happens angels appear to marry they appeared to the one who was waiting and expecting the lord paul says there is laid for me a crown of righteousness that the righteous judge shall give me and to all of them who what love is appearing do you love the appearing of god all those who love his appearing verse 14 she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus said unto her woman why we bestow whom seeketh thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him and i will take him away she wanted him for himself she wanted she wanted him for herself what is that what is the song to say mind mind mind jesus is mine oh my mind mine it was something personal to mary
