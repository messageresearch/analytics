shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and paul says from such turn away verse 7 ever learning that's a good description of 2020 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth amen let's just pray heavenly father we thank you lord this evening for your word lord for we believe lord within your word is life lord it's everything that we need today lord in spite of what we try to fill ourselves with lord and what remedies we might take to relieve stress or to try to relieve pressure or anxiety lord and we all have different human outlets lord but truly what we need tonight is your word for father it's our satisfaction lord i pray god that you would just come by your spirit lord may you just take the words that i speak father and i pray god that they would be a seed lord from your word that would be sown into the hearts of your children we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated thank you musicians i'm preaching to you i want to speak to you here tonight on the age of neurotics and brothers if you could um these these uh speakers here were i set them up for this one brother diggs was here now they're real real loud and so you could turn those down just a little bit on my left and right just here the age of neurotics and i'd like to subtitle this the spirit of the last days or the spirit of the end time i want to read you something that i didn't have time to put up uh on the overhead but i'm just going to read it i want you just to listen as best that you can amen i have it here before me that's better perfect thank you brother mark uh and i want to just read this before you and just listen this is brother branham and the lady you see in church age god says this church of the ladies see in age is wretched that word comes from two greek words which mean endure and trial has nothing to do with trials that come to a true christian for god describes a christian in trial as blessed his attitude and his attitude one of joy whereas this description is phrased as wretched and miserable how strange now listen to how he says this how strange in this age of plenty and in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it's more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge in science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we have went from the horse and buggy all the way in one generation we've went from the horse and buggy all the way to the space age and we're proud and boastful about it but inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are felling for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up and brother joe carter texted this in our sound booth chat and actually had it pulled up as a definition i'm just going to read it for some of us who would hear the word neurotic and i'm sure we could all derive our own meanings from that word but i want to read you just exactly what a neurotic would mean and i think brother branham even would apply this word differently you'll find brother branham in one place saying that he's been in erotic his whole life he says anyone who's who's inspired or he says inspired musicians to songwriters he said they tend to be neurotics now what he's speaking of there is a nervous person a person who's just nervous that's a a condition that some people have others don't have it uh and it's not at all what i'm preaching on tonight so i just wanted to clear to make sure we're clear on that i'm speaking of a condition of the end time that the world would fall under and neurotic means that you're afflicted by neurosis a word that has been in use since the 1700s to describe mental emotional or physical reactions that are drastic and irrational at its root a neurotic behavior is an automatic unconscious effort to manage deep anxiety now listen to what brother manning begins to say here about this age of neurotics he says it boasts now listen uh because we don't have it so just i wish i could uh post this but we don't he says there without a known reason their hearts are falling for fear he says it could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my god to the wicked they are miserable that means they're objects to be pitied they're full of pride they want what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built upon quicksand rather than the rock of revelation of god's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will come the storms of the wrath of god in judgment then comes sudden destruction i thought it was amazing how the prophet lays that out soon cometh the earthquake soon cometh the storms of judgment my brother my sister i believe we're in a storm they call covet 19. let me tell you what it is this is a storm of judgment this is a precursor even brother branham when he preaches the oncoming storm and he points to a hurricane going to strike florida brother branham says that's a storm of judgment god's pouring a little bit of wrath upon a state for their sinfulness and for rejecting god so you say what is this end time that's taken place uh it's pre-tribulational storms and and as a storm brewing brother branham says he says first comes the earthquake after all this age boasts of all that it has and he says but inside he says they're empty they're they're their own pain pills they're on uh they're they're they're going to doctors they're going to institutions they have everything it's the age of increase of knowledge it's the age of increase of goods and worldly pleasures he says but more than ever they're neurotics they're insane they're on the edge their stress is high their anxiety and depression is uh suffocating a generation of young people suicide on the rise higher than any other if you look at a graph of of of death by suicide from the age of 13 and under it's unparalleled in 2000 from 2001 to 2020. just that graph alone is unparalleled than any other generation of people young people taking their lives uh older addicted to pain pills yet more increased have more uh money than you could ever ask for have more goods than you could ever ask for and he says but that's why he says they're an object of pity they've built upon quickstand instead of the revelation of god's word soon cometh the earthquake soon cometh the storms of wrath of god and judgment then comes sudden destruction and in spite of all of their carnal preparation they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the earth brother brandon begins to preach on this age of neurotics and the holy spirit just begin to deal with me uh this past sunday as i was just even uh the saturday night and and preparing to minister sunday this uh yesterday or sunday the day after and also sunday morning and the lord began to just ask me a question what are you pursuing and what are you chasing and i've stopped to ask myself that question even as i was just in my vehicle and thought you know what it what am i what am i going for what am i after what is what am i pursuing in life have you ever stopped and just asked yourself that question and what is it that i'm chasing what am i trying to obtain not not saying that it's wrong i believe you should have something you're pursuing something you're chasing but i also believe that you should be able to clearly define what you're chasing and what you're pursuing and it should line up with what the word of god tells us of what we should be after because everyone is pursuing something in this life and the lord just begin to deal with my heart you know thomas jefferson said that it was the government's job to protect our right uh of liberty and and justice and life that that it's in the deca relation declaration of independence to to the the pursuit of liberty and the pursuit of justice and the pursuit of life liberty and and the pursuit of happiness and i thought it was amazing because even the crafters who wrote this document uh you have john adams and benjamin franklin and sherman and livingston and jefferson and they said it's it's our inalienable right thought of this as humanity that we're endowed by our creator that we've been given god-given inalienable rights and i believe that we have but i also believe that man as the prophet said always perverts what god gives him god gives them life and man chooses death he gives them creation and man uses creation to destroy himself life liberty and the pursuit of happiness those three words you find in the declaration of independence and it tells us their our unalienable rights that the governments are created to protect the right to life the right to happiness the right for the american citizen to pursue it to pursue life to pursue liberty to pursue happiness and we find that humanity has been on a lifelong pursuit a lifelong quest trying to capture what the crafters meant trying to uh to to to to to capture what's been coined as the american dream and everybody's pursuing something i begin to just write this in the lord as the lord gave it to me you know some people pursue a career and it's okay to have a career it's okay to pursue a career so make sure you don't misunderstand me here today but some people pursue a career a vocation something god has called them to no doubt something god has gifted them to but they can pursue that career uh so hard and chase something their entire life trying to excel and trying to climb the ladder trying to break the barrier trying to get a promotion trying to go further and they run and spend their money and spend their wheels and they invest their time and if they're not careful rather than being content in the gift that god made them there's a chase there's a always pursuing they're never satisfied it's enough is never enough as rockefeller was asked how much money is enough a little more than i've got and there's always just this pursuit of it's never enough it's never there's never any contentment within the confines of the american dream it's never enough will you say i've arrived when have you arrived when have someone actually when you say i made it well when have you made it when you make a million when you're making six figures a year when you have a uh you know the nicest cars what what defines i've made it they're always pursuing they're always chasing they're always building they're always bettering and you say brother man is something wrong no there's nothing god sometimes inspires you to better yourself or to excel at what you do in your vocation and life but if we're not careful we come under the spirit of a neurotic we come under the spirit of the last day and what we realize is that the entire world is under an anointing they're under a spirit they're there it's a spirit of greed and an unsatiable unsatisfiable appetite for more and then more and then more and then more and then more and then a little bit more of that and they pursue and they chase and they run and the lord began to ask me what are you chasing what is your pursuit in life what do you call successful what do you call what do you call it when you can say i made it you know some pursue money they're always chasing the next big paycheck or the next big opportunity some are chasing the bigger uh things of life a better car better house some are pursuing social acceptance in a higher class than what they are right now some people pursue an image their entire life and they they have an image of what it looks like to be successful and what successful people drive and what successful people wear and their as brother adam said in the world has the phrase keeping up with the joneses and it's an intoxicating spirit that is suffocating and it's it's all encompassing the minds of the world today they they do and then they're trying to make it they're trying to run after it they're trying to gain it they're trying to accomplish something and then the lord told me and i just began to write down you know some takes money some chase career some chase this or social acceptance or an image and then there's others who are pursuing something and they really don't know what they're pursuing they really can't quantify or qualify or justify or explain to you really they're driven they wake up every day they they're pushing towards something they don't really know what they're pursuing they wake up every day chasing running working laboring sweating but at the end of it all what are they striving for what is it that they're trying to obtain and i believe even us ourself if we're not careful we can ingest and and become almost under that same spirit that's upon this age that we live in where we have to stop just for a moment and say what am i seeking what am i chasing what am i pursuing what is driving me because something is driving you the world is chasing this american dream you're to pursue life you're to pursue liberty you're to pursue happiness and some find nothing but uh you know as the bible says and i found this is amazing in jonah chapter 2 verse 8 it says they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy listen what solomon says in ecclesiastes one vanity of vanity saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity what prophet hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever job 15 let him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompense david says in psalms 31 i have hated them that regard lying vanity but i trust in the lord you wonder why the world is constantly under a cycle of of or brother adam said it was an age of neurotics and it's under you're even born with this pursuit of happiness you're born with this pursuit of success to live the american dream to be successful what does it mean i'm to get a career go to college have a 401k retire young you know my children go to college and we picture in this entire envision of an american dream and they're chasing it they're looking for it they're pursuing it but my question tonight is have they found it have they found what they're looking for have they found that satisfaction after all of their gaining and all of their attaining and all of their pursuing what is it given them have they found what they're looking for let me tell you what i think when i look around the united states of america and i ask myself have you found what you're pursuing well our streets are burning our our our cities are are our leaders are screaming our our parties of of republican uh of of of democrats and republicans and conservatives our entire world is in each other's throats the entire world is on fire our our cities are being looted our streets are being burned no one has an answer it's all full of hatred and malice and jealousy the world today is full of fear it's a world full of fear where people live in a constant state of panic and just they're just always on the edge and they're always just ready to explode you don't know who's beside you at the stoplight you better be careful how you look at them you never know how quickly someone can just snap because it's an age of neurotics with a very thin veneer of happiness and the world has a very thin shallow veneer of happiness and joy have they found what they're looking for has all of this brought them real true joy have they really found life our streets are burning our leaders are screaming our people are fighting our world is full of fear our world is full of pressure our world is full of of hatred and malice and envy you know news i thought of this news has always been news and your generation some of you elderly when you were young there was news then there was news a new cycle was always revolving there was always something happening in the world we don't live in the age where suddenly things are taking place it's always been that way the only difference was is back then you heard about something at the barber shop maybe something someone read or a telegram someone sent you or a letter someone wrote you or maybe you heard about it you read it in a local newspaper but there was no connection between nation and nation and state and state there was nothing unifying there was nothing connecting and so you just lived in your own little nucleus their own little world but but what's changed today news cycle has always been here but now we live in the age of information we live in the age of the dawning of the internet the cord that unifies everybody the we live in the age of social connection where we're more connected than we've ever been and it's just at the click of a finger you can contact someone in another country you can be on skype or on a facetime or whatever a video conferencing you want to name with somebody thousands of miles across the world and and we live in an age listen to me friends we live in an age of information and with just the click of a button the press of a finger the pinch of two fingers you can ingest and consume a gallon of hatred you can congest and ingest just log on to your social platforms and scroll through three or four pages you can ingest all the hatred you could ever want all of the malice you ever want where everyone has an opinion and everyone has something to say and everybody's attacking everybody and everybody's making a stand for something and everybody's trying to be identified by something and everyone wants to give their two cents and they're constantly ingesting and constantly consuming your phones ding with notifications breaking news just now just in breaking and they live in this constant cycle of a new cycle of what's next and what's happening what's taking place and what's this person doing what's happening over here and they wonder why the world's going completely insane it's incessant uh you're just consumed listen to me friend this is no accident this is not random this is not just it just turned out this way how did we get here very intentionally how did we arrive here by a spirit intentionally that has led us to this moment because we're living in what's called satan's eden and satan has perfected his eden it's a constant notification a constant ingesting constant consumption it's not just random everything you read about uh the this this state of of this neurotic age that you live in is not by accident and listen to me brother it is being controlled it is very intentional it's controlled by an end-time spirit there is a leader to this great movement and that leader is greater than any president he is greater than any pope he is not the illuminati he is not the richest families in the world and that's so shallow to think that way he is the god of this evil age and he's being worshiped by the masses are you here tonight we're in the information age where everything the entire world is connected do you realize the devices that you hold in your pockets and at your home and your tablets and everything that's engineered in the world is engineered for consumption everything is made to consume content to take content and be able to consume it the easiest way for your mind to be able to con to consume it to ingest it to retain it it's not it's not an accident it's very intentional it's the age where every everything is designed for consumption to digest to consume to ingest and it's right at your fingertips and you're bombarded even as believers were bombarded with it every single day it's constantly being thrown at you the latest news the latest breaking now breaking now notification notification notification can't even handle it sometimes in church it's just ding ding ding going off never ending it's constant you don't even have to be i don't have no social play i'm not even part of that old devilish facebook i don't have that devilish right that doesn't matter a bit you still got it in your pocket you you you may not you may not subscribe to a blog you may not subscribe to you know some uh social platform but listen to me friends the spirits of it are intoxicating the world that you live in and the world is being fed a daily dose of anxiety they're being fed a daily dose of fear they're being they're being fed a daily dose of hatred a daily dose of pressure if we're not careful we find ourselves ingesting some of that ourself you find yourself a partaker and a consumer of what they want to feed you there's a spirit of the last days that falls upon a nation listen what brother branham says in our first slide brother again if you want to play that just display that and investments he says now let's talk and bring it back home and he says bring it home once you church members want the same thing you want some preacher he says you women that'll not condemn you for the way you dress and live somebody that'll pat you on the back and tell you that you can do this and the other and you can act like the world and live like the world and still maintain your confession of christ you're wanting those things you vote it you'll vote a godly man out of your community to get a man like that in there listen to what he says here it's the desire it's the spirit of the nation it's the spirit of the last days this is exactly what ii timothy says in chapter three for perilous times shall come listen perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud do we have it blasphemers blasphemers turn in your bible second timothy chapter three we don't have it on the screen that's all right ii timothy chapter three let's know also verse 1 in the last days perilous times shall come do you have the power point do i need to send it again okay i'll send it again that's fine uh we got it we spent way too much time on it to uh to not display it so let me just export this give me this one second here okay i got these quotations and they're just so so relevant i'm going to send it back to the um the sound booth there brothers if you can just grab it amen all right sent just sent it again if you just can try to display that notice he says blasphemers this is a description a depiction of our age and he says uh a blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and holy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers and continent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth brother branham goes on to say here and what the world doesn't realize is and what they're blind to but the bible calls this age the ladies and age blind remember brother branham says he says that was why they were an object to be pity because they actually looked at themselves in the word and said i'm okay i'm good i'm increased i'm rich i have need of nothing and he says and you don't even know it you're wretched you're miserable you're poor you're naked and you're blind you can't see it you don't realize it you can't you don't see it for yourself you don't even you don't even know your own condition brother adam says they're objects to be pitied they're they're blind to seeing that they have intentionally been fed this they have ingested this and this age of ingestion and consumption the prophet said it this way it's preparing the minds of the people for a blast amen it's preparing them for destruction right this is a powerful quote here do we have it brother it's not not displayed just open powerpoint and drag it over and display powerpoint up here on the screen rather than

destruction this world will ever know i believe that the people are in preparation so they're preparing for something or let me say it this way better they're being prepared for something right

mind has music out of rock and roll christian rock and roll it's preparing the world for a tribulation conditioning the minds they don't realize they're ingesting it and consuming it amen and he says

people are in the spirit for destruction imagine that god cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction amen before the people are in the spirit he says god did never never dis he says god never did destroy anything man always destroys himself he says now let's get back to cain again and get some of the faith in the beginning go to the next slide he says let's go back to the beginning watch those spirits how they begin to move it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow it's the spirit of anything that does remember what we said you're driven by something look this way you're driven by something you're pursuing something it's the spirit of anything that's motivating you that's why paul says try the spirit see whether they be of god or not right amen that's what we're taught you don't just take in anything you don't just do anything you pray about it you ask god lord i have the right spirit is my intention right is my motive right am i sure that that that i'm that i'm this is in the line and order of your word he says they're in the spirit he says the spirit of anything that does the work of it the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring in the latter days the peoples in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time they've got atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the day the people are in the spirit go back go back oh yeah sorry gideon you had it right go to the next one i had it wrong on my screen he says the people are in the spirit of the end time the church and he stops and he pivots the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the holy spirit notice we're not moving under the signs of the time we're not moving by the pressure we're not moving by the anxiety we're not under the spirit of tribulation or the spirit of destruction or the spirit of fear or the spirit of panic that's not what gets the bride ready she's under the power of the holy ghost she's hid away and tucked away in christ jesus who is her rock and mighty tower who is her strong tower who delivers her in the time of trouble [Music] you know i i want to stop right here and say we played the video here a few wednesdays ago of the the manning pastor in kentucky it's amazing brother matt do you regret playing that video not at all i'm glad that i did i believe it i believe there's uh a an importance there i believe it's something believers should be watching uh that it's good it's perfectly uh how would i say it it's perfectly harmless but let me just stop and say this that's not the spirit that you're under amen we've not received the spirit of fear the man the brother keeps saying brace yourself and those that miss the rapture and those that haven't received a rapture message here's their message brace yourself but let me tell you the message of the bride prepare yourself little bride the bride hath made herself ready to escape all of the judgments that are coming upon the earth that's why the bible says in the book of luke that that you count yourself that you watch that you're ready that you're vigilant that you're not taken by the cares of this world so that that day should take you unaware but that you could be found worthy to escape all of these things and stand before the son of man that's the message to the bride of jesus christ it's not a message of fear it's not a message of neurotics it's not a spirit of the last days we're under the spirit of the holy ghost we're under the power of the holy ghost we're being moved and motivated that's why we don't we're careful what we read we're careful what we watch we care for what we listen to some people will you better not watch you better stay away from those this movie or that movie absolutely amen you better watch what you watch you better pay attention to what you listen to let me go further than that you're not to be consumed with social media all the time you're not to be consumed with fox news and sean hannity and cnn and nbc i've never watched those anyways but you're not to be consumed with a constant cycle of news you're to be informed be careful you're not part of that age of neurotics that's just waiting for the next breaking news or the next thing to happen i'm watching and i'm waiting but my expectation is it's something that's worldly it's something that's heavenly i'm not looking for something natural i'm looking for the supernatural hallelujah he says the world's moving together into the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the holy spirit love how he says let's go to the next slide for the gideon he says god's getting ready to take his and the devil's getting ready to take his hallelujah getting ready to take his and i say lord come even so lord jesus come quickly and he says hallelujah we can't have the last days until people gets in the spirit of the last days we can't have a healing service now watch we can't have a healing service here until the people gets in the spirit of a healing service we can't have a feeling of the holy ghost until the people gets in that kind of an atmosphere and the people was in the atmosphere it pointed to noah he says the people was in that kind of atmosphere to bring judgment upon the earth and they're in the same atmosphere today eating drinking marion giving in marriage and all this kind of a thing like that it's producing a spirit that's why i told you it's preparing they have received a messenger and it's not the messenger of malachi 4 it's the it's the angel of the bottomless pit and he's preaching to them a gospel and he's giving them a beat to march to they've got their music they've got their movies they've got their dance they've got their drugs they've got their alcohol they've got their cycles of news what is it doing it's literally preparing a people for destruction brother branham says god cannot sin destruction until they're in the spirit of destruction my brother led me to stop and say god cannot rapture a people until a people's in the spirit of a rapture god cannot god cannot send a revival until somebody says god send a revival i want a spirit of revival a spirit of the burning of the holy ghost god consider refilling if you're in the spirit of a refilling amen i say lord get us in the spirit not of an age of neurotics get us in the spirit not to believe a lie and be damned by it but to receive a message to be raptured by it to take me off of this earth to escape the destruction that's coming amen and i don't get there by giving my opinion on facebook and giving my opinion on this political party what donald trump and what this nancy pelosi and all the same brother matt do you what do you think about all those things i think it's all vomit it's all filth our tables are all filth this world is not my home i'm just passing through my treasures are somewhere laid up beyond the blue he says the people was in an atmosphere of the day to bring judgment he says upon the earth and they're in the same atmosphere today eating drinking marrying giving to marriage all kind all this kind of thing like that and the glory of god is being preached and demonstrated the power of the holy ghost setting forth an example of the resurrection of jesus christ that's going to take the church into glory just as certain as i'm standing here that's right and men are ignoring it paying no attention to it walking away from it because they're in the spirit amen amen i think it's on the next line he says because they're in yes he says because they're in the spirit of the last day the next one the world's got to get like this god would be unjust to pour his wrath out upon a just pour his wrath upon a just people they had ignored him and walked away and satan captured them and they're there standing in that time but god has provided way today a way of escape amen that way is jesus christ by being born again by his spirit what is my ticket out of here it's not a message it's not a it's not a preacher it's not a church it's not a last name it's not a picture of the prophet it's not a message book it's not a tape it's not a doctrine a doctrine didn't die for you jesus christ died for you it's not any idea it's not a doctrinal belief it's a baptism of the holy ghost that that spirit has came back upon the life of the believer that's my ticket out of here he's provided a way of escape that way is jesus christ by being born again yes amen they're in the spirit of the last days they want to be part of a movie you say brother matt what do i see you have you have these all all of these movements that you have here's our our latest that seems to be a catch phrase today black lives matter and it's it's social let me just say this here just for a moment it's a it's a it's become becoming a cultural sign uh that that you better stand for something you better agree with something you better you better believe something and and the entire world i thought about this i thought you know it's amazing i was behind an individual and they had bumper stickers i couldn't even i couldn't even read uh what kind of vehicle it was i didn't know because the bumper stickers just were all over plastered all over the back of it and they had all of these man you just read just read a couple of them and you know sort of uh what kind of individual it is and i just thought i thought my goodness so so that this person is so in just determined to have a voice so determined to let you know this is how i feel this is where i stand this is what i think this is the bible prophesies we would have a generation of people like that that they would be lovers of their own self amen they don't stand in the mirror and go i'm so nice i look so good no no they exalt their opinions so high yes amen they believe what they think read a good bumper sticker one time you know the statement don't always believe what you hear this one says don't always believe what you think because you might be wrong amen amen don't always believe what you think because it's just what you think it's at the end of the day it's your opinion what do you see by the map when you look into the world i see do you see racism i see sin so i see racism does racism exist absolutely unequivocally exist amen why why does it exist because sin exists right of course it exists as injustices happen to different races absolutely it happens police brutality happens absolutely unequivocally happens because you have an unregenerate unborn again man and the bible says that he's a brute beast outside of the nature of god his his natural nature is a brute beast and so you put that man without character brother adam says what is power without character satanic yes amen power with characters fit to rule power without character satanic so you put a man with a badge behind behind a man with a badge give him a little bit of authority i'm thankful to god for good police but that doesn't mean every police is good police i see and social injustice i see suffering in the world unequivocal suffering across the world more suffering america thinks we're suffering there's nations who have poverty or wonder where they're going to get their next meal little children amen the world's growing in darkness the world's going insane there's there's social injustice so does that mean well you know we're to join we're to stand for you know black lives matter let me just let me just tell you a little bit about black lives matter now first off that statement could mean something very different than the movement and i understand that i understand a person could wear a t-shirt say black lives matter and they're not they whether they know it or not they're not necessarily affiliate in themselves with an organization but more of an idea black lives do matter of course they matter yeah amen of course all life is precious in the eyes of god amen [Music] but i want to i want you to to go beyond that get off of the political party here for a minute and the movement and and just watch how the devil works because what what the word gives us that it exposes the devil you if you don't believe me you can go straight on their website blacklivesmatter.com forward slash what we believe it's posted all over their website i'm going to read some of them some of them i just can't read in this in the in a church with a mixed audience but i want you just to listen uh to some of these things that they say that they believe and they they listed them they took they took um a lot of time to write this to make sure you knew what you're standing with when you wear one of their t-shirts and they begin to describe themselves and they say we are guided notice we are guided by the fact that all black lives matter regardless of perceived sexual identity gender identity gender expression economic status ability disability religious beliefs or non-beliefs or disbeliefs immigration status or location we make space for the transgender brothers and sisters to participate and lead let me give you what the bible says the bible condemns transgenderism as an abomination before god and it says they'll have their part in the lake of fire amen oh brother matt i'm just reading you the word come on we are listen alex says we are self-reflective and do the work required to dismantle this is their words not mine to dismantle cisgender privilege that means biological gender of how you're born a man a boy or a girl we are dismantling that idea mute that screen if you could brothers uh brothers if you could mute this screen here just display a blank slide we do our job to dismantle cisgender privilege and uplift black trans folk especially black trans women we build a space that affirms notice women we build a space that affirms women and is free from sexism and environments in which men are centered well let's go back to the word again the bible teaches us that the man is the head of the home amen that's biblical not sexism right yeah the man is the head of the home just as christ is the head of the church god put the man as the leader and the spiritual provider and the head of the home right amen amen now they can have their i know that i know that that flies in the face of of of the world's agenda today that they're the beat that they're marching to i'm just reading you the word i know is that we get the age gets darker these kind of things become less popular and more uncomfortable yeah yeah but it's the truth and the truth is the only thing that will set us free yes amen it says we notice what they say here uh uh we make space f for for this he says um we dismantle the patriarchal practice that requires let me let me just move past some of this is not readable really you can read it in your own at your own place and it says we disrupt notice their words dismantle disrupt we disrupt the western prescribed nuclear family structure what is the nuclear family structure one man and one woman yeah right yeah not adam and not adam and steve or even evelyn as brother donnie reagan says it was adam and eve right let me say it again it wasn't adam and steve it was adam and eve it was not even evelyn it was adam and eve it says we disrupt the western prescribed nuclear family structural structure requirement we foster a queer affirming network a queer affirming network let me tell you what the bible affirms the bible affirms a a a the bible says that homosexuality is an abomination to god just like transgenderism let me give you what the word says they might be queer affirming and then because they're anti-god they're anti-bible their anti-what what the word of god says we foster a queer affirming network when we gather we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking or rather the belief that all in the world are heterosexual we cultivate an intergenerational and communal network free from this thinking notice you say brother matt what is this movement i'm going to tell you what this movement is this movement is a satanic movement that plays upon the suffering of people racism real absolutely is it suffering absolutely absolutely but what they've done is they've taken the suffering of some people and it's not about black lives right it's not about it it's not about progressing or helping the african-americans that's not what it's about at all it's agenda is a homosexual transgender agenda amen it's a guys listen to what brother branham says here and we're going to close here i know we're getting 8 25 now he says but god has provided a way that way of escape is jesus christ by being born again jesus says that there will be perilous times shall come men's hearts would fell for fear he said there would be distress between the nations roaring tidal waves that's never been heard of before bursting forth into the seas how then all these things signs would be coming to pass just like it was in the days of noah it would be again how marvelous just remember just remember the last plague that fell was death and the last thing god has given us a warning after warning after warning after warning now the last thing that's come is death spiritual death the churches are spiritually dying amen here they go you have the slide brother getting if you can display it i don't know where we're at on the slides let me make sure we're at the right space just press start from that slide oh you went from the beginning you have to go on down to it uh keep going yep keep going right there here they go moving down there one of the writers said now listen to what he begins to say and i'm gonna just turn a corner and then we'll we'll close because what jesus prophesies of this generation and the book of revelations chapter three is that this would be a lukewarm age it would be a lukewarm generation and he said there would be cut there would there would be a church that would evolve in the end time that the church notice not the heathen now but there would be a church that would evolve in the last days right before the coming of the lord that would boast it was rich boast it was growing boast it was increasing that it's self-sufficient a world a church world that has great influence in the world what we need today is a church with great influence let me tell you what jesus said of this church he said in this church who's rich and increased with goods they have need of nothing yet you're miserable poor wretched blind and naked and you don't even know it revelations 3 17 uh as as one evangelical was just reading the other day you know was praising donald trump and oh you know we we we're going to have godly leaders and we're gonna have godly godly president godly congress and we could just get those supreme court justices i thought you know i mean it's easy to get behind some of that and go yeah i really wish yeah oh boy it'd be it'd be so nice you know and that but they have this entire vision of of that that we're going to have this great christian that the the church world is going to have power again we're going to have influence again the church of god needs to rise up we need to protest we need to rise up we need to make a stand we we have our rights brother branham said a real christian lays down its rights we have our rights we we we're not going to be pushed upon we're not going to be pressured upon and this church this man was saying oh it's it's going to move into government we're going to have government positions and it's going to be in all of the greatest uh halls of finances and buildings and leaders of the world we're going to take over and we're going to we're going to have spirit-filled men passing laws and and doing away with abortion and doing away with pornography and crime and and all of this other thing and god's is going to raise up this great church and to take dominion and you know what it is it's a it's a it's a it's a false thinking a false dichotomy that says that of a kingdom of god on earth there's a kingdom of god on earth coming but it's not in this earth it's not in this this condition of this earth amen amen there will be no peace till jesus comes it's this thinking of this kingdom of god on earth that we're we're to better ourself even the church world has gotten behind this that that that it's that we're we're to have you know a righteous rule and and we're to all of the nations we're just joining together and we'll all be bound up and and all unified and they will it's prophesied they will and they want you know what they want this church wants power yeah now they don't want the kind of power you want they want political power i'm not looking for political power i'm not looking for political influence i'm looking for the power of this word to come alive in me and change me and change me at an atomic level at my atoms that changed me from this vile creature to a incorruptible they're looking for the power of politics i'm looking for the power of god they're looking for political influence i'm looking for spiritual influence upon my life god says this a ladies in church that you're lukewarm you're you're you're lukewarm you're you're you're not cold you're not hot and he says i'm gonna spew you out of my mouth they're destined for judgment destined for wrath he said brother matt does that mean that god just doesn't have anybody let me tell you something brother and sister god has a church that's not lukewarm that's not in spiritual lethargy that's not intoxicated with this world and its vain riches god has a people that is going to be existing in the final days before the rapture who is living holy they are living a separated consecrated life they are burning with the desire to see the the soon coming of the lord jesus god has an overcomer it's not going to be survivors the bible says to him that overcometh well i grant to sit with me on my throne god has a people amen i believe i'm one of those say lord if i'm not let me be lord jesus a people that walk in the light of their day that walk in the light of their message oh they have spiritual discernment in the age of spiritual blindness you say brother matters this the church is supposed to be progressing and we're going to be busting out of the seams and all it's david said it this way in the rapture psalm in the time of trouble you'll hide me in the time of trouble you'll hide me in the cleft of the rock and the secret of your tabernacle it's going to be a time of trouble luke 21 12 says and this is this is what jesus says he says they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake he goes on to say some of you shall be put to death you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake what did paul say in second timothy paul says all that live godly will suffer persecution amen all that live godly will suffer persecution uh woe unto you this is what jesus says woe unto you when men shall speak well for you for so did their fathers to the false prophets you say brother matt is what what is what does that mean that means that this elected group this elected people won't be a popular people right right we're gonna have political power and protesting out here in the street we don't live by the same we don't live by the same ideals of the church nominal world we don't think the same man we're not looking for social acceptance right in fact we're looking for the opposite to say when they speak if they're speaking woe unto you if they say good things about you right yeah so matt does that mean go ahead and cause trouble no shouldn't be causing trouble but let me just say it this way if you're if you're socially if you're able to be accepted and you believe the message of the hour and you're living the message of your generation i tell you what it did to jesus when he preached the gospel it got him crucified yes tell you what it did to paul it got him beaten with stripes got his head cut off eventually yeah then how can we preach the gospel of jesus christ and then everybody just embraces us and loves us hello somebody hello the age of neurotics we're going to close musicians could you come we don't have time to get to this next portion we'll save it and then musicians let's all stand her feet i want to read you one more that i have brother getting if you just go past that brother branham takes this up in the literacy and church agency it's titled in your book the last warning we have that just display that if you could going past that slide there keep going oh uh uh go back go back yeah back again back again back again right here revelations 3 22. he that hath and ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches i love this this has meant so much to me as i read it again just before service brother branham says this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet he's speaking of that new jerusalem every facet of her beauty tells a story of amazing grace and jesus's love she next slide she is a city prepared for a prepared people she is a city that is prepared for a prepared people i say lord let me be that prepared people is that your desire tonight friend say lord i'm not going to listen to the world siren song i'm not going to listen to the cycle of of of what's driving an age to an age of insanity and neurotics let me hear a different voice lord let me hear a different beat not the beat of the world's drum that they're beating not to get so involved and so that's we were never meant to get involved in this world in their politics she's a city prepared for a prepared people oh as i begin to just read that again i just raised my hands and maybe you could do that and say lord let me be that prepared people he says she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will thrown her streets with joy yes it's the last call it's the last call the spirit will not speak at another age the ages are over next slide but thank god at this moment the age this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by the spirit but once again a prophet is in this land go to the next slide and they that will hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelations 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come on you know what that you know what that's saying the spirit and the bride are saying

about to fade into eternity for the church ages then it will all be over then it will be too late to come but if somewhere i want you to buy your heads with me as i read this bow your head with me but if somewhere in this series god has dealt with you by his spirit may you even now turn to him in repentance and give your life to him that by his spirit he may give you eternal life i wonder maybe you could just raise a hand today and say lord pour your spirit out on me oh let it fall fresh like rain let me hear the word of my beloved i don't want to hear the voice of this world and the music and
