========================================

[Music] [Music] so [Music] good morning everyone god bless you let's stand up and pray gracious heavenly father we just come to you now in the name of jesus christ and we want to dedicate this time to you we asked lord that you would come and you would break open your word to our hearts lord may it not just be a a nice teaching or a nice topic lord but may it be something that penetrates deep into our soul and brings change and transformation and strength strength lord to walk in obedience living the life of this word and so we just commit that to you we ask your holy spirit would come be with the speaker and be with the hearers help help us to get ourselves out of the way that the spirit would flow we ask in jesus name amen amen let's go to our opening scripture romans 12 9 and 10 and my topic is christian character this is part 7 and subtitle is love romans 12 9 9-10 let love agape love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly one to another with brotherly love philadelphia in honor preferring one another may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so it uses three different words for love in these two verses so uh let love agape be without the simulation and then it goes on it says be kindly affection to one another this word kindly affection is one greek word it's phyllostorgos so it's a combination of filio love and fam storgos speaks of or storge speaks of family love so combined into one word you have brotherly love and family love so be kindly affection have brotherly family love to one to another with and he repeats it again philadelphia so three things three three things put into that verse writing right in that phrase philosoph with philadelphia so it's like he's paul is placing a greater a strong strong emphasis on this and i think sometimes uh in the message we hear the difference between filio and agape and we say agape is better filio's bad no that's that's not right filio is is very good it's encouraged constantly the the the brotherly love is spoken of time and time and time again and it's lift and we'll read some of those it's lifted up as critically important um just to look at agape love because we tend to look at it as simply as divine love that's true it's higher than filio that's true but i want to look at it this way in strong's concordance the kind of the expanded version of that it says agape love is wider embracing especially the judgment and the deliberate ascent of the will as a matter of principle duty and propriety so it's love that is looking at god's purpose for you it's beyond your feelings it's beyond your emotions it's an act of the will to act on god's word regardless of how you feel um brotherly love is more on the on the sense of this is this is an a a common affection that you have for one another it's brotherly you know it's not a love to somebody out in the world walking in in in sinfulness agape love needs to go out there because you're loving them because the bible commands you to love you love your enemy you agape your enemy but you're not gonna you're not gonna have brotherly kindness to someone that hates you you're gonna have agape right so it talks about these different storge it's family love it's not outside of that so when you're looking at this combining filio love storge family love into one another be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love it's not a bad thing it's not even it's not even a lower thing it's something that god wants us to have for he each other and i want to just bring it a little bit more real to you is brotherly love is like friendship love filio love is on that level of friendship it's a mutual enjoyment that you have with one another filio is speaking more of this is this is the joy that you get out of being a friend of luther's you know he gives you joy you give him joy it's back and forth agape love says well brother luther is not very fun to be around it's not true but just as an example he's not very fun to be around you know he's always hurting my feelings and uh always always speaking against me no he's not but you know you can you can picture in your mind somebody that's speaking against you fighting against you you are too you're commanded to agape them you're not going to have affection towards that person but you're commanded to love them and to do good to them and so they're you know those things are new you know it's important to understand first thessalonians 4 9 and 10 but as touching brotherly love philadelphia you need not that i write unto you for you yourselves are taught of god to agape one another isn't that interesting but as touching filio love i don't need to write i don't even need to write to you you that's just something that you have for each other it's built in your connection to each other as christians there's a brotherly love there and i don't even need to write to you because you are taught of god to agape each other so you see now there's an overlap now we've got an overlap brotherly love is spoken of i don't need to as touching brotherly love i don't need to write to you because you're taught by god to agape each other so when you speak of agape it's also speaking of filio it's within that it's only it's a higher level you know you can have filio towards brother luther because of the enjoyment that you get but then your love has to go a little higher than just that it has to go in well even when he bugs me i still reach out i still pray for him i still do good to him i still treat him with friendliness i still treat him with felio even though i'm not feeling it so to speak because i'm commanded to i'm i'm taught by god to agape and he says indeed and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more so increasing more and more in phileo and agape first thessalonians two seven through eight but we were gentle among you even as a nurse nurse cherishes her children so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also our own souls because you were dear unto us agapetos is this word it means beloved you are beloved unto us so paul is speaking there again of agape they were dear precious again filio speaking of friendship it's not disparaging way of talking about love it's a christian virtue that's to be lived we're taught of god we don't need to be taught to do it because god himself teaches us to agape one another and we have to grow more and more in love and so this is in a lot of ways this is talking about christian friendship christian friendship is not just on the level of filio you know we talk about friendship it has to be better there is a friend that's closer than a brother there but they're a friend but it's a better it's a better friend why is that because it's a christian friend they're going to correct you and you need correction they're going to take care of you when you have a need there's something greater than that because it's not just filio it's also agape both of them together and again i'm not i'm not preaching on this to say i expect you guys to treat me this way take care of me this way this isn't what this is about this is just simply about this is scripture this is this is love and we it struck me that we talk about friendship and we look at it as sort of a secondary thing but i think it's really a part of the family of god filio filo storgos a brotherly family love that he tells us to have and that's that's what we need and we need to grow into it more and more the christian ethic is not selfish self-centered not what we can get out of it it is let every man seek not his own good but the good of others but in relationships friendships every relationship husband and wife just like nature if it's untended it tends towards wildness it tends towards isolation so if you leave a friendship alone you don't put any effort you don't do anything what happens you're automatically isolated that's how friendships go that's how marriages can go if you don't put effort into it you separate you might live still in the same house but you still from your heart you separate from one another and so this christian ethic of friendship of filial love is something that takes what effort work thought it's not just something well i just i just go i just go with the flow no we can't go with the light life's flow or even our hearts flow we got to go with the words flow we got to live our lives by that love that's in us like we talked about last week we have love inside of us shed abroad by the holy ghost but we have to take off our blinders we get so focused on our own life our own devices both metaphorical and actual devices we're so focused on that we don't see anything that's going out on around us and so the love just kind of stays right here right in front of us we have to take the blinders off and let love that's flowing into us flow out of us and so again like nature friendships relationships of any kind move towards ice isolation past hurts frustrations lead to isolation and not to fellowship not to love look what jesus says i think this is just so stunning in john 15 verse 15. this should give us such a beautiful viewpoint of what friendship really is henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knows not what his lord doeth but i called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you jesus defines friendship right here and it's a beautiful definition friendship is opening up your heart and your secrets to another person amen connecting two hearts together in oneness in christ that's what that's the dif uh person that's a servant you don't tell them what you're doing you just make a commandment go and do it jesus said i i want you to do this and i'm gonna tell you the reason why i want you to do this i'm going to unfold this mystery this secret to you so that you understand it so that you go and walk in obedience to that if you love me keep my commandments you know there's that love that friendship that connection that type of friendship though it demands loyalty and it demands trustworthiness it demands fighting the spirit of gossip because if when your heart is open to someone and they betray that what happens there's hurt and the openness closes and so how precious do we need need to treat the friendships that we have the people that were around the body in the body of christ we can't betray one another you know scripture is so clear and that's a whole sermon in itself about gossip and betrayal and and so forth but you know that type of friendship that jesus is talking about not the world's type of friendship not america's type of friendship or egypt's type of friendship or africa's the bible type of friendship actually it exposes you to the possibility of being hurt and having your having trust broken but didn't it expose jesus christ to the very same thing it never stopped him didn't prevent him he made himself transparent to us and for us and yes he didn't he spoke in parables to those outside but to those on the inside he spoke openly his heart and even they ran away from him even they left him alone and it shouldn't because of that possibility of hurt and broken trust it shouldn't prevent us from doing what scripture wants us to do it opens our us up to hurt but eventually you get to this place where you realize that comes with the territory of being obedient to the lord you're gonna get hurt i mean bad most of you probably have by people that confess to be christians is that now absolve you of the responsibility of scripture no it doesn't it doesn't jesus you know you can certainly look at it and understand there's different levels of friendship right from scripture jesus had the 12 but then he also had the three his most trusted um and so that you know that's okay as we're not really looking at that here but i i know people in their minds might say well jesus had different layers of friendship so i can have the same too well yep absolutely absolutely but he opened his heart up to all he didn't make a division between in john 15 between you know peter james and john and the rest of the twelve he opened himself up to all of them and the heart of a true servant lays down his life for the brethren and i'll put an extra thing on that expecting nothing in return is when you expect some many times our hurts are from our expectations of other people if you expect that i'm here to serve i'm here to open myself up to others so that they can be ministered unto and you expect that you're gonna people are gonna hurt you then you're not gonna be disappointed you're not gonna be disappointed but you still in order to help people you have to open yourself up to people it's so critical at the heart of every believer is to minister to others not just the preacher behind the pulpit every believer you know there needs to be an atmosphere in the body of christ where all of us are reaching out and maintaining godly friendships with those people we should we should have laser focus is someone hurting that person's hurting i need to pray lord how can i approach that person not just saying blinders on i come to church i love the word amen it's good get in my car gone no have your eyes ask god to open your eyes give you a vision for those who are in need who are hurting who need to be reached out to that's all that's the ministry of the body of christ the preacher is to equip the saints for the work of the ministry not just to do the work of the ministry they're to equip you to do the serving not of the preacher of one another you know it's every joint supplying that strength and that blessing to the other joints as the scripture talk talks about but the fact is we know that there are people that are are broken they've been hurt deeply and they feel like they can't open themselves up to others and that's okay there's a bomb in gilead isn't there there's healing you need to seek healing but i'm going to tell you find the fellowship of a true friend someone that will listen to you [Music] and will pray with you about your hurts and through your hurts because god doesn't want you to be in that position where you're so broken that you can't be a genuine friend and minister to others you're not just here to absorb stuff you're here to be someone for someone else not for yourself for someone else you know the bible obviously we'll go through the scriptures probably not this time but next time puts a great value upon friendship but it especially puts an emphasis on it as having the right kind of friends that point you in the right direction doesn't just willy-nilly say have friends in proverbs and throughout the scriptures it speaks very pointedly and carefully about the types of advisors you have see they're not my advisors it's just my friends don't work that way i'm sorry if they're a friend they become an advisor to you and you better be careful what kind of advice you're getting is it word advice is it scriptural does it follow in line with the message of the hour or is it just pop culture science psychology nonsense that is peddled on facebook and everywhere else what kind of friend do you have the bible says have the right friend that leads you in the right direction if you look in baker's dictionary of the bible it looks at the word friend and it says most of the old testament words translated friend friendship or be friendly come from several hebrew roots new testament it speaks of several different words that are used we've talked about one of a couple of those ones as we look at this there's really three types or levels of friendship you know there's association which is you go to school together attend the same church work together go to the same workout facility a fellow member of whatever you know that's an association but then there's association plus loyalty you know there's an association or relationship between yourself and that person and you're loyal to them you defend them you care for them you stand with them in adversity and then there is a friendship that's association plus loyalty plus affection you not only defend this type of person but you also have a great attachment to them and so of course there's great danger in the wrong attachments great danger in it so you have to watch yourself and watch your heart if you if you come to this place where you're so attached to that person it can become actual an actual idolatry that you're worshiping that person instead of worshiping god because you're so dependent on them that's that's the danger as christians we're to be dependent on christ yes we need one another but at the end of the day who is the person that satisfies your heart's desire and need it can't be your friend this one that one you're committing idolatry when you're doing that the one that satisfies your soul has to be jesus christ and and when you're when you're in that position where your friendship you couldn't see yourself breaking up breaking off the friendship for any reason any way that you'll die if you if you don't you're out of balance you're out of whack you know you you have to see that person as someone you're serving for the sake of jesus christ examples of friendship in the old testament first samuel 19 verse 1 and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david here's not only the king but his very father says kill david then verse 2 it says but jonathan saul's son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeks to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself verse 4 and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he has not sinned against thee and because his works have been to the word very good and of course saul became angry with jonathan but here's jonathan being a loyal friend and i think this is so important because you know the next verse i'm looking at proverbs 17 17 a friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity this some this is something that struck me because uh doing missions work with iranians for years there was so much turmoil and people people there were really against brother petros and they would come and they would meet with me privately and tell me all kinds of bad things about brother petros and uh for a while i would just out of respect just listen to them tell it and and then say well thanks for telling me i'll pray about that and move on and i was listening to a uh lamplighter audio drama and i'm trying to remember what the white gypsy i think it's called in and the one character had a had a friend had a had a friend who was so close to him it was he grew up he was adopted by them and he was in the home and they were so close together and and uh someone spoke another kid was a friend with him and he started speaking bad against the other guy's friend and he said right away he cut him off and said you can't talk that way about my friend he's like a brother to me if you're going to speak that way this conversation and this friendship is over with and it it's i was so convicted i said what have i been doing petros has proven himself as a loyal friend and i'm sitting here listening to people tell me bad about him i should be upset i should be fresh i should tell them to stop that they have no right to do that and that has become a principle to me you know in in situations with missions that people have come and said i need to tell you about something over here before you talk you should understand i've been friends with this person for five years i've fought through many fires and and bloody battles spiritually speaking so before you speak understand my relationship with this person and they say never mind and that you know a friend is born for adversity lord help us to to be that person that stands with and for our friends because of the love of christ that constrains us let's stand as we pray heavenly father take these words and may they go into our hearts lord may just work them out in a practical basis within us help us to live this word with all our hearts live this love to love our neighbors as ourselves lord you're perfecting us in that in this hour leading us into perfect love lord we just commit ourselves to you we bl ask your blessing upon the service your anointing upon it move in a mighty way in jesus name amen amen god bless you [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] you
