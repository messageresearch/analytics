[0:15] you
[0:54] [Music]
[1:05] good morning everyone god bless you
[1:07] let's stand as we pray
[1:12] gracious heavenly father we just come to
[1:14] you in the name of jesus christ and we
[1:16] want to
[1:17] dedicate this time of sunday school and
[1:19] bible study to you
[1:21] we ask that your spirit would come and
[1:23] take control
[1:24] lord we just want to surrender ourselves
[1:26] lord both speaker and here to you
[1:29] and ask that you would have your perfect
[1:30] way
[1:32] lord as we proceed with the sunday
[1:35] school and
[1:36] service today lord would you be
[1:38] glorified would you
[1:40] move and work in people's hearts in a
[1:41] mighty way father
[1:43] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[1:45] christ amen
[1:48] all right our opening scripture is first
[1:50] thessalonians chapter four
[1:53] we're continuing on our topic of
[1:55] christian character
[1:57] part nine and where
[2:01] lord willing will be finishing up our
[2:04] sub-topic of love
[2:08] so first thessalonians 4 9 and 10
[2:13] but as touching brotherly love that's
[2:16] the word philadelphia
[2:18] from the word root word filio you need
[2:21] not that i
[2:22] write unto you for you ye yourselves are
[2:25] taught of god
[2:27] to love agape one another
[2:31] and indeed you do it toward all the
[2:33] brethren which are in all macedonia but
[2:35] we beseech
[2:36] you brethren that you increase more
[2:39] and more may the lord add the blessing
[2:41] to the reading of his word you can be
[2:43] seated
[2:46] so we've said it before but there's an
[2:48] overlapping between
[2:50] brotherly love filio love
[2:53] and agape love we he says you don't have
[2:56] need of anyone to teach you regarding
[2:59] brotherly love
[3:01] filio love because
[3:05] god himself teaches you
[3:08] to agape one another so when you have
[3:12] agape love that covers
[3:16] filio love as well it's not a separate
[3:18] thing it's like
[3:20] if you have agape love outflowing from
[3:22] that
[3:23] is brotherly love family love
[3:27] love to your spouse etc love to your
[3:30] enemy
[3:32] all those all those different things so
[3:34] that's cr that's
[3:36] critical that we have god's agape love
[3:38] and how do we get god's
[3:40] love it's shed abroad in our hearts by
[3:42] the holy ghost
[3:44] in other words we get filled up and it
[3:46] spills out on other people
[3:48] romans 12 9 and 10 say this
[3:53] let love agape be without dissimulation
[3:57] abhor that which is is evil cleave to
[4:00] that which is good
[4:02] be kindly affection fellow store ghost
[4:05] this means
[4:05] this is a combination of the word
[4:07] brotherly love or friendship type of
[4:09] love
[4:10] and store goes family love so be
[4:13] be filo store ghosts one to another
[4:16] with philadelphia in honor
[4:21] preferring one another so just in those
[4:23] two verses we have agape
[4:24] filio storgos philadelphia
[4:28] all in those verses it's it's talking
[4:31] about
[4:32] god's love being in us flowing through
[4:34] us
[4:36] we saw before agape love spoken of
[4:40] through the strong's concordance is
[4:41] wider embracing especially the judgment
[4:44] and the deliberate ascent of the will as
[4:46] a matter of principle
[4:48] duty and propriety filio love
[4:53] speaks of having affection for denoting
[4:56] personal attachment as a matter
[4:58] of sentiment or feeling
[5:01] whereas agape is embracing
[5:04] the judgment and the deliberate scent of
[5:06] the will as a matter of principle duty
[5:09] and propriety
[5:10] in other words god has called me to love
[5:12] and i love regardless of feeling
[5:15] regardless of connection regardless of
[5:17] anything
[5:18] whereas filio love is there's a
[5:20] connection and there's an affection
[5:22] and there's a personal attachment that
[5:24] you have there's a sentiment
[5:26] there's a feeling that you have agape is
[5:29] regardless of feeling
[5:31] filio encompasses that and so as
[5:34] christians we certainly should have
[5:35] agape for one another but it really
[5:37] not to go deeper we should have a
[5:39] feeling a sentiment
[5:41] a care for one another and that's why he
[5:43] uses
[5:44] christian love as philadelphia
[5:47] brotherly love adelph
[5:51] a delphi is the word that's used over
[5:53] and over again
[5:55] in the new testament for the
[5:56] relationship that we have together
[5:58] as christians it's like it's translated
[6:02] as brotherly but it's not
[6:03] male or it's not a male or female word
[6:06] it's a non-male or female word it's
[6:07] speaking of
[6:09] that that love that siblings like a
[6:11] siblings love
[6:13] so philadelphia is the love of
[6:17] siblings to one another and that's what
[6:19] that's what we're to be
[6:21] and and naturally according to god's
[6:25] nature
[6:26] you have that feeling that sentiment
[6:29] towards one another it isn't always that
[6:31] way in this fallen world
[6:33] but in god's plan and god's purpose
[6:35] there is
[6:36] not only agape love for your brothers
[6:38] and sisters but there's that feeling
[6:41] that sentiment that affection that you
[6:43] have for one another
[6:47] john 15 13-15
[6:52] again we're reviewing but
[6:55] i like to take two steps forward one
[6:57] step back in teaching just so we can
[6:59] really get it down greater love hath no
[7:02] man than this that a man
[7:05] lay down his life for his friends
[7:08] so i feel like jesus is really coming
[7:10] here and saying i'm going to define
[7:12] what christian friendship is
[7:16] we get this and we take this and it's
[7:18] beautiful and it's speaking about jesus
[7:19] but he's really
[7:21] not just talking about himself he's
[7:22] talking about the kind of love that we
[7:24] need to have
[7:26] for one another greater love has no man
[7:30] than this that a man laid down
[7:32] his life for his friends that's a
[7:36] that's a selfless love it's not a self
[7:39] it's not an
[7:40] inward focused love it's a love that's
[7:43] focus
[7:43] outward it's a love that's focused and
[7:46] sees
[7:47] what's going on outside and then goes
[7:50] and lays itself down
[7:52] to bear the burden of your brother or
[7:54] sister
[7:55] in christ you he says you're my friends
[7:59] if you do whatever whatsoever i command
[8:02] you
[8:03] so here this is this is something that
[8:05] doesn't go
[8:06] to one another i can't say brother
[8:10] michael you're my friend if you do
[8:11] whatever i tell you to do
[8:13] this is different that that goes between
[8:16] us
[8:16] and jesus christ only you're my friends
[8:19] if you do whatever you
[8:20] whatever i command you verse 15
[8:23] henceforth i call you not servants
[8:26] for the servant knows not what his lord
[8:29] doeth
[8:30] but i've called you friends for all
[8:32] things that i have heard of my father i
[8:34] have made known unto you
[8:36] what is he saying i have opened my self
[8:39] i've opened up my heart
[8:41] and i've shared myself with you that's
[8:45] why
[8:45] that's why i call you my friends so
[8:48] a beautiful definition of friendship
[8:51] friendship is opening one another's
[8:54] heart up to each other
[8:57] connecting communicating
[9:00] fellow fellowshipping together in
[9:03] in a way that you know we bear one
[9:06] another's burdens not in a way that i
[9:08] got news about this one i'm going to
[9:09] share it to this one
[9:10] no it's we're able to open up ourselves
[9:13] to each other
[9:14] because there's trust there's respect
[9:18] and there's an ultimate desire we want
[9:20] to see the best for one another
[9:24] hebrews 3 13 says but exhort one another
[9:27] daily while it is called today lest any
[9:30] of you be hardened
[9:31] through the deceitfulness of sin if
[9:34] we're so
[9:35] disconnected and don't communicate with
[9:37] one another
[9:38] how on earth can we exhort one another
[9:40] daily
[9:42] we can't you can't you have to have a
[9:45] connection with each other you have to
[9:47] have a communication with each other
[9:49] there has to be an openness how else
[9:51] would you exhort someone
[9:53] because you know what's going on in
[9:54] their life you know the difficulties
[9:56] they're facing
[9:57] why because you ask them you talk to
[9:59] them you communicate with them
[10:00] you speak with them and you can do that
[10:02] for each other
[10:04] and then you encourage you
[10:07] you show the scripture you show the
[10:09] message you apply it to
[10:10] one another's life not not with a club
[10:14] with love with love with care and
[10:17] sometimes it needs to be hard and
[10:19] sometimes it needs to be
[10:20] difficult things need to be said but
[10:23] that's what french
[10:24] real friendship is as we'll see that
[10:26] more as we
[10:27] look further in the scriptures galatians
[10:31] 6
[10:31] 2 bear ye one another's burdens
[10:35] and soul fulfill the law of christ
[10:38] if you want to fulfill the law of christ
[10:41] well what is the law of christ love your
[10:43] neighbor as yourself
[10:45] so how do you fulfill that love your
[10:47] neighbor as yourself
[10:48] paul defines it bear one another's
[10:50] burdens
[10:52] you know if you look if you look further
[10:54] he says
[10:55] let each man bear his own burden why
[10:58] does he say but why does he say it both
[11:00] ways
[11:00] because our inward attitude needs to be
[11:02] such i'm going to bear my own burden
[11:05] and then i'm going to bear the burden of
[11:07] others i'm not going to sit around and
[11:09] say
[11:11] these decrepit people they're not
[11:13] bearing my burden
[11:15] why aren't they burying my burden but
[11:16] that's the attitude
[11:18] that christians will get sometimes
[11:20] they're so focused on themselves
[11:23] they're waiting for someone else to bear
[11:25] their burden the bible says to you
[11:27] bear your own burden and then bear the
[11:31] other person's burden
[11:32] it doesn't say wait for other people to
[11:34] bear your burden
[11:35] i didn't see that anywhere in what paul
[11:37] was writing in galatians 6.
[11:39] you can go back and read it for yourself
[11:41] maybe i missed it
[11:42] but his attitude was bury your own
[11:44] burden and bear the other person's
[11:46] burden it wasn't
[11:47] it wasn't wait for other people to bear
[11:50] your own burden
[11:52] no we can't do that we can't have that
[11:54] attitude the body of christ can't
[11:55] operate
[11:56] properly in that fashion it always has
[11:59] to be
[12:00] okay i'm gonna take i'm gonna take care
[12:01] of my own with all that i can
[12:04] and then i'm gonna bear someone else's
[12:05] burden and if you get in a place where
[12:08] you can't bear your own burden and
[12:10] you're struggling
[12:11] it shouldn't be i give up on these
[12:14] people because they're not burying my
[12:15] burden
[12:18] too often that's that's the attitude
[12:20] that we find i'm gonna go find another
[12:21] church
[12:22] and guess what eventually you run into
[12:24] the same exact problem
[12:25] why because the problem's inside of you
[12:28] wow
[12:29] why is the problem inside of you because
[12:30] you have it backwards get it
[12:32] get it in the direction that paul had it
[12:34] bear your burden bear other's burden
[12:36] and don't wait for someone to bear your
[12:38] burden it's not how
[12:40] it's it's not how your attitude is
[12:42] supposed to work it's how it's supposed
[12:43] to work
[12:44] absolutely people should be burying your
[12:47] burden
[12:47] but if you're walking around waiting for
[12:49] other people to bury your burden
[12:51] you'll be sad alone depressed
[12:54] frustrated upset and you'll be in a
[12:57] continual
[12:58] cycle of the very same thing why because
[13:01] it's not god's way
[13:04] it's not god's heart towards these
[13:06] things
[13:10] proverbs 27 is a beautiful chapter
[13:14] in your in your own time go and read it
[13:16] i think the key word of
[13:18] proverbs 27 is friend
[13:25] faithful this is verse proverbs 27 verse
[13:28] 6
[13:29] faithful of are the wounds of a friend
[13:32] but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
[13:38] psalm 141 5 really helps explain that
[13:41] further let the righteous smite me
[13:44] it shall be a kindness and let him
[13:46] reprove me
[13:47] it shall be an excellent oil which shall
[13:49] not break my head
[13:50] for yet my prayer also shall be in their
[13:53] calamities
[13:55] psalm 141 verse 5
[13:58] i believe it is um
[14:02] yeah so faithful are the wounds of the
[14:05] friend
[14:06] it means that your friend is bringing
[14:08] correction to you
[14:12] your friend loves you enough to speak
[14:15] what is true now don't get it backwards
[14:20] a friend earns the trust of another
[14:22] person
[14:23] i said it before you don't just start
[14:25] going into people's lives and beating
[14:26] them over the head and say
[14:28] why aren't why don't they like me
[14:31] there's other principles that we have to
[14:32] follow in the in this very
[14:34] scripture you earn your trust
[14:38] you earn that trust you earn that level
[14:41] of uh transparency between one another
[14:46] you have to you have to earn it people
[14:48] don't just open up instantaneously and
[14:50] become your friend
[14:51] you earn that and then when you earn it
[14:54] now you can be
[14:56] straight with each other you can shoot
[14:59] straight and say
[15:00] brother i i love you i was wondering
[15:03] about what happened here
[15:04] not assuming the worst we talked about
[15:05] that before in first corinthians 13.
[15:07] you're not assuming the other words
[15:09] you're clarifying and you're pointing
[15:11] back to scripture
[15:13] and it needs to be given so that the
[15:15] person
[15:16] understands and knows that the motive is
[15:19] love
[15:20] and not the motive if you put your
[15:22] motive as
[15:24] well i want to i want everything to be
[15:25] righteous you're
[15:27] approaching it like a pharisee not like
[15:29] jesus approached it with love
[15:32] and tenderness that that literally will
[15:35] melt your heart like our brother was
[15:36] testifying
[15:39] jesus came to him he corrected he
[15:41] corrected our brother he
[15:43] his mother continually pointed him to
[15:45] the scripture
[15:46] in correction but what what was it what
[15:49] was behind all of that
[15:51] love and he felt that and it melted him
[15:54] and i think the same thing needs to be
[15:57] in our hearts when we approach other
[15:58] people
[16:00] if our words and our approach is not
[16:02] melting their hearts the way jesus would
[16:04] melt what i mean melt their hearts
[16:06] i'm not talking about some romantic
[16:07] thing i'm talking about something that
[16:10] puts them in the presence of god
[16:14] and touches them that they receive it
[16:16] and they receive it as
[16:18] as the love of god
[16:22] the kisses of an enemy are deceitful in
[16:24] other words flattery just can
[16:26] someone's just flattering you constantly
[16:28] just be careful
[16:30] be careful they want something
[16:34] they want something from you so be
[16:37] careful
[16:38] proverb then verse 9 of the same chapter
[16:44] ointment and perfume rejoice the heart
[16:46] so doeth the sweetness of a man's friend
[16:49] by hearty counsel again beautiful
[16:53] picture
[16:54] of friendship true scriptural not the
[16:56] world's version
[16:57] the world has a version of friendship
[16:59] and that's just mutual enjoyment
[17:01] over mutual things that you have in
[17:04] common
[17:04] that's not what christian friendship is
[17:07] christian friendship
[17:08] transcends that you might have mutual
[17:10] things in common you might like to go
[17:11] fishing you might like to
[17:13] go hunting you might like to sew you
[17:16] might like whatever
[17:17] you might be homeschool moms whatever it
[17:19] might be
[17:21] that's good that's fine but christian
[17:23] friendship transcends that
[17:25] you know we've all gone through seasons
[17:27] of life where we have a certain friend
[17:29] and they're
[17:30] it's really really helpful and then it's
[17:31] gone but christian friendship is
[17:33] different
[17:34] it isn't well it's helpful and then
[17:35] they're gone christian friendship is
[17:37] transcending our likes and entrance
[17:41] and goes deeper it's a family
[17:44] it's a family a relationship not just
[17:47] the family of god and we're all in
[17:48] relationship to god but we're also in
[17:50] relationship
[17:51] to one another
[17:55] and here the sweetness of a man's friend
[17:58] is by hardy council
[18:02] i think i mentioned this before but
[18:05] we think of friends as people we just
[18:07] have fun with but a friend
[18:09] is a chief influencer they are the
[18:12] people that you surround yourself
[18:14] that you're with that you're influenced
[18:16] by that is advising you
[18:19] and whatever they do they're going to
[18:20] rub off on you you say
[18:22] well i'm stronger than that no you're
[18:25] not because that is not how it's
[18:26] designed
[18:28] that is not how god designed friendships
[18:30] we are to influence one another
[18:33] in a good way not a bad way if you're
[18:37] if you look at your friends and you see
[18:39] the projection of their life
[18:41] and you say oh boy
[18:44] i don't want to be like them i don't
[18:46] want to be like how their
[18:47] parents are i don't want to be like how
[18:49] this is then
[18:52] question your choice of friends
[18:56] turn turn around the influence who is
[18:59] influencing who
[19:00] absolutely but you have friends and
[19:03] can you have friends that are outside of
[19:05] christ you can
[19:07] you can but you have to turn the
[19:09] influence on its head
[19:11] if you don't you will be the one that's
[19:13] being influenced away from christ
[19:16] i learned that as a great lesson when i
[19:18] first got saved i tried to maintain all
[19:20] my friends
[19:20] and the next thing you know i'm sitting
[19:22] around and they're all drinking and
[19:24] smoking marijuana and i'm going oh lord
[19:26] help me how am i going to
[19:28] not do this and the next thing you know
[19:30] there's a there's
[19:31] a drink in my hand and you're you're
[19:34] going what is
[19:35] i don't want this and they're swearing
[19:38] and cussing and all of a sudden you're
[19:39] trying as hard as you can and all of a
[19:40] sudden
[19:41] you're swearing and cussing what's the
[19:44] what's the what's the issue
[19:45] you never flipped the relationship the
[19:48] relationship stayed the same
[19:50] and it's a danger especially for you for
[19:52] everyone for everyone but especially for
[19:55] young people
[19:56] especially for young people when i was
[19:59] 20 21 years old
[20:02] i went to a church service with my
[20:05] sister and my brother-in-law
[20:06] and it was a very thing that i was
[20:09] struggling with and the minister gets up
[20:11] and begins talking about friendships
[20:13] and he says don't be unequally yoked
[20:16] together with unbelievers
[20:19] he's saying it's not doesn't mean you
[20:20] can't have friends or unbelievers you
[20:22] want to win them to christ
[20:24] but the problem is is that the the level
[20:27] of the relationship you had is
[20:29] going this direction now you have
[20:31] flipped around and you're going this
[20:33] direction
[20:34] because you're in christ but the
[20:36] influence is staying on this level
[20:38] and it's bringing you it's not letting
[20:40] you go up higher it's dragging you down
[20:43] and he said so he said what you want to
[20:44] do is sit down with your friends
[20:46] tell them what has happened in your life
[20:48] tell them
[20:49] exactly without mincing words what
[20:52] christ has done for you
[20:54] testify to them what he's done for you
[20:56] and then tell them
[20:57] the direction in my life is i want to
[21:00] live
[21:01] for christ i want to live a more
[21:04] scriptural
[21:04] holy life and they might not understand
[21:07] that but they understand it on some
[21:09] level
[21:10] and and tell and tell them i want to be
[21:13] your friend
[21:14] moving forward i do but we can't remain
[21:17] on the same level that we were always on
[21:21] we we i i want i want you to encourage
[21:24] me
[21:26] in my life as a christian whether you
[21:28] become a christian or not
[21:30] as a friend will you please help me and
[21:33] if there's a party or if there's a place
[21:35] where
[21:35] it's compromising position don't let me
[21:38] go
[21:40] don't let me go don't let me get
[21:41] involved in that if you want to continue
[21:44] to be friends on that uh with with this
[21:46] in mind
[21:47] let's continue if not then i guess we
[21:50] just
[21:50] give each other a hug and and separate
[21:53] ways and and not hang out anymore
[21:57] and i did that it was incredible all my
[21:59] friends of course said
[22:01] oh that's great yeah of course i'll help
[22:02] you and then
[22:04] 99 out of 100 vanished
[22:07] and one stayed with me and he did
[22:09] encourage me and he did say
[22:11] we shouldn't go there because of this or
[22:12] we shouldn't do that because of this
[22:15] well then i found out who really was my
[22:16] friend
[22:18] who really cared about me and i could be
[22:21] a positive influence on him
[22:23] and so i think young people that's so
[22:26] critical to keep in mind
[22:29] as the scripture says
[22:34] oh missing the scripture here yeah the
[22:37] sweetness of a man's friend
[22:38] is by hearty counsel
[22:41] make sure that you have the sweetness of
[22:43] a friend
[22:45] not the corruption of a of a fake
[22:48] false friend that's trying to drag you
[22:50] down
[22:52] verse 10 thy known friend and thy
[22:53] father's friend forsake not neither go
[22:55] into thy brother's house in the day of
[22:57] thy calamity
[22:58] for better is a neighbor that is nearer
[23:00] than a brother
[23:02] that is far off the
[23:05] importance of not forsaking your friends
[23:08] being loyal
[23:10] being faithful is critical whether it's
[23:13] your friend or your father's friend
[23:15] sometimes that's the greatest
[23:17] thing that you can have in your life is
[23:18] your dad's friends and your own friends
[23:20] that stay
[23:21] stay by you that are faithful to you
[23:23] that help you
[23:25] they'll stick with you no matter what
[23:27] and it's he says it's better
[23:29] to have a friend a neighbor that's a
[23:31] friend he'll take care of you than a
[23:33] brother who's far off
[23:35] the brother far off won't treat you as
[23:37] well as the neighbor
[23:39] who is close to you who's a friend to
[23:41] you true friend to you
[23:43] proverbs 27 verse 14 he that blesses
[23:46] his friend with a loud voice rising
[23:48] early in the morning it shall be counted
[23:51] a curse to him what does it mean it's
[23:55] loud boisterous uh flatteries
[23:59] and oh bless you they're the greatest
[24:02] friend and you're just so obnoxious
[24:04] about it over the top it it shows that
[24:07] there's something lacking there
[24:09] there's something out of cater there's
[24:11] some that person
[24:12] is not a real friend they're not they're
[24:15] not real and genuine
[24:16] they're just wanting to get something
[24:19] out of you
[24:22] verse 17 iron
[24:25] sharpens iron so a man sharpens the
[24:28] countenance
[24:29] of his friend i just want to
[24:33] probably close with that verse
[24:37] sharpening a sword in the ancient world
[24:40] was very difficult it wasn't a simple
[24:44] and quick process it took a long time
[24:48] it wasn't done in seconds they didn't
[24:50] have an electric wheel and they just
[24:52] and it's done no it was hard
[24:57] can i say hard difficult work
[25:00] to sharpen a sword by hand in those days
[25:05] it took persistent careful striking
[25:09] to get it sharpened it didn't just take
[25:12] seconds it took
[25:13] time and i believe sometimes we miss
[25:16] that in this proverb it's speaking of
[25:17] the importance
[25:19] of persistence in friendship
[25:22] it's not just a one-time thing as an
[25:24] acquaintance and we pass and say hey how
[25:26] are you doing
[25:26] and it's on it's a long term process
[25:30] of friendship iron sharpens iron takes
[25:34] time takes persistence it takes
[25:37] effort to sharpen and so does the same
[25:40] thing
[25:41] in a friendship it takes time it takes
[25:44] persistence
[25:45] it takes effort it's not a one-time deal
[25:49] it's a continual long-term effort that
[25:52] needs to take place
[25:54] it real friendship
[25:59] is long-term real friendship is with you
[26:04] through thick and thin good
[26:07] and bad they're there with you they care
[26:10] about you
[26:11] regardless of what you're going through
[26:13] regardless if you're poor or rich
[26:14] whether it's going well
[26:16] whether it's going bad they're there why
[26:18] because they care about your soul
[26:21] and it needs to go both ways iron
[26:23] sharpening iron
[26:25] it goes both ways we sharpen
[26:28] our hearts and minds through godly
[26:31] discus
[26:32] discussion and as that happens our true
[26:35] nature often comes out by these
[26:39] interactions with our friends
[26:41] and then our true and genuine friends
[26:44] they start to give you feedback
[26:46] to further sharpen your understanding
[26:48] and your character
[26:50] a genuine friend is faithful over time
[26:54] to offer his criticism his instruction
[26:58] his positive feedback but he doesn't
[27:00] give up
[27:01] he doesn't view it as this is just a
[27:03] one-time thing and i'm gone
[27:05] he views this this is a continual
[27:08] conversation that we're gonna have so
[27:11] that we can grow together
[27:13] in in christ it's not a one-off
[27:17] it's not gonna it's not gonna work it's
[27:18] not to that's not how our nature has
[27:20] changed that's not how sanctification
[27:22] works
[27:23] that's not how iron sharpening iron
[27:25] works
[27:26] it is continual effort
[27:30] continual back and forth
[27:34] fellowship friendship that doesn't
[27:38] grow tired or weary
[27:41] verse 21
[27:45] as the finding pot for silver and the
[27:47] furnace for gold
[27:49] so is a man to his praise as the old
[27:52] saying goes when the character of a man
[27:54] is not clear to you look at his friends
[27:59] there's a there's a reflection there
[28:02] that happens a man look you look down
[28:05] uh you look in though as you look in the
[28:08] mirror
[28:09] it reflects back to you same thing with
[28:10] the band's friends
[28:12] you know what kind of friends do you
[28:14] have what kind of life do you want to
[28:16] live
[28:18] then choose your friends accordingly
[28:21] amen
[28:22] let's pray let's stand and pray
[28:28] gracious heavenly father we thank you so
[28:30] much for your
[28:31] light and your love lord just continue
