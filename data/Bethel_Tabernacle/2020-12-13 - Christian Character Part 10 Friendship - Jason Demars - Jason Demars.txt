TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning everyone let's stand up let's pray heavenly father we thank you so much for your mercy and your grace we thank you lord that you have poured your love out upon us lord by the holy ghost and i pray that you would help us to grow more in this love help us to see the reality of what you've called us to in this day as your bride lift our faith to new levels lord new places that has never gone before in this hour we ask it in jesus name amen all right let's look at our opening scripture we continue on christian character part 10 looking at friendship continuing to first thessalonians 4 9 and 10. but as touching brotherly love that's philadelphia you need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love agape one another and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we seek you bret we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word could be seated so this is paul's beseeching or begging them increase more and more in this philadelphia this brotherly love which god teaches you to walk in by putting his agape love into our hearts again we said it before we love from overflow the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost so we get filled up with his love and as a result the love spills out on everyone around us and again friendship we're talking about friendship and that really comes from the word filio friend is filos filio is the act of loving as a friend filos is being a friend and so they're so connected together and i think it's very interesting i just as as i've been studying this more and more how significant the relationships we have in our lives and we really don't think of it in in terms and we look back at the scripture how much it speaks about friendship and how important friendship is it's absolutely critical in our lives and you know we've we've said it before but the right kind of friends what it means if you understood what it means to be a friend you'd be so careful about the people that you surround yourself proverbs 27 17 again kind of reviewing it we're going to take a step further um what i want to do ultimately after we do this short review is to look at the friendship of jonathan and david as a real example of what friendship is supposed to be so proverbs 27 verse 17. iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend again sharpening a sword in the ancient world took persistence and careful striking against against itself in order to sharpen it it didn't just take a few seconds it took time and so you look at this proverb it's speaking of the importance of persistence in friendship that we need to give loving constructive correction and criticism to one another to help each other grow but not only that just conversations about godly subjects cause us to grow why because it challenges the way we look at things and we get so sometimes so stuck inside of ourselves that we need to get out we need to have conversations with godly people because immediately god begins to work and bringing revelation and i can't tell you how many times the lord has worked just in personal conversations with people one-on-one not ministers just everyday everyday folks how the lord moves in my life in their life i think that's the almost the biggest way that god works in my own experience wonderful through the pulpit a blessing but god takes those things and really writes it on our heart as we fellowship with one another even just the the discussions that my wife and i have how how much it helps you to grow as you talk about the word together a genuine friend is faithful over time to offer their criticism and instruction and a genuine friend does not give up the first time his friend doesn't take his advice he doesn't get angry he's patient he says that's all right we just keep we keep chipping away we keep sharpening each other and it is it's through that real fellowship real fellowship not just having a bunch of fun together but real fellowship together that were sharpened again something came up to me that i i a point that i didn't bring out as we were fellowshipping after the service that you don't just sharpen your sword one time after you use it you have to come back and sharpen it again in other words it takes continual follow-up to stay continually sharp that's what that's what friendship requires it's not just every once in a while or i we're friends and then i abandon you it's continual friendship continual follow-up continual contact with each other to build each other up proverbs 27 21 as the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praise it's a very interesting scripture if you really look at it so is a man to his praise in other words you're you're refined by the type of praise that you get i i looked at this and i thought my that's very interesting this is what john gill writes about it uh if he is praised by good and virtuous men he may be thought to be so himself and if by wicked men he may be concluded to be so likewise if it swells him with pride and makes him haughty conceited and overbearing he will appear to be a weak and foolish man but if he continues modest and humble and studious and diligent to answer his character thankful to god for what he has and to whom he gives all the glory he will approve himself as a wise and good man what does that have to do with friendship everything everything because your friends encourage you and build you up towards the right things bad friends build you and encourage you to do the wrong things and and it literally refines you to be what that that praise is is putting out in you to go further think about it in in any relationship we speak life or death with our tongue and we can speak life into those around us or we can speak death into those around us and then for ourselves as we hear that we assimilate that we start speaking the same things back to our own selves and so that shapes then who we are because then we speak the same way we think the same way how critical it is examine who are your friends who are your fellowshipping with because that's going to shape you that's going to create the reality that is you proverbs 18 24 a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother adam clark writes on this one love begets love and love requires love as its recompense if a man does not maintain a friendly carriage in other words a friendly uh outward disposition he cannot expect to keep his retain and keep his friends friendship is like a good plant but a friendship is a good plant but it requires cultivation to make it grow you you you realize that if i i've brought this up before but people by their disposition and their demeanor either they'll repel people or they're attract people and if you come to church expecting everyone to take care of you everyone to follow up with you and for like force a friendship down your throat you're going to be very disappointed it's up to you you want friends show yourself friendly be friendly do the things that friends do text each other call each other invite them for coffee invite them to your home and if they don't reciprocate text them call them take them out for coffee and invite them for your home and if you feel frustrated that they're not reciprocating text them call them take them out for coffee invite them to your home just don't you don't give up we don't give up on one another we keep going we keep pursuing we keep loving why because that's what christ does we don't sit with our arms folded angry and frustrated no one is taking care no one is being my friend what verse of scripture is that from what doctrine is that from it's from a false doctrine it's called selfishness self-centeredness but but but the church should be you're the church so you start being what the church should be and you be the example if it isn't the way it should be then you start something you can't wait for other people if god has laid it on your heart why are you looking for someone else to do it you do it you start it you be a difference maker that's what god wants you to be he gave you that insight not to criticize but to pray and do something amen if you if you get an insight about a problem god is not saying would you just complain about that a lot he's giving you an a supernatural insight into something to take action but the people but but but but would you just do what god says to do and leave the results up to him i think probably one of the most beautiful illustrations of friendship is in the bible is david and jonathan um it's just phenomenal i'm gonna do a lot of reading of scripture and a little bit of talking about those scriptures but i want you to see just a living example of friendship first samuel 18 1-4 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul now this is after david had killed goliath and shown himself to be a incredibly valiant faithful faith-filled young man all right and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and john jonathan loved him as his own soul two souls knit together i think that's a beautiful description of godly friendship two souls knit together this word knit is the same word that speaks of when rahab tied the scarlet cord outside of her window that the soul of jonathan was tied together with the soul of david and the result of that tying together was that jonathan loved david as his own soul verse two and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul look at jonathan jonathan was in the position of power right jonathan was the son of the king he had all the cards look what jonathan did jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle you know that david was already anointed king by samuel by this time what is jonathan doing totally selfless it was him that was being robbed of the kingdom quote unquote by the behavior of his father of course not by david but humanly speaking jonathan had everything to lose by this this fellow right here all his position all his authority absolutely everything was going to be lost to david it didn't impact jonathan he took his sword off he took his bow he took his girdle he took his robe and put it on david that's that's selflessness jonathan not only was selfless but he also this was part of jonathan rejoicing in what god did through david he wasn't jealous he wasn't upset he was like this is a this is a man just like me a valiant man a man that loves god that loves his country that loves his people that will fight to the death for it and he and he puts his faith in god no matter what the circumstances wow i love this and their souls were knit together there was no jealousy there there was just pure rejoicing in the achievement of god through someone else even though it was to jonathan's own personal detriment first samuel 19 1-7 and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants listen that he should kill david that they should kill david but jonathan saul's son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeks to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee and jonathan spake good listen a lot to lose right here in his relationship with his father a lot to lose in fact the person that his father is trying to kill is likely doing it for the very benefit of his own son jonathan and jonathan is personally fighting against the purpose of his father to defend his friend incredible and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he has not sinned against thee and because his works have been to thee word very good for he did put his life in hand and slew the philistine and the lord brought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and dits rejoice wherefore then will thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause now that's a friend to take a stand for his friend to be loyal at his own co at the cost of his own benefit that is selfless selflessness and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul swear as the lord liveth he shall not be slain and jonathan called david and jonathan showed him all those those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in in his presence as in times path past the amount of selflessness in this friendship is absolutely stunning to me to think about that and and when we're looking at this is an example friendship true friendship godly friendship requires being selfless requires saying i'm going to seek the good of someone else to my own detriment that's christian friendship i'm going to give of myself until it hurts until it really really hurts until it's really really painful isn't that what jesus said no greater love hath no man than this that he would lay down his life for his friends what did jonathan do time and time again first samuel 20 verse 1 and david fled from nyoth and rama and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is my iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeks my life again this is a friend opening his heart up speaking about his difficulties his trials with his friend that's what that's another part important part of friendship being able to share your heart where you're at what you're going through with a friend but that takes trust and trust isn't built in an instant it takes time and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but he will show it to show it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so and david swear mo moreover and said you know there's a there's a disagreement in a friendship right david's saying he's going to take my life no he wouldn't do that unless he told me and here david comes back your father certainly knows that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death so here we see that basically david's saying is your dad doesn't trust you anymore he doesn't trust you because he knows that you're fighting to protect me and this is a shock to jonathan it's shocking no doubt it hurt to hear this but david's speaking the truth to him and and this is what jonathan goes and does then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee okay i take your word for it and david said unto jonathan behold tomorrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he may run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family if he saith us it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wrath then be sure that evil is determined by him therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou has brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why should should you bring why should ist thou bring me to thy father and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would i not tell it thee then said david to jonathan who shall tell who shall tell me or what if thy father answereth thee roughly and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about tomorrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and show it thee the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do the evil then i will show it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father and thou shalt not only while yet i live show me the kindness of the lord that i die not but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house forever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david everyone from the face of the earth so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of david's enemies and john jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul that's that's real friendship right there no and if there's any confusion this this seals it up jonathan knew that david was anointed to be the next king jonathan knew he was not going to inherit the kingdom from his father and jonathan said i'm going to stand with my friend david even at my own at my own loss it's incredible and time and time again jonathan has offered easy situations where he could turn david over to his father very easy and he every time refused to do it and not only refused to do it but went to speak to his father on his on david's behalf and so we look further for samuel 20 27 through 42 and it came to pass on tomorrow which was the second day of the month that david's place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meet neither yesterday nor today and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem and he said let me go i pray thee for our family at the sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favor in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren therefore he cometh not unto the king's table then saul's anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse a rebellious woman do not i know that thou has chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father has had done him shame and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him and he said unto his lad run find out the arrows which i shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him and now when the lad had come to the place of the era which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not and jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master but the lad knew not anything only jonathan and david knew the matter and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of the place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded and jonathan said to david go in peace for as much as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee in between my seed and thy seed forever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city and then 23 16 through 18 and jonathan saul's son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god not beautiful that's real friendship david no doubt being depressed distressed and jonathan being being basically the one that was his father causing the trouble jonathan gets out there and says and goes to encourage him and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shall be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth and they too made a covenant before the lord and a david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house and then in closing second samuel 1 26 and 27 this is after the death of saul and jonathan and this is the psalm that david sang he said i am part part of the psalm that he's saying i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant has thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful that word wonderful is the same word that's used for miracles it was miraculous his love was supernatural is what david is saying passing the love of women how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished that's a friendship right there brothers and sisters and that's the that's what god has called supernaturally endowed us with the spirit of god to be those kind that kind of friend to one another that we would lay down our lives that we would set ourselves aside our own desires our own position our own place in in order that someone else might have it that someone else might be blessed let's stand and pray heavenly father i i feel greatly challenged by these words lord and i see just a their living example in the scriptures of jonathan laying down his life for his friend and how that their hearts were knit together and that he loved him as his own soul lord would you please help us to love that way love one another that way just move by your spirit in our lives set aside lord in us all the hurts and the frustrations of the past that cause us to be too reserved too drawn back through focused on self help us to give out to our own peril we commit ourselves to you we ask it for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you
