tonight if you want to turn in your Bibles we're going to open up to the The Book of Numbers 13 numbers 13 I know it's Wednesday night and I know we've had to go about our lives today and this week and it's going to continue tomorrow but I I believe we here tonight to receive something from the Lord amen let's let's try not to think of the Affairs of tomorrow or today let's just open our hearts up to him amen just been under expectation all day for for service so we're going to be jumping around a little bit for these verses we have three opening verses uh numbers 13 and verse 30 is going to be our first one and it said and Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen and we're going to turn into the Book of Matthew Matthew's gospel the 14th chapter Matthew 14 and then starting at verse 22 thanks bro all right it says uh starting at verse 22 Matthew 14 it says and straight way Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him under the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and then when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now tossed but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spoke unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered and said Lord if it be thou bid me to come on come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked down on the water to go to Jesus and when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt and when they were come into the the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God Amen and let's turn into one more portion of scripture it's the last chapter in the book of Luke Luke chap 24 Luke chapter 24 we're just going to read three verses this is the story of the two disci disciples that were on the road to Emmas this is just a portion of it that I wanted to catch Chap 24: 28-31 and they drew n The Village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to T with him and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight amen I'd like to title the service tonight what will you do amen what will you do let's just bow our hearts to pray dear heavenly father Lord Jesus we just come to you tonight father we're just under expectation to hear a word from you Lord Jesus father I lay myself aside now Lord You've see Lord you see how you've changed things in my notes and you've added and Lord God I just now I just ask that you would come and have control father have preeminence in the service Lord speak to us tonight open the Lord open the hearers to hear Lord God I pray we love you now and we commit it unto you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you this this evening as you take your seat saints of God just to set a foundation here this evening so the first one that we read there in the Book of Numbers The Numbers Chapter 13 and 14 this point in Israel's history it came time for the Israelites to spy out their land of promise amen it it to spy out the land that God had promised to them this was right after Kadesh barnea and if you remember when all these other spies gave their testimony they said that there was no way that they could possess the land they saw amen the enemy was just too great the men that they would have to fight were giants they were outnumbered they said the cities are walled and too great for them to overtake amen they saw the amalekites there amen that was the enemy that first came against them when they when they went into out of Egypt they saw the jebusites and they saw the amorites but the Bible says that Caleb stilled the people he says let us go up at once to possess it for we are well able to overcome it he but he said it in this way with haste he said let us go up at once Amen in other words we ought to make Cas with the word that God gives us amen we can't sit around and wait until the devil starts flooding us with mind battles saying that we can't do it amen we got to take the word from the Lord and attack at once amen we will overcome Saints but the other men that were with them they said they're stronger than we and I want you to notice this here their testimony wasn't wrong the Israelites were the weaker party they they didn't have the training that that the other that these enemies had you know most of them spent their lives in bondage in Egypt and God had been the one fighting all their battles for him anyway but their problem was was what they were looking at amen their testimony was now watch this in numbers 13:33 it says and there we saw giants the sons of anoch which came of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grap Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight so often times Saints I believe that the enemy gets us looking at ourselves through the wrong lens they were looking at themselves through the lens of their enemy amen through the Viewpoint of their enemy we are to look at everything that we Face amen a as a through the Viewpoint of the word that's what Caleb and Joshua said they said we will overcome amen but their eyes were on God's word not on their own abilities amen if you go back and you read the story you know the Israelites were afraid because of the testimony of the other spies that went with Caleb and Joshua remember Moses spent sent 12 12 Spies to spy out the land amen and the entire rest of the Israelites over a million Jews they listen to the testimony of the majority amen they listen to the testimony of those 10 other spies you see what the power of your testimony can do in life they were relying saints of God they were relying on 12 brave men to come back and say that we can overcome this land they were relying on the courage of those men who went out before them to say that we can do this and when two of them said that they held to the testimony of the majority amen they were relying on the wrong thing you know instead fear drove them to to keep wandering in that Wilderness out of the land of of Promise amen they held to the wrong thing in one of the most famous quotes on The Art of War it says every battle is won or lost before it's ever fought saints of God never forget that you are fighting a war we fight against principalities we fight against Powers against spiritual wickedness in high places and the prophet makes that statement to say we have a worthy adversary amen he knows how to fight he knows where to attack he knows your weaknesses and it can get you discouraged sometimes amen it matters how you prepare for battle amen preparation is crucial Churchill said it like this when Britain Was preparing for possible Nazi invasion he said we shall fight on the Seas and oceans we shall fight with confidence we shall fight with strength in the air we shall defend our Island whatever the cost may be amen we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the grounds we shall fight in the field and in the streets we shall fight in the hills and we shall Never Surrender amen saints of God to be strong and courageous because we shall Never Surrender amen we are given a promise that we will possess everything that our foot Treads upon amen we are given a promise that we will overcome by the word of Our Testimony and the blood of the Lamb that was already shed on Calvary for you amen you know we can suff suffer losses along the way you know travail may come and it may overwhelm us but glory to God Saints we shall Never Surrender am you know I think sometimes you know as as as Believers I believe we just need to have a good oldfashioned courage conference amen I believe that we need to get like they did in Acts 4 that's exactly what they needed they were discouraged at the happenings of the day amen so what did they do they got all together in one Accord in a little Wednesday night G Gathering because they were discouraged at the happenings of the day and they forgot about their trials they forgot about their their their problems they forgot about tomorrow and today and they focused on the word of God they focused how we can overcome they focused on what we need to do right now amen and what did it do the power of God shook amen I believe that the Bible is specific with things it says that the power of God shook that building amen they had a refilling of the spirit of God they had a courage conference amen and it gave them strength amen one day a few hundred years ago a man by the name of of Arnold van Winkler was was fighting with his Swiss Brothers I love when brother brandham describes this dramatizes it all hope seemed lost amen they were outnumbered 50 to one and it was it was hopeless the situation was completely hopeless but their family's lives were at stake amen Arnold van Winkler stepped out and said for and for the for the homelands something rose up in him some some type of Courage rose up in him and they asked him Arnold what will you do amen he they said what will you do he said down in the valley Yonder is a lovely little home where my wife and little children are waiting for me to come back but they'll never see me again amen for this day I shall give my life for my country and as he said that they said what will you do Arnold what will you do and he said now everyone that's got weapons come follow me and do the best that you can fight with what you've got and do everything you can with what you have got to do it with amen and he screamed and he threw up his weapon and said Make Way for Liberty and he started towards that enemy amen you know those Swiss those Swiss uh soldiers they followed right behind the courage of Arnold van Winkler their eyes were fixed on on that brave statement that he made and his courage LED them into a victory like had never been seen in Swiss history amen he said fight with what you've got do everything with what you have in your hand saints of God I'm telling you tonight fight with what you've got do everything you can with what you've got in your hands cuz we've got the word and he said you have the word and that will be what you need to possess the enemy we have the blood so that's what we need we have the word of Our Testimony so that's what we need to overcome the enemy hallelujah amen the Lord he said fight we've got our commission amen we have our weapons it's time to fight with courage Joshua the first chapter Joshua was was given a commission from the almighty God Amen some some of the most epic words in history every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that have I given to you be strong and courageous this wasn't the words of a man this was the words of God instilling confidence in a great General saying that you shall be strong and courageous you could you you can just imagine the conversation that went on between Joshua and God you be strong and courageous this wasn't that just a brave man that something rose up in him this was almighty God who knew exactly what was going to happen he gave him he gave him an assurance he gave him a confident answer that everything that you do every Everywhere You tread upon as long as your feet Treads upon it you will overcome it amen Joshua was getting to getting ready ready to fight some pretty incredible battles amen against some pretty big enemies but God had prepared him for it he instilled that confidence in him and it was all laid in his commission but saints of God until he started taking steps towards Victory he would never come into that position see Saints God places the desire in your heart amen John 6:44 says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him amen he's the one that called you he's commissioned you and he's prepared You To Tread upon everything that your foot steps on but until you pursue that desire amen until you pursue the commission that God placed in your life amen you know what desire is a desire is a strong wish or an intent it's something that God instills us a desire for more of God Amen I believe tonight we all have a desire for more of God I have a desire for more of the word not to just know the word but to know the author of the word I believe we all have that desire tonight amen but there's got to be something more it's got to go off of being a desire and it's got to be you pursuing that desire Hallelujah Matthew 22 says for many are called amen but few are chosen Joshua takes his commission and he gathers together all of his commanding officers this was just two verses after that God had commissioned him and he C and he gets together all of his officers and this time at this point in history it came time to Cross Jordan amen and he begins to give his speech of prepar preparation just like those men did bro can you grab me that water thanks uh prepare he says prepare your Provisions he tells all of his officers he says prepare your Provisions because in three days we will cross Jordan that was the command that Joshua gave to his commanding officers amen two verses after God had commissioned him amen for in three days we shall pass over this Jordan thanks and what was he doing he was echoing that command that God had given him saints of God what has pastor and the brothers been laboring so heavily they've been echoing that command from God to make ready Amen to make ready for our soon Crossing Amen to make ready for the coming of the Lord to make ready your life for God because he's coming to get his bride soon amen and he needs his wife to be ready for him to pick them up Hallelujah brother brother brother brandom says in the token believe for S and apply the token also for the family like they did in Egypt like they did at Jericho Acts 16:31 says we find out Paul told the Romans to be baptized calling on the name of the Lord him and his house could be saved by doing the same thing he says move out some people wants to apply the blood and stay in you apply the blood and you kick out all the trash of the house and have a house cleaning time he says you women take off them shorts you man throw away the cigarettes you women get all this old stuff listen to this he said get all of this old stuff out of the system here that's called the world if there was ever an umbrella of all the garbage that we needed to get out of our Lives that's the umbrella get all of the worldly systems and all of the worldliness out of of your life amen that's called the world because if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in you when listen to this catch this he says when you are ready to apply the token empty up and ready for it when you are ready to apply the token empty up and get ready for it you can't serve God and Mamon all at the same time amen he says Get rid rid of those worldly things clean up your house get rid of that worldliness in other words unclog the channels that God needs to work through in your life amen God has a channel and it's called faith and it gets clogged up by the worldliness that it goes on around us amen that statement struck my heart amen when you are ready to apply the token how many's ready to apply the token in your life how many's ready to apply it for your family's life amen so what was his next word he said empty up Hallelujah empty up and then what get ready for it Hallelujah instructions from the prophet my title for tonight what will you do amen young people what will you do has God been pursuing you in your life has he been pursuing your desires has he been convicting you to draw closer to him I know he's been doing that in all these Services he's been convicting me he's been pursuing me he's been placing a desire in me and now he's looking at us to take the desire and to run with it amen to pursue that desire glory to God but what will you do amen what will you do don't let it sit in your heart and stay a desire don't let it sit there and stay that way you pursue it you take the prophet's instructions you make ready and he says when you're ready empty up amen it's your footsteps amen sometimes I feel like you can you the maybe I just felt led to put this in here God is not the author of confusion the scripture says that 1 Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all the churches you say brother Caleb I just I just don't know he's not the author of confusion amen he's here to make things clear to you he wants to bring a a clear a Clear Vision to you amen you take God at his word and you hold on to it amen you get you get serious about those convictions and you constrain the Lord to come into your house and break the bread of Revelation to you I've been so Ren by that that little story there on the road to Emmas they they broke the bread with God but it wasn't until they constrained him amen they were walking along the path and and and God had opened the scriptures to him amen but it wasn't until they constrained him because it said he was as he was going to go as if he was going to keep on walking but Copus said no Jesus there's something different about this man I need you to come in and I need you to break the the bread of Revelation to me amen saints of God and he is willing to do that tonight for you he's willing to break the bread of Revelation and of clarity to you in your life for whatever you have need of Hallelujah do let's do more than just allow this word to bring a desire brother Jason says let it affect change in your life you know I I did a Sunday this story has just impacted my life lately brother random takes that text out of 2 Kings the thir chapter and you know the king of Edom just to set a set a stage here the king of Edom the king of Judah and the king of Israel at the time they were all together and they were seeking help against a common enemy it was the moabites they they were afraid of this enemy that he was going to conquer all three of their armies and they had an incredible need not only for winning the battle but they also had a great need for provisions and for water amen they were in the desert with their cattle and their armies and they needed those things so what did they do they inquired of the lord of the prophet in the in the land at the time Elisha you know and at first Elisha began calling them out for their years of idolatry but it was the king of Judah at the time was Jehoshaphat and he was a righteous man and honored the Lord so so Elisha sought Counsel on his behalf amen Lord the Bible says that the word of the Lord comes to the prophet amen so there's a vital importance as we catch this story don't miss this there's a vital importance in obedience to the word of the Lord just the way that he says it amen we can't emphasize that enough it's the difference espe even in a story like this but in your life it's the difference between life and death and the inquire Ed of the Lord the our Prophet inquired of the Lord and what was his command empty out the word that came from the Lord in Second Kings was make this Valley full of ditches and this entire Valley is going to be filled with water and not only will your Provisions be met but you will defeat the Army but catch the Saints there was a work for them to do there was a work for them to do they had a task at hand brother said that the main principle was to prepare for the water to come and to get the ditches dug out you see God is going to move in your life amen he is going to overcome everything that you have need of Amen he's going to provide the word he's going to provide the provisions amen but he needs you to do some digging amen he need you to start digging things out of your life amen he needs to start having you expose yourself to God expose your weaknesses expose your flaws expose those besetting things and give it to the Lord Jesus Hallelujah we've got to make ready for the water to come Matthew 7 s says ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened up unto you I want this to be so clear you can start spiritually digging in your life if there a if there is a desire there Isaiah says seek the Lord while he may be found if you just need more of God in your life pursue them if you feel like you need the Holy Ghost pursue them if you feel like you need victory in a situation pursue them amen whatever you have need of I could sit up here and list everything whatever you have need of pursue him amen Matthew Matthew's uh go goel says if a son ask bread of any of you that is that is that is a father will you give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give a fish for a serpent if he ask for an egg will he give him a scorpion if then being evil know how to give give good gifts unto your children how much more your heavenly father to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask for it how much more amen you have a little child and they come up to you ask you Oh Daddy can I have this can I have this and you want to give that to him it's the desire of your heart to do whatever it is that they need amen how much more the heavenly father that created that little child and created the emotions that were involved in that child and created you and created your emotions how much more your heavenly father wants to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you can have a constant communion with him at all times amen how much more glory to God but you see friends it's a two-fold process that takes place you see when you get a shovel and and you start digging into the ground you start running to the things that a shovel just isn't going to work against anymore but you see what you're doing is you're exposing those areas in your life that need a little bit of something stronger to dig it out amen you're you're digging and you're digging and digging I hate digging it is it is backbreaking but it it takes energy it takes something you putting something into it amen and then once you get to something that you know a shovel isn't going to handle guess what the Holy Ghost can handle it amen the Holy Ghost will come into your life into whatever situation into the hardest things into the most intricate places and he'll take the Holy Ghost machinery and he'll dig that thing out and it's not even going to just be an empty hole in your life anymore it's going to be filled now with something that you didn't even had know you needed it's going to be exceedingly abundantly more than you could have ever asked or thought amen isn't that what his word said Hallelujah Saints you start digging into areas in your life you're going to start digging into some bigger Roots we had that sermon of rooting for the Rapture our brother you know you're going to start digging into indifferences in your life towards going to church you're going to start digging into indifferences in your life towards your brothers or your sisters you're you're going to even worse you're going to start digging into ditches about your Christian walk that maybe you it's just in a stagnant place in your life indifference toward the word of God you're going to start digging into things that you won't be able to uproot on your on your own but God isn't looking for you to do all the work amen right he just needs you to surrender that thing to him and he'll do the rest you expose your weaknesses to him amen and Saints don't don't let the devil keep that thing hidden in your heart don't let Pride come in and keep you from overcoming that thing you can't hide anything from God he knows everything you have need of amen he already knows amen don't hide those things from God he'll do his part amen he just needs you to open up to him the prophet says it like this there's coming a gusher if you'll get ready for it but if you don't make ready you'll never see it I want to see it Saints he said he said lay aside everything that so easily beset you he he he says I don't do nothing and you know he's just talking with himself and he says you know maybe that's what's the matter that's the trouble of it it's more sin not to do than it is to do good and know better that's he said he that knoweth to do good and knoweth and doeth it not to him it's a sin you've got to make ready doing nothing is the worst that you can do he says we got to start digging those things out of our life amen we know the water is going to come I love that story there in in Second Kings because God uses that Supernatural means and he says but this is just a light thing in the sight of the Lord that's where that scripture comes from this is just a light thing in the sight of the Lord you know we get caught in our human understanding of things often times just like the spies did there at Kadesh barnea their natural eyes were beholding something that it it was impossible I you we can't beat all these enemies we know that they've got better equipment and and all this stuff it's it's just better but they were looking at the wrong thing our eyes look at our understanding and we start to try to measure things but God doesn't see things the way that we see him amen there isn't anything too hard for the Lord 2 Corinthians 4:18 says while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal brother random says it like this everything that's Everlasting everything that's real is unscientifically proved the whole armor of God is completely Supernatural amen love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience Faith every armor of Christianity is Supernatural that then why shouldn't we believe in the Supernatural things if the entire of the armor of the Christian faith is Supernatural we look at the SE at the Unseen not at what we see everything we see is perishable it comes from the Earth but we look at things we do not see and by faith we believe it amen in another place speaking on faith for just a moment the five senses only contact this world if you had no feeling then you couldn't feel nothing feeling wouldn't be nothing to you that would be another world if you had no sight what you look at would be another world you know nothing about it so these five senses is the only thing that God let us lose to but there is another one called Faith but by faith you walk up a ladder and finally get so high until you break into another world which is called Vision there you can see it amen just like if you'd never known what was this that you was feeling with your sense of feeling or you never seen it then your eyes come open you could see it it' all be a mystery to that person who could never see it'd be a mystery to him but yet that's it amen so so you see their faith was that they had to trust in thus sayeth the Lord from the their Prophet it was God's command dig the ditches and it seemed kind of ridiculous but they started digging and they started walking up that ladder amen until they got so high that it broke into another world which was Vision amen you know and that's what Caleb started doing he started walking up that ladder it started as simply a word from God Amen but he took God at his word and even when his eyes deceived him even when it looked impossible his Faith wasn't looking at the Natural Things amen the other men's were their their senses were looking at the natural things sometimes our natural senses can deceive us our emotions in a matter can deceive us amen but I promise that word will never fail amen I promise that word will never deceive us amen if you keep on reading God met that two-fold need with one command I just love this you know when the when the moabites started heading toward the camp the Bible says that it was morning time and that the glow of the sunshine just hit the water oh praise God there's something special about the rising of the Sun the glow off of the sun started hitting that water and the and it mixed from from the Sun to to the water and it caused a mirage the the enemy they thought that all three armies had turned on each other that they had defeated each other so they went in completely unprepared just ready to take the spoils amen they didn't they weren't prepared with their with their weapons they weren't prepared to fight they thought that they had turned against each other because they were deceived in their mind thinking that the battle had already been fought amen see sometimes saints of God the very thing that we just need to start doing in our life is the very thing that God is going to use to deceive our enemy amen it's the very thing that God need you to do just start digging just start taking my word for it just start emptying things out of your life amen I'm going to pour out the water and then when that water comes one day the resurrection morning will come and the enemy will think he had you but he didn't and he will be defeated amen hallelujah he thinks you won't survive it but in reality God is going to destroy your enemy the Bible says they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen and one day you're going to have a testimony that that you went through such and such or you did this and yes it hurt and maybe sometimes it felt like you couldn't go on maybe sometimes you felt like it was over maybe sometimes you got into a situation you feel like you couldn't cross over you couldn't overcome this thing feel like had victory in this situation Hallelujah but saints of God there's a plan in all of it it'll be the word of your testimony it'll be the word of your testimony that defeats the enemy amen God has a plan in all of it but listen Saints had they not followed the command from the prophet to dig those ditches the water would have had no place to go and the Very way that God was planning to defeat the enemy with it wouldn't have happened because they didn't take God at his word amen you've got to open up your hearts and take that step of Faith listen to this you know we can look several thousands and I made and I made some of these notes I took from my Sunday school so if you're hearing it for the second time praise God we we can look several thousand years later and and understand why it happened the way that it did amen because we have the full picture but at that time they weren't given the full picture they weren't they weren't told by God that look you got to dig these ditches because water's going to flow and then I'm going to cause the sun to rise and then the sun's going to shine on the water and it's going to cause the enemy to be deceived and then the enem is going to come in and then they're going to just destroy each other you're going to you're going to pursue your enemy because when they went into their Camp the Israel pursued them when they just needed help in defeating them they needed help in defending them God ended up turning that around and the you pursue your enemy amen they pursued their enemy glory to God God has a plan in all those things amen sometimes we're just given things at trials or tests or instructions and it sometimes it's just not a time to fully understand it but it's a time to trust amen it's a time to trust his plan amen and sometimes you're going to hit walls and barriers of unbelief amen you're going to hit walls and barriers of unbelief Mark the n9th chapter said a father came to Jesus this man had brought his son before the disciples but but they couldn't cast out the spirit amen it's a familiar story but the man brings him to Jesus and he had this approach to the Lord you know cuz you know we hit that wall of Doubt sometimes we hit that wall we just can't get past Jesus said to Jesus said to him if thou can't believe all things are possible and then Mark 9:24 says straight way the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief sometimes you get to situations in your life Lord I believe help thou my unbelief you know what he's looking for he's looking for your approach to be like that man he's looking for you to surrender that thing he's looking look at the ditch that that father dug out in his life I want my son to be healed but God I need you to be the one that does it and I have this wall of doubt in my mind amen but he raised his hands and said help thou my unbelief amen you need a victory in your life and you feel like you can't get past it you have a mind battle that you're struggling with or you just say raise my hands and say help thou my unbelief I believe I can have victory over this thing I believe that I can take the commission that God has commissioned me to do that I will possess the enemy that I will pursue him amen you take that thing you dig that ditch out of your life amen expose that thing and God will deliver you saints of God God will deliver you glory to God hallelujah I wanted to pick this up trying to tie all three vers all three opening scriptures together this this evening I wanted to pick this story up here from the gospels that we open with from our opening verses Matthew 14 Jes and in straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into the ship to go before him onto the other side while his multitudes went away and he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary amen Jesus constrained them to get into that ship we just read that they he constrained them to get into that ship amen but now this storm had risen up the wind was blowing the word says that it was contrary means inclined to to disagree or to do the opposite of what is expected or desired amen he put them in this boat they had this Supernatural experience where he fed 5,000 then then he constrained them to get this boat and they went from this mound to this Valley and now they're you know what it was God was trying to bring them to a greater place in their faith amen God was trying to rid some of their unbelief out because if you go back and you read the story there was a hardness still in their hearts amen there was something laid in there that that he had to get that Faith to walk on water out of Peter amen sometimes he constrained you to get into a situation because he knows that there's a faith laid within you to walk on water he knows because he placed that thing there amen and he put you in that ship because he wants you to constrain him he wants you to bid him to say come out on that water amen picking that story up from from Mark's gospel Mark 6:48 says I love this and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about about the Fourth Watch of the night he cometh unto them saying walking upon the sea and watch Mark's testimony of it and would have passed by them and would have passed by them sometimes Saints you can get to feeling that way you get to feeling you're in a contrary wind in your life you know we can go through trials it could be mind battles it could be anything you're in a contrary wind in your life and you feel as if God is walking by you on that boat amen and his testimony marks that he walked by him I want you to catch this I'm going to come back to that in just in just a moment but we I I was reading the the sermon and I don't have time to get into all the quotes but go this homework this week go read the fundamental foundations of Faith 1955 wonderful sermon brother brandham builds this remarkable case as to how our channels as unbelievers are all clogged up amen and he says now the thing of it is since he is restored man back to this place man in the fall had lost his conscience of what of what father put him here on Earth to do in other words all of the plumbing as it was in our brain the outlets the faith had been clogged up with business affairs with home life with domestic things it had become so clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man for catch that he he they got clogged up you get clogged up with all these things in your life but God made those channels so that he could operate his faith that he placed in you amen and you go back and you read that story they channels all those disciples on that boat their channels were all clogged up you know like I said they were they had just it was just the miracle of feeding 5,000 they were on this boat they were scared from the storm they were scared when they saw Jes Jesus thinking he was some kind of a spirit their channels were all clogged up they had a hardness in their heart and after the entire experience he jumped into the boat with him and they declared thou truly are the Son of God you see they were they were still living with some unbelief in their heart and I want you to notice something God knew that there was going to be a storm in their life he was the one who put that put them in that boat you know if you go and read if you go and look at the Sea of tiberias which was the sea they were on the Sea of Galilee come come to find out it's a 64 square mile 41,000 Acres large lake that they was on he could have walked anywhere on that water amen and though sometimes we we read where it felt like Mark said it felt like he was going to walk on by sometimes it feels like he's walking on by he purposed in his heart to walk by you just when you need it he purposed in his heart to walk by you he purposed in his heart to be walking along one day 8 miles away from where he had been resurrected on in that tomb 8 miles away at the road of emus 8 miles from that he purposed in his heart because he wanted to break the re the bread of Revelation to those men and it wasn't until they opened up their heart amen they wasn't until they constrained Jesus it wasn't until they compelled him and said Jesus I need you to come into my house some of us tonight just need to compel Jesus and constrain Jesus just come into my heart just break the bread of Revelation to me once more Lord I need more of you in my life if I don't have the Holy Ghost I need it if I don't have Victory I need it if I don't have something I need it Lord and I need you to give it to me but now I'm not going to keep on walking I'm not going to let my testimony be that that just kept on walking where I heard nice things because if you go read that story they heard some pretty nice things that day God had opened up the scriptures from Moses all the way down they had the award feast and I believe across this Pulpit we've had a word Feast but what will you do with it what are we doing with it are we pursuing God are we pursuing him more in our life are you digging those ditches out and allowing the Lord L to come in and break that bread to you Hallelujah glory to God there was a faith laid within them because God put it there there's a faith in you and I know it because God put it there you know it because God put it there you've got the desire amen now what will you do with that desire glory to God one day soon all the those experiences and all those trials all those mind battles all those things those storms those contrary winds you'll recognize that it was all for a purpose to bring that Faith to to bring that Faith to life to energize that thing Amen to unclog the channels that we get so clogged up with it doesn't have to be just trial it can be anything it can be business Affairs you get so clogged up with what got to do and this and tomorrow and I'm sure half of us that were in here when we first got in here we're thinking about what we're going to do tomorrow we're thinking about what we'll do next week what about right now what are you doing with God's word that he's breaking to you right now what are you doing with the word of the hour that he's come and he's so Faithfully put and opened and unveiled what are you doing with it right now Hallelujah he could have walked in anywhere but he didn't he walked along their path what was it Saints Peter had remembered back to the last time that they were in a boat on this very same Lake a little while earlier Peter had been fishing amen remember all night with not one fish caught he was tired he was hungry he was Peter so he's probably frustrated amen we can get that way frustrated maybe he kept casting his net he kept doing all these things that that he that he knew how to do in his own understanding but Jesus came and said cast on the other side cast your net Simon said Master we have we've toiled all night and we've taken nothing you know we get to those places Lord I've done this over and over I've raised my hands over and over I I've tried to have the victory over and over but nevertheless at Thy word Lord I'll cast my net on the other side I've done it a hundred times but I'll do it again because this time it's going to be different this time it'll be at your word Lord this time I know that whatever you say is going to change the situation in your life Hallelujah and when they had done this thing they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their their net break amen I bet their faith was just so Skyrocket high at that point oh we've toiled all night oh you've had this trial you've had this mind battle but now is the time for victory in your life amen cast the net on the other side of the boat one more time at God's word and nevertheless he will be faithful to give you what you have need of Glory to God Hall yes Lord this time it was different it was on the foundation of God's word it wasn't on the foundation of my understanding it wasn't on the foundation of what I think or or how hard I'm going to try I'm going to try and try it wasn't on that Foundation anymore he had a revelation amen and when that Revelation strikes your heart my brother my sister young people when that Revelation strikes your heart you know that you know that you know that you are hidden away in Christ glory to God hallelujah you see Peter had experienced something with Jesus that defied anything that made sense at all and in this moment of fear when Jesus was walking on the water he remember back he remembered back to those words when he caught that fish he just needed that word he just needed that word so when Peter was in the boat the second time all he needed was the same word Lord I need your word bid me to come out on that waterall oh and it wasn't trying to jump through some hoops it wasn't some complicated thing it's not complicated bid me to come and then I'll take that step of faith and I'll walk where you tell me to walk Lord Jesus I'll go where you tell me to go because God Almighty told me that I need to be in this place I asked and it was given to me I knocked and I Found Glory to God and he took that step of faith on the basis of God's word he just needed that word amen I believe we've got that word sometimes you just need that word if you don't have it pursue it if you don't have it knock and knock if you don't have it seek and you'll find if you don't have it continue to go until you have it glory to God bid me to come Saints I believe sometimes you know you might have been doing something over and over and it might you might feel exhausted like those brothers did you might feel exhausted like Peter did amen but there is Deliverance in God's word nevertheless we believe in the Supernatural things just to build a simple foundation on faith you know you love somebody you can't you can't try to explain it you can't try to try to feel it but you you know you love somebody you know when you feel Joy you know because there's just something inside of you that's happy you're just you're just glorious I know when I've got my joy I've got my joy Hallelujah you know when you when you have that in you you know when there's patience that you peace that passes understanding th those things are the supernatural things Hallelujah you know when you have that amen and it makes the difference because you can do whatever God has set for you to do amen you just need you just need to call out bid me to come Lord walk on that water you know we always we always look at that and said man Peter you lost your Faith what kind of Faith did it take to walk on that water and defy gravity and space and matter all in an instant it was a faith that God placed in Peter that he was going to know because he didn't have the Holy Ghost yet but he was building Peter to be a foundation of Faith so that he could write these books so that he could proclaim the word and he's building you in the same manner now Hallelujah he's building your faith Day by by day little by little trial by trial mind battle by mind Battle Victory by Victory amen glory to God oh Peter Lord I've done it I've done it Lord he I want you just notice you know he wanted go he wanted Jesus to know Lord I've done it I've already I've I've already done that you know I've I've kind of already done that you know I've already done that Lord but nevertheless amen oh Lord help thou my unbelief nevertheless at Thy word Lord even though you've prayed about a situation maybe maybe you felt like Peter just casted on the other side cast once more amen this is but a light thing for the Lord that's not Caleb's word that's the word from almighty God this is but a light thing for God Hallelujah you know what was it that made him start sinking was it that the circumstance changed did did the storm stop raging no did God change his mind no so what could it have been his channels got clogged up and fear crept into that place where Faith had just resided fear crept into that place amen but the word of God said I have not given you the spirit of fear but of love and of power and of a sound mind and I believe that a sound mind can be free of depression and can be free of anxiety and can be free of the fear of this world because it's in God's word so I just hold on to whatever God's word says and I take a one foot and I put it in front of the other and I'm going to B Lord bid me to come I want to walk on that water Lord I'm going to cast my net again I'm going to take that step of Faith glory to God well when Caleb and Joshua came back from Kadesh barnea you know they were looking at the same thing that those other spies were but what was it catch this the Bible says that they had a different spirit with them they were looking at it through a different lens amen Peter started out right his eyes focused on Jesus but the devil started bombarding him and overwhelming him with contrary winds fear and doubt amen and he started to sink and I believe that the enemy is going to come and try to do that and the Very that very thing in each of Our Lives amen I just I love that story on that road there God doesn't do anything by accident friends you weren't born into a family that went to a m Mage Church by an accident you you didn't stumble upon a man who gave you a tape by an accident nothing happens by accident amen 8 miles away from the tomb the Bible says three score furlongs eight miles that wasn't any accident God is Purpose Driven 41,000 squ Acres Jesus could have walked anywhere God is purposeful in what he does and as they were walking and talking oh he just they just they be he began to ask him just this man appeared out an nowhere be just begin to ask him what what are you all upset about saying sometimes Jesus just wants us wants to hear us testify amen and I just love that because they just started to go the great prophet was Among Us and he did many great things you know we believed him to be the one that was to redeem Israel but then our high priest and our and our leaders they delivered him into into the Romans to be crucified and he was killed but now this is the third day and some of our friends went to his tomb and but when they got there he wasn't there this these weren't just any old people these were people that we know and that we trust they got there and said that Jesus wasn't there they said that they had a testimony that they had a vision that that the Angels appeared and said he's not in this tomb anymore amen but he's risen from the dead so then more of our friends went to the very same place and the very same testimony came out Jesus was nowhere to be found oh my and then Jesus just begins revealing the word to him and expounding it says the the Bible says they Jesus expounded to them all that the prophets have spoken concerning himself they were fellowshipping with the very man that they were testifying of it and they didn't know amen and catch this as they drew nigh Under The Village after the after their conversation on the road to the onto emus it was as if he made as though he would have gone further that struck me he made as though he would have gone further Mark's testimony said when we where we read earlier said Jesus was walking on the water but it was as if he was going to keep on walking and now cleopas is very testimony was it it was as if Jesus was going to keep on walking but verse 29 says they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and what did he do he went in to Terry with them they compelled Jesus it it was because they had a determined Faith amen they it was more than just a desire in their hearts they pursued that desire they compelled him if you've ever been compelled you you you you no you can't leave my house I you can't come inside Abode with me me and and he gave them and it wasn't until that happened that it came to pass that he sat at meat with him that he took the bread blessed it break it and gave it to him and their eyes were open the Revelation came open to the word of God they became a part of his resurrection you are a part of his resurrection when you constrain the Lord Jesus amen Revelation struck saints of God I believe we're coming to a close I believe that this little humble Wednesday night I believe that God is here amen he's where two or three are gathered amen and I believe there's more of himself that he wants to give to us all those all all those men walking on the water saw Jesus walking on the water but Peter cried out to him pass me not I'm in the middle of my storm dear Lord and I need you because he had experienced that what if Copus had never constrained Jesus what if he let that conviction stay shut up in your hearts don't let the conviction stay shut up in your heart saints of God let's just stand to our feet this evening as the musicians would come and play that song uh pass me not if you could if you know that oh gentle savior Saints God like I said a simple thought tonight for a Wednesday night there's a difference between having a desire and pursuing that desire when was the last time that you constrained Jesus to break bread with you in your house not just hearing church not just merely talking about it oh that was a great service but really constraining him Lord I've heard your word and something stirred in my heart that's what God does at the ministering of his word something stirs in our heart now what will you do with it what will you do with the stirring of that desire in your heart constrain it wasn't until Copus constrained Jesus to come into his house that he broke the bread in just a specific manner that his eyes came open to the revelation of it that it was Jesus the Christ Hallelujah Jesus had talked with them about the scriptures you know there's something about knowing the word but knowing who wrote the word is different having that connection with with the author what will you do with what you've heard he's willing to open it up to you you know Jesus was a busy man that day he had many things that he had need to do he had many tasks at hand but two men were walking along the way thinking about Jesus talking about Jesus and they constrained him and you know what he did he didn't say no not now when I give my spirit and maybe no he went in to Su with them he went to break that bread with him just let's all just close our eyes tonight he's willing to break the bread of life to you and I believe that he wants you to walk on the water of Revelation like Peter did amen I believe he wants to break that bread of life to you but you know what Peter had to do Peter had to take the first step he had to take take the first step Hallelujah he's not too busy for you friends their testimony were as if he were to walk by Jesus is walking Among Us I believe with all my heart and he's he's willing to come in and suck with you but he just needs an invitation how many are willing to raise up your hand and invite him in to to break that bread of Revelation to you to break break you free from this thing to have you step out onto the water to have you cast your net on the other side he's willing Hallelujah constrain the Lord just for a moment constrain him those lyrics say pass me not oh gentle savior and hear my humble cry and while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by oh let me at thy Throne of Mercy find a sweet relief kneeling there in deep Contrition in in deep sincerity in deep repentance help my unbelief help thou my unbelief trusting only in thy Merit would I seek thy face heal my wounded broken Spirit oh it's all encapsulated here oh healing for the wounded victory for the Mind battle all of it is laying in the word thou the spring of all my comfort moral life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee whom in heaven but thee amen just constrain the Lord Jesus for a while Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just come before your throne Lord you've just Lord inspired My Heart Lord just these last few hours and into the day father Lord to change things and to add things Lord and I believe you did it for a purpose Lord I pray that you'd open up your word to us tonight in a new and not not a new but a fresh way Lord Jesus father come in and break the bread of Revelation to us Lord God father it will be nevertheless at Thy word oh Jesus bid me to come Lord oh I constrain you Jesus I Need You Lord I need more of you Lord father Lord every hand that was raised up Lord you see the need Lord I just pray you'd go in and meet that need Lord as we tonight Lord pursue that desire Lord Jesus Lord we take from the inspiration Lord Lord from from what your

your sword take the word and you pursue that enemy and they slaughtered all of them amen thank you Jesus Lord we love you now and we just appreciate you as we sing this song Lord as we go from these

the details of it to me God was there so many you know that just all along the way because for one I wouldn't have noticed it until I gotten back to you know where we were staying and then I wouldn't have known where I lost it but he had me notice it while we were still there you know in the park and was able to retrace our steps and we thought for sure so the walk that turned into a hike we'd gotten on one Trail and we crossed over to another Trail so we were off the trails at that time and so we had to go over a tree and so you know when I realized I didn't have my my phone and I was panicked because everything's on my phone and you know these days everything's face ID so I don't know a password and I wouldn't even know where to start and um so it just panicked me the thought of that Luther's like oh it's okay it's probably where we crossed that tree we'll just go back and get it well it wasn't where we passed the tree it was just in a ramom spot on the trail but God allowed me to notice it and I was able to find it so I want to thank God for that and then even closer to my heart than my phone um today was the day day of testing the last testing for my first grade class and it's a big deal for them and for me and praise God they all um did very were very successful in their testing I just want to thank God because that is all his doings I know that without him I
