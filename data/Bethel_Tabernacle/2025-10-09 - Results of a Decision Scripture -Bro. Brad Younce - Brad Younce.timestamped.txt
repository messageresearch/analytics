[18:47] What?
[18:48] So, Amen. Let's pray. Father, we love
[18:51] you this evening and may we become like
[18:54] a little child before you, Father.
[18:57] Innocent in heart, opening our hearts to
[18:59] you that you could just feed us and
[19:01] speak to us today.
[19:04] Lord, that we would just have no malice.
[19:07] Father, we would just have innocency by
[19:10] your grace. Lord, I thank you for your
[19:13] goodness and mercy. I thank you for that
[19:15] opportunity today. And father, I just
[19:18] pray as we gather here in your name,
[19:20] knowing that you will be in our midst
[19:22] because your word said so. We just sang
[19:25] that song, Lord, that you walk beside
[19:28] me. And Father, I may not know, I may
[19:31] not feel, I may not sense your presence
[19:34] beside me, Lord, but Father, you said
[19:37] you would never leave me nor forsake us.
[19:40] So I thank you for that, Lord. And Lord,
[19:42] we just pray as we come that you as
[19:44] spirit would have preeminence that you
[19:46] would touch each and every heart. Father
[19:49] Lord, I have a couple of special
[19:51] requests upon my heart that Father, I
[19:54] pray for them. Lord, some of stress of
[19:57] the age and some dealing with old age
[20:00] and infirmities of the flesh. Father,
[20:03] I pray that you help us this evening. I
[20:06] thank you that you're already here,
[20:07] Lord. I thank you for the blessing that
[20:10] you gave to me today.
[20:12] And I pray that you would just help us,
[20:14] Father, as we gather the tithes and
[20:17] offerings. Lord, I pray that you would
[20:19] bless the cheerful giver, magnify it to
[20:21] your kingdom. Remember those that are
[20:23] streaming and Father, as the minister
[20:26] would come to stand behind this pulpit,
[20:30] knowing that he's a man in himself,
[20:32] Father, to stand here and allow himself
[20:36] to be used, Lord, that you could speak
[20:38] through him words of life. Pray that you
[20:41] would help him this evening. Help us in
[20:43] the audience, in the congregation.
[20:45] Father, I pray in Jesus name.
[20:48] Amen.

[21:09] that he's working everything for my
[21:13] good.

[21:18] was beside
[21:21] me

[41:54] &gt;&gt; Good.
[41:56] How many's happy to be in church?
[42:01] &gt;&gt; I'm always happy to be in church.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, let's just go
[42:05] right into the word. Let's turn to
[42:06] Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 15.
[42:15] I don't claim to be a a deep preacher.
[42:19] I just here to do my part.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; So if you we get done with this, you're
[42:24] like, "Man, that wasn't very deep."
[42:26] Blame him. It's his fault.
[42:30] Deuteronomy 30:15, it says, "See, I have
[42:33] set before thee this day life and good
[42:36] and death and evil. In that I command
[42:39] thee this day to love the Lord thy God,
[42:42] to walk in his ways, to keep his
[42:44] commandments, his statutes, his
[42:47] judgments, that thou mayest live and
[42:48] multiply, and the Lord thy God shall
[42:52] bless thee in the land, whether thou
[42:53] goest to possess it. But if thine heart
[42:56] turn away, so that thou wilt not hear,
[42:59] but shalt be drawn away, and worship
[43:01] other gods, and serve them, I denounce
[43:04] unto you this day, that ye shall surely
[43:07] perish, that ye shall not prolong your
[43:10] days upon the land, whether thou passest
[43:13] over Jordan, to go to possess it. I call
[43:16] heaven and earth, to record this day
[43:18] against you, that I have set before you
[43:21] life and death, blessing and cursing.
[43:24] Therefore, choose life that both thou
[43:27] and thy seed may live. May God add a
[43:30] blessed to read. You have your seats.
[43:33] For a title,
[43:36] I want to speak on the results of a
[43:38] decision.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Results of a decision.
[43:44] I couldn't quite reach that, so I had
[43:46] him take care of it for me. Thank you,
[43:47] buddy.
[43:49] You know, life is made up of a lot of a
[43:51] lot of decisions. Every day, every
[43:54] choice we make, it has a consequence.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; I'm go ahead and admit to you, I made a
[44:00] lot of stupid mistakes.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; That I pay for.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Decision that you will you will you will
[44:07] make will determine the harvest that
[44:09] you'll reap.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you sow, we're going to reap
[44:13] it.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; We have all been forced to make
[44:16] decisions.
[44:18] There's times where we all have to say
[44:19] yes or no.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; I'm one of those kind of people that
[44:25] I don't like to tell people no when they
[44:26] ask me to do stuff, but sometimes you
[44:30] have to say no.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; I'm learning that where they people will
[44:34] wear you out.
[44:37] There's a time where we cannot be
[44:38] neutral. We can't be neutral no more.
[44:40] Amen.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that we'll be able to
[44:44] leave this church tonight in the same
[44:46] condition
[44:47] &gt;&gt; you did when you came in.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; You ought to have come into church this
[44:53] evening. You like, man, we're having
[44:54] church. Brother Tony's leading the
[44:55] singing. And then I come out.
[44:58] Oh man, I just ruined your service. I'm
[45:01] sorry.
[45:05] You'll either leave better or worse. I
[45:07] want to leave better. Right?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; It don't matter where I'm s if I'm up
[45:10] here or back there. I want to leave
[45:11] better tonight.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Spirit shall come and do his
[45:15] work among us,
[45:17] &gt;&gt; thank the Lord. Then we are forced to
[45:20] say yes or no to him.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; We cannot remain the same. So you have a
[45:24] choice tonight.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; We all have choices.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; We choose what we want to eat.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we choose the wrong thing to
[45:32] eat
[45:33] &gt;&gt; and we pay for it. You choose what you
[45:36] want to wear to church tonight. You walk
[45:37] to your closet, open your closet door.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; I want to wear that tonight. Of course,
[45:43] I pull out what I wear and I show it to
[45:45] my wife. How's this? That'll work.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; But you we chose. You chose to came to
[45:52] church. Thank God you did. Shame on you
[45:55] that don't.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; You choose what you want to wear. You
[45:59] went to your closet. You chose it. You
[46:01] could choose whether you want to go to
[46:02] work tomorrow or not. Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; You could choose whether or not you want
[46:06] to help us out at our camp.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; You That's a decision you have to live
[46:10] with.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; That was free.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; You sisters can choose to clean your
[46:17] house tomorrow or do your laundry. You
[46:19] have a choice. You get There's all kinds
[46:21] of choices that we have to make. You can
[46:23] choose where you want to go on vacation.
[46:26] There's all kinds of choices that you
[46:27] can make. There's decisions that we must
[46:29] make.
[46:32] good choices in our life. Like I said a
[46:35] few minutes ago, we have made a lot of
[46:36] bad choices. How many's with me?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; We got angels still here with us.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; You have a right to choose. Joshua says,
[46:46] "Therefore, fear the Lord
[46:48] &gt;&gt; and serve him in sincerity and in truth,
[46:51] and put away the gods which your fathers
[46:53] served on the other side of the flood
[46:55] and in Egypt and serve you the Lord."
[46:58] And if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[47:00] the Lord, Joshua was demanding a
[47:02] decision.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; I need a decision.
[47:05] They had saw God's miracles, but some of
[47:07] the people still wavered. He said,
[47:09] &gt;&gt; "Choose you this day
[47:11] &gt;&gt; whom you're going to serve, whether the
[47:14] gods which your fathers served on the
[47:15] other side of the flood, or the gods of
[47:17] the Amorites, whose land you do well.
[47:19] But as for me in my house,
[47:21] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord."
[47:23] &gt;&gt; That's what brother B says. We're living
[47:25] in a day where there's much makebelieve.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Right and wrong is trying to join
[47:30] themselves together.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; People trying to join the right and
[47:34] wrong together. It can never be done.
[47:37] One is the devil and the other one is
[47:39] God. The devil's wrong. God is right.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; It'll always be that way. The devil will
[47:46] lose and God will always win.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; So if you're on the wrong side, you're
[47:51] sure to lose.
[47:53] If you're on the right side, you're on
[47:55] God's side. You're sure to win because
[47:58] you can't lose. There's no way for us to
[48:00] lose. We're on the winning side.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; People says, "God's on my side."
[48:07] &gt;&gt; No, I'm on his side.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; I'm on his side. Was at one time we
[48:13] couldn't get to God. He was way up
[48:15] there. We couldn't get to him. But what
[48:17] he did, he came down and bridged the gap
[48:19] between earth and eternity.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now when before we couldn't
[48:24] get to God, God came down in flesh and
[48:27] became one of us.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD HE DID. WALKED THIS EARTH,
[48:31] DIED A sinner for me.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Did he for you?
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Man is now standing on the same side of
[48:41] God. If you are a gene seed of God,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; we are standing on his side. And they
[48:47] ain't no devil can take that from me.
[48:50] There ain't no devil can get in my way.
[48:52] SO WATCH OUT DEVIL. HERE WE COME.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; He's already lost.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; We have conquered every sickness, every
[49:00] disease, every devil.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; If you're on God's side,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; says, "So it'll be all right because we
[49:12] want to take sides with Jesus. And the
[49:14] only way you'll take sides with Jesus is
[49:17] taking sides on what he said.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Believe his word.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; So, let's just take sides with him.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; What happened to the thief on the cross?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; He deserved to die.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; He was just hanging there.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, he looks over at
[49:36] Jesus with another thief making fun of
[49:39] him and says, "This man's done nothing.
[49:42] We deserve to die.
[49:44] remember me, Lord.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Just in an instant,
[49:48] &gt;&gt; he chose it. Changed his destination.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; That's what our choices do tonight. They
[49:53] change our destination.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; We're given a choice, brother. I said,
[49:57] "Choice is a great thing. Your eternal
[49:59] destination is a choice.
[50:02] There'll be one time that if you turn
[50:04] God down many times, there'll be one
[50:07] last time you'll turn him down.
[50:10] There's a line between mercy and
[50:12] judgment. And it's a dangerous thing for
[50:14] a man or a woman, boy or girl, to step
[50:17] across that line for there's no return.
[50:21] When you step across that deadline, he
[50:23] called it. So tonight, it might be the
[50:26] time that many will make their decision
[50:29] where they will spend eternity.
[50:32] It's a dangerous thing to wait until the
[50:35] last hour
[50:36] &gt;&gt; because you might you might take on
[50:39] something you can never shake out of it.
[50:41] There's a time when you can be warned.
[50:43] Then if you step across that line of
[50:45] warning, then you're already marked on
[50:47] the other side. He calls it branded.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt robing off on me. I forgot
[50:56] to start my timer.
[50:59] But there is a choice we have to make.
[51:01] right or wrong to serve God or the
[51:03] devil. You can't choose both.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; You'll be like the children of Israel.
[51:09] Remember during Ahab's time where they
[51:11] halted between two opinions. You got to
[51:14] choose one side or the other.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; How many times we've come across he's
[51:18] come across this pull pit. You didn't
[51:20] have a choice to begin with. You're
[51:22] like, "Wait a minute. I have a choice."
[51:25] But you're saying I didn't.
[51:29] Your choice is based on one thing.
[51:34] You just got to recognize it.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; God knew what your choice would be.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; All right?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz God had chose you before the
[51:41] foundation of the world. So God had a
[51:44] choice. He chose you.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; That's all we got to do is recognize it.
[51:48] He chose his way because he chose us.
[51:51] That's why we chose his way because he
[51:53] chose us. That's the way the only
[51:55] decision we can make is because he chose
[51:58] you.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; That decision was already made.
[52:05] He knew what choice you would make
[52:06] before he even created this world.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Not one thing you could do about it,
[52:12] Brother Gideon.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; You didn't tell your dad you want to be
[52:16] born in that family, did you? You were
[52:17] just there. You had to be.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I didn't have you to have a choice.
[52:21] That's the same way in the kingdom of
[52:22] God. You have a choice but you don't
[52:24] have a choice.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Like what says think seriously because
[52:30] we will never be able to think anymore
[52:32] after this after this mortal life is
[52:35] over.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Your thinking is now. You cannot choose
[52:39] after this.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; You must choose now. For this day of
[52:43] choosing make your choice.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; This is choosing time. You can't stand
[52:48] neutral any longer.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may leave before this message
[52:52] is over,
[52:54] but you can you can't go out that door
[52:57] the same person you come in.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; You'll cross that threshold tonight.
[53:01] Either a better person or a more evil
[53:05] person. Help us, Lord.
[53:08] You can't help it. It's up to you to
[53:10] make a decision. It's a choosing time.
[53:15] You know, people are always picking
[53:16] sides.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; You know, in sports, you always pick
[53:19] your favorite team. Yeah,
[53:20] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a fan of that team. But what
[53:24] we got, they got they call them
[53:25] bandwagon fans. You know what they
[53:26] bandwagon fans are? A team is winning,
[53:29] they're winning everything. A lot of
[53:30] people starts going for that team.
[53:32] They're called bandwagon fans.
[53:34] But when that team starts losing, they
[53:36] jump to the next team.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; It used to be the New England Patriots.
[53:39] Now it's the Kansas City Chiefs. So they
[53:42] just jump back and forth. They don't
[53:44] know what they're doing.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Sounds like church.
[53:48] Sounds like we got a bunch of bandwagon
[53:50] Christians
[53:52] only around when time is good. When
[53:55] things are going well for you, there's
[53:57] no trials and tribulations. You're on
[53:59] the winning team.
[54:03] I don't know how these people who's not
[54:05] in Christians, how they even live,
[54:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Who they pray to
[54:10] when somebody gets sick or they need
[54:12] something, who they pray to?
[54:16] some co some some football coach, some
[54:18] football team, some Instagram,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; some phone who they pray to.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; They ain't none of these pe none of
[54:24] these people can meet your needs like
[54:26] our God can.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:34] Bandwagon Christians.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not a bandwagon Christian.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; I was chosen to this.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. I was chosen to this
[54:43] before the foundation of the world.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; There's always been two sides.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Well, we just heard a little bit over
[54:49] the weekend. Lucifer in heaven says,
[54:51] "I'm going to be like God." So, he chose
[54:52] a side. He went to the north and says,
[54:54] "And took some of the angels with him."
[54:57] &gt;&gt; But what happened to what's what
[54:58] happened to him?
[55:00] His judgment was spoken. You will be
[55:02] cast down into hell.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So, if you're on the devil's side,
[55:07] that's our end.
[55:09] Hell, hell's our end. But if you're on
[55:13] God's side, he has called you and
[55:14] ordained you for his own. Eternity has
[55:17] been given to you.
[55:20] That's what happens when you're on the
[55:21] right side. Every choice will lead to a
[55:23] result.
[55:26] And that result will tell you what what
[55:29] your heart's like. Adam and Eve had a
[55:32] choice. I know it's simple, but it's
[55:34] okay. The serpent begaled Eve and said,
[55:36] "Surely you won't die."
[55:39] But said, "It just depends on what you
[55:41] want to do. You're a free moral agent.
[55:45] You act on whatever your desire
[55:48] &gt;&gt; is to act upon."
[55:51] &gt;&gt; God has put before man. Just like in the
[55:54] Garden of Eden, the tree of life or the
[55:56] tree of death, you make your choice. I
[56:00] love this statement. Whatever your soul
[56:04] is charmed for,
[56:06] that's what you'll eat.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So, what are you charmed for tonight? I
[56:10] looked at that word charmed. I said,
[56:12] "What does that word really mean?
[56:13] Charmed." It means charmed is being
[56:16] under a magic spell.
[56:20] Are you under the spell of the world,
[56:21] the devil? Are you Are you is that your
[56:24] charm? Is that what gets you going in
[56:26] the morning? I can't wait to get up and
[56:27] put my headphones on. Nobody knows what
[56:29] I'm listening to.
[56:34] Somebody knows. Are you under the spell
[56:37] of God?
[56:39] Do you find yourself feeding on God's
[56:41] word? You find yourselves getting under
[56:43] a spell once you read what God has done
[56:46] for you. You start getting all excited.
[56:52] You know what choice Adam and Eve chose?
[56:54] You know what their result was? Sin on
[56:56] the earth. God has made God has so made
[57:00] a way that man is placed into position
[57:02] where he's forced you to make a
[57:04] decision.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; You can't just say, "I'm just going to
[57:06] sit here. I ain't going to make yes or
[57:07] no."
[57:09] God's going to force it.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; God's going to force a decision on you.
[57:12] God will force the issue to you. He must
[57:14] make some decision. And there's a time
[57:17] when you have to make a decision on
[57:18] school. You have to make a decision on
[57:19] who you'll marry. You have to make a
[57:20] decision on different things.
[57:23] Then he starts talking about Cain and
[57:24] Abel. The decision was forced upon man
[57:26] to make a decision.
[57:30] We know the story of Cain and Abel. What
[57:32] happened? Cain brought all his pretty
[57:34] little flowers to the altar. That's what
[57:36] he thought it was. It was beautiful. No
[57:38] doubt. He laid it up there and he
[57:40] thought this is what God wanted. But
[57:42] here come Abel. Abel dragging something
[57:45] to the altar. That old lamb crying and
[57:47] bleeding and hollering out and him
[57:49] dragging up there and picking up a
[57:50] throne on elder and grabbing a rock and
[57:52] beating his neck and blood squirting out
[57:53] everywhere.
[57:56] Nasty blood everywhere. Blood all over
[57:58] the altar. Blood all over Abel.
[58:01] But God loved his offering. He made the
[58:03] right choice. What did God do? The
[58:06] result of the right decision, a fire
[58:08] come down and consumed his sacrifice.
[58:12] Thank the Lord.
[58:17] His offering was accepted by God. The
[58:19] God sent fire out of heaven and consumed
[58:21] his sacrifice. And that's what happens
[58:23] today. If you're on God's side, that's
[58:26] what God wants you today. If you repent
[58:29] of being baptized and filled with the
[58:30] Holy Ghost, God wants to come down and
[58:32] just consume you.
[58:35] Moses had a choice. He had it all.
[58:39] He had the kingdom. He was going to be
[58:41] the next Pharaoh.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; But he did a lot of things that a lot of
[58:44] preachers couldn't do. Give up that
[58:47] money and popularity.
[58:51] But he did it. He had a choice. He could
[58:53] have stayed.
[58:57] Moses by choice. He was met by a pillar
[59:00] of fire. Jonah found himself in a well
[59:04] by decision that he made.
[59:07] I'm not going over there. I'm going to
[59:09] go this way. Oh, no you're not.
[59:13] Is his decision.
[59:15] Daniel, because he wasn't afraid to
[59:17] pray, God shut the mouth of the lions.
[59:19] What a decision. The Hebrew children had
[59:22] a choice. Were they going to bow or get
[59:24] thrown into the fire? What would you
[59:26] have done?
[59:28] &gt;&gt; What would you done if you was with
[59:29] Daniel with the Hebrew children that
[59:32] day?
[59:33] You're going to bow. I'm going to throw
[59:35] you this fire.
[59:37] What would you have done?
[59:39] What do you do today?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; What you do today is what you would have
[59:43] done back then.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; They made a stand. You can see through
[59:48] all through the Bible these people had
[59:49] choices.
[59:51] It come down to a showdown whether
[59:53] they're going to serve God or not. You
[59:55] can see the end. If we choose the
[59:58] disciples sides following God, we see
[59:59] what happens. We see what happens if we
[1:00:01] choose the side like Pharaoh, like the
[1:00:03] Pharisees did. We see how they ended up
[1:00:06] lost forever.
[1:00:08] What we do today is what we would have
[1:00:10] done back then. Bren says, "Identify
[1:00:12] yourself with a Bible character that you
[1:00:15] believe in.
[1:00:18] Were you believe the word was
[1:00:20] vindicated?
[1:00:22] What would you done in the days of Noah?
[1:00:25] Would you have picked up the hammer?
[1:00:29] What do you want me to hammer at Noah?
[1:00:30] Or would you been with the people
[1:00:32] laughing at him?
[1:00:35] Mercy, I'll hurry. You know, brother had
[1:00:39] a decision one time.
[1:00:41] Remember that story he talked about his
[1:00:43] daughter dying
[1:00:44] and the devil come and talking to him.
[1:00:47] He said that was the hardest, most
[1:00:48] treacherous time of my life when I
[1:00:51] raised up and looked at her.
[1:00:53] Satan was trying to tell him, "God don't
[1:00:56] love you. All the message you've
[1:00:57] preached, all this what you've done for
[1:00:59] him, he's going to let your daughter
[1:01:01] die."
[1:01:02] Reb says, "When I raised up and looked
[1:01:04] at her and I thought Satan had put it in
[1:01:06] my mind,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; now when he comes your own baby, he'll
[1:01:11] turn you down." And I said, "That's
[1:01:14] right.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; If he can't save my baby, then I can't."
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And he says, I stopped.
[1:01:22] Thank the Lord he did.
[1:01:24] I just didn't know what to do. And then
[1:01:26] I said this, "Lord, you gave her to me.
[1:01:29] You take her away. Blessed be the name
[1:01:31] of the Lord. Even if you take me, I'll
[1:01:34] still love you.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Result of a decision.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Israel one time came to a showdown. A
[1:01:41] result of a decision who was given a
[1:01:43] choice of what God they were going to
[1:01:45] serve. Ahab. Ahab was an evil man.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; What happened to him? He just made a
[1:01:54] wrong choice in life.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; He made a wrong choice in life.
[1:02:02] He went against the teaching of God's
[1:02:04] word and married an unbeliever.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hardly ever see it work out.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I'll stop there.
[1:02:14] Ahab. So he ended up marrying Jezebel.
[1:02:18] She was taught, she was raised growing
[1:02:21] up to hate God. Jehovah, everything he
[1:02:25] stood for. The way you're taught as a
[1:02:28] child is what you'll be when you're an
[1:02:29] adult.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; We know Jezebel, we know her in she fed
[1:02:35] to the dogs.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says she was scattered out
[1:02:38] everywhere. No, not even recognizable.
[1:02:41] That was a result of her decision.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Ba worship.
[1:02:47] That's who she worshiped. Her own father
[1:02:49] was named after him. Lbel
[1:02:54] was his name. He was named after his
[1:02:57] God.
[1:02:59] Thank God I'm named after my God
[1:03:01] tonight. I'm Mrs. Jesus Christ. That's
[1:03:04] who I serve. That's my choice.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God, you'll have
[1:03:08] his name.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; When things couldn't possibly get any
[1:03:13] worse,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; God got fed up with it.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; He got fed up with He sent a man out of
[1:03:19] the wilderness. First time we ever heard
[1:03:21] of Elijah.
[1:03:22] He walks up to the up to the king Ahab
[1:03:25] says, "There'll be no rain or doodle." I
[1:03:27] call for it. Turn around. Walks back
[1:03:28] out.
[1:03:31] We need more preachers like that.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Preachers that get up here with it's got
[1:03:36] a backbone. It's not wishy-washy. They
[1:03:39] ain't afraid to preach the gospel.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, let it be me.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He just showed up on the scene with a
[1:03:47] warning from God.
[1:03:50] There'll be no rain or doodle. I call
[1:03:51] for it.
[1:03:53] It was right at him. Cuz Bale was a god
[1:03:56] of the weather. Oh, it'd be all right.
[1:04:00] We don't believe this. One year, two
[1:04:03] year, three year,
[1:04:06] no rain.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; They finally got they finally realized
[1:04:11] something happened.
[1:04:15] God got so tired of their sins, he said,
[1:04:16] "Okay.
[1:04:18] Okay, Elijah, it's time. They've got to
[1:04:22] make a decision."
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to go back to Ahab and
[1:04:27] you be call showdown.
[1:04:30] First Kings 18:17.
[1:04:33] That's what he said. When Ahab saw
[1:04:35] Elijah, Ahab said, "Art thou he that
[1:04:37] troubleth Israel?"
[1:04:42] He said, "I haven't troubled Israel, but
[1:04:44] thou in thy father's house has,
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; cuz you have forsaken the commandments
[1:04:48] of God, and follow Baal."
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Now therefore, send and gather to me all
[1:04:53] of Israel unto Mount Carmel. Get all the
[1:04:58] prophets of Baal, all 450 of them, and
[1:05:00] all the prophets of the grove, all 400
[1:05:02] which eat at Jezebel's table.
[1:05:05] So Elijah told A had sent for all the
[1:05:07] people and bring them all up here.
[1:05:10] It's time.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And Elijah came unto THE PEOPLE.
[1:05:16] HOW LONG HALT YE BETWEEN two opinions?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Halt
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; to hop about to limp.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Don't know where they're going.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Don't know what they're going to become
[1:05:31] lame and leap. And what are we going to
[1:05:33] do? And we don't know if that the
[1:05:34] message is right or the message is
[1:05:36] wrong. Was brother Brown a false
[1:05:37] prophet? Was he true? Should we listen
[1:05:39] to tapes or should we have preachers?
[1:05:41] Halt. Halt between two opinions.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; They couldn't make up their minds who
[1:05:47] they're going to serve. They serve Bale
[1:05:49] when it's convenient. Serve God when
[1:05:51] it's convenient.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; That's what we do sometimes. If things
[1:05:55] go wrong, we That's when we get ON OUR
[1:05:57] KNEES. OH, GOD HELP ME, LORD.
[1:06:02] WOW.
[1:06:05] There's too many fence sitters in
[1:06:06] Christianity.
[1:06:13] So Elijah came and said, "You cannot
[1:06:14] falter between two opinions anymore.
[1:06:17] You're double-minded.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; You're either going to serve one or you
[1:06:21] going to serve the other."
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Now, Baal was a god of thunder.
[1:06:28] He was also the god of fertility. So
[1:06:30] Elijah says to these people, "Look,
[1:06:33] we've had a drought here for three and a
[1:06:35] half years.
[1:06:36] If Bale is God, why haven't you had any
[1:06:39] rain?"
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; He's already started making fun of him.
[1:06:43] He ain't started yet.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; How long is it going to take you to see
[1:06:48] this that this is a judgment by Jehovah
[1:06:52] upon the land?
[1:06:55] Look, make a decision. It's either one
[1:06:57] or the other.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; There's only two choices.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; The devil is fighting you as hard as he
[1:07:04] can.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; It ain't only old people.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; We fight the devil. It's these young
[1:07:11] people.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; They're getting blasted from every side.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; It's tougher on them. It was when we
[1:07:20] were young, brother Steve.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; It's so easy right here.
[1:07:28] You know what I mean? Elijah said to the
[1:07:30] people, "I even I only remain a prophet
[1:07:35] of the Lord."
[1:07:37] But Baal's prophets are 450 men.
[1:07:40] Let them therefore give us two bulocks
[1:07:43] and let them choose one bullet for
[1:07:44] themselves and cut it into pieces and
[1:07:47] lay it on wood and put no fire under it.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; And I would do the same. Yeah,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I like the way why he said why did he
[1:07:56] say that? Put no fire under the altar. I
[1:07:59] I I was trying to find it this
[1:08:01] afternoon. I could I read it somewhere
[1:08:03] that the prophet the pro the priests of
[1:08:06] Baal would get under the altar and they
[1:08:09] would light the fire under the altar.
[1:08:12] So Elijah says, "Uh-uh, no, you're not
[1:08:15] going under there. No fire for you."
[1:08:20] He says, "And call ye upon the name of
[1:08:22] your gods.
[1:08:25] Go ahead and call on your two so God. Go
[1:08:28] ahead and call on your three gods. Go
[1:08:30] ahead and call
[1:08:34] and I will call on the name of the Lord.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And the God that'll answer by fire, let
[1:08:40] him be God.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And the people answered
[1:08:46] and said, "It's well spoken."
[1:08:51] And Elijah said to the prophets of Bale
[1:08:54] again, "Choose you one bak for yourself
[1:08:56] and dress it first, for ye are many, and
[1:09:00] call on the name of your gods, but put
[1:09:02] no fire under it." Prophel thought this
[1:09:05] this is going to be easy.
[1:09:08] This is going to be good.
[1:09:11] This is going to be a sure thing.
[1:09:14] That's what they thought about people
[1:09:15] leave this message. This is a sure
[1:09:17] thing. There's gonna be a mass exodus.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Were they?
[1:09:23] I don't recall seeing a mass exodus.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Did you, brother Jason? Just one or two,
[1:09:27] three here,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; four there.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Wasn't like not like they thought.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And they took the bullet that was given
[1:09:33] them, addressed it, and called on the
[1:09:35] name of Bell from morning until noon.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; OH, BALE, HEAR US.
[1:09:43] There was no voice. And they leaped up
[1:09:46] on the altar.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; When was the last time you leaped on the
[1:09:53] altar? Praising the Lord.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; They they put most of us ashamed.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; They worship a God's not real. We
[1:09:59] worship a God. It's real. We just hear
[1:10:00] it like this.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. 805. How much long is he
[1:10:04] going to preach?
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Oops.
[1:10:10] And they cried aloud
[1:10:13] and cut themselves with knives
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; till the BLOOD GUSHED OUT.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. MAYBE HE'S SLEEPING. HE MIGHT
[1:10:22] BE DOWN THERE IN DISNEY WORLD SOMEWHERE.
[1:10:25] HE MIGHT BE AT THE BEACH.
[1:10:32] You know, I can I can see the devil.
[1:10:33] He's probably down in hell having a good
[1:10:35] time.
[1:10:36] He probably had him a big large Little
[1:10:39] Caesar's pizza and a Dr. Pepper. He'd
[1:10:41] probably sitting there enjoying himself.
[1:10:47] I had that for lunch today. Sorry. He
[1:10:50] They were having a good old time. He
[1:10:52] knows this message was right.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; He know who Elijah was. He knew who God
[1:10:57] was.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; The devils believed this message and
[1:10:59] they tremble.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; He's just watching people leave.
[1:11:06] that they if they don't get their lives
[1:11:07] straight with God, they're lost going to
[1:11:09] hell. He just let laughing as the
[1:11:12] people's leaving the message. Oh, we're
[1:11:14] all free. They say, "We can cut our
[1:11:17] hair. We can put on our pants. We can
[1:11:18] put on our shorts. We can let our hair
[1:11:20] grow out, guys.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; They're free."
[1:11:25] Devil's laughing.
[1:11:31] And Elijah said unto the people,
[1:11:34] "Okay, I've had enough of this. Come
[1:11:36] near to me.
[1:11:38] Come near to me." And he repaired the
[1:11:41] altar of the Lord that was broken down.
[1:11:43] He said, "I've got to repair this. I got
[1:11:45] to repair this word. I've got to take
[1:11:48] this take us back to the faith of our
[1:11:50] fathers."
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; So Elijah picked up one stone. Faith is
[1:11:56] a substance.
[1:11:58] He picks up another stone, the hidden
[1:12:00] life with Christ. He picks up another
[1:12:03] glory. My redeemer liveth. He started
[1:12:07] building the altar back. He got down to
[1:12:09] the church ages. He got down to the
[1:12:10] seven seals. He got down. What house
[1:12:12] will you build me? He got down to the
[1:12:14] rapture
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and he built the altar.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Now it's time to turn our hearts to back
[1:12:20] to the father.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; We need to make a right choice tonight.
[1:12:26] We need to start rebuilding our altar.
[1:12:28] We need to start rebuilding our altar
[1:12:30] back at home.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Brother was said to turn our hearts back
[1:12:34] to the father. What would you have done
[1:12:35] that day?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; What side would you have chosen? And
[1:12:41] Elijah took the 12 stones according to
[1:12:43] the number of tribes of the sons of
[1:12:44] Jacob unto the whom the word of the Lord
[1:12:47] came and said, Israel shall be thy name.
[1:12:52] And around those stones he built a
[1:12:53] trench.
[1:12:56] Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; About the altar
[1:13:01] and he put wood on the altar. He cut the
[1:13:03] bulk in pieces and laid laid it on the
[1:13:05] wood. Filled four barrels with water.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Poured it on the burnt sacrifice
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; and the wood. Go do it again. Here they
[1:13:13] come a second time. Say, "Go do it
[1:13:15] again." Here they come a third time. 12
[1:13:17] barrels of water.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Wow. Filled the ditch. He wanted to show
[1:13:24] that there was no fire under that altar.
[1:13:27] If there's fire in his that water would
[1:13:28] have put it out.
[1:13:31] When fire did fall, it was going to be
[1:13:33] supernatural.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass at the time of the
[1:13:38] offering of the evening sacrifice.
[1:13:40] Who knows? It could have been a
[1:13:41] Wednesday night. Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; At 7:00,
[1:13:47] at the time of the evening of sacrifice,
[1:13:50] Elijah the prophet came near
[1:13:53] and said, "Lord God of Abraham,
[1:13:57] Isaac, and of Israel."
[1:14:00] He didn't say Jacob.
[1:14:03] Jacob had a name change. of Israel. Let
[1:14:06] it be known this day THAT THOU ART GOD
[1:14:09] in Israel, that I am thy servant, that I
[1:14:13] have done all these things at thy word.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; What took the pro the prophets of Ba all
[1:14:21] day
[1:14:23] to try to get the fire to fall,
[1:14:26] but it wasn't for them.
[1:14:29] They weren't ordained for this Holy
[1:14:30] Ghost fire.
[1:14:33] All they could do is just feel it.
[1:14:36] They having all kinds of emotions,
[1:14:37] jumping around, screaming,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; speaking in their tongues,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; they had a feeling, but no fire.
[1:14:51] Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me.
[1:14:56] that these people may know that thou art
[1:14:59] Lord God and thou hast turned our heart
[1:15:02] back again.
[1:15:05] I can imagine him just praying this. He
[1:15:08] wasn't screaming it.
[1:15:11] Lord, we're just going to we're just
[1:15:13] going to show the people right now.
[1:15:17] He said, "Thou has turned our heart
[1:15:18] back." back and said, "No sooner than he
[1:15:20] ended that prayer, there was a sound
[1:15:23] from heaven like a rushing mighty wind
[1:15:27] and the fire fell and consumed that
[1:15:30] sacrifice."
[1:15:33] What was amazing, not only the
[1:15:34] sacrifice, it consumed the altar, the
[1:15:37] wood, the water. It was dry ground when
[1:15:40] they got done with it. The the fire of
[1:15:42] the Lord fell consumed the burnt
[1:15:44] sacrifice.
[1:15:46] It ate it up. It consumed it. It burned
[1:15:49] it up. It devoured it. Lord, I want the
[1:15:52] Holy Ghost to come and DEVOUR ME
[1:15:54] TONIGHT.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; EAT ALL OF ME, LORD.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; That sacrifice was consumed. That's the
[1:16:01] way our life was or is. We need to be so
[1:16:05] consumed by the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:07] that there's no more me.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank the Lord. We're totally gone.
[1:16:13] Totally filled up with the God's power.
[1:16:15] Our lives are so in tune with God till
[1:16:19] the devil don't even know what to do
[1:16:20] with you.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's a choice I want to make.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And when the people saw it, they fell on
[1:16:27] their face. They said, "Hold on a
[1:16:29] minute. We've seen this before or heard
[1:16:30] it done before."
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Remember in Leviticus, we got time to go
[1:16:34] there. They fell on their faces and THEY
[1:16:37] SAID, "THE LORD GOD, HE IS GOD.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; THE LORD, HE IS the God."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen one day when the
[1:16:49] rapture takes place?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; The people been playing church
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; is going to come in here and
[1:16:56] where's everybody at?
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; What happened? It's Sunday 11:10. Tony's
[1:17:02] should be starting to lead the singing.
[1:17:04] Where's he at?
[1:17:06] Where's everybody at?
[1:17:09] Realize you've missed it.
[1:17:12] That's when you'll BE SCREAMING OUT. OH
[1:17:14] LORD, THIS MESSAGE WAS RIGHT. THE LORD,
[1:17:17] HE IS GOD.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; LORD, I say, Lord, let the fire fall on
[1:17:23] us tonight.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Let it consume our very beings.
[1:17:29] That same pillar of fire at the
[1:17:31] beginning, the same pillar of of cloud
[1:17:34] in that burning bush, the same pillar of
[1:17:35] fire that led to Israel 40 years, the
[1:17:38] same one that fell on the day of
[1:17:39] Pentecost that filled 120 of them is the
[1:17:42] same one that's here tonight.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; We've been in meetings where the pillar
[1:17:47] of fire was seen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; W people witnessed it.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; I've never seen them, but I sure have
[1:17:52] felt a thing.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; You talk about a reverence, a power. You
[1:17:57] could feel the power.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; There's coming a showdown.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; We're gonna take a rapture.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; While the defectors of the message and
[1:18:11] the denominations can't find you no
[1:18:13] more. We're going to be up there cuz
[1:18:15] we're already married. We're going to go
[1:18:17] up to the wedding supper of the lamb.
[1:18:19] Three and a half years.
[1:18:25] him coming through our wiping the tears
[1:18:27] from our eyes. Don't worry.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; You've made it.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE YOU'VE made it. Your choice.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; You've got it. YOU'VE MADE YOUR ETERNAL
[1:18:38] DESTINATION RIGHT NOW.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; WHY? Your decision that you have made.
[1:18:45] Hallelujah.
[1:18:53] I'm gonna stop right there. Let's all
[1:18:54] stand.
[1:19:01] Let's bow our heads. Musicians Tony
[1:19:04] come.
[1:19:10] Now, I think I said this before
[1:19:13] about straddling the fence
[1:19:16] where this man was straddling the fence
[1:19:17] and
[1:19:21] The angel kept trying to get him to come
[1:19:22] over on their side, on God's side. And
[1:19:25] the devil wasn't saying nothing.
[1:19:29] And God was saying, "Come on. Come on my
[1:19:31] side. Get get over here. Get off that
[1:19:33] fence." The devil wasn't saying nothing.
[1:19:34] He finally asked the devil, says, "Why
[1:19:37] aren't you trying to get me on your
[1:19:38] side?" The devil says, "The fence
[1:19:40] belongs to me.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The fence is mine."
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; So straddling a fence is not a neutral
[1:19:46] position.
[1:19:49] and you're sitting on the devil's
[1:19:50] property.
[1:19:52] Jesus says, "He that's not with me is
[1:19:54] against me."
[1:19:56] To get on the right side, please have
[1:19:59] eyes closed.
[1:20:02] To get on the right side, we've got to
[1:20:04] have that fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:08] on your soul. A fire that'll keep you
[1:20:11] from stay help you stay away from the
[1:20:13] world.
[1:20:15] But we got to choose tonight.
[1:20:18] Is it God or is it rock and roll?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Is it God or some country love song?
[1:20:26] Is it God or world's fashion?
[1:20:30] Is it God or your video games?
[1:20:33] Is it God or your television?
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:38] Is it God or your sports?
[1:20:41] Is it God or your sickness?
[1:20:44] Is it God or your defeat or the victory?
[1:20:48] You got to choose.
[1:20:50] It's either God or Satan.
[1:20:53] We all have a choice.
[1:20:57] You say, "But I have the Holy Ghost."
[1:21:00] Yeah.
[1:21:02] What are you doing with it?
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Do you get up in the morning
[1:21:09] and go for your cup of coffee and
[1:21:12] you don't pick up your Bible?
[1:21:16] A lot of our prayer time is just when we
[1:21:18] lay down at night and go to sleep.
[1:21:21] Lord, forgive me my sins. Lord, be with
[1:21:22] me tomorrow. Amen.
[1:21:25] That's all we got to give God.
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:29] This is for every person.
[1:21:32] Myself included. I have my hand raised
[1:21:35] tonight.
[1:21:37] Lord, forgive me. Forgive me for the
[1:21:40] choices that I have made.
[1:21:42] I'm human. Lord,
[1:21:45] I still make some some bad mistakes,
[1:21:48] God, I have to pay for. But Lord,
[1:21:51] I thankful my choice has always been
[1:21:52] you.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; No matter what this flesh body throws at
[1:21:57] me, my choice is in you, God.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I choose you. How many would raise your
[1:22:03] hands and say, "God, I choose you
[1:22:04] tonight,
[1:22:06] Lord, over everything that the devil
[1:22:08] gives us, he'll make it look beautiful.
[1:22:10] He'll make it make it look easy, but
[1:22:13] God, I choose you tonight. I want you,
[1:22:15] God. Lord, forgive me for not giving you
[1:22:18] a 100% of myself.
[1:22:21] Lord, you see your people tonight, God.
[1:22:24] Lord, we stand here tonight needy.
[1:22:28] We need you, Father, to come on the
[1:22:30] scene. Our hands is raised, Lord. Mine's
[1:22:33] up, too, Father. Both of them.
[1:22:37] My choice is you.
[1:22:40] Father, I placed this service in your
[1:22:41] hands. Lord, I feel like it was a mess,
[1:22:44] but Lord, you could take a mess and make
[1:22:47] a message out of it.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Father, may I be a blessing to somebody,
[1:22:51] Father.
[1:22:53] Lord, we thank you in Jesus name.

[1:25:11] We have a testimony from Brother Bruce
[1:25:13] Paris. He said, "I have a testimony
[1:25:16] regarding a my cataract situation.
[1:25:19] Yesterday I had my second successful
[1:25:21] surgery done with a follow-up this
[1:25:23] afternoon and I'm so thankful for God's
[1:25:25] great mercy providing the skilled
[1:25:27] surgeon with the expertise to implant
[1:25:29] two toric lenses in my eyes returning my
[1:25:32] vision to 2020. Amen. Thank the Lord for
[1:25:35] that.
[1:25:37] We believe God can move on any request.
[1:25:40] Let's we want to remember brother Matt.
[1:25:42] He'll be ministering in Louisiana this
[1:25:45] weekend at brother Tim's meetings. We
[1:25:48] want to pray for him and the other
[1:25:49] brothers that are there
[1:25:51] that they'll have some outstanding
[1:25:53] services. We want to continue to pray
[1:25:54] for our camp coming up.
[1:25:57] How many's been praying for it already?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Believe God's going to move.
[1:26:05] We had a we had a probably one of the
[1:26:07] best years last year we've had.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Got a lot of pressure. Lord's got a lot
[1:26:12] of pressure on him this year.
[1:26:14] Make this even greater. How many has an
[1:26:16] unspoken request? Raise your hands.
[1:26:20] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:26:23] Lord, first we want to remember the
[1:26:26] meetings at Brother Tims this weekend.
[1:26:29] Father, may you be with Brother Matt and
[1:26:30] the other ministers that's there,
[1:26:31] Father.
[1:26:33] Lord, those meetings have been some
[1:26:35] great ones in the past. We've been
[1:26:36] there, Father.
[1:26:38] Lord, they they're expecting a move from
[1:26:40] you, Lord. You know who's going to be
[1:26:42] there, Father. I pray may you move upon
[1:26:44] the ministry upon the people.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Father, may you help them, Father. Yes,
[1:26:48] sir.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're praying for our camp, Lord,
[1:26:50] that you'll just come and move in your
[1:26:53] special way that you always do, Father.
[1:26:56] Lord, we're expecting great things from
[1:26:58] this camp, Lord. Be with the the
[1:27:00] ministry that's coming, Father. Be with
[1:27:02] the kids that's coming, Lord. Be with
[1:27:03] the staff and the the leadership, Lord.
[1:27:06] Lord, that we can do your perfect divine
[1:27:07] will, Father. It's not this is not for
[1:27:10] us, God. It's for your young people,
[1:27:12] Father. for you to move for them.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Father, in the hand that was raised,
[1:27:17] Lord, you see every need behind those
[1:27:19] hands.
[1:27:21] Father, may you move upon that heart. No
[1:27:23] matter what it is, God, we believe you
[1:27:25] can move. Father, again, we thank you
[1:27:27] for this service, Lord. We place this
[1:27:30] service into your hands, Lord. It's
[1:27:31] going down into your books, Father.
[1:27:34] Lord, we just thank you in Jesus name.
[1:27:36] Amen. Sing it one more time, brother
[1:27:38] Tony.
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:44] There has never
[1:27:47] been a day
[1:27:50] like this day
[1:27:53] to me.
[1:27:55] There has never
[1:27:58] been a day
[1:28:01] like this day. I see.
[1:28:06] There has never
[1:28:08] been a light
[1:28:11] that shines
[1:28:13] so bright
[1:28:16] as this day,
[1:28:19] this glorious
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:22] day.
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Anybody have any testimonies?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord. Sister Debbie
[1:28:34] went to her third visit to the
[1:28:36] orthopedic doctor and three for three.
[1:28:39] They said, "Miss Watkins, we all your
[1:28:42] scans are great. You're great. You maybe
[1:28:44] got a pinched nerve and uh so nothing
[1:28:47] serious apparently and just some rest."
[1:28:49] And I'm thankful the Lord is already
[1:28:52] she's already beginning to recover.
[1:28:54] Amen. Amen. Just some some light um
[1:28:57] physical therapy, mostly walking and uh
[1:29:00] that's doing the trick. So just want to
[1:29:02] trust the Lord for the rest of it. Camp
[1:29:04] was looking pretty impossible for her
[1:29:06] really. Um so but at least um the Lord
[1:29:09] is coming on the scene now. So I'm glad
[1:29:11] for that.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Um I met a man in Fairbanks, Alaska this
[1:29:21] last weekend and um he found our church
[1:29:26] I think it's about been about a year
[1:29:28] ago. He's was in Mento. It's like a
[1:29:31] village north I think of Fairbanks,
[1:29:33] whatever. But um he God was dealing with
[1:29:36] him. I think he grew up in the message.
[1:29:38] But um and then he just like I I believe
[1:29:43] like did a search on YouTube for a
[1:29:45] message church and came across this
[1:29:47] church.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And so he was like excited. He knows all
[1:29:50] you guys. He's like, "Oh, Steve." Yeah.
[1:29:52] And I'm like, "That's my husband." But
[1:29:54] um that's coming up on his year. So he's
[1:29:57] that God dealt with him. I think he said
[1:29:59] October 10th or something like that, but
[1:30:01] it was just it was random. Not random,
[1:30:04] but it was just really cool. And um he's
[1:30:06] streaming, so
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. God bless you.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Anybody else?
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I wanted to thank the Lord for
[1:30:22] protecting me and um my my three dogs. I
[1:30:26] um a lot of you may not know or may know
[1:30:29] I'm I'm on heart medication. I have to
[1:30:31] take one pill at night and one pill in
[1:30:32] the morning. And the pill when I take it
[1:30:35] at night, I lay the next one out on a
[1:30:37] little box on my nightstand to take the
[1:30:39] next morning. And the next morning I got
[1:30:42] up and somehow I forgot to take it. I
[1:30:44] got busy through the day. By the time I
[1:30:46] realized it, it was 1:30 in the
[1:30:47] afternoon and I thought I can't take it
[1:30:49] now because it'll be too close to the
[1:30:51] next dose. And so I just left it laying
[1:30:53] on the box. Later on that evening when I
[1:30:56] got ready to take my medication, I
[1:30:58] couldn't find the pill that was on the
[1:30:59] box. And I had remembered inside the box
[1:31:02] I keep my watch and I had lifted the box
[1:31:04] to get my watch out because I was in a
[1:31:06] hurry to get to an appointment. We
[1:31:08] couldn't find the pill anywhere. And
[1:31:11] then I thought, did I just take it and
[1:31:13] not realize I took two pills? Did I drop
[1:31:15] it and the dogs got it? It would have
[1:31:17] been fatal if the dogs had gotten it.
[1:31:19] And it would have been very bad for me
[1:31:20] if I had taken a double dose like that.
[1:31:23] And I was so upset. And so we got in the
[1:31:26] bed and we prayed and asked the Lord to
[1:31:28] protect me and the dogs. And everything
[1:31:31] was fine. Everybody got up the next
[1:31:33] morning. The dogs were still alive. I
[1:31:36] was still alive. Everything was fine.
[1:31:38] And I still have not found that pill.
[1:31:41] And so the Lord just took care of it
[1:31:43] wherever it went. Amen. Thank the Lord.
[1:31:49] Anybody else?
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:55] So, we need to remember we'll be loading
