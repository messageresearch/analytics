to heaven and then she met jesus and jesus opened his arms up to her and he smiled at her and said you have done well please come in and uh that's what that's what we all are looking for that day is

[Music] foreign [Music] yes [Music] wow i believe that the evening time is near it's here amen it's nearer than near it's here amen praise the lord we're deep into it well into it amen so we're looking for our third exodus amen that should be the greatest desire of our entire life and that should occupy the forefront of our mind at all time i'll tell you something friends there's there's nothing i wouldn't miss heaven for the world no way shape or form that uh it it should be the greatest it will be the greatest achievement should be the greatest goal that you ever set is to make heaven your home amen we're going to invite you to jeremiah chapter 3 this evening appreciate all the music and singing amen i enjoyed that song brother travis sister josie that was awesome sister that was quite a dream i heard about wow praise the lord so we want to look tonight and i'm i'm not titling any in my title i'm not attaching to sunday's thought but i do want to kind of launch from a certain spot that we just mentioned in on sunday but tonight i want to take a text from jeremiah chapter 3 and i want to speak tonight on a burden the lord put on my heart called in the lord's defense now i want to make just a disclaimer and it's it's just kind of silly that i have to but i feel like i need to because just taking that title you might well imagine and you it would be normal to imagine that i'm probably gonna you know defend the message against all these defectors and nonsense that's not even in my mind and i'm not even going anywhere near that and uh because i don't need to the this message doesn't need defending amen god has proven it so overwhelmingly and we made some comments sunday and i stand by them and uh but tonight i i have a completely different burden on my heart i'm thinking of a more global approach to the world that has spurned the lord and has you know brother branham in a number of places preached a message called the trial in fact is it was in birmingham one of the places he preached that where my mom and dad were and that's where my dad went to the prayer line and i was healed hundreds of miles away instantly of an incurable illness and so you know brother branham felt the need several times to take up the cause of defending the lord to to against a world that was you know not they weren't being fair to god and worse than that they were outright false accusing god and it wasn't the first time in history in the scriptures even israel got caught up in that and you know they they were under harsh trials and really all it was was the tender hand of jehovah correcting their lives amen the lord does that you know and we we should be happy because it means he loves us and uh and they you know they they just they couldn't reconcile all of the misfortune that was happening to them and they they they accused god to the prophet that he wasn't being fair and you know the prophet takes that message to the lord and the lord sends back a message said you go back and tell them you you say i'm not fair i'm not equitable that i'm not just i'm actually saying that you're the ones who aren't just and fair and equitable i you know i've been over and overwhelmingly gracious and merciful to you and you're the ones who constantly do me wrong amen and so you know it's it's mankind has is always doing that and so the lord put a burden on my heart tonight and i want to take it up and it's gonna be a little bit of a strange angle to approach it from so you just bear with me will you do it amen in jeremiah chapter 3 we're going to pick up from verse 6 and i'm going to read 6-13 the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king has thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she has gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also isn't that astonishing and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that she defiled the land and committed adultery with with stones and with stocks and yet for all her treacherous sister judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart but but feigningly saith the lord so you know she she feigned a repentance it wasn't really genuine it wasn't wholehearted it was kind of a half measure and the lord said unto me the backsliding israel hath justified herself more than treacherous judah go and proclaim these words toward the north this is to israel and say return thou backsliding israel saith the lord and i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i will not keep anger forever only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou has transgressed against the lord thy god and has scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the lord he goes on and on eternal backsliding children goes on and on and on and um let's pray father i stand here tonight lord with the word open before me and a and a very simple burden on my heart and how to express it that's always lord what we must depend on you for now master i i ask you for your help lord because i this has meant a lot to me and i i know that it will mean a great deal to the rest of your family if i can just get myself out of the way lord and just let you be the preacher tonight may you grant that to me father we humble ourselves before your presence and ask this of thee humbly in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated when i read jeremiah 3 this passage here verses 6 through 13. it it it leaves me amazed that anyone could read about a being this merciful and then accuse him of somehow not being you know uh fair or equitable or reasonable uh you know that that you could read this that here here is the the offended one you know humanity is always getting offended at god and uh you know this is if you just would think for a second how upside down that is that god builds life builds a world builds a universe builds it all perfect puts perfect atmospheres nature perfect people perfect everything and man comes in and ruins it all and then turns around and says you know god you know we hate him you know we he he's not good we don't want to serve him we don't like god and and the whole world in mass overwhelmingly an overwhelming majority down through history has always chosen everything but god and you know and and then people somehow have this idea in their mind that i ought to be able to live my life how i want to and yet you didn't give yourself life you can't keep your life you can't keep the breath in your lungs if god doesn't do it you're you've got maybe however long you can hold your breath to live all right so if god just come down in this building and said right now okay i'm done i'm taking everybody's breath however long you can hold your breath that's how long you have to live in the earth and so you know you you have to realize that everything that is made was made by him and for him and you know it's it's all for his purposes and his accomplishments and somehow man rises up as if god owes him something and really the long and short of it is is that god set man in the world with eternal life man gave it away and then god comes down and says okay i'll tell you what i'll clean up your mess and save you and mankind still hate him amen amen and they constantly i'm a little hot in the monitors brother man they constantly uh you know resist his guidance and even though his way uh leads to life even though he's the only source of life he's the only one who can save you and if he doesn't save you you're finished you're doomed so you know it it it becomes a situation where you say wow how how is it that mankind can possibly take this path and you hear it all the time you hear people mock god on a regular basis and all fear of god is gone from the earth today yeah amen now it was supposed to be that way because that's how it was in the days of noah that his all across the earth his mind the mind of man was evil continually and that every imagination that he had was evil to to the degree that it repented god that he had even made man and so you know god came down in this amazing act of mercy for the righteous and said i tell you what i'm just gonna i'm gonna get rid of all the evil and you know something friends you say wow that was that was pretty tragic but at the same time i can imagine noah with his righteous spirit and his righteous ideas and his love for god's righteousness and his family you know as sad as it was to see everybody perish they had a chance and you know there had to be some satisfaction for noah to as tragic as it was to step out in a world and go whoo we get to start over man no more wickedness no more evil and then of course we know that it it didn't take no time it didn't take no time but by the time noah's son shem has passed away he's the last one mankind is already corrupting himself again in the in shinar and building a tower and you know at the tower brother branham shows how that they built the tower so as so that that if god ever decided to come after him again with the flood we'll just run up in the tower so don't worry y'all we've got a insurance policy that go ahead and live how you want to live no you don't have to follow god we don't have to be like noah well yeah but the lord destroyed the word it's okay we got a tower so you can have your cake and you can eat it too you can have fun and you can do what you want to do and we're not obligated to serve god now that worked out really good up until the point they died and suddenly that's not a very good plan anymore amen and so so so here comes god to his own family now if you look at our reading he's saying to israel he's saying to judah you know this is what you've done i didn't make you do it you went out and you played the harlot and you you did it this way but if he'll just repent and come back to me i'll forgive you and then they wouldn't even do that amen and then he appeals to him again he comes back he says listen i won't be mad forever just come back to me and i'll and and we if we could have kept going i could have kept reading and how that he would send them pastors and they'll care for you and i'm gonna take care of you and i'm i'm gonna love you and you're gonna be my possession and and and yet for all of his entreaty you know they they they still somehow man has it in his mind that you know i'm just gonna do it my way even though that's the craziest idea you could possibly have because at the end of it all you will have traded what what what the bible what job describes that a man born of a woman here in your best okay here's going to be the best possible outcome for you as a human you're going to be full of few days and full of trouble amen okay where's the good news yeah that's it no i mean the part where i enjoy myself well you know i want to long enjoy no you'll be a few days well but i'll surely have good times well for all the trouble you have the good days will hardly be noticeable amen and then here comes god along and say uh hey i got a i got a better way um i got a i got a plan that if you will if you will follow my statutes and keep my laws and and observe my ways then i that long life you wanted i'll give you eternal life and those joys you wanted you you won't you can't even comprehend what i'll have in store for you now you would think that a deal like that that the world would be 99.9 righteous and only you know .0001 wicked and yet the reverse is true amen you know i i here's where i wanted to just launch off from from last weekend when we go into revelation 19 and i'm not going to go there tonight so we're not going to go there josh just stay right where you are because we're going to go to psalms here in a minute but we find that when the when the lord come riding out of heaven on a white horse and the armies of heaven followed him that his name was called the word of god and you remember that i pointed out to you that it's interesting because that's exactly what a prophet in this last days tried to tell the world he tried to tell the whole world he went around the world seven times and he went among those denominations and among all those great movements and he said listen he's not an organized religion he's not in a creed he's not in a man-made theory you can't get him by education he's it doesn't come that way okay william branham then then tell us who christ really is and brother brennan would say he's his word and he would go back to john 1 1. in the beginning was the word and brother branham would use that over and over and over again he's the word he's the word there's no way to get to him outside of going by the way of his word and they kept refusing it and kept refusing it and kept refusing it until by the time you get to chapter 19 of revelation the world has been enduring 42 months of tribulation like has never been recorded in history it's not a happy ending amen it's not happily ever after technology's not going to save him it's going to destroy him amen amen so finally as if it as if it couldn't possibly get any worse then the proof comes before their eyes of what a prophet tried to tell them and now here it is the proof there's no more doubt i doubt that they doubt it at that point but now there's absolutely no doubt because the armies of heaven who believed the prophet's word are following him on white horses and they haven't even been there for the 42 months of tribulation at all they've been in a wedding supper they've been in a glorious time and and after three and a half years and the world has went through on and i just want to say friends and i wish i had a stronger english word unimaginable horror yes amen unfathomable amen horror incalculable horror unprecedented i mean without remedy that's going to be the real sad part is that the tribulation will bring things upon the world that by the time that 50 of them are are are have have you know 50 things have hit they still haven't figured out how to solve the first one yeah amen amen that's what the tribulation is going to be and by the time it's several years deep and and so many things have happened and they still because the things that are coming upon the world have a unique twist to them they can't be fixed there's no solution there's no antidote there's no remedy there's no vaccine not even a bad one none and they're they're they're literally and that's that's pretty bad when you are when you're helpless it's that's bad enough but when you're helpless and hopeless that's about as bad as it gets and yet god constantly in this day and hour is still trying to warn the world i mean when you try to put it in this context the way i'm i'm the way i'm approaching it tonight it it it then who's crazy amen are we crazy oh you're nuts you think i'm crazy what are you crazy you think i'm crazy because you know it's it's amazing that jesus made these words and i'm going to tell you something friends there has never been in the history of mankind a more reliable statement now this is a day of you know unreliability i mean nobody keeps their word anymore in fact is lying as an art an art form yeah in in politics and in religion and and and and and social media and and fake news and even the real news and even it's all with a twist i mean they're they're so so there's there is no sure ground today that's the reality that the world is in and and and one day looking out over a crowd jesus of nazareth gives the most reliable statement in human record when he says i am the way the truth and the life there has never been it's equal you're talking about a reliable statement all of heaven and earth would pass away but that one brother i'm going to tell you something when he said i am the way in other words he was saying my way is the truth and it leads to life and there's no other path to get to life outside of the truth that is my way amen reliably he's the way reliably he's the truth assuredly his way leads to life and there is no plan b there's no alternate path there you there a man tried that jesus covered that in a parable that a man actually got into the wedding supper only he crawled in a window yeah and jesus confronted him even called him friend friend how did you get in here without without being dressed in the garment of the word and the bible says the man was speechless he was astonished he was so busted he he he didn't even have a good answer i'm gonna tell you some friends that that is in the tribulation period that kind of astonishment that kind of uh you know where they're just speechless with no you know right now they've got every kind of oh they make every kind of claim they make every kind of uh of joke about god and every kind of sacrilegious thing that they can say and they deny his existence and they take his name in vain and they make fun of his family and they and they laugh and jeer from the highest to the lowest at all levels in all corners of the world amen but in a tribulation period nobody be laughing amen all comedians will go out of business in the tribulation period there won't be anything they can say to make people laugh that's how horrid that's how bad the tribulation will be and to think that a prophet and this is why god said to them now in that 13th verse only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou has transgressed against the lord thy god and and has scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and you have not obeyed my voice saith lord admit it why can't you just admit it and we're living in an age where nobody takes responsibility for anything nobody takes blame it doesn't even matter if they know every kind of company that gets in trouble these days the government the only way to get them to admit to to pay to to not have to go to court and drag it out with lawyers who can who can drag the government out for years the government says okay if you'll pay you know 20 million dollars and they say okay we'll pay that since that's only about a month of our profits anyway and but we will not admit guilt and so let me get this straight you're going to give the government 20 million dollars and but you don't want to say you're guilty i never figured that one out why you think i'm guilty how about 20 million reasons i mean who would pay 20 million dollars or 50 million or a hundred million and and you're not guilty and of course they're guilty and everybody knows they're guilty and even they know they're guilty and they know you know they're guilty they don't even didn't they but but they want it they don't want to have to admit to that and you know corporations poison the earth and people get sick and nobody admits it and politicians lie and and they get caught and then nobody will admit it and pharmaceuticals and you know the military and the fbi and i mean churches people your neighbors sometimes even god's family can get caught in things and and we just have the hardest time in the world you know it's it can be difficult for a human being when they are when they are in the face of their con the con they're having to deal with the consequences of bad decisions one of the hardest things in the world for them to do is say you know it's all my fault yeah amen and i knew better i'm going to tell you something friends let me give you a life lesson can can i give you a life lesson amen i and and i heard brother branham say this a long time ago and i have practiced it with precision and i have had such amazing results i could finish this service just giving you testimony after testimony how i escaped the edge of the sword by a quick repentance just repent quickly brother branham said quick repentance save david saved israel quick repentance has many times brother branham said a quick repentance coming to the lord very quickly not trying to drag it out not trying to ignore it not trying to deny it not trying to not trying to cover it up or or sugarcoat it but just own it and just say it's not my brother or my sister but it's me oh lord standing in the need of prayer i i practice that for years i i have no problem apologizing when i have found that i'm wrong i'm i'm practice that with my kids who are here tonight can testify to that it was no problem for me to look my son as a little boy and say dad was wrong i'm sorry and i was wrong plenty but i'm gonna tell you something friends that god loves a contrite heart amen what what god resists is pride don't don't ever come around god with that prideful arrogance just just do like the publican and and you know smite your own breast and say god be merciful to me a sinner amen that's the kind that god is looking to help he's trying to help you it's not here god is not an evil ogre you know he's not some you know some terrible uh fiend who who wants to put the whole world under his thumb he's not even like that the bible said his very throne is established in mercy god god got excited in the word to be able to declare that mercy rejoices against judgment that in sacrifices and offerings thou has had no pleasure but a body has thou prepared me this was always god's way this is god's desire is to have mercy upon sinful men when he doesn't even have to he him the offended party him the offended party trying to make up with you that staggers the mind because nobody does that anymore he said if you only acknowledge your iniquity he says here in psalms 143 give me that josh brother josh psalms 143 verse 1. hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness listen to this plea and this is david crying out and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified for the enemy hath persecuted my soul now i want you to pay close attention to that statement for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground that's a pretty bad enemy amen amen this enemy ain't no joke look at what he can do he hath smitten my life down to the ground he beat me to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness nobody does that voluntarily this enemy beat him to the ground and forced him into a dark into a complete darkness as those that have been long dead therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate i mean here's a man who has his enemy got a hold of him and persecuted his soul and the persecution was so bad he likened it to being beaten to the ground and dragged into a dark dungeon and left for dead say brother jason why are you making such a deal over the enemy that hath persecuted my soul because your soul has no closer enemy than your flesh your soul doesn't have a closer enemy amen your flesh is the closest enemy to your soul possible if a man was standing six inches from you you'd still be closer to your soul than him so you want to absorb this tonight there is no enemy closer to your soul then your own flesh and i'm here to tell you something friends your flesh your fallen flesh is a vicious nasty unforgiving unrelenting enemy that the devil seeks to use to afflict your soul so much so that you can get into a place where you just feel like i've been left for dead in a dark dungeon i've been completely beaten down but here's the good news friends there is one who can take control of your greatest enemy there is one who offers you help to say you don't have to be victimized by you i'll protect you from you glory yeah all those weaknesses in you i'll put them on a i'll put a chain around their neck all those stumblings that you hate so bad all those things that you regret all your life and you wish you could go back and do them don't worry son i'll put a chain around those things i'll fasten them to the ground and they won't ever bother you again until you get a body change hallelujah that's the kind of victory that i want in my life amen amen i remember the days of old verse five i meditate on all thy works i muse on the works of thy hands i stretch forth my hands unto thee verse six my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land selah hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not my face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit cause me to hear i love this cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul to thee that's such a craving of my heart amen cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my voice unto thee brother branham said in numerous places i'm just going to take one from spoken word as original seed he said all that's in the scripture has got to be fulfilled amen then if god said anything there you are it's got to be fulfilled or if it isn't that's not the word of god the word of god then if it is that isn't the word of god see where then where are we at let's get something in other words he's saying if if if the word of god fails let's get something that looks like god or or anything we want to do as the bible said eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die now if that is not the word of god then we're all lost amen i mean there's where our soul hangs tonight friends if if this book is not true you might as well eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die amen so so there's you understand there's no middle ground there's no second place there's no second bus either this is true or it's not true and if it's not true let's just all go out and and blow it out but if it is true then let's give our whole life to it because it's the only way the only truth that can lead us to life and life is what i want amen life is what i want happy life long happy life oh yes i love life i love living but i don't love living as a failure amen i don't like living i don't like underachieving i don't i love knowing i'm a son of god i love that god loves me i love that i love him i love that i i love his word i love that i love it i love that i believe it i love that i see it because because the overwhelming majority of humanity doesn't see it say that's favoritism no god said they closed their own eyes yes amen but there was something inside of you something inside of me that said that's not for me i don't want to close my eyes i want to know i want god to be honest with me and tell me and god is so reliable he'll do that he'll tell you here's your problem here's what you need and what lord what can i do don't worry i can fix it just give me your life and i'll fix it amen because i built it i invented it i invented life i'm the progenitor of all life all life comes from me so he says if it's not then then wow if it isn't the word of god then let's get something that looks like god or anything that we want to eat drink and be merry and and and and if it is the word of god watch this now here's a great confidence builder if it is the word of god then god is absolutely honor-bound he's honor-bound the god who is the fountain of all honor who is the beginning of all honor who is the source of all honor who is the source of all truth has got to stand by what he said and if this isn't god's word then who is god where is god or is there a god brother branham comes to the feast of the trumpets and now he's coming to the tribulation period and how that there was there's a debate even in his day it's even to this day that that the church goes through the tribulation and brother brown said sure yeah the church does but not the bride right and see that whole wait what the church the bride war you you talk like they're different well they they didn't used to be different but a unique characteristic of the last age is like in the first exodus when god called a nation out of a nation uniquely at the end time he calls a church out of a church and labels her says i don't call you church anymore i call you bride you're the elect lady you're the full restoration of what was back there in the alpha and so he says you say the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it brother adam says the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if and if there is anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so is it on the bride we listen we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it [Applause] amen that tells me that i wasn't good enough to get there you're not gonna have to get there get off your high horse get over yourself and just admit it we all deserved hell but his grace holds over my life hallelujah hallelujah praise god psalms 51 brother josh psalms 51-1 i got to hurry i want to finish in 10 minutes psalms 51 1 have mercy upon me o god according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies how many want to say this with me blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judge us in other words david is making sure i love this now this really turns to the heart of my message david is is is taking a global stand here to say listen earth listen all you population i got nobody to blame but me it's not my parents fault it's not my spouse's fault it's not the priest's fault it's not the prophet's fault it's me i alone i am guilty i'm standing before god and i want you to i want the world to know i'm asking for his mercy amen i'm pleading for his loving kindness but when he judges me whatever he decides i want you to know now he's just amen amen i want to make this declaration to the world he's right yes and we're all wrong amen all of us we're wrong he's the only one who's right he's the only one who's just say what if what if he decides to destroy you i don't think he will because my heart is crying out for mercy and i mean it with every fiber of my being and i'm acknowledging my transgression and i'm not trying to hide my sin and i'm pleading to god to have mercy on me and he promised that's the kind of people that he'll have mercy on not of people who are arrogant want their own way and don't tell me what to do just go right on to destruction with that kind of thinking not me let me off that train let me off right here and right now i'll take the way with the lord's despised few hallelujah he says behold verse 5 behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirous truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to no wisdom purge me with hyssop that's not fun purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i will be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice this isn't some weird psychology of some man who you know he loves torment and loves torture and he's got some weirdo twisted affection like like people have had these psychological disorders this is david crying out from an honest heart i deserved hell i deserved to die i deserved i should have squandered every chance that i was ever given but i'm here today lord to say i admit i'm wrong i admit you're right and i'm asking for mercy and i don't deserve it but that's really the point isn't it because if it wouldn't be mercy if you deserved it create in me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me brother josh what happened to my scripture we were in uh i was in verse 10. go back to verse 10 i want to catch it again all right create in me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from you aren't those beautiful words restore unto me all of my worldly pleasures and toys give me more money than the people across the street make me a great man of wealth and influence david had already had all that david already knew what that that was a dead end all that did was poison him yes amen restore unto me the joy of thy not my not my salvation not what i call salvation oh i'm a believer really and that's in your home and that's in your life and oh but i'm a believer don't judge me david wasn't interested in his own salvation he'd had enough of david's salvation i'm telling some i've had enough of jason's salvation my salvation ain't worth ain't worth a plug nickel i want his salvation i want his level of salvation i want what he calls right in my life restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit so i said to you earlier the most dependable statement ever made was when jesus said i am the way the truth and the life declaring that his way is the truth and there is not another one and it's the only way that leads to life and you know i i find i i find this and i and i'm just i'm just going to just abandon my notes for a minute and just conclude this way you know i i was i was at sister sarah blew her funeral sister debbie and i two of there's only three white people in the whole building a couple hundred african-americans and her whole family and and black churches and pastors and i was sitting on the on the platform it was probably a funny sight i was one white guy in the middle of all those black preachers and but i tell you me and brother blue we about had a jubilee and brother blue got to preaching and it was amazing brother blue you know because look here you know okay let's let's just let's just put it right out on the table here's brother lee who is saying to this black audience he's saying he said i don't care what you think he said i'm a black man who believes in a white prophet and i just kind of i just kind of that's when you become a mannequin man you just you don't you don't you're not going to have a reaction because you're trying to look around to see what everybody else's reaction to that is i can smile okay good brother jewel's sitting right here and he's laughing okay i can laugh and and he meant it and he said and and it got excited and i kind of got excited because i love brotherly anyway and he got he got preached and he said i'll tell you right now he said if you don't believe that he said you can meet me out in the yard and he said and we he said when you do he said brother jason will be standing right beside me and before i could even stop myself i had jumped to my feet and i said you got that right and he turned around he goes is that right brother jason i said you got that right and and you know and it was quite a moment and you know what he brother brother blue went after went after his own race of people and he said y'all can say what you want to and he said i know all the political things that's going on and he said all the black lives matter and and all of the racist stuff that goes on he said y'all know as well as me he said we've deserved a lot of that stuff that we've got he starts talking about the the the mistreatment the abuse by the police and he and here's brother i couldn't say that i was no way i was going to say that because first of all i wouldn't say it right and because i got a whole different mindset yeah and brother blue can say it because he's black speaking to his own people and he said y'all know y'all all know a lot of times we deserve those kind of things or these boys got beat down like that and i just said wow and then you know what i thought about i thought about yeah that's right you know i'm a white guy and i can stand here to a wide audience and i can remind you what brother branham said about us yes that the white man is the rascal of all of them amen and i can stand and look out over any white audience and say come on y'all you know racism runs deep here in the south don't you even try to deny that here's a white guy looking at you white people we know that's true yeah amen we might as well own it we shouldn't hide from that brother branham said that's why the white man's got it coming because what he did to the native american and what he done to the african slaves yes amen and he said the white man is the rascal of it all you know it would it would it would be difficult for brother blue to come to a white audience and say that to you but i can say it and we know it's true yeah amen we we even right within the ranks of the message there has been times where you know we have uh done things and said things and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves amen me included and so you know you say where in the world is this going i've got a point i've got a point hallelujah because i find myself standing before the king of the universe amen and i see in my mind's eye i see myself standing before his throne and here's all of humanity standing with me and i got something i want to say and i can see myself stepping out in front of all humanity and say men and women of the world we know don't anybody try to deny it we all know that what god says is wrong is wrong that's right it's right that he says it's wrong amen amen amen i mean we're all sinners we all deserve to die and if this being on the throne doesn't save us there's no way we could earn our salvation we all deserve to die and i want to say to to the humanity of the world everybody needs to own that quit blaming god for the problems in your life quit blaming god for the problems in the world he's the only right one among us he's the only true one he's the only just one and we're all sinners and we know we are amen just admit it that's what i want to do i want to turn around and say your majesty i'm a sinner save me have mercy on me i'm not trying to defend myself i'm not trying to say we're right i'm trying to say we're wrong we've been wrong we'll keep being wrong you're the only one who's right and i want to raise up my hands and say help me help me lord help me don't let me die don't let me go to hell i don't wan i won't have life i want to be in heaven and we now that's a that's a speech we can all give red yellow black or white amen we all need to own that amen and just fall like david did and say lord and i and and i i i could have read some more there was uh other scriptures that i that i that i wanted to read i didn't i didn't want to take the time to get into them but david david pleads to the lord and he says when you judge me judge me from the inside please don't judge my outside because no man can stand can justify himself in your presence when i when i find myself doing wrong my prayer to god is to say lord please look on the man inside who loves you and please don't regard this outside man he's a rascal he's a he's a rascal and as a white man he's the most rascal of all the rascals and he he's prone to get pleasure mad lord i'm sorry i get embarrassed over how pleasure mad he can get lord please forgive me lord i get embarrassed at how at how unspiritual he can be at how carnal how easily he can go from spiritual to carnal spiritual to carnal lord don't judge me by that man please that's not the real me that's the guy who torments my soul that's my flesh who reflects my soul by the inside man when you're going to look upon me lord look at that guy because that's the guy that loves you that's the guy who wants to stand in your presence and force this weak feeble sinful ungodly flesh that afflicts my soul daily and beats me to the ground and drags me to a dark dungeon and leaves me for dead lord open the gate and let me out bring the light of your word back and lift me up out of the shadows how many people tonight in this building say lord lift me out of this dungeon of darkness lift me up above the shadows bring me out into the light of the day stand with me friends to be able to to to defend i i took my title tonight in the lord's defense i want you to know something as you bow your heads and have the musicians just quietly make your way forward i want you to with your heads bowed sweep over my soul dad please sweet spirit sweep over my soul father tonight we stand here with our heads and our hearts bowed before you and lord i we we had these last couple of weekends have meant so much to me personally the previous weekend lord two weekends ago and we had such a glorious weekend with the ministers gathering and and then we came lord and and and and had a service with our dear brother jack duff and what a time of rejoicing singing rejoicing and praising and preaching and believing and what a challenging hour then we come back the next week lord last weekend and we have our dear brother richie to come down lord and he takes up the men's breakfast and then he comes lord and we gather saturday night he preaches our to our hearts and we have the lord's supper and then we come back sunday morning and what what glorious atmospheres we had in here amen what a wonderful time we had in your word lord and father it it inspires me it's it's what inspired this sermon to say oh god don't don't just don't just set me right but lift me up lift me up higher lord i i want to be lord if if people could only realize that the glories of god are just just above your head ready to pour down all you have to do is reach up and make contact just like abraham when he was looking for a city build an altar and looking for it he's a stranger and a pilgrim and brother brahm said right where he built his altar city was just above him right there he he knew it was somewhere because he had met its king that's what happened to us lord we met the king we met the king of salem we met the priest of the most high god we met one under the order of melchizedek and now lord god i don't want to be i i i don't want to [Music] to carry on in the mad in this mad world and all of its madness and all of its all of its comforts and all of its carnality i want to be like abraham i'm on a journey somewhere lord i'm trying to get somewhere i'm not looking to stay at the level i'm at lord i'm thoroughly tired of the level that i've been at i want to move higher it just seemed like lord what a way to start a new year to come in with just back to back services like that and one right after another and one right on top of another coming back in here tonight i was so anxious to come here again into this building lord pour out your spirit among us pour it upon this church pour it upon our youth poured upon the married couples lord god lift us up father we realize the world can't last much longer we want to acknowledge your rightness we want to acknowledge lord god the sad the sad reality father is that some people would find themselves just at ease in this sin-filled world lord god tonight if there is anyone who finds themselves at ease in this sin cursed world lord i pray somehow you break through that darkness break through it father because there there's a disease that a prophet referred to as like a pleasure madness he called it being pleasure mad over and over said it in a message over and over and over and over pleasure mad pleasure mad pleasure mad and he started naming actual activities and and things that dabbling in this and dabbling in that and involved in this and involved in that pleasure mad and it broke his heart lord because he he actually knew that some of people who were caught in that affliction with that you're talking about a virus you're talking about a disease [Music] and he said many of them lord are your children and they don't want to be like that they don't want to be caught in that but satan's got such a grip on him master i'm praying tonight lord we're going to take up some sick requests but the the the the thing that needs the most prayer is the souls of your believing family help us as a church help us as a family lord god let there be let let this year if this is our last year lord let us cross the finish line running i i i don't want to be dull i want to i want to be sprinting to to the home line lord let us be about the father's business let us shake ourselves if we have to let us make the changes in our lives that are necessary and break free [Music] tear free from the pleasure madness that grips our minds grips the minds of our young people every kind of pleasure madness no spirituality at all no spirituality in the home the whole home pleasure mad [Music] father i'm asking for your help tonight as we come to the end of this service lord god you're

sent him home with oxygen and a couple of days later his oxygen numbers were steadily going down he got really bad last friday morning and his wife was about to take him back to the hospital he told her to first call and ask for us to come anoint him with oil and pray for him i i felt inspired i took oil down and prayed for brother joe right here sitting right about where jonathan is now and prayed for brother joe i felt i had already felt it twice i almost did it on uh on a previous service and so i prayed for him sunday anointing him with oil he says he wanted us to come over and anoint him with oil and pray for him so a couple of us went and had prayer and a great witness of the lord's presence came in the room we watched as he made a complete turnaround in the next hour the next day he didn't need the oxygen at all and sunday he was in church testifying [Music] yeah exactly this was truly a miraculous turnaround and he continually gets stronger god is so wonderful to us i agree god is so wonderful to us i don't know if any of y'all read sister erica when she sister erica was reagan i don't know what her married name is uh what is it parker and so you know i mean here she is with pretty much you know you've got serious cancer and the doctor had told her you're you're going to be here for till you die on medicine and we'll try to keep you alive as long as we can and everybody started praying and you know we we were we were in tennessee and she was still really it was still touch and go but she if you ever read any of her testimonies on facebook she's always very positive very positive and i said i said brother donnie i said i'm going to tell you something and we were sitting in car sister david since carol we're in in that uh therapist place we had sister debbie up there seeing that clinician and i said brother donnie i'm going to tell you what's happening sister erica i said she's living off of the word seed word that you have spent a lifetime sowing in her the the word of god that you have sowed in her all her life that's what's holding her right now i said buddy i said is it worth it oh i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you it's worth it to sow the seed of the word of god and she she had this testimony this was recently several weeks ago and i've got another follow-up that came in today that's why i'm reading the old one she said i went to the cancer center in nashville today to see what was recommended for maintenance in my case the doctors were very surprised at my recovery they kept asking about my symptoms and side effects i kept saying there were none which baffled the doctors i asked is i she says i ask is this not normal no it's not normal what's happened to you is just short of miraculous she says i know it's a complete miracle they also said there was no maintenance to be done other than scans periodically i'm so overwhelmed by the goodness of the lord i'd like to thank him for all he's done for me a miracle in 2021 boo devil [Music] now brother donnie put in the in the chat today erica is at her oncologist now he just told her she was a miracle he told her initially she might as well get used to it doctors visits would be part of her life for the rest of her life but today he said that isn't necessary now come maybe every three months for scans our god is so wonderful that that just happened hallelujah i'll tell you something friends god moves by prayer brother ronald dean was just telling from his own pulpit i didn't hear it sister debbie was telling me about it and he said he was recently at the doctor and he's a living miracle and he said his last his last visit he's sitting in there and he can hear the doctors coming and there's a there's another doctor shadowing him and he says they stopped just outside the door and ronaldine could overhear him and he said he heard his doctor saying to this other doctor he said now we're about to walk in here and he said when you see this man you're going to wonder why is he even here he said he's going to look and act and talk completely normal and he said you're going to wonder why are we even talking to this guy and he said but he's the sickest man in this building and he said but yet every everything we're looking at one miracle after another one i'm going to tell you something god is backing that thing down one step at a time and everything those doctors have said they have to keep keep taking it back keep taking it back and he said he said the last thing you heard that doctor say now we're going to go in here and you're going to see that he said but he said i'm just going to tell you that's just his god that's just his god hey guess what that's my god too guess what it's your god too hallelujah and he is still here and he's still working miracles god still moves in a miraculous way and you know it's it's not we're not in a hopeless situation friend pray when you pray believe the bible says that when you pray believe if you don't believe don't bother praying you're not going to get nothing from god but if you believe him all things are possible to them that believe and i i don't have any other requests other than the ones that i just read and let me take one final look because i'm all people are always sending them in too late but let me take one final quick scan no don't have any more so we've had them read
