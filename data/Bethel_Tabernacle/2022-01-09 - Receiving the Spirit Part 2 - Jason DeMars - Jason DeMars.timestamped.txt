[8:25] confused especially in adoption
[8:27] stature of a perfect man so just
[8:28] understand those things in the realm of
[8:31] progressive revelation that brother
[8:33] branham received in his life
[8:38] so
[8:39] in the book of acts
[8:41] they give us
[8:43] steps of salvation that's what i would
[8:45] call it
[8:47] steps of salvation acts 16 38 i'm just
[8:50] going to read quick if you want to just
[8:52] take out take the scripture down from
[8:54] the screen i'm just going to read quick
[8:55] because the time is
[8:56] escaping me
[8:58] acts 16 31 and they said believe on the
[9:00] lord jesus christ and thou shalt be
[9:02] saved
[9:03] and thy house
[9:05] the first step of salvation is believing
[9:09] that's the first step
[9:11] you could never repent if you didn't
[9:13] believe
[9:14] you wouldn't see the need to it because
[9:16] you'd say i don't believe that why do i
[9:18] need to repent you can't repent first
[9:19] and then believe
[9:21] first thing you do is you hear the word
[9:23] and you receive it by faith
[9:26] and then of course acts 2 38 they rece
[9:29] they heard the word they believed it
[9:30] they said what do we do peter and he
[9:33] says repent
[9:34] that's the next step
[9:36] so you believe then you repent
[9:39] means turn away you're walking in one
[9:41] direction turn away from that direction
[9:43] that you're walking and turn this
[9:45] direction it speaks of a change of mind
[9:49] turn away from that
[9:50] and then what should we do next
[9:52] be baptized
[9:54] in the name of jesus christ
[9:56] for the remission of sins
[9:58] so that so believe repent
[10:01] be baptized in water
[10:03] and then what's the last part and you
[10:04] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[10:07] receiving the holy ghost these are the
[10:09] steps of salvation
[10:16] so it's one act many different
[10:18] descriptions
[10:20] it's it's spoken of as a baptism
[10:24] so an immersion
[10:26] spoke of being born again receiving the
[10:28] gift of the holy spirit receiving the
[10:30] holy spirit regeneration a seal
[10:33] an earnest
[10:34] a new creation
[10:36] adoption
[10:38] and begotten again it's one act
[10:41] many different descriptions
[10:44] the evidence of the holy ghost john 16
[10:48] 13 and 14 is what brother branham points
[10:50] to
[10:51] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[10:54] come
[10:55] he will guide you into all truth for he
[10:57] shall not speak of himself
[10:59] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[11:01] he speak and he will show you things to
[11:03] come
[11:04] he shall glorify me
[11:06] for he shall receive of mine and shall
[11:08] show it unto you
[11:10] so this was the verse that brother
[11:12] branham pointed to as the evidence of
[11:14] the holy ghost and if you remember the
[11:16] last time i spoke on this
[11:18] the term term evidence or initial
[11:21] evidence of the holy ghost is never
[11:23] found in scripture
[11:25] it's never found in scripture it's about
[11:26] what the holy ghost does in you and i
[11:28] think if you look at that look what
[11:30] brother branham is telling us it's about
[11:32] what the holy ghost does in us
[11:35] if you misunderstand that the evidence
[11:37] of the holy ghost is receiving the
[11:39] message of the hour you throw us back
[11:41] into the baptist doctrine
[11:44] that just believing is the evidence of
[11:46] the holy ghost then
[11:48] what in the world was brother talking
[11:49] about over and over again where he says
[11:52] first you have faith and then later on
[11:54] you go and receive the holy ghost
[11:56] have you received the holy ghost since
[11:58] you believed
[12:00] so they believed but they hadn't
[12:02] received the holy ghost yet
[12:04] and so
[12:06] you come up with a conundrum it's like a
[12:08] self-contradiction
[12:10] if you try to say that believing the
[12:12] message is
[12:14] with no explanation believing the
[12:16] message is received is the evidence of
[12:18] the holy ghost that's true
[12:20] but you're missing the scripture that
[12:21] the prophet brought
[12:23] and you're putting something back onto
[12:25] it that is not exactly what he's saying
[12:28] what is it what am i saying read the
[12:31] scripture again
[12:32] when the spirit of truth is come he will
[12:34] guide you into all truth
[12:36] so the spirit already came
[12:38] right
[12:40] when the spirit of truth comes into your
[12:42] life
[12:43] he's going to guide you into all truth
[12:44] it's not that you're led into all truth
[12:47] and then you and then you receive the
[12:48] holy ghost it's the holy spirit will
[12:51] guide you
[12:52] into truth that's a process right
[12:55] that's a continual process
[12:57] you can't say i've been led to the truth
[12:58] that's it that's the end of it you mean
[13:01] you the moment
[13:02] that you were
[13:04] born again you knew everything about the
[13:06] message you knew every doctrine you knew
[13:08] every detail about the message
[13:11] that's not what brother branham's saying
[13:14] you know in the token message he clearly
[13:17] he clearly states i mentioned this
[13:18] before and i'm going to mention it again
[13:21] you say i believe the message that's
[13:23] great that just means you can read
[13:28] that just means you can read and and
[13:30] you've received something logically
[13:33] you must have the token
[13:35] okay so why why would he say that if the
[13:38] evidence of the holy ghost is believing
[13:40] the message
[13:41] you see what i'm saying it seems like a
[13:42] self-contradiction but it isn't it's the
[13:45] perspective that we're looking at it
[13:46] from
[13:48] what does he mean when he says receiving
[13:50] the message of the hour is the evidence
[13:51] of the holy ghost he's what is he saying
[13:53] is that an evidence of the holy the
[13:56] the holy spirit in your life guides you
[13:58] into all truth
[14:00] that is the ultimate
[14:03] when you have the holy spirit what does
[14:04] it produce it produces the fruit of the
[14:05] spirit it produces the love of god
[14:07] produces a new creation
[14:09] all those things are part of what it
[14:11] does but the ultimate thing
[14:14] that we need to be walking in and living
[14:16] in is truth if we're walking in false
[14:19] doctrine and error
[14:21] that's an evidence we don't have the
[14:23] holy ghost
[14:24] right and that's that is going to
[14:26] produce false living and false life
[14:29] true revelation of the true word with
[14:32] the spirit of god in your life it will
[14:34] guide you continually into all truth
[14:37] and it will produce love fruit gifts etc
[14:41] but those are all those other things are
[14:43] all secondary
[14:44] to the truth
[14:46] the truth the word
[14:48] is what
[14:49] should bring for a believer emotion
[14:52] gifts
[14:53] love
[14:55] fruit of the spirit all those other
[14:57] things it's out of the word what's the
[14:59] truth the word
[15:01] so when you have the holy ghost it's
[15:03] going to guide you into the truth if
[15:04] you're a person that's sitting in a
[15:06] domination and you've genuinely received
[15:08] the holy ghost god's going to lead you
[15:09] out of that thing
[15:10] and into the full truth of the word of
[15:12] god for this day
[15:15] and let's further that along is a person
[15:17] can be sitting in a
[15:19] in a message church and looking 100
[15:22] percent past tense at what god has done
[15:26] back in the 60s 50s and 60s
[15:29] that's wonderful but that's a long time
[15:31] ago
[15:32] god is doing something today
[15:34] the prophet told us what god would be
[15:36] doing in his people today
[15:38] and yet people say i don't need that i
[15:39] don't want that i don't want any part of
[15:41] that i just want the tapes
[15:43] i just want the messenger i don't need
[15:45] any of that other stuff
[15:47] it's a great it's a grave danger
[15:50] we have to be led into all truth
[15:53] another another point to be made is
[15:56] look at the understanding that people
[15:58] around the message sister gene can
[16:00] testify of this
[16:02] at this people that
[16:04] the understanding people had of the
[16:06] message in 1961
[16:09] compare that sister gene to 1966 to
[16:12] today
[16:13] the things that you
[16:14] that the lord has shown you today
[16:16] compared to 66 you had no clue of them
[16:19] in 1966
[16:21] what is it the holy spirit is guiding
[16:22] you into all truth we're not we're not
[16:24] feeding on a different message we're
[16:26] feeding on the exact same message that
[16:28] sister gene was feeding on in 1966
[16:31] but what is it it's the spirit of god
[16:33] guiding you into all truth it's not
[16:35] enough it's not enough to say i believe
[16:37] the message it's not enough to say i
[16:39] believe in jesus
[16:41] those disciples
[16:43] back then
[16:44] in in acts 19
[16:46] they believed in jesus but they hadn't
[16:48] forwarded themselves
[16:50] into what god was doing today
[16:52] and paul
[16:54] showed them the steps of salvation you
[16:56] had the steps of salvation under that
[16:58] old thing
[17:00] under under john's
[17:02] john's
[17:03] connection between the old old testament
[17:06] and the new testament now there's
[17:07] something new
[17:09] now there's something different if they
[17:10] would have said no thank you
[17:12] what does that show they
[17:14] never had anything in the first place
[17:16] they're just following a religion
[17:18] the spirit of god guides us into all
[17:20] truth and i know under that
[17:21] circumstances they hadn't even received
[17:23] or known about the spirit of god yet
[17:26] the point simply being for all of us we
[17:28] have to be led into all truth that is
[17:30] the evidence of the holy ghost
[17:32] and that isn't just believing in the
[17:34] message
[17:35] that is walking continually in the
[17:38] message
[17:40] initial when we talk about initial
[17:42] evidence of the holy ghost again
[17:46] receiving receipt it's not about the
[17:48] initial it's about the continual the
[17:51] word guide
[17:53] speaks of that he will guide you into
[17:55] all truth
[17:56] a guide
[17:58] isn't
[17:59] a one and done
[18:01] i received the holy ghost i have the
[18:03] initial i believe the message i have the
[18:05] initial evidence
[18:06] that's that's all i need it's a guide
[18:09] it's he'll the holy spirit in your life
[18:11] will continually
[18:13] guide you and that's the chiefest of the
[18:16] the evidences of the holy spirit the
[18:18] outward
[18:19] working of the spirit is that god is
[18:21] leading you in the truth because if he's
[18:23] leading you in the truth
[18:24] with the pure heart purified heart by
[18:26] the by the word and by the spirit
[18:29] all the other attributes of the what the
[18:31] spirit does the gifts the fruit the love
[18:35] that will follow
[18:37] but if you're walking in false
[18:39] understanding human understanding none
[18:42] of that will follow
[18:43] you're just following a religion on the
[18:45] outward side so
[18:47] all right we'll finish there if you want
[18:48] to stand we'll pray
[18:54] heavenly father we just come before you
[18:55] now lord and we're so thankful for your
[18:57] word lord i pray you'd quicken it to our
[18:58] hearts
[18:59] pray that you would
[19:01] be that guide to us to lead us into all
[19:03] truth lord grant us
[19:04] more and and deeper revelation of your
[19:07] word lord that that our lives would be
[19:09] continuously changed and transformed by
[19:11] the renewing of our minds father bless
[19:14] the service the worship today may your
[19:16] name be lifted up and glorified we ask
[19:18] in
[19:19] jesus name
