[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] and I can't really look at my screens either without a little bit of amen a little bit of knocking it down praise the Lord so I thank you for your prayers and we'll have an announcement you know kind of make it for the sake of the internet I know that um I sent to you all yesterday and so uh we'll kind of make an announcement from the pulpit in the main service amen Revelation chapter 22 this morning and I want to begin this series that I'm going to go the Lord willing through the remainder of this month and in through June through the end of June on the Sunday School classes and I'll take an occasional Wednesday also and so um I I wore my Apple watch today because it'll it's like a it'll keep track and I can set a timer and if I get preaching it'll warn me it'll give me one or two it'll say you're in a loud environment you need to move Outdoors amen or it'll try to dial 9-1-1 it thinks I'm being killed or something like that and it'll start buzzing so as long as I don't feel that I think I'll be okay amen Revelation chapter 20 22 and I don't I said might have said 21 but we're coming to 22 we're going to read 18. uh trying to find what okay well let's just read our text from your Bibles in Revelation chapter 22 and uh let's begin uh verse 18. for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen he that he which testifieth these things saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen praise the Lord let's pray father we thank you for these scriptural verses Lord that we have read here this morning and we ask for your help now as we begin to bring this thought to the people lord it's um on my heart for some for some time and so I'm thanking you for the opportunity Lord to be able to divert to a different way and at the same time accomplish something Lord of a burden so I'm giving it into your hands now in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated let's have my title slide as soon as you have it Brothers yeah okay okay all right so okay dismissed no I'm just kidding it's all right I will um I will describe to you what you're not seeing so if we um had the um screen up this morning I wanted to begin this series today and it is indeed going to be a series in multiple parts and I'm calling it the final example to the final age now you'd be very familiar with the statement that the bride is the final voice to the final age amen but if you'll remember that when the Apostle Paul was speaking about to sisters and how that they should Adorn themselves and and how you know an adorned means to beautify and and the way that they beautify themselves as in modest apparel and uh one of the things that he points out is to have a chaste conversation amen you want to you need that on the screen up here oh okay all right cool all right so uh you remember that brother Branham or excuse me the Apostle Paul one of the other characteristics that he points out is that they should have a chaste conversation now whether it's a woman or a man it's just like we read here he says if any man you know add to or if any man take away does that not include sisters of course it does it actually is a Greek word that means mankind Humanity at large and so the principle given to a sister would also apply to a brother that a Chase conversation now I'm going to make a connection because the word conversation in the Greek means your behavior so it's not about you know the words coming out of her mouth it's the words coming from the expression of her life amen so now so now you should be able to easily connect the final voice to the final age as a final example amen because it's a chaste conversation it's a Godly lifestyle it's a lifestyle of Holiness and so this was going to be the title of my the theme and title of my Series going forward through this month in June the final example to the final age now as a as a a kind of a sub scripture underneath my title you would find Hebrews 13 and 8. now this is a great theme for us this is the theme that brother Branham used constantly Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen now the reason that that that I'm bringing that in is because if there's going to be a final example a final voice a final lived life to a final age as an example then certainly it's going to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because in the mystery of the Rapture when he descends in a shout and a voice and a trumpet it's Christ doing all three through human instrumentality all right so so when he when he comes to a prophet that's not William branham's message or even his thinking that it's actually the mind of Christ speaking through a prophet and therefore when it comes into the time of the of the final voice to the final age you you don't get to pick and choose you don't get to um you know to alter or change what the expression ought to be based on the message that came and so it it the Lord clearly brought to us how he wants us to live and what the idea is is to have his voice speaking through your life to the world all right you got that so it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's how you can identify the new birth that's how you can identify true Doctrine you always remember this you're always wanting to find out where is the I am because the I am is a present tense expression that it it's it's it's whatever form God is operating in presently that's the I am see so when when he says to the Lord when Moses said to the lord they're going to ask me who sent me see and and what will I say they're going to ask me you know what's his name and what will I say and the Lord said to Moses say to them you're me amen say to them I am hath sent me because it'll be me inside your mouth brother Bradham dealt with that in the fourth seal how that he said like from God's mouth to Moses mouth it was God saying I have come down I have heard the Cry of my people I will deliver them according to my promise I made Abraham but I'm sending you Moses and I will speak through your mouth and when you speak it'll be me speaking see so you're always wanting to see where the I am when Jesus was when John was baptizing that was the I am he was the anointed word for that hour he was in that sense Christ when Jesus comes on the scene John says now I must decrease he must increase because now the I am was walking the shores of Galilee you follow that so when he came into the upper room and Beca and the ministry of the son of man moved into the bride body then she became Christ she became Mrs Jesus she became a voice to the age and and that's why Paul could establish the teaching that Paul's Paul was the final voice to all the ages nothing could ever be changed from Paul's teaching all right now I'm having to bring all of this as a foundation all right you're still with me so so we find out don't make me start preaching so we've so we so we find out that that the the the what we're trying to show you here is that now the I am was in the church all right and you're gonna find and I'm not gonna get to it today we'll get to it next time that brother Branham shows how that when he says I'm Alpha and Omega brother Branham in three different places 1958 1960 and 1964 says that he you notice he doesn't say anything in the in between he's the first and the last he's the beginning and the end he's the root and The Offspring of David men he's before David and after David he's the Alpha and the Omega and so but brother Brandon points to the fact that he doesn't talk about the middle and it's not that he's not in the middle because he promised to never leave the church and you can see him walking through the seven golden lampstands but what brother Branham is bringing out is that what's in them that he's he he he is in the middle but not everything in the middle is him now you've got man-made indoctrination injections and so you you then consequently that affects the level of the of the token that can even be on the church and Through the Ages that affects the power of God that there have access to during the ages but we find that at the end time the Jubilee was to return the token was to return the abstract was to return the original Alpha message the Omega was to be the alpha restored and so so we find that that God has come into this final age and he is calling for a final people to be a final Voice or a final expression or a final example of the word because the whole world has this but this is locked up in secret and mystery see and it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it and when he reveals it he reveals it to his family and his family go forth interpreting this in their lives God doesn't need me or you to reinterpret the message he doesn't need me to redo the shell that's finished we have a completed message what now God needs you and I to do is to be the living voice see because this has always been God's pattern you can find that when he set Israel down in the midst he dropped Israel as a nation right down he reserved Canaan that little section of land that he would give to Abraham and his seed when God said lift up your eyes and look north south east and west and everything you see I've given you and he it'll have from this border to this border and from this sea to this to this area and and and if you'll notice that God dropped them down as it were right in the middle of he the Nations they were surrounded by Heathen Nations because what God is doing his principle is to establish an example Nation so that the rest of the world who does not know who the real God was they could look at Israel and say and by Israel's life and by the power that operated and by the anointing and by the blessing of God upon them then the world would be could could could have something to look to could could say Israel's God is the true God see and so now the problem was Israel didn't do a very good job of that and they ended up being taken into captivity but remember that in the Millennium God is going to restore Israel as the leading nation of the world amen now he has a gentile bride but Israel's always his people and he's going to restore Israel as a leading Nation all through the Old Testament it prophesies of that that he's going to restore them as the leading nation of the world in the millennial world and he'll have a gentile bride uh as as the as the executors of his will the dispensers of his word and uh you know and and even the enforcers of his word and so so God now is trying with this same principle at the end time before mankind moves beyond the point of no return before the Gentiles have no more opportunity to be saved he's using that same principle to lift up a bride before the world and say forget what your Bible school told you about this My bride is the interpretation of this forget what you learn by tradition I have a family in the earth who have eaten my word and they have become my word and they are the final example they are the final voice they are the final Authority see so this becomes important because that you know whether or not we speak of you know this series is going to talk about you know whole house Family Values it's going to talk about applying the token to your home we're going to cover principles for a Godly marriage we're going to cover raising children the Bible way we're going to talk about transitioning your teen to adulthood we're going to talk about biblical dedication and finances but all of these if you could see my slide all of these point two one verse that and and we didn't read it but in verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come because now they have become they have become unified very good all right now let's go through it can I control it from here I would imagine hey let's see all right so perfect now I wanted to go to you might have to run it there let me try this again oh there we go it went perfect seems to be going slow okay got it I got it now all right now I wanted to go into Nehemiah because Nehemiah goes to Jerusalem now let me give you the historical setting zerubbabel has already went forward for a there's been a three-phase restoration of of Jerusalem and so and the Temple and so we find out that zerubbabel is going back to lay the foundation Ezra is going to come behind him to build on top of that and to advance forward and then Nehemiah is going to come to restore the city and restore the walls restore families and set the priesthood back in order Nehemiah is going to be the finishing move to everything God has done you're with me now it's important to go to Nehemiah because we're about to connect it to revelation 22 17 for this reason that when Nehemiah goes comes to the king uh we find that it's near the time of the Feast of Tabernacles now the Feast of Tabernacles is the last feast in The Seven Feast of Israel and it and it's a feast of booths and it and and they lived in these booths for a Time time and then at the end of The Feast they disassemble those booths and that's exactly what's happening to you and I that we live in this body but this body is going to be disassembled and I'm going to get a new body amen and so we find that brother Branham said the Feast of Tabernacles is the is connected to the Millennium he taught that in numerous places so so you understand that that when Nehemiah comes for the final move to restore Israel to bring it back to its Glory that had been sacked out by Nebuchadnezzar he's going to try to rebuild Solomon's Temple as best they can even though it's not going to have as much Grandeur as that one but they're told don't despise the day of small things so so we find that brother Matt taught on that brother Matt Watkins how that you know when you when you looked at the Temple of Solomon it was so amazing so beautiful so wonderful it was it was almost like an ancient wonder of the world but yet when you find that when Jesus came he was a greater than that Temple he was that Temple personified now in him there was no Beauty to be desired is that what the scripture says he's a lowly Nazarene but yet even though his Beauty was less and his stature was less and you wouldn't naturally compare him to the Grandeur of Solomon's Temple but yet he was a greater form of it you see so so the the that's why he said don't despise the day of small things God knew what he was doing yeah and so they're they're the the elders who had saw Solomon's Temple are lamenting during the days of zerubbabel and Ezra and Nehemiah saying oh this Temple's nothing we remember the old days or and every time it gets less it's going to be more until it finally comes to Jesus Christ and it's going to be fantastic and then when he brings it into a people you know I I know we look at ourselves and we don't feel very much like the temple of God but you're a greater version of the temple of God this is why even Jesus would say more than this shall you do for I go to my father so now it's going to be Christ multiplied into the Earth amen remains calm so so we so we find then that when he comes you're going to see this now remember it's at the time the near time of the Feast of Tabernacles and he says and it came to pass in the month and the sun in the 20th year of Arctic Xerxes the king that wine was before him uh and I took up the wine Nehemiah was a cup Bearer I took up the wine and gave it unto the king now I had not been formally sad in his presence first of all that would get you killed in the in the in the Far East you didn't come before the Monarch sad you didn't even come distressed if you did they could cut your head off for that you're not supposed to do anything to distress the king he says now I had not come formerly sad in his presence wherefore the king said unto me this goes to show how much he valued Nehemiah he doesn't have him killed for it he actually has a heart of compassion he says wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing Thou Art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was very sore afraid see because now this is a death sentence and so the king is inquiring why are you in my presence sad and so he says here and and said and said unto the king let the King live forever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my father's sepulchers lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what Dost thou make request so I prayed to the god of Heaven he's praying for strength you could read that earlier on in the text he's praying for courage I mean he's taking his life in his into his hands to do this it's like it's like Esther she said if I perish I perish but I'm going to see the king and he says here um not switch okay there we go there we go so he says and I said unto the king if it pleased the king and If thy servant have found favor in thy sight that thou would Ascend me unto Judah unto the city of my father's sepulchers that I may build it and the King said unto me notice I have it underlined the queen also sitting by him that is the only place in the whole Bible that you find that statement there's nowhere else that's noted the queen also sitting with him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and I set him a time now this is exactly why when the queen which this is Esther in history even even commentators agree with that uh you find for support for that in jfb commentary particularly it's first place I ever noticed it when you do the historical math it does make perfect sense so this is Now esther Seated on the throne with the King and and she's literally it doesn't say she's speaking but it says the queen sitting with him means that she was consenting that his voice she was agreeing they were speaking in one unified voice you get that at the time of the Feast of Tabernacles which is the millennium amen so then we connect now where are we at we're just at the millennium what's the promise and the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride say come see and let him that is The Thirst say come and let him that uh and whosoever will let him come take the Water of Life freely this is the bride's privilege to offer she's the only one authorized to offer the Water of Life I remember several years ago I was preaching in Canada Pope Francis had made his uh his famous uh Jubilee announcement he was offering Jubilee to the whole world which is a going free of your debt a pardoning of all your transgression and a restoration back to the family he's basically trying to bring everybody back to Mother Rome and they asked me those Brothers there in Quebec and they said brother Jason what do you think about the Pope's uh pronouncement his proclamation of Jubilee and I said it's illegitimate and they said well what do you mean by that I said only the bride is authorized to offer Jubilee only the bride can offer the Waters of Life freely it's it's the one who has come into Unity with the spirit so now you've got king and queen seated back on the throne again see at the time of the Feast of Tabernacles so this is why we correlate king and queen and showed Nehemiah connecting to Revelation 22. now brother Branham says and I got I got I'm going to use my five minutes of overtime here so he says it is the rising of the Sun and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations uh any others has spoke of the Bride it can only uh manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him now as I've taught you before she's not literally him you don't pray to me I didn't die for you but Hebrews 13 8 is the theme of the message and that's the key to unlocking this statement she's she's the same as him she's the continuation of him does that make sense Soul so brother Branham goes on as as man and woman are one see now here we're coming back to king and queen as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she has taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him that's in tight now we're not talking about a female Holy Ghost we're talking in type all right he's correlating in type the flesh from because brother Branham said when that when that Roman spear pierced that original blood cell in his side that released the bride that released the life see even though he was dead that life was still inside the blood even though he was dead and when they pierced that tip of that same spear brother Branham said it pierced that original the one that he placed in the womb of Mary he said it pierced that original blood cell and that blood cell was a spoken word creation therefore it released the life to go into the bride therefore you are the you are born again as the literal life of almighty God you see that so so he's saying here the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the wife is the Dynamics why do you think we're praying why do you think brother Branham said that the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've operated in a small way but it's coming a big way why because he has a wife here who's the final voice who's the final example who's the final Authority amen so he said the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics this is exactly why you're going to see in this next verse this is exactly why Bible schools can't produce the life of God all they have is mechanics and they don't even understand the mechanics the engine doesn't hardly run very smooth because it's all it's not running right because they don't even understand what's supposed to be the settings and what's supposed to be operating but we find that the Bride Watch The Spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics um oh you know what I uh I didn't I didn't put it on there I should have I if you go on down and you go home today and you read it you'll find out brother Branham talks about denominational systems they have mechanics but he said at on the day of the Rapture that that the that the that the mechanics and Dynamics which is the bride when that engine gets fired up she'll go in a rapture and the other engine of man-made Creed will just sit right here and go into a tribulation because it can't get off the ground amen amen it can't get off the ground this is exactly why I said to you so whether we are preaching on whole house family values in this series or whether we're going to teach on we're teaching on it not preaching on it whether we're teaching on whole house Family Values applying the token to your home principles for a Godly marriage right
