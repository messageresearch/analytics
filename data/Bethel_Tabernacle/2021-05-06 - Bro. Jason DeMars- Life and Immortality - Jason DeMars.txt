us tonight lord anoint the word that it would come forth from from you lord to every heart that you would be glorified and lifted up father we ask in jesus christ's name amen let's uh let's just go to our opening scripture first timothy thank you excuse me second timothy chapter one and my topic tonight is gonna be life and immortality second timothy one verse nine and ten who has saved us and called us with the holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began amen but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated god is so good to us isn't he amen even even when it looks like things are very difficult and troubleless um he's good to us and uh he blesses us in so many ways sometimes he blesses us with difficulties trials and that causes us to grow amen i'm so thankful for how the lord is working in different lives and seeing seeing different ones that have come through great difficulties and trials and and now on the other side with health and strength and god is so good in each each and every step so don't don't lose hope don't grow weary continue walking forward regardless of the difficulty we've i've been doing a devotional with the the girls at night and we've been reading about the life of adenairem judson the missionary first first foreign missionary sent from america in the early 1800s and he went to burma and you want to talk about suffering and trials and difficulties it would it makes job look very simple the difficulty that ad and ireland judson faced and got god kept him through it brought him through it and through all the unbelievable heartaches and trials there's there's message believers in burma today somebody cleared the path so that i mean he might was it hard work for him clearing the if you ever get a chance to read about the life of adni judson take the tax the opportunity to it's a great blessing raise your kids up on mission missionaries and missions work feed their hearts and minds with that i believe that's that'll be a blessing to them and years to come if the lord would tarry but looking at our topic i'm really going to be looking at um life and immortality and death and destruction so it's going to be a real more like a typical teaching uh than than looking at it as an evangelistic or an encouragement but we're going to look at what is the punishment for sin we're going to look at the gift that god gives to us which is eternal life so when god placed adam and eve there in in the garden in the beginning he gave them a commandment genesis 2 verses 16 and 17 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die we're not gonna get into serpent seed on this one we may and if if this continues for part two part three how many other parts we may get into that further so uh just taking this at at the basic value face value of what it's saying is when you eat it the punishment for disobedience will be death so again adam was created as an immortal being he was made in the image and likeness of god he was a part of god that came out of god and that was eventually put in to human flesh in genesis chapter two okay and so he by he he by default had immortality but what was the punishment that he was to receive if he disobeyed death so now he is subject to death from eating from that tree of knowledge of good and evil he is subject to death god does not say the punishment for sin is eternal conscious torment in a burning hell right it says it's death so adam and eve both ate of that tree of knowledge of good and evil this resulted not only in death for them but inherited death and not only inherited death for all their their seed but an inherited sin nature for the human race and so when as in adam all die amen but that's not the end of the story even so all in christ shall be made alive so we read through the revelation of scriptures of course we do learn there is a place of punishment but that never replaces that the final punishment of sin is ultimately death so the the picture that the orthodox theological world gives you is that all souls are immortal they'll be they'll be around for all of eternity the soul will either go to hell in conscious torment for eternity or the soul will go to paradise for all eternity but this is not the picture the scripture gives so let's look at these these words immortal or incorruptible in the new testament so there's two different words in the greek new testament that are translated as immortal and so we'll look at these these words romans 2 verse 7. this word is aphtharsia which means incorruptibility which basically means unending existence so romans 2 7 to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life so we have to seek for immortality eternal life it's not the default that we have eternal life but we have to seek for eternal life first corinthians 15. verse 53 so this is the same word that was translated as immortality in romans 2 7. for this corruptable must put on in corruption and this mortal must put on immortality so you see in this verse it's using bo both of the words that are translated as immortal one is referring to incorruption and one is referring to obviously immortality so again for this corruptable must put on incorruption what is he talking about every single person that was born no he's talking about believers now again don't get mixed up and and and start relating this back to predestination it says i always had eternal life that's absolutely true but we also understand isn't it a gift it's called a gift we're given to it we're born under condemnation to sin now god in his mind in his in his eternal plan knew that you would be you would be saved and that you would enter into immortality but you're born under the condemnation of death that's why we need a savior that's why we need to be converted it isn't that just god god chose who was going to be saved and it doesn't matter what happens in this life remember paul said you have to seek for glory and honor and immortality right so it's what what am i saying i'm saying that it is a gift it's a free gift our salvation is a gift god ordained us to salvation as we read in the opening scripture it was it was fixed that we would be saved before the foundation of the world that's absolutely true and yet we are still born in sin shaped in iniquity with the condemnation of death upon us and we still have it if we don't go in the rapture we'll still die physically speaking right and we'll but we'll be raised up that's what the promise for this corruptible our body that's our body now this corruptible you and me our bodies right now are corruptable in other words we're subject to death and decay so this body will it gets older it gets weaker not like brother luther his he just keeps getting stronger seems like but for me i keep getting weaker and and the reality is we're decaying that's what's happening and it's our body this is a body that's corrupt and so this body if if we're alive and remain this body will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye if we're not it'll fall on the ground and corrupt and decay very quickly but god will take that same those molecules and we'll change them and raise them up and turn that into an incorruptible body and that is his gift that means it's not it's it's an unearned thing it's not something that we deserve it's not a payment it's his it's his free grace that he gives to us the gift of eternal life we are predestinated to it we do have it of course understand but we have to go through the process of salvation first corinthians uh next verse 54 so when this corruptable shall have put on in corruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory and then skip back two verses to verse 52 which we just referred to in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed one more place this word is used in the new testament first peter 1 verse 4 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you r it's an it's an inheritance that cannot die that cannot be decayed that is not you it can't be killed right amen all right then there's a different word used first peter 1 verse 23. we did read another one where it is also used in first corinthians 15 53 but we're just going to look at first peter 1 23. this is the word epithardos which means undecaying so first peter 1 23 says being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which lives and abides forever now these are all the places where immortal is used in the greek new testament are any of them used to refer to the state of a condemned sinner that they have an immortal soul that they will live for all eternity in conscious torment not one single place all of them are used in reference to the state of a believer when the rapture and resurrection of the saints takes place so it's the immortality what is being spoken of is not even speaking necessarily of the soul it's speaking of the whole being the body soul and spirit altogether will be raised up immortal or be changed and so this is a gift of god it is not the default of the human race we are born by default to corruption and death amen so first timothy 6 16. who alone who only this word only means soul single alone who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen so god alone the great eternal spirit is immortal no one else is immortal because why it says he alone soul single alone is immortal all right john 5 26 for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself so this father is the source of life now he's put that life in his son all right then first john chapter 5 verse 12 he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life amen so that immortality is placed in the son of god and then we being in christ we receive that life through christ so god being alone immortal passing that life down to his family first corinthians 1 30 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption amen so we were when were we chosen in christ before the foundation of the world we were in the thoughts of god for all of eternity we're a part of him a part of his life we had to come in to this flesh right god wanted to make himself tangible that's why he made adam and eve right he wanted to make himself tangible he wanted to reveal himself and also to make himself known so the people that he reveals himself to he also reveals himself through them okay and so god's purpose was to pass that life down satan came and what put a hybrid now that life is hybridized and we learn through the scriptures up through the time of the flood the life becomes completely hybridized we're in in the whole human race is subject to death and decay and that life now is simply a predestinated spiritual life a family can you know bring forth three godly children and and one ungodly children i mean we look through the scriptures jacob and esau right right in the same family the same exact parents why because we're all hybrid and the true predestined life comes by only by election amen and so still we're subject to death we sin we're worthy of god's punishment god through his beautiful plan brings forth his son comes in the form of his son sheds his blood and dies so that we can be forgiven but not only that so that the image and lightness which man was originally made in which was perverted which was broken by sin can be restored and he does it in two ways first he gives us the holy ghost and that re that we're now uh transformed by the renewing of our mind we're now being washed by the washing of the water of the word and then the second way that he does that he does what he's going to give us a new body a perfect body an immortal body and then we're going to go even further he's going to take this earth where the whole earth is subject to death decay what is he going to do he's going to revitalize just like he's going to revitalize these atoms with life he's going to revitalize this earth with life so that in the end he has what he planned perfectly from the beginning which was an immortal god with an immortal family on a perfect earth and he what did he want to do he wanted to he allowed it he created it in such a way so that it could and would fall so that we would be subject to death why so he could reveal himself and we could love him for all that he is the world doesn't like that thought they don't like that idea that's right it's not forum god's predestinated seed just say wow thank you lord i just want to be a part of it of course we're familiar talking about immortality john 3 16 we understand that eternal life is a gift romans 6 23 the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord it's a gift it's a gift it's not we we deserve we really do deserve it's not just a mockery of the word we really do deserve death we deserve the punishment that is to come for sinners but god made a way and he gave us that gift and all we have to do is accept the gift you don't have to do anything you don't have to work yourself up just to say thank you lord i receive what you've given so brother branham says there's one only one form of eternal life in the sermon thirsting for life 1957 he says everything that has a beginning has an end and it's things that had no beginning that has no end and there's only one eternal life that's in god all other life has an end but god has no end because he had no beginning and we being parts of god have eternal life with god but everything that has any other type of life had a beginning it has an end only the eternal things last now the word forever comes in a conjunction forever and forever forever is a space of time but eternity is no begin or end it's just a perfect circle there's no end to it at all it's eternity forever like you see forever and conjunction forever two spaces of time but eternity and eternal life means the same thing see it's the same category that it had no begin neither does it have an end it's forever the same ever was and ever will be the same amen so the english definition which brother branham applied to eternal then we understand is no beginning and no ending that's the definition the prophet defines what eternal means eternal means eternity which had no beginning or has no end so let's let's look at that with that understanding let's look at the scriptures that use this word in different ways now in the greek there's two different words um that can be translated as eternal one is ion and one is ionios all right so and i'm not going to read the definition of each of them because if you just simply take it at face value that these things mean eternal okay as people describe them to be you'll see the absurdity of translating the words to mean having no beginning or no ending or even if you just take it like some theologians take it no ending okay it's you'll see how absurd that thought is so colossians 1 26. even the mystery which has been hid from eternity and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints what so just just to break it down when i'm saying eternity hid from the ages that's the word i i own all right so if we're going to take ion to mean eternal then we're going to insert every time it says i on we're going to just say eternal even the mystery which has been from eternity the mystery has been hid from eternity no they've properly translated it ages a period of time ephesians 1 21. far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this eternity but also in that which is to come not only in this age it's referring to an age there's multiple ages this age and the age to come ii timothy 4 10. for demas has forsaken me having loved this present eternity and has departed unto thessalonica et cetera this present eternity this present age this present world first corinthians 2 7. but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before eternity unto our glory before it that doesn't not going to work before the world or before the ages hebrews 5 6. as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for eternity after the order of melchizedek i mean it could possibly work but the reality is he's a high priest during redemption he's interceding during redemption when we when we're all immortal on a new earth there's not a need for a priest anymore right during the millennium sure there is we're we are kings and priests we're now kings and priests and we will be in the millennium too matthew 13 verse 40. as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of eternity it doesn't work again you see present and beginning all attached to this word ion which we're told means at the very least no ending all right so then ionios is the other word and i'll read you the definition of this without beginning and end that which always has been and always will be without beginning or without end second peter 1 11. for sow an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ i mean that could work that could work but if you're looking at the millennium where where christ has his kingdom sits on the throne of his father david it's a period of time it's a thousand years and then at the end of that time he gives up he he relinquishes that all all dominion is put under his feet then he hands it over to the father and so that the father and so that god will be all in all so his kingdom has a beginning has an ending a millennial kingdom romans 16 25. now of him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since eternity began no it doesn't work eternity doesn't begin ages begin jude 1 7 even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire here it's translated as eternal fire can i ask a question are they still be are they still burning in the city of sodom today how long did the fire last it was pretty quick right it did its job it burned them completely totally so here we are even looking at this verse taking it at face value we have to understand what is this fire what is this eternal fire it's god god is the eternal fire god reigned down from heaven brimstone from god that's what that's what the that's what the verse says he rained down the brim so they suffered the vengeance of eternal fire if we're going to understand fire that has no beginning and no ending we understand that when that it was burning those people sodom was burning before the world began and it's continuing to burn why can't they they don't even know really the location today where sodom and gomorrah is it should be easy to find they're still burning their corpses are there still lit on fire that's not what eternal fire means it means it burns up until it consumes completely matthew 25 46. and these shall go away into everlasting punishment to put the righteous into life eternal all right so these are two greek words both translated sometimes as eternal sometimes as worlds sometimes as ages you can see that it's basically its meaning and its translation changes depends on depending on what it's used in conjunction for amen so if it's used speaking about eternal life or eternal god or eternal spirit we can understand by the word that it's used in conjunction with what what that word means right if it's talking about eternal life okay well what is the what is the teaching of eternal life we understand it means there's we were in god for all of eternity we come we're born here we experience the baptism of the holy spirit and we live on for with no end for all of eternity but other places it's translated in such a way where you understand it's referring to a period of time so when it's talking about punishment what the scripture we just read everlasting punishment okay it's the same exact word that's used there in english it's a different word in the greek it's both ionian okay so it's both ionian so if the theologian would say if the reward is without end so is the punishment without end no we have to know the context of what what the scripture teaches about the subject all right and let's let's look at some of those scriptures mark 9 43 and 44. and if the hand offend thee cut it off it's better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched i want you to look at the the verse though closely the worm and the fire don't die so what is it saying it's not saying that the person doesn't die it's saying the worm and the fire don't die why is it saying that because the worm and the fire will destroy until nothing's left obviously when you're talking about worm you're talking about a literal grave right so there's a literal grave where your this physical body goes to but there's also a place where the lost go to we see that in the in the parable of the rich man and lazarus there's a place where they go but what is what does fire do why would they use fire can i ask you a question when you put a log in the fire what does it do does it last for all eternity i started a fire in my backyard it's still going i don't know it'll never go out no it fire consumes until nothing is left worms consume until nothing is left so get the picture right the worm and the fire don't die because they consume until nothing is left isaiah 66 24 this is where this verse is taken where that quote that jesus just spoke he's taking that from isaiah 66. 24 and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be abhorring unto all flesh okay so this is talking about the judgment that takes place upon jerusalem all right the end of the tribulation period so what is the picture that's being painted that there's dead bodies and there's fire and there's worms consuming these bodies so does that mean that the we're literally going to be going through all of eternity and there's going to be dead bodies laying all around and we're going to be looking at worms eat them and fire burning that would not be paradise right it what is what is being paint what picture is being being painted here what we just spoke of there's an utter destruction and it's going to be a there this is talking about there there's going to be a memory of that but thank god the memory of it is not going to be eternal it doesn't need to be eternal matthew 10 28. and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell very simple very simple beautiful verse if it's if to kill is to deprive the body of life then hell would seem to be to deprive both the physical and the spiritual life that is an annihilation or an extinction of being that's the picture that's being painted god will take a person out of existence don't fear the one that can just destroy kill the body feel the one that fear the one that can kill the body and also snuff the soul's life out of it questions and answers on hebrews number one 1957 brother banham says he'll die he'll go to a lake of fire and brimstone which burns where burning is going on forever and forever and maybe for a hundred million years his soul may be tormented in a lake of fire and brimstone you say will it be just like regular brimstone i believe it'll be a million times worse than that believe you couldn't describe it by fire by a literal fire the only reason it's put by fire that fire is the most consuming thing that we had it absolutely consumes and destroys everything fire does amen so let's look at those who refuse to believe the gospel what what does the bible say about them first corinthians 1 18. i'm just going to read quick through these brother brad for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but to un unto us which are saved it is the power of god so how did he describe those who consider the cross foolishness he said that they are them that perish ii corinthians 2 15 for we are unto god a sweet savior of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish ii thessalonians 2 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they re they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved romans 6 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord matthew 7 13 enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there at so if hell is eternal then those who perish never perish those who are destroyed are never destroyed and those that die never die but the scripture speaks of the punishment of those who don't believe as death that is what god promised in the beginning the day you eat thereof that day you die the punishment for uncovered sin is death revelation 20 14. and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death so what is the first death the ceasing of physical existence so then what is the second death ceasing of spiritual existence as jesus said fear him that can destroy both body and soul in hell revelation 20 verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever again these from ion to ion from age to age again so this these this is the devil so a spiritual being the beast the beast is a uh is an empire but what is behind it it's it's a spirit and the false prophet again a person but yet there's a spirit behind it an antichrist spirit behind it and so these spirits will be cast into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone and what is it they'll be tormented in day and night forever and ever from age to age for a long period of time brother branham says it could be millions and billions of years but it has to come to an end because what is it it's the second death malachi 4 1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch everything will be burnt up and consumed 1959 questions and answers brother branham says i don't believe the bible teaches an eternal burning hell it doesn't because hell if hell is eternal and people that go there will be punished eternally the only way they could be eternally punished they'd have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's in god see so they have to come to an annihilation see that is their physical part becomes annihilated and then their spiritual part becomes annihilated that's completely consumed there's no more to it neither in root nor branch the bible calls it they're completely done away so exodus 21 23-25 says and if any mischief follow then thou sh thou shalt give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe so think about this a crime committed is a crime committed in time worthy of eternal conscious punishment it isn't it isn't god would be meeting out a punishment that was not in line with his own divine justice ezekiel 18 verse 4 behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die amen the soul that sins is going to die that's exactly what he said to adam he's a faithful god he's not going to change the punishment at the end the the punishment is death so again immortality is not no longer the default now adam was created with immortality of a body he lost it it's not the default for you and me that's why you see we there's gray in our beards and on our on our head why because we're not immortal we're we're dying we're getting old we're getting weaker we'll go if the lord tarries many of us will go to the grave right that's because of sin but that which is on the inside of you and i is redeemed amen but that which is on the outside is not redeemed yet we're waiting still waiting for the redemption of our bodies and that's a gift that's a gift given and revealed through jesus christ alone he is the only way so as we as we read hell is described using darkness fire destruction perishing death what it why all of that is pictures of annihilation it's not pictures of conscience conscious torment if the bible wanted to say you're going to be eternally and consciously tormented it can say that but it's not the picture that it gives every picture that it gives is showing this god is going to bring the wicked life to a complete and god's judgment is eternal god's fire is eternal but the conscious torment is not eternal those cast into hell will eventually obviously as we stated before be annihilated why because they do not possess eternal life god's judgment calls for death physical and spiritual death we we are we are receivers of god's grace musicians if you come amen well last week we got an extra long sermon and this week we got an extra short one so we just even it out for everybody but it you know i in studying this and looking at uh different theologians through history um i'm just amazed at how the lord dealt with brother branham um time and time again you know some people they study theology and it takes them away from the message the more i study it personally this is just for me i'm not saying that everybody should be this way but personally just for me as i study it i just go thank you lord for a vindicated prophet he pierces through you don't even understand and thank god you probably don't you don't really understand all the difficult thorny hard theological issues that peop that people have battled over over the years that brother branham just comes with real simple it's a finish things like it's a finished work at calvary well you realize how what that you don't even realize what that means you just say oh praise the lord it's a finished work at calvary that is answering a question that pentecostals divided over and fought over for so long and things like this you know you you there's people that there's people that believe like jehovah's witnesses they don't believe in hell at all they believe it's all um metaphorical they believe that when you die you go to the grave either you're going to stay in the grave or you're going to be resurrected right and so people will come and say oh you know they'll accuse say he doesn't believe any eternal hell william branham doesn't believe in eternal hell he's a false a false teacher well brother branham brings such a balanced truth on this topic you know many there's many theologians that bring well hell's eternal there's other ones say there isn't even any hell at all brother branham brings that perfect balance there is a hell there is a place that unbelievers go to right now right but it's not eternal because they they would have to be immortal and on god only gives immortality as a gift to those that believe in jesus christ amen let's pray heavenly father we thank you so much for your word it truly is light and life to us lord i thank you lord for sending the vindicated profit to us lord it's not about the man it's not about following a man lord it's how you've chosen to reveal yourself but it's about the truth that you use that man to bring lord in such a humble and simple way to cut through all the nonsense to bring us the reality of christ in this day lord and all these things this this topic we're studying tonight it's it's a part of a beautiful picture of redemption that you've restored and painted for us lord everything
