Hemm of His Garment if as we keep our heads bowed I wonder who would lift up your hand and say Lord I would like for you to speak to me tonight I would like for you to move in my life and the situation don't speak between the lines talk to us personally Lord May the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit come by this address in Buford South Carolina Lord many hands are lifted up I didn't even look I didn't even open my eyes but sensing and knowing by the word Lord there's needs among us and we believe that Jesus is here we believe the angel of the Lord that love that song is whirling through this building the pillar of fire the angels have taken our request and you know Lord each one of us and I'm asking tonight that every Spirit would be brought under the direct control of the Holy Spirit every body every spirit and every soul would just be subject to the Lord Jesus Christ I pray that all nervousness would leave any demon Spirit would leave or any Dark Cloud would leave the congregation those that are streaming or those that will ever stream this service May the presence of Jesus Christ come into the room come into the car come into the office visit bethl Tabernacle tonight May tonight be a night that is circled on your calendar of you dealing deeply within our lives we want to lay aside foolishness lay aside carnality lay aside our own thoughts Heavenly Father you are in control take over this service right now for the glory of God in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen thank you musicians you thank you very much amen I'm going to let you have your seats for a moment I'd like to uh share with you something on the screen in just a moment the brothers can bring that up for us did you enjoy the day the rain that was forecasted for the the day is coming down now Hallelujah glory to God the Lord really loves you a lot he had this whole day planned and pre-planned and it could have been rainy a few hours ago the sun was out it was a nice day and we enjoyed the presence of God and with you and and it's just so wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Matthew and sister Rachel and to um your lives brother Jason and sister Debbie Watkins and to the team at bethl Tabernacle I wonder if every person from bethl Tabernacle if you could just stand to your feet we'd like to thank you tonight as a congregation just stand go ahead come on anyone that attends bethl Tabernacle God bless you tonight amen thank you Jesus amen thank you very much and I know thank you I know there's some that aren't here because they gave up their space so that you could be here and they might be streaming or we'll catch the service at another time and to all the visitors and um travelers from hours away I understand after the service that some from North Carolina are going to be driving five hours five and a half hours to be back because they are are needed at their church and from Florida they're going to leave after this service t tonight to be driving back and And We Salute You amen and uh you know that means in the middle of the night they're going to be getting back home and so I I I hope that this isn't a fast food drivethru but I just pray the Lord Jesus will come and minister to you tonight in a special way I just feel the Lord Jesus is going to be here very special as you sense his nearness who sense his nearness right now and sister Rachel Watkins wherever you are um the desire that you had to post messages all over your home before this the services of I will restore these meetings is God answering that cry hallelujah thank you Jesus and so I just want to read with you a quote of brother brandom if you just put that up brother slide number one and then we're going to turn to the book of Acts chapter 2 This was um after the seals in June 1st brother brandham was with some young people uh one of uh sister Rebecca brandom Smith's friends was um graduating and they were having a graduation and brother brandham spoke this to those that were gathered in that service Lord Jesus we are grateful for this time to know that we're assembled here the young and old and the middle-aged and we have assembled this side of Eternity once more to speak about you and about the things that pertains to everlasting life and these young ones sitting in here tonight some of them are graduating and some have have already graduated but I realize Lord something that happened this is June and we know something happened in the mountains there and February and March as those angels came down and brother brandham went back and preached the opening of The Seven Seals but he said he's remembering this at a youth meeting amen I realized Lord something that happened just a few hours before that great shock or great blast had taken place in the mountain up there north of Tucson when the angels of the Lord came down I remember what was said and especially about the young people amen and I pray thee Lord to help us to understand and may I be able to say something to these young folks tonight that will help them along the journey for Lord we all need that help at this time I wonder tonight if we could just agree when brother brandom I'm trying to go back maybe you could go back to the first side Brothers for us The Young and the old and the middleaged that were gathered but he's remembering when those angels came down and when the angels of the Lord came down I remember what was said and especially about the young people who would like to know what was on the heart of God when he was coming down Hallelujah must have been something very sacred for a prophet to remember that when he was with young people he had a burden for them and so tonight as we stand to our feet and turn to Acts chapter 2 that is our title Upper Room youth Lord Upper Room Youth and so now let's just go together into the presence of the the Lord and let the door close behind us from anything that might be in your heart or in your mind let's just let the Lord have his way I believe tonight's service is ordained of the Lord and I believe the atmosphere is just right for the supernatural to happen Acts chapter 2 most of you know in verse one that the day of Pentecost had ful come which was 50 days and they were all together in one place and the Holy Ghost fell amongst them I I would just love for that to happen tonight just all of us would be filled not just the elders or the ones in the back but from the youngest to the oldest there could be such a Harmony and such a flowing of the Holy Spirit that no matter what any person has gone through that the great physician that would be able to deal with every case so personal and even someone on the internet could just pull God so strongly you wonder why brother John might go in a direction maybe that's for somebody that's crying out like a sheep just crying out and I believe he's he's in the building tonight our lord Jesus is near so now verse 14 is where we want to start the holy spirit is poured out upon 120 and people were mocking them and saying they are have new wine but Peter verse 14 standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be it this known unto you and hearken to my words this is the same Peter that just a few days before was cursing swearing saying I don't even know the man and just 50 days later less than two months he's busting out of a room saying give me the microphone that's what it was saying I got something to say and I'll give that much grace for any person here you might be a coward backsliding demon-possessed have a religious spirit on you just in a matter of days you could be a totally different person what God did for that book of Acts church and what happened in the upper room here We Are Tonight Upper Room youth am the same blessing is on you same promisees unto you and your children you don't need to tear and wait it just while you're in the service the atmosphere just yield to it now I already know the devil's nervous because he already knows brother John's notes all of our slides and uh and the Lord Jesus knows exactly what he wants to say tonight the devil's nervous so don't you get nervous I'm not nervous I'm just fine praise the Lord I'm like a doctor that's just walked into a room and I'm all alone with you and the nurse has done the thing and you've checked in we all checked in tonight right don't check out we're all checked in and we're just waiting we're just waiting on the Lord to come and speak to us here's Peter says I've got something to say verse 15 these young people or these people that you see are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that is that what the Bible says this that you see going on is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel We read that last night in Joel yeah chapter 2 and if brother John would have been a better preacher I would have got all through in one service and it would have been a very nice package brother Jason you when I grow up I'll be able to preach nice but Joel chapter 2 was a prophecy of Joel I will restore amen now it's happening in the congregation young people old people and and Peter is recognizing what you see going on this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel amen so tonight I'm announcing to you this that is happening in Buford South Carolina is that which was spoken by our Prophet William brandham the angel our Elijah I'm going to send you a messenger that before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord God loves us all so much the Youth of this message he loves you so much he's going to bring you into an upper room and fill all of you heal all of you this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days how many believe we're in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so he didn't ask them where you're going to be living your situation what you've all gone through he's just giving a promise I will pour out my spirit and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will let's say I will I will who's speaking the same God as in Joel said I will restore it's come now in the book of Acts and he's in the building tonight saying I will I will I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy verse 19 and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come verse 21's our last verse before you're seated I want you to notice this verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen and what is the name of the Lord let's all say it Jesus Lord Jesus we're calling on you tonight God bless you you can have your seats as our brothers just prepare for that first slide please Upper Room youth I hear the creaking of a bed as it's being rolled down the hallway does anybody else hear that I hear a creaking of a bed as it's being rolled down a hallway and I hear screams and I hear groans there's cries because the patient is in pain if you would look on their face it would be kind of Twisted because there's Agony there just go to the slide the third slide I see Agony on the face of the patient something traumatic has happened we're we're in a hospital we're in a place place where wounds are taken care of I see the person being wheeled down the hallway and the creaking of the wheels is being overcome but there's blood there's breaking there's a breaking that has taken place there's a hurting something traumatic something has hit the outside and it's caused a wound we're passing the birthing room yeah we're not in the Pediatric section that is birthing where there's groans of mothers there's groans of there's New Life coming forth some are happy some are sad but they're groaning and groaning we're passing the birthing part we're passing that experience we're going now there's another patient there's another need that is present amen we're in a hospital how many know that special me meetings like this and church is like a hospital how many know that it's just not always time to praise the Lord and worship and hear song Services that's part of a service but special meetings and church services especially like we're having this weekend for young people I want to welcome you to the wound healing center tonight right we're going to go into places that aren't normally visited amen because that's the need of the hour that's the need that that's where we're walking tonight in sacred Sands of your life when great uh times of your life and so now as the person is wheeled into a room I see a doctor grabbing his coat and throwing it on he looks a little Haggard his eyes his eyeg glasses you know he he just dressed you know he's just throwing things and putting it on and he comes into the room to attend to the patient because help is needed amen we need someone with experience someone that that knows and so the patient isn't worried about the doctor's glasses all right he's not worried about his hair he doesn't know whether the the the doctor has a good marriage or a bad marriage has no children or five children or drives a BMW or walk to the hospital hospital that day they didn't really care right now they're in a lot of pain there's a lot of suffering going on the nurses are coming in and out and they're trying to attend and stop the blood and stop the bleeding and how did this happen you know and who's that fault you know those are all questions that come later right now it's very urgent amen this is a serious case are we all together tonight this is like blood is going and breaking and things are hurting and help is needed and and here the doctor begins to know by looking at the case that it's not just going to be an immediate thing it's but there going to take some time to heal and set this arm or set this situation or you know we're not here to put blame right tonight we're not here to talk about who ran the stop sign we're not here to talk about whose fault it was there's a serious case we're not here to talk about your mother or your father or your brother or your sister or the Deacon or the pastor tonight we we stand in need as individuals sometimes we need to break through all the facade and we need to say like the song says it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's not my brother or my sister or the Deacon or the trustee it's me oh Lord maybe you try to hide it maybe you try to you'd be embarrassed but the blood's dripping out of your skirt amen maybe you don't want nobody to know but God squeezes your heart and you begin to cry maybe you begin to shake and you wonder why is this going on get control of yourself get control of yourself get control of yourself I want to say something right now I just want to deal with something about tears and crying the world says a real man don't cry that's a lie real men cry real young people cry real real ladies when they get close to God they get vulnerable amen amen but as you pass through this place and came into this room the wound healing Center there's a sign out front that is the wound healing Center so you're not going to McDonald's or Chick-fil-A right a red rooster you know we're not going to a university we're not visiting our friends the sign outdoor says it's the wound healing Center that's exactly what you need amen so we pass the receptionist just maybe someone else would say I don't need a a wheelchair I don't need a cot I don't need a bed brother John but so you walk past the receptionist and you go into the waiting room you sit down and you're just waiting that's kind of like brother John's doing right now I'm just waiting amen we we've had a day of volleyball and softball and being together and it's it was hot it's cooler in here tonight how many can say thank you Jesus so now somebody had the air conditioning right and it was a facility bethl Tabernacle we got an invitation to come here it doesn't take away our wounds amen amen it's up to the doctor to help us with that and get us back on a road yeah amen but now it's time to go past the waiting room you go down the hallway you go into this personal room and maybe you wait maybe you've got to take some of your garments off maybe you got to leave your pride yeah come on maybe you got to leave your arrogancy and I got this all together you know I got this hello I got this and life was good until and now you're broken now you're crushed now you're not looking around the room at everybody's sandals now you don't really care who sings the song special and you don't even know the preacher and you really don't care about him or his grandchildren or his wife or anything about you're trying to touch Jesus it doesn't matter if if this whole ceiling falls down you got to get to Jesus it doesn't matter if the electricity goes off in five minutes we're going to have church tonight we're in the wound healing Center work you know sometimes it takes something dramatic to get our attention life is good and life is going along and but then all of a sudden something happen it's like a blow it's like a hurt comes but all of a sudden as you're in this hospital gown that's kind of revealing and embarrassing you know you're not all dressed fancy look nice and the the the doctor knocks on the door your life is like an open book but as he begins to take up your case and look through the fine prints and things and gets the details he he deals with you kindly you're spoken to and you're helped and there's some communication that goes on and maybe it's not what you wanted to hear yeah amen maybe you thought it's like let's get out of here let get get me out of here and I'm back to school and I'm back to church and and you might hear words like this might take months to heal you we can a doctor can set an arm a nurse can give you medicine life isn't always about miracles sometimes as Believers we want Miracles but God may say this might take a little bit of time and some even of you tonight don't even believe that you just think it's going to be like that and if it don't happen like that but even now in this service we're all just waiting we're being healed God heals by music God heals by love just a little bit of love stretched out over a situation can bring a lot of healing just someone to shake your hand with some feeling and look you in the face and say God bless you brother God bless you Sister can give you a lot of Courage cuz you've been in the dungeons of Despair you've been living in the Gloom of your negative realm and God's got it all he knows all about it and he looks beyond all the pain and he says I believe that you're going to be okay amen and he begins to talk to you like this and the doctor leaves and you dress [Applause] yourself look at this tonight some of you maybe are at different stages of a healing in your life amen and there's things that maybe you're okay tonight maybe you're 100% fine and all is good but maybe the person right next to you is suffering maybe there's someone here that is really going through and they need the great physician to go beyond all the outside and oh we can put up such a front yes how you doing I'm doing good I'm doing fine and you're not doing fine you know what I mean all's good I got this I'm I got it and you don't got nothing you're falling apart you're like one one more thing happen can push you right over the edge and the devil knows that so he wants to push you over the edge and God says I'm going to be there to catch them yes amen some us get so self-righteous and think we got it all together do you know brother branham's own son was smoking at 15 years old he's a a teenager and he's smoking and brother brandham didn't even know about it until the angel of the Lord told him am see that's bad parenting that's bad well he's the prophet to the age and his own son is smoking you might be doing drugs tonight and nobody knows you might be involved in looking at things or acting in certain ways and you got your parents fooled you got the pastor fooled and you're just going down the road and you're going straight to hell and if the Rapture would happen you wouldn't go sometimes the doctor can get a little Stern amen we got to be open tonight we we got to be able to be raw with one another and lay our little petty feelings up at the altar and just say God do to me whatever you know needs to happen I mean how long are you going to keep living alive sir amen I've asked young people this question I passed it out with a piece of paper anonymously if the Rapture would happen today would you go and you'd be shocked yeah to know what young people raised in the message from good families when they answer honestly without their name being written I don't need to know your name I just wanted to know kind of where we're at I just kind of wanted to know how we're doing and to get back a response that a majority either don't know or know they already know I just pray the Lord Jesus would give us a chance before he comes back amen just make our calling and election sure and fill us with the Holy Spirit and but some of you have been born and that's why I passed that room I passed the birthing room because now you've had a experiences with God and you've been to camps and you have a church or you've been down the road yeah amen tonight I'm dealing in another area if that's okay so

going with this yeah amen well now you're walking out I don't know maybe you feel relieved maybe you get in your car maybe your parents drove you and you're just like it's not terminal yeah you thought it was horrible you thought it was going to end in catastrophe yeah and God said you know what you're going to be okay I I've been through this before with other of my sheep and my sons and daughters and there's help for you this is what we need to do it is no secret what God can do what he's done for others he'll do for this generation Hallelujah you walk out the front door and it's time for you to leave the the wound healing Center you got to go back to school you got to go back to your church tomorrow Monday you got to go back to life yeah and and Lord I don't want to be empty no more I don't want to go back with this same injury with no strength and no consolation we s Jesus is here amen there's nothing wrong with saying where are you Lord amen I'm getting down there tonight I'm getting some into your thoughts Lord if this message is true I need you to reveal it to me hello somebody have anybody ever thought that before what what's wrong with a person saying God if you s an Elijah and it's brother brandham then reveal that to me I need a revelation have any of you prayed Lord give me a love for your word and for your presence has has anybody here ever prayed Lord I'm not where I ought to be has anybody here ever got down on your knees and said Lord I feel like I'm backsliding has any of you ever been open enough I mean we sing Sweet Hour of Prayer some of you don't even have a clue what that means other than a song up on the screen it's 5 minutes it's it's you know as I'm running out the door God help us give us Upper Room youth that can t that can wait [Applause] until am brother John's just waiting a little bit until we all begin to accept that often times it takes months to get a complete healing and we're dealing with scars yes we're dealing with things that happen in our lives and all it's a change of attitude tonight a scar is showing that healing has taking place amen right when you have a scar it's something visual but it could be in in emotions where you just can't get past this yeah am it it it doesn't matter how good the music is how good the preacher is you know who won the volleyball tournament come on congratulations my wife lost the final game but she was the most spirited because I heard the number one team was all rigged and stacked with really good guys good guys that are my loudest am manners tonight Hallelujah and all the girls that were cheering for their favorite young man are just on the cheering tonight Hallelujah they got the sparkle on their eye and they're saying yes where we going with this well I'm expecting some to walk out of this service and never be the same again [Applause] I I'm taking my time too you see this was an injury that happened that almost got this person just a little bit further it would have been over yeah you know there are young people that woke up this morning and will not see the sunset tonight that's right amen it's it's after 8:00 I think they won't see the sunset in less than seven days there's going to be a few people maybe gathered around a little graveside or a little place and and somebody's going to be shoveling in dirt less than a week and I'm not being drama King I'm being serious some of you have been to camps and things where we've had young men sitting right on the front row never made it through the next few days is that true they made it to Monday night or Tuesday night practice musician practice they never made it home we've had young ladies come to the meetings and come to camp meetings and never make it back home so I'm not being drama King amen I'm being real amen am it's time that we stop the wheels that are turning in the direction that it's going and ask the Holy Spirit you say well nothing's going to stop that freight train where that young man's headed where that young lady's headed tonight that's a lie from the devil I I see a bunch of Sparks I hear a bunch of noise I hear the angel of the Lord standing in front of that freight train saying you just blasted through a bunch of stock stop signs blasted through a bunch of yield signs but I'm here to stop you in the name of the Lord hallelujah and we've got a church full of supporters and brothers and sisters that are cheering you on in your last lap we don't want you to miss the Rapture I I don't want you to Bear a wound and be bearing something in your life and misunderstanding that that was God's judgment on your life and that if you had the Holy Ghost this would never happen to you or some of you misunderstand that yeah right bad things happen to good [Music] people it's something that happened a scar is is showing that something happened in your past but it didn't take your life and this is a burn I have it on the screen it's a burn that happened to someone that they were treated and after 121 days that's four months later you can see on the right hand side can everyone see that on the screen some of you look bored tonight y'all doing okay now the person on the left you would never ask them to come up and sing a special tonight they're not going to get the microphone and show off a bunch of blood and everybody would just be like what what's the sister doing like she needs help I'm making a point right now we wouldn't have asked that group to sang tonight if if they're standing here singing and and then blood started dripping off their dress some of you would she needs help it's embarrassing some something's not normal here and some of you would respond quicker you would just can we help brother Jason did you see that can we help that than we do to spiritual needs that sit right Among Us they sit right here and some of us would get if there were drips of water coming through here from this rain that this thunderstorm that's happening outside do y'all hear that yeah we would be getting hailes everywhere instead of saying Lord what's causing that drip on what caused that blood don't you know what caused this on this brother or sister we it's it's the mind of Christ to turn our attention they need healing they need Deliverance they don't need someone to put a little a little bit of something and say I hope that it comes down and gets in there we got a problem here no we'd have deacons we'd have putting tarps out we don't want it to be a distraction this this is our second meeting it's over after tonight for some they're driving in North Carolina they're driving to Florida don't you want them to receive something tonight after tomorrow all of it's over it's history it's like wow do y'all want to have this again next year but it's like a memory it's like something that happened it was an experience but tonight it might be four months later and it just looks like it's not normal but it's a scar it's evidence that you made it through all right that's how a lot of us are going to look when the Rapture happens we made it [Applause] too I'm speaking about upper room youth I I really had this and I even wrote it down what was the youth like on the day of Pentecost the young people that were were in that room and the youth today that are in the message I I believe if they were filled with the same Spirit would have the same nature do yall believe that they young ladies young men they would have the same life and the same character Amen in the upper room they were just waiting God help us amen I hope we wouldn't have been sitting over in the corner texting uhoh I'm come on man it's nine days where's the action that's good for my mom it's good for my dad you know I had to come to CH and we get in at it like it's nine days this a bad attitude instead of Leaning forward and saying oh God it's been nine days when where is the promise of your power where how long is this going to go Lord but on the 10th day it happened and those young people if you read Acts 2 all of them were filled with the Holy Ghost amen so the 10 days prepared them yes for whatever God was going to do don't you want to be Upper Room youth that came busting out of there filled with the Holy Ghost I'm ready to take on whatever God has for us they they weren't talking about everybody running in the garden and everybody can't pray for an hour and y'all know what I'm talking about and oh you know Judas did this they weren't talking about people that left the message and we're not setting up a committee to go after them it's the holy spirit that has to go after them I mean I'm very aware of people that weren't even in the church services but there begin to be a move of of the Holy Ghost and God doing something God brought his predestinated to the house of God there are people streaming this service right now that you don't know streaming they clicked on they they're not here tonight but they're interested and God could do something for them wherever they're at and some of you are sitting right in this building and don't know what's going on you're you're hesitant you're like what and and God's just doing something they're just trembling they're just like and Bloods may be dripping off their skirt spiritually I say God awaken [Applause] us somebody sent me this oh I already have it on the screen look at that most of us think that our plan is going to be on the top there on I give my heart to the Lord I'm saved and when I really get it that's going to be my life from now to the Rapture to The Checkered Flag it's all going to be smooth just it's a lie from the devil God's plan is usually like the bottom part is this on the internet for all those people out there we're not preaching a easy believe be a Christian it's going to be all smooth quite the contrary it's going to be down in the valley it's going to be times you need a ladder you can't just be a uh you know work this all through by yourself and you're going to have to work with the team yes amen come on and there's some of you that are very good at doing things by yourself that's why golfers are so a certain way CEOs of come I mean loners and eagles they fly by themselves and they you know they might mate for life but they don't need the crowd and then you got people that just go with the flow they just go with the crowd they're just what whatever's good whatever's feel and we need some young people that can go against the grain that can go against the current God turn it around tonight some of us are like jellyfishes we just go down I've been at so many youth meetings and they just kind of like I said last night they look down the road how's so and so taking this how's she taking this and how is he going to how is he responding you know and you know if somebody don't respond that's their friend they're just kind of tightening it up you know and then I'm not going to respond either that's my friend you you don't know that person a week from now might have totally walk away from God then who's going to be your [Music] friends God might give you a friend this weekend some of you have been praying for that but you got to be friendly you can't be a cactus and wonder why nobody loves you why why don't people walk in the room and just want to be around you you're a cactus you're talking negative about everyone there's always an issue with everyone there every situation every meeting it's always the weather now it's going to be the rain now the food and I'm sick and I get enough sleep [Applause] and you know I'm too fat I'm too skinny yeah I'm not beautiful nobody loves me and sometimes we need a boat in the middle of the sto that's how we're going to get across then life and it goes down it goes up and then sometimes right before the end time it's raining and thunderstorms and it just like it's trying to wash down and you're like I got to get up this mountain yeah well where are you going to go back to where you going to go to is the world any better come on help me out tonight are we are we on the same team we're on the winning team the word is able to change somebody's heart tonight just while you're sitting in his presence he can just convince you hallah the great Physician's talking to you right now brother John's holding myself back I'm being very disciplined because this kind of sign isn't going to be hanging in your room please limit each office visit to one or two issues it's not hanging at bethl Tabernacle tonight nobody fire the secretary that would even think like that or we're too busy we make so much money if we get them in and get them out assembly line and you know they they that's the quotes they want to listen to you know 20 minutes 30 minutes and they're already looking at their they're already clocked out well just clock out we got another issue here and we got an open heart surgery it don't take 10 minutes hello somebody sometimes you got to take the heart out and literally lay it on the table then you got to work with some things and work some valves the heart isn't beating right God knows your heart needs to be turned he knows there's issues in our lives I'm standing here tonight as his servant and what's coming out of my mouth is healing somebody it's the power of the spoken word it's what brother brandham when he heard on the mountain and especially for the young people is what we need to hear for a Rapture it's not all about the birthing room you got wheeled past there and you're in another room there was a wound in your life life there's a hurt there's a scar there's blood oh yeah there's things have been said there's people that's left your church there's damage in some of your families your dad said something it sticks in your mind your mother said something good or bad on I pray God erase out of our minds tonight erase out of our experience just hit the delete button control block just a all the years sister Rachel all the years hallelujah it's just taking a little time sister Jean to get down page page page page page all the years that the Locust have tried to eat away at your life hit the delete [Applause] button hit the button hit the button I better not press that button the internet will probably go off or something you know is the lights will go out amen maybe some of you got more than one or two issues so you look at that sign right there and you just say well you know brother Matthew thanks for coming back we needed you brother you're kind of wet a little bit look at his shoes he needs my wife to give him some sandals I gave my wife such a complex about her sandals she didn't even wear them tonight she said I'm not going to wear those sandals I so embarrassed her at Louisiana she walked out out of the the room the the he's going to embarrass me she just walked out of the service that's not a good sign so stop talking about people only say positive things this is maybe what it looked like in the upper room God had had enough of being on the outside of his people he had had enough of being above his people he had had enough of just being Jesus with his people he want wanted to come inside of his people so this is the upper room this is a little was it like this where there was tongues of fire GL upon each of them the Bible says young old what whoever was in that room got the Holy Ghost I tell you what put me in a room with some people that believe like that [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God and it fixed everything it took care of everything and all of the disciples that were in that room were martyred yeah they gave their life all of the disciples except for John and they tried to boil it out of him they put him in a vat full of boiling oil to boil out the Holy Ghost and there was so much dynamic and quickening Power in brother John it was like being in a hot tub maybe I don't know but he was still alive they say oh man we tried to get him with them we tried to get Shadrach meach and abedo and all our strong Mighty soldiers they're dying dying and here come Shadrach Meshach and abedo come falling into the fire and it just burns off their bands and goodness and God said you know what I've had enough of it just being three I'm going to go down and visit them I'm going to be a witness to those young men that I'm with them you know wormwood wanted to come and other Angels you know blow up the furnace fire send a bunch of rain you know God says no I appreciate all you lovely Angels but this is my this is my time I'm going to go down there I think it's about like tonight the Lord saw last night and today and how you all you know it was just lovely today I there was only one moment that I saw something as a little out of order and one of our sisters she was just going at it going at it with somebody I just kind of listen a little bit she's just probably strong wheed maybe a little stubborn it probably wasn't even a bad thing I probably just misunderstood but she was exercised I better move along if I would have said a brother then he was like oh okay who what brother was that I'm not going to tell you the Lord knows everything it's all fine some of you fell fell off there everything was good today right y'all doing good food was good sweet tea was good now I want to go back with you to Tacoma I'm leading through something here brother John lives in SE north of Tacoma Tacoma is south of Seattle and I live up in the north part of Washington this is in 1948 when brother brandham how many can see that when over 5,000 people came to those meetings tonight we're speaking about healing this is in the same meeting and I want you to notice really close what's right around the pulpit can you'all see the pulpit on the left hand side they put the people that was most urgent the closest that's right right the people that was so visual they're on stretchers they're on wheelchairs they're laying there like I wish we could be that honest that if we had an empty room here tonight and the deacons were asking everyone you that have the most serious spiritual needs in your life you can sit on the front row just come up around the altar just sit around the ministry how many of us though would just kind of you know I got it's not so bad I I won the rock I I won the rock climbing thing today brother John I got this I'm strong and they might be very weak they might be about ready to make a decision Amen on Monday that unless God stops them this weekend they're headed for a tragedy Satan's got them on a roller coaster on going in the wrong direction yes and God rich in Mercy how many know God's Rich let's all say God is Rich God is Rich he owns the cattle on a thousand hills and he owns the hills and he said you're my son you're my daughter you can have up to half of my king K om amen if a natural King can say that to Esther or someone surely God can say what do you want bride of Christ what do you want hady right what do you want young people in the upper room what do you want what do you want from God what do you want from the holy spirit is this okay tonight do you all notice the stretchers and all around the pulpit it's like brother Matthew it's like okay I got to get there my legs broken my shoulders crushed somebody push me up there I'm broken I don't need nobody to tell me I got issues I got issues I'm laying in front of 5,000 people oh God take me to that place I got to get there but Jason I've got to get to a place and I don't care what 5,000 people think about [Applause] me he's a song leader you know she's G great testimonies you know they're the pastor's children they're the great grandchildren it doesn't matter there was issues there was needs there's hurts there's wounds this was brother brandham speaking that that series of meetings you can see the thousands of people you can see this is a picture from the front do y'all see those stretchers right in front how many can see those raise your hand you I know it's hard to see but just write down they're just they're just laying there when the song leader said let's all stand and give God glory and give him praise they just laid there I don't have the strength brother I'm waiting I'm just trusting by the end of the service something I don't want to get rolled back out of these doors I'm not going to lay here through a song service an hour song Ser through somebody preaching and then go home go out in my van in my car and be the same let's all just agree together would that be horrible amen amen then why don't we just invite the great physician to come into the meeting why don't we invite the great physician to the pulpit why don't we just let the Lord Jesus come and say whatever needs to be said right then we'd really shout the Victory and it wouldn't be forced it would be from the from the bottom of our hearts the healer is here we say oh God Hallelujah I've got issues maybe for years I just if I can just touch his suit I know I'd be whole we need that attitude more in the message instead of the critical Spirits or what can that preacher tell me that I haven't heard before probably nothing but the Lord Jesus coming by here tonight has enough power to speak your name and you walk from as a dead person you walk out alive like Lazarus and brother brandom said there was so much power in his words that if he would have said arise every dead person would have rose from the dead but he said Lazarus arise so Lazarus walked out of there how many would just say God speak to me Lord I got about an eighth of who would say God speak to me [Applause] Lord maybe you're fine tonight maybe everything's good at your house start pulling for somebody else that's on the edge of their seat look at this so God finally said in 1963 I'm going to come down and make my presence knowing he came down visibly he was so close just a few days after this in the brandham Tabernacle that he was right with his prophet and brother brandham said only the lamb is worthy to break the seals brother brandham didn't break the Seven Seals it was the lamb standing behind the pulpit and brother brandham got worked up and people were pulling pulling what's the meaning of this seals and he would say things and he would say is something wrong is everybody okay is there is someone sick no go back and read that verse again and he read it again he said oh I was about I said that wrong how many would say God we need young people that are more that way the angel of the Lord is standing with you he's fighting your battles he's waving off the enemy I think I got about half of you on board who would really like that experience the the lord loves to be around you and he's fighting your battle and he's waving off the fiery darts cuz he's give you a shield of faith and he's given you strength what good is a sword if you don't have the strength to lift it up so he gives you power he gives you strength he puts strength inside of [Applause] you so the Lord Jesus appeared and I want to make this clear tonight and I know we're on the internet and that's just fine William brandham was not a Divine healer Jesus Christ is the Healer and he chooses to flow through vessels that he has ordained to manifest his power and you just happen to be one of those and I happen to be one of those but we're like an electrical uh something we need to be plugged into the power source that's what some of you been good boys and good girls and good people for years and you have the mechanics all in order and you're just right for a real Dynamic move and I would just throw up my heart and say here am I Lord wrestle it out just wrestle all night if you have to how many remembers that one service brother Brandon preached the whole service and he's preaching about Isaiah and things and then he said okay come to the end of the service he said everyone bow your heads is there anybody here that would like to just say raise your hand and say I would love to be an Isaiah make my stand for Christ and there was I think three people raised their hand everybody bowed their head close your eyes so private so secret then he just goes along a little bit and then he Saidi wonder if you that raised your hand would stand to their feet or come forward come forward I think it was Hallelujah and do you know that there was only one man that came forward and brother bham said let him be another Isaiah out of the whole service so brother brandham having the gift that he did and brother John don't have this gift but he started to go right down the line and call out people's needs you're situation your name and you there and you there and this is what it is and you can hear it visibly people screaming I think it was I'm just forgetting right now from nine or 13 cases he said their name their address what their need was then he said now who would like to come now who believes the presence of the Lord and the altars just packed just packed up and down and my a lot of us would have said praise God we had a meeting and you know what brother brandham said it's on tape he said you have done the worst thing you could have ever done he said you should have responded to the word you responded to the gift of your heart being expressed or your need or your address your neighbor knows your address on the doctor you visited that told you you have a certain condition knows your condition yeah all right the people weren't honest they weren't responding to the word they weren't responding to Holy Ghost Ministry and it's the same today we do the same call and maybe three raise their hand and we say oh do you need prayer and maybe three come forward one come forward I don't know maybe we okay and the holy spirit is just moving moving wants to do something wants people to be touched delivered set free then my some another gift another brother come and there'd be altars packed out and all up and down the aisles and I I've been in meetings where Almost 100% of the people is at the altar yeah I preached in New Zealand one time this was a young people's meeting and it was in a sheep uh Barn I think my wife was there I think it was our honeymoon it was and we preached a message and I think almost every single young person was either on their face at the altar crying out to God we would say my we had a meeting brother we had a meeting glory to God but do you know if brother Brandon was here and that same service played out I wonder how many of us would have enough courage to say did they respond to the word did they respond because their friend came and you know that whole row of girls came up it has to be God so I'm just following out was it the word on I wonder how many of us would feel like that preacher that said you've done the worst thing you could have done would say what a rebuke God was doing things it was so wonderful no it was a prophet being honest those people had not responded to the word and they got correction for it I say God don't let me be that way if you're going to deal with my heart I don't care if there's 5,000 300 200 how many's in the building tonight it doesn't matter there might be five there might be 500 or 5,000 in Congo young people's meeting 5,000 young people it doesn't matter we still have young people issues and if we were having couples there would be couple issues and if we had a 40 plus camp and it was just 40 and up I'd be there and we wouldn't be talking about young people's things we'd be talk well issues children but it would be about 40 and up and you'd have to shut down after an hour because they'd all didn't get our nap today my wife asked me coming to church did you get any rest I said no I pulled in out here and I'm just waiting cuz we got here really early did you get any arrest today I said no she said yeah you're just kind of staring out there thank you baby this message was on my heart I said how can we deliver this so that there's 100% response to the word where the Holy Spirit could say they did exactly they responded appropriately where there doesn't have to be a rebuke on the day of Pentecost there was no rebuke God came down and sealed them he blessed them they came busting out of there they were cowards they were cussers and swearers and God turned them into Power houses God turned this group of young people into powerhouses Hallelujah all of this you can do more for God Amen that's right for the rest of your life just give it to God and let him take care of things he'll do more for you and through you in five minutes then you'll do in a whole lifetime stop trying to figure it all out none of us have got it all figured out including brother Jason Watkins Hallelujah he doesn't know everything and brother Jason De Mars isn't the most wonderful teacher and the best Apostle in the message I'm not even looking at him cuz he's probably looking like this or he's probably going like this and brother Matthew is a fantastic brother and I love him but he's not the best preacher in the message and neither is Brother John Andes we're your most humble servants what can we do for you tonight what could we say tonight that God will touch your heart come on somebody what how can we all get out of the way together the singers the musicians the deacons people in the nursery people out in the fellowship hall they just one mind and one Accord they're just saying God move among us there if there'd be 15 stretchers here and cuts we'd all be saying God let him get up and walk out of here some of you that think the whole world revolves around you right now and you got real problems you'd be saying God touch that sister touch that brother we get so selfish I don't want to offend anyone but the whole world don't revolve around you and we're not going to come down to your level and start being depressed and mopy and Dopey and sad we're Holy Ghost filled Believers I'm not I'm not condemning anyone Amen on I hope you don't feel that way here it is in South Africa brother brandham wasn't a racist amen and neither is one person that goes in the Rapture a racist we don't care what your color of skin is what language you talk if you stutter slur have health issues have mental issues we're a family and we're going to stick together [Applause] this is what showed up at brother bram's meetings ambulances and you say they look funny well they might look different today but they had sick people inside of them people that weren't well lined up brother Jason here's brother Billy Paul I think he was a teenager kneeling down and he's giving cards and this was what if you were sick it was one of your greatest desires if I could just get a prayer card and put my name on it and then you turn it over and you put what was on your the need and some of you maybe need a long piece of paper like 8 and 1 half by 11 that's okay yeah amen God already knows about it anyway and if you didn't BR a prayer card he still don't know your your name and address and you sister back there and you brother back there and he knows all that tonight amen is everybody doing okay sometimes we just need to breathe yes amen amen y'all know how to breathe brother John got covid in February and brother Michael Dexter's here and he's a nurse Head Nurse National nurse whatever you know brother John had to learn how to breathe again it's like and my wife knows just breathe I mean since you're born just breathe and we get and and you

Sons and Daughters of God we've been wounded we've been scarred we've been hurt we've been talked about websites made out about us we don't care thumbs down thumbs down horrible thank said nasty lies and you just keep coming back up you just keep coming back up you just you're like people physically that were're you know sometimes are we doing okay A person can have a physical need and it's so visible yeah it's on your face brother you can see it and other times we get something in our spirit or down in a spiritual matter and we can keep it covered over oh yeah we can hide it yeah that's not the will of God the first step of Deliverance is to expose that thing and a minister start talking in a certain way and and oh my and you wonder why it gets quiet sometimes we're just soaking it in and I'm exposed I'm sitting here naked throw a blanket over the person yeah I need a prayer card yep me too what are you here for well I've got issues these are prayer claws they're sending out to people these are old-fashioned wheelchairs yeah they couldn't walk into the service look at that what if we took out these first two rows deacons and then just the wheelchairs start rolling in young people young ladies young men okay all the young ladies it's like I'm in Africa tonight all the young ladies all the young men that's fine that's good that's good but it's all wheelchairs I mean we'd be coming and and looking at things a little different wouldn't we oh yeah people would be saying the song Le would say let's raise our hands and praise God and you'd see hand you fingers gone all kinds of splints and maybe I don't have an arm we'd be saying oh God Amen God touch your arm your your um just lift up that hand there may God touch our brother tonight just touch him just heal him crutches I don't see any crutches in the room do you brother Matthew any crutches are they under your chairs but how many of us have crutches we're leaning on things some of you are so the first thing you're going to check when you go out them doors is your Facebook account or your Instagram come on you are so addicted to that thing this little device you are addicted say well don't tell me I'm I just did addiction means that you just can't hardly live without it you know drugs alcohol all those other things that's horrible that's a sin it's a sin you know and and God's trying to deal with your heart that if you give more time to him you'd be a stronger Christian you got to take care of that wound that hurt and then you're just Raw you're ripping off your bandage I can do this and you're lifting stuff don't lift 50 lbs for at least a month and then I'll take the cast off come back in and two months no no I'm I can do this I'm tear this thing I'm gonna lift up this oh Lord Oh Lord no you should have done what the doctor said God could have healed you in a moment but he's trying to teach you a lesson you're not Invincible that's true you're not invincible and maybe God is allowing this in your family or in your church to happen so that you can help somebody else down the road and you're trying to avoid it am every day you're like oh God oh God oh and he's like saying wait stop it yeah oh God I am your God but stop your whining oh Lord oh stop crying many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord amen okay now I'm getting into a serious part of the service and I want everyone to just be on the edge of your seat and help me Satan's lied to you this is Brother brandham you've been suffering you're going through the change of life and that's been on you the menopause for about 5 years you take every kind of medicine that comes along and ain't none of it does you any good isn't that the truth now he's not talking to the brothers right so you say brother John I just fast forward and and those type of things in the meeting or you know I've heard people that thought they were so spiritual they would listen to a taper brother brandham some of y'all probably heard this they'd fast forward to the you get to the meat of the word brother and then you know at the end the you know the prayer lines and the closing you know oh then I got to go to the next service fast forward up all the announcements and brother B I'm talking talking no I got to get the scripture get the meat of the word brother Hallelujah come on no we need all of the book all the pertinent Parts the opening the close if you're falling asleep and you're listening I got to listen to a three-hour sermon bless God and after 20 minutes you need to turn it off put some water on your face get up walk around you're not getting it out of the word isn't that amazing amen we're going to listen to a little service or listen to some preaching after about 20 minutes 30 minutes it's like but we can watch a 2hour movie and it's we're crying we're like oh what's going to happen what's going to happen 2 and 1/2 hours it don't matter stop interrupting me stop it no no stop it you know I'm not putting no pause on this you know I'm listen to the end and it's overtime yes it's like oh let's stop this we got to go no no it's like yes let's go to the end come on why are we like that come on we can cry and weep at a movie two hours and you know 15 minutes and and then all the things start scrolling up and we're like I'm a gonna watch this turn and then it comes to the things of God and we're so bored we become a lazy generation and God wants an upper room youth that are looking into the word of God Six Days Seven Days eight days and we don't get bored and walk out of the room and say see y' I don't know about you guys but I got to go back to work right I don't know maybe they were part of the 3,000 that were added that day maybe I'm giving I'm I'm stretching it out there Hallelujah right brother kodri maybe there was three thou there was 3,000 added on the day of Pentecost maybe those that just didn't catch it but once they saw Thomas and Bartholomew and Peter can I just go on a little Trail right now do y'all remember that young person that was in the room with Peter it was a young damsel she was like a servant and Peter's like warm in his hand by the fire and oh I think your speech betrayeth you look in the Bible that whole week of the passion this is one young person that is caught up in the story it's a young person yeah that said oh you are that you are talking like those messy I am not yeah I think you all were at those meetings I think I saw you clapping and cheering no I was just clapping so they'd end the service you and he started cussing and swearing and I won't say what he said cuz he was cussing yeah so let's just fast forward 50 days 50 so days less than two months yeah and all of a sudden this girl's walking to you know walking to the temple walking to get the fire going and all of a sudden comes busting out of this room as a bunch of young people people and there's that same guy same sandals same robe and everything comes busting out of and says I got something to say to you all is that the same guy before he's cowering cursing saying I don't even know the man now he's out there busting it out man look at his sandals and that is the man he's totally transformed wouldn't it be fantastic brother Jason just give him two months just give that young man two months he could turn this whole church upside down one or two of you on fire for God will do more for your church than 40 revivals yes that's [Applause] right you can just put that into a message search that's what brother bam said one or two will do more for a church than 40 revivals like I think there's 52 weeks in a year that's having a youth meeting like this for 40 weeks man that'd be incredible would y'all love that put one or two of you go back to your home church and really love God and serve him and be a fire brand and be real that'll do more for the message than if we had meetings like this amen you know in Louisiana and Florida and South Carolina and then we're going to go to Oklahoma that's Washington and this and that stream and stream God just give us one or two in our church and make me one of them Hallelujah make me one of them make me uned for [Applause] God woo I'm breathing again if y'all would have asked me to preach in February I wouldn't been able to come I wouldn't even have been allowed on the airplane yeah cuz I tested positive and all that stuff God knew we're going to be here in June yeah God knew this weekend he knew when he put that on sister Rachel's heart I will restore that God was going to answer that cry and it was going to be the title of the service it was going to be the opening scripture that's the Holy [Applause] Ghost and on myy handmaidens and on thy servants and young men and the older ones friends it's time that we have another book of Acts church that recognizes our day and our hour and our season and it was Peter that got that Revelation this is that I wish there'd be some of you in this room be able to stand up and say this is that God open our eyes open our hearts to recognize it's not always going to be like this we could be shut down in a month and not be able to get together like this we ought to cherish we ought to celebrate we ought to Rejoice Hallelujah I'm I'm seeing brother Jason tomorrow he knows what it's like to be in a Muslim country and for you if you tell them you're a Christian and you can't even witness to nobody or that it's a death sentence and some of us live in a free nation and we still don't tell nobody shame on all of us we need a good fire good dose of the Holy Ghost little we need a double portion you that are going home tonight and not going to get tomorrow morning God give you a double portion right now just pour it in pour it in now I need to I need to move along so we can close the service because the doctor's looking at the chart here and he's giving you some good good word some of you are going to see yourself in the next few minutes it was the change of life an anemia I just look that up in the back study that's a that's a blood issue that's a problem in your blood I see blood dripping between me and you there's a light my loving sister how many would like to talk like that not perverted but just the great physician and just the manners have you all noticed brother brandom talking to people in the prayer line excuse me can I say this can I say this I'm just going to turn my mic microphone off cuz I've got a sister here and what I'm saying it doesn't need to be public all right and if what I said about what this brother's been doing it would cause Penitentiary offenses some of you'd want to kill the man so I'm just going to turn off my microphone and just talk to our brother about what he was doing last Thursday night oh you say brother if I knew I'd tell the pastor the Deacon I'd get right on WhatsApp Instagram and everybody would know that's why God hasn't called you to that that's why you keep losing friends cuz you're breaking trust all the time can I just tell you something brother between me and you sure brother it'll stay between me you and God and 643 people that you're going to you know please pray for brother so and so he you think that brother's ever going to talk to you again I'm asking a question if I spent 28 minutes with this brother after service and he told me what was going on in his and brother just can you just keep this in confidence and pretty soon brother Jason knows brother Jason knows brother Matthew knows brother I'm pretty my wife knows when I get back to the motel do you know that brother up there that was sitting on the platform what what what he's going through brother do you think he would ever talk to me again no he would definitely go on vacation the next time brother John came it's because he lost confidence it doesn't mean I I don't have the Holy Ghost it means I need to grow up and when I say brother this is confidence it's confidence there's a phrase that's called and I'll go to my grave with that we do it every day yeah there's things that happen in this last week my wife knows nothing about yeah in Council and us talking with someone and she will never know that's how it's supposed to be moving on brother brandom he he said he said I think it was Christ as the mystery he said if you all knew what the angel of the Lord revealed to him it would cause penitentary offenses just look that up Penitentiary offenses it means people would go out want to kill somebody they you'd be going to jail for murder because a man of God had come to maturity did anybody get anything out of that be more trustworthy and stop putting everybody else dirty laundry out there God forgave you and you don't want to forgive another person you don't know if what God forgave that person it's under the blood and you've spread it around to the world I don't know why I'm on this but we do we need to be carry trust a little better it doesn't matter that nobody else knows right amen come on youall know what I'm talking about listen there's blood dripping my loving sister why don't you believe Jesus Christ makes you well and don't have nothing to do with the devil that's good and go out of this building and be made well if God is standing here with the power of His Spirit to let me know your life can't he make you well yes Lord you believe if I curse the thing in Christ Jesus Christ's name it'll leave you that's what you wanted me to do I wasn't reading your mind but you wanted me to put my hands on you cuz that's what you was believing is that right well come here I'll do it almighty God author of Life seeing that her faith lays in laying on of hands I pray for Mercy this is 1953 those Dark Shadows hanging around the little woman knowing that Satan always along there to tempt her in this time of life but Jesus you are are always standing in the shadows watching your children how many love the word of God he Jesus is standing in the shadows do you know what I'd like to do tonight in this service I would like like to invite the Lord Jesus to step out of the Shadows come on somebody come on we can sing about it we can talk about it we can preach about it standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus I'm taking you a step further I'm going to the next level would you like to go with me come on young people then I want to say Lord step out of the Shadows amen go walking down the road within me I want my heart to burn again oh how our hearts burn within us while he talked with us along the road amen and they didn't even know who he was yet but they remembered while he talked to us my heart was burning I was quivering I didn't know where he was going with this but I had faith that he knew all about my life and if he knew my name and my address than whatever he was going to say I was going to do it amen nothing can harm them he's talking about his children now you enemy as God's servant I take charge over you Hallelujah in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her I lay my hands upon her as God's servant commissioned by an Angel you know about about it you've seen it happen he told me if I'd be sincere that nothing would stand before the prayer and I believe him and you're a loser he wasn't talking to the lady or the people he's talking to the devil you won't offend nobody else in this building there's a lot of you that if you were Peter you'd be so offended if you'd have Jesus turn to you and say Satan get behind me you'd leave his church you'd misunderstand you're you're not big enough to overcome that but Peter was Peter was I think you all are I think some of you need to start talking to the devil right now and say you're a loser get off my territory come on say it devil you're a loser get out of my life get out of my mind get out of my family get out of my friend you're exposed your your Darkness your sickness go to hell for the next 10 minutes you can say that cuz after that your dad and mom would say don't say nobody go to hell devil go to hell you're about to go there that's why you're crying out that's why you're trying to stop these kind of meetings that's right why right right now you want brother John to look at the time cuz he'll just be shocked he's preached so long and I'm about ready to nail another nail in his coffin if you were in a bar tonight some of you Brothers know what I'm talking about you'd ask for another shot right now yeah how you feeling I'll take another one somebody sing another done somebody wrong song you know get on yeah I've been hurt too yeah my wife my friend my yeah pass another beer yeah true Designated Drivers and all that wouldn't it be fantastic if we'd all have to have designated Drive the whole taxi cab

able to drive you're all over the place you're bunch of drunkard you bunch of wine bibbers you've been drinking wine I asked for the address what's the address okay and it's just all kinds of everybody's there and everybody's Drive what's the what's happening down at that church there's a whole parking lot full of cars and they're all asking for rides home it's because they've got a good dose of the Holy ghost they can't [Applause] even Hallelujah I didn't come to preach to you tonight I need more of the Holy Ghost I want a double portion my wife and I prayed today before coming to the service Lord we need Serv Services the Border shut down we haven't been able to go into Canada and have Services the people on the US side of the Border s my wife is sitting back there drinking from this drinking from your songs drinking from your presence she hasn't been in a meeting like this for months amen one of the reasons she's even here tonight is because her husband wanted her to be around Believers and be in church services we're not everybody's wearing masks and we're not all giving air shakes and all that but people that love God and they're crying out and they're worshiping [Music] [Applause] God so tonight my wife isn't my designated driver cuz God's going to feel her tonight oh God's going to fill me tonight we need the preachers on the platform to say we need more of God we need the deacons in the back we need sister Jean and her sister to say we need more of God we need sister Samoan she's got both her hands up in she wants more of why can't brother Ben why can't

brother John you're 49 I'm losing my mind that's cuz my mind's been on the service I've been saying God if I preach like this people are streaming already logged off they already think brother John don't believe in the Holy Ghost don't believe in prayer line don't believe in meetings and he he already got brother John xed off and I'm rising up through that X and I'm saying I'm speaking exactly what the Holy Ghost told me to say Satan you're a loser and watch these words brother I I free this woman tonight from all all these things in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God all right lady look here if God knowed what was in your life and what has been in your life he surely would know yet you are healed you always been just a little bit nervous when you was a little girl one time coming from school I see you or something or another you run up towards a dog or something and you got frightened by way back had a little checkered plaid dress on you remember that and here's some nice words to hear it's all over hallu GL you can go and be made well see if you have no need of a physician don't mean much to you you got it all together you'll drive right by the wound healing Center you'll never call 911 cuz you're fine then it's not for you it's for the other person that Jesus talked about but if you have need of a physician call him up call him up tell him what you want just speak his name give him a chance I challenge you tonight every single person ought to be Hatty right brother brandham said if she would have asked for a million dollars it would have dropped down in her lap they were poor brother brandham had $20 in his pocket that's why he was even at her house to go give her $20 back cuz she had given tithing Yen I think it was for the year yeah $240 that whatever it was she was poor I've been to their house and been in the trailer they were poor people amen by the end of that her boys were weeping crying people were shouting I give you whatever you asked for and her little crippled up Edith sitting over there and she said what am I supposed to ask she said brother bradam said if she would have asked for healing for Edith she would have got up out of that wheelchair her old parents were sitting over over there but brother brandham said this he talked about that and said they might have been healed that day and but they would have died one day she asked for the greater thing she asked for the right thing some of us need our stop our nonsense would you like a grande double Grande triple shot we just need to say I want more of God just give me the whole load brother some of you you got decisions next week to make you've been coming to these meetings asking God for leadership in your life and a prophet said to you he wants to lead you more than you even desire that about the Holy Ghost he said God wants to fill you more than you even desire it so stop all this nonsense I want the holy I can't get the Holy Ghost it's a gift stop struggling stop beating the altar you don't need to scream about it just receive it and I know I'm being streamed so let me clarify and then whatever God wants to do after that he can do whatever he wants if you want to run Shout Scream speak in tongues run the aisles run un to it doesn't matter all I would know somebody else that you came in the service with they know that's different amen I whatever that person's got I need more of that the problem is people's just been so hypocritical and they've gone they've seen cycles of Revival that get so skeptical to where we all get skeptical you I'll see that person by Tuesday night yeah yeah that's why God doesn't fall that's where our faith is but we need more men and women that would just say I free this woman you are healed you've always been a little nervous how many believe God knows everything about your past now I'm asking for participation he knows everything the kind of dress you were wearing the kind of pants you were wearing he knows the situation and by the way I mean here's this lady she's so nervous pulling up her stockings and brother brandham what is I got demons I got devils and brother brandham just tells her you he just goes back into her life and you've been been living a certain way it's not right I could never tell my husband that I know these are young people it's the same God I could never tell my husband those things well that brother Brandon Walks out of the room she couldn't eat this lady she's nervous I could never well and brother bam walks out and then they they have a little bit more communication see I just love how God works with us he doesn't just give give up on us I'm working with some of you tonight amen I don't even know you but I've been waiting for a long time now for some of you really to strike strike a channel amen finally the prophet came back and he said by the way your husband has the same thing to confess to you oh not my husband he's a deacon in a church

young people he's trying to move them into one heart one mind one ACC it's unlimited what Jesus Christ will do [Applause] if I have found Grace in your sight and God has given me favor now this is brother brandham saying this believe me as his servant I told you by the authority of the witness of the Holy Spirit he's here now that you can't he's here now that you couldn't hide your life if you had to and by that same witness and by the Bible that Jesus Christ the son of God has healed everybody in in this building let's include the fellowship hall let's include this whole property let's

already left you you can go home now you walk different since you got there haven't you the arthritis left you in the line while you've been sitting in this church anxiety left depression left troubles are gone God's put back peace and joy into some of your heart you've got a whole building that we pray for you right now amen is this just emotion come on are we just working up one another into a frenzy or is this some Upper Room youth that say I want more of that I need it in my life he's just calling out NE the reason brother John had these one right after is to let you know God's got them all he's got it all no matter what your trouble is we could keep naming it off sister of course one of the great things wrong with you we all know this is one thing there's about 95% of this audience suffering with the same thing a nervous condition you're real nervous isn't that right well let me show you how hard to call them everyone suffering with nervous condition raise up your hands out there this is in the service see there you know what happened 95% of that congregation you know what they didn't care what everybody else thought she thought she's battling this all alone and I'm dealing with this issue in my life and it's rampant 95% of the audience was suffering yeah you've tried to find a place to start and they told you to get next to yourself and Satan told you what Satan told you you are going to lose your mind and all of these things but it's a lie it's a lie I'm speaking under the authority of the great physician and the nurse is saying come on we got we have another appointment and the great physician is saying nope we're dealing with this this is my office this is my case this is my jurisdiction I'm not an MD I'm a specialist and I'm going right down the line 95% of you are nervous and oh they're lifting up their hands Satan's telling them they lose their mind and all but it's a lie he's still lying tonight you believe with all your heart then from

something was on her mind her spirit was overwhelmed with what was consuming her and last night y'all remember us closing we were talk about a girl that was running trying grabing it was the Holy Spirit yeah trying to let you know God seen you weeks ago I didn't put the date on this piece of paper my wife doesn't know anything about it but after the service last night I went back to my motel and I was looking through my notes looking brother Matthew threw my notes and I found the piece of paper a little girl being breathless she'd been running she was Dusty she was tired she was on a mission something was on her heart something was on her mind her spirit was overwhelmed and last night as we closed that's what was in my heart I said I got to go back and find that that was the Lord Jesus putting a burden on brother John's heart weeks ago I had to tell you that tonight that even in our closing songs and prayers that God knows all of us he knows all about your weeping crying
