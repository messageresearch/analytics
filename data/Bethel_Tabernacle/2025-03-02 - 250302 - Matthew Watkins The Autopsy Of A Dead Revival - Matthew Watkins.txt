I pray God that you would come now by your spirit Lord and move us out of the way help us Lord to hear what you have we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen God bless you thank you for all the music uh if you have your Bible turn to the Book of John chapter 3 and also acts but first John chapter 3 very familiar amen God bless you amen this morning good to be here in the house of the Lord would like to just say that we're still praying for our pastor uh my dad who's still uh still uh trying to recover from the sickness that that he got in different ones that um that we prayed for on Wednesday night know that there's still some suffering amen you know I tell you what sickness will do it'll make you appreciate when you're healthy you lay in the bed for a few days and you really appreciate you know you the what what you have most of the time is health and you're fine but you never stop and say thank the Lord I'm not sick so maybe we should just do that Lord thank you I'm not sick amen well John chapter 3 we just want to keep praying for those that are uh out brother Brad Sister Sarah here is she not she's okay she's doing better still at the hospital oh at home but still recovering we want to just lift our sister up Amen in prayer also uh little baby Phoebe Anna hope and Jeremiah's a little baby got an update from um from anah Hope just here recently so we just want to the Lord has already done some wonderful things and we believe that he's got a he's got it all in control amen little newborn baby there still having a feeding tube and mixing that between that and a bottle so we just want to believe the Lord will bring amen that baby home and to full health no update on that no Meo no okay not since I talked to her amen and any other needs that we don't have maybe we just say PR special prayer um for those uh when we read our scripture and pray amen we just want to speak to you today and I'm going to title this the autopsy of a dead Revival you'll see why that title the autopsy of a dead Revival John chapter 3 this is Nicodemus who we know the Bible says is a Jew who comes to Jesus by night he asks him uh this question in verse two he says for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now it doesn't mean that he can't understand principles the word the manuscripts Nicodemus was a scholar he was a Jew he could read all of that but Jesus is speaking of something greater when he says a man can't see the kingdom of God see their friends how many believes that without the Holy Ghost you can't even see the kingdom of God how many believes that you could learn about it you can read about it uh but you can't see you can't really truly see the kingdom of God until you're born of the spirit of God notice this here Revelations chapter 3 I'm sorry uh John chapter 3 sorry I just had a text come in want to make sure we get to and he says here he cannot see Nicodemus says in verse 4 how can a man be born again when he's old can he enter the second time into to his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of Flesh of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can't not tell from where it came and where it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen let's turn also to Acts chapter 2 very familiar and I'll have you be seated amen Acts chapter 2 amen before I read that I'll just bring a request here my brother just texted me and reminded me my uh actually a family member of IRS uh passed away just a couple days ago um so just be remember in the entire McAn family dealing with with the loss of Renee their daughter amen was our uh cousin grew up with them for early part of our life so we just want to be remembering that McAn family and all of those that were affected by that loss amen we'll take up that also Acts chapter 2 you love the Lord Jesus amen amen let's just begin reading here go all the way down to verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do now notice I love that not what what can't we do you know sometimes we make Christianity about rules and what you can't do but that wasn't their question when they heard the gospel they said what can we do not what we can't do what can we do I love that what can we do to be saved Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ amen for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus we just bow our heads before you now thanking you Lord for just another opportunity to be able to serve you Lord in this capacity Lord we thank you Father for providing all of our needs your Prophet taught us Lord that everything that we have need of even a Rapture already lays within that seed Gene of God down on the inside of us Lord that means that healing is there Comfort is there wisdom is there knowledge is there Lord the ability to overcome the world and the flesh is already there inside of us Lord now God I just reach out and by Faith Lord touch you on behalf of these special requests Lord I pray God that you'd be a comfort right now Lord to the McAn family Lord Jesus all of those Lord affected father by this tragedy I pray Lord God that you would just be a Lord give more grace you said where Grace is needed more grace is needed than more grace is supplied I pray God that you would continue to touch our pastor Lord my dad as he streams now I pray God that you would just touch him Lord God in his body all of those that are continuing with the remnants of sickness I pray that you'd move on the scene Lord for Sister Sarah Lord even now God Maya Angel Lord of healing just come by and touch her in her body I pray for little Phoebe the same Lord and I hope in Jeremiah Lord struggling Lord there with that situation I pray God that you'd be present be near to them Lord Jesus I pray for us now Lord God as we sit under your word I pray God that you would receive it Lord not just in our mind and the mental faculties that's where it starts Lord but let it go on down to the reaches of our very soul lord where you can affect a change in our life Grant it now Lord Jesus we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this morning I won't get to this uh brother Mark you could display that if you want or just have scriptures ready I won't get to this entire sermon I know that I won't today and uh and so we'll just go as far as we can and I'll just be good try to be good about uh remaining just with my notes here today as I know the Lord just I directed me uh on some of these things that I'm going to preach on so um I'm going to do a little bit of teaching teaching and preaching I didn't get my words mixed up I meant to say that and so sometimes I believe that it's good just for us to look at some of these things and I just want to lay just a little bit of my heart out on the way the Lord uh has just dealt with me in such a way uh even over months now and I just uh just now coming to be able to preach this and so I just want to uh to say a few things just at at the start we're preaching to you on the autopsy of a dead Revival you know I believe that this is many times uh this question that has been asked and I and I could I could phrase it for you the way that I wrote it down concerning this the new birth that we read about in John chapter three and also uh in the book of Acts chapter 2 we could ask this question quite simply and I'm sure much many of us has asked this question so simple what is the new birth or when we ask the question in the same way what is the Holy Ghost I like to use that word because ghost is a word that the scripture uses and we want to be biblical in the way that we express the nature of God now brother bham said that even amongst the Pentecostal Church they had gotten to the point to where they didn't want to say ghost and so he said they would say holy spirit think about that now he says of course the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost are the same thing but people when they say holy ghost it identifies them with people that speak in tongues people that believe in in the moving of the spirit people that roll on the floor and are called Holy Rollers or kick the furniture like we read Wednesday but I just want to tell you uh here today I'm not ashamed of the Holy Ghost and I don't believe we ought to be ashamed to use those kind of words as long as we are identifying them with the book of Acts Church am and so notice here we ask this question what is the Holy Ghost brother bham says that in theage message what is the Holy Ghost 1959 he says what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant What is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you and so we ask the same question we could say here as I got them here before me what does it mean to be born again Nicodemus asked the same exact question what does it mean to be born again I'm just going to list some of these really without giving a direct answer yet as I just lay a foundation and get you in the same frame of mind as the Lord has me uh you could ask the question brother Matt is receiving the Holy Ghost and being born again the same thing or are they two separate things to be born again or to be filled with the Holy Ghost now you have to be I believe rightly dividing the word correctly you would find that even brother brandom in the early stages of his ministry he he he begins to answer the same exact question in a way that's very different after the angel of the Lord corrects him so we don't want to take something that brother brandham says uh early and then make a Doctrine out of that right hello and so we want to make sure that we're following this line must be upon line precept be upon precept here a little there little and so we know that this is the way the Lord revealed to him what is the true New Birth is the Holy Ghost the same or being born with the spirit of God is it the same as be fil being filled with the Holy Ghost are we born then we could say brother Matt we could ask this question are we born again in a different way being under the opes of the message of the hour are we now born again in a different way than they were born again in the book of Acts that's the question how about throughout the church ages through the ministry of Martin the ministry of Columba the ministry of of of Wesley are we born again differently uh were those then we could ask this question brother Matt were those under that were under Martin's Martin Luther's message or John Wesley's message were they born again were they truly born again um or or were they just saved what's the difference is there a difference brother Matt in being saved as we that word is very popular to use especially amongst evangelicals and Southern Baptist and people that we live in here in this part of the country we love using that word I'm saved well can I just say that if you go and I would give you reference after reference after reference that every single time that the Greek word is used for saved it is never used in the same way that most modern churches teach saved and the Very one important distinction that I think should just be uh an illumination I'll give you one of the most popular for God so loved the world am that he gave us only begotten son that whosoever should believe on him should not perish perish but shall have everlasting life for God so loved the world that he sent his only son and so we take that word there saved but I want you to to to just think of one thing in your mind that there is in in the in the original Hebrew language and I'm I'm not a a grammar teacher the opposite of whatever a grammar teacher is that's brother Matt and so but there's the it's called the continual um uh uh uh I'm not going to get the word right so I better not even say it let you just fade out and try to correct me in your own mind I'll just say it this way that in the Hebrew there's a way to say a certain word that we don't have any English and so when the King James or the Bible was translated into English it failed to grab the true meaning of what the Hebrew thought was or the Greek sorry was meaning and it's a continuation it's something that is a is a is a word that continues in other words you are it's not that you are saved but that you are being saved amen amen and so it's actually always used in this context to say I am saved I am being saved and one day I will be saved and to say all three of those things could be saying it correctly I was saved I am being saved and I will be saved is ought to speak the same exact thing that salvation was never Jesus never came listen to save us from hell did you know that that Jesus Yeshua Emmanuel his name meant Jesus Savior to save you from your sins amen hell being saved from hell is just the result of being saved from your sins I I want to make sure we get that clear because you say brother mat why are we bringing some why are we teaching on some of these I could just be a simple as I can here today and say that what what are you preaching on brother Matt how to become a Christian could there be anything more basic than that question how to become a Christian could we preach on anything now you may be able to come up with something but in my own mind I couldn't think of anything more basic but more necessary then how do I become a Christian it's amazing because even that word can lose its value and and take steer uh steer someone's mind in the wrong direction because even that word Christian I'm a Christian they they never called themselves that Jesus never said go into all the world preaching the gospel and and make people Christians but the Bible says they were first called Christians to Antioch in other words they never called thems a Christian but the people in the world seeing their life noted that they had been with Jesus Christ and so they were called Christians but the words of Jesus which is more properly understood is make disciples am you see why it's so important when you're a disciple and not don't call yourself a Christian I called myself a Christian but it's so much more so much more value if we look at it differently as not I'm a Christian but I'm a disciple because when you say I'm a Christian it speaks of a completed completeness that I've arrived I'm there but I'll just be honest with you and tell you friends sometimes I don't feel like a Christian hello somebody sometimes I don't feel like a a real representative of Jesus so I just say I'm not I'm a disciple in other words I'm learning to be like Jesus I'm I'm I'm I'm got an ambition to be like Jesus I'm his disciple I'm disciplining myself to be a disciple of Jesus so it goes back to not saved as we use that Baptist terminology are you saved and they they call it a you know making a a a a declaration that's not that word but making a uh a a commitment sorry say it making a confession and so we've used that word in the Billy gramy you know revivals that they come to make a you know a confession they they come up for confirmation and repeat the sinner's prayer and say these words after me but listen friends you you you'll never be able to get to eternal life if you come by some other way than was the way given in the book of Acts as brother brandham said that's why they they they holler and Shout the way that they do and he says they get nothing because he says it it will be revealed in the Thunders that that and he's speaking of that new name in other words when the Jews came to offer a lamb now they got nothing because the lamb had ceased the physical lamb and brother baram says and at the moment that denomination s stay with me crucified the word he says from then on denominational systems were dead amen amen at that moment and now he says it's the word and the word only and then he says that's been just recently and so notice we use this word saved but really saved means I'm being saved and he didn't come to save us from hell he came to save us from sins and so Peter gives this very first qu very first answer he says you know repent and that that's important I could just say as fundamental as I could possibly be here it always must start with repentance amen amen you will never come to being born again without coming to repentance amen that's right you say brother Matt as a Believer do you continue to repent every day that's right amen but as a Believer coming to God you must first repent that is one of the most lost Concepts if you call it that one of the most lost truths that happened through the Dark Ages was real true repentance not a prayer but a true repentance even even the the the Reformation in an attempt to get so far away from Catholicism and Catholicism had what confession and so through the Reformation they became so polarized against confession that they because the priest you know to come to God you must come before a priest and a and you must confess to him but can I say that if we're not careful we we trying to not be something so hard that we take confession completely out amen and confession to conversion is essential amen amen I'm not talking about coming up here and confessing to me your sins but can I just stop and say as the Holy Spirit leads me to say this sometimes what we lack is True Confession it's like a man come to a man and said I I want to be saved oh you want I want to be Christian oh you want to repent yes what do you want to repent from sin notice the Bible never says to repent from sin but to repent from sins it's so powerful when a person starts to confess the sins that they want to be saved from because it's very easy as the man said well all sin well you didn't commit all sin remember what brother bam says when he's talking about Adam and he says when you repent now do you repent for Adam's sin that's not a trick question you can answer it when you repent do we repent from Adam's sin brother mam says no you didn't commit Adam's sin you repent for your sins I think we water down true conversion when we just tell people to repent of sin and we that that thought of repent and of sin is just I repent for sin all sin all sin no you didn't commit all sin sometimes it's powerful to be specific with God and say Lord this is what I'm struggling with this is the sin I sinned against you and you start to you start to let the Lord expose your life and then you say I've committed this sin and this sin you don't confess to a priest but you should confess to the high priest your high priest who's the high priest after your confession the Bible says confession is good for the soul I just I just I I I feel led just to stay right here so I'm going to for a moment confession is good for the soul sometimes to get rid of a demon spirit in a person's life they have to renounce that's what brother Bram T that spirit that they've worshiped amen not just to come up and say deliver me deliver me deliver me but deliver you from what that's why I love brother Diggs when he came through our first Youth Camp and he C and he just came to me with a inspiration said brother Matt I love all types of prayer lines I love it when we have a prayer line where you know you just everyone passes through a tunnel and you lay your hands on them God I've seen God do Miracles and God did one in my own life through that kind of prayer line I've seen God bring out discernment through the Ministries saying things in their prayer that discern my heart but brother dig says but I believe sometimes there's a power to confession when you go one on-one and you ask that young person because many times we fall into the Trap of coming up for prayer because we're convicted and then we go PR what do what do you need brother well I just want to be closer to the lord well that's wonderful all of us want that but be specific what do you want the Lord to do for you if you ever stand up with brother digs in a perlon that's his question what do you want the Lord to do for you brother what do you want the the Lord to do for you sister and then you can see the dawning on a young person's face when they think for a minute wait a minute I need to be specific this is a relationship not just deliver me from sin because I'm a sinner but deliver me from these sins yes is that all right church amen because confession and sometimes a demon's Spirit has a stronghold in someone's life because they've never openly confessed it if you ever came to John the Baptist and wanted to be saved wanted to be baptized he would ask you to confess your sins make a public declaration if you confess can I give you the Bible if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart right and so sometimes confession has a power of loosing sometimes we need to be very specific in renouncing that's why the the the the that sunlight you ever take something that's mildewy and moldy and dead and cold put it in the sunlight and when you bring it out into the Sun and expose it it kills the bacteria amen you know sometimes one of the greatest things that will eliminate sin is bringing that sin out in the open and exposing it sometimes the greatest deliverances start with I've never told this to anybody amen because the devil wants to take those things in our life and hide them shut them away well you confessed it who did you confess it to as brother bandam said if you sinned against your wife you ought to go to your wife and confess it to her now now that doesn't mean you know like one man he he got so convicted of sin that he just you know after he got saved and got born again and he really you know really took confession to the the next level and he had back when he was a teenager he had committed a crime and so he went to the police department and said I just want to confess to this crime and you know 19 such and such you know what they did they put him in court they charged that man with that crime put him in court and he went to jail for three months and LED 55 people to the Lord Jesus in jail you know what he did after he got out in 3 months he thought of another crime he had committed about a year before that he went back to the police station and confess that sin and so they arrested him put him back in jail for six more months and he led almost a hundred more men to the Lord Jesus and he said I want to declare something I am the only preacher fully funded by the US government now I'm not telling you to go that far but if the Lord convicts you of something friends I just believe sometimes we get so far away from these original principles and can I just stop here and say that you counsel people with trouble and issues and you talk to people over years I've spoken to people and about the troubles that they're having in their life and sometimes some major struggles and I've just found that cutting to the chase sometimes not trying to dissect the attributes of that current problem but just asking one question tell me about your conversion amen amen tell me stop for a moment forget that you're married for 30 years now 10 years and you're been in church for all these years let's go back to your original moment tell me a little bit about how you were saved yes and most of the time you'll find that the trouble is linked to the conversion so we ask the question is there a difference between being saved and redeemed brother Bram God hiding himself in Simplicity 196 63 how many more in here wants the Holy Ghost let's see your hand brother brandham says how many 1 2 3 4 oh no oh my no need of going without it there's 8 10 here 11 11 12 maybe here who needs the Holy Ghost listen to what brother bam says here I don't have this for the screen we want you saved friend we want you filled remember you are saved of course when you accept Christ now that happens here yeah you're saved but you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost amen so there's a difference between salvation and Redemption right that's why Peter could accept the Lord Jesus do miracles in his name and still curse and use profanity and say he doesn't even know him and deny him three times Jesus told Peter the night of the Betrayal he was already saved Peter Jesus said now after you're converted strengthen your brethren that's right you accepted Christ as your savior but when you're converted is when you're really changed that's right and he wasn't changed yet he cursed before the Lord denied him in everything but after I love that his conversion Art Thou after Thou Art converted strengthen your brother is that right that's what the scripture says anyhow that makes it right Jesus told Peter that had followed him cast out Devils done Miracles and everything and said you're not converted but after you're converted strengthen the Brethren right it's true says that and God had hided himself in Simplicity you go to listen to the end of that tape and there are people and brother bam at the very end of that sermon not I actually I'm getting that wrong it was actually the first seal I believe at the very end of the first seal brother Bron makes an altar call and says anyone in here need the Holy Ghost and people start coming forward you go to listen as that tape ends might be God has hide himself in Simplicity I was just listening to it and here's people wanting to come up and be born again wanted to come up and be you know laid hands laid upon them do you believe in that brother Matt well the book of Acts teaches it does do we do we require it no you don't require it but I want you to notice God will meet you at whatever faith that you have what what comes to a natural birth I was talking to the boys yesterday when a woman gives birth what is first water yes what is second blood then breath Spirit life and sometimes to get that life they got to lay hands on that baby and then there's the Cry of life and and and and you'll only find two definite experiences in the Bible if you want to say how do we know what it's like let me just say something here you you you this may shock you but if you want to know how to become a Christian you cannot look to the four gospels to tell you how you can't you can't use Matthew Mark Luke or John to truly tell you how to become a Christian why because Matthew Mark Luke and John was in a transitional period going from law to Grace it was the dispensation of John going to the dispensation of the S so n and even Jesus in John Mark uh John chapter 7 Jesus says he that believeth on me shall out of his belly flow rivers of Living Water and look in your Bible in pareses it says this he spoke of the spirit which had not yet been given for he had not yet ascended and sent his Spirit back amen so to go to the gospels is too early because the spirit had not the promise of the father had not been given if you say well then we'll go to the Book of Revelation sorry you're too late to go to the Book of Revelations even the Epistles is not where we should go to find out how to be born again you say then where brother Matt I'm going to tell you where sandwiched in the middle is a little book called The Book of the acts of the Holy Ghost amen that he did through the apostles amen and so this is why brother brandham would say this I love this so much am I do you have do I have you today amen this is why brother brandham would say this and I love this so much uh uh let me make sure I get it correct this is why even in the Old Testament I just want to catch this for a moment even in the Old Testament in type brother B would say in the pnis vision he would say that the Old Testament had seven Church ages just like the Gentile church had seven Church ages and so brother bam says he calls at the ancient Church age and he uses as you notice this here you'll find in that original Church age that original church that original age of Ages throughout the Old Testament you'll find it brother Caleb told him that today in the Book of Judges did you know that actually that judges book is a cycle that keeps repeating yeah and you would have a they would they got away from God God would send a judge which means savior it means a deliverer to save the people and then the Bible says that as long as the judge lived they would serve God under that judge but when that judge died they would go back to sinning just like they were before and so God would send another Judge Samson baric Deborah Oben all of these judges Gideon God sent these judges to deliver but notice it was a type of church ages to where as long as brother brandham said the messenger was alive the people lived and believed under that message and he says but when that messenger died he says it would last for just a little while and then those people would denominate around that man's teaching and God would send a plague they would put that put that bride to sleep and then would go into another another denomination and so what would God do he would send another fire he would light it again God would send another judge God would send another messenger they would believe that man's message there would be a bride called out an elected group out of that man's message speaking of Luther Wesley all of these Church age Messengers there was a bride out of each age that believed the word for their day and came under the atonement for their day can you help me preach today and so God would seal them with the Holy Ghost and then that man would die and then brother Ram said it would happen again they would denominate around that man's teach well let me just say friends if that's what would happen in all previous six ages what do you think can happen today now that the messenger is gone I believe brother Ram said the message won't never do denominate and I believe that with all of my heart but you can be a oneman denomination sure because a denomination is brother Adam said is just a group that says it's us our four and no more and if you don't believe it the way we believe it if you don't come the way that if you don't come to my church come to my preacher I'm afraid friends sometimes that's how message churches have gotten to to where we lose the sovereignty of the local body and we try to make every church match another church and if you don't match this church in the way they worship then you're just lay it a SE and foolish virgin cold intellectual formal and if if this church over here worships and they shout and dance and speak in tongues and run around you just say oh they're just Pentecostal babies can we all just accept that God made us all different and we ain't trying to match somebody down the road or some church on another Liv stream somewhere I'm thankful for all the Ministries that God sends in the message but let me just say that brother and that church and that state and that City comes fights different Spirits has different people has different challenges has different issues and so the way he approaches the problems in his church am I to get on and and and look at that brother and say that's my pattern that's my standard that's who I ought to be like and I'm afraid that's what we have is Conformity everybody trying to match one another brother I I'm not preaching against anybody I'm not preaching against any church or any Pastor I'm just here to say that God is the the leader of the church it's not a preacher it's not it's not any man not any Ministry the leader of this church is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is different performs different acts different preaches different because why he's meeting the challenge of be South Carolina he's meeting the challenge of bethl Tabernacle and it's not that I'm right and they're wrong or they're wrong and I'm right it's that God has an army he has a body of the Holy Ghost we do better if we take the words of a prophet just be who you are be yourself and God can use you as I said you'll never slay your giant trying to use another man's slingshot God has given you a weapon to face your enemy I can't figh him you can't fight mine you just be who God made you and we'll all go home someday Hallelujah you say then what is our pattern brother Matt who are we to pattern ourselves after I'm so glad we got a Vindicated Prophet with thus sayeth the Lord Brother bam says here notice this thus what the church was at Pentecost yeah amen is the standard amen can you say Amen that is is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what Scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close Hallelujah those Scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it can we get a hearty amen even if I tell you it's it's over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong on two counts first of all it's wrong to Suppose there aren't any more Apostles just because the original 12 are dead and Apostle means one scent there are many sent ones today but they're called missionaries as long as men are being called and sent for with the word of life there's an Apostolic age secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power is being over since the Bible has been completed I'm going to give you the words of a prophet that is untrue there's not even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively states otherwise here is our proof that both of these charges are false Acts 2:38 Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you somebody say me and to your children somebody say my children and to them that are a far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and Power will thank God he didn't just say message I'm glad I got the Pentecostal message but brother I need the Pentecostal power to go along with it for God to perform the book of Acts in my life and he says what the church had at Pentecost yeah is her inalienable right I love that originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost brother mam says it was persecuted I love this it wasn't very big it was hated and despised but it was led by the Holy Ghost it stayed with that original word pattern I love that so much I could just go on reading the Ephesian Church age and have you stand and be dismissed and brother bam just goes through this and I believe it's so important what the church had at Pentecost was her inalienable right can I keep on can I keep on here for a minute brother vam says that's how it done the true church how many want to be the True Church the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost yeah amen all right amen then what was the church at Pentecost I'm going to tell you what it was it was a church that was diverse oh yeah you go read Acts chapter 8 and Acts chapter 19 is the only two places acts 18 the only two places that you'll find true conversion that you can get an example from the book of Acts you can go through and read about Simon the Sorcerer who had believed Paul's message and so what did they do they sent Peter they sent John they sent the apostles to go and and not not not just to give them more uh teaching but the Bible says to lay hands upon them because all of Samaria had believed but they had not received the Holy Ghost righten you go read the house of conelius as we preached on Wednesday the Bible doesn't say that Peter laid his hands upon them the Bible says while Peter yet preached the gospel while Peter yet preached the gospel the Holy Ghost fell down brother if it could happen there how many believe it can happen here well Peter yeah I might lay hands on you you might receive the Holy Ghost but you don't have to have some physical evidence or physical uh confirmation the Holy Ghost can lay his hands upon you and can confirm his spirit inside of your heart but I'm afraid we want one to look like the next isn't it amazing we we all want it to well it's got to be this way well in the book of Acts it wasn't always the same way right amen hello amen oh boy got too much to get to what do what does it mean to be born again then is there something different what does brother random say the new birth is what is the new birth mystery of God reveal I know you love this Christ as the mystery that sermon is so powerful and I know you know this quote so well I'm just going to read it again brother brandom what is what is the new birth you'd say well brother brandom what is the new birth it is the Revelation somebody say Revelation it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen amen and we've established you could say then brother M let me just get through all these so I don't feel when I'm done with this why didn't I get to that I needed to you say then what is here's another question we could ask what is the evidence I know brother Matt I've got to be born again and in order to be born again I've got to come through water blood spirit justification somebody help me somebody help me that's right and then brother brandom says that baptism of the Holy Ghost that Wesley came through justification Martin Luther sorry came through justification that's a heart that turns towards God it's a heart that is Justified he realized it in scripture he was he was they they get that word from actually Hagi that's where it's repeated four times in the New Testament the just shall live by faith they are quoting not Martin Luther Luther wasn't even born Luther was quoting the prophet Hagi amen when God spoke to Hagi about cursing the land and Hagi said the just shall live in other words that the just the just the righteous shall live how we going to live by faith amen and faith is a revelation you've got to come through that you can't bypass justification well then we've got to come to what sanctification Wesley as as as when Wesley came on the scene Wesley seen that all the just were living by faith but they were living just like the rest of the world and so he preaches a message of sanctification but remember brother bam said that's the blood that's that's another step it's a great wonderful step but are you done there are you finished are you sealed no that's why brother B said many people can live under justification sanctification and go to hell yeah let me give you something further he said you can have the Holy Ghost your whole life and go to hell he isn't referring to the translation of the of the transformation of of the Soul he's speaking of The Next Step the Pentecostal Holy Spirit was not the new birth it was the moving of the Holy Spirit on the flesh through manifested signs wonders gifts you could have that and go to hell but you can't have Zoe eternal life God went to hell already meaning that I'll never have to go to hell listen friends I'm not afraid of hell because Jesus already conquered it and I'll never have to go because I'm in Jesus and when he died I died when he Rose when he was buried brother and sisters I was buried and when he rose I rose with him and so you've got to go through sanctification and then you've got to go through the Lord moving on you on you to give you that Holy Ghost but then brother random uses a term in the scripture it's very biblical and I'm going to get to it here in a moment over and over and over again you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire yeah amen now it's amazing because this is one of the things that we get back from Holy Spirit we don't say holy ghost we say holy ghost and we don't say and fire but if you want to be biblical go back to what the word said the word the that he shall baptize you behold his fan is in his hand and he cometh quickly John said and he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire Hallelujah that word used throughout all of the Old Testament and the New Testament our God is a consuming fire the Pillar of Fire was a pillar of fire and it led the children of Israel by day A Cloud by Night Pillar of Fire by Night A Cloud by day and so you've got to move but is God done there no brother vam says then we move from the Holy Ghost meaning on your flesh to the Holy Ghost himself amen and that is the very nature the token that is the token you don't have the token at any other stage outside of that one when the life of your sacrifice leaves your sacrifice and comes back on your nature a baby is not born until they come through all the stages that constitutes a birth can you say amen amen I go back to it again many times this is what we have as birth complications and birth complications lead to longterm life problems yes amen amen because of a complication in birth because something was missed because something was bypassed you say brother Matt brother brandom didn't preach that you're going back to the pre- seals oh no friends leadership 1965 the one of the last sermon second to last tape sermons brother Bram ever preaches you go back to leadership and brother Bram talks about justification sanctification being born again baptized with the Holy Ghost this is not a principle that he came up with himself this is right out of your Bible yes amen amen we don't have time to to to Really unpack that so I just trust the Lord reveals it to you supernaturally because I don't really have time to to to go too deep into it today and in case you're wondering I got my timer going amen then we asked the question well then what is the brother Matt you're preaching on the autopsy of a dead Revival that's right we'll get to it then we say what is brother Matt here's another question then what is the evidence that I have been born again do I need to feel something will I feel something will I speak in tongues will I shout will I cry does the fruits of the spirit matter will I have them does the gifts of the Spirit matter will I have them all of these are good questions amen listen to what brother bam says here and I'm just going to read our first slide Now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and in the third Embers may be glowing slight L but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame right and so what does God do God just kicks it out says oh well abort it Mission abort we failed sorry no God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated now I'm talking to you about ages this was the cycle of the ages this was the cycle of the judges while the judge lived they served God but when the judge died they suddenly fell away it's so incredible we were in New Zealand me and my wife brother Travis sister Deborah there for uh for uh a few couple weeks and as we went down to the Milford Sound I seen something so powerful as we were on a 4-Hour bus ride down to the Milford Sound and just a beautiful gorgeous uh I had to say on all of my videos as I was I felt this is naturally came as I'm videotaping this I I say to the onlooker uh though you may think I've passed away and this is heaven it's actually not I'm still here that's about how beautiful it was but as I I watch and you see these mountains with just these massive trees and all my goodness and the the the driver of the bus he was just a wonderful tour guide and he was just pointing out everything about the rivers and the creeks and the water and you know the volcanic that it's there on the rings of fire and all of these great mountains that were there get out and take pictures of it and you just see these great just monstrosity of mountains and and just these these trees and he said is it isn't it so amazing that these look at these pine trees I mean some Pines that were just shooting up 50 60 feet some of them you know even taller than that and right on the sheer Mountain face there'd be just trees going all the way up with an angle just a steep angle and it says isn't amazing uh he says isn't it so amazing just looking at those trees he said notice look there's no soil the trees aren't planted in any kind of soil notice where they're rooted to they're actually rooted to the Rock I wanted to say preach and he says notice their their root is in the Rock it's actually rooted to the Rock the foundation and he says that's what's holding the tree from falling is that they're planted rooted in the Rock and we came down through a certain uh spot of the mountain he said now I want you to notice in the middle of that mountain you have all these trees but in the middle and he said this is what we call a mountain Scar and you could see down the middle it almost looked like what you'd cut a power line through but they hadn't it was natural and it was just a bare spot that went all the way down to the bottom and it was missing trees and he said this is this very tragic thing that happens sometimes it's called a tree Avalanche and he says what happens is he said actually the trees that you're looking at when you look at all of the trees and he said you're actually looking at a lot of trees then he says but not all of the trees you are seeing are actually planted in the rocket and he says but there's actually only a few what we call Anchor trees and he says these anchor trees are the trees that are planted to the Rock and their roots are grabbed on to the to the granite and he says but all the rest of the Field trees that you see that look like the mountain they're actually holding on to the Anchor trees yes in other words their experience is not tied to the Rock their experience has now only been tied to the preacher the pastor the grandmother the papa they were raised in the message Mom and Dad they're holding on they're grasping now they're still standing they look beautiful they have tree they have all of the same look they have the needles of the pine they have everything all the life but the life that they're living is off of the anchor tree I'm afraid friends that's the problem it's a good thing it's all right for you to be anchored to Mom or anchored to Dad or an to a testimony but you've got to take your roots and put them down in the Rock of Ages they were held on he said they're actually interwoven into the life of that anchor tree and he says but the risk of that is that when one of those anchor trees fall and he says and it loses root it doesn't just fall itself it's an avalanche and it pulls all of those trees down with it amen amen it's what we've seen happen in our own ranks what we looked at as anchor trees who have fallen and many people because they were only ever attached to a denominational name or christon name or a Christian and name only and when that anchor tree fell down they had no root within themselves and they came tumbling down the mountain and it left a scar down the side of the mountain brother Adam says this is what happened happens through those judges Cycles judges a judge would live he would die then the children of Israel go back into Caleb brother Caleb uh taught on it today it's amazing if you ever look at what he was teaching on the end of Judges it's just a terrible sad story horrible and and The Tribe of Benjamin is almost completely wiped out amen manasse is gone just a Carnage of of of the of you say brother Matt what is it the result of result of having an experience that was only tied to a judge and never anchored within themselves and then that cycle repeats and then God would light the fire again and that same process did you know is repeated seven times in the Book of Judges notice what the prophet says here he says the same process is repeated the fervent you say brother Matt you're preaching on the autopsy of a dead Revival all right let me get to my sermon here somebody say preach brother Matt so notice here this is the this is the autopsy you say what are the signs of a Revival that is dying how do I know that my Revival is at risk as we preach to you on the spirit of Revival and that word Revival just means to save one who's at risk of becoming a corpse what's missing what do we look for what are some of the outward evidence that that Revival's dying the fervent somebody say that word fervent f f say it fervently the fervent something different when you say it that way the fervent yeah desire I love that to please God the passion the passion to know his word yes amen the cry listen friends if the only sermon you get is the sermon on Sunday if the I just want to say if the only diet on the message of the hour is when I'm displaying quotes you have lost your fervent desire come on let's be honest we have lost the passion to know his word if the only time we ever lay before him is when we come to church on Wednesday or we we don't even make it sometimes then or on Sunday come on amen the cry for reaching out in the spirit amen oh begins oh so you mean that the cry for reaching out in the spirit is not replaced now that we've come to the age of maturity brother M you know now that church ages are over that's what I've heard said and now you know it's the word and the word only and that was that that Holy Spirit was you know the Holy Ghost dispensation is over we've moved beyond the that's what they're preaching some people are preaching now it's sad it's so sad to say some of my brothers that that now we've moved into the Capstone and I believe all of that headstone I believe I preached on that Wednesday we've moved into the age of maturity We Don't Preach Calvary anymore we don't we don't preach Calvary anymore on We Don't Preach the book of Acts anymore we don't preach the book of listen brother M that this message didn't come to you know didn't come just to take us back to Pentecost it come to take us back to Eden Christ is the mystery of God revealed what do he say a restored Eden you say brother Matt do you believe that with all of my heart but can I just say you will never never get to Eden unless you come to Pentecost and you will never come to Pentecost if you don't come to Mount Calvary it's got to start at the right place and it will finish in the right destination this message comes to take us back to Eden I believe that but it came to what's going to take us to Eden brother a true fireborn experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that burns in our very Soul amen we've got a fervency a passion to know his word and one doesn't do away with the next that's brother bam never taught that right even in the account down he doesn't say that the jet aircraft did away with the automobile the astronaut didn't do away with the jet aircraft he said this way one compliments the next you say brother M you believe we're living in the age of the astronaut brother I believe we're living further than the age of the astronaut the prophet said beyond the astronaut is the intelligence they got artificial intelligence today but we've got the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with his word it's the Capstone The Headstone amen but you will never get the headstone if you don't come through the First Foundation hello can you say Amen am he says that notice what's happened the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade so in other words these things aren't to fade as The Headstone nears the body did I give you can I give you the words of a Vindicated Prophet as The Headstone praise God we got the headstone let me let me preach what a prophet taught as The Headstone nears the body those in the body will be so much like Jesus they will be in his very image power of his power life of his life nature of his nature he says the full works of Jesus will be done in her life the full power that's his word the full power of the Holy Ghost I want it yes the Dynamics of this church will be a intellectual move intellectual sermons intellectual teaching listen friends I'm not preaching against anything but our services and our sermons got to be more than just a dry intellectual ABC and one plus one I'm all for Sunday school I'm all for teaching I believe in with all of my heart I believe we need more of it God sent teachers but he also sent Apostles he also sent prophets he also sent evangelists and to Maj your own one and minor on where God did minor is to re reject the truth of the Bible you say brother Matt what do we need we need them all we need all of the gifts of the Spirit all of the fruits of the spirit all of the Ephesians for Ministry oh do we have a church that says God give me everything that's your word meant to restore back to this end time church it's got to be more because brother bam said that he says it's got to be more than just teaching that's wonderful can I just say this if you can preach that and say Amen then you can say Amen to this it's got to be more than shouting it's got to be more than dancing it's got to be more than loud music I'm a fair friend I'm a fan of it but it's got to be something when brother bandam says when you're going down the the road in the car and you ain't got the music to whoop you up you'll still be shouting when you're at the workplace and nobody's around there's a bubbling desire to please God inside of your heart oh a real Revival ain't based on music it ain't based on emotion it's based on the word brother and it will bring emotion it'll bring music but we've got to have the word based Revival amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus he says notice it's cooled off and became a bit formal that's what was happening back there to the Ephesians the second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded the king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God that and read it is the history of the church it isn't long until you see them the autopsy of a dead Revival it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do can I give you the words of brother brandham brother Luther I'm glad I can can I give the rest of you the words of brother brandham God they all night prayer meetings yeah the altar calls this is what he said yeah stay at home on Wednesday night to watch an episode of television and he says all of those things begin to fade and instead of the church all of those things start do things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress isn't that amazing the way that they dress is a sign that the Revival's dead amen their attitudes is a sign that the Revival's dead you say attitude towards what towards his word their behavior is a sign they get laxed that's what Ephesus means relaxed drifting that cycle of Revival and death has never failed can you say Amen to his word let me find my place here where I'm at that cycle of Revival and death has never failed so listen what brother bam says he says every we finded Esau and Jacob before either child was born God so loved one and hated the other and remember they were twins same mother same father get it twins every Revival produces somebody say it with me twins amen every Revival produces twins certainly does there's twins born in a natural man and the spiritual man it was back in the Garden of Eden Cain and Abel the same thing started off from there just keeps coming on he goes to Jesus and Judas amen you could you could think of all of these examples it always produces twins he points to all the way back to Jacob and Esau he's looking at it together in New Zealand there and brother Travis had asked me what ever happened to Esau you hear the story about Jacob and Esau whatever happened we know what happens with Jacob he gets a name change Prince he's called you know with God he goes there and and and and and you know and you know the entire Story halts upon his thigh whatever happens to to Esau it's it's amazing when you look at this because brother Adam points to this to the twins of the Revival that would be twins brothers but one had respect unto the birthright and one really didn't care about it too much amen now what's amazing is that brother bham talks about Esau and his nature and Jacob and his nature and Esau was actually a very good man good by the sense of good of the word he was nice he was kind he you know but Jacob man he was just a low down rotten stinking Rascal but notice who God put the promise in not Esau but Jacob as I've said this here before Jacob Esau was a good man but Jacob was a God man and there's a very big difference between you might be good but there's only one that's good and that is God and so God looked at the seed or the potential inside of Jacob not his outward shell as he says you men look at the heart heart but God look God a man looks at the outward appearance but God looks at the heart aren't you glad for that he doesn't look at your outward appearance he's not looking at your track record he's looking at his word his seed his promise and so notice here because Jacob goes One Way Esau we know establishes the kingdom of Edom yeah you go and read the book of um Obadiah and Obadiah brings a prophecy against Edom you go look look in the Book of Malachi how many ever read that before and God says Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated I made his dens and his waste I've made his habitation A Wasteland amen and it's actually the prophecy of Obadiah of that twin of that Revival that Esau goes into the neev and he and he and his people become you know uh uh tent dwellers they be they they they go from uh place to place and they they tell so Obadiah tells this originally we have this original pattern of Revival producing Twins and he tells of these two Nations Esau I'm sorry Israel and Edom the nation of Edom and so you notice all the way back in the word when Israel under Moses is going through the promised land you remember that in the scripture that it was Edom who withstood them yeah amen right yes these were Esau 's descendants and made their their Journey very difficult it was Esau when they they traveled the Israel the Bible says traveled through the land of Edom and the gave them a lot of trouble and they were enemies enemies with Israel from the very beginning it's amazing because God almost took Jacob and Esau Esau as two Nations and he almost took it's like the Bible produces a shadow of these two men and the Nations that go behind them and it's like an overarching principle found all the way through the Bible the Apostle Paul picks it up and says speaking about election and says Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and then Paul takes it further and says and he made that choice before either was born or either had done good or evil is that what her Bible says yeah amen and so and he says this these words that election that he election yes for knowledge might stand yes prise God and so so God shows this here and you say whatever happened we me brother Travis talking about it to the well in the sixth Century you go and look up historically and the Arabs actually came in and overtook this entire land of Edom expelled them completely out of their Kingdom just as Obadiah had prophesied the exact same way that Obadiah prophesized that exact actually exactly how it came through how how it came to pass and so the Arabs attack them they flee to the mountains and they go into what if you look on a map there the rift valley and then they go from the rift valley down into the netive and then they they they live there in the desert you think they're gone think they're just done away with annihilated but actually they were still alive and so the neev in your Bible is renamed and it's actually renamed as an if from the Edomite word edia if you ever look up edia that's the and they lived in this place called edia and they lost their cities and now they live in the desert say well what happened then this is incredible then later go a little bit further came a day when one of those from the Negev leaves edia travels to Jerusalem and makes a deal actually with Julius Caesar and says give me an Edomite the Throne of Jerusalem he was a client King a hirling he wasn't a Jew he was an Edomite and he makes a deal with Julius Caesar and says would you sell me the throne in Israel in Jerusalem and you know what that Roman Emperor did he gave it to him yeah you say what was his name brother Matt Herod Herod the Edomite amen now you see what it means when brother Ram says every Revival Here Comes Jesus every Revival produces twins yeah Church natural Church spiritual and so that Herod the Edomite you could imagine now he's on the throne and when the wise men come and they say where is he born King King Herod said King of the Jews and so he kills every every boy in in in in the in the in that City why because he wasn't going to let some Jew take the throne he had already taken the throne and so you say brother Matt where does it stop it doesn't stop there herod's son this is amazing herod's son was the man who killed John the Baptist amen you remember the words of a Vindicated Prophet when he said the carnal false church will always persecute the true church amen but bride cannot persecute bride so who are we showing our lineages from when we persecute bride I'm not talking about disagreeing that's one thing we can disagree but bride can't persecute Bride Can you say Amen his son killed John the Baptist his grandson was Herod the one that was ate by worms in the book of Acts his great grandson was a man named Agrippa who died in 100 AD without children without a lineage and the Disappeared why prophecy yes amen of Obadiah amen but I want to tell you that Spirit of twins continued on right we're going to we're out of time I'm three minutes in overtime sudden death soon as we score a touchdown we'll go home so you're going to be pulling now right I'm out of time I can't get to it and that's all right so every Revival produces twins amen I'm going to go through these two that I read already uh let me see if I want to get to this listen what brother bam talks about I just want to close here this is where I'll close thank you Lord let's imagine it's Monday that's the woman's worst day I'll let that sit here for a moment let's imagine it's Monday as brother bam talks about Abraham Sarah was in a temper you know had a real mood that day and it was Monday says it's a real you know woman's words day usually was listen it was when I was home I had to pack the wash water and everything and he says and I used to how I he says and and how I used to have to go cut them old Locust Limbs and Pull It in and stick it under the fire and bull the wash water and an old big old kettle on the outside my my he says remember she used to cook preserves I love this and I used to get in there I'd sweat you know in the summertime those little yellow gourd Tomatoes boy they're pretty good you know make preserves out of it put them home he says put them between hot biscuits on a cold morning I tell you they're fine and she'd poured in and I'd say ah Mama that Fire's hot enough she said oh they're not hot enough yet and Sh and they was just cooking and steaming I said why why they're they're not hot enough she said they have to go to popping before they're right popping said just keep pouring the wood till they go to popping bubbling you know the air coming up I think this is about how church should be you say well isn't it hot enough brother Matt we're saying amen no brother it ain't hot enough keep pouring the gospel on that fire keep pouring down those amens and that praise it'll start popping after a while I thought that was a pretty good illustration reminds me of a good old Holy Ghost meat and you're digging up some wood just keep throwing the fire till they start popping that's right get ready for sealing I love that get ready for sealing away then before you can get the iron hot he says get it ready to make something out of you have to get it hot put it under the Anvil beat the Sparks out of it it and let her go to molding out I love he says that in another message I remember Mom would get a great big kettle of them on cook them up i cho wood and put under there I'd say now mama he says the the them things are hot she said honey they got to get hotter I'd say why do they have to get any hotter she'd say they have to get so hot until they go to pop and go pop pop pop pop like that said then they're getting sweet praise God yeah amen amen notice not angry not b not jealous when the true move of the Holy Ghost is brother B says that's what I have against the Assemblies of God they shout they jump they dance they scream they got all of the manifestations but they got enough temper to fight a buzz saw listen when the Holy Ghost really comes in your heart you will shout you will jump you will pop but they'll produce such a sweetness out of you he says they'll get sweet after a while mixes all the juices everything that runs all the sugar with the juices and that runs them notice ready for what ready for them to be canned I thought that's about right with an oldtime Holy Ghost meeting just keep throwing the old gospel wood on there brother let her get hot enough till you have a testimony meeting pop poof pop poof pop like that runs all the devil out and gets the Holy Ghost munching around with the people like that sweetened up then you'd have an old-fashioned Revival just keep laying the wood on it blowing it just as hard as you can Fanning it God will take care of the rest of it it'll sweeten up the preserves and you can can them down now oh I wonder if this church wants that kind of Revival meeting in 2025 where we keep pouring the wood on it you say brother matter are we to get colder no brother we're to get hotter for the Holy Ghost burn Holy Ghost burn in me this ain't a revival can I just preach here for a moment this revival ain't about getting smarter even getting better getting our life you know so lined up with everything I believe in all of that but this message has got to be about a quickening power that makes us into the image of the word that changes our nature we've got enough love in our heart to love our enemy to love our brother we've got enough joy of the spirit that we don't mind saying Amen brother preach the word of God we've got the nature the character the gifts the life that's a true Revival it's a mixture of both is it one no it's one and the next it's be repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thou house shalt be saved it's all of it brother it's not just one part of it brother R says a true Revival will always point you to not one part of the word but all of the word amen you believe in the Beatitudes I do you believe it's important to be meek gentle kind lonely amen you believe it's important to shout I do speak in tongues I do gifts of healing I do good Lord I want them more than ever before Lord I want gifts of healing amen but notice it's all of them I just heard a message Sunday night from a brother how that we must confess there it is our faults one to another and pray one for another that we might be healed Hallelujah James 5141 1314 see we must confess our faults amen one to another before we even come yeah for healing amen look at Jesus nothing what what but one bundle of love he was God manifested God expressed through him no wonder Miracles and things happened his humble life consecrated life to come from being God to be a man here on Earth to express through himself that's what made him what he was I've always said what made Jesus to God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet could be so small amen you you I'm just going to close on this you know it's such an it's such an amazing thing thank you Lord I'm not going to get to I'm just going to have to pick a spot brother Adam talks so much about this and I didn't have time really to lay the foundation of this but but he talks about the Holy Ghost and Fire he shall baptize you Matthew chapter 3 John the Baptist is word he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost in fire you know Acts 2 chapter 3 and there under them clothing tongues like as a fire and it lighted it rested upon them and so it's amazing because repentance deals with your sin baptism deals with your guilt you're washing away you're taken away brother bam says does baptism save you no it doesn't it doesn't save you even though the scripture says baptism now does save us it's saving us but baptism is an outward expression that you've taken your stand with Jesus it's important it's a part of if you if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus there goes a birth uh birth complication right there amen but but that leads you to something greater it leads you to that Spirit life that life of Holy Ghost and Fire that life of TR the true baptism of the Holy Ghost with the Holy Ghost and Fire can I just have just a minute I'm feeling pressured can I just have a minute can you give give me Grace I going to be praying extra hard for my dad to get better I love this scripture Leviticus chapter 6 turn there if you could just before we close brother Mark if you want to put it up Leviticus chapter 6 almost open with this but I just want to bring this thought and and end it Leviticus 6 chapter chapter 6 verse 12 and uh if you get it in time good it's it's all right if we don't such a powerful scripture Leviticus 6:12 speaking about the fire and he says and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it it shall not be put out and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering and odor upon it and he shall burn thereof thereon the fat of the peace offering look at verse 13 the fire shall be sh the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar it shall never go out oh if I could just preach here for a moment and say Lord if I want a Revival I I want that kind of Revival God a fire that never goes out a fire that is constantly friends I just want to tell this is what the Lord inspired upon my heart I believe he did it for a reason we need a fresh Revival we need a stirring inside of our heart we need something something to wake us up again just talking with my mama I wish so bad you to finish that voice message but she got so lit up she's sending me audio messages telling me about her first experience when she came to the Lord how the Lord began to deal with her even before she came to the message about not cutting her hair and wearing you know not wearing pants and all of these things God began to do she started this to testify about some of the early original things that happened even in my papa's testimony she stopped there you know some of the supernatural things and I I just want to say friends I don't believe that it's that it's the that the evid that that there should I don't believe that should be lessening I believe that should be more and more and more as the as The Headstone nears the body we should be more on fire brother we should be more with passion if we ever had passion in our life to serve God it should be right now amen we ever needed Revival services oh they where you know you almost laugh at it sometimes I I just say it here today almost people almost get you know to the point you you you go to sometimes you go to church some Churches you know and some meetings you go to sometimes there's just an you go just for the anticipation of what might happen at that meeting and I've heard that criticized can I just say a not something can I blow your minds I don't believe that should be criticized I believe church should be something we go to with an anticipation to say I wonder what the Lord's going to do tonight I wonder what the Lord what would it be if all of us came with that expectation I wonder what's going to take place wonder who's what's going to happen come on Amen it's not the time to go backwards the fire shall be upon the altar it shall never go out say Lord don't let it ever don't let it ever go out Lord amen Lord Brother tells that story about the you remember that about the glacier yeah how many remember that story and and and brother bram's talking about it that that they uh in yane was it yane I think it was and he and he and he talks about how that you know that they all came for that great big old event and they had taken all of the trees that had fallen in yede and they would go up on the top of that mountain and they would the bulldozers would come and they just pile the you know all of the the the the uh the trees and all of the shrubs and all of the bushes and you know they'd pile it up in a big old pile and and and that they had this special event and and and it was it was it was where that they lit this big old thing on fire you could go see it in yosee even brother Brandon's time you know and they would gather all those trees that had falling and and and they would pile them upon this great big Stone part of the mountain and all these people would go go to the bottom of that mountain and and they would they would watch this great big massive pieces of wood these great big trees that had been pwed up and this great bonfire on the edge of this cliff and they you know they would come you know they would light it on fire and it would come cascading down and it looked like a waterfall how many remember this and he says it looked like a waterfall and he said it was just falling fire that would just fall down uh you know it would fall down to the bottom of the mountain and it was amazing because right before you know the the the when they would light it on fire you go read this I'm not making this up you go read this right out of the news I read it for myself this morning they'd go back they'd go to yane and thousands of people sometimes not thousands but hundreds of people down to the base of that mountain and it was a tradition that they would yell out Let the Fire Fall amen right and they would yell out Let the Fire Fall remember brother bam talks about that and he says then they'd push all that fire and it' come tumbling down that great big fire coming down the mountain it's so amazing because there was a man just recently who went there to yosee and he heard that and he went up to a park ranger and he said hey he said what time is you know that fire lightting event he says Oh you mean he says you you mean where we' you know the fire that come down the granite and the big waterfall of fire and he says yeah that one he says oh no the fire don't fall anymore come on how was his words we don't Let the Fire Fall they don't do that anymore and I just took that for a minute and thought you know something natural for safety reasons whatever reasons but I thought isn't that about like our churches now could that be said about us friends oh a Time way back before you know when the fire fell but we don't Let the Fire Fall anymore we don't Let the Fire Fall you know one time there was a bright burning brilliance passion one time there was a you know they there came with an expectation and the fire of God would rain down upon us oh but you know they got to the point to where firefighters got so sick of fighting fires even in yane to where they become real scientific about it and now they had devices and cameras that would pick it up and they'd put the fire out right away as soon as it lit it would fire you know what they found though and that that those Sherman Pines and some of those great big redwoods is that those seeds would actually cautify and they would become so hardened that they would never grow and so they instead of letting the Fire Fall because the fire would actually burn out the undergrowth and it would allow seeds new seeds to fall into the ground and to become germinated and New Forest oh boy I could have preached this my whole sermon New Forest would grow up but now they got so scientific about it they squelched the fire can I give you the words of the Bible quench not the the spirit don't quench it don't stop it there's a reason God sends a Revival fire it's to burn out all of the undergrowth so that new seed can come forth oh I believe we ought to have a church as I close today and say Let the Fire Fall God let the Revival fire I wonder if somebody would stand to their feet and say Let the Fire Fall oh God in my life Let the Fire Fall in our churches Let the Fire Fall God and bring such a Revival it brings repentance it brings faith it brings baptism it brings a new birth a born again trueu fire Born Again experience that burns everything that's unlike you Lord let it burn let it burn don't try to quench it they got to the point to where they so quenched the fire and so squelched the fire they thought they got smart about it that now they have no new life no new life you know I wonder if we could just say with our head bowed thank you Lord our eyes closed Lord I need new life New Life thankful for what you did in my life but I need new life Lord I need I'll be honest if you want I'll be honest and raise my hand and say Lord I need a fresh Revival I need a passion more passion to know your word I need a fervent desire to please God how many want that friend just raise a hand and say Lord I want a fervent desire to please you in my life I want a passion to know your word I want the cry for reaching out in the spirit Lord I don't want it to fade I want it to go grow brighter I want it to grow greater I want to know you more Lord in a great G way than I've known you you don't stop you've got to start at justification but friend you don't stop there you got to start at repentance but don't stop there you don't even stop when you get a real true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on your flesh you press on we've got to move Beyond as Paul said not laying again the foundation of repentance but let us move to Perfection I believe that's what God's calling this bride to move to maturity and perfection move up into the higher atmospheres don't become so Earthbound so Earthbound and as brother B him says that eagle was so chained down tied down but let us set ourselves free let oursel let our let our experience burn let it burn bright once again oh I just raise my hand and say that Lord with a sincere heart let my experience burn let it become a raging Inferno Lord a fire as Leviticus says that never shall be put out a fire that never grows cold oh that Fire's hot enough Mama it's not hot enough yet it's got to be popping you got to keep stoking it keep stoking it keep pouring on the wood keep on don't let your experience become ashes of what was yesterday oh friend if they become just ashes and church has just became just your tradition I I'm giving you an invitation right now I'm giving you an invitation to say Lord light the fire again in my life let it burn let it burn Holy Ghost Let There become let the Revival start right here not looking for some kind of you know I'm not looking for anything Lord other than you to move in my heart change me from this creature who I
