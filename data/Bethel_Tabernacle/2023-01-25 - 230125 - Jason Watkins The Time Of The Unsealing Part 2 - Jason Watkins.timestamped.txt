[33:24] Samuel was the writer of first and
[33:26] second Kings
[33:27] it's commonly held that Ezra penned the
[33:31] Chronicles which is why sometimes you'll
[33:33] find like in the gospels the same story
[33:35] told from a different angle amen and it
[33:39] can sometimes even look like differences
[33:42] in the story but the Bible is filled

[35:15] I started on the time of the unsealing
[35:18] and you're going to see why tonight on
[35:20] Sunday we stopped here we made reference
[35:22] to Nehemiah chapter eight but we want to
[35:25] go back there this evening and catch it
[35:28] Nehemiah chapter 8 and we're going to
[35:31] begin at verse 8 we'll catch 8 9 and 10.
[35:38] let's um yeah chapter verse 8.
[35:42] so they read in the book in the law of
[35:45] God distinctly
[35:47] and gave the sense and caused them to
[35:51] understand the reading you remember
[35:52] Sunday we were right here showing you
[35:54] that this is a type of the fivefold
[35:56] ministry because Ezra had taken the
[36:00] people back you can see in zerubbabel
[36:03] and Ezra and Nehemiah and you you find
[36:06] you know that zerubbubble went back to
[36:09] you know get get a get a the temple
[36:12] worship to restore worship and then Ezra
[36:15] come in behind him to re-establish the
[36:18] law and re-establish the word and then
[36:20] Nehemiah comes in behind that and he's
[36:23] got to build a wall and it deals with
[36:25] the walls of our lives and I've preached
[36:26] on that before let me tell you something
[36:28] friends God didn't just send a prophet
[36:30] to entertain the world
[36:32] he didn't send a message as I've said to
[36:35] you so many times the message isn't
[36:37] didn't come to fill you with better
[36:38] theology than the UPC and so it it came
[36:42] to to turn you into something it came to
[36:45] produce a life and that is really uh
[36:48] testifying to brother Chris as we were
[36:50] coming to church tonight brother Chris
[36:51] St John and we were I was saying you
[36:53] know the the the whole theme and and
[36:56] this is going to be important for you to
[36:57] get I'm going to let you be seated in a
[36:58] minute
[37:00] um but the the whole theme I want you to
[37:02] get in this series is that we're going
[37:06] to encapsulate the age to show us what
[37:09] God has done and where we are but a lot
[37:12] of that is will be rudimentary to us but
[37:15] what I what I the real burden and I hope
[37:19] you will come with these kinds of
[37:21] glasses on to look at it this way my
[37:24] real burden is
[37:27] is what will it take at the right at the
[37:30] end to for the people of the end time
[37:34] who know their God to do great exploits
[37:37] what's it going to take brother Brandon
[37:39] we we can talk all we want to about the
[37:41] third poll and we can talk about the
[37:43] spoken word and brother Brandon said a
[37:44] lot about it we can talk about the
[37:46] seventh under mystery in the seventh
[37:48] seal and there's a lot said about it
[37:50] we're going to say a lot about it but
[37:52] remember that every time a prophet came
[37:54] to that he started with God in
[37:57] Simplicity and when he finished it where
[38:00] does he come to the end of the seventh
[38:02] seal and he starts admonishing the
[38:04] people to just be a real Christian be a
[38:07] humble servant of God serve the Lord be
[38:11] consecrated be dedicated Amen in why
[38:14] Christ speak as listening to it today
[38:16] brother Branham same thing where he's
[38:18] talking about the power of the spoken
[38:20] word and he comes to the end of that
[38:21] sermon and he's imploring his own
[38:24] Tabernacle this is a time for
[38:25] rededication this is a time for
[38:28] consecration God is not Santa Claus
[38:33] verse 9.
[38:36] and Nehemiah which is the tershatha
[38:40] which is means a governor Nehemiah which
[38:43] is the governor in Ezra the priest The
[38:45] Scribe and the Levites that taught the
[38:48] people
[38:49] said unto all the people this day is
[38:53] Holy unto the Lord your God more not nor
[38:58] weep
[38:59] for all the people wept when they heard
[39:03] the words of the law you know why they
[39:06] were weeping
[39:07] because they were so broken-hearted for
[39:10] the lives they had lived
[39:12] and were and were under achieving in the
[39:15] promises of God and when they read what
[39:19] God had said in his word and they hadn't
[39:21] heard it in so long and they realized
[39:24] that their lives were a million miles
[39:26] from what they were supposed to be it
[39:29] broke their hearts that's a good way
[39:30] that's a good Broken Heart
[39:33] amen
[39:35] then he said unto them
[39:37] verse 10
[39:39] go your way
[39:41] eat the fat and drink the sweet and send
[39:45] portions unto them for whom nothing is
[39:47] prepared for this day is Holy unto the
[39:51] Lord neither be you sorry
[39:53] for the joy of the Lord is your strength
[39:58] let's pray
[40:00] father we thank you for your love and
[40:03] kindness to us Lord I'm just here Lord
[40:06] to carry on and put in another another
[40:09] fold of this thought Lord and another
[40:11] installment and we're only going to get
[40:13] so far tonight so father just help me
[40:16] now to have my thoughts crystallized
[40:18] according to your will I believe I have
[40:21] it and I'm committing it to you in Jesus
[40:23] name amen God bless you can be seated
[40:45] several days ago and just the Lord leads
[40:49] you in such amazing ways sometimes it
[40:52] even catches You by surprise and I was
[40:54] I've been studying this the I've had the
[40:58] notes creating working uh probably put
[41:01] my first installment of notes on this
[41:04] sermon probably several weeks ago
[41:07] and so it's just kind of been building
[41:09] and building I was finishing up other
[41:11] things waiting for the unction of the
[41:13] Lord and so we're coming now tonight to
[41:17] a part two uh uh in this series uh the
[41:22] time of the unsealing and the again the
[41:26] theme of the unsealing what was the
[41:29] unsealing The Mighty God unveiled in our
[41:31] day but that that was not as I as I was
[41:35] just saying that remember God didn't
[41:38] didn't bring the word to entertain us
[41:40] and we don't have all of these great and
[41:44] wonderful promises about the spoken word
[41:47] so that you can go out here and just
[41:50] create whatever you want to uh the whole
[41:53] premise is the life of Jesus because
[41:56] Jesus had that kind of power Jesus
[41:59] walked up to a tree and when he couldn't
[42:02] find what he wanted he said no man eat
[42:04] from thee forever and nothing happened
[42:06] at that moment a lot of times you say oh
[42:09] the power of the spoken word it's going
[42:11] to come right away we're going to say a
[42:12] lot about that it it's not as it's not
[42:15] as straightforward as you might think it
[42:16] is God remember this God is training us
[42:21] for a world to come
[42:23] you're in training even we're going to
[42:25] talk a little bit about tonight about
[42:28] overcoming adversity and trials and
[42:30] things that we go through and and how
[42:32] the joy of the Lord what's the real
[42:34] essence of the joy of the Lord because
[42:37] here it is in the days of Nehemiah right
[42:40] here at the end time because this time
[42:41] of the Feast of trumpets that's the
[42:43] millennium
[42:45] that's body change Feast of Tabernacles
[42:47] you understand Feast of Tabernacles
[42:50] refers to the body changes it's when
[42:52] we're headed home to a millennium how
[42:54] many want that and and so this is the
[42:57] time when you've had a zerubble come
[43:00] you've had a Ezra in tight come you've
[43:02] got a Nehemiah now who's hearing and
[43:05] nehemiah's not even a preacher so now
[43:07] you ought to really set up and pay
[43:10] attention because I'm not talking about
[43:12] Ezra I'm talking about Nehemiah he was
[43:15] just a governor
[43:16] this is you this is your everyday life
[43:18] because Nehemiah was coming back to
[43:21] re-establish people in their life
[43:25] that it wasn't just going to be oh Ezra
[43:27] gave you the word now you've got a lot
[43:29] of theology old ceruval will come back
[43:31] and they laid the foundation and you're
[43:33] going to have a new you're going to have
[43:34] a new uh you're going to get a new
[43:36] church
[43:37] but when Nehemiah came
[43:39] the walls were crumbling
[43:41] and the gates were burned and nobody
[43:45] cared and the the the preachers were out
[43:48] in the fields like farmers and nobody
[43:50] was caring about about what it meant to
[43:53] live the word of God and we have come
[43:55] down in this last day dear friends we
[43:58] have come down and we say this is the
[43:59] end time this is the time of the spoken
[44:01] word and oh my it's a rejoicing time and
[44:04] truly it is a rejoicing time
[44:08] but the key to the rejoicing and I want
[44:12] to say this real clear
[44:14] your key to the joy of the Lord starts
[44:18] with a broken heart
[44:21] it's it's got to start there it's got to
[44:24] start in in a in a cleanness
[44:28] that comes from a repentive heart that
[44:32] cleans itself of the world that that's
[44:35] when the joy of the Lord because
[44:38] remember it's the joy of the Lord
[44:43] so it's supernatural
[44:46] and and so I I was I in my even in my
[44:49] morning study all this week in in days
[44:53] past I kept coming across across various
[44:56] nuggets and in the family altar with
[44:58] brother branaman uh streams and
[45:01] different places that I was reading I I
[45:04] read this one scripture uh in streams
[45:07] because here here's something that we
[45:10] talk about a lot
[45:12] and it's a scripture and and this is
[45:15] more of a paraphrase than the than the
[45:17] King James version but I think this is
[45:19] maybe New King James Version but you've
[45:21] heard it you've read it you've saw
[45:22] probably a sign laughter doeth good like
[45:25] a medicine
[45:28] and that's wonderful
[45:29] happiness and you know contentment is is
[45:34] very valuable
[45:36] to learn but you have to learn to be
[45:38] content because real contentment doesn't
[45:42] doesn't rely on stuff
[45:46] see so that that's just anybody say oh
[45:50] I'm content well if you've got a couple
[45:52] of mill in the bank
[45:53] and you got and you got perfect health
[45:55] and everybody likes you I guess you are
[45:58] content
[46:00] but real contentment is achieved
[46:05] and it's arrived at
[46:08] it takes uh it takes some overcoming it
[46:12] takes some victory it takes some
[46:13] adversity laughter doeth good like a
[46:16] medicine
[46:17] but the Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes 7
[46:21] 3 sorrow is better than laughter
[46:24] now imagine that
[46:26] yeah I come out here today and go hey
[46:28] laughter laughter with good luck of
[46:30] medicine we'd all go oh yeah oh oh it's
[46:32] going to be a wonderful sermon tonight
[46:33] and then I turn around and say yeah but
[46:35] sorrow is better than laughter
[46:40] Ecclesiastes 7 3 sorrow is better than
[46:43] laughter catch it now here's why it's
[46:45] not just going to make a statement and
[46:47] leave you hanging it's going to tell you
[46:48] why
[46:49] for by the sadness of the countenance
[46:52] The Heart Is Made better
[46:56] so you know
[46:58] we find that
[47:00] that sorrow
[47:03] is better for heart disease than
[47:07] laughter
[47:10] according to the Bible
[47:13] now remember that
[47:16] when brother Branham talks about
[47:18] you know by speaking about biology and
[47:21] speaking quoting science of his day and
[47:23] it's still True to this day
[47:25] and he starts talking about he says you
[47:27] know they say the number one killer is
[47:30] heart disease
[47:31] and brother Branham says I don't want to
[47:34] tell the doctor his business he said but
[47:36] I disagree with that he said the
[47:38] greatest problem is sin disease
[47:42] Hearts full of sin so while laughter
[47:46] could do good like a medicine sorrow is
[47:49] better than laughter
[47:50] for the for a heart that is diseased
[47:54] with sin
[47:57] fact is the greatest heart disease as
[48:00] brother Brandon would say is sin disease
[48:03] you know people always I shouldn't say
[48:06] always but more often I find it too
[48:09] often let me say it that way over the
[48:11] years pastoring and ministering around
[48:13] the world I find so many times that
[48:16] people will you know take off and run
[48:19] down the road of sin young people they
[48:21] get raised in a Christian home and
[48:23] they're protected and kept in the church
[48:25] and the preachers praying for them and
[48:27] they're just bound and determined
[48:30] to go to go wild and it seemed like no
[48:33] matter what you do sometimes you can't
[48:35] stop it and you struggle and fight with
[48:37] it and I've seen them go down the road
[48:39] of sin and then you know if they're a
[48:42] child of God it's not very long before
[48:44] their life capsizes
[48:47] I mean it can relate to that
[48:51] and it's one thing you know if you come
[48:56] contrite heart
[48:57] amazing friends I want to say to you
[48:59] today it is astonishing the amount of
[49:03] sin God will forgive in a moment
[49:06] if you come to him with a contrite heart
[49:10] you can reverse years
[49:13] oh I could almost cry you can reverse
[49:16] years
[49:17] Decades of the most heinous ungodliness
[49:22] in a moment
[49:24] with the right kind of heart and
[49:25] approach to God with a broken spirit and
[49:29] raised hands and tears streaming and say
[49:32] look God forgive me and in a moment
[49:36] he just wipes it away as if you never
[49:38] did it at all
[49:40] and you're instantly a son or daughter
[49:43] restored
[49:46] sometimes we have the scars of sin left
[49:48] by
[49:49] left over and the Lord even helps us
[49:52] with those but you know the the the when
[49:55] we find that too often times
[49:58] two more times than I'm comfortable with
[50:00] I find people running down the road of
[50:03] sin their life capsizes and they they
[50:05] get all depressed and they get all
[50:08] discouraged and they come around the
[50:10] family of God and they just want God to
[50:13] make them happy
[50:15] foreign
[50:16] make me happy again but it but it's true
[50:20] sorrow over your sin is the medicine you
[50:26] need not happiness
[50:30] it's the greatest real true
[50:34] brokenheartedness and repentance is the
[50:37] greatest medicine you can receive from
[50:40] God because you can't get there on your
[50:43] own it's God rich in Mercy drawing your
[50:47] heart breaking your heart driving you to
[50:50] an altar you're not just down there some
[50:52] people are they're just they just want
[50:54] out of their jam
[50:56] and there's as math as brother Matthew
[50:58] Watkins preach preached some time ago
[51:00] people can get very sorry for the result
[51:03] of what sin got him into they're very
[51:05] regretful over it but they're not but
[51:07] that's a far cry from being sorry over
[51:10] the sin itself
[51:14] see
[51:16] so you know when sorrow
[51:19] comes under
[51:20] the power of God's grace
[51:23] then it that's really where God can move
[51:28] in your life you know I I read this on
[51:32] one of my devotional one of the mornings
[51:35] says God never uses anybody
[51:39] to a large degrees referencing Genesis
[51:41] 29 I'm sorry Genesis 49 22 God never
[51:44] uses anybody to a large degree until
[51:47] after he breaks that one all to pieces
[51:52] brother Branham talks about that he says
[51:54] the only way to get the fragrance out of
[51:56] the Rose is to crush it
[51:59] and it talks about how that how that
[52:01] Joseph you know he he was he was it was
[52:04] said of Joseph that he is a fruitful
[52:06] bowel and he lives by a well he's like a
[52:10] he's like a tree planted by the a great
[52:12] whale whose branches just flourish and
[52:15] just run right over the wall you can't
[52:17] even contain him he's so flourishing but
[52:19] let me tell you something Joseph had
[52:21] more trouble and adversity and sorrow
[52:23] that he had to go through than all of
[52:26] his brothers combine
[52:29] he had more sorrow than all the sons of
[52:32] Jacob in it but yet
[52:34] that path LED joke LED Joseph to bring
[52:39] to be the giver of bread
[52:43] to a starving Nation
[52:47] think about that now friends
[52:49] see
[52:50] it takes its it was said I I wrote this
[52:53] quote down it said it takes sorrow to
[52:56] widen the soul and because this was so
[52:57] on my heart I thought my that is so so
[53:00] poignant and so true
[53:01] you know because what you know and you
[53:04] you know you could you you might could
[53:06] say here tonight oh brother Jason what
[53:08] happened to the joy of the Lord
[53:09] can can you can you can you get back to
[53:11] the joy of the Lord you know I'm here to
[53:14] tell you that what I'm preaching tonight
[53:15] is much more effective to widen your
[53:18] soul
[53:19] and it really is the pathway to the joy
[53:23] of the Lord because as I said to you
[53:25] already you need to realize that the joy
[53:28] of the Lord is a reward for faithfulness
[53:32] it's a reward for diligence
[53:36] see
[53:37] and so it's it's remember it's the joy
[53:40] of the Lord
[53:42] as I've already said in my opening
[53:44] statement you could tell I was ready to
[53:45] preach this
[53:47] it's a supernatural force in fact is
[53:50] it's so Supernatural that it doesn't
[53:52] even require a state of happiness
[53:57] or blessing at all
[54:00] at all it doesn't require a state of
[54:02] happiness it doesn't re the joy of the
[54:05] Lord doesn't require blessing at all
[54:08] it doesn't it doesn't require good news
[54:11] the joy realize that the joy of the Lord
[54:15] it literally maintains its faithfulness
[54:18] even in the midst of the deepest trials
[54:21] how many have experienced that kind of
[54:23] joy of the Lord
[54:26] it maintains its Effectiveness its
[54:29] efficacy its faithfulness even in the
[54:31] midst of deep trials even in sometimes
[54:35] seemingly impossible
[54:37] tribulations that
[54:40] threatened to consume you
[54:43] how many have been there
[54:45] if you've been alive on the earth any
[54:47] time at all job said you're only a few
[54:49] days anyway
[54:51] and you're full of trouble
[54:53] and you don't have to be very old
[54:55] to run into a lot of trouble
[54:59] you know but but remember that it is the
[55:02] joy of the Lord
[55:04] that comes from a Victorious Life
[55:08] that outlasts and he thinks Satan can
[55:11] throw at you
[55:13] oh my what's that what's that line
[55:16] sister M that how long Outlast this
[55:20] what this Darkness yeah because I am I
[55:24] long Outlast this Darkness because the
[55:26] Lord is fighting on my side or something
[55:27] like that
[55:29] yeah cause you're with me in this fight
[55:31] whoa
[55:32] oh my every time I I get to feeling too
[55:36] bombarded by the enemy I'll get online
[55:38] and pull up Sister Emily's song and I'll
[55:40] just sit there in my dark living room
[55:42] early in the morning and I'll as she
[55:44] comes to that line I'll long Outlast
[55:46] this Darkness man
[55:48] whoa I'm like hear me devil I'm gonna
[55:51] long Outlast this Darkness you're not
[55:53] gonna get me I'm gonna keep fighting and
[55:56] when I'm done I'll fight some more
[55:58] Hallelujah I'm determined to be an
[56:00] overcomer
[56:02] I will long Outlast this Darkness this
[56:05] Dark World this dark laodicea Hallelujah
[56:09] I'm not minimizing friends I'm not here
[56:12] to minimize your hard trials but get it
[56:14] that fiery trials are the tools God uses
[56:20] to make you a fruitful bow as Joseph for
[56:23] a fruitful field I mean it's the very
[56:25] sharp and hard plow that the farmer uses
[56:31] to make a fruitful field
[56:34] and and we know that Jesus said I my my
[56:38] father is I I'm the vine you're the
[56:41] branches my father is the farmer
[56:43] the husbandman
[56:45] the gardener
[56:47] and and and you know it the these are
[56:50] things that happen in our lives and they
[56:52] come our way and sometimes you know we
[56:55] don't understand why the Lord can allow
[56:58] certain things but you just remember
[57:00] that that that that it is these fiery
[57:03] trials that God uses can I say it this
[57:05] way and I hope it'll make you I hope you
[57:07] don't think I'm minimizing your trials
[57:08] it's it's those trials that God used to
[57:13] fill you with abundance
[57:15] I don't mean zeros in your bank account
[57:17] I'm talking about the joy of the Lord
[57:21] I when I in fact is when I I didn't
[57:24] realize it this evening when I opened my
[57:26] Bible to to find my place where for my
[57:29] text
[57:30] and my family got me this Spurgeon Bible
[57:32] I love it my favorite Bible ever had uh
[57:35] for Christmas or a birthday I don't
[57:36] remember and he literally I couldn't
[57:40] believe it he literally starts talking
[57:43] about the joy of the Lord
[57:47] and he goes right into repentance
[57:50] when I said you've got to be kidding
[57:53] and he says this he says
[57:55] as certain Fabrics need to be dampened
[57:58] before they will take the glowing colors
[58:01] with which they are to be adorned so our
[58:03] Spirits need the grace of repentance
[58:06] before we can receive the radiant
[58:08] coloring of delight
[58:12] and it's thought how profound that was
[58:17] he starts talking about you know
[58:20] it's if there's ever seen a you know a
[58:23] clearer shining than that which follows
[58:26] a shower
[58:28] the flowers are glistening he said
[58:30] raindrops the Sun comes out and
[58:32] raindrops turn into would look like
[58:34] gemstones
[58:35] but what what took that the showers
[58:38] and and he starts talking he makes the
[58:40] statement at the end I just thought he
[58:42] said the steps by which we Ascend to the
[58:46] Palace of delight are usually moist with
[58:49] tears
[58:52] I just thought there was such strength
[58:54] in that because listen friends I'm not
[58:55] here tonight to to go into a series
[58:58] where you know it it we've we've had a
[59:01] lot of rejoicing and shouting over the
[59:03] word of God but I've had such a burden
[59:05] on my heart because I can I go back and
[59:07] I can see every type like here in
[59:09] Nehemiah and I realize it's coming to
[59:11] the time of the Feast of Tabernacles and
[59:13] he's saying you know yet the people are
[59:16] Weeping and they're Brokenhearted
[59:18] and and they and it ought to be it
[59:21] rightly so because that meant that
[59:23] zerubbabel hadn't ran in vain and Ezra
[59:25] hadn't preached in vain and Nehemiah
[59:27] hadn't governed in vain I'm here to tell
[59:29] you your life's not in vain it's
[59:31] counting for something
[59:34] there's a mighty God with a book of
[59:36] remembrance and and he he has a promise
[59:38] that there will be a people brother
[59:40] Branham you know I was I was listening
[59:42] the other day to um
[59:45] as I was with Moses one of my favorite
[59:47] sermons that's the sermon if you ever
[59:49] hear me down here sometimes I don't
[59:51] always say it when I feel inspired
[59:53] I felt an evil spirit trying to resist I
[59:56] just remind him what a prophet said that
[59:59] as a servant of God brother ministers as
[1:00:03] Servants of God according to Elijah we
[1:00:06] are commissioned and commanded to stand
[1:00:10] in the steps of Jesus Christ and to
[1:00:12] perform his works
[1:00:15] there's no option on it Brothers we have
[1:00:17] to keep our lives dedicated and sincere
[1:00:20] before God we have to stay prayed up and
[1:00:23] on fire we have to we have to constantly
[1:00:25] move ourselves in the direction of
[1:00:27] Victory and we do make mistakes and we
[1:00:29] do get down but but uh but I know the
[1:00:32] path to the joy of the Lord all I got to
[1:00:34] do is get down on my knees and begin to
[1:00:36] say Lord God help me I'm sorry forgive
[1:00:39] me and then a joy unspeakable it doesn't
[1:00:42] even matter if the circumstances change
[1:00:45] there's no bearing on the joy of the
[1:00:47] Lord I don't need happiness
[1:00:50] our blessing
[1:00:54] we're here to fight friends we're here
[1:00:56] to
[1:00:57] take the enemy's ground away from him I
[1:01:00] want you to absorb that tonight
[1:01:03] we're here not just to
[1:01:07] hold Satan at Bay I get that he that
[1:01:10] letteth will let till he be taken out of
[1:01:11] the way but as I've said to you many
[1:01:14] times before
[1:01:16] the Lord didn't save you
[1:01:18] at an altar you know and say okay your
[1:01:22] safety in heaven
[1:01:25] and I and I usually follow that up with
[1:01:27] you know we are hoping to board The Old
[1:01:30] Ship of Zion someday but
[1:01:33] the Lord never told me to go down to the
[1:01:35] docks and sit on my luggage
[1:01:41] I I need to be I need to be in the fight
[1:01:45] uh God is has raised up soldiers
[1:01:49] and I'm here to tell you something
[1:01:50] friends a lot of times you we have to go
[1:01:53] through adversity to get us there and
[1:01:55] it's too bad brother Branham said
[1:01:56] sometimes we need a faith and the level
[1:01:59] of faith we need is going to only have
[1:02:01] to be fueled by desperation and
[1:02:03] unfortunately we can't get ourselves
[1:02:05] desperate enough so God has to bring
[1:02:07] something in our lives that makes us
[1:02:10] desperate and then the desperations like
[1:02:11] a factory and it starts producing the
[1:02:13] faith and then you start going forward
[1:02:16] and this is God's way why does it
[1:02:19] surprise us no wonder Peter said don't
[1:02:20] think it's strange when fiery Trials
[1:02:22] come they're they're to grow you they're
[1:02:25] to widen your heart widen your soul
[1:02:27] widen your mind
[1:02:30] foreign
[1:02:37] it's much more effective
[1:02:39] way of
[1:02:41] widening your soul
[1:02:46] Abraham overcame a lot of adversity and
[1:02:49] Abraham
[1:02:50] you know it's it's amazing sometimes we
[1:02:53] forget
[1:02:55] what a uh
[1:02:57] what an amazing Warrior
[1:03:00] Abraham was
[1:03:02] amen we just think of him as a sheep
[1:03:04] herder a simple humble man who probably
[1:03:07] never
[1:03:08] you know raised his voice
[1:03:12] who just walked on humble he was a you
[1:03:14] know his great man of faith and you know
[1:03:16] he just he just lived this kind of a
[1:03:19] stale life of just wandering around the
[1:03:21] desert and God talking to him
[1:03:23] Abraham lived real life
[1:03:25] Abraham had to settle domestic problems
[1:03:28] in his home
[1:03:30] had to settle domestic problems between
[1:03:32] him and his wife
[1:03:33] he had to settle domestic problems
[1:03:35] between him and his Kinfolk
[1:03:37] he had to understand how to prosper and
[1:03:40] he had to understand he understood how
[1:03:42] to get in trouble and he he had to learn
[1:03:44] how to be honest and confess his sin and
[1:03:46] repent and let God restore him
[1:03:49] he kept having to learn that one
[1:03:52] but you know when you when you when you
[1:03:54] read in the in Genesis where let's let's
[1:03:58] look at Genesis 14 Ethan I'm sorry to
[1:04:01] jump you I I didn't warn you but
[1:04:05] um give me Genesis 14 if you can get
[1:04:07] that up I want to just read
[1:04:10] um I'm going to say start around verse
[1:04:12] 10 maybe I'm just guessing
[1:04:15] ah
[1:04:18] go to 11.
[1:04:21] okay so this is where you've got a bunch
[1:04:24] of Kings
[1:04:25] who teamed up and came into the valley
[1:04:28] and stormed the gates of Sodom and
[1:04:31] Gomorrah and you remember the story they
[1:04:33] took a bunch of people captive and took
[1:04:35] all their money and all their treasure
[1:04:37] and took lot his nephew and his wife and
[1:04:39] his children and his in-laws his
[1:04:41] daughter-in-laws and son-in-laws and
[1:04:43] daughters and son-in-laws I meant to say
[1:04:45] and and and watch this now and they took
[1:04:48] all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:04:50] all their evictions and went their way
[1:04:51] verse 12.
[1:04:53] and they took lot Abram's brother's son
[1:04:57] who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and
[1:05:00] departed
[1:05:01] verse 13.
[1:05:03] and there came one that had escaped and
[1:05:06] told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in
[1:05:09] the plane of memory the Amorite brother
[1:05:13] of s of escal and brother of Anna and
[1:05:17] these were Confederate with Abram verse
[1:05:20] 14. and when Abram heard that his
[1:05:23] brother was taken captive he armed his
[1:05:27] trained servants born in his own house
[1:05:30] 318 and pursued them unto Dan
[1:05:34] and he divided himself look at this this
[1:05:37] is a strategist I mean this guy is
[1:05:40] amazing and he divided himself against
[1:05:42] them he and his servants by night
[1:05:45] do you notice that the Bible said they
[1:05:47] were not just servants these were
[1:05:49] trained servants
[1:05:51] all he did was arm them they were
[1:05:53] already trained
[1:05:55] all right
[1:05:56] and and his servants by night
[1:05:59] and he smote them and pursued them unto
[1:06:03] hobot which is on the left hand of
[1:06:04] Damascus and he brought back how much
[1:06:09] all the goods and also brought again his
[1:06:13] brother lot and his goods and the women
[1:06:16] also and the people
[1:06:18] that's enough Ethan thank you
[1:06:21] and you know when you think about it I
[1:06:23] mean
[1:06:24] Abraham is a brilliant man I mean just
[1:06:27] just just think about this for a minute
[1:06:29] Abraham was brilliant and just in the
[1:06:31] fact that that he had a grasp on on the
[1:06:35] the ancient charity of knowledge that's
[1:06:37] where his whole family had come from
[1:06:38] from the chaudians
[1:06:40] and so he his his Heritage you know he
[1:06:45] has a a at least a grasp on Ancient
[1:06:47] charity charity and knowledge and he was
[1:06:50] he was Abram was no pushover
[1:06:53] certainly not somebody to be trifled
[1:06:55] with
[1:06:58] he's a direct descendant of sham Abraham
[1:07:00] because remember that that Abram was
[1:07:03] only ten Generations removed from a
[1:07:06] complete Global Extinction event
[1:07:09] see and and of course that event Abram
[1:07:13] knew was brought on by sin
[1:07:17] see
[1:07:18] and so so finding himself then you know
[1:07:22] in a in a fallen World which is where we
[1:07:24] find ourselves in a fallen World among
[1:07:28] Fallen men uh you know he's he's no
[1:07:31] naive fool
[1:07:33] and the Bible doesn't call for us to
[1:07:35] just be naive idiots at the devil's
[1:07:38] tactics and to say oh I'm just a humble
[1:07:41] Christian and I'll just let God fight
[1:07:43] all my battles let me tell you something
[1:07:45] God's gonna fight your battles but he's
[1:07:47] got he's putting a sword in your hand
[1:07:52] say I don't I don't have any power you
[1:07:56] understand that I can't save one of you
[1:08:01] I don't I can't give any of your
[1:08:03] children the Holy Ghost I don't have any
[1:08:06] power to do that but what I do have is a
[1:08:09] weapon
[1:08:10] and this weapon in the right hand has
[1:08:13] all kinds of Power
[1:08:16] and so I come with the sword of the
[1:08:18] spirit the word of God and we come with
[1:08:21] faith believing and we're we're on the
[1:08:24] attack I'm here tonight to attack the
[1:08:26] devil I'm here to attack him in your
[1:08:28] lives and I'm our children's life and
[1:08:30] our family's lives
[1:08:32] see
[1:08:34] and so what whatever is happening
[1:08:36] whether it's sin in our lives or we got
[1:08:39] our own self in it I mean even things
[1:08:41] that we might be culpable in I'm here to
[1:08:43] tell you the joy of the Lord is your
[1:08:46] strength
[1:08:48] the joy of the Lord is your strength if
[1:08:51] you want to be a warrior you're going to
[1:08:54] need strength and there's no greater
[1:08:56] strength than the supernatural joy of
[1:08:59] the Lord and there's no better way to
[1:09:01] get that than repented in your heart and
[1:09:04] crying out to God and being willing to
[1:09:07] face adversity and keep on going
[1:09:18] it's incredible because
[1:09:20] I mean Genesis 14.
[1:09:24] shows that Abraham
[1:09:26] he maintained a fighting battalion
[1:09:29] of more than 300 men
[1:09:33] that's no joke
[1:09:36] I mean they they when you when you're in
[1:09:38] the field in Battalion strength you
[1:09:40] remember those days brother Kenny but
[1:09:42] Joe you remember those days when you're
[1:09:44] in the field and brother Charles you're
[1:09:46] you're not that platoon strength
[1:09:49] this isn't company strength you got a
[1:09:51] whole battalion
[1:09:52] of of trained men and you're you're in
[1:09:56] the field of battle and Abram literally
[1:09:58] because he lived in a fallen world and
[1:10:01] he lived among Fallen men he literally
[1:10:04] has a he's maintaining a fighting
[1:10:07] Battalion of 300 Warrior servants
[1:10:13] moreover
[1:10:14] as you read it with me you read it with
[1:10:16] me
[1:10:17] I mean in these verses you know I mean
[1:10:20] he demonstrates
[1:10:22] that he's a a master tactician
[1:10:26] so I just thought he was a simple sheep
[1:10:28] herder no you'd be wrong
[1:10:31] oh I just thought he walked around and
[1:10:33] stared at his feet all day no you'd be
[1:10:36] wrong
[1:10:37] Abra Abram is is a is a master
[1:10:39] strategist
[1:10:41] who who knowing I mean he think about it
[1:10:44] he he knows how to track
[1:10:46] and pursue
[1:10:48] he knew how to strike at night for the
[1:10:51] element of surprise
[1:10:53] I mean he he he literally knew how to
[1:10:56] track him how to pursue them how to
[1:10:59] sneak up on him in the darkness for
[1:11:01] surprise and divided his Force for a
[1:11:04] perfectly executed pincer movement
[1:11:08] this man is brilliant
[1:11:10] see
[1:11:12] and so he's he the and the entire the
[1:11:16] entire the Bible uses the word
[1:11:18] slaughtered
[1:11:20] you know what that means means they that
[1:11:23] the enemy died to the last man
[1:11:27] he literally the enemy force was
[1:11:31] slaughtered and Abram returns back with
[1:11:34] his Battalion and there's no casualty
[1:11:36] report
[1:11:37] not one servant dies not one of the
[1:11:40] captives gets killed not one of their
[1:11:43] goods is lost he returns people husbands
[1:11:46] wives children's Goods garments kills
[1:11:49] all the enemies Slaughters until the
[1:11:51] last man and returns with his entire
[1:11:53] Battalion 318 men still intact
[1:11:56] oh my friends you realize what God is
[1:12:00] capable of doing in your life you're not
[1:12:04] just some Backwoods backwash you know
[1:12:06] you don't know nothing no you're the
[1:12:08] you're the cream of the crop you're the
[1:12:10] apple of his eye you're the whole
[1:12:12] purpose of calvary
[1:12:15] oh my Genesis shows him to be a not just
[1:12:19] a simple sheep herder Genesis shows him
[1:12:22] to be a brilliant Warchief and a
[1:12:25] successful herdsman if I might say
[1:12:28] see so there's there's nothing wrong
[1:12:31] with being trained for war
[1:12:34] even though you're a man of faith
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:40] say it again
[1:12:42] there's nothing wrong with being trained
[1:12:44] for war even if you're a man of faith
[1:12:47] so I'm just a man of Faith good you're
[1:12:49] going to need it now get get some
[1:12:51] Warrior training because God did God
[1:12:54] didn't bring all that on you just to
[1:12:56] decorate you and March you in a parade I
[1:12:59] mean listen friends this is the very
[1:13:01] this is what the ministry of Melchizedek
[1:13:05] showed up look who met him after the
[1:13:07] slaughter of the kings in the in the
[1:13:09] Kingsdale when he comes back and
[1:13:11] Melchizedek comes and serves in
[1:13:14] communion what was Melchizedek doing
[1:13:15] Melchizedek was showing the kind of life
[1:13:18] you have Abraham that's the kind of life
[1:13:20] I recognize that's the kind of life I
[1:13:22] validate that I'm going to serve you
[1:13:24] Kawaii and bread because I'm validating
[1:13:28] your life
[1:13:30] you stayed out of Sodom you capture
[1:13:32] yours you stayed before me you didn't go
[1:13:35] down to the Sodom you you had enough
[1:13:37] foresight to be a strong man of Faith
[1:13:39] you had enough foresight to be able to
[1:13:41] destroy the enemy and protect your home
[1:13:43] and save your family I wonder if we got
[1:13:46] enough men dads and mothers who have
[1:13:48] enough spiritual strength
[1:13:51] to to go after him and destroy an enemy
[1:13:54] in a complete Slaughter
[1:13:57] Hallelujah
[1:14:04] this is exactly why
[1:14:06] and I'm gonna quit early tonight because
[1:14:08] we want to have prayer and we want to
[1:14:11] have some testimonies I'm trying to
[1:14:12] gauge it I'm trying to set the right
[1:14:14] example for Wednesday nights
[1:14:16] when Joshua I want to make this point
[1:14:18] for our for our walk away
[1:14:21] when Joshua took the children of Israel
[1:14:23] Over
[1:14:26] to take the land
[1:14:28] uh you know the very
[1:14:31] first
[1:14:33] Divine being he met
[1:14:36] was a soldier
[1:14:41] God didn't call him up to the mountain
[1:14:43] like he did Moses
[1:14:45] he didn't meet him in a burning bush
[1:14:49] see
[1:14:50] God didn't God didn't meet you on the
[1:14:52] Ohio River
[1:14:54] he didn't come down like a star out of
[1:14:56] the heavens God didn't walk up like and
[1:14:58] you were in a cave and he stepped into a
[1:15:01] light
[1:15:02] you you that that that's not that's how
[1:15:04] God met our Moses
[1:15:07] but I'm here to tell you something
[1:15:08] friends we've crossed over under Joshua
[1:15:11] and it's time for war and it's time to
[1:15:14] fight and you have to ask yourself why
[1:15:16] am I a Believer I hope that you're
[1:15:19] asking yourself that question tonight
[1:15:20] why am I a Believer why do I come to
[1:15:23] this church why do I believe what I
[1:15:25] believe why do I believe God sent a
[1:15:27] prophet I can promise you it's not for
[1:15:29] entertainment it's not for recreation
[1:15:31] it's not for theology it's to make
[1:15:33] champion guns of the kingdom of God it's
[1:15:36] to take from the Devil
[1:15:39] this is did you realize that that's what
[1:15:41] that's what the meaning of being more
[1:15:43] than a conqueror is
[1:15:45] you're more than a conqueror because
[1:15:48] when you kill the enemy you take all of
[1:15:51] his spoils you get all of his ammo all
[1:15:54] of his weapons all of his tanks all of
[1:15:56] his guns all of his bullets all of his
[1:15:58] rations all of his water all of his fuel
[1:16:00] all of his aircraft airplanes now you're
[1:16:03] not you're not just a conqueror you're
[1:16:05] more than a conqueror
[1:16:08] you're not here just to to put the devil
[1:16:11] away you got to go forward you need to
[1:16:13] take some things back that he has taken
[1:16:15] from you and you're more than able
[1:16:18] because God has given us the joy of the
[1:16:21] Lord is our strength
[1:16:26] because we have arrived
[1:16:28] at the end time
[1:16:31] we've arrived we're we're here Nehemiah
[1:16:35] you Gallant man
[1:16:36] that's reservable
[1:16:39] sand is irrumable not by might not by
[1:16:42] power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:16:46] we have arrived at the Feast of
[1:16:48] Tabernacles we have arrived at body
[1:16:50] change time we have arrived at
[1:16:52] Millennium time the joy of the Lord is
[1:16:54] here it calls for our contrite heart it
[1:16:56] calls for a repentance it calls for
[1:16:58] dedication it calls for Consecration and
[1:17:01] sincerity before God
[1:17:04] I want that more than anything
[1:17:07] let's stand to our feet friends I I'm
[1:17:10] just so taken with it
[1:17:11] I'm so taken with what it when I realize
[1:17:16] that for years we have talked about the
[1:17:19] power of the spoken word
[1:17:23] and there are things that
[1:17:25] are yet to become greater I believe that
[1:17:28] according to
[1:17:29] Prophecy in the Bible
[1:17:32] according to things brother Brandon said
[1:17:34] to us very clearly on Tate
[1:17:38] God is going to prove
[1:17:40] I don't know all the details
[1:17:42] and he didn't know all the details and
[1:17:44] he didn't claim he did
[1:17:46] and even some of the statements he makes
[1:17:48] are somewhat ambiguous but I know
[1:17:50] collectively there's enough of them for
[1:17:53] me to know
[1:17:54] that friends God has something great and
[1:17:57] I believe it's just laying right in
[1:17:59] front of us
[1:18:01] say why do you think that because we've
[1:18:03] arrived at the not the end time we've
[1:18:06] arrived at the end of the end times say
[1:18:09] I've heard preachers been saying it's
[1:18:11] the end for decades that's right it has
[1:18:13] been that's not that wasn't wrong
[1:18:16] but now I'm here to tell you we've not
[1:18:19] we're not at the end time
[1:18:21] the end time started with the opening of
[1:18:23] Seven Seals that was the that was the
[1:18:25] beginning of the end
[1:18:27] and you have arrived now at the end of
[1:18:31] the end
[1:18:33] you haven't run in vain
[1:18:36] says Gene you haven't run in vain
[1:18:39] well Charles you haven't run in vain you
[1:18:40] haven't run in vain friends I haven't
[1:18:42] run in vain I know that God is Not only
[1:18:46] gonna keep his word I'm not looking for
[1:18:48] some way off out there if you're always
[1:18:49] chasing something wealth out there I'm
[1:18:51] telling you it's here it's right now
[1:18:53] you have you have arrived at the time of
[1:18:56] the unsealing
[1:18:58] and God is ready to do amazing things
[1:19:01] and a lot of times
[1:19:04] some of the most amazing things happen
[1:19:05] in silence
[1:19:07] one of the most amazing things
[1:19:09] do you know one of the most amazing
[1:19:11] things that happened in your life today
[1:19:15] the sun rose
[1:19:19] if it didn't
[1:19:21] rise the Earth would be in darkness and
[1:19:25] cold and would be a dead Planet devoid
[1:19:29] of all life in a very short time
[1:19:32] if the sun suddenly went away life could
[1:19:35] not be sustained on the Earth
[1:19:39] so I'm here to tell you that the
[1:19:41] greatest event that happened to you
[1:19:43] today and for you was the sun rose
[1:19:47] I'll ask you a question
[1:19:50] anybody hear it
[1:19:54] did anybody feel ripples go through the
[1:19:56] air no it just Rose
[1:20:00] and all of a sudden there it was
[1:20:02] and it went all day long warming the
[1:20:05] Earth using its its energy on a big ball
[1:20:11] of
[1:20:12] flame and heating from that many miles
[1:20:15] away
[1:20:16] and gave you warmth and gave you light
[1:20:19] and then the light is life
[1:20:22] nobody heard it
[1:20:24] you didn't even feel it unless you
[1:20:26] walked out and felt Warm Rays
[1:20:29] so we're not
[1:20:31] we're not here to chase some Sensational
[1:20:35] I don't know
[1:20:37] way out there somewhere over a rainbow
[1:20:40] no I'm here to tell you you're at the
[1:20:43] time of the unsealing it's now you're
[1:20:45] here it's arrived and I don't know I
[1:20:48] mean I think that God is already doing
[1:20:51] more in us than we're even aware of
[1:20:54] I think there's more Supernatural
[1:20:56] operating in you that you're a believer
[1:20:58] in this impossible age I I you know
[1:21:01] let's give the Lord some credit he's
[1:21:03] keeping me
[1:21:04] and from glory to glory he's changing me
[1:21:07] I'm so glad I can say that I'm so glad
[1:21:11] I've been raised in this I've been in it
[1:21:12] my whole life but I can still say today
[1:21:14] even after all these years he's still
[1:21:16] changing me he's still growing me he's
[1:21:19] still moving me oh one of these mornings

[1:24:32] special unspoken prayer request from
[1:24:34] sister Sharon short so we'll take that
[1:24:36] to the Lord I didn't have any other
[1:24:38] prayer requests that come in but I know
[1:24:40] a lot of times sometimes when you arrive
[1:24:42] to church you don't think you have a
[1:24:43] need until the preacher gets done and
[1:24:45] then you feel how many Phil you have a
[1:24:48] need tonight something in your heart you
[1:24:50] need to pray and ask the Lord's help you
[1:24:51] know I was talking brother Chris and I
[1:24:53] we were coming to church and
[1:24:55] and we were just brother Chris made a
[1:24:57] comment about you know just the
[1:24:59] conversations of late that he's had with
[1:25:01] the Lord and I said well you know Chris
[1:25:03] that's that's exactly that that's
[1:25:06] exactly like the Bible that's what God
[1:25:08] actually wants that that I I did a study
[1:25:12] some time ago not too awful long ago
[1:25:14] right in the latter part of last year
[1:25:15] and I I got enamored with with these
[1:25:18] prophets and pre and Priests and kings
[1:25:23] and apostles and I mean even in the book
[1:25:25] of Acts and different places where these
[1:25:29] long elaborate detailed I'm talking
[1:25:32] about almost like a like uh this prayer
[1:25:35] where you know this man implored God and
[1:25:38] and built his case and gave him
[1:25:40] reasoning and Lord we've got this
[1:25:42] problem and here's what your word says
[1:25:44] and we need this kind of help and if you
[1:25:45] don't do it this is going to happen over
[1:25:46] here and we're trusting you right here
[1:25:48] and Lord you've got to come on the scene
[1:25:49] and and and remember your word and
[1:25:52] remember your people and for thy great
[1:25:53] love and all and I mean just these
[1:25:55] elaborate prayers I was like wow
[1:25:58] I mean it it occurred to me I thought
[1:26:01] let me go back and look at some of
[1:26:02] brother Brandon's prayer same thing but
[1:26:04] sometimes brother Brown be praying for
[1:26:06] somebody and just get down you remember
[1:26:08] the prayer when the man got his car
[1:26:10] stoled and brother Branham didn't just
[1:26:12] lay hands on him and say Lord go find
[1:26:14] his car
[1:26:15] he got down
[1:26:17] said now Lord this poor brother
[1:26:20] he drives all these many miles and he
[1:26:23] comes he got he's poor Lord but you know
[1:26:26] he's a Christian you know he loves you
[1:26:28] now Lord some evil person has stole his
[1:26:31] car you think God didn't know all that
[1:26:34] you think these prophets and kings and
[1:26:37] brother Branham and Paul and different
[1:26:38] ones in the Bible do you think they're
[1:26:40] telling God something he doesn't know
[1:26:42] the Bible says who's been his counselor
[1:26:45] but yet God I said it's not about that
[1:26:48] it's that God loves the interaction
[1:26:51] that's why brother Branham said ask big
[1:26:53] things don't be afraid to ask pray
[1:26:55] believe
[1:26:56] he said ask big things God wants you to
[1:26:58] you got a prophet his permission God
[1:27:00] wants you to the Bible says ask big that
[1:27:03] your joy may be full ask abundance
[1:27:06] gently I mean look I I can I can I can
[1:27:09] give you a double testimony you know I
[1:27:11] had small children had small
[1:27:12] grandchildren and even to this day
[1:27:14] whether they're grown and strapping
[1:27:16] bigger than me there was no there was
[1:27:18] you know there was times when when I
[1:27:21] would come to you know and I'd want to
[1:27:22] do something for my sons and I'd get a
[1:27:24] big joy out of seeing their smile or a
[1:27:26] grand a grandchild I'd go buy them
[1:27:27] something you know and just to hear them
[1:27:29] squeal and and and I got a great joy out
[1:27:32] of that but that's nothing every parent
[1:27:35] especially grandparents are special know
[1:27:37] this to be true there's nothing like
[1:27:40] having that child or that grandchild
[1:27:43] come and say well my son say Dad
[1:27:46] Dad I've got a problem Bob you help me I
[1:27:49] got to have that can you you know and or

[1:27:54] a situation and if you could help me and

[1:30:26] last week we prayed for a 14 year old
[1:30:28] young man who had been in an accident
[1:30:31] and the doctors as of I guess Friday and
[1:30:34] Saturday the doctors told the family
[1:30:36] that there was no hope and that they
[1:30:39] needed to start thinking about letting
[1:30:41] him go and and that kind of thing well
[1:30:44] they were in the
[1:30:46] um the family was gathered around the
[1:30:48] hospital room and they were just trying
[1:30:49] to process that information and the
[1:30:52] young man woke up he just just woke up
[1:30:55] and he reached for his mom and was
[1:30:59] trying to get to her and so of course
[1:31:02] the medical staff did put him back into
[1:31:04] a coma because he's got so many broken
[1:31:06] bones I guess or her injuries of
[1:31:09] whatever kind that they thought it was
[1:31:11] best to keep him medically in a coma so
[1:31:14] that he wouldn't thrash around and hurt
[1:31:16] himself more but they realized that he
[1:31:19] you know he's there yes and so the
[1:31:22] family asked that we continue to pray
[1:31:24] and I just wanted to give that test hey
