[0:18] more people here and looking forward as
[0:21] times go on for more fellowship with
[0:24] everyone we just definitely miss
[0:26] everybody very much so let's stand up
[0:29] and we'll pray gracious Heavenly Father
[0:33] we just come to you now Lord and we ask
[0:36] that your presence would be with us I
[0:38] pray Lord that you would give us all a
[0:40] spirit of wisdom and revelation and the
[0:43] knowledge of you Lord I pray that you
[0:45] would let your word come forth in
[0:48] clarity this morning and and that you
[0:51] would speak to hearts Lord and deal with
[0:53] hearts father we want to commit
[0:55] ourselves to you for your glory we ask
[0:57] it in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[0:59] god bless you you can be seated we're
[1:02] gonna continue on identifying the seed
[1:05] of the serpent part 2 and the scripture
[1:11] we're going to look at here is in
[1:16] Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26
[1:28] through 28
[1:36] actually let's just uh let's go to 27
[1:40] and 28 so God created man in his own
[1:42] image and the image of God created he
[1:44] him male and female created he them and
[1:47] God blessed them and God said unto them
[1:48] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:51] the earth and subdue it and have
[1:52] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:54] over the fowl of the air and over every
[1:56] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[1:59] so that's God's command starts out is to
[2:03] multiply and fill up the earth then we
[2:06] go to Genesis 2 verse 9 and out of the
[2:10] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[2:12] tree that is pleasant to the sight and
[2:14] good for food and the Tree of Life also
[2:18] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[2:20] of the knowledge of good and evil
[2:24] okay so first God's commands multiply
[2:27] and replenish the earth and we always
[2:29] know when God gives a command he also
[2:31] gives a test so when they're cut when
[2:35] there comes a command there comes a test
[2:38] so the next thing we have is first thing
[2:41] we have is reproduction and the second
[2:43] thing we have is eating certain kinds of
[2:47] fruit two different kinds of fruit and
[2:49] again as we talked about last week a
[2:51] tree of life tree of the knowledge of
[2:54] good and evil immediately this should
[2:57] cause us to stop and say wait what's
[3:00] going on here why are we talking about
[3:04] trees that are good growing out of the
[3:06] ground and that are good for food and
[3:08] then we're talking about trees that are
[3:10] in the midst of the garden why why the
[3:14] difference in the language one growing
[3:16] out of the ground one in run one in the
[3:19] midst of the garden says nothing about
[3:21] growing out of the ground okay so then
[3:27] we go to genesis 3:15
[3:34] and I will put enmity between thee and
[3:37] the woman and between thy seed and her
[3:39] seed it shall bruise thy head and thou
[3:42] shalt bruise his heel and then 16-under
[3:47] the woman he said I will greatly
[3:48] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[3:50] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[3:53] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[3:55] husband he shall rule over thee so three
[3:59] things we talked about this last week
[4:02] three things you can go to the next
[4:03] screen that's the wrong PowerPoint so
[4:12] three things we have Phillip the earth
[4:17] reproduction we had up all of a sudden
[4:21] there's there's the eating of the tree
[4:23] of the knowledge of good and evil then
[4:25] we're right back to two seeds two
[4:30] offspring being having enmity put
[4:33] against each other and then the next
[4:34] verse it says I will increase your pain
[4:37] and your conception so three things fit
[4:45] together one thing does not fit together
[4:47] what we're looking at literally if we
[4:50] want to say literal eating of the tree
[4:53] of knowledge if it's a literal fruit
[4:55] it's completely incongruous with the
[4:57] rest of the book of Genesis eating the
[5:00] wrong fruit but that in fact it was a
[5:04] sexual act of course of course the whole
[5:09] picture is talking about a sexual act
[5:11] then we have right in there a euphemism
[5:15] eating of the tree of the knowledge of
[5:17] good and evil so when we look at when we
[5:20] look at eating of the tree of the
[5:22] knowledge of good and evil we reviewed
[5:24] the scriptures last week such as the
[5:26] what proverbs 30 verse 20 I believe it
[5:29] was such as the way of an adulterous
[5:32] woman she eateth and why pethor mouth
[5:34] and say I have done no evil so eating of
[5:39] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[5:40] evil all these things fit perfectly
[5:43] together
[5:44] read through the book of solid Song of
[5:45] Solomon the picture is between
[5:48] Solomon and his bride and it's
[5:50] constantly talking about gardens fruit
[5:53] and eating so clear from Scripture that
[5:58] we're talking about a euphemism to eat
[6:00] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[6:02] evil we go to the next screen and once
[6:06] again scripture is very clear 2nd
[6:08] Corinthians 11 2 and 3 for I'm jealous
[6:10] over you with godly jealousy Paul
[6:13] writing for I have espoused you so there
[6:15] he's talking about engagement to be
[6:18] married I have espoused you to one
[6:20] husband and I may present you as a
[6:21] chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest
[6:25] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[6:27] through subtility so your minds should
[6:30] be corrupted from the simplicity that is
[6:33] in Christ next screen for if he that
[6:36] cometh preaches another jesus when we
[6:38] have not preached or if you receive
[6:39] another spirit which ye have not
[6:42] received or another gospel which you
[6:43] have not accepted you might well bear
[6:47] with him so Paul using a type he's
[6:52] saying here's the type Adam is engaged
[6:55] to Eve she's engaged as a virgin
[6:58] Christ is in great gauge to the church
[7:01] she's engaged in ver as a virgin and
[7:04] he's what does what is his fear his fear
[7:08] is that there would be a defilement of
[7:10] that virginity that's what he's afraid
[7:13] of
[7:13] and he likens that unto receiving a
[7:16] false Jesus a false gospel and a false
[7:20] spirit so what then did Paul assume the
[7:25] original sin was adultery that's what
[7:31] that's what he assumed that the original
[7:33] sin was when he was writing this verse
[7:35] you know go back one screen brother Joe
[7:40] so people will take that the serpent
[7:43] beguiled Eve and to us that's a
[7:47] connotation of adultery but if you look
[7:51] at the original word it simply speaks of
[7:53] being completely and utterly deceived so
[7:57] people will take that and say see you
[7:58] you message believers you don't know
[8:00] what you're talking
[8:00] this word has nothing to do with the
[8:02] sexual act well you're missing the point
[8:05] entirely the whole picture has to do
[8:08] with that it's not just one word that
[8:11] we're referencing to the whole picture
[8:13] that Paul is presenting and isn't this
[8:15] the picture that God brings to us all
[8:18] through the Bible God's relationship
[8:21] with his people is likened to a husband
[8:23] and a wife and when the wife becomes
[8:30] unfaithful in her faith turns to idols
[8:33] turns to other nations turns to false
[8:36] teaching God says you've committed
[8:38] adultery so that's the whole picture
[8:40] through the entire Bible but at the
[8:42] beginning of course it was just eating a
[8:44] fruit the the very first original sin is
[8:51] the type that's moving forward for God
[8:57] and His people that's the very first
[8:59] type now how are we gonna break that
[9:02] type where we're gonna say it was a
[9:04] literal peace an apple or an apricot
[9:08] pepperoni pizza it doesn't matter
[9:10] whatever it was it none of it makes any
[9:14] sense if you look at the the allegories
[9:16] in the Bible if you look at the picture
[9:18] in the Old Testament or in the book of
[9:20] Genesis none of it makes sense let's go
[9:23] to the next screen and next one one more
[9:28] church is engaged as a virgin to Christ
[9:31] eva's engaged as a virgin to Adam keep
[9:34] going
[9:34] paul fears the churches adultery by
[9:37] accepting a false word he compares that
[9:40] to the original sin if paul fears the
[9:43] church committing adultery and compares
[9:44] it to eve sin then we can conclude by
[9:46] the scripture that eve committed
[9:49] adultery with the serpent next one
[9:52] genesis 3:15 we read that but we'll read
[9:56] it again let's go back I will put enmity
[9:58] between thy seed if you look at the word
[10:01] seed there means offspring so thy
[10:05] offspring and her offspring very very
[10:09] clear there's two lines of offspring
[10:12] there's two
[10:14] necklines one is the seed of the serpent
[10:16] one is referred to as the seed of the
[10:19] woman we understand that this is
[10:21] ultimately a prophecy of Christ and His
[10:27] redemptive work we also understand that
[10:30] it had immediate application right away
[10:33] in Genesis between Cain and Abel
[10:36] so next screen here we see it and Cain
[10:41] talked with Abel his brother and it came
[10:43] to pass when they were in the field that
[10:44] Cain rose up against Abel his brother
[10:46] and slew him and then we skip ahead and
[10:49] Cain
[10:50] backs back and Cain knew his wife and
[10:53] she conceived and bare Enoch and he
[10:54] builded a city and called the name of
[10:56] the city after the name of his son Enoch
[10:58] and unto Enoch was born irad and irad
[11:01] begat booz yell and who's y'all beget
[11:03] with Susana the Jews al begat lamech and
[11:06] Lamech took unto Him two wives the name
[11:09] of the one was Adah and the name of the
[11:11] other Zillah so we see right there the
[11:15] serpent seed line they started
[11:19] civilization they started production
[11:24] they started polygamy the first ones to
[11:28] start polygamy it was not God it was the
[11:31] serpent seed line started polygamy next
[11:34] next one and ADA Bear Jabil he was the
[11:38] father of such as dwell in tents and
[11:39] such as have cattle and his brother's
[11:41] name was Jubal he was the father of all
[11:43] such as handle the harp in Oregon and
[11:45] Zillah she also bear tubal-cain and
[11:47] instructor of every artificer in brass
[11:48] and iron and the sister of tubal-cain
[11:50] was Naamah
[11:52] and Lamech said unto his wife Adah and
[11:54] Zillah hear my voice he wives of it
[11:56] laymen Lamech hearken unto my speech for
[11:58] I have slain a man to my wounding and a
[12:00] young man to my hurt if Cain shall be
[12:02] Avenged Sevenfold truly Lamech seventy
[12:05] and Sevenfold so there we see the birth
[12:10] of a tyrant
[12:11] so tyranny that's from the serpent seed
[12:14] line that's not from God's seed polygamy
[12:18] from the serpent seed line science
[12:21] civilization all these things of course
[12:23] they have their they have their proper
[12:25] application when done with
[12:28] and under the submission and authority
[12:30] of God's Word but outside of that
[12:32] submission we understand exactly what
[12:35] happened and what these things led to
[12:37] complete and total rebellion against God
[12:41] next screen John 8 verse 40 but now you
[12:50] seek to kill me a man hath told you the
[12:52] true truth which I have heard of God
[12:54] this did not Abraham you do the deeds of
[12:58] your father then said they to him we be
[13:01] not born of fornication we have one
[13:03] father even God so here we see Jesus go
[13:09] back there brother
[13:10] we see Jesus speaking to the Pharisees
[13:12] and he sees by their nature in how they
[13:18] respond to the word being manifested
[13:21] through him he says I see by your nature
[13:23] you're not doing the works of Abraham by
[13:27] your nature I can see who your father is
[13:30] and that's the devil and they they they
[13:35] understand what he's speaking about they
[13:37] know they know what he's saying and they
[13:41] right away say we're not born of
[13:43] fornication why in the world would they
[13:46] say that after he called said they were
[13:48] of their father the devil because it's a
[13:51] well well established fact it doesn't
[13:53] take much research at all to find out
[13:55] that Jewish people of this time believed
[13:58] that Cain was born of the devil and you
[14:04] know they have some misunderstandings
[14:06] within their teaching about that but
[14:09] ultimately they do not believe that Adam
[14:12] was the father of Cain and they do
[14:15] unfortunately at that time they did what
[14:17] many other what many current racist
[14:21] cults will do which is separate the seed
[14:24] lines only by race so the Jews viewed
[14:28] themselves as the pure race and everyone
[14:30] else was serpent seed just like white
[14:33] people would view themselves as the in
[14:36] in past and even today in sane people do
[14:39] now
[14:41] they view themselves of the pure race
[14:43] and anyone with any color is serpent
[14:45] seed there's people that believe that
[14:48] I've posted videos about certain serpent
[14:51] seed and had on YouTube and had racist
[14:53] people and congratulate me and
[14:55] immediately send them as a spam and it's
[14:58] just such nonsense that they want to
[15:00] believe this has nothing to do with that
[15:02] after after the sons of God saw the
[15:05] daughters of mine way ahead but just to
[15:07] clarify when the sons of God saw the
[15:09] daughters of men in those two genetic
[15:11] lines combined there ceased to be a pure
[15:14] serpent race that was that doesn't exist
[15:16] anymore everything comes through Noah
[15:19] and his wife and the the sons and
[15:24] daughters ham Shem and Japheth and their
[15:26] wives there's not somehow some pure
[15:29] serpent race somewhere it's all a mixed
[15:32] genetics all of our blood is perverted
[15:35] we're born wrong and that's why we have
[15:38] to be born again and so clearly the SERP
[15:42] they the Pharisees had an understanding
[15:46] what the original sin was they put it on
[15:49] fornication so next screen yeah John
[15:57] 8:44 you are of your father the devil
[15:59] and the lusts of your father he will do
[16:01] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[16:03] abode not in the truth because there's
[16:05] no truth in him when he speaks a lie he
[16:07] speaks of his own for he is the liar and
[16:10] the father of it so what what does Jesus
[16:15] it mean right here what is he referring
[16:17] to who was the one that told the first
[16:22] lie who was the one that committed the
[16:25] first murder
[16:26] it was Cain so what is he saying he's
[16:31] saying the father of Cain is the devil I
[16:36] mean I know I know this is simple to you
[16:40] but these things are not clear to
[16:42] everyone Jesus is saying that Satan
[16:46] produced Cain not God we understand when
[16:53] God's principles of life no matter no
[16:56] matter how evil the child would be the
[16:59] life has to come from God but it's God's
[17:01] principle that he's set forth in the
[17:04] human race to reproduce but but the
[17:09] spirit behind the birth of Cain was the
[17:14] devil and and again it was a literal not
[17:18] snake but an upright person that could
[17:22] speak that could reason that walked on
[17:25] two feet and Satan came and incarnated
[17:28] that serpent and through that physical
[17:32] instrumentality it wasn't a snake but an
[17:35] upright creature through that physical
[17:37] instrumentality together with Eve
[17:40] brought forth Cain next one first John
[17:47] 3:12 not as Cain who was of that wicked
[17:50] one and slew his brother and wherefore
[17:53] slew he him because his own works were
[17:55] evil and his brothers righteous alright
[17:58] so this verse is similar to that of the
[18:06] genealogies of Christ for instance in
[18:09] the book of Luke
[18:09] if you look closely in the Book of Luke
[18:12] were where they're going through the
[18:14] genealogies it will say the son of the
[18:16] son of the son of the son is in italics
[18:20] in the King James Version that means
[18:23] that that is added by the translators to
[18:25] make it to bring more sense to the verse
[18:30] so really what it says is of Abraham of
[18:34] Isaac so we hear in the same sense we
[18:41] see not as Cain who was of that wicked
[18:45] one so what can we assume right there
[18:47] the son of the wicked one and then next
[18:51] screen
[18:57] Matthew 13 37 through 39 he answered and
[19:02] said unto them he that soweth the good
[19:03] seed is the son of man the field is the
[19:06] world the good seed are the children of
[19:08] the kingdom but the tares are the
[19:10] children of the wicked one the enemy
[19:12] that sowed them is the devil the harvest
[19:14] is the end of the world and the Reapers
[19:17] are the Angels once again Jesus speaking
[19:20] about children of the devil next screen
[19:26] so let's look at this there in Jewish
[19:31] tradition this is this is a you can just
[19:36] see find this right on Wikipedia so in
[19:39] Jewish tradition Philo I mean these
[19:41] these people that I'm naming off our
[19:43] rabbis or philosophers that were Jewish
[19:46] people Philo perk to Rabbi Eliezer and
[19:49] the targum pseudo Jonathan asserted that
[19:52] Adam was not the father of cain rather
[19:54] Eve was subject to adultery haven't been
[19:57] seduced by either Samael the serpent in
[20:01] the Garden of Eden or the devil himself
[20:03] Christian eggs a Jesus of the evil one
[20:06] in first John 3 10 through 12 have also
[20:08] led some commentators like Tertullian to
[20:11] agree that cain was the son of the devil
[20:14] next screen so this is from Tertullian
[20:18] in the 3rd century from one of his
[20:21] writings he said he says having been
[20:23] made pregnant by the devil she brought
[20:26] forth a son so Jewish people had an
[20:31] understanding of serpent seed but also
[20:34] the early church had an understanding of
[20:36] serpent seed and as it as the church
[20:39] descended into darkness and false
[20:41] doctrine this understanding of the
[20:44] original sin was completely lost next
[20:48] screen Genesis 4:1 and Adam knew his
[20:52] wife and she conceived and bare Cain and
[20:54] said I have gotten a man from the Lord
[20:58] now this is one where people will always
[21:00] bring this verse and say Adam got
[21:03] together with Eve they produced Cain end
[21:06] of story
[21:08] serpent seed is a false doctrine so
[21:11] let's let's talk about that for a minute
[21:13] let's go to the next screen
[21:14] so English in English we have past tense
[21:19] present tense future tense in Hebrew
[21:24] they don't have those three tenses of
[21:27] verbs they have perfect and imperfect
[21:31] perfect means a completed action and
[21:34] imperfect means an action that's ongoing
[21:37] or an action that's in process so they
[21:42] also don't in in the original Hebrew
[21:44] text there's no punctuation
[21:46] none at all it's just a word although
[21:50] all the words running together and if
[21:53] you don't understand the tenses of
[21:55] Hebrew you don't know how to
[21:57] differentiate the thoughts so that's
[22:00] that's how we know that a new thought
[22:03] starts is when you have different tenses
[22:07] of the verbs so they're gonna go they're
[22:09] gonna go through and you're gonna look
[22:11] at that and they're gonna separate and
[22:13] put in punctuation based upon that in
[22:16] the King James you see it and Adam knew
[22:18] his wife and they put in a colon and she
[22:22] conceived and bare Cain if you look at
[22:24] some of the French translations they
[22:27] have a period there and Adam knew his
[22:30] wife period and then they start a new
[22:33] sentence and there's a reason for that
[22:35] let's continue on next screen an Adam
[22:39] this is this is how how it goes there in
[22:42] in that verse an Adam had known his wife
[22:46] so the first one and Adam knew his wife
[22:49] is a perfect tense
[22:51] it's a completed action but the next
[22:55] tenses are different and she was
[22:57] conceiving so it's a continuation it's
[22:59] changing the tense to an imperfect tense
[23:02] so Adam had known his wife and she was
[23:04] conceiving and she was bearing Cain next
[23:10] so let's look at this because the very
[23:13] similar language is used in two other
[23:16] verses here and it's important to
[23:18] understand it because it will bring us
[23:21] back to
[23:22] verse 1 and Cain knew his wife and she
[23:24] conceived and bare Enoch and he builded
[23:27] a city and called the name of the city
[23:29] after the name of his son you know very
[23:32] similar terminology the next one Cain
[23:37] was knowing his wife it doesn't say Cain
[23:39] had known so it's a different tense than
[23:42] what it is in Genesis 4 verse 1 Adam had
[23:46] known his wife here it is same tense and
[23:49] Cain was knowing his wife and she was
[23:51] conceiving and was bearing Enoch next
[23:55] one and Adam knew his wife again and she
[24:00] bare a son and called his name Seth for
[24:03] God said she hath appointed me another
[24:04] seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew
[24:08] again so here was it wasn't Adam had
[24:12] known it was Adam was knowing his wife
[24:16] again and she was bearing a son next
[24:25] going
[24:26] so Adam had known his wife she was
[24:29] conceiving and was bearing you see there
[24:31] the tenses are different so the thought
[24:33] is different the action the verb the
[24:38] action of II Adam knowing his wife is
[24:43] separated from the conception and
[24:46] bearing of Cain but when you talk about
[24:50] Cain and his wife both of the actions
[24:54] are connected when you talk about the
[24:56] birth of Seth both of the actions are
[24:58] connected but in Genesis 4 verse 1 they
[25:00] are disconnected his knowing his wife is
[25:04] talked about past tense finished a past
[25:07] tense perfect tense completed action the
[25:10] conception and burying of Cain is
[25:11] imperfect what is it doing it's clearly
[25:15] separating the two acts so that that
[25:18] anyone that could research this and
[25:20] study this and understand the action of
[25:23] Adam coming together with his wife is
[25:25] different than the conception and birth
[25:27] of Cain it is not connected together
[25:31] okay they're twins but
[25:34] the action is not connected together and
[25:36] the Bible never connects the birth of
[25:40] Cain so we take this verse we separate
[25:43] that out and we go run through the rest
[25:46] of Scripture no where is Cain included
[25:50] in the genealogy of Adam now that isn't
[25:54] because God is ashamed to put bad people
[25:56] in the genealogy because he goes to
[25:59] great detail about the sons of Abraham
[26:02] both both sides and the grandsons of
[26:05] Abraham Edom he goes into details about
[26:09] great detail about Edom God's on a shame
[26:14] a shame to do that to go into detail
[26:17] about a bad and wicked genealogy but he
[26:20] never connects Cain to Adam even in the
[26:24] verse that people that hate this message
[26:26] want to prove it wrong that they say it
[26:29] proves that Adam is the father of Cain
[26:32] it doesn't do any such thing it does the
[26:36] opposite it shows that there's a
[26:38] disconnection there and then we run
[26:40] through the rest of the scriptures and
[26:41] Cain is never connected to Adam
[26:43] so let's we'll close with that let's
[26:46] stand gracious Heavenly Father your word
[26:55] is true Lord we just stand in awe at the
[26:59] beauty of this vindicated mesh message
[27:02] that we've received Lord the word did
[27:05] not come out from us but it came to us
[27:10] Lord and we are recipients of that we
[27:13] ask that you just continue to quicken
[27:15] our hearts to the reality of this truth
[27:18] continue to open your word to us Lord
[27:20] make it live make it real within us
[27:23] father we ask your blessing upon the
[27:26] worship and upon the preaching of the
[27:27] word today
[27:28] may you be sovereign and move in
[27:31] people's lives Lord for your glory we
[27:33] ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless you
