[19:30] Josiah.
[19:56] I was born
[20:00] to be royal.
[20:04] I was made
[20:08] to be free.
[20:12] But I was torn
[20:16] from the garden
[20:20] when that devil
[20:24] lied to me.
[20:31] [Music]
[20:36] I was formed
[20:40] from the soil.
[20:45] I've got dirt
[20:48] inside of me,
[20:51] [Music]
[20:53] but I was born
[20:55] [Music]
[20:57] to be royal.
[21:01] I was made
[21:05] for gloryy.
[21:10] Take me back

[21:29] time. I am longing.

[21:43] [Music]
[21:55] Take me down
[21:59] to the river
[22:03] down to Eden's
[22:08] crystal streams
[22:11] where every sin
[22:15] can be forgiven.
[22:20] Holy Ghost,
[22:23] come set me free.
[22:28] Take me back
[22:32] to the garden.
[22:36] Take me back
[22:40] and walk with me.
[22:45] For your presence
[22:48] I
[22:49] am longing.
[22:53] Take me back

[23:37] And I was born
[23:42] to be royal.
[23:46] And I was made
[23:48] [Music]
[23:50] to be free.
[23:54] [Music]
[23:57] [Applause]
[24:06] The Bethl musicians have practiced
[24:08] something special for you guys.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Ruth is supposed to be up here, too.
[24:18] Come on, Ruth. Let's go, Ruth.
[24:23] [Applause]
[24:24] I know everyone at camp probably thinks
[24:26] we have an allmale music team at Bethl
[24:29] Church, but we do not. We have ladies,
[24:32] too.
[24:33] I have to go in the back.
[24:36] Julia's here. I'm sorry. I didn't see.
[24:40] Okay. In my defense, Julia told me she
[24:43] wasn't going to be playing this morning,
[24:45] so I didn't know you were there. Oh,
[24:47] man. I'm so embarrassed.
[24:53] It's the hat.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; No longer it's high.
[25:05] My walking is done. My background is one
[25:09] and I'm living the right life now.
[25:14] Oh, glory to God. I'm washing his blood.
[25:19] His love is on my ground.
[25:25] I'm happy.
[25:27] There's peace in my soul. And I'm living
[25:31] the right life now. Sister Julia
[25:34] Buckman.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Julia.
[25:40] Give it up for Julia.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Give it up for Andrew.
[25:48] [Applause]
[25:50] [Music]
[25:50] [Applause]
[25:53] The pleasures of sin when blackening
[25:57] within no longer can charm my soul.
[26:03] For pleasures I find peace and mine.
[26:08] Since Jesus has made me whole.
[26:13] Oh, glory to God. I'm washing in blood
[26:19] of light and on my ground.
[26:23] Well, I'm happy and
[26:26] peace in my soul and I'm living the
[26:30] right life now. Brother Steve Curtis,
[26:35] [Applause]
[26:39] let's give it up for Steve.
[26:42] Brother Micah Curtis
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Micah on the man.
[26:49] [Music]
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Oh sinners stray. Seek Jesus today. The
[26:59] right life is for the best.
[27:04] Come out of the night. Come into the
[27:08] light where souls are supremely blessed.
[27:14] Oh, glory to God. I'm washed in his
[27:19] blood. His love is on my brow.
[27:25] I'm happy and there's peace in my soul
[27:29] and I'm living the right life now.
[27:33] Brother Aaron Simmons.
[27:36] Woo! Aaron,
[27:37] [Music]
[27:44] &gt;&gt; brother Chris Watkins.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Woo! Chris!
[27:50] [Music]
[28:04] [Applause]
[28:08] You must fight. Be brave against all
[28:12] evil
[28:16] or even behind.
[28:19] You must win for God and right. You must
[28:24] keep on the fiery line
[28:28] [Music]
[28:29] in the battle for the Lord and right.
[28:34] Keep on the fiery line.
[28:39] If you win, my brother, surely you must
[28:43] fight. Keep on the light.
[28:48] [Music]
[28:49] There are many dangers that we all must.
[28:54] If we die of fighting, there is no
[28:57] disrup.
[28:58] [Music]
[29:04] So we call the fiery life.
[29:09] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all
[29:14] evil.
[29:16] [Music]
[29:20] If you must wait for God in the right,
[29:25] you must keep on the firing line.
[29:30] Oh, when we get to heaven, brother,
[29:33] we'll be glad.
[29:36] Keep on the fiery line.
[29:40] Oh, we will praise the Savior for the
[29:44] call we had, holding on the fiery line.
[29:49] Heat.
[29:51] Heat.
[29:54] [Music]
[30:00] [Music]
[30:11] Oh, you must fight to be brave against
[30:15] all evil
[30:17] [Music]
[30:19] glory.
[30:22] If you must wait for God in your eyes,
[30:27] you must keep on your fire.
[30:32] You must fight
[30:35] against all evil
[30:38] [Music]
[30:41] behind.
[30:43] If you must wait for God,
[30:47] you must become the fiery light.
[30:56] [Applause]
[31:01] [Music]
[31:20] Hello everybody.
[31:23] So, you can all be seated. Um, except
[31:25] for anyone who's in the skit. They need
[31:27] to go back and get in their spot right
[31:29] away. That includes you, Caleb Buckman.
[31:33] I'm so nervous. I'm so glad that the
[31:36] lights are so bright because I can't see
[31:38] any of you. It's just like a black void.
[31:40] So, I feel like I'm just talking to
[31:42] myself, which is great. I do that a lot
[31:44] already.
[31:46] Who all was here last year?
[31:50] [Applause]
[31:51] &gt;&gt; I had a whole joke planned. I thought
[31:53] you guys were going to raise hands and I
[31:55] was going to say, "See, I can't see
[31:56] you." But you you shouted and ruined my
[31:58] joke.
[32:00] Um, okay. So, I just want to make a
[32:02] couple little quick announcements. I
[32:04] wrote a monologue this year. I've never
[32:06] done that and I'm super nervous. My
[32:07] paper's shaking. I told Brother Wes our
[32:09] deal. I'm a backstage nerd. I'm not a
[32:11] front stage nerd, but I'm gonna make it
[32:13] through this as best I can. Um, first of
[32:15] all, I usually put, as you know, um,
[32:18] little sermon clips in the beginning and
[32:21] end of our skits because usually it's a
[32:24] sermon that uh, inspires the skit. And
[32:27] this year I did that, of course. But the
[32:29] sermons are from um, Brother Brandham
[32:32] sermons. and I don't have video
[32:34] recording of that. So, um it's parts of
[32:37] it are just going to be blank screens
[32:39] and landscapes and just do your best to
[32:42] stay focused. We live in such a world of
[32:44] distraction. I know it's hard probably
[32:45] to keep your attention for very long,
[32:48] but um just know that this is very close
[32:50] to my heart. I know that it's at this
[32:53] point probably a big fat steak with no
[32:55] sides because I had to cut out all
[32:58] anything that made the videos longer. I
[33:00] had to trim down for the sake of time.
[33:03] Um, and it the videos are still a little
[33:05] long. That's why we cut all of most of
[33:07] our specials out is to make time for
[33:09] those. Um, so just do your best. Please
[33:12] humor me. I know it's not as visually
[33:15] stimulating as it is in other years, but
[33:17] these sermons are so important. And
[33:20] because I had to trim them down for
[33:22] time, I urge you to go listen to them
[33:25] for yourself. do not just watch this and
[33:29] be happy with that because every single
[33:31] line that wasn't extremely relevant to
[33:34] our skit that I had to remove, I it
[33:36] killed me because it was so good.
[33:38] Everything that he says in these sermons
[33:40] is so critical and so good. So, please
[33:43] go listen to yourself. I urge you. Um, I
[33:47] think that was pretty much all I needed
[33:49] to say for that. Um, Satan has really
[33:52] attacked this skit because he did not
[33:55] want this to happen. And he has plagued
[33:57] my mind with thoughts of negativity
[34:00] about how none of you are going to like
[34:01] it and it's going to be so boring and so
[34:04] lame and nobody's going to want to come
[34:05] back to camp next year because of my
[34:07] skit and that I'm not cool enough to be
[34:09] up here. That was probably my kids and
[34:12] husband and friends that told me that.
[34:15] you guys.
[34:17] Um, but anyways, let me get to this
[34:19] monologue before I fall off this box.
[34:23] I got to stop smiling.
[34:27] If I cry, please just bear with me.
[34:32] Anyone who grew up in a devoutly
[34:34] Christian home can relate to what I'm
[34:36] about to say.
[34:38] Because we were raised knowing the truth
[34:40] about our future, many of us developed a
[34:42] fear surrounding death and even that
[34:45] widely discussed event, the rapture.
[34:49] How many of you woke up one morning to a
[34:51] suspiciously quiet house? And your first
[34:54] thought was, "I've been left behind."
[34:58] You don't know what to do first. Find
[35:00] your mom or take inventory of the canned
[35:02] goods. Locating your siblings doesn't
[35:05] help because you know if you didn't make
[35:07] it, they definitely didn't.
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:17] On a more serious note, I remember lying
[35:20] awake at night while being plagued with
[35:22] thoughts of fear concerning my eternal
[35:24] fate.
[35:25] I wish those fe I could say that those
[35:27] feelings ended after I got saved. But
[35:30] the mind is a funny thing. Sometimes we
[35:33] develop something like a muscle memory
[35:35] when it comes to certain insecurities.
[35:38] Our mind loves to return to its old
[35:40] haunts. And if you don't expose your
[35:42] fears to the Lord and ask for help, they
[35:44] will continue to torment you. I could
[35:47] have written a skit about the horror of
[35:49] life after death for the unbeliever. But
[35:52] we are all well acquainted with that
[35:54] part of reality. You probably all heard
[35:56] it your whole lives. Today I want to
[35:59] focus on the element of the story that
[36:01] relates to the believers. Those of us
[36:03] who are saved and may be still fighting
[36:05] feelings of needless fear. This leads me
[36:08] to the theme of today's skit.
[36:13] There are certain aspects of each one of
[36:15] you that are lying dormant within you.
[36:19] God is guiding your lives and allows
[36:21] different things to happen specifically
[36:24] because there is a side to me and you
[36:26] that will never come to fruition without
[36:29] going through the things that we go
[36:30] through. And in these last days, God's
[36:33] mission in our lives is to get us ready
[36:35] to meet him.
[36:37] You are about to see a few examples of
[36:39] people who were in the middle of a great
[36:41] trial when God stepped in and showed
[36:44] them a vision of what was in store for
[36:46] them and for each one of us believers.
[36:49] If you are struggling with feelings of
[36:51] doubt or unbelief unbelief and Satan has
[36:54] tried to tell you like he has all of us
[36:56] that God isn't real and that none of
[36:58] this is real. This is the sign you have
[37:01] been looking for. God is real. He loves
[37:05] you. And the same resurrection power
[37:07] that raised Jesus is here in this room.
[37:10] And one day it will raise us up to meet
[37:13] him.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; The name of this kit is called Visions
[37:16] of Heaven. And I hope you all enjoy it.
[37:20] [Applause]
[37:28] [Music]
[37:32] The 1937 flood has left a lasting
[37:35] imprint on Claremont County. The Ohio
[37:37] River stormed out of its banks for 10
[37:39] days in January, claiming lives,
[37:42] property, entire communities.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; We saw it coming up and they kept
[37:47] telling about it, you know, how it kept
[37:49] raining and everything and my husband
[37:51] said, "We better be getting out."
[37:52] &gt;&gt; That was our Katrina. Well, it just
[37:55] looked like a few sheds sticking out
[37:58] under the water.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Devastating. Devastating loss of homes,
[38:03] loss of personal property.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; People
[38:08] basically were scrambling to
[38:12] just to survive.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; River stage at 10:00 tonight, 76.8
[38:18] ft. That is approximately 25 ft above
[38:21] flood stage. Fires which threatened the
[38:23] entire western section of Cincinnati
[38:24] this morning are reported under control
[38:26] at this hour. Bloodboats great yaws
[38:29] which have been rushed from the Atlantic
[38:30] seabboard in the Great Lakes are now
[38:32] resting in the flood waters more to the
[38:34] tops of lampost and telegraph.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; New Richmond was among the communities
[38:39] in the pathway of the floodwaters that
[38:40] raged along an almost 1,000mi path from
[38:43] Pittsburgh to Cairo, Illinois.
[38:47] the come up of flood in 1937.
[38:51] I was on patrol at that time and I was
[38:54] trying my best to bring the people out
[38:56] of the flood houses tearing down and my
[38:58] own wife took sick and she was real real
[39:02] sick with pneumonia. The regular
[39:04] hospital so full we couldn't put her in
[39:06] there. So we take her out to the the
[39:08] government where they had a room out
[39:10] there. And so then they called me back
[39:11] out and I always lived on the river and
[39:14] quite a boatman. So I was trying to get
[39:16] the people rescue him from the flood.
[39:18] They called me said there's a house over
[39:20] on Chester Streets about ready to go in.
[39:22] There's a mother and a bunch of children
[39:23] in there and I shooting those waves of
[39:26] dy broke up there and oh my the just
[39:29] washing the city out. The water pouring
[39:31] through and I heard someone screaming. I
[39:33] seen a mother stand out on the porch.
[39:34] There's them big rollers going through
[39:36] like that. Well, I went on up this way
[39:38] as far as I could and hit the stream and
[39:40] come back and got on that side. I got my
[39:43] boat stopped just in time to tie it
[39:44] around the post of the door and I run in
[39:47] and grabbed the mother and got her in
[39:48] there. Two or three of the children got
[39:50] her over to the shore about a mile and a
[39:52] half across the city. I got her to the
[39:54] shore and then when I got over there she
[39:56] fainted and she began just screaming,
[39:58] "My baby, my baby." Well, I thought that
[40:01] she meant she left the baby in the
[40:03] house. Oh my. I tucked back again while
[40:06] they was trying to take care of her.
[40:07] Come to find out it was she was won't
[40:10] know where a baby was there. There was a
[40:11] little fellow about 3 years old and I
[40:13] thought she meant a little nursing baby
[40:15] or something. And so I tucked back and
[40:17] got over there and when I got that boat
[40:20] and got on the inside and couldn't find
[40:21] old baby and a porch giveaway and the
[40:23] house went in and I run real quick and
[40:25] grabbed the piece there was floating my
[40:28] boat got into the boat and pulled that
[40:30] and loosened up. They done got me out
[40:31] into the curd of the main river. And it
[40:33] was about 11:30 at night and it's
[40:35] sleeping and snowing. And I grabbed a
[40:37] hold of the starter string and I tried
[40:39] to pull the boat and it wouldn't start.
[40:40] And I tried and it wouldn't start. And I
[40:42] tried again getting farther in that
[40:44] curtain. The falls just below me. I
[40:46] thought, "Oh my, here here's my end.
[40:50] This is it." And I'd try real hard and I
[40:52] said, "Lord, please don't let me die
[40:54] death like this." I'd pull and I'd pull.
[40:56] They come back to me. What about that
[40:59] bunch of trash that you wouldn't go to?
[41:02] I put my hand back on the board. I said,
[41:03] "God be merciful to me. Don't let me
[41:05] leave my wife and baby like this. I'm
[41:08] out there sick, please." And I just kept
[41:09] pulling like that and it wouldn't start.
[41:11] And I could feel the roaring down there.
[41:13] It was like just a few minutes and oh
[41:14] my, that' be it.
[41:17] And I said, "Lord, if you'll forgive me,
[41:18] I promise you I'll do anything that you
[41:21] want me to do." And I pulled again and
[41:23] started. And I turned all the gas on it
[41:26] I could and finally got into the shore
[41:28] and I went back to find the truck. Some
[41:31] of them said, "Say the government just
[41:32] washed away. My wife and baby in there,
[41:35] both babies." And I tuck out for the
[41:37] government as hard as it could and water
[41:39] was standing about 15 ft deep all
[41:41] through it. And there was a major there.
[41:43] And I said, "Major, what happened to the
[41:45] hospital?" Said, "Now don't be weary. Do
[41:46] you have anyone in there?" I said, "Yes,
[41:48] a sick wife and two babies." He said,
[41:50] "They all got out." Said, "They're in a
[41:52] freight car and they've headed towards
[41:55] Charleston. I run got my car, my boat in
[41:58] the back of it and then the creeks had
[41:59] come down about two and a half or three
[42:01] miles wide. Some of them said the
[42:03] freight car washed off the tracks out
[42:05] there on the trestle. Well, find myself
[42:08] marooned out on a little island sat
[42:10] there three days just beaten where's my
[42:13] wife and a few days after I got out and
[42:16] got across. She was way up to Columbus,
[42:18] Indiana in the Baptist auditorium where
[42:20] they'd made a a hospital-like sick rooms
[42:24] or little government cotss and I ran to
[42:26] her as hard as I could trying to find
[42:27] where she was screaming, "Hope, hope,
[42:29] hope." And I looked and there she was
[42:31] laying on a cot and TV had sitting.
[42:35] She raised her little bony hand and she
[42:38] said, "Billy." I run to her and I said,
[42:41] "I hope honey." She said, "I look awful,
[42:43] don't I?" I said, "No, honey. You look
[42:44] all right." For about six months, we
[42:47] worked with everything that was in us to
[42:50] try to get to save her life. But she
[42:52] kept getting lower and lower.
[42:55] One day I was on patrol and I had my
[42:59] radio turned on and I heard him say for
[43:03] William Brandham wanted the hospital at
[43:05] once, wife dying. I rushed back to the
[43:08] hospital as quick as I could. Turned on
[43:10] the red light and the sirene and took
[43:12] off. I walked into the room and the
[43:13] nurse was sitting there and she was
[43:15] crying cuz she and Hope was schoolmates
[43:17] together. I looked over and shook her.
[43:20] There she was. She had went down from
[43:22] about 120 lbs to about 60. And if I live
[43:27] uh to be a 100 years old, I'll never
[43:29] forget what happened. She turned over
[43:32] and those great big pretty eyes looked
[43:35] up at me.
[43:37] She smiled. She said, "Why did you call
[43:40] me back, Billy?
[43:43] I said, "What do you mean call you
[43:45] back?" She said, "Bill, you've preached
[43:48] about it. You've talked about it, but
[43:50] you don't have no idea what it is." I
[43:53] said, "What are you talking about?" She
[43:55] said, "Heaven."
[43:56] She said, "I was being escorted home by
[43:59] some people's man or women or something
[44:02] that was dressed in white." And she
[44:04] said, "I was at ease and peace." She
[44:06] said, "Big pretty birds flying from tree
[44:08] to tree." She said, "Don't think I'm
[44:11] beside myself." She didn't know that
[44:13] what was fixing to happen in a few hours
[44:15] then. And I held her darling hands while
[44:18] the angels of God packed her away. I
[44:22] went home. I didn't know what to do. I
[44:25] laid down there at night and a little
[44:28] bit someone called me said, "Billy, your
[44:31] baby's dying." I said, "My baby said,
[44:34] yes." Sharon Rose said, "Doc's up there
[44:36] now." And said, "She's got tubercular
[44:38] menagitis. She nursed it from her
[44:40] mother. I got in the car and went up
[44:42] there and there she was, a sweet little
[44:45] thing. And they rushed her to the
[44:46] hospital. I went out to see him. Sam
[44:48] come up and said, "Billy, don't you go
[44:49] in that room. You got to think of Billy
[44:51] Paul." Said, "She's dying." I said,
[44:53] "Doc, I I got to see my baby." He said,
[44:56] "No, you can't go in." Said, "She's got
[44:58] menitis." Billy, you'd pack it to Billy
[45:01] Paul. I waited till he got out. I
[45:03] couldn't stand to see her down her
[45:05] mother laying down there in the
[45:06] undertaker's establishment.
[45:09] I tell you, the way of a transgressor is
[45:11] hard. And I I went slipped in the door
[45:14] and when Sam went out, the nurse went
[45:16] out, I went out into the basement. She's
[45:18] in an isolated place and the flies was
[45:20] in her little eyes. They had a little
[45:23] what we call a mosquito bar, a little
[45:25] netting over her eyes. And she was a
[45:28] little spasm. Her little fat leg was
[45:30] moving up and down like that. And her
[45:31] little hands with that spasm. And I
[45:34] looked at her and she's just big enough
[45:35] to be cute. about eight months old and
[45:39] her mother used to set her out there
[45:40] with her little three corners on, you
[45:42] know, in the yard when I come up and I'd
[45:44] toot the horn and she'd go goo reaching
[45:47] for me, you know. There laid my darling
[45:50] dying. I looked down to her and I said,
[45:53] "Sherry,
[45:54] you know daddy, you know daddy Sherry."
[45:57] And when she looked, she was suffering
[45:59] so hard that one of them pretty little
[46:00] blue eyes had crossed. It like tore my
[46:04] heart out of me. I knelt down. I said,
[46:06] "Lord,
[46:08] what have I done? Haven't I preached the
[46:11] gospel on the street corners? I've done
[46:14] everything that I know to do. Don't hold
[46:16] it against me." I never call them people
[46:18] trash.
[46:20] It was her that calling people trash. I
[46:22] said, "I'm sorry it all happened.
[46:25] Forgive me. Don't Don't take my baby."
[46:28] And while I was praying, look like a
[46:30] black like a sheet or cloth come down. I
[46:35] know he had to refuse me. Now, there was
[46:38] the hardest and the most treacherous
[46:40] time of my life. When I raised up and
[46:42] looked at her, Satan put in my mind,
[46:45] "Will you mean as hard as you've
[46:47] preached in the way that you've lived?
[46:49] And now, when it comes to your own baby,
[46:52] he'll turn you down."
[46:54] I said, "That's right. If you can't save
[46:57] my baby, then I can't stop."
[47:02] I just didn't know what to do.
[47:05] And then I said, "Lord, you gave her to
[47:08] me and you taken her away. Blessed be
[47:12] the name of the Lord. If you take even
[47:14] me, I'll still love you." And I put my
[47:18] hand over on her. I said, "Bless you,
[47:20] sweetheart." Daddy wanted to raise you
[47:22] with all my heart. I wanted to raise you
[47:25] and raise you to love the Lord.
[47:28] But the angels are coming for you,
[47:30] sweetheart. Daddy will take your little
[47:32] body down and lay it on the arms of
[47:34] mama. I'll bury you with her someday.
[47:38] Daddy will meet you. I stood there to
[47:41] hear Brother Smith, the Methodist
[47:43] preacher that preaches the funeral,
[47:45] ashes to ashes and dust to dust. And I
[47:49] thought, heart to heart,
[47:52] there she went.
[47:54] Not long after that, I took little Billy
[47:56] there one morning. He's this little
[47:58] bitty fell and he was crying for his
[47:59] mama and
[48:01] I didn't have any mama to take him to
[48:03] and he said, "Daddy, where's my mama?
[48:07] Did you put her into that ground?" I
[48:08] said, "No, honey. She's ours. She's up
[48:10] in heaven." He said something there like
[48:13] to kill me. One afternoon, he was
[48:16] crying. I had long late in the evening.
[48:18] He said, "Daddy, please go get mama and
[48:20] bring her here." And I said, "Honey, I
[48:22] can't get mama." Said, "Well, tell Jesus
[48:25] to send me my mama. I want her. I said,
[48:28] "Well, honey, I me and you going to go
[48:31] see her sometime."
[48:33] And he stopped said, "Daddy." And I
[48:35] said, "Yeah." Said, "I see mama up there
[48:37] on that cloud."
[48:41] Like to kill me. I just almost fainted.
[48:43] I hugged the little fell up to my bosom
[48:45] like just held my head down. Days
[48:48] passed. I couldn't forget it. I tried to
[48:52] work. Couldn't go back home. It wasn't
[48:54] home no more. I wanted to stay. And I
[48:56] remember one day I was trying to work
[48:58] and public service. I went up to fix a
[49:01] an old secretary was hanging down. It
[49:03] was real early of a morning and I
[49:04] climbed up this cross and I couldn't
[49:07] give that baby up. I could see my wife
[49:09] going but that baby going just a little
[49:11] bitty thing and the primaries run down
[49:13] to the transformer and went out in, you
[49:15] know, secondary. And I was hanging up
[49:17] there on a and I happened to look the
[49:19] sun coming up behind me and there my
[49:21] hands stretched out and the sign of that
[49:23] cross on the on the hillside. I thought
[49:26] yes it was my sins that put him there.
[49:31] I said Sharon honey daddy wants to see
[49:33] you so bad honey. I would like to hold
[49:36] you in my arms again you darling little
[49:39] thing.
[49:40] I got beside myself. It been weeks I
[49:43] pulled off my rubber glove. There's
[49:45] 2,300 volts running right to the side of
[49:47] me. I said, "God, I hate to do this. I'm
[49:50] a coward, but Sherry, daddy's going to
[49:52] see you and mommy just in a few
[49:54] minutes." Started pulling on my glove to
[49:56] put my hand on that 2300 and something
[49:58] happened. When I come to you, I was
[50:01] sitting on the ground with my hands up
[50:04] like this to my face crying.
[50:07] It was God's grace. I wouldn't been
[50:08] having a healing service. Sure, I'm sure
[50:10] of that. I started home. I quit. Put my
[50:13] tools away and went back. I said, "I'm
[50:14] going home." I took the mail and I
[50:16] looked in the mail and the first thing
[50:18] on there was her little Christmas saving
[50:21] 80 cents. Miss Sharon Rose Brandom.
[50:24] There it was all over again. I reached
[50:27] in there and got my gun pistol out from
[50:31] the holster.
[50:32] I said, "Lord, I I can't go this
[50:34] anymore. I'm I'm dying. I'm I'm so
[50:37] tormented." I pulled the hammer back on
[50:40] the gun, put it up to my head, and
[50:42] kneeling there on that cot in that dark
[50:44] room. I said, "Our Father, art in
[50:48] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[50:52] kingdom come, thine will be done as I
[50:54] try." I squeeze that trigger as hard as
[50:57] I could. I said, "On earth as it is in
[51:00] heaven. Give us this day our daily
[51:02] bread." And it wouldn't go off.
[51:06] I thought, "Oh, God, are you just
[51:08] tearing me to pieces? What have I done?
[51:10] You won't even let me die." And I throw
[51:14] the gun down and went off and shot in
[51:16] the room.
[51:37] Since the fall of Adam, all of humanity
[51:40] has been trapped in sin. We were cut off
[51:42] from God and born unto death without
[51:45] knowledge of what lay beyond the grave.
[51:47] But God in his mercy had a plan for
[51:50] redemption.
[51:51] I have dedicated my life to the studying
[51:54] of scriptures. And as a premier student
[51:56] of law and prophets, I have achieved the
[51:58] prestigious title Pharisee of Pharisees.
[52:02] And in my searching, I have noticed a
[52:04] few remarkable accounts of when people
[52:06] saw a p saw a vision of heaven.
[52:13] Not a mystical void, but a real place
[52:15] with real people. Let us now reflect on
[52:18] one of the earliest accounts of when
[52:20] someone saw past the veil into glories
[52:22] beyond.
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:55] The best and greatest patrol.
[53:08] [Music]

[53:22] &gt;&gt; A let us ask God's blessing on this one.
[53:29] God of heaven, we thank you for the

[53:35] you for my 7,000 sheep, my 3,000 camels,
[53:39] and my 500 yolk of oxen. Also for my 500
[53:44] female donkeys. Lord, I thank you for my
[53:47] seven sons, my three daughters, and for
[53:49] my pleasant, gracious wife. And Lord,

[53:57] But most of all, Lord, I thank you for

[54:01] continually. Amen.
[54:07] [Music]
[54:12] [Applause]
[54:24] One day the sons of God came to give.
[54:30] One day the sons of God came to give
[54:33] their accounts before the Lord and Satan
[54:36] the accuser came also.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Where have you been, oh evil one? And
[54:41] what have you been doing?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, I've been around here and
[54:46] there seeking to devour.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Have you considered my servant Job?
[54:50] There is no one on earth like him. He is
[54:52] blameless and upright, a man who fears
[54:55] God and shuns evil.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Job?
[54:58] Of course, I've noticed Job. And we all
[55:01] know the only reason he serves you so
[55:03] fervently is because you bless
[55:06] everything he touches. And not to
[55:08] mention that hedge of protection you
[55:10] have around him. Even his animals are
[55:12] protected. I guarantee you that if you
[55:14] stretch out your hand against him and
[55:16] take his stuff away, he will curse you
[55:18] to your face.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Very well then. Everything he has is in
[55:22] your power. But on Job himself, do not
[55:26] lay a finger.
[55:33] [Applause]
[56:11] Master, docks were plowing and the
[56:13] donkeys were grazing nearby and the
[56:14] savians attacked us. They took the
[56:16] donkeys and killed the other servants
[56:17] with swords. I won't escape to tell you.
[56:19] Sabians,
[56:21] I can't believe this.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Master, the sheets were grazing. The
[56:26] sheets were in the
[56:30] sheets were
[56:32] the sheep. A raging fire fell from the
[56:34] sky and burnt up all the sheep and
[56:35] devoured the other shepherds. I alone
[56:37] escaped to tell you.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Not the sheep,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; master.
[56:42] Master, the Chaldians have attacked us
[56:45] and they raided the camels and they took
[56:47] them. Now the other servants, they
[56:50] killed them.
[56:52] I won't escape to tell you. How is this
[56:55] possible? What sort of madness is this,
[56:58] &gt;&gt; master?
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, what now? My mother-in-law isn't
[57:00] coming, is she?
[57:04] Master, I bring you terrible news. Your
[57:06] sons and your daughters were having a
[57:08] feast in your oldest son's house when
[57:10] suddenly a strong wind came from the
[57:12] desert and struck the four corners of
[57:13] the house and fell on the young people
[57:15] and they all died. I alone have escaped
[57:17] to tell you.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Then Job arose. He tore his clothes,
[57:24] shaved his head, fell to the ground, and
[57:27] worshiped. He said,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; "I came into this world with nothing,
[57:32] and that is how I will leave it. The
[57:34] Lord has given. The Lord has taken away.
[57:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[57:38] &gt;&gt; In all of this, Job didn't sin or blame
[57:41] God.
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:54] Again
[58:02] the sons of God came to give their
[58:04] accounts before the Lord. And again
[58:06] Satan came also.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Satan, where have you been? Have you
[58:11] considered my friend Job? There is no
[58:13] one on earth like him. He is blameless
[58:16] and upright, a man who fears God and
[58:18] shuns evil. and he still maintains his
[58:21] integrity even though you incited me
[58:23] against him to ruin him without any
[58:25] reason.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Skin for skin, humans will do anything
[58:29] to save their own lives. It's obvious
[58:32] he's only serving you out of fear. But
[58:34] what do you think would happen if you
[58:36] reached down and took away his health?
[58:38] That would make anyone curse you.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Very well then. He is in your hands, but
[58:43] you must spare his life.
[58:46] So, Satan went out from the presence of
[58:48] the Lord and afflicted Job with painful
[58:51] soores from the soles of his feet to the
[58:54] crown of his head. Then, Job took a
[58:56] piece of broken pottery and scraped
[58:58] himself with it as he sat on a trash
[59:00] heap among the ashes.
[59:25] Can you tell me your name?
[59:27] &gt;&gt; I am Ilifas Damite, a man of great
[59:30] wisdom and even greater self-confidence.
[59:34] I've always been known for my eloquent
[59:35] speeches and my ability to connect dots.
[59:42] I once predicted a drought months in
[59:44] advance, just by the way a particular
[59:46] donkey was looking at me. An impressive
[59:48] feat if I do say so myself.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I can do it myself.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; I am Bill the Shuite, a man of tradition
[1:00:08] and a staunch defender of the old way. I
[1:00:11] believe that everything happens for a
[1:00:12] reason and that reason is usually
[1:00:14] something your greatgrandfather did.
[1:00:18] My favorite pastime is reminding people
[1:00:20] of their ancestors potential misdeeds.
[1:00:25] It is a very humbling hobby.
[1:00:44] Who are you?
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Get out of here, kid. Let your elder
[1:00:47] speak.
[1:00:50] My name is Zofa.
[1:00:53] Oh,
[1:00:55] put it in. Put it in.
[1:01:00] Yeah, that that that. Thank you.
[1:01:05] I am Sofa the Neoth and I dare say the
[1:01:09] most direct of the bunch. I don't mince
[1:01:11] my words and if I think you're wrong, I
[1:01:14] tell you you're wrong. And I'll probably
[1:01:17] do it in a very very loud way. I once
[1:01:20] got into a heated debate with a donkey
[1:01:22] about the best way to carry a sack of
[1:01:24] grain. I the donkey blinked at me which
[1:01:28] I took as a sign of defeat.
[1:01:31] And can you tell me about the last seven
[1:01:32] days of silence?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; It was a time of profound, meaningful
[1:01:36] silence. I was busy in my mind. I was
[1:01:40] going to use a metaphor about a storm
[1:01:42] and a tree.
[1:01:43] But I couldn't decide if the tree should
[1:01:45] be an oak or a sycamore. The whole seven
[1:01:47] days passed just thinking about it.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't silence. It was a test of
[1:01:51] willpower. A divine staring contest, if
[1:01:54] you will. We were waiting for Job to
[1:01:56] crack, to confess, and admit his sins.
[1:01:59] But he just sat there covered in boils
[1:02:01] with a look on his face that said, "Are
[1:02:03] you guys serious?" The silence was so
[1:02:06] thick you could have kneedeed it into a
[1:02:08] loaf of bread.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; It was torture. I had a hundred things
[1:02:13] to say, but I fell kept giving me these
[1:02:16] evil glares. I think he has a side job
[1:02:18] as a professional eye glare therapist.
[1:02:21] So I just sat there, my mind racing,
[1:02:23] thinking of all the ways I could subtly
[1:02:25] hint that he was a sinner. I even tied a
[1:02:27] game of charades, but no one played at
[1:02:29] all.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; They call it silence. I was busy trying
[1:02:38] to find a decent bandage for his boils
[1:02:40] and they're sitting there in a circle
[1:02:42] looking at each other. I thought they
[1:02:44] were playing some kind of bizarre card
[1:02:45] game. I went out and milked the one goat
[1:02:47] we had left and they were still sitting
[1:02:49] there seven days. I could have baked a
[1:02:52] dozen loaves of bread in that time.
[1:02:56] Now it's raining.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; And what did you do to cheer Joe up?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; I told him a story about the talking
[1:03:03] squirrel who found the treasure.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; It was a very uplifting and moral tale.
[1:03:12] He didn't seem to get the moral, though
[1:03:15] I think his boils were distracting.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; I brought him a handful of my finest
[1:03:23] barley. I said, "Job, look. It's a
[1:03:25] symbol of new beginnings of hope. He
[1:03:28] just looked at me. He said, "I am
[1:03:32] covered in boils bed. I can't even eat
[1:03:35] the nerve." I even read him some
[1:03:38] parables about sinners.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Lo, I shall rain upon you a thousand
[1:03:42] curses and pestilent diseases for all of
[1:03:45] thy sins. There shall be many and of
[1:03:49] great multitude.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; They always cheered me up when I was
[1:03:53] down.
[1:03:55] I tried to do a little comedic routine
[1:03:57] for him. I put a leaf on my head and
[1:03:59] pretended to be a tree.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; What did the tree say to the st?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Trees don't talk. You
[1:04:06] laugh. I will leave you alone.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I did some terrible tree.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; What happened to leaves in a you know
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; they fall?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Not even a chuckle. I even did
[1:04:17] a dramatic fall at the end.
[1:04:22] Crickets. Literally crickets.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Me and my young cousin Alu did a
[1:04:29] beautiful song and dance, but he just
[1:04:31] put more ashes on his head.
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:46] He needs to just curse God and die. I
[1:04:49] told him so, but he never listens to me.
[1:04:53] These friends only want Joe for the
[1:04:55] feast.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Here I am giving him my fine china to
[1:05:00] scrape his boils.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; I know you're not sleeping, Joe.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Why do you think Job is suffering? He's
[1:05:12] a secret gambler. I'm telling you. I saw
[1:05:15] him looking at a pair of dice once. He
[1:05:18] probably made a bet with God that he
[1:05:20] couldn't lose everything and he lost big
[1:05:23] time.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Ancestral karma. His great
[1:05:26] greatgrandfather was a notorious
[1:05:28] litterbug. He didn't even pick up his
[1:05:30] trash. Now, generations later, Job is
[1:05:34] suffering the consequence.
[1:05:37] The divine ecosystem is very straight.
[1:05:40] He's an uncomforted farmer. He probably
[1:05:42] planted his seeds at the wrong time. And
[1:05:44] now God is showing him the natural
[1:05:46] consequences of his actions.
[1:05:51] It is an agricultural lesson. A very,
[1:05:54] very, very harsh one.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Job's friends don't know what they're
[1:05:58] talking about. I am his wife. I have to
[1:06:01] live with the boils, the loss, and now
[1:06:03] these three, they showed up and sat in
[1:06:05] silence. And now they're telling me my
[1:06:08] husband's either a gambler or a bad
[1:06:10] farmer. I don't care about any of that.
[1:06:12] All I want is for this to be over. My
[1:06:15] curse god and die comment was less of a
[1:06:18] command and more of a sincere request. I
[1:06:20] was tired of listening to their
[1:06:21] theories. I wanted a little bit of
[1:06:23] divine intervention to get us out of
[1:06:25] this situation.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Gambling is a sin. The dice, the thrill,
[1:06:30] it's all a precursor to divine
[1:06:31] punishment.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Move, move, get up. It's not the
[1:06:34] gambling. It's the littering. throwing
[1:06:36] trash everywhere. It breaks the divine
[1:06:38] order of things.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. You're both wrong. It is
[1:06:41] he was bad farmer. He's a bad farmer. He
[1:06:44] planted his crops in the wrong season.
[1:06:46] How can you do something like that and
[1:06:47] expect to get away with it? The most
[1:06:49] basic sin of all.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. It's
[1:06:54] not a farmer. He tell you he feels
[1:06:55] stressed
[1:07:05] in the wrong season.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't
[1:07:10] trash him.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Bill Dad. My gambling theory
[1:07:21] was a long shot.
[1:07:23] And I'm sorry, Zofar. My letter back
[1:07:26] theory was a little bit trashy.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. My family was unseated.
[1:08:00] [Applause]
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:08] We the United Force of Comforters have
[1:08:10] come to a realization. While our
[1:08:13] individual theories were varied, the God
[1:08:16] truth remains. Job is a secret sinner.
[1:08:19] We've decided to put aside our
[1:08:22] differences and convince him to confess.
[1:08:28] We're going to show him a detailed
[1:08:30] handheld shot that shows him clearly
[1:08:33] between sin and suffering. We've even
[1:08:37] created a series of motivational posters
[1:08:39] with our faces on them. It is time for
[1:08:42] job to face the truth. And we are just
[1:08:44] the guys to make sure that he does.
[1:09:09] Cursed is the day I was born. Why didn't
[1:09:11] I just die at birth? My life is
[1:09:13] meaningless and nothing but misery.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Job, my friend, no one suffers without
[1:09:18] cause. Pain is God's way of teaching.
[1:09:20] Maybe he's correcting you
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; for what? I've searched my heart. I've
[1:09:24] lived righteously, but yet I'm still
[1:09:26] suffering.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; God doesn't punish the innocent. You say
[1:09:29] you're blameless, but the righteous
[1:09:30] don't suffer like this. Repent and he
[1:09:33] will restore you.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Repent for what? I'm innocent. If only I
[1:09:38] could just plead my case before God. But
[1:09:40] there's no mediator between us and I
[1:09:42] feel eternally separated from him.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Enough of your excuses, Job. God is
[1:09:48] just. If you are suffering, it is
[1:09:49] because you deserve it.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And what if there is no justice?
[1:09:53] Restoration after repentance. My story
[1:09:55] will end with the grave. We all return
[1:09:57] to dust, rich or poor, good or evil.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; You speak of shadows and despair, but
[1:10:02] God knows your heart, Job. He's waiting
[1:10:04] for you to return to him.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; I long for that. I beg him to hear my
[1:10:08] cries, but it feels as if heaven is
[1:10:10] silent.
[1:10:12] I've lost everything. My soul is in
[1:10:14] anguish. What's the point of all this?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Even now, God could heal you. But you
[1:10:19] must stop accusing him and confess your
[1:10:21] sin. And then hope he will forgive you.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hope? Hope feels out of reach. I fear
[1:10:27] that when I breathe my last breath, I
[1:10:28] will be forgotten like dust in the wind.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; You talk in circles. Just repent
[1:10:33] already.
[1:10:34] Man is of a few days, full of trouble.
[1:10:37] Life is like a shadow. It vanishes. Then
[1:10:40] what? Nothing.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Now you speak in riddles. This is
[1:10:44] foolishness.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Miserable comforters. All of you. You
[1:10:48] don't ease my pain. You only make it
[1:10:49] worse. Okay, I've heard enough. I have
[1:10:52] stayed quiet out of respect for my
[1:10:54] elders, but none of you is making any
[1:10:56] sense. Job, you're like, "I'm innocent,
[1:10:58] but God is against me." But that's not
[1:11:00] how it works. God is just trying to
[1:11:02] teach you a lesson and you're walling
[1:11:03] around in your self-pity.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; I want to believe that. I want to know
[1:11:07] that there's a purpose in all this, but
[1:11:08] I feel completely alone.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; He's here even now. Don't lose hope. You
[1:11:13] may not see him yet, but he sees you.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe he does see me. And I wonder if my
[1:11:21] friends, I've seen something in nature.
[1:11:24] When a tree is cut down, life may come
[1:11:26] from the root again if water reaches it.
[1:11:28] Could it be possible for new life to
[1:11:30] emerge from me who has been cut down?
[1:11:33] When a flower that dies in the winter
[1:11:35] can go in the ground and live again in
[1:11:37] the spring, I ask you, can a man live
[1:11:40] again?
[1:11:43] I see something.
[1:11:45] A vision.
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:56] Fill this mind
[1:12:01] with the knowledge of your love.
[1:12:08] Hold me fast
[1:12:12] through the deep and steady current.
[1:12:19] How long? How long till these tears are
[1:12:24] gone?
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:29] Every hour.
[1:12:34] Awake me to your presence.
[1:12:40] Shine your light
[1:12:46] brighter than the dawn.
[1:12:52] Send your joy.
[1:12:57] Illuminate the darkness.
[1:13:04] How long? How long till these tears are
[1:13:08] gone?
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:55] I'll fix my
[1:13:58] on eternity above.
[1:14:05] Where every light
[1:14:08] is uncovered by your love.
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:16] I'll fix my eyes
[1:14:19] on eternity.
[1:14:23] Oh,
[1:14:27] every lie
[1:14:29] is uncovered by your love.
[1:14:36] Every
[1:14:38] shadow uncovered by your love.
[1:14:45] Every
[1:14:47] shadow covered by your love.
[1:14:58] I know that my
[1:15:00] shall stand at last on the earth. And
[1:15:03] after my body is destroyed, this I know
[1:15:05] that in my flesh I shall see God.
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:24] I said, "God,
[1:15:27] why can't I die and get out of it? I
[1:15:29] just can't go no father. You've got to
[1:15:31] do something to me." And I fell over and
[1:15:33] started crying on my little old dirty
[1:15:35] bunk there.
[1:15:37] And I must have went to sleep.
[1:15:40] I don't know whether it was asleep or
[1:15:41] what happened. And I thought I was going
[1:15:44] down along through the prairie as I went
[1:15:46] along. I noticed an old covered wagon
[1:15:50] like an old prairie schooner. And the
[1:15:53] wheel was broke. Of course, that
[1:15:55] represented my broken family. And as I
[1:15:58] got close, I looked there stood a a real
[1:16:01] pretty young girl about 20 years old,
[1:16:04] white flowing hair and blue eyes,
[1:16:07] dressed in white. I looked over at her.
[1:16:09] I said, "How do you do?" Went on. She
[1:16:11] said, "Hello, Dad.
[1:16:13] I turned back. I said, "Dad,
[1:16:17] why?" I said, "How miss can you can I be
[1:16:20] your daddy when you're as old as I am?"
[1:16:22] She said, "Daddy, you just don't know
[1:16:23] where you're at."
[1:16:26] And I said, "What do you mean?" She
[1:16:28] said, "This is heaven."
[1:16:32] Said, "On earth? I was your little
[1:16:33] Sharon?" "Well," I said, "Honey, you
[1:16:36] were just a little baby." Said, "Daddy,
[1:16:38] little babies are not little babies
[1:16:39] here. They're immortal. They never get
[1:16:41] old or never grow.
[1:16:45] And I said,
[1:16:47] "Oh, Sharon, honey, you you're a pretty
[1:16:50] young woman." She said, "Mama's waiting
[1:16:52] for you."
[1:16:54] I said, "Where?"
[1:16:57] She said, "Up at your new home." I said,
[1:16:59] "New home? Brandoms are vagabonds. They
[1:17:02] don't have homes. They just I said,
[1:17:05] 'Well, I never had a home, honey." She
[1:17:07] said, "But you got one up here, Daddy.
[1:17:10] And I turned and looked and there was
[1:17:13] great big palaces
[1:17:17] and the glory of God coming up around
[1:17:20] him and I heard angelic choir singing my
[1:17:23] home sweet home.
[1:17:26] I started up a long steps running just
[1:17:28] as hard as I could and when I got to the
[1:17:31] door there she stood
[1:17:34] a white garment on that black hair long
[1:17:36] holding down her back. She raised out
[1:17:39] her arms as she always did want to come
[1:17:41] home tired from work or something. I
[1:17:44] caught her with the hands of
[1:17:47] I said, "Honey, I seen Sharon down
[1:17:49] there." I said, "She made a pretty girl,
[1:17:52] didn't you?" She said, "Yes, Bill." She
[1:17:55] said, "Bill put her arms around me and
[1:17:59] she said, "Stop worrying about me and
[1:18:01] Sharon."
[1:18:02] I said, "Honey, I can't help it." She
[1:18:05] said, "Now, Sharon and I are better off
[1:18:07] than you are." And said, "Don't worry
[1:18:10] about us no more. Will you promise me?"
[1:18:14] I said, "I've been so lonesome for you
[1:18:17] and for Sharon and Billy cries all the
[1:18:20] time for you." She said, "It'll be all
[1:18:23] right, Bill." And she said, "Won't you
[1:18:26] sit down?" And I looked around and
[1:18:28] there's a great big chair.
[1:18:31] I remember I tried to buy a chair one
[1:18:34] time. We had them old old common wooden
[1:18:37] bottom chairs and we could buy one of
[1:18:39] these chairs that they let back in the
[1:18:41] back like a kind of easy rest chair and
[1:18:43] it cost $17. You could pay $3 down and a
[1:18:47] dollar a week. One day I got behind on
[1:18:49] my payments. We couldn't make it and it
[1:18:52] got day after day and finally one day
[1:18:54] they come and got my chair and tuck it.
[1:18:58] She told me up there she said, "You
[1:19:00] remember that chair, Bill?" I said,
[1:19:02] "Yes, honey, I remember." She says,
[1:19:03] "What you think about what Jeff?" Said,
[1:19:05] "Well, they won't take this one. This
[1:19:08] one's paid for."
[1:19:12] She said, "Sit down just a minute. I
[1:19:14] want to talk to you."
[1:19:16] And I said, "Honey,
[1:19:19] I don't understand this." And she said,
[1:19:21] "Promise me, Billy. Promise me that you
[1:19:24] won't worry anymore. You're going back
[1:19:25] now." And I said, "I can't do that." Oh.
[1:19:28] And just then, I come too.
[1:19:30] It was dark in the room.
[1:19:33] I looked around and I felt her arm
[1:19:35] around me.
[1:19:38] I said, "Oh, are you here in the room?"
[1:19:41] She started patting me.
[1:19:43] She said, "You going to make me that
[1:19:45] promise bill?" I said, "I promise you."
[1:19:49] And when she patted me two or three
[1:19:51] times and she was gone,
[1:19:54] I jumped up and turned on the light,
[1:19:56] looked everywhere. She was gone.
[1:20:01] But she's just gone out of the room. She
[1:20:04] isn't gone. She's still living.
[1:20:07] She was a Christian.
[1:20:11] Oh Lord.
[1:20:16] Many times, Lord, I'm sure people don't
[1:20:19] understand when they think these things
[1:20:21] come easy.
[1:20:26] But there's a great day coming when
[1:20:29] Jesus shall come and all these sorrows
[1:20:32] will be wiped away.
[1:20:35] I pray, heavenly father, that you'll
[1:20:38] help us to be prepared. And that last
[1:20:42] promise when I kissed her on the cheek
[1:20:44] that morning and I'd meet her there that
[1:20:46] day. I believe she'll be standing at
[1:20:49] that post screaming my name.
[1:20:52] One of these days, we're going to close
[1:20:54] this Bible for the last time. God, keep
[1:20:58] me faithful to the promise. Keep your
[1:21:01] grace around me, Lord.
[1:21:04] I may not look at the things of this
[1:21:06] life, but live for the things that's
[1:21:09] beyond
[1:21:11] someday when it's all over and we gather
[1:21:13] around under the evergreen trees.
[1:21:16] It'll be a great time, man. And those
[1:21:19] who are here, Lord, may not even know
[1:21:22] you. Maybe they've got some little love
[1:21:24] across the sea on earth.
[1:21:28] If they've never fulfilled their
[1:21:31] promise, may they do it now.
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:22:24] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[1:22:30] want
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:33] in green pastures. He makes me lie down.
[1:22:42] He restores
[1:22:44] my soul
[1:22:47] and leads me on for his name,
[1:22:54] for his great name.

[1:22:59] Surely goodness,
[1:23:04] surely mercy
[1:23:08] right beside me all my days

[1:23:30] your holy
[1:23:32] name.
[1:23:37] You prepare a table right before me
[1:23:46] in the presence of my eneies.
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:55] Though the arrow
[1:23:57] flies
[1:23:59] and the terror
[1:24:01] of night is at my door.
[1:24:06] Oh, I trust you, Lord.

[1:24:11] And surely goodness,
[1:24:16] surely mercy
[1:24:21] right beside me all my days.

[1:24:40] and bless
[1:24:42] your holy
[1:24:44] name.
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:48] And even though I walk through the
[1:24:50] valley of the shadow of death,
[1:24:55] oh, I will fear no.
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:03] Oh,
[1:25:06] and even though I walk through the
[1:25:08] valley of the shadow of death,

[1:25:26] valley of the shadow of death,
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:31] I will fear no evil.

[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; you are on my side.
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:25:59] Surely goodness,
[1:26:04] surely mercy. Sing it. Let me hear you.
[1:26:08] right beside me. Oh, do you believe
[1:26:13] that? My days
[1:26:18] and I will dwell in Yes, Lord. Your
[1:26:22] house forever.
[1:26:27] Oh, and bless.
[1:26:29] Oh, you're holy.
[1:26:32] Let's sing this even though. And even
[1:26:36] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:26:39] shadow of day.

[1:27:14] shadow of death.

[1:27:31] valley of the shadow of death,

[1:27:36] oh, you are on my side.
[1:27:43] Oh,

[1:27:49] Sing it now. Surely mercy
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; right beside right beside.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh my days.

[1:28:13] Bless
[1:28:16] your holy
[1:28:19] surace.
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:26] Oh, surely mercy
[1:28:31] right.
[1:28:33] Oh, thank you Lord. Oh my
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] dwelling
[1:28:44] for your house forever.
[1:28:49] Oh bless
[1:28:52] your holy
[1:28:54] name.
[1:28:56] And I Oh, and I will dwell in
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; your house forever
[1:29:08] and bless
[1:29:10] your holy
[1:29:13] name.
[1:29:16] Let's worship him. You can bless his
[1:29:18] name this morning.
[1:29:20] Praise our God. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:29:23] Lord.
[1:29:25] Oh, let's praise him. Tell him you love
[1:29:28] him this morning. Give him praise.
[1:29:30] Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] were blessed more than in his beginning.
[1:30:18] His flocks were returned. His wealth was
[1:30:20] restored, and 10 new children were born
[1:30:22] unto him. But the true miracle of Job's
[1:30:25] life was not in what was regained, but
[1:30:28] in what was revealed to him. For out of
[1:30:30] the ashes and agony came that crucial
[1:30:33] question, can a man live again? And
[1:30:36] through this, God revealed his plan of
[1:30:38] redemption. And now we know that when
[1:30:41] the suffering of this life is over, we
[1:30:43] will behold our redeemer.
[1:30:46] Once I too was in need of a redeemer.
[1:30:50] While I dedicated my entire life to
[1:30:53] studying the scripture, I acted
[1:30:55] ignorantly and in unbelief. I persecuted
[1:30:58] the very one I thought I was serving.
[1:31:18] This man speaks against Moses and
[1:31:20] against God. He says Jesus of Nazareth
[1:31:23] will destroy this temple.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, he dares our traditions are
[1:31:27] worthless.
[1:31:31] And he calls this criminal Jesus, the
[1:31:34] righteous one. Brothers, listen to me.
[1:31:38] From Abraham to Moses, from David to the
[1:31:40] prophets, God has always been with us.
[1:31:43] But time and again, our fathers turned
[1:31:45] away. They rejected his messengers. And
[1:31:48] now, just like them, you are stiff
[1:31:50] necked and resist the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Just as your fathers persecuted the
[1:31:55] prophets, so now you have betrayed and
[1:31:58] murdered the righteous one.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Blasphemy. Do not listen to him.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; He deserves death.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Stone him.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Stone him.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Stone him.
[1:32:08] Steven, you have been found guilty of
[1:32:11] blasphemy and shall be stoned to death.
[1:32:15] Do you have any final words?
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:21] Behold,
[1:32:23] I see the heavens open, the son of man
[1:32:27] standing at the right hand of God.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; No. No. Kill him.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Stone him,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; traitor. Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
[1:32:39] Do not hold their sins against them.
[1:32:42] No. No.
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:33:07] [Applause]
[1:33:19] I was there. I held the cloak as Steven
[1:33:23] was stoned. I gave my approval and I was
[1:33:26] blind in my heart.
[1:33:31] But on the road to Damascus, I met him,
[1:33:34] Jesus, the one I persecuted. In his
[1:33:38] mercy, he opened my eyes.
[1:33:41] From that day, I was no longer Saul the
[1:33:44] destroyer, but Paul, a servant of
[1:33:46] Christ.
[1:33:48] I suffered for his name, beaten, stoned,
[1:33:53] imprisoned, and even shipwrecked. Yet in
[1:33:56] all of this, the Lord sustained me. Once
[1:34:00] I too was caught up in paradise, in the
[1:34:02] third heaven, what I saw there cannot be
[1:34:05] told in words. Glory beyond compare.
[1:34:11] Though this all may seem implausible, I
[1:34:13] am no different than so many others who
[1:34:15] have endured tribulation but were
[1:34:17] strengthened by the glory of the next
[1:34:19] life. Even Jesus himself, who suffered
[1:34:23] as no other man has suffered, endured
[1:34:25] the cross by fixing his eyes on the joys
[1:34:28] set before him. Let us hear the voices
[1:34:31] of the cloud of witnesses. Through the
[1:34:34] ages, their pain gave way to visions of
[1:34:37] heaven.
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:46] I am Jacob, son of Isaac. I was running
[1:34:49] for my life on that cold night and had
[1:34:51] only a stone for my pillow. I dreamed a
[1:34:53] dream and I saw a ladder reaching to
[1:34:55] heaven with angels ascending and
[1:34:58] descending and the Lord above it. This
[1:35:00] vision sustained me in the wilderness.
[1:35:08] I am Elijah, a prophet of the Lord.
[1:35:11] Crushed by fear and despair, I hid in
[1:35:13] the darkest cave. But I saw the Lord
[1:35:16] pass by, not in the wind, nor the fire,
[1:35:20] nor the earthquake, but in a gentle
[1:35:22] whisper that restored my soul.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; I am Holda, a prophetist. When judgment
[1:35:32] loomed over Jerusalem and all seemed
[1:35:34] lost, the word of the Lord came to me
[1:35:36] and mercy was promised to our king. This
[1:35:38] word gave hope that God's people would
[1:35:40] not be forsaken.
[1:35:48] I am the prophet Isaiah. When my beloved
[1:35:50] King Uzziah died, my heart was crushed
[1:35:53] with grief. Yet in that dark year, I saw
[1:35:56] the Lord seated on his throne high and
[1:35:58] lifted up, and his train filled the
[1:36:01] temple.
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:09] My name is Ezekiel the prophet. Far from
[1:36:12] ancestral home, I was captive by the
[1:36:14] river Chabbar. There I sat among the
[1:36:17] exiles. But then the heavens were
[1:36:19] opened. I saw wheels of fire, living
[1:36:22] creatures, and the glory of the Lord
[1:36:25] shining bright. That vision became an
[1:36:27] encouragement for generations to follow.
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:37] I am Daniel, a prophet of the one true
[1:36:40] God. In Babylon, surrounded by lions and
[1:36:43] pagan kings, I dreamed in the night, and
[1:36:45] I saw one like the Son of Man coming
[1:36:48] with the clouds of heaven, his kingdom
[1:36:51] everlasting.
[1:36:58] I am Mary of Magdala. I have never felt
[1:37:00] grief so terrible as when they crucified
[1:37:02] my Lord. When the deepest sorrow flooded
[1:37:05] my very soul. I saw the risen Lord and
[1:37:08] he called me by my name.
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:15] I am Peter, a follower of the Lord
[1:37:17] Jesus. I was imprisoned for my faith,
[1:37:20] lying bound in the dark of night,
[1:37:21] awaiting my death. I was awakened by a
[1:37:24] light, an angel of the Lord. My chains
[1:37:27] fell and the gates opened before me.
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:36] I am the Apostle John and I was boiled
[1:37:39] alive for the sake of my Lord. Before
[1:37:41] they banished me to the aisle of Patmas
[1:37:43] for my faith, where I lived as a slave,
[1:37:46] alone in my chains, I was caught up in
[1:37:49] the spirit. And I saw a throne in heaven
[1:37:52] and one that sat upon it surrounded by
[1:37:54] angels crying, "Holy, holy, holy is the
[1:37:59] Lord.
[1:38:00] [Applause]
[1:38:06] My name is Polycarp. I was martyed for
[1:38:08] following God's truth. As a fire rose to
[1:38:11] consume me, I looked beyond the flames
[1:38:13] and I saw not death but life eternal
[1:38:16] with Christ my King.
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:24] I am a young mother named Perpeta. I was
[1:38:27] put to death for my faith. From my
[1:38:29] prison cell awaiting the arena, I
[1:38:32] dreamed of a golden ladder reaching into
[1:38:35] heaven. And I knew that soon I would
[1:38:37] climb it to see my Lord.
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:54] I am I am John Bunan, a preacher from a
[1:38:58] gold dark prison cell. I am John Bunan,
[1:39:01] a preacher from a gold dark prison cell
[1:39:03] where I had been in prison for my faith.
[1:39:06] I had a supernatural dream. I saw a
[1:39:09] pilgrim's journey crossing the river
[1:39:11] into the celestial city where the king
[1:39:13] welcomed him. I knew then that at my
[1:39:15] journey's end, I would also see my king
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:36] and I raised up on my pillow, put my
[1:39:40] head up on the the headboard of the bed,
[1:39:42] and put my hands behind
[1:39:44] I just wonder what it will be the other
[1:39:46] side. I am already 50 and I haven't done
[1:39:52] nothing yet. If I could only do
[1:39:54] something to help the Lord. I don't want
[1:39:57] you to miss this. It has changed me. I
[1:40:01] can't be the same brother of Brandon
[1:40:03] that I was. And I heard something kept
[1:40:05] saying, "You're just starting. Press the
[1:40:09] battle. Just keep pressing."
[1:40:12] I said, I just probably imagine that.
[1:40:16] And there it come again. Said, just keep
[1:40:18] pressing. If you only knew what was at
[1:40:22] the end of the road. And it seemed like
[1:40:25] I could hear Grim Snelling or somebody
[1:40:27] that sang that song. I'm home sick and
[1:40:31] blue.
[1:40:33] And I want to see Jesus. I would like to
[1:40:36] hear those sweet harbor bells chime. It
[1:40:40] would brighten my path and would banish
[1:40:43] all fears. Lord, let me look past the
[1:40:47] curtain of time. And I heard something
[1:40:50] say, "Would you like to see just beyond
[1:40:53] the curtain?" I said, "It would help me
[1:40:55] so much." And I looked in just a moment
[1:40:58] I one breath I'd come into a little
[1:41:01] place that slanted. I looked back and
[1:41:03] there I was laying on the bed and I
[1:41:06] said, "This is a strange thing." Whether
[1:41:09] it was I was in this body or out,
[1:41:11] whether it was a translation,
[1:41:13] it wasn't like any vision I ever had.
[1:41:17] And when I hit that little place, I've
[1:41:20] never seen so many people come running,
[1:41:24] screaming,
[1:41:25] "Oh, our precious brother." And I looked
[1:41:29] and young women
[1:41:32] maybe in their early 20s, 18 to 20. They
[1:41:37] were throwing their arms around me and
[1:41:40] screaming our precious brother. Here
[1:41:43] come young man
[1:41:46] in the brilliance of young manhood.
[1:41:50] And their eyes glistening and looking
[1:41:52] like stars on a darkened night. their
[1:41:56] teeth as white as pearl. And they were
[1:42:00] screaming and grabbing me and screaming,
[1:42:03] "Oh, our precious brother." And I
[1:42:07] stopped and I looked and I was young. I
[1:42:11] looked back at my old body laying there
[1:42:13] with my hands behind my head. There was
[1:42:15] no yesterday, no tomorrow. It was
[1:42:18] something that I I have not got the the
[1:42:22] vocabulary. I haven't got the words to
[1:42:25] say. Perfection wouldn't touch it.
[1:42:28] Superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere.
[1:42:31] It was something that I never You just
[1:42:33] have to be there. And I looked this way
[1:42:36] and that way and they were coming by the
[1:42:38] thousands. And here come hope. She said,
[1:42:42] "My precious brother. Oh, would I ever
[1:42:46] want to go back to that old carcass
[1:42:48] again?" And I heard a voice then that
[1:42:51] spoke to me that was in the room said,
[1:42:53] "This is what you preach was the Holy
[1:42:56] Ghost.
[1:42:57] This is perfect love and nothing can
[1:43:01] enter here without it. I am more
[1:43:05] determined than ever in my life that it
[1:43:08] takes perfect love to enter there."
[1:43:11] There was no jealousy. There was no
[1:43:13] tiredness. There was no death. Sickness
[1:43:17] could never end there. Mortality could
[1:43:19] never make you old. They could not cry.
[1:43:22] It was just one joy. Oh my precious
[1:43:25] brethren. And they took me up and set me
[1:43:27] up on a great big high place. And I
[1:43:29] said, "Oh, I shouldn't sit up here." And
[1:43:31] here come women and man from both sides
[1:43:34] just in their bloom of youth screaming.
[1:43:37] And one woman was standing there and she
[1:43:40] screamed, "Oh my precious brother. Oh,
[1:43:45] we are so happy. to see you here. I
[1:43:47] said, I don't understand this. And then
[1:43:50] that voice that was speaking from above
[1:43:52] me said, you know, it is written in the
[1:43:54] Bible that the prophets were gathered
[1:43:57] with their people. And I said, yes, I
[1:44:00] remember that in the scriptures. Said,
[1:44:03] but this is when you were gathered with
[1:44:05] your people. I said, but I there's a
[1:44:09] millions. There's not that many
[1:44:10] Brandhams.
[1:44:12] And that voice said, "They're not
[1:44:13] randoms.
[1:44:15] Them's your converts."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; That's the ones that you've led to the
[1:44:21] Lord. And said, "Some of them women
[1:44:23] there, you think it's so beautiful.
[1:44:25] We're better than 90 years old when you
[1:44:28] led them to the Lord. No wonder they're
[1:44:30] screaming our precious brother." And
[1:44:33] they screamed all at once that if you
[1:44:35] hadn't went, we wouldn't be here. I
[1:44:38] said, "Oh, where is Jesus? I want to see
[1:44:42] him so bad. They said, "Now he's just a
[1:44:46] little higher." Right up that way. Said,
[1:44:49] "Someday he will come to you." He said,
[1:44:52] "You were sent for a leader. And God
[1:44:55] will come and when he does, he'll judge
[1:44:57] you according to what you taught them
[1:45:00] first. Whether they go in or not, we'll
[1:45:03] go in according to your teaching." I
[1:45:06] said, "Oh, I'm so glad.
[1:45:09] If Paul does he have to stand like this?
[1:45:11] Does Peter have to stand like this? Yes.
[1:45:15] I said then I preached every word that
[1:45:18] they preached. I never did it from one
[1:45:21] side to the other. Were they baptized in
[1:45:23] the name of Jesus Christ? I did too.
[1:45:25] Were they taught the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:27] Ghost? I did too. Whatever they taught,
[1:45:29] I did too. And then people screamed and
[1:45:32] said, "We know that and we know we're
[1:45:34] going with you someday back to earth."
[1:45:37] said, "Jesus will come and you'll be
[1:45:40] judged according to the word that you
[1:45:42] preached us."
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; I remember that night I'd seen a preview
[1:45:48] of the bride. I stood there and seen a
[1:45:50] beautiful little ladies just correctly
[1:45:52] dressed and thing. I heard it coming up
[1:45:54] the the churches coming up from this
[1:45:56] other side. There come the Asian church.
[1:45:58] Oh, you talk about filth. Here come the
[1:46:01] European church. Oh my. And then I heard
[1:46:04] a rock and roll coming and it was Miss
[1:46:07] America the church. And she didn't even
[1:46:09] have on any clothes. She had papers like
[1:46:11] newspapers great hold in front of her
[1:46:14] dancing by rock and roll. Miss America
[1:46:17] the church. I stood there in his
[1:46:19] presence. I thought oh God as a minister
[1:46:21] that that's the best we could do. And
[1:46:22] when she passed by like that I turned my
[1:46:24] head to weeping like that. I said I I
[1:46:26] couldn't standing there him stand there
[1:46:27] and me know that me a minister of the
[1:46:29] church and that's what I'd produce for
[1:46:31] him. I said, "Oh, God, I can't look at
[1:46:33] it. Let me die. Let me let me fade
[1:46:36] away." Every time one of them would
[1:46:37] come, they go out to a certain place and
[1:46:38] drop off and I just hear the sound of it
[1:46:40] as it went away.
[1:46:42] And then I heard something like an
[1:46:44] onward Christian soldier. And I look,
[1:46:46] here come that sainted bunch of little
[1:46:48] girls just back the way it was, all
[1:46:50] correctly dressed, their hair hanging
[1:46:52] way down in their back, smooth, clean,
[1:46:54] marching like this to the step of the
[1:46:56] gospel. She was a word. It looked like
[1:47:00] one out of every nation I was looking at
[1:47:02] as they passed by and seeing them pass
[1:47:04] by. Instead of going down, they started
[1:47:06] going up. I noticed one of them trying
[1:47:08] two or three of them trying to get out
[1:47:09] of line. I scream, "Stay in line." And
[1:47:12] the vision left me and I was standing in
[1:47:13] this room screaming, "Stay in line." She
[1:47:15] has to be molded and made into the image
[1:47:18] of Christ. And Christ is the word.
