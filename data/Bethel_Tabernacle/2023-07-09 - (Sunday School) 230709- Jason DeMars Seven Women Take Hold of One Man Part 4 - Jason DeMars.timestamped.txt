[0:00] foreign
[0:02] everyone God bless you
[0:04] Let's uh let's stand and read the
[0:06] scripture
[0:08] continuing on the subject of
[0:11] seven women take hold of one man we're
[0:13] going to look at
[0:15] Isaiah 4
[0:18] is one and two
[0:24] and in that day seven women shall take
[0:27] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[0:28] own bread and wear our own apparel only
[0:31] let us be called by thy name to take
[0:33] away our reproach in that day shall the
[0:36] branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[0:38] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[0:39] shall be excellent and comely for them
[0:42] that are escaped of Israel let's pray
[0:45] Heavenly Father we want to dedicate this
[0:47] time to you Lord and For Your Glory we
[0:50] ask that your Holy Spirit would come and
[0:51] take your word
[0:52] and make it alive in our hearts father
[0:54] we we just commit ourselves to you
[0:56] commit the Sunday school and the service
[0:58] to You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus
[1:00] name amen God bless you can be seated
[1:05] so I'm not gonna
[1:08] take the extra time to go into this
[1:11] we've done that in the first three times
[1:12] so
[1:14] um skipping past that we read Proverbs
[1:17] 31
[1:19] um to finish and made some few comments
[1:22] about that and I'm not going to read it
[1:25] again
[1:25] but I'm just going to bring some bullet
[1:28] points
[1:29] forward from
[1:31] this and I think
[1:34] you know this is the virtuous woman that
[1:37] the Bible is speaking about it's giving
[1:38] it's giving a a picture of her character
[1:42] her attitude and her approach towards
[1:44] her family
[1:46] um and it isn't it isn't necessarily to
[1:49] say Hey you gotta I mean run all kinds
[1:52] of small businesses out of your home and
[1:54] this things but but but the idea is the
[1:57] character that goes behind all of this
[2:00] and the attitude that's behind all of it
[2:02] that goats goes towards the family young
[2:05] men this is who you should be looking
[2:06] for in a spouse young ladies this is
[2:09] what you should be preparing yourself
[2:10] for
[2:11] you know people that are that are uh you
[2:14] know in different stages of life and
[2:17] you're experiencing salvation maybe in
[2:20] your 20s or 30s young ladies this is
[2:22] what the Holy Spirit wants to shape you
[2:24] and mold you into right and and there's
[2:28] so much more but this is this is
[2:30] obviously the picture of in relation to
[2:33] your family
[2:35] to your children to your husband so The
[2:37] Virtuous Woman She's trustworthy
[2:40] it says she seeks wool and flax in other
[2:42] words she's she's planning and providing
[2:45] uh for the future she willingly works
[2:48] with her hands
[2:50] she plans ahead and provides a variety
[2:53] of foods for her household she Rises
[2:56] early in the morning to prepare a meal
[2:58] for the family she works along with her
[3:00] husband to exp expand the household
[3:02] business says she considers a field
[3:05] buys it plants plants a Vineyard
[3:09] she inspects the things her household is
[3:11] producing and will do what it takes to
[3:12] make sure that it is quality she works
[3:15] on providing clothing for her family she
[3:17] has a heart to provide for the poor she
[3:20] doesn't fear the various seasons of life
[3:22] because she makes Provisions for them
[3:24] and she trusts God God through them she
[3:27] prospers from hard work and so does her
[3:29] family her husband is honored because of
[3:32] her
[3:33] she not only supplies for the needs of
[3:35] her family she makes additional
[3:36] materials and sells them she's strong
[3:39] strong and honorable woman she is wise
[3:42] and kind she is not idle or lazy her
[3:45] focus is not on outward Beauty and charm
[3:48] but on the character produced by the
[3:51] fear of the Lord now you read that and
[3:53] go
[3:54] that's very intimidating again the point
[3:58] is not that you need to do follow all
[4:01] these points exactly if you if you did
[4:03] God bless you the point is the character
[4:06] and the attitude and the heart that is
[4:09] behind each of these things that that
[4:12] character and that heart towards your
[4:13] family that's what God wants to shape
[4:16] into a Godly lady
[4:20] so
[4:22] looking at this and you say well the
[4:24] times were very different when we're
[4:26] talking about the Proverbs 31 Woman they
[4:30] were the society was different the
[4:32] culture was different
[4:35] correct it was that's then that's the
[4:39] point that's why I'm trying to say the
[4:40] point I'm making is it's about the
[4:42] character that's behind each of these
[4:44] points it's a proverb right
[4:47] it's a proverb so it's it's it's
[4:48] painting a picture for you of what
[4:53] wisdom and godliness looks like I mean
[4:57] you you can go to the scriptures in
[5:00] Proverbs and you can see one verse
[5:01] answer a fool according to his folly
[5:03] next verse answer not a fool according
[5:05] to his folly you say that's a direct
[5:07] contradiction the Bible is contradicting
[5:09] itself no
[5:11] no it's a proverb and it's it's showing
[5:14] that there are circumstances where you
[5:16] don't answer a fool according to his
[5:18] folly and there are circumstances that
[5:20] you should
[5:21] right because it's speaking about
[5:24] character and there's thousands of
[5:25] different
[5:27] circumstances and situations where these
[5:29] things can can line up and the same
[5:31] thing goes for when we're looking at The
[5:33] Virtuous women there's lots of different
[5:35] circumstances but the characteristics of
[5:38] the woman that come from these basic
[5:40] premises are there as principles for us
[5:44] to follow and to go through so cultures
[5:47] do change but the word of God does not
[5:48] change and the character of Christ
[5:51] does not change
[5:52] you know we started out you know most
[5:55] the majority of history is agrarian
[5:57] societies divided into land owners and
[6:01] lower classes
[6:03] that's basically what the world was up
[6:05] until the Industrial Revolution in the
[6:08] 1700s
[6:10] before before the Industrial Revolution
[6:12] the husbands and wives roles were clear
[6:16] obvious Undisputed
[6:18] you know today's day and age uh if we
[6:22] suddenly were forced back into
[6:25] we have to survive
[6:27] no one's going around saying I think I'm
[6:30] a woman
[6:31] well I think I'm a man
[6:33] because they're not they're not worried
[6:35] about such nonsense they're worried
[6:37] about simply I am this I must survive
[6:41] I have I have to do these things I need
[6:44] a man's help the man says I need a
[6:46] woman's help right there's there's no
[6:49] there's no need to have disputes about
[6:51] this now in Upper classes if you look at
[6:54] upper classes in in throughout Europe
[6:57] and and the culture that they had within
[6:59] the the aristocracy what was it all
[7:03] kinds of perversion all kinds of sexual
[7:05] perversions happening why because again
[7:08] the roles were only forced on them
[7:11] because all they did was live off the
[7:13] work of other people right they lived
[7:16] off the work of the other people and
[7:17] what their land could produce so the
[7:19] roles were were used and were there
[7:22] because of what Society looked at Judea
[7:26] judeo-christian values nevertheless they
[7:28] had all kinds of perversion there
[7:30] because of that very reason is
[7:34] they sat lazy on the rear ends other
[7:37] people working for them
[7:39] right and so that's what almost
[7:41] everybody all of us are doing that very
[7:44] few people work with their hands in
[7:47] today's society the majority in America
[7:50] the majority of society has a easy lazy
[7:53] job and whether you're a man or woman
[7:55] hardly matters
[7:58] so and that's say that was Satan's goal
[8:02] and intention with all of these things
[8:04] science civilization and education
[8:08] of this world are all of the devil now
[8:11] that doesn't mean we shouldn't seek and
[8:14] pursue wisdom from from the Bible and
[8:16] from the message of the hour that
[8:18] doesn't mean we shouldn't learn how to
[8:20] be engineers and learn how to and be the
[8:22] very best construction workers and
[8:24] engineers and photographers and etc etc
[8:27] and seek to improve ourselves that way
[8:29] that doesn't mean that but there is a
[8:32] system in this world and it should be so
[8:33] clear in brother branham's day you could
[8:35] say it was in seed form and everybody's
[8:37] going brother Branham what's the big
[8:38] deal about education and Science and
[8:41] civilization well now it's so clear it
[8:44] slaps across the face every day you wake
[8:46] up out of bed
[8:48] you know most universities are simply
[8:50] places to put forward and high schools
[8:54] and elementary schools and middle
[8:55] schools and Junior High and it's just a
[8:58] place to put forward prop communist
[9:01] perverted propaganda into young people's
[9:04] minds
[9:05] to pervert and twist their minds into
[9:08] the world's goals and and direction
[9:12] that's that's very clear
[9:14] civilization our our government
[9:17] and all that goes into the government's
[9:20] control on the world you know this is
[9:23] easy to get on a rant so Lord protect me
[9:27] the government
[9:29] same thing
[9:30] it's all together of the devil and it's
[9:34] seeking to put forward Satan's Eden
[9:39] and push forward Satan's even
[9:41] science is the same thing we don't even
[9:43] know what science is we're just supposed
[9:44] to trust it now
[9:46] science is mostly just like the oldest
[9:49] profession in the world now is whoever
[9:52] is the highest bidder that's what the
[9:54] results you'll you'll put forward it's
[9:56] not questioning things and coming to con
[9:58] and testing it and coming to conclusion
[10:00] no don't do that if you do that we'll
[10:03] cancel you and we'll say you're a
[10:05] dangerous conspiracy theorist
[10:08] that's what the world is they don't even
[10:10] and so science civilization education
[10:13] are clearly
[10:15] following Satan's program and pattern in
[10:19] order to
[10:21] combat what God is doing on the earth
[10:23] see that's that's what the devil's doing
[10:26] he's not he's not just randomly throwing
[10:29] something out he knows that God was
[10:31] going to combat his program with a bride
[10:35] that wouldn't fail
[10:37] with a bride that's going not going to
[10:40] fall like Eve fell he knew because he
[10:42] can he can read the scriptures and he
[10:45] knows them as well as we do probably
[10:46] better
[10:47] he could see that there's going to be a
[10:49] bride without spot and wrinkles so what
[10:50] does he do hundreds of years before
[10:52] that's going to come he starts a process
[10:54] he doesn't know exactly when it's going
[10:55] to come so he starts a process and what
[10:58] is that process
[10:59] oh he's going to give an industrial
[11:01] revolution you say oh that helped many
[11:03] things and that that uh that made life
[11:06] much better for everybody well it's the
[11:08] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[11:11] it's not God's perfect will it's not the
[11:13] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I'm
[11:15] sorry y'all is not God's perfect will
[11:18] it's God's permissive will
[11:21] and what does it bring it doesn't bring
[11:23] life it brings More Death these are
[11:26] principles you've heard brother Branham
[11:27] say this for years and years I'm just
[11:29] trying to to spend some time on bringing
[11:32] it out and really showing it where where
[11:34] it comes out in history
[11:36] so then you know we have the Industrial
[11:38] Revolution in the 1700s birth of
[11:40] industry and the birth of the middle
[11:42] class you say that's a wonderful thing
[11:45] more people experience Prosperity more
[11:47] people experience a good life what is a
[11:49] good life
[11:50] what is prosperity you say you're you're
[11:53] defining it from outward terms
[11:55] you're defining it from the terms that
[11:59] the world would look at it as and that's
[12:00] not God's vision
[12:03] and that's not God's purpose so the
[12:05] birth of Industry the birth of the
[12:07] middle middle class rules start out
[12:08] clear and they get muddier and muddier
[12:11] for example
[12:12] what what when industry was born do you
[12:15] think the the industrialists were
[12:18] concerned about Labor conditions
[12:21] how many people had their jaw eaten away
[12:23] from them because of mercury poisoning
[12:25] their bones eaten away and what did did
[12:28] it make the industrialists quit doing
[12:30] that no not until all the governments of
[12:33] the world said hey everybody's dying
[12:36] stop you have to stop
[12:38] you have to you can't do that anymore
[12:40] and it and and
[12:43] that's the that's the reality is the
[12:45] industrialists their purpose was money
[12:48] and it was gain and so their purpose was
[12:50] not to help the world or improve the
[12:52] world their their desire was gained and
[12:54] so you can go on and on and on and on
[12:56] about all the poisons and things that
[12:59] were put into into the world and what
[13:01] happened was
[13:02] they put women in in the working in the
[13:07] plants and they put little tiny children
[13:10] working in the plants was that good for
[13:13] the home life
[13:15] was that good for home life no
[13:18] no it was not good for home life it was
[13:21] horrible and you see the proliferation
[13:23] around the world of little children on
[13:25] the streets
[13:26] during this time period little kids no
[13:29] Mom and Dad dad's dad well they might
[13:32] have a mom and dad dad's drunk and mom's
[13:34] working all the time
[13:36] dad comes home and when when dad comes
[13:39] home he beats the Daylights out of all
[13:42] of them and this you can read about this
[13:44] history around the world this is the
[13:45] result of the Industrial Revolution
[13:48] horrible
[13:50] then next we go to the age of mass
[13:53] production
[13:55] the the
[13:56] lines are further blurred we go into
[13:59] World War II
[14:00] World War One
[14:02] and the times proceeded in World War one
[14:04] man goes off to war
[14:07] a woman has to take take his place at
[14:09] the plant
[14:10] what happens there well this goes off
[14:13] into another subject but what does woman
[14:15] do she puts on pants
[14:18] Hollywood comes about at this same time
[14:21] she puts on makeup
[14:23] she Bobs her hair because her hair is
[14:25] going to get caught in the machinery
[14:27] all these things was this God's plan
[14:31] and purpose was this what God wanted to
[14:33] accomplish
[14:35] in the world no the very time that he's
[14:38] going to call a bride and set all these
[14:42] things in order right before that the
[14:44] Devil comes on the scene and raises up a
[14:46] World War One to do what to degrade the
[14:49] woman
[14:50] you say it killed all these men it was
[14:53] it was a very purposeful attack
[14:56] on Womanhood this is what was happening
[14:59] from the very beginning it was attack on
[15:02] the family and it was attack on what it
[15:04] means to be a woman
[15:07] now we've reached its Zenith they don't
[15:10] know what a woman is they won't say what
[15:13] a woman is and if you do
[15:15] you're dangerous
[15:18] that's in this civilization that's in
[15:21] this science that's in this education
[15:23] it's Satan's Eden it's reached a Zenith
[15:28] I don't I don't foresee of a way that it
[15:31] can go further and go worse except for
[15:33] into making pedophile legal
[15:37] that's the only step that's left
[15:42] then we get after the age of mass
[15:44] production the digital Revolution now
[15:46] the lines are what lines are there
[15:49] there's no lines anymore
[15:51] it's a total perversion total
[15:54] Destruction
[15:55] annihilation of the society and the the
[15:59] values of the Christian and Jewish faith
[16:05] so then we have the three waves of
[16:07] feminism
[16:09] so first wave is promotion of equal
[16:11] contract and property rights for women
[16:13] and the opposition to chattel marriage
[16:16] and ownership of married women and their
[16:17] children by their husbands however by
[16:19] the end of the 19th century activism
[16:21] flipped it changed its focus primarily
[16:24] on gaining political power
[16:26] particularly the right of women's
[16:28] suffrage and you can go into this and
[16:30] you can argue make an argument and I
[16:32] don't want to get dragged down on this
[16:34] and say some of these things were good
[16:36] some of these things were bad we know
[16:37] what brother Branham says about women's
[16:39] right to vote
[16:41] we used to get a little bit uh
[16:43] worried when we would say that and and
[16:45] Flinch a little bit because we think
[16:47] what is everybody going to think I think
[16:49] we can now really see what brother
[16:51] Barham said this is the end result
[16:53] in our country of making uh pure
[16:56] democracy where anybody can vote men can
[17:00] vote women can vote this country was
[17:02] founded it was supposed to be
[17:03] the head of a household that owned
[17:05] property could vote
[17:07] right then what did it become anybody
[17:11] can vote and when when you get a pure
[17:13] democracy what's the result is chaos
[17:15] utter chaos it's always been that way
[17:18] France is a little bit ahead of us look
[17:20] what France is resulting in
[17:23] it won't be long that we're we'll be in
[17:25] the same
[17:26] nonsense situation liberal democracy
[17:29] that's the worst form of government in
[17:32] many ways
[17:34] and so again I'm getting I'm going out
[17:37] I'm trying not to go too far off but you
[17:39] see I believe brother branham's point is
[17:41] exactly right the woman gets the vote
[17:43] and it brings it to a place in our
[17:45] country not that women are unintelligent
[17:47] that's not what's being said
[17:49] that's the opposite of what's being said
[17:51] it's it's talking about God's program
[17:54] this can we can go on and on about this
[17:57] topic from a logical scriptural
[18:00] standpoint Etc I'm just going to leave
[18:02] it there
[18:04] second wave of feminism is women's
[18:06] Liberation challenging the cultural and
[18:08] legal validity of the patriarchy and
[18:10] social and sexual hierarchies used to
[18:12] control and limit the legal and physical
[18:14] independence of women in society
[18:18] again what what is what is happening
[18:20] here is it's pushing against God's word
[18:24] you know you say it you just go out and
[18:27] yell patriarchy in the public and my
[18:30] goodness everybody's gonna lose their
[18:32] minds but it's exactly the right way
[18:34] it's exactly the scriptural way man is
[18:37] the head Adam was formed first then Eve
[18:41] right God's original intention
[18:44] though they were co-equal they had two
[18:46] different purposes Man was created to be
[18:49] a leader
[18:51] to take the hits to love to serve to
[18:54] provide
[18:57] the woman was created to be
[19:01] an influencer and a helper in this
[19:04] Vision in this process that God has
[19:09] the third wave of feminism is freedom of
[19:11] sexual and bodily expression fighting
[19:13] sexual harassment and continued
[19:15] expression of women's rights by
[19:16] dismantling any gender roles whatsoever
[19:19] yep that's the purpose egalitarianism
[19:22] they wanted everything
[19:25] right there
[19:27] men and women are exactly the same we
[19:30] see the absurdity when we got these men
[19:32] going into women's sports and their
[19:34] horrible athletes I've repeated this
[19:37] every time I think I've spoke but
[19:39] on this they're horrible athletes and
[19:42] they go to these Elite women athletes
[19:44] and guess what happens they demolish
[19:46] them easily why because man is stronger
[19:49] woman is a weaker vessel
[19:51] it doesn't say she's a dumber vessel so
[19:54] she's a weaker vessel her bodily she's
[19:56] weaker
[19:58] it's that's obvious to anyone with
[20:00] common sense but this is what this is
[20:03] the result and the process and the
[20:05] program that Satan had when he started
[20:09] his feminism
[20:11] when he started the changing of society
[20:14] and the development of technology that
[20:16] was his goal let's banish all gender
[20:19] roles and all we can go into how how
[20:21] this is impacted on the church
[20:24] so here's the reality men and equal men
[20:28] and women are equal but they're not the
[20:30] same and they don't have the same role
[20:32] what men and women are different as at
[20:34] the cellular level every cell is marked
[20:36] as either male or female men have denser
[20:39] bones larger hands greater muscle mass
[20:41] men tend to be more aggressive and as a
[20:43] result have a greater tendency to be
[20:45] attracted to conflict and competition
[20:47] and thus leadership women tend to be
[20:49] attracted to nurture nurturing and
[20:51] relationship building
[20:53] then tend to compartmentalize women tend
[20:55] to connect manner wired to lead women
[20:58] are wired to nurture and I would say
[21:00] influence
[21:03] First Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that
[21:06] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[21:07] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[21:10] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[21:12] nor effeminate
[21:14] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[21:19] so here we see this term effeminate
[21:23] culture has been feminized
[21:26] the portrait of man is self-centered
[21:28] dopes led by wise powerful women painted
[21:31] by Hollywood the deadening of Manliness
[21:34] from video game addiction watching being
[21:37] addicted to watching sports and the
[21:39] proliferation of estrogens in food water
[21:41] and clothing
[21:43] all these things have led to the
[21:45] feminization of our culture
[21:47] brother Branham says there's a
[21:48] perversion in the food supply
[21:51] see where am I at I think I can get
[21:54] through this but it's gonna I'm gonna
[21:55] have to go fast
[21:57] brother Jason mentioned it and I thought
[21:58] man he's he's going into my material
[22:01] already for Sunday school last week he
[22:03] said did you read this this is from uh
[22:05] and knoweth it not did you read this
[22:08] here this month's Readers Digest that
[22:09] men and women of this day little girls
[22:11] from 20 25 years old is in menopause
[22:13] that you go through the change of life
[22:15] in the middle age of life according to
[22:16] science between 20 and 25 it used to be
[22:19] around 30 or 35 in my age in my mother's
[22:21] age a woman never struck menopause still
[22:24] she was 40 or 45 what is it it's through
[22:26] science and the food and the hybrids
[22:28] it's perverted the whole human body
[22:30] totally become a bunch of a massive
[22:32] corruption well if the physical being
[22:34] corrupted isn't the brain cell in that
[22:36] physical being
[22:37] hmm
[22:39] and in thirst he says but the way they
[22:41] are on the street today haircut like a
[22:42] man wearing men's clothes and then men
[22:44] turn around wearing women's clothes and
[22:46] a haircut like a woman see it's a
[22:47] perversion the whole thing your food is
[22:49] perverted your life is perverted your
[22:51] thirst perverted your desire is
[22:53] perverted it's a day of perversion
[23:00] so
[23:02] this is just one thing there's many
[23:03] things brother Brandon mentions vitamins
[23:05] and minerals I'm just going to mention
[23:07] this because it's direct to me it's
[23:08] directly connected to this topic
[23:11] estrogen is everywhere
[23:13] soy is a plant estrogen so it isn't
[23:16] every snack so he's in baby formula soy
[23:19] is in vegetable oil it's in in vegetable
[23:22] oils in every snack it seems like
[23:25] it's in meat and dairy Productions it's
[23:27] in tap water in bottled water BPA it's
[23:29] the same thing it's in Plastics
[23:31] phthalates and lotion makeup laundry
[23:32] Products plastic wrap
[23:34] birth control pills are in our water
[23:37] supply
[23:40] when when there's excess estrogen
[23:43] testosterone is suppressed
[23:47] so think about that
[23:49] when suppressed from Young ages of
[23:52] development
[23:53] it leads to the feminization of boys
[23:59] I hate talking about this with a doctor
[24:00] in front of me
[24:01] [Laughter]
[24:04] but it is this is absolutely the truth
[24:06] what you
[24:08] whether you how old you are how young
[24:10] you are whatever you are when when you
[24:14] consume too much estrogen
[24:17] your testosterone levels immediately are
[24:19] going to lower do you think this is a
[24:21] mistake
[24:23] do you think that the devil didn't know
[24:25] what he was doing
[24:27] over the past 50 years human sperm
[24:30] counts appear to have fallen by more
[24:32] than 50 percent around the globe
[24:34] according to an updated review of
[24:36] medical literature
[24:38] it brings an increased risk of breast
[24:40] and cervical cancer weight gain fibroids
[24:44] in the uterus fatigue
[24:46] Etc in large breasts in men high blood
[24:49] pressure blood clots all these things
[24:51] it's it's it's absolutely
[24:55] a perversion
[24:57] and this this is an attack I mean look
[24:59] at what the Satan has attacked he's
[25:00] attacked the civilization
[25:03] at the very courtroom at the very very
[25:06] Foundation he's attacked education at
[25:09] the very Foundation
[25:10] he's attacked science at the very
[25:13] Foundation he's attacked the food supply
[25:15] at the very foundation and he's put the
[25:18] most powerful government on the on the
[25:21] planet in control of most of the food
[25:24] supply and the rules of food it's no
[25:26] wonder that when I go overseas on a
[25:28] mission strip and start eating fast food
[25:31] or anything and I immediately start to
[25:34] feel better
[25:36] fast food
[25:38] Popeyes I can't eat Popeyes here but I
[25:42] go overseas and I can eat it because I I
[25:44] have it I have all kinds of different
[25:46] allergies when I and they are all
[25:49] inflamed when I eat Popeyes here but
[25:51] when I go over there no problem I mean I
[25:53] get fatter when I eat Popeyes but
[25:57] it'll make me sick
[26:01] you see what I'm saying so this this
[26:02] perversion in all of these different
[26:04] areas that the devil has placed there is
[26:08] for this purpose is to attack
[26:11] the home and he knows if he destroys
[26:13] Womanhood
[26:15] he destroys the whole thing
[26:18] if a woman goes out and she's immodest
[26:21] and she dresss immodestly and a man's
[26:24] just gonna follow along this nonsense if
[26:27] you don't have the Holy Ghost and he's
[26:29] going to go along and what's going to be
[26:30] what's going to results be
[26:32] well I don't want to speak too plain but
[26:34] but the reality is it's going to destroy
[26:37] the home and there's not even going to
[26:40] be a home
[26:41] left my brother teaches in
[26:45] a public school
[26:46] almost all the kids have broken homes
[26:51] almost all the kids he says it's a
[26:54] wonder that they can even show up to
[26:55] class
[26:57] let alone
[26:59] get a good grade
[27:02] and there's no control he can't he my
[27:04] bro my brother is in a fairly I'm sure
[27:08] he's not listening but
[27:10] he's a it can be an intimidating person
[27:12] he cannot control one of them kids
[27:14] that's the society this is what they're
[27:16] being trained to this is what they're
[27:17] raised up in my brother is 6'2 and he's
[27:21] a Stern person and not one of those kids
[27:23] will listen to a word that he says he
[27:26] just has to take roll call the entire
[27:28] class
[27:29] and that's not just his school that's
[27:31] many many teachers and many many places
[27:33] if they can just be alive by the end of
[27:36] the day
[27:37] they're happy
[27:39] they can't teach kids aren't learning
[27:42] you go on and you you you ask in studies
[27:46] they don't even know who America was
[27:48] fighting in World War II they don't even
[27:49] know
[27:50] who Adolf Hitler was in fact they don't
[27:53] even know who the president is
[27:55] many times or the LA the the last
[27:57] president or you think what planet are
[28:00] you on what
[28:02] why would you think they could learn
[28:03] anything in this situation the one thing
[28:06] that they learn is the perversion of
[28:09] this world that's all that they know
[28:11] they can tell you there's no such thing
[28:12] as gender and etc etc and you can choose
[28:16] whatever you want why because that's
[28:17] what they're pumped with everywhere then
[28:19] they're pumped with the the the filth
[28:21] and the food supply which takes them
[28:24] towards feminization and all of these
[28:26] perversions in this world
[28:28] but but guess what the end end story is
[28:31] that God is is going to have a bride
[28:34] and through all this mess she's going to
[28:37] be perfected
[28:39] the church through the through the
[28:41] perversion of the church world you see
[28:43] the perversion of this world
[28:46] it's also reflected in the perversion of
[28:49] the denominational programs and systems
[28:51] of this world it's exactly reflected in
[28:53] what what is it conservativism
[28:56] what is what is being a conservative
[28:58] it's called just being a little bit
[29:00] behind the Liberals
[29:02] and that's what our churches are
[29:04] that's what our denominational systems
[29:06] and programs are they're just a little
[29:08] bit behind the liberal churches that
[29:11] have totally embraced perversions
[29:14] let's stand
[29:22] I hate to bring it out on the negative
[29:24] side like this but I think it's
[29:26] important to understand that
[29:28] besides all this
[29:30] he's perfecting a bride
