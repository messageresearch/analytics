this evening just want to greet you tonight this Wednesday night no place I'd rather be amen than in the Lord's House uh let's just turn right into the word tonight we're going to go into 1 Corinthians 14: 8 brother Jason I was telling him in the back he texted me the other day about taking the service just throw this here thanks and uh got a little nervous because it's been a little while since I preached and so I wasn't sure if I remembered how but Lord's faithful amen sermon been building on my heart for a little while anyway so pray it'll be a blessing tonight we're just going to uh read in verses 8 1 Corinthians 14 and verses 8 just say Amen if you got it just one verse and it says for if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle and then if you want to turn in your Bibles to Leviticus chapter 25 Leviticus 25 we're going to read up until until the 13th verse and then I'm going to read a little bit more but I'll have you be seated for that so Leviticus 25 and: 1 and it says and the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount Si saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six years shalt thou sow thy field and six years shalt thou prune thy Vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord Thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy Vineyard that which groweth of it of its own accord of thy Harvest Thou shalt not reap neither gather The Grapes of thy Vine undressed for it is a year of rest unto the land and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat and thou shalt number seven Sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of seven seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 4 and9 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land amen and ye shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you ye shall not seow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy Vine and dress for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this Jubilee shall you return every man unto his possession let's go before the Lord Heavenly Father we just thank you for the reading of your word this evening Lord father we're just grateful that you're the one that's going to speak to us Lord we just pray you could anoint our lips father anoint our ears to hear father help me just get out of the way father and just take this thought that you've laid My Heart Lord and deliver it to your people we love you we commit this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen may the Lord bless you as you take your seats this evening so I just want to catch a few more uh verses of scripture um and if thou sh and if thou sell Thy Neighbor or buyest ought of thy neighbor's land verses 14 you shall not oppress one another according to the number of years after the Jubilee Thou shalt buy of thy neighbor and according unto the number of years of the fruit you shall sell unto thee according to the multitude of years Thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years Thou shalt diminish the diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruit do he sell unto thee you shall not therefore oppress one another but Thou shalt fear thy God for I am the Lord your God wherefore you shall do my statutes and keep my command and my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land in safety and the land shall yield her fruit and you shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety and if you shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not seow nor Gather in our increase then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years and you shall seow the eighth year and eat of it of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and so Jers with me and in all the land of your possessions shall you make a great Redemption for the land so I wanted to catch those verses because the Lord thanks brother the Lord set in order these things to take place here around the time of what the scripture would refer to as the time of Jubilee and as we read the Lord said about every seven years there would be a time of rest unto the land as we read it would be a time where there would be no seeds planted in The Vineyards and there would be know seeds planted in the fields and and if you think about what that meant that this would have to be a time of great faith because he gave this command and this command was going to interrupt their entire way of life but what was amazing was that it was going to be a time of of dependence upon God and upon his Provisions amen and Matthew Henry writes this in a commentary I was reading all labor was to cease in the seventh year as much as daily labor on the seventh day these statutes tell us to beware of covetes for a man's life consists not in the abundance of his possessions we are to exercise willing dependence on God's Providence for our support to consider ourselves the Lord's tenants or stewards and to use our possessions accordingly so see I believe God said recognized that he needed to set up a set up in time a time to order to ensure that his people would be mind that this wasn't their land that they were his people and that he was their God Amen that he was their provider and and you know as good as they may have gotten at what they did as good as as good as they were at farming or as good as they were at their ability at that time it didn't matter there was the everybody was equal on the playing field there you have to stop at this time and rest amen because what happens in in our human tendency is we we tend to want to try to be independent amen we as we grow in life and that's a natural thing but it should never be natural to be independent from God Amen he says in verse 23 that they were sojourners and strangers there you know and one of the provisions that I thought was incredible that he promised was that in the previous year which was the sixth year he said that I'm going to command all of my blessings upon you this is good bro by the way and it shall bring forth fruit for three years so God anticipated they didn't even ask the question he said when they asked the question God anticipated that they were going to ask that question what are we supposed to eat and do because this is the work of our hands this is how we eat this is how we live what are we supposed to do and God had set in order a plan and he always does he always sets in order a plan what shall we eat the seventh year and some notes I read on that verse says thus many Christians and I want you to catch this now there many Christians anticipate evils questioning what they shall do and fearing to proceed in the way of Duty because of that questioning and so sometimes God will set things in order and he won't tell you why he won't he won't tell you the the the sequence of events because he needs you to be dependent upon Him amen we are to be dependent upon God and I believe sometimes what can begin to happen in our life is that we begin to get so used to to sewing crops in our own field amen we get to be so dependent on the things that we possess on our income or or our way of living rather than on God and on his Provisions amen can I get an amen this morning and then when a time comes that God has ordained a rest in your life or or he's ordained a blessing in your life we we're not we're not exactly sure because we've gotten so used to doing things of ourself amen so sometimes he sets things in order to take place so that you can take a rest and to be dependent upon him amen sometimes you can just you we don't want to miss it and you know we can be so anxious or just so worried about what we're supposed to do during that time amen and I need to be reminded of this just as much as anybody else sometimes I get so anxious about the next step and the next step I'm a planner I like to plan I like to know I like to do these things but God needs to you to take a step back and say I am your provider amen how are we going to survive but you'll miss what will happen is is if you find yourself in that place you're going to miss the entire the entire premise of what he wanted you to do is rest is rest in his dependence amen God promised that he would Supply amen that promise is still good today amen we're going to catch a quote in a few minutes on this that the prophet makes and it's along those line lines that really struck me but we read about how God spoke to Moses and he said just to set a little Foundation this this evening he spoke to Moses and he said declare to my people that after seven sabbaths after seven times of them doing this and trusting my commands and watching my word come to pass and being obedient there was going to be something that took place so after seven sabbaths after 49 years there would be something which they which scripture refers to as this Year of Jubilee and you know the the literal translation for that word in Hebrew is actually Ram's Horn so the Year of Jubilee would be the year of the sounding of the Ram's Horn the the Horn of a ram W was how they made these trumpets in the days of the Old Testament amen and if you search the scriptures and you watch how how it would be the Lord's Supernatural Provisions that he would create a ram in the wilderness you remember when Abraham had a need amen he created a ram and it was by his horn that he was caught in the thickets amen and it was by that provision that God provided a sacrifice amen and it was by that provision that he always intended to provide a sacrifice it was by the Ram's Horn Hallelujah and he said he said to to Abraham he said take Isaac up and and sacrifice him yet Abraham's Faith declared and and we know this but Abraham's Faith declared that we both him and my son will return amen and it was at that appointed time that Abraham's faith in God caused a ram to get stuck in a Thicket amen and that would be the very thing that Abraham needed to save his son at that point and I love I love how scripture makes it so specifically clear that it was the horn of the ram that got caught in the thicket amen Genesis 2213 and just catching some types here this evening you know and it was that very spot in the mountain is where Abraham was so inspired that he dedicated that place and we know it to be called Jehovah drra amen my provider for God hath provided a sacrifice and it was always to point to Christ the great sacrifice amen he provided himself a sacrifice for you amen yes amen you know we read of another place in scripture there Ezekiel chapter 33 how the blowing of a trumpet would actually be a warning sign Ezekiel 33 that whosoever heareth the sound of a trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head am he heard the sound of a trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul so so what we see in Ezekiel that is if you hear the sound of a trumpet but you didn't take notice it could be the sound of an impending doom for you but if you took notice of the sound of the Horn of the trumpet then it could save your soul amen so for one people it's a a sign of impending judgment but for another people it's a sign of warning and a sign of Victory amen you know and back there in Leviticus scripture says that it was going to be on the 10th day of the seventh month and what what I found that was so incredible about this specific time was that after this time it actually fell on a year that followed a Sabbath amen and so the law of the Sabbath year was still in play so there was a law of Sabbath that said you need to take a rest for an entire year and then upon the seventh time that that happened there would be another year of rest and it would be called the land the the the time of the Jubilee so this would be multiple years of rest and multiple years of trust so God had provided all the way back in Leviticus at the start of that scripture he said that I'm going to provide and it's going to it's going to bring fruit for us for three years amen there was a purpose in doing that even though he didn't need fruit for 3 years at the beginning he needed it because at the seventh time it would happen there would be need for that amen it was it would be again a time set apart for you and and and you will observe the same statute set about in the Sabbath year according to the law so you had the same you had the same statutes you you you were to take a rest and it would be another year where you wouldn't farm and crop and you wouldn't Harvest but this time it would be for a different reason you know and I thought about just how Supernatural that was in those times where this again this was their way of life and now now after doing that for so many years there was a command by this law to take not just one but two years and not do a certain thing and God's promise would to be provide for their needs amen you know and I thought about how the amazing thing is is he didn't he doesn't just give commands and he does I'm just speaking spiritually tonight he doesn't just give these commands and he doesn't and not have a plan in order amen he always has a plan set in order for whatever tells you to do amen you may not always know the plan but he has a plan amen and the Bible writes that you shall eat the increase there of the of the field amen and you shall you know and I thought maybe maybe it was because maybe that would be mindful and maybe store up some years of plenty you know he he always he always tells he always tells a certain portion enough to where you know what you need to do but maybe not the next step amen and one commentator wrote how two years in succession would have to be a serious test of faith because they were called upon to trust totally in God and acknowledge in a profound way that he was the provider of the basic necessities of life amen you know and just so for a simple concept of faith in this subject tonight it's the Simplicity of learning to trust God for your Provisions you know and we can't you can't allow yourselves to get so so reliant on on the working of your own hands that you lose dependence upon God Amen you know I so I put some thought into this this term tonight and so I wanted to to to bring this out faith in our life should become habitual it should be a habit amen and I want you to listen to this definition tonight to be habitual means a behavior that is repeated regularly often unconsciously or completely involuntary amen that should be faith in our life it should be come it should come to a point where it's habitual in your life where where it just happens where it's a part of you amen you don't that God doesn't have to to push you or urge you to do it you just do it because it's in you to do it amen amen and I I love how the prophet always makes things so simple um you know and I've made this statement before I'm going to read this quote in just a minute but I've made the statement here before but it's just repeating a concept that the prophet makes over and and over and over again Faith isn't some far-reaching unattainable thing amen it's never been that way it's a tangible substance amen that Believers can grab a hold of regardless of your past failures or your past faults amen it's the Simplicity of trusting God and trusting in what he says which means trusting in his word amen and believing his word brother Brandon picks this up in a CLE uh sermon titled the Inside Man 1953 and he's talking about when Jesus um passes that fig tree amen you remember the story he passes that fig tree and he was seeing how it was bearing no fruit so he spoke to it and and Jesus had spoke to that tree and then he and then he walks away and the next morning they walk past that tree on their way somewhere else and Peter takes notice of it and asks God about it and Jesus answered and said have faith in God so it was it was a lesson on faith and and in the moment and I wanted to I wanted you to catch this in the moment that Jesus spoke to that tree life went out of it amen but Peter didn't take notice of it until the next morning and sometimes in your life when you have something in your heart God places to tell you to do if you have faith and it's a revelation from God the moment that you speak it as long as it's a revelation in his word it's going to come to pass you may not take notice of it right away but it doesn't mean it didn't happen amen hallelujah brother benam says this he says as I read it now keep these things on mind what I've told you keep them on mind see Jesus passed by a tree he's talking about the story he looked on it there was no fruit on it and he said no man eateth from off of you from henceforth so he went up onto Jerusalem of course they was fussing at him up there and he couldn't stand that so there was the wrong kind of Atmosphere for him so he moved out and went on back down he come off the off the mountain the next morning and as they passed by at about 11:00 in the day I suppose Peter looked at the tree and he said say notice said you just said that yesterday and that tree is dead from The Roots see it dried up why Jesus said have faith in God is that right for verily I say unto you if you not if I if you shall say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt it'll obey you it have to it have to do what you say if you didn't doubt it now you believe it up here and I want you to catch this next statement he makes he says now let's get this subconscious believing it too and when the sub Sub Conscious and the conscious get in harmony with God then it'll happen amen when the subconscious and the conscious when the Inside Man and the outside man get in harmony with with each other then you say to this mountain that's why God said that and and and if you go on and read I wanted to read this from Matthew 19 the Amplified version and he said so when the disciples saw it they were astonished and asked how is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once and Jesus replied to them I assure you most solemnly to say to you if you have faith and I wanted to pick the Amplified because it said if you have faith a personal trust and confidence in me and do not doubt or allow yourself and catch this or allow yourself to be drawn in two directions you will not only do what was done to the Fig Tree but even if you say to this mountain be taken up and thrown into the sea it will happen if God wills it amen and whatever you ask for in prayer believing you will receive amen if you have faith a personal trust and confidence in me it says and don't doubt amen or even allow yourself to be drawn in two directions like that scripture says so he spoke to the tree and Peter didn't notice it but it was at that moment that God's that God spoke to it that something happened so what I'm trying to get at is Faith isn't some kind of workup amen Faith isn't Faith isn't you trying to up something faith is trusting God in a simplistic Manner and you speaking to something and it's going to come to pass because you believe it amen it's a simple belief in God and even if something takes a little while in your life to manifest or to notice sometimes the moment that you're inspired with the word from God and you take it at his word take him at his word it's come to pass amen Jesus didn't Wonder Jesus didn't wonder whether or not his word was going to come to pass amen he used that you know Jesus used that moment as a teachable moment to Peter he to tell him no all you got to do is is you just got to believe it I spoke to it and believed it he believed it but God used that as a moment to tell Peter because Peter was going to do great things amen amen and the pro the problem with us and I that really struck me because the problem with us so many times is that we allow ourselves to be drawn into two directions just like that verse reads amen we believe and you know we think we have this conscious Faith but the problem is is that it's not operating in our subconscious and brother brandham said it so beautifully in that quote that there's a lack of Harmony there amen and and you remember that word I said earlier with habit you know we have to allow Faith to become habitual common every day practiced regularly so being a Believer you know you feed the inner man with the word amen and the word changes the way you think it changes the way you act it changes the way you live amen you know and so we hear the word preached and and we may believe it but then we go out and we live in a society that doesn't trust God Amen and and where everybody is putting their trust in in in governments and in supposedly good people and and reforms and all these programs and those things are nice and they're good but it's going to fail one day amen the only thing that won't fail is God's word and there brother renom says it like this there's an inside man and he's steering the boat amen and if we can harmonize the two the prophet says then it'll happen Hallelujah then it'll happen brother bom says it like this he says he says do you ever think that Inside Man of of your body is another man did you know that there's another man inside of your body and that's a spirit man did you ever think of that brother Ryan to see what yes sir that that how this is in here the Inside Man is of God the spirit of God is that right that's inside our being now my finger could not move without something making it move it works from an intelligence here that the Mind subconsciously just maybe if I'd happen to think or reach over here I don't have to think about it it just looked like now where the faith lays now to you people that's really sick and he's trying to get this the people this to this Simplicity I want to get this to you before I read the scriptures now since last night I got I let myself down a little bit there is a conscious and there is a sub conscious it's like if we start overseas by a ship he says and if there's a man sitting there and he's the one who gives the orders the man goes down in the ship to run the ship down well we don't see where he's going amen but he just takes the orders from up above well now he says steer to the left to the right or give the engine more or that or whatever it is he just works by orders but way down in the midst of us here in our heart is the subconscious and it takes orders from up there amen and I want to catch this subconscious means that it's existing in the mind but not immediately available to the Consciousness so what it is is it basically it affects your thought your feeling your behavior without entering into the awareness amen it's your subconscious motives in simple terms it's the aspect of our mental thought process that influences emotions and behavior amen so there's something that's a part of you that's somewhere deep inside of you that influences you and and influences what you do it influences what you say it influences where you go amen and and what what can what the scientific world has has come to realize through years of study and the correlation that there's a there's a connection there to the health of your body and your mind amen and I I know this sounds like some psychology but they just steal it from God anyway amen the the scientific world has come to just barely understand the surface of this amen and what they do is they create these solutions to the problems but what happens is is the solution to the problem becomes more of a problem than the original problem was amen they have these medicines and they have these things and they have these anti- all these things but it just creates more and more problems all it lays in here is a faith in God that you need to let that subconscious man be driven by this amen and then then your your conscious man will automatically do exactly what's gone down on the inside amen you know and if you go just read the Bible he God explains these con these Concepts just like we read just in a simplistic manner that you can grab a hold of that you can be delivered that you can be healed that you can be set free and I'm so thankful for that amen amen that's what the Jubilee is for it's for you amen it's it's something to grab a hold of it's it's not trying to grasp something that seems so unreachable it's it's so you can grab onto a reality of the simplicity of faith in God Amen brother bam you read what brother bam says um in the inside man um he says now you've heard me on the platform many times no doubt I was just hearing a tape from the Owensboro meeting the other day about a person who was crippled and healed and how it was speaking how the Holy Spirit speaking now up here this conscious comes to the platform brother Brandon praise the Lord I have faith but right down there in the other conscious says now no you haven't well now if you can get this one and that one in harmony with that one you see this one's saying yes all the time this one's saying yes but way down in here there's something a little fellow just see you want to make it you want to say yes but it just down there a little shadow that may if you don't deal with this little fellow down here very much well you'll find out that he just kind of does the ruling see so if you don't deal with that then you'll find out that he's the one that does the ruling so then you come you come into a position where you do have a need amen and you do have a a situation and you approach it but brother renom says and he watches and he he would know he he watch these people's spirits and he would say that they had a conscious faith and they they they wanted to believe but something down inside them couldn't grasp they couldn't grab hold of that Faith amen and and what you've got is is this uh you've got this flesh man amen and and you know this this guy he always gets sometimes he gets the better of us amen but you've got to get him in harmony with the one that's deep inside and we read where where you're pulled in two directions you know and so your flesh man you know you want to believe you you hear the word and it says says amen but the one that's driving the ship you may have a little bit of Doubt or you may have a little bit of misunderstanding of the word and then that doubt or that misunderstanding is the thing that's going to manifest amen and so now you can see what the the great value of what our ears listen to or what our eyes see because those things are the pathway to the Inner Man to that subconscious amen and you are what you eat amen if your diet consists of the indoctrination of the world and politics and entertainment then your faith is never going to operate the way that it was meant to operate amen you're you're going to be living in a place where you want to but you're you're you're pulled in two directions like that scripture says and you want to so bad but you also kind of want some of this and you kind of want a little entertainment and you kind of want a little bit of that but you want this so bad you can't be pulled in two directions and operate the kind of faith that God wants you to operate Amen brother random says he says after all this fellow he's the one who drives the ship he's the one who does the steering this one might say a lot but this is the guy that does the work down here say so this one might say oh yes I believe oh sure I do if that's right this is going this and this agrees with that and see then it'll have to work see if this agrees with that then it'll have to work brother benam says amen how do you get it to agree amen but pastor's been preaching on him abiding in him glory to God we we can't put our trust in the things of this world or you know the transformation of of societies they're all going to come to End Amen brother brandom says um says this he says this in in correlation with the sound of the Jubilee He says it's got to come to an end all things are shaking no matter how big they're building a pillar it's got to fall down all things that's not against the word or I'm sorry contrary to it will have to move it'll have to give place because the word is coming triumphantly there's nothing that can stop it God has done said so when he speaks it Heaven and Earth will pass away but it'll never fail hide that word in your heart how to take that word and let it grow keep it in your mind always because it will never fail God God's word will never fail because he said he wouldn't and so we want to keep it on that amen and I did a Sunday school on that and you know brother bham had made this statement he says you know the people come and they say just clear your mind and empty your mind no you need to if you do that you need to allow the the Holy Ghost to come in and the word to come in and saturate your mind amen so that you can operate in that in that place that he wants you to brother bham he uh going on in the rest of that uh he says in if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound now Paul said in the scriptures like training a soldier a soldier to a sound a soldier has got to learn the sound of his bugle or the trumpet he doesn't know if the trumpet blows whether to charge or whether to retreat if he doesn't know the difference what kind of mixed up Army would you have amen the enemy would certainly triumph over a bunch of soldiers that were no better trained than that see so you see so when you go to basic training amen you don't hardly know what you're doing amen there's this thing it's called It's called The Red phrase and and you just you're just going and you're learning and you're being trained as a soldier how to conduct yourself and how to properly yield a weapon and as you go through the motions they begin training you and they begin instilling in within you the characteristics and the training that's required to serve as a soldier amen and you know this thought has just exploded because there's this signal amen if you go on certain military bases there's this signal that plays every morning on certain military bases and it's the rendering of something called Taps amen and if you're in uniform and you're on base when this sound goes off you're trained to stop what you're doing and you're trained to salute in in whatever direction that sound is coming from so you stop what you're doing if you're in uniform and you're trained to know what that means and you're trained to salute amen you're trained to know what that sound means and you're trained to act upon that sound amen and I thought about this concept because there's a few different ways that you can miss out on that sound you know and the first way is if you're untrained in knowing how to recognize it which is part of the subject tonight there's a time during your training that you go through and it's that red phase and it's just the beginning stages where you're just learning amen you know sometimes we're just in this the phase of our life where we're just learning and we're just we're just not exactly sure amen you don't know hardly what's going on and and during that time all that sound seem to you is just an uncertain sound amen it just you know civilians could be walking by and they could hear that sound but if they don't understand what that sound means and if they're not in uniform they don't have to render FLW they don't know they it doesn't matter to them but to the soldiers who have just gone through this rigorous training to know what that sound means they're trained and they're drilled and if they don't they're going to have to they're going to have to do some things amen you're trained to know and to do and act upon that sound amen amen amen and as you're as you're trained you're trained to to continue and brother bom says that's what's the matter with our churches today we're trained on Creeds differing one to another we've got to be United we've got to know a trumpet then which is the trumpet they say the gospel trumpet that's it the word of the Living God is the trumpet you don't mix it with nothing else amen you keep your ears alert to the sounding of that trumpet you know and when the Jubilee took place in levitical times you know and if if there was a people who might have lost their way during Through The Years or they might have found themselves poor and and and destitute or maybe they found themselves in such a way where they had to sell their possessions and and and they were enslaved by their masters but what happened is is their if their ears were fixed to hear that sound there was a designated time and they knew when that time was because they had an inheritance and if they heard that sound amen and they were Rec and they recognized that they could go back to whatever they had possession of amen and they could claim that thing back amen so you better believe they they had their ears fixed on what that sound was amen it was the 49th year it was a certain time in a certain season amen it meant their Liberty it meant their freedom amen it wasn't just another sound you know and just by the grace of God tonight you know I believe I believe we're living in a time oh yeah where we can have our Freedom amen a time where the gospel trumpet is sounding you know and I don't I it doesn't matter what kind of bondage that you've been subjected to it doesn't matter that you might have made the wrong decisions or you might have been enslaved by certain things in the world there is a trumpet of the Gospel amen that is sounded and it's been given to set the captive free to bring Liberty amen and I believe that that one of the the many things that so many people don't realize is that sometimes the devil gets you into a place of of comfortable living or even so distracted by the Affairs of life that that that are causing you to choose to stay enslaved amen there's a trumpet sounding amen and it sounded for a certain time amen but there could also be a people who missed the sound there could also be a people who were so enslaved at a time they got comfortable they got comfortable living in slavery they got comfortable in what they do and they did they decided to stay slave to that Master I want to stay slave to my master amen I want to be free I want to live in Liberty amen I believe we can live in Liberty tonight you just need to recognize the sound you need to act upon the sound Hallelujah I thought that point was so powerful you know God had set all these things in order you know and he crafted a way for you to get back what the enemy has taken from you and to get back your lands and to get back your family amen but you catch this the slaves had to make a decision because if he grew to love his master the the one that he had been serving he had a relationship with it catch this he had a relationship with the master that he's serving and that Master might have treated him good amen he might have given him three Square meals a day he might have given him a nice place to live he might have taken care of his kids and giving them a nice education he might have had all these nice things but if he chose to stay with that Master then it would become a permanent decision in his life amen if I could just emphasize that the problem is that choice is a Permanent Choice amen don't allow yourselves to be so trapped up in a comfortable way of living because they it's so so much so you can't hear that sound or you you just want to stay enslaved you just want to be pulled you're being pulled in that second Direction amen you can become so numb as to think that it's going to be better if I just continue like this the rest of my days but Saints you'd be missing out on on freedom that slave might have not even known what it was like he might have grown up and not known what it was like to have freedom because it happened only ever a certain time there was a certain designated time that it happened amen so he might not have even known so it was just comfortable but I promise there's a freedom that you can live in amen the gospel is a freedom that you can live in the message brings Liberty it brings it brings you to to a freedom that you may not have even ever known about amen you know I want you to catch this tonight because you might struggle as a believer in the Affairs of this life amen you physically you might have sicknesses in your body mentally you might get distraught from situations or from mind battles financially you might not be where you think you you you ought to be but I promise God's Eternal reward and the sound of that freedom is far greater than if you were to stay enslaved in a way of comfortable living because this will fail this life will end but that one never ends Hallelujah he offers don't be you can't be deceived by the enemy because sometimes he offers a pretty deceiving plead deal you know stay living halfway committed to the Lord you know stay coming to church and you know half halfway serving you know you might be better off financially you might have you may not have as many woes in your life or as many trials or as many things but you'll never be living in real victory right you'll never understand the freedom of what it is to be living in Victory amen and he's going to he's going to offer compromises I was reminded when I was studying studying this I was reminded of when Moses came into the presence of pharaoh and Pharaoh said to Moses what all do you request to take and I love how Moses's response because he held nothing back Pharaoh said go serve the Lord your God but who are they that shall go and Moses said we will go with our young and with our old and with our sons and with our daughters and with our flocks and with our herds we will go for we must hold a feast unto the Lord and that struck my heart because you need to let the devil know what your intentions are amen he's going to come and he's going to offer plead deals but you need to let him know what your intentions are I intend to take my victory I intend to take my family with me I intend to take back what you've stolen from me I intend to take my health back from me I even intend to take take a little bit of what you think you have cuz I'm going to offer a praise offering to my God I'm going to have a feast because I know he's going to deliver me in my time of need bless God hallelujah you need to let him know oh I'm tired of living in fear of the enemy and what he's going to do don't live in fear of the enemy I don't care what he does to this broken down body I don't care what he does I want to live in Victory and I want him to know that I'm going to have everything that he's trying to take from me Hal Hallelujah I won't lose even one Moses left that place and he had something rise up in him amen I won't lose even one there was there was an inspiration that took hold of him amen and I grabbed hold of that same inspiration tonight because we will not lose even one Hallelujah we will not lose even one I'm going to take everything hallelujah hallelujah you're burdened with your loved ones I'm going to take him back whatever it is that's my intention all of it plus some amen and you know watch what Pharaoh did amen he he offered a compromise he said no take your men and go but but leave the rest oh but something stirred up in Moses and then sometimes sometimes that plead deal well I would have freedom and my men would have freedom you know but there was something inside I'm not leaving one behind and I believe that same kind of Faith Rises up in fathers and mothers in in sons and daughters in children who have Wayward parents and parents who have wayward children that same kind of Faith no I will not leave until I know that they are coming with me Hallelujah glory to God wherever they are they're coming with me and you know what it got harder after that there was a lot more trials there was a lot more times but bless God they all got out of there Hallelujah and they took their flocks and they offered a sacrifice unto the Lord hallelujah we will leave nothing behind brother brandom says you have access to every Divine promise everything that God has promised and nothing less you know and sometimes sometimes when Deliverance is on the horizon the enemy does everything he can to keep you from it you know Pharaoh did everything he could even at first you go read and you see how Moses when he ini came to Pharaoh the Bible says that Pharaoh increased the burdens of the Israelites you remember that and and and and the people got upset with Moses you know they they because it got a little bit harder you know you know sometimes you know God had a plan I I thought this was incredible God had a plan way back at the burning bush way back before time began but there was a plan set in order now and Moses knew the plan God talked to him at the burning bush he had everything set in order but there was just a sequence of things that needed to happened first amen but the Israelites got caught up because the burden got a little bit heavy amen don't get caught up because the burden seems like it's getting a little bit heavy amen don't get caught up in the hearing now your hearing Now does not dictate the promise Hallelujah your present condition does not dictate the promise hallelujah thank you Jesus your present State it's no indication of what God has planned for your life that just got me that got me so inspired because sometimes I just feel so low I feel like I don't have any victory in my life I feel like these woes I feel I you know you feel down but God has a plan amen and I'm not going to get caught up like those Israelites do and felt so over overburdened I'm just going to be living in Victory and I'm just going to be thanking God and I'm going to be under that same inspiration that Moses had Hallelujah sometimes you just need reminded that and that's okay we're humans but be reminded to tonight Hallelujah glory to God Moses already had his commission Hallelujah that's what faith is your vision can't be fixed on right now my current state may not be where I want it to be you know sickness in my flesh may have torn me down and discouraged me but I rest in God's word I rest in his promise he's got the final say he's my deliverer amen he's the one I trust you know and sometimes because the enemy's crafty the the compromise might seem a little bit more sensible or you know or more comfortable amen you know the slaves and and how they they could have they could have lived more comfortably but we don't look at those things amen don't keep your eyes fixed on the natural amen I want to have spiritual eyes and a spiritual vision amen you know the problem with so many of those Israelites is that they kept the Comforts of Egypt in their heart now this is a point that really struck me and they were never able to get past that you know brother Brenham had that F says that so famously the Israelites left Egypt but Egypt never left the Israelites saints of God you don't ever let the Comforts of this world keep you living in Egypt amen you could be you could be out of Egypt but if your heart is back in Egypt then you're still in Egypt amen they were never able to get into their Promised Land There was a huge majority of them that always kept they always stayed they should have just stayed because they lived there forever they could never get past it amen oh Pastor pastor's desk back there says Comfort The Afflicted but afflict the comfortable amen praise praise God Amen back to back to the Jubilee and you know I was I was beginning to think I'm just just a few more minutes here beginning to think of another thing that can happen so often you know as as a soldier one of the things that that they train you to do is is they you know they train you to recognize that signal and that sound and what it's supposed to do is it's supposed to become so instinctual that you know what the sound is and and what it means and even more importantly that you act upon it Saints there was there was a shout there was a voice and one day there'll be the final sounding of a trumpet amen and we are we are living in a time where we are to recognize what that sound is we are to hear it we don't hear an uncertain sound we know what we're hearing amen we hear the voice of a message the voice of a prophet speaking a message amen hallelujah and one day there going to be a final sound what what happens is you can get so caught up in those Affairs in your life even though even though the the trumpet is sounding you just get so distracted you just you miss it all together and and I actually took this point out but I feel like the Lord's just kind of having me bring it in there's also another another group that you hear the sound but you've just gotten so desensitized to it that you do everything you can to avoid it amen don't be in either of those crack amen when you hear the sound when you hear the Lord speaking to your heart about something don't be pulled in two directions amen you just Just Surrender it and if it's something that's hard to surrender pray about it amen yield it to the Lord because there is a desire there there's obviously something that's holding you there amen but what God can do is he can not only take that away from you he can take away the desire that's holding you there amen I believe that with all my heart just I just have two more quotes here and then we'll kind of wrap it up and Paul was talking about brother benam says in in a trumpet gives an uncertain sound 1963 and Paul was talking about training a man to a sound and just as that sound is he knows exactly what to do because the bugler has got orders and from the chief captain and when he hears the sound his the Army knows just exactly what to advance and what to withdraw by the sounding and I read that quote amen we're going to this last quote is from return and Jubilee brother bandham says now a man and this is where the inspiration took me when I first heard this where this whole sermon came from now a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know what it meant to them now if they heard the priest sound the trumpet the minister of the trumpet is the gospel and when they hear it and they know what it means catch this and they know that that's their inheritance no matter where they' lost or how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive again their inheritance the whole family could come and receive their inheritance praise God if they could hear the sound of the trumpet and know what it meant no matter what you had lost no matter how far in sin no matter how far you had gone it didn't matter if you knew what that sound was and that's an importance in training our children and that's the importance of reading the word because you need to train them to recognize that they have an inheritance Hallelujah and there's a trumpet sounding and when that trumpet sounds they are to take that inheritance Hallelujah they had the privilege to come and receive again their inheritance and so it is tonight men and women here of Louisiana that knows the things that we do know and have heard from our brother and different ones of our Pentecostal experience of years ago and find that we have walled or if we haven't walled ourselves from it so far we've got to hear what somebody else says instead of what thus sayith the Lord is and can hear the word of God has got to say about it now is the hour of Jubilee come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just go up and go that's all he had to do go back if he knew the sound of a trumpet but saints of God he had to know the sound of a trumpet Hallelujah I believe that Believers tonight here we know the sound of a trumpet I believe sometimes we get pulled in two directions amen but sometimes we just need a little remembrance to come to our hearts that I want to become what God has intended me to become amen I'm going to let the devil know my intentions I'm going to I'm going to do these things that the scripture tells me to do hallelujah amen The Trumpet of the Jubilee was to sound on what the scripture refers to as the day of atonement and this day of atonement become a became a day where the priests would bring a sin offering to sanctify and cleanse and and if you go read the scoffield notes on that on the day of atonement you know according to the the trans ators the significance of this day was to make God and the sinner at one but all it could do when it wasn't a perfect offering back at that time in the Old Testament was provide a covering but what it did is it pointed to Christ amen it pointed to the one who could create a perfect offering who would be the perfect atonement Hallelujah the real atonement the acceptable year brother Benham says let's just let's stand to our feet tonight I just have this last quote and going to finish here brother random says in the acceptable year as we all know as Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and prisoners as they were been taken prison and had to give a son to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they had been in bondage or how they were supposed to stay there when the year come of the Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free you're free you were no more a Slave but if you desired to remain a slave then you had to be taken down to the temple stood by the temple post and they took an all and they bored a hole in your ear and then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached the acceptable time at the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are it doesn't matter what color or what denomination you belong to how far it is that you're stooped into sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound out you are free amen hallelujah I'm glad to be free tonight Sint I'm glad to be free who's with me I'm glad to be free I just love the word don't you just love the word amen let's just bow our hearts tonight Heavenly Father we just are so humbled and thankful for Lord the presence in your word Lord tonight Lord we just pray that it could seed into our hearts

surprised actually especially greatest battle ever fall brother Bam's talking about you know what brother Caleb was preaching from tonight that you know that there's the outside conscience that we all see you know that we're all aware of but sometimes he says what gets in the way of faith is that he says not the man out here but the man under here and he says gets in the way through fears or complexes or you know through bitterness even grudges brother brandom said and things that exist in that subconscious talks about the um you know that that that that's what controls you amen that's why it's important like brother bandam said we clean out the channels memory conscience reasoning imagination affection we let the Lord come in not just to clean out our soul but say Lord Purge out
