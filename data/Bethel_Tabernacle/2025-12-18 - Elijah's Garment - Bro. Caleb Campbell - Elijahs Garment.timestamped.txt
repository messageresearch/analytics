[4:23] Amen.

[11:04] Good to be here in church. Amen. [music]
[11:07] Just want to worship the Lord together
[11:09] tonight. That's what we're here for.
[11:10] We're here to worship the Lord. Amen.
[11:12] [music] Um happy to be back. We Jo and I
[11:15] had a little getaway and we're just
[11:16] happy to be home. So just if you want to
[11:20] let's [music] just go right into the
[11:21] word tonight. We're going to turn into
[11:22] our Bibles.
[11:25] Had this thought just kind of stirring
[11:27] in my heart the last [music] several
[11:29] weeks, maybe even months. But you know,
[11:31] sometimes he just gives you a little
[11:33] nugget of inspiration and it might sit
[11:35] there for a while. Then he starts
[11:36] building the thought. So the Lord just
[11:38] inspired me this way for tonight. Pray
[11:40] it can be a blessing. Amen.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; We're going to go into the second book
[11:46] of Kings first. So 2 Kings chapter 2 and
[11:50] we're going to catch the first 14 verses
[11:53] of scripture there. And then your second
[11:57] reading is going to come out of Romans
[11:59] the 12th chapter.
[12:02] 2 Kings chapter 2 and verses one. And it
[12:06] says, "And it came to pass when the Lord
[12:09] would take up Elijah into heaven by a
[12:12] whirlwind
[12:14] that Elijah went up with Elisha from
[12:17] Gilgal.
[12:19] And Elijah said unto Elisha,
[12:22] "Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord
[12:25] hath sent me to Bethl."
[12:28] And Elijah And Elisha said unto him, "As
[12:31] the Lord liveth, and as my soul liveth,
[12:33] I will not leave thee." So they went
[12:35] down to Bethl. And the sons of the
[12:38] prophets that were at Bethl came forth
[12:40] to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest
[12:43] thou that the Lord will take away thy
[12:46] master from thy head today? And he said,
[12:49] Ya, I know it. Hold ye your peace? And
[12:53] Elijah said unto him, Elisha, Tarry
[12:55] here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath
[12:58] sent me to Jericho. And he said, as the
[13:00] Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I
[13:03] will not leave thee. So they came to
[13:06] Jericho. If you notice, he's giving him
[13:08] a way out. He's given him an excuse to
[13:10] stay somewhere. But he wants to walk
[13:12] with the word. Amen. He wants to stay
[13:14] where the word is staying. As your soul
[13:16] liveth, and as your soul goeth, I will
[13:19] go with you.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they came to Jericho. And
[13:23] the sons of the prophets that were at
[13:25] Jericho came to Elisha and said unto
[13:27] him, "Knowest thou that the Lord will
[13:29] take away thy master from thy head to
[13:32] thee today?" And he answered and said,
[13:34] "Yay, I know it. hold your peace. And
[13:38] Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray thee
[13:41] here, for the Lord hath sent me to
[13:44] Jordan. And he said, as the Lord liveth,
[13:46] and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave
[13:49] thee. And they too went on. We're going
[13:52] to catch that a little bit later. But
[13:53] they too went on. And 50 men of the sons
[13:56] of the prophets went and stood to view a
[13:58] far off, and they too stood by Jordan.
[14:02] And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped
[14:05] it together and smote the waters, and
[14:07] they were divided hither and thither, so
[14:10] that they too went over on dry ground.
[14:13] And it came to pass when they were gone
[14:16] over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask
[14:19] what I shall do for thee before I be
[14:21] taken away from thee." And Elijah Elisha
[14:23] said, "I pray thee, let a double portion
[14:25] of thy spirit be upon me."
[14:28] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Thou hast asked a hard
[14:30] thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when
[14:33] I am taken from thee, it shall be so
[14:35] unto thee. But if not, it shall not be
[14:37] so. And it came to pass as they stood as
[14:41] they still went on and talked that
[14:43] behold, there appeared a chariot of fire
[14:45] and horses of fire, and parted them both
[14:50] aunderder. And Elijah went up by a
[14:53] whirlwind unto heaven. And Elisha saw
[14:56] it, and he cried, "My father, my father,
[14:58] the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
[15:00] thereof." And he saw him no more. And he
[15:03] took hold of his own clothes, and rent
[15:05] them in two pieces. He took also the
[15:08] mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
[15:12] went back and stood by the bank of the
[15:14] Jordan. And he used the mantle of Elijah
[15:18] that fell from him and smote the waters
[15:21] and said, "Where is the Lord God of
[15:23] Elijah?" And when he had also smitten
[15:26] the waters, they parted hither and
[15:28] thither, and Elisha went over. Amen.
[15:32] There's just two verses in Romans, if
[15:33] you just turn with me, Romans chapter 2.
[15:36] Amen.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 12, I'm sorry, in verses
[15:41] 1 and two. Beseech I beseech you
[15:42] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[15:44] God, that you present your bodies a
[15:46] living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
[15:48] unto the unto God, which is your
[15:50] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[15:53] to this world, but be transformed by the
[15:55] renewing of your mind, that you may
[15:56] prove what is that good and acceptable
[15:59] and perfect will of God. I'd like to
[16:02] take a title for tonight if the Lord
[16:03] would just help me with it. Uh Elijah's
[16:05] garment. Elijah's garment. Let's just go
[16:07] to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father,
[16:09] Lord, we just come to you, Father, this
[16:11] evening. We're just thankful for the
[16:12] word, Lord Jesus. And I just thank you
[16:14] for how you inspired my heart for this
[16:16] word, Lord. I just pray that you just
[16:18] open the book tonight, Lord. Father,
[16:20] everyone here tonight, we just have
[16:22] listening ears, Lord, to hear from you,
[16:24] Lord. I just move myself aside just as a
[16:27] Lord, an unworthy vessel, Lord God, an
[16:29] unprofitable servant. But would you come
[16:31] and would you just take the words that
[16:32] were spoken, Father, and may you just
[16:34] anoint them, Father. May your presence
[16:36] come down in this service and may it
[16:38] speak to us. We pray. We love you. We
[16:40] dedicate it all to you. In Jesus
[16:42] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[16:44] you as you take your seats this evening.
[16:48] Amen.
[16:51] Just for some uh foundation here
[16:53] tonight. We're going to go through a
[16:55] little bit of the history of the
[16:56] timeline of where we're reading from
[16:59] there in Second Kings. So this this book
[17:03] here, first Kings, 2 Kings, it's
[17:05] describing this path that Elijah and
[17:08] Elisha were on. Amen. And if you go back
[17:10] a few chapters earlier there in First
[17:13] Kings chapter 19, it begins to describe
[17:16] some events that actually took place
[17:18] leading up to Elijah's translation. In
[17:22] chapter 19, God was going to have
[17:24] Elijah. Chapter 19 of First Kings, he
[17:27] was going to have Elijah anoint a new
[17:29] prophet to take his place. Amen. We're
[17:32] familiar. Elisha. And he was also going
[17:34] to anoint a new king to reign over
[17:36] Syria. And at the same time, he was
[17:38] going to anoint another king to reign
[17:40] over Israel.
[17:42] And if we remember, this is the same
[17:45] chapter that Elijah found himself
[17:48] underneath the juniper tree. Amen. He
[17:50] was he was running for his life. And at
[17:53] this particular point in scripture, Ahab
[17:55] and Jezebel were in control in Israel.
[17:58] And Jezebel at in the beginning of the
[18:01] chapter of of First Kings 19. I know
[18:04] sometimes we read it like a timeline,
[18:06] but this is about 10 11 years prior to
[18:09] that. Um [snorts] Ahab and Jezebel were
[18:11] in control. And Jezebel had sent word to
[18:13] Elijah because she was so angry at about
[18:18] what happened on Mount Carmel. how all
[18:20] of her false false prophets were killed
[18:22] and how how he had this showdown and how
[18:25] he proved that God was the god of the
[18:28] day. How how Baal was was nothing but a
[18:31] false god and how Elijah went down and
[18:33] he slew all those prophets and and she
[18:35] was mad. She was angry. So she sent this
[18:38] messenger to Elijah the and this message
[18:41] said at the tomorrow at this time I plan
[18:45] to find you and kill you the same way
[18:48] that you had my prophets killed. Right?
[18:50] So this is why he was in such a place.
[18:52] It was one of the lowest times in
[18:54] Elijah's entire life. The and you know
[18:57] the situation that he was in it was so
[18:59] overwhelming to him that he sat
[19:01] underneath that tree. Amen. And he just
[19:03] asked the Lord Lord please let me die. I
[19:07] can't even live. He He just had He just
[19:09] had one of the most supernatural things
[19:11] take place. You know, I love this story
[19:13] because, you know, sometimes when we're
[19:15] in situations like that when when we're
[19:17] just feeling overwhelmed, we can really
[19:19] lose our spiritual vision. Amen.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; We can really lose, you know, any any
[19:25] kind of any kind of foresight because
[19:27] we're just caught up in this situation
[19:28] of our natural circumstances. Amen. The
[19:31] only thing that we can we can see is the
[19:33] here and the right now. Amen. Remember
[19:35] Elijah just had this mountaintop
[19:38] experience. The the chapter before that
[19:41] which is chapter 18 in my opinion is one
[19:44] of the most supernatural chapters in all
[19:46] of the Bible. Amen. If you go and read
[19:48] it, he had you had the Mount Carmel
[19:50] showdown where God came and he brought
[19:52] down the fire of heaven and he consumed
[19:54] the burnt sacrifice and he and he licked
[19:57] up all the water that was poured on the
[19:58] altar. Then in the very next verse,
[20:01] Elijah slew every one of those prophets
[20:03] of Baal there at the book at the brook
[20:05] of Keshan. Then in the next verse,
[20:07] Elijah stood up and with the power of
[20:10] God backing this prophet, he made that
[20:12] declaration of faith. Amen. Where you
[20:15] know the drought of Israel had came and
[20:17] Elijah was the one who spoke to that to
[20:19] to Israel that they were going to have a
[20:21] drought if you remember. And it was
[20:23] three years. And then and then Elijah
[20:25] was anointed to raise up in that same
[20:27] verse and say, "I can hear the sound of
[20:30] the abundance of rain." Amen. He had
[20:33] that that fa that statement of faith.
[20:35] And and then in the in the next verses,
[20:37] it begins to describe how how he sent
[20:39] his servants out and how he would say,
[20:41] "YOU KEEP GOING AND YOU keep looking
[20:43] because their rain is going to come." I
[20:45] know rain. I KNOW YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
[20:46] WHAT RAIN looks like anymore because
[20:48] it's been three years, but rain is going
[20:50] to come. Amen. You keep going and you
[20:53] looking. And that servant kept coming
[20:54] back and forth seven times. AND THE
[20:57] SEVENTH TIME HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID,
[21:00] "I SEE A CLOUD like a man's hand." Amen.
[21:04] Oh, hallelujah. You know, sometimes when
[21:06] you're in situations like that and God
[21:08] anoints you to SPEAK TO WHATEVER TRIAL
[21:10] IN YOUR LIFE, YOU YOU GOT TO LOOK AT
[21:12] THAT TRIAL. YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE
[21:14] circumstance and you GOT TO RECOGNIZE
[21:16] THAT THAT CLOUD LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FAR
[21:18] AWAY. IT looked like there was a
[21:20] distance, BUT BUT EVERYTHING that they
[21:22] had need of was in that cloud. ALL THE
[21:24] ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WAS IN THAT CLOUD. IT
[21:27] WAS GOING TO GET BIGGER and bigger and
[21:30] bigger. And whatever circumstance you're
[21:32] in, IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE GOD IS
[21:34] GOING TO ANOINT you to overcome because
[21:37] we're overcomers. Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Elijah was so anointed. HE SPOKE TO THAT
[21:43] DROUGHT AND HE THERE IS A SOUND of the
[21:46] abundance of rain. Amen. YOU START
[21:48] SLAYING FALSE GODS IN YOUR LIFE. AMEN.
[21:51] Like he did, HE SLEW THOSE GODS. HE SLEW
[21:54] THOSE PROPHETS AND HE HAD A FAITH RISE
[21:56] UP IN HIM. AMEN. YOU START SLAYING THOSE
[21:58] THINGS IN YOUR LIFE. YOU START HAVING
[22:00] THOSE LITTLE VICTORIES and those little
[22:02] victories become bigger and bigger. YOU
[22:05] REMEMBER DAVID? AMEN. HE HAD TO GO AND
[22:07] FIGHT GOLIATH. BUT BEFORE HE WENT AND
[22:10] FOUGHT GOLIATH, HE HAD SOME PERSONAL
[22:12] VICTORIES THAT HE HAD TO OVERCOME. AMEN.
[22:14] He had to he HAD TO GO IN THAT SH THAT
[22:17] PASTURE AND HE had to fight a lion and
[22:20] he had TO FIGHT A BEAR. AMEN. And I I
[22:22] just remember just studying about that
[22:24] and how sometimes IN OUR PERSONAL LIFE
[22:26] WE GO THROUGH THINGS WHEN NOBODY ELSE IS
[22:28] AROUND. AMEN. WE go through things, you
[22:31] know, in our minds, we go through things
[22:33] that people don't see. Amen. And those
[22:35] are the lions and those are the bears.
[22:37] BUT THOSE ARE THE VERY THINGS that are
[22:39] going to give you the FAITH TO OVERCOME
[22:41] THE GIANTS IN your life.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:45] Amen.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; He says to his servant, "Go and do it
[22:51] seven times." Amen.
[22:53] [snorts]
[22:54] Amen.
[22:57] Then just a few verses later there in
[22:59] chapter 19, he gets that message. Amen.
[23:03] Actually, another thing that happened in
[23:05] chapter 18, if you remember, when the
[23:07] sound the when the rain started, God
[23:11] gave him a supernatural speed to run
[23:14] faster than that chariot. All of that
[23:16] happened in chapter 18. And the very
[23:18] beginning of chapter 19, think about
[23:20] this. A few days, maybe a few weeks
[23:22] later, he got message from Jezebel. And
[23:26] that message just caused him to get in
[23:28] such disarray that he had to go and sit
[23:30] up under a juniper tree. and he asked
[23:32] the Lord, "Lord, let me die."
[23:38] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when we we all are
[23:40] prone to get into situations like that.
[23:43] Amen. We've all seen the power of God
[23:45] move in our life. We've all had
[23:47] mountaintop experiences, but we're all
[23:49] susceptible to living to to having those
[23:51] circumstances come and to feel
[23:53] overwhelming to us. Amen.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I believe that God, even on a
[23:58] Wednesday night, is ready to come and
[24:00] give you some spiritual mana. Amen.
[24:02] That's what I need tonight. I just need
[24:04] a a little bit of charge to get me
[24:06] through. Amen. I just need a little bit
[24:07] of mana. Amen. I don't want mana from
[24:09] yesterday. I want today's mana. Amen.
[24:12] Because yesterday's mana was free
[24:14] yesterday, but today I need what he has
[24:16] for me today. Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He It's spiritual food in
[24:21] due season. Amen. To sustain us, to
[24:24] strengthen us. Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; So then in in the next verse there,
[24:27] verse 14, it reads, "He was ready to die
[24:30] after all that had happened." And then I
[24:32] know we're all familiar, but we love
[24:34] Bible stories, right? So this is all
[24:36] right. Then verse 5, it goes on to say
[24:38] that he fell asleep under that tree.
[24:40] Amen. And God had sent a ministering
[24:42] angel under him, and it said that the
[24:44] angel touched him, and when he woke up,
[24:47] he saw that there was a a cake baked,
[24:50] amen, in a cruise of water. And you know
[24:52] the prophet says in one place he put
[24:53] some spiritual vitamins in that cake.
[24:56] Amen. And then he fell back asleep.
[24:58] Amen.
[24:59] And the angel came again the second
[25:01] time. And this time he said I know that
[25:03] the journey is going to be very great
[25:06] for thee. And so it says the angel came
[25:09] and touched him again.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; And gave him some spiritual meats to
[25:13] strengthen him and he started on his
[25:17] way. Amen. God has times where he's able
[25:20] to meet you under that juniper tree and
[25:22] revive you and give you the strength to
[25:25] keep pressing the battle. Amen. And this
[25:27] example, it just goes to show you you
[25:30] can't live in yesterday's experience. I
[25:32] appreciate yesterday's experience. I
[25:34] appreciate what the Lord did for me
[25:36] then, but I need it now. Amen. I need
[25:39] what God has for me today. Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; No matter how incredible or how
[25:43] supernatural. Amen. Elijah obviously
[25:46] couldn't live with yesterday's man. He
[25:48] couldn't he couldn't even see it
[25:50] anymore. Amen.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; And when Elijah was there in the middle
[25:54] of that trial, it says in in verse 8 of
[25:57] chapter 19, it says that he came near to
[26:00] Mount Horeb. And we we we preached on
[26:03] that here before. Amen. Mount Horeb,
[26:04] it's the mount of God. Amen. Mount Horeb
[26:07] is where God meets man and and and lets
[26:10] him be in his presence. Mount Horeb is
[26:13] where he gives him a fresh experience.
[26:16] Amen. It's where Moses came and met him
[26:18] and and saw the the burning bush and and
[26:21] it's where he came again and met him
[26:24] again. And it's where Elijah had these
[26:26] experiences. And so now he's coming to
[26:28] Mount Horeb, the place where he meets
[26:30] his servants. And it says when he came
[26:33] near to this place that God actually
[26:35] asked Elijah to express himself. I
[26:38] thought this was this just the Lord just
[26:40] put this on my heart this like last
[26:41] night. I thought this was a powerful
[26:43] point because you know we're talking
[26:44] about God here, right? God was the one
[26:47] he knew the situation that Elijah was
[26:50] in. He was the one who gave the mana to
[26:53] get him out of that situation. Amen. And
[26:55] and he was the one who sent the angel.
[26:58] He gave him the strength to get through
[26:59] the journey. But when God spoke to
[27:01] Elijah here, he asked him and brother
[27:03] Brandon preaches that you know what
[27:05] doest thou here Elijah? what are you
[27:06] what are you doing here? And Elijah
[27:09] expressed himself. Amen. And after that
[27:12] first time, God asked him that. Then he
[27:14] comes and he has this incredible
[27:17] experience, right? Where where he
[27:19] witnesses where where the fire of God
[27:21] came down and and where the the wind
[27:23] struck and where God sent the earthquake
[27:26] and he has this incredible experience
[27:28] and and then he and then he hears the
[27:30] the still small voice speak to him.
[27:32] Remember? So that was after God had
[27:34] asked him that and then he comes and a
[27:36] few verses later after that had happened
[27:39] and he asks him again he says what doest
[27:42] thou here Elijah
[27:44] &gt;&gt; so see there's God knows the importance
[27:47] of expression amen he knows that when
[27:50] you're in the middle of something he
[27:52] knows how important it is to express you
[27:55] to have someone to express yourselves to
[27:57] he crafted us in a way remember brother
[27:59] Renham teaches that in Christ as the
[28:01] mystery of God revealed that that he one
[28:04] of his great three-fold purposes is to
[28:06] express himself. Amen. So, if we're
[28:09] supposed to be like God, then we're
[28:11] supposed to express ourselves. And he
[28:14] knows that sometimes we're in situations
[28:16] where we have to express ourselves. And
[28:19] who better to express yourself to than
[28:21] the one who made you than THE ONE WHO
[28:24] KNOWS HOW TO GET YOU from where you are
[28:26] to where you need to be. Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Because he let him express himself. He
[28:31] didn't say, "Stop, Elijah. I know what
[28:32] you're going through. Stop. You don't
[28:34] even have to tell me. You know what are
[28:36] you talking about? I I know. I saw it. I
[28:38] was there. I sent the angel. I was
[28:39] there." No, he let him express himself
[28:41] because he knew he needed him to get
[28:44] past this hurt in his life. Amen. He
[28:48] knew he needed him to get to the next
[28:50] phase of his journey. Amen. So, he let
[28:53] him stand there and he let him express
[28:56] himself. Amen.
[28:58] When you're going through things, it's
[29:00] important to understand that principle
[29:02] that whatever question you might have in
[29:04] your heart or whatever hurt you might be
[29:06] living with, God has an answer for it.
[29:09] Amen. And you might not always get it
[29:11] right away and you might not always get
[29:13] the answer you want, but God has an
[29:16] answer for it. Amen.
[29:18] It may just be that God needs you to
[29:20] open up your heart. Cuz sometimes when
[29:22] you're in the midst of that situation,
[29:24] you're looking for an answer. You don't
[29:26] even need an answer. You just need God
[29:28] to come in and wipe some spiritual mana
[29:31] in your heart and just to just to touch
[29:34] you cuz you don't know what's wrong.
[29:36] Amen. You don't know why you're feeling
[29:38] that way, but you just need God to come
[29:40] in. And sometimes he just needs you to
[29:42] open up to that. Open up that part in
[29:44] your heart. There's doors in your heart
[29:46] that you got to open up to him.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; The very next verse,
[29:56] God then commisss Elijah to go to anoint
[30:01] a new prophet, anoint these new kings.
[30:06] But it wasn't until he heard that voice,
[30:09] that still small voice, and recognized
[30:12] it. Amen. And it was only then, it was
[30:15] only then that God told him what to do
[30:18] next. Amen. And told him where he was
[30:20] going to go next and moved him into this
[30:23] next phase of his journey.
[30:26] Amen. Our opening text there read of of
[30:28] uh
[30:33] I just leave that open there.
[30:36] Our opening text there, we read of the
[30:38] translation of Elijah. Amen. Who's on
[30:40] the journey to their translation? Amen.
[30:43] Who's on that journey?
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when the chariots of fire
[30:47] came to pick him up and carry him off to
[30:49] heaven, but this was his journey to get
[30:52] across Jordan. Amen. And he could never
[30:55] get across Jordan. He could never get to
[30:58] that chariot before he first came to the
[31:01] mountain of God. Amen. And heard the
[31:04] power of that still small voice. Amen.
[31:07] And and you'll never be able to get
[31:08] across Jordan. You'll never be able to
[31:11] get to your translation before you first
[31:14] have your Mount Horeb experience before
[31:17] you stand on that mountain and you talk
[31:20] with God. Amen. It doesn't have to be a
[31:22] physical mountain, but you get into a
[31:24] place where nothing else matters because
[31:26] you're in a different atmosphere. Amen.
[31:28] And you're talking with God. Amen. And
[31:30] and nobody else is there. Amen. You're
[31:33] out on the green pastures and you're
[31:35] speaking with God. Amen. Come on.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; And and you have this experience and he
[31:40] speaks to your heart and he says, "Come
[31:42] up higher." Amen. He tells you, he tells
[31:46] you who you are. Amen. Well, that still
[31:48] small voice, he gives you that
[31:49] revelation. Oh, this is who you are.
[31:52] This is what I have in store for your
[31:54] life. This is what's going to happen
[31:55] next. This is where you're going to go.
[31:57] Amen. He whispers that revelation in
[31:59] your heart.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just thought about kind of
[32:03] correlating something. And I thought
[32:04] about that, you know, Saul's conversion
[32:06] there on the road to Damascus. You know,
[32:08] when he was on that road, the Bible says
[32:10] that he saw a light and he heard a
[32:12] voice. And brother Random said the light
[32:14] was so bright that, you know, it even
[32:17] blinded his eyes. We know that. But to
[32:19] those that were with him, amen, those
[32:21] soldiers that were with him, they didn't
[32:23] even see a light. Amen. They didn't have
[32:26] the same experience. Although
[32:28] geographically they were in the same
[32:30] place. And although the Bible does say
[32:32] that they heard some kind of a voice,
[32:34] they did not see the light. Amen. So
[32:37] just a kind of a note this morning.
[32:39] People can be walking down the same path
[32:41] you walk down. They could be in the same
[32:43] church that you're in. They could be
[32:45] even hearing the same message that's
[32:47] preached. Amen. Amen. But unless you
[32:49] have eyes to hear, unless your heart is
[32:51] open to God revealing himself to you,
[32:54] you'll never catch the revelation of the
[32:58] light. Amen. because there was a
[33:00] revelation in that light. It wasn't just
[33:02] the light that blinded him because that
[33:04] blindness was temporary, but the
[33:06] revelation he received from the light.
[33:09] Oh, hallelujah.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; That was eternal.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:17] I'm so grateful God gives us those
[33:19] lenses to catch the light. [snorts]
[33:22] &gt;&gt; You know, something interesting about
[33:24] the historical timeline.
[33:27] So here there in first kings chapter 19
[33:30] when um do I it was um first kings 19.
[33:36] So Ahab and Jezebel were reigning and
[33:38] and God told Elijah go ahead and anoint
[33:41] Jahoo. Okay just some biblical history.
[33:44] Go ahead and Elijah you're going to
[33:46] anoint Elisha. You're going to anoint
[33:48] Jahoo. and you're going to anoint can't
[33:51] remember who the third one was, but it
[33:52] was the the another king of another who
[33:55] was it?
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't remember who it was, but
[33:59] so he anointed three, right? So, but it
[34:01] wasn't until 10 years after this. So,
[34:05] chapter chapter 19 and then Elijah's
[34:08] translated in 2 Kings chapter 2. And if
[34:11] you look at the timeline, that's 10
[34:13] years. So, or yeah, 10 years. And then
[34:16] it's not until nearly 12 years after
[34:19] Elijah's translation that Jahoo was
[34:23] actually proclaimed king over Israel and
[34:28] Jezebel was killed. If you just catching
[34:30] some of the timeline. But what I thought
[34:31] was so powerful was that God let Elijah
[34:36] be the one to anoint Jahoo because Jah
[34:40] was going to be the one that was going
[34:42] to kill Jezebel. Amen. Because the devil
[34:45] is going to try to torment you. Amen.
[34:47] The devil's going to try to think he
[34:48] he's got something on you. AMEN. BUT
[34:50] GOD'S GOT A PLAN. AMEN. GOD has a season
[34:54] in mind. It may not be in your time.
[34:56] Elijah didn't even see it happen. He was
[34:59] dead and gone FOR 12 YEARS, BUT GOD HAD
[35:02] allowed him to anoint the one who was
[35:04] going to kill and slay that very enemy.
[35:07] Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thought about that. I thought
[35:09] about just so powerful to me how oh
[35:12] sometimes we're going through things we
[35:13] don't understand it and and we may not
[35:15] even maybe see why or where but it
[35:18] doesn't matter because if WE JUST TRUST
[35:20] GOD AND WE TRUST HIS TIMELINE HE'S GOT A
[35:23] PLAN for everything.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He's eternal. He sees the
[35:28] bigger picture. Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:37] Then we see how God speaks to Elijah
[35:42] and he tells tells him that he has a man
[35:45] that he's going to find a man that's
[35:47] going to take his place.
[35:49] He said, "You're going to find Elisha
[35:52] the Tishbite and you're going to anoint
[35:55] Elisha
[35:57] because he's going to be prophet in your
[35:59] place." Amen. But again, the timeline,
[36:03] he had some training. Elisha had some
[36:05] training that he had to go through
[36:06] first. Amen. Remember my title tonight
[36:09] is Elijah's garment.
[36:12] And uh and and just just I I mentioned
[36:16] this already, but David, you know, he
[36:17] was when he was anointed to be king, you
[36:20] know, he was just a boy, right? But then
[36:22] after he was anointed, he had a lot of
[36:25] training that he had to go through,
[36:27] testing that he had to endure. Amen.
[36:29] maturity that he had to reach before
[36:32] taking the throne, before actually
[36:34] becoming the king. Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; And you know, I thought some of some of
[36:38] the there's a song Brother Tony sings, I
[36:40] can't think of it now, but some of the
[36:41] greatest trials in your life end up
[36:43] being some of the biggest building
[36:44] blocks in your character development.
[36:46] Amen. Some of the hardest things you go
[36:48] through, although you don't like to
[36:50] think of it when you're going through
[36:51] it, to become some of the the things
[36:53] that help you mature and help you become
[36:56] a Christian. Amen. help you become the
[36:59] who you are and who you're supposed to
[37:01] be. Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Those times of testing because you're
[37:04] able to when you're on the other side of
[37:06] it, you're able to see how God used it.
[37:09] He used he used evil. Amen. So he uses
[37:12] it for his good. Amen. So he uses it to
[37:15] transform your life. Amen. He uses it to
[37:18] shape you and change you and mold you
[37:20] into the image that he sees you to be.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:26] I I read um this little devotion thing
[37:29] and the this um I think it's the
[37:32] devotion that that you recommended that
[37:34] you u that you use. The Scottish
[37:38] preacher, he he has a devotional. He
[37:39] says, "My dear God, I have never thanked
[37:41] you for my thorns. I have thanked you a
[37:44] thousand times for my roses, but not
[37:46] once for my thorns. I have always looked
[37:49] forward to the place where I will be
[37:51] rewarded for my cross. But I have never
[37:54] thought of my cross as a present glory
[37:57] itself. Teach me, oh Lord, to glory in
[38:00] my cross. Teach me the value of my
[38:03] thorns. Show me how I have climbed to
[38:07] you through the path of pain. Show me it
[38:11] is through my tears I have seen my
[38:14] rainbow. Thank God for those thorns.
[38:18] Amen. I thought that was just so
[38:19] powerful. Amen. Elisha in this chapter,
[38:23] he was anointed to be prophet. Wow, that
[38:26] time is Elisha in this chapter, he was
[38:29] anointed to be prophet, but um 10 years
[38:32] later, you know, I I was thinking about
[38:34] this just kind of studying for this. You
[38:36] know, the Bible doesn't always tell you
[38:38] everything that goes on in between the
[38:40] lines, right? You know, John John speaks
[38:42] of that. you know, if if we had all the
[38:44] books in all the world, it would never
[38:45] express all the things that Jesus did,
[38:47] right? And like during that time of of
[38:50] Elisha's of training when he was walking
[38:52] with Elijah, right? So they walked
[38:53] together for 10 years. I would imagine
[38:55] that Elijah would sit around a campfire
[38:58] at night. Amen. And he would begin to
[39:00] express some of these stories. Amen. I I
[39:02] just just for a drama tonight, I just
[39:04] thought about how Elijah maybe would
[39:05] dramatize the showdown on Mount Carmel.
[39:08] how all of those hundreds of prophets
[39:10] were there calling out to Baal and
[39:12] trying to get them to to bring fire down
[39:14] and and then when it came time for
[39:16] Elijah to call down fire from God, the
[39:19] Lord inspired him to to trench it with
[39:21] water and then he called on God and the
[39:24] fire came down and then he proved how
[39:26] all those frost prophets and those
[39:28] people that that this was the living
[39:30] God. Amen. Or maybe he would tell Elisha
[39:33] about the time that that all that that
[39:35] that about that experience that he had
[39:37] under the juniper tree where that angel
[39:39] came and and met him there and gave him
[39:41] this supernatural mana and how he wanted
[39:43] he was in despair but he but he didn't
[39:45] he he wanted to lose his life but God
[39:47] came and and gave him instruction to go
[39:49] to Mount Horeb and then he then he heard
[39:51] that that still small voice. Amen. And
[39:53] and once all that noise was gone, he
[39:55] heard that voice and that revelation
[39:57] speak to him. Amen. Or or maybe he told
[39:59] him about the time that the widow ha had
[40:02] this child that died.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how [snorts] the power of God
[40:06] fell upon him and and God anointed
[40:08] Elijah to stretch out his arms, lay
[40:11] across that child, and then God came and
[40:14] and rose that child back to to life
[40:17] again. Amen.
[40:22] You know, we have
[40:24] some of the greatest faith, some of the
[40:26] greatest ways to build faith is to
[40:29] listen to these stories, to listen to to
[40:31] the stories that our Elijah gave to us.
[40:34] Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You know, that's just a great way start
[40:36] listening to the prophet's life and and
[40:38] hear hear some of his stories, his life
[40:40] story, the visions and the supernatural
[40:42] works that took place. Amen. Because we
[40:44] are supposed to type Elisha. Amen.
[40:46] There, brother Benam talks about that.
[40:47] We type Elisha. Amen. And our Elijah did
[40:50] the same thing. Amen. He he tells us
[40:52] these stories like when he went to
[40:53] Africa and he disobeyed he disobeyed God
[40:56] and and how he had to go around and and
[40:58] and there was so much pressure from all
[41:00] those preachers. Amen. But but he still
[41:02] went and went ahead and did it. And then
[41:04] when he got back home and how he had he
[41:06] was so sick for so long or or or that
[41:08] story I was just listening to that story
[41:10] where where where this this boy I think
[41:12] his name was Oscar and he came to
[41:14] brother Brandham and he said, "I lost my
[41:15] horse." and he was ba way back in the
[41:17] mountains and and and the the the guide
[41:20] was making fun of him and he was saying,
[41:22] you know, you're never going to find
[41:24] your horse. It's been months ago. The
[41:25] snow is too thick. There's no way you're
[41:27] ever going to find your horse. And he
[41:28] looked over at brother Brandham because
[41:30] his mom was healed in Brother Brandham's
[41:31] meetings and and he says he says,
[41:33] "Brother Brandham, you know, pray that
[41:35] Oscar get his horse back. Pray pray
[41:37] that." And he said, and brother Bham
[41:39] looked over at him. He says, "Oscar, you
[41:40] believe that?" Oscar says, "I believe. I
[41:43] I believe that." And so he prayed and
[41:45] and the the the Lord came down and and
[41:47] and spoke. And then a few months later,
[41:50] he got a letter. Brother Vam got a
[41:52] letter from this boy that God had given
[41:53] him his horses back in an impossible
[41:55] situation. Amen. Those kinds of things.
[41:58] Amen. Build your faith because that's
[42:00] the rubber meeting in the road. Those
[42:02] are situations. Amen. When we pray, when
[42:04] we have need of things, we don't always
[42:06] have need of these great miraculous
[42:07] things. Those things can happen and they
[42:09] will happen. But sometimes I just need
[42:11] some I need some God with flesh on it.
[42:13] Amen. I need some God with skin on it. I
[42:15] need some um I lost my horse. I lost my
[42:18] keys. I lost this. I need you, God, to
[42:20] move. And then God will move.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Those those kinds of testimonies, they
[42:27] can really have impact. I mean, faith
[42:29] cometh by hearing. Amen. And hearing the
[42:31] word of God. There there's something in
[42:34] you that that that when you hear those
[42:36] things, you just know that that you're
[42:37] part of it. Amen. I'm part of this. That
[42:39] that's part of me. something calling in
[42:41] me that that's I know that I'm part of
[42:44] that. Amen. You know, but one thing
[42:46] about those testimonies, you know,
[42:48] they're they're meant to be they're
[42:50] meant to be more than just stories.
[42:52] Amen. They're meant to lead you to the
[42:54] God of those stories.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; You know, he says in one place in this
[42:58] sermon I'm about to quote, "We don't
[43:00] just need the teachings and doctrines.
[43:02] Those are important and we do need
[43:03] those. But what we NEED IS THE GOD of
[43:05] Elijah." Amen. In this this verse, I'm
[43:07] going to get into it in a minute. He He
[43:09] calls upon God and he says he says where
[43:13] is the God of Elijah? Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes situations where we
[43:18] need to bring th that reality into our
[43:21] life. Amen. To bring those stories and
[43:24] bring it as a reality into our life.
[43:26] Amen. This quote here, brother Bham says
[43:28] in the secondhand robe 1956, he says,
[43:30] "Now notice in Elijah then after he
[43:33] threw his robe on him and tried it on
[43:35] him." In other words, Elijah the prophet
[43:37] who had the mantle of God on his
[43:39] shoulders, he came down and he laid
[43:41] across laid it across Elisha the farmer
[43:44] to see if it would fit him. And it taken
[43:47] about 10 years to get altered to fit
[43:50] that mantle. Amen. You know, God usually
[43:52] puts us up in the shop and trims us
[43:54] trims us up a bit. He says now he says
[43:57] now he didn't alter his robe to fit
[44:01] Elisha. He altered Elisha to fit the
[44:05] robe. Amen. That's a powerful point
[44:07] because he says that's what he does
[44:09] today. He alters you to fit the robe,
[44:13] not the robe to fit us. Sometimes we
[44:15] want to make the robe fit us, but we
[44:18] can't do that.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; You've got to be let yourself be altered
[44:23] for the robe. It's God's robe. The
[44:25] garment, the robe is the word. It's
[44:27] God's word. It's a perfect word. Amen.
[44:30] Don't try to fit the word into your
[44:32] life. If you want the word in your life,
[44:34] then you step into the word and it
[44:36] becomes your life. Amen. Amen. It
[44:38] transforms you. Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; He's got to bring us into that realm to
[44:45] make the robe fit us. Amen.
[44:48] He was transforming Elisha. Amen.
[44:52] He's trying to, it says he's it was God
[44:53] trying to bring him into that realm. And
[44:55] you know, he says that word realm, a
[44:57] realm is is a kingdom. And you know,
[44:59] it's God, he's bringing you out of the
[45:01] world and he's bringing you into his
[45:02] kingdom. Amen. He's revealing himself to
[45:04] us. He's unveiling himself to us to
[45:06] transform us to fit the word. Amen. And
[45:10] that I feel like sometimes that's the
[45:12] problem. You know, just speaking to
[45:13] myself, that's the problem. Sometimes we
[45:15] come face to face with ourselves, our
[45:17] faults, our flaws, and we have this
[45:20] opportunity. I've said this here before.
[45:21] We've had this opportunity to grow or to
[45:23] mature, but we can sometimes get
[45:25] stagnant in our Christian walk. We're
[45:27] not letting the Lord trim us up anymore.
[45:30] Amen. We can get so complacent in our
[45:33] growth. You know, Elisha here referring
[45:35] back to Second Kings again. You know, it
[45:37] was coming time for the translation of
[45:39] Elijah and God inspired him to go from
[45:43] place to place in this journey. Amen.
[45:45] Remember I spoke on that said I I was
[45:47] reading that. It says first it was
[45:49] Bethl. Amen. And then it was Jericho and
[45:52] then it was Jordan. And each time he got
[45:54] to those places,
[45:56] he gave Elisha a way out. He gave him
[46:00] that Elijah used that term tarry here.
[46:03] You see, he gave Elisha a justification,
[46:06] an excuse to stay where he was. Amen.
[46:10] God was giving Elisha the choice to stay
[46:13] back living in his previous experience.
[46:16] But he says, 'I want you to notice here,
[46:18] God is he's calling us to come over
[46:20] calling us to come up higher because and
[46:23] I I wanted to quote this on a Sunday
[46:24] school there if there's always a there's
[46:28] always a longing in your heart for more
[46:30] of God. Amen. There's always a longing
[46:31] in my heart for more of God. And brother
[46:33] Bham says, "If there's a longing in your
[46:35] heart for more of God, then there's more
[46:38] of God to fill that longing. God is
[46:42] inexhaustible." Amen. You think you've
[46:44] reached a place of complete maturity,
[46:47] God is inexhaustible. Amen. He still
[46:49] wants to trim you up a little bit. He
[46:51] still wants to transform you. He still
[46:52] wants to change you. Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; There's a desire. He says this in that
[47:00] same sermon, there's a before there's a
[47:02] desire in your heart for more of God,
[47:03] there's got to be a more of God to
[47:06] respond to that desire. Amen. There'll
[47:08] always be a reason. There'll always be
[47:10] an excuse or a justification to stay
[47:13] where you are. Amen. But God wants you
[47:16] to continue to grow into his image.
[47:18] Amen. He could have justified staying in
[47:20] Gilgal because Elijah told him, "Terry
[47:22] here." You read that and you're like, he
[47:24] keeps telling him that, "Terry here.
[47:26] What are you, what are you talking
[47:27] about?" He's given him that way out. But
[47:29] every time he gets to a new stage in his
[47:32] spiritual walk, he he knew there was
[47:34] more of God for him. Amen. He knew that
[47:37] that he hadn't crossed Jordan. He knew
[47:39] that the garment hadn't been passed. He
[47:41] had been hearing about it for 10 years.
[47:43] He knew that this wasn't it. He knew he
[47:45] needed to keep walking with Elijah. He
[47:47] knew he needed to keep walking with the
[47:49] word as the word walked. Amen. To keep
[47:51] moving with the word. Amen. And he makes
[47:54] that declaration to Elijah, I will not
[47:56] leave thee. Amen. See, and and and I
[47:59] think I have this point here in just a
[48:01] few minutes, but you know that there was
[48:02] the noise of the world. They kept
[48:04] saying, you know, your your master, your
[48:06] head, he's going to leave. Amen. And
[48:07] there's always the noise and the clatter
[48:09] of the world. But sometimes you just got
[48:11] to you got to separate yourself from
[48:13] that. You got to ignore that and you got
[48:14] to just keep walking with the word.
[48:16] Sometimes when God is trying to call you
[48:18] from one place into another like when he
[48:20] tried to call when he called Abraham, he
[48:22] called him out of Amen. He was going to
[48:24] have to leave his family. He was going
[48:26] to have to leave everything behind
[48:27] because he had a position. Amen. He was
[48:30] going to appoint him a great position,
[48:31] but he had to leave something behind.
[48:33] Amen. Sure.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Elisha couldn't think that way. He had
[48:38] already felt the power of God. Brother
[48:40] Bham says he knew there was more for
[48:42] him.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; And in order to get
[48:47] to that next place, he's going to give
[48:49] you he's going to God is going to give
[48:51] you the word. He's going to give you
[48:53] everything you have need of. But you
[48:55] have to make the decision to keep moving
[48:57] forward.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; That you want to move into that next
[49:01] stage. The word is there and the word is
[49:04] perfect. Amen. There is no fault in the
[49:06] word. Amen. The fault is in us if we
[49:09] don't want to walk with the word. As he
[49:11] begins to express himself to us. Amen.
[49:13] As he unveils himself to us, as he
[49:15] recognizes that there's faults and
[49:17] failures in my life, I want him to tell
[49:20] me about him so that I can grow. And if
[49:22] I can come to this place and I look into
[49:24] a mirror and God says, "You need to trim
[49:26] that place up. But if I don't want to,
[49:28] then I'm at Gilgal. And if I do the same
[49:31] thing here then and I don't want to then
[49:33] I'm then I'm at Jericho. Amen. But you
[49:35] got to move to Jordan. Amen. You got to
[49:38] move across Jordan. Amen. There's more
[49:40] of God for you.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; In order for Elisha to be able to
[49:48] receive the garment, it wasn't up to
[49:50] Elijah. He said it. He says that it's
[49:52] not up to me. It was in God's hands.
[49:55] Amen. And once he got over into Jordan
[49:57] and Elijah was trans translated, the
[50:00] garment of that word was passed down
[50:03] from Elijah to Elisha.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to just catch this
[50:08] because that same garment that was used
[50:11] to part the waters in Elijah's ministry,
[50:15] remember when they walked across Jordan,
[50:16] he had he had laid his clo laid his clo
[50:19] coat down and and it almost like split
[50:21] the Red Sea and they walked across it.
[50:23] And this was this was going to be that
[50:25] same garment that was used to part it in
[50:29] Elisha's ministry. It was the same word
[50:31] that was parting it here was the same
[50:34] word that was going to part it here. The
[50:36] the the the incredible thing wasn't that
[50:38] the word could accomplish it. Elisha
[50:41] walked with Elijah, watching the word
[50:43] accomplish what it was accomplishing all
[50:46] of that time. The incredible thing was
[50:48] if he was going to have enough faith to
[50:50] possess the word and to accomplish it in
[50:53] his own life. Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; The incredible thing is if you take the
[50:57] word. Amen. I know you believe it. I
[51:00] know you hear it. I know you see it. But
[51:02] are you going to possess it for
[51:03] yourself?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you going to use it to part
[51:06] the same waters in your life?
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you going to use it TO PART
[51:10] THE TRIALS? ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT TO
[51:12] PART THE ENEMY? AMEN.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; It's the same word that was used to
[51:19] transform our Elijah. Brother Man is the
[51:21] same word that we take and we possess
[51:24] it. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] Amen.
[51:33] There was a testing time. Amen.
[51:39] When he got towards the end of that
[51:41] journey and and and
[51:43] the testing time came to see if he was
[51:45] ready to see if that old Elisha was
[51:48] really gone forever. Amen. To see if
[51:50] that old self had really broken away
[51:53] from him. He stood the test. Amen. When
[51:56] the noise was there and he just he
[51:59] silenced the noise. Amen. And when he
[52:01] take when he crossed over Jordan and he
[52:03] and he took the garment, he picked the
[52:05] garment up. Amen. And and there was
[52:07] there was probably a lot of mind battles
[52:09] going on at that point. Oh, where's
[52:11] Elijah? Why is not why I can't do this
[52:14] without Elijah? How am I going to how am
[52:16] I going to do this without Elijah? But
[52:17] he they're that same faith that operated
[52:21] in Elijah came down in Elisha and he
[52:25] says, "WHERE IS THE GOD OF ELIJAH?" AND
[52:28] HE TOOK THAT same word and he parted
[52:30] those same waters. Hallelujah.
[52:36] Amen.
[52:38] And when given the opportunity, like I
[52:40] was saying, to to stay where he was, he
[52:42] said, "No." Amen. I want to I want to I
[52:46] want to walk with the word. Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time as as it's time to to to
[52:51] to really manifest the word in our in
[52:54] our lives, the reality, I want to be a
[52:56] part of it. Amen. I want the word to
[52:58] operate in my life. I don't want it to
[53:01] just be something I hear, something I
[53:03] see. You know that I have this in my
[53:05] notes. I just keep getting sidet. I'm
[53:07] sorry. But you you had all those
[53:09] onlookers. And if you notice when they
[53:11] went from Gilgal, those prophets were
[53:13] still with him.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when when he went from from
[53:16] Gilgal to to to to Jericho, those
[53:19] prophets were still with him. They still
[53:20] were there. When he went from to to to
[53:23] to Jericho to Jordan, they were still
[53:25] there. when they crossed Jordan, they
[53:27] were still there, but there was two that
[53:29] crossed over Jordan. Amen. So, a lot of
[53:32] times what happens is we can get caught
[53:34] up in I'm not talking about anybody
[53:36] here, just this is how the Lord put on
[53:37] my heart. WE CAN GET CAUGHT up in
[53:39] onlooking the message of the hour. Amen.
[53:42] We see, WOW, THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WOW,
[53:44] THAT'S THAT'S TRUE. I believe that. I'm
[53:46] going to keep walking with the word.
[53:48] That looks good. That sounds good. I'm
[53:50] going to keep walking to to Jericho. I'm
[53:52] going to keep walking TO JORDAN. BUT BUT
[53:55] WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR YOU TO CROSS
[53:57] JORDAN, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT YOURSELF.
[53:59] HALLELUJAH. You've got to cross over.
[54:02] And once you get over there, YOU GOT TO
[54:04] TAKE THE WORD. YOU HAVE TO TAKE the
[54:06] garments that Elijah took. YOU HAVE TO
[54:09] PICK IT UP FOR YOURSELF. YOU HAVE TO
[54:11] WALK AND LET THE Lord operate that in
[54:13] your life. It's not some It's not some
[54:15] crazy far out there faith. Brother
[54:17] Random says it's a simple faith and a
[54:20] simple word TO LET GOD DO THE WORK IN
[54:23] your life. Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; It's a harmony. Amen. I'm just going to
[54:27] preach because it's in my notes. It's a
[54:28] harmony between you and the word.
[54:31] Remember there in the church age BOOK,
[54:32] BROTHER MINHAM TALKS ABOUT THE HARMONY
[54:34] towards the end time. How there's going
[54:36] to be a harmony with the bride and his
[54:38] word. Amen. And and Ezekiel talks about
[54:41] that HOW AT THE END time he he sees this
[54:44] wheel and it was a wheel in the middle
[54:46] of a wheel. Amen. The middle of THAT
[54:48] WHEEL IS CHRIST. AMEN. AMEN. And and
[54:51] we're the spokes of that wheel. And if
[54:53] you go look at an old wagon wheel, as
[54:55] those spokes begin to get closer and
[54:58] closer to Christ, amen, because we're
[55:01] supposed to come into harmony with the
[55:03] word. Amen. As you get closer and closer
[55:06] to Christ, you're growing into that
[55:08] image. Amen. He's burning away all the
[55:11] desires of the world, you're growing.
[55:13] You know, Brother B says that in the
[55:14] church a book, he says that that that
[55:16] that you do what he wills. He knows. We
[55:20] know the will of God because we see it,
[55:23] we believe it, we walk with it. Amen.
[55:25] So, we just do as the word says do.
[55:27] Amen. We know his will and she will only
[55:30] do his will. Amen. And then, so as you
[55:33] get closer to Christ, if you notice,
[55:35] those spokes actually get closer to
[55:37] Christ. They also get closer to each
[55:39] other.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those spokes, they begin to get
[55:43] closer to each other.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a harmony that begins to
[55:47] take place. Amen. And that that's what's
[55:49] supposed to happen in the life of
[55:51] believers. Amen. We can always sometimes
[55:53] we can get so caught up in in that
[55:56] brother's fault, that brother's failure.
[55:58] And you know what that is? That is the
[56:00] devil trying to keep you from being in
[56:03] one mind and in one accord. AMEN. I'VE
[56:05] GOT FAULTS. YOU GOT FAULTS. I KNOW THAT.
[56:08] AMEN. But God doesn't want you to focus
[56:10] on the faults. Amen. He wants you to
[56:13] focus on him. He wants you to be in one
[56:16] mind and in one accord. Because when you
[56:19] get in one mind and in one accord, amen,
[56:22] the impossible begins to happen. What
[56:25] happened in Acts 2 and in Acts 4 WASN'T
[56:28] IT WASN'T SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE HOUSE
[56:30] SHOOK. It was incredible THAT THEY LEFT
[56:32] THE HOUSE AND THEY DID THE WILL OF GOD.
[56:35] AMEN.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's incredible when God can
[56:39] come into YOUR LIFE AND YOU CAN TAKE
[56:40] YOUR VISION off of the faults and
[56:43] failures of your brother and sister and
[56:45] focus that energy
[56:48] &gt;&gt; towards the enemy that's trying to get
[56:50] you distracted.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we're supposed to do.
[56:54] Amen. We're supposed to, brother Ben
[56:55] says in the contest, he says we're
[56:57] supposed to know the enemy. We're
[56:59] supposed to know his tactics. WE'RE
[57:00] SUPPOSED TO STUDY HIM. We're supposed to
[57:02] study his glicks and know when he's
[57:04] going to do an uppercut and when he's
[57:05] going to do a cross. Amen. And when he
[57:07] does, you're supposed to recognize it
[57:09] and you're supposed to duck and you're
[57:11] supposed to change. Amen. That's what
[57:13] OPPONENTS DO. THEY STUDY EACH OTHER. And
[57:15] that's what we're supposed to do. We're
[57:17] supposed to recognize that that's the
[57:20] devil coming into your mind, coming into
[57:23] your soul and charge your spirit and
[57:25] trying to disrupt the harmony.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's trying to disrupt THE
[57:32] HARMONY THAT GOD IS TRYING TO GET YOU in
[57:36] one mind and in one accord. Amen. As
[57:39] that wheel begins to go and it begins to
[57:42] go to the center. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[57:45] you get closer to that center. Oh, and
[57:47] it gets closer TO EACH OTHER. THE
[57:49] OPERATION just begins to be so seamless.
[57:52] Amen. It begins TO BE SUCH A harmonious
[57:55] uh thing that's happening. Amen. And
[57:58] that's what it's going to be when we
[58:00] take our translation. Amen. We're going
[58:02] to finally be into a place where I'm not
[58:04] looking at your fault. I'm not looking
[58:06] at your failure. You're not looking at
[58:08] my fault. You're not looking at my
[58:10] failure. I know we got them. I GET THAT.
[58:12] AMEN. BUT I WANT TO GROW OUT OF THEM.
[58:14] AMEN. I WANT YOU TO PRAY FOR ME. I want
[58:16] to pray for you. When I see you fall,
[58:19] when I see you're not living right, when
[58:21] I see you're not dressing right, you
[58:22] know, I don't I don't think in my mind.
[58:24] We all have thoughts in our mind. But
[58:26] what I do? I take that thought into
[58:28] subjection and then I pray for you and I
[58:30] say, "Lord, I want I want I want that
[58:32] brother I want that sister to come to
[58:35] the knowledge of the truth." AMEN. IT'S
[58:37] NOT A me versus you mentality. It's not
[58:40] a I'm better than you mentality. It's
[58:42] you're my brother, you're my sister, and
[58:44] I want you to come to the same knowledge
[58:46] of the truth that I have. Amen. Or that
[58:49] your sister or that your brother has.
[58:51] AMEN. IT'S NOT THIS GOD. IT'S NOT ABOUT
[58:54] BEING ON THIS PLAYING field where this
[58:56] one's higher and this one's lower.
[58:58] YOU'RE ALL EQUAL. AMEN. GOD IS JUST
[59:00] TRYING TO GET YOU TO BE TRANSFORMED, TO
[59:02] BE MATURED. AMEN.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Who wants that in their life? I want
[59:09] that. Amen. I want the maturity of the
[59:11] Lord. I WANT THE OPERATION OF THAT
[59:13] GARMENT TO take place in my life.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:26] They watched it from a distance. Amen.
[59:30] You know, it's we often we may not even
[59:32] realize it, but
[59:35] we're identified with something
[59:37] incredible. Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; And rest assured, people recognize
[59:41] something different in us. Amen. They
[59:43] they they may not they may not they may
[59:46] not even realize what it is. Amen. but
[59:48] they watch your life. And
[59:52] not to be not this this to be a
[59:53] negative, but when when that life
[59:55] doesn't match up with what they're
[59:56] expecting, we ought to go back to
[59:58] Jordan.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And make sure that we've actually
[1:00:02] crossed over.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to make sure that we're
[1:00:05] not part of the group like those
[1:00:07] prophets were that were just gazing at
[1:00:09] it from a distance. Amen. Because they
[1:00:11] watched the same miracles. They saw the
[1:00:13] same works. I mean, they were pretty
[1:00:15] close to Elijah and Elisha. If they were
[1:00:17] talking to Elisha saying, you know, your
[1:00:19] master is going to leave you tomorrow.
[1:00:21] They were they weren't just, you know,
[1:00:23] you know, in the distance. They were
[1:00:24] walking with them. Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; But they too went over on dry ground.
[1:00:33] Amen.
[1:00:41] Amen.
[1:00:43] Sometimes it just takes us breaking
[1:00:45] free. I'm just sorry we're going kind of
[1:00:47] late. Lord, be with us. We're just going
[1:00:49] to have just a few more minutes here.
[1:00:52] [clears throat] Elisha determined in his
[1:00:54] heart to walk with that word. Amen.
[1:00:57] Sometimes sometimes what happens is we
[1:00:59] just need to break free from the
[1:01:02] influence a little bit like Elisha did.
[1:01:05] Amen. We need to break free from caring
[1:01:08] what other what other people think or
[1:01:10] say. You know, your walk with God is
[1:01:13] with you and God. It's not even with
[1:01:16] your wife and you and God. It's with you
[1:01:18] and God. And everything else is
[1:01:20] secondary to it. Amen. Sometimes we need
[1:01:23] to break free from the influence. Amen.
[1:01:25] And I just want to point this out here
[1:01:26] because we're all susceptible to to that
[1:01:28] influence from time to time. Sometimes
[1:01:30] it's not even a it's not even a you
[1:01:33] don't even know why. You're not sure
[1:01:34] why. You're just not you're not you're
[1:01:36] not feeling like you should praise. You
[1:01:37] know, there's just there's just some
[1:01:38] kind of a an in an influence. Amen.
[1:01:40] That's the devil. Amen. And we're all
[1:01:42] susceptible to that.
[1:01:45] And sometimes we're not sure what maybe
[1:01:46] people would think or say about us. Even
[1:01:48] in church,
[1:01:50] [clears throat]
[1:01:53] when you feel led to worship in a
[1:01:55] certain way or, you know, however you
[1:01:57] think in your minds that you're being a
[1:01:58] bit strange or we're being shy, like
[1:02:00] someone has their eye on us, sometimes
[1:02:02] that's how it is. It feels like
[1:02:03] someone's got their eye on you, right?
[1:02:06] But this is the house of God. Amen. And
[1:02:08] when we come into your into the house of
[1:02:10] God, and I'm not saying you got to
[1:02:11] worship a certain way. You worship
[1:02:12] however way you want to worship. Amen.
[1:02:14] You just let God do the one to choose
[1:02:16] it. Amen. If if there if you worship a
[1:02:18] certain way, worship that way. Amen. But
[1:02:20] when we come into the house of God,
[1:02:22] we're not here for a show. I am not here
[1:02:24] for a show tonight. I prayed and I
[1:02:26] studied and I there was nothing I could
[1:02:28] say tonight that would be a blessing.
[1:02:29] But I just yielded as a vessel. Amen.
[1:02:31] That God would come. Amen. And that's
[1:02:33] what you come here today to do. Amen.
[1:02:35] We're on the same playing field. Amen.
[1:02:37] We yield ourselves as vessels so that
[1:02:39] God can come and speak to us. Amen.
[1:02:41] We're not here for our brother or for
[1:02:42] your for our sister. I'm not here for
[1:02:44] you tonight. As much as you as much as I
[1:02:47] am here for you tonight, I'm not I'm
[1:02:48] here for God. I'm here for him to speak
[1:02:51] to me. Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; We have one purpose. And and sometimes I
[1:02:54] like I was saying, it just takes a
[1:02:55] little bit of courage to break free from
[1:02:57] that shackle in our minds.
[1:03:00] And I just thought about this. Let me if
[1:03:03] you think about a a a wildfire or just a
[1:03:06] fire in general general when I when I
[1:03:08] was a before I became a fireman I had to
[1:03:10] go through uh the fire academy and they
[1:03:13] they talked about fire and the process
[1:03:15] of how it spreads. Amen. And it need it
[1:03:18] needed at this point when I went through
[1:03:20] it. It's I guess it's been like nine or
[1:03:21] 10 years now. It needed fuel, heat, and
[1:03:24] oxygen. Those are the three elements
[1:03:27] that are needed in a fire. Amen. And I
[1:03:29] remember when we were going through it
[1:03:31] and we were learning about fire, they
[1:03:32] called it the fire triangle. Amen. And
[1:03:35] that was that was, you know, because if
[1:03:37] you look at those three things, it's
[1:03:38] those three things that that you put
[1:03:40] them together, and that's what keeps the
[1:03:42] fire going. Then what happened is is a
[1:03:44] few years later, you know, I I graduated
[1:03:46] recruit school, I became a fireman, and
[1:03:47] then we're I'm just working. And I I
[1:03:49] started working with this other one,
[1:03:51] this other fireman, and he was just
[1:03:53] going through his recruit school, and
[1:03:54] they had made an amendment to the the
[1:03:56] academy book. They made a midmmitment to
[1:03:59] the formula. It was no longer a
[1:04:01] triangle. It was no longer three
[1:04:03] elements. It the because what happened
[1:04:05] was they recognized that if those three
[1:04:07] elements, even if they were together,
[1:04:08] they were laying dormant, it wouldn't
[1:04:10] always produce what it was supposed to.
[1:04:12] They recognized it took a little bit
[1:04:14] more. So what they did is they added the
[1:04:16] fourth part to this formula. What they
[1:04:19] realized is that it took some unseen
[1:04:21] force to bring the elements together.
[1:04:24] Amen. Just just catching some types
[1:04:26] here. Brother Brandham, I was listening
[1:04:27] to him last night. He's a typologist.
[1:04:29] I'm a student of brother Brandham. So,
[1:04:31] I'm a typologist student. Amen. Is that
[1:04:33] all right? Amen. So, you add they added
[1:04:35] this fourth part to the formula. They
[1:04:37] realized that it was that it was a a it
[1:04:40] took a chemical chain reaction of those
[1:04:43] of those elements brought together to
[1:04:46] make fire. Amen. because they recognize
[1:04:48] that they they could have those three
[1:04:50] things, but if there wasn't some kind of
[1:04:52] unseen force, if there wasn't some kind
[1:04:54] of chain reaction to bring them together
[1:04:57] to create combustion, then it would go
[1:05:00] out or it wouldn't even continue. Amen.
[1:05:02] And so, the same thing happens in our
[1:05:04] lives. We could have all the right
[1:05:05] elements in our life. AMEN. BUT WE'VE
[1:05:08] GOT TO HAVE THAT unseen force to come in
[1:05:11] and to blend it all together. Amen. You
[1:05:14] got to You could have all the right
[1:05:15] elements. You could be coming to the
[1:05:16] church. You could be doing the right
[1:05:17] things, but unless you have all the
[1:05:19] right you unless you have that unseen
[1:05:21] person, unless you have Christ living in
[1:05:24] you, operating you, then you'll never
[1:05:26] have that fire. Because when that fire
[1:05:29] begins to grow, Amen. And if you don't
[1:05:31] take one of those elements away from it,
[1:05:34] you just continue to have those
[1:05:35] elements, it keeps getting bigger and
[1:05:37] bigger and bigger. The fire develops and
[1:05:40] it develops. Amen. And you have to come
[1:05:42] up with strategies because when you're
[1:05:44] fighting fire, fire has a mind of its
[1:05:46] own. It hey you, you know, you can learn
[1:05:48] about it, but you also can recognize
[1:05:50] that it's strong and it's powerful and
[1:05:52] it it becomes like a wildfire. It just
[1:05:55] eats everything. It just goes and it
[1:05:57] continues. And it's the same thing in
[1:05:59] church. Amen. When we come together, we
[1:06:01] bring our licks of fire together. Amen.
[1:06:04] And if we can just put our mind into
[1:06:06] subjection to say it's not my brother or
[1:06:10] my sister, they're not thinking ill of
[1:06:12] you if you're going to worship. You
[1:06:14] know, if you come to the altar, you
[1:06:15] know, even if you came last week, it
[1:06:17] doesn't matter. God is trying to work on
[1:06:20] your life. And that's what I'm happy
[1:06:22] about. Amen. I'm happy that God is doing
[1:06:24] a work in your life. Amen. I'm happy
[1:06:27] that he's doing a work in my life. I'm
[1:06:29] your brother. Amen. I'm in the same
[1:06:31] wheel that you're in. We're we're
[1:06:33] striding together. I'll never make it to
[1:06:35] that center completely without you.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And you'll never make it without me.
[1:06:40] Thank God.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Good thought.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; You got to be in harmony. Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] When it comes to this message, the
[1:06:56] message in order for us to come into the
[1:06:59] image the Lord has for us. Amen. and and
[1:07:02] you know, we watch it transform our
[1:07:05] lives. It's it's applied. Amen. It's the
[1:07:07] application into every aspect into our
[1:07:09] marriages and our child raising and our
[1:07:12] family dynamics because this is just my
[1:07:14] last point. I'm five minutes. Amen.
[1:07:17] God's intention five minutes. Amen.
[1:07:19] We're going to close in five minutes.
[1:07:21] Praise God. Praise God. Okay.
[1:07:25] God's intention wasn't just to bring the
[1:07:27] message. We accept it and the rapture
[1:07:29] takes place. Amen. The intention was
[1:07:32] that you take the word, you come into
[1:07:34] harmony with the giver of the word and
[1:07:36] then
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; to fulfill his work and his purpose in
[1:07:39] your life.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; He wants to operate. I have that quote.
[1:07:44] I was really botching it when I was
[1:07:46] talking about the church age book there.
[1:07:48] I have that quote if anybody wants it,
[1:07:49] but it just just to paraphrase. The word
[1:07:51] is in the bride as it was in Mary. The
[1:07:53] bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:07:55] knows what he wants done with the word.
[1:07:58] She performs the command of the word in
[1:08:00] his name. For she has thus sayaith the
[1:08:02] Lord. Then the word is quickened by the
[1:08:05] spirit. It comes to pass like a seed
[1:08:07] that is planted and watered. It comes to
[1:08:09] full harvest serving its purpose. So it
[1:08:14] comes to harvest and then it serves its
[1:08:17] purpose. Amen. You come to the Lord.
[1:08:20] Amen. You cross Jordan. Then you can
[1:08:22] actually serve your purpose for Christ.
[1:08:24] Your life doesn't even begin until you
[1:08:26] start serving his purpose. Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wants to operate. I thought
[1:08:30] about the life of Jesus there. How, you
[1:08:32] know, he spent 30 years in training, but
[1:08:36] it wasn't so that he could come into his
[1:08:38] ministry and immediately go to the
[1:08:40] cross. Amen. He had a three and a half
[1:08:42] years of ministry of operating the word
[1:08:45] in his life. Amen. Jesus's ministry was
[1:08:48] that 30 years of preparation, but then
[1:08:51] three and a half years of manifestation.
[1:08:53] Amen. And the word is not supposed to be
[1:08:56] all preparation. It's supposed to be
[1:08:58] some manifestation. Amen. We're supposed
[1:09:00] to manifest the the life of Christ in
[1:09:02] our lives, in our attributes, in our
[1:09:05] character, in how we conduct ourselves.
[1:09:07] Amen. In how we operate, in our prayer
[1:09:10] life, in all of those avenues. Amen. And
[1:09:12] that's what I want for my life. Amen. I
[1:09:14] DON'T WANT TO JUST COME INTO THE LORD
[1:09:16] AND THEN GO. I want him to do a work
[1:09:18] through me. I want to fulfill his
[1:09:20] purpose. Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] to manifest Christ in our life. Amen.
[1:09:27] You know, and you think about all those
[1:09:28] amazing experiences that happened during
[1:09:31] those three years of that Jesus's
[1:09:33] ministry is awesome. Amen. You know, and
[1:09:35] and sure, he had a lot of trials and
[1:09:37] sure he had to go to the cross and sure
[1:09:39] he had to do all those things that were
[1:09:40] very difficult. Amen. But think of all
[1:09:42] those times that he got to sit there
[1:09:44] with his disciples and just expound on
[1:09:46] the word and and he got to walk with
[1:09:49] them and he got to break bread with
[1:09:50] them. Amen. and he got to share with
[1:09:52] them the the the eternal thoughts of
[1:09:54] God. Amen. Think of some of those times.
[1:09:57] That is what God wants to do with you.
[1:09:59] He wants to share the eternal thoughts
[1:10:01] of God with you.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And you even think about all the things
[1:10:07] in that took place in Elisha's life
[1:10:09] after Elijah was translated after he
[1:10:13] possessed the garment and started
[1:10:15] operating in in his life. Amen. Then his
[1:10:19] ministry begins. Amen. He He takes you
[1:10:22] to Bethl. So he gives you experiences.
[1:10:24] He takes you to to Jericho. He builds on
[1:10:27] those experiences. You cross Jordan. You
[1:10:29] receive the Holy Ghost. But once Elisha
[1:10:32] received that garment, then his ministry
[1:10:34] began. Amen. And now that God is
[1:10:37] operating in your life, now the work can
[1:10:40] start because he's the operator. Amen.
[1:10:43] when it gets out of cater then we're
[1:10:45] trying to operate something and it just
[1:10:47] always messes up because that's what I
[1:10:48] do. I mess things up. But God, when he
[1:10:50] works, he makes it all come together.
[1:10:53] He's that unseen force. He's that he's
[1:10:55] that chemical chain reaction that brings
[1:10:57] those elements and makes it something
[1:10:59] beautiful.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And each of us have a ministry.
[1:11:03] Amen. It's not a it's not a maybe not a
[1:11:06] pulpit ministry, but we have a ministry
[1:11:08] as we continue to grow into the position
[1:11:10] of Christ. Amen. We're on a training
[1:11:13] ground. Amen. And the word and we're
[1:11:14] still on that. But it's meant to lead
[1:11:17] you to more than just the teachings.
[1:11:20] It's meant to lead you more than just
[1:11:21] the doctrines. It's meant to lead you to
[1:11:23] the God of Elijah.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; I want the God of Elijah. Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; And then you can start applying it in
[1:11:30] your everyday life.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] Amen. Let's just stand to our feet.
[1:11:38] Sorry to hold you so I only preached an
[1:11:41] hour. Amen. So sorry to hold you so much
[1:11:43] though.
[1:11:52] Just thought about that. How just play
[1:11:55] whatever's whatever's on your heart is
[1:11:57] good. when [clears throat] Elijah and
[1:11:59] Elish when Elisha took that mantle up
[1:12:01] and the crowd of prophets there were
[1:12:03] watching
[1:12:04] and Elisha came to his his first this
[1:12:06] would be his first opportunity to apply
[1:12:09] the word himself in his life. Amen. This
[1:12:13] was the first opportunity to apply and
[1:12:15] he spoke something in him spoke. I'm
[1:12:18] sure there was fear there. I said that

[1:14:37] Maybe you saw each hand, you saw each
[1:14:39] heart, Lord Jesus. Maybe there's [music]
[1:14:40] some trimming up that you want or need
[1:14:42] to do in some lives tonight, Lord God.
