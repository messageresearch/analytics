[15:47] Lord,
[15:49] I pray that your Holy Spirit would sweep
[15:51] through the place, comfort every heart,
[15:54] heal every sick person. Father,
[15:57] we've heard many times the prophet of
[15:59] this age talk about if we have faith to
[16:03] believe that all things are possible,
[16:06] every person that was sick would be
[16:08] healed. Every person that was struggling
[16:13] would not struggle anymore. We praise
[16:16] you this morning. Thank you for the
[16:17] resurrection.
[16:19] But we thank you, Father, that you sent
[16:21] your spirit back and is with us today.
[16:24] Pray that you bless the cheerful giver
[16:26] as we collect the tithes and offerings.
[16:28] Bless those that are streaming. And
[16:31] Lord, when you open up the word of life
[16:33] today, bless that gift. Move the man
[16:35] aside. Move us aside to receive what you
[16:38] have for us. In Jesus name we pray.
[16:41] Amen.
[16:44] Amen. You can have your seats as brother
[16:46] Luther comes.

[16:52] for the next special this morning.

[21:51] Ask brotherh John if he play his violin
[21:55] while he gets ready. I just want to
[21:57] share something real quick. just a 30
[21:59] second little I got really convicted
[22:02] over the weekend and it's Easter, you
[22:05] know, and when you're a Christian
[22:07] sometimes you just forget and I started
[22:11] praying. I'm like, man, this Easter,
[22:13] this is like the most important holiday,
[22:15] right, for what we represent and stand
[22:18] for. And uh so I went for a drive
[22:21] yesterday morning. And I was praying and
[22:23] crying and and um and just started
[22:26] thinking about what Easter meant to me
[22:29] that first year as a Christian and that
[22:32] second year as a Christian and what
[22:34] Easter like really genuinely meant. And
[22:38] uh it was funny this morning, you know,
[22:40] I just got up. I thought, "All right,
[22:42] I'll go. You know, I have a little bit
[22:43] more healing to do with my foot because
[22:45] I've been staying home a lot." But um
[22:48] all of a sudden, I get this text.
[22:49] Brother Kenny asked me to to sing a
[22:51] special and I'm like, "Okay."
[22:55] So, what we're going to do this morning
[22:57] is you have the words the old rugged
[22:59] cross. We're going to sing a
[23:00] congregational special and y'all are
[23:02] going to help. So, everybody stand up.
[23:05] [Music]
[23:08] It's in B flat. Sis,
[23:11] you love the Lord. Aren't you glad that
[23:14] he rose naturally and that you have the
[23:17] opportunity for him to rise in your
[23:19] heart? Amen. That's the goal. For him to
[23:22] live inside of you.
[23:25] I want to heal
[23:28] far away
[23:32] stood an old
[23:35] rugged cross.
[23:39] the emblem
[23:42] of suffering
[23:45] and shame.
[23:47] [Music]
[23:51] When I love
[23:55] that old cross
[23:58] where the dearest
[24:00] [Music]
[24:02] stand and best
[24:04] for a world
[24:07] of lost sers
[24:11] was slain.
[24:14] Sing it with all your heart. So I'll
[24:18] cherish
[24:20] that old rug in R
[24:28] [Applause]
[24:29] my trophy.
[24:32] At last I
[24:35] lay down.
[24:36] [Music]
[24:38] I will cling I will cling
[24:43] to the ruged
[24:47] cross
[24:49] [Music]
[24:52] and exchange
[24:54] it someday
[24:57] for the ground.
[25:01] Think about it.
[25:03] Will that old
[25:06] rugged cross
[25:09] so despised
[25:12] by the world
[25:15] has a wondrous
[25:18] attraction
[25:21] for me.
[25:26] Oh, the deep
[25:29] lamb of God
[25:32] left his glory
[25:36] above
[25:39] to bury
[25:42] to dark calary.
[25:49] [Applause]
[25:53] We all run
[26:01] till my trophy.
[26:05] At last I
[26:08] lay down.
[26:12] I'm going to cling
[26:16] to that
[26:19] wrong
[26:24] and exchange
[26:26] it someday
[26:29] for
[26:30] a crown.
[26:33] Think about these words now.
[26:36] When that old
[26:38] rugged cross,
[26:41] it was stained with blood
[26:44] so divine.
[26:48] A wonderous
[26:51] beauty
[26:53] I see. Think about what we just sung.
[26:59] Quote was on
[27:01] that old cross.

[30:45] and he said, "Go free. You're the one
[30:49] I'm dying for.

[46:35] God bless you all. Turn around, shake
[46:38] hands with somebody. Amen. Say, wish him
[46:42] a wonderful Easter.
[46:45] My goodness,
[46:48] what an hour to be a Christian.
[46:52] Praise God.
[46:56] My all these beautiful faces and all
[46:59] that wonderful singing. Our visitors, we
[47:01] say welcome. Amen. Good to have you,
[47:04] Mark. Good to hear with your have you
[47:06] here with your friends and all the
[47:07] different ones. So, hope you made it
[47:09] safe. Praise the Lord. Glad to have you
[47:10] and see your family there gathered with
[47:13] you. All of our uh as brother Random
[47:16] called them our pretty little Easter
[47:17] flowers today.
[47:20] I sure enjoy the ministry of children.
[47:23] Amen. And you know, Jesus said, "Unless
[47:26] you come like that, you'll you'll never
[47:29] be able to get in." Amen. You're going
[47:31] to have to have a childlike faith. And
[47:34] so, we appreciate all the wonderful
[47:37] worship and the singing. Amen. Brother
[47:40] Bradley, you ruined me with that song,
[47:42] buddy. I just want you to know that's
[47:44] one of my all-time favorites. I can't
[47:46] hardly sing it and stay in one piece.
[47:48] Amen. I love I love friends the old
[47:53] rugged cross. It means everything to me
[47:56] that day on Calvary.
[47:58] My what a day. And then to follow that
[48:01] as if that wasn't wonderful enough to
[48:03] follow that with the resurrection that
[48:05] we're here in consideration today, the
[48:08] greatest single event in human history.
[48:11] Good news. He is risen. Not he has
[48:15] risen. He is risen. Amen. Not just a
[48:19] It's not just a historical event. Um
[48:22] he's risen and living among us.
[48:26] We want to
[48:28] take up a couple prayer requests just
[48:30] before I uh break into my sermon. I let
[48:34] me also quickly give you a really good
[48:37] report from Brother Brad in the field
[48:40] down there um in Honduras. I believe
[48:43] there with brother Eric Gallow. And
[48:45] brother Brad sent back just a glowing
[48:47] report to the ministry team this morning
[48:50] and uh they had a wonderful time and I
[48:52] think he's ministering again this
[48:54] morning but he was saying last night
[48:56] that uh it was just it was just and even
[48:59] they are saying it was maybe the
[49:01] greatest youth meeting they've ever held
[49:03] there. So, we're tr thanking the Lord
[49:06] and trusting him now that all the seed
[49:09] of the word that was sown that the Holy
[49:12] Spirit will now water it day and night
[49:14] and it'll grow a crop. All a preacher
[49:16] can do is sew the seed. He can't He
[49:18] can't make it grow in you. He can't All
[49:20] I can do is preach it. It'll be up to
[49:22] the Holy Spirit to water it and up to
[49:24] you to love it and follow it, nurture
[49:27] it, keep it. Amen. you know, um, so
[49:31] Jesus talked about the four different
[49:33] areas where seed can fall. And to me,
[49:36] one of the most dreadful places is by
[49:38] the wayside because
[49:40] it just uh the seed that fell by the
[49:42] wayside is, you know, it's basically
[49:45] someone who heard the gospel and it
[49:47] meant very little to them at all. And as
[49:50] soon as they get out of church, the the
[49:52] the devil comes and just takes the seed.
[49:55] Jesus called it like the fowls of the
[49:57] air, but we know that's an allegory for
[49:59] demon spirits. And it'll just take that
[50:01] word and just carry it away and you'll
[50:04] forget that you even felt anything or
[50:06] heard anything from the word of God.
[50:08] That's a that's a dreadful place. So
[50:10] today, we're going to believe for better
[50:12] things. Amen. Going to believe that when
[50:15] the word goes forth, it'll find a a good
[50:18] bedding ground and it'll grow. Friends,
[50:20] it's good seed. The gospel is good seed
[50:24] and it'll grow. It'll grow a crop. It'll
[50:26] grow the life of God in your life, your
[50:30] everyday walking, talking life. That's
[50:32] what it's all about. Amen. Not unrested
[50:35] in a form of godliness. I want the real
[50:37] deal. Amen. Praise the Lord. We have a
[50:40] couple prayer requests. Brother Jason
[50:42] Dears is asking for prayer for his trip
[50:45] to Egypt. He leaves tomorrow, be gone
[50:47] through May 5. wants traveling mercies
[50:49] and prayer for the services and the
[50:51] ministers meeting as well as his family
[50:53] in his absence. Sister Lisa St. John,
[50:56] their house is dealing with that stomach
[50:58] flu that we had going around here a week
[51:00] or so ago. So, we all know to be praying
[51:03] for that. Sister Elizabeth Johnson is
[51:06] asking prayer for Brother Winston. He's
[51:08] getting ready to start some some
[51:10] treatments for some uh some growth that
[51:13] they found and uh they're going to start
[51:15] treating that. Amen. and she's asking
[51:17] for the Lord's mercy and all of that.
[51:19] And I just said we're going to pray that
[51:21] our brother will go forward with the
[51:23] perfect mind of Christ in leadership. Is
[51:25] that how you'll pray this morning? Amen.
[51:28] We're going to um invite you to Hebrews
[51:31] 2. Amen. But let's uh let's just call on
[51:34] the Lord right now. Master,
[51:39] we thank you this morning for your great
[51:42] grace to us. It is at times
[51:46] indescribable. It's certainly
[51:48] incalculable.
[51:49] What would we say to it, Lord? It seems
[51:51] to defy all sense of reason and logic
[51:54] that you loved us even when we were
[51:56] sinners. You died for us before we were
[51:59] born. Lord, you were buried and rose for
[52:02] our justification.
[52:04] You ascended on high. You sent back your
[52:07] spirit into the church that it might not
[52:09] just be a God above or even merely a God
[52:14] with, but now it can be the very God
[52:17] living in us. That's our great quest of
[52:20] life to allow the word of God to
[52:24] effectively, as Paul said, let the word
[52:27] of God dwell in you richly. So the word
[52:31] of God must be a person then, Lord. It
[52:33] has to be none other than the person of
[52:36] the Lord Jesus Christ. It can never be
[52:38] minimalized to just doctrine. Father,
[52:41] it's not. The word of God is more than
[52:43] just doctrine. The word is a person. In
[52:46] the beginning was the word. It was with
[52:48] God. And in fact, it was God, Lord. So,
[52:51] we're asking that the person of the word
[52:54] live in us today. Get your have your
[52:57] perfect will. Get glory to yourself,
[53:00] master, through the word that will come
[53:02] forth today by a believing people who
[53:05] will believe it and accept it, realize
[53:07] it and be grateful in their hearts. Now,
[53:09] it's a banner day, Lord. Many have
[53:12] gathered out today for this uh for a com
[53:16] a commemoration of this epic event.
[53:19] Lord, the greatest single day in human
[53:21] history when you rose from the tomb. And
[53:24] Father, you you ascended. You said, "All
[53:27] power in heaven and earth is given unto
[53:29] me. Because I live, you shall live
[53:32] also." Now, we're asking for your great
[53:35] mercy on our lives today. Lord, you
[53:37] heard our sick request. We're thinking
[53:40] of the home of the St. John family. were
[53:44] father thinking of brother and sister
[53:47] Johnson there Lord this morning that you
[53:49] will guide them brother Winston and
[53:51] sister Elizabeth in your perfect will
[53:54] asking prayer Lord for mercy for brother
[53:58] JD on traveling for the meetings we're
[54:01] asking for your continued mercy for
[54:03] brother Brad Lord as he's finishing up
[54:05] the meetings today and we'll be
[54:06] traveling home I pray master that you
[54:09] will bless us one and all we commit it
[54:12] to you now Lord Lord, as we turn to the
[54:14] word, I'm just
[54:17] Lord trying to trying to remove myself
[54:20] from the equation. Get out of the way
[54:21] and let you be the leader. I pray you'll
[54:24] grant that to me, Father. I'm just
[54:26] trying to find the perfect path. Much
[54:28] more material than we can cover today,
[54:31] but we just want your perfect path
[54:33] through it. We're going to follow you
[54:35] wherever the spirit leads me. That's my
[54:37] promise to you, Lord. And I ask that
[54:39] you'll bless it in Jesus name. Amen. God
[54:43] bless you, friends. We're going to look
[54:44] in Hebrews chapter 2 this morning.
[54:48] Amen. We have some wonderful fellowship
[54:51] planned for after service and so trust
[54:55] that uh everybody be able to stay
[54:57] around. Amen. And uh eat some free food
[55:01] and have some good fellowship. Praise
[55:03] the Lord. Uh it's a it's a it's a more
[55:06] of a loose event kind of a potluck style
[55:09] thing is that I at least that's my take
[55:11] on it. Amen. But uh if we run out of
[55:13] food, we'll go get some more. Amen.
[55:16] Praise the Lord. In Hebrews chapter 2,
[55:22] uh we're going to look from uh I just
[55:24] want to read the 17th verse there in
[55:26] Hebrews chapter 2 and then we're going
[55:28] to go quickly to second Corinthians 5.
[55:31] Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 17.
[55:39] Wherefore in all things it behooved him
[55:43] to be made like unto his brethren, that
[55:46] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[55:50] priest in things pertaining to God, to
[55:54] make reconciliation
[55:56] for the sins of the people.
[55:59] Amen. Second Corinthians chapter 5.
[56:05] Amen.
[56:06] and we'll catch verses. I have here 18
[56:09] and 19.
[56:12] Let's start at 17. Uh, brother Mark,
[56:14] we'll start at 17. Read down through 19.
[56:18] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[56:21] is a new creature. Old things are passed
[56:24] away. Behold, all things are become new.
[56:28] And all things are of God, and ha who
[56:31] hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[56:35] Christ, and hath given to us the
[56:38] ministry of reconciliation, to that God
[56:42] was in Christ, reconciling the world
[56:45] unto himself, not imputing their
[56:49] trespasses unto them. Thank God. And
[56:52] hath committed unto us the word of
[56:56] reconciliation. Now let's read on verse
[56:58] 20. Now then we are ambassadors for
[57:02] Christ as though God did beseech you by
[57:05] us. We pray you in Christstead that ye
[57:08] be reconciled to God. For he hath made
[57:12] him to be sin for us who knew no sin
[57:16] that we might be made the righteousness
[57:19] of God in him. That's uh that's
[57:23] astonishing. Amen. that God would trade
[57:27] someone who was completely innocent and
[57:29] he would swap him for a people who were
[57:32] completely guilty.
[57:33] Amen. And he traded the innocent for the
[57:35] guilty. That's the love of God in
[57:38] reconciling the world. Let's pray once
[57:41] more. Father, having read your word, I
[57:43] commit myself now into your hands. Lord,
[57:46] may you use this vessel. We heard such a
[57:49] wonderful Sunday school lesson this
[57:51] morning. There's already been enough
[57:53] word preached that we could go home and
[57:55] be satisfied and be blessed. But we
[57:57] believe that you have brought us to this
[57:59] hour in this moment to hear something
[58:01] further from your word. Help me to be
[58:04] concise and direct and follow your
[58:06] leading. I surrender myself to you again
[58:09] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[58:11] friends. You can be seated.
[58:39] We've been working on a series of modern
[58:43] events are again made clear in prophecy
[58:47] and um it was it was my purpose to uh to
[58:52] go more deeply into that. Today we are
[58:55] going to take the title that I sent to
[58:57] the booth. This will be the fourth
[58:59] installment. But um I I you're going to
[59:02] see this morning that the message is
[59:05] going to lean more into the the the
[59:08] holiday not I don't want to call it a
[59:09] holiday season that that cheapens the
[59:11] resurrection but and we're not just here
[59:14] to celebrate a man-made event. And uh
[59:18] because that day on Calvary, his death,
[59:22] his burial, his resurrection was not I
[59:24] mean it was anything but a man-made
[59:26] event.
[59:27] It was ordained of God. It was carried
[59:29] out by a man and who humbled himself to
[59:33] the death of the cross for you and I.
[59:35] God, very God in flesh, dying for the
[59:38] sins of the world to reconcile the world
[59:41] unto himself. And I want to lean heavily
[59:43] today into that ministry of
[59:46] reconciliation because it's been
[59:48] committed to us. So what he did was so
[59:52] that you not only could be part of him
[59:55] but so that you could carry the gospel
[59:57] on.
[59:57] Amen. And so I want you to really absorb
[1:00:00] that today that what Easter meant is not
[1:00:03] about you know um everybody is in church
[1:00:08] even even the even the people who don't
[1:00:11] hardly go to church are in church on
[1:00:12] Easter you know and so uh so I I heard a
[1:00:17] preacher one time you know on Easter and
[1:00:19] he said I want to wish everybody happy
[1:00:21] birthday and and uh merry Christmas and
[1:00:24] happy anniversary and he said I I say
[1:00:26] all that now because I know I won't see
[1:00:27] you again until next Easter. But uh
[1:00:31] we're going to believe better things for
[1:00:33] everybody today. All right. So, we
[1:00:36] realize that the the ministry of
[1:00:38] reconciliation is something that he did
[1:00:41] to pave the way for God to redeem the
[1:00:44] whole world. Jesus died for the sins of
[1:00:47] the whole world. Now there's no doubt
[1:00:50] the scripture is very clear and it draws
[1:00:54] sharp lines of demarcation between
[1:00:56] various categories of humanity. Uh and
[1:01:00] and we we we could talk about the elect
[1:01:02] lady as John called her. We could talk
[1:01:05] about those who are granted eternal life
[1:01:07] at the judgment. And the Bible would say
[1:01:10] enter into the joys of the Lord prepared
[1:01:12] for you since the foundation of the
[1:01:14] world. And that's true uh because he
[1:01:16] will grant mercy to everyone who appeals
[1:01:19] for mercy. God will never send a man to
[1:01:21] hell who doesn't want to go there. Uh as
[1:01:23] long as that man or woman is willing to
[1:01:26] take God's provided way and his
[1:01:28] atonement. Now you can't escape it on
[1:01:30] your own. You have to take God's
[1:01:32] provided way. And so, so, but then we
[1:01:36] then then we realize that there's a next
[1:01:39] level of the redeemed family, the elect
[1:01:41] of Christ, the bride of Christ, who were
[1:01:43] part of uh of his genes. And the Bible
[1:01:46] says of them and only of them that that
[1:01:49] that they were ordained before, not just
[1:01:52] since, but before the foundation of the
[1:01:55] world. Now, the only other person that
[1:01:58] the entire Bible says that about is
[1:02:00] Jesus. And in two places it says it
[1:02:03] about him and in one place it says it
[1:02:06] about his elect lady.
[1:02:08] Amen. So, so we realize then that
[1:02:10] there's various categories. There's
[1:02:12] those who will gain eternal life for
[1:02:15] various deeds. Not that they earn their
[1:02:18] way uh into heaven because you cannot
[1:02:20] earn uh salvation by any means. It can't
[1:02:23] be earned that way. But but I'm glad
[1:02:26] that the that the great judge who knows
[1:02:29] the secrets of all hearts will be the
[1:02:30] final arbiter. I'm glad it's not me.
[1:02:33] Amen. I'm glad it's not you because I
[1:02:35] could easily misjudge you. You could
[1:02:36] easily misjudge me. It happens all the
[1:02:39] time.
[1:02:40] Amen.
[1:02:41] But I'm glad that there's one who knows
[1:02:43] the end from the beginning. He knows the
[1:02:45] very secrets of our heart. And he will
[1:02:48] judge the world by and according to
[1:02:50] their heartfelt response to the word of
[1:02:53] God. That's true in every age. At
[1:02:55] whatever level he revealed it, and he
[1:02:58] reveals it at various levels to
[1:02:59] different people, but at whatever level
[1:03:02] he revealed himself, uh, he will judge a
[1:03:06] person by their heartfelt response to
[1:03:09] that revelation.
[1:03:10] And I'll just leave it up to him.
[1:03:13] How about we just leave it up to him?
[1:03:16] I just want to do this. I want to serve
[1:03:18] him night and day. I want to look for
[1:03:20] his coming every morning. I I love him.
[1:03:23] I he my whole life is dedicated to him
[1:03:25] and to me that's what makes Easter so
[1:03:28] valuable not that it was a an event on
[1:03:31] the calendar. You know something friends
[1:03:34] a lot of times we look at the
[1:03:36] resurrection as an event on the calendar
[1:03:39] and when will it happen but the
[1:03:41] resurrection is not merely an event on a
[1:03:44] calendar though there is a date known
[1:03:46] unto God. Jesus said it's known unto the
[1:03:48] father when that time will come. But
[1:03:51] it's not merely a date on a calendar
[1:03:54] because Jesus actually said of himself,
[1:03:57] I am the resurrection.
[1:03:59] So the resurrection is more than an
[1:04:01] event on a calendar. It's a happening
[1:04:03] and it's happening right now. And I want
[1:04:06] to be part of the resurrection.
[1:04:09] And as such, then the ministry of
[1:04:11] reconciliation is committed to me as
[1:04:14] Paul said to be an ambassador of his
[1:04:17] life. Because once his life came back
[1:04:19] into the earth there in the early church
[1:04:22] then then it was God made flesh again in
[1:04:25] people. Not now now not just one lowly
[1:04:29] Nazarene walking the shores of Galilee
[1:04:31] going about doing good. Uh they wanted
[1:04:34] to make Jesus a king at that time. He he
[1:04:36] knew that that wasn't the father's plan
[1:04:38] because he said unless a corn of wheat
[1:04:40] died abideth alone. So, you know, he's
[1:04:43] he's going to talk a lot about the
[1:04:45] cyclical uh process of nature. We're not
[1:04:48] going to venture into that today. That's
[1:04:50] really uh in the nuts and bolts of of
[1:04:52] our prophecy series. But but at the same
[1:04:55] time, you just know this, friends. And
[1:04:58] here's something that Easter I I want it
[1:05:01] to to really become real to you today is
[1:05:04] that Calvary was not an accident. And
[1:05:07] the resurrection wasn't just an event.
[1:05:09] and and and the the the outpouring of
[1:05:12] the Holy Spirit in the day of Pentecost
[1:05:14] wasn't just an event that happened. It
[1:05:17] was a purpose-driven.
[1:05:19] It had a a goal and it was accomplished.
[1:05:22] And God had set the whole thing in
[1:05:24] motion. And God does nothing without a
[1:05:27] reason.
[1:05:28] You're here today for a reason. And I
[1:05:31] will suggest to you that it's a reason
[1:05:33] far more uh than what you might think
[1:05:36] that the reason is. You're you might be
[1:05:39] here today because oh I've got friends I
[1:05:41] want to see I've got family well it's
[1:05:43] Easter well it's this well it's that
[1:05:45] well you might even you might even have
[1:05:47] a more noble cause and say well I want
[1:05:49] to hear the word I want to fellowship
[1:05:50] the people I want to worship God I'm
[1:05:52] just going to say to you that it even
[1:05:54] exceeds that it exceeds anything that we
[1:05:57] could imagine in our own minds and I
[1:06:00] just want to have my heart positioned uh
[1:06:03] before the Lord we we've talked a lot
[1:06:06] about the humility of the heart.
[1:06:09] And I'm going to watch my time very
[1:06:10] closely. I uh we we gave uh the worship
[1:06:13] leaders some extra time today to because
[1:06:15] it's it's a special day. We wanted to
[1:06:17] have a lot of singing and worship. So
[1:06:19] I'll I'll monitor my time. We're not
[1:06:21] going to wear you out. I you I promise
[1:06:23] you. But but we find that we've been
[1:06:26] talking a lot about uh you know the
[1:06:29] approach to God and we found ourselves
[1:06:32] visiting again and again the first
[1:06:35] church service in Genesis 4 where two
[1:06:39] men came and offered worship and praise
[1:06:42] and brought a sacrifice and built an
[1:06:44] altar. One was received and one was
[1:06:46] refused outright. And you know and I I
[1:06:49] I'm not here to to relive all of that.
[1:06:52] We've been covering it. Today would be
[1:06:54] our fourth installment in it. But one of
[1:06:56] the things that we have found out is
[1:07:01] that God is is is is looking for the
[1:07:05] response. When he when he came to to
[1:07:08] Abel, Abel responded by uh obeying the
[1:07:14] word of God. Cain would not respond. And
[1:07:17] so we have been saying to you that
[1:07:22] prophecy, any series on prophecy has to
[1:07:25] begin at that first church service
[1:07:28] because it's that first church service
[1:07:31] that is going to give actual reason and
[1:07:34] purpose behind all of the history in
[1:07:37] prophecy. And in fact is you'll find an
[1:07:41] interesting thing in prophecy and when
[1:07:43] prophets come and we're we're going to
[1:07:46] look at Ezekiel 32. We won't get to it
[1:07:48] today. I'll just mention it briefly. But
[1:07:51] in the in the book of Ezekiel uh the
[1:07:54] 32nd chapter and I'll just maybe make
[1:07:56] this note. I'm just trying to feel my
[1:07:58] way forward. So I hope you're good with
[1:08:00] that. But we find that that even in the
[1:08:03] book of Ezekiel chapter 32, he's going
[1:08:06] to deal with a lot of nations. Uh he's
[1:08:10] going to deal with Elum. He's going to
[1:08:12] deal with the Babylonians. He's going to
[1:08:14] deal with the Egyptians. He's going to
[1:08:15] deal with the Assyrians. And he's going
[1:08:17] to he's going to say, it's almost like a
[1:08:20] pronouncement. It's almost like a
[1:08:22] declaration where he's going to say, you
[1:08:25] know, Babylon, I've got a message for
[1:08:27] you. and Sidon, I've got a message for
[1:08:30] you. And Egypt, I've got a message for
[1:08:32] you. And and basically, he goes down a
[1:08:35] list to say, for for evil causes and
[1:08:39] terrorizing the world, here will be your
[1:08:42] sentence.
[1:08:43] And then he'll go from Egypt to Babylon
[1:08:44] and for for evil events and for terror
[1:08:47] in the world and for putting terror in
[1:08:49] the hearts of men, this is going to be
[1:08:50] your sentence. and Elum this for and he
[1:08:53] keeps he keeps repeating it you know for
[1:08:55] for evil that you did in the world and
[1:08:57] for terrorizing the world this is going
[1:08:59] to be your sentence and none of none of
[1:09:01] them I got about you know I think
[1:09:02] there's seven or eight cases none of
[1:09:06] them end well
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:08] and all of them follow the prophecy
[1:09:12] follows the history and then the future
[1:09:15] followed the prophecy
[1:09:17] because in some of the cases he's
[1:09:20] actually talking about a judgment that's
[1:09:22] already passed.
[1:09:24] And he's correlating what you saw happen
[1:09:27] to this prophecy. In case you were
[1:09:28] wondering why did this happen to Egypt,
[1:09:31] here's the here's why. In case you're
[1:09:33] wondering why did this happen and then
[1:09:35] he and then he talks about the present
[1:09:37] day. And there's some kingdoms in the
[1:09:39] present day that at the time of the
[1:09:41] prophecy are seem to be doing just fine.
[1:09:44] You not just like this country, like the
[1:09:46] present world seems to be fine. Seems
[1:09:48] like it should be able to go on forever.
[1:09:50] But it won't. It can't.
[1:09:51] That's right.
[1:09:52] And so he was saying those in the
[1:09:54] present day, here's going to be your
[1:09:56] future according to prophecy. And then
[1:09:58] he even looks way into the future and he
[1:10:00] starts talking about nations that will
[1:10:03] suffer. And the the common denominator
[1:10:06] is that they're all going to end up in
[1:10:08] the pit.
[1:10:09] That's right.
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:11] They're all going to the same place for
[1:10:13] the same reason. And he's not going to
[1:10:15] break down all of the, you know, it's
[1:10:17] not about a a microscopic look. It's
[1:10:20] just going to be a a quick overview. In
[1:10:22] fact, is what is what left me a couple
[1:10:25] of things left me astonished. I thought,
[1:10:27] you know, that's just exactly like a
[1:10:29] prophet would do. A prophet would uh be
[1:10:34] he would roll in the ways that would
[1:10:37] that would um that would, you know,
[1:10:40] certify Hebrews 13:8 thousands of years
[1:10:44] later when Paul pinned it.
[1:10:46] Amen.
[1:10:46] That Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:10:48] today, and forever. And so when Ezekiel
[1:10:50] comes on the scene, he's talking about
[1:10:52] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:10:54] He's yesterday, the past, the present,
[1:10:56] and in the future.
[1:10:58] The book of Revelation does the same
[1:10:59] thing. The book of Revelation talks
[1:11:01] about the past, the present, and the
[1:11:02] future. And and even when a prophet came
[1:11:05] in our day and preached modern events
[1:11:06] made clear in prophecy, he went back to
[1:11:08] the past, came to the future. I mean,
[1:11:10] came to the present, and showed the
[1:11:12] future. Amen.
[1:11:13] That's right.
[1:11:13] And so the the the lesson to take away
[1:11:16] from that is that there are no
[1:11:18] accidents. There are only Gods.
[1:11:21] And all history and all the present day
[1:11:23] and all the future days, whatever remain
[1:11:26] of them are controlled not partially,
[1:11:30] not major in a majority, but entirely by
[1:11:34] prophecy.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:35] You have to understand that God already
[1:11:37] has it all worked out. It's already the
[1:11:40] drama to him is already finished up a
[1:11:42] long time ago. In his mind, we're
[1:11:44] already on the other side shouting for
[1:11:45] joy.
[1:11:46] Hallelujah.
[1:11:46] Oh, hallelujah. But but God has to work
[1:11:49] it out. He has to allow it to come
[1:11:51] through time because he's he's got to be
[1:11:54] just, you know, he came as a man. And as
[1:11:57] Paul said, he Paul used the Old
[1:11:59] Testament allegory of a of a high
[1:12:01] priest. And and he says, you know, he
[1:12:04] became a high priest and he became a
[1:12:06] human being so that he could know what
[1:12:09] it was like to suffer. Now, let me just
[1:12:12] say this that God being God didn't have
[1:12:15] to do that to know something.
[1:12:18] You understand? God didn't have to live
[1:12:21] in flesh to know what it would be like
[1:12:23] to live in flesh. He's God. But his
[1:12:26] justice required him to play that out
[1:12:29] because that's the right thing to do.
[1:12:31] See, so he's got this plan of
[1:12:33] redemption. And so to to he doesn't have
[1:12:36] to do it, but to do the right thing,
[1:12:39] Lord, you're going to have to do the
[1:12:40] right thing. I mean, Abraham said that
[1:12:42] of him when Abraham is hearing that that
[1:12:45] that uh Sodom is about to be
[1:12:47] annihilated. And Abraham just starts
[1:12:50] saying, you know, you can't you can't
[1:12:52] fool me. I know you too good. That be
[1:12:54] far. You're not going to punish the
[1:12:56] innocent with the guilty. That be far
[1:12:58] from you. It's almost sounds like
[1:12:59] Abraham is arrogantly defying God. He's
[1:13:02] not doing that at all. Abraham knows
[1:13:05] this one that he has loved and served
[1:13:08] and and lived for. And he knows that
[1:13:10] that this just God would never punish
[1:13:13] the innocent with the guilty.
[1:13:16] He's not going to do that. and and now
[1:13:18] now the world is full of trauma and a
[1:13:21] lot of people suffer but that's the
[1:13:22] cruelty of sin that's never uh that was
[1:13:25] not God's intention friends when God
[1:13:27] made it he made it beautiful
[1:13:30] and so so we realize that he came down
[1:13:33] and lived as a man because that's the
[1:13:35] right thing to do to make to to serve
[1:13:38] his justice to make to make his judgment
[1:13:41] just he's going to live it himself and
[1:13:45] he's going to overcome the devil Not by
[1:13:47] his divine power, but he's going to
[1:13:49] prove that it can be done just by
[1:13:51] following the word.
[1:13:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:54] So that the whole world will then it
[1:13:57] will be a justifiable sentence of guilt
[1:14:00] for the world who never took God's
[1:14:02] provided way.
[1:14:03] Amen. And and so so when we look at it
[1:14:06] like that, you know something, friends,
[1:14:09] it's um it you know, God sometimes, you
[1:14:13] know, as a child of God and and I've
[1:14:16] been making this point over and over
[1:14:18] again, and I really would I really feel
[1:14:20] impressed to make it today.
[1:14:22] It's a it's it looms large in my mind.
[1:14:26] And so, as many times as you've heard me
[1:14:28] say it, hear me say it again. There were
[1:14:31] only two altars. Yes. Amen.
[1:14:34] There's no middle one.
[1:14:36] Amen.
[1:14:36] See, so it's either you're going to
[1:14:39] believe every word of God or you won't.
[1:14:42] All right. So, if you believe every word
[1:14:45] of God and accept God's provided way,
[1:14:48] then your sins go ahead of you to the
[1:14:51] judgment. And by the time you arrive,
[1:14:52] they're already met in Christ. And you
[1:14:54] take your place on the throne
[1:14:56] because you've passed from death to
[1:14:58] life. And you can never come into the
[1:15:00] judgment. See, so your life is already
[1:15:03] atoned for in Christ because you took
[1:15:05] the way of his word, God's provided way.
[1:15:08] Uh but but then if if you don't do that,
[1:15:12] then you subject yourself to a maybe.
[1:15:15] Yeah.
[1:15:15] You know, maybe he'll find a way. He
[1:15:19] wants to find a way to save you,
[1:15:21] but why would you take that chance? Why
[1:15:23] would you show up at the judgment bar?
[1:15:26] Do you realize how large the stakes are?
[1:15:28] Yeah.
[1:15:29] Do you realize that that when you when
[1:15:32] you if you receive a judgment of guilty
[1:15:35] at that judgment bar, there's no appeal.
[1:15:39] It's the final judgment.
[1:15:41] So his you say, "Well, then how do I
[1:15:44] avoid being judged there? Be judged
[1:15:48] here.
[1:15:49] Let this judge and rule your life." And
[1:15:52] if you will surrender to this and let
[1:15:54] this be your judgment seat and you'll do
[1:15:57] that here and now while there's mercy,
[1:15:59] then you won't have to stand there and
[1:16:01] then when there's no mercy and it's
[1:16:03] based on the merits of your thoughts and
[1:16:05] deeds and your heart and how you
[1:16:06] responded to God.
[1:16:09] I would never take a chance on this on
[1:16:12] the second choice
[1:16:15] because I am I am too aware I am too
[1:16:18] painfully aware that of my mistakes. and
[1:16:22] my weaknesses and my failures. And I'm
[1:16:25] so aware of them that for me there is no
[1:16:28] choice. I will take the way. I will
[1:16:30] stand before the word of God now. I will
[1:16:32] let it judge my life. I will allow it to
[1:16:34] tell me how to live. Yep.
[1:16:37] I will let it tell me how to act, how to
[1:16:39] speak, how to go, what to do, what not
[1:16:41] to do. If it says don't do it, I won't
[1:16:43] do it.
[1:16:44] Amen.
[1:16:44] And and if I make a mistake, I'll
[1:16:46] repent. Try to not do it again.
[1:16:48] That's right.
[1:16:49] But I'm determined to come. God's
[1:16:51] provided way. That's what Easter Easter
[1:16:53] has given you that ability. Before no
[1:16:56] one even had that ability. You couldn't
[1:16:58] even come to God. Even if you lived a
[1:17:00] righteous life, you could never enter
[1:17:01] into his presence.
[1:17:03] And you were held in a paradise. True.
[1:17:06] You were held, but you were still in the
[1:17:08] lower parts of the earth. But when
[1:17:10] Christ died, he that ascended first
[1:17:12] descended into the lower parts and and
[1:17:16] uh kicked down the door of Satan, took
[1:17:18] the keys and released his family and
[1:17:20] then ascended with his family. That's
[1:17:22] what is my desire. I want to ascend to
[1:17:26] the father. Oh, hallelujah, friends. I
[1:17:28] want that meeting in the air. I'm glad
[1:17:30] for Easter 2,000 years ago. But what
[1:17:33] what does that do for me? That's fine
[1:17:35] for Jesus that he rose, but how does
[1:17:38] that help me if I don't rise in him?
[1:17:44] So, this is precisely why as a child of
[1:17:47] God, he will not accept you trying to
[1:17:49] live somewhere in the middle.
[1:17:51] Amen.
[1:17:53] Because there's no middle altar.
[1:17:55] There's only two. And so this is this is
[1:17:59] precisely why as a child of God,
[1:18:04] as a child of God, the Bible says the
[1:18:06] devil's children does with him whatever
[1:18:08] he wants to do.
[1:18:10] But as a child of God, he will not
[1:18:13] accept you trying to live somewhere in
[1:18:17] the middle, some quasi middle, no man's
[1:18:20] land, uh between the world and the word.
[1:18:23] You got one foot in one and one foot in
[1:18:25] the other. That's the most miserable
[1:18:26] existence possible.
[1:18:28] Oh, escape condemnation and come all the
[1:18:31] way into Christ today.
[1:18:33] It's precisely why. Because there was
[1:18:36] not two altars. That's why he will never
[1:18:38] accept you trying to live somewhere in
[1:18:40] the middle. This is why God will
[1:18:41] sometimes even through painful means if
[1:18:45] necessary not allow you. So, he will not
[1:18:49] only will he not accept you living in
[1:18:52] the middle, he will not allow you to
[1:18:54] live somewhere in the middle. Rest
[1:18:56] assured, friends, that if you're his
[1:18:59] child, you're going to stop loving your
[1:19:01] life.
[1:19:03] Amen.
[1:19:05] That was the an identifying marker. They
[1:19:07] love not their lives unto death. That's
[1:19:09] the faith chapter that Paul talks about.
[1:19:11] That's the number I want to be in.
[1:19:13] See, they they Moses made that choice.
[1:19:16] He looked on the riches of Egypt. And he
[1:19:18] decided that the suffering uh for with
[1:19:21] the children of Israel was a of a
[1:19:23] greater reward than all the riches of
[1:19:25] Egypt.
[1:19:26] See, and so he the Paul said they loved
[1:19:30] not their lives unto death. And he has a
[1:19:33] vision of you. And uh and though you
[1:19:35] were born in sin, separated from him, he
[1:19:38] pursues you to get you to cooperate in
[1:19:41] the vision that he sees of you. He's
[1:19:44] trying to get you to walk in the will
[1:19:47] that he has laid out for your life. And
[1:19:51] you can trust him
[1:19:53] that that that his path for your life is
[1:19:57] the best one.
[1:20:01] See,
[1:20:03] it's not always that it looks like the
[1:20:05] the most fair one. See, but it's the
[1:20:09] best one. Reconciliation.
[1:20:12] So when we think about reconciliation,
[1:20:15] what does that mean? Well, you know,
[1:20:17] reconciliation when it has finished its
[1:20:20] course, it'll be a time where uh on the
[1:20:24] other side, a prophet said, "All wrongs
[1:20:27] will be made right."
[1:20:30] Hallelujah. I'm so glad that there's
[1:20:33] going to something's going to happen to
[1:20:34] my record in the world. Now, I know that
[1:20:38] in the mind of Christ, I'm already in
[1:20:40] the clear. But I'd like to be clear uh
[1:20:43] everywhere. I'd like to wake up every
[1:20:45] day and my body is my mind are clear.
[1:20:49] All wrongs are made right and mistakes
[1:20:51] I've made and jammed my own life up,
[1:20:53] it'll be unjammed. Hallelujah. All the
[1:20:56] problems that we caused oursel.
[1:20:59] Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] All the times where we failed and you
[1:21:02] say the devil may be and probably no, he
[1:21:06] didn't. He can't. If you're a child of
[1:21:07] God, he can't get into you. He'd have to
[1:21:10] come through the blood of Christ. Then
[1:21:11] he'd be your brother.
[1:21:12] He said you went out to him. How many
[1:21:14] times have we stepped away from the
[1:21:16] presence of God and allowed the enemy to
[1:21:19] take us down a road and then But
[1:21:21] thankfully, God's mercy always calls to
[1:21:23] us. It pursues us everywhere we go. It
[1:21:27] won't leave me alone night and day. I
[1:21:29] say, "Lord, ever take whatever from me.
[1:21:31] You have to drive sleep away. What? By
[1:21:33] whatever means necessary. Don't let me
[1:21:36] go the wrong way.
[1:21:38] Amen.
[1:21:39] It's when all wrongs will be made right.
[1:21:41] It's when the unrealized realities of
[1:21:44] all that I was in his image, in the
[1:21:46] image of everything he saw of me before
[1:21:49] the foundation of the earth. When that
[1:21:52] image has come to pass, that's
[1:21:54] reconciliation.
[1:21:55] Amen.
[1:21:57] It's when all questions will be
[1:21:58] answered. and
[1:22:00] and and you know I I used to think and
[1:22:05] I I found even an old note as I I don't
[1:22:08] even remember when I wrote it but I was
[1:22:10] you know talking about the the the the
[1:22:12] how and the the why you know so how did
[1:22:17] how did you how did you save me? I want
[1:22:19] to see the whole process, Lord. And oh,
[1:22:22] I went through this and I went through
[1:22:23] that. And then a lot of times we run
[1:22:25] into situations in life. You may be here
[1:22:28] today facing one.
[1:22:30] And the question that plagues mankind
[1:22:34] has for millennia is the why.
[1:22:36] Yeah.
[1:22:37] Why did I suffer that?
[1:22:39] Yeah.
[1:22:39] Because not knowing makes it worse.
[1:22:42] Amen. A lot of times if you're in the
[1:22:43] middle of a trial and you don't know why
[1:22:47] now if God would just come down and
[1:22:49] appear to you and tap you and put his
[1:22:50] arm around you and go, "Listen, I got a
[1:22:52] plan. It's all part of my plan." You as
[1:22:54] a Christian, you'd go, "Okay, Lord.
[1:22:56] Thank you." Yeah. As long as you got
[1:22:58] this. I'll be fine. Ain't that how you
[1:23:00] feel as a as a believer?
[1:23:02] But a lot of times things happen not
[1:23:05] only in your life, but to loved ones.
[1:23:07] And life as brother Random called it the
[1:23:10] grabag of life sometimes doesn't seem to
[1:23:12] deal you a fair shake and you can you
[1:23:15] can ask the question but I to me friends
[1:23:19] I realized that as I read that old note
[1:23:21] about about the why I thought you know
[1:23:24] that's what I used to think then but at
[1:23:26] my age now and been serving the Lord
[1:23:28] this long and and when I see the
[1:23:31] burgeoning uh of prophecy and the and
[1:23:34] the rapture about to take place and
[1:23:36] knowing what I know about how I'll feel.
[1:23:38] When a prophet said when you cross over,
[1:23:41] the first thing that'll go through your
[1:23:42] mind will be, "Why was I ever worried?"
[1:23:46] I'm going to tell you something,
[1:23:47] friends. When you cross into that, I
[1:23:49] promise you, you're not going to care
[1:23:50] about why. I'll be happy to know how you
[1:23:53] did it, how you pulled it off, but the
[1:23:55] why won't a thing to me.
[1:23:58] No matter what I suffered, what I lost,
[1:24:00] when I'm in that realm, oh, none of
[1:24:02] that's going to matter. Paul said it
[1:24:04] won't even be worth discussing.
[1:24:08] Amen.
[1:24:08] It won't even seem something that
[1:24:10] occupies your mind. The why. Who cares
[1:24:12] the why I'm here. I'm here. I don't care
[1:24:15] about why. I'm here now. That's all that
[1:24:18] matters. I don't ever have to go back
[1:24:20] and do that again. Glorious day.
[1:24:25] Amen.
[1:24:26] That I'm here. That I made it. The sheer
[1:24:30] relief, little doubt will negate most if
[1:24:33] not all of the why.
[1:24:37] When we, as the prophet said, when we
[1:24:39] sit there at that table thousands of
[1:24:41] miles long, the words still make me
[1:24:44] emotional and said the king will walk
[1:24:46] out and drive away your tears and say,
[1:24:49] "Don't weep anymore. It's all over.
[1:24:52] Enter into the joys of the Lord.
[1:24:54] Oh, prepared for you since the
[1:24:57] foundation of the world." Ephesians 1:4
[1:24:59] shows us that we were chosen in Christ
[1:25:02] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:25:05] God in Christ reconciles his family back
[1:25:10] to God. So and and not only does he
[1:25:13] reconcile them, but he molds them
[1:25:18] into the purpose and image of why he put
[1:25:22] them here.
[1:25:23] Yes. So you see he he molds he's molding
[1:25:27] you
[1:25:28] here. If you if you're wondering about
[1:25:30] the why so much now just realize he's
[1:25:35] he's molding you.
[1:25:36] Yeah.
[1:25:37] Say well I've come to him. I've
[1:25:38] surrendered myself. Good. Now he can get
[1:25:40] started.
[1:25:41] Amen.
[1:25:42] See so as I've said to you many times
[1:25:45] remember that sign I saw on a friend of
[1:25:46] mine. I was in his office. He's a good
[1:25:48] Christian man and good friend of mine.
[1:25:50] And he had a picture of Jesus and uh you
[1:25:53] know the the whole world and it was
[1:25:54] built on the order. You know, you've
[1:25:55] seen the one of Uncle Sam standing there
[1:25:57] in his in his big red, white, and blues
[1:26:00] and stripes and he's pointing Uncle Sam
[1:26:02] needs you. And and and and they it's
[1:26:04] Jesus not dressed up like that, but it's
[1:26:07] Jesus, you know, gesturing to you
[1:26:09] saying, "I never said it would be easy.
[1:26:11] I only said it would be worth it."
[1:26:13] Amen.
[1:26:14] Amen. See, so he's reconciling God's
[1:26:19] family back and then he begins molding
[1:26:22] them into all that he saw before time.
[1:26:26] Not just since time, not just since the
[1:26:27] day you were born,
[1:26:29] but he it's not just that I got born
[1:26:32] into the earth and he decided to chase
[1:26:33] me down and save me.
[1:26:35] It's that you came into the earth as an
[1:26:37] expression from his loins.
[1:26:39] Amen.
[1:26:40] And in him, and we can't explain it any
[1:26:42] further than that. All I know is in his
[1:26:45] thoughts they I existed.
[1:26:47] Hallelujah.
[1:26:47] Say in what way? Well, I don't know. But
[1:26:49] I know his thoughts were real.
[1:26:51] Yes. Amen.
[1:26:51] I know that that's different between my
[1:26:53] thoughts that are just figment of
[1:26:55] thoughts.
[1:26:56] And he didn't believe in in the Mormon
[1:26:58] doctrine of pre-existence of soul. So
[1:27:00] somewhere between that error and my
[1:27:02] thoughts that are just thought, God's
[1:27:04] thoughts exist
[1:27:06] and I was in him. And in there uh the
[1:27:09] lamb of God. I mean, if you struggle
[1:27:12] with that, all you have to do is look in
[1:27:15] the book of Revelation and it tells you
[1:27:17] that the lamb of God was slain before
[1:27:19] the foundation of the world.
[1:27:22] See?
[1:27:23] Amen.
[1:27:24] So, so you know, I
[1:27:27] you know, when we read and I've been
[1:27:29] talking to you a little bit and I
[1:27:30] sometimes I feel sorry for, you know,
[1:27:32] I've seen these reels of these street
[1:27:35] preachers and I admire them. God ever
[1:27:37] blessed them. Some of them I admire
[1:27:39] their their heroic attitude to be on the
[1:27:41] street, to be on college campuses
[1:27:43] defending the faith of Christ. They
[1:27:45] don't have all the parts right, but hey,
[1:27:47] they're they're doing more than I'm
[1:27:49] doing. So, I my hats off to them, you
[1:27:51] know. Jesus, you know, the disciples
[1:27:53] came to him and said, "Lord, there's
[1:27:55] some men preaching in your name and even
[1:27:57] baptizing, but they're not with us.
[1:27:58] Should we shut them down?" You know, and
[1:28:00] Jesus said, "Goodness, no." He said,
[1:28:02] "Who whoever is not against, you know,
[1:28:04] whoever's for me could hardly be against
[1:28:06] me." Right?
[1:28:07] You see, so you know, again, we come
[1:28:10] back to this uh God's got a plan. He's
[1:28:13] got it all. Just let him run it. See,
[1:28:17] and so so we but I I I've seen them many
[1:28:20] times where it's it's become a a
[1:28:23] favorite tactic of of campus Muslims to
[1:28:26] and and I love I love the Arab Muslim
[1:28:30] people. I've dedicated my life to
[1:28:32] working there in the mission fields.
[1:28:34] Brother Jason carries on a lot of that
[1:28:36] work. That's why we had such an affinity
[1:28:38] Bethl Tabernacle for years had our work
[1:28:41] in the mi in the Muslim Middle Eastern
[1:28:42] world. Um and and the Lord has done such
[1:28:45] great things. They're are very noble
[1:28:47] people. And I'm not talking about
[1:28:49] radical Islam. And neither am I talking
[1:28:51] about radical uh evil so-called
[1:28:54] Christians because we got those too.
[1:28:57] All right. So, but but they are very
[1:28:59] noble people and uh and many of them
[1:29:02] have have have had tremendous
[1:29:04] supernatural uh responses. I've talked
[1:29:07] to them before where they came to Christ
[1:29:11] because they they had a a vision of
[1:29:15] Jesus, but they didn't know who he was.
[1:29:18] And they and he said, you know, uh I I
[1:29:22] have forgiven you and I have made your
[1:29:24] life clean. And he says, "Who are you?
[1:29:27] Who are you that forgives my sins and
[1:29:29] makes me clean and I feel clean?" But
[1:29:32] how did I Who are you? And he says, "I
[1:29:34] am Jesus Christ."
[1:29:36] Amen.
[1:29:36] And and and there's many testimonies
[1:29:38] like that. You You remember the uh where
[1:29:42] uh and I don't want to get sidetracked
[1:29:43] telling stories today because I've got
[1:29:45] years of stories to tell from my
[1:29:47] travels. But but we find the point that
[1:29:50] I want to make is that sometimes they
[1:29:53] they point out and they love it's become
[1:29:55] almost a thing to try to you know jam up
[1:29:58] the preacher the Christian apologist by
[1:30:01] saying you know nowhere in the gospels
[1:30:04] or the Bible does Jesus claim to be the
[1:30:07] son of God. Now, on a technical sense,
[1:30:09] there's there they've got a point to be
[1:30:11] made because Jesus certainly claims that
[1:30:14] and certainly says it. But he says it in
[1:30:16] more of an indirect way and and some of
[1:30:19] the ways that are even indirect are
[1:30:21] pretty direct to where you could not
[1:30:23] conclude anything else other than that's
[1:30:25] what he means. It's not I mean all even
[1:30:26] all the ambiguity is gone. But the point
[1:30:28] they're making is the technical side of
[1:30:30] it. Uh this is exactly why Paul said I
[1:30:33] came not to you in the technical side
[1:30:35] only.
[1:30:35] Amen. See, I came in power and
[1:30:37] demonstration. People can argue the
[1:30:39] technical side. Apologists can argue
[1:30:41] what the word means. You can have a good
[1:30:43] argument and they can give you a good
[1:30:44] counterargument.
[1:30:46] It's not that. Say, well then why do
[1:30:47] you, brother Jason, why do you follow
[1:30:51] the understanding of the scripture that
[1:30:54] you follow? Well, I follow it for the
[1:30:57] exact same reason that William Brandham
[1:30:59] said he followed it.
[1:31:01] And that is he said, I get the same
[1:31:03] results that they had in the early
[1:31:04] church. Amen.
[1:31:06] So, you can argue all day long
[1:31:08] apologetics and you can argue the Greek
[1:31:10] and argue the Hebrew, but the real
[1:31:12] question comes down to it is does what I
[1:31:15] believe has it changed my life?
[1:31:18] Does my life mirror the life of Christ
[1:31:20] that he lived when he was a human?
[1:31:23] Amen.
[1:31:23] And do I believe every word of God? And
[1:31:25] do I let it flow out of my life? And do
[1:31:27] we see the eye the blinded eyes open?
[1:31:30] Yes. The deaf hear? Yes. The lame walk?
[1:31:32] Yes. The dead raised? Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:31:34] Yes.
[1:31:36] So I the the version of the gospel and
[1:31:39] there's 40 north of 40,000 versions.
[1:31:42] Right.
[1:31:43] But the version that we believe seems to
[1:31:46] get the same results that the book of
[1:31:48] Acts church got. So why would I not
[1:31:51] why would I not follow the version that
[1:31:53] produces that?
[1:31:55] See,
[1:31:56] so we can and so they they argue that
[1:31:58] and sometimes I feel sorry for the
[1:32:01] apologist because they're they don't
[1:32:03] realize that generally they're hog tied
[1:32:05] because of the trinity doctrine and
[1:32:07] they're trying to explain around that
[1:32:09] and they're trying to get a Muslim who
[1:32:10] believes only in one god and uh or or a
[1:32:13] Hebrew a real true Jew who believes only
[1:32:15] in one god and they're trying to jam
[1:32:17] this triple thing of some ridiculous
[1:32:20] idea that he's one person but he's three
[1:32:23] persons Wait. Huh?
[1:32:24] Come on.
[1:32:25] Yeah. Well, he's he's one being, but
[1:32:27] he's three persons. Wait, what? Yeah,
[1:32:30] he's he's he's three he's three persons.
[1:32:33] Yeah. So, he's three he's three gods.
[1:32:35] No, no, no. He's just one God. Okay, I
[1:32:38] need to go back to school. What? How do
[1:32:40] you get How do you get that? And and
[1:32:43] their defense of that is, and I've heard
[1:32:45] their best scholars, their best their
[1:32:46] top-of-the-line apologists say, "Look,
[1:32:49] it's a mystery."
[1:32:52] I'm like, boy, it sure is.
[1:32:56] It's so inconsistent with the Bible and
[1:32:58] God never honors it. And that's why they
[1:33:00] don't have the blind eyes open and the
[1:33:02] lame walking and the dead being raised.
[1:33:05] See, because there's no other name given
[1:33:07] under heaven among men whereby we must
[1:33:09] be saved, but the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:12] Christ. So they don't realize, see, they
[1:33:15] don't realize, and we were talking about
[1:33:16] this Wednesday, the the beauty of
[1:33:19] Revelation 1 1:8 is it's the revelation
[1:33:23] of Jesus Christ that culminates in the
[1:33:26] eth verse where he is saying, "I'm the
[1:33:29] alpha, the omega. I'm the beginning, and
[1:33:31] the end. I'm the almighty." Taking away
[1:33:33] all ambiguity. You can't. That's not
[1:33:36] ambiguous.
[1:33:37] When he's saying, "I am the Almighty."
[1:33:40] Amen. I mean, how much how how more less
[1:33:45] can I say it like that? How more less am
[1:33:47] ambiguous could you say it?
[1:33:50] Uh, who are you? I'm the Almighty. What
[1:33:52] does that mean?
[1:33:54] I'm the Almighty.
[1:33:57] Well, but but tell me the definition.
[1:33:59] Okay. There was an Almighty and I'm him.
[1:34:04] I am.
[1:34:05] I am.
[1:34:06] Amen.
[1:34:07] So, okay. I want to know the creator.
[1:34:09] Yeah, you got him. Well, I mean the very
[1:34:11] first one. You mean the alpha? Yeah.
[1:34:13] Here you go.
[1:34:14] Oh, what? Okay. But but what about the
[1:34:18] ending? Yeah, I'm him, too. What about
[1:34:19] the one who will sit on the throne?
[1:34:20] Mhm.
[1:34:21] What about the one who who is who John
[1:34:24] saw? Yep.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:26] You got me.
[1:34:27] See?
[1:34:28] Amen. So, so then when we So then that
[1:34:31] forces us to look back at the gospels
[1:34:34] and I was showing you Wednesday night
[1:34:36] that the difference between the gospels
[1:34:38] describing Jesus and re the book of
[1:34:40] revelation describing Jesus is in the
[1:34:43] gospels he didn't come to honor and
[1:34:45] glorify himself. He came to glorify the
[1:34:48] father.
[1:34:50] He and he says herein is my father
[1:34:52] glorified in St. John 15 that you bring
[1:34:54] forth much fruit. I'm the vine, you're
[1:34:56] the branches. My father's the gardener,
[1:34:58] the farmer, the husbandman.
[1:35:00] See? So, so it's this it's this top down
[1:35:03] that flows through and flows out. And
[1:35:06] this is why Paul would say we're
[1:35:07] ambassadors. So, so it's it's now flowed
[1:35:10] to us. So, when he's when he's living in
[1:35:13] his human form, he's laying down a road
[1:35:16] map for because he's the word made flesh
[1:35:19] in a human being.
[1:35:21] But on the day of Pentecost, the word
[1:35:23] would be made flesh in 120 human beings.
[1:35:25] Amen.
[1:35:26] And within days, thousands and a few
[1:35:28] more days, thousands more. And it would
[1:35:30] start spreading everywhere. And it would
[1:35:32] be the word of God made flesh in human
[1:35:34] beings.
[1:35:35] And so when he's living in the gospels,
[1:35:38] he's showing you, he's laying down a
[1:35:40] road map for when it would be your turn
[1:35:42] to be the word made flesh.
[1:35:44] And I feel sorry for them that that they
[1:35:47] see they they're trying to answer the
[1:35:49] question of, "Well, is he did he say he
[1:35:51] was the son of God?" But they're missing
[1:35:54] the grand understanding of the Godhead
[1:35:58] that he was only as a human being so
[1:36:00] that he could become kinfolk to me
[1:36:04] and pay the price because God couldn't
[1:36:07] do that in spirit form. He had to become
[1:36:09] a man, a kinsman, redeemer that you have
[1:36:12] today is in Christ. He had to become
[1:36:14] kinfolk to the human race. So he became
[1:36:16] a man. Justice required that he take on
[1:36:19] the penalty of death on your behalf.
[1:36:22] Amen.
[1:36:23] The beauty of it is if you had have done
[1:36:26] that, if you tried to do that, you'd be
[1:36:28] just like Adam.
[1:36:30] Adam tried, The first Adam tried to do
[1:36:32] that. The first Adam tried to save and
[1:36:35] he was the son of God. He tried to save
[1:36:38] his wife by stepping into sin on her
[1:36:40] behalf. The problem was he got caught
[1:36:43] himself
[1:36:44] in sin. But the second Adam, the grave
[1:36:47] couldn't hold him.
[1:36:48] Death couldn't conquer him. It was just
[1:36:50] the opposite of that. He went in down,
[1:36:52] conquered death, hell, and the grave and
[1:36:54] ascended out and then pulled his bride
[1:36:56] out with him. And today you are free
[1:36:58] from the law of sin and death.
[1:37:02] Amen.
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:06] So, so Revelation 18 leaves very little
[1:37:09] doubt as to who he was. And the opening
[1:37:12] of the seventh seal leaves little doubt
[1:37:15] as to who his redeemed family are.
[1:37:17] Amen. See? And so I mean it it's very
[1:37:22] clear.
[1:37:24] It's it's it's not ambiguous.
[1:37:28] His his family uh
[1:37:33] his family are duplicates of him
[1:37:38] in the earth.
[1:37:39] Amen.
[1:37:40] And so
[1:37:43] when he showed us the way forward, we go
[1:37:46] in that way.
[1:37:47] See? And so you know how and and what's
[1:37:51] the way forward? Okay. What's what's the
[1:37:53] end goal? So that I like him can conquer
[1:37:57] the world, sin, the flesh, and the
[1:38:01] devil.
[1:38:02] Amen.
[1:38:03] Jesus conquered all all four of those.
[1:38:05] Jesus conquered sin. He conquered the
[1:38:07] world. He conquered flesh. He conquered
[1:38:10] the devil. And and he showed me the way
[1:38:12] forward. Say what? What was his main
[1:38:14] ingredient? I do always that which
[1:38:16] pleases the father.
[1:38:18] Uh the son does nothing but what he sees
[1:38:20] the father doing. So So how do I do that
[1:38:23] today? Here he is. I'm following the
[1:38:26] father. I'm following the way. I'm
[1:38:29] following the word. I get the same
[1:38:31] results. It's not rocket science.
[1:38:34] The bride of Christ are identified
[1:38:36] because they their lives resemble his
[1:38:39] life.
[1:38:39] Amen.
[1:38:40] Which always believed God and always
[1:38:43] obeyed the word of God. See?
[1:38:45] So, so that's what makes it stand out.
[1:38:48] It's not more complicated than that.
[1:38:49] It's a total surrender to the word.
[1:38:51] That's what Jesus did.
[1:38:53] Amen.
[1:38:54] So, it's not more complicated to than
[1:38:56] that. What makes it stand out, you know,
[1:38:58] is that you can actually do none of
[1:39:00] those things. Only Christ living in you
[1:39:03] by your surrender can do it.
[1:39:06] And this really,
[1:39:08] well, this is what Easter means.
[1:39:12] Amen. That's what Easter is all about is
[1:39:15] that it's Christ living in you because
[1:39:18] you surrendered to him to his word. So
[1:39:21] he came to earth to live Jesus came to
[1:39:25] earth to live an authentic version of
[1:39:29] the original life of God. And he came to
[1:39:32] live the life that God intended for
[1:39:36] humans to live.
[1:39:37] Amen.
[1:39:38] Amen. So, and then he ascends back to
[1:39:41] God as a faithful high priest as we read
[1:39:43] in our text so that he could feel all
[1:39:45] that we feel and all that we feel. And
[1:39:48] so, through this uh experience of human
[1:39:52] suffering, through this experience of
[1:39:54] human weakness, uh of human frailty
[1:39:57] because Jesus suffered all of that, you
[1:40:00] know, he was, remember, he was the
[1:40:02] virgin-born son of God, but he's living
[1:40:04] in a cursed body made from a cursed
[1:40:06] earth. That's why how he could age.
[1:40:08] That's why he could get sick. That's why
[1:40:11] he could be killed. You understand? How?
[1:40:14] Try that. Try try to apply any of that
[1:40:16] to the spirit of God.
[1:40:19] Him get sick, him be killed. No.
[1:40:21] Impossible. See, so God comes in a form
[1:40:24] and makes himself vulnerable. The
[1:40:26] apostle explains it that he he he who
[1:40:29] was who thought it not at all a strange
[1:40:31] thing to say I'm equal to God. When you
[1:40:34] believe in me, you believe in God. When
[1:40:36] you say, "Show us the father," you're
[1:40:38] looking at him, Philillip. See,
[1:40:40] so he that thought it not strange at all
[1:40:42] to be caught equivalent to God, uh, the
[1:40:45] very God, laid aside his splendor and
[1:40:48] took on the form of of a sinful man, and
[1:40:51] submitted himself to the death of the
[1:40:53] cross. See? So, so having then after his
[1:40:56] resurrection returned
[1:40:59] um uh returned after he after he was
[1:41:02] tempted in all ways that I could be and
[1:41:05] returned to the very God that he had
[1:41:07] been before his human incarnation, then
[1:41:10] he was then at that point he's going to
[1:41:12] understand with perfect knowledge. And
[1:41:15] I'm so glad because now by perfect
[1:41:18] experience, he's going to understand all
[1:41:21] the sin traps that I could fall into and
[1:41:24] all the sin traps that I've been c all
[1:41:27] the sin traps we've been caught in.
[1:41:29] Absolutely.
[1:41:30] Oh, come on.
[1:41:32] All the sin traps we've been caught in.
[1:41:35] See? Amen.
[1:41:36] So he could understand what it means to
[1:41:38] be to to to to stumble into those things
[1:41:40] and live under that weakness and desire
[1:41:43] fellowship to be reconnected.
[1:41:46] What what is the spirit of repentance?
[1:41:49] Is it is it Here's a couple of things.
[1:41:52] It's not. Brother Brandon talks about
[1:41:54] how that, you know, he said if he'd
[1:41:55] stepped out on his wife, he said, "God
[1:41:57] forbid, you know, that I would ever, but
[1:41:59] if I ever did, he said, I believe she'd
[1:42:00] forgive me." But he said, "But what if I
[1:42:03] come to back to her and said, "Hey, hey,
[1:42:06] old buddy, old pal, old chum." So, uh,
[1:42:08] yeah, I yeah, I kind of messed up, but
[1:42:11] hey, hey, yeah, forgive me, old girl.
[1:42:13] What do you say? Come on. How about it,
[1:42:15] old buddy?
[1:42:16] And brother Brandon would say, his wife
[1:42:18] would say, "What what has happened to my
[1:42:19] husband?"
[1:42:20] Yeah. See, that's not a spirit of
[1:42:21] repentance.
[1:42:23] And then it's and then and then the next
[1:42:25] level goes and here's another thing a
[1:42:27] little higher, but it's still not this.
[1:42:29] It's not that you repent because you
[1:42:31] don't want to go to hell.
[1:42:34] It's that there's a deep broken sorrow
[1:42:37] inside of you because you realize you
[1:42:40] have you have hindered the fellowship
[1:42:42] with your creator. And there's nothing
[1:42:44] more important to a believer than daily
[1:42:47] fellowship with that being. Amen.
[1:42:50] And so it's a spirit of repentance that
[1:42:52] you want to be whole again. You want to
[1:42:55] be back in fellowship. He he understands
[1:42:58] all the traps we can fall into. He
[1:43:00] understands with perfect knowledge the
[1:43:03] things that that and e even our laziness
[1:43:05] and our dilatory ways that and the times
[1:43:08] when we were complicit and we helped the
[1:43:10] devil trick us.
[1:43:11] Amen.
[1:43:12] Amen.
[1:43:13] Sure you did.
[1:43:15] Deny all you want, but you did. Amen.
[1:43:18] You know, and and and even while I even
[1:43:21] while I do it, he's faithfully
[1:43:24] reconciling me.
[1:43:25] I mean, what a deal.
[1:43:28] Even when I'm in complicit with the
[1:43:30] enemy, he's still reconciling me. That
[1:43:33] body of the of the Messiah of Christ is
[1:43:36] still laid there and that blood is still
[1:43:39] speaking for me. And I still enjoy the
[1:43:41] innocence of Christ. and and that way
[1:43:43] and because it it's impossible for a son
[1:43:46] of God to sin. He cannot sin. The seed
[1:43:48] of God remains in him. But in our flesh,
[1:43:51] we can commit a sin, a transgression.
[1:43:54] But we have an advocate.
[1:43:57] Hallelujah. Who will constantly plead
[1:43:59] our case to the father.
[1:44:01] Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:02] See,
[1:44:04] and so God gazes upon my sacrifice.
[1:44:09] uh that corporal body of Jesus laid on
[1:44:12] the altar and and and and and as such he
[1:44:15] gazes gazing upon my sacrifice that I
[1:44:18] remain unchanged by my earthly failures.
[1:44:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:25] Think of that.
[1:44:26] Think of what Easter means. When you
[1:44:29] have
[1:44:30] Hallelujah
[1:44:31] died and been born in Christ, nothing
[1:44:34] you do, no earthly condition can alter
[1:44:38] your heavenly position.
[1:44:39] That's right.
[1:44:40] That Christ saw of you before the
[1:44:42] foundation of the world. So, no wonder
[1:44:45] we have the guarantee that if we repent,
[1:44:48] he will be faithful and just to forgive
[1:44:50] us because th the this promise, this is
[1:44:53] his promise and it's always been it's
[1:44:56] always been not only unmmerited,
[1:44:58] but unlimited.
[1:45:01] Thank God. Say, "Well, it's unmmerited."
[1:45:03] Oh, praise God. Yeah, but it's also
[1:45:04] unlimited.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. Because I've did a lot of
[1:45:08] unmmeriting. That's
[1:45:09] right. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:13] So when we talk about biblical
[1:45:14] redemption,
[1:45:16] we put forth Christ's role as a mediator
[1:45:20] and the the resulting call of the Holy
[1:45:23] Spirit is that we participate in God's
[1:45:27] work of reconciliation. So thus he said,
[1:45:30] "Wherefore in all things it behooveth
[1:45:32] him to be made like unto his brethren
[1:45:35] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:45:37] high priest in things pertaining to God
[1:45:39] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:45:42] the people." See, so we see that he he's
[1:45:46] made like unto his brethren. He's he's
[1:45:49] fully human so that he could serve as a
[1:45:51] merciful high priest because he's
[1:45:54] sharing in human nature and the human
[1:45:56] experience. and he's able to then uh
[1:45:59] sympathize and not only sympathize but
[1:46:01] empathize with our weaknesses.
[1:46:04] And so it the the whole reason that Paul
[1:46:07] draws on the Old Testament high priest
[1:46:10] is that unlike a human priest who were
[1:46:13] imperfect, Jesus's perfect sinlessness
[1:46:18] um they enable him to mediate
[1:46:20] effectively because for him he he he
[1:46:25] knows your heart so that he's not basing
[1:46:29] his decision to forgive you on the
[1:46:32] severity of the transgression.
[1:46:35] Yeah.
[1:46:36] You understand? It's not about the
[1:46:38] severity of your transgressions. I'm
[1:46:40] going to read you a statement here in a
[1:46:42] minute that brother Brandon made and
[1:46:44] it's so it's so uh so incredible and we
[1:46:47] we'll we'll finish with it today. Uh but
[1:46:50] it's just amazing. He he said it in 1955
[1:46:54] in fellowship by redemption.
[1:46:57] He says, and I just want you to I want
[1:46:59] you to absorb
[1:47:02] in this quote, not doctrine.
[1:47:06] I want you to absorb the value of Easter
[1:47:09] so that today when you leave here,
[1:47:12] you'll understand and you'll have a
[1:47:14] greater appreciation for what that day
[1:47:18] on Calvary meant, his death, his burial,
[1:47:21] and his resurrection. That he ascended
[1:47:24] on high and sent his life back into the
[1:47:26] church. Amen.
[1:47:28] Brother Brown says, "No matter what
[1:47:31] you've done, sinner friend,
[1:47:36] when God sees you confess your sins as
[1:47:40] being wrong
[1:47:42] and God looks through the blood of the
[1:47:44] Lord Jesus, he sees you snow white. No
[1:47:48] matter what you've done, he's looking
[1:47:53] through you through Christ's blood.
[1:47:56] You're redeemed. A precious thing
[1:48:01] that is a you talking about no wonder
[1:48:04] the Bible says be ye reconciled unto
[1:48:07] God.
[1:48:09] Because true reconciliation that God is
[1:48:12] trying to make you one of his
[1:48:13] ambassadors. The first thing he's going
[1:48:16] to do, he says, "No matter what you've
[1:48:18] done, sinner friend, when God sees you
[1:48:22] confess your sins as being wrong, then
[1:48:24] he looks at you through the blood of
[1:48:26] Jesus. He sees you snow white. No matter
[1:48:29] what you've done, he's looking through
[1:48:33] Christ's blood. You're redeemed. A
[1:48:36] precious thing. God will never condemn
[1:48:40] you no more. He can't condemn you.
[1:48:46] So now Rubicon has been crossed. Wait a
[1:48:48] minute. You mean he can't condemn me?
[1:48:51] So somehow we've crossed a line where
[1:48:53] there's no going back.
[1:48:55] He can't revisit my case. See, he says,
[1:48:59] "When God made the first man, he made
[1:49:02] the heavens and the earth. And when God
[1:49:04] stood back on the old creation and
[1:49:05] looked upon it, he didn't look upon it
[1:49:07] to judge it. He looked upon it and said,
[1:49:09] "How good it is." He admired it. Oh my.
[1:49:11] Do you see it? He looked and seen how
[1:49:13] good it was. Everything was perfect. The
[1:49:15] trees and everything, the man and the
[1:49:16] woman, it was all perfect. He said,
[1:49:18] "It's very good." But now, Satan
[1:49:21] perverted that.
[1:49:22] Yeah.
[1:49:23] Amen.
[1:49:23] See, so the let this inform your
[1:49:27] thinking as to what kind of a being God
[1:49:29] is. God is not his whole desire is not
[1:49:33] to destroy you.
[1:49:35] His whole desire is not to even destroy
[1:49:37] the world. His whole desire is that even
[1:49:40] he would that every man come to
[1:49:42] salvation.
[1:49:43] God looked at the earth in its perfect
[1:49:47] condition and he wants it back there
[1:49:49] again. He looked at you in your original
[1:49:51] condition and he wants you back there
[1:49:53] again. No wonder he would so quickly
[1:49:55] forgive you. No wonder he would cross a
[1:49:58] line and say, "I'm going to so forgive
[1:50:00] you. I'm going to so redeem you. I'm
[1:50:02] going to take that past. I don't care
[1:50:04] what it was. It doesn't even matter. I'm
[1:50:06] going to toss it in the sea of
[1:50:07] forgetfulness. It can never be
[1:50:09] remembered against you anymore. Even by
[1:50:11] me, even I'm going to forget it.
[1:50:14] And you're going to stand perfect
[1:50:15] because I'm trying by any and all means
[1:50:18] to get you back home in the condition
[1:50:21] that I saw when you left here.
[1:50:24] See?
[1:50:25] Amen.
[1:50:25] So this ministry of reconciliation
[1:50:29] is a beautiful thing. See, so we find
[1:50:33] then that that only and I and I just
[1:50:36] thought it was a a beautiful way to
[1:50:38] think about it is that and I and I've
[1:50:42] got other things I can read but I want
[1:50:44] to close.
[1:50:47] Let me read you this last one in why
[1:50:49] Christ speak. Now this is a year later
[1:50:51] or a couple years later 59. And he says,
[1:50:53] "Now God is not going to hold a man
[1:50:56] responsible
[1:50:58] for he's talking about for being a
[1:51:00] sinner." You know why? Because you were
[1:51:02] born a sinner.
[1:51:04] He's not going to hold a man responsible
[1:51:06] because he's a sinner. Because he was
[1:51:08] born a sinner. But what God is going to
[1:51:11] hold a man responsible for is because
[1:51:13] that he remains a sinner. See,
[1:51:15] he didn't have to do that. He didn't
[1:51:16] have to remain a sinner. For there is a
[1:51:18] provision made for his justification
[1:51:20] through Jesus Christ. and and and so so
[1:51:24] at the end of the day, friends, the the
[1:51:27] failure
[1:51:29] to appreciate the real meaning of Easter
[1:51:34] and remain in your sin,
[1:51:36] right?
[1:51:37] Remain in your sin and and and so it's
[1:51:40] only those who remain in sin by their
[1:51:42] own will
[1:51:44] have their sins held against them in
[1:51:46] judgment.
[1:51:47] Amen.
[1:51:47] That's the only ones.
[1:51:50] If you're willing to come to him, let me
[1:51:52] say this today, Brother Kenny, get ready
[1:51:54] to gather your team.
[1:51:57] If you are willing to come to him
[1:52:00] and by the indwelling Holy Ghost be
[1:52:05] reconciled back to God,
[1:52:08] reconciled from the lost state that you
[1:52:10] were born in. Can I ask you a question?
[1:52:14] If you're willing,
[1:52:16] Amen. to come to God and be reconciled
[1:52:19] back to him through the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:23] Why Why would he hold your sins against
[1:52:27] you?
[1:52:30] Why would he? I
[1:52:32] If he came and died for you and you're
[1:52:34] willing to come and repent and be filled
[1:52:35] with his life, why would he hold your
[1:52:37] sin? The whole reason he died and rose
[1:52:40] and ascended and gave you back his life
[1:52:43] so that he could forgive you and
[1:52:45] reconcile you. Be ye reconciled back to
[1:52:49] God.
[1:52:50] Amen.
[1:52:51] See,
[1:52:52] why then would he hold your past sins
[1:52:55] against you? The whole reason he died at
[1:52:57] Calvary
[1:52:59] was to reconcile you from a sin birth
[1:53:03] condition that was not your fault.
[1:53:06] Amen.
[1:53:08] Let's stand.
[1:53:11] The sin that you were born into was not
[1:53:15] your fault.
[1:53:16] It was never your fault. Paul says that
[1:53:19] the creature came not willingly. It was
[1:53:22] subjected to it. See, and and so so a
[1:53:26] lot of times people they cannot uh you
[1:53:29] know they they cannot recognize uh the
[1:53:33] what representation means. Amen.
[1:53:36] something very uh worshipful. Brother
[1:53:38] Kenny, I want to I wasn't going to read
[1:53:40] this, but now that I've got you
[1:53:41] standing, you know we're closing. Let me
[1:53:42] read this last one. What an appropriate
[1:53:45] quote. This is from the true Easter
[1:53:47] Seal. Do you know there's a true one?
[1:53:50] If there's a true one, there's an
[1:53:51] artificial one.
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:58] So, brother Brandham says, "And it was
[1:54:00] somewhat that way with Cain
[1:54:04] because he brought in the fruits of the
[1:54:06] field and made his service to God and it
[1:54:07] was rejected because he did not come the
[1:54:09] right precise way that God had ordained
[1:54:11] him to come. But he had made his
[1:54:13] offering and done everything religiously
[1:54:15] just as his brother. But he was
[1:54:16] rejected. And because he was rejected on
[1:54:18] the spiritual side, then it caused a
[1:54:20] jealousy to rise in him because he was
[1:54:22] greedy. That's in man. There's a prophet
[1:54:26] owning it. That's in man. He can't help
[1:54:28] being what he is because he's born in
[1:54:30] that condition. I'm glad God understands
[1:54:33] that
[1:54:35] man is represented in heaven as a sinner
[1:54:40] by a sinner. See, because because in in
[1:54:44] Adam, he you know, you got one thing
[1:54:46] that condemns us all to sin in the first
[1:54:49] Adam and then we're reconciled in the
[1:54:50] second Adam.
[1:54:52] So he said, "You are represented in
[1:54:54] heaven as a sinner by a sinner." I was
[1:54:56] speaking on that some time ago and
[1:54:58] someone said,
[1:55:00] you know, that's that's not just if I'm
[1:55:04] to be represented by one man's
[1:55:06] disobedience and I don't have a chance.
[1:55:09] I mean, it sounds like goodness
[1:55:10] gracious. You mean to tell me that I'm
[1:55:13] I'm born in sin because one man that I
[1:55:15] didn't have anything to do with who
[1:55:17] lived 6,000 years ago because he did it,
[1:55:19] now I'm born guilty, too. Mhm.
[1:55:23] Yeah. In Adam, we all die. See?
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:27] And he said, well,
[1:55:30] he said, I if I'm to be represented by
[1:55:32] one man's disobedience, then I don't
[1:55:34] have a chance. And brother Brandham
[1:55:35] said, "That's true because you are born
[1:55:38] a sinner, but you are represented." See,
[1:55:41] you are condemned to condemnation
[1:55:45] by representation.
[1:55:48] See, when you're born in sin, you're
[1:55:50] condemned by representation. It's guilt
[1:55:52] by association.
[1:55:54] You're a human offspring of that human
[1:55:56] who sinned, and it sentenced every man
[1:55:58] born after that to be born in that. So,
[1:56:01] so you're you're you're born guilty.
[1:56:04] See, I said that's true because you're
[1:56:07] born a sinner, but you're represented.
[1:56:08] You're condemned to condemnation by
[1:56:10] representation. Well, then that looks
[1:56:14] very cruel. Amen.
[1:56:16] I'm glad you're a prophet on that. That
[1:56:18] looks very cruel. But turn it on the
[1:56:21] other side.
[1:56:23] Then we are ordained to eternal life by
[1:56:26] representation.
[1:56:28] Where one represented us to death,
[1:56:30] another represented us to eternal life.
[1:56:32] So it puts us back again before the
[1:56:34] throne. Every human being comes right
[1:56:37] back to the same place to make our
[1:56:39] choice.
[1:56:41] I am back at the same place that Adam to
[1:56:44] make a choice and I choose differently.
[1:56:46] I choose his word. I choose
[1:56:50] reconciliation and I choose to be made
[1:56:52] an ambassador of his kingdom. So when I
[1:56:56] was born, I was guilty by
[1:56:58] representation. Today I'm innocent. Say,
[1:57:01] are you really innocent? Well, not by my
[1:57:04] record, but by representation. I'm
[1:57:06] innocent.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah.
[1:57:08] Hallelujah. That's what makes Easter
[1:57:10] special. That's why it's more than
[1:57:12] Easter eggs and bunnies and and and and
[1:57:15] sales at the store. It's it's and and
[1:57:17] and a and a dinner and dressing up. It's
[1:57:19] more than that. I have a new
[1:57:21] representative.
[1:57:23] And God looks at me through his blood
[1:57:27] and I look pure. I'm not, but I look
[1:57:29] pure to him. I look holy. I don't always
[1:57:32] feel holy, but God only sees me as holy.
[1:57:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:57:36] Oh, friends, this is what Easter is
[1:57:39] about.
[1:57:40] So today, maybe if you came here
[1:57:44] and it was just a dress up day or just a
[1:57:46] tradition, could you maybe leave with it
[1:57:49] being a little more a little more
[1:57:51] valuable to you? Maybe you heard some
[1:57:54] things today you weren't aware of. Wow,
[1:57:57] I didn't really have the scul score. Now
[1:58:00] I know. And knowing's half the battle.
[1:58:05] Knowing's half the battle. But of course
[1:58:07] there's always the other half.
[1:58:09] The other half is always application. As
[1:58:11] he said, now we're all brought back. It
[1:58:14] doesn't mean
[1:58:16] because Christ died. Listen,
[1:58:20] because Christ died, buried, rose,
[1:58:23] ascended, sent back life. That doesn't
[1:58:26] mean the whole world gets a free pass to
[1:58:28] be saved. What it does is come brings
[1:58:31] you back to the choice.
[1:58:34] And now where is you had no choice until
[1:58:37] that day on Calvary. Now you've got a
[1:58:39] choice.
[1:58:39] Hallelujah.
[1:58:40] Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[1:58:43] You're going to serve man-made tradition
[1:58:45] or will you serve the living God who can
[1:58:48] produce in your life the same results
[1:58:50] that they got in the book of Acts. The
[1:58:52] choice is yours. That's what Easter is
[1:58:54] about, friends. It gives you that choice
[1:58:57] to make. Father, today
[1:59:01] we come down, Lord, to the end of this
[1:59:03] service. And I feel so grateful to you,
[1:59:08] Lord, that I made the decision right off
[1:59:10] the bat feeling torn between two
[1:59:12] different directions, but I knew better
[1:59:15] than to go my own way. And I just
[1:59:16] followed your lead, Lord. And today, I
[1:59:19] have a great sense of peace and
[1:59:20] satisfaction in my heart that the
[1:59:23] message has fell in the camp. It's it's
[1:59:25] here. It's arrived. Father, now men and
[1:59:29] women, boys and girls, stand on in your
[1:59:33] presence, not to me, it's to you. And
[1:59:36] they stand with a choice that men
[1:59:38] mankind never used to have until that
[1:59:41] day on Calvary. And that you ascended on
[1:59:44] high and sent back your life into the
[1:59:46] church. And now we're given the choice.
[1:59:49] A choice we're right back there at those
[1:59:52] two altars. We're right back there in
[1:59:54] Genesis 4 and there's only two altars.
[1:59:58] Which one will I choose?
[2:00:00] Which sacrifice will I take? Will I try
[2:00:03] to bring my own goodness like Cain did?
[2:00:05] Or where or am I willing to take, Lord,
[2:00:08] a way that seemed cruel and hard, but
[2:00:12] yet it was the way of blood. It was the
[2:00:14] way of life. It was because that that it
[2:00:17] represented that lamb that Abel killed,
[2:00:20] his innocent life. He wasn't innocent
[2:00:22] little lamb, but he wasn't a human. So
[2:00:24] his life couldn't come back on Abel. So
[2:00:27] he only represented the lamb of God. And
[2:00:30] when the lamb of God came as Christ
[2:00:32] Jesus, now he's a human. So when he
[2:00:35] gives his life on the cross like that
[2:00:37] lamb gave up his life, then now the life
[2:00:40] of the one who died can live in me and
[2:00:43] can bring me back and reconcile me back
[2:00:46] to God. Oh hallelujah.
[2:00:49] Thank you for that today. Now, master,
[2:00:53] enough's been said. We're going to give
[2:00:55] the Holy Spirit a little bit of time.
[2:00:57] We're going to sing some songs. We're
[2:00:58] going to worship. That's when it's time
[2:01:00] to really worship and sing. When the
[2:01:02] word has come forth, when evil spirits
[2:01:05] and darkness has been driven back and
[2:01:06] people's hearts are open to your
[2:01:08] presence, Lord, the world will just shut
[2:01:10] it back. The world will slam the door
[2:01:12] shut once they leave here. Lord, it's an
[2:01:14] evil place. But right now, while the
[2:01:16] glory of God is here, while the word is
[2:01:18] gone forth, while it's still ringing in
[2:01:20] the people's ears, may they make the
[2:01:22] right choice today to say, "Master, I
[2:01:25] want everything. I want to be just like
[2:01:27] you. I want to be a duplicate of you. I
[2:01:29] want that same life that lived in you to
[2:01:32] live in me. I pray you'll grant it,
[2:01:34] master. May every man, woman, and boy,
[2:01:36] and girl make that correct choice today.
[2:01:40] We love you. We thank you in Jesus'
[2:01:43] name." Amen. Let's sing a song or two, a
[2:01:46] couple of bars of this before we go.
[2:01:48] We've got a day of fellowship and food
[2:01:50] and activity, but let's give the Lord a
[2:01:53] few more minutes. Will you do it? Amen.
[2:01:55] Let's sing, brother Kenny.
[2:01:58] Amen.
[2:01:58] You are here
[2:02:00] [Music]
[2:02:02] moving in our mid.
[2:02:06] Do you believe it?
[2:02:07] I worship you.
[2:02:12] I worship you.
[2:02:16] You are here
[2:02:20] working in this place.
[2:02:24] Hallelujah. I worship you,
[2:02:29] Lord. I worship you. You are here. You
[2:02:34] are here.
[2:02:37] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:38] Touching every
[2:02:40] heart.
[2:02:41] Touch our hearts today. I worship you,
[2:02:44] Lord. We worship you today.
[2:02:47] I worship you.
[2:02:51] You are healed.
[2:02:54] You promised you'd be in heart.
[2:02:58] Bring healing to hearts today, Lord.
[2:03:00] I worship you,
[2:03:04] my
[2:03:05] worship you.
[2:03:09] We are the way maker, miracle worker,
[2:03:15] promise keeper, promise keeper, light in
[2:03:18] the darkness.
[2:03:20] My God, that is who you are.
[2:03:26] Oh, you're the way maker, miracle
[2:03:32] worker, promise keeper, light in the
[2:03:36] darkness.
[2:03:38] My God, that is who you are.
[2:03:45] You are the Oh, we worship you today.
[2:03:51] Hallelujah. Jesus, I worship you. Oh,
[2:03:56] glorious God, we worship you. Lord, I
[2:03:58] worship you.
[2:04:02] You are near. Yes, God. ending.
[2:04:08] Do that thing that only you can do. I
[2:04:11] worship you. Touch hearts convince mind.
[2:04:15] I worship you.
[2:04:19] Let's go now. You're the way maker,
[2:04:24] miracle worker, promise keeper, light in
[2:04:28] the darkness,
[2:04:31] my God. That is who you are.
[2:04:36] Oh,
[2:04:39] way maker, miracle worker,
[2:04:44] keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:04:48] My God, that is who you are.
[2:04:53] That is who you are.
[2:04:58] That is who you are.
[2:05:02] That is who you are.
[2:05:06] That is who you are.
[2:05:10] That is who you are. Glory.
[2:05:15] [Music]
[2:05:18] Hallelujah. That is who you are.
[2:05:23] That is who you are. Oh, let's sing it.
[2:05:27] Come on now with all your heart.
[2:05:30] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[2:05:35] keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:05:38] My God, that is who you are.
[2:05:46] [Music]
[2:05:47] Even when I don't see it,
[2:05:51] Even when I don't feel it,
[2:05:55] you never stop. You never stop working.
[2:05:59] You never stop. You never stop working.
[2:06:03] Even when I don't see it, you're
[2:06:06] working. Even when I don't feel it, you
[2:06:12] never stop. You never stop working. You
[2:06:16] never stop. You never stop working.
[2:06:20] Even when I don't see it, you're
[2:06:23] working.
[2:06:24] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[2:06:27] working. You never stop. You never stop
[2:06:31] working. You never stop. You never stop
[2:06:35] working.
[2:06:37] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[2:06:41] keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:06:45] My God, that is who you are.
[2:06:51] Oh, you're you're way maker, miracle
[2:06:56] worker, miracle worker, promise keeper,
[2:07:00] light in the darkness.
[2:07:02] My God, that is who you are.
[2:07:08] That is who you are.
[2:07:12] That is who you are.
[2:07:17] That is who you are.
[2:07:21] That is who you are,
[2:07:26] Lord. That's who you are to us. We love
[2:07:29] you, Lord Jesus. We thank you for this
[2:07:30] wonderful day. Thank you for these
[2:07:32] people, believers of your word, those
[2:07:35] who accept the love and liberty that
[2:07:37] Christ offers.
[2:07:39] May none leave here today, Lord,
[2:07:43] empty of every promise of God.
[2:07:46] May none leave here today, Lord, failing
[2:07:49] to acquire and achieve all that God has
[2:07:52] for them.
[2:07:54] You paid a terrible price for it, Lord.
[2:07:58] But that day on Calvary means, Lord, it
[2:08:01] literally means the world to me.
[2:08:03] It means life in this world and the next
[2:08:05] one coming
[2:08:07] and all the new heavens and the new
[2:08:09] earth afterward. If it wasn't for you,
[2:08:12] you made it all possible, Lord. No
[2:08:14] wonder,
[2:08:16] no wonder
[2:08:18] that Revelation chapter 1,
[2:08:22] it brings glory to you.
[2:08:25] I am the Alpha, the Omega, the first,
[2:08:28] the last, the beginning, the end, the
[2:08:30] Almighty,
[2:08:32] Lord. And and he it says there that you
[2:08:36] have made us kings and priests to God.
[2:08:39] We are your ambassadors today. Help us
[2:08:41] to absorb the weight of that. take it on
[2:08:43] as a responsibility.
[2:08:46] May we realize that our short little
[2:08:49] vapor of a life here, Lord, is it's it's
[2:08:53] not even it's not even worth living if
[2:08:56] we don't have eternal life. A man that's
[2:08:59] born of a woman is just a few days and
[2:09:01] full of trouble and it's just a vapor.
[2:09:04] It appears for a little while, vanishes
[2:09:06] away. What What's the point if I don't
[2:09:08] have eternal life? What's the point if
[2:09:11] I'm not living for you?
[2:09:14] And then I can live on. That's the
[2:09:15] beauty of the gospel. That I can live on
[2:09:17] beyond this world. Live on beyond when
[2:09:20] the world is on fire. Lord, when they
[2:09:24] have set it ablaze themselves, it won't
[2:09:26] be you doing it. Mankind will do it to
[2:09:28] himself.
[2:09:30] But Lord, at that time, that table
[2:09:32] thousands of miles long, I want to be
[2:09:34] sitting there across from the saints of
[2:09:35] old. I want to know, Lord God, and I can
[2:09:38] testify at the top of my lungs. It
[2:09:42] wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I
[2:09:45] commit these people into your hands,
[2:09:46] this whole day of fellowship now into
[2:09:49] your hands. Commit them all to you in
[2:09:52] Jesus name. Go with them, Father.
[2:09:55] Continue to speak to them, deal with
[2:09:56] them tonight. Perhaps when they lay
[2:09:59] their head on their pillow, they'll
[2:10:00] remember the service and they'll
[2:10:01] remember the words they heard. And maybe
[2:10:04] that'll be enough to have a conversation
[2:10:06] that will lead them to thee. Lord, for
[2:10:08] those who already know you, may it be a
[2:10:10] doubling of their effort. May they may
[2:10:13] it be a rededication of our lives. I
[2:10:15] know how it that's how it makes me feel.
[2:10:16] Lord, I want to run harder, faster,
[2:10:18] climb higher, reach forward, press, as
[2:10:21] Paul said, toward that toward that mark.
[2:10:25] That pressing doesn't represent
[2:10:26] something easy. It's a straining.
[2:10:28] Strain, press, reach, stretch. There's a
[2:10:31] there's a prize. There's a high calling
[2:10:33] to be obtained.
[2:10:36] May it be our portion today. We love you
[2:10:39] in Jesus name. God bless you friends.
[2:10:42] Greet one another again in the love of
[2:10:44] God. Say God bless you. You can be
[2:10:46] dismissed at your leisure in the name of
[2:10:48] Jesus. We'll see you out in fellowship.
[2:10:50] God bless you. God bless to all of our
[2:10:52] visitors. Happy to have you here today.
[2:10:54] Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[2:10:56] Love you, Lord.
[2:11:00] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[2:11:06] All my days
[2:11:09] I've been held in your hands.
[2:11:15] From the moment that I wake up
[2:11:20] until I lay my head,
[2:11:24] I will sing
[2:11:27] of the goodness
[2:11:29] of God.
[2:11:33] [Music]
[2:11:35] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:11:41] [Applause]
[2:11:44] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:11:53] And every breath that I am able
[2:11:59] I will sing
[2:12:02] of the goodness
[2:12:04] of God.
[2:12:08] I love your heart.
[2:12:13] You have led me through the fire
[2:12:19] in darkest nights.
[2:12:22] You are close like no other.
[2:12:28] I've known you as a father.
[2:12:32] I've known you as a friend.
[2:12:36] And I have lived
[2:12:39] in the goodness
[2:12:42] of God.
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:48] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:12:52] [Applause]
[2:12:56] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:13:04] With every breath that I am made. Oh,
[2:13:11] I will sing
[2:13:14] of the goodness
[2:13:16] of God.
[2:13:19] Oh,
[2:13:21] your goodness is running after running
[2:13:26] after me.
[2:13:30] Your goodness is running after running
[2:13:34] after me.
[2:13:38] I lay down. I surrender now. I give you
[2:13:43] everything.
[2:13:47] Your goodness is running after, running
[2:13:51] after me.
[2:13:54] Oh,
[2:13:55] your goodness is running after. Running
[2:14:00] after me.
[2:14:04] Your goodness is running after running
[2:14:08] after me.
[2:14:11] With my life laid down, I'm surrender
[2:14:15] now. I give you everything.
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:19] [Applause]
[2:14:21] Your goodness is running after running
[2:14:25] after me.
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:32] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:14:40] And all my life you have been so so
[2:14:46] good.
[2:14:50] Every breath that I am made,
[2:14:56] I will sing.
[2:15:03] [Music]
