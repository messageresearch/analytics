[48:26] amen to come with an expectation i know
[48:29] that i did expecting to hear from the
[48:31] lord this morning revelations chapter 10
[48:33] let's just begin reading at verse one
[48:36] and i saw another mighty angel
[48:38] come down from heaven
[48:40] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[48:43] upon his head and his face was as it
[48:46] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[48:49] fire
[48:50] and he had in his hand a little book
[48:53] open
[48:54] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[48:56] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[48:59] notice with a loud voice
[49:02] as when a lion roareth
[49:05] and when he had cry when he had cried
[49:07] seven thunders
[49:09] uttered their voices
[49:11] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[49:12] their voices i was about to write and i
[49:16] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[49:18] seal up those things which the seven
[49:21] thunders uttered and write them not
[49:24] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[49:26] sea and upon the earth
[49:28] lifted up his hand to heaven
[49:31] and swore by him that liveth forever and
[49:33] ever who created heaven
[49:36] and the things that are therein just
[49:38] dropped me bring me back up if you could
[49:41] seems like i lost it there and the earth
[49:43] and the things that are the and the
[49:45] earth
[49:46] and the things that therein are in the
[49:48] sea and the things which are therein
[49:50] that there should be time no longer but
[49:53] in the days of the voice are you glad
[49:56] we're living in the days of the voice of
[49:59] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[50:02] sound the mystery of god should be
[50:05] finished
[50:06] as he hath declared to his servants the
[50:08] prophets
[50:10] let's just bow our heads we're gonna
[50:11] we're gonna continue reading but let's
[50:13] stop there lord we thank you father for
[50:15] your presence i know lord that everyone
[50:18] who's gathered here today
[50:20] lord came not to hear me
[50:22] father but they came to hear from heaven
[50:24] they came to have a divine communication
[50:27] a channel lord where you could reveal
[50:30] yourself to them in a greater way i know
[50:32] that every person here would lord have a
[50:35] desire just to know you more we came
[50:37] today lord because we love you that's

[50:46] here lord now waiting for you to speak i
[50:48] pray god that you would come lord and do
[50:50] what i can't do my words are just just
[50:53] feeble
[50:55] words lord of a man who can fail but
[50:57] your word lord is eternal and we look to
[51:00] it today i pray you bless each and every
[51:02] single one for these needs that were
[51:04] written in for my mother-in-law may you

[51:24] pray that you would continue to touch
[51:26] their family lord for each and every
[51:28] single one of us here today we ask that
[51:30] you would just receive our worship as we
[51:32] enter in now in jesus christ's name amen
[51:35] you can be seated this morning amen
[51:42] we spoke last sunday and i'm just going
[51:44] to have you if you could have that
[51:46] powerpoint ready
[51:48] brother
[51:48] caleb we spoke last sunday of the the
[51:51] order of the anointing
[51:54] and i'm not going to do too much recap
[51:56] of what we spoke on but we're just going
[51:58] to pick up from where we left off and
[52:01] never so much i didn't get to that i'm
[52:03] i'm just thankful the lord gave us this
[52:05] opportunity to share this uh to you
[52:08] but we spoke and took uh showed you the
[52:11] the faith of peter and how that peter's
[52:14] faith was so different
[52:16] before and after the upper room
[52:19] and peter's faith which seemed really
[52:21] profound and lord i'll never deny you
[52:23] and and uh i'll never forsake you and
[52:26] and here's peter's broad and bold and uh
[52:30] faith that he speaks and and yet just a
[52:32] little while later we read in the book
[52:34] of luke how that jesus said before the
[52:36] crows three times you'll deny me
[52:39] peter oh lord i'll never deny you i i
[52:41] would never walk away from the message i
[52:43] would never walk away from where else
[52:45] would i go this is the same man who
[52:47] spoke these same exact words
[52:49] so words are good it's good for the
[52:51] redeemed to say so we believe in the in
[52:53] words we believe in verbalizing our
[52:56] faith but verbal faith isn't enough as
[53:00] we took time to show you
[53:02] intellectual faith just saying that you
[53:04] believe it's an important step it's
[53:07] important that we profess and we confess
[53:10] what we believe but ultimately what we
[53:12] find out is that when peter's faith
[53:15] was put to the test and he was under the
[53:18] pressure his faith failed him
[53:22] and so we say it was an anointing that
[53:24] we spoke on and we read the quote and
[53:26] i'm not i don't think i had it here on
[53:29] our slide uh i don't think that i do but
[53:32] so i'm just gonna i'm just going to
[53:34] reference it today
[53:36] but we spoke about how that brother
[53:38] branham speaks of the anointing that can
[53:40] come on the flesh and he spoke of david
[53:42] and the revival and if you're going to
[53:44] read the rest of that quote and trying
[53:46] to do god a service without it being his
[53:48] will brother branham talks about how
[53:50] that they were hooping and hollering and
[53:52] shouting and he said he had all the
[53:54] signs of a revival but it wasn't god at
[53:58] all
[53:58] so he shows how that the holy spirit
[54:01] could come and anoint your flesh it
[54:03] could anoint your flesh and you can jump
[54:05] up and down and you could shout
[54:08] the
[54:10] mind and you could understand things and
[54:12] you can maybe intellectually rationalize
[54:15] and see something yet that not really be
[54:18] god at all uh it could be a step of god
[54:22] bringing you towards something but
[54:23] brother branham says that all depends
[54:26] on the he says it all depends on the
[54:29] order
[54:30] of the anointing and so it was it was
[54:33] something that would happen to peter
[54:35] after
[54:36] pentecost that would be different than
[54:39] what he had prior
[54:42] jesus says he that believeth on me shall
[54:44] out of his belly flow rivers of living
[54:46] water if you go read i think that's
[54:48] matthew 7 and if you go and read the
[54:51] parentheses in your king james bible it
[54:54] says but he spoke of the spirit which
[54:56] had not yet
[54:58] been given so there was an anointing
[55:01] there was an anointing of the spirit
[55:03] that had been given to shamgar that's
[55:05] how he just just slayed the philistines
[55:07] there was an anointing of the holy ghost
[55:09] that came upon david and so much that he
[55:11] would pray i pray that your spirit your
[55:13] holy spirit depart not from me right
[55:17] so the anointing that came upon him to
[55:19] slay goliath there was an anointing of
[55:21] the holy spirit that came upon shadrach
[55:23] meshach and abednego for them to face
[55:26] the fiery furnace but yet what was going
[55:28] to take place in the upper room was
[55:31] going to be different than anything that
[55:33] anyone had ever experienced before
[55:37] because now that spirit that dwelt in
[55:40] christ would be poured out to a church
[55:43] and it would be greater than an
[55:44] anointing on your flesh it would be
[55:47] greater than an anointing on your on
[55:49] your spirit but it would be an anointing
[55:52] or a tabernacling of the presence of god
[55:54] in your soul
[55:57] and so what we our goal here today are
[56:00] the marker the goal that we're striving
[56:02] for is not to hoop up and hype up an
[56:05] anointed spirit of god when it comes and
[56:07] i feel my feet get to dancing but my
[56:09] goal is to say lord move it beyond my
[56:12] intellectual room move it beyond my
[56:15] human emotional realm and let it sink
[56:17] into the soul
[56:19] to where the gates of hell can't prevail
[56:21] against that
[56:24] amen so it's not based upon feeling let
[56:27] me just say the message of the hour the
[56:29] revival of the message of the hour was
[56:32] not an emotional revival it was not an
[56:36] intellectual revival it was a word
[56:39] revival
[56:41] and that word revival brings knowledge
[56:43] of the word and it brings emotion
[56:45] because it's the full unveiling of
[56:47] christ and all of his person
[56:50] and so not in the human spirit but the
[56:52] true conversion of the heart takes place
[56:55] in the soul and it's not based upon
[56:58] feelings and it's not based upon what
[57:00] you understand and what you don't
[57:03] understand amen
[57:04] it's based upon a revelation from god
[57:08] listen to what we we took time and we
[57:10] showed how that brother branham stood in
[57:12] the middle of the road and you know that
[57:14] there's always that see-saw effect and
[57:16] any time you get take the see-saw all
[57:18] the way down this way and then you you
[57:21] got it you got to we got to correct that
[57:23] so so we take the see-saw the other way
[57:25] and brother branham said there's always
[57:27] two ditches between calvinism armenism
[57:29] one example that he uses
[57:31] right towards a baptist uh
[57:33] intellectual conception and a frolic or
[57:36] a fanaticism of pentecost and brother
[57:38] branham says there's two ditches and he
[57:40] says but the bride goes right through
[57:43] the middle
[57:44] calling upon both of them amen
[57:48] right
[57:49] listen to what the prophet says i love
[57:51] this so much and you can just display
[57:53] the first slide and the greatest news
[57:55] flash in history he says some people
[57:57] make the gospel if you could advance
[57:59] brother caleb stay stay with me this
[58:01] morning because i got a lot of a lot of
[58:03] slides
[58:04] some people make the gospel a funeral
[58:06] procession
[58:08] [Music]
[58:10] that's right they go to church and just
[58:13] like it was a funeral possession
[58:15] others make it a frolic that's right
[58:18] some of them just make it a frolic just
[58:20] make it a just a big time to go and play
[58:22] a bunch of music jump up and down on a
[58:24] platform dance all over the platformer
[58:27] down in the aisle and run and sit down
[58:29] and talk about their neighbors
[58:32] are you with me
[58:34] that's right some of them thinks they
[58:36] ought to stand and say the doxology and
[58:38] the apostles creed so-called
[1:02:19] you
[1:05:21] you
[1:06:56] so he could look at
[1:06:58] a dead dying body
[1:07:01] he could look in the mirror and he could
[1:07:03] see stoop shoulders he could see sarah
[1:07:06] who had wrinkles was way past the age of
[1:07:09] giving birth
[1:07:11] sarah and abraham could wake up every
[1:07:12] day and look in the mirror and see their
[1:07:14] current condition and look at the
[1:07:17] promise of the word and choose to deny
[1:07:20] what they've seen with their eyes
[1:07:23] and believe what the word of god said
[1:07:25] about them
[1:07:26] this is the characteristic of a true
[1:07:29] believer when you can look beyond
[1:07:31] yourself
[1:07:32] oh come on somebody when you can look
[1:07:34] beyond your inadequacies and your
[1:07:36] failures and you can look to what the
[1:07:39] word said about you and say i choose to
[1:07:42] believe this
[1:07:45] and cast down any vain imaginations
[1:07:50] and he says though he's called a con
[1:07:52] church though it wasn't so now faith
[1:07:53] that's what faith is
[1:07:55] is the revelation of god the church is
[1:07:58] built upon the revelation
[1:08:01] the whole
[1:08:02] entire
[1:08:03] body amen so we get this question as we
[1:08:07] spoke on last time that it's do you you
[1:08:10] we spoke on all the different
[1:08:11] philosophies of history and we spoke on
[1:08:13] romanticism and and all of these isms
[1:08:16] that you have and rationalism and and so
[1:08:19] we we look at this and we say well you
[1:08:21] know if if you could if you couldn't
[1:08:24] actually vindicate i was asked this
[1:08:26] question
[1:08:27] if we could not actually vindicate the
[1:08:30] message of the hour by facts and that
[1:08:32] was the word this person was using by
[1:08:34] facts i want to read you the definition
[1:08:36] of fact you can mute that for a second a
[1:08:38] fact means a thing
[1:08:40] that is indisputably
[1:08:43] the case
[1:08:44] that's what a fact is
[1:08:46] so let me show you what the difference
[1:08:48] between fact a thing that is
[1:08:50] indisputably the case versus what
[1:08:52] revelation means revelation is the
[1:08:55] supernatural communication of truth
[1:08:59] to the mind
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:03] you know what that means that means no
[1:09:04] one else's no one i'm not i was going to
[1:09:07] say no one else's opinion matters let me
[1:09:09] rephrase that no one has an opinion
[1:09:14] when revelation strikes your heart all
[1:09:16] opinions are off
[1:09:19] to abraham it wasn't the opinion of
[1:09:21] anybody it was it was elohim who
[1:09:24] revealed himself to abraham and that was
[1:09:26] where his faith was rested
[1:09:28] not on intellect so some people mentally
[1:09:32] believe they intellectually as peter
[1:09:34] followed jesus up until that point
[1:09:36] intellectually mentally
[1:09:38] and they could have great professions of
[1:09:40] faith as peter did i'll never deny you
[1:09:42] lord but when the real test comes
[1:09:45] they show their true colors
[1:09:47] and so some people can mentally believe
[1:09:50] they can mentally follow the message of
[1:09:52] the hour because because why because my
[1:09:54] parents told me this was truth
[1:09:57] because mom and dad told me this was
[1:09:59] true then i was raised and their mom and
[1:10:01] dad told their mom and dad and their mom
[1:10:03] and dad told their mom and dad and you
[1:10:04] know you can get a believer a person in
[1:10:07] church who is there at church at a
[1:10:08] message church believing confessing
[1:10:11] mentally intellectually brother man are
[1:10:13] you criticizing i'm not criticizing that
[1:10:15] at all that's very normal and very
[1:10:16] natural
[1:10:17] but the necessity is is that that
[1:10:20] changes
[1:10:21] from mom and dad taught me and mom and
[1:10:23] dad told mom and dad and mom and dad
[1:10:25] told mom and dad and it's based upon
[1:10:27] facts because they have facts of
[1:10:29] indication of facts you see that'll
[1:10:31] never hold you
[1:10:32] but when that changes from fact and
[1:10:34] changes from mom and dad and elohim
[1:10:37] himself comes to that individual and
[1:10:40] supernaturally communicates the truth of
[1:10:43] the word of god and you know what that
[1:10:45] means mom and dad can walk away and my
[1:10:47] mom and grandpa and grandma can walk
[1:10:49] away and the pastor can walk away but
[1:10:52] that faith will still hold you
[1:10:54] hallelujah that faith will still hold
[1:10:56] you it's your rock it's your revelation
[1:10:59] and nothing can shake that
[1:11:02] jesus said upon this rock i'll build my
[1:11:04] church
[1:11:06] it's amazing what things reveal what
[1:11:09] people's faith is really anchored in
[1:11:13] you see people who follow the message
[1:11:15] for years and then watch maybe based
[1:11:17] upon the revelation or the experience of
[1:11:19] their grandpa who was a pastor or the
[1:11:20] grandma who was a pa a
[1:11:22] wife of a pastor and they got this
[1:11:24] experience and then watched when grandpa
[1:11:26] goes off the scene and grandma goes off
[1:11:28] the scene and they're no longer there
[1:11:30] they hold for a little while but
[1:11:31] eventually because that was what was
[1:11:33] anchoring them
[1:11:35] when my mom and dad or grandma and
[1:11:37] grandpa leave now that anchor's been
[1:11:38] ripped loose and they're floating like a
[1:11:40] boat in the tide
[1:11:42] and they'll hold them for a little while
[1:11:44] but before you know it they're way
[1:11:45] downstream
[1:11:49] so some people believe this by because
[1:11:52] well the message is vindicated by facts
[1:11:54] some follow let me tell you some follow
[1:11:56] the bible not just believers some people
[1:11:59] go to church and claim christianity
[1:12:01] but for the same reasons well
[1:12:02] historically it's factually proven and
[1:12:04] scientifically proven but let me just
[1:12:06] say this i'm just going to cut through
[1:12:07] the chase here the message
[1:12:09] nor the bible can be vindicated but
[1:12:12] because everybody's opinions always
[1:12:14] change and everybody is an arbiter of
[1:12:16] their own truth
[1:12:19] so is it was it meant to be based upon
[1:12:21] scientific evidence and that we
[1:12:23] understand this by facts some people
[1:12:26] follow brother from some people follow
[1:12:28] the bible this way but let me tell you
[1:12:29] what history says as we said last sunday
[1:12:32] historically pilate never existed right
[1:12:37] factually by the facts
[1:12:41] by the facts
[1:12:42] you know what most people's facts are is
[1:12:44] www.google.com
[1:12:48] and that's gospel man that is the truth
[1:12:51] just just type it out
[1:12:54] and certain people it's sad because
[1:12:55] nowadays they don't even look at the you
[1:12:58] don't even go through and research
[1:12:59] actual articles you just look at the
[1:13:00] first ansel google gives you
[1:13:04] it's like people when they feel uh heart
[1:13:07] pain associated with our chest pain
[1:13:09] associated with shoulder pain and the
[1:13:10] ears itching what is that the symptom of
[1:13:16] cancer oh i got cancer and they go to
[1:13:17] the doctor i diagnose myself i need to
[1:13:20] be treated right now
[1:13:23] it's amazing how quickly people just
[1:13:25] believe anything that they want to
[1:13:27] believe or anything that they read
[1:13:30] and let me just say this pilate never
[1:13:33] existed by the facts until 1962
[1:13:36] when some archaeologists discovered an
[1:13:38] archaeological site a
[1:13:40] a inscription in a column
[1:13:42] and it was the seal of pontus pilot
[1:13:45] and you know what all of those people
[1:13:47] who said pilate never existed now go
[1:13:48] well i guess intellectually i got
[1:13:50] scientifically by fact he did
[1:13:52] actually exist
[1:13:55] you know what my faith didn't change
[1:13:58] when i found out they found pilate's
[1:13:59] inscription i believe that pilate
[1:14:01] existed before the inscription was found
[1:14:04] i believe he existed before when science
[1:14:06] said he never did
[1:14:08] science today says the messiah never
[1:14:10] existed he never walked he was in a
[1:14:12] different time frame or error than even
[1:14:14] the apostle paul does that shake your
[1:14:16] faith brother man no because my faith
[1:14:18] isn't resting on the failure or the
[1:14:21] fruit the
[1:14:22] the the futility of man's mind or his
[1:14:26] understanding
[1:14:27] my faith is resting in nothing less
[1:14:30] than the revelation of god himself
[1:14:33] revealing himself to me can you say amen
[1:14:37] so it's a revelation
[1:14:40] it's a revelation and it's not just well
[1:14:42] in the message we just have a it's just
[1:14:44] we just have a greater understanding
[1:14:46] i've heard people say that very
[1:14:47] sincerely well what's the difference
[1:14:49] between the baptist church and the
[1:14:50] message of the hour well in the message
[1:14:52] we just have a little bit more
[1:14:54] understanding of what the bible says
[1:14:56] friends if that's all the message is to
[1:14:58] you you've never had a revelation of the
[1:15:00] message of the hour right
[1:15:02] never
[1:15:03] and that's okay that's where some people
[1:15:05] are at here today that's why we're
[1:15:07] preaching here today amen not here to
[1:15:09] criticize you or to kick you i'm here to
[1:15:10] help you yeah amen
[1:15:13] oh it's just a little bit further it's
[1:15:15] just we just got a little bit more light
[1:15:17] so the way you said to the man why is
[1:15:18] that important because the way you view
[1:15:22] the message is very important and
[1:15:25] crucial to how you're going to live amen
[1:15:29] how you view the message of the hour the
[1:15:31] same exact way with how you view the
[1:15:33] bible if you don't believe the bible is
[1:15:35] the infallible word of god it will
[1:15:37] determine how you live your life
[1:15:40] it will make up the way you view the
[1:15:43] world it will make up the way that you
[1:15:45] view god it will make up the way you
[1:15:47] view tragedy when tragedy strikes
[1:15:51] it will may it will shape and define the
[1:15:53] way you go through sorrow when you lose
[1:15:55] a loved one based upon how you view the
[1:15:58] word of god amen
[1:16:02] so let me just say this the message the
[1:16:05] elected bride of christ it's not just
[1:16:07] another level it's not just a well we're
[1:16:10] just on a different level no no friends
[1:16:12] to be the bride is an entirely different
[1:16:16] calling amen
[1:16:18] than the church
[1:16:20] it's an entirely different calling
[1:16:23] altogether it's god's choice
[1:16:25] and not yours and not your moms and not
[1:16:27] your dads
[1:16:28] and not your enemies thank god
[1:16:31] it's god's choice
[1:16:33] and god chooses he didn't choose israel
[1:16:35] because of their behavior or because of
[1:16:38] their looks or how great they were but
[1:16:41] they were dirt daubers as the prophet of
[1:16:42] god called them just tent dwellers
[1:16:45] but israel wasn't just on another level
[1:16:47] than every other nation they were
[1:16:49] totally the bible says separated unto
[1:16:52] god for his own good pleasure god loved
[1:16:55] all humanity but he showed a special
[1:16:58] love to abraham's seed they were elected
[1:17:01] by grace let me just say the message of
[1:17:04] the hour is an election by nothing else
[1:17:07] than grace upon grace
[1:17:10] upon grace
[1:17:12] it's amazing to me and i'm just going to
[1:17:14] take time to go through this before we
[1:17:15] get to some of our slides it's
[1:17:17] incredible how people want to come years
[1:17:20] years after brother branham leaves the
[1:17:22] scene
[1:17:23] and they start to question his honesty
[1:17:25] and they start to question his
[1:17:26] vindication and start to question as we
[1:17:29] said last sunday it would be like
[1:17:30] questioning if we had no youtube videos
[1:17:32] to show us mike tyson's best top 10
[1:17:35] knockouts
[1:17:37] it'd be like me showing you who who was
[1:17:39] who was one of uh mike tyson's uh
[1:17:41] greatest you can name ten of them
[1:17:43] greatest knockouts go to this highlight
[1:17:45] reel it'd be the same as if we didn't
[1:17:47] have the proof or the youtube video and
[1:17:50] then mike tyson was just a story that
[1:17:52] was told by your dad and your dad's dad
[1:17:54] told him and then his dad told him and
[1:17:57] oh my iron mike they caught him why did
[1:17:59] they call him iron mic oh you should
[1:18:00] have seen his left hook you should have
[1:18:02] seen his jab you should have seen the
[1:18:03] incredible mic it'd be like me going you
[1:18:06] know what i don't
[1:18:07] you know
[1:18:09] mike mike was good i'm sure mike was
[1:18:11] good but i think i could have took mike
[1:18:15] i think mike would hold anything to me
[1:18:17] could you imagine how dumb that would be
[1:18:19] how foolish
[1:18:20] mike really wasn't nothing you know go
[1:18:23] ask the top 10 men who are laying on the
[1:18:25] mat
[1:18:26] about mike tyson's left hook go ask him
[1:18:29] about his jab go ask him if he was all
[1:18:31] that oh it's the same exact way you go
[1:18:33] ask cancer if brother branham was a
[1:18:36] vindicated prophet go ask tuberculosis
[1:18:39] if he was a dishonest man who just made
[1:18:41] everything up you go ask death himself
[1:18:45] and i promise you you'll get a different
[1:18:47] testimony than some of these that you
[1:18:48] see on google.com
[1:18:52] [Applause]
[1:18:54] go ask brother edmund way
[1:18:56] go ask for the edmond way when brother
[1:18:58] branham tells in the sermon and he tells
[1:19:00] about the cloud the supernatural cloud
[1:19:02] that appeared over flagstaff arizona and
[1:19:05] brother branham tell us about it you've
[1:19:06] seen it there in the magazine the
[1:19:08] constellation of seven angels
[1:19:10] you know what happened in that service
[1:19:12] brother way passed away was dead a nurse
[1:19:14] there on the scene checked his pulse and
[1:19:16] he was dead god through the through the
[1:19:19] ministry of brother branham raised that
[1:19:21] man from the dead yeah
[1:19:24] so you go ask death himself what he
[1:19:26] thought about brother branham yeah
[1:19:29] hello
[1:19:30] it's amazing how man's thoughts are
[1:19:33] exalted to such a place that they can't
[1:19:36] even see how foolish they really are
[1:19:40] romans chapter 1 verse 21 in the screen
[1:19:42] if you could put it up romans chapter 1
[1:19:45] verse 21 because that listen when they
[1:19:48] knew god when they
[1:19:50] knew
[1:19:52] god now that's an important word
[1:19:54] when they because of what's going to
[1:19:56] follow when they knew this is the word
[1:19:58] for gnosis it means to intellectually
[1:20:01] know something to know it based upon
[1:20:04] fact
[1:20:05] when they knew god they glorified him
[1:20:08] not as god neither were thankful but
[1:20:11] became vain in their imaginations
[1:20:15] vain means what to exalt yourself
[1:20:19] they became vain
[1:20:21] they be they exalted their imagination
[1:20:24] this is saying when they knew god
[1:20:26] intellectually then their intellect
[1:20:28] became their god and their intellectual
[1:20:31] understanding replaced what god's word
[1:20:33] said
[1:20:35] but became vain in their imagination and
[1:20:38] their foolish heart was darkened
[1:20:41] notice professing themselves to be
[1:20:44] wise they became
[1:20:47] fools
[1:20:51] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:20:54] became fools skipped in verse 25
[1:20:57] who changed the truth of god into a lie
[1:21:01] and worshiped and served the creature
[1:21:05] yeah amen
[1:21:06] this is the creature
[1:21:08] this is the creature
[1:21:10] they worshipped and served the creature
[1:21:14] more than the creator
[1:21:17] and paul can't even take that he just
[1:21:18] writes it in there who is blessed
[1:21:20] forever amen
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:23] they worship the creature more than the
[1:21:26] creator for this cause god gave them up
[1:21:29] unto vile affections for even their
[1:21:31] women did change their natural use and
[1:21:33] of that which is against nature and
[1:21:35] likewise the men
[1:21:37] leaving the natural use of the woman
[1:21:39] burned in their lusts one towards
[1:21:43] another men with men
[1:21:45] working that which is unseemingly and
[1:21:47] receiving what what brother how did we
[1:21:50] get to this
[1:21:51] because they exalted the creature above
[1:21:54] the creator because they became vain in
[1:21:58] their own imagination they believed so
[1:22:01] much they had so much confidence in
[1:22:03] their science they had so much
[1:22:05] confidence in their google facts they
[1:22:07] had so much confidence in their
[1:22:08] education they had so much confidence in
[1:22:11] critical thinking and scholars and
[1:22:12] philosophy
[1:22:15] that it eventually explained away
[1:22:18] the word of god
[1:22:20] you say brother matt that leads to this
[1:22:24] let me just say this and as a warning
[1:22:26] i'm going to say it to everybody that's
[1:22:27] here but especially our young people
[1:22:29] when you leave the truth of the message
[1:22:31] of the hour it is a bottomless
[1:22:34] pit
[1:22:36] amen when you lose the stability that
[1:22:40] the word of god brings and you leave the
[1:22:43] message yes
[1:22:45] this is what happens yeah amen
[1:22:48] you say that not all of them some of
[1:22:49] them know you're right some of them go
[1:22:51] worse than that worse than fleshly
[1:22:53] outward sins they become religious
[1:22:57] which brother branham says the hardest
[1:22:58] demon to break more than more than
[1:23:00] alcohol more than drugs is a religious
[1:23:04] spirit and he says in verse 20 and even
[1:23:08] as they did not like to retain god in
[1:23:10] their knowledge god gave them over to a
[1:23:12] reprobate mind to do those things which
[1:23:14] are not convenient being filled with all
[1:23:16] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[1:23:18] covetousness maliciousness full of envy
[1:23:20] murder
[1:23:22] debate
[1:23:23] isn't that interesting that's in there
[1:23:27] hello
[1:23:29] what's the first people that want to
[1:23:30] debate you when they leave the message
[1:23:32] oh i'll give me a debate
[1:23:34] they become full of wickedness
[1:23:36] covetousness maliciousness full of envy
[1:23:38] murder debate
[1:23:40] deceit
[1:23:41] malignity whisperers
[1:23:44] backbiters
[1:23:46] haters of god despiteful proud
[1:23:50] boasters
[1:23:51] inventors of evil things we could speak
[1:23:54] a lot about that
[1:23:56] disobedient
[1:23:57] to parents without understanding
[1:24:00] covenant breakers without natural
[1:24:02] affection implacable and merciful who
[1:24:05] knowing the judgment of god that they
[1:24:08] which commit such things are worthy of
[1:24:10] death not only do the same but have
[1:24:12] pleasure and film that do them
[1:24:14] is isn't it incredible to you how these
[1:24:17] men and women who leave the message of
[1:24:19] the hour are so emboldened by their new
[1:24:23] found freedom
[1:24:25] just so emboldened by this new found
[1:24:27] freedom
[1:24:29] even becoming more bold and more
[1:24:30] religious than they ever were sitting in
[1:24:32] church
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:35] and they don't just leave the message
[1:24:37] but now they become
[1:24:39] anti-message
[1:24:41] we could speak about you said brother
[1:24:42] matt you're speaking people leave the
[1:24:43] message i'm talking about anyone who
[1:24:45] leaves the faith
[1:24:46] same exact thing that happens you go and
[1:24:48] watch anybody who becomes an atheist
[1:24:50] after years two men i used to watch
[1:24:52] their youtube videos hilarious rhett and
[1:24:54] link
[1:24:55] someone had showed me a few videos of
[1:24:57] there some funny just comical videos
[1:24:58] watched two or three of them funny guys
[1:25:00] they were professed christians leaders
[1:25:02] of the uh of the the the um the promise
[1:25:06] keepers movement great evangelical
[1:25:08] movement here in the states
[1:25:10] they were two proponents two of the
[1:25:12] leaders of that group and they did an
[1:25:14] entire series on there i forget that i
[1:25:16] think they called it their
[1:25:16] deconstruction of faith how they looked
[1:25:19] into the facts of jesus they realized
[1:25:21] how messy the facts of jesus were how
[1:25:23] messy they lost they first you know what
[1:25:25] they said their first the first thing
[1:25:26] that they lost was their faith in the
[1:25:28] old testament
[1:25:30] lost their faith in the validity of the
[1:25:32] old testament then it went from there
[1:25:33] and it's a bottomless pit and it went
[1:25:34] from there to there to there to there to
[1:25:36] there
[1:25:37] it's so incredible as i was just looking
[1:25:38] at this yesterday evening it's so
[1:25:40] incredible that they don't just leave
[1:25:43] the faith they become anti-faith
[1:25:45] evangelists
[1:25:48] they don't realize they're fulfilling
[1:25:50] the scripture professing them to be wise
[1:25:53] they become fools
[1:25:55] how foolish is it in reality here's what
[1:25:58] exactly what they're saying i've been
[1:26:00] living this is what i'm going to profess
[1:26:02] this is what they're saying i've been
[1:26:03] living and preaching and uh teaching
[1:26:07] something boldly for 20 years i've been
[1:26:09] behind this pulpit i've been preaching
[1:26:11] it i've been living it i've been
[1:26:13] teaching it for 20 years i've led
[1:26:15] generations i've led generations of
[1:26:18] people
[1:26:19] with my teachings but now i no longer
[1:26:21] believe them therefore i'm going to
[1:26:23] boldly and loudly tell people it was all
[1:26:25] wrong while i boldly and loudly lead
[1:26:28] people into my next truth
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:35] there's there's no shame there's no bow
[1:26:36] was wrong they don't question themselves
[1:26:40] same people leave the message i was
[1:26:41] wrong for i preached it and taught it
[1:26:43] and lived it for 20 years but now it's
[1:26:44] wrong so now i'm going to bold i
[1:26:46] preached it boldly and loudly so now i'm
[1:26:48] going to boldly and loudly teach you to
[1:26:50] follow me they there's the problem you
[1:26:52] don't follow a person who doesn't even
[1:26:54] know where they're going
[1:26:55] you don't follow a person who has no
[1:26:57] direction they're just aimlessly
[1:26:59] questioning and doubting everything they
[1:27:01] have no answers they only have more
[1:27:03] questions
[1:27:04] because they appeal to the intellectual
[1:27:06] reasoning of man they have eve's
[1:27:09] interpreter as brother branham would say
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:12] they've appealed to the human
[1:27:14] intellectual reasoning of man why are
[1:27:17] they so eager to lead people
[1:27:20] when you can clearly see they have no
[1:27:22] idea where they're heading so you say
[1:27:24] brother matt what does this mean it's
[1:27:26] there's got to come a difference
[1:27:28] between an intellectual faith or an
[1:27:31] intellectual understanding of something
[1:27:33] or an anointing upon your flesh to make
[1:27:35] you shout or an anointing upon your
[1:27:37] flesh to make you dance or an anointing
[1:27:40] upon your mind to make you understand
[1:27:42] and become a theologian of the word
[1:27:44] thank god for emotion thank god for
[1:27:46] understanding thank god for teachers we
[1:27:48] need them yes amen
[1:27:51] but there's got to come something that
[1:27:52] moves beyond your mind
[1:27:55] beyond your flesh
[1:27:57] and it anchors
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:08] i'm going to move from that i've got a
[1:28:09] lot more but we just
[1:28:10] we just won't say you say there brother
[1:28:12] matt they're just ex-message believers
[1:28:13] the fact is they never were believers in
[1:28:16] the first place
[1:28:17] they weren't ex-believers like an ex an
[1:28:19] x that you are away from it's a it's a
[1:28:22] they never were a believer in the first
[1:28:24] place because to be a believer is not to
[1:28:26] say i confess this or i believe this or
[1:28:28] i understand this because intellectually
[1:28:30] i understand it but to believe a to be a
[1:28:33] believer peter understood and peter
[1:28:35] found out that there had to come
[1:28:37] something in his life that was greater
[1:28:39] than all of his human mind can
[1:28:41] understand amen
[1:28:44] so what would happen even brother
[1:28:45] branham would stand in between these two
[1:28:48] listen to this if you could put my
[1:28:49] powerpoint back up
[1:28:50] brother branham would would come in
[1:28:52] between these two so so
[1:28:54] what would you have and i don't have
[1:28:56] we're gonna have to just skip through
[1:28:58] this some of this so i'm just gonna move
[1:29:00] quickly
[1:29:01] it's 12 30 now just give me just a
[1:29:03] little bit longer i'm not going to tell
[1:29:04] you how much longer but give me a little
[1:29:06] bit longer
[1:29:08] so
[1:29:10] so you say brother matt what is it what
[1:29:12] does it mean then
[1:29:14] what is the opening of the word we read
[1:29:16] in revelations chapter 10
[1:29:19] how that i hear john if you could you
[1:29:20] could turn in your bible with me let's
[1:29:22] let's pick that up that's where we
[1:29:23] should go right now john
[1:29:25] chapter 10. notice you could put it on
[1:29:27] the screen for me revelations chapter 10
[1:29:29] let's read about this remember what we
[1:29:31] said last sunday this is revelation the
[1:29:33] book of revelation is not john's book
[1:29:37] john didn't write john on the isle of
[1:29:39] patmos did not write the book of
[1:29:41] revelation
[1:29:42] john was just the scribe
[1:29:45] jesus was the author
[1:29:49] strong angel noticed this and i saw
[1:29:50] another mighty angel come down from
[1:29:52] heaven
[1:29:53] clothed with the cloud rainbow was on
[1:29:55] his head let's move on down to verse
[1:29:57] five
[1:29:58] verse seven but in the days of the voice
[1:30:00] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:30:02] to sound the mystery of god should be
[1:30:04] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:30:06] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:30:08] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:30:11] now this is john and john is a type of
[1:30:14] the bride
[1:30:15] that's good and i'm glad we can say that
[1:30:17] and that's a cliche but i want you to
[1:30:19] put your name there i want you to say
[1:30:21] john is a type of me
[1:30:24] john is a type of me i stood there and
[1:30:26] heard the mighty heard they heard that
[1:30:28] voice which i heard from heaven spake
[1:30:30] unto me again and said go
[1:30:33] and take the little book
[1:30:35] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:30:37] go back verse eight
[1:30:39] uh he says in verse eight he says with a
[1:30:41] voice i heard from heaven said go and
[1:30:43] take the little book which is open in
[1:30:45] the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:30:47] upon the scene upon the earth and i went
[1:30:50] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[1:30:53] the little book
[1:30:54] you see what happens when the preacher
[1:30:57] shows you the open book by the preaching
[1:30:59] of the word and he preaches the message
[1:31:01] of the hour and then you stand and say
[1:31:03] give me that book
[1:31:05] that's not just your book that's my book
[1:31:08] amen when it becomes your inheritance
[1:31:10] when every promise in the book is your
[1:31:13] promise
[1:31:14] not just a promise to a church not just
[1:31:16] a promise to a prophet it's your
[1:31:18] inheritance in the holy spirit
[1:31:22] john says he says go and get the little
[1:31:24] book and i went into the angel and said
[1:31:25] unto him
[1:31:27] give me the little book
[1:31:30] and he said unto me
[1:31:33] take it
[1:31:35] and he said unto me
[1:31:37] you know the voice of the lord is
[1:31:38] telling you here today
[1:31:40] take it
[1:31:43] take every promise
[1:31:45] that the word has said
[1:31:48] and take it for yourself
[1:31:50] you need a promise for healing
[1:31:53] take it
[1:31:54] you need a promise for salvation
[1:31:56] take it need a promise for your for your
[1:31:58] children
[1:31:59] take it need a promise for your home
[1:32:02] take it need a promise for your mind the
[1:32:05] angel is saying it's one thing to say i
[1:32:07] believe it but it's another thing for
[1:32:08] the person the bride to stand up and say
[1:32:11] give me that little book
[1:32:13] it's my promise it's my inheritance
[1:32:17] amen and he said take it and eat it up
[1:32:22] eat it up
[1:32:23] eat up the open word
[1:32:25] eat up the message of the hour eat up
[1:32:28] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:32:30] eat him consume him
[1:32:33] let it be your daily bread
[1:32:36] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[1:32:39] it shall be in thy mouth
[1:32:40] sweet as honey
[1:32:44] it may may not may be hard to understand
[1:32:47] and hard to hard to hard to hard to
[1:32:49] swallow
[1:32:50] but when you believe it and you speak it
[1:32:53] it'll be sweet as honey when it comes
[1:32:55] out of your mouth
[1:32:58] so john says he says give me the little
[1:33:00] book
[1:33:01] take it eat it up and i took
[1:33:03] the little book out of the angel's hand
[1:33:05] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[1:33:07] just as the angel said
[1:33:10] it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:33:12] soon as i'd eaten my belly was bitter
[1:33:13] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:33:17] again before many people and nations and
[1:33:20] tongues and kings so what was this
[1:33:22] this was the opening this was the word
[1:33:26] the little book the open book remember
[1:33:28] it was a little book open in the hands
[1:33:30] of the angel
[1:33:32] see you say brother that what is the
[1:33:33] opening of the word let me make it i'm
[1:33:35] going to oversimplify this
[1:33:37] so you though that are streaming and
[1:33:39] hear me say this don't think i'm st this
[1:33:41] isn't this isn't all there is to it but
[1:33:43] let me oversimplify it
[1:33:45] someone asked me a young person said
[1:33:46] brother matt what does it mean what does
[1:33:47] the opening of the word mean let me open
[1:33:50] this oh let me oversimplify it means the
[1:33:53] opening of this bible
[1:33:56] to you
[1:33:59] a book that had been sealed and men had
[1:34:02] probed that
[1:34:03] and men had thought and given their
[1:34:04] ideas and it must mean this and it must
[1:34:07] mean that when the word is opened it's
[1:34:10] the bible being open to you
[1:34:12] and you say ah it's my book
[1:34:16] i see myself in there
[1:34:19] so the message of the hour
[1:34:21] what is it it was the son of man christ
[1:34:24] himself
[1:34:26] revealing himself or
[1:34:29] opening himself or unveiling himself
[1:34:34] what do you read when you read the
[1:34:36] message of the hour you're reading the
[1:34:38] opening or the unveiling of god
[1:34:41] and he's identified by his word he was
[1:34:43] identified that's why god vindicated him
[1:34:46] with signs and wonders that's why jesus
[1:34:48] said you believe in god believe also in
[1:34:51] me
[1:34:52] jesus says you don't believe you don't
[1:34:53] believe me then believe that works that
[1:34:55] i do right
[1:34:57] for they testify to you
[1:34:59] of who i am
[1:35:02] you don't believe what i say then
[1:35:03] believe the works that i do
[1:35:05] for they testify to you of who i am what
[1:35:07] was the vindication for not so that we
[1:35:10] could all say oh it's vindicated it's
[1:35:11] unquestionable it's scientifically
[1:35:12] proven no it's so that you have
[1:35:14] confidence and faith faith that this
[1:35:16] message was not from a man it was from
[1:35:19] the throne room of god
[1:35:21] amen
[1:35:22] and it was a shady eye it was all elohim
[1:35:25] it was jehovah himself speaking and
[1:35:27] communicating himself to you
[1:35:29] that's why there was a melchizedek sign
[1:35:31] and brother branham would turn his back
[1:35:32] to the audience and begin with his back
[1:35:34] to the audience start to discern hearts
[1:35:36] what was he showing the same way
[1:35:38] melchizedek turned his back and said
[1:35:40] sarah laughed it was a melchizedek sign
[1:35:43] not to lift up a man
[1:35:45] but to raise your faith
[1:35:48] it was sin to raise your faith oh if we
[1:35:52] ever needed anything then our church
[1:35:54] today is that our faith would be raised
[1:35:57] so that we could believe every promise
[1:35:59] in the book is mine amen
[1:36:02] it was the sign through a prophet the
[1:36:05] word was made flesh
[1:36:08] and lived behind skin yeah so we're not
[1:36:11] living in the age of a partial truth
[1:36:14] we're not living in the days of luther
[1:36:16] or wesley where they had a partial
[1:36:18] understanding
[1:36:19] we're living in the understanding of the
[1:36:21] fullness of
[1:36:22] god i'm going to emphasize some of these
[1:36:24] things here today so that you can take
[1:36:26] them home and remember them we are
[1:36:28] living in the age of the fullness
[1:36:32] of everything god was
[1:36:34] the fullness of everything god promised
[1:36:38] is now yours
[1:36:40] and let me just say don't settle for
[1:36:42] less
[1:36:43] don't let anybody sell you anything less
[1:36:46] it is the fullness of god
[1:36:49] amen
[1:36:50] it is the full inheritance not partial
[1:36:53] truth but it was the fullness of what
[1:36:55] was promised to be revealed
[1:36:58] of who god is
[1:36:59] who god was and who he is today amen
[1:37:04] we have the seven sealed mystery of
[1:37:08] christ revealed
[1:37:10] throughout history what was the seven
[1:37:12] church ages brother branham says that
[1:37:14] revelation of the seven church ages was
[1:37:16] upon which every other revelation would
[1:37:18] come amen that the book of revelation
[1:37:21] was the gentile dispensation it was
[1:37:24] history or his
[1:37:27] story
[1:37:29] it was all of time from the beginning in
[1:37:32] the garden the message of the hour
[1:37:35] starts as brother jason of mars preached
[1:37:37] and taught so beautifully today
[1:37:39] it was showing you two seeds that were
[1:37:41] in the very beginning
[1:37:43] the origin of everything and it didn't
[1:37:45] just show you the beginning and it
[1:37:47] didn't just show you the end but it
[1:37:49] showed you everything in between
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:53] and it doesn't just reveal to you who
[1:37:54] christ was or who he's going to be but
[1:37:57] who he is right now
[1:38:00] it was the full
[1:38:01] seven sealed mystery revealed through
[1:38:03] history and let me say this it's only
[1:38:06] the revelation of that is only given to
[1:38:08] the elected seed
[1:38:10] who was predestinated before the world
[1:38:12] began to see it and she sees it not by
[1:38:16] knowledge or intellect but by revelation
[1:38:19] and that can only come when you're born
[1:38:21] of the spirit of god jesus said unless a
[1:38:24] man is born of the spirit of god he can
[1:38:26] never see the kingdom of heaven
[1:38:29] he may understand intellectual and maybe
[1:38:31] understand certain concepts and
[1:38:33] principles in the word but the true
[1:38:35] mystery of the revelation of the kingdom
[1:38:37] of god can only be open to him when he's
[1:38:40] born of the supernatural birth of christ
[1:38:44] that's why we preach you must be born
[1:38:47] again
[1:38:50] can you say amen
[1:38:52] it can only come by a new birth by a
[1:38:54] pentecostal i'm not speaking of azusa
[1:38:57] street i'm speaking of the book of acts
[1:38:59] can only come the same way they were
[1:39:01] born as the same way you've got to be
[1:39:03] born
[1:39:03] we haven't been restored past paul's
[1:39:06] message we've been restored to paul's
[1:39:08] message
[1:39:09] why did brother branham say all the
[1:39:11] voices when he said i would paul be
[1:39:12] judged yes paul will be judged will he
[1:39:15] be accepted he'll be accepted brother of
[1:39:17] adam says well good then i'll be
[1:39:19] accepted because i preached what paul
[1:39:21] preached and the voices of thousands
[1:39:24] that was my voice that was your voice
[1:39:26] try it out we're resting upon that
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:31] amen it was the revelation of the bible
[1:39:33] the open book
[1:39:35] yes
[1:39:36] and let me say this outside of that
[1:39:38] revelation anything else is just an
[1:39:40] intellectual head knowledge that won't
[1:39:43] hold you right
[1:39:46] anything outside of that remember it's
[1:39:48] the order of the anointing
[1:39:50] anything outside of that is an anointing
[1:39:52] on your flesh or an anointing in your
[1:39:55] mind and it'll never hold you didn't
[1:39:57] hold peter right now right
[1:40:00] it's got to be a revelation faith
[1:40:03] is a revelation
[1:40:05] faith oh can you say amen faith is a
[1:40:08] revelation
[1:40:09] listen what brother branham says about
[1:40:11] it here and he says i didn't have time
[1:40:14] to put this but i'm just going to read
[1:40:15] it to you the importance
[1:40:19] of revelation
[1:40:21] by the spirit
[1:40:23] to a true believer can never be over
[1:40:26] emphasized
[1:40:28] revelation means more to you than
[1:40:30] perhaps you realize
[1:40:33] when god reveals himself
[1:40:37] to you amen personally amen
[1:40:45] jesus said the gates of hell can't
[1:40:46] prevail against that
[1:40:50] when god
[1:40:51] reveals himself
[1:40:54] brother adam tells us in the seat is not
[1:40:55] air with the shuck listen to this
[1:40:57] he tells us this and you could you can
[1:40:59] display that slide then the next slide
[1:41:01] there for me brother caleb
[1:41:04] brother madam tells us and the seat is
[1:41:05] not ever there with a shot that this
[1:41:07] happened at the opening now they could
[1:41:09] produce that justification will save a
[1:41:12] man you believe that sure it was a
[1:41:14] carrier of the word just the same as i
[1:41:16] believe the stalk is a part of the wheat
[1:41:18] sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't
[1:41:21] the life then along came sanctification
[1:41:23] how many believes in sanctification you
[1:41:25] believe the bible you have to sure so
[1:41:28] still that's not it's a little more like
[1:41:31] that's two more words
[1:41:34] so everything the church had everything
[1:41:36] denominations had everything all the
[1:41:38] reformers had everything luther had
[1:41:40] everything all the man and the men the
[1:41:42] men under the man anointing under the
[1:41:44] intellectual age when there was an
[1:41:45] intellectual anointing that came upon
[1:41:47] the mind of man all of that was a step
[1:41:49] but then come to penick but he says but
[1:41:51] then come the pentecost the restoration
[1:41:54] of the gifts speak it in tongues they
[1:41:55] call it the initial evidence of the holy
[1:41:57] ghost speaking in tongues they call that
[1:41:59] the initial evidence which brought forth
[1:42:00] the what the shock
[1:42:02] but they denominated but when you come
[1:42:04] to say
[1:42:05] i and my father are one
[1:42:08] amen
[1:42:10] when brother burnham came to the third
[1:42:11] pool of his ministry and it was no more
[1:42:13] signs of healing it was no more sign in
[1:42:15] the hand it was no more just prophecy
[1:42:17] and a prophet prophesying but he said
[1:42:19] the crowning capstone the third pull of
[1:42:21] my ministry was not another healing
[1:42:23] revival it wasn't notice it wasn't
[1:42:25] another intellectual revival it wasn't
[1:42:27] another emotional revival
[1:42:30] but he said when i stood in sabino
[1:42:31] canyon and the sword struck my hand and
[1:42:34] the voice said this is not a king this
[1:42:36] is the king's sword
[1:42:38] it's the word of the lord
[1:42:40] amen it's the revelation of the word
[1:42:43] it's the crowning of your ministry
[1:42:47] people didn't want that ah we go back to
[1:42:49] the healing go back to why because
[1:42:51] people want to dwell in either the
[1:42:52] intellectual realm or they want to dwell
[1:42:54] in the emotional realm go back to a
[1:42:56] healing revival brother branham have
[1:42:58] another tent brother adam says what was
[1:43:00] it they're rejecting they've wrecked
[1:43:02] they failed to recognize the awakening
[1:43:05] of the bride
[1:43:08] and he says when you come to say i and
[1:43:09] my father are one of these other things
[1:43:11] then the shuck pulls away but the real
[1:43:13] genuine bride church will bring forth
[1:43:15] the entire word of god
[1:43:18] in its fullness
[1:43:21] and in its strength for he's the same
[1:43:23] yesterday today
[1:43:25] and forever so brother branham's
[1:43:27] ministry what was it
[1:43:30] he tells us in the seat is not air with
[1:43:32] the shock this happens
[1:43:34] at the opening of the seven seals
[1:43:36] revelations 10 is that the full word is
[1:43:40] to be born in manifestation vindicated
[1:43:44] by the spirit of god in the full
[1:43:46] strength as christ did when he was here
[1:43:49] on earth
[1:43:50] so brother branham's ministry was the
[1:43:52] revealing of that son of man this is
[1:43:55] what the open bible brings you
[1:43:58] this is what the opening of the word is
[1:44:01] to bring we've moved from partial to
[1:44:05] full reality
[1:44:07] he says now they still won't believe it
[1:44:08] go to the next slide i think that's what
[1:44:10] i've got the next slide for the kingdom
[1:44:13] witnesses yes let me let me stop at this
[1:44:14] i forgot to have this in here
[1:44:16] as we said
[1:44:18] ask mike tysons
[1:44:21] victims
[1:44:25] what they thought about iron mike
[1:44:28] let's hear some what some of the
[1:44:30] witnesses say gordon lindsay never had
[1:44:32] we known of any preacher calling deaf
[1:44:34] mutes and blind people to prayer for and
[1:44:37] then to see those people delivered on
[1:44:39] the spot
[1:44:40] a ministry that was beyond any that we
[1:44:43] had before
[1:44:44] witnessed amen go to the next one
[1:44:48] he says it was branham this is the book
[1:44:50] the preachers and i had the names of let
[1:44:52] me just pull them up so that we have
[1:44:54] them here
[1:44:55] i thought that i put them in there but i
[1:44:57] didn't
[1:44:58] this is oh it is in the pictures good
[1:45:00] this is james morris author of this book
[1:45:02] it was branham more than any other
[1:45:04] evangelist who started the post-world
[1:45:06] war ii fundamentalist healing revival
[1:45:08] following his encounter with an angel on
[1:45:09] may 7 1946 word radiated listen word
[1:45:14] radiated in every direction that all
[1:45:16] manner of diseases and afflictions were
[1:45:18] healed instantly by the little indiana
[1:45:21] preacher
[1:45:22] even cases of raising the dead
[1:45:26] were published amen
[1:45:28] gordon this is t.l osborne
[1:45:30] god has chosen diverse and mysterious
[1:45:34] ways to reveal himself to his servants
[1:45:36] especially those called for the
[1:45:37] dispensational purposes as was brother
[1:45:39] branham's call in short the man we know
[1:45:42] is william branham was sent to
[1:45:44] demonstrate god again
[1:45:46] in flesh

[1:45:50] any other man who you have multitudes of
[1:45:53] his peers multitude of his
[1:45:55] contemporaries saying this about his
[1:45:57] ministry
[1:45:59] you won't find it
[1:46:00] go to the next one brother caleb christ
[1:46:02] the hiller f bosworth when the gift is
[1:46:04] operating brother branham is the most
[1:46:06] sensitive person to the presence and
[1:46:08] working of the holy spirit and the
[1:46:09] spiritual realities of any person i've
[1:46:11] ever known
[1:46:12] next

[1:46:16] didn't have the man's name here
[1:46:19] uh uh yeah this is george acharoth
[1:46:23] god called this humble man and anointed
[1:46:25] his ministry to a degree that within a
[1:46:27] few short years his name was known in
[1:46:30] the most remote jungle outstation
[1:46:33] wherever you would go in this world you
[1:46:35] would find that the name of this
[1:46:37] messenger has preceded you wow
[1:46:40] amen even the jungles of africa voice of
[1:46:43] healing in bible days there were men of
[1:46:46] god who were prophets and seers but in
[1:46:48] all those secret records none of these
[1:46:50] had a greater ministry than that of
[1:46:51] william bran i'm a prophet and seer of
[1:46:54] god whose photograph appears on the
[1:46:56] front cover of this issue a full gospel
[1:46:58] of full gospel men's voice branham has
[1:47:01] been used by god in the name of jesus to
[1:47:04] raise the dead amen
[1:47:08] have you ever had any go back have you
[1:47:10] ever heard any other healing revivalist
[1:47:12] have you ever got any other facebook
[1:47:13] sponsored message for an event of a
[1:47:15] preacher come into your local city to
[1:47:17] raise the dead
[1:47:22] now we laugh and that's okay
[1:47:24] have we
[1:47:25] have we had any other ministry come to
[1:47:28] our men are saying that william
[1:47:29] branham's ministry was to reveal jesus
[1:47:32] christ in flesh
[1:47:34] again
[1:47:39] what was it
[1:47:41] we've moved from this partial to a full
[1:47:44] reality notice the next slide brother
[1:47:45] caleb
[1:47:46] now still they won't believe it jesus
[1:47:48] promised that as it was in the days of
[1:47:50] noah it was in the days of lot
[1:47:53] it would be in the last day
[1:47:55] we've
[1:47:56] got it
[1:47:58] we've got it jesus promised as it was in
[1:48:00] the days of lot as it was in the days of
[1:48:02] noah brother branham says we've got it
[1:48:04] it's here
[1:48:06] it's already vindicated just how many
[1:48:08] scriptures in sodom age what happened to
[1:48:10] abraham would return back again
[1:48:12] abraham's royal seed which is in christ
[1:48:14] christ returning
[1:48:16] in the form of the word
[1:48:18] working in human beings
[1:48:22] aha
[1:48:23] so it was more than just a glam show it
[1:48:26] was more than just glamour it was more
[1:48:28] than just oh
[1:48:29] oh it was greater than barnum and
[1:48:31] bailey's circus it was more than any
[1:48:33] kind of special event that you could go
[1:48:35] to it was christ
[1:48:38] returning
[1:48:40] in the form of his word
[1:48:42] do we realize what god sent when he sent
[1:48:44] the message of the hour it wasn't just
[1:48:46] another show it wasn't just another
[1:48:48] healer it wasn't just another revival it
[1:48:50] was christ returning
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:54] he said brother jesus is returning he is
[1:48:57] in his corporate body he's coming but
[1:48:59] remember his coming
[1:49:01] happens in three phases
[1:49:05] it was christ returning in the form of
[1:49:07] his word working in human beings showing
[1:49:09] the signs that he promised he would say
[1:49:11] he would sign it would do he says he
[1:49:13] promised that he would do it god
[1:49:15] promised and god keeps his promise so
[1:49:18] his return the return of christ what are
[1:49:21] we waiting on i'm just waiting on the
[1:49:22] return of the lord i'm just waiting on
[1:49:24] the return and i'm here waiting with you
[1:49:26] we're waiting for the corporal brother
[1:49:28] adam says you he says i believe in a
[1:49:30] corporal physical resurrection and i
[1:49:32] believe in a corporal return of the lord
[1:49:34] jesus
[1:49:35] that's what believers believe
[1:49:38] i believe that go back that's what
[1:49:40] believers believe and i believe that but
[1:49:42] notice
[1:49:43] his coming
[1:49:45] his returning
[1:49:47] the second coming of christ
[1:49:49] was going to happen in three phases not
[1:49:51] just one event
[1:49:53] right but it would be one event that
[1:49:55] happens in three phases notice
[1:49:57] revelations 10 and i saw another mighty
[1:49:59] angel
[1:50:00] come
[1:50:02] down
[1:50:04] you follow that
[1:50:05] i saw another mighty angel
[1:50:08] come
[1:50:09] down
[1:50:10] so if you're coming down from heaven it
[1:50:12] must mean you're coming to earth
[1:50:16] i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:50:18] from heaven clothed with the cloud of
[1:50:19] the rainbow was upon his head his face
[1:50:21] was aware of the sun see his pillars of
[1:50:23] fire he added his hand a little book
[1:50:24] open and set his right feet foot upon
[1:50:26] the sea and his left foot upon the earth
[1:50:27] cried with a loud voice
[1:50:29] notice this first thessalonians 4 the
[1:50:31] next slide
[1:50:32] for the lord himself
[1:50:37] shall
[1:50:38] come down yes
[1:50:40] for the lord himself shall
[1:50:42] descend
[1:50:44] from
[1:50:45] heaven
[1:50:47] first thessalonians 4 revelations 10 i
[1:50:49] saw another mighty angel come down
[1:50:53] first thessalonians 4 he says
[1:50:55] for the lord himself next slide to the
[1:50:58] caleb shall descend from heaven with a
[1:51:00] shout with the voice of the archangel
[1:51:03] and with the trump there's your three
[1:51:05] phases he first descends with a shout
[1:51:07] what was a shout a message
[1:51:10] then a voice a people becoming the
[1:51:13] message
[1:51:15] and the archangel and with the trump of
[1:51:17] god
[1:51:18] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:51:21] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:51:23] be caught up together with them in the
[1:51:24] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:51:26] so shall we ever be with the lord go to
[1:51:30] the next slide so what was this
[1:51:32] he said oh brother matt that's just a
[1:51:34] picture that's just a photo that's just
[1:51:36] something that time magazine took this
[1:51:38] was the coming this was the returning
[1:51:41] this was the headship to the body
[1:51:45] it was more than just a supernatural
[1:51:47] cloud it was more than just another sign
[1:51:49] in the heaven it was the sign in the
[1:51:51] heaven that was representing something
[1:51:54] had happened
[1:51:56] something different than what luther had
[1:51:58] something different than what john
[1:52:00] wesley had something different than what
[1:52:02] pentecost had
[1:52:04] now the head the headship is returning
[1:52:06] it was the constellation of seven angels
[1:52:10] brother man says what was it
[1:52:12] he says it was a message it was a it was
[1:52:14] it was the word of the lord brother and
[1:52:17] says where i received my commission to
[1:52:18] go back to jeffersonville and preach the
[1:52:20] seventh opening of the seven seas
[1:52:24] so the mighty angel descends as we read
[1:52:26] in revelations 10 with an open book he
[1:52:30] descends with an open book the seals are
[1:52:32] now opened
[1:52:34] and the seven thunders utter their
[1:52:35] voices what does that do brother matt
[1:52:38] those seven thunders communicate the
[1:52:40] mysteries right yeah of the book
[1:52:44] to the people who can receive them
[1:52:47] and not everybody can receive them a lot
[1:52:49] of people can understand them but not
[1:52:51] everybody can receive them so what was
[1:52:53] that to do it was to communicate the
[1:52:54] mysteries to you are you glad to this
[1:52:59] morning
[1:53:01] it was to communicate the mysteries by
[1:53:03] the seventh church age messenger which
[1:53:06] was one of the stars in the seven stars
[1:53:08] in the hand of god he was one of the
[1:53:10] seven eyes that went to and fro
[1:53:14] i know this is all elementary but i just
[1:53:15] felt led the
[1:53:17] the holy spirit stopped me last night
[1:53:19] was going to go a totally different
[1:53:20] direction and god constrained me and
[1:53:22] said right now this you this is what
[1:53:24] you're going to minister and i'm going
[1:53:25] to i'm going to say this i want the
[1:53:26] young people everybody to be listening
[1:53:28] but more than ever before i want the
[1:53:30] youth to be listening to what i'm
[1:53:31] preaching here today because let me just
[1:53:33] say this this isn't mom and dad's book
[1:53:35] this is your book
[1:53:37] this isn't mom and dad's message this is
[1:53:39] your message
[1:53:40] oh can i get an amen from the parents
[1:53:42] it's got to move beyond their message
[1:53:44] it's got to become your message
[1:53:46] it's got to become your book that you
[1:53:48] take
[1:53:50] and you consume and you eat
[1:53:55] it communicates the mysteries
[1:53:58] by the seventh church age messenger
[1:54:00] brother branham
[1:54:01] that the seven seals were opened not by
[1:54:04] a prophet
[1:54:06] the seven seals were opened by christ
[1:54:09] amen it was christ returning
[1:54:13] and brother adam wasn't jesus christ
[1:54:16] amen some people make him jesus christ
[1:54:18] he wasn't jesus christ some people make
[1:54:20] him just anybody he was just a reformer
[1:54:22] he wasn't a reformer some people make
[1:54:24] him just a prophet he was more than a
[1:54:25] prophet he was a church-age messenger
[1:54:27] [Applause]
[1:54:29] you see how important it is to stay in
[1:54:30] the middle of the road and don't go to
[1:54:32] either ditch
[1:54:34] but withdrawal from the ditches some
[1:54:36] people say only play tapes
[1:54:39] other people say don't play any tapes i
[1:54:41] play tapes almost every single day
[1:54:45] we need the tapes
[1:54:46] we need preachers we need teachers we
[1:54:50] need understanding we need emotion
[1:54:53] we need feeling we need revival we need
[1:54:55] everything the lord wanted to give us
[1:54:58] when he gave us the opening of the word
[1:55:00] it was the opening of the full
[1:55:02] understanding the fullness of christ
[1:55:07] he says the seven thunders let me move
[1:55:09] through this he says the seven thunders
[1:55:11] so what was this this was the beginning
[1:55:14] of the return
[1:55:16] the shout was the beginning of the
[1:55:18] rapture
[1:55:21] the rapture that everybody's waiting for
[1:55:23] has already started
[1:55:26] amen
[1:55:28] it was the beginning of the rapture
[1:55:30] and there's people who are literally not
[1:55:32] figuratively they are literally caught
[1:55:35] in the cyclone
[1:55:37] they're called in the vortex
[1:55:39] and while others can't feel it they can
[1:55:41] feel it
[1:55:44] and while others can't see it they can
[1:55:46] see it
[1:55:47] while others have no sense of it just
[1:55:48] another preacher yelling and screaming
[1:55:50] and spitting other people
[1:55:52] enter into the revival
[1:55:56] this was the beginning he does three
[1:55:58] things when he descends young people
[1:56:00] so there isn't just one event of the
[1:56:03] return of the lord but there are three
[1:56:05] phases there's a shout a voice and a
[1:56:07] trump and that last trumpet brings the
[1:56:09] dead dead saints so the other two phases
[1:56:13] must happen
[1:56:15] before the resurrection of the dead
[1:56:18] right
[1:56:19] before he could return so brother then
[1:56:21] why did god send us a vindicated message
[1:56:23] why was it so thoroughly vindicated you
[1:56:26] know what god was going to do he was
[1:56:27] going to remove
[1:56:30] every doubt
[1:56:32] of who he was
[1:56:34] he was going to so thoroughly and
[1:56:36] emphatically
[1:56:38] vindicate his messenger
[1:56:41] so that you knew
[1:56:42] this message was not from brother
[1:56:44] branham it was from god
[1:56:47] amen
[1:56:50] he was going to remove all doubts
[1:56:53] he was going to remove all questions was
[1:56:56] he three
[1:56:57] is he two
[1:56:58] is he one
[1:57:01] was it an apple
[1:57:05] was the white horse right or christ who
[1:57:07] is it you see men probe at that book of
[1:57:09] revelation they have no understanding
[1:57:11] they guess at it they probe at it
[1:57:14] they guess at it they probe at it but
[1:57:16] god was going to release the full
[1:57:19] revelation
[1:57:20] of the mystery to his people
[1:57:23] he was going to fully and thoroughly
[1:57:25] vindicate it to remove before god can
[1:57:28] judge the world brother branham says
[1:57:30] this in the message the trial he says
[1:57:32] before god can ever judge the world of
[1:57:34] sin he first must vindicate he first
[1:57:37] must send a messenger to show who truth
[1:57:40] a message of what truth is to be judged
[1:57:43] by
[1:57:44] amen
[1:57:46] right
[1:57:47] so before he could judge the world he
[1:57:49] first had to thoroughly show himself
[1:57:51] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:57:55] forever
[1:57:56] culture changes education changes
[1:57:58] america changes they change every four
[1:58:01] or eight years
[1:58:02] but god never changes
[1:58:05] his word's still applicable his word
[1:58:06] still applies his word doesn't degrade
[1:58:09] we don't water it down because the
[1:58:11] culture changes
[1:58:12] it's still the same voice
[1:58:17] so he thoroughly vindicated himself
[1:58:20] thoroughly revealed himself to remove
[1:58:22] all doubt
[1:58:24] it wasn't to lift up a man it was to
[1:58:26] lift up christ in that man so that you
[1:58:28] would accept the message that that man
[1:58:30] brought that it wasn't the man's message
[1:58:33] it was christ
[1:58:34] it was the mighty angel descending
[1:58:37] it was to remove all doubts you know
[1:58:39] what the cloud brought the cloud
[1:58:42] was to remove all clouds
[1:58:44] came up with that myself thought it was
[1:58:45] good
[1:58:48] cloud i had that in my notes
[1:58:50] did a little shouting jubilee in the
[1:58:52] back
[1:58:54] the cloud was to remove all clouds
[1:58:56] all clouds of dow all clouds of question
[1:58:58] all clouds of obscurity is he two is he
[1:59:00] three is he this is he that this church
[1:59:02] says this this church says that this
[1:59:04] church this preacher said this then he
[1:59:05] changed his view then ten years later he
[1:59:07] reformed he moved from charismatic and
[1:59:09] nazi evangelical now he moves from
[1:59:11] evangelical now he's a hillsong pastor
[1:59:13] now he pastors and now he's the now he
[1:59:14] moved from that to the music ministry
[1:59:16] and he's well known and he writes i
[1:59:17] think 38 songs then two years later he
[1:59:20] denounces everything he's ever believed
[1:59:22] and says he's not a christian anymore
[1:59:24] makes a facebook post balling his eyes
[1:59:26] out saying how good it feels to say i'm
[1:59:27] not a christian
[1:59:30] aren't you so glad your faith does not
[1:59:32] build on any man or any emotion or any
[1:59:35] experience and not any on any person
[1:59:38] it's based on christ who has revealed
[1:59:40] himself to you
[1:59:42] and the gates of hell can't shake that
[1:59:45] money can't buy that popularity can't
[1:59:48] give you that
[1:59:50] but god in his grace and mercy revealed
[1:59:52] it to you
[1:59:55] it was fully unveiled it was to remove
[1:59:58] all obscurity of who jesus was
[2:00:01] so that there was no excuse
[2:00:05] he was
[2:00:06] fully unveiled
[2:00:08] all misconceptions of who jesus is was
[2:00:11] removed all misunderstandings were
[2:00:13] removed it unlocked the mysteries of the
[2:00:17] bible and it became an open book
[2:00:21] but notice this before his physical
[2:00:23] corporal
[2:00:24] coming he descends with an open book the
[2:00:28] word was revealed and given to john a
[2:00:30] type of the bride and then john eats the
[2:00:33] word and he becomes the word as god said
[2:00:36] to moses i'm come down
[2:00:39] notice i god said to moses the children
[2:00:42] of israel i've come down
[2:00:45] to deliver my people but who did his
[2:00:47] people see
[2:00:49] moses right
[2:00:51] hello
[2:00:54] but who was it it was god
[2:00:56] delivering his people
[2:00:57] people seen a prophet of kentucky
[2:00:59] hillbilly but it was jesus who i see
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:04] it was christ
[2:01:05] it was christ veiled behind skin
[2:01:10] it's a razor's edge
[2:01:12] there's a ditch on the left there's a
[2:01:13] ditch on the right but the bride stays
[2:01:15] right in the amen
[2:01:18] the prophet came down in the same way
[2:01:20] god sent us to moses but it was the lord
[2:01:22] who descended it was him the lord
[2:01:24] himself
[2:01:26] shall descend i'm not going to give it
[2:01:27] to a reformer i'm not going to give it
[2:01:29] to just the gift of a prophet or a good
[2:01:31] preacher but i'm coming to do this
[2:01:32] myself
[2:01:34] i'm coming down for deliverance that's
[2:01:37] what the message of the hour is others
[2:01:39] see it as bondage and they leave it i
[2:01:41] see it as my freedom i see it as my
[2:01:44] ticket to get out of bondage i see it as
[2:01:47] my deliverance
[2:01:50] so the promise of restoration it was it
[2:01:53] was all that joel prophesied what was
[2:01:55] this this was all daniel prophesied when
[2:01:56] daniel said seal it up daniel don't even
[2:01:59] don't even write it it was the full
[2:02:01] revelation of the mystery it was the
[2:02:04] prophecy of joel it wasn't just a
[2:02:06] restoration of intellect wasn't just a
[2:02:08] restoration it was a pouring out of his
[2:02:11] spirit
[2:02:13] so that so the opening of the word
[2:02:15] didn't bring a
[2:02:16] theology amen i just understand the
[2:02:19] bible better i know that it was adultery
[2:02:21] and not an apple in the beginning listen
[2:02:23] friends those are all good but you can
[2:02:25] have the knowledge of the revelation and
[2:02:27] miss the revelation entirely
[2:02:31] i understand this no it was the opening
[2:02:33] of the word didn't bring a theology
[2:02:35] but as you said then brother matthew
[2:02:37] what was his purpose its purpose was to
[2:02:40] bring a power
[2:02:42] to unleash and unlock a power to break
[2:02:45] any grip of the enemy that he has in
[2:02:48] your life
[2:02:49] to destroy any stronghold that satan has
[2:02:51] built in your mind
[2:02:53] that's what the word was to bring to his
[2:02:54] people a power of the strength not just
[2:02:58] some of the strength but the full
[2:03:00] strength of christ would come without
[2:03:02] measure again to a people
[2:03:05] to who brother the mat to believers
[2:03:08] it brings the power to destroy and to
[2:03:11] expose the enemy and his threats that's
[2:03:13] what revelation brings a power to cast
[2:03:16] out demons a power to heal the sick both
[2:03:18] your mind your body and your spirit a
[2:03:21] power to raise the dead the opening of
[2:03:25] the word you say brother matthew what
[2:03:27] does the message bring what does the
[2:03:28] open word bring it brings life
[2:03:32] life amen if i could oversimplify what
[2:03:35] it brings i just simplify it right there
[2:03:38] the opening of the message of the hour
[2:03:41] the opening of the word the unveiling of
[2:03:43] christ didn't bring head knowledge it
[2:03:46] didn't bring ins it didn't bring
[2:03:47] intellect it didn't bring emotion it
[2:03:49] brought life
[2:03:52] and you can feed upon it
[2:03:57] the world is feeding on the world and
[2:03:58] they're dying
[2:04:00] but you can feed upon christ
[2:04:04] i'm so glad
[2:04:06] that i fed upon him
[2:04:09] and i can live
[2:04:11] i can have life you say brother matt
[2:04:12] does that mean you don't have trouble no
[2:04:14] does that mean you don't have trial no
[2:04:15] jesus said in this world you'll have
[2:04:17] tribulation
[2:04:18] but i've got life
[2:04:20] i've got something the world can't give
[2:04:23] the world can't take it away
[2:04:25] i've got something so precious to me
[2:04:29] oh you ought to say thank you lord
[2:04:31] brother branham says this notice and he
[2:04:33] cried verse four when the seven thunders
[2:04:35] had uttered their voices i was about to
[2:04:38] write notice verse three
[2:04:39] he says and he cried with a loud voice
[2:04:42] as when a lion roareth
[2:04:45] so what was the voice we had the voice
[2:04:48] of theologians
[2:04:50] they were good
[2:04:51] they probed at it they got a lot right
[2:04:53] i'm thankful for the shock i don't i
[2:04:55] don't push it away i'm thankful for the
[2:04:57] tassel it brought me to where i'm at
[2:04:59] today i'm thankful for the minds of men
[2:05:01] i'm thankful i draw upon them i'm
[2:05:03] thankful for historians who can read
[2:05:05] about bible history
[2:05:07] but listen friends when god sent the
[2:05:09] message it wasn't the voice of a
[2:05:10] theologian
[2:05:12] it wasn't the voice of intellect it
[2:05:13] wasn't the voice of human reason it
[2:05:15] wasn't the voice of a reformer right
[2:05:18] god sent a loud voice
[2:05:20] as one a lion
[2:05:22] you know what a lion does when a lion
[2:05:24] roars every other voice
[2:05:29] every other voice is silent
[2:05:33] and when god sent
[2:05:34] the message of the hour
[2:05:37] he sent it with a loud voice
[2:05:39] not to be questioned not to be doubted
[2:05:42] not to be pro not to be debated my
[2:05:44] goodness
[2:05:45] not to be opinionated
[2:05:48] to be believed
[2:05:50] to be consumed
[2:05:53] it's what's going to change your body
[2:05:57] an emotional experience is not going to
[2:05:59] change you an intellectual experience is
[2:06:01] not going to change you the word
[2:06:03] is going to change
[2:06:05] he cried with a loud voice
[2:06:08] that voice cut through every idea of who
[2:06:11] christ was it cut through every idea of
[2:06:13] theologians it wasn't the opinion of a
[2:06:15] man anymore it wasn't even the opinion
[2:06:18] of brother branham but it was the mighty
[2:06:20] angel speaking with a loud voice how
[2:06:23] many witty roar the bible says seven
[2:06:25] thunders utter their voices
[2:06:28] say brother matt what does that mean
[2:06:29] that's why the message of the hour is
[2:06:31] the voice of god
[2:06:34] you may hear a tape and you may turn on
[2:06:36] a tape and you may only hear the voice
[2:06:37] of brother branham and that's fine
[2:06:39] that's fine i love his voice
[2:06:42] but the message of the hour is more than
[2:06:43] a voice of brother branham
[2:06:45] it's more than the voice of it's more
[2:06:47] than hunting stories more than fission
[2:06:49] stories
[2:06:51] but when you hear
[2:06:52] you're hearing the voice of god
[2:06:54] communicated to you amen
[2:06:57] not the church
[2:06:58] it's good that he comes and speaks to
[2:07:00] the church
[2:07:02] but he's got to speak to you yes amen
[2:07:05] listen to me young person he's got to
[2:07:07] speak to you
[2:07:09] amen you may hear his voice as he speaks
[2:07:11] in the pulpit you may hear his voices he
[2:07:13] speaks to your dad or your mom he's got
[2:07:15] to speak to you
[2:07:17] you've got to hear his voice
[2:07:19] amen you've got to obey that voice
[2:07:22] you've got to hear that voice in order
[2:07:23] to obey it it was the voice as a lion
[2:07:27] roareth
[2:07:28] this is what daniel couldn't understand
[2:07:30] go to the next line if you could but
[2:07:31] thou will daniel shut up the words and
[2:07:34] seal the book
[2:07:35] even to the time of the end many shall
[2:07:37] run to and fro and knowledge shall be
[2:07:40] increased
[2:07:41] verse 8 and i heard but i understood not
[2:07:45] then said i my lord what shall be the
[2:07:48] end of these things go to the next slide
[2:07:51] and he said this is to daniel go thy way
[2:07:54] daniel
[2:07:55] for the words are
[2:07:57] closed
[2:07:59] closed and when they were closed men
[2:08:02] probed ah
[2:08:04] you know i think it might be this no i
[2:08:06] think it's over here the word was closed
[2:08:09] and sealed up till the time of the end
[2:08:12] many shall be purified and made white
[2:08:14] and tried but the wicked shall do
[2:08:15] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[2:08:17] understand but i'm thankful but the wise
[2:08:21] but the wise
[2:08:23] shall understand
[2:08:25] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:08:27] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[2:08:30] mystery of god
[2:08:32] should be finished
[2:08:34] so that book that was sealed is now
[2:08:37] open
[2:08:38] yeah amen
[2:08:40] it's now opened
[2:08:43] oh
[2:08:44] i'm thankful
[2:08:46] it's opened
[2:08:47] i'm thankful it's an open word
[2:08:50] i'm thankful god opened it not to
[2:08:53] enlighten me
[2:08:55] not to enlighten me i'm so glad for the
[2:08:57] enlightenment but it was to change me
[2:09:01] it was to take a heart that couldn't be
[2:09:03] turned
[2:09:04] and turned that heart
[2:09:06] back to faith
[2:09:08] back to a supernatural faith
[2:09:11] back to a supernatural understanding
[2:09:14] back to an apostolic church
[2:09:18] are we an apostolic church
[2:09:20] brother matt what does it mean to be an
[2:09:21] apostolic to be a church of the apostles
[2:09:26] to be a church like the apostles in the
[2:09:28] first church
[2:09:29] are we apostolic you say for brother man
[2:09:31] i believe i want to believe i want to
[2:09:33] have apostolic belief
[2:09:35] how many can say i want to believe like
[2:09:36] the apostles believed i want to live
[2:09:39] like the apostles live give us a church
[2:09:41] that is like the first church
[2:09:43] give us a power that the first church
[2:09:45] had give us a faith that the first
[2:09:47] church had unveiled when god was
[2:09:50] unveiled he poured out himself and all
[2:09:52] of himself is available
[2:09:55] and i said lord i want to take advantage
[2:09:57] of it today
[2:09:58] because you're standing your feet with
[2:10:00] me
[2:10:01] we have so much more we just won't get
[2:10:03] to
[2:10:10] matthew 11 but what weren't you out to
[2:10:13] see
[2:10:14] a prophet
[2:10:16] that's verse 9 matthew 11.
[2:10:19] speaking of john
[2:10:21] what went you out to see a prophet
[2:10:25] yey
[2:10:26] i say unto you matthew 11 brother caleb
[2:10:28] verse 9
[2:10:31] i say unto you
[2:10:33] and more
[2:10:35] than a prophet
[2:10:37] for this is he
[2:10:39] of whom
[2:10:41] it is written
[2:10:42] why was he more than a prophet we had
[2:10:45] prophets
[2:10:46] we had micah we had nahum we had malachi
[2:10:49] we had jeremiah we had isaiah prophets
[2:10:52] but now john was going to come and
[2:10:53] brother branham says john was the breach
[2:10:56] between law and grace
[2:10:58] he was a change of dispensation
[2:11:01] john was more than a prophet jesus says
[2:11:04] verse 9
[2:11:05] this is verse 10 for this is he
[2:11:08] of whom it is written
[2:11:10] behold i send my messenger before thy
[2:11:13] face
[2:11:14] which shall prepare the way before thee
[2:11:17] say brother matt why was he greater than
[2:11:18] a prophet because the word had been
[2:11:21] written specific special word had been
[2:11:24] written about this man and now john had
[2:11:27] became the word
[2:11:29] that was written about him
[2:11:31] you say brother branham was a prophet he
[2:11:33] was a prophet i say unto you he was more
[2:11:35] than a prophet
[2:11:36] for this is him of who malachi chapter 4
[2:11:39] speaks about
[2:11:41] of who luke of who revelations 10 verse
[2:11:43] 7. this is he jesus says among them that
[2:11:46] are born of women there have not risen
[2:11:48] or greater than john the baptist not
[2:11:50] withstanding that he is least in the
[2:11:51] kingdom of heaven he that is least is
[2:11:54] greater than he
[2:11:56] and from the days
[2:11:58] what was it
[2:12:00] he was more than a prophet
[2:12:03] he was the word
[2:12:04] made light that's what brother branham
[2:12:06] calls him
[2:12:07] and from the days of john the baptist
[2:12:09] until now the kingdom of heaven
[2:12:11] suffereth violence and the violent take
[2:12:12] it by force
[2:12:13] for all the prophets
[2:12:16] and the law prophesied until john
[2:12:21] it was a marker jesus i hope you catch
[2:12:24] it it was a marker jesus was placing and
[2:12:27] he was saying you've waited on this day
[2:12:30] and john is the marker until this day
[2:12:33] the prophets have prophesied the law has
[2:12:35] spoken until john but now something's
[2:12:38] going to happen because what john was
[2:12:40] introducing the lamb
[2:12:44] he was introducing the son of god and
[2:12:47] now the dispensation of law
[2:12:49] would be turned to a dispensation of
[2:12:51] grace
[2:12:52] [Music]
[2:12:58] for this is he
[2:13:00] notice this for all the prophets
[2:13:01] prophesied verse 14 and if you will
[2:13:04] receive it
[2:13:05] this is
[2:13:07] elijah
[2:13:08] this is elias
[2:13:10] which was for to come
[2:13:13] he that hath ears
[2:13:15] to hear
[2:13:17] let him hear
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:20] notice jesus said it's only to those
[2:13:23] who have
[2:13:24] ears
[2:13:25] to hear
[2:13:27] this is he what was the ministry of
[2:13:29] malachi 4. it was more than emotion it
[2:13:31] was more than intellect it was more than
[2:13:33] theology it was more than doctrine
[2:13:35] come on friends
[2:13:36] it was more than just an understanding
[2:13:38] it was a marker when malachi 4 came
[2:13:41] it was going to set forth what was that
[2:13:43] cloud over flagstaff it was a marker
[2:13:46] if you'll receive it this is he of whom
[2:13:49] it was spoken
[2:13:50] this is elijah
[2:13:52] if you'll receive it this is the message
[2:13:54] of the hour it's the beginning of the
[2:13:56] rapture it's the beginning of a cycle
[2:14:00] and there are people who are literally
[2:14:02] being transformed being transfigured
[2:14:05] being going to be translated one day
[2:14:09] because why they feed upon not theology
[2:14:11] they don't feed upon the words of men
[2:14:13] listen this isn't a revival i love
[2:14:15] preachers
[2:14:16] but god didn't send us a revival of just
[2:14:19] good preachers
[2:14:20] i love good teachers but god didn't send
[2:14:22] us a good revival of just good teachers
[2:14:24] and theology this wasn't even the
[2:14:26] revival of a ministry or the gift of a
[2:14:28] prophet
[2:14:29] this was a revival of the word and the
[2:14:32] bride feeds on the word
[2:14:35] it's her revival
[2:14:37] and it's more than just a revival say
[2:14:39] brother matt are you glad you're part of
[2:14:41] revival i am but i'm so much more glad i
[2:14:44] met the reviver
[2:14:47] didn't just receive the revival i was
[2:14:49] introduced to the reviver
[2:14:52] and he revived my
[2:14:54] heart
[2:14:55] and there's a people who under their
[2:14:57] message under their messenger
[2:14:59] become the final voice
[2:15:01] to the final age
[2:15:03] they're literally called up in the
[2:15:05] rapture being transformed
[2:15:08] into the message
[2:15:10] of the hour
[2:15:13] which was a revel you say brother matt
[2:15:15] what is that we just preached for an
[2:15:16] hour and a half on what it was
[2:15:18] and i didn't even scratch the
[2:15:20] surface we preached on an hour and a
[2:15:23] half of what the message of the hour was

[2:15:29] fullness of everything christ was

[2:15:34] is going to be it's the full
[2:15:36] unleashing or unlocking of all of the

[2:15:42] intended for you to have and it's for
[2:15:44] you it's for your family it's for your
[2:15:46] children it's for them that are far off
