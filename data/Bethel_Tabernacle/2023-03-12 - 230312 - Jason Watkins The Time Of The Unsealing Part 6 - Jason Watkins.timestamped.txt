[0:03] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of worship
[0:05] this morning.
[0:08] Hallelujah.
[0:10] [Applause]
[0:12] God bless you. We greet you in the name
[0:13] of the Lord Jesus. We're very happy to
[0:16] be here today. Amen. Got a number of
[0:19] families out ministry away ministering.
[0:22] Uh a good bit of sickness going around.
[0:24] So, we're happy to have you all here.
[0:25] Happy to have Brother Josh, Sister Patty
[0:27] here with us. Amen. And I I heard
[0:30] somebody get up and they said it was
[0:32] going to be Brother Josh. And I knew I
[0:34] had seen Josh in the parking lot. And
[0:36] then I heard him say, "Haven't seen
[0:37] y'all in a long time." I'm like, "Wait,
[0:40] you were just" And then when when
[0:42] brother Josh started singing, I said,
[0:43] "Okay, that's not this Josh. That's
[0:45] that's this Josh." And then I
[0:47] remembered. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[0:49] So, uh you out singing, brother, but he
[0:52] blows a mean saxophone. I'm telling you.
[0:55] Amen. Amen. Happy to have these sisters
[0:58] here with us. You are from Brother
[0:59] Junior Stanley's family, aren't you? Our
[1:01] Junior Ward.

[1:04] Look who I'm staring at. My goodness.
[1:07] Okay. Praise the Lord. Happy to have
[1:09] y'all here with us today, Sister Peggy.
[1:11] Amen. Who's young lady stand beside you?
[1:13] My daughter, Amanda.
[1:14] Amanda, welcome. God bless you today.
[1:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We have um
[1:19] a couple of prayer requests I want to
[1:21] get to uh this morning. And so um and I
[1:25] want to make a quick announcement before
[1:27] I get to the prayer request. We'll read
[1:28] our scripture and then we'll take these
[1:30] prayer requests. Also I want to announce
[1:34] uh for the sake of the young people here
[1:39] uh at Bethl Tabernacle and for the sake
[1:42] of the broadcast
[1:44] uh the word you know is u we've had to
[1:47] keep it under wraps. Actually, there was
[1:49] a a time when only three humans knew,
[1:51] myself, brother Matt, and brother Jason
[1:53] Demars. Um, we will be having our youth
[1:57] camp this year at a different location.
[2:01] The the uh place at Travelers Rest uh
[2:04] was lost to us and uh there was some
[2:07] different changes that they made and uh
[2:10] we we could not find a middle ground to
[2:12] work with that and so we just committed
[2:14] it to the Lord. Now, I'll be honest with
[2:16] you. I just said, "Lord, this is going
[2:18] to take a miracle from heaven because I
[2:20] can't imagine a better location." But
[2:22] believe it or not, friends, we if if
[2:24] Traveler's Rest would would be a if if
[2:27] the if the new location we found is a
[2:30] 10, Traveler's Rest is about a six. And
[2:32] so it is spectacular.
[2:36] It is larger. It is I just said I'm
[2:40] going to put out an advertisement that
[2:42] just says more.
[2:44] More what? more everything. It'll hold
[2:48] more people. We'll have more campers. It
[2:51] has more facilities, better, newer,
[2:54] nicer. The grounds are wonderful. It's
[2:57] It's way up more higher in the
[2:58] mountains, which I love. Amen. It's
[3:00] actually near, not too far from
[3:03] Traveler's Rest. I best I can remember,
[3:05] maybe a 30 minute drive or so. Is that
[3:07] about right, brother Brad? Amen. And uh
[3:09] so, Amen. And I hope you like a mountain
[3:11] adventure because it is it looks it
[3:14] literally looks like that you you just
[3:16] go up and up and up. And after you go
[3:19] up, you go up some more and more and
[3:22] more and more still. And then it's
[3:25] almost as if somebody cut the top of a
[3:27] mountain off and they built a camp right
[3:29] on the plateau. And it is just
[3:32] breathtaking. And uh it has um much
[3:36] better facilities. Uh we can hold more
[3:38] people, more campers. We don't even need
[3:40] to have the ministers offsite. We had to
[3:43] rent Airbnbs and we had to have all
[3:45] kinds of things going on. We don't need
[3:47] to do that anymore. Everybody can be
[3:49] housed. Uh we've got plenty of room for
[3:51] everyone. Amen. And the accommodations
[3:54] are stunning. So, we want to make that
[3:57] announcement today. Brother Matt uh will
[4:00] be preparing a promo video like we do
[4:02] every year, and that'll be released uh
[4:06] soon. Amen. Believe me, I will stay on
[4:08] him to get it soon. He's ministering
[4:10] away today. Brother Jason's ministering
[4:12] away today. Amen. Um so, uh we want to
[4:16] be remembering them in prayer. Number of
[4:17] other people traveling today. Other
[4:19] people who couldn't be here uh got
[4:22] called in unexpected uh to work. Um and
[4:26] uh and then we've had a number of sick
[4:28] sick requests. We have um Sister
[4:31] Elizabeth Johnson asked prayer for a
[4:34] friend named Christina. She's 35 years
[4:37] old and dying from cancer. That's
[4:39] awfully young to die from cancer. And so
[4:43] fortunately for this woman, she happens
[4:45] to know a believer who happens to be
[4:47] able to send a message to her church and
[4:49] say, "Can you all join me in prayer?"
[4:50] How many will join our sister Elizabeth?
[4:53] She's dying from cancer and she needs
[4:55] healing, but she also needs salvation.
[4:58] And actually, Sister Elizabeth has that
[4:59] ahead of healing. Salvation and healing.
[5:02] Happy to have you, young man with us
[5:04] today. just noticed you there actually
[5:05] when I first came out. Just wanted to
[5:07] greet you. Um,
[5:09] Sister Addie uh Demar was up all night
[5:13] sick, throwing up. Poor little thing.
[5:15] So, Sister Amy uh is back with her
[5:18] today. So, let's be remembering our
[5:20] little princess here this morning. I
[5:22] hate to see her sick like that. Amen.
[5:25] Um, we have a prayer request from the
[5:28] Baratus family. Actually, Brother Dave
[5:31] himself, I dropped in to visit him and
[5:33] and I and I and I've got this underlined
[5:36] on my notes. He asked me to ask y'all to
[5:40] pray for him.
[5:42] And he's got a he's got testing he's got
[5:44] to do and he wants it to come back with
[5:47] good results. And I told him, I said,
[5:49] "We will absolutely pray." Amen. As a
[5:53] group, amen. When you know, when
[5:54] believers start praying, things start
[5:56] changing. Amen. And so we want to u take
[6:00] that as a request today. Uh brother
[6:03] Donnie wrote uh back um how many enjoyed
[6:06] brother Donnie when he was here last
[6:07] weekend. My goodness. um you know that
[6:10] he was talking about sister Erica his
[6:12] daughter and she's in those um terrible
[6:16] uh treatments for the cancer and and uh
[6:19] she wrote to him he wrote to me and
[6:22] different others saying she said sister
[6:25] Erica said she is depending on our
[6:28] prayers she's very weak and so she's
[6:31] asking you I just say wow let's bind
[6:33] together and ask the Lord for mercy for
[6:36] our sister I told brother Donnie I said
[6:38] brother Donnie You remember he was he
[6:39] was preaching about it here and uh when
[6:42] David cut off Goliath's head and they
[6:44] jumped up on him, cut his head off and
[6:46] he said, "I can't wait till the day and
[6:48] I wrote him back and I said, "Brother
[6:49] Donnie, we can't wait till the day to
[6:52] dance with you on this Goliath."
[6:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh Brother Caleb,
[6:57] uh him and Sister Joy needing prayer. Uh
[7:00] they're expecting uh another child and
[7:03] they're the doctor is saying there could
[7:05] be some tests that need to run. they see
[7:07] some possible complications and uh
[7:10] there's some genetic testing that's
[7:11] results are coming in and brother Caleb
[7:14] and sister Joy are asking that no
[7:16] abnormalities be found and then there's
[7:18] situation they saw that maybe there's an
[7:21] issue with her heart and I and I just
[7:23] said we are going to start today
[7:26] thanking God for a perfectly healthy
[7:29] child and delivery and I will not change
[7:33] that confession.
[7:35] Amen. Friends, I have seen that happen
[7:37] so many times. Impossible situations.
[7:40] And I'm not talking about, you know,
[7:42] charismatic, name it, claim it. I'm
[7:43] talking about substance of the word that
[7:45] we have a right to claim God's word and
[7:48] start thanking him. Put it in the past
[7:50] tense. Start thanking him. See, that's
[7:52] an insult to wait for him to do the
[7:54] miracle before you thank him. Go ahead
[7:56] and start thanking him now and go ahead
[7:58] and confess it. Brother Adam said, "If
[7:59] you're afraid to confess, Jesus can't
[8:01] help you cuz he's the high priest of
[8:03] your confession." the Bible says. So I
[8:05] just say thank you Lord for a perfectly
[8:07] healthy child and delivery and I will
[8:10] not change that. Amen. Brother Caleb
[8:12] says it's just the beginning to an
[8:14] amazing testimony of what the Lord's
[8:16] going to do. Amen. Amen.
[8:19] Going to do is do is doing has done.
[8:23] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. All
[8:25] right. Let's invite you to second Kings
[8:28] chapter 2 this morning. I read this I
[8:32] think I used this text I believe in part
[8:36] five or part four I can't remember now
[8:38] we're going back to visit it again today
[8:40] because I was not able to get to the
[8:42] material um and so today will be part
[8:45] six where we have been ministering on
[8:49] the time of the unsealing. So this will
[8:52] be the time of the unsealing part six.
[8:55] Amen. I can't think of any other
[8:58] announcements I need to make, but we'll
[9:00] take up these prayer requests when we
[9:02] when we pray over the word.
[9:05] It's familiar reading verses. We're
[9:07] going to go 2 Kings chapter 2 9-14.
[9:12] You have it? Say amen.
[9:14] Amen.
[9:14] Amen. It's on the screen, so everybody
[9:16] should say amen. Praise the Lord. And it
[9:19] came to pass when they were gone over
[9:22] that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask what
[9:25] I shall do for thee before I be taken
[9:27] away from thee." And Elisha said, "I
[9:29] pray thee, let a double portion of thy
[9:32] spirit be upon me." And he said, "Thou
[9:35] has asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if
[9:37] thou see me when I am taken from thee,
[9:40] it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it
[9:44] shall not be so." And it came to pass as
[9:48] they still went on and talked that
[9:52] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[9:54] and horses of fire and parted them both
[9:57] a sunder. And Elijah went up by a
[10:00] whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it
[10:03] and cried, "My father, my father, the
[10:05] chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
[10:06] thereof." And he saw him no more. And he
[10:10] took hold of his own clothes and rent
[10:12] them in two pieces. He took up also the
[10:15] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[10:17] went back and stood by the bank of
[10:19] Jordan.
[10:20] And he took the mantle of Elijah that
[10:22] fell from him and smokeote the waters
[10:24] and said, "Where is the Lord God of
[10:26] Elijah?" And when he also had smitten
[10:30] the waters, they parted hither and
[10:32] thither, and Elisha went over. Amen.
[10:36] Let's pray. Father, we come to you now
[10:40] thanking you for your word that's been
[10:42] read. We know that the word is already
[10:45] inspired. Lord, there's a there's a
[10:47] blessing promised just in reading it.
[10:50] There's a blessing promised just hearing
[10:52] it read. So, master, we are double
[10:55] blessed already this morning. But now,
[10:57] Father, we come to you with an appeal
[10:59] that you open the eyes of our
[11:01] understanding, Lord, that as Paul
[11:03] desired, we may be filled with all the
[11:05] fullness of the knowledge of God. May
[11:08] you grant it today that there be
[11:09] supernatural insight. Bless the speaker.
[11:12] Bless the hearer of the word, Lord,
[11:14] today in this building and afar,
[11:17] wherever the sound of this message may
[11:19] go. Lord, we have a number of sick
[11:22] requests that we've read out loud and
[11:25] put before you this morning. Lord, we
[11:26] are just depending on you for these
[11:29] things. We call them as done. We glorify
[11:32] you and we magnify you, Lord, for the
[11:34] great things that you have done, that
[11:36] you are doing, and that you yet shall
[11:38] do. Father, we commit ourselves into
[11:40] your hands for service
[11:43] today. And I thank you for the special
[11:45] grace that you've given me, Lord. And
[11:49] Father, thou knowest. And I commit it
[11:51] now to you in Jesus name. Amen. God
[11:54] bless you, friends, as you're seated.
[12:17] We see here
[12:19] in our reading
[12:21] uh uh the the ministry and type and
[12:24] shadow of the bride of Christ. Brother
[12:27] Brennham uh went to actually the very
[12:31] name of Elijah and he says notice the
[12:35] similarity between the name Elijah and
[12:39] Elisha.
[12:41] And so he said it's just like Mr. Jesus
[12:45] and Mrs. Jesus. So now as this ministry
[12:50] that worked through the Elijah ministry
[12:52] of our day, then it's not a stretch for
[12:56] us to see uh that that that now we have
[13:00] a ministry carrying forth from our
[13:03] Elijah into the bride or Mrs. Jesus
[13:07] Christ or the final voice to the final
[13:09] age. Are you people sitting right here?
[13:11] Come on.
[13:12] Amen. So, so you want to I I really want
[13:15] to bring you into that and have you take
[13:18] ownership of that today that you have,
[13:21] you know, you have not been called to
[13:24] Mount Cyani. You know, you've not been
[13:27] called where where Paul said there in
[13:29] Hebrews 12 to thunderings and lightnings
[13:31] and the mountain on fire, but you have
[13:34] been called to Mount Zion. Now, that's a
[13:36] beautiful passage because it's not
[13:38] saying you will be called. Now someday
[13:41] we will stand on a literal Mount Zion
[13:44] and we will walk the streets of a
[13:46] literal city.
[13:47] Come on.
[13:48] Amen. How you looking forward to that
[13:49] day?
[13:50] But Paul is not saying here in the
[13:52] spiritual sense you you you will someday
[13:55] come. He said you've already come to
[13:58] Mount Zion. You've already come to an
[14:00] innumerable company of angels. You've
[14:02] already you've already arrived where the
[14:05] the souls of of just men have been made
[14:08] perfect. You say, "Well, I don't know. I
[14:10] feel like I'm sitting right here in a
[14:12] building right now, and I don't feel I
[14:14] think I feel anything other than
[14:15] perfect." We're not talking, you know,
[14:17] you're there's three of you.
[14:18] Yeah. Come on.
[14:19] I mean, I've got this many people that I
[14:21] can see, but actually, I could triple it
[14:23] because I'm speaking to triune people
[14:26] and we're not talking about the
[14:28] limitations of this flesh which will
[14:30] perish, cannot inherit, flesh and blood
[14:32] cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[14:34] You're going to have a change someday.
[14:36] But I'm here to tell you, there's an
[14:37] element of you already in the presence
[14:40] of God, already crossed over the chasm,
[14:42] already sitting in heavenly places in
[14:44] Christ Jesus. Why would you not have
[14:47] authority in the word?
[14:49] Amen.
[14:50] That's a better question than to say,
[14:52] why do I have it? Why would you not? How
[14:54] could you not? Amen.
[14:56] If you're if you're already in heavenly
[14:58] places in Christ Jesus and you're
[15:01] already standing before God as a perfect
[15:04] person.
[15:06] So it's not a stretch then to imagine
[15:08] that the Elisha ministry is a type of
[15:12] our ministry today and therefore it
[15:14] warrants examination. You know because
[15:17] it was Elisha who continued the
[15:20] commission given to Elijah. Did you know
[15:22] that? Did you know that Elijah was given
[15:25] a number of things to do, but he left
[15:27] the earth before they were finished and
[15:30] the commission fell upon Elisha and then
[15:33] Elisha carried out and then even there
[15:35] was work after that. I'm here to tell
[15:37] you when you're gone, there's still the
[15:38] work of the lamb coming. There's still
[15:40] Moses and Elijah. There's still people
[15:43] who need redeeming. There's still a God
[15:46] who is who is mindful of the unwise
[15:49] virgin in the tribulation.
[15:50] Amen. Now you can see that in Genesis
[15:53] because you find that that Lot who was a
[15:56] perfect type of the unwise virgin. Am I
[15:58] right?
[15:59] And you find that when he escaped Sodom
[16:02] that it was three men, three three men
[16:05] who appeared to him. And we find that
[16:08] he's he's got some confusion about the
[16:10] Godhead. But and and and and you find
[16:13] those messengers, if you go back and
[16:15] look at the scripture, you find those
[16:17] messengers talking to him to get him out
[16:20] of Sodom. And the world has had their
[16:23] there are two messengers. There's two
[16:24] messengers saying, "You need to leave
[16:26] here." But once he has escaped Sodom,
[16:29] then you don't hear the voice of those
[16:31] two messengers anymore. You only hear
[16:33] the voice of one, and that one is God
[16:36] himself. because he's literally saying,
[16:39] "I can't bring this until you're clear
[16:42] and he even turns around and and request
[16:44] of God." So, so we see God actually
[16:48] still helping in type in Genesis. You
[16:51] can see God helping the unwise virgin
[16:54] even in the full even in the
[16:55] tribulation.
[16:56] Amen. Amen.
[16:58] See, so we see these types running
[17:00] beautiful. Now, I can't run it any
[17:02] further than that because it's not a
[17:03] tight Brother Brandham ever ran. And I
[17:05] and I would be presuming to try to lock
[17:08] it down and say it means this, this,
[17:09] this, and there's details. And I'm not
[17:11] trying to do that today. I'm just simply
[17:13] here to tell you that God is aware of
[17:15] wherever his family is anytime, every
[17:18] time, all the time.
[17:19] And we realize that those unwise virgins
[17:22] were righteous people. They were
[17:25] sanctified people. And so you can see
[17:28] that in between Matthew 25 and and the
[17:31] book of Revelation shows that they were
[17:33] actually saints
[17:35] that that in the tribulation the power
[17:38] of the antichrist will wear out the
[17:41] saints.
[17:42] Now that's not me and you are already in
[17:44] glory. That that's that's the that's
[17:46] those who were not elected under
[17:48] election but yet they were righteous
[17:51] people. The king shall say to the
[17:53] righteous and the righteous shall say to
[17:55] the king. See, and so saints means
[17:58] sanctified ones. This is why I believe
[18:01] firmly that the unwise virgin uh are
[18:04] those people who live sanctified lives.
[18:06] Can't see the message, but they live
[18:08] sanctified lives. Please don't try to
[18:10] tell me that the Tommy rot
[18:13] that we see out here professing to be
[18:15] Christianity. Don't come to me claiming
[18:17] that's foolish virgin. Now, I'm not
[18:19] saying those people might not be and
[18:21] don't aren't aware of it and maybe
[18:23] they'll have a further experience.
[18:25] Certainly.
[18:27] How many pulled us out of barrooms and
[18:29] brothel and backwoods and back alleys
[18:31] pulled us out of denominational
[18:33] churches, didn't he?
[18:35] So, God can can get a hold of anybody.
[18:37] I'm just here to tell you that that
[18:39] group who are standing there in Matthew
[18:42] 25 were righteous people. at whatever
[18:46] point they became righteous, that's up
[18:48] to God.
[18:50] So, so, so I'm just simply trying to get
[18:52] you to understand that that that that
[18:55] that's how the unwise virgin are made
[18:58] up. They are saints. They are
[19:01] sanctified. They are righteous people.
[19:04] And so at some point we find in the
[19:07] tribulation period that they have just
[19:09] enough of God's help to get out of to
[19:13] come out of Sodom and not take the mark
[19:15] of the beast.
[19:16] Mhm.
[19:17] All right. And you can see God helping
[19:19] them to do that. So I mean if God's not
[19:22] helping them to do that, how are they
[19:23] going to do it?
[19:25] I mean just just ask yourself that
[19:27] question. How how are they going to
[19:28] escape it if God doesn't help him? See
[19:30] how would Lot have escaped it if God
[19:32] didn't help him?
[19:33] Right? See? So, so I'm not I'm not
[19:35] trying to line it all out. That's Lot
[19:37] and his children. It's not for I don't
[19:40] have to worry about that. Uh, you know,
[19:41] that's why I'm never one of these to
[19:43] entertain a whole lot of conspiracy
[19:45] theory. And do you know what's happening
[19:47] behind in the White House and you know
[19:49] about black helicopters and you know
[19:50] this. I say whatever, whatever. That's
[19:52] Lot's children. That's I'm not I'm going
[19:55] to not have to worry about that. I'm
[19:57] going in a rapture.
[19:59] I'm not going to deny that there's all
[20:01] kinds of things that go on behind closed
[20:03] doors and secret handshakes. Sure, fine.
[20:05] Well, okay. But I I've got another plan.
[20:08] Amen.
[20:10] See,
[20:12] so to fulfill all that is intended,
[20:16] you know, God is still working even
[20:19] after the bride has gone through the
[20:21] ministry of the prophets. So that's why
[20:24] you cannot at any time start thinking
[20:28] that your revelation that you're going
[20:30] to somehow get a revelation in the word
[20:32] of God that's going to take you and you
[20:34] you've heard it. You know we we no
[20:37] longer the Holy Ghost is no longer
[20:38] important. You don't need the baptism of
[20:41] the Holy Spirit anymore. You don't need
[20:43] an intercessor anymore. You don't need
[20:44] an advocate anymore. The work of the
[20:46] lamb is finished. The work of the lamb
[20:48] is going on deeply into the book of
[20:50] Revelation. Amen.
[20:51] The work of the lamb is still moving on
[20:53] all the way through into the millennium.
[20:54] The work of the lamb is still moving.
[20:57] I mean, so so listen friends. If the if
[20:59] the brideges home at the end of the
[21:01] feast of Pentecost and the the the last
[21:05] three the last three feast days of
[21:07] Leviticus are the feast of trumpets to
[21:10] gather Israel.
[21:11] Yeah. Amen.
[21:12] And the feast of the atonement to bring
[21:14] Christ among them under Moses and
[21:15] Elijah. And then the feast of
[21:17] tabernacles to put them in a millennium
[21:19] with us.
[21:21] Amen.
[21:22] Then we find that the fourth feast,
[21:24] which is the feast of Pentecost, runs
[21:26] the entire length of the New Testament
[21:29] era and takes the bride home.
[21:30] Amen.
[21:31] And in the Pentecostal feast, you had
[21:33] two loaves, Jew and Gentile. You had
[21:35] they had leaven in them and and not not
[21:38] the unleaven bread. When Jesus was the
[21:40] unleavened bread, you understand? No sin
[21:43] in him. He was he said, "Take, eat. This
[21:45] is my body.
[21:46] He was the lamb. He was the Passover
[21:48] feast because John said, "Behold the
[21:50] lamb takes away the sin of the world."
[21:51] Jesus certainly was the feast of the
[21:53] first fruits, the third feast, because
[21:55] he rose from the grave.
[21:57] You see, but then that but then that
[21:59] that that burning, you had to take those
[22:02] two loaves and they actually had sin in
[22:04] them because because even though they
[22:07] had walked with Jesus, they weren't yet
[22:09] born again of the spirit of God. But on
[22:11] the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty
[22:13] wind comes and the fire because they
[22:15] take those two loaves of of leaven and
[22:18] burn them.
[22:21] So if you're going to do away with the
[22:22] burning of the Holy Ghost, how are you
[22:24] going to fit it into the feast days?
[22:26] Unless you're planning to be here in the
[22:27] tribulation,
[22:28] right?
[22:30] I don't plan to be here.
[22:32] I'm sorry if it seems like I'm going to
[22:34] desert you. I am.
[22:38] I don't I don't love you that much. I I
[22:40] I want to go home. I want to be with I
[22:42] want to be in the first resurrection.
[22:45] Amen. You know, I do love you.
[22:48] Amen. But it's my love that compels me
[22:51] to get you ready.
[22:53] Amen.
[22:54] Amen. So, so you you you can't, you
[22:57] know, the devil can just he I find this
[23:00] I find this to be true that if the devil
[23:02] can't hold you back from an
[23:05] understanding of the word, if he knows
[23:07] God's about to reveal something great to
[23:09] you and he's trying everything to
[23:11] distract you, distract you, distract
[23:12] you, hold you back, hold you back. If he
[23:14] realizes he's about to lose his grip and
[23:16] he can't hold you back, what he'll
[23:18] generally do is just shove you over the
[23:20] cliff. If he can't hold you back, it'll
[23:22] shove you and you end up going too far
[23:25] and over the cliff. And we've seen too
[23:26] much of that. And it's so unnecessary
[23:28] because we had a prophet come to rightly
[23:30] divide the word of truth.
[23:32] And as long as I stay within the
[23:34] boundaries of what God sent me in this
[23:36] day, I'm sure to make it
[23:38] because he was he said, "I only ever
[23:40] preach what Paul preached." And those
[23:42] millions who are already there said, "We
[23:46] are here resting on that."
[23:49] Amen. So we don't ever imagine that you
[23:52] get beyond needing the fiery burning of
[23:56] the fourth feast of Pentecost because
[24:00] that goes all the way till the bride
[24:02] leaves here.
[24:04] So we see Abraham,
[24:06] you know, in a sign of the son of man.
[24:09] We we're looking at Elijah and the
[24:11] ministry of Elisha
[24:13] and they were they were different. They
[24:15] were quite different. Elijah was a a man
[24:18] of the wilderness.
[24:20] Really stayed away from people. Elisha
[24:23] actually wasn't like that. Elisha
[24:25] actually mingled around in the school of
[24:27] the prophets trying to help people. He
[24:28] was more of a people's prophet.
[24:30] Amen.
[24:30] You understand? So, so I'm not here
[24:32] trying to be William Brandom.
[24:34] I'm here trying to be the final voice to
[24:36] the final age.
[24:38] And I'm still going into the hedges and
[24:39] the highways. Not that William Brandham
[24:41] didn't do that. I'm just simply saying
[24:42] that this bride as a global bride h has
[24:46] a has a continuation of that Elijah
[24:49] ministry. And it's I I don't I'm not
[24:51] going to hold campaigns and take people
[24:53] by the hand or try to guess their you
[24:55] know discern their their because I don't
[24:57] have that gift. I don't have you know
[24:59] people say oh well the angel of the Lord
[25:01] goes before me. Well no kidding. The
[25:04] angel of the Lord is among us all.
[25:06] It doesn't make you some big shot. It
[25:08] doesn't make me some little pipsqueak. I
[25:10] I'm glad that he is here. He's among us
[25:13] now.
[25:14] There's no big eyes and little U's. This
[25:16] is a ministry of Elisha carrying on the
[25:19] commission.
[25:21] Oh my friends,
[25:24] requires deep humility.
[25:27] Deep and and and deep dedication. I want
[25:30] to talk about that a little bit more as
[25:31] we go.
[25:33] going to pace myself today because I'm
[25:35] really hoping to finish this series.
[25:40] So, we'll try. So, so we find that we
[25:44] look at Elijah. We've looked at Abraham.
[25:47] Now, it's important to look at Abraham
[25:50] because it was in Abraham's day that
[25:53] brother Brandham constantly pointed back
[25:55] to when he had the sign of the son of
[25:57] man.
[25:57] Now, the sign of the son of man just
[25:59] simply means the word made flesh.
[26:02] All right? So it it wasn't just it
[26:04] wasn't just that great eternal creature
[26:08] uh coming down from heaven and telling
[26:10] Abraham, you know, speaking something
[26:12] that no one else heard, no one else
[26:14] seen. No, God came down in a human body
[26:17] and actually Sarah seen him and Abraham
[26:19] saw him and the servants fed him.
[26:22] Yeah.
[26:22] Amen.
[26:23] You understand? So this is this is the
[26:25] beauty both the beauty and the
[26:27] simplicity of the ministry of the son of
[26:29] man. We're not talking about the office.
[26:31] God's a prophet.
[26:32] There's a difference between the office
[26:33] and the ministry. The ministry is the
[26:35] word made flesh in you. You are the
[26:36] ministry of the son of man. You're
[26:38] operating it right now.
[26:40] Amen.
[26:41] This is what the word came to
[26:42] accomplish. This is why we have a
[26:44] message.
[26:46] So it had to come into a people. So then
[26:49] of course then this in turn, you know,
[26:51] it if you if you think about what that
[26:54] did for Abraham. Now put yourself there.
[26:57] What has it done? What has it done for
[26:59] you? It's to do the same thing for you
[27:02] it did to Abraham.
[27:04] And brother Brandham would go back and
[27:06] point to that constantly to say, "Now
[27:08] that that you see back there in Genesis
[27:10] is happening right now." See, and so
[27:13] when you think about how that what was
[27:15] it to produce in Abraham, it was to
[27:18] produce in Abraham a mind beyond
[27:20] himself.
[27:22] Yes.
[27:24] Because you know, Abraham was a man with
[27:26] flaws and had his ups and downs, had had
[27:29] failures and had lied and got busted
[27:30] lying.
[27:32] See, and and and got and then it even
[27:34] happened a second time. So Abraham
[27:37] wasn't a perfect human, but the Bible
[27:39] talks about that his faith was perfect.
[27:42] His faith never wavered. Abraham, like
[27:45] Elijah, was a man of like passions. We
[27:47] preached on this before because, you
[27:49] know, here we are in the ministry of the
[27:51] son of man. We're not perfect humans,
[27:52] but my faith is perfect.
[27:55] I have faith in a perfect word, and I
[27:57] have perfect faith in a perfect word.
[28:00] And so Abraham had to receive something
[28:02] that would take him beyond himself, a
[28:04] mind that could call the impossible
[28:07] possible. Uh and and then and then it
[28:10] and then it it didn't just get a son on
[28:14] the scene, which was impossible cuz
[28:17] remember him and Sarah had already been
[28:19] young and they couldn't have children.
[28:21] And now they're old. So now it's double
[28:23] impossible. But yet they did. And how
[28:25] did that happen? Because Abraham was a
[28:27] perfect man. No. Because Abraham had
[28:29] perfect faith.
[28:31] Because Abraham never made a mistake.
[28:32] No. But his faith was flawless in the
[28:35] word of God.
[28:36] And he called it as though it already
[28:39] was.
[28:40] See? H. But now we're going to find that
[28:43] that when brother Brandham comes to the
[28:45] third pole and this is something I've
[28:47] talked about in the series previous that
[28:50] when brother Brandham comes out of the
[28:51] woods and he's you know you've got
[28:53] squirrels and you've got the reds in
[28:56] Indiana and you've got the grays in
[28:57] Kentucky and we've talked about the
[28:59] nearly insane trip he had there in
[29:02] Kentucky. You remember we preached on
[29:03] that.
[29:04] We can talk about the the tumor that he
[29:06] spoke out of existence. We can talk
[29:08] about the storm that he rebuked. We can
[29:09] talk about the fish that he gave life
[29:11] to. We can talk about uh a believer
[29:14] mother being able to apply the token to
[29:17] her children and it works.
[29:20] Amen.
[29:22] Regardless of the children, it the token
[29:24] works. Yeah. Right.
[29:25] See, and so so so now when we're when
[29:30] we're looking at at that ministry of the
[29:33] third pull, brother Brandham tied that
[29:37] back to Genesis 18 when Abraham needed
[29:41] something other than his son to
[29:42] sacrifice. He needed a lamb. And Abraham
[29:47] starts using the power of the third
[29:49] pull. The lad and I shall go to Yonder
[29:52] Mountain. and the lad and I shall
[29:55] return. Wait a minute. God didn't tell
[29:57] you that. But this is a different mind.
[29:59] This is a mind that God has now began
[30:02] because Abraham has already determined
[30:04] this is the promise.
[30:07] See, and and I I'm going to I'm going to
[30:10] go kill him. But but the mind of Christ
[30:12] told Abraham there's no human can undo
[30:15] the promise.
[30:17] So it wouldn't matter. He said, "I just
[30:19] am sure he'll just raise him back up
[30:20] again." You need to understand that
[30:22] today, friends. I don't care how
[30:23] impossibly impossible it is. You have no
[30:26] ability to undo the promise of God.
[30:30] The promise of God that has been made
[30:32] for your life.
[30:34] Amen.
[30:36] Amen.
[30:37] Getting ahead of myself a little bit. So
[30:38] he says,
[30:40] "So now this was a a mind to call the
[30:44] impossible possible, but now even more
[30:49] so."
[30:51] say, "Wow, more so than that 25 year
[30:54] trudge through every kind of fear and
[30:57] doubt and kept confessing it." Yeah,
[30:58] even more than that.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:00] This is going to be more than than the
[31:03] the the the church in the ages. This is
[31:06] going to come to the ministry of the son
[31:07] of man. And this is going to bring a
[31:10] child on the scene. And this is going to
[31:12] grow that child until the Lord now is
[31:15] ready for the next event and calls upon
[31:17] Abraham to have more faith than he had
[31:21] to have getting the son here.
[31:24] He's now going to have to have more
[31:26] faith to now than the faith that he had
[31:28] to get him here because now he's going
[31:32] he's basically being told to end God's
[31:36] promise.
[31:37] Yeah. Amen.
[31:38] Cuz this was the promised child. So, I
[31:41] want you to go there this morning.
[31:42] Abraham is being told, "Listen, mortal,
[31:46] go end God's promise."
[31:48] Yeah.
[31:50] Good luck with that.
[31:51] I want you to go do it on sacrifice him
[31:54] on a mountain that I'm going to show
[31:55] you. And by the time Abraham comes to
[31:58] the well, the mountain's already in the
[32:00] distance. You know Abraham is already
[32:03] understanding heavens and earth may pass
[32:06] away but the word of God can never pass
[32:09] away. And Jesus said not one iota not
[32:12] one jot not one tit that's just little
[32:15] that's the that's from the smallest
[32:17] letter of the alphabet to the most
[32:19] extreme case of the law to even dots and
[32:22] punctuations.
[32:24] Nothing of the word of God can ever pass
[32:26] away but faith from somewhere beyond
[32:29] himself knew that the most impossibly
[32:33] impossible situation, the most
[32:35] impossibly impossible thing in existence
[32:38] would be to undo the promise of God. And
[32:41] Abraham knew nothing I do can undo the
[32:44] promise of God.
[32:47] That's right.
[32:48] You need to have that kind of faith
[32:50] today. That's what and we're not we as
[32:51] we said to you here, you know, we're not
[32:53] we know that those examples of the third
[32:55] pole are going to work through the
[32:56] bride. They already are working through
[32:57] the bread. They'll work even more. But
[32:59] we're not talking about, you know,
[33:01] giving life to aquatic creatures. We're
[33:03] not talking about uh setting uh wildlife
[33:05] on your table for for supper. We're
[33:08] talking about what does it take to be
[33:10] that kind of a person that God can trust
[33:12] and can move down through their lives.
[33:15] It takes dedication. It takes
[33:17] consecration before God. Amen.
[33:19] That's the lesson.
[33:21] Yes. Amen.
[33:22] That's the lesson.
[33:24] Yes.
[33:24] When you read those third pole events
[33:26] that Brother Brandham said, we've done
[33:28] these things in a small measure.
[33:31] But the dynamics of this church will be
[33:34] a refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[33:36] Hallelujah.
[33:38] Upon the mechanics that we've operated,
[33:40] yeah,
[33:41] in a small measure.
[33:43] And we're looking to see it to see it
[33:46] move beyond. And here we've been 60
[33:49] years. But I'm here to tell you to God
[33:51] that's nothing.
[33:52] I heard brother Brandham in a prayer
[33:54] just the other day, yesterday or day
[33:56] before. And he was in a prayer and he
[33:58] said, "Now Lord, all these long 2,000
[34:01] years meant nothing to you."
[34:04] Like, wow. 2,000 years. How many volumes
[34:07] of history that would take to cover all
[34:08] of that? And and and now you're talking
[34:11] about a God who had a mind of all the
[34:13] history. every not just the humans but
[34:16] every net and how many times it would
[34:18] bat its eye over 2,000 years and that
[34:21] meant nothing to God. I'm here to tell
[34:23] you something friends don't limit the
[34:25] God of Israel. He's so large. He's so
[34:27] amazing. He's so vast.
[34:30] Oh, hallelujah. And so we find that that
[34:33] Abraham now could not cause he his faith
[34:37] told him that there's no way that a man
[34:40] could cause the word of God to fail.
[34:43] Amen.
[34:44] See, and so, so today I invite you to
[34:47] have that same kind of faith. If I say
[34:48] to you, have the faith of Abraham. Say,
[34:50] "Brother Jason, I got all kinds of
[34:52] mistakes." I'm going to say, "Have the
[34:54] faith of Abraham."
[34:55] You'll know now what I'm talking about.
[34:58] What I'm talking about is have a faith
[34:59] that God's already made you a promise.
[35:01] What promise did he make you, Brother
[35:03] Jason? I have passed from death to life
[35:05] and I can never come into the judgment.
[35:08] Hallelujah. And nothing I could ever do
[35:11] or not do could ever change that
[35:13] promise.
[35:15] Hallelujah.
[35:18] See?
[35:19] So, so this all then no, no failure on
[35:23] my part can change the promise of God.
[35:25] Amen.
[35:26] So, this all connects us to Luke 17 with
[35:29] the ministry of the son of man, the word
[35:31] made flesh. And of course, this was this
[35:33] was always the promise under the
[35:35] jubilee. That's the beauty of it. You
[35:37] know, I I I love I just love I I I
[35:42] almost take it's almost fun to me to
[35:45] encounter people who try to say, you
[35:48] know, this teaching of William Brandham
[35:50] was not scriptural.
[35:53] Okay. Okay. Let's go.
[35:57] You got your Bible? You're going to need
[35:59] it.
[36:01] because I spent my lifetime since a boy
[36:04] going through this message back and
[36:06] forth with my Bible. That's what you
[36:08] should do.
[36:09] That's what you should do
[36:11] when you go when you listen to a tape
[36:12] friends. If people just remember William
[36:14] Brandham was a word prophet and when you
[36:16] listen to a tape, let me give you
[36:17] something young people. This will help
[36:19] you.
[36:19] When you're listening to Brother
[36:20] Brandham preach a sermon, brother
[36:22] Brandham isn't just your average
[36:24] preacher up there bringing some concept.
[36:26] Brother Brandham is a prophet. He's He's
[36:28] a He's taking you on a journey.
[36:32] He's taking you on a journey through the
[36:34] Bible. Follow him.
[36:37] Follow him. Get your Bible. Listen.
[36:40] Follow him through the scriptures. I'm
[36:42] here to tell you, you'll understand that
[36:44] it's nothing but the continuation of the
[36:46] mind of Christ and a prophet. And now
[36:48] it's coming into you
[36:50] because you're the final voice to the
[36:52] final age.
[36:54] Hallelujah. See,
[36:57] so we find that that this whole idea of
[37:01] the Jubilee that it would be he said, I
[37:03] will take the stone stony heart from you
[37:05] and I'll put in you a heart of flesh.
[37:06] See, he was always planning to live in
[37:09] his people. Minister of the son of man.
[37:11] What he showed in Abraham was always the
[37:13] plan.
[37:14] It was always going to be that. It it be
[37:16] that it'll be that in the in the
[37:17] millennium because because in the
[37:20] millennium you don't have the new city.
[37:22] You don't you don't have that. And so
[37:24] you you find that it's Christ. It's God
[37:26] dwelling in Christ and his people and
[37:29] and you are the temple. You are the new
[37:33] city in the millennium. You are the
[37:35] heavenly Jerusalem before the real one
[37:37] has actually come on the scene. The
[37:40] heavenly Jerusalem is already here now
[37:43] in operation. See? So that's why in some
[37:46] places it calls it a holy Jerusalem
[37:48] because you are lively stones. He was a
[37:50] lively stone. You're lively stones. Yes.
[37:53] See,
[37:53] so you're the you're the tabernacle of
[37:55] the living God's dwelling place, as
[37:57] brother Brandon would would would phrase
[37:58] it.
[38:00] So we have now this this this this
[38:04] promise of the word to be made flesh.
[38:07] And so this day of Abraham correlates,
[38:10] of course, we all know that it
[38:12] correlates with the days of Noah. When
[38:13] you go to Luke 17, Jesus connects them
[38:17] as it was in the days of Noah and the
[38:19] days of Lot. Which is why I've said to
[38:21] you, you live in an unprecedented era.
[38:24] No age has ever had to fight both of
[38:26] them at the same time.
[38:27] Amen.
[38:28] You know, God's family, you know, Enoch
[38:31] handled the days of Noah.
[38:32] Amen.
[38:33] Amen.
[38:34] Abraham handled the days of Lot.
[38:37] You got to handle them both together.
[38:40] Amen. So, so we, so we find out that
[38:43] this that and so what's the answer for
[38:46] both of them? Become the word made
[38:48] flesh. Amen.
[38:49] It's the word being made flesh, whether
[38:51] it was in Enoch or whether it was in
[38:53] Abraham. That's what always defeats the
[38:55] devil and brings forth the promise of
[38:57] God's word. It's inescapable. See, so
[39:00] now we know that that at this time of
[39:04] Noah and at this time of Lot, we find
[39:08] that the world, especially in the days
[39:10] of Noah, the world had had had got into
[39:15] a state of catastrophe.
[39:17] Yeah. Amen.
[39:18] Catastrophe
[39:19] when God come down to analyze and all he
[39:22] found the earth his beautiful earth his
[39:25] be that he spent thousands of years
[39:28] developing
[39:29] and he finds it in a catastrophe
[39:32] and men's minds are just sewed all the
[39:35] way around the world are evil
[39:37] continually
[39:39] and out of all the population of all
[39:42] humanity you've got you've got Enoch
[39:45] who's a representative of the brag
[39:47] You've got Noah who's rep who's rep
[39:49] who's a dual representation. He
[39:51] represents the 144,000 but brother
[39:53] Brandham said most of the time that's
[39:54] that was the reference he used but also
[39:56] represents the uh you know the believer
[39:59] who are in the ark of Christ carried
[40:01] carried over the tribulation but the
[40:03] problem was you still had ham and there
[40:05] brother said see so so sin carried
[40:08] through anyhow and so so we realize you
[40:11] got to you got to keep those types
[40:12] running perfectly. The the I'm not
[40:14] trying to teach that this morning. The
[40:15] point that I'm making is that now we
[40:18] know that that that when we look around
[40:20] in the earth and we see the days of Noah
[40:24] Yeah.
[40:24] and the days of Lot, do we?
[40:27] Then you automatically know that's the
[40:29] time of the ministry of the son of man.
[40:31] And if you know that's the time of the
[40:32] ministry of the son of man, then you
[40:33] know that's the time of the third pull.
[40:35] And if you know that's the time of the
[40:36] third pull, then there's got to be an
[40:37] Elisha here. There's got to be a people
[40:40] who carry it on
[40:42] to the coming of the Lord. See,
[40:45] so now we know that's when this power of
[40:48] the spoken word which operates perfect
[40:51] faith will be in operation. You have
[40:53] arrived. You're here. You're you're it.
[40:57] Perfect faith because it's the mind of
[40:59] Christ in operation,
[41:02] not your mind.
[41:06] And that's the key. That's what choked
[41:08] brother Bratam down in Mark 11. He
[41:10] couldn't understand. And you know, and
[41:12] he even he even said, "Well, I just
[41:14] don't get it. Everything has to be in
[41:15] the atonement." And so, well, I don't
[41:18] know how to explain that because now
[41:19] he's saying that it'll be me whatever I
[41:22] say, man. How is that how is that
[41:25] covered in the atonement of Christ? Cuz
[41:27] it's got to be Christ. It can't be me.
[41:30] But yet, the Bible is saying if you say,
[41:32] and brother Brandham,
[41:34] I don't even know. Okay, here's what
[41:35] I'll say. If I get asked a question,
[41:38] I'll just say, "Well, that was before
[41:41] the the atonement. That was before
[41:42] Calvary." Great Baptist doctrine.
[41:46] I mean, that's fantastic Baptist
[41:48] theology. And brother Brown's former
[41:49] Baptist. It worked for him. That's what
[41:50] I'll say. But the Lord wasn't going to
[41:53] let Elijah make that mistake. And he
[41:55] follows him into the woods. And here's
[41:56] Brother Ram going trying to get some
[41:57] rest. And the Lord just follows him in
[41:58] there.
[41:59] What are you doing?
[42:01] I'm hunting.
[42:03] What are you hunting? Squirrels. How
[42:04] many you need? Three. Where would they
[42:08] come from?
[42:09] And he goes, and and I don't want to
[42:11] relive all that. We we had a we had a we
[42:14] were we were all falling in the floor
[42:15] last time. Brother Josh, we were just
[42:17] Brother Brandon was just like beside
[42:19] himself. Who are you? Who's talking to
[42:21] me? Where's that light? Who are you?
[42:23] What do you want?
[42:25] It's almost having a nervous breakdown.
[42:27] Oh, just if it's not there, say it'll be
[42:29] there. Okay, it'll be there. And he goes
[42:31] there and it's not there.
[42:34] Well, you said it would be there. Well,
[42:36] but two's enough. No, you said three.
[42:39] You've already spoke it. Do you realize
[42:42] that that who who what God thinks of
[42:45] you? You are that mouthpiece that he's
[42:48] looking to use in this day.
[42:51] So, I would say to you, friends, h how
[42:54] dare any of us to live a carnal
[42:56] lifestyle?
[42:58] You weren't called here to do that. You
[43:00] weren't called here to have one foot in
[43:02] Leodysia and one foot in the kingdom.
[43:04] You're called to be disciples of Christ.
[43:08] You're called to be representatives of
[43:10] the living God. How dare any of us allow
[43:14] the poisons and toxins of the world.
[43:18] This has got to be the perfect
[43:20] operation. And that's where God cleared
[43:22] it up to him and said, "So, you're
[43:24] worried that it's you saying it?" Okay.
[43:25] So when you're in a prayer line and you
[43:27] suddenly know the secrets of people's
[43:29] hearts, you think that's you knowing
[43:31] that or that's me.
[43:33] So when you condemn a cancer and a woman
[43:35] who's dying gets up off a cot and walks
[43:37] out healed, do you think that's you
[43:39] saying leave her Satan or you think
[43:41] that's me? And it clicked and Brother
[43:42] Brandham caught it. You know, Lord,
[43:44] that's definitely you. Well, then why
[43:46] you worried about it? If my scripture
[43:48] says if you say to this mountain, all
[43:50] you got to do is be in the position,
[43:51] I'll do the speaking.
[43:54] I'll be in your lips. You don't have to
[43:56] worry about it. Your job is to be
[43:59] dedicated and consecrated and have a
[44:02] life that is close to the Holy Spirit.
[44:05] It's not for you to decide. This isn't
[44:07] about going out and deciding what you're
[44:09] going to speak into existence.
[44:11] Right.
[44:12] See, God's got to be able to trust you.
[44:14] Amen.
[44:16] See, just like I mean, Brother Brandham
[44:19] had to pass a test when a young man and
[44:22] a young woman presented themselves as
[44:24] his enemy,
[44:25] right, in a church meeting. And with the
[44:28] power to kill him,
[44:30] the power to have him, like brother
[44:32] Eddie said, blow through the roof and
[44:33] land in the street
[44:35] with with power to whatever he would say
[44:38] would happen. I I'm not so sure if God
[44:42] gave me that kind of power.
[44:44] Are you that kind of power? And I start
[44:47] thinking about my enemies.
[44:49] I'm going to suddenly feel inspired to
[44:51] start, you know, like you say, well,
[44:53] that's you're terrible. Well, hey, John
[44:55] wanted to burn people cuz they weren't
[44:57] they weren't with Jesus. Oh, Lord,
[45:00] they're not up here in our church.
[45:01] Should we call fire down out of heaven
[45:03] like Elijah?
[45:07] And Jesus said, "You don't even know
[45:09] what spirit you're of."
[45:11] [Music]
[45:12] See, that's what happens when you live
[45:15] uh, you know, and you don't go to the
[45:17] atonement. That's what happens. And so,
[45:19] it's all about God bringing you into a
[45:21] point of a new birth by the Holy Spirit
[45:23] and training you and getting you to
[45:25] learn how to humble and surrender
[45:27] yourself. You're going to need
[45:28] character, friends. You're going to need
[45:30] character.
[45:31] See, and so, so it had to have this
[45:35] perfect faith because it's got to
[45:36] operate the mind of Christ. So the great
[45:39] exploits as we've been saying there, the
[45:41] Bible talks about the people of the last
[45:43] day will do great exploits. The people
[45:45] who know their God.
[45:47] Now that's got to be something
[45:50] because
[45:52] I mean by the time that gets said a lot
[45:55] of jaw-dropping supernatural things had
[45:59] already happened.
[46:00] Amen. I mean just just what Abraham
[46:03] pulled off and what Moses pulled off and
[46:05] what Joshua pulled off and what I mean I
[46:09] mean all these prophets and different
[46:10] things and and suddenly now he's saying
[46:12] the people of the last day he didn't go
[46:14] down a laundry list and say like this
[46:16] one did this and this one did this and
[46:17] this one did this you'll do that and
[46:18] you'll do that you'll do that just like
[46:19] that. He goes no he just he just labels
[46:22] it great exploits.
[46:23] Yeah.
[46:24] So now this is something at the end time
[46:26] that's going to be somewhat
[46:27] unprecedented. You say can that happen?
[46:30] This is the very thing that occurred to
[46:32] brother Brandham
[46:35] when he said you know I always taught
[46:39] that when Jesus said more than this
[46:42] shall you do for I go to my father and
[46:44] brother Brandham said in perfect common
[46:47] sense as any preacher would have he said
[46:50] well of course you can't do anything
[46:52] more than the Lord did I mean he broke
[46:55] bread and multiplied it. He raised the
[46:57] dead. He walked on water.
[47:01] How you going to do more than that? See,
[47:04] but brother Brandham said, "So I always
[47:06] just said it, greater than this shall
[47:09] you do just means I'll do more of the
[47:11] same. I'll just do more of what he did."
[47:14] But brother Brandham, it occurred to
[47:15] him. He said, you know, he said one
[47:19] thing he never did like in the woods, he
[47:22] said, "Say where it'll be." He said
[47:25] Jesus never did that.
[47:28] He never created something out of
[47:30] nothing. He turned water into wine. He
[47:34] multiplied fish and loaves.
[47:36] You understand? He He put a coin in a
[47:39] fish's mouth for Peter to catch.
[47:42] But he never like now you're all the way
[47:44] back to Genesis. In the beginning, God
[47:47] said, "Let there be."
[47:49] And brother Brandham said now he said
[47:51] there in the woods out of nothing. He
[47:54] just said say where it'll be. And he
[47:56] said I said it'll be right there and
[47:58] there it was looking at me. See and he
[48:01] said I I shot it. Visions don't bleed.
[48:04] He said I ate it.
[48:06] And so so we find then that great
[48:09] exploits. Now, it's not a it's not it
[48:12] should not be a stretch in your mind to
[48:14] say to now correlate under the third
[48:16] pole to say what things might happen,
[48:18] what might we do. I would simply say
[48:21] that you're not even sure what you're
[48:23] going to face yet.
[48:25] So, I wouldn't be all up in the air over
[48:27] what I'm going to say or what I'm going
[48:29] to do cuz you don't even know the
[48:30] world's already worse than you thought
[48:32] it would be. It's already gotten
[48:34] exponentially worse than at a rate we
[48:37] never thought we could see. Come on. 5
[48:39] 10 years ago, you'd have never thought
[48:41] we could get to the place where we are
[48:43] today. So, I don't know what we'll face,
[48:45] but I know this. The pathway to victory
[48:48] is through dedication.
[48:50] The pathway to victory is not trying to
[48:52] figure it all out. The pathway to
[48:53] victory is to be humble, to be sincere,
[48:56] to have my life full of the Holy Spirit.
[48:59] Hallelujah.
[49:01] And that's the lesson. As I said to you,
[49:03] the lesson's not go in the woods and
[49:04] create animals or speak to a storm.
[49:06] That's not the lesson. The lesson is a
[49:08] dedicated life.
[49:09] Amen.
[49:11] See the common thread. See, I mean, I
[49:15] mean, if you think about it, friends,
[49:16] exploits like squirrels and fish and
[49:18] storms and faith in a token giving us
[49:20] our children, these are all things that
[49:22] could operate in our life. Brother
[49:23] Brandham even talked about to the to the
[49:25] point of missing limbs. I mean, I love
[49:27] the whole thing about how he vanished a
[49:29] tumor.
[49:31] That's my favorite one other than made
[49:33] him my children under a token.
[49:35] Yeah. say, "Well, why do you love love
[49:38] so much about vanishing a tumor?" Well,
[49:40] just think it through. He vanished
[49:42] something that was not supposed to be
[49:44] there.
[49:45] And I got a lot of things in my life
[49:46] that ain't supposed to be there. And I
[49:48] need a power. I need a word that can
[49:51] vanish it out of my life. I need a word
[49:53] that can vanish all my weaknesses and
[49:55] vanish anytime the devil gets it up on
[49:57] me. I need to vanish him out of my life.
[50:00] Oh, you need a vanishing friends. Homes
[50:02] need to vanish the devil. You've got the
[50:04] power to bind and the power to loose.
[50:07] Amen.
[50:08] Hallelujah.
[50:11] So the common thread in it all from
[50:15] from Noah to Abraham, from Abraham to
[50:19] Elisha, Elijah to from Elijah to Elisha,
[50:22] from Elisha to Jesus, from Jesus through
[50:25] the apostles and all down through the
[50:27] early church to us now to we who are
[50:30] alive and remain. Do you know the Bible
[50:34] wrote about you 2,000 years ago? There
[50:38] would be a people and in spite of the
[50:40] madness of the world and the darkness of
[50:43] the evil day, there would be a people
[50:45] who would be alive and remain. I'm still
[50:48] a believer. I'm still marching to Zion.
[50:52] Hallelujah. And I'm a I'm a living
[50:55] example of that promise. Amen.
[50:58] See,
[51:00] brother said they'll say, "Oh my, wasn't
[51:02] Elijah supposed to come? Wasn't there
[51:04] supposed to be a rapture?"
[51:06] See, and they won't even they won't even
[51:10] have realized yet
[51:12] that uh till after we're gone for a
[51:16] little while that they've already missed
[51:18] it.
[51:19] Yeah. Amen. and and you know, except for
[51:22] maybe a few crazy people running around
[51:24] trying to talk to the world about a
[51:25] movement they used to be in and now all
[51:27] those people are gone and it's probably
[51:29] the bride and we're probably doomed. And
[51:34] I'm glad God's going to help his
[51:36] remnant.
[51:37] I'm glad that gives me joy. I'm glad to
[51:41] know that not everybody in the
[51:43] tribulation is going to go to the lake
[51:45] of fire. Amen.
[51:46] Here's a glad man cuz I got loved ones
[51:49] who can't see what I see. But I'm glad
[51:51] to know not everyone in the
[51:53] tribulation's going to the lake of fire.
[51:55] Hallelujah. God's going to take care of
[51:57] his family.
[51:58] Hallelujah.
[52:00] Oh my. But nobody will believe them
[52:04] until it's too late. I'm afraid. See,
[52:08] we've spent a lot of time. We've spent
[52:10] this series and I'm just trying to wind
[52:12] it up today more stirring you up by way
[52:15] of remembrance more than anything else.
[52:18] But you know, we've told you real
[52:20] stories
[52:22] of real people living real lives in real
[52:25] time.
[52:26] Amen.
[52:27] And you know that's not unusual. The
[52:29] Bible say, "Brother Jason, that's a
[52:31] rather bizarre way to preach." It's not.
[52:32] The whole Bible's filled with that.
[52:34] Yeah.
[52:34] You know, you know, you you can go over
[52:36] here to a certain place and they'll say
[52:38] someday they your children will say,
[52:40] "What meanth these stones?" And you will
[52:42] tell them the story of how we came out
[52:44] and we put these stones and we crossed
[52:46] over and and it'll be a memorial for for
[52:49] generations to come. The Bible says they
[52:51] were for our example. I mean, the whole
[52:53] gospels begin with a story.
[52:55] Yeah.
[52:56] See, the whole gospels, you know, the
[52:58] beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[53:00] the son of God, there's where Mark
[53:01] starts. Mark 1:1, you know, Matthew, you
[53:05] know, he's a tax collector, so it's all
[53:07] numbers and X's and O's to him. So, he
[53:09] immediately starts with the genealogy
[53:10] and tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
[53:11] tick. And he tracks Joseph and tracks
[53:13] Mary, and he brings it all down. He's
[53:15] trying to prove uh the case that Jesus
[53:18] was in the kingly line of Messiah. And
[53:20] he did a a fantastic job of it. Actually
[53:22] made it ironclad. Uh and and you know,
[53:25] and then and of course, you know, Luke,
[53:27] he's going to tell his story. You know,
[53:28] having had perfect understanding, O
[53:30] Theophilus, from the very beginning, it
[53:32] seemed good to me also to tell you all
[53:34] the things that Jesus began both to do
[53:35] and teach, you know, and these whole
[53:37] things. And then John, my goodness, John
[53:39] like fires a rocket, goes all the way
[53:42] back. Well, yeah, John, care, we're
[53:44] going to hit Genesis 1. We're going way
[53:46] past Genesis 1. We're going way on past,
[53:48] man. Genesis 1 went, "Wow." Okay, we're
[53:52] still going all the way back. Brother
[53:54] Brandham said to that fountain, that
[53:56] fountain that was back there and out of
[53:58] that fountain was love and life and joy
[54:02] and peace and it flowed down. And that
[54:04] fountain desired a family. That fountain
[54:07] desired a kingdom. That fountain began
[54:09] to speak. Hallelujah.
[54:13] Oh my.
[54:15] So, so we find that, you know, we you
[54:19] you have all of these stories. My
[54:20] goodness. You can go to ma Matthew, you
[54:23] know, uh 26, I think, where the woman
[54:27] from there in Bethany where she went and
[54:31] bought the most expensive oil and she
[54:34] come in and she broke it and began to
[54:36] anoint his feet. And there's Judas
[54:39] holding the money bag, greedy guy that
[54:41] he was, make believer. Unbelievers are
[54:44] never the problem in a church.
[54:46] Amen.
[54:46] Cuz unbelievers are just honest. They
[54:48] just
[54:48] they're just an unbeliever. They like
[54:50] church. They like the singing. They like
[54:51] you. They like coming among us. They're
[54:53] decent. They're polite. They're
[54:54] respectful. They're an unbeliever. We
[54:56] let them come. I mean, I'd rather them
[54:58] be close to the fountain.
[55:00] Maybe the Holy Spirit will get them to
[55:01] take a drink.
[55:03] See,
[55:04] it's the make believer that's always the
[55:06] problem. See?
[55:07] And so, you know, because they they look
[55:10] like a believer when they're actually
[55:12] not.
[55:13] And and here's Judas saying, "Oh, wow.
[55:16] This is a terrible waste of money. This
[55:18] should have been given to the poor.
[55:20] Trying to give it to his own pockets is
[55:22] what he was trying to do.
[55:24] But Jesus actually said, "For in that
[55:27] she hath poured this ointment on my
[55:29] body, she did it for my burial. Verily,
[55:31] I say unto you, wheresoever this gospel
[55:34] shall be preached in the whole world.
[55:36] There shall also this that this woman
[55:38] hath done, be told for a memorial of
[55:40] her." I tell you something, friends,
[55:43] don't don't let the devil tell you
[55:45] you're a nobody. There's a there's a
[55:47] hall of fame. There's a God has a book
[55:49] of remembrance. And someday on the other
[55:52] side there's going to be a record. There
[55:54] was a Leoian bride. And it looked
[55:56] impossible. And no one thought she could
[55:58] survive. And how did you get through
[56:00] that darkness? We just kept we just kept
[56:02] marching to Zion. We just kept believing
[56:04] the word. We just kept accepting. Thus
[56:06] sayeth the Lord. I don't even know how I
[56:08] did it myself, but here I am. And how I
[56:10] got here, just his grace.
[56:14] Grace. Jesus led me all the way.
[56:17] Hallelujah.
[56:20] See, so so he has revealed then you know
[56:24] uh he's revealed this the seventh seal
[56:27] in the lives of the people in the Bible.
[56:29] Brother Brandham talks about that that
[56:31] coming. He hasn't revealed it. It's a
[56:32] secret. He says but he and turns right
[56:34] around says he has revealed it in the
[56:36] lives of the people that lived. So you
[56:38] are a living you are you are the living
[56:41] word as you live it. See, and a and a
[56:44] thing that's mysterious to the world,
[56:46] you're you're actually living it.
[56:50] You're the embodiment of it. You're the
[56:51] embodiment. It's no longer a mystery.
[56:53] You're standing here.
[56:54] See,
[56:56] and so so then so then we find that, you
[56:59] know, we have the episode of of Brother
[57:01] Brandham telling all these things. And
[57:02] so the more dedication, the more we
[57:04] surrender, uh the more involvement we
[57:07] can have with his kingdom, you know, uh
[57:11] I I just hope that that's the real
[57:13] lesson that you absorb in this series
[57:16] that the more dedication and surrender,
[57:18] the more involvement that we we can
[57:20] have, it will be those people who are
[57:25] willing to live. Brother Brandham said
[57:26] that anybody willing to live in those
[57:29] spheres with God,
[57:31] those spheres, those upper realms, who
[57:34] will live his life in dedication to the
[57:36] Lord and live up there in those realms,
[57:38] that's the one who will operate the
[57:40] third pool. That's the one who'll do
[57:41] great exploits. The ones that know their
[57:44] God.
[57:46] See,
[57:47] so th this is why we started a Thursday
[57:49] night men's prayer meeting because we're
[57:50] trying to know him more. Oh, they used
[57:52] to sing a song. We used to have a trio
[57:55] of brothers. I think Chris, you were in
[57:56] it. And they used to sing that song
[57:58] Brother Paula Fontaine sings. Oh, I want
[58:02] to know you more. Deep inside my heart,
[58:06] I want to know you. Oh, I want to know
[58:09] you. To feel your heart and know your
[58:12] mind. You sing that, Josh? Man, we might
[58:15] get you to give us that at the end. But
[58:20] so that's the real lesson.
[58:22] The more we experience involvement with
[58:24] that supernatural world, that's when
[58:27] we'll see angels.
[58:30] Yeah.
[58:30] Make no mistake, that's when we'll see
[58:32] angels.
[58:34] You know, one of these mornings,
[58:35] friends, we're going to see more than
[58:37] angels.
[58:38] [Music]
[58:40] One of these mornings, very soon, we're
[58:43] going to see more than angels.
[58:46] You know the
[58:48] Daniel talks about how that men will do
[58:51] wickedly against the covenant. They
[58:54] shall corrupt by flatteries. This is the
[58:55] antichrist spirit. But that's this is
[58:58] where this verse is. We keep quoting
[58:59] Daniel 11:32. But the people that do
[59:03] know their God shall be strong.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:07] And do great exploits.
[59:11] You want to be that part today? Amen.
[59:14] Well, I didn't get finished, but let's
[59:15] stand. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well,
[59:19] maybe part seven is proper. I don't
[59:21] know.
[59:23] I was trying that, but the Lord knows.
[59:26] Praise God. You love him.
[59:29] Amen. I I'm looking at my material and I
[59:32] can't do what I did last Sunday. Man, I
[59:34] went into almost triple overtime last
[59:36] Sunday. And so, uh I have to be careful.
[59:40] I don't get that kind of reputation.
[59:44] one another.
[59:46] I hope that you really see I I I guess
[59:48] if if I could sum up today is to say it
[59:52] like this that don't be unaware of the
[59:56] day and hour that you live in. Don't
[59:59] imagine this is just life as usual. Once
[1:00:02] the seven sealed mystery was opened,
[1:00:05] there was no more such thing as life as
[1:00:08] usual because that was a that was a
[1:00:11] harbinger of so many things. That was
[1:00:14] the time that God had promised that he
[1:00:16] would reveal himself at the end time.
[1:00:18] And when he did, he would reveal a bride
[1:00:20] as well. This is the real beauty under
[1:00:23] the seventh seal that it didn't just
[1:00:25] reveal it. It's not just the mighty God
[1:00:27] unveiled. It's Mr. and Mrs. Jesus
[1:00:30] Christ. See, and therefore once you get
[1:00:33] that, then it shouldn't seem strange to
[1:00:35] you. It shouldn't seem strange to you if
[1:00:38] the Lord wants to finish out his will
[1:00:42] through your life.
[1:00:45] See, Jesus came here and walked the
[1:00:48] earth and lived out a portion of the
[1:00:51] word, but he didn't even he didn't he
[1:00:54] didn't live out everything. He didn't
[1:00:55] even finish suffering
[1:00:58] even. He left a measure of that for his
[1:00:59] church. Paul said that. Paul said, "I
[1:01:01] make up in my body the sufferings of the
[1:01:03] Lord." See, I'm finishing the tally.
[1:01:06] And and the and the whole church was
[1:01:07] like that all down through the ages. And
[1:01:09] he promised that at the end time, he
[1:01:11] would come. Remember his feet. You look
[1:01:15] go read your Bible. His feet don't come
[1:01:17] back and touch this earth again
[1:01:19] until he comes back with his bride.
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:23] So you say, "Well then, is he here?" He
[1:01:26] certainly is. And you and you and you.
[1:01:29] You. Amen.
[1:01:30] Me and all of us. And that's that's the
[1:01:34] real purpose of why the word was open in
[1:01:37] this day. As I've said to you so many
[1:01:39] times before,
[1:01:41] he didn't bring the message to us to
[1:01:43] give us better theology than the
[1:01:46] Catholics or the Presbyterians or the
[1:01:48] Baptist or the Episcopals. That that's
[1:01:49] that's not even the point. The point is
[1:01:52] he came to have people who are willing
[1:01:55] to become the living word.
[1:01:58] See, when you're the living word, that's
[1:02:00] that's an end that's an end to all
[1:02:01] argument then because it's a
[1:02:03] manifestation. The world cannot on the
[1:02:06] day of judgment that I mean, you go go
[1:02:10] into the book of Revelation and go to
[1:02:11] the judgment bar and you go to Matthew
[1:02:13] 25. Doesn't matter where you go, you
[1:02:16] don't find people once this once it's
[1:02:19] over and the trial is over and
[1:02:20] everybody's got their in in their
[1:02:22] position, you don't find anybody crying
[1:02:25] foul.
[1:02:26] Amen.
[1:02:27] You don't find anybody marching with
[1:02:29] signs about injustice. They just bow
[1:02:31] their head and go to their fate because
[1:02:34] how can they argue? The bride is with
[1:02:37] him on the throne.
[1:02:39] Oh, you think my word couldn't do it?
[1:02:41] Well, how did I how did I get this?
[1:02:44] You know, you want you wanted to be
[1:02:45] here. I sent a word for you to do it.
[1:02:46] You didn't take it. How do you expect to
[1:02:48] get here if you don't take the word
[1:02:49] there?
[1:02:49] Amen.
[1:02:50] See? Amen.
[1:02:52] So, that's what it's about, friend.
[1:02:53] Let's pray. Father,
[1:02:56] we love you today, Lord. And I'm I
[1:02:59] apologize if that's necessary. I don't
[1:03:02] even feel in my heart it is because I I
[1:03:05] followed your leadership the whole way.
[1:03:07] I didn't get to where I wanted to get
[1:03:08] to, but that's just in your hands, Lord.
[1:03:11] And so I I I I'm sorry if I took too
[1:03:14] long and took time, but it feels in my
[1:03:16] heart that you've given me permission
[1:03:19] just to pause right here, and we'll pick
[1:03:21] it back up next time. And Lord, I thank
[1:03:23] you for these people. Thank you for our
[1:03:25] visitors. We continue to ask you to
[1:03:28] remember our sick among us and remember
[1:03:29] our needs that we read at the beginning.
[1:03:31] Remember our ministry team uh deployed
[1:03:34] ministering, Lord, in other places. I
[1:03:36] pray that you'll help us now, Lord, as
[1:03:38] we come now to to the conclusion of this
[1:03:40] service. We just want to lift up some
[1:03:42] praise to you, Lord. Want to lift up
[1:03:44] holy hands and let you know how grateful
[1:03:46] we are. And father, I pray today
[1:03:50] that maybe there was enough words said
[1:03:53] to prick a heart that would bring a
[1:03:56] challenge. There might be people in here
[1:03:59] in this audience today, Lord, in an
[1:04:01] audience of this size. There no doubt
[1:04:02] would be some who would be honest
[1:04:05] enough, Lord, and say, you know, look, I
[1:04:08] am a believer for real. No, honestly, I
[1:04:10] am. I really am a I really am a
[1:04:12] believer, but I know I'm I know I'm not
[1:04:15] at that dedicated level I need to be. I
[1:04:18] know I need more of God. I need more of
[1:04:20] him. How many want to raise a hand? I'll
[1:04:22] raise up both of mine. Say, "Lord, oh, I
[1:04:24] want to know you more. I want to know
[1:04:27] you in the power of your resurrection,
[1:04:29] Lord." That's what we're That's what
[1:04:31] this whole series is about. It's not to
[1:04:33] teach us how to go out here and start
[1:04:35] speaking things. It's to It's to bring
[1:04:38] us to an altar. It's to bring us to
[1:04:40] rededication, Lord. It's to bring us,
[1:04:43] Father, to deep, deep sincerity and
[1:04:45] consecration before you. I pray you'll
[1:04:47] grant it to us, Lord. Let that be the
[1:04:50] real lesson that's learned here, Master.
[1:04:53] We commit it all to you now. We love
[1:04:55] you. We thank you for your word, Lord.
[1:04:57] We're believers. We are believers of
[1:04:59] your word. And I pray that every hand
[1:05:02] over an honest heart that was raised,
[1:05:05] you'll meet that in Jesus' name. Come
[1:05:08] on, Brother Josh, and help us sing it.
[1:05:09] Brother Kenny, you going to sing it?
[1:05:10] All I know is a chorus.
[1:05:12] Oh, sing the chorus, and brother Josh
[1:05:13] will jump in with you.
[1:05:17] Oh, I want to know.
[1:05:20] I want to know you
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:25] within my soul. I want to know you.
[1:05:30] Oh, I want to know you. Feeling
[1:05:41] in your eyes
[1:05:46] Christ
[1:05:47] and say I want you know
[1:05:53] you.
[1:05:55] Oh I want to know you.
[1:06:00] Sing it again now. Oh I want to know.
[1:06:03] Oh,
[1:06:05] I want to know you Lord.
[1:06:07] Hallelujah Lord. Deep within my soul I
[1:06:13] Hallelujah Jesus.
[1:06:16] Oh let's worship him. He's worthy of it.
[1:06:28] Stirs up within me.
[1:06:32] I say I want to know you
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:42] want to know you
[1:06:46] deep
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:54] to feel
[1:06:58] and know your mind your Lord looking in
[1:07:03] your eyes are within me.
[1:07:08] Cries that say I want to know
[1:07:14] you.
[1:07:16] Oh I want to know you more.
[1:07:22] Just keep playing it for me. Bow your
[1:07:24] heads with me again. I just want to
[1:07:26] follow the mind of Christ here.
[1:07:30] Sometimes we just run out the door. We
[1:07:33] don't give the Holy Spirit enough time.
[1:07:36] The whole purpose of the gospel,
[1:07:38] friends, is to bring people into a
[1:07:41] loving,
[1:07:43] revelated relationship
[1:07:45] with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:07:48] Is there anyone here today you say,
[1:07:51] "Preacher, I I want to know him more.
[1:07:56] I want to know him." Maybe maybe you're
[1:07:58] here and you want to know him for the
[1:07:59] first time. Maybe you're honest enough
[1:08:00] to know. You say, "I thought I knew him
[1:08:03] till I heard this today and I realized
[1:08:05] that there's more of him to be known and
[1:08:07] I want to know it." Maybe there's some
[1:08:10] here today been believers for a long
[1:08:12] time. You read about these things and
[1:08:14] they excite us and they thrill us and we
[1:08:16] hear these stories.
[1:08:19] We wonder that we're still here and all
[1:08:21] these years later, what's it all about,
[1:08:23] Lord? And maybe the only thing that's
[1:08:25] missing in our lives, maybe you'd be
[1:08:28] honest enough and say, "I know it,
[1:08:30] Brother Jason. The only thing missing in
[1:08:33] my life, I'm a believer, but the one
[1:08:35] thing missing is that deeper walk with
[1:08:38] God, that closer walk, that daily walk,
[1:08:42] that daily dedication where I'm willing
[1:08:45] to move out. I'm willing to be loosed.
[1:08:47] I'm willing to have things that aren't
[1:08:49] supposed to be hanging on me. I want to
[1:08:52] be delivered of them today with every
[1:08:55] head bowed. Has anybody today got
[1:08:56] something you say, Lord, I want to be
[1:08:58] loosed from that. I don't want that on
[1:09:00] my life. Hands going up everywhere. Say,
[1:09:02] Lord, I don't want that in my life. I
[1:09:04] want to be free, Lord God. I want to be
[1:09:06] free in the spirit. My, that's honest,
[1:09:08] friends. That's honest heart. Don't
[1:09:10] think God doesn't see that. He does. He
[1:09:12] sees that. Say, Lord, let the word of
[1:09:15] God set me at liberty today, Lord God.
[1:09:17] Raise up hands everywhere, friends.
[1:09:19] Let's pray. Master. Oh, let the freedom
[1:09:22] of the Holy Spirit come today. Let there
[1:09:24] be lives, Lord God, who are purged a new
[1:09:27] and purged aresh. Some who may have only
[1:09:30] knowing you for the real first time in
[1:09:31] their old life. They've heard about it.
[1:09:33] They may have been raised in it. Maybe
[1:09:35] they've longed to know you. But today,
[1:09:37] you could make yourself known today,
[1:09:39] more than any other day in their life.
[1:09:41] They could really get it. They could
[1:09:42] really understand the purpose of God in
[1:09:45] redemption. Understand that they're a
[1:09:47] part of that great plan. I pray you'll
[1:09:50] make it real to us today, Lord. Oh, only
[1:09:53] you can. Only you can. We commit it to
[1:09:56] you now. Father, I commit these into
[1:09:59] your hands. Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:10:06] Sing it now.
[1:10:08] Oh, I want to know you more. Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] Deeper in my soul. I want to know. Yes,
[1:10:19] Lord. I want to know you.
[1:10:25] Give my final away
[1:10:29] to know you in your death and
[1:10:32] resurrection.
[1:10:36] Oh, I want to know you.
[1:10:43] Oh. Oh. I want to know you more
[1:10:49] deep into my soul. I want to know.
[1:10:54] Yes. God bless you saints. God bless you
[1:10:57] in Jesus name.
[1:11:00] Hallelujah.
[1:11:03] Oh my. You can be dismissed in Jesus
[1:11:05] name. God bless you. Hallelujah. Sing it
[1:11:08] my brother.
[1:11:12] I want you.
