[0:00] flying just under the wire today all
[0:02] right let's uh stand and have a word of
[0:04] prayer you don't
[0:08] mind dear gracious
[0:12] father Lord we come before you this
[0:15] morning hoping that to hear from you
[0:17] Lord that father I believe you put this
[0:21] thought on my
[0:22] heart a week ago Lord and I'm asking now
[0:26] that you would help
[0:28] me to step out of the way way that with
[0:31] your help that you could express this
[0:34] thought to the people in the way that it
[0:37] was expressed to me and that father
[0:39] that they would gain something from it
[0:43] they could be edified and and grow and
[0:45] be encouraged
[0:47] Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord
[0:49] Jesus Christ amen um while yall are
[0:52] standing we'll go ahead and
[0:55] read
[0:57] okay um we're going to go ahead and turn
[0:59] to Genesis chapter
[1:00] 1 um and
[1:04] verse
[1:14] 26 it says Genesis 1 and verse 26 and um
[1:20] God said let us make man in our image
[1:23] after our likeness and let them have
[1:25] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:26] over the foul of the air and over the
[1:28] cattle and over all the Earth Earth and
[1:30] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:31] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[1:34] own image in the image of God created he
[1:38] him male and female created he them and
[1:40] God blessed them and God said unto them
[1:42] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[1:44] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[1:46] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:49] fowl of the air and over every living
[1:50] thing that moveth upon the Earth y all
[1:53] can be
[1:54] seated um so if I go ahead and get my
[1:58] point up
[2:00] there it
[2:01] is um so I give you a little bit of
[2:05] background on this um well first I'm
[2:07] just going to read this quote um this is
[2:09] from marriage and divorce and it says
[2:10] remember Adam was both masculine and
[2:12] feminist in the original creation um one
[2:15] but then he was separated by a rib
[2:17] notice but a byproduct and notice the
[2:19] only one of all God's creation of every
[2:22] animal and every she was the only one
[2:24] designed this way every other female was
[2:26] in the original creation every other
[2:27] female was in the original creation but
[2:30] Eve was not in the original creation see
[2:32] that had to be made that way we'll get
[2:36] to it after a while notice in this
[2:38] creation that she was not in the
[2:40] original but a byproduct and in this
[2:43] creation um now I don't want to hurt
[2:45] your feelings but I want to tell you the
[2:47] truth and you just sit still you're
[2:49] doing nice
[2:51] okay
[2:53] now this quote uh if we go back to that
[2:59] oh did I do I have control over it no
[3:02] okay so this
[3:05] quote has bothered so many people okay
[3:10] it bothered me for years because what we
[3:13] do is we read the red part right where
[3:17] we read the whole quote we get to the
[3:18] red part and it says she's not in the
[3:20] original but a byproduct and that's all
[3:22] we
[3:23] hear right because it it it seems
[3:28] unpleasant somehow that the woman is
[3:30] some byproduct some secondary thing some
[3:35] afterthought that wasn't in the original
[3:37] creation
[3:40] right and this bugged me for a long time
[3:43] and then one day about this would have
[3:46] been trying to remember the exact time
[3:49] it would have either been very late in
[3:50] 2019 or sometime in 2020 I was working
[3:54] with Travis doing AC work and I can tell
[3:56] you exactly where we were we were in I95
[3:58] going north to Columbia and we were
[4:00] listening to marriage and divorce in the
[4:01] truck and I heard this quote brother
[4:03] brandom said it and it was like a light
[4:05] bulb went off in my head and I went wow
[4:08] this is beautiful and I and and
[4:11] everybody gets hung up on this and it's
[4:12] and it's not it shouldn't be like this
[4:16] is it's it's not something to be upset
[4:19] about because and and you know I it
[4:22] occurred to me and it just popped in my
[4:24] head and then I you know you try to
[4:25] explain it to people and it never really
[4:29] sticked
[4:30] like you you have a hard time explaining
[4:31] it to people the way it kind of occurred
[4:32] to you um if I could hit that next
[4:36] slide um so well let me let me finish on
[4:40] with my explanation a little bit because
[4:41] I had always had a hard time explaining
[4:43] it to people never really landed with
[4:45] people the way I was hoping to the way
[4:48] like I could tell like I'd explain it
[4:49] and just never like okay that's nice but
[4:51] they never really get it the way I got
[4:53] it and then last Sunday brother JD is
[4:56] doing his Sunday school and he read that
[4:58] same quote and it was like it hit me
[5:00] again and this time I knew exactly how
[5:02] to explain it to people
[5:05] hopefully so this is my original
[5:08] explanation that never really stuck with
[5:10] people I'm sure y'all can understand why
[5:13] um so and I know it's I know it seems a
[5:16] lot more complicated oh B basically you
[5:18] just got to be able to see the colors um
[5:21] this is obviously a a a very it's a this
[5:25] is a actually um pictures out of a
[5:27] organic chemistry textbook I had laying
[5:29] around the house um but the main thing
[5:31] is I just want you to see the see the
[5:33] colors right because everything in the
[5:36] top leftand corner you see that that's
[5:38] chemicals in a reaction and then it goes
[5:40] to the right the arrows to the other
[5:42] side of the arrows it's gone through the
[5:43] reaction and it's a two stage stage
[5:45] reaction and then you go down to the
[5:46] bottom left and then across okay and and
[5:49] the bottom right hand corner is the
[5:50] finished total reaction okay now I put
[5:54] colors and I highlighted everything with
[5:55] colors so you can see everything in the
[5:59] end that is marked products and
[6:02] byproducts was in the original mix there
[6:06] was nothing in there that wasn't in
[6:08] there in the original and there's
[6:10] nothing
[6:11] missing right every so when brother
[6:15] brandham calls Eve a byproduct he's not
[6:17] calling her an afterthought because when
[6:20] a chemist makes a does a synthesis of a
[6:22] chemical he knows what byproducts are
[6:24] going to come out of that if he's worth
[6:26] ass Sal at all right kemist who don't
[6:30] understand their byproducts blow
[6:31] themselves
[6:32] up
[6:34] um God knew what was going to happen to
[6:38] say that Eve was an that's not true and
[6:40] by the way when people hear the word
[6:42] byproduct what we hear in our brain that
[6:45] you know we hear the word byproduct but
[6:47] what our brain tells us is waste
[6:49] product that's not the same thing okay
[6:53] I'll give you a really good example back
[6:55] in the late
[6:56] 1800s um whales were hunted to near
[6:59] extinction because the fat was rendered
[7:01] down to use for lighting and cooking
[7:04] right well the whales almost died they
[7:06] didn't have any more whales so they had
[7:08] to come up with something else so some
[7:09] guys found this this black goo coming
[7:12] out of the ground and they figured out
[7:13] if you boil it you can you can drain off
[7:15] a chemical called kerosene and kerosene
[7:17] became the number one lighting chemical
[7:20] like it's what was used in replacement
[7:22] for whale oil well in the process of
[7:23] that they had this other byproduct that
[7:25] they didn't know exactly what to do with
[7:27] um that was really really volatile and
[7:29] it burned way too hot and you couldn't
[7:30] use it for lighting and it was really
[7:33] like had a lot of really nauseous fumes
[7:34] that came off of it and a lot of times
[7:36] they just dumped it in the river and
[7:37] that was called
[7:39] gasoline okay and so in modern times
[7:43] kerosene is an afterthought who uses
[7:46] kerosene basically nobody but that
[7:50] byproduct right gasoline people fight
[7:53] Wars over that stuff right so don't get
[7:58] hung up on the word by
[7:59] product right um You could also use the
[8:03] term secondary product that's also just
[8:06] as relative of a term in chemistry it's
[8:09] it is another product that is inevitable
[8:11] with this with what's happening
[8:13] here it is a it is part of the original
[8:17] creation it's not an afterthought
[8:20] am um and so that was that was kind of
[8:24] the original take on this now if I could
[8:26] jump back to that first slide
[8:30] the part that hit me last week that I
[8:34] never quite I and I knew this it just I
[8:37] didn't know how to say it just right is
[8:39] the part in blue right says and notice
[8:43] the only one of all God's creation of
[8:45] every animal and everything else she was
[8:47] the only one designed this way every
[8:50] other female was in the original
[8:52] creation every other female was in the
[8:54] original creation but Eve was not in the
[8:56] original creation she had to be made
[8:58] that way we'll get to it after a while
[9:01] okay the fact that Eve is a byproduct is
[9:06] special it's Unique it is required in
[9:10] order for her to be made in the image of
[9:12] God okay if she's not a byproduct she's
[9:16] not in the image of
[9:18] God
[9:20] okay because God said let us make man in
[9:23] our image male and female created he
[9:25] them right she was special and God did
[9:29] that on purpose right it was all part of
[9:32] the
[9:33] plan
[9:35] why why did she have to be made it be
[9:38] part of Adam as a byproduct as a rib as
[9:41] part of Adam and extracted out of him
[9:44] because Adam was made in the image of
[9:46] God and their entire relationship was a
[9:49] mirror of God and the
[9:51] church the church came out of God and
[9:56] God before the foundation of the world
[9:58] the lamb was slain and by the way if the
[10:00] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[10:02] the world why was a lamb slain if there
[10:04] was nothing to
[10:05] redeem right if the lamb was slain
[10:07] before the foundation of the world the
[10:08] church had to be there in order to be
[10:11] redeemed okay so
[10:14] now Adam and Eve have to match that
[10:18] that's their purpose they're if they're
[10:20] in the image of God then they have to
[10:22] mirror the lamb slain before the
[10:24] foundation of the world and the purchase
[10:25] of the
[10:26] blood right so in order for that to
[10:30] happen Adam has to literally be a a
[10:33] photocopy of God in which he is formed
[10:36] alone and then his sweetheart manifests
[10:39] out of him
[10:42] okay what the problem is when
[10:47] people have a it's so sad that that the
[10:53] modern feminist you know I started a 100
[10:55] years ago so it's not even that modern
[10:57] over a hundred years ago
[11:00] that people have said like made this
[11:02] idea that you know
[11:04] um of feminism and and and women's
[11:07] Liberation and all this stuff and and on
[11:09] its face it sounds so nice and so lovely
[11:11] but don't forget what it's doing is it's
[11:13] it's driving this wedge into the plan of
[11:17] God which is that the woman comes out of
[11:19] the man and if you you know people get
[11:23] hung up on this oh well she was just
[11:24] afterthought so now she has to listen to
[11:26] the man and and she has to be a
[11:27] subservient to the man
[11:29] yeah but it's a pattern of of God in the
[11:31] church
[11:33] so does the church tell God what to do
[11:37] does the church rule over God does the
[11:39] church take leadership in the
[11:41] relationship with God is does God
[11:43] conform to the vision of the church no
[11:47] obviously
[11:48] not and we don't complain about that we
[11:52] don't say oh we're so oppressed poor
[11:54] Christians because we have to conform to
[11:56] the word of God us poor poor poor put
[12:00] upon enslaved Christians you
[12:02] know no we we do it and so if a marriage
[12:07] is done
[12:09] correctly then a man will love a woman
[12:12] the way Christ loves the church and she
[12:14] will be able to submit to him as as the
[12:17] church submits to
[12:20] Christ if you know
[12:22] so I don't I I lost my train at where
[12:24] was I going with
[12:26] this um
[12:29] anyways so people get get you know they
[12:33] they they push out this thing well I
[12:35] don't want to be a I don't want to just
[12:36] be a
[12:37] byproduct well when people don't want to
[12:39] be a bride product what they don't on
[12:41] its face it sounds like a problem with
[12:43] headship in reality it's a problem with
[12:46] Redemption because Redemption speaks of
[12:50] origin right what is the what is the
[12:52] patter the the the the example that is
[12:55] always given of redemption right the man
[12:56] goes to the pawn shop he gives the pawn
[12:58] shop owners something to hold of his he
[13:00] comes back later with money and redeems
[13:02] it back from the pawn shop it he
[13:04] couldn't have redeemed it if it wasn't
[13:06] his in the first place when Adam when
[13:10] when Eve uh Falls with the serpent it is
[13:14] technically in Adam's Power to just say
[13:18] God I'm through with her wipe her off
[13:20] the face of the Earth and make me a new
[13:23] one okay but he couldn't do it because
[13:27] she was part of him
[13:30] like it's in it's conceptually in in
[13:32] your power to go hack your hand off with
[13:34] a meat cleaver and throw in a wood
[13:35] chipper no one's going to do that you
[13:38] can't do it it that's that's like that's
[13:40] like repulsive to even think about but
[13:44] anymore than than Adam could let this
[13:46] woman that he cared about be destroyed
[13:49] she was his rib she was part of him it
[13:52] was it I mean he was willing to destroy
[13:54] himself it's the Bible says that by one
[13:56] man all of uh that that the World fell
[13:59] one man Adam was the one who sinned cuz
[14:02] he knew exactly what he was doing and he
[14:05] did it knowing full well I'm going to be
[14:07] destroyed for this and I'm going to do
[14:09] it anyways because I would rather be
[14:12] wiped out and burn the Garden of Eden to
[14:14] the ground than watch that woman
[14:18] die sir that's what being a byproduct
[14:21] means if she wasn't part of him then
[14:24] there then he could have just said fine
[14:25] get rid of her if she just came out of
[14:27] the ground with Adam like all the other
[14:29] animals if she would have been just like
[14:32] when people say well women shouldn't be
[14:33] considered a byproduct what they're
[14:35] saying is women should be considered
[14:36] like all the other
[14:38] animals can you can you advance forward
[14:40] for a little bit go Advance forward
[14:45] to one rooster many
[14:49] hens Advance please there's a one bull
[14:53] elk and a bunch of
[14:55] cows okay one more time please there's a
[14:59] male lion and a bunch of
[15:02] lionesses those are all animals in which
[15:05] the females were in the original
[15:09] creation and what does it produce it
[15:12] produces if you will advance one more
[15:15] Isaiah 4:1 and in that day seven women
[15:18] shall take hold of one man saying we
[15:20] will eat our own bread we will wear our
[15:21] own apparel and let us be called by thy
[15:23] name to take away our reproach that is
[15:25] what it produces when you don't want to
[15:27] be considered a
[15:30] byproduct it produces the
[15:33] modern man some of y'all older people
[15:36] are not gonna understand this younger
[15:38] people you are going to get
[15:41] this modern the modern secular
[15:44] non-Christian dating Market is a bunch
[15:46] of women chasing after 20% of a bunch of
[15:49] very handsome wealthy
[15:51] dudes who do not see them as anything
[15:54] more than a a sex object to be included
[15:57] into a Harum
[15:59] okay that's what the modern dating
[16:01] Market is and that's what Isaiah
[16:04] predicted and that is a result of
[16:09] people right okay then you get to be
[16:12] congratulations you get to be co-equal
[16:14] you could be just the same as the man
[16:16] and you will get treated as such if you
[16:18] don't want to be special if you don't
[16:20] want to be the byproduct of a man that
[16:23] means you don't want to be in the image
[16:24] of God and you want to be just like all
[16:26] the other animals
[16:33] it's the byproduct is for your
[16:37] protection it's because if she wasn't a
[16:39] byproduct she would have been burnt with
[16:41] the serpent she'd have been poof gone
[16:45] right it's because if she's his
[16:47] byproduct she's part of his heart he's
[16:50] willing to die for her he's willing to
[16:53] do anything he's willing to burn the
[16:55] whole world down for her he's W look
[16:58] Christ is willing to go to a condescend
[17:02] and and put aside the the Comforts of
[17:05] heaven and descend to Earth and take up
[17:08] a robe of Flesh and be be humiliated and
[17:12] and and and and live on the side of a
[17:14] road he willing to be homeless and and
[17:17] put upon and destitute just so his Grand
[17:21] Finale could be tortured to
[17:24] death like maimed and beaten and and and
[17:28] tortured
[17:29] and and publicly
[17:32] humiliated like the crucifixion was not
[17:34] just like oh we're going to nail you to
[17:36] a cross no it was it was like a whole
[17:38] process they made a whole day of it like
[17:41] it was it was like a a big to-do like
[17:43] they they beat them and then they
[17:45] specifically engineered the cross to be
[17:47] like the most uncomfortable awkward
[17:49] thing to carry that would cover you in
[17:50] splinters when you carried it and then
[17:52] they made the convicted carry the means
[17:54] of their own
[17:56] demise like that was all part of the
[17:58] thing and Christ knew all this going
[18:00] into it and he's like yep that's where
[18:01] I'm going I'm going go do that and then
[18:04] when he gets there and and it's
[18:05] happening you know at any moment you
[18:07] would talk about oh he could have just
[18:08] spoken and summoned a legion of angels
[18:10] to just wipe them all out and or he
[18:12] could have just spoke himself to Heaven
[18:14] yeah that's true I mean if he was a
[18:15] vengeful man he could have spoken a
[18:17] legion of angels to crucify everyone
[18:18] who's crucifying
[18:20] him right or or better yet
[18:25] huh he could have just been like well I
[18:28] know I have to go through with this but
[18:29] I mean I can at least speak myself some
[18:32] painkiller right he could have at least
[18:35] deadened his own nerves if he wanted to
[18:38] he had that power and he said nope I'm
[18:39] going to feel every ounce of this I'm
[18:42] going to feel every pain I'm going to
[18:44] feel every ache I'm going to because
[18:45] it's it's necessary it's required and
[18:48] why was he doing it because he loved the
[18:51] people who were doing it to
[18:53] him don't forget that when they hung him
[18:55] up there he said father forgive them
[18:57] they don't know what they're doing
[18:59] they don't they don't get it when on in
[19:02] Acts chapter 2 when when when Peter is
[19:05] preaching on the day of Pentecost he
[19:07] tells the Jews that it was Christ that
[19:10] you crucified there were people in that
[19:12] crowd who said crucify him there were
[19:15] people in that crowd who called for
[19:16] Barabas to be released and they got the
[19:19] Holy
[19:21] Ghost Christ died for
[19:24] them and
[19:27] that's when look when Adam ran to Eve
[19:31] and said I will die before I let her be
[19:33] destroyed don't forget that she was only
[19:35] going to be destroyed because she
[19:37] cheated on
[19:39] him
[19:40] like I mean let's this is talk about a a
[19:45] man that is going to to you know people
[19:47] I think the reason why women are so
[19:49] afraid of of
[19:53] um women are so afraid of of this this
[19:57] idea of being subservient to a man is
[19:59] because we've heard so many horror
[20:01] stories of of women being you know
[20:04] conned and and and you know get left
[20:07] after 10 years of marriage with three
[20:08] kids destitute as the some snake in the
[20:10] grass slithers back into the weeds that
[20:12] he came from you know I mean yeah that's
[20:15] that's hideous that's that's
[20:20] horrifying I mean the only solution is
[20:22] to make sure that the man that you're
[20:26] marrying is the kind of man who's
[20:29] not going to walk away who would who
[20:32] would rather hack off his own hands
[20:34] before he loses you before he before
[20:37] you're not in his life anymore and the
[20:39] only way a man is ever going to live up
[20:41] to
[20:43] that is if he's living up to the
[20:45] standard of Christ yes right the only
[20:48] way that a woman can genuinely be rest
[20:52] assured that the man that she is
[20:54] committing herself to is worth all of
[20:58] this worth the
[21:00] risk is that there's really only one man
[21:03] who's ever been worth it right that's
[21:06] the reality Christ is the only one who's
[21:09] ever actually lived up to the standard
[21:13] and you might think well how is that
[21:16] going to work right how can a woman have
[21:19] any Assurance well
[21:21] because before Christ left he said I'll
[21:25] be with you even in you on the day of
[21:27] Pentecost that same Christ who went to
[21:29] the Cross who is willing to sacrifice
[21:32] himself for a Humanity that hated
[21:35] him will dwell inside of a man and then
[21:39] women can be rest assured that that man
[21:43] is not going to treat them any worse
[21:45] than Christ would treat them amen that
[21:48] is the only option right that's how you
[21:51] can be rest assured that your marriage
[21:54] is going to be in the image of God
[21:57] that's the only possible way it doesn't
[22:00] work
[22:08] otherwise where was I
[22:11] at
[22:13] um and uh just as I'll I'll I'll kind of
[22:16] wrap up with this
[22:18] um you know the natural types the
[22:21] spiritual did I put that quote in
[22:24] my Advanced one yeah there we go that's
[22:26] probably hard to read um
[22:29] so it
[22:30] says no I don't see people here um but
[22:33] what's old enough to understand this and
[22:35] I got a mixed congregation this would be
[22:36] a doctor's talk and I'm your brother um
[22:39] so listen in the life the first thing in
[22:43] a baby when it's born a natural birth
[22:45] the first thing is water is that right
[22:46] blood then spirit it's got twitching of
[22:48] muscles but it's not um but not uh till
[22:52] it's born has it life but notice I mean
[22:55] breathing life for anybody who was
[22:58] confused used on the topic of abortion
[23:00] um you know what I mean now look so it
[23:04] is in the spiritual birth and I want I'm
[23:06] just going to skip down for the sake of
[23:08] time says notice justification by faith
[23:10] sanctification through the blood and the
[23:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost when a baby is
[23:14] born water blood and spirit when a
[23:16] baby's born newborn baby in heaven he
[23:19] comes through water blood and spirit the
[23:22] natural types the
[23:25] spiritual everything on Earth amen that
[23:28] was my first Bible to watch nature you
[23:30] get nature um typed up with God and you
[23:34] find out you got the same things I want
[23:37] to I underlined and bolded that the
[23:40] natural types and spiritual everything
[23:42] on
[23:44] Earth if a woman is kicking at the
[23:49] idea of or just anybody let's be real is
[23:53] kicking at the idea of a woman is a
[23:55] byproduct and that's
[23:57] rude the natural types the spiritual if
[24:01] you cannot wrap your head around that
[24:04] then that is 100% an indication of your
[24:08] spiritual relationship with God Amen if
[24:11] you cannot say Amen to every word of God
[24:14] you're going to have a problem okay even
[24:16] when it says something that doesn't
[24:18] really fit your taste okay amen
[24:24] so when this is so you can see this
[24:28] brother random talks about the the
[24:30] airplanes and and you know advancing for
[24:32] horse and buggy airplane you know
[24:33] automobile airplane rocket ship okay
[24:35] isn't it odd isn't it odd that in the
[24:39] era of the feminist movement is when the
[24:42] denominational Church typed as a woman
[24:44] would supersede the word of God and
[24:47] declare her word above God isn't it odd
[24:51] that when in the natural world when
[24:53] women start declaring themselves
[24:54] refusing to be seen as you know
[24:57] submissive to to a
[24:59] man that the that the church world would
[25:02] that is the era in which the word would
[25:04] be crucified AR
[25:06] fresh isn't that interesting and so if
[25:10] you think that we as Christians are just
[25:13] going to have a
[25:16] modernistic uh interpretation of what
[25:19] marriage is if we think that we're going
[25:21] to have a modern pattern our marriages
[25:23] and our homes after something other than
[25:26] the word of God and then expect that our
[25:29] relationship with God will remain
[25:31] intact I'm sorry but the natural types
[25:35] the spiritual and your natural Affairs
[25:39] absolutely are an indication of your
[25:41] affairs with God and and you you're
[25:44] you're gonna the wheels are going to
[25:45] come off of that
[25:47] thing
[25:48] anyways I am grossly out of
[25:54] time I better quit before I am in
[25:58] trouble so let's stand and have a word
[26:00] of
[26:06] prayer father Lord I Thank you for
[26:10] giving me this opportunity to speak my
[26:12] heart to these people and Lord that
[26:13] maybe through the foolishness of this
[26:16] that something would have been said that
[26:18] would encourage people and give people
[26:20] some sort
[26:25] of understanding that that people
[26:27] wouldn't be
[26:29] it wouldn't hurt so bad when they hear
[26:30] something they don't understand Lord
[26:32] that maybe some understanding could
[26:33] happen that they could take hold of it
[26:36] and and say Amen to it and that they
[26:38] would be able to understand it and see
[26:39] that Lord you've never said anything
[26:41] that was intended to hurt
[26:44] people so father we thank you for this
[26:48] and we we invite you into our midst into
[26:50] our service Lord be with us through the
[26:52] remainder of our service in the worship
[26:54] and in the in the ministering of the
[26:55] word Lord be with us father min minister
[26:58] to our hearts in the name of the Lord
[27:00] Jesus Christ amen
