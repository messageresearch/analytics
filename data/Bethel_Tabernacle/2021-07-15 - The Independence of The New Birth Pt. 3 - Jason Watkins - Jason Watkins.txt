to me even when it feels like i'm surrounded he never leaves you never leave my side lord amen god bless you greet you in the name of the lord tonight i want to thank brother matt for getting me out so quick um i asked for that if you're in case you're wondering why i want to invite you right to the book of revelation chapter 10 amen and we want to take our scripture and go right into the word of god i i want to preach the third and hopefully the final installment on the independence of the new birth and the independence that the new birth really brings and so i want to get it through that tonight and trust that the lord will help me to do it so i don't want to keep you late on a midweek so we wanted to get a few minutes on the front end amen i'll be uh going to visit sister lisa um saturday so uh brother matt will be here ministering brother jd uh the following wednesday i think or brother diggs maybe i don't remember somebody in the following wednesday sister debbie and i'll be back uh be gone from the 2 17 to 24 i think something like that so amen haven't gone up to see my my uh little sister amen amen and she is my older sister amen but she is my big sister too and so haven't been to see her in quite a while and uh so she she's probably watching right now so believe it or not we're coming lisa amen so been been a long time so looking forward to that amen revelation 10 one single verse and we'll let you be seated i want to read in the tenth chapter and the ninth verse and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey father we thank you for your word we commit ourselves into your hands just now i lord have expended this entire day lord just sitting before you since early hours lord and just making notes here notes there and adjusting as best i could hear your voice so i'm trusting you now to make it something valuable to the people help me now lord to deliver it as i received it i committed to you in jesus name god bless you friends as you're seated amen we'll come back to that verse momentarily i want to pick up 2 thessalonians chapter 2 and verses 7 through 12. for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness amen brother branham when he takes this verse uh in the 11th verse of 2 thessalonians 2. brother branham shows us how that that they should believe a lie and brother branham said more perfectly from the original text it's the lie it's the original lie he said it's actually the exact same lie that satan told eve in the garden of eden and brought the sad downfall of all humankind so the lie of course and i just want you to jump right in with me because we're going to cover a lot of ground and i'm going to have to go quickly but at the same time i want it to sink in so i got your full attention all right so this lie we're going to call it the lie the lie not a lie it's the lie it's the original lie and this lie takes many forms of sin that's one of the first points that i want to make to you it's not any specific sin it's a it's a misguided principle all right and so uh all of its forms no matter what form the lie comes in that all of its forms are all based on this one single false premise that applies across the board the lie is that reasoning god's word away will not cause you to right die all right that's the lie that reasoning god's word away will not cause you to die that's the lie so the type of transgression is not as relevant as the principle that covers all situations there is uh an atoning blood of christ for our transgressions but we realize that in a born-again believer there is no sin because sin is unbelief and i have already unbelieved the devil and i have believed the lord amen and therefore because that i have received the revealed word it brought a gene a gene of god that was inside of me my acceptance of his word brought that to life and i'm sealed unto the day of my redemption and therefore he that's born of god doth not commit sin for he cannot sin because the seed remains see he cannot sin however john goes on to say but if we do sin in other words if we do transgress we have an advocate with the father so we want to make that clear distinction between the unbelief of sin and and simple transgressions of the flesh but this the lie that that he says to that warns the church by that they for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe the lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth now why did they not believe the truth because they agreed to reason weigh the word of god amen and therefore god when they did that then god sends him a strong delusion to where they actually cease being hypocritical in it and actually believe the lie all right and so that they might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness denominations denominationalism and just to speak of one aspect denominations seem like a sensible and reasonable idea brother branham talks about that in the church age book the whole idea of you know gathering what we we believe and let's put it in writing and let's make a document let's get everybody to rally around it you know let's have a hierarchical order uh in the church of ministries and bishops and over that so that way we can keep everything correct and brother branham said it sounded reasonable but it was actually the seed of the roman catholic church so denominations may seem like a sensible and a reasonable idea until you find out by the original word that they are all broken cisterns and that they adopt names of blasphemy in fact they are themselves blasphemius or blasphemous names that lead to the mark of the beast now the b system take another step the b system of organized religion amen a product of the lie amen come on you have to help me the organized religion is a product of the lie amen it's a product of the lie and if followed it will have a person not only failing to recognize the truth of their hour but it will actually cause its followers to end up calling the truth itself a lie that's that's how that's how much power this lie has and people have abandoned what we held traditionally for hundreds of years to be the truth and taught in the word of god to be the truth and suddenly the world declares it all alive my wife was telling me about one of one of her cooking show ladies that you know looking at a certain aspect you know of a lie because something came into her family and one of her family members began practicing a perverted lifestyle and she she looks in the camera supposed to be a christian lady and says you know i heard all my life that that was wrong she said but that's a lie and i was stunned and i thought there is no end to the insanity of this world and that's why god god doesn't say i'm going to destroy them because i don't like them he said i'm going to destroy those who loved not the truth but who loved unrighteousness rather than the truth see so the lie then so so then you know i i i even even as i start out here i want to make a statement for clarity i think it's important uh a clarity of my purpose in this three-part series i have i i want to say that i have the same determination that paul uh had you know lest i suffer the same disappointment that he was trying to avoid here's the hope that he has here's what i have here's part of my purpose in this three-part series paul says to the church holding forth since philippians 2 holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain so why brother jason have you taken now you're taking a third service to tell us something that as message believers we pretty much already know but what i want you to understand friends is that satan is always busy and he's always battling our mind and he's always trying to put you on a slippery slope that doesn't seem like you're disbelieving the word or reasoning it at first but after a while of slipping suddenly your lifestyle goes way away from where you used to be you understand and so we realize that this lie this misunderstanding of scripture is so destructive it is so costly to human souls that it will actually take the overwhelming majority of humanity into a tribulation period for three and a half years a time the bible describes as having no parallel or equal in the 6 000 year history of the world life is short amen life is short i if you're any age at all you know that some of you young people don't look at it that way but trust me our time on earth is very brief and we only have one chance in life to make a difference somehow and in our life it is so so the question comes so now i'm back to paul's burden i want to be able to rejoice i don't want to come up at the finish line and have have half of you or a third of you or a tenth of you or any of you you know floundering believing the lie and end up missing a rapture i i want to i want to be able to rejoice that i've been able to sow the glory of god in your lives and so we we realized that that it begs the question that is our life think about our life for a moment is our life declaring the word of god our lifestyle the conversation of our flesh amen is our lifestyle i think this is uh this is a question every believer should ask every morning when they're setting up their purpose for the day i hope you i hope you meet every day doing several things number one i hope you wake up talking to the lord number two i hope you'll avail yourselves of his mercies which are new every morning number three i hope you're purposing and pledging to him lord i want to serve you today i i don't even know i'll have tomorrow and yesterday's gone but i do have today that's the power of today as brother matt preached for us some time ago there's a wonderful wonderful reality when you think about the power of today all right so now so now when i when i look at this i think about our lives and how what kind of an example are we living to the world it is our life declaring the word of god in such a way that someone observing us might find their way to eternal life that's an important one see that's an important question is our light our daily light of our lives shining brightly enough brightly enough at the least at the least to keep them from believing the lie and being damned by it amen amen because there's going to be people that don't go in a rapture but also don't take the mark of the beast and they're going to go through the tribulation and somehow someway they're going to have a some from somewhere that they knew enough to not take and believe the lie i would like to think they saw me and they talked to me and maybe they weren't ordained for the message but yet i was able to live in such a way before them so we want to keep them from believing the lie and being being damned by it uh my presentation so i want to run quickly over these two quotes from arthur pink that we finished with last time i think they're so poignant that they bear uh re-reading again so pink says he says now this is uh israel crossing the jordan into the canaan's land all right we realize it's the holy ghost not the millennium right jordan meant death so you have to go through death and then into the holy ghost amen all right on the one hand if we confine our viewpoint solely unto the sovereign grace of god in connection with our salvation and deliberately close our eyes to all that scripture teaches upon the discharge of our responsibility that's what almost the entire christian world does see they always just they always just want to holler grace it's just all grace it's you know it doesn't matter how i live or how i look or how i do it matters oh it matters matters to you matters to your victory it matters to your joy and it just might matter to the eternal destination of people who won't make the rapture but might miss taking the mark of the beast see because there will be people who do that they're the unwise virgin they're righteous people so he says he says to all that scripture teaches upon the discharge of our responsibility in relation there to then it would be indeed be strange if we understood how that on the one hand canaan was a free gift unto israel just like the new birth salvation is free which they entered by grace alone by grace alone are you saved through faith amen all right and on the other hand that they had to fight for every inch of it that seems like a conundrum why why does it why do these two why does the type so not answer the anatype because it looked like it was all grace alone but then when they got in there they had to actually have some things to overcome they had to surmount have some victories in their life so it mattered how they lived and how they fought all right so he goes on but when we realize that eternal life is both the gift of god as in romans 6 and a crown which has to be won by faithfulness as in revelation 2 that the christian inheritance is not only purchased by the blood of the lamb but is also the reward of those who serve the lord christ as in colossians 3 then we should have no trouble in perceiving how the type answers to the antitype amen so the need i'll advance on in a minute so the need for the holy ghost i don't know if one of these will darken the screen i'm not gonna the bottom one or the top one oh that worked okay i better still be there when i go back so the need for the holy ghost after believing should make perfect sense to you amen brother branham went back to paul have you received the holy ghost since you believe and those who received the promised having believed they were baptized in the holy ghost the bible is replete with evidence of this and brother branham taught it constantly and would you imagine that it was one of the the main things that that the fundamentalist and evangelicals and denominations held against him is that he preached you had to have the baptism of the holy ghost they said oh you're just you just hang out too much within pentecostals and brother branham would show him in nature he would show him in scripture he had his own life to testify he could perform the signs of of of that are the gifts in the bible he could perform the german he could do all of that thing and amaze them to where they couldn't say a word against that but they still resisted this whole idea that i've got to have that that if i say i have the literal life of christ living inside me that actually means something that's not a cliche that actually it carries weight behind it that brings the christian that makes the church mark 16 which is the church in action if it's not in action it's a worthless gathering of people you'd be better to to to join a country club all right you'd have more fun than coming in here and and be beat up by a preacher uh talking talking down to you how you should live better because if you're not born again that's what this sounds like all right so so the need for the holy ghost after believing should make perfect sense because there is no way for a fallen man to accomplish what pink is talking about there's no way for a fallen man to accomplish that not at least not acceptably for redemption i get that people live holy lives and there's value in that amen the king refers to the unwise virgin that's righteous people amen but we're not talking about i'm not talking about being safe from destruction and being granted eternal life on the backside of the millennium because i got a fair trial at the judgment bar i'm talking about being redeemed and not having to go to the judgment and becoming a part of christ there's no way to accomplish that for a fallen man it's impossible it takes the holy ghost inside of you because god can only accept the unwise virgins of matthew 25 notwithstanding god can only accept himself as the provided sacrifice for redemption abraham knew exactly this the lord shall provide himself a sacrifice the lord shall provide himself as a sacrifice his life living in a man and that alone redeems a man good works however good or however numerous cannot pay the price of redemption it's too expensive there's not enough value someone say it again good works however good however numerous cannot pay the price for redemption i want you to think about our opening text that we read and i don't need to put it back up it was just one simple verse in revelation 10 9. and i went to the angel and said unto him give me this little book and then now the angel is going to respond and i want you to notice that the angel is all business here you're going to notice the that there is a complete absence of pleasantries in this conversation a complete absence of pleasantries in this conversation there's no hey how you doing you know i better make sure i say this politically correct you know he goes to the angel and he said unto me take it and eat it up amen not how you doing would you like to have this is pretty good i think it's a good idea he said i went and asked for the little book because john john representing the bride he wanted to live he wanted eternal life he wanted he wanted redemptions claim and he was told go and ask for the little book and he said i went and asked and said give me the little book and he he didn't say to me how are you how are you doing you're having a nice day i don't want to hurt your feelings he said take it and eat it up and in thy belly it shall make thy belly bitter in case you're wondering this ain't going to be good now it's going to be sweet as honey in your mouth but when it gets down into your belly where you got to actually live it and produce it it's going to set up a spiritual war in fact is such a great one it's going to be called the greatest battle ever fought amen see so the angel is all all business when we look at revelation chapter 10 and we move on i want to come back to revelation 2. notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest you tolerate that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death this is pretty heavy language this is so politically incorrect to say today i mean you know the one of the first pieces one of the first persons that that they would try to x out would be god if jesus came and said this to the world he's one of the first ones cancel culture would attack all the big sponsors would take away their take away their sponsorship and he'd have nobody but believers following him and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts now that's an important statement brother iran's going to key on that a minute and and i will kill our children with death and when i do that when when when my family sees that then all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts now god's children already know that brother brahm's going to point that out see then all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works so brother brennan picks this up in the thyatiran age he says now with this verse i want you to drop down to 23 which as you can see right there i'll kill our children with death and all the churches shall know that i'm he would searcheth the reigns and hearts and i'll give unto every one of you according to your works i want you to drop down to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth i have been bringing to your attention all along and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns now young people listen clothes all you teenagers i am determined that i'm going to take a generation to into the rapture who aren't believing the lie that the world is telling that we're all the same and it doesn't matter and you're overblowing it and we're all just christians no not according to saint paul that's part of the lie amen now listen i want because i don't want to see another generation grow up and i still got to preach this fundamental truth that i've been preaching for 26 years and yet i still see people i don't see people coming sitting in my office saying i'm not sure i believe brother branham but what i do see is people who claim to believe brother branham but their lifestyle doesn't look like they believe brother branham amen amen the testimony i'm not worried about the testimony of their lips i'm worried about the testimony of their lives all right all right so oh matt you're okay here we go all right so and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts i have been saying right along that there are actually two churches now he's going to prove it though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one all right in that verse he's proving this right there's two churches here it is plainly stated that there are churches see and it states just as plainly that some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the reigns and the hearts all right he is going to prove to them that is so now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false vine group because because because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of god the true believers certainly know that they're be they that they being god-fearing judging themselves that they be not judged real christians know the bible teaches that so if he's going to prove to the churches that this is true he's certainly not talking about the true church she already believes that so don't let anyone tell you it doesn't matter all the churches are the same they're not there's only one true church there's only one true vine and the other vine is a like a church but it's a false church all right let's move on now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine that's a fair question isn't it the truth of the matter is they are christians but now watch but they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh now he's going to give you an example they are bearing the name in vain that's according to mark 7 7 go read it see how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of men these are talking about people who do this see but indeed they are christians for what else could they be a mohammedanism that is his religion no matter how he lives how many lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the koran teaches so he's a he's a muslim because he believes the koran that doesn't mean he lives it see so because people subscribe to the bible and subscribe to jesus the historical figure they naturally and rightly so call themselves christians say are you saying they're not christians no i'm saying they are but they're not spirit-born christians they're christians of the flesh that that doesn't go in a rapture amen that may not even escape the damnation that is the be system of the antichrist of taking the mark of the beast all right he goes on in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind etc in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity christian science have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel amen you see where this is going all right he is a nominal christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a believer is one who has been baptized into the body of christ and is a member of him that baptism is a holy ghost baptism but nonetheless it is in god's order that the tares grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising and on the other he's rebuking now he's not bipolar amen he's not double-minded amen he's talking to two different groups he's praising one and rebuking one now watch hold on i'm going to make a big point that i only really struck me today as i was studying this closely as many times i've read over it he has he has now look on the one hand he is praising and on the other hand he is rebuking he has told what is right with the true believer now he warns what the false vine must do if it is to stand justified before the lord now we're not talking about making a rapture we're talking about gaining life at the judgment bar and he has warned them what they must do if they are going to be one of those unwise virgins who are granted eternal life so now how important is it for you and i to take up the word and be a real true accurate living reality of the word of god because brother branham is showing just because they miss the rapture that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody who misses it is doomed everybody who misses it is doomed to go through three and a half years and sleep for a thousand but there are going to be people on the backside oh i don't know they had they saw just enough they heard just enough they knew just enough somehow they they they had their name on the book of life and they found out happily that it had not been removed how many wants to help them how wouldn't you like to know that they're coming in because and they and as they pass by the throne and they see you seated with christ they say look that's the one who we saw and that's the one who talked to us on the street corner that day happy day happy day i'm glad we believed him you see why outreach is so important you see why reaching out is so important see so so we come to that scripture we keep we keep repeating constantly for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so this is why i made some statements to you that were pretty stiff statements and i'm going to repeat one or two of them here's one that i made being a christian in name only is a worthless hypocrisy yes amen further moreover beyond that it is a detriment to the world a detriment means it's a damage it's an injury it's an impairment you're actually because of your lackadaisical lifestyle that's not very spiritual then they look at you and go if they're doing it it must be okay you know what'll happen you'll get by with it because you're a child of god they won't amen amen god will take a belt to you he'll wear you out but he's not going to lose you but they don't enjoy that seed gene privilege they watch your life and you're going to end up dooming them people you claim to love and are trying to help and you don't live a sincere life before them you live a life of carnality and what will get you a whip and will get them a lake of fire see needlessly amen needlessly see so it's a worthless hypocrisy it only leads in fact is why why why is it a detriment why is it an injury why why is it an impairment because it leads to the further blinding of fallen man from the realities of the living god he already has a hard time seeing it and believing it because he hears so much misinterpreted theology that it's not real and if he don't even see it in you and me what's him what's a poor sinner to do see so it only leads to a further blinding of this age god's entire plan from the very start was always to provide a way back to fellowship between god and man that got lost in the garden of eden god was desiring to make a way for the kingdom of god to be restored in the world so if christ is not allowed here's another one if christ is not allowed to live in and through you amen amen if he's not allowed say well he's god i'm just a little worm i can't stop oh yes you can because he's god but he's a gentleman and that's why paul said you have to allow the mind which was in christ you have to allow you have to allow your life to be fervent allow the holy spirit allow that that gift to abound in you see you have to permit that and so if christ is not allowed to live his life in and through you if he's not lifted up high amen jesus said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men to me if he's not lifted up high then your faith in christ is worth very little now and very little ultimately amen amen see brother branham says in the message look we must focus our lives right i'm doing good making tracks we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focus our lives to him and he is the word see if we get our lives lined with the word this is you talking about top secret intel this is nuclear this is atomic secrets of the kingdom devil don't want this known so bad watch if we get our lives lined with the word then the word in our life becomes the same he said if you abide in me in my word and you ask what you will it will be granted to you verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be removed and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you have said i mean i don't need to go out here and move terra firma but i do have mountains in my life that i need to be able to speak to amen i'm not looking to relocate rushmore i'm not looking to relocate mountain bakery i don't need to move the appalachian mountains 50 miles closer to me all right we might do that in the millennium i'm not going to do that here i don't need to do that here but i do have mountains in my life that i need to be able to look at the promise of the word of god and believe it and claim it and see supernatural power launch out to make it happen see he goes on now what i said not what i said what you said you can have because you and he become the same because the mind watch this ending now because the mind i love this wow because the mind that was in christ is in you and the mind that was in christ was to fulfill the father's word so if it's in you what are you going to do fulfill the father's word which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of god amen that is what the devil does not want you to know and of all places it's in the it's in a message i gotta look at that i said my goodness how perfect is the holy spirit of all places to make that statement he he has a prophet called the the title one word look look at my image world look at my people look at my family hey hey blind world hey laodicea you think you understand you understand nothing look i got a bride in the earth she's like me she's become one she's a she's a she's a unit of god look amen you don't want the lord to be embarrassed to say look look at those saints in bethel tabernacle you don't want him to be embarrassed to say that wouldn't you like to have the lord have a testimony of you like he had of his great servants down through time he says to job have you considered my servant jobs nobody like him is a perfect man in all his ways i'm here to tell you something friends i want the lord to look upon me and be proud i want the lord to have confidence in me he said i know i got a son down there and i my enemy is busy but it doesn't matter i got some sons and daughters in beaufort south carolina that'll keep him pushed back hallelujah so this is why uh in hebrews 12 28-29 in eugene peterson's uh message translation he says it like this do you see what we've got an unshakable kingdom and do you see how thankful we must be not only thankful but brimming with worship deeply reverent before god for god is not an indifferent bystander he's actively cleaning house torching all that needs to burn and he won't quit until it's all cleansed god himself is a fire that's in the king james my god is a consuming fire i just say lord burn out of me whatever is necessary don't be a bystander lord be involved in my life and cleanse me daily and i'm here to tell you he's doing it he will keep doing it and you better get in line quick because he's going to keep torching whatever needs torched and believe me you want him to so my greater purpose in this series in this multi-part series firstly has been to express the great lie that is being told in this last day according to prophecy amen that the pro that was in 2nd thessalonians that's a prophecy of the end time that we read that i'll send them strong delusion they'll believe a lie and be damned by it that's an end-time prophecy see and so we first need to expose the lie we showed you how the two messengers to sodom propagated it throughout the world all you need to do is make a decision all you need to do is be a christian of the flesh and you don't really need to be a christian of the spirit you and actually they're not christians of the spirit but they even actually claim they're christians of the spirit but but brother branham would simply come back with common old hillbilly sins and say look it if i had the spirit of houdini in me i'd be an escape artist and do magic tricks if i said i got the spirit of john dillinger in me i'd carry guns and rob banks and i'd be a desperate on a bad guy he said so if i say i've got the spirit of christ in me what am i going to do i'm going to be like jesus see so first thing is to expose the lie that is being told in this last day the lie that is leading to the damnation of many unsuspecting people today you might fairly imagine this would be my primary aim but actually it's not not that not that as a doctrine that it's not vital to redemption given especially given the language of the verse itself there in second thessalonians it's vital to redemption what we're talking about today the baptism of the holy ghost is vital that doctrine you need to understand that that lie that that you don't that you don't really have to let christ be you know change your life that lie be lie you can reason away god's word it doesn't really matter you know the prophet said that 50 years ago this is 2021 come on it doesn't really matter that's part of the lie amen that's insane to think that a prophet who was tapped into the eternal mind of god couldn't give us a word for 2021. come on amen i don't know that's that's man i did fall off the potato truck but i didn't do it yesterday so so we find that that you know you might would think that that's my primary aim because it actually is a modern 2021 event made clear in 2000 year old prophecy all right but i actually have a further purpose uh you know even even more representative i guess i would say of my main burden and that is that we do not declare the lie in our lives by living a life before the unknowing world that misrepresents true holy ghost-filled christianity amen that is my main burden i've taken three services and i and i've went back and forth between it's been a two-pronged attack i've been exposing the life for three services back to back to back because i'm determined to nail it till it clenches that this question is never in the mind because that's constantly satan is constantly busy trying to bomb you and bend you and pound you into that kind of an understanding to get you to lower your guard and think that it doesn't matter i want to tell you something friends it matters more today than it's ever ever mattered where are the to where though those upon whom the ends of the world have come and so i have taken three services to not only pound what the lie is and what the blindness i only started calling it the lie tonight i've been calling it the blindness of the age that those messengers sowed in the world but where but also as i've been coming along not just tonight in the uh first two parts i've also been trying to get us to understand that that our lives that living we don't want to live in such a way to an unknowing world that we misrepresent a holy what it means to be a holy ghost-filled christian or taking too lightly that we are to have the token on display amen taking that too lightly see and so we're talking about in our everyday lives for everybody to see that's what the token on display means that's that's just a cliche if it's not true see the token on display means that i'm proving in my life my life is testifying to a spirit-filled existence so you know so if we misrepresent the true gospel by our carnal lifestyle hello hello if we represent and find ourselves in such a way projecting to the world misrepresenting the true gospel by a carnal lifestyle then there's little value listen friends there's there's almost no value in being religious if you're not spiritual amen i've seen a lot of people get religious and not any more spiritual and the more religious they gets most times the less spiritual they seem to get unto where the whole thing becomes a delusion to them and i'm going to tell you something a spiritual life is on fire for god how many believe that do we still believe that in 2021 hallelujah spiritual life is a life on fire for god the zeal of the lord is burning down inside of our souls it's a life void of a desire for the world it's a it's a visible life of self-crucifixion if that's not you as a christian you're not a true spirit christian amen see because it's void of the things of the world no i'm okay i did not fall poor siri thinking are you okay you sound like you're dying i'm trying to kill the devil siri but don't report that friends the bottom line is if we make it something other than what was taught and explained to us by the apostles and prophets in the new testament and that's what the world has done today and if you do that that's one of the most egregious failures we can commit amen that's i'ma say that again that's one of the most egregious failures you can commit is to is to make it something other than what was taught and explained to us by the apostles and prophets in the new testament see so so if for no other reason that then then then then you know that that we are you know i mean good grief i don't i don't want to play along so that i'm actually demonstrating the mystery of iniquity take your pick you want to demonstrate the mystery of iniquity why is it a mystery because nobody knows they're guilty of it they're blind and naked don't know it it's hidden denominationalism it's hidden it's a mystery of iniquity it's reasoning the word of god nobody understands not to do that they don't think they're doing that and that's why it's a mystery of iniquity and it would still be a mystery of iniquity and i'm here to tell you you wouldn't been smart enough to figure it out but god sent an uneducated hillbilly who stood in the presence of god and was able not to bring us intellectualism but unable to bring thus saith the lord so i know what iniquity is now it's not a mystery to me anymore see so given the fact that god chose you from among billions does that weigh on you friend he chose you from among billions to represent him and brother branham had that concern and i i said this in part one or part two are we are we sufficiently impressed by this amen is it sufficiently impressed upon your mind that god chose you from among billions looked over billions with a b billions multiple billions and chose you for eternal life and in a and gave you the secret to the mystery of iniquity and and is filling your life with the holy ghost and has brought a gene of god to life to where you can't even be lost does this sufficiently weigh upon us are we sufficiently impressed so one purpose and goal that brother branham says you know that he hadn't even gone into much detail until this message until he's coming to this message that we've been reading these quotes from from the message look in ninth he preached it several times and so he he talks about how that i haven't gone into a lot of detail about it and you know that i mean i gotta tell you that this this comforts me you know with what seems like a continual proclamation of doom is imminent and i get it i understand that sometimes we it's it it can just sound like oh you're always just in a proclamation of doom well the secret to escaping it is to focus on the word focus your life focus your life into the word then our life and the word will become one and you become a living unit of god see we're not talking about a sinless perfection enoch wasn't perfected enoch wasn't perfect there's none good no not one that's right amen we're all we all we like sheep have gone astray even elijah had um a man of like passions brother branham says with his ups and downs amen see we're all open sepulchers said paul we're all just dead men see there's only one good among us and that's christ it's not that enoch was a perfect man but his faith was in a fully revealed word and in fact is so great was his faith in that fully revealed word that he literally manifested that faith as he built the image as he built that image of the perfect word in his pyramid amen that pyramid was a manifestation of a revelation that was flowing through him that he couldn't rest day and night till he got it built for the world to see and paul peter says you're lively stones you're a temple now i'm here to tell you something friends we're building the image of the son of god in the last days your life is the is the antidote your lived life is the antidote to the deception of the lie that your neighbors are believing churches are believing billions of people are believing i say we got a lot of work to do and a short time to do it i say lord breathe on me with more fire lord breathe on me with more spirit cause me to be more real hallelujah is that your desire see so so i realized that you know even when my flesh doesn't seem to always live the right image there's still an inner voice amen drives me to my knees again does it to you drives you to your knees stands you back up on your feet and you start again hallelujah oh my so we find then let me try to let me try to find a place i want to try to finish this out so i mean that that that's a fair question to say why does then why does the bride go in the rapture and the unwise virgin does not i mean because let's face it there are some holiness groups that out outpace us in works see so if it's based on that it's going to be the opposite they're going to go and we're not going to go see so it's it's not about that thank god it's it's about the fact that i have believed the word for my day see then well then that just gives you carte blanche that just gives you a ticket to do anything it it it absolutely does do that it lets me do all my heart's desire and the more i get the more i hear of the mystery of god the more my heart's desire is this right here amen see it's not a forced imagery i'm not here today to preach a forced imagery i'm not here today to put you under legalism that's just religion that's almost no value at all i'm talking about a fire breathing experience friends something where you humble yourself daily and let the holy spirit come down and live in and through your lives the world is depending on us there we're the only version of jesus they'll see they don't see him until the end of revelation 19 and by that time it's too late so you are the only version that they will see it's a literally a reproduction you believe that of god's word reproduced in this day amen so brother branham comes to this right here and he says the spoken word is original seed if you haven't don't if you haven't don't believe all the word of god you haven't received the holy ghost yet right that's exactly right the holy spirit when you hear the truth and the holy spirit don't lead you to it then there's another spirit in there keeping you away from it so the spirit you got in you ain't the holy spirit amen see see that's a tough statement but that's the truth now watch brother branham says back to this message look there is a judgment coming the sinner knows it many people when you speak of church they have a funny idea that's true isn't it the world when they pass by the church i mean the body of christ gathered together they think of our women with some great long stringy hair with black dresses and everything and they think of the men with long fingers dressed in black clothes and always condemning them to a good sense of the word that's true because the church is a peculiar people a called out people watch the reason it looks that way to the man who wants to judge the church in that condition is because the church is always pointing a condemning finger to everything he thinks is good and if he's a sinner he thinks sin is good the pleasures of life such as living in the world and when the church stands up and condemns that thing it looks like a hideous animal to him but if he only knows it's god's only way of bringing salvation that's right expressing the word of god by the lips of his servant amen so i i get that unbelievers don't like me preaching like this i get that people who are believers but don't really have the holy ghost burning like they should get a little bent at preachers preaching like this we've had them sit right in this church and get flaming mad at the preachers amen i've dealt with it for 26 years but now you now you know why see now you know what you say oh yeah now i know why you preach it like that no no you're missing the the lesson now you know why you're reacting like that amen amen there's nothing wrong with the preachers they're not doing anything but what we're supposed to be doing but it's your reaction that's poor why is it because because the holy ghost coming out of here it doesn't find the holy ghost down inside of you and that's why it gets under your skin see so it becomes astonishing because i'm just going to try to turn that off it becomes astonishing then that we would have to revisit this over and over you know uh but as i said there's a relentless devil and this close to the finish line friends i'm here to tell you you know um that as a ministry it's amazing to me that we still have to earnestly contend for this but i'm going to earnestly contend for it until we're out of here you can rest assured i'm never going to sit back and let that lie be pervasive in those people who are under my care that's never going to happen we're too close to home i know that the spirit on the age daily i know it i know it tries to pound that into you constantly constantly trying to pound the image of the lie into your life but the word is preached you know why we preach it to keep you washed i'm washing you in the washing of the water of the word we're trying to keep you washed clean of this global deception so that you see and fully understand the lie that's important see and just as important perhaps as i've said perhaps even more so and certainly the main burden of my heart in these last sermons has been you know that you not conduct yourself in such a way as to facilitate that lie that's that's what keeps brother jason awake at night amen not that maybe you don't understand the mysteries not that you can't line up the seals trumpets vows and woes that doesn't keep me awake at night what keeps me awake at night is that some of you have believed the lie and it has duped you in your lifestyle and you've allowed carnality and you've allowed the flaming fire of the holy spirit to dim in your lives i want to read you some scriptures before we close nine minutes before i've set myself a self-imposed deadline i think i can just read these off and we'll stop first peter 2 9 but ye are a chosen generation you love that a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people here's why here's why that ye should show forth show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light so am i off the word isn't this the desire of simon peter that you show forth his praises paul in philippians 2 that ye may be blameless but jason why do you why have you taken three sermons on this that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world you remember my analogy of the lighthouse you got a ship out there being tossed people innocent are going to die unless your light beam can pierce the raging storm so you're going to brighten your light you're going to dim the light you know any any person who's got a problem with these three sermons i'm just gonna i want an answer to that question there's a ship out there there's innocent people the only way they're gonna get to safety is your lighthouse are you going to brighten the light or are you going to dim the light amen and it ends right there unless you're willing to answer that question don't berate me see don't don't say a word negative about these three services not that i have any not that i have even a single negative word not even one i'm just saying i'm just giving the devil notice lest there should be anyone in this church are out on the airwaves until you can answer that question for me because the answer is pretty obvious it's a trap you probably shouldn't try because it'll trap you see because if you say i should dim the light then i'm going to tell you you just go away from me you're going to hell and there's no hope for you if you if that's the kind of heart you have that you want to dim the light and people are re they're relying on a bright light and you claim you like them and love them and they're your work associates and your neighbors and you recreate with them and you work near them and you go to school with them and you shop with them and you see their children and and and and and you don't brighten the light you don't brighten the light you dim the light heartless is a is a compliment to what that is see look from the esv i love this philippians now we just read it we just read it here in king james look at look at esv that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation among whom you shine as lights in the world first john 1 5-8 esv this is the message we have heard from him and proclaimed to you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness we lie and do not practice the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin let me give this last one i saved it for last second corinthians 4 1 and 2 therefore and one through actually we get 1 2 and then 11. therefore seeing we have this ministry this ministry don't read this ministry that i have taken three services back to back to back to deliver to you and i know i'll preach it again somewhere anytime i finish this series and it's still burning and i want to start all over i'm sure i'll preach it again somewhere i think it's timely now concerning what you've heard for three days therefore seeing we have this ministry the one i've been describing to you as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus's sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh amen amen musicians come on stan god bless you amen you can take that down matt amen i made it got all the way through it and i feel satisfied amen friends i wanted that completed it's recorded it's on the internet now it's an archive let the record stand for whoever wants to believe it i'm here to tell you we're almost home amen and if there was ever a time that we need to be shining brightly in our lives is now the world is believing a misunderstanding of scripture so devastating so devastating is this misunderstanding so devastating that the overwhelming majority of billions of human beings are gonna go right into a three and a half year tribulation that's how devastating that lie is and so i want to expose it and once we know what it is then the answer becomes self-evident the answer is then to let your light shine and let your life demonstrate and manifest as we just read in your mortal flesh so don't tell me it doesn't matter about your mortal flesh how you dress how you look where you go what you do what you say your mortal flesh matters your mortal flesh the failures of your mortal flesh won't keep you out of the rapture because you've passed from death to life you can never come into the judgment a seed genome has come a seed gene there won't be one empty chair at that table but there also won't be one extra placemat at that table but while we're here friends how about we live it in such a way that we find every last seed on that book of life so we can go home and that we leave a mark in this world that we leave a testimony that you're willing to leave footprints on the sands of time that when someone in that tribulation sees it they'll see footprints and it just might save their life bow your heads with me i thank you lord i thank you for allowing me to finish this series i thank you that it's burned on my heart now lord now it comes to the bitterness in the belly sweetie in my mouth but the bitterness in the belly because this this is me too lord i'm in it we're all in this together i'm right there with the lord what's my life look like all of our lives lord our heads are bowed our hearts are bowed now right now father deal with your children in this visible audience out across the internet lord there's no there's nobody could say that i stepped outside of your word no i took my time studying this thought i took my time i said things lord you know there there were times when i s i would spend an hour on a single paragraph how to say it just 15 words in a pair a short paragraph sit there for an hour write it one way delete it rewrite it delete it rewrite it delete it rewrite it trying to feel the mind of the holy spirit until i felt you satisfied right you got it that's how when it said [Music] i've been very studious lord i've been very careful i've put a lot amount a lot of study into this thought it's been these three services long and i've i've taken a lot of time preaching them more than normal all three times i realize lord that we are so close to the catching away and you are you are making these adjustments you are coming back and earnestly contending for the faith once delivered we're we're being stirred up by way of remembrance that we don't believe this devastating lie that the world has fell victim to [Music] we're different lord we're a chosen people a royal priesthood called of god we've been given great grace we've been shown the mystery of iniquity so that we don't go that way are we sufficiently impressed that god stepped beyond billions and saved us stepped beyond billions and revealed his word to us are we sufficiently impressed by that if we're not i pray you stir our hearts stir our hearts lord god may from this night going forward may these may lord this three series sermon father it's if it's the last series or sermon i ever preached in my life if i'm standing in this pulpit for the last time i want i want to be able to say i have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of god master i pray that you'll let it be a living reality to me not only to me but all those who hear it will hear it let it become a living reality lord give us a willing heart give us a freshness give us a refilling give us that fresh surge of the holy ghost prophet talked about grant it to us lord we love you we thank you i thank you for these people thank you for their patience their

long i'd be alone and i have a my wife has notes all over the house i sit in that same seat and i look on the wall and it says i can remember all the times i prayed for the things that i have now it's just that now i can look across this table and i can see a precious gift that god has given to me amen my precious wife melissa and i want to thank you all for your many prayers and um you know some people think well it happened so fast well i just want to say when god's doing something just get in line and go yeah amen that's all i got for now thank you amen i just wanted to give god all the glory in this um it's been a month now or so ago i uh i had this test that i was studying for and um there was it was a two-part test and during the whole thing [Music] during the whole thing i uh i just was asking the brothers to pray for me i was just praying and believing that i could just get through this test and the first one i passed fine it wasn't too bad and the second one i was i was most worried about i had the brother's plan i told my mom to have everybody praying and and i just i was so just worried about it i just i just wanted to get it out of the way and i wanted the lord to do something mighty i just it's supposedly supposed to super hard test and so i just wanted it to be done with so i just had the brothers pray and i actually just felt led to just open up i have this
