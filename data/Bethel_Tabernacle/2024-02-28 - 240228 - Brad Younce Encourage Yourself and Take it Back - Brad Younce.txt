want to sit up here I want to hear it how he loves the Lord serve him better than anybody else I can think of devil he don't he must not like what I have to bring cuz he been battling all day long woke up this morning he attacked my wife had to take her to the ER probably left there about 2 o' this afternoon I was sitting here thinking if she has to stay overnight I'm coming anyway cuz we ain't let no devil beat us it's like brother Jason says he ain't nobody so we'll we'll just use that line he ain't nobody but if you have your Bibles let's turn to 1st Samuel chapter 30 and let's read the first six verses I've got my timer on an hour and a half I was told back here a few minutes ago um don't be Pharaoh don't hold the people too long it wasn't brother Matt that said that 1st Samuel chapter 30 and verse 1 and it came to pass when David and his men were coming to ziglang on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and zigg and smitten Zig and burned it with fire and had taken the women captive that were that were therein and they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep and David's two wives were taken captives and David was greatly distressed for the people spake a stone in him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God may God add a blessings to his reion you have your seats for a title for a little bit I want to speak on encourage yourself and then take it back encourage yourself then take it back you know you'll say take what back you know something that belonged to you if somebody was to come and steal it you have a right to take it back you could be standing there and a and you have your watch on and the next thing you know you look at it your watch is gone you didn't tell the thief here you can steal my watch but no the de but the the devil the thief come and sto it without you even knowing what happened you just come by a nose and say hey hold on a minute somebody just stole my watch but we don't it's something that you want to take back it's something that used to be yours you didn't say here devil here's my health you can have it here here's my joy you can have it no you didn't who would hear would say that to the devil anybody here say here devil you just take it I don't want my joy no more you have it it's yours you ain't going to give a thief anything if you're not in your right mind you won't anyway but the devil came in and took those things and I'm going go ahead and give a warning to you this evening that there's a thief in the building he's seeking whom he may devour and trying to destroy you so look around he might be here trying to steal your peace he might be walking around trying to steal your health and your joy there's a in the building he's walking by your seat he's looking for a weak vulnerable Christian somebody maybe hadn't prayed like they ought to somebody maybe hadn't read the Bible or listened to a message in a couple of days and you're getting kind of weak the devil looks for that that's what he does he prays on the weak just keep your eyes open he's trying to steal our joy he's trying to steal our happiness he's trying to take what peace you got we live in this world but we don't need to be brought down by it this world's awful gloomy and awful dark the presses upon you it muddles your mind you know what I'm talking about you can't seem to think right sometimes I was trying to study last Saturday for tonight and I had to preach somewhere on Sunday and I couldn't hardly get my thoughts right because my mind just so muddled down by the cares of This World by the stress and the pressure that we go through you know what I'm talking about the Bible says don't give place to the devil don't give it to him that's what it is give don't give it to him to give over to give to one's care to entrust I ain't trusted the devil with nothing you can't trust the devil don't give place don't give him any room or portion or space marked off you know we have a room at our house as a guest room that people come sometimes and stays so my wife will just come and she'll she'll somebody will come and visit she'll say hey the room's ready the sheets been changed you got fresh Tils out the room is ready for you we have a guest they're welcome but sometimes we get that unwelcome guest somebody you don't want to come in but they come in anyway what are you going to do if somebody comes in your house they're dragging their suitcase in I'm here to stay I'm going to your room cuz I know you got one up there better get it off you love him how many has a room for the devil if you have an unwelcome guest in your house you're going to get up there and you're going to say hey get out of my my house you don't have no right here this is my house I have rights here you don't have no rights so take your bags pack them back up and get out of my house why do we let the devil come in why do we let the devil come in and steal our happiness we let the devil come in and steal our health steal our joy it's okay you just go over and sit over just in the corner devil don't give place to the devil don't give any room for the devil there's no room in my house for him I might have plenty of room for some of you but I have no room for no devil don't give him opportunity a power or occasion for acting we should not give the devil the opportunity to take a place in our lives we have no room for him some people says well you heard the saying if you can't beat them join them the devil gets on beat down so much so many things that they're going through well the devil's powerful don't give room to the devil he might be powerful but we serve a god who's much more powerful than he is you don't tell devil say come on in I got your room ready what has the devil took from you just think about it what was once in your possession now that the devil has he steals your joy he'll steal your peace he'll steal your health he'll get in your finances he'll steal your children and we just let him yeah a thief will steal anything he could get his hands on so the devil's a thief and a liar so what was once in your possession even though the devil's got it it's still yours so all you got to do is take back your possession possession what is a possession owning or controlling something you're in control of what's yours every promise in this book is yours you're in control of it Hallelujah somebody comes in your house and says I want that couch I want that table I want all you Electronics you're just going to hand it to them take it I don't need it but we let the devil do the same thing he ain't gonna tell you he's going to do it he just does it we let him we won't say a word about it something that's in your control until you let somebody steal it so all these promises in this book is under your control amen God says I give you all these so I put it under your control but we let the devil come in and take away our possessions possession Gideon will know this one control of the ball in a basketball game when they have when one team has possession they say they got control of the ball so that ball is going to do whatever that player who has it if they're going to pass it or they're going to shoot it or what are they're going to do they have control of that ball what do you have control over do you have control over your healing you have control over your besetting sin you have control over your finances you know fathers we need to take control of our homes we need to apply the token we need to put the blood above our doors to keep the devil out what would happen down in Egypt if the father had put the blood over the doors when the death angel passed by the firstborn would die but the father put the blood over he applied the token he's claiming his children he's claiming his children that's what we need to do we need to claim our children you might not talk to them in three years but God is moving on a scene it's the act of having or taking into control you know I sit here this this afternoon sit thinking of this and I actually looked it up because you heard you you would hear brother brandham say and he said it 107 times I take every Spirit here under my control every Spirit he say you're a human being you're a spirit so I'm standing here I'm taking every Spirit under my control you wonder then when the devil started getting nervous Brother JD they start getting nervous you know brother BS what brother get ready to call on one person and they might have an issue with anxiety all of a sudden some some will pop up over here they're crying back and forth for help because they know once that man says I'm bringing every Spirit under my control something's going to happen that's what we need to do we need to take every Spirit under our control what would happen if every Spirit was under your control brother I didn't say I didn't he says I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of William brandom if you see that ever all 107 times he says I'll take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God what would happen if we if we were to do that if we us to go in our homes if we would tell the devil I'll take every Spirit under my control and drive out every devil out of your house we don't want to make him feel welcome come on devil come on in sit down and have you have you drink a sweet tea Hallelujah you could go in your house say I take every Spirit under my control every anxiety Spirit every depression Spirit every lust spirit I take it under my control ever depression Spirit stuff might be bringing you down you might be under something for the last few months God knows but the devil will try to get you to seow down and depressed you don't want to do nothing you'll come to church you'll leave soon the preacher says you're dismissed don't see people there's Deliverance for that bring that under your control possession the act of having or taken in control control or occupancy of property it's ownership you own it hallelujah it's your property it belongs to you it's a physiological state in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another they use this definition for the possessed people out here but I'm using the same one where we how we possess we're blessed by God where it takes my normal personality and it's turned over to Jesus Christ where I ain't nothing but a walking talking Jesus that I have all things in control under my feet so every promise in this book belongs to you it's your possession you know when you go buy a car you got this list of stack of papers you got to sign and you'll sign every one of them and they say okay here's the keys the car is yours but you sit there in your chair look out the window man that's a beautiful car that's the nicest one I've ever had I bet it's got that new car smell the the guy at the store said it's yours get out of here you just look over and say hey bro look my car car but you're inside the building still looking at it hey bro there's my healing there's my joy there's my overcoming power there's my Deliverance but it's right outside the door we're afraid to get up and go get it it's your possession why don't you get up and go get [Music] it but until you get out of that chair and take those keys it's not yours just yet but you got to get the keys and get in it and start that thing up and you're like this is mine and you're driving down the road with your possession you don't take the keys and walk out the door and with the brother Matt here my car is yours he didn't sign the paper now if he wants to make the payment I'll let him drive it but it's still in my name it's my possession I claimed it so I got out there and got in it and drove off in it because it's mine healing stands in front of me I'm going to reach out and claim it because it's mine but it's so easy when you give somebody something it's easy to take it back like an Indian giver or you buy something and just take it back where you bought it we'll do it in a heartbeat even take back stuff we said but we're afraid to take back what the devil stoed from us I don't have to know what he stole from you you know so take it back just look at the Devil say get it back to me it's my property I believe it belongs to me you know open the scripture says in 1 Samuel and it came to pass when David his men were come to zigg on the third day you know David was living in the land of the Philistines he got tired of King Saul chasing him so he went and said okay I'll make a deal with the Devils I'll fight for you if you let me live in one of your towns they said okay so we're getting ready to go fight Israel won't you come on and help us well David and his army got there and the leaders said what are these Hebrews doing here send them back home so what the Bible says took them three days to get back home so what it took them three days to get there and three days back so they were pretty tired they got back home you can imagine after a long trip brother Matt knows fly to New Zealand you get to New Zealand you sleep for three days you're so wore out at that weakest time is when you get sick you can get I I do when if if I go a few days without any rest or sleep I start getting you start feeling sick brother Andrew you start feeling you and my wife knows if I don't get no rest I got the man flu so in traveling they were already worn out it's at this point of tiredness sometimes you get like I said you get sick you at your weakest point when you're worn out it's at this point the devil likes to attack you he likes to get you at your weakest Point that's when he comes to you if God loved you you wouldn't be going through all these things if God really loved you you wouldn't be sick all the time that's what he did to Jesus where Jesus was baptized went up to the Wilderness to be tempted and after 40 days the devil come to him caught him when he was weak if thou be the Son of God cast these make these Stones bread throw yourself off the temple if thou he he started so he started tempting Jesus at his weakest moment the devil started attacking that's what the devil likes to do to you he'll get you at your weakest moment when you're down and out trial after trial bombard you you're wondering God do you even love me you're just wonder what next could happen when you don't think anything else can happen you get hit by somebody that happened last weekend just when you don't when you think you can't go through one more thing here comes something else and the devil would like to use that to you he'll mess with your mind at that weakest Point that's what he did to David sometimes you feel like you can't go on that this was a state that David his army was in when they returned they found out the amalekites had invaded from the south and zigged and and burned it down and taking all the women captives that were therein and David and his men came the city and behold it was burned with fire their wives their sons their daughters were taking captives can you imagine how they felt fathers you go home and your wives and kids are gone and David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep can you imagine being there they cried so much they couldn't cry no more and David's two wives he already Tak C David was greatly distressed for the people spake a stone in him I couldn't imagine what they were going through and they started blaming David if you hadn't run from King Saul our wives would be protected over there they wouldn't dare to come over the land of Israel destroy our town but it's your fault you're the one that provoked the Malachi to come in here it's your fault David it's so easy to find the blame on somebody start blaming people for for stuff but because the soul of the people was greev every man for his sons and daughters that David but David encouraged himself you know David was so down how could things get worse that's the way it is just when things can't get any worse something else will happen you'll go through trial after trial but take courage God said he won't put no more on you than you can bear cuz that's what it says Thou have no temptation taken you but such is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able and with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you'll be able able to Bear it all hell might be breaking loose on you but God can trust you oh Lord you think you're going through all kinds of Trials God has confidence in you that you're going to overcome every one of them encourage be of good courage fortify recover strengthen yourself become strong and courageous to be become strong grow strong play the man what a definition for encourage play the man you know this same word encourage is the same definition you know in Joshua be strong you know how many times it says in the Bible be strong and of good courage be strong he's saiding Play The Man be the man stand up God's saying quit play he say quit quit trying to play the man stand up be one get a backbone about us quit quit feeling sorry for ourselves play the man whatever you do do it like your life depends on it playing the manans means playing hard it's leaving put it all out there on the court we need to as Sons and Daughters of God is get a backbone about us quit feeling sorry for ourselves whoo is me you say you don't know what I'm going through you don't know what I'm going through we need to quit crying and moping around Play The Man it ain't this ain't only for men it's for women too we all need a backbone we all need to be C have courage we need to encourage oursel leave it on the court in other words give it everything you got when you're in church give it everything you got young people before down in Tennessee the football stum they have a sign above the door when the team runs out and it says today I give my all to Tennessee and so what they'll do when they run out they'll reach out they every player will slap that before they come out on the field they're giving their all to Tennessee that day I come in the door with my mind made up tonight I'm giving my all for Jesus Christ it don't matter what the devil has thrown at me I given my all I'm giv everything I'm leaving it all out of here on the court we're not halfway Christians we this play the man is not halfway living you got to be all the way in we got to be 100% Christian live each day like it's the first and last day of your life it's an infectuous enthusiasm that can come only from being filled with the Holy Spirit to overflowing that's playing the man I love this the word enthusiasm comes from the Greek roots in an Theos meaning in God so the more you get into God the more God's spirit gets into you the more impassion you become it won't be devil if you don't mind can you take your anxiety away from me devil if you don't mind can you take this heart condition away from me okay one more thing devil if you don't mind can you get rid of this lust can you get that lust away from me that's not being imp passion you should have the enthusiasm that comes from being filled with the Holy Ghost the read it again the more you get into God the more imp passion you become you will say devil take your heart problems take your anxiety Take Your Lust and get out when was the last time you got outside your comfort zone physically spiritually you tell me the last time you were uncomfortable and I'll tell you the last time you grew growth only happens when we put ourselves into uncomfortable situations how about this example Jesus may have been Meek and Mild but he also had a wild out side he touched the leopards celebrated Samaritans stopped storms cast out demons ate with Sinners healed on the Sabbath turned funeral possessions into parades it's though coincidence that the final week of his life was called passion week because that's who Jesus [Music] was when you following the footsteps of Jesus his passion will refine you and Define you God don't doesn't just crucify our passions he resurrects them and uses them for his purpose what can you do today that'll make you feel uncomfortable and fully Alive play the man that was free David encouraged himself in the Lord took all patience and exercised faith on his God he encouraged himself in the power of God in the promises of God and his faithfulness in keeping them David encouraged himself in the Lord in the promises of God you know he probably got to thinking you know this this is this is rough I don't think I've ever been through anything like this he said you know what one day God allowed me to take a bear and kill a lamb he allowed me one day to kill a Goliath praise the god thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace thank you for all your goodness you've given to me David starting encouraging himself you need encouraging start thinking about what God's done for you God you deliver me from this world God you saved my soul God you placed a predestinated seed inside of me God you fill me with the Holy Ghost start encouraging yourself start thinking about all the things that God has done for you brought you from a barroom stool to a church pew Hallelujah the tarum says David strengthened himself in the word of the Lord his God Christ the word of God in the power of His might so how do you encourage yourself it's simple get into this word get into this word start looking around at what belongs to you oh Lord by his stripes I'm Healed if I ask anything in his name he's going to do it promise after promise after promise what did David do after he encourag encouraged himself he went to prayer what do I do God verse eight David inquired the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop to run after usually with hostile intent Lord should I go after this this army with hostile intent woo sometimes that's what we need to do the Devils took our possessions we need to get hostile with him we need to take the sword to go after him not running back this way but running right at him run after the devil get hostile with him Chase put the flight follow him persecute him persecute the devil he persecutes us enough turn the tables on him let's start persecuting the devil should I pursue them shall I overtake them and he answers says pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all what do you got lost what's been taken from you pursue the devil you will recover all amen so David went 600 men went down to the brook there were some that left behind it was too weak to go of course you know the story they found an Egyptian he said yeah they they're down here but David said can you bring me down to this company and swear unto me by God that neither wilt thou kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master I will bring thee down to this company and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon the Earth they thought David and him was going to be gone for days no doubt they probably hung up on the mountain tops and looked and says they're gone off the war they're going to be gone for several days it's our time so they were just having a good old time good party they were spread abroad upon the Earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the the land of the Philistines from David and his men and David smoked them from Twilight even until the eding of the next day woo that's a long time sometimes it takes that long sometimes it'll take us that long to to to get back what's ours because we want want to destroy every devil in our way and there escaped not a man of them sa 400 young men which rode camels and fled and David recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and there was nothing lacking to them whatever they lost they got back so if you lost your joy you can get every bit of it back back not one of it is gone Hallelujah you got a Lost Child you're going to get it back Hallelujah David recovered all brother R said in possessing all things I got 11 minutes left the

the Lord Jesus a hand clap of Praise I think he's worthy thank you Lord amen praise the Lord thank you Amen Brother Brad for that wonderful sermon that was just awesome you know I love um I love that story means so much to me David and ziklag and the restoration and uh I love so much even Brother Brad brought so much out of that but I just love so much seeing how that if you follow that story when David gets his wife back all the men get their wi back their families their children but actually if you go further David also not not only did he get everything back and recover all that he lost but actually the Bible says that David recovered the spoils which spoils were loot it was just what they got they not only did they take the men took their wives and children but when David wiped them out he took their gold he took their Treasures he took their oxen he took and so when the devil take something from you not only do you get it back but you get that plus amen you might have lost this much joy but God gives you this much joy back I love um we brother Josh Bennett preached uh just a masterpiece when we were in Johnson City several months ago now and it and it's always stuck with me and my wife so much um the Lord just spoke to us so much in that service that I'll never forget he was talking about restoration and he brought out how that in the Bible that when a man stole an ox and he said when a man would if a man was to steal another man's Ox that God actually put a law in the Bible that when he returned that he wasn't just permitted just to give the ox back but he actually had to give him payment he had to compensate him for all the lost time in the field that he had all the lost time from work all the crops that he lost because he didn't have that Ox actually the man had to give not just the ox back and brother Josh said restoration when God gives is not just restoration it's rep restoration with compensation are you glad for that church God not not only did he restore the word back he wasn't just restored back what Luther had what Wesley had what all that was lost but in this age we not only get it all back but we get everything plus amen thankful for that we got some prayer requests here Amen Brother Brad I'm going to have you come and pray for uh brother kinbo writes in please have the church pray for me tonight I'm still fighting with what I had last
