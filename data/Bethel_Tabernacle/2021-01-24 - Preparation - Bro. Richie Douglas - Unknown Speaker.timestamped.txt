[38:02] tonight
[38:03] amen matthew 25
[38:06] verse 1 says then shall the kingdom of
[38:08] heaven
[38:09] be likened unto ten virgins
[38:13] which took their lamps and went forth to
[38:16] meet the bridegroom
[38:18] and five of them were wise and five were
[38:22] foolish
[38:23] they that were foolish took their lamps
[38:26] and took no oil with them
[38:29] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[38:32] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[38:35] carried
[38:36] they all slumbered and slept and at
[38:39] midnight there was
[38:40] a cry made behold the bridegroom
[38:44] cometh go ye out to meet him
[38:47] then all those virgins arose and trim
[38:50] their lamps
[38:52] and the foolish said said unto the wise
[38:55] give us
[38:56] of your all for our lamps are gone out
[39:00] but none of the wise answered
[39:03] not so least there be not enough for
[39:06] us and you but you
[39:09] but go ye rather to them
[39:12] that sail and buy for yourselves
[39:17] and while they went to buy the
[39:19] bridegroom came
[39:21] and they that were ready went in with
[39:24] him
[39:25] to the marriage and the door was shut
[39:28] afterward came also other virgins saying
[39:32] lord lord open to us
[39:36] but he answered and said verily i say
[39:39] unto you
[39:40] i know you not
[39:43] watch therefore for ye know
[39:47] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[39:51] son of man
[39:52] cometh oh father
[39:56] i tremble and shake at your word lord
[40:00] father with such great respect and honor
[40:04] for your word
[40:06] oh holy spirit would you come now and
[40:08] speak
[40:09] through these lips of clay tonight lord
[40:12] that father the
[40:13] lord that i can be used in such a way to
[40:16] lift you up so high
[40:18] that you draw men to yourself father i
[40:21] pray you take total control of this
[40:23] service
[40:24] god for this is a victory day for us
[40:27] lord
[40:28] because you have caused us to be
[40:31] victorious
[40:32] and to live a christian life
[40:35] father we're so thankful to be partakers
[40:38] here tonight lord
[40:39] we ask you to do these things in the
[40:41] name of jesus christ our savior
[40:43] amen and amen you may be seated
[40:47] i want to talk about tonight by god's
[40:49] grace just for a few minutes
[40:51] preparation we see here that
[40:54] this lesson shows us
[40:58] about the value of being prepared
[41:01] amen what a what a warning to us because
[41:05] the bible
[41:06] says that they took all
[41:09] in their vessels with their lamps
[41:13] and the others did not because they had
[41:17] a plan
[41:19] but they wasn't prepared see many times
[41:22] we have plans
[41:24] and see god is the one that's got the
[41:26] plan
[41:27] all we have to do is be prepared
[41:30] when the pro when the plan is in the
[41:32] process
[41:34] and we're so thankful for that tonight
[41:37] you know we see that the five wives
[41:41] they are prepared they have
[41:44] you know they they had the all they
[41:46] needed
[41:48] they wasn't depending on nobody else
[41:50] they had already
[41:51] seen what god required of those to come
[41:56] but others the other five was slawful
[41:59] and
[41:59] and lazy and said well i'll just wait
[42:03] till
[42:03] you know right to the you know satan
[42:05] wants you to do that you know he'll
[42:07] many times he tries to attack us to him
[42:09] you know you don't have to be
[42:10] you don't you you don't have to be the
[42:12] bride just let out a little bit you know
[42:14] just go ahead and
[42:15] you you can you can be the five foolish
[42:17] you can make it you know
[42:18] but you realize you do you realize do
[42:21] you people do not
[42:22] understand are you really prepared
[42:25] for the tribulation are you
[42:28] really that that close to god that you
[42:32] think that you don't
[42:33] need to go in the rapture that you can
[42:34] make the
[42:36] make it through the tribulation see how
[42:39] satan tries to take
[42:41] give you an opportunity for a less what
[42:43] he tries to do i remember brother
[42:44] biscuit spoke the message one time
[42:46] land for peace and that's what satan
[42:50] tries to do he wants you to give your
[42:51] promised land
[42:53] and he promises you peace but he brings
[42:55] destruction
[42:57] and we look at this as it is because as
[42:59] we talk about the bible approach
[43:01] you know the bible approaching the
[43:03] prophet made it so simple for us
[43:06] in our walk with christ he said if you
[43:08] want to get closer to god
[43:10] read your bible and pray amen
[43:14] he said prayer is the greatest weapon
[43:17] we have oh i'm so thankful for that
[43:20] weapon tonight
[43:21] aren't you because the bible said when
[43:24] the weakest christian
[43:26] gets on his knees hail shakes
[43:30] and i challenge you tonight do a little
[43:33] shaking
[43:34] and then you'll do less quaking
[43:37] amen aren't you thankful for the grace
[43:39] of god look at the preparations
[43:41] i thought about this just for a minute
[43:43] about this look at you know when a
[43:44] when a surfer he is he's going out you
[43:48] know he
[43:48] begins to he's he's looking for the
[43:50] waves you know he's not
[43:51] you know he can't plan the ways when
[43:53] they come or how high they're going to
[43:55] be or what they're going to face
[43:57] but you know he has a preparation plan
[44:00] he you know he waxes his board and
[44:02] you know he sits out there and he's
[44:04] waiting for those you know for those
[44:06] waves to come along to ride them
[44:09] you know and he he if he is prepared to
[44:11] do this
[44:13] if he has been trained and taught the
[44:15] way to do this
[44:16] he'll be able to ride those waves many
[44:18] people have a plan that they can do this
[44:21] a lot of people plan that they oh yes i
[44:23] can i can live this message
[44:25] but you cannot live this message because
[44:27] it takes the holy ghost to live the
[44:29] message through you
[44:30] a lot of people have a plan that i'm
[44:32] going to be a christian i'm going to
[44:34] turn over a new leaf
[44:35] i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[44:37] that i'm going to do better but
[44:38] it's more than a plan it's a preparation
[44:42] god is preparing a bride tonight god is
[44:46] preparing us for a rapture
[44:48] he has a preparation for us i like what
[44:50] the prophet said god said
[44:52] he said god requires us he has one
[44:55] way of escape and that's through jesus
[44:58] christ
[44:58] only one provided way and i'm thankful
[45:02] that we have received that way
[45:04] i believe with all my heart this message
[45:06] is nothing more than jesus christ
[45:10] well you see we don't you know we don't
[45:12] know
[45:14] what the future holds for us a lot of
[45:16] people are planning for the future
[45:18] they're getting paranoid they're
[45:20] stocking up bullets they're
[45:21] stocking up food what good will that do
[45:23] when they come and take it from you
[45:26] because my bible tells me who can make
[45:29] war
[45:30] with the beast or its image you me
[45:33] let me tell you there's only one here
[45:35] tonight that can make war with the
[45:37] pieces
[45:37] and that's god almighty and that
[45:40] is who we're serving tonight that's the
[45:43] one
[45:44] that has a plan of escape from me and
[45:46] you
[45:47] he has a provided way for me in you we
[45:50] see that
[45:51] you know the the the surfer he don't
[45:54] know
[45:54] when the winds are coming or when the
[45:56] storms are coming
[45:58] but he's prepared he is preparing
[46:00] himself
[46:01] to to ride you know i like this uh
[46:05] oh everybody says you know we say this
[46:06] many times you know
[46:08] you you know you want to get god to
[46:10] laugh
[46:11] you just tell him your plans for your
[46:13] life
[46:15] i'm glad god laughed at my plan because
[46:18] my plan was way off the mark
[46:21] my plan was missing it by a million
[46:23] miles
[46:24] so i'm glad that god has given us this
[46:27] opportunity
[46:28] to receive the word of god proverbs 19
[46:32] 21
[46:32] says devices devices in man's heart
[46:38] never did let never the less
[46:41] the counsel of the lord that shall stand
[46:46] you know no matter what device in our
[46:48] mind because the
[46:49] apostle paul told us he said casting
[46:51] down the imaginations
[46:53] and bring every thought into the
[46:54] obedience of jesus christ
[46:56] you know why they didn't accept jesus
[46:58] christ because he didn't come
[46:59] the way they planned if they would have
[47:02] been prepared
[47:04] they would have received him because
[47:06] those that received him was prepared to
[47:08] receive him
[47:12] we see over in the book turn women to
[47:13] the book of proverbs just for a minute i
[47:15] i'm trying to move fastly proverbs 16.
[47:20] do you still love the lord oh i tell you
[47:22] this is so real
[47:28] this is this is so rich for us proverbs
[47:30] 16 it says
[47:32] a man's heart deviseth his way
[47:36] but the lord directeth his steps
[47:39] oh and you're glad you have direction
[47:41] tonight aren't you aren't you glad that
[47:43] god sent us a message that has directed
[47:45] mind in your
[47:46] steps that has brought us in the
[47:49] presence of god
[47:51] in such a way that he has revealed
[47:53] himself to us
[47:55] in the message things that ought to be
[47:58] 1965 he says
[47:59] what is science preparing for you
[48:03] where did they say this cove with virus

[48:07] brother branham already warned us that
[48:09] they would start germ warfare
[48:12] he said be prepared have
[48:15] the token and the bible promises those
[48:19] that love and fear he'll protect him he
[48:21] said he encamps
[48:22] his angels around them so he already has
[48:25] a plan
[48:25] of protection for us if we'll be
[48:28] prepared
[48:29] by praying and reading our bible like we
[48:31] should
[48:33] don't ever lose your love for christ

[48:38] is science preparing for you
[48:39] more death that's right
[48:42] spudniks on everything to scatter death
[48:46] and everything across the earth he said
[48:49] don't look to that
[48:51] turn your head higher than that
[48:54] towards heaven he said look where jesus
[48:57] sits
[48:58] on the right hand of god tonight ever
[49:01] living to make
[49:02] intercessions on our confession what
[49:04] about the
[49:05] intercessions on our confessions

[49:12] we believe his word he we
[49:15] our you know he he didn't ask me and you
[49:18] yeah to understand everything

[49:28] everywhere information
[49:29] everybody you want to go and you say
[49:30] well i i need to know what this is i
[49:32] need to know what that is
[49:34] and when we didn't have all that we
[49:35] didn't have the need tonight
[49:37] amen ever since the tree of knowledge
[49:40] has come
[49:40] man has had a desire to know and
[49:44] fail to see god by wanting to know they
[49:47] didn't want to know the right things
[49:48] they wanted to know knowledge
[49:50] they wanted to become as gods there was
[49:53] already gods
[49:55] they took a lesser lesser position
[49:59] because what they accepted and that's
[50:01] what caused all of us to fall into this
[50:03] chaos same message and things that ought
[50:05] to be he said you

[50:20] the holy spirit
[50:21] right we need to come and take things
[50:25] lightly
[50:26] i'm thankful that god has given us the
[50:28] ability to be partakers of him
[50:30] how are you partaker of him by receiving
[50:32] his spirit in your heart

[51:34] vulcanized to him
[51:36] i have a need to lay on the breast of el

[51:44] and i know he's good
[51:46] he said how many here once more of god
[51:47] he said the congregation says amen
[51:50] he said why he said it goes to show that

[52:27] the hearts of the fathers back to the
[52:29] children

[53:16] to be
[53:20] god does the planning
[53:24] he expects us to be prepared let's turn
[53:27] to jeremiah just for a minute
[53:29] jeremiah 29
[53:32] 29 start at verse 11.
[53:36] listen to this god already had a plan
[53:39] for jeremiah
[53:41] jeremiah didn't have a god already had
[53:44] had a preparation had a plan for him he
[53:47] just needed jeremiah to be ready
[53:49] to be prepared for the journey amen
[53:53] verse 11 says in jeremiah 21 says for i
[53:57] know
[53:58] the thoughts that i think towards you
[54:00] saith the lord
[54:02] thoughts of peace and not evil
[54:06] to give you an expectation
[54:11] what are you expecting of your end as a
[54:14] christian
[54:15] just to die and go into the grave
[54:18] i'm expecting to be in a rapture
[54:21] [Applause]
[54:22] and if the grave was to take me it's not
[54:24] going to keep me
[54:26] right like the old brother used to
[54:28] saying brother willie terry ain't no
[54:29] grave
[54:30] gonna hold my body down
[54:35] he said there was a sleep oh hallelujah
[54:40] he said listen expect it in then
[54:43] shall you call upon me he said i'm gonna
[54:46] he said my oh i love that thoughts of
[54:49] peace
[54:50] not evil to give you and expect it in
[54:53] then shall you call upon me
[54:55] and you shall go and pray unto me
[54:58] and i will hearken unto you and you
[55:02] shall
[55:02] seek me and find me
[55:05] when you shall search for me with all
[55:08] your heart
[55:11] that's what he desires he said seek ye
[55:14] first the kingdom of god
[55:15] amen and all his righteousness
[55:19] and everything will be added unto you
[55:21] see we try to get
[55:22] ahead of the pain the plan we want to
[55:26] receive all this will be added first
[55:30] but he has a plan seek ye first
[55:34] in other words put me first let me be
[55:37] the centerpiece of your life
[55:39] let me be the lord of your life not just
[55:42] god
[55:43] but lord there are many gods but there's
[55:45] only one
[55:46] lord jesus christ there's only one lord
[55:49] one faith one baptism
[55:51] can you imagine how it would be if there
[55:54] was two
[55:56] with two there would be two opinions
[55:59] there would be two ways
[56:00] but he said i'm going to make it so easy
[56:02] that you won't stumble at it
[56:05] oh hallelujah notice that god doesn't
[56:09] say let me know what your plan is
[56:13] what your plans are and i'll bless you
[56:17] god's not asking jeremiah let me know
[56:19] what your plans is and i'll bless you
[56:22] he's telling you i have an expected end
[56:24] for you
[56:26] be prepared for the journey
[56:33] preparing involves calling upon the lord
[56:36] coming to jesus in a relationship
[56:39] praying
[56:40] seeking the lord with all your heart he
[56:43] said seek me with all your heart
[56:46] listen i love this right here
[56:49] our faith is not
[56:52] one more item on our to-do list
[56:56] our faith is not one more item and on
[56:58] our to-do list
[56:59] our faith forms our to-do list
[57:04] our faith prepares us for the to-do list
[57:09] oh glory to god
[57:13] look at the 10 ver all the 10 virgins
[57:17] for the wedding with the lamps
[57:21] with lamps in expectation
[57:25] you know i like what charles spurgeon
[57:27] said
[57:29] he said i don't i don't want to a lamp
[57:32] just a lamp profession with not a
[57:35] without at all possession
[57:40] many people have seen the lamp many
[57:43] people carry the lamp
[57:45] but only a few have the possession of
[57:48] the oil
[57:50] it's more than a profession it's a
[57:52] possession
[57:53] do you know that your condition does not
[57:56] determine your position
[57:59] for many are the reflections of the
[58:01] righteous but i
[58:02] am why like that that conjunction word
[58:05] but i am
[58:06] the lord thy god that delivereth
[58:09] them out of them
[58:12] sometimes oh
[58:15] that's good enough for me he didn't say
[58:18] we wouldn't go through it
[58:19] he said i'll bring you out of it it
[58:21] didn't come to stay
[58:22] come to leave and when it leaves it
[58:25] gives you a testimony
[58:27] how can you have a test demoni without a
[58:30] test
[58:31] a test brings a testimony and you know
[58:34] sometimes
[58:35] we don't realize that during the test
[58:38] is when the teacher is the quietest
[58:45] he don't have to tell you how you're
[58:46] doing you just keep
[58:48] taking the test and say lord be it unto
[58:51] me
[58:52] according to thy word amen no hallelujah
[58:56] he said we look at this
[58:59] we could never guess look at this
[59:03] if we just went a lot of people said
[59:04] well the message is just
[59:06] long dress long hair this
[59:09] do's and don'ts do you know that that
[59:12] the foolish
[59:13] had the same apparel they had the same
[59:16] lamp they had the same wedding garment
[59:20] they had all the same but they failed to
[59:23] have the oil
[59:26] it's not the dress that sets us apart
[59:30] from the foolish it's the oil
[59:33] that separates us from the hallelujah
[59:38] the foolish were on their own timetable
[59:42] i'll do it when i really need it
[59:46] instead of preparing for the journey
[59:51] he said let your lamps be trimmed and
[59:53] full
[59:55] and see when the the wise caught that
[59:58] revelation
[59:59] they said lord i don't want to run out
[1:00:02] keep me
[1:00:03] full every day keep my lamp trimmed
[1:00:07] lord sometimes i may get sleepy and
[1:00:10] slawful because of this age
[1:00:12] but lord don't let me go to sleep
[1:00:14] without no oil
[1:00:16] hallelujah god will not let us
[1:00:19] sleep without oil that's our his
[1:00:22] predestinated bride
[1:00:24] she may have been intoxicated by this
[1:00:27] laodicean spirit
[1:00:28] she may have slept she may have
[1:00:31] slumbered
[1:00:32] but she didn't lose her oil and she was
[1:00:34] not
[1:00:35] willing to give it up many are willing
[1:00:39] to give up
[1:00:40] but not the bride oh hallelujah
[1:00:45] if they were just see they was not
[1:00:47] prepared

[1:01:06] prepared to go through the process
[1:01:10] oh hallelujah the foolish
[1:01:14] they they had planned a certain time
[1:01:18] a time when they were
[1:01:21] just you know i like this can i say it
[1:01:22] like this right here tonight the foolish
[1:01:25] remind me of a fan instead of a follower
[1:01:30] that's what i believe around the message
[1:01:31] a lot of people we're finding out that
[1:01:32] we thought was followers
[1:01:34] of this message are really fans
[1:01:39] and it's not going the way they planned
[1:01:44] so guess what what is a fan an
[1:01:46] enthusiastic
[1:01:48] admirer we're not here admiring it
[1:01:51] we're here absorbing it we're being
[1:01:54] partakers of it
[1:01:56] hallelujah this is not a game this is
[1:01:59] not a sport
[1:02:00] this is life and death amen
[1:02:06] oh glory to god what does the word
[1:02:09] preparation mean
[1:02:11] the action or process
[1:02:14] of making ready are you making yourself
[1:02:18] ready
[1:02:19] the bible even commissioned us he said
[1:02:22] the bride
[1:02:22] hath made herself ready why she has
[1:02:27] wrote herself in his word she has
[1:02:30] received his
[1:02:30] all his life his holy spirit she's
[1:02:33] prepared
[1:02:35] for the journey amen why would you go on
[1:02:39] a camping trip
[1:02:40] and not bring supplies
[1:02:44] why would you go anywhere and not be why
[1:02:47] would you get in your car
[1:02:48] on a trip and not put gas in it
[1:02:53] it's the same perspiration with christ
[1:02:55] you know why we don't receive more when
[1:02:57] we're in church
[1:02:58] it's because we don't prepare before we
[1:03:00] get here
[1:03:03] it's a preparation program said we need
[1:03:06] to be prayed up
[1:03:07] when we come here not just planned up
[1:03:11] right we need to be prayed up we need to
[1:03:15] take time and say god
[1:03:16] i need something because our times
[1:03:18] sister debbie is running out
[1:03:21] we're not going to have this opportunity
[1:03:22] very much longer you better make the
[1:03:25] best of it
[1:03:27] what if this is the glory be to god what
[1:03:30] if this night
[1:03:31] is the last time they allow us to come
[1:03:34] together
[1:03:35] but i want to tell you something right
[1:03:37] there
[1:03:38] when abraham had communion
[1:03:41] with melchizedek with the bread and the
[1:03:43] wine that's
[1:03:44] when the promised sign was spoken
[1:03:48] oh hallelujah this could be the last
[1:03:50] time
[1:03:51] we take communion now what's
[1:03:55] what is god's promise this promised son
[1:03:58] coming taking his wife on oh hallelujah
[1:04:02] aren't you thankful for the grace of god
[1:04:05] we just don't need a
[1:04:06] lamp profession we need all
[1:04:09] possession it says making ready
[1:04:13] or being made ready
[1:04:17] for us god has
[1:04:21] making us ready through giving us this
[1:04:24] message
[1:04:25] turn with me to john chapter 17.
[1:04:30] verse starts at verse 17. oh i love the
[1:04:32] script
[1:04:33] this right here i take this and you know
[1:04:35] that brother brown said that
[1:04:37] the the word of god will defeat satan
[1:04:39] anytime anywhere
[1:04:42] any place under any circumstance
[1:04:46] 17 17. look at this right here
[1:04:50] this oh look at the preparation
[1:04:54] jesus did for us let's look at this
[1:04:56] starting in verse 17.
[1:05:00] let's see listen to this sanctify them
[1:05:04] through thy truth thy word what a
[1:05:07] message
[1:05:08] of sanctification what a message of
[1:05:11] placing us
[1:05:12] in the scriptures showing you your
[1:05:14] position in christ
[1:05:15] that's what this message did he said for
[1:05:19] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[1:05:22] is truth
[1:05:23] listen to this and he says as thou has
[1:05:26] sent me
[1:05:27] into the world even so have i also
[1:05:30] sent them into the world and for
[1:05:33] their sakes who says
[1:05:37] our saints he said i
[1:05:40] sanctify myself that they also
[1:05:43] might be sanctified through the truth
[1:05:47] what a message this message was truth
[1:05:50] disprove this message with the bible
[1:05:52] you cannot do it there's nothing that
[1:05:55] matches it
[1:05:56] amen no hallelujah
[1:05:59] amen listen to this i love i use this on
[1:06:02] the devil all the time
[1:06:03] verse 20 neither pray i for
[1:06:06] these alone but for them which also
[1:06:10] shall believe on me
[1:06:11] through their word god had to send a
[1:06:14] word
[1:06:14] for us to believe through he had to send
[1:06:17] somebody
[1:06:19] somebody had to come and bring the word
[1:06:22] so god always uses a prophet to bring
[1:06:25] the word to us
[1:06:28] it was like the eunuch when the unit was
[1:06:30] there reading
[1:06:31] reading the scrolls of isaiah
[1:06:34] and here here is philip in this great
[1:06:38] revival
[1:06:40] it looked like well that was the plan to
[1:06:41] be there but there was one that needed
[1:06:44] needed instruction so he was prepared
[1:06:49] for the journey so he just got plucked
[1:06:51] up and sat there and there was that
[1:06:52] eunuch
[1:06:53] and he said oh i love this i use this on
[1:06:56] on many people
[1:06:57] understand this thou what thou read us
[1:07:02] how many people has read this bible how
[1:07:04] many how many men has come and poked and
[1:07:06] prodded at this
[1:07:08] i love the answer of the eunuch he said
[1:07:11] how
[1:07:12] can i understand except a man show me
[1:07:16] glory be to god the holy ghost is a
[1:07:18] person
[1:07:22] oh glory to god he said look
[1:07:25] verse 21 said that they all may be one
[1:07:29] as thou father art in me
[1:07:32] and i in thee that they also may be one
[1:07:35] in
[1:07:35] us that the world may believe that thou
[1:07:39] hast sent me do you believe he said if
[1:07:42] you don't believe
[1:07:43] me believe the words
[1:07:47] for they are eternal life
[1:07:51] he said search the scriptures for
[1:07:53] anything you think
[1:07:55] you have eternal life but they are they
[1:07:57] they testify
[1:07:58] of me oh hallelujah what a more sure a
[1:08:02] word we have
[1:08:03] what a promise what a what a
[1:08:07] what a magnificent revelation
[1:08:10] what was this man what is the message to
[1:08:12] us it's the mighty god
[1:08:14] unveiled it's the invisible union
[1:08:17] of the bridegroom oh glory
[1:08:21] the action or process of making ready
[1:08:25] modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:08:27] again he said
[1:08:28] if we know the hour we're living in
[1:08:32] then we can't prepare for it if it
[1:08:34] wasn't god's sense of profit
[1:08:35] everything was looking when we was it
[1:08:38] looked bad then
[1:08:40] little did we know it was going to get
[1:08:41] worse we really had
[1:08:43] we really had no idea what i was going
[1:08:45] to go on we would be like other people
[1:08:48] thinking well
[1:08:49] god's in control you know he brought us
[1:08:51] through eight
[1:08:52] eight years of this regime in four years
[1:08:55] of this one
[1:08:56] how come he came bring us through four
[1:08:57] more
[1:09:00] and fail to see the signs fail to be
[1:09:03] prepared
[1:09:04] to recognize your day in this message
[1:09:07] that's where people fail to recognize
[1:09:09] their day and their message
[1:09:12] he said then we can prepare for the ire
[1:09:16] but if we go in blindly then jesus said
[1:09:19] if the blind lead the blind they'll all
[1:09:21] fall into the ditch
[1:09:22] i'd hate to be following a blind man
[1:09:24] trying to lead me through the scriptures
[1:09:27] it took a prophet what is the prophet
[1:09:29] it's the seer the
[1:09:30] eyes the eyes
[1:09:34] god send us the understanding of the
[1:09:36] word that we might see more clearly paul
[1:09:38] said i look
[1:09:39] through a stained glass that's what now
[1:09:42] we see clearly
[1:09:44] god has removed this he i tell you i
[1:09:47] cannot say enough about this message
[1:09:49] it is the it is the glasses
[1:09:52] to see the word amen god didn't
[1:09:56] write his word in braille for blind
[1:09:58] people
[1:10:00] he give us i saved to see his word
[1:10:04] that's what this message is to me as i
[1:10:05] say i tell you it's a gold mine
[1:10:09] i'm a prospector oh i get in there and i
[1:10:11] get lost
[1:10:12] there's so many nuggets i can't even
[1:10:14] keep up with them i'm just polishing
[1:10:16] then packing
[1:10:16] polishing the packet preparing for the
[1:10:20] journey
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:25] so father listen to this so father we
[1:10:29] pray
[1:10:31] you let us see the ark there
[1:10:34] the door open the message is calling us
[1:10:38] in what is the art it's not a boat
[1:10:40] anymore it's christ
[1:10:43] christ is our ark right now in him
[1:10:47] he said he is the cliff and the rock
[1:10:50] that the righteous can run there and be
[1:10:51] saved
[1:10:52] oh hallelujah i'll tell you preparation
[1:10:56] we must be prepared for this journey
[1:11:01] if you're on a run running you have to
[1:11:03] train yourself and prepare
[1:11:05] for the long distance but you know what
[1:11:07] god sent us a word in this hour
[1:11:09] that we would be able to run the
[1:11:10] distance we would be able to carry
[1:11:13] the baton of truth in this hour
[1:11:17] we find out and in the message isaiah 40
[1:11:21] also vindicated look at this
[1:11:24] john he said a voice of one crying in
[1:11:27] the wilderness
[1:11:28] prepare the way of the lord make his
[1:11:31] past straight
[1:11:32] he said the church did not believe him
[1:11:35] for he was not of their group
[1:11:37] he was not part of their plan right
[1:11:40] brother i said this message did not come
[1:11:43] to the world and come to the bride
[1:11:47] it's not a social event it's a
[1:11:50] revelation
[1:11:51] things that ought to be he said i look
[1:11:54] daily
[1:11:55] for him i watch
[1:11:58] keeping myself prepared for that hour
[1:12:02] are you prepared for the hour amen
[1:12:05] listen to this in in first corinthians
[1:12:08] chapter 14.
[1:12:09] let's turn there just for a minute let
[1:12:11] me see if
[1:12:13] oh yeah i'm trying
[1:12:16] god is so good how many people
[1:12:21] have started this journey without a
[1:12:24] preparation
[1:12:26] without a born-again experience with god
[1:12:30] they can receive it on their flesh every
[1:12:32] day of their life
[1:12:34] and die and go to hell yeah it's not
[1:12:37] it's not a stimulate not i know i love
[1:12:39] it when it
[1:12:40] when it comes and it makes you shout
[1:12:41] scream speak in tongues all that but you
[1:12:44] know what that's not
[1:12:45] that's not just that's not that's not it
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:48] when it changes the nature in your heart
[1:12:52] and it takes away the desire and the
[1:12:54] water
[1:12:56] you say you can do this you have the
[1:12:57] rights you're under freedom or let you
[1:12:59] do what you want to
[1:13:00] but when god comes in there sister gene
[1:13:02] he takes away the wonky
[1:13:05] you know why i don't do it because i
[1:13:06] don't want to because i don't want to do
[1:13:08] anything
[1:13:09] to hurt him because he done everything
[1:13:12] he took my hurt
[1:13:13] he took my shame he took everything and
[1:13:16] nailed it to a cross
[1:13:18] why would i want to shame him by
[1:13:21] disbelieving him
[1:13:23] no hallelujah 14 started verse 8.
[1:13:28] listen to this he said for if a trumpet
[1:13:31] give an uncertain sound who shall
[1:13:33] prepare himself from battle
[1:13:35] and she could have god the same
[1:13:39] i love that because you know what the
[1:13:40] bible said my sheep know my voice
[1:13:43] and a stranger they won't follow the
[1:13:46] trumpet has sound what is the trumpet
[1:13:48] oh hallelujah it's a message he
[1:13:52] if it give an uncertain sound who can
[1:13:54] prepare
[1:13:56] ain't you glad that god has prepared us
[1:13:58] for this hour
[1:13:59] has made us ready by his love and grace
[1:14:04] verse 9 says so likewise ye except ye
[1:14:07] utter by
[1:14:08] the tongue words easy to be understood
[1:14:11] how shall it be known what is spoken
[1:14:14] for ye shall speak into the air aren't
[1:14:17] you glad god's in
[1:14:19] fourth grade easy to understand spoke
[1:14:23] the common man's language
[1:14:25] who received him gladly the common man
[1:14:27] yeah amen
[1:14:29] what did jesus speak the common man's
[1:14:32] language
[1:14:33] and they received him gladly amen
[1:14:36] have you received this matches with
[1:14:38] gladness if you're answer you're really
[1:14:41] not prepared
[1:14:43] you just think you are even though you
[1:14:44] may recognize
[1:14:46] but until you realize you'll never be
[1:14:49] part of it
[1:14:51] there's a difference between recognizing
[1:14:53] and realizing
[1:14:55] realizing that you're part of it it's
[1:14:57] not a history story
[1:14:59] but when you become part of it it's a
[1:15:02] realization to you
[1:15:03] it's a living reality living in your
[1:15:05] heart
[1:15:07] oh hallelujah luke 1 17 says and he
[1:15:09] shall go
[1:15:10] before him in the spirit and the power
[1:15:13] of elias
[1:15:14] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:15:17] children
[1:15:18] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:15:21] just to make ready
[1:15:23] a people prepared for the lord
[1:15:27] they tell what this message did john
[1:15:28] look at the look at the beautiful
[1:15:31] parallel with this message in the
[1:15:33] message of john the baptist
[1:15:34] amen look at the parallels that
[1:15:38] come to prepare the people for the
[1:15:41] coming of the lord
[1:15:42] that's what this message has prepared us
[1:15:44] for
[1:15:46] john did his part people say oh john the
[1:15:49] baptist fulfilled all of malachi 4.
[1:15:51] no he didn't because it never said he'd
[1:15:53] turn the hearts
[1:15:55] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:15:57] fathers
[1:15:58] people failed to see that there is a
[1:16:01] conjunction there john did what he do
[1:16:04] but
[1:16:05] behold i send them to you
[1:16:08] elijah the prophet personal to you

[1:16:49] preparation that was going

[1:21:46] starting at verse five let's look he
[1:21:47] said a sower went out
[1:21:49] to sow his seed and as he sowed some
[1:21:53] some fell by the wayside and was trodden
[1:21:56] down
[1:21:56] and the fowls of the air devoured it and
[1:21:59] some fell upon
[1:22:01] a rock and as soon as it sprung up
[1:22:04] it withered away because it lacked
[1:22:07] moisture
[1:22:08] you ever been around people that lack
[1:22:10] moisture
[1:22:11] the joy of the lord i'm a christian
[1:22:16] i went to church today i said my
[1:22:20] somebody needs some water oh
[1:22:23] cactus take a drink
[1:22:27] represent said if they would if the
[1:22:28] water would be there in in the desert
[1:22:30] that old sticky would turn into a leaf i
[1:22:34] said just
[1:22:35] emerge yourself in the washing of the
[1:22:37] water the word
[1:22:38] and you won't be so sticky
[1:22:42] we don't need sticky christians we need
[1:22:44] christians with love and peace and joy
[1:22:46] in their heart lack moisture and some
[1:22:49] fell among thorns
[1:22:51] and the thorns sprang up with it
[1:22:54] and choked it what was that
[1:22:58] jesus said the cares of this life
[1:23:01] you know the sea can come and if you let
[1:23:03] the cares of this life
[1:23:05] override what you've received it will
[1:23:07] choke out
[1:23:08] the sea oh my how dangerous it
[1:23:12] is we live in he said i like this verse
[1:23:16] eight
[1:23:17] and other fell on good ground and sprang
[1:23:19] up
[1:23:20] and bear fruit in a hundred fold and
[1:23:22] when he had
[1:23:23] said these things he cried he
[1:23:27] that happened here's to here let him
[1:23:29] hear
[1:23:31] you know some of the grain
[1:23:34] you know some of the grain
[1:23:37] fell on ground and the birds plucked it
[1:23:40] up
[1:23:40] others fell among thorns and was choked
[1:23:42] out by the cares of this life
[1:23:44] but you know what there was a place of
[1:23:46] the ground
[1:23:47] as the sowing process was going that it
[1:23:49] was already
[1:23:50] prepared
[1:23:53] your heart has to be prepared
[1:23:57] for the word when we come to the house
[1:23:58] of god your heart must be prepared
[1:24:01] for the sowing of the word oh hallelujah
[1:24:06] he said prepared ground brother brown
[1:24:07] said when he said
[1:24:09] and some went on prepared ground
[1:24:12] pre-prepared ground i like that not just
[1:24:15] prepared ground
[1:24:16] pre-prepared ground that shows
[1:24:18] predestination
[1:24:22] and brought forth god's word is a seed
[1:24:29] the ground must be prepared
[1:24:32] before the word what is the
[1:24:36] what is the things that went out what

[1:24:44] in this hour it was a message for the
[1:24:47] people to get ready for the coming of

[1:25:00] supper of the lamb

[1:27:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:13] he hadn't left us unprepared hey man
[1:27:20] god bless you can be seated
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:29] wow what a word
[1:27:34] you know i've um throughout the whole
[1:27:37] day
[1:27:39] have had a thing on my heart that i've
[1:27:42] just kind of been
[1:27:43] preparing as we come to the
[1:27:47] to the lord's supper and i just
[1:27:50] was left rather astonished at how very
[1:27:54] tracking right along brother richie's
[1:27:57] sermon was tonight with the burden
[1:27:59] that's been on my heart
[1:28:02] and um then even just as i was um
[1:28:06] sitting there listening and then another
[1:28:08] confirmation came in so i know it's the
[1:28:10] lord
[1:28:11] amen you know
[1:28:15] we're going to take the lord's supper
[1:28:17] just in a few minutes
[1:28:18] this okay i could just give you my heart
[1:28:20] for a few minutes yes
[1:28:22] i'm gonna do it anyway
[1:28:26] amen you know i
[1:28:30] we we come up here and we we take the
[1:28:33] lord's supper we take the wine and the
[1:28:35] bread and the
[1:28:38] you know there's a lot of care and
[1:28:40] preparation
[1:28:43] that go into there's a lot of a lot of
[1:28:45] preparing
[1:28:46] as brother richie was talking about
[1:28:50] and you know now and that doesn't
[1:28:53] that doesn't set us apart from other
[1:28:55] churches that take the lord's supper
[1:28:58] they have a lot of preparing too they do
[1:29:00] it in different ways
[1:29:02] i've seen i've seen ways before that
[1:29:05] were so sacrilegious that
[1:29:07] i was a visitor and uh
[1:29:10] had a way back in the day years ago had
[1:29:12] a friend of mine that we worked with and
[1:29:14] kind of made one of those deals
[1:29:15] i'll come to your church if you'll come
[1:29:16] to mind
[1:29:18] don't make those deals because they
[1:29:19] don't keep them amen i kept my
[1:29:22] side of it he never did show up
[1:29:25] i think he thought i'd become a mormon
[1:29:27] and he wouldn't have to show up at my
[1:29:28] church
[1:29:30] but it didn't work out that way because
[1:29:31] god god already had a plan for my life
[1:29:35] and it wasn't going to be that thank you
[1:29:38] jesus
[1:29:39] and you know it was so it was so really
[1:29:42] just so irreverent that i wouldn't even
[1:29:45] the lord even spoke to me very directly
[1:29:48] you you not only will you not take it
[1:29:49] when they come to you won't even look at
[1:29:51] it
[1:29:52] and when they step to my status looked
[1:29:53] away and they moved on
[1:29:56] i believe that the lord's supper is a
[1:29:59] solemn
[1:30:00] amen thing and it means something
[1:30:03] it's not just uh it's not just
[1:30:06] religiosity
[1:30:07] it's not just a form you know it's not
[1:30:10] just some ritual
[1:30:12] no sir there's no magic
[1:30:15] potion in these little wine cups
[1:30:18] there's no incantation we don't
[1:30:21] transform this bread into anything
[1:30:23] no sir that's that's
[1:30:26] babylonian heathenism that's exactly
[1:30:29] right brother
[1:30:31] but it does have tremendous
[1:30:33] representation hallelujah
[1:30:37] i thought about that
[1:30:42] that scripture that brother richie was
[1:30:44] referring to there is one of my favorite
[1:30:46] passages
[1:30:47] where jesus said sanctify them by thy
[1:30:49] truth thy word is truth
[1:30:51] so how do you get a sanctified life by
[1:30:53] feeding on the word
[1:30:56] amen see the the remember friends don't
[1:31:00] lose sight of the parable the seed that
[1:31:02] was being sown that jesus talks about
[1:31:05] that's the gospel amen jesus called it a
[1:31:08] seed
[1:31:08] and it's good seed i want you to
[1:31:11] understand that the gospel is good seed
[1:31:13] friend
[1:31:14] you can put your bank your life on it
[1:31:17] that's exactly right
[1:31:19] but it it falls in in ground and that's
[1:31:22] the people hearing the gospel that's you
[1:31:24] amen that's anybody and so you know
[1:31:28] even even certain ground where the seed
[1:31:31] falls in
[1:31:34] you know that ground is not
[1:31:38] dedicated to just receiving the seed
[1:31:41] alone
[1:31:43] that ground also has thorns that grow in
[1:31:46] it and you know where that comes from
[1:31:47] because we haven't sanctified our lives
[1:31:51] because the way you sanctify your life
[1:31:52] is by feeding on the word
[1:31:54] which is the body which is what the
[1:31:55] bread represents exactly right
[1:31:58] amen you're following me
[1:32:01] but you know we it this this area of
[1:32:05] ground
[1:32:06] is like that person that's kind of a
[1:32:08] mixed betting ground
[1:32:09] they feed on the word but they also feed
[1:32:11] on the world
[1:32:12] and the seed of the word comes up but
[1:32:14] the seed of the world comes right up and
[1:32:16] chokes it right down
[1:32:17] and you just never really produce
[1:32:19] anything for the lord
[1:32:23] i want you to realize tonight when you
[1:32:25] come to take this bread and this wine
[1:32:27] this
[1:32:27] represents something it's not magic
[1:32:31] there's there it's not anything special
[1:32:34] we we prepare it in a special way
[1:32:38] but it it's it's like you can't go to
[1:32:40] the to the
[1:32:41] water and because you were baptized in
[1:32:44] water that gives you the new birth
[1:32:46] that water only is a is an answer to
[1:32:48] your conscience
[1:32:49] of a good testimony that you've already
[1:32:51] you've already believed the word
[1:32:53] and so you go to the water as your first
[1:32:55] act of obedience
[1:32:56] the first of many acts of obedience
[1:33:00] but the water doesn't save you no sir
[1:33:03] this bread and this wine isn't going to
[1:33:05] do one thing for you
[1:33:07] if you don't absorb and take ownership
[1:33:10] of what it stands for
[1:33:12] and it stands for his body his broken
[1:33:15] body that was broken for you
[1:33:18] and his blood in the new testament which
[1:33:21] in the blood is the life so it's the
[1:33:22] holy ghost
[1:33:24] amen and i i was thinking all day today
[1:33:31] i thought lord i don't even
[1:33:36] i can't even get my i can't even
[1:33:40] i can't figure out how to put a
[1:33:43] how would i equal the value of
[1:33:46] the word that we have today
[1:33:50] in this message amen
[1:33:54] this message that we feed on
[1:33:58] you're coming to take bread but i'm here
[1:34:00] to tell you something friends
[1:34:01] you're already feeding on
[1:34:06] i'll say this that that this feeding and
[1:34:09] that feeding ought to be the same
[1:34:12] they ought to be ken you ought not to be
[1:34:15] feeding on this if you're not feeding on
[1:34:17] that
[1:34:19] amen does that make sense god has sent
[1:34:23] this word
[1:34:23] and this message and it has
[1:34:27] every thing every purifying element
[1:34:30] in it and i just thought to myself lord
[1:34:34] you know it it it begs the question i
[1:34:37] i have to ask myself
[1:34:41] i mean i wouldn't want to i wouldn't
[1:34:42] want to come up here
[1:34:44] and you know sister gene has
[1:34:48] labored to prepare the bread and brother
[1:34:51] luther has taken care
[1:34:53] with the wine and and you know and we
[1:34:56] come up here and we uncover it
[1:34:58] and we find all kinds of other items up
[1:35:00] here you know that
[1:35:02] sister gene and brother luther thought
[1:35:03] well this might be good to throw this
[1:35:05] into no
[1:35:05] we want the pure form right here i want
[1:35:08] exactly the word formula
[1:35:10] and i don't want any contaminants and i
[1:35:12] don't want any other thing there i want
[1:35:14] exactly what he
[1:35:15] what he did and told me to do and that's
[1:35:17] exactly why i'm here
[1:35:19] and and when i'm feeding on the body
[1:35:21] word of the son of man
[1:35:23] i'm gonna tell you something friends i'm
[1:35:25] gonna
[1:35:26] i'm gonna take our text tonight from
[1:35:29] luke 22.
[1:35:30] turn there with me and i don't normally
[1:35:33] take luke i normally take first
[1:35:36] corinthians 11 or
[1:35:38] i have occasionally taken mark 14.
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:48] but i i just kept feeling strangely
[1:35:52] the lord just kept saying no not that
[1:35:55] keep going
[1:35:56] and i found myself i said well maybe
[1:35:59] he wants me to read it from luke and as
[1:36:00] soon as i read it
[1:36:02] i felt there it is now watch
[1:36:07] luke 22. verse 14.
[1:36:13] and when the hour was come
[1:36:16] he sat down and the twelve apostles with
[1:36:20] him
[1:36:21] and he said unto them with desire
[1:36:25] i have desired to eat this
[1:36:29] passover with you before i suffer
[1:36:32] it wasn't his first passover it wasn't
[1:36:35] their first passover
[1:36:36] they had been eating passover every year
[1:36:39] of their jewish life
[1:36:40] you understand that jesus had they had
[1:36:44] had the passover
[1:36:45] every year of his ministry so so so
[1:36:48] when you when you think about the
[1:36:50] passover jesus
[1:36:52] said it's not about any other passover
[1:36:55] i've ever had
[1:36:56] i've been waiting and waiting for this
[1:36:58] one
[1:37:01] because this is going to be the
[1:37:04] the it's going to be a first and the
[1:37:06] last it's going to be
[1:37:08] the last time i eat it
[1:37:11] with you and i won't ever eat it again
[1:37:15] until i eat it with you again in my
[1:37:17] father's kingdom
[1:37:20] so in that sense it's now the first
[1:37:23] passover
[1:37:24] for the church that's getting ready to
[1:37:26] be born and i'm here to tell you
[1:37:28] something friends you have arrived
[1:37:30] and i believe that we're looking at a
[1:37:32] passover and it might as brother richie
[1:37:34] said it might be tonight
[1:37:36] the lord's voice might echo through this
[1:37:38] building any minute and say
[1:37:40] i've been waiting for a while to eat
[1:37:42] this passover with you hallelujah
[1:37:45] amen pray lord we see prophecy
[1:37:48] unfolding with shocking
[1:37:52] clarity more clear
[1:37:55] than any of us i can tell you something
[1:37:58] friends
[1:37:59] just as as stunned as i am
[1:38:03] and we have been to say we're still here
[1:38:06] in 2021.
[1:38:08] equally or more so was i shocked to see
[1:38:11] brother branham's sixth vision fulfilled
[1:38:14] with
[1:38:14] such clarity such
[1:38:18] minute detail
[1:38:21] and i'm looking at an image that's on
[1:38:23] the news
[1:38:26] and i'm listen i'm reading brother
[1:38:27] branham's description and he says i saw
[1:38:30] it he's seeing a vision and i just said
[1:38:32] to some brothers i said
[1:38:33] now put yourself in a prophet's position
[1:38:36] put yourself in his shoes for a moment
[1:38:38] you're standing there looking at a
[1:38:40] vision and you're describing it this is
[1:38:42] going to take place
[1:38:44] and i said now look at that picture and
[1:38:47] find any detail that's not
[1:38:49] precisely what he described
[1:38:52] seeing even to the color of the
[1:38:56] garment that she's wearing
[1:39:02] we're almost home we're almost home

[1:44:04] heart
[1:44:05] has with your word oh i'm so
[1:44:09] glad that it does because
[1:44:12] no man can make himself love the word of
[1:44:15] god that is
[1:44:16] given sovereignly by god
[1:44:19] it is given by god to his family to love
[1:44:22] the word
[1:44:23] and i love the word and that's the
[1:44:25] greatest thing you could ever have done
[1:44:26] for me lord
[1:44:28] is i love your
[1:44:31] word i love your life
[1:44:34] i love i love your righteousness i love
[1:44:37] your lifestyle
[1:44:39] that's why i get grieved at myself if i
[1:44:42] find that my lifestyle doesn't match
[1:44:44] your lifestyle
[1:44:46] that's not what i'm here for lord i'm
[1:44:48] here to
[1:44:49] to carry on the testimony of jesus
[1:44:52] christ to the world
[1:44:54] if if the father if all that the father
[1:44:58] was he poured into you and then you
[1:45:00] acted just like him
[1:45:02] and then everything that you were you
[1:45:04] poured into us shouldn't we act just
[1:45:05] like you
[1:45:07] is not our lives to prove hebrews 13 8
[1:45:10] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:45:14] today and forever jesus christ is the
[1:45:16] same in the galilean
[1:45:18] as he is in the church he's identical
[1:45:22] he that same being that created
[1:45:25] everything that is
[1:45:27] when he lived in in the sonship of a man
[1:45:31] when that same life lives in the church
[1:45:33] we will live and conduct
[1:45:35] act and react the same ways that he did
[1:45:38] now lord thankfully
[1:45:42] you know that we being born in sin
[1:45:46] we'd never live it as perfect as you did
[1:45:48] and that's why you lived the perfective
[1:45:50] you lived that perceptive side for us
[1:45:54] so our faith is in that sacrifice and in
[1:45:56] that atonement
[1:45:58] and in that life that you lived and we
[1:46:00] know that if we do make a mistake
[1:46:03] that we do have an advocate with the
[1:46:05] father which is you
[1:46:06] christ jesus so tonight lord
[1:46:10] for for those here tonight who know
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:15] who know that they are firm believers
[1:46:18] and they love your word
[1:46:19] of course they make mistakes we all make
[1:46:22] mistakes
[1:46:23] but it's not in our heart to do it
[1:46:27] and so for that believer tonight that
[1:46:30] lord has made mistakes which is 100
[1:46:33] of every believer in here we confess
[1:46:36] them to you right now
[1:46:38] we commit our hearts and we rededicate
[1:46:40] ourselves and we purpose
[1:46:41] lord from this night that my life my
[1:46:44] diet
[1:46:44] going forward is going to be reflective
[1:46:46] of the supper i'm taking now
[1:46:50] this supper is very specifically
[1:46:55] laid out in the scripture we can't just
[1:46:57] do it any old way
[1:46:59] there's an exact way to do it
[1:47:02] and i i realize lord that there is an
[1:47:04] exact way
[1:47:05] to be sanctified there's an exact way to
[1:47:08] be an overcomer
[1:47:09] there's an exact way to have the power
[1:47:11] of god operating in your life
[1:47:13] and if we live outside of that exact way
[1:47:15] then it's no wonder we feel so powerless
[1:47:17] at times
[1:47:19] so lord help us now forgive us of all of
[1:47:22] our trespasses
[1:47:24] we come to take this supper humbly and
[1:47:26] soberly
[1:47:28] i want the people to realize what it
[1:47:30] means it's not just
[1:47:32] religiosity it's not just a ritual
[1:47:35] this is a type and a shadow a symbolism
[1:47:39] of the of the accuracy
[1:47:43] of the precise preciseness
[1:47:48] the precise way of the word that we
[1:47:51] ought to have in our lives
[1:47:54] may you grant it as we come lord if we
[1:47:58] paul said if we would if we would just
[1:48:01] judge ourselves
[1:48:02] then we won't be judged with the world
[1:48:05] so tonight may we how do we judge
[1:48:08] ourselves by humbling ourselves to every
[1:48:10] word of god
[1:48:11] and saying lord i'm going to judge
[1:48:12] myself and if i see something in my life
[1:48:14] that's contrary to your nature
[1:48:16] i'm going to stop i'm gonna get that out
[1:48:18] of my life i'm gonna judge my own self
[1:48:20] so that i don't get judged with the
[1:48:22] world
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:26] let a man examine himself
[1:48:29] and then once he's done that and met the
[1:48:32] requirement then
[1:48:33] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:48:35] that wine
[1:48:36] we commit it to you tonight lord in
[1:48:39] jesus name
[1:48:41] god bless you let this side begin to
[1:48:44] come forward
[1:48:45] at this time
