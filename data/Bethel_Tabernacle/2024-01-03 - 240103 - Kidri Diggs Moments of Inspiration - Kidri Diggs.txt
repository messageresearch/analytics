and we give you praise and honor in the name of Jesus Christ church say amen amen amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to math Mark let's turn to Mark the 5th chapter Mark chapter five praise the Lord Happy New Year to Beth of Tabernacle am we're going to say what we always say man I haven't seen y'all since last year amen but it's good to be together again amen Mark chapter 5 let's start reading at verse 24 if you have your bibles if you have it say Amen the Bible says and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thrown him Mark 5 verse 25 and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I Shall Behold and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my cloes let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he had obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was trans translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he is for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen may the Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seat praise the Lord tonight by the grace of God I want to step into a place amen I want to step into a place and call us message tonight moments of inspiration amen amen and and tonight by God's grace we're going to be talking about faith and not just any kind of Faith but perfect Faith right amen and you know even in this message you know I've been listening to this message over and over and over again I'm not necessarily talking about the message in general but I'm talking about this particular message perfect Faith you know and in this you know the prophet he said a lot of things about faith but he really zeroed in on perfect faith and you know uh there were many times in the scripture where Jesus would would would tell the disciples or different ones in the Bible that you can receive this according to your faith and then there was areas in the word where things took place and Jesus rebuked them for not having enough Faith but this is the question did they not have enough or was they not inspired enough all right because when we think about God Amen uh my inspiration for this is sowing and reaping Hallelujah and if I had to say tonight if you sow Faith you reap evidence Hallelujah all right because there's a law in sowing and reaping so tonight if you sow Faith you should reap the evidence of what you believe and you know church as I begin to think about sowing and reaping in faith and giving unto God that which he given to you if you give it back you should get the results amen hallelujah of what God gave you amen and you know God is giving each and every one of us in here faith I don't want to talk about The Measure of Faith right now what I want to talk about is that everybody in this room has Faith but what I want to come to amen that God has come in our day and given a measure of faith that should come to Perfection all right Hallelujah you and I our faith shouldn't be just the faith to open up a bubblegum wrapper Hallelujah just the faith to tie your shoe amen no it's something greater than that Hallelujah but I want to say this that faith is in the building tonight Hallelujah because look the prophet wouldn't preach that message if there wasn't a people on the earth that could fulfill or come to perfect faith and let me say like this if you heard it it might be because you're able to come up to it Hallelujah because God is not a God who wastes his time Hallelujah and one thing I want you to understand Hallelujah God is a god of Seasons Hallelujah and in the right season he said it would make itself known Hallelujah so the faith that you need Hallelujah could it be in you already all right Hallelujah and you might you might say well brother D when you going with it well let's look at sewing and reaping for a second you know when a farmer when you think about sewing you think about planting amen church and you know what a farmer does he goes and plant amen and he has in his mind what he wants to plant so what does he do he goes and get it in seed form first Hallelujah GL and when God planted his word hallelujah he put it down inside of of us in seed form all right and you know what that that that that farmer does when he plants it the prophet God say he can't keep going back digging it up saying where are my apples no once is planted now he has to believe what he sold he sold it in what faith Hallelujah he sold the seed in faith and now he has to trust Hallelujah that whatever situation or whatever it takes for that seed to come forth is going to come forth in its own time Hallelujah but what that what that that that farmer does he has to believe in his product right Glory oh my I feel religious brother vir I feel religious tonight hallelujah praise God you know think about it church that farmer let's just say it's apples cuz you know the prophet talk about apples that farmer he goes and buys Apple Seeds he doesn't get the seed and say I wonder I wonder if I plant this if apples is going to come forth no when he possesses the seed he's confident that everything in that seed will come forth and the thing about a farmer when he plants he doesn't just planted anywhere he planted Hallelujah in a place where he can get a return W Hallelujah he puts it in the ground Hallelujah he also Hallelujah has to believe in that ground by faith because he can't make the ground do something that it cannot do Hallelujah the ground he has to trust in the ground by faith he has to stand back and say I'm going to trust that the seed will come forth I'm going to trust Hallelujah that what I'm planting will come forth so it all becomes a sewing of faith and God has did the same thing Hallelujah God has put his word in us before the foundation of the world but God has to come back and Trust his own planting Oh my he has to come back and trust that that where he planted the seed it will come forth amen you say but he's God listen to Hebrews he said we understand that by faith the worlds were framed amen see so God used his own faith Hallelujah to speak things into existence so it's going if you I any of us bring anything forth concerning God it has to be a measure of what faith amen hly faith is the substance of things what hope for then it becomes the evidence of Things Not Seen Hallelujah and you know what that farmer does he plants it and then he walks away from it and that seed has to go through the motions all by itself but one thing the seed doesn't know the farmer is still watching over it Hallelujah he makes sure H as it begins to grow that the deers or the Cotes or whatever that can eat Hallelujah eat up the crop in his baby stage they are ran away Hallelujah and God has done the same thing for you and I in our baby stage God Jesus Christ the farmer was still there watching over the seed Hallelujah you know Church hallelujah what the farmer does he even watches the forecast Hallelujah and the forecast speaks of Prophecy he watches the forecast brother Jason and sometimes he look because he knows the season change and then what he does he he may watch the forecast and he speaks of a frost at night but that's not the season when the seed should come forth so what does that farmer do he goes out and he covers the Che Amen to keep it from coming forth out of season God is in control thank you just give him your faith he will take care everything else because what God has done God has put Hallelujah a Measure of Faith in each and every one of you but God back what he's given us okay now I love this illustration how the prophet said if you want a oak tree I give you Acorn if you got the acorn you got the oak tree potentially amen do you know that one Hallelujah that's not foreign to you is it what is he saying he's saying if you got the seed listen to me now I'm about to say something heavy Hallelujah don't let this go over your head now make let this be your Super Bowl tonight Hallelujah Glory listen hallelujah what does he do he knows that Hallelujah if he sew it Hallelujah if he planted Hallelujah that that life will come out at a prospective time H he's not worthy about the storm Hallelujah he's not even worried about the darkness W oh my church and as is planted the prophet of God said he said about that seed he said everything in that seed everything that it ever need every bushel Hallelujah even the color of it every characteristic is in it at that stage already what are you saying brother JS the faith you need for every trial the faith you need for every situation the faith you need for every struggle for every bill for every sickness for every tribulation is in you right now amen hallelujah the prophet said we live below our means let's stop going to God rehearsing things that he cannot do we go to God we say Lord increase my face how can he the prophet of God say he's already done it everything that you need has already been done so what are you saying brother de you need to find or catch your moment of inspiration because when you catch your moment of inspiration by faith whatever you need will come forth Hallelujah and that's what that that's what that farmer does hallelujah he knows as he watches it and sometimes he watches it from a far off but he's still watching it Hallelujah and he Hallelujah most Farmers they plant things that they've already planted before so let me say it like this what you going through Hallelujah is nothing new to God somebody's already gone through it and you know what they brought forth fruit Hallelujah so shall we amen somebody's already went through Hallelujah my financial struggles Hallelujah and they are still here bringing forth fruit Hallelujah so if I got the same life in me Hallelujah I should be able to bring forth fruit Hallelujah I ain't going to be long don't get nervous but as we look in the scripture and we think about perfect Faith you know that Faith Hallelujah faith is a realm Hallelujah that a real believer can live in right you know the prophet he would he would come up he stand behind the pull pit and they have he have people out there and everything else and he makes statements like this you know what I'm waiting on you know who what was he doing we are we onise God I lost AIT it to me I like the way it sound I ain't afraid of a little Echo hallelujah look what he would do he come out on the pit knowing full well Hallelujah who God Is Knowing full well and there are people there waiting on a vision Hallelujah and how they wait they be waiting by faith so he had to step into that same room of and P let God use him to pull out what the people need so you got operting faith but let's not forget the people were also operating in FA and for them to get a vision from theet we make the vision so great the vision for that person for the Propet the vision of that person that person had to be in the same real remember he I'm contac Spirit in order for him to contact the spirit they had to be in the same what about Christ in you moments of inspiration and stimulation all of those things work together let's look at it church this woman in the Bible who had a blood issue the Bible say she had an issue for 12 years and she went to doctors Physicians and all these people and the Bible say she didn't get better but she got worse how did she get worse why did she get worse because she was concentrating and living in her five senses amen hallelujah and we know that the five senses are only to contact this world right amen but then there's another sense Hallelujah that can call things that are not as though they are and bring them right into your life all right whereever they are supposed to be now let me say this church if you Catch It you call it and you pull it that mean it was always yours you just had to catch the inspiration I knew was something going on praise God where we at am I own you know there was a there we go now we talking I knew something was going on there was a level of inspiration and trust that you got to have concerning spiritual things yeah Hallelujah first of all we put all our hope and trust in who God Amen but before I finish with this woman before I finish with her let's let's let's back up a little bit now say that she had a blood issue for 12 years I want to I want to like my pastor say he'll throw a curve every now and then curve mean uh I the statement ain't GNA come right at you going boom but it's still going to hit you normally he he say I'm throwing a curve when he rebuking people people H but listen it took her 12 years just to even get into the place where she would now acknowledge I need Christ and how often we run to this person we run to that person we go get two jobs and three jobs and and all these other things instead of taking it to Christ all of our hope all of our trust and faith should be in him Hallelujah but what happens is brother Chris we're too busy living in our five senses and and the prophet of God said once the senses can declare it it's no longer Faith once you say if I do this I do that everything going to be all right that's no longer faith normally Faith takes over things you cannot control amen hallelujah but church he come to curve it took her 12 years just to even acknowledge God and the prophet of God say 12 is the name of what worship and we done be here all this time and and some of y'all still ain't Clapping Your Hands you done been in church all this time and some of y'all still lip singing some of you be real good actors too you ain't fooling me I used to be a song leader Hallelujah but brother Jason he'll leave you alone not me uhuh I want to hear voices H am mean I want to know that you a part of my team Hallelujah we seek all this religion and church stuff and ducking and dodging people no we come to give it to God when are you going to worship God when you come in here the words are ready there on the stream and you still won't open your mouth you know what's going to happen you going to reap what you sow like I always say hallelujah sister walk like I always say you know at my church they know I'm radical Hallelujah when I worship I sweat sometimes I lose my voice Hallelujah sometimes Hallelujah it feel like I need to change shirts and that's just doing the worship service Hallelujah and you know sometimes I know people are looking at me and they're like does it take all that you know what my response to that is you can't tell well I can tell what he done for me amen amen so my praise might cause me to jump up and kick the ceiling because of how he's been to me because of what he's done for me Hallelujah my praise Hallelujah might cause me to run around the church Hallelujah because he's Hallelujah I look back over my life and I can see the things that he's destroyed I look back over my life and I can see the things that he's delivered me from Hallelujah so my praise Hallelujah when I I think about God's goodness it causes me to give my all while we throwing a courage let's just throw it a little bit a little bit faster I said this before there's a rumor going around and some of y'all almost making it true but just a rumor you're going by this church you know you might not want to hear it but I'm I'm going tell it cuz we need to put the devil on the Run y'all need to know there's a rumor a rumor is all through the message going around is then the rumor is white folks don't shout is that rumor true Hallelujah they say they you know the prophet of God he said the the farther you go up north the quieter it get we in the South we down here in Buford Hallelujah where the mosquitoes are the size of cockroaches we in the South Hallelujah church we should really be on fire for God he's been too good he's done too much so I'm here to Proclaim I know some of you going around I say the Devil is a Lie hallelujah hallelujah you just don't know how hard he be trying not to get on those drums and turn into Van Halen Hallelujah but he be what we do is we hold back cuz we don't want to offend nobody so what be offended Hallelujah but Don why should I hold my praise because of somebody else doesn't have the same inspiration Hallelujah yeah I know what some of y'all G to do y'all GNA look at brother Jason and see what his response is to what I'm saying well let me tell you right now I didn't seen him shout hallelujah hallelujah I remember one time he came to our church I told Brother Jason I said brother Jason it's going to be good now watch what I tell you he got up in the pull pit he started the preaching and he stopped and he looked at me he said brother digs you all right right and all I saw the rest of the service was you going to Hallelujah where is that church that can catch their moments of inspiration where the chains of of sin and shame will be broken because yourself is a revelation not an emotion Hallelujah see that's what we've done we've mistaken Revelation for emotion no I shout because God has revealed himself to me and if it makes me feel good in the process that's a plus oh my let me move on I believe you caught that one but what we do we get in ruts and we let our five senses take control of things that shouldn't belong to our senses Hallelujah your five senses shouldn't control your worship your faith in Christ should the inspiration of who God is should control that the stimulation oh oh here we go here we go listen this woman she had a blood issue and the issue was getting worse and worse but then one day the Bible says look the scripture where I started with one of the servants was sick and Jesus the Bible saying Jesus went with him Hallelujah see Jesus wasn't even coming to her Hallelujah he wasn't what he wasn't even coming to her but the scripture says she heard Faith come by what hearing hearing what the word of God now we just was talking back in the office and he said he's been pastoring here probably 30 years 30 years of what preaching the word in this church Hallelujah preaching the message of the hour the unle bread Hallelujah thus say the Lord the alpha the Omega Hallelujah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa every revelation of Jesus Christ has been preached oh yeah I shouldn't say every but what's been revealed to him Hallelujah has been preach yes sir so Faith come by what 30 years of you hearing Hallelujah when you come here what do you hear so if you come here and you hear the word notice catch this now H he's not preaching the ministers that come in and preach they're not preaching a word in part it's not a Baptist Doctrine it's not a a Catholic Doctrine it's not a presbyterian Doctrine but it's a prophetic perfect revelation of Jesus Christ being preached to you Hallelujah so if faith comes by hearing and you're hearing the perfect Gospel of Jesus Christ what should that be producing in this church amen if you're hearing a perfect word it should be bringing forth perfect Faith cuz Faith come by hearing hearing what the word of God God oh my Hallelujah Faith come by hearing hearing the word of God but what happens when you hear it and inspiration catches it Hallelujah notice she said let me let me let me read something to you right quick oh my the prophet of God say we want to talk about inspiration for a second moments of inspiration Hallelujah and we all have had moments of inspiration Hallelujah I'll make it real plain to you most of you you were dating or courting your wife and something came to you one day and you said I'm going to marry that woman now you can take that to be the devil or you can take that to be God according to where you are right now Hallelujah and even if it's a struggle it can still be an inspiration giv of God hallelujah and you know Church you think we operate inspiration is always there but how are we hearing amen listen L Hallelujah the prophet of God say he said that's what the Sho ofite woman was going by it was unreasonable to take the dead baby to the preacher bed Hallelujah he said but inspiration spoke and it inspiration speak to you and say to you you've been playing church if inspiration tells you tonight it's time to get rid of your dirty habits listen to inspiration it's the Holy Spirit speaking and making a way Hallelujah he says so when inspiration come inspiration comes to make a way Hallelujah he said no matter what the people think what others say it's the inspiration leading you if it's according to the word and it's according to the word then the inspiration is leading you oh my listen he says now the English word Prophet just means preacher see anybody every preacher is a prophet cuz he is for telling something preaching the word under inspiration is called a prophet he said why are you saying that cuz we believe brother brenon was a prophet and you know a lot of times he will come out he say hey this is nothing premeditated we're just going to get behind the pull pit find something and preach it so as he's preaching it and catching by inspiration the message he's preaching he's in a realm of Faith H and when we catch it hallelujah hallelujah let me let let me let me let me let me go into this listen remember Jesus was standing in front of his disciples and he says who do men say that I am hallu and somebody say some say you you're John the Baptist some say you're Liars some say you do some say your dad or one of the and then he says who do you say I am he wanted to see if he was really revealed to them if they really understood Hallelujah who they were hearing from Hallelujah and then Peter says listen Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and listen to Christ response he says Peter Flesh and Blood have not revealed this to you he said but my Father which is in heaven and the prophet of God said faith is what a revelation that's what we need to live we need to live our Revelation that's what we're doing now Hallelujah by the grace of God we're living our Revelation amen moments of inspiration now catch this woman let's go back to this woman now she sees Jesus he's coming down everybody all right he sees Jesus coming down notice Christ wasn't even tended into her need right amen if I could say it like this he had no intentions on dealing with her that day but she heard that Christ was coming that way Hallelujah faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God and then something inside of her said if you could just touch amen the H of His Garment now notice she didn't have a scripture she didn't have a quot she didn't have a friend or a pastor by somebody beside her that will push her into that it was solely what inspiration it was a moment of inspiration where God would change her life forever that's what a moment of inspiration can do Hallelujah and notice from that point something moved on her to say if you could just touch the him of His Garment you'll be made whole Hallelujah and nobody else around could hear what God was saying to her okay that brings me to this this the prophet of God says now we're going to tap into

hear my voice am I right Church your body the tightness of your body can make you yarn I just saw somebody yawning that's why I said that Hallelujah listen he says it's just as real as my eye says

are you imagining that you're seeing paper in my hand no it's real okay okay let's keep going listen he said it's just as real as you say that's a light it's just as real as you say I feel my coat Hallelujah I won't touch your coat that's real oh that's nice am it's just as real as the coat I just touched there's some more coats in here it's just as real that's a sweater but it's the same thing just as real it's just as real as your coat it's just as real as your coat amen you got on the coat tonight touch it touch your coat JD it's just as real as my coat it's just as real as you hear a baby talking there on making this noise see it's just as real as music playing didn't y'all hear Brother [Music] Tony how many enjoyed the song service is just as real as the music playing brother Aon on the Bas Chris on the drums and all the other instruments he said perfect faith is just as real as these things now the question is am I imagining it or did it really happen oh Hallelujah GL listen he said it's just as real as a taste anything in my mouth it's just as real Hallelujah only you can't show it to somebody else you alone hallelujah amen it's yours faith is a substance see not just a myth so many people come Hallelujah so everything I name tonight we all are possessors of so it really happened Hallelujah we really Hallelujah touch the coat Hallelujah touch the paper and everything else let's keep going everybody all right he says now now these are real deep lessons and I'll catch the top of it then you can dig down in Hallelujah I don't listen to this message about 10 times over the past week cuz once I heard him say that it's real deep but I'mma hit the top of it what we're reading what we're what I'm quoting back to you is just the top of it there's more substance to it Hallelujah listen he says no notice it's something that you possess oh my perfect Faith Hallelujah moments of inspiration divine revelation is something that you possess it's not an imagination Oh my he said not an imagination if you really have it it's just as real as any other thing that could be it's just as will as you know that you're riding in your automobile oh I'm I'm going to get you now how many of you came here in an automobile pretty much everybody if you rode a motorcycle you a little different he said perfect Faith the moment of inspiration is just as real as you riding in your AUD mobile I know I came in a Honda I really did that it wasn't my imagination hallu I masked the pedal I passed track the trailers on the highway I did it I came in an automobile it's something that I possess all right Hallelujah and you possess it too if you came here an automobile let's keep going it's just as real as any other thing that could be is just as real as you ride an automobile it's just as real as you're sitting here in church where are wej am somebody tell me where you at we ain't at home we ain't in the grocery store we ain't in Chipotle we're in church and he said perfect faith is just as real as you being here in church tonight so let me ask you a question are you here are you present so is perfect Faith real yeah amen amen I ain't done with you now I want you to walk out of here tonight listen hallelujah it's just as real as hearing my voice amen see brother Luther say Amen that mean he can hear me Hallelujah I know some of y'all hear me but you don't respond you it's just as real now these things I'm talking about you've already done it you drove here in the automobile somebody say amen amen hallelujah you came and set in church and now you're hearing my voice Hallelujah can the devil take any of that away from you no you really did it it's not an imagination it's happening to me right now we are partakers of it right now oh my we say oh God increase it oh God give me more faith you are partakers of it right now Oh my he said it's a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of God hallelujah and that only now what are you hearing the word of God so if I'm preaching a word and you drove here in automobile and now you're sitting in church and then you heard my voice Hallelujah and the senses declaring that is light and all these other things that we can say are trueu if you are possessors of all these other things I've just said hallelujah what are you saying brother digs somebody say I have it not Lord increase it no I have it now Lord give me more no I have it because if I can declare Hallelujah that I've gone through the motions of an automobile go through the motions of a church go through the motions of hearing the voice go through the motions of seeing light the motion of Faith should be in the building Hallelujah for you to get in the automobile and drive takes what faith oh my for you to sit in church and hear the word takes what faith for you to acknowledge all the other things that can be declared takes what faith so perfect faith is among you amen amen thing of it is will you allow it to operate because clearly if I just use what the prophet said it's clear that we have it I go back I touched the coat it's not an imagination I really did it he said it's just as real as me touching the coat Hallelujah I did it it's not an imagination so I Hallelujah I went through that Hallelujah I'm in that realm oh my sew and reap and when the inspiration hit what happens why do we preach because what preaching does Hallelujah the word stimulates your faith so it's the hearing of the Gospel that arouses your faith it's the hearing of the Gospel that says amen it's the hearing of the gospel that says I believe I can do that listen it's not your flesh Amen in the Worden amen it's your theophany hallelujah it's your word body Hallelujah amening the word it's your heavenly representation Amen in the word because your flesh is not connected to the word what your word body is oh my listen stimulate stimulate means to excite to activate amen so what happens faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God so when the word is being preach that word is there to stimulate your faith that word is is being preached to get a reaction out of the seed Hallelujah because it takes hallelujah how do you get a reaction out of the natural seed it has to come in contact with the Su n Hallelujah and What Does the Farmer do the farmer has to trust by faith that the son will do his part because he can't control the Sun so he has to trust it by faith that as the sun shines that seed will get everything it needs Hallelujah so when brother Jason preach and brother Matt preach and the different brothers that here preach Hallelujah they have the trust that the s o n will do his part Hallelujah now before I close by the grace of God as we look at sewing and giving it back in moments of inspiration there are moments of inspiration All Through the Bible Hallelujah Abraham had moments of inspiration where it really didn't seem like it makes sense he said you know what I got 318 or 16 servants they know how to cook real good but today we gonna go fight today we going to go take back one of our brothers and we going to whoop up on the Army what was that that was a moment of inspir ation that's why he was called the father of Faith Hallelujah and listen one thing I know about God what God has done he's even done this to me God will speak a word in your life knowing you don't believe it yet oh he'll speak a word in his church knowing that you don't see it yet am but he allow you to hear it knowing you can come up to it Hallelujah you said what are you talking about he told Abraham you're gonna have a son knowing Abraham didn't believe it but what happened Abraham had to catch the inspiration of what was spoken into his life and once he caught the inspiration of Faith he caught the evidence of it which was Isaac and that's what God wants us to do as you're hearing the word of God catch the inspiration behind it cuz there's some way God is trying to reveal amen oh my he'll speak things knowing we don't believe it or we'll speak things knowing we don't believe it and then God will make sure we see what we're what we're wanting to see so what you talking about the prophet asked for squirrels and didn't believe it h and none of us will probably ever produce squirrels That Ain't My Testimony I I don't hunt I don't need no squirrel I want some squirrel I go to Tony house let him do the hunting I'll be there to eat Hallelujah really I want some deer hint hint but you cannot be what God doesn't want you to be and look at what the Lord will do he'll put you in a situation where the Revelation inside of you can get quickened Hallelujah and that moment of inspiration will come out Hallelujah against all ODS Hallelujah listen Joshua didn't wake up that morning saying I'm going to stop the sun oh right he was just living his life living his best life serving the lord he didn't know in his path that day God had a moment of inspiration that would change him his life and everybody else in his church Hallelujah listen he caught the inspiration see listen when you cast inspiration it'll make you speak things that seem unreasonable all right son stand still why could he do that because God told him be of a good courage nothing to be able to stand before you see what was it he was living by the word that was revealed to him yeah that's why he could catch the inspiration because he was living by the word that was revealed to him there were many other people Jacob caught inspiration to have his name changed from a Shyer to a prince Esther caught inspiration Ruth caught inspiration on and on people had moments of inspiration in their life that changed them forever David had inspiration he he didn't plan to fight a lion he didn't plan to fight a bear but that was a moment of inspiration that God would use for a bigger problem okay before we get out of here back to this woman so Faith reap evidence now bres what do you mean by so Faith this woman if I can find it right quick this woman in her mind she said if I could just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole amen now that was pretty much unheard of cuz was no virtue in the clothing The Virtue was in the Revelation Hallelujah The Virtue was in her knowing who he was Hallelujah and not only Hallelujah him knowing who he was but her knowing that she had the ability to do it amen that's the part Hallelujah that only did did she say in her mind she caught the inspiration that if you touch it Hallelujah you'll be made whole but she had to have the faith to go through it Hallelujah and sometimes we'll say I believe with the prophet said I believe this I believe that and never go through it on what good is you say you believe it and never put it into action but this woman said if I could just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole and Jesus was walking by doing whatever he was doing and she start aor people and pressing through the crowd touch the G boy I feel good thank you hallelujah oh let me go take my rest now the scripture says immediately just as real as an automobile amen just as real as you sitting in church just as real as you hearing my voice just as real as be touching the coater touching the sweater just as real Hallelujah as that woman saying let me ask you something amen what's the difference from her touching the coat of Jesus and me touching hip coat if I got a need and I do it by revelation hallelujah it's whether you believe it or not hallelujah oh my listen so Faith reap evidence listen I'm about I'm about to uh by the grace of God what time is oh my listen let's talk about this woman for a second this wasn't just some ordinary day the prophet of God the prophet of God say Amen every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like the Garden of Eden now man I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you know what that means it's been preached here several times H what I'm saying has already been preached to you Hallelujah man is omnipotent omnipotent means all powerful right amen he said a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent now I wonder how many of us in this church are fully surrendered to God if you are fully surrender to God God can't help but answer your prayers because it's omnipotent speaking and the reason why we don't see return on our sewing is because we are not sowing the right thing am you can't s 50-50 God and 50-50 unbelief Hallelujah we don't plant a apple orang seed you remember he said it ain't a white black bird ain't a dog cat or whatever he say listen he said you don't believe that he is a man fully surrender to of God is omnipotent did not he say in Mark 11:23 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotence meet when God and man comes together two omnipotence something's got to [Music] shake I tell you what happens there go Jesus walking down it's ation comes and says if I could just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole remember I said two omnipotence now we know God is one omnipotent where was the other omnipotent that woman with the blood wow God put her in position where her faith her real Faith could come out in that moment H she was always omnipotent right but it took that moment for her to see who she really was Oh my he says whatsoever you said Hallelujah the creative power omnipotence of God knowing that the pro that he promised it and he said in his word is creative power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass amen creative power is in you tonight oh the devil thought I was going to choke it no creative power is in Beth Tabernacle tonight am amen I'm going to read something to you most of you probably never heard or you never could see yourself as but in a moment of inspiration this is who you are if you're sewing Faith to God perfect Faith to God all you can do is reap the evidence of that faith and that's what she was doing she was sowing perfect Faith to God so she had to be healed what are we sowing church amen but it all happened in a moment of inspiration oh my I know some of you tired and sleepy so I'm about to I'm about to I'm about to close it down I know them words got power I'm about to close listen this blew me away when I read this he said that's when two positives meet see that's when two omnipotent me see when one omnipotent she had the prophet of God already put her there omnipotent he said one omnipotence she had she was all powerful but listen he going to take it a step further she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ amen where are we Church all this word we've been hearing 30 plus years our church to my pastor been preaching 30 40 years is same thing listen she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see she oh my the prophet of God says she had perfect infinite Faith amen see the reason why that doesn't get a response out of some of you is because you don't see yourself like that right amen the word infinite normally only speaks of Christ because we are finite but then the prophet comes and says she had perfect infinite Faith so what kind of Faith did she had she had the same faith God has in that moment she could have created a world Hallelujah she had perfect infinite faith in her moment of inspiration just like Joshua stopped the son what was that perfect infinite Faith just like David standing before go saying I'm going to cut your head off without a sword what was it it was perfect omnipotent faith and when two omnipotence meet the miraculous has to take place thank you Lord and when you find your place in Christ and your moment of inspiration the same thing will happen come musicians I'm closing she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was Lord and know whatever he asked God God would give it to him in other words she said you just speak the word that's all you have to do whatsoever you ask God God will give it you amen church it's time for us to believe what we read in this message perfect Faith the prophet of God says it's time for us to preach it a little deeper and get some of us make belief out the church Hallelujah let's get some of them make belief out the church say brother de what are you saying if you got a problem you got a need tonight stop wrestling with it right amen give it to God say Lord I believe that you can take care of this give it to the Lord sow Faith back to him and reap the evidence of it Hallelujah I guarantee you you're going to reap what you s Hallelujah just like this woman did she sold unto Christ she gave him the faith back Hallelujah and then she received the evidence of it by what having healing in her body am oh but that was a moment of inspiration in a moment of inspiration in a real of Faith Hallelujah and that happens all the time yes amen why doesn't it happen more often because we try to do things on our own we want to put it in our five senses and control it no let's give it to God let's say the prophet of God says he says what happened with Joshua he said Joshua was standing there looking at the son and then Joshua begin to realize who he was W he begin to realize who he was he begin to realize what what God spoke over him and then he be to move according to the Revelation the prophet of God say he was saying hallelujah in that moment I'm a son and I got a need son stand still he said what would it be tonight if everybody in this church would come Hallelujah approach God knowing who they are nothing would be able to stand in the place that's why the whole just of the prophet's message was get the people to believe amen and nothing will be able to stand before you Church there are more moments of inspiration in our lives I'm sure all everybody in this room can think of something that happened in your life where it was like amen you knew God did it amen why can't that happen all the [Music] time the prophet said Jesus defeated the devil simply by knowing who he was what about you what about us right we'll defeat the enemy the same way simply by knowing who you are let's catch the moment of inspiration the prophets Hallelujah he's in an airplane flying Hallelujah and as he's flying he's he's he's he has to fly and she's tapping into real Faith she's tapping into a moment of inspiration not only for her but for her family Hallelujah she's tapping into it how does she tap into it strictly by knowing who she is she says hallelujah in the moment of inspiration I'm just like the shite now where's my Elijah and in that moment who was speaking it was God speaking because everything that could make what she said happen start to happen the plane which had no ears came down why because the gift Hallelujah to confirm her prayer was on that plane moment of inspiration brought everything she needed for that time what about you that moment of inspiration and what I love about it the prophet was caught up in her moment and he couldn't do nothing about it but surrender Oh Oh my he could do nothing about it but surrender because she knew who she was she said I'm just like to shoot M now where's my Elijah Elijah's on the plane Elijah came down Hallelujah son may whole everything amen but that's bride's food these things are told for us to encourage us that we could also sow Faith that's what she did she sold faith and reaped the evidence of a son being made whole another moment of inspiration I'm trying to quit brother Jason a moment of inspiration Lazareth is dying they call for Jesus Jesus keeps walking but I've been I've been speaking on this last last year we have to check our [Music] attitude because sometimes Jesus won't come but he'll give you a hint to what's going to happen you might come to church and hear the word and the word is telling you what's going to happen even though Christ didn't do it right there he told Hallelujah they say Lazarus to dying he said hey this is for the glory of God hallelujah then they sit for him and all these other things keeps happen he goes back and he says hey it was good for you that I wasn't he see he's trying to get them to see something's about to take place but it's not going to happen the way you think it's going to happen that's how inspiration moves but if you tap in right Hallelujah you can make Jesus show himself Hallelujah and church right there Hallelujah Jesus amen he comes back and Martha Taps into the right inspiration she says Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't have died look at her attitude her attitude was I know anything is possible once you get here that was her attitude she was in in what the realm of Faith she was in a realm that was making Jesus everything and then she kept talking and Christ says hey your brother will live again and she cut inspiration brother Aon she says I know in the day of the Resurrection he'll Rise Again Jesus said what aming he had to respond H to her faith she sold it by word now God is going to give her the evidence the manifestation of it I am the [Music] resurrection where have you laid him oh my oh what what happens when you catch the right inspiration when you when you catch the right inspiration it'll show you things that hadn't even taken place yet but it's going to happen remember Cain and a I'm trying to quit Cain and Abel went to worship Hallelujah and and Cain he brought out flowers and all fruit and all these things but Abel caught a different Revelation and Abel grabbed the lamb brought the lamb over he started hacking the lamb up what was he doing look at the type the type was a lamb slain Hallelujah Jesus hadn't even been to the Cross yet but Abel caught the [Music] inspiration Hallelujah in his moment of of insiration he cut Christ on the cross before it even took place what do you catch in your time of need job lost everything his children his his his his his wife his his riches his status social status everything but then one day he said I know my redeemer liveth what was the church Hallelujah he caught Christ coming out of the Grave before he even went in the grave wow amen what kind of inspiration are you catching right it should be that of your future Hallelujah let's pray let's pray let's stop living in the present let's live in our future see I just start speaking over myself I'm already blessed I'm already out of debt Hallelujah I'm so knowing Faith unto God hallelujah know if I sow the right thing that seed has to come forth let's pray Lord Jesus father we thank you we bless your name Lord we give you all the honor and Glory father for you're such a great God Lord help us to tap into this Faith Lord that you've already placed in the seed because the prophet of God said Lord that you can't add anything to it cuz you've already done it you sat down and said it is finished so Lord help that quickening power to come forth rise Upon Us Lord that the truth of who we are will just come out Lord we pray that you bless this church Lord and all connected to it father and that this word would be a word that'll materialize in the lives of your people that will materialize when we speak about our children we speak about our household we speak about our church let the real inspiration god-given inspiration come forward L we love you and we thank you in Jesus name we pray somebody say Amen somebody say Amen am faith in God for Deliverance have Fai in in God God come on and gather around have faith in God Lord have faith in [Music] God oh have oh fa in God for for the answer have fa in God you have a need tonight I want to catch these couple of needs that came in and then I want to make some comment but I I don't want to forget these [Music] needs um want to remember Matt and Rachel traveling with the Matt ministering in Belgium want the Lord to amen bless those meetings amen amen amen amen it's the great should be the greatest Mission excuse me of any church to go or send someone so we want to be praying for brother Matt and sister Rachel there to help him be with him I have a good friend sister Debbie and I have good friends that we knew for many years since we were teenagers and kids together um sister Debbie hollofield her mother who we know my wife and I know quite well and uh she recently had a stroke and they were um they were able to give her I'm not sure what it was apparently there's some type of a medication uh that if they can have a stroke victim they can get it to them very quickly uh I guess amen there's some kind of medication and she responded quite well to it and uh she still there were speech problems and a little cuz one side was completely gone after the stroke and they didn't know they would get it back and it brought it the speech back partially and um then there was some still some motor issues but I asked her for an update and her mom is doing good her speech is now completely back to normal we've been praying amen they've been praying up there in North Carolina and um and she's still using um therapist to get her motor skills with walking going again Amen brother Kenny also brother Kino had a repeat injury uh injured his back um I know brother George had had um how's your dad is he okay so want to be praying for that amen and so I didn't have any other needs but I know perhaps especially with that kind of a sermon tonight you want to make a need known to the Lord tonight that was so powerful I I had so many things I want to say it's getting late but my you know I I just want to say this I want to say two things you got enough time to hear two [Music] things you know when brother brandham was there in perfect faith and he was he made a state realiz had set my thinking in a certain way for years since a young man since I heard that statement you know something brother Diggs this sermon tonight has completely revolutionize my thinking on this statement and he's talking about perfect faith and he says the reason he's bringing this is he says you've had a faith he said but now I'm trying to get you to perfect faith and the reason reason was he said you're going to need it down the road and you know something I thought about brother Dig's sermon tonight proving to us I would say that the servant of the Lord has proven Beyond doubt certainly no believer should be in doubt we have that which is perfect amen that perfect faith is here and all it takes is a dedicated life and and an acceptance of who you are amen amen cuz that's exactly what that that uh Memphis uh brother Bram said like an oldfashioned anima said she she caught and I never realized that as many times I heard that she identified herself in the Bible right she said Lord I'm just like that that shite woman but where's your Elijah I mean God had to reply to that there's no way somebody going to catch a Revelation that they're just like that person in the Bible yeah what's God going to do you know I I I remember when the angel said to Mary this is what's going to happen and and Mary Mary did the only thing that a real believer could do she said amen yeah be unto me and I I remember preaching one time and I said and when a Believer When God Says something a real believer can only say amen and when a real believer says Amen to the word the only thing God can do is bring it to pass amen oh my goodness and you know I thought about brother Bram saying you're going to need it down the road and in my mind I guess I've always thought you know we're going to come to this we're going to come to this someday we're going to come to this but you know I thought I was sitting there tonight I was making a note and I was thinking to myself you know there's nothing the devil would like more than to always keep you chasing a carrot on stick always just keep it out there in front of you someday if we're going to get the bride's going to get no friends forget it we have it right now amen right now that perfect faith is here yes but you you know what you know what the shunamite woman had to do she had to act on her faith now you ready to act on your faith now here here's the one where the devil knocks about 99 9.9% of us off the out of the saddle well yeah that that shunamite woman she was worthy that that Memphis sister she was living she must have been living a super life I don't know about me brother Brown says he says I'm fixing to pray for you now we're getting ready to pray so is this relevant he says I'm fixing to pray for you amen and he says I'm not worthy of that I think what would I do if Jesus was sitting here now and what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you and with now catch it and with his great faith you'd get well come on now that's easy isn't it if he was sitting here if he was standing here with his great faith he'd lay his hands on you and you know you'd get well well I think well but I'm a sinner Prophet says I'm not I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him remember me being a sinner before God I'm not a sinner and neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice but Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we're Christians amen amen amen so now I know who I am now there should be no now I know perfect faith is here I know he's here I know I'm a Believer Hallelujah so then what does hinder it friends I just say we ought to believe God don't chase a carrot on a stick let's take it right now yeah how many will agree yes sir you'll act on your faith you'll act on it and say tonight I believe it I'm accepting it and that's it I'm going out of here with what I have need of Amen praise the Lord take the hand of somebody near you put your arm on them decently and in [Music] order Lord God what a word we've heard tonight what a faith father I think of of brother Ken Lord with his back injured brother George with his back injured I think of sister Debbie holifield's mother you've already done such great things I think of sister Jean at home right now Lord recovering her strength Lord you've been so good to us you you've been so faithful Lord God we're we we so love you for your word tonight father I am believing master that your servant brother Matt across the seas there with Rachel Lord and they're they've gone to carry the gospel I'm believing that you're going to meet every need Lord father for every sick person for all of these needs that have been written for every hand that went up Lord tonight we accept that you're here the word is here and we are your children and we have perfect Faith Lord in operation right now I'm praying for these needs Lord God and we have decided as a group of people we have decided to believe it Mary would say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord that's the only thing a Believer can say and when a Believer says that the only thing God can do at that point is keep his word so Lord we give it to you tonight with perfect faith in our heart every need Lord every hand that went up all the needs father of your people your children your family we are not Lord we we don't we don't always feel so Victorious but in the presence of God because of a blood sacrifice I stand perfect before God and now if I stand perfect and your word is perfect Lord and you're perfect and faith is perfect then what does hinder the word to come to pass in our lives Lord we've checked every box of perfection tonight the word the presence of Christ my life under the blood the faith that's here now Lord what what we're we're we're every element is perfect Lord we we've come to that which is perfect and there's no need to operate on a hope so or a maybe so or or a try to be so Lord it is so tonight so we commit it to you and we confess it and we believe it and we're determined right now to act upon our faith and accept it and say Amen to that word to that promise my promise Lord whatever I need and I got a bunch of them they're everyone yay and amen they're everyone a promise in the word of God lord so now the devil has nothing to say he he's had the rug taken completely out from under him Lord he's been exposed he has no weapons he has nothing he stands helpless tonight before your believing bride so we commit it to you now all of these needs in Jesus Christ's name the church said I mean listen friends there's no that's not perfect yeah amen amen he's perfectly here in his he's perfect his presence is perfect his word is perfect your faith is perfect you didn't know it but it is you're perfect you don't believe that but you are in under the blood of Christ it's perfect perfect perfect perfect amen so where's the devil stand now oh my goodness goodness my goodness I I had more I would have loved to have said but it's getting late we're going to let you go God bless you friends is it wonderful to be a believer sir now are you a real believer amen now don't leave this building and be become a half believer yeah stay a full-fledged Thor Thor Thoroughbred believer

[Applause] evening so I've never struggled with any kind of skin condition before or anything but a couple months ago the devil tried to put eczema on me mhm and I was like I don't know how to treat this or anything I've never dealt with it so so I was kind of complaining about to M I was like I'm so insecure like it's I started getting out of my eyes right here and it was on my legs and I was like I don't know what to do with about it and he was like you don't have to to deal with that and I was like you're right I don't have to put up with this and I told the dad well you're trying to give me a skin condition and it's but it's not my skin condition right you know and so I started rebuking it and um it'd go away like within 5 to 10 minutes of me like rebuking this thing and he tried to give it back and so I was like you know you're trying to put this on God's Property wow and I'm like you're going to go in the Lake of Fire and this SK skin condition is going with you so don't forget that Hallelujah and I'm about to cry but I feel the presence of God but um so I went away for like a week and I was just talking to stepen Emily and with Micah and we were just talking about the word and I was testifying to them and the next day it comes back so bad on my hands and I was like in the name of Jesus I bind the spirit and I cast it into into hell and I haven't struggled with it since hallelujah [Music] hallelujah this is more of a praise report than a testimony um as everybody in here knows for years I've prayed for my children and I know I'll see the goodness of the Lord on this side them will you will but just the I can barely get through this just um I don't remember exactly what day it was but they were really heavy on my heart especially my oldest who has picked up a habit that's dangerous to her health and I was just so just grieved and I was praying and just like you said brother Jason the Devil Comes you know well she's not in church how's she going to get delivered and it just inspiration struck me and I said Lord that woman I'm just like that woman who came to you and said my daughter is grievously vexed by a devil yeah and I feel like this sermon

his bed burning raging fever and the next day he was supposed to have choir practice on the Saturday before the Sunday service and he said when he crawled in the bed Friday night he said I was I was delirious with fever he'd went into complete delirium and he said I just would I would wake up and come to to just enough to say devil you're a liar and he said I'd pass out again and he he said I'd roll around I'd sweating and he said I'd he said a couple hours later I'd come to myself again he said I'd say devil you're a liar he said I'd pass out again and he said we fought it out all night
