Who's Fool Are You? - Matthew Smith
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you all right we good to go all right good morning everybody we're running a little bit of a skeleton crew here in the booth um y'all can hear me okay all right um so this morning um i would like to uh read a scripture here while standing and read a scripture um first corinthians 6 20. let me pull that up and we having trouble okay there we go um so this is first corinthians 6 20 um for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which are god's let's have a word of prayer father we come before you this morning ask you be with us and you would anoint my lips that i would speak the words that these people would need to hear and that they would have an open heart and open ears and anointed ears to hear the word that you'd be able to take this little sunday school thought just this little teaching and and give them some ammunition to fight the devil with and they would be able to sharpen their sword a little bit and father we asked that you would be with us and and uh north of service services going forward that we'd invite you and we to create an atmosphere through the through the hearing of the word this morning and into the song service that when the preaching would come that we would have open hearts and be blessed and have the food that we need for this day and for this week going forward we ask these things in jesus name amen y'all can be seated so i wanted one of the things that has caught me um this i guess about the last week one of the things that y'all probably heard about is um it's been all over the news you know elon musk is trying to buy twitter right uh what is it 45 billion dollars is and he already spent nine billion on on twitter um and i was trying to spend another 45 billion and it's you know i was just thinking about how crazy it is that you have all these social media companies that are worth untold billions of dollars i don't remember exactly what um facebook and youtube are worth but it's some astronomical amount of money um and everybody seems to you know the the whole new cycle all of society is so invested in the goings-on on social media you know the you know political positions that you know mark zuckerberg is going to take or you know his appearances before congress or whatever this is all very important to the entire news cycle anytime something like this happens everybody's involved in it and they're worth so much money um you know the which which kind of on its face is a little bit odd that you would have companies like say twitter that's worth again 50 plus billion dollars and its entire business model is letting people use it for free and so that you know you can send rude text to strangers on the internet um but like it's this free service and and and you know same thing with facebook how are these companies worth billions and billions of dollars when their entire user base doesn't pay a nickel right you have what was it um like facebook has over a billion users and nobody pays a dime for it well you know and not only that but then you have stuff like google right google is one of the largest most widely used services on the planet just a google search and again nobody pays a dime for it um and not that's that's just on the face of it most of y'all are using google and don't don't even realize it because you're using things like their their back-end infrastructure like server processing or you know and like security certificates and things like that most of the websites you go to are using google in some form or another even if they have nothing to do with google um and that's all free you don't pay anything for it yet it is a service that you're using and so you have to wonder why how are these companies worth all this money yet most of the people using it aren't paying anything right well a long time ago um i believe was the ceo of google actually made a really profound statement in reference to all of this and i'm sure some of y'all might have heard it and he said if you're getting anything for free you're not the customer you're the product okay so facebook when you're on facebook you know scrolling through your news feed being mad mad at strangers on the internet the [Music] you're not facebook's customer right you are the product that facebook is selling to their actual customers who are advertisers and you know whoever is promoting their products usually a product though sometimes you get political campaigns or you know political advertising things like that through whatever social media company and facebook you know it's funny to me a lot of people um get you know upset at various social media companies because their policies and oh well you're censoring me or you know you're you know you have some stance or you know on some particular issue and everyone gets all mad and upset but facebook doesn't care because you're not their customer right you're just a product to them and there's many more like you so what facebook or or twitter or whoever social media what they're what they're aiming at is to get people to become addicted to their pro to what they're actually selling right you know there's a lot of of work that goes into psychological manipulation a lot of people don't really think about this but it absolutely happens facebook employs thousands and not just facebook but any social media company everything from you know twitter to pinterest anything they're going to hire psychologists who are going to engineer they they very meticulously engineer that user interface to become addictive right um you know youtube recently removed the dislike bar i don't know if you all are familiar with that but it shows how many people dislike the video well why do they do that it has to do with psychologists are saying well if people are seeing this video the dislikes on this video it's going to affect them negatively and they're not going to want to watch it so they're going to be less likely to click something else right there it's it's an engineered in the entire environment that you're in when you when you're entering a social media environment is engineered to get you to keep scrolling get you to keep watching whatever it is because every time you know the auto player you click next video on youtube you get another ad you know with some you know weird dude and a pet emu trying to sell you car insurance or whatever like this is you know they're the whole idea is every time they're getting you to click they're pulling you in so they're gonna get you addicted to this and it's not just social media um you know they've they've done some studies with social like facebook in particular and also twitter where when you're getting likes on your posts your brain releases dopamine right it's a little hit a dopamine it makes you feel good it's feel-good chemicals these are the same feel-good chemicals that heroin produce by the way right it literally creates an addictive cycle and they know that and they're getting you addicted because the longer you stay there the longer you're invested in their platform the more you're going to uh you know keep hitting their ad revenue or whatever now it kind of goes beyond that though so i wanted to um i saw some headlines these are older headlines this is from about 2012 2014. um and this is so here's one from newsweek this is from 2014 it says uh talking about how facebook performed a psychology experiment on thousands of users without telling them right well because when you sign that terms of service somewhere buried in that 10 000 page document that nobody reads is a basically psychology psychological experimentation consent form that you just check your your name next to and they get to run all kinds of experiments on you in this particular instance they were manipulating people's news feeds to give them happy content or sad content and get and affect their actual mood right they can do that you know hiding happy news from your friends and showing you sad news or news articles or whatever um the uh another one this is from nature by the way nature's a in case any of you have not heard of it about it nature is a problem with the top scientific journals on the planet um uh where facebook published their data um showing that they were able to uh boost voter turnout through editing you know putting notifications on people's timelines okay so it's not so now we're starting to see wait a minute it's not just advertising you know when it's just people selling you car insurance is not that big of a deal but you got to realize the same techniques the same technology that will get you to open your wallet and pay for car insurance is the same thing that'll get you to vote a certain way it's really what it is and it's so mundane and it's so common to us we don't really think about it but what advertising is these especially when it comes to social media advertising because they know your habits they know your daily cycle they can track you through your phone and know where you're going i recently saw i don't have it down here but there was a headline where facebook talked about how they know your daily routines um and and when you're doing what every day and when you know if you have a routine they know what you're doing every day and they can and they will custom feed you notifications to check your facebook depending on what time of you know day it is they know when you're most susceptible to kind of get hooked on it for 15 20 30 minutes or whatever and not do your work um and there was and so they know people really really well we i've all had that weird experience of talking about something with somebody and then you open facebook and there's six ads for the thing that you were talking about even though you've never searched that thing right it's really bizarre some people like while they're they're listening through your phone which they might be though i have heard some stuff from an actual google engineer where he talked about actually no listening to your conversations would be harder than what we actually do because they can through massive amounts of data collection they can get way more accurate than just listening to your to your conversations an example of that is a one that some of you might have also heard about is incident with target the headline reads how target figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did okay now if you read that article um they did this because they tracked the buying habits of pregnant women who they knew they were pregnant because they signed on to their baby registry through target right well they tracked all their buying habits across hundreds of thousands of women you know because they were all linked to their target account or email or whatever and then through that data they were able to predict anyone else who wasn't on the registry who was also falling in those buying patterns they could predict that they were pregnant and so this the story is a guy start his daughter's 16 year old daughter starts getting ads in the mail for baby stuff and he goes into target all upset like why are you trying to like influence my daughter to get pregnant and like well i'm sorry sir you know i don't know what's going on well then come to find out the man ends up talking to the manager later and apologizes actually turns out there's been some stuff going on that i didn't know about and i'm really sorry right how do they know that well funnily enough um they actually go into how they did this specifically one of the things that they noticed was the increase in purchase of unscented lotion for all of you ladies who were interested um that literally that was that was the number one indicator there was three or four indicators that target said that one of the main ones was the the increase in purchase rat like dramatic increase in purchase of unscented lotion accompanied with a couple other things meant that they had an 86 likelihood of guessing that any given woman was pregnant so this is they know you better than you do right they know you're right and so when they have that kind of power over you when they they know you that well they're going to control you if they if they know when you're pregnant before you do i guarantee you they know how to addict you to their device um i've seen the same thing in and we kind of think it's kind of unimportant but those little mobile games that people get on their phones well you spend any amount of time looking at the psychology literature on those so they're actually what they are is something called a skinner box which is actually somebody some guy's last name but basically it's a little mechanism that gets people to feel good every time they basically push a button and it gets you addicted and that's why people you know start playing angry birds or whatever and then it's 30 minutes an hour later and they don't know where their time went it's because they're getting a little dopamine hit every couple of seconds and they're just going to keep doing it over and over again well again every time you get that little dopamine hit you're also getting it in conjunction with buying car insurance right and so this is how the entire media industry especially social media it's all driven by the ability to control people now it's again we think it's kind of funny like like not unimportant because it's advertising it's buying car insurance or headphones or a new car or whatever but again if they can do that they can get you to do a lot of other stuff too right they need you to vote a certain way and i i guarantee you there's people paying a whole lot of money for the ability to control how you vote okay and so they they control and again because it becomes addictive they own a lot more real estate in your mind than people give them credit for right and so i wanted to read jump to um uh see here scripture revelations chapter 18. and so again i just want to again emphasize this point advertising it might seem like an insignificant version of it but advertising at its core is a form of mind control it is a mind control program that's what it's for um to always get you thinking about one thing or other again it might be something insignificant like car insurance but they're still getting you to think about car insurance um so revelations chapter uh 18 verse 11 through 13. um and so a little bit of context for this scripture is um this is babylon has fallen in brother braham describes how the the um vatican is bombed in this chapter and how all the it's it's all the merchants of the world lamenting babylon being destroyed okay and it says um and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth her merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thine wood and all manner vessels of ivory in all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and odors and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and the souls of men that here's the book of revelations predicting that in the end times the business world would be able to buy and sell the souls of men right now attach that to facebook and twitter and instagram and all that right they're you know you you think well how is car insurance getting someone to you know how is that selling somebody's soul well it's not just insurance it's the fact that there was a recent poll where they they looked at young people and they said that the the grand aspiration that the vast majority of teenagers have nowadays is not to be an astronaut or a scientist or whatever it's to be a social media influencer right all the this entire new generation of people their entire goals dreams and aspirations is to be part of the social media world right i mean that sounds a whole lot like they're they're owning people's souls to me right and they're and so they're going to go in that entire direction their whole life is going to be attached to that look at again and i'm including myself in this too when i say the younger generation my generation of people it's when you're when you were raised in a world where everybody had a smartphone and everybody had an internet connection and you could literally spend 18 hours a day hooked up to whatever you know whatever media platform or gaming platform you want they pretty much own you at that point right i mean kids will when you i've seen this myself when you walk into a room of 10 year olds and mention fortnite and they all start dancing that's bizarre and it tells you something about what's going on there right and i i sure you're giving me a look because you know exactly what i'm talking about right it's it's really bizarre this is the anyway so moving on from that um i don't want to get hung up on that because this is because i want to get to my what i'm actually trying to get at and that is god has advertising too right there's this is a a quote from let your line uh so shine before men for the random talking about a billboard i'm sure many of you have probably heard about heard this quote before we're talking about the billboard that just says hungry on it right um and so this is kind of where he's coming from this he says and we know um that the day that we live in it pays to advertise and we find out that these people who are making such big progress in business are great men of advertisement they put it on television they smear it on boards everywhere they can to advertise their products smoke this one not a coffin a carload and a thinking demand filter and some other man's taste or something like that and stay lively longer with their beer and all stuff like that it's advertisement and they write off a lot of their income tax just for advertisement and it certainly pays off so if it pays off for that i begin to think then why won't christianity pay off its if it's advertised well i thought then what is advertisement you've got to have something that is a little different from what the rest of them has got or if it's just so common like the things the world it'll never attract the attention of the people now if a man had been looking for an automobile he would went on past that sign but if he'd been hungry he'd been looking for that sign so i believe the christian is god's billboard i believe that each one of us is god's billboard and we don't have to do so much carrying on about it as we do just simply live a life that'll make the people hungry to be like you now the natural types of spiritual and the modern advertising scheme is one of mind control well that tells us something right god's interested in controlling your mind too right there's a and there's we are the entire christian experience is based around the idea that there is something free right salvation's free you don't pay a nickel for it well if you're getting something for free you're not the customer you're the product who's the customer in the world of salvation god is god paid the price christ paid the price for your redemption you're not the customer you're the product and with that under that that idea god's kind of trying to control your mind if you're the product of of salvation then god is interested in controlling what you're thinking about your hopes your dreams your ambitions um not only that but people again remember i mentioned that people get all upset about facebook and all these these different companies and their business practices but facebook doesn't care what you think right because you're not their customers if if i'm have a donut stand and some guy walks up to me who's deathly allergic to donuts and is like i don't like your donuts i'm boycotting you i don't care you weren't going to buy my donuts to begin with so likewise facebook and and to add on to that if i don't care what that guy thinks about my donuts i certainly don't care what the donut thinks about you know what the donut's opinion is likewise facebook doesn't care about your opinion any more than i would care about a donut's opinion because they're both products right and on top of that if the donut doesn't get an opinion in the on in the owner the donut stand then you don't really have much of an opini you don't really have much of an opinion on god and what god is doing right if if salve if you're not if you are not the customer in the scenario god is you don't get a say in how salvation works right people i wrote this down people get so entitled about christianity and the way things work but you're not the customer you didn't decide any of this right um you know people want convenient crucifixion right and then i'm not talking about like christ crucifixion i'm talking about your own crucifixion right are you carrying your cross and and people will be well it's not convenient to be a christian well of course it's not but then again you're not you're not supposed like this isn't for you necessarily right you know you don't you don't get amazon prime amazing grace that's not that's not how that works god is not a drive-through deity and it's not gonna work that way right you have to we have to not be so self-entitled when it comes to christianity and salvation because guess what god's gonna require some things of you um and it's not gonna be for your convenience there was a um but there's kind of a a good you know that sounds a little bit harsh but there's a there's a a good aspect to that and that is that the product isn't necessarily responsible for what it is right so give you an example if i you know say there's some guy right he's a old auto mechanic and he likes fixing up old cars and he goes and finds some old beaten down classic car that's all mangled and rotten in some old barn somewhere excuse me and he buys that car it's not the car's fault that it's is the way it is and it's not the car's fault to do anything with it like it's not the car's responsibility all that car has to do is let that mechanic work on it right the the mechanic is gonna pull it apart clean all the junk out of it clean it up put a new coat of paint on it fix the engine up get all the burden s out of it and make it run and he's slowly gonna you know clean that car up and go back with all original parts and it's gonna be just like it was when it rolled off the showroom floor eventually and it's not going to be the car's job to do that it's just you the car's only job is to surrender to the mechanic because it's not the customer it has no responsibility in that the only responsibility it has is not uh not being a hindrance and just simply yielding itself to the hand of of that which can restore it so i think uh we're uh out of time for today and um we'll stand and have a word of prayer lord thank you for this opportunity to speak to your people and ask that you would bless the words that have gone out and that they would anoint the people's hearts and if there would be anything that could help them that they would take it to heart and be able to use it in the days going forward and use it for the furthering of your kingdom father that we would not be so hung up on our own desires and and what we would need but that would be surrendered to you and how you would want to work on us and and and perfect us father we ask these things in your heavenly name jesus christ amen you [Music] [Music] [Music] you
