lesson talked about i want that physical part to look right but more importantly if i don't have that mystical part right i don't want that part to look right i want that part right because we all know it'll work itself out amen i love you all let's pray father i worship you this morning from the depths of my heart i thank you lord that you've birthed that seed in my soul and those that are gathered here in streaming father we look to you we say abba father lord help us to be pleasing to you help us defeat upon your word we thank you for your presence this morning lord and i just pray that you bless each and every one that would hear the sound of the ministering of the gospel today let there be a transforming power go down into the soul to transform us into that that you saw before the foundation of the world lord we love you this morning we praise you lord you receive all the glory and father i have loved ones that i want to see come in i want to see them display that outward work but more importantly that inward work of the soul and for each mom parent that has a loved one today lord we look to you in faith we hold up that token before you we may don't understand the work that you're going to do or what it will take but lord we commit our loved ones to you this morning thanking you lord that no one father you hear our cry bless your people today bless the offerings and the ties father we love you lord we worship you in jesus christ's name amen and just a quick note we don't pass the basket around but the basket is in the back for the offering i had a i picked up a tithing envelope that just said offering on it out of the tithe where all the tithing envelopes were and it had an offering in it so but just so you know it's mainly probably the visitors that but there is a basket in the back amen we're gonna invite you to have your seats once again sister deborah's got a special for us and then brother jason will come straight from that [Music] sometimes i feel so far away from where i'm supposed to be the trials of a weary world are flooding over me the burden of my heart a war within my mind but peace will come when i recall a desire deep inside [Music] his words in my mouth his hands reaching out his love in my life his way in my sight jesus only jesus only in me the path ahead of me is settled in my soul i'm anchored to the holy one and he will be my goal the mind of christ in me by this i shall prevail the only way to overcome every time i fail his words in my mouth his hands reaching out his love in my life his way in my sight jesus only jesus only his words in my mouth his hand reaching out his love in my life his way in jesus only jesus only in me [Music] [Applause] praise the lord god bless you today um sister sweetheart when you come on up sister dave is going to sing a special for me today that i requested it's an oldie goatee and um just i've been amazed since yesterday amen i've been amazed since yesterday at the men's breakfast just how sovereign the mind of god is and the lesson that brother jason took for us brothers it was remarkable to me because i had been i had actually notes in my notes at that moment sitting there that were almost just a continuation of some of the things he was saying and then this morning in the sunday school class i was just left almost stupefied i couldn't believe it that some of the things and i hadn't talked to brother jason about anything and yesterday and today it just shows me the sovereign mind of god and then to hear those specials and the very words and i've been listening for the words and just so beautiful and this song um [Music] it's i i have a hard time singing it because i come to a certain line and it's it's called the shepherd of my valley and it's what would i do without jesus and man i don't know what i would do without jesus i don't even i don't know what i could do i couldn't face the world and face life and you know man that's born of a woman is just a few days and full of trouble and what would i do without the lord i don't know how people face it you know and um you know um my mother and i we were talking and i want to say happy mother's day to her and all the mothers here today amen uh because of them we're all here and uh we were talking about that very concept how did the world endure without the presence of god in their lives and i said well mom they don't really that's why we have an opioid crisis that's why we have madness in the streets and politics have gone crazy and and and men's hearts failing for fear because they don't have christ and they're not coping so this is kind of an old throwback but i love it her mom used to sing it and did you ever sing it do you sing it with her yeah her mom i i kind of when i first met the family her mom was singing this and i i've loved it ever since and so sister debbie has a very similar voice and style to her mom's got some pipes that's where matt gets his loud and americans those loud those loud pipes but uh amen so i want you just to uh enjoy the lyrics especially to this to this old song god bless you [Music] [Music] what would i do without jesus the shepherd of my valley lord i just couldn't walk this road alone when i'm hungry he feeds me when i'm thirsty he's my water i couldn't make it without jesus what would i do [Music] when i need someone to talk he's to there to listen when our arms float without what would i do without jesus the shepherd of my valley i couldn't make it without jesus what would i do [Music] when my tears flow like a river and my burdens are high as a mountain [Music] that's when i go to jesus is the one i can count on i couldn't make it without jesus what would i need someone to talk to he's always there [Applause] [Music] i couldn't make it without jesus what would i do [Music] when i feel fear growing around me you're the one that always comes to me lord you bring such peace [Music] without jesus what is always there [Music] without jesus [Music] i couldn't make it without jesus what would i couldn't make it without jesus what would man some of y'all that ain't never heard her i bet you didn't know she'd sing like that amen i don't know where all that sound comes out of such a little bitty woman amen let's stand to our feet god bless you we greet you in the name of the lord today and i want to say again happy mother's day to all of our mothers and i agree you know with brother branham that every day ought to be mother's day amen praise the lord so i just want to express how grateful i am for a godly mother amen sometimes i you see things and i i see women and sons and and and the most horrible display of the vulgarity and immorality and you know and i just i've looked at that many times and said lord thank you mama it's not my mama i've got a mama that's holy and righteous and loves god and as a lady amen and amen brother branham said you know he said you know the way some women do today he said and call yourself a christian he said you're not even a lady much less a christian you know to to say nothing of claiming to be a christian amen and so i just appreciate that i appreciate all the godly examples i appreciate my wife i appreciate my daughter-in-law's there as brother beckett said no brother jason they're your daughters in grace amen and i say that amen and all my granddaughters especially they're quite magical amen and probably control me the most of all the women in my life my granddaughters probably control me the most amen amen my grandsons put them up to when they want something they're afraid i won't do it they'll send one of the girls to ask me uh but then of course they if if the girls want something and they know mama won't do it they'll send one of the grandsons because amen they know that's how they that's how that's how it rolls amen praise the lord i love a family don't you i love i think there's something beautiful in a family i appreciate and have appreciated so many times and i've had so many people visit and and there you can see they're trying to describe what they're sensing when they're here and uh they're trying to say wow it's so rare to see a whole church just and in the fellowship hall and the way y'all and it's kind of like uh kind of like and i said a family yeah a family i said yeah exactly we're just one big great big family amen sure love and appreciate the family the lord has given me to watch over amen so god bless you let's turn in our bibles this morning to ephesians chapter one i'm looking forward to my lesson today and i call it that on purpose because i'm i'm going to i have so much that i want to cover i've decided today to make a powerpoint and actually use it amen sometimes i send a powerpoint to the booth and they just look at me like you actually going to use this today so i'm actually going to use it today because i have so many quotes and it doesn't mean i'm going to preach a long time but i want to i want to move through them quickly but there's a lot for you to take in today and there'd be no way just no way you'd get you'd be able to you'd get lost in the shuffle because we want to cover a great deal of ground today and actually make some simple points but there's nothing in the word of god that's really simple it's it's simple in it that christ reveals it but the meaning is profound and it has tremendous impact at least it should have tremendous impact in our lives ephesians chapter 1 verses 1 through 17 we'll read this through quickly and we'll let you be seated paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus so notice who this is to this is to saints and to the faithful in christ jesus so you get who it's too this isn't an address to the world to those outside of the faith really uh they're welcome to read it and if they read it and long to be that they can be good news you can be you can get included in this and have it speak to you today but i want you to understand he's speaking to people who are born again all right so it's to the faithful in christ jesus grace and this is an important word grace be to you and peace who to you from god our father our father and from the lord jesus christ all right verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed who us with how many all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ so to get these blessings you have to be in christ all right you're not entitled to them otherwise according as he now watch this these are some important verses according as he this is god hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world here's why here's why he did it that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will here's what it's going to accomplish to the praise of the glory of here's that word again his grace wherein he hath made us he hath made us by his grace hath made us accepted in the beloved now in whom we have this word is big redemption not just salvation the foolish virgin are saved from destruction but they're not born again the to so redemption is beyond basic salvation from destruction all right so so wherein he hath about all right verse 7 again in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us this is the redeemed and all wisdom and prudence those are two big big big big words wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will by revelation according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself now i'm sure that while you're included in all of this you should just be straight rejoicing because he's the one did it all you didn't really do anything you're just a beneficiary you're being it's being re you're you're getting the benefits of it see all right that in the dispensation of the fullness of times here's his grand scheme he might gather together in one all things in christ this is why he sent the prophets the priests the kings john jesus the disciples the holy ghost the ages the seals the prophet of this hour why did he do it the whole thing is one goal to gather everything in christ see because gathering everything in christ means expression you understand so god had all kinds of of characteristics in him unexpressed that's why he was lonely so his design was to gather it all in christ the elected son amen there's only one elected son remember it's not the man that comes predestinated it's a seed in him there's only one elected son that's jesus and i was in him before the foundation of the world so god is looking to express in christ in other words all the christ his entire family of of anointed amen remember when we say christ don't just limit it to jesus christ there's mrs jesus christ you understand all of the old testament were foreshadowing him all right and so we find then that he has a bride all right let's carry on verse 12 again that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after have after that ye believed after ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise it's after okay after you have believed you're sealed with the holy spirit of promise all right now how do you believe the holy spirit gives you a revelation amen all right now watch it's of revelation to you personally all right you accept it and you're sealed into the kingdom all right now watch all right verse 14 which is the earnest the ceiling of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him he's got a purpose in this he's got a goal paul here was paul's desire concerning you say what paul feel about me here you go that he may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him amen i'm going to break all that down there's really going to be a lesson an intensive deep dive lesson today and i want you to give me your undivided attention for about 60 minutes and we will i believe we can get through it father we thank you for your word we commit it to you i feel your nearness thank you for all the worship and singing i humble myself again i submit myself and surrender once more under your under your leadership in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you can be seated now you'll just forgive me if i go quickly but i'm going to give you visuals so you'll hear it and see it all right all right now i want to emphasize a number of words and we we we told you to be pay careful attention to several words and that is this grace that is that there's a wisdom and there there's a knowledge and there's a prudence all right and so we want to focus now down on verse uh uh all right now i want to now i want to go back to the scripture that i used last week in first peter 1 13 first from the king james bible before the powerpoint brother matt yeah so we want to have the presenter up and go to first peter 1 and verse 13. amen i may have messed that up in the message i sent back so my apologies if so uh first peter 1 13 from the king james and then i want to read that same verse out of several other translations wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end here's that word again for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ amen now i could go into other places to show you and prove to you that this is not just at his appearing in the sky all right because we're realizing that you're going to need a grace to get to that appearing in the sky and and the rapture isn't a lightning strike event it's a cycle of events and it's on now it's underway you're already being caught up into it amen all right that's that's what's now the proof of that is you're different from the world you live different think different you have a whole different world view of everything i i was saying to the west coast brothers and and a bible study uh yesterday or the day before i don't remember about how that you know when we when we look at the world and you know i i found it necessary to stop reading so many of the headlines because it's just too crazy and it causes me anxiety and literally you and i and i and i i like to stay informed i will occasionally just pull up headlines and just quickly to see if there's anything of interest usually there's not usually it's the same old stupid nonsense and perversions and sin and ungodliness and i just i don't even want to see that you say well but you're go you're going to miss out on the headlines well where do where do you get the news from i go to my bible now say well the bible isn't going to tell you the current headlines but it's going to tell me what's behind them it's going to tell me why they're there why it's happening i already know what's going to happen i know how it ends amen i know why it's here see i'd much rather know the why than the what and so i i know the end from the beginning so we we realized then that there is a a special grace that was to come at the end time at the revelation of jesus christ at the apocalypses at the uncovering at the when the mighty god is unveiled brother branham said he called it a rapturing faith but he also called it a rapturing grace and the headstone will come crying grace grace unto it this is a big word amen but now watch so now let me look at that from the from the new living translation first peter 1 13 from the nlt so prepare your mind see now the kjv said wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end the nlt says so prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control wait a minute i thought that there was this magical grace just gonna take over and everything would be fine there's a grace coming and you need to prepare to walk in it say well what is grace grace teaches us to deny ungodliness grace is what's coming to give you the desire in your heart to be different from the world but you still you're elected you've got a gene of god you've still got to be born again you've still got to surrender you've still got to have the holy ghost otherwise the seed never comes to life you understand you never produce a crop for the lord and if i can't produce a crop for him then lord just carry me on home because i that's the whole reason i'm here that's what makes it worth it that i can grow a crop here for the lord jesus so prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control when at the appearing of this grace when is that coming at the revelation at the uh at the unveiling of god when we had the mighty god unveiled do we then prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control you're not here to just gain theology i'm not here preaching to give you better i say this all the time not trying to give you better theology than the baptist we have better theology than they do because we have the full word back restored but it's supposed to do something in your life it's supposed to change you you're not just supposed to say amen how about we become an amen prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control put all your hope in the gracious salvation that will come to you when jesus christ is revealed to the world from the amplified translation first peter 1 13 again look at this brace up your minds somehow i have a different version than you have matt um okay it's all good it's all good let me let me read the one you've got so prepare your minds for action be completely sober in spirit steadfast self-disciplined spiritually and morally alert fix your hope completely on the grace of god that is coming to you when jesus christ is revealed so now these are action instructions that you say a prophet was to come he did the seals were to be open they have been christ was to appear and be among us he's here what's my job prepare your minds for action be completely sober in spirit be steadfast self-disciplined spiritually and morally alert it it staggers me sometimes at the stupor i see people who believe this message walk around in a cloud and and and you see it in the way they act the way they talk there's no spirituality there there's no real zeal they were certainly a believer they love the lord no kidding they believe the message but you can see it in in the in the places they go oh he's going to step on toes today i'm actually not but this might you can see it in the things they do you can see it in the way they dress you can see it in their attitude and their their actions and their reactions i'm sorry if that offends you but you need to you need to prepare your minds for action we're in a great hour this day be sober be vigilant don't don't walk around in a cloud of laodicea come to attention get ready put on the whole armor of god from the whis translation which they don't have i'll have to read it for you wherefore having put out listen to this now listen closely listen real close wherefore because you've been born again having put out of the way once for all everything that would impede the free action of your mind be see you had your nature changed you're no longer a prisoner and slave to sin satan can't force his way on you anymore since that's happened to you now that now that you've you you having put out of the way once and for all everything that would impede the free action of your mind be calm and collected in spirit and set your hope perfectly holy and unchangeably without doubt and despondency upon the grace that is being brought to you upon the occasion of the revelation of jesus christ so god has done something great in this hour now it's your turn you're to be christ to the world he's reconciling all things in christ that means your opinions got to go out the door your desires got to go out the door how you want to live lucy goosey and call yourself a message believer that's got to go he's that's not why he sent the message to leave you like that and then let you just live that old that old half half-world way that old half-world way and then somehow the grace is going to pull me across the line anyway you know i i'm not here to deny election but i don't want to get pulled and drug across the line i'd like to be upright and running when i cross the line so you live as an underachiever if you want to but as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord and i want to have my mind sober and prepared in all things for spiritual warfare i want to accomplish some things i want to beat the devil [Music] i want to be a king over him and over the flesh and over sinning over the world i'm told i can be but it's up to me so we go back now to ephesians chapter one and let's look at four and seven again brother matt in in the king james ephesians one four and 7 4-7 ephesians 1 4-7 according as he hath chosen us catch this now according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace so brother branham picks picks up this angle not necessarily that those verses but this angle of election and god's choosing and god's purpose in election god's purpose in redemption and i can tell you this say well tell me what it is first let me tell you what it's not and by contrast you'll get a you'll start to get an idea where i'm going jesus did not come to save the world amen he came to die for the sins of the whole world so that everybody could have a legitimate opportunity to be at least be saved from destruction but as far as redemption he came to save his own whom the father gave him he says thine they were and thou gave us them me and i've lost none of them and i can tell you there won't be one empty chair at that table there also won't be one extra placemat at that table amen this is god's doing and it's beautiful in our sight and so so when we think about it friends brother branham talks about how that it's got to be christ it's got to be the revelation of the spirit you can't save yourself and you can't decide to be saved even basic salvation god has to give you an opportunity and he might do that in a church he might he might do that he's only obligated to do it once he's only obligated to call a man one time that's all he's obligated to be fair see he might do that in a church hearing a sermon he might do it in your vehicle playing a gospel tune he might do it with you walking through the woods and seeing a tree and god just reveal himself to you in nature or the sun will rise up and declare his glory and you'll for a moment catch there must be and then you'll decide no no and you'll go on about your way and he's never obligated to call you again on the dead judgment he'll be justified in denying you entering see he and so so we so brother branham talks about this he's he talks about two different fellows this is in the message a true sign that's overlooked i don't have it in my powerpoint so to stand by matt so and i'm not going to read it all that's why i didn't put it in i'm not going to read it all and so in a true sign overlooked brother branham talks about two different men and he tells a story and he he tells about both of these men had terrible smoking habits and brother branham is actually relating a story how that he was in a like a little fellowship kind of like reminded me of us out here in the fellowship hall or maybe it's a you know when we're having a bible study or whatever sitting around talking because some man pipes up and says you know brother bill that that cigarette demon is hard to defeat and brother branham said you better believe it he said because it's a devil and he said it takes the grace of god he said now watch he said i knew two men one time and both of them that's his words both of them wanted to be men of god see and one of them he says brother brown starts talking about as soon as i led him to christ and he said he went back home and he said i brother branham had never said anything to him about the cigarettes had never showed him in the bible that it was wrong and that man was a chain smoker five six packs a day said he would sit down and just light one off of another and all day long go through five or six packs go bankrupt today doing that and so and so he and so he says he says but when he went to light that first cigarette sitting in his same old chair in the same old living room he said somehow he just couldn't make himself do it and he said what's wrong he didn't even know it was wrong brother branham hadn't even said a word about it it took him nowhere in the scripture but somehow and he said he just got up and he walked over to his old potbelly stove and he pitched all those smokes in there and they went up in flames and he said he's never smoked a day since and he's a servant of the lord and then he gives a contrasting story says the other fellow he also wanted to become a christian and watch this watch how brother rem says it he tried his best he cried out to the lord he quit them quit smoking for two or three weeks and when he come to his self in that condition what condition not delivered not really born again all he did was make a confession and all he's doing is trying to be a better person see the holy ghost isn't hard to get but if you're not willing to surrender every grain of who you are he's never going to come in and seal that vessel you understand you've when you come to that's why it's not hard to get and it doesn't take you don't got to fast 10 days or 40 days or any days or any hours in five minutes you could walk up here and completely surrender your entire life and give it over to christ and mean it from your heart and the lord who sees your heart knows it's real and he'll give you the holy ghost immediately on the spot that's his promise and he's never broken a promise but this man it becomes obvious it becomes apparent evidently he didn't ever do that because you can't make god lie right you know you can't make god lie and so so we find that that brother branham says you know he he came to himself in that condition he went out of his mind he said when he come to himself he found himself out in the backyard beating his head on a piece of tin and he said he run in the house real quick and grabbed his cigarettes and smoked a pack before he left the house that evening just one right after the other one right after the other and brother branham says see one was called amen and he quotes the scripture no man can come to me except my father draws him and all the father has given me will come to me what did the warning mean it was life to one he saw it you can't see it unless god reveals it [Music] see it's hid here's another scripture it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed to babes such as would learn that's right see the hour was close at hand you know you you you've got to throw down this this denominational church age man-made credo ideology that everybody can just come up and make a decision for jesus and i'm going to heaven that's not true you're wrong no no you're wrong that's not true that's never been true it's whom god calls and then you're given an opportunity see you can't just i remember years ago one of my buddies in a church i was just 14 15 years old myself and and i was already holding public bible studies at that time and teaching sunday school and and i spoke to him in the parking lot one day and i said hey pal i won't call his name i said you know you you need to give your heart to the lord because i knew he wasn't a christian i said you need to give your heart to the lord the rapture's coming soon and he said and he's walking into church and he came every service he never missed church that wasn't it that wasn't the problem and he's walking into church and i said it to him as he's walking in i said you need to give your heart to the lord and he said oh that's all right he said i'll just say jesus forgive me my sins and i'm fine and as a 14 15 year old boy i knew that's not right that can't be true it can't work like that and as i begin to study the scripture i realize it doesn't work like that it's never worked like that that's why if the lord calls upon your heart whatever you do accept it don't wait he's not obligated to ever call you a second time see and so he goes back in in his story about you know moses and and how his father amram and joseph they weren't afraid of the king's commandment they weren't afraid of the crocodiles see and brother branham says i want us it's all about election they noticed that he was a special child see brother branham says it's all about that it's just like that that that say you mean you mean there's special people in the world i'm sorry if that wrankles you but yes yes there are special people what are they called the elect lady they were in christ before the foundation of the world they're predestinated not to fall hallelujah see and he says i want to say this while i'm speaking of it it's not him that willeth or him that runneth it's god that showeth mercy that's right it's god so today i'm going to read you this so today let this sink deep if today god has called you and you separated yourself from the things of the world and the glorious power of god has sanctified you from them things here's the other half of it jd you should be the happiest person in the world because there was millions that would do it if they could but they can't it's not for them to have it this is the day watch now watch now you should be that happy because there'd be millions who would love to have the opportunity you have by your election and so if god has allowed you to see this word you ought to be the happiest person in the world see say what about my friends who don't who aren't elected god god offers them salvation there'll be millions of people outside the city who never believe the message the foolish virgin go through the tribulation for their sin of unbelief and rejecting the message that's a direct statement from the from the tape they go that's it out of the seventh seal they go through the tribulation for their sin of unbelief and rejecting the message but they'll they won't be in the millennium but they'll be there at the great white throne they're granted eternal life here to tell you something friends you people are going to get granted eternal life just because of their attitude toward god's family why does it work like that because it was christ in his family and they were honoring christ see they couldn't quite get it seeing it in nature they couldn't quite get it hearing a preached sermon but they could they could see it in another human and and they and and their heart response not a balanced scale of goods and you got 962 good deeds and only 747 bad deeds so you get to come in it's not not a balanced scale you can't go you can't get eternal life like that but it was their heart response when they were confronted by the word in whatever way it came i'm glad god's merciful that way i'm glad he's got it that way but i also want to be vigilant i want to be sober and i want to prepare my mind to say i'm elected and i see it and now i have a i have a duty to become christ to the world [Music] not just languish in my election and languish in my superior understanding of my r by revelation it's not about that if this church wants to have that i can promise you you will not see the power of god operating very very much not in a not to say not in a mighty way not hardly at all but if we want to see the power of god if we want to have life-changing power coming in if we want to see our children if we want to see the holy ghost if we want to see angels i'm here to tell you they'll be sober get your mind ready be prepared have self-control let the mind which was in christ be in you allow permit let the word dwell in you richly amen amen see it's in you by a seed gene of god everything you have needed for raptures in you see but it's in a seed form the whole purpose of of the holy ghost having freedom in your life is to bring those seeds to fruition so that you actually grow the crop in your life as brother jd was speaking this morning about operation of gifts see so we want to see the power of god you know it's not about praying god give me a gift that i wasn't born with but it's about god i want to see the gifts in operation i want to see the power of god moving in this church let me do my part and if there's a gift lying there then use it lord see but brother branham talks about you know those nine spiritual gifts he starts talking about anybody with the holy ghost's subject any one of those see so don't don't don't say well i'm just a i'm just a housewife i'm just a farmer i'm just a simple person don't despise the day of small things little as much if god is in it see and so so brother branham talks about people he said they run all over the place and make a whole lot of noise and he said they want the power of god when really he said they don't even know what the power of god is see see they run all over and make a whole lot of noise he said but the real power of god is surrendering your life and letting christ be all in all he said then he said then you have more power with god than the man that runs around making a lot of noise because you've learned to control yourself you've learned to let the holy spirit guide your life you've let you've let the brothers you've let the holy spirit tell you you shouldn't go there you shouldn't do that sisters stand in their closet deciding what to wear you you allow the holy spirit to go that first of all shouldn't even be in your closet much less on your body take that and burn it and go replace it with something that demonstrates god being all in all in christ in his family see brother branham said if you're not gonna live like a christian then please stop calling yourself that because you only make a disgrace and you only bring shame on the name of the lord if if the people only see in your life that you're no more than a denominational person then how are you going to witness to them about a message you're not in even any way different you know you say well i go to church so do they well we got missionary programs so do they well but i mean they got a they got a preacher that preached out of the bible so do they you know well they they they listen to gospel i listen to god's music so do they but i i cry tears and i pray to jesus so do they there's got to be something beyond that that separates you from the world see now let me show you where we have come to because i've read to you and i've challenged you to believe that we have arrived at the time of first peter 1 13 that we have arrived at the time of the revelation of jesus christ and this grace and this wisdom and this knowledge is supposed to be operating in you we're going to talk about it and break it down a little further so now watch what brother branham says concerning where we are now versus where man-made systems are in the ages of the church all right remember the church now at this point the church is no longer his mouthpiece remember that a bride was called out of the church you understand so so the age of of god dealing in the church is over that happened through seven ages and we're still in the seventh and last church age because the bride leaves the seventh one and goes into rapture so i'm not talking about the historical church age i'm talking about the age when god dealt in the church she put christ out she's no longer his mouthpiece well how would she be if she put him out she put him out and so now christ through a prophet sends a message into the earth to his elect lady don't stay in the church they're no longer my mouthpiece come out of her my people amen and now god now christ misses jesus christ as operating in the world do you understand that so brother branham says here so today let this sink in deep today god has called you and you separated yourself from the things of the world and the glorious power of god has sanctified you from them things you should be the happiest person in the world there was millions that would do it if they could but they can't it's not for them to have it why why why brother branham why why tell me why please tell me why okay you ready this is the day when the church is called out separated here's a direct quote it's different what it used to be it's different what it used to be back in the ages when he winked at a lot of their ignorance they didn't even have to have all the doctrine correct that's why luther could smoke a pipe and drink beer that's why i mean that's why john wesley could preach a trinitarian a doctrine of demons trinitarian doctrine is a doctrine of demons that's three unclean spirits like frogs in the book of revelation and yet he was the he was the church age messenger why because christ was back there interceding they didn't know what he fully looked like he hadn't come out yet he's back in the eternity he's interceding but in this hour he has stepped forward and the mighty god is unveiled and we see him wow so i i don't i don't that was wrong but you forgave and you winked at it but now today you've called me to be separate from that you've called me to be a different kind of a person i'm to come up to a higher level and to live above denominational christianity i'm different than that i'm beyond that amen so you see that and this is from the message so significant from the message a true sign that's overlooked and actually this is why the world is in the condition it's in because the world has failed to realize this massive point what what point that it's different than it used to be now you have acts 17 in parallel where paul said to those jews hey there was a time he winked at your ignorance you brought all those blood of bulls and goats and god accepted it it was a substitute he took it okay but that's done it's different now now the lamb of god has come and shed his blood and now the holy ghost is coming you've got to repent you've got to come to the fullness of the word you've got to repent of that old thinking you can't come under those symbols god won't honor well it was 1600 i don't care if it was 1600 years of sacrifice it could have been 16 million years of sacrifice but it was over and it wasn't coming back you understand and so where this is what the world has failed to realize this massive point that we have now paralleled acts 17 again we've come back to the full word the bright age has returned to the church it's returned that's what paul had you say is that a church age that bright age isn't a church age it's a special time within an age you understand this was the time even before the church ages started 1853 the church was perfect only when it when it slips away now brother branham picks it up from there and starts recording ages see but the the the jerusalem church didn't begin in 1853 you understand for two decades they went perfectly in line with the word of god and all the apostles died off and went away john is the last one he comes back from the isle of patmos with a book locked up in mystery and symbolism and and no one really understands what it all means and and even things john forbidden to write why because that seed had to go into the ground but part of the return of the alpha was the return of the pure word so we're in the brag time the bride age the pure word and the word only the pure word and the pure word only no more can you find redemption and a mongrelized word come out of her my people this is where the holy ghost is this is where the token seals see so it was so so it was a true sign that was overlooked in our day what sign brother jason the sign that elijah the prophet would forerun the second coming of christ just as we saw in his first coming a prophet whose scriptural mission was to call a bride out of a church in these last days and to reestablish a separated people come on friends a separated people are people caught up in the cycle of the rapture of people who pass from death into token life of people who are standing in the perfection of the word of people preparing for liftoff [Applause] hallelujah [Music] so he says all right um matthew give me again i i might get to that powerpoint so ephesians 1 let's look at 7-10 if i don't get it today we'll get it next time so ephesians 1 7-10 verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins now you understand now you understand why john would say if we walk in the light as he's in the light the we have fellowship one with another why because we're all in same family we've all got the holy ghost if we walk in the light as he's in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus cleanses us from all sin see so people who have not been born again of the spirit of god they might have a justif a justified state which is fine justification is wonderful but it only remits your past sins i don't help you in the future you understand it still doesn't make you born again it just simply god forgave you of all your sins because you asked him to and he was faithful and did it but what about tomorrow when you sin again see well i say well then what's the advantage of the holy ghost because when i got the holy ghost when tomorrow when i make another mistake i've got a blood speaking for me he didn't mean to do it he didn't mean to do it lord put it on my account put on my account he's my son he didn't mean to do it and if i and if i go the next week and make another mistake he didn't mean to do it lord he didn't mean father forgive him father forgive him he didn't mean to do it hallelujah that's what the blood of christ does for me the blood speaks for me hallelujah in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence there's those two words wisdom and prudence going to look at them having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure with he which has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times here it is here's our goal here's what he's doing he might gather together in one all things in christ in other words that i might have a a family of christ's throughout the earth amen to take in a rapture amen both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so when we look at god's grace here's here's here's here so we got these three words his grace and his wisdom all right and his understanding all right so grace is given and this is an important point one of the advantages of his grace is it's given to enable believers to understand his will see people go to church and join a church but they they don't they can't really change their life to become pleasing to him because first of all they don't even they don't even know what ali said and they won't get told everything he said from the pulpit and even if they do come here and hear it they they still can't they still don't get it unless his grace comes upon you and you understand the nature behind the commandment jesus said take my yoke upon you for my my burden is light my yoke is easy it's not hard to do you actually don't even have to do anything just get converted and it lives through you say what what do i do how do i how do i strengthen that well there's a way the holy ghost in you feeds on the word so get in your bible listen to the tapes come to church have fellowship these are the ways we strengthen ourselves you understand if you want the power of god moving freely see and so grace is given to believers to enable them to understand his will so it comes from god as a divine wisdom and an understanding that's how this great grace that's how it's meted out to you that's the form it comes in when it comes upon you it's not just a fuzzy feeling when this grace when the mighty god is revealed to you it gives you a divine wisdom and a divine understanding and paul speaks of this word wisdom it's sophia he talks about it on in verse 17. he go he talks about it in chapter three of ephesians he goes into colossians talks about in chapter one chapter two chapter three chapter four this this wisdom in other words this wisdom is the objective insight into the true nature of god's revelation in other words it's it's objective it's unbiased it's not contaminated by your own thinking anymore not even your own thinking it has nothing to do with denominationalism you've given up your ideology of what you think god is this wisdom that god gives you is an unbiased it is an it's independent from all man-made theology thanks be to god that's what the grace of our lord jesus christ has given me it gave me a wisdom to understand his nature to understand the nature of god's revelation and this word understanding that paul speaks of literally is the personal apprehending of it so so that believers are able to grasp the divine purpose of the ages so you understand what happened and why it happened the world even if you tell it to them can look on it as just history but you get wow i understand why the history well tell me do tell well because see they had a perfect word and then but that seed had to go into the ground because remember jesus said that except the corn of wheat died about his loan so that seed had to fall i get it now wow no wonder no wonder it had to fall it had to go down through the dark ages well then what's this message about well in the bible god said that would happen and then he would restore it all back and the end would come back to the beginning and we'd go in a rapture i get it i get it say well i don't know about a prophet then you cut yourself off from being able to get it because that's who god uses that's what he did in in the alpha he used paul and he used elijah in this last day to do what bring us the mighty god unveiled amen i get that i should obey it i get why i should obey it i get what he done and i get why he done it so we're able to grasp his divine purpose where we're given to see its relevance in real time here at the end time what a privilege friend this is accomplished because god because god here's why it's accomplished because because you smelled good you were a nice person you were smarter than the average bear no it's accomplished because god made known unto us the mystery of his will [Music] that he's bringing all things into an expression called christ this is why he deals with my life this is why he won't let me be like the world this is why he won't let you this is why he makes me preach these sermons this is why you hear the prophet screaming out on a tape this is why sometimes it seems like the preachers in your business this is why because he's made known to us the mystery of his will that he's determined to bring all of his family into one grand expression where we're all identical christ see now all right matt let's do it title screen praise the lord so i'm continuing from last week the final season okay you're dismissed i'm just kidding okay uh you're controlling it hey matt so next the harvest time all right now here we come to the statue of perfect man now don't read ahead of me all right if you do you're going to read what you've already read a million times anyway but just let me let me go along it's it's shocking to me it defies logic to me that people can't follow the simple way brother branham taught this pyramid that it has actually been taught to me by seasoned veterans that you see you first have to perfect your faith and virtue knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness then he'll give you the holy ghost and seal you in i'm like oh if i can do that why do i need him if i can already perfect myself what do i need how redundant would the holy ghost be because i can already do all that myself and see here's what brother branham taught you can't do that and if you and even if you would manage to do a version of it which wouldn't be perfect it'd still be filthiness to god it'd still be filthy rags to him even if you could manage a version of it so brother branham said all you'd do is you'd be a blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in your tail to make everybody think you're a peacock and he said you wouldn't be you'd still be a black bird you're still unconverted so so these things can't be human accomplishment and that's why the foundation is faith what is the new birth that's why when brother branham drew the original drawing and i have it he drew a space of line underneath faith because that's the door that's where you come in that's christ what is the new birth it's a revelation of jesus christ to you pers personally to you brother ram said that's what faith is a revelation you see friends first of all is this is this the an uh a reflection of the church yes is it a reflection of a man a christian yes well you don't have the church until you get the holy ghost so how do you already have a church if it's not even have the holy ghost yet you see you don't have the holy ghost on the day of pentecost you didn't have the church until the holy ghost came then you had the church neither do you have the man until the until the new birth you see so you come in at faith and then from there now i'm going to prove it to you in a minute then you say well why does brother branham have the holy ghost right here well there's a very simple explanation for that listen to what he says statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtue now see it's not going to do you any good if it's just all human add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience to your patients godliness to your brotherly to your godliness brotherly love to your brotherly love the holy spirit and christ will come next because just beneath him the holy spirit of jesus christ into the church to manifest those virtues you understand he's he got him right here because he's got to be and brother branham i didn't put the quotes up and brother branham in his drawing he says you see he said look in that pillar of fire he said look in that amber light he said you'll see that burled wavy colors he said it's moving all through there why why does it look like that because it's a living being it's the glory of god you understand and he says in that that is shining down through the church or down through the man christ is the head the holy ghost is the head this is what when when this is in complete control of this around the world then the rapture takes place now the capstone comes in the form of the open word already christ among us now but i'm still looking for a corporal appearing you understand all right next brother branham says same message i pledge this morning to him with all my heart this after he taught what i just showed you i pledge to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace i pray that i'll seek daily without ceasing until i feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old stature of mine till i become a manifestation of the living christ it's no so let me ask you a question as brother branham preached a sermon and he's now admitting friends i'm sorry i'm not even born again i just realized i just realized that i haven't even got all of these living yet so i must not have the holy ghost sorry so are you going to make him unborn again of course he's born again and now he's saying now that i've realized how this works that it's christ over the church over the man the mind of christ moving down bringing bringing through me bringing all things together in the expression of christ he says that i pledge with all my heart here's what you should pledge today that by his help and by his grace remember it gives you wisdom and understanding remember you gotta apply it to your life you gotta gird up your mind you gotta be self-controlled why because that because if your self-controlled he has no obstructions he can flow through you now watch so i pray by his help by his grace i pray that i'll seek daily daily daily what if it read like this i'll i'll pray that i'll seek every time i come to church occasionally well i'm better than that brother jason i come on wednesdays and sundays okay so you'll you'll seek on wednesdays and sundays brother branham says i'll seek daily without ceasing well when i got time when i without ceasing until i feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little stature of mine till i can be a manifestation of the living christ yes lord yes now watch this next and the church all right won't finish it israel and the church part four i believe we're on the borderline tonight i was wondering about all my meetings and things how i had to cancel them out i truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's going to have rapturing faith we can't even have faith for divine healing let alone rapturing faith got to have faith that'll change now watch because faith comes by hearing the word so i've just said to people many times how you expect to have a rapturing faith without a rapturing word if all you've got is the word of the ages how are you going to go in a rapture see and so so he says we can't even have faith for divine healing let alone rapturing faith gotta have a faith that will change and quicken this body and be taken away i believe there's a church on its road tonight thank god a power of the living god that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming out not psychologists not some of this put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed holy ghost called out church now watch what brother branham says next now the voice now watch brother branham comes into revelation chapter 4 part 3. all right he's teaching on revelation 4. the voice of the throne you'll notice in in several places in revelation if i'd i could i don't want to show them all because i don't want to get sidetracked on it but there's numbers of places in the book of revelation where you hear about thunders and lightnings thunders and lightnings chapter 4 talks about there was voices and thunders and lightnings and there's another place where said i the the heaven was open i saw the the the ark and he said and there were lightnings and thunderings and voices and then it happens again a third time later on now watch now the voice of the throne notice in this throne before the throne was the seven stars all right read along with me the voice of the stars voices you see there was more in the revelation four here five we find out and out of the throne preceded lightning thunders and voices not one voice voices plural what was it simple explanation god speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits all right now just hold right there man so god is reflecting himself through the seven spirits so it's not one voice it's plural voices what is lightnings and thunders voices all right it's god speaking to the church reflecting himself through seven spirits he say okay i got it it's god speaking right right but now let's watch how god does it watch how god speaks next slide when the true anointed of god speaks it's the voice of god amen to reject it is to remove the candlestick see voices the voice of the seven church ages over here in the corner the voice is speaking with thunder and lightning next slide where's the holy spirit here at the throne shining out in in each church age the church ages now look the church age is reflecting back this way the voices of god now remember our pyramid he's reflecting above you down into the church and your life is turned around reflecting back to him so that he's he sees his own reflection in the church and that's the voice of god because his family is a living voice of god in the earth watch the church age is reflecting back this way the voices of god jesus christ the same yesterday and forever how does god prove he's the same yesterday and forever by operating through his family that's what that's how he proves it that the same signs and wonders they had in the early church we have the same signs and wonders here the same power the same doctrine the same spirit the same lives the same results you understand it proves you're he's remember he's reconciling all things in the expression of christ you are that's why brother branham would make tremendous statements like you are the blood of god by the spirit that he would say she is him she has thus saith the lord she knows what he wants done with his word she he would call her mrs jesus christ so now you're understanding a broader a broader thinking of all of these voices these thunders and these lightnings and these voices watch so he says the voice of god jesus christ same yesterday and forever see seven there was voices and seven lamps of fire seven spirits which are the seven spirits of god next now he's going to go to ezekiel i'm going to try to wrap it up in about 15 minutes so he's going to go to ezekiel he says now when ezekiel saw the glory of god he saw the same thing that john saw you remember last sunday we got how the glory of god and got the picture here he had taken with us you remember that the glory of god same thing ezekiel saw same thing john saw it here today makes jesus christ the same in ezekiel's time does that make sense to you so john knows it's the same one because he knows that's what ezekiel saw all right these four living creatures all right i'm sorry that print is so small but just stay stay right there all right so he says um go back to the previous slide matt okay i apologize okay now uh just stay stay right there for a minute i must not have put these two frames in john saw it here today jesus makes jesus christ the same in ezekiel's time same thing was here on earth same god that's here with us today same yesterday and forever that which was which is shall come thee the entrance to the soul body and spirit the brazen sea the world the sanctifier of our soul the filler with the holy spirit the same thing see just the same now all right next frame now we go to ezekiel's vision uh how did you did you just there you go all right so we come here to ezekiel um one i don't know why that's out of sync but it's okay i'm gonna forge ahead now watch here's ezekiel 1 12. and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went now let me let me give you a little insight here so you don't just go into a fog john sees a wheel in the middle of the wheel all right and it's what he's seeing is a bunch of different creatures living creatures and he's seeing all kinds of things and he's noticing that when the leader moves they all move and when the leader moves they all move and and they never go backwards because the word doesn't go backwards what they will do is they'll go this way or they might turn and go this way but if even if they turn and go this way they're still going forward and they turn they're always going forward and when the christ moved the creatures moved you understand the wheel move what is it showing it's showing god in control through his anointing on his family in the earth because these living creatures are anointings on the people you're today under an eagle anointing that's why it makes you act like you act you say why why am i living such a life of a believer because the anointing that's on you is living that kind of a life and when the holy spirit moves forward you just move forward and sometimes that forward movement friends leave you family leave you churches might boot you out but you have to go because the spirit is moving and however it moves i'm moving with it i i'm never going backwards i'm not standing still i'm not sitting on my luggage waiting on the old ship of zion i'm on the move see and so next next slide all right um close enough yeah there's there's what i there's what i read okay next slide all right um next one all right now we're caught up so they couldn't turn if they was going this way it was go like like a man going this way or going like an eagle going this way like an ox going this way they was going like a lion they couldn't go backward they had to go forward everywhere they went one each one of the beasts now what does a beast mean in the bible power all right a pat a means a power ver next slide as for the likeness of the living creatures and their appearance was like burning coals of fire like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire now jd watch this and out of the fire went forth light that's god from the fire went light not cosmic light now the eternal light brother jason i were talking about the eternal fire that fell on sodom say well if it's eternal it'd still be burning today it's not campfire fire it's not campfire this isn't cosmic light it's not campfire fire it's not what you got with a log it's it's eternal fire it's eternal light it's god's fire it's god's light see and so so watch now so he says and the living creatures ran and turned let's see the living creatures ran and returned and as the appearance of a look at this there it is again a flash of lightning now as i beheld the living creature behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures which is his four faces brother brown says the appearance of wheels see here's ezekiel 1 as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and their appearance of land and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and fire was bright out of the fire went forth lightning it a it was a wheel in the middle of a wheel what's the symbol here brother branham what is it it means that these guards these guards was god's ark next they were in journey rolling on wheels when ezekiel saw them but when john saw them they had already come to the right position in heaven remember john was caught up to the end to the lord's day amen and he saw the elders and he saw the living creatures around the throne and they weren't roaming the earth anymore and and john is weeping and crying and yet one of the elders is able to say to him john stop crying why should i stop crying because i'm already at the end and i already know we win and i already know we get here and you don't have to worry you're you've been caught forward you're you're still you're still thousands of years ago but you've been caught forward to the end day i'm just want to tell you go back and tell the church no matter what you see through 2000 years it's okay we make it we make it john saw those anointings and they were before the throne they weren't rolling on the earth anymore i'm here to tell you something friends we're getting home this message is getting you home hallelujah he is bringing all things together in the expression of christ they were rolling wheels as they took it from place to place minute was in travel they took it all the way up through the wilderness and all the way to the temple and so forth but now it's received up because the church age is over it's received into glory you don't see see so so that that's why you don't see these living creatures again these four beasts you don't see them again after revelation 19 4. amen you don't see them again you know you know you know what you know what the next event is once they bow out and their their job is done then you see christ and his armies which is his bride riding out and then from there the river of life and from there the holy city and from there the spirit and the bride say come i'm here to tell you something friends you have you have arrived by every sign of the bible that we are in the last moments of history and we're already in the cycle of a rapture and we're getting ready to to sit at a table thousands of miles long hallelujah see so so so brother branham brother branham will go on and on and on to talk about the the spirit the lightning the thunder and we find that he'll go into the first seal he'll go into the fourth seal even he'll even pick up moses and elijah and the tribulation says they can call for flies and they can call for anything see because it's the word of god remember he says satan gets slain by a sword that comes out of the mouth of god remember that in book of revelation but then brother branham says but it's actually he said moses is the one speaking god came to moses and said now i've come down i've heard the cries of my people but i'm sending you i promised him i'd deliver them but i'm going to do it through you and and and brother branham said he gets slain by the word that proceeds out of their mouth when they come against the anointed that's when moses and elijah have that power brother branham talks about them operating that's those seven thunders see the seven thunders aren't just aren't just for us they they actually are the the the mystery truths that bring us to rapturing faith and take us off the earth but that keeps right on rolling moses and elijah pick up the same message and carry it back to israel while we're sitting at a table thousands of miles long oh my friends you realize this is god god is suppressing himself this is what the message is all about sit up young men sit up please if you didn't go to bed last night don't come in here if you're sleepy just stay home sit up pay attention amen so i've studied too hard i've worked too hard it's too important times too late stakes are too high your lives are at stake so i'm sorry if that sounds rude of me but this is important important it's important and and so so we find that that god is expressing himself in this last day to become christ in a living church you know something friends i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap up in close because i i've i know i've sponged your minds already i got a ton more to say we'll pick it up next time let me say this sometimes i don't think we realize just how vulnerable life is i got a hard lesson of that recently when i came close to checking out unexpectedly and it's changed my whole heart and my whole mind it's done something to me and i realize that every day i'm alive i'm here by his grace and i don't think you realize how vulnerable let's just talk about human biology for a minute i mean put yourself on a jet you're in a metal tube at an atmosphere you can't breathe in going nearly the speed of sound and if even a window would crack everybody in the aircraft would die in seconds you said well it dropped down your lungs would implode you'd be at 35 000 feet you understand i don't think you realize just how vulnerable you go down the road you're driving 70-80 miles an hour and a tire blows or somebody does something stupid in front of you and statistically if if you have an accident at 80 miles an hour this is statistically and leave the road your chances of surviving statistically are zero statistically there's not even enough survivors to make it 0.1 percent if you leave the road at 80 miles an hour your chances are it's just the mercy of god do you realize you can go out you could walk outside and a mosquito bite you and you catch a zika virus that could you i mean do you realize how vulnerable do you realize how fleeting life is do you realize you could be in mcdonald's tomorrow and a shooter walk in do you realize what things could happen do you realize that that that the plagues and judgments have started listen to me young people the plagues and judgments have started in 1964 with the anchorage alaska that's thus saith the lord by a prophet the judgments began in anchorage alaska in 1964 and they're going to keep unrolling and keep on rolling and that's what's happening now the world's gone the earth is it's burning down and i don't think you realize that your life is so vulnerable you live by the mercies of jesus christ and god's got you here for a purpose and i just say if that's the case then why would i be so dumb as to not just go ahead and surrender my whole life to him now i just want to say today lord i want to be that thunder and lightning i want to be i want that power of god i want to be the expression of god i want to see that coming down i want it in my home my family my children my grandchildren your children your grandchildren come on friends we're all in this thing together amen let's and and you say well i brother jason i i've said amen to the word okay thank you but i thought about it today i thought lord i don't just want to say amen to the word how about i become an amen to the word how about my whole life becoming a man and my life testifies amen to every word of god and i'm not ashamed my life demonstrates that i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because i know it's the power of god unto salvation i want to become an amen the bible says that we are to cast down any thought or imagination that exalts itself against the word of god now i don't want that to just be in my mind i don't just want to agree with that and say that i'm going to cast that thought down i want my life to agree with that that whenever some action comes into my life my life will say no to that and amen to the word that's what it's all about friends that is how christ is gathering all god is gathering all things together in christ you get that let's stand god bless you amen come musicians brother kenny bring your team back hallelujah amen amen whatever you would choose brother ken why don't you bow your heads with me over the building today all over the church would you bow your heads please close your eyes be still for just a moment i know it's long and it's getting late and i know your minds are tired but could we give the holy spirit just a minute here this is this is critical friends this is your children this is your family their lives are almost at stake this church the power of god everything right here at the closing scenes the devil wants to rock all of us to sleep the devil wants to to make you prioritize everything and and and he's so crafty now just keep your heads about and listen to me for a minute i just want to tell you how the lord spoke to me this morning we're living in a day where there's such a blending of light and darkness i've said this to you before but i really want you to pay attention it's not like before remember it's not like back in the age of the church we're now been called out separated now simultaneously as brother diggs preached for us simultaneously while god is calling a church up into the revealed light of the hour satan is taking his throne over his satan's eden and so you have this supreme light in supreme darkness mingling together and there's such a blending there's such a blending and i want you to think up think about what i'm going to describe it to you back in the day way back in yesteryear it was pretty clear what was right and wrong i mean you didn't go to the bar rooms because you knew that was wrong you didn't go to the red light district in town because you knew that was wrong you knew what a brothel was you knew not to be in there you knew not to smoke and drink and curse and those things were just black and white and plain sassafras and everybody knew but we've hit a time now where there is such a blending of light and darkness and the tree of knowledge of good and evil right beside the tree of life to where satan has now taken things that it's unclear how harmful this might be here's something over here well what about it it seems fine it's just a technology it's just a this or it's just a that but wait a minute wait a minute did you know do you know friends that you have to have a mind prepared for prayer did you know that you have to exercise it you know it's like a muscle that you have to exercise do you do you realize that if your mind is all filled with just social media you're never gonna you can't you don't have the patience to pray because you gotta see what the next post is or the next tick tock or the next twitter or the next facebook or the next instagram and you it's it's like a craving you're almost like an addict you can't say oh i can i don't have to look at that well then let's see you pray for an hour well i don't think i can why why not because your mind isn't exercised for it your mind is so filled with entertainment that you don't have an exercised spirit you don't have any self-control to spend some quiet time with the lord to sit in a quiet place and block out the world and open your bible and read page after page after page chapter after chapter and just quietly talk and meditate on the things of god i'm not saying you're a bad person i'm sure you love god but you don't have a mind exercised to even be able to do that the blending of light and darkness has so clouded you that you've got things in your life and in your home and their activities and their games and their recreations and their entertainments and their business and their contacts and their social media and it's all integrated now to be a businessman you better be on social media if you want to have a successful business you better have your name out there there's nothing wrong we're not saying these things are wrong in and of themselves but how has the devil you got to have a career you got to work you got to pay bills you got to feed kids but how has the devil so prioritized those things in your mind that you don't even have a mind exercised for prayer you don't have a mind that can that's exercise to just sit quietly and read your bible or to put put put those headphones on and how about you turn on a voice of elijah the prophet when do we do that but yet we have no problem spending an hour in front of a screen two hours five hours nine hours adults kids and adults that let their kids preachers pastors we've all been guilty of it i want to tell you something friends it's not like it used to be god has called us out separate this is such a blending i'm here to tell you let me tell you something let me tell you something mom dad teenagers listen to me listen to your pastor if you don't have a sharp precision calibrated spiritual compass you're finished you're finished the blending is too blended it's too obscure it's the the bad is so intermingled with the good you'd have to go live in a commune to escape it you can't escape it i'm here to tell you you can't so the only way you're going to combat it is to turn your eyes away from a lot of it and turn your eyes upon jesus spend some time looking full into his wonderful face you know what will happen almost like magic the things of this world will grow strangely dim and you'll realize you enjoy the presence of god what was i missing all my life this is wonderful you can sit and have that feeling come down over you and just such peace and harmony it doesn't make all your troubles go away but you're not afraid of them anymore you have a purpose in life you're not aimless you don't feel bored brother branham says people don't want to pray anymore they don't want to read their bible it's it's boring to them it's because they don't have a mind exercise to it they've let the they've let the blending of light oh they're believers oh sure it's a blending remember what i'm saying it's a blending of light and darkness you're a believer i get that you really do believe it you really are you really do love god i'm not denying that the lord isn't denying that but are you is god able to bring all things together in you in the expression of christ those living creatures were guardians that's what they're doing in you now they're guarding the way of life in you your life is now an expression of that living creature that anointing that's guarding the way to the tree of life when people see you and follow you they can find their way home when people come with a with a misinter when uh when one christian so-called denominational whatever walks into a crowd and they don't look anything different from the world see they're not guarding the way people look at them and go i'm just as good as them but when you walk in see you're guarding the way you're saying no no that over there is not an example of christ i'm an example of christ i'm guarding the way to the tree of life that's what those cherubs were doing that's the anointing on this bride today as the scripture says gird up your minds gird up your minds prepare yourselves get ready let your life be an anointed life don't just say amen to the word become amen to the word yeah thank you i'm done i've been given permission to stop the holy spirit is here i hope every head and every heart is still bowed the holy spirit is here to help you friends the holy spirit didn't show up here today didn't set me through hours and days and days of study to harm you he's here to help you [Music] i'm here to announce to you if you never hear another word i say it's not like it used to be we've come to a different time now this is a time where the fullness of christ is to be on display in our lives i pray you'll grant it today lord i pray your anointing beyond the audience i thank you for letting me stay out of the way i thank you for your truth that you've given us today it's what will get us home lord i pray today that teenagers and parents and single and married and of all ages and race and gender will realize how privileged they are today to have been here and heard this word to see their position in christ and what is available to them don't let them miss it lord don't let them languish in carnality don't let them stay the same
