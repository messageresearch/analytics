[45:20] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[45:23] faith
[45:24] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[45:26] love may be able to comprehend with all
[45:28] saints
[45:30] what is the breadth and length and depth
[45:31] and height and to know the love of
[45:34] christ which passeth knowledge
[45:37] that you might be filled with all the
[45:39] fullness of god i never cease to get
[45:42] amazed that paul is saying to this
[45:44] ephedian believers who have been born
[45:47] again for three decades
[45:49] and he's saying i want you to be filled
[45:52] amen so there's one filling in many
[45:54] refillings amen and there's a uh we'll
[45:57] know as we follow on to know remember
[46:00] i've said to you many times
[46:02] you know it's god didn't meet you at an
[46:04] altar and say okay you're saved see you
[46:06] in heaven
[46:08] you know he he's he has a grand purpose
[46:11] and we want to talk about that grand
[46:12] purpose of our life today
[46:15] amen so that you may verse 18 may be
[46:18] able to comprehend
[46:20] with all the saints what is the breadth
[46:22] and length and depth and height and to
[46:24] know the love of christ which passeth
[46:27] knowledge that you might be filled with
[46:30] all the fullness of god now
[46:32] unto him that is able to do exceedingly
[46:35] exceeding abundantly
[46:37] above all that we ask or think according
[46:41] to the power that worketh in us that's
[46:43] that's the uh
[46:45] somebody someone says
[46:48] god's got all of this for me what's the
[46:49] catch well there's a little there's a
[46:50] catch
[46:52] that
[46:53] now unto him that is able to do
[46:55] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[46:58] ask or think how many want that
[47:00] but here's the limitation
[47:02] according to the power that worketh in
[47:05] us
[47:06] so however much prophet said however
[47:08] much you'll empty out of the world
[47:10] christ will come in and take that so how
[47:12] much do you want from him he you can
[47:14] have it all
[47:15] but it's going to require surrender it's
[47:17] going to require letting him come into
[47:19] your life seeing that you're you don't
[47:22] realize you're your got your hand on the
[47:24] regulator
[47:26] amen the lord's purpose remember i've
[47:28] said to you before the lord's purpose is
[47:30] that you be filled with all so
[47:33] don't don't leave here today
[47:35] and say oh i wish god would do this i
[47:37] wish god do that i wish i could have
[47:38] this always could have that you know the
[47:40] only decision to be made here is yours
[47:42] because you now already know his
[47:45] his decision is to fill you with all
[47:47] what's your decision
[47:48] see are you willing to let him be all
[47:52] see
[47:52] so you're a free moral agent he's not
[47:54] going to force himself on you all right
[47:57] now verse 20 now unto him that is able
[47:59] to do exceeding abundantly above all
[48:01] that we ask or think according to the
[48:03] power that worketh in us verse 21 unto
[48:07] him be glory in the church by christ
[48:09] jesus throughout all ages
[48:12] world
[48:13] without end
[48:15] amen
[48:17] i want to speak to you today on
[48:19] a world
[48:20] between worlds
[48:23] let's pray father
[48:25] we commit ourselves into your hands just
[48:27] now
[48:28] we ask for your divine anointing lord
[48:31] we've we've read the word and we know
[48:33] that the word comes anointed it's the
[48:36] bible says there's a blessing just
[48:37] reading it or even there's a blessing
[48:39] just hearing it read
[48:41] so father we know the word is anointing
[48:43] anointed but it's we now that's both
[48:46] speaker and hearer
[48:48] who stand in need of a supernatural
[48:50] anointing otherwise lord the gospel is
[48:53] just knowledge and it's just a letter
[48:55] and that doesn't really accomplish the
[48:57] goal it's got to be anointed by the
[48:59] spirit of god lord it's got to be able
[49:01] to come to life so i pray that you'll
[49:04] grant that today
[49:06] we have some visitors here lord and
[49:09] others streaming and i just appreciate
[49:11] all the the saints of god lord who have
[49:13] come out today to hear from you we
[49:16] commit ourselves into your hands for
[49:18] service
[49:19] much on my heart limited time to say it
[49:22] so would you just take over and say the
[49:25] portions that you want said father we
[49:27] and the way you want it said we commit
[49:30] it to you in jesus name amen god bless
[49:33] you as you're seated and if you'll find
[49:35] your place in genesis 28
[49:40] now how i'm going to get
[49:42] ephesians 3 and genesis 28 connected
[49:46] i know not but
[49:48] it's the it's what i have on my heart
[49:55] all
[49:56] right
[49:58] and we're going to begin at verse
[50:01] 10.
[50:02] genesis 28
[50:04] and 10.
[50:09] and jacob went out from beersheba and
[50:13] went toward haran
[50:15] and he
[50:16] and he lighted upon a certain place
[50:19] and tarried there all night because the
[50:21] sun was set
[50:23] and he took he took of the stones of
[50:25] that place and put them for his pillows
[50:28] and lay down in that place to sleep
[50:32] and he dreamed and behold a ladder was
[50:34] set up on earth and the top of it
[50:36] reached to heaven
[50:37] and behold the angels of god ascending
[50:41] and descending on it
[50:43] and behold the lord stood above it and
[50:45] said
[50:46] i am the lord god of abraham thy father
[50:49] and the god of isaac
[50:51] the land whereon thou liest to thee will
[50:55] i give it and to thy seed
[50:58] and thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[51:00] earth and thou shalt spread abroad to
[51:02] the west and to the east and to the
[51:04] north and to the south
[51:06] and in thee and in thy seed shall all
[51:09] the families of the earth be blessed
[51:11] and behold i am with thee and will keep
[51:14] thee in all places wither thou goest and
[51:17] will bring thee again into this land
[51:21] for i will not leave thee until i have
[51:24] done that which i have spoken to thee of
[51:28] and jacob awakened out of his sleep and
[51:30] he said surely the lord is in this place
[51:32] and i knew it not
[51:34] and he was afraid and said how dreadful
[51:36] is this place that in nuna this is none
[51:39] other but the house of god and this is
[51:42] the gate of heaven
[51:44] and jacob rose up early in the morning
[51:46] and took the stone that he had put for
[51:48] his pillows and set it up for a pillar
[51:52] and poured oil upon the top of it
[51:55] and he called the name of that place
[51:57] bethel
[51:58] because the name
[52:00] of that city was called luz at the first
[52:04] and jacob vowed a vow saying
[52:07] if god will be with me and will keep me
[52:10] in the way that i go
[52:12] and will give me bread to eat and
[52:14] raiment to put on so that i come again
[52:17] to my father's house in peace
[52:19] then shall the lord be my god
[52:22] and this stone which i have set for a
[52:25] pillar shall be god's house
[52:27] and of all that thou shalt give me i
[52:31] will surely give the tenth unto thee now
[52:36] we
[52:37] realize here that that jacob
[52:40] this is quite a scene and i i hope you
[52:43] can get your mind around what our
[52:46] brother
[52:47] was seeing here i mean he's just in a
[52:50] wilderness area he's at a location where
[52:53] he thinks he knows where he's at there's
[52:54] a city named luz and
[52:56] and he's gonna bed down for the night
[52:58] and suddenly he has a dream and he
[53:02] realizes in this dream that he literally
[53:05] made his bed at the gate at the gate of
[53:07] heaven
[53:08] and he
[53:09] sees the world he's standing on
[53:12] but now he sees another world above him
[53:15] and he sees a ladder that's connecting
[53:19] two worlds and angels ascending and
[53:22] descending on this ladder and he sees
[53:25] the lord standing at the top of the
[53:27] ladder looking down on his life and
[53:30] begins to speak to him and the lord
[53:32] begins to covenant with jacob that
[53:35] here's what i'm going to do for you
[53:36] jacob and here's my covenant with you
[53:39] and your seed and then jacob will
[53:43] will return that
[53:45] that pledge god is pledging to jacob
[53:47] jacob is pledging to god if this is what
[53:50] your choice for me and you'll do
[53:52] everything that you've said then i'm
[53:54] here to tell you that i will you'll be
[53:56] my god and i'll i'll follow that now
[54:00] uh you know so so when we talk about you
[54:04] know worlds be
[54:06] between a world between worlds i want
[54:10] you to think for just a moment now and
[54:12] let me just try to capture your mind to
[54:14] where my mind is
[54:16] now we we know
[54:19] according to the book of ephesians uh
[54:22] particularly chapter one and i'm not
[54:23] going to turn to a lot of this today
[54:25] because it would just slow me down and
[54:27] i'm not trying to teach this per se
[54:30] we're just trying to preach something
[54:31] inspirational to you as the lord laid it
[54:33] on my heart
[54:35] but we know
[54:37] as bible readers
[54:39] excuse me
[54:41] if you read in ephesians 1
[54:43] and especially when you come to
[54:45] ephesians 1 and 4 and 1 and 9
[54:48] you can go over into the book of romans
[54:50] and find you you're going to find out
[54:52] romans chapter 8
[54:54] you're going to find out in your reading
[54:56] that god has a great purpose for your
[54:59] life and that actually you're going to
[55:01] find out that all of the family of god
[55:05] started in god before the foundation of
[55:08] the world
[55:10] and so we can see by the bible that
[55:13] before there was ever stardust
[55:16] that i had an existence
[55:19] previous to the one i have now
[55:21] now we're not here to teach on that we
[55:23] we're we're not here to break all that
[55:25] down and we certainly don't believe some
[55:27] of the you know um over the over the
[55:30] edge doctrine that that some different
[55:32] sex and things taken different movements
[55:34] have taken we're just simply here to to
[55:37] just say it like a prophet said it you
[55:39] existed
[55:41] now you were in his mind but say oh well
[55:43] okay then i was just if i was just in
[55:45] his mind that was just a figment of his
[55:46] thought well not exactly it's a little
[55:48] more than that
[55:49] because now if you were just in my
[55:51] thoughts that's all you'd be
[55:53] you would just have been a figment of my
[55:55] thought there would have been no sense
[55:56] of reality to you
[55:58] but we find that god's thoughts are
[56:00] different because he's god
[56:02] and his thoughts actually are a form of
[56:05] reality that all that that are real
[56:08] god's thoughts are real they don't have
[56:10] to be expressed become real the
[56:13] expression is just that it's a further
[56:15] expression
[56:16] but whatever come out of god's mind
[56:19] whatever was in god's mind before it was
[56:22] expressed is just as real when it was in
[56:25] his mind as when after it's expressed
[56:27] only now it's further uh accomplishment
[56:31] of what god had in his mind when you
[56:33] were in his mind
[56:35] that god saw himself not merely creating
[56:39] a family
[56:40] but in the beginning when when god said
[56:43] let there be
[56:44] and he created man we realize that god
[56:48] is not and i don't have time to get into
[56:50] all this teaching on genesis today but
[56:53] it's very provable in the word that god
[56:56] was not simply creating a family
[57:00] god was more perfectly more properly for
[57:02] you to understand it you understand the
[57:05] godhead better if you look at it like
[57:06] this
[57:07] god more than he was creating a family
[57:09] it's it's it's better to understand it
[57:12] god was becoming a family
[57:15] through expression see and so
[57:19] so this is exactly why
[57:21] that you see
[57:22] you know in the book of revelation you
[57:24] come from genesis you come all the way
[57:26] to the book of revelation and you see a
[57:29] bride who's standing with him in the
[57:31] book of revelation and you find that
[57:34] that she was actually an expression of
[57:37] him she's a continuation of his life
[57:40] life of his life amen and so so we
[57:43] realized then that that when in our age
[57:47] that the seventh seal was opened and it
[57:51] unveiled the mighty god it also unveiled
[57:55] the bride when it unsealed him it
[57:58] unsealed her
[58:00] and you and you've come to find out that
[58:02] you are now
[58:04] christ jesus being the beginning of a
[58:07] new creation that you are now the
[58:09] continuation of that same creation
[58:13] that's elementary to us in the
[58:15] scriptures and so i'm not i'm not just
[58:18] trying to get cabbage down on that today
[58:19] i just want to make this point clear and
[58:22] you can see that if you if you read in
[58:25] in in in the book of revelation chapter
[58:28] 11 and you know you you can even find
[58:31] where if you go into chapter 12
[58:33] you read about how that when the bride
[58:36] goes up and satan is cast down and he
[58:38] incarnates the false prophet and becomes
[58:40] the beast you realize that a declaration
[58:44] is uttered in heaven a voice cries out
[58:46] and says now now that satan has been
[58:48] ejected physically from heaven he's been
[58:51] there to accuse the brother now granted
[58:53] his accusations don't hold weight in
[58:56] heaven but he still tries to do it
[58:59] his his his accusations are dismissed
[59:02] because you're in christ and it wouldn't
[59:04] it doesn't matter that he has dna
[59:07] evidence of your transgressions and he
[59:09] has video replay in high definition it
[59:12] doesn't matter it's not admissible in
[59:15] evidence because the blood of the lord
[59:17] jesus is perpetually atoning
[59:20] it's just perpetually atoning and satan
[59:22] can't can't get it to stop for a
[59:24] nanosecond to get his charge in because
[59:27] as he tries to bring his charge the
[59:29] blood just says they're innocent they're
[59:30] innocent they're innocent now it's not
[59:33] saying that it's not just saying oh you
[59:35] never did it what it's saying is that
[59:37] you have died in christ and resurrected
[59:40] and therefore since jesus was innocent
[59:43] you are
[59:44] innocent i tell you something friends
[59:47] there's privilege to being a christian
[59:49] there's privilege to be having all the
[59:51] fullness of god in you there's privilege
[59:54] to saying amen to every word
[59:56] it entitles you to quite a bit but we
[59:59] find that when satan is literally cast
[1:00:01] out the bride goes up he can't occupy
[1:00:04] there you see that in the book of esther
[1:00:06] you know haman was all the time plotting
[1:00:08] against mordecai and the jews built
[1:00:10] gallows for him but we find that before
[1:00:13] haman
[1:00:14] died on his own gallows that esther
[1:00:17] exposed him to the king and and haman
[1:00:20] was ejected from the palace forever
[1:00:23] before he died and that's what happens
[1:00:25] to satan in the in the tribulation
[1:00:28] period he he's given a sword to conquer
[1:00:31] him to kill but we find out in the
[1:00:33] fourth seal he gets killed by that sword
[1:00:35] because what is it it's the word that
[1:00:37] he's been mishandling and
[1:00:39] misappropriating and blinding people to
[1:00:42] the truth of god's word but god in the
[1:00:44] last day would restore the truth and the
[1:00:47] bride would handle that sword and put
[1:00:49] him down
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:52] and that's what you're doing when you're
[1:00:54] when you're holding the token over your
[1:00:56] children that's what you're doing when
[1:00:57] you're believing god for healing that's
[1:00:59] what you're doing when you're saying i'm
[1:01:01] free and i'm delivered you you are
[1:01:03] literally the hand attached to the arm
[1:01:06] which is christ holding a sword and the
[1:01:09] enemy is slain by the bride
[1:01:12] amen see she's holding the sword
[1:01:15] that cuts
[1:01:17] in two two ways and it's it's the law
[1:01:20] and its grace and but you find out that
[1:01:24] in the tribulation see right now there's
[1:01:26] still mercy right now it still divides
[1:01:28] us under soul and spirit for salvation
[1:01:31] and redemption we find out that when
[1:01:34] that sword when the bride is gone
[1:01:36] and the sword is in the hand of moses
[1:01:38] and elijah then it's not then when they
[1:01:41] it had always been a sword proceeding
[1:01:43] out of the mouth but now in the
[1:01:45] judgments of the tribulation it's fire
[1:01:48] because it's only judgment it's not
[1:01:50] there to redeem gentiles anymore the
[1:01:53] gospel has gone to the jews
[1:01:55] and so it's only fire of judgment and so
[1:01:57] when the gentiles try to come against
[1:01:59] moses and elijah fire proceedeth out of
[1:02:02] their mouth no they're not
[1:02:02] fire-breathing dragons
[1:02:05] symbolic that the fact that their power
[1:02:08] over nature is going to bring judgment
[1:02:11] on the world i don't want to be here
[1:02:12] during that time
[1:02:14] right now the sword has the power to
[1:02:17] judge you say oh i don't want to be
[1:02:19] judged don't fear god's judgment it's to
[1:02:22] cut you free from the enemy and give you
[1:02:25] eternal life
[1:02:27] see
[1:02:28] so we find that the bible testifies how
[1:02:31] that when satan is cast down the bride
[1:02:33] goes up
[1:02:34] satan is cast down then it says the
[1:02:37] voice says this is now the kingdom of
[1:02:39] our god and of his christ because now
[1:02:42] the enemy has been removed from heaven
[1:02:45] and now jesus is in
[1:02:47] is the only voice now speaking and when
[1:02:50] you get to heaven you're going to want
[1:02:51] him to be the only voice speaking
[1:02:53] but when you find later that's at the
[1:02:55] beginning of the tribulation because the
[1:02:57] bride has just went home
[1:02:59] when you find at the end of the
[1:03:01] tribulation it now has evolved it's not
[1:03:04] just limited to the kingdoms of god the
[1:03:07] father and christ but now it goes
[1:03:11] forward to the kingdoms of our lord
[1:03:13] which is jesus and his christ which is
[1:03:15] his body which is his bride and i'm here
[1:03:18] to tell you your whole life is nothing
[1:03:20] but a continuation it's a continual
[1:03:24] continuing of god bringing you back to
[1:03:26] the image that he saw of you before the
[1:03:29] foundation of the world
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:33] and scriptures replete with the evidence
[1:03:35] of that the book of revelation that just
[1:03:38] just between
[1:03:39] revelation 12 and what it declares and
[1:03:41] what it declares in revelation 11
[1:03:43] because remember you don't read the book
[1:03:45] of revelation linear like linear history
[1:03:47] like a newspaper
[1:03:48] because the events of
[1:03:51] of
[1:03:52] revelation 11 15
[1:03:54] happen
[1:03:55] after
[1:03:57] revelation 12 3. say why revelation 12 3
[1:04:00] why is it later because revelation 12 3
[1:04:02] is the beginning of the tribulation
[1:04:03] revelation 11 15 is at the end of the
[1:04:05] tribulation
[1:04:06] amen see
[1:04:08] so so so so we we we see you you know
[1:04:11] you don't exactly read it like a
[1:04:13] newspaper but it's testifying that i
[1:04:17] didn't start here
[1:04:20] and i'm not finishing here
[1:04:22] it's testifying that i didn't choose him
[1:04:26] he chose me
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:30] it's testifying that it's not
[1:04:32] it's not
[1:04:33] you know me
[1:04:35] you know some credit comes to me because
[1:04:37] i had enough sense to accept christ no
[1:04:39] it's god's grace and god's mercy that
[1:04:42] called to me
[1:04:44] and there was something down inside of
[1:04:46] me like a deep calling to a deep and
[1:04:48] said that's a voice that's familiar
[1:04:51] somehow the world's voice doesn't mean
[1:04:53] anything to me anymore i hear the voice
[1:04:55] of another being and i want to go in
[1:04:57] that direction today
[1:04:59] that's what the holy ghost is given for
[1:05:02] see
[1:05:04] and so we realized then that
[1:05:07] that you have
[1:05:09] a you
[1:05:11] that existed in god
[1:05:14] and in that version in that world
[1:05:18] you were perfect
[1:05:20] you had never fallen
[1:05:22] you had never sinned
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] you with me
[1:05:26] i'm going slow so i don't lose you in
[1:05:28] the shuffle
[1:05:29] we had an existence in god
[1:05:32] in that world
[1:05:33] now that's definitely not this world
[1:05:35] see but in that world
[1:05:37] we were perfect
[1:05:39] we had never fallen
[1:05:41] but but when we look in the book of
[1:05:43] revelation and you go to various
[1:05:44] chapters especially over into chapter 14
[1:05:48] you you'll find well not just chapter 14
[1:05:51] chapter 11 chapter 14. you're going to
[1:05:54] find this particularly in chapter 11
[1:05:56] that that the bride
[1:05:58] that was taken into heaven
[1:06:01] and the 144 thousand taken into heaven
[1:06:03] in chapter 14
[1:06:05] that they are there's a there's a name
[1:06:07] that describes them they're redeemed
[1:06:10] amen amen they're under redemption
[1:06:13] so now i want you to see this picture
[1:06:15] and you're going to get my title so
[1:06:17] there was a world before
[1:06:19] where you were not redeemed you had
[1:06:22] never fallen
[1:06:23] you were perfect
[1:06:25] and when we come to the end you're going
[1:06:27] to be in a world that's future where
[1:06:29] you're redeemed
[1:06:30] well the only way how did i get from
[1:06:34] perfect to redeemed the only way is a
[1:06:38] world between those two worlds that
[1:06:40] you're in now
[1:06:41] so that you could be born in sin so that
[1:06:44] you could be conceived in iniquity so
[1:06:46] that god could redeem you out of this
[1:06:48] world out of this sin so that when you
[1:06:51] stand in that future world you you have
[1:06:53] the song of the lamb you sing the song
[1:06:56] of redemption you're redeemed the angels
[1:06:58] can't sing it but you can sing it
[1:07:02] so i'm here to tell you something
[1:07:03] friends that this world that you're
[1:07:06] living in this is exactly why brother
[1:07:09] branham would refer to this world as
[1:07:11] just a whistle stop
[1:07:14] and the problem becomes
[1:07:17] that we
[1:07:18] commit so much of our lives and so much
[1:07:22] of our energy and so much of our drive
[1:07:24] so much of our dreams set all of our
[1:07:26] goals want all of our objectives and
[1:07:29] it's all in this transient
[1:07:32] world between worlds
[1:07:35] what are you chasing
[1:07:37] you're just a transient
[1:07:40] that's all you are you're just a
[1:07:42] homeless person
[1:07:44] yeah
[1:07:46] no no disregard people who are generally
[1:07:48] on the street but you're a homeless
[1:07:49] person spiritually say i've got a home
[1:07:51] no you don't if you do
[1:07:54] if if you believe this home is your home
[1:07:55] then i feel sorry for you
[1:07:57] i'm here to tell you this world is not
[1:07:59] my home i'm just a passing through my
[1:08:02] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[1:08:04] the blue
[1:08:05] the angels beckoned me from heaven's
[1:08:08] open door and i can't feel at home
[1:08:11] in this world anymore
[1:08:17] brother branham talks about god's single
[1:08:20] goal
[1:08:22] and he's going to talk about talk about
[1:08:24] it in two ways
[1:08:26] he mentions how that the entire bible
[1:08:28] this is from christ is the mystery of
[1:08:30] god revealed
[1:08:32] the entire bible he says god has showed
[1:08:34] or revealed in every type that's in the
[1:08:37] bible he has shown and revealed christ
[1:08:40] and so he concludes therefore the entire
[1:08:42] bible is the revelation of god's mystery
[1:08:44] in christ hence his title christ is the
[1:08:47] mystery of god revealed
[1:08:49] so he says the entire bible is an
[1:08:51] expression of one goal that god had one
[1:08:53] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:08:55] entire bible
[1:08:57] so then
[1:08:58] then that
[1:08:59] portends
[1:09:00] that as he says
[1:09:03] every life that you read every story
[1:09:06] including jacob every every story you
[1:09:08] read
[1:09:09] is all just god getting to that one goal
[1:09:13] and he's going
[1:09:14] about it over time and he's putting his
[1:09:16] family out of his mind into the earth to
[1:09:18] redeem them back and bring them back to
[1:09:20] himself as redeemed that's what life is
[1:09:23] about that's what this world is about
[1:09:25] it's just when you realize that this
[1:09:27] world listen to me teenagers when you
[1:09:29] realize that this world is just a
[1:09:31] training
[1:09:33] that it's just a proving ground
[1:09:36] and then you wonder you wonder why i
[1:09:38] would say to you good grief don't chase
[1:09:40] this world
[1:09:42] let just just acquiesce to god's will
[1:09:44] for your life and say lord whatever you
[1:09:46] have for me in this life i i accept it
[1:09:48] i'm not trying to get away from your
[1:09:50] will i i don't want to go beyond your
[1:09:52] will i want to go all with your will i
[1:09:54] want everything that you have for me but
[1:09:56] i i guess what i'm trying to say lord is
[1:09:59] just take me out of the equation and
[1:10:02] that's the real desire of my heart i
[1:10:04] hope it's your heart and it's what paul
[1:10:06] said in his in that was paul's desire
[1:10:09] that god fill you with all of his
[1:10:13] knowledge
[1:10:14] that he's trying to bring you into an
[1:10:16] image he's trying to get you back to
[1:10:18] something that you used to be only now
[1:10:21] you're going to be more valuable because
[1:10:24] you've been redeemed from sin
[1:10:26] amen now that blows fuses
[1:10:30] because that's suggesting
[1:10:32] that i'm more valuable
[1:10:34] having fallen
[1:10:37] i'm more valuable to god
[1:10:39] having fallen and now redeemed than i
[1:10:41] would have been had i never fallen in
[1:10:43] the first place
[1:10:45] you say can you make that case i can
[1:10:47] because if your first cr if your first
[1:10:49] perfect creation in god was all god was
[1:10:52] achieving he had a list left you right
[1:10:54] there
[1:10:55] the very fact that he didn't leave it
[1:10:57] there and actually committed you to a
[1:10:59] wrong birth and you come the wrong way
[1:11:02] so that god knowing you before the
[1:11:03] foundation of the world could could
[1:11:05] stalk you your whole life and follow you
[1:11:08] you say i wish this hadn't happened god
[1:11:10] knew it would happen i wished i hadn't
[1:11:12] done this god knew you'd do that i
[1:11:13] wished i hadn't got to hear god knew
[1:11:15] you'd be right there i'm here to tell
[1:11:17] you he's never lost sight or control of
[1:11:19] you
[1:11:21] and today we stand redeemed and listen
[1:11:24] friend if he had control of me before
[1:11:26] that i was born again by the spirit how
[1:11:29] much more control does he have now that
[1:11:32] i am born again of the spirit of god
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:38] so he's got this one goal and
[1:11:40] and his his entire goal has been
[1:11:43] expression it's one goal one plan one
[1:11:45] goal one purpose that he wanted to
[1:11:47] achieve and that was the expression of
[1:11:50] himself
[1:11:51] in a many-membered body
[1:11:54] see
[1:11:54] this is why
[1:11:56] as you've heard me say so many times
[1:11:58] this is
[1:12:00] failure to see that
[1:12:02] is exactly why the trinitarians see him
[1:12:05] as three persons incorrectly
[1:12:07] and this is also why the one to see him
[1:12:09] as jesus only one like your finger
[1:12:11] incorrectly
[1:12:13] jesus wasn't his own daddy
[1:12:15] see
[1:12:16] and and he was a complete human so what
[1:12:19] what
[1:12:20] the trinitarians their error is
[1:12:22] their formula chops him into three
[1:12:25] separate individual persons
[1:12:27] and then they tie it all night nice and
[1:12:29] neat and say well it's all one purpose
[1:12:31] one mind and they all act in the same
[1:12:32] way it's still three persons
[1:12:35] and that's polytheism
[1:12:37] that's ancient babylonianism
[1:12:39] traceable through history see noah
[1:12:42] didn't believe that but but samara must
[1:12:44] believe that after him after shem died
[1:12:47] then the ancient babylonian custom of
[1:12:49] multiple gods come in see and you can
[1:12:51] trace that through history and but the
[1:12:53] problem with the oneness is they they
[1:12:56] only see him
[1:12:57] they don't see his body they don't see
[1:13:00] his bride and that's what the opening of
[1:13:03] the word in our day revealed it revealed
[1:13:06] that that that christ is the mystery of
[1:13:09] god revealed and the bride is the
[1:13:12] mystery of christ revealed and this is
[1:13:15] why brother branham would say with such
[1:13:18] authority she
[1:13:20] is him that you are the blood of god by
[1:13:23] the spirit you're the final voice to the
[1:13:26] final age
[1:13:27] now he's not suggesting you're literally
[1:13:30] him because you didn't save me you can't
[1:13:33] redeem me i don't pray to you i'm not
[1:13:35] even to trust in the arm of flesh yours
[1:13:37] are mine
[1:13:39] but hebrews say well then how is she him
[1:13:41] hebrews 13 8 shows us that
[1:13:44] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:13:47] and forever i'm not literally him i'm
[1:13:49] the same as him
[1:13:51] i'm a continuation of that same
[1:13:54] expression
[1:13:56] that christ was he was the perfect
[1:13:58] sacrifice the perfect lamb i couldn't
[1:14:00] save myself
[1:14:01] i couldn't get myself out of it i was i
[1:14:04] was headed uh
[1:14:05] legally to a devil's hell and no way to
[1:14:08] stop it see but one came and took my
[1:14:10] place
[1:14:11] see
[1:14:12] and that's the beauty of the cross that
[1:14:15] he not only was a worthy sacrifice to
[1:14:17] appease god's judgment but as i've said
[1:14:20] to you before he wasn't just the
[1:14:21] atonement he was our total satisfaction
[1:14:24] because he was the atoning lamb the
[1:14:26] atoning life because it was god's life
[1:14:29] but he was also lived the perceptive
[1:14:31] side of the word so that he never broke
[1:14:33] it he kept every precept upon precept
[1:14:36] and now i get credit for his life and my
[1:14:39] life and my failures are not counted
[1:14:42] against me there is now therefore no
[1:14:44] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:14:49] i am unassailable i'm unchargeable i'm
[1:14:52] unarrestable and i'm unindictable
[1:14:55] hallelujah i'm above the law where are
[1:14:57] you i'm in christ
[1:15:00] say well then you can live any way you
[1:15:02] want yes thank god i can and i do
[1:15:05] and the way that i want to live is
[1:15:07] according to this book
[1:15:09] i could have never done that on my own
[1:15:10] the human mind was enmity against god
[1:15:13] and would never
[1:15:15] never acquiesce to god's word but oh
[1:15:18] something came in my heart and it
[1:15:20] changed my whole life and my whole
[1:15:22] nature and all my goals and dreams
[1:15:25] change
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:15:30] it's astonishing
[1:15:32] the world today
[1:15:34] parents raise children and they
[1:15:37] they just start trying to it's just
[1:15:39] parental delinquency they don't really
[1:15:41] want to do the harder work
[1:15:42] and they say well i'm just let the child
[1:15:45] start making their own decisions and you
[1:15:47] get children five and six years old boys
[1:15:49] deciding they don't want to be girls oh
[1:15:51] and the parent says okay cool
[1:15:53] we'll just get you a surgery i know
[1:15:55] you're only six but you obviously know
[1:15:56] what you want to do with your life
[1:16:00] and then the whole world goes oh you're
[1:16:02] such a good parent
[1:16:04] you're not even a parent
[1:16:06] and i you know i just say
[1:16:09] what what world do you live in where's
[1:16:12] your mind
[1:16:14] what would ever make you think that a
[1:16:17] child born with a sin nature is going to
[1:16:20] automatically choose the right way
[1:16:22] when the bible says his little mind or
[1:16:24] her little mind is enmity against god
[1:16:26] from the day they're born can never
[1:16:28] agree with god
[1:16:29] why would you think just letting them go
[1:16:31] their own way because you want to be the
[1:16:33] 21st century parent
[1:16:35] and you're going to let them go their
[1:16:37] own way and you're not going to make the
[1:16:39] decisions for them because you want to
[1:16:40] be i want to be a modern parent
[1:16:43] how would you think in what world would
[1:16:45] you imagine they're ever going to go the
[1:16:47] right way
[1:16:48] it's impossible
[1:16:50] say well i can't save them you can't but
[1:16:52] what god does god only god can change
[1:16:55] their nature but what god charges moms
[1:16:58] and dads with is raise them in the way
[1:17:01] they should go
[1:17:03] raise them in that path that that leads
[1:17:06] them to so they at least have a fighting
[1:17:08] chance so that when god gets a hold of
[1:17:10] their life they're already familiar with
[1:17:12] his word
[1:17:14] see and so it's parental delinquency
[1:17:18] otherwise it's not it's not child
[1:17:20] delinquency
[1:17:22] yeah that's right
[1:17:25] and so
[1:17:27] stop preaching at me man i agree amen
[1:17:31] amen that's a good what you just said
[1:17:33] was excellent
[1:17:34] i'm not going to tell you who that is
[1:17:36] amen somebody real close to me but
[1:17:39] but
[1:17:41] but well see you're only going to get
[1:17:42] one of seven you got a 107 shot at
[1:17:44] getting who it was and i'm not going to
[1:17:45] tell you who it was
[1:17:47] but i appreciate is
[1:17:49] that he's listening and so so so we find
[1:17:52] that that god
[1:17:54] is now transitioning you from one world
[1:17:57] to the next
[1:17:58] and that's what this life is about so so
[1:18:01] you know sometimes
[1:18:03] you know we
[1:18:04] brother branham makes this statement let
[1:18:06] me let me get this this last statement
[1:18:08] here
[1:18:09] now that was in 1963 talks about the
[1:18:11] bible's an expression of one goal that
[1:18:13] god had one purpose you want to achieve
[1:18:14] in the entire bible that's his
[1:18:15] expression in a family
[1:18:17] and then
[1:18:19] several years prior to that in the queen
[1:18:20] of sheba 59 he says now it's going to
[1:18:22] take it takes more than the power of
[1:18:24] gifts it takes more than joining church
[1:18:27] it takes the birth of the holy spirit to
[1:18:30] break down our walls and to unite us
[1:18:33] together as one great christian body
[1:18:35] moving for one objective and one goal
[1:18:38] now we're going to notice in these two
[1:18:40] quotes
[1:18:41] that that that the goal of the word
[1:18:45] is the goal of the word is
[1:18:48] not
[1:18:49] and has never
[1:18:51] been the goal of the word to make you
[1:18:54] ecumenical amen
[1:18:57] you say oh yeah see brother branham he's
[1:18:59] just saying it's going to take the holy
[1:19:00] ghost and then all the churches can get
[1:19:01] along all the denominations can come in
[1:19:03] and we can all be one well that's the
[1:19:05] exact formula and model that the world
[1:19:07] council of churches uses
[1:19:10] and that in the book of revelation is
[1:19:11] the image directed to the beast
[1:19:14] with the authority of the nation of
[1:19:16] revelation 13 which is the united
[1:19:21] it's all st by the power of the beast's
[1:19:23] system
[1:19:24] and this is why
[1:19:26] you've heard me say that that the
[1:19:28] greatest existential threat to humanity
[1:19:30] is not north korea or china or russia
[1:19:33] the greatest existential threat to the
[1:19:36] to the to an extinction we're not
[1:19:38] talking about an extinction event
[1:19:40] see the the greatest threat that you
[1:19:43] that faces the world today is
[1:19:45] denominationalism yes amen
[1:19:48] you see because that's contrary to god's
[1:19:50] word god never created that that's a
[1:19:52] man-made thing
[1:19:53] and god has god's message has always
[1:19:56] been come out of that my people
[1:19:58] and be not a partaker of that because
[1:20:00] i'm going to destroy that he says that
[1:20:02] in the bible he's going to destroy it
[1:20:04] and so he says to his family get out of
[1:20:06] that when i say i'm trying to make you
[1:20:08] one i'm not trying to make you that kind
[1:20:10] of one i'm trying to make you one and
[1:20:12] the same with this
[1:20:15] see
[1:20:17] and so so we realized then that that
[1:20:20] when you look at these two quotes the
[1:20:21] goal of the word has always had more in
[1:20:24] mind than just making us ecumenical
[1:20:28] see
[1:20:29] what god what god's goal
[1:20:32] is
[1:20:33] is not limited to just human cooperation
[1:20:37] it's always been about coming into his
[1:20:40] vision
[1:20:42] of his expression
[1:20:44] in the form of being his eternal family
[1:20:48] now it's a mouthful i'm going to say it
[1:20:49] again
[1:20:50] so it's god's goal
[1:20:53] is not limited to human cooperation it's
[1:20:55] not to make us ecumenical it's always
[1:20:58] been about here's what's your life in
[1:21:00] this world between worlds
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:04] now i've explained that to you
[1:21:05] thoroughly i've proved it in the bible
[1:21:06] you can see yourself there and there but
[1:21:09] what about here
[1:21:11] see and so we realize that this world
[1:21:14] between those worlds
[1:21:15] god's goal has always been about
[1:21:18] bringing his family into his vision of
[1:21:22] of his expression in the form of being
[1:21:25] his eternal family
[1:21:29] now sometimes
[1:21:30] that you can't believe how that will
[1:21:32] help you
[1:21:33] because sometimes we wondered his
[1:21:35] dealings with our life
[1:21:37] we wonder down across years many years
[1:21:39] sometimes decades
[1:21:40] and we question
[1:21:42] why did this have to happen why couldn't
[1:21:44] my why couldn't it just if it just went
[1:21:46] like that then i wouldn't be in this
[1:21:48] position if if this could have happened
[1:21:49] and what if and what if and what if and
[1:21:51] why did and why didn't why did and whose
[1:21:53] fault is it it's got to be fault right
[1:21:57] so sometimes we wander at his dealings
[1:21:59] with our life
[1:22:01] down across our years and it can very
[1:22:03] often very often from a human
[1:22:06] perspective seem to make no sense to us
[1:22:08] and leave us wondering but he's never
[1:22:11] you just understand he's never been
[1:22:13] trying to make us better human beings
[1:22:17] that's not the goal
[1:22:19] he's he he's been honing us
[1:22:22] into his vision of us
[1:22:26] that's what's up
[1:22:28] that's what's been going on
[1:22:31] he's been he's not trying to reform us
[1:22:33] and make us better humans he's been
[1:22:36] honing us into a vision into his vision
[1:22:39] of of us and he's often times needed to
[1:22:42] move you into positions so that he can
[1:22:46] better mold you into into the image and
[1:22:50] order that he had of you before the
[1:22:53] foundation of the world because whatever
[1:22:55] you were here you're returning to here
[1:22:58] only redeemed
[1:23:00] which makes you more valuable which
[1:23:02] gives him reason and purpose of being
[1:23:05] that that
[1:23:06] that in order for god
[1:23:08] you know there's no way to attribute
[1:23:11] sovereignty to him you have to realize
[1:23:13] that
[1:23:14] it was necessary
[1:23:16] in the sovereignty of god
[1:23:18] it was necessary for god to create a man
[1:23:21] who would need salvation
[1:23:23] in order to give himself a reason and a
[1:23:25] purpose for being
[1:23:27] to commit that man into the world into
[1:23:29] this world between worlds and then save
[1:23:31] him out of it
[1:23:32] bring him through sin birth bring him
[1:23:34] through a new birth bring him and then
[1:23:36] grow him and bring him into that image
[1:23:38] so that the final image before you're
[1:23:41] taken in a rapture looks almost
[1:23:43] identical to him save your fallen body
[1:23:45] alone and even that is going to be
[1:23:48] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:23:50] an eye so that you get even a body liken
[1:23:53] unto his glorious body
[1:23:56] so it's a beautiful plan so you realize
[1:23:59] that this world we live in presently is
[1:24:02] a world between worlds
[1:24:05] so
[1:24:06] we we find then that that then then of
[1:24:09] course that
[1:24:10] you know brings us and i'm skipping a
[1:24:13] great deal of stuff because i don't want
[1:24:14] to get locked up here
[1:24:16] this is this brings us to the life of
[1:24:18] jacob
[1:24:20] see now i want to i probably should have
[1:24:23] put it on the overhead but i i just
[1:24:25] didn't want to get slowed down and so
[1:24:26] i'm just going to read it to you it's
[1:24:27] only it's not very long it's a statement
[1:24:30] from charles spurgeon
[1:24:31] um
[1:24:32] from from yesteryear
[1:24:34] i want you to listen close very
[1:24:36] inspirational was the
[1:24:38] was the inspiration behind this whole
[1:24:40] this whole sermon
[1:24:42] so he says
[1:24:44] in our christian pilgrimage
[1:24:47] it is well for the most part to be
[1:24:50] looking forward
[1:24:52] forward lies the crown
[1:24:55] and onward is the goal say why is that
[1:24:58] important because people get trapped
[1:25:00] looking behind
[1:25:01] looking over looking at spilled milk
[1:25:04] looking at what if
[1:25:06] looking at who did me wrong looking at
[1:25:08] why did this happen to me see
[1:25:10] and so it's always better to be looking
[1:25:13] forward because if you look at your past
[1:25:14] you're only going to see failures and
[1:25:16] you're never going to have the faith to
[1:25:17] believe that you can ever overcome it
[1:25:20] so you're going to want to look forward
[1:25:22] and say what am i looking forward to to
[1:25:24] the promise that you're headed to
[1:25:25] perfection and say i don't i i don't
[1:25:28] feel like i'm getting very close don't
[1:25:30] you worry the lord knows how to get you
[1:25:33] back to where he needs you to be see
[1:25:35] so he says
[1:25:37] forward lies the crown and onward is the
[1:25:40] goal
[1:25:42] whether it be for hope for joy for
[1:25:44] consolation or for the inspiring of our
[1:25:48] love
[1:25:49] the future must after all
[1:25:51] be the grand object of the eye of faith
[1:25:55] it is for me
[1:25:57] i'm going to tell you something friends
[1:25:58] i i look to my future and you hear me
[1:26:01] say all the time our future is bright
[1:26:04] that will give you more strength in
[1:26:05] times of sorrow and times of trial if
[1:26:08] you just realize i don't have to stay
[1:26:10] here forever i've got an escape i've got
[1:26:13] an exodus and once i get there i don't
[1:26:15] ever have to come back and do this again
[1:26:18] hallelujah
[1:26:20] oh i want to tell you something friends
[1:26:21] that's the time and that that god is
[1:26:24] bringing you to that state where he can
[1:26:26] translate your body into a glorified
[1:26:29] body and if and if and if and if the
[1:26:31] time comes for your body to die and the
[1:26:34] rapture hasn't come yet don't you worry
[1:26:37] because the same one that can translate
[1:26:39] the living will first raise the dead and
[1:26:41] i promise you when that happens you'll
[1:26:44] never die again
[1:26:45] hallelujah
[1:26:47] oh my
[1:26:50] and he says looking into the future
[1:26:52] look at this here's here's here here
[1:26:54] your future's bright friends let me give
[1:26:56] you some encouragement today
[1:26:58] looking into the future we can see sin
[1:27:00] cast out
[1:27:02] the body of sin and death destroyed let
[1:27:04] me say hallelujah to that the soul made
[1:27:06] perfect and fit to be a partaker of the
[1:27:09] inheritance of the saints in light
[1:27:11] looking further yet
[1:27:13] the believer's enlightened eye can see
[1:27:15] death's river past
[1:27:17] the gloomy stream forted and the hills
[1:27:20] of light attained on which standeth the
[1:27:23] celestial city
[1:27:26] he seeth himself this is you
[1:27:28] this is how you look forward he seeth
[1:27:31] himself
[1:27:32] inner within the pearly gates hailed as
[1:27:35] more than a conqueror crowned by the
[1:27:37] hand of christ embraced in the arms of
[1:27:39] jesus glorified with him and made to sit
[1:27:42] together with him on his throne even as
[1:27:46] he overcame and has set down with the
[1:27:48] father on his throne
[1:27:50] i couldn't give you a better future than
[1:27:53] that amen
[1:27:55] and you know today
[1:27:57] while you're thinking about the purpose
[1:27:59] of your life in this world
[1:28:01] just remember this world has no eternal
[1:28:05] value
[1:28:06] and so that's why i say to people all
[1:28:08] the time and we say particularly to
[1:28:10] young people but not just to young
[1:28:11] people there because i've seen some uh
[1:28:14] adults who are quite seasoned and should
[1:28:16] have been way further in their maturity
[1:28:18] still as immature as a teenager
[1:28:20] and still chasing the american dream
[1:28:23] still chasing the dream of the world
[1:28:25] still there's nothing wrong with
[1:28:26] excellence there's nothing wrong with
[1:28:28] pursuing excellence and being all you
[1:28:30] can be and there's nothing wrong with
[1:28:31] that i i'm not hindering i'm not saying
[1:28:34] that's a wrong thing at all i'm just
[1:28:36] simply here to say see it for what it is
[1:28:39] that everything that that that science
[1:28:42] education civilization that we see today
[1:28:46] in this world according to this book you
[1:28:48] don't want to believe it but according
[1:28:50] to this book is all of the devil
[1:28:53] we're going to have education we're
[1:28:55] going to have civilization we're going
[1:28:56] to have than the laws of natural science
[1:28:58] but it's going to work in a new world
[1:29:01] and it's going to be so far above and
[1:29:03] beyond what this transient world has
[1:29:05] it's not even be compared to and my my
[1:29:08] constant sermon is young people don't
[1:29:11] invest your life here invest your life
[1:29:14] there
[1:29:16] seek that which is above see
[1:29:19] and so because that's the only treasure
[1:29:21] worth
[1:29:22] chasing see jesus said not to lay up
[1:29:26] treasures for here because you're going
[1:29:27] to lose it anyway
[1:29:29] and and but lay up treasures where no
[1:29:31] rust thief moth corrosion can ever get
[1:29:34] to it
[1:29:35] spurgeon concludes his thought here i
[1:29:37] love this now
[1:29:41] he says
[1:29:42] the thought of this future
[1:29:45] may well relieve the darkness
[1:29:47] of the past
[1:29:49] and the gloom of the present the joys of
[1:29:53] heaven will surely
[1:29:55] compensate for the sorrows of earth
[1:29:58] i think about this brother now he's been
[1:30:00] enjoying it for 150 years
[1:30:03] oh my let me read that again the joys of
[1:30:06] heaven will surely compensate for the
[1:30:09] sorrows of earth hush my fears
[1:30:13] this world is but a narrow span
[1:30:16] i love that and thou shalt soon have
[1:30:19] passed it hush-hush my doubts
[1:30:22] death is but a narrow stream
[1:30:24] and thou shalt soon have forted it
[1:30:27] time
[1:30:28] how short
[1:30:29] eternity how long
[1:30:32] death how brief immortality how endless
[1:30:37] me thinks i even now eat a vesicles
[1:30:39] clusters that's the grapes they went
[1:30:41] when they the spies went
[1:30:44] me thinks even now i eat a vascular
[1:30:46] clusters and and sip of the well which
[1:30:48] is within the gate the road is so so
[1:30:51] short
[1:30:52] i shall soon be there
[1:30:56] you know
[1:30:57] we very often use
[1:31:00] the term and i'm my time starting to get
[1:31:02] away from me so i'm going to try to come
[1:31:04] come to a conclusion
[1:31:07] we very often use the term
[1:31:09] life and we use it very loosely
[1:31:12] really to describe many things you know
[1:31:15] this is my life
[1:31:16] you hear people say it's my life you
[1:31:18] know that's your life you know that's
[1:31:21] their life you know you need to live and
[1:31:23] let live
[1:31:24] but rarely does a person
[1:31:27] especially a young person grasp the true
[1:31:30] reality
[1:31:31] that it's really
[1:31:33] his life
[1:31:34] went to you
[1:31:36] for a purpose
[1:31:38] so to say oh it's my life oh that's your
[1:31:41] life oh that's their life live and let
[1:31:42] live no no that's all wrong that's what
[1:31:44] the devil wants you to see it as
[1:31:46] but really the bible informs us no the
[1:31:49] only one that can give life is god
[1:31:51] and therefore it's his life on loan to
[1:31:54] you
[1:31:55] to live out a purpose in your life that
[1:31:57] brings him glory that's the only value
[1:31:59] that this life has if you're not living
[1:32:01] for christ you're wasting your life
[1:32:04] see
[1:32:05] because it's going to end the life of
[1:32:07] christ is the only life that's eternal
[1:32:10] and so you know a lot of times this is
[1:32:11] why we we gather young people we've got
[1:32:13] a young people's weekend coming up uh
[1:32:16] very soon we've had youth camps we're
[1:32:18] gonna do more of them our desire is to
[1:32:20] impart a wisdom of years to you
[1:32:23] you know that we've learned through
[1:32:25] observation because that's really what
[1:32:27] science is it's observation it's not
[1:32:30] that they don't subscribe to theory and
[1:32:32] it's not that they you know um
[1:32:35] but but but science i mean there's
[1:32:38] theories and there's all kinds of things
[1:32:39] but and it's not that they don't
[1:32:41] subscribe to logic they do
[1:32:43] but to create scientific law
[1:32:46] the only way they create scientific law
[1:32:47] is by observation and it has to be
[1:32:49] repeatable in a controlled environment
[1:32:52] you see that's that's science all right
[1:32:55] it's at its core
[1:32:56] and so
[1:32:58] at least man's understanding of it
[1:32:59] science actually is something of god god
[1:33:01] created science not not the other way
[1:33:03] around
[1:33:04] but but we realized then that
[1:33:07] that that the whole
[1:33:08] you know our our our life absorbs of
[1:33:11] observation through many trials and
[1:33:13] through many errors you know living life
[1:33:16] and learning from it because that that's
[1:33:19] my value as a minister of the gospel
[1:33:21] speaking to young people particularly
[1:33:23] that i i hope that you will allow me to
[1:33:25] impart to you
[1:33:27] my observations
[1:33:29] that i have seen and proven and they're
[1:33:31] repeatable and i've seen them repeat in
[1:33:34] my life and other people's lives that
[1:33:36] i've counseled and many times people can
[1:33:38] sit in my office and say i'm looking at
[1:33:40] this situation and i'm considering going
[1:33:43] in this direction and i can tell them
[1:33:46] their future and i'm not a prophet
[1:33:49] amen and i don't need to be
[1:33:51] but because of my observations of the
[1:33:53] word i know that if you input this and
[1:33:55] then put that you'll output this
[1:33:58] and if you keep going in that direction
[1:34:00] here's the sure here's what's going to
[1:34:02] happen to you and it's not going to be
[1:34:03] pretty
[1:34:04] you're going to be just like brother
[1:34:06] diggs was speaking to the teenagers uh
[1:34:09] the senior youth group uh the other
[1:34:11] other night i think friday night sister
[1:34:12] debbie and i got to listen to it coming
[1:34:13] down the road never
[1:34:15] heard it put so poignantly my goodness
[1:34:17] he just pulled no punches and brother
[1:34:19] diggs has a way of just saying and you
[1:34:20] can't get offended because he's just
[1:34:22] saying it from a pure heart he's lived
[1:34:24] it he's observed it see he come off the
[1:34:26] streets he knows what he's talking about
[1:34:28] he's saying to young people don't don't
[1:34:30] chase things outside of god's will
[1:34:32] because anything outside of the line in
[1:34:34] order of god's word will fail it must
[1:34:36] fail it has to fail because that's not
[1:34:39] eternal the only things that don't fail
[1:34:41] are things that are eternal see
[1:34:43] and so so we find then that
[1:34:46] you know that it now it's true you you
[1:34:49] have to live your life and you have to
[1:34:50] make your own choices you can't get in
[1:34:52] on my choices
[1:34:53] you do have to accept the plan of god
[1:34:55] and come to know him by the power of the
[1:34:58] holy ghost yourself and and i as a
[1:35:01] pastor or or any minister or parents or
[1:35:05] mentors all we can do is try to guide
[1:35:08] you uh to to god's sure
[1:35:12] life that you can have and live that
[1:35:14] paul described in our text
[1:35:16] to be filled
[1:35:18] to to have a life of purpose that that
[1:35:21] god has purposed into you now brother
[1:35:23] branham talks many times about time
[1:35:25] blending with eternity
[1:35:27] i'm not going to take the time to read
[1:35:28] them all he goes from 63 through 64 and
[1:35:32] several different places where time you
[1:35:34] know will cease and eternity will blend
[1:35:36] right in and so i'm here to tell you
[1:35:38] know that that that the one who gave you
[1:35:40] life
[1:35:41] is the only one who can blend this life
[1:35:44] with an eternal life you're not capable
[1:35:47] of doing it only god can do it so i say
[1:35:49] to you let him
[1:35:51] don't resist that just set your sails
[1:35:54] you know
[1:35:55] we find out that that jacob when he
[1:35:58] comes
[1:35:59] few mortals few mortals
[1:36:03] were ever given such an opportunity at
[1:36:07] such a young age to view the true
[1:36:10] multiverse as jacob did
[1:36:14] multi-worlds
[1:36:15] multiverse as they call it today it's a
[1:36:17] it's a catch phrase the multiverse and
[1:36:19] they you know they i looked up some
[1:36:21] stuff and they
[1:36:22] yeah they they underst what they're
[1:36:24] missing is that it's all just dimensions
[1:36:27] see it's just dimensions that's what
[1:36:29] jacob was seeing jacob was seeing
[1:36:32] beca you say oh god is somewhere beyond
[1:36:34] alpha centauri the bible says he be not
[1:36:36] far from us from you all right see
[1:36:39] so so you realize when abraham built an
[1:36:41] altar trying to find the king of salem
[1:36:44] trying to find his city because he met
[1:36:47] the king he knew it was somewhere and he
[1:36:49] builds an altar and right where abraham
[1:36:52] built his altar the city he was looking
[1:36:54] for was just above him
[1:36:56] see and jacob now catching his eyes are
[1:36:59] open in a dream to this multi-world this
[1:37:02] multi-world reality that that there's a
[1:37:04] heaven above and there's a hell beneath
[1:37:07] there's a god who rules there and
[1:37:08] there's an enemy who rules there and the
[1:37:10] the promise of this age it was that and
[1:37:13] it's not a good one the promise to the
[1:37:15] last age is that the lid would be torn
[1:37:17] off of hell and demon powers would come
[1:37:19] to the surface
[1:37:21] and now you have satan who's the god of
[1:37:23] this evil age and it's now satan's eden
[1:37:25] and it's no place to be without the holy
[1:37:28] ghost
[1:37:29] i'm here to tell you every decision you
[1:37:31] make is going to be wrong it's going to
[1:37:32] end up a train wreck and that's why you
[1:37:34] need to have a experience with the holy
[1:37:37] ghost
[1:37:38] otherwise you're going to choose the
[1:37:40] wrong path you can't not choose it it's
[1:37:42] there's too many wrong paths and there's
[1:37:44] only one right path and that's the and
[1:37:47] the only way to see that path is god
[1:37:49] rich in mercy
[1:37:52] to show you the path
[1:37:54] and he doesn't ever have to do that at
[1:37:56] one time is all god ever has to call a
[1:37:58] man he's if god calls a man one time and
[1:38:00] the man refuses it at any level doesn't
[1:38:02] even matter what it is even something as
[1:38:04] simple as seeing god in nature
[1:38:06] might not be the seventh seal it might
[1:38:08] just be god showed you himself in nature
[1:38:10] and you decided to believe darwin and
[1:38:12] god at that point can just say okay fine
[1:38:16] you're done
[1:38:18] i'll see if the
[1:38:19] don't worry you'll get a fair trial but
[1:38:21] when you come before my throne i'm going
[1:38:22] to play this moment back to you
[1:38:25] and what that literally means is that
[1:38:26] everything from this moment in your life
[1:38:28] no matter what you do and achieve at all
[1:38:29] it's going to equal zero
[1:38:31] no matter what you accomplish
[1:38:33] put put plaques on your wall
[1:38:36] that have put more letters behind your
[1:38:38] name
[1:38:39] than are in your name
[1:38:42] and it's all going to equal 0.
[1:38:45] it's all going to equal 0.
[1:38:47] put put 12 digits
[1:38:50] in your bank account
[1:38:52] it's all going to the antichrist
[1:38:55] and it's all going to equal nothing
[1:38:57] the only thing worth anything is
[1:39:00] eternity and the only form of eternal
[1:39:02] life is god's life
[1:39:04] see amen
[1:39:06] so few mortals had ever been given such
[1:39:08] an opportunity well i gotta hurry give
[1:39:10] me 15 minutes and we'll stop
[1:39:13] few mortals were ever given such an
[1:39:14] opportunity he saw heaven above
[1:39:17] and the earth he lived on just beneath
[1:39:19] it with only a ladder between them
[1:39:21] angels ascending and descending climbing
[1:39:23] up and down this ladder and he sees
[1:39:25] christ the king the creator of all the
[1:39:27] worlds
[1:39:28] see he's aware this is the creator i'm
[1:39:31] i'm standing on the world and there's
[1:39:32] another world
[1:39:34] and there's beings from that world who
[1:39:36] don't live here and they're going up and
[1:39:38] down
[1:39:39] there's a connection between that world
[1:39:42] and this world that let jacob know that
[1:39:45] this life isn't aimless
[1:39:48] this life has a purpose that i came from
[1:39:51] a world i'm headed to a world and now
[1:39:54] i'm in this world to do what to get me
[1:39:56] back to that former world
[1:39:59] in a redeemed condition and christ now
[1:40:02] standing the god of all the world
[1:40:05] standing at the top looking down on his
[1:40:07] life
[1:40:09] and he
[1:40:10] he had that absolute reality that i hope
[1:40:13] that you can have today
[1:40:16] that he was living in a multi-world
[1:40:19] reality
[1:40:22] suddenly that was more clear to jacob
[1:40:25] than few before or after him had ever or
[1:40:28] would ever realize
[1:40:31] a world
[1:40:33] between worlds
[1:40:35] is this life
[1:40:38] it's a very as spurgeon called it
[1:40:40] a very narrow span
[1:40:43] of mortal existence
[1:40:45] between eternal realms of a previous
[1:40:48] existence
[1:40:49] and and the realities of god's mind
[1:40:52] unfolded into an expression of his life
[1:40:54] on the other side coming back redeemed
[1:40:58] and being an expression of christ for
[1:41:00] the eternal ages to come you believe
[1:41:03] that so when we
[1:41:05] when we look at this reality
[1:41:09] when you when you get it say brother
[1:41:11] jason what's the real value of your
[1:41:13] sermon today
[1:41:15] i want you to grasp
[1:41:17] what life really is
[1:41:20] i want you to get an understanding
[1:41:23] to to bring you to snap you to attention
[1:41:26] and go wow
[1:41:28] i i i'm just in a little transient world
[1:41:31] and your even your life that you're
[1:41:34] promised on this transient world not as
[1:41:36] it's it's not as if it's not bad enough
[1:41:38] that you're homeless in a transient
[1:41:41] but you're promised that it's actually
[1:41:42] very short
[1:41:44] and it's full of trouble
[1:41:49] so excuse me if i don't like living here
[1:41:53] you excuse me if i want to go there
[1:41:56] you excuse me if i preach to everybody
[1:41:58] to say you don't want to live here trust
[1:41:59] me
[1:42:00] trust me you don't want to chase this
[1:42:02] life it has no value let me tell you
[1:42:04] about a world that has value
[1:42:06] that's the purpose of my life that's
[1:42:08] what brings the fullness of joy
[1:42:11] in your life that's what gives rhyming
[1:42:13] reason to the to the questions of your
[1:42:16] past and how you were born and what
[1:42:18] happened to you as a child and what
[1:42:19] happened you at another church and what
[1:42:20] happened to you in life and who cheated
[1:42:22] you and who robbed you and how you got
[1:42:23] hurt no you're sick and all this kind
[1:42:25] i'm here to tell you it's all transient
[1:42:27] we're headed to another place
[1:42:30] it's all just training it's all grooming
[1:42:32] it's all honing and molding you
[1:42:36] for a much grander purpose
[1:42:40] you come through a fallen birth
[1:42:42] to be redeemed back to god
[1:42:48] oh so much i would like to say
[1:42:57] i'll make this final point we'll stop
[1:43:00] if i need to get to more of it i will
[1:43:02] later
[1:43:04] when when when brother branham
[1:43:08] drew your life
[1:43:11] and he
[1:43:12] drew it as a circle
[1:43:15] it had a
[1:43:16] you know it started on this day
[1:43:18] and your birthday and people say
[1:43:20] i remember
[1:43:22] brother uh stepanenko the uh the old man
[1:43:25] uh
[1:43:26] pavel's dad i can't remember his name
[1:43:28] now
[1:43:29] and we were talking one day and he was
[1:43:31] preaching to me across the table
[1:43:33] and we were talking about the spiritual
[1:43:34] birth
[1:43:35] and i said you know sometimes people
[1:43:38] have to try to tie their
[1:43:39] experience to a certain date or certain
[1:43:42] feeling or i got dizzy or got
[1:43:43] lightheaded this happened to me and i
[1:43:46] can tie it back to that date well fine
[1:43:48] grand i'll give pen a pen a ribbon on
[1:43:50] you for that but
[1:43:52] many times
[1:43:54] we don't exactly can't pin our exactly
[1:43:57] our new birth all we know is i used to
[1:43:59] be that person and now i'm not anymore
[1:44:02] i somehow i'm different
[1:44:04] somehow my whole purposes have changed
[1:44:06] say when did it happen i don't know
[1:44:07] exactly but i know it did
[1:44:09] and and brother nikolai that's what his
[1:44:11] name was and he says you know you don't
[1:44:14] remember
[1:44:15] your
[1:44:16] spiritual birth he says you don't
[1:44:18] remember your natural birth and i said
[1:44:20] no i do august 4th 1963 he goes but you
[1:44:22] don't remember it
[1:44:24] and i caught it i went you're right i
[1:44:26] don't remember nobody remembers their
[1:44:27] birthday
[1:44:29] i know you you remember what somebody
[1:44:30] told you
[1:44:32] your birthday was
[1:44:33] and you've celebrated every year the
[1:44:34] calendar comes around and you celebrate
[1:44:36] it but you don't remember your birthday
[1:44:38] say friends you don't you don't remember
[1:44:40] that you started in god
[1:44:42] but you had that's that's why you agree
[1:44:45] with the word today because this is just
[1:44:47] god in another form
[1:44:49] and the whole purpose of the gospel is
[1:44:52] to is to is to make you into this image
[1:44:55] as i as i've said to you before this is
[1:44:57] the third iteration of a bible the first
[1:44:59] iteration was in the stars the second
[1:45:01] was in the enoch's pyramid and nobody
[1:45:03] understood enoch they don't they still
[1:45:05] don't understand his pyramid there's
[1:45:07] lots of people who tried to copy it they
[1:45:08] didn't even have enough sense to not put
[1:45:10] a cap on it because it was going to
[1:45:11] represent a rejected christ only enoch
[1:45:14] had that revelation they don't
[1:45:16] understand this bible
[1:45:18] but i'm here to tell you god in the
[1:45:20] rapture is not coming to rapture a bible
[1:45:23] this is coming to behind skin
[1:45:25] he's coming to rapture the word made
[1:45:28] flesh in a living people
[1:45:31] hallelujah and that's why we have the
[1:45:33] word
[1:45:36] and he draws a circle and he comes down
[1:45:39] to a little point of it
[1:45:40] and he now the circle represents
[1:45:43] eternity
[1:45:44] say i think i just tried to express that
[1:45:47] it's talking about your birthday it's
[1:45:49] not the circle was in the circle was
[1:45:50] eternity but in the circle of eternity
[1:45:53] he draws a little loop
[1:45:55] and he comes out of this circle of
[1:45:56] eternity loops it down and brings it
[1:45:58] back up and joins into the circle again
[1:46:02] and he says
[1:46:03] his wife looked at him and said
[1:46:05] it's got a little hickey on it bill
[1:46:08] that's a that's an old southern word it
[1:46:12] it literally you know it's it's like uh
[1:46:15] it's almost like uh
[1:46:16] you know uh i didn't want to go into
[1:46:18] i've got plenty of the definitions here
[1:46:21] but but it's but we have these words
[1:46:24] that you know
[1:46:26] my i had a friend used to i say i said
[1:46:28] what in the world is that he would go oh
[1:46:30] that's a duma flitzy for a thingamabob
[1:46:34] and that's synonymous with the word
[1:46:36] hickey see and so so we find that that
[1:46:40] it represents your life it's just this
[1:46:42] little loop of time
[1:46:45] that you drop down out of the circle of
[1:46:47] eternity to do one thing to be born in
[1:46:50] sin
[1:46:51] go through your life
[1:46:53] bottom out and then god saves you and
[1:46:55] now you start going back up again
[1:46:58] and from the front you say where's the
[1:47:00] bottom of of my little of my little loop
[1:47:03] at the moment god redeemed your life and
[1:47:06] you were born again in the spirit of god
[1:47:07] and then from that day you've been going
[1:47:10] back up in to be rejoined to the circle
[1:47:12] of eternity
[1:47:14] that little thing is what this world is
[1:47:17] that's what coming to church is about
[1:47:18] that's why you believe what you believe
[1:47:21] and it was beautiful to me to behold
[1:47:25] that
[1:47:26] when this life is over
[1:47:28] that little hickey is gone
[1:47:31] and the only thing left is the unbroken
[1:47:33] circle of eternity
[1:47:35] now you say well that's neat but no it's
[1:47:37] more than just neat
[1:47:39] that means
[1:47:40] that
[1:47:42] that however i was here
[1:47:45] whatever happens here
[1:47:48] by the time i get back here
[1:47:51] nothing down here altered what i was
[1:47:53] there
[1:47:54] and it didn't matter how many failures i
[1:47:56] had and it didn't matter how weak i was
[1:47:59] and it didn't matter how many times i
[1:48:00] made the wrong decision
[1:48:02] god is bringing this vision back to this
[1:48:05] vision and it's redeemed
[1:48:07] and i'm here to tell you this life
[1:48:09] cannot stop me cannot trap me there's
[1:48:12] not enough demons in all of hell to keep
[1:48:16] me from coming back up into that circle
[1:48:19] oh friends hush my fears this life is
[1:48:23] but a narrow span hush hush oh don't
[1:48:26] worry about about what has happened to
[1:48:28] you don't worry there's a new world
[1:48:30] coming god has a great purpose for our
[1:48:34] lives
[1:48:36] and i just say lord help me to keep that
[1:48:39] perspective so that i don't chase this
[1:48:40] world and so that i don't also don't
[1:48:43] sweat this world that i'm just here to
[1:48:46] to try to come back and live out the
[1:48:48] word of god i don't always get it right
[1:48:51] i've got a body that's fallen you know
[1:48:53] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:48:54] friends you don't you don't realize what
[1:48:56] uh what an ability that you have that
[1:48:58] paul was speaking of
[1:48:59] in our text
[1:49:01] you know if you have
[1:49:03] a computer and i'm quite adept at it
[1:49:05] have been for years
[1:49:07] and and and i'm all i'm i'm heavy into
[1:49:10] security and things like that and i've
[1:49:11] never suffered a serious breach or hack
[1:49:14] and and because probably i'm overkill
[1:49:16] but
[1:49:17] some there has been times there have
[1:49:20] been times where my security software
[1:49:22] would pop up and say
[1:49:24] you know you know you click the link on
[1:49:27] an email or you you thought you were
[1:49:29] going to a a website and it turns out to
[1:49:31] be fraudulent and you know any any kind
[1:49:33] of a thing can happen
[1:49:35] and it says
[1:49:36] we have detected a trojan we have
[1:49:40] detected a virus and we cannot delete it
[1:49:44] but we have quarantined it
[1:49:47] now you can just go
[1:49:48] whoo okay oh it's on my computer no it's
[1:49:51] quarantined it can't hurt the computer
[1:49:54] it's literally locked away
[1:49:56] it's chained up it can't get out it will
[1:49:59] never get out it can't hurt you anymore
[1:50:02] and the and the only way say well how
[1:50:04] can i get rid of it there is a way you
[1:50:05] have to reformat your computer which is
[1:50:07] not an easy thing to do
[1:50:09] because it's it's quite involved and you
[1:50:11] got all your backups and your files you
[1:50:12] got it you got to try to get it all back
[1:50:14] to where you had it in the beginning all
[1:50:15] right now let me tell you what happens
[1:50:18] how devil here's how devil works
[1:50:21] you come to church like today
[1:50:24] you hear a sermon like this you're
[1:50:26] you're a teenager
[1:50:28] you're
[1:50:29] older adult you're single you're married
[1:50:31] you're i don't know you're male you're
[1:50:32] female
[1:50:34] and
[1:50:36] the word of god falls on your heart
[1:50:38] and you say lord
[1:50:40] i thank you for the sermon
[1:50:42] i am going to make some changes in my
[1:50:44] life and i'm not going to go the way of
[1:50:46] the world anymore and i'm going to
[1:50:49] believe your word and
[1:50:50] very often times you see god can save
[1:50:54] your soul which he does and your soul
[1:50:56] then is already sitting together in
[1:50:58] heavenly places with christ jesus right
[1:51:00] but your flesh is still not saved
[1:51:02] and flesh is still not redeemed your
[1:51:04] flesh and your spirit all 10 of those
[1:51:07] inlets and outlets whether it's your
[1:51:09] smell or your taste or your hearing or
[1:51:10] your sight or your touch whether it's
[1:51:12] your memory your reason your conscience
[1:51:13] your affection your imaginations all
[1:51:15] that stuff is still in a falling
[1:51:16] condition what you've done in a new
[1:51:18] birth is you've changed the inner nature
[1:51:20] of that spirit
[1:51:21] and now you've got another voice calling
[1:51:24] for holiness and righteousness but
[1:51:26] you've still got a sinful flesh so
[1:51:28] that's why you still can't feed on the
[1:51:30] things of the world that's why christian
[1:51:32] doesn't do that because
[1:51:34] when you feed on the things of the world
[1:51:36] then that that inner man that's christ
[1:51:38] he is in such a weakened state and you
[1:51:41] find yourself on all kinds of sin and
[1:51:43] mistakes say what is wrong with me i
[1:51:46] know i love the lord i know i believe
[1:51:48] his word and you're not kidding you
[1:51:49] really do you really are you've actually
[1:51:52] had an experience with god and and your
[1:51:54] love for his word is real
[1:51:56] and it's and god did it for you you say
[1:51:59] well then why do i constantly have these
[1:52:00] ups and downs because what you feed on
[1:52:03] see you're feeding you're feeding one
[1:52:05] side of your fallen nature versus a side
[1:52:08] that's redeemed and that's why
[1:52:10] we
[1:52:11] read our bibles that's why we hear
[1:52:13] sermons that's why we gather together
[1:52:15] that's why we have a prayer closet to do
[1:52:17] what strengthen the inner man that was
[1:52:19] paul's desire that the inner man be
[1:52:21] strengthened
[1:52:22] so that god can let your body realize
[1:52:25] glories and service to his majesty you
[1:52:28] follow that so a lot of times you come
[1:52:31] in here and you make a big declaration
[1:52:33] i'm going to make some changes you know
[1:52:34] what the devil does you know what the
[1:52:35] devil does who's still trapped in your
[1:52:37] flesh
[1:52:38] he just retreats into his castle
[1:52:40] he pulls up the drawbridge and he just
[1:52:42] waits you out
[1:52:45] he knows you you'll be back on netflix
[1:52:49] he knows he can get you back on snapchat
[1:52:51] again he knows he'll just wait you out
[1:52:54] he's going to sit there in his castle
[1:52:55] you'd like to get him gone but you can't
[1:52:58] not until you get reformatted
[1:53:00] amen
[1:53:02] until you get a body change
[1:53:04] you see i'm saying
[1:53:06] but what you can do
[1:53:08] is when he retreats into his castle
[1:53:11] you can quarantine that dude in there
[1:53:13] and you can take the book of revelation
[1:53:15] talks about satan was bound with a chain
[1:53:18] it wasn't a metal chain it was a chain
[1:53:21] of circumstance that he could have no
[1:53:23] one to work through i'm here to tell you
[1:53:25] something friends you're here today to
[1:53:26] say i'm going to make changes well
[1:53:28] here's one change you need to make why
[1:53:30] don't you say lord he ran into his
[1:53:32] castle he raised his drawbridge i can't
[1:53:34] get rid of him until a body changed so
[1:53:36] how about you chain that castle up and
[1:53:38] trap him in his own place and he'll
[1:53:41] never have influence on my life again
[1:53:44] from this day from this hour i'm going
[1:53:47] to live for god i'm going to let the
[1:53:49] word surge through my mind and direct my
[1:53:53] purposes
[1:53:55] and i'll tell you something friends you
[1:53:57] have the ability today to put the same
[1:53:59] chain on him that an angel puts on him
[1:54:01] in the book of revelation chain him up
[1:54:04] quarantine him away don't give him
[1:54:05] access to your life
[1:54:09] that is what the word can do for you
[1:54:12] let's stand
[1:54:15] god bless you i
[1:54:17] i got finished enough i'm not done
[1:54:19] there's more i want to say but
[1:54:32] oh my so much
[1:54:41] you were singing anthony um
[1:54:43] i think you were singing if you weren't
[1:54:45] i can hear it in my head because he
[1:54:47] lives i can face tomorrow
[1:54:50] i want to sing
[1:54:51] another bar of that
[1:54:53] thinking about this sermon
[1:54:55] i so appreciated the lyrics
[1:54:58] to the song
[1:55:00] um
[1:55:02] that uh sister amber surprised me with i
[1:55:04] just thought wow
[1:55:06] what
[1:55:07] what what words to that lyric because it
[1:55:10] it's so it was so conducive to my burden
[1:55:12] on my heart today i want you to bow your
[1:55:15] heads
[1:55:16] just before we sing that and
[1:55:19] i i hope that i've
[1:55:21] opened your understanding
[1:55:24] that that that i've been able to
[1:55:27] as paul can say
[1:55:29] that the eyes of your understanding
[1:55:33] may be enlightened
[1:55:34] to know to know to know god's purpose in
[1:55:38] your life to to realize
[1:55:41] god's attempts to bring you to something
[1:55:44] more than you've ever been or could ever
[1:55:46] be

[1:55:49] the word has spoken to you today
[1:55:52] why your heads are bowed now
[1:55:54] all over the building we're going to
[1:55:56] sing this song but i want to offer a
[1:55:57] prayer for you first now
[1:55:59] if you would like
[1:56:01] you don't have to
[1:56:03] maybe the word didn't mean a whole lot
[1:56:04] to you today but if it did and you would
[1:56:05] like for brother jason to pray for you
[1:56:08] in my prayer

[1:56:12] you right now
[1:56:13] wow that's a lot of hands

[1:56:29] and as i come to the
[1:56:31] end of this service i
[1:56:34] i don't

[1:56:40] that you wanted said but i did my best
[1:56:43] lord and the time has
[1:56:45] expired and at this point lord

[1:56:55] because lord now i i just feel a greater
[1:56:58] pull in my heart
[1:56:59] to now just turn it over to the holy
[1:57:01] spirit
[1:57:02] and let him begin to deal with hearts
