[0:45] service
[0:55] and perfect will of God.
[1:10] it this morning, but we all know why he
[1:12] can't. So, congratulations to him and
[1:16] Sister Katie.
[1:17] But I said, "Okay, I got I got something
[1:20] I was actually working on for the youth,
[1:22] our next Bible study coming up, and I
[1:25] just do that." So I started working on a
[1:26] bit last night and of course woke up
[1:28] this morning something totally different
[1:30] of course. So if this looks like sounds
[1:33] like a mess, it's a mess but he can take
[1:35] care of it. Their title is if you want
[1:38] to put a title to it is renewing the
[1:41] mind. You know we have a command that as
[1:44] the bride of Christ we need to be
[1:45] separate from the spirit of the age.
[1:48] You know our mind is a battlefield. We
[1:50] know what brother said about that and he
[1:51] said the word of God is a weapon that
[1:53] renews and transforms.
[1:55] So we know that our mind is a
[1:57] battlefield.
[1:59] In 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse three
[2:01] it says for though we walk in the flesh
[2:05] we do not war after the flesh.
[2:08] You know we have to walk around this
[2:10] body that we live in but we don't have
[2:12] to fight with fight this flesh. This
[2:14] flesh is not who we're fighting against.
[2:16] He says, "We don't wage war like the
[2:18] world does. We're not carrying around
[2:20] our AK-47s and 57s or whatever you got
[2:24] ready to fight a war. We don't send
[2:26] drones in." So he says, "But our but our
[2:28] weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[2:31] but mighty through God to the pulling
[2:34] down of our strongholds."
[2:36] So we're going to destroy all of our
[2:37] reasonings. That's what the strong
[2:39] stronghold is. Our reasonings and what
[2:41] we think things is because we're casting
[2:43] down imaginations. what you imagine
[2:46] things and every high thing that exalted
[2:48] itself against the knowledge of God and
[2:51] bringing into captivity
[2:53] every thought.
[2:55] Amen.
[2:56] Bringing into captivity every thought to
[2:59] the obedience of Christ. So, we're not
[3:02] supposed to walk after the flesh because
[3:03] it says in Romans 8:5, "For they that
[3:06] are after the flesh, they do mind the
[3:10] things of the flesh."
[3:11] Amen.
[3:12] Which we're going to do what the flesh
[3:13] says. So if we're walking after the
[3:15] flesh, our flesh is going we're going to
[3:17] do what our flesh tells us to do. But
[3:19] we're not supposed to do that. For they
[3:21] that are are of the spirit, we do the
[3:24] things of the spirit. So whatever we
[3:26] think so to be carnally minded is death.
[3:29] So for all we think about is carnal
[3:31] things all the time. It's death to us.
[3:33] But to be spiritually minded is life and
[3:36] peace. You know, you can't help what you
[3:38] think.
[3:40] You can't stop the thought from coming.
[3:42] You know, we heard that.
[3:45] It's with what you do with that thought
[3:47] that counts. You know, I heard someone
[3:49] make a comment the other day. They said,
[3:50] "It's a good thing that they don't say
[3:54] what they think."
[3:56] Sometimes it's a good thing I don't say
[3:59] what I think because it won't be good.
[4:02] You can't keep the birds from flying. I
[4:04] mean, you can't help what you think.
[4:06] They're coming. You can't stop them. But
[4:08] the birds are going to fly over. You
[4:10] know what they do with the birds, but
[4:11] they don't have to build a nest on your
[4:13] house. And I see my wife, she'll put a
[4:15] wreath on a door in the springtime.
[4:18] She'll go out there and see a nest
[4:19] starting to form. Well, we don't want a
[4:21] nest bird's nest on our front door. So,
[4:23] she'll take the nest and throw it out.
[4:25] That don't does that stop the bird? No.
[4:28] Next morning, she has to get up and go
[4:30] to grab that nest and throw it out again
[4:32] because he's already started again. And
[4:34] finally, after a little bit, he gets the
[4:35] point.
[4:37] He quits coming around. You know what
[4:39] I'm saying?
[4:40] You got to take, she just tears it down.
[4:42] So that's what we need to do with these
[4:43] thoughts that keeps coming in our minds.
[4:45] We need to cast them down.
[4:47] Brother Bram said it's on a record.
[4:49] Every thought that goes through your
[4:52] mind is on a record. And someday the
[4:55] record is going to quit playing and it's
[4:57] going to be put into an album.
[5:00] What are you thinking this morning?
[5:02] You think why? Where am I ain't church?
[5:05] Don't listen God.
[5:08] This is why we need a renewing of our
[5:09] minds. Not daily or not just once but
[5:13] daily. Every day Lord come and renew
[5:15] this mind.
[5:16] Amen.
[5:16] He says Lord I love this prayer. I found
[5:19] this bit been. He said Lord we pray that
[5:22] he'll come to the throne of our hearts
[5:25] this morning and climb up and take
[5:28] possession of every thought that we
[5:30] have.
[5:32] bringing your thoughts into captivity.
[5:36] The greatest battle ever fought is in
[5:39] the human mind. He says that's where Eve
[5:42] lost the battle. We know how Eve lost
[5:44] the battle.
[5:45] She got to listen to the lies of the
[5:47] devil. Surely,
[5:50] surely you won't die. You'll be like
[5:52] God. Your eyes will be open. Go ahead.
[5:56] She started listening to She started
[5:58] reasoning the thoughts in her mind.
[6:01] He says, he says that's where Eve lost
[6:03] the battle, but that's where Jesus won
[6:06] it.
[6:06] We know what happened when Jesus was
[6:08] baptized, went to the wilderness, be
[6:09] tempted of the devil, and the devil was
[6:11] coming to him and says, "You're hungry.
[6:13] Cat, make these stones bread." Oh, throw
[6:16] yourself off the temple. They'll catch
[6:17] you before you fall or bow down to me.
[6:21] But what did Jesus do? Get behind me,
[6:23] devil. Get behind me, Satan. That's
[6:26] where Jesus won it. And that's where
[6:29] you'll either win it or lose it. It's
[6:32] right here in your mind. So Jesus did
[6:36] what Eve could not do.
[6:38] He shows us what we can do. So the
[6:41] battle in the mind is not the flesh.
[6:44] We're not battling our brother and
[6:45] sister. We're not biting our wives or
[6:48] our husbands
[6:49] because Ephesians 6:12 says, "For we
[6:51] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[6:54] against principalities and powers and
[6:56] rulers and darkness of this world,
[6:58] against spiritual wickedness in high
[6:59] places." So your thoughts determine your
[7:02] actions.
[7:04] Your actions shape your destiny.
[7:07] Amen.
[7:08] So Satan's fighting for your mind, but
[7:10] he's not the only one. God is also
[7:13] fighting for your mind.
[7:15] And we choose who you want to yield to.
[7:17] Amen.
[7:19] The scripture we read Romans 12:2 says,
[7:21] "Be ye not conformed to this world, but
[7:24] be ye transformed." That word
[7:26] transformed, we all know what the word
[7:28] trans. This is where we'll be getting
[7:29] metamorphosis from. It means to change
[7:31] into another form. To transform to
[7:35] transfigure.
[7:37] So it's what happened to Christ on Mount
[7:39] Transfiguration. The disciples opened up
[7:41] their eyes and they he see his face did
[7:43] shine as the sun. and his raignment was
[7:44] white as light. And behold, there
[7:47] appeared unto him Moses and Elisha
[7:49] talking with them. 2 Corinthians 3 says,
[7:52] "So now the Lord is that spirit where
[7:54] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[7:56] liberty."
[7:57] Amen.
[7:58] But we all with an open face.
[8:01] Behold as in a glass the glory of the
[8:04] Lord. And we can go many places there,
[8:07] but we won't this morning. The glory of
[8:09] the Lord are changed. were changed into
[8:12] that same image from glory to glory even
[8:17] as by the spirit of the lord brother
[8:20] says transforming he say he used to work
[8:21] for a public service company where we
[8:23] had transfer transformers to transform
[8:25] so that word is it's in itself is
[8:28] something like to transform means
[8:29] something has been changed from
[8:31] something that changed from one thing to
[8:32] another
[8:34] to be transformed to be changed made
[8:36] something different
[8:38] you know like a little tadpole
[8:41] When it's born, he's there. He looks
[8:42] like a fish, acts like a fish, swimming
[8:44] around. You say, "Ah, he's going to be a
[8:46] fish." But then in a few weeks, you're
[8:49] like, "Where'd all them tadpoles go?"
[8:52] Then you start seeing little things
[8:53] start hopping around everywhere. It
[8:55] changed. It was transformed from that
[8:57] tadpole into a frog. It's like a
[8:59] butterfly. It was just like a little
[9:01] caterpillar crawling around, just keep
[9:03] eating and eating, munching and
[9:04] munching, going into a cocoon. And when
[9:06] it comes out of cocoon, it's a beautiful
[9:08] butterfly. He got transformed.
[9:10] Metamorphs. So that's what the word
[9:12] transformation means. I think that's
[9:14] what Paul might have had in mind. He
[9:16] says when he says, "Be ye transformed."
[9:18] He says, "Be not conformed to the world,
[9:20] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[9:23] your mind." Renewing of your mind. The
[9:25] things that you once thought upon to be
[9:27] precious. Lay that aside and be
[9:30] transformed to something else. What you
[9:34] was one time to what you are now. Thank
[9:38] the Lord. But be not conformed to this
[9:41] world, but be ye transformed by the
[9:44] renewing of your mind. That word renewal
[9:47] means a renewal, a renovation,
[9:50] a complete change for the better. You
[9:53] know, when you go buy a house and the
[9:56] first thing you go in a while say, I
[9:58] don't like that kitchen.
[10:01] I'm going to take it apart. So, you're
[10:03] going ripping out cabinets. You're
[10:04] ripping out countertops. You're ripping
[10:06] out walls. I got to make this room
[10:07] bigger, make the bathroom bigger. You're
[10:09] you're remodeling. You're making it new.
[10:12] You walk in says, "This don't look
[10:14] nothing like it used to when I first
[10:15] bought the place." We've had a complete
[10:17] renovation.
[10:19] It's time we go into our mind and do a
[10:22] complete remodel. We need to do a
[10:24] makeover.
[10:26] Let God take our thinking.
[10:28] Because Re says, "When God gets a hold
[10:30] of a man's thinking, he changes his
[10:33] whole being." That's what the Holy
[10:35] Spirit does. It renews the mind with the
[10:39] word of God. So, we can't renew our
[10:42] minds by
[10:44] psychology or some kind of feeling you
[10:46] base it on.
[10:49] But the word is what washes and renews.
[10:51] Because Ephesians 5:26 says, "He that
[10:54] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[10:56] washing of the water by the word."
[10:58] Brother says, "That's how the church is
[11:00] cleaned, by the washing of the water by
[11:03] the word." Not just joining some church,
[11:05] not by shaking a hand, by not putting
[11:07] your name on a book, but by the washing
[11:10] of the water of the word. So renewal
[11:13] requires a separation
[11:15] and a surrender.
[11:17] In order to achieve this, we have been
[11:19] made a new creature in Christ. So
[11:22] brother said, I just passed my birthday
[11:23] just last Monday. I was 55 years old.
[11:28] And you know, the Brandham family never
[11:30] asked me to join the family. He said, "I
[11:32] was born a brand." Did you ask to join
[11:34] your family? If I had a choice and and
[11:37] God says, "Okay, you're going to be a
[11:39] Jonce." I would say, "No,
[11:43] I don't want to be. I want to be
[11:46] something different. I like that family.
[11:48] They're rich. They got nice homes and
[11:50] cars." And
[11:53] side note, I love my family.
[11:57] I wouldn't trade them for a good one.
[12:03] I didn't have a choice. So that's the
[12:05] way we are as Christians. We really
[12:07] didn't have a choice because we were
[12:09] called God, called of God before the
[12:11] foundation of the world. We were just
[12:13] born a Christian by the power of the
[12:16] resurrection of Jesus Christ. So we are
[12:18] Christians by birth. that makes us new
[12:21] creatures because Galatians 6:15 says,
[12:23] "For in Christ Jesus, it don't matter if
[12:25] you're circumcised or not, but you're a
[12:28] new creature
[12:30] no matter what." In our old nature, we
[12:31] could never be Christians. What Brother
[12:35] says, that's the reason today we have so
[12:38] many people calling themselves Christian
[12:40] and living any kind of life.
[12:42] I remember before we moved down here, I
[12:43] was working at the hospital and those
[12:46] lot of people claimed they were
[12:48] Christians. claimed they were Christians
[12:51] and you listen to their talk, cussing,
[12:54] using the Lord's name in vain. You're
[12:56] like, you're a Christian. Then they talk
[12:58] about, I can't wait to get off work. I'm
[13:00] going to go home, get me a big glass of
[13:02] wine, and unwind. And they would say,
[13:05] what do you do when you get home from
[13:07] work? What do you What What do you What
[13:10] calms you down? I says, "Jesus and Dr.
[13:13] Pepper."
[13:15] They looked at me like, "This guy's
[13:16] weird.
[13:19] They never experienced that born again.
[13:21] That's something that changes you that
[13:24] takes the life out.
[13:26] It's like pulling the blood out of a man
[13:28] that's got a certain type of blood and
[13:30] putting another type in him. It's the
[13:32] pulling the old life out of the man and
[13:35] injecting the life of Christ in the
[13:37] believer. Then he becomes a new
[13:40] creation. So 2 Corinthians 5:17 says,
[13:43] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[13:46] is a new creature." Amen.
[13:48] Old things are passed away. All things
[13:51] become new. So you're a new creature.
[13:54] And so what happens after that says you
[13:56] are an epistle written
[13:59] in our hearts known and read of all men.
[14:02] Wow.
[14:03] Now many people won't read a Bible.
[14:07] Amen.
[14:07] A lot of people don't read the Bible. So
[14:09] when you're walking around,
[14:12] that's the only Bible they'll ever read.
[14:14] So I ask a question. What version are
[14:17] they reading?
[14:20] What kind of version do they have
[14:24] of the Bible? Is it the real version? Is
[14:26] it Christ version? Or is it yours?
[14:29] Amen.
[14:32] You're a walking letter. God has made
[14:34] you a living representation.
[14:37] You are a walking letter and you should
[14:40] be a walking Bible. Christ in you. You
[14:43] are the walking word of God. And if you
[14:46] profess to be a Christian and not that
[14:50] you talk about your influence,
[14:53] your influence will make will make you
[14:55] have to answer for many souls that
[14:58] you've turned aside away from Christ in
[15:00] that day of judgment.
[15:04] Colossians 3:12 says, "If ye then be
[15:06] risen with Christ, seek these things
[15:08] which are above.
[15:10] Set your affection on things above, not
[15:14] on the things of the earth." We have a
[15:15] lot of things, but we don't need to put
[15:17] our affection there,
[15:19] right?
[15:19] We don't need to put our affection in
[15:20] nice homes and nice cars, which is good.
[15:22] There's nothing wrong with that. But we
[15:24] need to set our affections on things
[15:25] above because Philippians,
[15:29] let this mind
[15:31] be in you, which was also in Christ
[15:35] Jesus,
[15:36] who being in the form of God, thought it
[15:38] not robbery to be equal with God.
[15:42] Wow. So if you get the mind of Christ
[15:44] Jesus, what's that make you? Equal
[15:48] with God.
[15:51] He found himself in no reputation and
[15:52] took upon him the form of a servant and
[15:54] was made in the likeness of men. And
[15:57] being found in fashion as a man, he
[15:59] humbled himself, became obedient
[16:03] even the death of the cross. So brother
[16:05] said, God wants separation. He wants you
[16:08] to come out of the world and let your
[16:11] mind stay on him. Your mind is the
[16:14] control tower of your soul.
[16:18] So what's in your heart?
[16:22] What you think what your heart is what
[16:25] you think is your you know what I'm
[16:27] saying? I can't get it out right now.
[16:29] So what's in your heart tell the control
[16:31] tower what to do. So a man thinkketh in
[16:33] his heart. So is he.
[16:35] Amen. That's right. Amen.
[16:38] That's that's powerful right there
[16:39] because Isaiah 26:3 says, "Thou will
[16:42] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
[16:44] stayed on thee
[16:47] because he trustth in thee." So
[16:50] surrender is not a one-time prayer, but
[16:52] it's a daily decision to set your mind
[16:55] on Christ. The new mind brings a new
[16:57] life
[17:00] because it's not by works of
[17:01] righteousness which we have done but
[17:03] according to his mercy he saved us by
[17:05] the washing of regeneration and the
[17:08] renewing of the Holy Ghost. Ephesians
[17:11] 4:22 says that ye put off concerning the
[17:13] formal conversation of the old man and
[17:16] be renewed in the spirit of your mind
[17:19] that ye put on the new man which after
[17:23] God is created in righteous and true
[17:25] holiness.
[17:27] He says, "Well, you say, "Well, I joined
[17:29] the church. That ain't it."
[17:31] Have you had your mind changed? Has the
[17:34] Holy Ghost renewed you by the word and
[17:37] made you a new creation?
[17:40] because I am crucified with Christ.
[17:42] Nevertheless, I live yet not I but
[17:46] Christ that lives in me. So we got to
[17:48] die daily.
[17:49] Amen.
[17:50] Keep thy heart with all diligence for
[17:52] out of it are the issues of life. So thy
[17:56] word have I hid in my heart that I might
[17:58] not sin against thee.
[18:01] So says you feed on the word that what
[18:03] makes the inner man grow when your
[18:05] thoughts are on Christ your whole life
[18:09] will show it.
[18:10] Amen.
[18:11] People could see what your thoughts are.
[18:13] The way you act, the way you talk, the
[18:16] things you see and listen to. And people
[18:18] knows what your thoughts are. They know
[18:20] where your heart is. Because Philippians
[18:22] 4:8 says, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever
[18:24] things are true,
[18:26] honest, just, pure, lovely, good report,
[18:31] think on these things."
[18:33] Amen.
[18:34] Don't think on all these negative
[18:35] things. Think on these things. Think on
[18:37] what's good.
[18:39] Everybody says, "The Holy Spirit trains
[18:41] your mind to think like Christ.
[18:44] Act like Christ. Live like Christ. That
[18:48] makes you the bride because you have the
[18:50] mind of Christ. So let this mind which
[18:52] is in Christ Jesus also be in you. So if
[18:56] you let God renew your mind, he will
[18:59] transform your life.
[19:02] It's not just get about getting saved.
[19:04] It's about being changed.
[19:06] We're already saved. We just need to be
[19:07] changed into the image of the word. This
[19:10] last quote, that's the whole purpose.
[19:13] God changing your mind from your way of
[19:16] thinking to his. Yes.
[19:19] And when you think like him,
[19:22] you'll act like him.
[19:23] Amen.
[19:24] And when you act like him, you are his
[19:26] bride. God bless you.
