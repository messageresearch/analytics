[45:47] my Christmas message and that's I'm I'm
[45:50] using the vernacular of brother brandham
[45:52] that's what he called it he called it
[45:53] his Christmas message and so I'm just
[45:56] glad we know the truth about
[45:58] Christmas amen and uh what a what a true
[46:02] Christmas is to the believer amen
[46:06] there's no midweek service on Wednesday

[46:28] service the next day on January 1 which
[46:30] would be a Wednesday but we'll be
[46:32] meeting there it's not a watch night we
[46:34] don't U exactly do that haven't done
[46:37] that in a while nothing against it at
[46:39] all but our way is to just come together
[46:42] and have a little time of dedication
[46:45] communion and foot washing amen I'm one
[46:48] who who doesn't like to see children you
[46:50] know brought home well after midnight
[46:53] and people driving home the world has
[46:55] become so crazy friends it's not not
[46:57] like it was 40 5050 years ago the
[46:59] streets are filled with drunken party
[47:02] revelers at that hour amen so uh we like
[47:05] to get the people out on New Year's Eve
[47:07] and get them back home amen that does my
[47:09] heart good praise the Lord I'm sure you
[47:11] got the prayer request brother Luther
[47:13] that brother Aaron had turned in want to
[47:15] make sure we continue to pray amen for
[47:18] that poor man in his situation any
[47:21] updates for there okay so he's had four
[47:23] surgeries already my goodness wow we'll
[47:27] we'll keep praying for him we're going
[47:28] to read just one verse and then I'm
[47:31] going let you be
[47:32] seated um in St John chapter 15 and um I
[47:37] realized that I didn't send anything to
[47:39] the booth today sorry about that team um
[47:43] but I want to take a title today from St
[47:45] John
[47:46] 15 and I want to speak on abiding in
[47:50] Christ abiding in Christ amen praise the
[47:55] Lord all right we'll read this first
[47:58] verse and let let you be seated because
[48:00] we want to look down through it I don't
[48:02] I don't think I'll get to everything
[48:04] today uh this has been a thought that's
[48:06] been very dear to my heart and the Lord
[48:09] has um really made a lot of things real
[48:12] it's incredible to me I will confess
[48:14] that St John 15 being one of my uh
[48:19] favorite uh ver uh passages in the Bible
[48:22] along with St John 17 St John 15 St John
[48:26] 17 two of my favorite passages in this
[48:29] in certainly in the
[48:30] gospels and so it's incredible to me
[48:33] that I've never done such a deep dive
[48:35] study on it as we intend to do today and
[48:38] perhaps we'll finish up uh the next time
[48:41] we're in the pull pit I definitely won't
[48:43] get to it all today I can already see
[48:44] that amen do you want what God has for
[48:47] you amen the enemy has uh struck me with
[48:51] quite a bit of anxiousness this morning
[48:53] I was asking even my wife on the way in
[48:55] to pray for me and she said 'why do you
[48:57] think it is I said 'I think it's the
[48:59] devil doesn't want this preached amen so
[49:02] uh we're just going to we're going to do
[49:05] the exact opposite of what he wants amen
[49:08] praise the Lord St John 15 verse
[49:12] one I am the True Vine and my father is
[49:18] the husbandman husbandman is a Greek
[49:21] word that means Gardener or Farmer see
[49:24] so it's the it's all right I don't want
[49:26] to start preaching amen let's bow our
[49:29] heads Master we thank you now for your
[49:33] word I thank you for this assemblage of
[49:35] people who have come to hear the word of
[49:37] God today I pray you give us hearing
[49:40] hearts Lord W with with every ability
[49:43] that I have I have humbled myself in
[49:46] your presence over these last several
[49:48] days I've studied this thought so
[49:50] intently and and Lord is just probably
[49:54] because it's so close to my own own
[49:57] feelings and so I pray that you help me
[49:59] to express it honestly Lord with full uh
[50:04] complete transparency to show the people
[50:08] Lord that we truly are all in this thing
[50:11] together and it's one for all all for
[50:14] one Lord so now I pray you be our helper
[50:16] today I Know The Enemy doesn't want
[50:19] these truths brought out and Lord he's
[50:22] uh trying to afflict me but I'm I'm
[50:25] asking for your mercy today and I'm just
[50:27] going to relax myself in the Holy Spirit
[50:30] father and commit it to you now in Jesus
[50:33] name amen God bless your friends you can
[50:35] be seated
[51:01] amen let's brother Mark let's put that
[51:05] St John 15 up because I'm going to be be
[51:08] referring to it quite a
[51:10] bit I I I want to look at this as a as
[51:13] kind of a Bible study today the Lord
[51:16] being my helper I want to bring out some
[51:17] truths that have meant quite a bit to me
[51:21] and I'm imagining that it will mean
[51:23] quite a bit to you I want to talk today
[51:26] about abiding in Christ because and I
[51:29] want I want it to be I want to make just
[51:31] some qualifying statements you realize
[51:35] of course that we can look at any
[51:37] Scripture with compound meanings and
[51:39] brother brandham taught us this we can
[51:41] see that in the Bible very clearly one
[51:43] of brother branham's favorite examples
[51:46] to use was that in the Old Testament it
[51:50] referred it it it says that out of Egypt
[51:53] I have called my son and brother Branham
[51:56] uh would show as all Old Testament
[51:58] Scholars agree with that that was
[52:01] referring to Joseph and to Israel in a
[52:05] larger sense Israel my son I've called
[52:07] him out of uh Egypt we know that Joseph
[52:11] died there and his bones were kept there
[52:14] but he said don't leave my bones here
[52:17] when you leave here take me with you and
[52:19] so so we we realize that um that that
[52:25] also it had had a compound meaning
[52:29] because Joseph the the supposed father
[52:33] of Jesus the husband to Mary was warned
[52:37] uh by an a dream uh that he should take
[52:41] his child Jesus to Egypt to flee uh the
[52:46] decree coming forth and uh Satan was
[52:49] trying to kill the Son of God right when
[52:51] he was an infant and so he Herod was
[52:54] coming to get him and so the angel of
[52:56] the Lord said take him and flee to Egypt
[52:59] and that's why we get the confusion
[53:02] sometimes and it's it's ironic we'd be
[53:04] talking about it at this season but
[53:07] that's why that sometimes there's a
[53:09] misunderstanding that the wise men who
[53:12] came from the East who brought gifts
[53:15] that they came to the infant in the
[53:16] manger they did not the Shepherds saw
[53:19] that Mary saw that but the wise men
[53:22] found a 2-year-old child he was already
[53:25] a toddler a little boy boy and so
[53:27] because Joseph had fled to Egypt and
[53:30] then out of Egypt have I called my son
[53:33] so not only did it have an Old Testament
[53:35] rendering but it had a new testament
[53:37] rendering and it had a compound meaning
[53:40] and so when we look at this thought that
[53:43] I want to bring today brother
[53:46] brandham uh in a couple of and and more
[53:48] than a few places um talks about how
[53:52] that you know people who come to Christ
[53:56] and yet sometimes don't come all the way
[53:58] into Christ right and they you know he
[54:01] talks about Billy Graham complaining how
[54:04] that he said I I hold a meeting I get
[54:07] 30,000 decisions for Christ and when I
[54:10] come back in a year I can't find 30
[54:12] Christian Believers still holding on to
[54:14] it so it went from 30,000 to 30 that's
[54:17] quite a
[54:18] depreciation and so and and Dr Graham
[54:22] blamed it on the local Ministry and on
[54:24] local Street Outreach and and the church
[54:26] is caring for people and visiting them
[54:29] now there's something to be said for
[54:30] that because that was one of the things
[54:33] that God took exception to the Pastors
[54:35] in the Old Testament he called them
[54:37] false pastors because they hadn't they
[54:39] hadn't cared about the people they
[54:40] didn't visit them they didn't talk to
[54:43] them they didn't associate with them and
[54:45] he said I'm going to tear you down I'm
[54:46] going to put a pastor over them that'll
[54:48] care about the people and meaning of
[54:51] course in the greater sense the Lord
[54:52] Jesus Christ the great
[54:54] Shepherd you you find that um in the Old
[54:58] Testament and so so we we we realize
[55:01] then that that when when we talk about a
[55:06] compound meaning you can you can look at
[55:09] St John 15 and brother brandham did take
[55:12] St John 15 and he talks about Abiding
[55:15] and and a lot of times the reason that
[55:18] people cannot abide in Christ is because
[55:21] first of all they've never fully come to
[55:23] him they have accepted him in a in a in
[55:26] in their intelligence but they've never
[55:29] come far enough to receive the the new
[55:32] birth which is the baptism of the Holy
[55:35] Ghost now the reason is very simple and
[55:37] very straightforward why that happens
[55:40] because we know in the scripture that
[55:41] the only requirement is to is to believe
[55:46] and to repent and when they asked Peter
[55:49] what shall we do they were they had
[55:50] believed his report they believed his
[55:52] indictment sermon and so they come
[55:55] forward like sometimes s people do uh
[55:57] come to the altar I've heard the sermon
[56:00] I I I want to repent I want to come to
[56:02] Christ and so what must we do you must
[56:04] repent see and so the problem be the
[56:08] Holy Ghost the new birth isn't difficult
[56:09] to get it it's promised to you your
[56:13] children them that are a far off but but
[56:16] but the prerequisite is a thorough full
[56:19] and complete
[56:20] unreserved
[56:22] surrender a complete unreserved
[56:24] repentance turning away from and going
[56:27] the other way I you know we see it so
[56:30] much in this day and time it's very
[56:32] prevalent in the day and hour that we
[56:34] live in you know I was just um watching
[56:37] a uh a reel the other day of a man
[56:40] testifying very very humble testimony
[56:43] very sincere it was moving even to me a
[56:46] very roughl looking fellow and uh very
[56:49] severe looking man but he was talking
[56:52] about how that he came to Christ and how
[56:54] that he said I was sitting in a church
[56:56] church and and he said I I I came I
[56:59] think a girlfriend or something had
[57:00] brought him and he said and I heard the
[57:02] preacher say you know that God loves you
[57:04] and he thought what me yes and God loves
[57:07] you just like you are you're kidding
[57:09] you're talking to me uh and God wants to
[57:12] bring you into himself and he'll forgive
[57:14] you of your sins and this man began to
[57:16] break down and begin to cry real tears
[57:20] and I they were genuine you could see
[57:22] that it was very sincere in it it was
[57:24] the problem that I had was that about
[57:26] every fifth word was a
[57:30] profanity and and even even ex even
[57:34] describing his
[57:36] experience and he he was saying you know
[57:38] I didn't know what the this that or the
[57:40] other and dropping all of these bombs
[57:42] and I just thought I felt compassion I
[57:45] felt sorry for the man I felt I felt
[57:47] somewhat of uh of consternation against
[57:50] the preacher who just never told him hey
[57:54] this is supposed to change your life
[57:56] amen it's not supposed to leave you like
[57:59] you are the whole beauty of the Holy
[58:01] Ghost is the lord loves you too much he
[58:03] does love you just like you are but he
[58:06] Le he loves you too much to leave you
[58:09] like you
[58:10] are
[58:13] see so you know we when we when we look
[58:16] at so brother Brandon would talk about
[58:18] people that don't come far enough but
[58:20] then there's also the aspect of and
[58:23] here's where my burden is today uh you
[58:26] know the the and I'm going to I'm going
[58:27] to run both sides for just a little bit
[58:29] in my Foundation uh so that we make a
[58:32] really good clear comparison uh but but
[58:35] I want you to know that my aim today is
[58:39] not primarily preaching to those who
[58:42] have never come far enough and they set
[58:44] as brother Brenham described they just
[58:46] set in church in VAR varying degrees of
[58:49] sanctification but they've never passed
[58:51] from Death un life and their life is up
[58:53] and down and in and out and on and off
[58:56] and that's not what a Believer wants
[58:58] that's not what I want I know that's not
[58:59] what you want you're not here to have
[59:01] that if you've got that today you've
[59:03] probably come here to lose that and
[59:05] leave it and leave here with a new life
[59:07] I certainly hope
[59:11] so but I want to focus today on those
[59:14] who truly have come to life I was so
[59:18] appreciating it never ceases to amaze me
[59:20] how the Lord leads the Sunday school
[59:22] teacher and it's so conducive to the to
[59:25] the thought I'm I was listening in the
[59:27] back to brother Matt's sermon the the
[59:29] the ones before that brother Caleb had
[59:31] my goodness it was so hand and glove and
[59:34] and that is not a new experience that
[59:35] happens so often that I that I'm not
[59:38] even surprised by it anymore I'm always
[59:40] grateful for it but I'm less and less
[59:43] surprised by it the Lord just seems to
[59:45] be doing things friends we're in a very
[59:47] treacherous hour we're in a very
[59:50] perilous time we don't exactly know we
[59:52] see a lot of things happening but I and
[59:55] I know we've heard that before and we've
[59:56] seen things before but I'm just here to
[59:59] tell you that in the in the in the triun
[1:00:02] that Trinity of of influence and
[1:00:04] anointing and power that's to strike the
[1:00:06] Earth at the end time would come
[1:00:09] together in a full triun of political
[1:00:12] power religious power and Demon power
[1:00:16] amen that's prophecy that's not
[1:00:18] something William brandom invented
[1:00:20] that's in the Bible so so we realize
[1:00:23] that we see things happening and it's
[1:00:25] it's hard to say I had a Minister asking
[1:00:27] me just yesterday do you do you think
[1:00:30] that that that that this is fulfilling
[1:00:32] this prophecy and what we see happening
[1:00:34] in Syria and it was prophesied there I
[1:00:36] think in Isaiah 17 uh how that Syria
[1:00:39] would be destroyed and how that the
[1:00:41] Gentiles who had rushed to its Aid would
[1:00:43] suddenly flee is is this speaking of
[1:00:46] Russia and Iran who have now deserted
[1:00:48] them is Syria about to be destroyed as a
[1:00:51] nation and so uh you know
[1:00:53] prognosticators and political and
[1:00:56] Talking Heads are filling the airwaves
[1:00:58] with
[1:00:59] it it's not surprising to me because I
[1:01:02] already had plenty of warning from the
[1:01:05] Lord that when I see these things I'm to
[1:01:07] lift up my head my Redemption draweth
[1:01:10] nigh and I'm here to tell you that the
[1:01:12] bride's presence in the earth the earth
[1:01:15] cannot go into a tribulation period
[1:01:18] although the vials have already
[1:01:20] partially unfolded we know that we've
[1:01:22] proven that but none of that can come to
[1:01:24] its fullness be so long as the presence
[1:01:27] of the Bride is in the Earth but I want
[1:01:30] to say to you today by way of stirring
[1:01:33] you up by way of reme of remembrance
[1:01:36] that the bride's presence in the Earth
[1:01:38] has an expiration
[1:01:42] date it has a shelf life and God's not
[1:01:44] going to leave it there longer than its
[1:01:46] expiration date the bride is going
[1:01:50] home amen and and and all of and and the
[1:01:55] and the lid being torn off of Hell under
[1:01:58] the fifth vial and fifth trumpet there
[1:01:59] at the beginning of the 20th century
[1:02:02] demon power streaming into the Earth
[1:02:04] hell has come to the surface and that's
[1:02:07] why you see the madness that you see in
[1:02:08] the streets and the insanity it's not an
[1:02:11] accident there are no accidents there
[1:02:14] are only God
[1:02:16] cidents so we find then that I want to
[1:02:19] speak today to those who have known the
[1:02:22] Lord and who do know him in the power
[1:02:25] and his power and his resurrection is
[1:02:27] that you today say I know him in the
[1:02:29] power and Resurrection I have I have
[1:02:32] experienced the Holy Spirit I am Born
[1:02:34] Again by the word of God so I'm speaking
[1:02:38] to you today in a compound way not on
[1:02:41] the side directly that those who have
[1:02:44] never come all the way but those who
[1:02:46] have but yet still find themselves under
[1:02:49] this word that you should abide in me he
[1:02:53] says here in our in our text I am the
[1:02:55] true V M and my father is the husbandman
[1:02:59] now excuse me so now
[1:03:04] Jesus is of course the True Vine I am
[1:03:08] the True Vine do you read it with me do
[1:03:11] you see that well then that proves all
[1:03:15] by itself that there is more than one
[1:03:19] Vine cuz he's the true one remember so
[1:03:24] if there's a true one there's a false
[1:03:25] one all right so I am the True Vine so
[1:03:30] you have Christ and you have Antichrist
[1:03:34] and that's not new that's been since
[1:03:36] Genesis Charles Larkin was well known
[1:03:40] for his many diagrams and drawings I
[1:03:43] have his writings and all of his
[1:03:45] works and his drawings are amazing
[1:03:48] they're quite detailed and you know he
[1:03:50] of course he didn't have it all correct
[1:03:52] but they're they're very helpful and in
[1:03:54] one of those early drawings Larkin
[1:03:57] coined the phrase Trail of the serpent
[1:04:01] and in his D it was it was in his
[1:04:03] diagram that tracked the the the
[1:04:06] seedline of Christ and the Antichrist
[1:04:09] through the scriptures as best as he
[1:04:12] could now naturally for lin uh you know
[1:04:16] um just just just as with Luther as with
[1:04:20] Wesley as with all the isua fathers and
[1:04:24] writers they lack the understanding to
[1:04:28] set it all back to its original
[1:04:30] teachings
[1:04:31] fully we know that uh none of them in
[1:04:35] fact is um none of them beginning from
[1:04:38] Luther and even coming up through the
[1:04:40] azuza Revival Lin included Arthur pink
[1:04:43] one of the most Brilliant Minds in the
[1:04:46] scripture uh wrote my favorite
[1:04:48] commentary book on the sovereignty of
[1:04:51] God a book brother brandham kept on his
[1:04:53] nightstand according to the testimony of
[1:04:55] Perry green my dad found that book loved
[1:04:57] it read it gave it to brother Perry who
[1:04:59] was his friend and brother Perry says
[1:05:01] Eddie I gave that book to offered it to
[1:05:03] brother brandham and he said he looked
[1:05:04] at it and said brother Perry I have this
[1:05:06] book it's on my nightstand I read in it
[1:05:08] nightly and so brother brandham had an
[1:05:11] exhaustive Library I have a list of all
[1:05:13] the books that he had and it's shocking
[1:05:16] and he read through all of them brother
[1:05:17] brandom though he had no formal
[1:05:19] education and certainly no theological
[1:05:22] training but he was a man very well read
[1:05:25] and had a great understanding and
[1:05:27] concept and so this is how he was able
[1:05:31] because he used the classical model
[1:05:33] which is reading and so so we realize
[1:05:37] that that they all lack the ability to
[1:05:40] bring it all in fact is none of them uh
[1:05:43] could see from Luther on none of them
[1:05:46] could see the doctrine of devils that
[1:05:49] was the
[1:05:50] Trinity it was three unclean spirits
[1:05:54] like frogs revelation 16 covers that how
[1:05:58] that and and and it's obvious now that
[1:06:00] that it was doctrinal teaching be the
[1:06:04] because that the three unclean spirits
[1:06:07] like frogs were doctrinal teaching it's
[1:06:10] obvious because it came out of the
[1:06:13] mouths of the Dragon the Beast and the
[1:06:17] false prophet so three frogs came out of
[1:06:20] three mouths preaching a three Trinity
[1:06:23] godhead and brother Bram said frogs
[1:06:26] looking back and they're always looking
[1:06:29] back to tradition so but the Bible goes
[1:06:32] on to tell us in the 14th verse there of
[1:06:35] of Revelation just keep me right there
[1:06:36] brother Mark for now but they tell us in
[1:06:39] the 14th verse of of Revelation 16 that
[1:06:43] it is these three unclean spirits like
[1:06:48] frogs that that are the doctrine of De
[1:06:51] there's the spirits of devils working
[1:06:55] miracles
[1:06:56] which go forth under the kings of the
[1:06:58] earth and of the whole world to gather
[1:07:01] them to to gather them uh to the Battle
[1:07:05] of that great day of God
[1:07:08] Almighty verse 16 goes on to show us
[1:07:11] that he gathered him to together in a
[1:07:13] place called in the Hebrew tongue
[1:07:16] Armageddon see so so we so so you know
[1:07:22] when I look at that I I think of here is
[1:07:25] is the here is the greatest existential
[1:07:28] threat to the human race that has ever
[1:07:32] existed I mean would is there anything a
[1:07:34] greater threat a greater existential
[1:07:38] Global
[1:07:46] humanwine event what would you put ahead
[1:07:49] of it see and yet this this greatest
[1:07:53] threat none of those mess MERS even with
[1:07:56] Lin coining the phrase Trail of the
[1:07:59] serpent coming all the way from Luther
[1:08:01] Wesley to the isua revivalist including
[1:08:04] Lin including pink including Spurgeon
[1:08:07] including Henry including all of them
[1:08:09] none of them understood the greatest
[1:08:12] existential threat and they believed in
[1:08:14] the
[1:08:15] Trinity and then you know you had
[1:08:17] because an Open Door got set at the end
[1:08:19] of Philadelphia after John went home um
[1:08:22] moving into the to the seventh age why
[1:08:24] brother Brandon would say the seventh
[1:08:27] Leo toan age in many respects at least
[1:08:29] the first part of it not the ending of
[1:08:31] it but the first part of it could in
[1:08:33] some respects be considered an extension
[1:08:35] of Philadelphia because that's where the
[1:08:37] open door was set which was a little bit
[1:08:39] more of a revelation and you began to
[1:08:41] get some Jesus name people but even they
[1:08:44] drove it into the left side ditch from
[1:08:46] the Trinity and the right side ditch and
[1:08:48] they just saw Jesus only this one saw
[1:08:51] three this one saw one and neither one
[1:08:53] of them saw the bride it took the
[1:08:55] opening of the seals to reveal that
[1:08:58] there was a book that a book of
[1:09:00] redemption that had names and God for
[1:09:02] 2,000 years had been filling the role of
[1:09:05] those
[1:09:08] names we are very privileged today
[1:09:11] friends right in the middle of it I I
[1:09:13] thought about this this morning as I was
[1:09:15] looking at that you know here you've got
[1:09:18] three unclean spirits like frogs they're
[1:09:20] coming out of the mouth of the Dragon
[1:09:22] they're coming out of the mouth of the
[1:09:24] Beast they're coming out of the mouth of
[1:09:25] the false prophet they're leading to the
[1:09:27] world to a Extinction event at
[1:09:30] Armageddon and right in the big middle
[1:09:32] of that in the 15th verse behold I come
[1:09:35] as a thief right in the middle of it
[1:09:38] right with it happening in real time he
[1:09:40] slips down and calls a bride out and
[1:09:42] perfects her by the word and slips her
[1:09:44] off of the
[1:09:48] earth
[1:09:50] see so so he he had made this statement
[1:09:55] you know in verse 15 and just keep me
[1:09:57] right there until I till I change your
[1:09:59] brother Mark he made the statement in
[1:10:01] that 15th verse behold I come as a thief
[1:10:05] Now Catch
[1:10:06] It blessed is he that
[1:10:09] WTH and keepeth his
[1:10:12] garments now he's talking to the bride
[1:10:16] he came as a thief in the m in the
[1:10:19] middle of all of that Ruckus he came as
[1:10:22] a thief while the world was being led
[1:10:24] arm again he slipped down like a thief
[1:10:27] and he says to the bride in that 15th
[1:10:29] verse blessed is he that WTH and keepeth
[1:10:33] his garments lest he walk naked and they
[1:10:35] see his shame that's to a Believer at
[1:10:38] least in a compound way amen we know the
[1:10:41] age was was naked but but he's now in a
[1:10:44] compound way the thief is coming because
[1:10:47] the thief is only coming to the
[1:10:49] redeemable that's why predestination
[1:10:52] that's why brother brandham talks about
[1:10:54] that that that that when we talk about
[1:10:56] Redemption that's only to the
[1:10:59] predestinated see so this thief that is
[1:11:02] coming to the predestinated he's saying
[1:11:05] to them make sure you're watching
[1:11:08] carefully make sure that you bride you
[1:11:12] Believers keeping your garments
[1:11:15] clean you wouldn't you don't we don't
[1:11:18] believe the word of God says things for
[1:11:21] no purpose it's certainly not redundant
[1:11:24] it doesn't say things for no purpose
[1:11:27] every even punctuation Jesus said not
[1:11:30] one jot or TI every word not not one
[1:11:33] word not even the punctuations of my
[1:11:35] word will pass away the Bible says that
[1:11:39] he values his word above his own
[1:11:41] name see because his name migrates his
[1:11:45] name he's he's been known by different
[1:11:47] names describing the characteristic of
[1:11:49] what he's doing at that hour see he was
[1:11:52] Elohim then he was he was he was Jehovah
[1:11:55] uh but but we also know that even within
[1:11:57] Jehovah there's compound Redemptive
[1:11:59] names he comes as Jesus and then in the
[1:12:02] new heavens and the new Earth he gets a
[1:12:03] new name so his name migrates according
[1:12:07] to his purpose but what doesn't change
[1:12:09] ever is his
[1:12:11] word it never changes he can't let it
[1:12:15] change if it if his word ever fails then
[1:12:18] he would cease to be God and have to
[1:12:20] surrender the throne to the enemy
[1:12:22] because the enemy be just as good as him
[1:12:26] all
[1:12:29] right all
[1:12:30] right so we find then that so watching
[1:12:35] and keeping our
[1:12:38] garments is vital amen
[1:12:41] Believers
[1:12:43] Believers watching Jesus told us to
[1:12:47] watch be ready in the hour you think not
[1:12:50] he comes so we're always to be watching
[1:12:54] we're always to be checking up keeping
[1:12:57] our garments spotless and
[1:13:00] clean I I can tell you that if there was
[1:13:02] ever a day that that's important it's
[1:13:04] now oh my friend you should you should
[1:13:07] be able to to see that a full
[1:13:10] understanding of the trail of the
[1:13:12] serpent was such a powerful point to be
[1:13:15] made and taught thoroughly to us it was
[1:13:18] so vital in fact uh that brother
[1:13:20] brandham himself was coming back to
[1:13:22] Jeffersonville to actually preach that
[1:13:24] sermon by that same title when he was
[1:13:27] taken from
[1:13:29] us in the restoring of the brid tree
[1:13:32] that had begun in
[1:13:34] Luther the progressiveness of
[1:13:37] Revelation uh that came to Lin was
[1:13:40] little more than a than a notation on a
[1:13:42] large model it's all it was he just had
[1:13:44] a he didn't even extrapolate it which
[1:13:47] you know if you if you look at his works
[1:13:49] and people want to try to claim you know
[1:13:52] where William Brandon got his revelation
[1:13:55] from goodness gracious if if you as I
[1:13:58] have have read larin's Works he covered
[1:14:01] the entire Book of Revelation and in a
[1:14:03] dozen or so Pages he covered it took me
[1:14:06] three years to go through the Book of
[1:14:08] Revelation working online every day
[1:14:10] teaching a class verse by verse he
[1:14:13] covered it in in a dozen or so Pages he
[1:14:15] covers the seventh seal in a page and a
[1:14:19] half so the idea that brother brandham
[1:14:22] got his his Doctrine from him is silly
[1:14:26] it is preposterously ridiculous it's
[1:14:29] just people who don't know amen they're
[1:14:31] just in ignorance and they don't know
[1:14:32] they don't want to know the truth um but
[1:14:35] they don't try to sell that to me they
[1:14:38] they they've tried that before and it
[1:14:40] doesn't work that's right so so we we
[1:14:44] realize then that that that what he
[1:14:47] because it was a progressive revelation
[1:14:50] and it it came to Luther it came to
[1:14:52] Wesley it came to Lin it came to Pink it
[1:14:54] came to to Seymour it came to uh uh Lake
[1:14:57] it came to Grant it came to those great
[1:14:59] men see and so but but in his in his
[1:15:03] great uh map of of the two Vines he just
[1:15:07] has a little small notation on this
[1:15:09] large model drawing and so brother
[1:15:11] brandham would bring out a much Fuller
[1:15:15] gravity of Satan's purpose and his plan
[1:15:19] for the end time fortunately uh even
[1:15:21] though he was called home he had already
[1:15:23] enlarged on the thought
[1:15:25] in several of his last sermons before
[1:15:28] being called home and this is why this
[1:15:31] is exactly why I believe that it was
[1:15:35] left as a main focus of the bride's
[1:15:38] Ministry to be able here at the end time
[1:15:42] because because the understanding of the
[1:15:45] trail of the serpent literally unlocks
[1:15:48] to us this great threat to civilization
[1:15:51] itself it is precisely why Satan fought
[1:15:55] so long to keep you from Christ he
[1:15:59] fought for years to keep you from Christ
[1:16:02] and now that he's lost that battle
[1:16:04] having now lost that battle he turns to
[1:16:07] keep you from
[1:16:09] abiding say what what you mean do I do I
[1:16:11] lose my new birth that's impossible he
[1:16:14] he tries to interrupt your fellowship
[1:16:17] with the holy
[1:16:19] spirit because this is the application
[1:16:21] of St John 15 to the believer abide in
[1:16:24] me me you can do nothing outside of me
[1:16:27] I'm the vine you're the
[1:16:29] branches brother brandham said the the
[1:16:31] life comes through the vine into the
[1:16:33] branches he says it's the branches that
[1:16:35] bear fruit it's the branches that are
[1:16:38] the show
[1:16:40] picture what he called it glad he didn't
[1:16:42] say picture
[1:16:45] show he said you are the show picture so
[1:16:49] the Lord took a selfie and it was
[1:16:52] you amen
[1:16:56] so so we know that it can't represent
[1:16:59] the loss of the new birth then it can
[1:17:01] only be the level of relationship that a
[1:17:05] born again believer is willing to
[1:17:10] maintain with Christ
[1:17:13] amen Here and Now friends already we are
[1:17:18] so deeply embedded into the 21st century
[1:17:20] we're already a quarter of the way
[1:17:22] through it and we see the receptiveness
[1:17:25] of Satan like never before do
[1:17:30] you what we see uh that you know
[1:17:33] appeared to brother brandham to be an
[1:17:36] impenetrable Darkness what seemed to him
[1:17:40] to be an unsurvivable
[1:17:44] Darkness but here we are that's
[1:17:47] right here we are that's right
[1:17:50] Hallelujah the very age that that Satan
[1:17:53] reaches his zenith and appearing as an
[1:17:56] angel of Light which if if you think
[1:17:58] about it that's an appearance as Christ
[1:18:00] that in many ways is very similar to the
[1:18:04] actual
[1:18:06] Christ and it's such a time of deception
[1:18:09] such a time of
[1:18:11] impossibility such a time of
[1:18:13] impenetrable darkness and unsurvivable
[1:18:15] darkness but you're
[1:18:17] surviving it's it can't be seen but you
[1:18:20] see it Hallelujah I'm still here I'm
[1:18:22] still a Believer I still see it that's
[1:18:25] right am
[1:18:29] Hallelujah so we realize then that when
[1:18:32] Satan reaches this
[1:18:34] climax according to the Lord
[1:18:38] Jesus when he prophesied of the hour
[1:18:42] that you live
[1:18:44] in there were many things that were said
[1:18:46] about the coming of this day there would
[1:18:49] be wars and rumors of wars but he said
[1:18:51] the end is not yet these things have to
[1:18:53] be the these are going to happen but
[1:18:56] there's coming a time where the days of
[1:18:59] Noah and the days of lot will be brought
[1:19:03] back to the Earth in a in a in a double
[1:19:05] barrel shotgun there will be a time that
[1:19:08] there will be many false prophets and
[1:19:11] there will be many false christs amen
[1:19:16] plural many false anointed ones there
[1:19:19] will be a time at the end yeah you're
[1:19:21] going to have wars and rumors of wars
[1:19:23] and you're going to have Nation against
[1:19:24] Nation
[1:19:25] uh but eventually it'll get to a point
[1:19:27] where it won't just be a nation against
[1:19:29] a nation it'll be a whole entire world
[1:19:31] war under the first wo under the second
[1:19:33] wo under the third wo and it and it's at
[1:19:37] all of this conglomeration of time all
[1:19:39] of these things that are happening in a
[1:19:41] lot of moving parts are going on in real
[1:19:43] time and here you are living in it and
[1:19:46] he said it would be a time that it would
[1:19:47] be so
[1:19:48] deceptive that it he's warning his
[1:19:51] family it would be so deceptive that it
[1:19:54] would deceive even my family if that
[1:19:56] were possible and he he would Jesus
[1:19:59] would say things like remember that I
[1:20:01] have told you before what I do now you
[1:20:04] don't understand but you'll know
[1:20:05] Hereafter and the Bible in the book of
[1:20:07] Acts said then they remembered his words
[1:20:10] oh I'm here to tell you something
[1:20:11] friends we have those moments where I
[1:20:13] remember what he said I remember what's
[1:20:15] in the message I remember what Jesus
[1:20:17] said I remember what Paul said I'm here
[1:20:20] this is it you're it
[1:20:25] it's an exciting time to be a believer
[1:20:28] it's a very sad time for the Earth
[1:20:30] because the gospel didn't come to save
[1:20:32] the world it came to save God's family
[1:20:35] out of the world the very same Jesus
[1:20:38] that that sent them out with the gospel
[1:20:41] told them the world is going to come to
[1:20:42] an end the same one that sent them out
[1:20:45] with the with the ministry of the holy
[1:20:47] spirit is the same one who described how
[1:20:50] it's going to come to an end so the
[1:20:52] gospel didn't wasn't never intended to
[1:20:54] say save the world from destruction it
[1:20:57] was to save God's family out of the
[1:20:59] world before its destruction
[1:21:02] am
[1:21:03] amen am I going too fast for you you
[1:21:07] with
[1:21:09] me so so we realize then that a an
[1:21:14] appearance of Christ that Jesus talks
[1:21:17] about so close would deceive the very
[1:21:19] elected a false
[1:21:23] Christ an appearance of Christ in the
[1:21:27] world at the end time
[1:21:30] uniquely without former precedent this
[1:21:32] is something coming at the end time many
[1:21:35] things I've went down the list with you
[1:21:36] many times showing you the uniqueness of
[1:21:39] the hour that we live in that it's
[1:21:40] unparalleled in history all the way back
[1:21:43] to Genesis it's unparalleled the closest
[1:21:46] you'd get is the days of Enoch but even
[1:21:48] the days of Enoch only had to deal with
[1:21:50] the day of lot I mean the day of Noah it
[1:21:54] have to deal with lot like you have to
[1:21:56] deal with Noah and
[1:22:00] lot so Jesus prophesied that there would
[1:22:04] be an appearance of an
[1:22:07] antichrist that in many ways would be
[1:22:11] very similar to the actual Christ Jesus
[1:22:15] said I am the True Vine so then there's
[1:22:20] got to be a a a false Vine see
[1:22:25] so we realized then there that there
[1:22:27] would come in the last day now it
[1:22:30] wouldn't just be it wasn't that it would
[1:22:32] only come in the last day it actually
[1:22:33] came in the early church a false word
[1:22:37] but by the end time it would reach its
[1:22:39] climax it would reach a Zenith it would
[1:22:41] reach its Pinnacle see so that it would
[1:22:44] be so close it would deceive the very
[1:22:46] elected that's a you that's a unique
[1:22:48] warning for the end time Paul talks
[1:22:51] about perilous times shall come it
[1:22:53] wasn't that they didn't have perilous
[1:22:55] times in their day but it's pointing to
[1:22:57] a time when it would be as brother
[1:22:59] Brandon would would describe
[1:23:01] impenetrable
[1:23:03] Darkness see in his interview there in
[1:23:05] South Africa just he thought no one
[1:23:07] could survive
[1:23:09] it and we can't but he
[1:23:13] can but I'm here to tell you if you're
[1:23:15] going to survive it if you're going to
[1:23:17] be a Survivor if you're going to wear a
[1:23:19] t-shirt in glory that says I survived
[1:23:21] Leo deia you're going to need to abide
[1:23:23] in him
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:28] amen so we find that it was told it
[1:23:31] would be a Christ in many ways so
[1:23:34] similar to the actual Christ a a
[1:23:36] different
[1:23:37] word similar to the real word so similar
[1:23:40] in fact that it can be as much as 90
[1:23:44] 99% identical to the pure original word
[1:23:48] and still be
[1:23:53] poisoned am I right right or wrong
[1:23:55] that's that's what happened in Eden
[1:23:59] see it creates as Paul labeled this
[1:24:04] Antichrist Paul labeled him in 2
[1:24:07] Corinthians 11:4 so you just make a note
[1:24:10] of that if you want to keep a note I'm
[1:24:12] having the team leave that up there for
[1:24:14] now but but Paul labeled this Antichrist
[1:24:18] in 2 Corinthians 11:4 Paul called it
[1:24:22] another Jesus amen similar to the real
[1:24:27] Jesus but who is not the beginning of
[1:24:30] the creation of God rather he is a
[1:24:34] perversion of that original creation and
[1:24:37] that is precisely why a faith hear me
[1:24:42] that is precisely why a faith uh that is
[1:24:46] not you know that that is not based on
[1:24:49] the pure word cannot produce the token
[1:24:54] on display in your lives amen that now
[1:24:58] we're not saying the middle the middle
[1:25:00] of the ages brother bam said don't say
[1:25:02] Luther didn't have the Holy Ghost don't
[1:25:03] say he wasn't saved he did and he was
[1:25:06] but the but the token the full token on
[1:25:09] display cannot come to the end time
[1:25:12] because the full token on display is the
[1:25:14] whole word revealed believed accepted
[1:25:17] eaten you've eaten the book you've
[1:25:19] become the book you're prophesying what
[1:25:23] you've eaten what's and you comes out of
[1:25:25] you
[1:25:26] see so so there there's no way then that
[1:25:30] that you could have uh uh a faith um
[1:25:36] that is not based on the pure word
[1:25:38] there's no way for it to produce the
[1:25:40] token because the to and listen the
[1:25:43] token on display is necessary for the
[1:25:53] rapture so Paul called it there in 2
[1:25:55] Corinthians 11 for if he that cometh
[1:25:59] preacheth another Jesus whom we have not
[1:26:02] preached or if you receive another
[1:26:05] Spirit which you have not received or
[1:26:08] another gospel which you have not
[1:26:10] accepted all right so one of what that's
[1:26:13] just one of several labels for the
[1:26:15] Antichrist he there are other labels
[1:26:17] that him and other disciples used the
[1:26:19] man of sin the deceiver the false
[1:26:22] prophet and here in second Corinth an
[1:26:25] another Jesus one to be worshiped like
[1:26:28] God because this this was Satan's
[1:26:31] ambition having at one time Stood Beside
[1:26:34] Christ in the
[1:26:37] eternities and so he wanted to be like
[1:26:40] God his ambition was to be like God that
[1:26:44] is to say another Jesus now realizing
[1:26:47] that he could not create God had not
[1:26:50] given him that power he had no chance to
[1:26:53] accomplish his goal except he started he
[1:26:57] he went to God's family he went to Eve
[1:26:59] and started giving her a false word a
[1:27:03] poisonous word that was 99%
[1:27:07] true and he says his lie was you'll be
[1:27:10] like God see so he's you understand that
[1:27:15] he's trying to ascend or he's trying to
[1:27:17] have rulership in Christ by having a a
[1:27:21] kingdom of his children around him his
[1:27:26] impersonation of the word uh produces
[1:27:30] Christians
[1:27:31] soall or labeled as such but they bear
[1:27:37] uh because and the reason that they
[1:27:39] would be called Christians is because
[1:27:42] they they definitely uh bear
[1:27:46] similarities in greater and lesser
[1:27:49] degrees to a true Christian believer
[1:27:56] sometimes in ways that are nearly equal
[1:27:58] to or goodness gracious in some cases
[1:28:00] even appear to exceed uh a a True
[1:28:04] Believer sometimes living more holy than
[1:28:06] the word even calls
[1:28:09] for so Jesus says I am the True Vine
[1:28:15] okay I'm GNA have to finish reading my
[1:28:17] opening text here I'm never going to get
[1:28:19] to my main thought amen don't get scared
[1:28:22] I'm getting ready to close
[1:28:27] I am the True
[1:28:29] Vine and my
[1:28:32] father is the
[1:28:34] husbandman so so then all right now what
[1:28:38] you've just proven to yourself when you
[1:28:40] read that with me is you've proven that
[1:28:43] it's going to take more than God in the
[1:28:46] Sun at Calvary to fully redeem
[1:28:51] you I am the vine my father is the
[1:28:54] husbandman so it's going to take more
[1:28:57] than just God in the son at Calvary to
[1:28:59] fully redeem you your journey didn't end
[1:29:03] at Calvary it
[1:29:06] began at
[1:29:08] Calvary it's also taking the working of
[1:29:11] the husbandman which is God in the form
[1:29:14] of the Holy Ghost to finish the job and
[1:29:17] return you back to Perfection to get you
[1:29:21] home to get me home that's what we want
[1:29:24] amen
[1:29:26] hallelujah all right every Branch verse
[1:29:29] two brother Mark every branch in me that
[1:29:31] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[1:29:34] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:29:35] purgeth it that it may bring bring forth
[1:29:38] more fruit I'm not going to do a
[1:29:39] breakdown of these verses and bear in
[1:29:41] mind that there's compound meanings you
[1:29:43] know because we know that a Believer
[1:29:45] can't be lost he's passed from Death To
[1:29:47] Life St John 5:24 assures us of that so
[1:29:50] so so so don't get all confused and
[1:29:53] thinking in the wrong the wrong side of
[1:29:56] of a compound meaning so he says here
[1:29:59] three now ye are clean through the word
[1:30:02] which I have spoken unto
[1:30:05] you verse four abide in me to
[1:30:11] Believers to
[1:30:13] Believers ye are
[1:30:15] clean through the word which I have
[1:30:18] spoken to you now abide in me and and I
[1:30:25] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:30:28] of itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:30:32] more can ye except ye abide in me so
[1:30:36] it's not a Prohibition to bearing fruits
[1:30:38] the false Church Bears fruits but not
[1:30:40] fruits unto salvation and Redemption
[1:30:43] they're not true they're they're they're
[1:30:45] not authentic they're
[1:30:47] hybrid you understand they're hybrid now
[1:30:51] the best evidence you have of that
[1:30:54] is that at the Judgment bar in Matthew
[1:30:59] 25 those people attempt to stand on
[1:31:03] their
[1:31:04] Works look at what we've done they're
[1:31:07] they're standing on their fruits look
[1:31:09] have we not done this and that and this
[1:31:11] and that and I've said to you many times
[1:31:13] it doesn't surprise me that they would
[1:31:15] try to do that they spent their whole
[1:31:17] Christian Life doing that trying to
[1:31:19] prove to the world that they were a
[1:31:21] Christian because they built hospitals
[1:31:22] orphanages and had s Light TV and
[1:31:24] preached on radio around the world and
[1:31:26] sent Bibles everywhere well and fine and
[1:31:28] good nothing to say against those things
[1:31:31] and that that's what brother Brandon
[1:31:33] would constantly emphasize said I'm not
[1:31:35] against those things not against program
[1:31:37] not against all that he says I'm just
[1:31:39] saying that it you've got to come back
[1:31:41] to the original word and let the word
[1:31:44] bring fruits in your life let the that's
[1:31:47] what Jesus said by the word I have given
[1:31:50] you see
[1:31:54] verse five he says it again as if it's
[1:31:56] not already important I am the
[1:32:00] vine yes Lord we know you've already
[1:32:02] told us that but I want you to catch it
[1:32:06] I know you're born again of my spirit I
[1:32:08] know you have a gene of God I know you
[1:32:10] love me I know you believe my word but I
[1:32:13] need to tell you twice abide in me I am
[1:32:16] the
[1:32:17] vine and brother brandham talks about
[1:32:20] how that the vine life is what flows
[1:32:22] into the branches
[1:32:24] amen I am the vine verse 5 ye are the
[1:32:27] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:32:29] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:32:31] for without me you can do
[1:32:34] nothing
[1:32:35] so if you're not bringing forth much
[1:32:39] then you might as well not be bringing
[1:32:40] forth
[1:32:42] anything he doesn't give a middle one
[1:32:44] there's not a a a curtain be it's you
[1:32:48] bring you let you let me Purge you so
[1:32:51] you bring forth more fruit much fruit
[1:32:53] remember that was the problem with the
[1:32:55] seed that fell by the wayside the fouls
[1:32:59] of the air picked it up some of it f
[1:33:00] that's demon Spirit you come into church
[1:33:02] you hear the gospel it means nothing to
[1:33:03] you it blesses the people all around you
[1:33:06] to you it's nothing okay thank you it's
[1:33:07] nice to be here today I appreciate all
[1:33:08] that singing you leave and it means
[1:33:10] nothing and the Very word you heard the
[1:33:11] demons come and take it right out of
[1:33:13] your mind and you go on your life as if
[1:33:15] nothing as if you'd never been
[1:33:16] here Jesus talked about that that's not
[1:33:20] the person I want to be I I I don't want
[1:33:22] to be that guy amen neither do I want to
[1:33:24] be the one where seed fell by the
[1:33:26] wayside you get allused and excited and
[1:33:28] and you're so glad that he can forgive
[1:33:30] your sins and you feel pretty dirty
[1:33:32] rotten and you you're glad that somebody
[1:33:34] could forgive your sins and God loves me
[1:33:35] just the way I am and I don't really
[1:33:37] have to
[1:33:38] change what a
[1:33:42] deal I I get to go to heaven I don't
[1:33:44] have to actually live like Christ
[1:33:46] because he did it all at calary and I
[1:33:48] got nothing to do that's nonsense that's
[1:33:50] not the gospel that's a go that's a
[1:33:52] that's another Jesus that's another word
[1:33:55] that's similar to the word
[1:33:59] see so so he's he goes on verse six if a
[1:34:05] man abide not in me is cast forth as a
[1:34:07] branch and his withered don't forget
[1:34:08] we've got compound meanings I'm not here
[1:34:10] to break it all down some of this
[1:34:12] applies to people who have never come to
[1:34:14] to a new birth and is withered and Men
[1:34:16] gather them and cast them into the fire
[1:34:18] and they are burned and so you know
[1:34:22] could I make this comment because it's
[1:34:23] not in my notes but it comes to my mind
[1:34:26] that even when Paul is talking
[1:34:29] about members of God's actual family
[1:34:32] preachers in
[1:34:34] particular and not just preachers but
[1:34:36] anybody because you're all you're all
[1:34:38] ministers see you just may not do it
[1:34:40] behind a pull pit but you're called to
[1:34:42] be to let your light shine Jesus said to
[1:34:45] the whole church go into all the world
[1:34:47] and demonstrate the gospel and Paul
[1:34:50] talks about people who build on wood hay
[1:34:52] and stubble instead of building on gold
[1:34:55] and precious stones gold and silver and
[1:34:58] precious stones gold and silver and
[1:34:59] precious stones instead they build on
[1:35:02] mental uh thoughts and ideas and visions
[1:35:05] of their own they never let the Holy
[1:35:07] Spirit really get them over their eye
[1:35:10] disease it's all about them and it's all
[1:35:12] about building a kingdom it's all about
[1:35:14] controlling people and you know there's
[1:35:16] there's even times when God's family
[1:35:19] members can refuse to let the Holy
[1:35:22] Spirit deliver them from complex
[1:35:24] refuse to let the Holy Spirit deliver
[1:35:26] them from hurts and wounds and they
[1:35:28] don't forgive and they run and I'm
[1:35:30] talking about God's family and and
[1:35:33] preachers can get like that and they
[1:35:34] never actually get past any of that
[1:35:36] stuff and I'm here to tell you here's
[1:35:38] the thing they suffer all their work and
[1:35:40] all of their effort is consumed by the
[1:35:42] Judgment fires of the earth it would
[1:35:45] discourage me if I didn't see the Holy
[1:35:48] Spirit living inside you it would
[1:35:50] discourage me if I didn't see you coming
[1:35:52] from Death to life and to see you rising
[1:35:54] up in faith then I know that my Ministry
[1:35:57] is being
[1:35:58] effective to have it all come down and
[1:36:01] and the age becomes so wicked that all
[1:36:03] of y'all
[1:36:07] backslide and my Ministry and everything
[1:36:09] that I built just goes up in
[1:36:12] Flames see cuz I build on wood hay and
[1:36:16] stubble verse
[1:36:18] seven if you abide in me and my words
[1:36:20] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[1:36:23] this is where you operate third
[1:36:26] pole see so as I've said to you before
[1:36:31] when I'm teaching on the third poll the
[1:36:33] third poll we found we found that
[1:36:35] perfect Faith didn't we friends we
[1:36:38] studied it intricately we took many many
[1:36:41] many many sessions on that many many
[1:36:43] sermons and we prove to you
[1:36:46] unequivocally that the that perfect
[1:36:48] Faith to operate the third pole is not
[1:36:50] something you go get it's something you
[1:36:54] prepare yourself to
[1:36:56] receive it's it's coming it's here Among
[1:36:58] Us already because God said it would be
[1:37:01] here it's operating because he said this
[1:37:04] is what it'll do and it's doing it I'm
[1:37:06] not waiting on another messenger another
[1:37:09] age or another this or another Super
[1:37:11] this or super that we already have the
[1:37:13] revealed word we have the Holy Spirit
[1:37:15] moving Among Us the power of God and the
[1:37:18] power of the
[1:37:22] Resurrection it all comes down to are
[1:37:24] you willing to
[1:37:27] abide see if you abide in me and my
[1:37:32] words abide in you you shall ask what
[1:37:34] you will and it shall be done to you do
[1:37:37] you think if verse seven wasn't true
[1:37:39] about William brandham he could have
[1:37:41] created squirrels
[1:37:44] twice do you think if verse seven didn't
[1:37:47] apply to William brandham he could have
[1:37:48] spoke a storm out of
[1:37:52] existence do you think he could have
[1:37:54] gave a dead fish back his life do you
[1:37:55] think he could have disappeared a tumor
[1:37:58] from his wife just by speaking
[1:38:00] it do you think he could have given
[1:38:02] hadie right the salvation of her
[1:38:04] children if verse seven hadn't been true
[1:38:06] in his life I'll tell you it wouldn't
[1:38:09] have it couldn't have see would he have
[1:38:12] been a believer of course Born Again
[1:38:14] sure Prophet absolutely but verse S has
[1:38:17] to be in play
[1:38:20] friends verse eight explains it herein
[1:38:24] is my father
[1:38:26] glorified if you're willing to obey
[1:38:28] verse seven then verse eight can be true
[1:38:31] herein is my father
[1:38:33] glorified that you bear much fruit so
[1:38:36] shall you be my disciples look at the
[1:38:39] qualifications to being a disciple

[1:39:25] going to get to it today I'll have it
[1:39:26] for the second part brother brandham
[1:39:29] just makes it so clear he said you've
[1:39:31] just watched too much TV and too much
[1:39:33] Hollywood and too much of this has
[1:39:34] affected your life he's talking to
[1:39:38] believers who have no power of God in
[1:39:40] their
[1:39:42] life but they're actually our
[1:39:46] Believers verse 9 verse 8 here in as my
[1:39:49] father glorify that you bear much fruit
[1:39:50] and so shall you be my disciples verse 9

[1:39:54] how it works so have I loved you
[1:39:56] continue ye in my
[1:40:00] love how did Jesus demonstrate his love
[1:40:02] to the father he did always that which
[1:40:04] pleased him verse 10 if you keep my
[1:40:07] Commandments you shall abide in my love
[1:40:09] even as I have kept my father's
[1:40:10] Commandments and abide in his love these
[1:40:13] things have I spoken unto you hear the

[1:40:26] that your joy might be
[1:40:29] full so maybe you've got joy that's not
[1:40:33] full but the promise is he wants you to
[1:40:37] Bear much fruit and be his disciple and
[1:40:39] bring glory to God and your joy I here
[1:40:42] to tell you friends there's no joy in
[1:40:44] the world like knowing that you're
[1:40:45] pleasing to the Lord there's no anguish
[1:40:49] for a Believer so strong as to know when
[1:40:51] you when you know your prayer life isn't
[1:40:53] where it ought to be and your church
[1:40:55] attendance isn't where it ought to be
[1:40:56] and your love for the people and your
[1:40:58] love for the word and your prayer life
[1:40:59] and your Bible reading and your tape
[1:41:00] listening when you know those things are
[1:41:02] lacking you don't have full Joy there's
[1:41:06] no way you
[1:41:08] do if you think you do it's because
[1:41:11] you've never tasted the full Joy because
[1:41:13] you don't know what you don't
[1:41:17] have
[1:41:20] abide in me
[1:41:23] you can take it down brother
[1:41:27] Mark see here's the goal here's the goal
[1:41:30] I'm going to give you the goal of
[1:41:32] God brother Brandon talks about how that
[1:41:35] all through the
[1:41:37] Bible God only ever had one
[1:41:40] goal and he expresses it in multiple
[1:41:43] ways but everything was aiming to one
[1:41:45] purpose and that was to express himself
[1:41:48] see it's all about expression everything
[1:41:51] he did was about expr expression Abel
[1:41:54] caught a revelation of a lamb because
[1:41:56] that expressed the blood sacrifice and
[1:41:59] how that Redemption laid in the blood
[1:42:01] Amen on and on and on we could go
[1:42:03] through the life of Abraham Enoch built
[1:42:05] that pyramid for the same reason it was
[1:42:07] a revelation of God so that something we
[1:42:11] would have a marker to go wow we're we
[1:42:14] can actually make it into a Rapture how
[1:42:16] do you know cuz somebody already did and
[1:42:19] even have the Holy Ghost like I've got
[1:42:21] if he did it what can we do
[1:42:25] so brother brandham breaks it into three
[1:42:28] phases first to express himself
[1:42:31] completely God in
[1:42:34] Christ what all the prophets priests and
[1:42:36] kings were about it's what all the
[1:42:38] sacrifices were about to express himself
[1:42:41] completely in Christ and when Christ
[1:42:44] hung on the cross and said it is
[1:42:46] finished all the way till his last
[1:42:48] breath and when that not until then when
[1:42:51] that last breath and he gave up the
[1:42:53] ghost the expression of God was made
[1:42:57] complete see second to have his pinenes
[1:43:02] this is during the church ages from
[1:43:05] Ephesus through Leota to have the
[1:43:08] pinenes by this in his church which is
[1:43:11] his body the bride till he could have
[1:43:13] the preeminence to express himself
[1:43:15] through them that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:43:19] is given for see and third here here it
[1:43:23] is to restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:43:27] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:43:30] Adam back to where he walked in the cool
[1:43:32] of the evening with his people talked
[1:43:34] with them fellowshipped with them could
[1:43:37] I say abided with them and they with
[1:43:41] himen this is what he's coming back to
[1:43:44] friends and when the last believer has
[1:43:46] belied the last word and overcome the
[1:43:48] last victory and the bride is lifted
[1:43:51] from the earth then then the then phase
[1:43:54] number two is
[1:43:56] complete and the phase number three is
[1:43:59] underway we're restored back we come
[1:44:01] back to the Earth in a millennium we
[1:44:03] have a marriage supper three and a half
[1:44:05] years while the world there's a reward
[1:44:07] ceremony there's all kinds of things
[1:44:08] that are going to go on there and then
[1:44:10] we're coming back here to set up a
[1:44:12] millennial reign with the with the king
[1:44:14] for a thousand
[1:44:20] years all right now I want to I want to
[1:44:23] come
[1:44:24] down
[1:44:27] to H I won't even get that far let me
[1:44:30] just come down
[1:44:33] to this
[1:44:39] point you
[1:44:43] good
[1:44:45] many have taken the brave step to accept
[1:44:50] Christ to believe his word for this hour
[1:44:54] and stand
[1:44:56] today with a a hand of witness I am a
[1:45:01] believer I have received him the word
[1:45:05] whom God hath
[1:45:07] sent remember it was not a prophet that
[1:45:09] gave you the the the the open book it
[1:45:14] was Christ he only used a prophet
[1:45:17] because that's how he rolls that's how
[1:45:18] he works that's how he does it that's
[1:45:21] what's up that's how God does it he uses
[1:45:23] prophets to do that you should thank God
[1:45:25] that he
[1:45:28] does never used intellectual men they
[1:45:30] always mess it up he uses prophets who
[1:45:32] don't know anything see many have taken
[1:45:36] the brave step to accept this word to
[1:45:38] accept Christ to accept the true word in
[1:45:41] their life yet too often
[1:45:46] we as a pastor I hear such such feelings
[1:45:51] of disappointment
[1:45:53] in people I have them myself when I go
[1:45:56] to prayer you have them now I'm going to
[1:45:59] really get down to your address friends
[1:46:00] We're All in This Together amen
[1:46:04] okay it can be very disheartening when
[1:46:07] the when the joy and the blessings of
[1:46:11] the Lord that you once felt seem to fade
[1:46:14] over
[1:46:16] time
[1:46:17] often too often times leaving sometimes
[1:46:21] leaving God's Born Again family to
[1:46:24] question their
[1:46:25] experience question their very
[1:46:28] experience or or at the least you know
[1:46:30] why your experience with such a lovely
[1:46:33] Lord Jesus uh hasn't been as fulfilling
[1:46:36] as you had
[1:46:39] hoped and Satan can take you down a road
[1:46:43] of
[1:46:45] inadequacy and you wonder why the Lord
[1:46:49] called you at
[1:46:51] all amen
[1:46:54] wondered why why did he call me in the
[1:46:57] first place and many times friends if it
[1:47:00] wasn't for my firm belief in a first
[1:47:03] place oh Hallelujah if it wasn't that I
[1:47:06] knew that there was a first place if it
[1:47:09] wasn't that I knew that that that that
[1:47:11] that the many times that I've that I've
[1:47:13] had to face or that you have faced
[1:47:15] impossible discouragement and I'm not
[1:47:18] even prone to discouragement because I I
[1:47:20] know I love God and I know I'm I believe
[1:47:23] his word and I I know I was there's a
[1:47:25] first place and I was in
[1:47:27] it and I and I and I maybe I haven't
[1:47:30] reach that goal and I thought uh my my
[1:47:33] Christian Life should be more than this
[1:47:35] and it should accomplish more than it
[1:47:36] has accomplished and we can always feel
[1:47:39] those kinds of feelings of of of
[1:47:41] inadequacy come on I can't be the only
[1:47:43] one here
[1:47:44] today this is a dark hour this is
[1:47:47] impossible odds we're we're under an
[1:47:50] onslaught like the world has never seen
[1:47:52] and that's why you you hear the words of
[1:47:53] the Lord to you today you need to abide
[1:47:56] in me and I in
[1:48:01] you if it wasn't for my firm belief in
[1:48:04] that first place
[1:48:07] my sometimes we find ourselves and if
[1:48:09] you're honest you'll know that I'm
[1:48:11] talking to you are not me but the Holy

[1:48:38] for more of it I I long for victory in
[1:48:43] it but too
[1:48:45] often you find yourself coming up

[1:48:57] deserves and you know it
[1:49:01] you like me painfully know
[1:49:06] it I want to say to you

[1:51:00] sister Brenda Song you were singing amen

[1:51:05] little more
[1:51:08] worshipful as I was listening to brother
[1:51:10] Tony sing that I thought my I'm going to
[1:51:12] have him sing that wherever I end up in
[1:51:15] my sermon today I didn't know where I
[1:51:16] would end up all heads bowed all heart
[1:51:19] eyes
[1:51:21] closed
[1:51:23] Lord so much more to
[1:51:26] say feels like that
[1:51:28] I barely just did get to my main thought
[1:51:32] and
[1:51:33] now constraints of Time Lord and I
[1:51:35] wouldn't have to close these people
[1:51:37] would keep right on listening but I
[1:51:39] don't want them to lose it I I don't
[1:51:41] want to overs sponge them I want their
[1:51:43] hearts and Minds to be full of what this
[1:51:45] thought is today and I feel in my
[1:51:49] heart by the acknowledgement of your
[1:51:53] spirit that enough has been
[1:51:56] said Lord there's more we'll say and
[1:51:59] more we'll hear but sufficient for the
[1:52:03] day is what we've heard now I pray
[1:52:06] master that the words that have been
[1:52:08] heard will Echo long Lord in the canyons
[1:52:11] of their
[1:52:13] soul all through the remainder of the
[1:52:15] day and this evening and tomorrow and
[1:52:17] days to
[1:52:19] come that they'll have a deeper desire
[1:52:22] desire Lord and the these words that
[1:52:24] they heard will come back to their
[1:52:27] mind you said what I do now you know not
[1:52:30] but you'll know Hereafter may it be so
[1:52:32] Lord God may it come in such a way that
[1:52:36] there's such a sufficiency of strength
[1:52:38] in it that it will lift us up above the
[1:52:41] shadows of this broken
[1:52:43] world this broken sad
[1:52:46] world there's a new one coming I'm so
[1:52:49] glad for that I'm so glad this is not
[1:52:51] all there is
[1:52:53] sometimes the unbeliever becomes so
[1:52:55] discouraged they take their own life
[1:52:57] they they chase everywhere and they can
[1:52:59] never find true joy and true happiness
[1:53:02] but we have found the pearl of great
[1:53:05] praise we have found you in your word
[1:53:07] today you rescued us Lord when we it was
[1:53:10] so unnatural to us because our our
[1:53:13] fallen nature would have never agreed
[1:53:15] with your word but that Supernatural
[1:53:19] power of God came down broke our heart
[1:53:21] entered in
[1:53:23] we love you Lord I know today Lord God
[1:53:27] that this church is filled with people
[1:53:29] and out across the

[1:53:37] mistakes regrets up I'm inundated with
[1:53:40] regrets for
[1:53:42] failure sometimes we feel overwhelmed
[1:53:45] with those regrets but Lord I know that
[1:53:47] that's not a reflection and I and the
[1:53:50] beauty of it is is I know that you know
[1:53:52] that that it's not a reflection of my
[1:53:55] faith I'm I'm I'm sorry help me to press
[1:53:57] harder oh God help us as a congregation
