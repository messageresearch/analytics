God bless you all this morning let's all stand and just have a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for just the Gathering Together of your people Lord just to be able to come and hear your word father minister to our hearts father open up our hearts Lord help us to just lay aside everything every weight every burden of this life and just come into the house of God today Lord and enter into your presence we love you pray you to open up this word this morning in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you let's go ahead and turn into our Bibles we're going to turn to proverbs 4 and verse 7 we're taking a a part three today on uh a little thing I've been doing on angles um so proverbs 4 and verse 7 chap proverbs 4 and verse 7 says wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding these are the same scriptures that we opened with the last couple of times James chapter 1 and verse 5 says if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given to him amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning so I want to cover just a few highlights um from last Sunday just to give background but we're going to pick up the reading from 2 Corinthians chapter 12 that I kind of ended with last time um 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and verses one a familiar reading for us I'm sure Paul would write it is not expedient for me to doubt for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in body I cannot tell or whether out of body I cannot tell God knoweth such as one caught up in the third heaven and I knew such a one such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heared unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such unwill I will glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in mine infirmities for though I would desire to Glory I should not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above the that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions and distresses for what for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong and you know the first part of that chapter you know we're talking about this trial that Paul was facing this this infirmity you know and he sought the Lord uh for three times three different occasions and there was a vision involved and this was obviously a very big part of Paul's life because a whole chapter was dedicated to this time and finally Paul came to this revelation of the situation of this trial that the Lord allowed him to see that his suffering in this matter was actually a blessing in disguise it was actually the working of God's grace in his life maybe and he even said this maybe to keep him humble in some aspect maybe it was to show an example and this is this is something that we can all benefit from but maybe was Show an example for the next several thousand years that all believers are able to look at this chapter and give thanks in all things amen for this is the will of Christ concerning you 1 Thessalonians 55:18 you are to give thanks in all things you are to give thanks in those infirmities even when it seems like it doesn't make sense even when it seems like it's just the the worst thing in the world we are to give thanks in all things I think too often times we can get so caught up in the circumstance this is why this has dealt with me so uh so closely lately we can get so caught up in in the details of the trial or the details of the circumstance or even deeper than that my dad and I were talking about this and we can get so caught up in the mind battles that come along with the trial or with the circumstance amen who else gets caught up in that we all get caught up in those things because what goes along with that is that the enemy is trying to to keep you from growing and maturing in that specific area you know he he he put it across God's desk God knew that you were going to have to go through this God God allowed it but you know and I was just thinking about this last night or two nights ago when I was studying for this I can just imagine the Mind battles that Paul was having during this time he sought the Lord three times he wasn't he wasn't uh um you know he went through those same kind of mind battles that you went through he was a man he was subject to those things and I can just imagine some of those those thoughts that the devil was probably probably giving him how can you you know how can you say that Jesus is the Healer of all of your diseases when you're going around you're praying for the sick yet you're suffering this Affliction yourself you've sought the Lord three times does he even answer your prayers these are the kind of mind battles that come along with those things and those are normal when you have those things you are to Glory even more because you know that there is something in this there's something greater in this that God is bringing out you know he probably the devil probably sent thoughts to him you know you persecuted Jesus and and his followers and now you think you're somehow worthy enough to to preach and to pray for the sick and to do these things these are the things that I no doubt were probably going through his mind and he was able to come to this this realization by Revelation that whether or not my physical body is prospering or whether or not my my mental capacity is prospering I'm living in Victory amen and we are to come to that same Revelation whether or not I feel good or whether or not I feel Victorious that is an a factor in the victory I'm living in Victory because I have the mental attitude the right mental attitude toward every promise of God brings it to fast because I have the mental attitude that you know as long as I'm in the will I know that I'm in the will of God and I'm walking exactly where he wants me to do then then I'm walking in Victory amen and that's the Revelation that Paul was able to to have and to come to in my in my strengths you know in anything prosperous in my life the glory to go I'm going to give the glory to God and it's because of him amen and anything that you have that's prospering in your life it's because of God God glor God give God the glory in that and then on the flip side in my weaknesses the glory still goes to God because I know that because of of what Paul teaches that he uses those weaknesses to bring me to a deeper place in him you know he wants you know I look at you got to look at trials like man the Lord wants me to be more mature in my walk with him so glory to God he gave me a trial so somehow I can walk in a greater Victory than I was walking in before amen I he wants me to be more mature he wants me to have a greater understanding of the word he wants me to have a greater Revelation and when you know those things then you can really walk in Victory amen you can't you know if if you're beating yourself up over these things like like you know job had that and they would come to him and they said you something in your life must not be right but job could say with that heart you know I I've walked upright before the Lord I I've had that there's it's not that it's Lord wanted to use that because the next several thousand years he was going to have Believers look at that he was going to have people look at your life and they say How are you getting through what you're getting through how how do you do this or how do you do that we all have situations in our life and we can look at that how are you getting through that it's God I don't know God God it's God's grace in my life he's sufficient I'm going to glory in these things because it's God Amen and I want it to be um you know to be an encouragement to you because and I had sent this to I had saw just it was just a little uh picture about this but the devil isn't leaving you alone for a certain reason am mean there's a reason that that he's not leaving you alone even when you're suffering that trial you know and I think it's sometimes it's just his last ditch effort to hinder the work of God in your life you know he tried to send you this trial the trial didn't work so then he's going to send the Mind battle on top of the trial that's not going to work because we're going to glory in everything that God gives us and we're going to we're going to whether we're prospering physically or not we're going to move forward amen so we're talking about perspective uh we were talking about perspective last week and the correlation that it has to our life in faith um and to our daily walk of faith and we just to go through a couple of things that we went through last week we went through this Con concept of art of what artists call perspective and the definition is the art of drawing solid objects on two-dimensional surfaces so as to give the right impression of their height their width their depth and position in relation to each other when viewed from a particular point so in other words it creates a realistic sense about the image and I wanted to add this it was just what Google's AI generative writes about it a picture without linear perspective is an image where parallel lines do not converge towards a vanishing point meaning objects in the distance do not appear smaller compared to closer objects effectively creating a flattened appearance often seen in Styles like traditional Chinese painting or early medevial art where the focus is on depicting objects as flat planes rather than creating a realistic sense of depth so and one writer writes it like this a perspective allows you to stay there deep into the distance of that painting even though it was drawn on a flat surface and I'm going to give you some examples here um if we could you have that go to the first oh that's the first slide perfect so um I mentioned this last time when I was defining it but I wanted to show some visuals today to help us grasp that the concept so these are these are some images the first image I have here is a picture without linear perspective and what you what you're looking at is they kind of Drew the image on top of another one so there's the three on the one side and three and they're kind of drawn on top and you know you can kind of get visually you can kind of understand that they're supposed to be kind of behind each other but it there's not like a lot of perspective there you can obviously tell you're looking at that and there's not a reality to that image it's it's it's something that's drawn and you're getting you're getting visually what the artist is trying to get get across the the main point but there's no there's no reality there's no depth to it they're drawn on top of the reason uh each other and if you can go to the next one you know um so if you look at this picture this picture has perspective this is a this is a drawing this isn't a physical taken picture but you can look at it and you can see those dis those buildings look like they're in a distance right they're you're look you look like you're looking at a a a real object you're you're the the PE there's people that are close there's people that are far away but that was drawn on a flat image right if you go to the next one there's some cool examples so this is just a a traditional um Chinese so you can see you know they're walking over and uh you know you can see distance you can see close it just it looks real okay if you go to the next one um so you can get this is kind of when it started introducing this is the Christ supper so you can kind of see you know there's they're behind and you can see how you know Jesus is supposed to be in front of that and then there's in the distance mountains and so you can kind of get the the understanding of it and I think there's might be one more which I thought was really cool this one I mean you look like you're looking at a real image I mean you're looking at a reality of something that was drawn they were looking at this and you can kind of see the perspective you can see how this building is closer and so that's what perspective brings in art so another core reason I think that was the last slide you can you can take it down another core reason um for perspective and why artists use it is that it can allow you to see the image from the Viewpoint that the artist intended you to see it from so the Viewpoint so and that's kind of a the core of today what what I'm trying to get across today that it it allows the viewer to see the image or the sculpture or whatever work of art it is from the same field of vision that the art artist got the inspiration for that for that uh piece of art the way that the artist sees it you know often times when something is viewed from a certain angle that we talked about the first Sunday school lesson it can't be fully appreciated but once you get it in the right field of vision it can be altogether different you know it adds Dimension it adds depth and Paul was able to realize that this would give more glory to God than if he were to be healed of this thing you know he sought the Lord but God gave him that that understanding and to look at a scripture like that and and have in in his situation and honestly from a from a sincere heart to be able to say that kind of a thing and to actually glory in in a real circumstance that's going on that shows that there was a real presence of Christ in his life that really shows that you know only God can do something like that um you know and I made this statement last time and I've I've said it multiple times but this concept of of per of linear perspective you know it adds a reality you know a layer of something to the image that it didn't have before and you know sure without without perspective we saw that that first image we got the gist of what what we're looking at or the general concept but when you start adding this mathematical depth to the image it creates something that takes it from being uh for instance something on a page and it creates a reality of it you know you're you're able to look at it you know that's what the Holy Ghost does to our lives you're able to take the words on this page and you're able to to see the reality you're able to truly glory in an infirmity you're able to truly walk in faith and victory you're able to truly understand some of some of what the scripture says only the Holy Ghost can give that kind of a thing and to add the real perspective and depth that God intends for our lives um and he Paul was able to have this whole new layer of perspective and this this just this elevated thought process and he let it shape his whole outlook on the situation you know he let the Lord change his perspective um so many times us Children of Children Of God you know they'll they'll kind of be thinking about what they're going through and they'll want to have you know they'll try to grit their teeth and try to understand but with with getting in all things that you're getting get wisdom so when you're going through what we're going through whatever it is I mean it doesn't have to be some crazy once in a-lifetime trial we go through things every day there's there's small things that we go through that are just small uh footsteps they're small building pieces on our Christian walk and to be able to say Lord how am I going to get my what do you want me to learn from this to be able to have that kind of a an outlook on it and say say well you know take a step back and and try to look at it from a different perspective rather than you know always trying to to grit your teeth and oh this needs to be done or that's where your prayer life comes into play and and you you able to you able to say God help me to learn from this situation I want to be able to have that kind of that kind of attitude so that when I'm faced with any situation you know I can take a step back and this is what Paul did he took a step back and he realized that this was a part of the arst process you know when you're when you're drawing a masterpiece I've never drawn one but when the when an artist is drawing a masterpiece and they began to add layers of depth to it you know that perspective that we talked about it doesn't always look so pretty at first you know there's a there's a process and sometimes the only one who can who can actually see what's going to be the final product of it is the artists themselves the final the final work the only one who may be able to see it is the artist until it's finished but if you give it time and you let the artist finish what he had in mind to do and to fulfill his image uh that he had in his mind it's all going to be worth it you know and God it's all going to be worth it because God's God's the greatest artist that ever lived you know he's the greatest thing he he knows all things amen and so he has an image for you and he has an image for me and sometimes it doesn't always look exactly how it how how we think it should look but he's got he's got it all in control um and sometimes our eyes only really scratch the surface of that image but we know the end and we know it's going to be a masterpiece right I wanted to get into a quote this morning um I wasn't able to get to last week brother bandam says in uh let's see what sermon is this um I think it's 1963 I think it's um Christ is the mystery I have it written down in another note but if you if you need it get with me um that puts me in mind of a Greek artist I seen one time in an ancient Cathedral showing that Adam and Eve looked like they looked like beasts or something and that's what the carnal mind can perceive of some spiritual thing I think Adam was the most handsome man that ever lived and Eve was a perfect woman in every way now carnal Minds wrap up the thing in their own ideas then God sends down and unfolds The Thing by his power and that's exactly what took place there in the days of Ahab so what he's saying is is you know sometimes we perceive things to be a certain way we wrap it up in our own idea but then God sends down the power and sends down and unfolds the thing he uncovers the secret mystery to it and the most incredible thing about the God that we serve is is that he was the first intelligence right we have this artificial intelligence now he was the first intelligence and that artificial intelligence that we're that are that we've been tapping into for a long time but you know that especially now it's it's mindblowing you can create images and videos that that look so real with nothing more than a single sentence or or certain words and what's so crazy about it too is that even in the name itself artificial intelligence it it lacks it it lacks something you know it's an an it's an element that that it can never possess and that is life amen I had this uh patient coming in to to the clinic probably a month or two ago and they're from overseas and I think it was Denmark somewhere in Denmark or or um one of those smaller European countries Sweden maybe and they're incorporating AI into a lot of their business models and a lot of even like communicators and they're starting to have to write laws because people think they're talking to other people but they're not they're talking to artificial intelligence so they're having to incorporate these laws and it's I mean it's in crazy it's it's incredible that they're even having to write those laws but what it doesn't possess you know you can um you know the this development of AI you know it's going to make I think it's going to make really great strides for science and medicine in the years to come until the Lord comes for for us but it will never possess that depth of real life it will never you know talking about angles and perspective um to possess that real life there's just there's something there's something different about it you know and even even though AI is far more intelligent than I could ever be or than we could ever be all it has to look at or feed on is information it has details or statistics or patterns but just as Pastor has been dealing so heavily in that in that series the last several months Faith Works outside of that realm it works outside of information it works outside of patterns it works outside of Statistics Faith Works and operates in a different realm than that and even when technology has now Advanced to the point of capturing images with the megapixels and allowing us to to take a moment and almost hold it forever you know that's what a picture does you take a moment and it's almost like you're holding it forever even in the progression of that kind of Technology you know that the camera that it evolved from art it's still just an image that you can look at and that you can appreciate it's not something tangible it's not it's not right now it's not reality but faith is right now Faith is the realist reality human perception and what brother random was was getting at human perception versus Christ reality Pastor made this statement several weeks ago I'm just paraphrasing but it went something like this the reality of Christ is more than our P more real than our P perception on any matter the reality want say that again the reality of Christ is more real than our perception on any matter and that's what faith is that that statement struck me because you know our kind our carnal Minds just like what brother Brenham said our carnal Minds wrap up things and we put our own ideas around it and sometimes it's just common sense you know if if you've got common sense not everybody does but when you have common sense sometimes you know we have this this portion you know of you know in order of of function in in everyday Society but that's not where Faith operates right our mind is limited our our human carnal mind is limited to the constructs of our senses and we know that and and our then conscience and reason but that's you know and that's an elementary concept but faith is something that that transcends our understanding of what a reality is it's when God step in and shows us The Heavenly perspective on the matter amen he unfolds the realer if I could say it like that reality of what is happening that's what faith is supposed to do in our lives it's supposed to add perspective but it's it takes it further than just adding perspective it adds a new reality A New Perspective to that amen and that that Pastor uh that statement Pastor made um I think it was in that same same sermon he says the devil gets you to accept your reasoning you know when Peter went to go and and transcend that law of nature by operating the realm that Jesus meant for him to be in what he was doing when he was walking on water is he was operating in that Faith realm but what the devil and this is this is what he was saying is what the devil got him to do is to operate in his human realm right he took that Faith aspect away he started operating in a common sense realm this is water I by the laws of physics I should sink but for a moment in time he wasn't he was operating in the realm that Jesus intended for him to be operating in and the greatest artist that was to ever live made that picture in his life that picture of fear have more depth to it he was scared but but the the greatest artist ever live knew that there was a greater perspective that could be had in that moment and so he showed that to Peter he showed that there was more depth to this particular he took that two-dimensional time in his life and he he added a dimension to it he added it made it a third dimension and you know and I believe you know he he knew and we said this last time that that was that he was just showing Peter he knew Peter would eventually operate so confidently in that realm after he received the Holy Ghost and you know last time we talked about our trials and how God uses those very situations to get us to operate our faith in those things you know God will allow things in our life because and I was I had this um I don't know if I brought it here but I brought it to uh I think brother Blue's church but when um J Jas and his and and his daughter had died he was being driven to his Perfection he was always brother bam talks about that he was a secret believer but then his daughter passed away and died and that was when the reality of Christ came to fruition in his life because God Jesus I believe Jesus was trying to get him to to to to a new a new place in Christ he was trying to show him that this is who I am he was always a Believer and sometimes that's what trials do in our life God is trying to get you to a new place he's trying to trying to allely to see I want to be greater in your life I want I want more I want more of your heart I don't believe that the Lord I got to wrap up here I don't believe the Lord wants us to live shallow Christian lives and have just a form of godliness you know living right and acting right those things are good going to church those are good just having a prayer life those things are good but not having any kind of demonstration of Faith or power in our life I believe God wants us to to have those things you know adding Faith a faith perspective to it you know that depth I want that depth in my life I don't want I don't want my reasoning I don't want I I don't want to come to my senses if my senses are going to make me sink then I don't want to come to my senses in a situation like what Pastor said I want to walk on that water amen and I want to I want to live in Victory and if that means walking on water When God says I can then that's exactly what I want to do you know and the devil's objective is to keep get you to keep you focused on either your perspective on the matter or his perspective on the matter you know it's and that's going to keep you in a faith a surface level Faith with no depth it'll keep you from Victory um so I just want us in myose cling comments this morning um when you're battling something take these scriptures and bring them to mind and let let the word help you gain depth and gain perspective in whatever it is whatever situation that you're in whatever you're praying about whatever whatever it is let the Lord you know some step away from your mind's narrow perspective because that's what it is our minds have a narrow perspective especially when you're in a situation that you feel like it's a trial or something we have a narrow perspective step away from that and allow your allow the Lord allow a Heavenly perspective to come and show you exactly what it is that and I have some more I guess we'll get to it another time Heavenly Father Lord we love you so much and we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for your word I pray you just be with Pastor today as he brings us the word father may it anoint him Lord anoint our ears to hear what you have to say we love you we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you
