amen praise the Lord happy to have him here today and all of the different ones amen some out of town also uh see I didn't know if the guys would be here I know brother George sister Andrea there in Florida so I guess Caleb and Josh unless I'm staring at them amen and other different ones out out of town so I just want to be remembering them today you love the Lord amen are you still a as much a Christian this year as when last year ended oh my praise the Lord I say I'm not only as much but I want to go higher and higher deeper and deeper closer and closer Amen in the presence of the Lord amen had a wonderful time I got to see some video clips last night brother Diggs with the young people was that last night or Friday night Friday night very good and then I think last night they had uh were you were you surprised [Laughter] amen praise the Lord so uh big dog had a birthday and so I told him I said according to brother Joel Forney you can call a man a dog as long as you call him a big dog amen so uh we wanted to wish him a happy birthday sure loved brother Aaron and his wonderful family amen praise God second Thessalonians chapter 2 I want to begin today uh with part two of the spirit of lawlessness that we started on with our first Sunday into the new year and want to look uh at continuing on praise the Lord first a second Thessalonians chapter 2. let's begin at verse 1. now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God so this is quite a trick of smoke and mirrors that the devil is able to pull off you'd think this is impossible how could anyone mistake Lucifer for the true God but actually he's going to set right in the temple of God in other words you know we know that the Bible shows us that our in our flesh our bodies are the Temple of the Lord so he's going to set right that was his desire to set in the congregation remember that so so this is shocking that the prophecy is telling us in no uncertain terms that at the end time the whole Christian world except for those who it's impossible to deceive amen everybody else is going to get duped into believing that they're worshiping God and pleasing God and all the time they're worshiping the devil that that's mind-blowing and that's that's really what what causes the age that coming to pass is why in the Old Testament it was called darkness and gross Darkness on the people so actually the the evil in the world the man's man's mind is even worse and the only way you can get worse than evil is to worship evil amen friends to those who it's impossible to deceive to those who are predestinated not to fall I say to you Shalom good morning oh let the son of righteousness rise in our midst today where a great grand privileged people to believe and see and hear what we see and hear there is a great spirit of lawlessness in the world Amen let's bow our heads father we thank you for this word and feeling your anointing speedily we're very grateful to you for that and I pray now that you'll break the bread of life to us Lord as you have opened my heart to it I pray I'm able to convey it father I commit it to you give us sharp Minds may we just now Lord capture our minds Lord we dismiss the cares of yesterday and the plans for tomorrow and if tomorrow even arrives Lord why why should we worry about it as you said sufficient is the day Lord and so we don't even have a guarantee of tomorrow why would we surely we wouldn't sit here at the moment of eternal life hearing the word of God and be thinking about uh something that may not even come Lord and whatever happened yesterday can't be undone so all we can do is appeal to your Grace today we commit ourselves into your hands for the word give us hearing Hearts we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated staggering prophecy that Paul is laying out here and how that his uh you know he's saying now we beseech you brother brother and so so this is uh a kind of a power word that Paul is using to say hey I'm making a big point I I'm earnestly saying this I'm not just casually I beseech you I implore you I appeal to you you know pay pay close attention because we're we're we're going to speak about the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together unto him I mean Paul could not preface the principle he's about to make and the prophecy he's about to give I don't think he could build a better platform to get the bride's attention to say listen what I'm about to say is relevant to the coming of the Lord is there anything in your Christian experience more important than that see so Paul is saying he's saying I'm I'm going to establish this upon we're going to talk about the coming of the Lord and our gathering together unto him not we're not just going to come to church there's coming a day Friends when the dead in Christ are going to rise we which are alive will be changed and in a month or so meet the Lord in the air this is a gathering together unto him there's nothing more Paramount there's nothing more important there should be nothing that occupies your Christianity more than pressing toward that Mark of that prize of that High Calling is that a fair statement so there could be nothing more important then I mean if you think about how Paul is capturing our attention does I mean if if you're just listening to Paul and you don't read the next verse yet you're going wow oh he's getting ready to make on enormous point wow let me pay attention it might be quiet hold on Paul let's get ready to say something about the coming of the Lord about my gathering together unto him children sit still everybody patient here comes get ready see Don't Be Shaken in mind huh are troubled you mean Paul what are you saying what Paul is trying to tell you is that there's coming something at the end time at the coming of the Lord just before we gather together there's coming something in the world that shakes the mind of men and Paul is saying don't you get caught in that not by any means don't not by by Spirit by word or even a letter from US see let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they're coming here's a big one there's going to come A Falling Away first and that man of sin is going to be revealed the Son of Perdition so this man of sin the ESV which we're going to look at quite a bit and I don't think they have it in the back uh but I'm and so it's okay but I'm going to Gideon if you can secure the ESV translation fine don't worry about it if you can't but I'm going to read it to you and you're going to see how many times Paul is going to use this word and it's a in the King James it's most often iniquity because that's a that's a really bad sin because that means you actually knew better and did it anyway see and so and so are you new what God was telling you to do and you refused it my and that just it takes my breath away I said Lord don't ever let me be guilty of that brother Bradham said I would rather face God as a sinner then face him as a hypocrite I mean that's a mouthful from a prophet I'd rather face him as a sinner but whatever I do don't face him as a hypocrite don't sit in the house of God year and year out and just be a hypocrite you're coming here to receive life so I say to you receive life receive all that God has for you and don't hold back and don't hinder him because the only the only person that has the authority in creation the only person that has authority to hinder God from helping you is you and that's a delegated authority from him he set his kingdom up in that way that he wouldn't force himself on you that he he implores you to open your heart and open your mind and cast down vain imagination and bring every thought subject to him but he won't force you to do that see he says to you he pleads with you let the mind which was in Christ be in you but he won't jam it in there if you block it he he goes he has the Apostle Paul to write to you to to to the Believers and says let the word of God dwell in you richly how about it come on how about it here's a good idea allow permit you Believers permit the word of God to dwell in you not casually not mediocrity but let it dwell in you richly see there's where your free moral agency resides you're saved through faith by grace see but now when it comes to your to your overcoming that's why brother Brandon when he would go he would go to the book of Philemon and he would say you know brother Brandon will talk about all the hell that Paul started all of it started his letters and he would he would say Paul Paul you know a servant uh of Jesus Christ Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ not by the will of man you know and you know Paul and have all these different ways of starting his letters Paul an apostle Paul a servant Paul you know a minister for your sake but when he comes to this book he says Paul a prisoner and now there's other places where Paul talks about being a prisoner brother Brown's not suggesting that's the only place he's just saying as far as opening a letter he's starting a letter Paul is the only place he says Paul a prisoner and brother Branham says to be a to be a servant of God to be an apostle of God that's just that's God's choosing God has to call a man to that he says but to be a prisoner that's you that's your choice that's you making that decision see so so God called him to be an apostle God called him to be a minister uh to the Gentiles but Paul had to elect to choose to be a slave to be a prisoner see so we find that in this age that's coming this man of sin is to be revealed he's the son of perdition so now here is where we I don't know if it's the last point I made in part one but we were making the point to you somewhere I believe near the end if not the end of how that that you know in the Old Testament there were all kinds of prophecies that that the text on parchment written by chroniclers and Prophets that that text migrated and it became flesh in Jesus and so so there was a migration see and so when Jesus is getting ready to go away and he says now a little while the world won't see me but you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you that became a text and they even even wrote it down the the the writers of the Gospel put that on paper but on the day of Pentecost that paper word migrated to become flesh and I'm not talking about when it got put on paper I'm just simply making the point that in the upper room that prophecy that came out of the words of Our Lord actually went to a migration until it became humans so now here Paul is talking about the end time the Kingdom time the Gathering time the coming time and he says there's a man of sin that's going to be revealed in other words revealed means to be uncovered see that that's what the book apocalypse is the Book of Revelation means all right now that microphone is already there I'm not about to create it I'm just going to reveal it I'm going to uncover it see and so he's saying that because the spirit of lawlessness you're going to hear in a minute the spirit of of lawlessness this man of sin this Antichrist Spirit doth already work in the church but I'm here to tell you at the end time at the Kingdom time at the coming time just before we gather together these words this man of sin must be revealed is going to migrate to flesh there's going to be a migration from the page that the text is in migration it's being material I say why is the world in such a shape because this text is being materialized in real time and it's happening right around you and it will be more materialized tomorrow I think it would do good for us to remember that the things of the world are an antichrist Spirit materialized you just remember that the next time you're giving too much carnality to the modern world and all of its entertainments think about that young people next time you've got your computer in your hand and you're scrolling through all of its stupid nonsense you're you're looking at the man of sin being materialized and he's trying to make to materialize inside of you just like the word is trying to become material inside of you there's a there's a man of sin trying to become material to sit in the congregation and in among the saints and be counted as a worshiped being I think that's powerful say is it so bad all right let's see how bad it is this man of sin who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God so now put that on your list this spirit trying to materialize itself in you it's trying to go from text to flesh and that which is trying to go from text to flesh opposeth and exalteth itself against God so now you decide what you want to feed on you think about that next time you're feeding on it brother Chris and I were talking today about we were talking about the Judgment striking the West Coast he was showing me a headline and I was just I pitched him a quote or brother I'm talks about judgment on the west coast because because God's going to sink Hollywood he's going to sink and he's going to sink for hundreds and hundreds of miles in circumference around it it's like it's like in the days of the Old Testament when you know when when these men rose up when Cara and Nathan rose up against Moses and God said to Moses tell the people you know identify yourself whoever is on the Lord's Side get over here near me quickly and whoever's not just stay right there near Cora and Nathan and that's so arrogant was Cora and dathan that they literally walked out in their tent door as if daring Moses let's see what kind of power you really got prophet now that's bad enough because the Earth ended up opening up and swallowing them alive that's not the sad part they got what was coming but what's sad is their families and their children and their wives and the people who they loved went down with them so let me say to parents today whoever's on the Lord's side gather under the word Hallelujah forsake these worlds this world for your family's sake if you don't love yourself enough to be spiritual love them enough so we find then that now so I'm going to read this in the ESV that we just read these first four verses of second Thessalonians 2. he says now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him we ask you Brothers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by a spirit or a spoken word or a letter seeming to be from us to the effect that the day of the Lord Has Come let no man deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the Rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness he's a man of sin see the King James says this man of sin this man of lawlessness is revealed can you give me a little further description sure the son of Destruction so who say brother Jason who is controlling the world the son of Destruction who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called God or object of worship so that he takes his seed in the temple of God proclaiming himself to be God so we find that this Spirit of lawlessness in the world today and this was a real burden on my heart in part one to because you remember that we read in in Joel's prophecy that everything that this Lawless man for six thousand years from Genesis has robbed God's family he has taken peace whenever he could from God's family who were entitled to peace he's taken Health from God's family even though they had Jehovah Jireh they had Jehovah's shalom they had you know a provider they had Jehovah Rafa the Healer they had the captain they hadn't they had the warrior king they had said canoe they had all of these they were entitled they were in unentitled people in the earth they're actually the only ones who were the whole world taught you know it's amazing to me that the whole world you know wants all kinds of things given to them and you know and I and I'm not not at all subtracting from the inhumanities that people have been treated you think about the Native Americans and what they've went through at the hands of of the white man who's the Rascal and history is replete with abuses of of minorities and but you know to to the Native Americans and they they make all these claims about their land and you this is my land and you've taken my land well I only know of one piece of land in the whole earth that actually people have a title deed to it and that's Israel Abraham and his descendants are the only one if you care about what the Creator did they're the only ones who the Creator said here's a section of land I'm going to give it to you now I get civilizations and people migrated and took over lands and then stronger people came in and took it that's that's the cruelty of sin you're not gonna there'll be no peace till Jesus comes see thank God for millennium find that find that and take the treasures of God's love from God's family he's still trying to do it today rest assured friends as much as you love the Lord and you come to church and I hope you do and but but just understand this that Satan is always trying to take it from you and that was the beauty to me of Joel's prophecy that the Lord said when this Lawless one has run his course I've let him run his course he that letteth will let I'm going to allow it till I get taken out of the way Lord you're going to get taken out of the way how's that going to happen my bride's going to go on a rapture so you're saying you are your bride correct she is him and when she goes all the grace for the Gentiles and mercy and blood go with her and then the Gentiles are plunged into and there's nothing left but judgment and so I I loved the prophecy because it talks about it the Kingdom time which is what I've been really zeroing in on we're at the time of the Cove the coming Kingdom I've read you the quotes out of the seventh seal where brother Brandon said it's been it's already been happening all around it's been happening all week I was waiting to see if my church would catch it you didn't you missed it but it's okay you weren't supposed to and that's how we were explaining last time that it was the infancy of the Bride her infant age that she didn't catch it and and an argument ensued for a decade and a half almost two decades after the prophet's gone is this are the Seals even is the seven seal open well if it's not none of them are and this is what we've learned in the sermons after the seals and having 60 years to grow into a mature Pride and now it's uncontested we realize that and the problem the reason people couldn't see it and they they questioned it is because it took us a while to realize that the opening of the seventh seal was a happening behind flesh of his pride that it was the Mighty God unveiled and when you unveiled the Mighty God you unveiled his bride you unfailed his body no wonder you're a Believer no wonder you can't get away from it no wonder you love it because you're part of it you're listen this is not a false statement God's elect lady is just as much a part of God as this is it's all the same substance that's what the devil don't want you to believe and even if you do believe it he's trying every way to get into your business to keep you from enjoying it he's trying to corrupt and pollute you and keep your mind so carnal in the things of the world that you never even get to enjoy live out your whole life here as a believer overcome the deception which is which is the requirement of the age there's no other requirement upon us just to overcome the deception of the age and see the word of God and say Amen to every word does it mean we can always perform it God's going to have to perform it but I'm going to believe it and I'm going to pray and ask him Lord take whatever means necessary bring me to it see this Lawless one has no no hesitancy to try to get you to disbelieve the word of God he'll lie right in the face of God you think he won't lie to you Psalms 109 Psalms 109. uh catch these first seven verses hold not thy peace o God of my praise for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue now this is David this is a Messianic psalm that's going to refer to the Lord Jesus when he comes they're going to hold a trial and they're going to lie on him okay verse 2 for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with the lying tongue this happened at both of his trials it happened two thousand years ago at his trial and it's happening today when a prophet gave him a new trial said he didn't get a fair trial I'm going to give him a new trial Hallelujah and the prophet defended him but finally has to come back around again after he proves after brother Branham proved unequivocally that the word can be trusted and they still rejected it and he said very well that in the presence of the judge with prophetic Authority I indict this generation not a church not a denomination of the entire generation I indict you as guilty for the second crucifixion because again you're telling lies you're telling the world things like it doesn't matter how you live it's only what's in your heart you're telling the world all kinds of false teaching you're telling women they can do this and when the Bible forbids it men can do this when the Bible forbids it ministers can live like this when the Bible is clear all kinds of perverted lifestyles are okay that's a lie say oh it don't matter oh it matters it matters verse three they Compass me about also this is the day and hour you live in this is the second is that his second coming just like it was at his first one they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me look at that Without a Cause that fourth verse just for my love they are my adversaries but I give myself unto prayer they despise them that do good again now and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love you know those who are condemned at the Judgment bar will be justifiably condemned because they refused the love of the son of God they didn't love the word brother Branham says you you love Satan so you say you love God said but your life proves you you hate God you love Satan your lifestyle proves it Steve so they're condemned very justifiably so verse 6 set now a wicked man over him I think I read this in a past one or two sermons ago I just wanted to revisit it a little bit or maybe I was teaching it on a Bible study I don't rightly remember said thou a wicked man over him and let Satan stand at his right hand so that's a pretty bad place to be because now you're in a court of law you're in you're in the Heavenly Supreme Court the the the the Earth's over Armageddon is over the the Satan was bound A Thousand Years the the Millennium went for a thousand years and now we're coming back and they're going to they're going to be he's going to be loose for a little season and he's going to try to encamp the re the camp of the redeemed gonna encircle us because he'll have back all of his armies since the days of Genesis and you say why would anybody follow him because brother Branham said I mean that's a fair question why at the end of the Millennium what all these armies I mean they've been in hell and and the joke's over and it's on them why would they follow him again thinking I mean I would think in my mind I'm going to run to the king and beg for mercy I just got out of hell I'm going to go one more time Lord help please help me I'll I'll promise I'll serve you and instead they rally with Lucifer to try to kill the lamb again and kill all of his people again iniquity knows no bounds lawlessness once you give over to lawlessness it knows no bounds you go insane following that spirit why would the people rise up and be Resurrected and follow him again because it proves what a prophet taught us death changes nothing the same character you went down with is the same one you raise up with and they spent a whole lifetime following Lucifer and rejecting God so it's not strange at all that when they come back to to Resurrection they just go right on with what they had always been doing because it seems to them to be the right thing to do this is how Satan this is this is how powerful the spirit of the Lawless one is brother Branham says to his denominational Brethren many of them his dear friends November the 27th 1963 the world is again falling apart he'd already preached at one time he's coming at it again the world is again falling apart brother Branham says now this is he's going to show you that what the spirit of lawlessness this man of sin has done to the minds of people he says in different scientists wants to make themselves a great name each Nation wants to get its brainy man so now he's in science and education he's in politics they each Nation wants to get its brainy man we want ours we want the educational system in it we want a denominationalism because I mean what hypocrite wouldn't it'll let you do whatever you want and let you live anyway and still call yourself a Christian and still Pat you on the head at night and let you go to bed and sleep easy thinking you're fine and brother Brandon said on that day there'll be millions of people fodder for an atomic age who thought they were okay now watch what brother Branham exposes about the mind of God I this this blows my mind because I just I can't hardly get my mind wrapped around it this is what they wanted we want an educational system in it we want a denominationalism brother Brown says that's just exactly what we got that's what you did that's what you wanted that's what God gave you now what you're going to do with it after you got it because that denominationalism led you to the mark of the beast and now you're trapped but that's what you wanted that's what God gave you why'd God do that because that's what you wanted see that's what God gave you see now what you're going to do with it after you got it verse 7. when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his prayers become sin that's an astonishing statement could you ever imagine prayer to God could be called sin [Applause] but but you understand and this is the point I think I made at some point previous teaching somewhere that when they come in Matthew 7 and they realize that their their you know their their whole thing of uh their whole thing of impersonating Christianity was working great in the earth and so they try that in heaven because they in the earth here's what they said they're going to be condemned and they're like whoa wait huh what do you mean well wait a minute we we preached in your name we did many mighty works are you kidding see and the King will just say to them there in Matthew 7 it goes along with Matthew 25 and Revelation 17 18 19 all the way through there especially uh getting over there in the 19 and you find that that what they what had worked for them in the Earth was to impersonate Christianity so when they get to heaven and they see the bride on the throne and they know they've missed that but they see the foolish virgin gaining eternal life even though they didn't show up with it then they go hmm let's try it again it worked in the earth out just impersonate Christianity and they say we did what they did we preached they preached we preached they built hospitals we built hospitals they did good we did good and the King will say to yeah but you're you did it with iniquity in your hearts because that plea that plea that they're making that's what a prayer is that's what praying is there that's why you you have to turn the legal term prayer for judgment that's actually a legal term a judge can give you he can find you guilty and just sending you to prayer for judgment meaning you need to go pray and ask God to forgive you they don't do it anymore but they used to do it probably some old Christian judges still handed out my sister got that one time for a speeding ticket and the judge felt she started crying as girls do and the judge felt sorry for her and and I hope she's not watching and she's just like I don't have any money just take me to jail just take me to jail and the judge is like get out of here get her out of here prayer for judgment prayer for judgment hahaha she quit crying pretty fast a prayer it's a plea hey please here's a prayer give me eternal life I see them getting it give it to me too but but the but the king will say to them he's not denying their Works he's simply saying they don't count because what you had iniquity in your heart and you're trying to play me you're trying to game the system you can't do it that way see so in verse 7 is coming to pass his prayer is sin because he's literally lying in court he's lying under oath in the courtroom of Heaven even in the face of the judge himself the I'm going to tell you something friends the Lawless one at the end time has unprecedented control over the minds of Fallen Humanity you're no match for him and your intellectualism you need to be born again of the spirit of God only the baptism of the Holy Ghost can help you he has unprecedented control over the minds of Fallen Humanity at the end time Matthew 7 23 I'm going to read it for you from the ESV and I'm going to read you several here right out of the ESV Matthew 7 23 then will I declare to them I never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness work iniquity see so why why am I correlating this because here's why because I I don't want you to think I'm trying to warn you against an action I'm trying to warn you against a person the man of lawlessness who's who's worshiped like God and controlling the minds of men see so when he's saying you practice lawlessness you worked iniquity you let the instead of letting the mind of Christ be in you you'll let the mind of the Lawless one control you amen Matthew 13 41 the son of man will send out his angels and they will gather his beautiful Matthew 13 as the church ages perfectly taught on it before the son of man will send out his angels is that the end and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and those who practice lawlessness in other words the King James says them which do iniquity those who this is that's why the Millennium I'm not going to have to live with iniquity I'm not gonna have to live with Lawless people I'm not going to have to be around that I'm not going to have to worry about Neighbors playing loud music or people drinking and throwing beer bottles in nature and I can't even enjoy I can't even go down to the beach and and I have a right to do it my father built it it's for my enjoyment but half-dressed women prevent me from enjoying my inheritance I'm not going to have that in the Millennium brother Brandon said there won't be any pop-haired women there I'll guarantee you that there won't be any half-dressed females there won't be any men cursing and drinking and smoking thank God Matthew 23 28 even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men but inside he's warning these Pharisees outwardly you appear righteous to men but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness Matthew 24 12 and because lawlessness will abound the love of many will grow cold see our King James says iniquity because iniquity will abound when will it abound it's always been here Cain started with iniquity where's your brother how am I supposed to know am I My Brother's Keeper you liar you know exactly where he is how do you know because his blood is crying out to me from the ground take ownership of what you did that the world is so absent of that nobody owns it anymore big corporations cheat us all and poison us and kill us and and they pay a fine and they refuse they won't even admit guilt they make a deal with the government we're going to pay out you know 50 billion dollars but we're not admitting guilt oh why are you paying on 50 billion dollars well just to get out of it see nobody owns it everybody blames somebody it's not my fault it's not my fault that I got these complexes and these problems it's my it's my parents fault yeah that's who it is what's my preacher's fault that's that's what it is well this happened to me when I was a child and somebody and a spouse did this to me and somebody did that to me and this is why I can't be an overcomer nonsense you'll have more than enough power from on high to be free of everything that's contrary to God's word oh we should Rejoice over that friends we don't have to be bound if we stay bound it's because we allow it because lawlessness will abound the love of many will grow cold in Romans 6 19 I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh for just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness this is when you were a sinner when you presented your members your your site your hand your take your touch your taste your smell your ears what you gave yourself to see just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness the Bible says iniquity unto iniquity see so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for Holiness friends I I could it'd be amazing to you today and I'm not even an expert in it but we could have an economics major come up here and you would be shocked at the power of compounding interest you'd be surprised how compounding interest can keep you in debt forever you can never get out of it you can find out how compounding interest can make you a rich person if you if you if you follow it logically and sensibly but the devil knows that the devil knows that iniquity if unchecked leads to more iniquity lawlessness when you follow the Lawless man you become a lawless person it's compounding interest and you find yourself 10 years deep as a Believer and still bound and trapped and and maybe you've got 98 freedom but there's a one or half or two percent and you feel more trapped now than when you 10 years ago when you gave your heart to the Lord why it's compounding iniquity it's iniquity leading towards compounding interest this is why there's such power of there's such overcoming power if you'll just start doing the little things if you'll just get a prayer life that's consistent if you just that simple if you just start coming to church whenever the doors are open if you'll start if you'll start putting the Kingdom of Heaven first in your life and let everything else be second third and fourth and fifth on Down the Line you'll be shocked it just won't take long down the road you'll have so much overcoming power you'll have so much spirituality you'll wonder man what was I ever thinking see that's how it can affect you and it's just the opposite when you don't do those little things second Corinthians 6 14 you good second Corinthians 6 14. do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers that's pretty clear I mean I don't even know how to make that clear there there is absolutely young sisters if you're going after a worldly boy you're insane young men if you're if you find that some half dressed girl is appealing to you and you're going after that you're insane you've lost your mind amen he says do not be unequally yoked oh I'm going to lead them to the truth not likely I'm going to win them not likely in the Old Testament when somebody had a taking a Nazarite vow and anybody could take one it's just for a certain time it didn't mean a lifetime necessarily people didn't into a Nazarite vow man or woman it didn't matter and and if even accidentally something unclean touched them they were immediately polluted if even somebody died in near him and fell and touched them as they fell and hit the ground they're now polluted so so and that's what the prophet asked those priests he said if something is clean and it touches something unclean does the unclean become cleaner does the clean become unclean and they looked in the law and they said no whatever's clean if it touches the unclean becomes unclean see so you know God doesn't need you to do that God has a God knows who Your Divine mate is in the world and if you just stay humble God will bring them to you stay a Christian stay in prayer keep the Holy Ghost over you you'll attract the right one without it you'll attract the wrong one the Lawless man will see to that that's free it's not in my notes no charge do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with lawlessness the King James says what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with Darkness there II Thessalonians 2 7 for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way that's the bride going in the rapture see that that's warnings now there's also a prophecy here and among many here's one that I picked out in Hebrews 1 9 because this is to the elect in Prophecy you have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness how many would say me Paul right here thank you Paul that's me I have loved righteousness I have hated lawlessness I've made mistakes but I hated it and I repented I haven't been perfect but I sure didn't stay there I found an altar somewhere I couldn't sleep I couldn't function I had to repent why do you keep doing that because I hate lawlessness I love righteousness therefore because you did that Therefore your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions more than your fellows more than your peers more than your school comes more than your work Associates God has poured oil of gladness on you why because you loved righteousness that that this text do you realize this text is migrating to flesh do you realize that's coming to pass a worthy pride is being materialized in real time Hallelujah by the word I just say take that devil do your do your best do your worst however however you want to say it but I know this these words are becoming material in me this word is migrating in a a bride is being materialized in real time say what's life all about you're being materialized why are we still here you're being materialized why has it been this long because you're still being materialized what's going to happen when when I get fully materialized it's over we go home Friends Are Dead In Christ rise we which are alive and remain are changed see this is the time of the unsealing this is the time of the unsealing can I have 15 more minutes this this Kingdom time this breaking of the seals to reveal the the Mighty God and to reveal his family to expose the man of sin the man of lawlessness to separate light from Darkness so the bride can see where she's going so that an earth in darkness and gross Darkness upon people we still have a way we still have a uh we still have a perfect perfect guiding star that's leading us home see not in the first Exodus let me let me take a I'm going to turn a corner here the first Exodus when Israel's leaving Egypt God's family you say what's so important about brother branham's saying the kingdom is coming as it has been and it correlates it to materialization he correlates it to a leukemia case a leukemia girl or a boy and another case of a little girl and so he's he the the kingdom coming is not a metaphor it's not poetic license it's an announcement of something happening in real time it's something materializing and so then when we go back you say so then this is why brother Brandon would preach the Third Exodus because there's a first one there's a second one and there's a third one and the first one was Israel coming out of Egypt the second one was when Jesus came out of the Tomb and the third one is when the dead in Christ rise and we are changed and go home see so when we go back so brother Brandon wants to show the pattern this is this is what you'll see at the time of the Kingdom because in the first Exodus God's family was leaving to become a kingdom of saints in the earth that was the whole purpose that's why God called Abraham and he told him he'd have seed after him that's why Israel was established as a nation God took Israel as a holy people peculiar chaste people and he dropped them right down in the big middle of heathen Nations all around them now that's what the Millennium is going to be it's going to be Jerusalem becoming what it was intended to be in the first place it's going to become the Bastion of righteousness and Holiness and here's where the administration of God's laws and righteousness spread throughout the world that was what Israel was supposed to do they were leaving in the first Exodus they were leaving Egypt they were leaving the world to establish a kingdom of Saints and the Earth to be an example of all the heathenations around them which they failed to do that's why God sent him into captivity see now here here's I I said all that just to background here here's some here's what brother Brandon brought us and the token because people for 2000 years had been in churches and for 2000 years people had been preaching and Christianity spreading around the world and brother Branham has the audacity to come up and and here's the work of here's men in denominations the culmination of hundreds of years hundreds of years in some cases more than a thousand years of work and brother Branham is saying all that was great during the ages but now that the seals have been opened there's another step and if you want to go in the Rapture you're going to have to go to this next step see oh now watch this all Israelite all of them all Israelite families in the first Exodus had circumcised Fathers and Sons so they had the mark of of circumcision of being a Jew just like just like people said in message in Christian churches and say I'm a Christian and brother Bradham says you're you're just you're admiring the fine qualities of Jesus it's just a mental affair who wouldn't admire the fine qualities of Jesus a gentle truthful man who went about doing good who doesn't want to be who wouldn't want to be like that see and had powers of Heaven at his command and stay you know and and he he saved the whole world so who's not going to admire him but brother Graham said it's still just a mental thing it doesn't really you're not really allowing him to come in and change your heart that's why he came that's what the Holy Ghost is given for not to have you join a church or keep a code but to change your heart see say well I go to church I'm a Christian well all Israel all their Fathers and Sons are circumcised they all had all of them had Abraham as their forefather so here they are circumcised males a bloodline right back to Abraham absolutely dead to rights full legal rights to the Covenant is it but for the accident yes there had to be a fresh kill of a perfect lamb and that blood had to be put on display for the worldly Egypt to see so you could claim Christianity all day long at the Third Exodus but millions are going to find themselves fodder for an atomic age because they didn't have the token yes they said we believe in Jesus and yes they said in Christian churches and yes they sung gospel songs mostly sometimes yes they had Bibles that they read from but with brother Branham tried to implore them to say but if you don't have the token you're not going to make it see so so it was fine to be an Israelite being lineage of Abraham being circumcised dads and Sons but for the Exodus now it's coming to the kingdom you get me now it's it's not the ages now it's coming to the kingdom part where you've got you've got a a bride's time a Harvest Time a bride's age that's happening in the same last age not in eighth age but within the seventh age because the the layout of cnh was the very shortest one of all they rejected Christ long ago and put Christ down and the seals were opened that a prophet called us out of there that age is done and never Reviving again this is the time of the Bride who has the word and the word only see this is Kingdom time so you can't just sit in a church not even a message Church you can't have brother Jason as a pastor it wouldn't do you any good you've got to have the token it won't it won't get you in heaven just pushing play though you should push it every day but even that won't get you in a Rapture you've got to have the token they had to be identified with the lamb or brother Branham said the unconditional Covenant was annulled see brother Branham says now the second Exodus and the body the Bible says when Jesus came the bodies many doesn't say all many of the bodies of the Saints which slept arose and at his resurrection and went in with him but you notice it didn't say all see now here we are at the second Exodus now it's the time of the Kingdom Jesus is getting ready to establish his kingdom in the earth you know in in 50 days he's going to establish the kingdom pilate asked him are you a king he says my if my if I was a king my subject would fight for me they're not here yet they will be and then they'll fight they'll take a stand but right now I'm all alone that's the way it's by Design but now the kingdom is coming at the resurrection the Holy Ghost is only 50 days out now waiting for Pentecost that's 50. that's Jubilee and so brother Branham comes here to this to the second Exodus and watch what he says this is that elected that bride when it says many of the bodies of the Saints which slap a rose not all but many see brother Brown says there is that elected that bride the Old Testament bride not all the Jewish Church come forth at that time all them now watch all of them made the same sacrifice all of them was under the shed blood of the lamb but there was an elected group and that elected group as soon as that event come that really believed in it with sincerity now I'm coming to the word overcome this is from how can I overcome he he now hold that see these that had really overcome sincerely making the same offering that the rest of them made but in sincerity overcome the things of the world not everybody at the time of the Rapture that saith Lord Lord will go in the rapture see when the propitiation correctly was made for them they were in Paradise until that until that play at that time when that time was made they had overcome and was resting sleeping see many bodies of those that slept in the dust he slept now we come to the Third Exodus so now you can see it's going to take a it's those those Jews in the first Exodus had to have the sincerity to say yes I'm yes I have a list Abraham and yes I have circumcision but a prophet has said I gotta have a token on display and I'm going to be sincere and do it and when they and because they did it they came out of the Tomb on the second Exodus with him now the third is upon us Sona it's upon us friends the Third Exodus is here let's make clear under the opening of The Seven Seals see because it identified the Mighty God Among Us it unveiled him and revealed his elect family and what is she called to she's called To The Feast of the word now watch in the last days he sent out this invitation he's he's preaching all through the gospels about his coming Kingdom and he he comes to Luke 14. let's find that Ethan Luke 14. I got to hurry I promised you I got four minutes to try to finish so he says in Luke 14 where we'll start somewhere down because um here Jesus is teaching on humility and he goes down and don't take the upper chamber wait till you be asked and or you get embarrassed and he goes down um um uh verse 15 Ethan and now Jesus finishes his sermon on humility and this man speaks up and says and when one of them sat that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God now when he makes that statement and he references the kingdom of God Jesus how blessed it'll be for the man that breaks bread with you in the kingdom of God Jesus turns and begins to teach then said he unto him now this is Kingdom this is you this is now this is right now this is what the message is then he said to them a certain man made a great supper and paid many and he sent his servant at supper time at supper time to say to them that we're bid and come for all things are not ready you believe that and they all with one consent begin to make excuse to first set into my ball a piece of ground I must need to go and see it I pray they have an excuse so here's a man letting business and commerce keep him out of the kingdom of God my and another said I bought five yoke of ox and I go to prove them I pray have me excuse another said I've married a wife now now domestic now family I got a job I got a career I got an education I you know I got to do this and I got to do that and I I got this to be a part of and that to be a part of and I I just don't have time to come to a feast [Music] but deceased you're declining is the Feast of the word say why is that so important because it's this word as you eat and you become what you eat is materializing Hallelujah so if you're only feeding on the world you're going to materialize the world it's that simple verse 22 verse 21. so that servant came and showed his Lord these things the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the hall and the blind servant said I mean listen friends when I look at that 21st verse the the only way that I know to cover all the streets and lanes and alleys and homes and places all over the world is with the modern technology we have today and that's why we leverage it that's why we use it because when that when this gospel not you see when Jesus said when this gospel so it's not the not the limited version of The Gospel in the ages it's the original when that gospel is restored and preached in all the world then cometh the end and that's where we're at friends where when we're spreading this gospel not a watered down Church age gospel but the original faith of the fathers and the serpent said verse 22 and the servant said Lord it is done as I was commanded yet there's room the Lord said unto his servant go out into the highways and hedges compel them to command that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which forbidden shall taste of my supper this word suffers a Greek word that means the chief meal of the Jews Greeks and Romans taken at or towards evening and often prolonged into the night hence usually an evening banquet this is why we've been here so long friends this is why we're still here because this banquet of the word has been going around the world for more than 60 years and it's run late into the night and it's run late into the evening but it's still the evening meal and we're still partaking of it don't worry Joy comes in the morning Hallelujah oh my she becomes more and more this Bride As she becomes more and more a living mystery you realize it literally causes the sleeping Saints to resurrect oh yeah cause them to resurrect and we who are still here and slugging it out with the Devil this word becomes a living Tabernacle of Flesh that's me is that you today this word literally becomes a living Tabernacle of Flesh why because I'm slugging it out with the Devil oh many of them have already gone ahead of us they're already resting I'm still here slugging it out saying what are you going to be doing tomorrow slugging it out why are you at church today I'm learning some new moves I'm going to put them on the devil tomorrow you're going to step up I'm going to pop him I'm here to tell you I'm gonna fight him and fight him and fight him until the saints come out and we which are alive and remain are changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's what the kingdom is trumpeting to us that's what the seals were open for that's the coming of the Lord that you have arrived at it's been in motion for more than half a century the kingdom is coming the prophet said as it has been I'm so thankful to be a believer let us say Lord you know I I was I was the other day I was and I'll I'll just stop here let's give you a little testimony the other day I was up early I was studying and thinking about things and um sister Debbie I think was awake I'd she gets Coffee in Bed every morning and so I brought her her hot coffee after heat it because the the coffee pot don't make it hot enough for her and so I gave her coffee give her a morning squeeze ask her how she slept turn on her little fireplace and close her door so I can go back in there and set some more in the quiet morning and I started thinking and I started talking to the Lord and I and I just said Lord you know at the end of the day I I you know I I don't always find myself at the levels of Victory like a Envision seemed like I hard to be further ahead seems like hard to be stronger than him do you get do you get that friends you get that surely I'm not the only one you know I'm always fighting this perpetually perpetually if I'm not careful the devil I'll let the devil get a upper handle me and discourage me I always fighting this Spirit of uh this this feeling of underachieving underachieving always under achieving and and there's a balance to that and I realize I pray all the time ask the Lord to help me with that and this was one of those mornings where he decided to come help me and I I was just saying well Lord all I know is and I'm crying and I'm trying to trying to feel better about myself and I said Lord all I know is that the Bible says that if I've at the end of it all if I've done everything that has been asked of me I am to say I am the Lord's unprofitable servant because that's humility no matter what you accomplish brothers sisters young people no matter what you accomplish remember if you've done everything that's been asked of you your last will and testimony shall be I was the Lord's unprofitable servant Jesus led me all the way Hallelujah I look back over my life I regret my mistakes and I regret and I just say Lord I'm just your unprofitable servant and the Lord just began to talk to me and say yeah it was that that's by Design and I thought what what huh what's by Design so what do you honestly think you could ever repay me for all I've done for you you're always going to be on an unprofitable investment for me you were never going to be equal I I was never going to get back my investment I I pull life and blood for you you can't you can't begin to equal the price I paid for you I was always and I thought you mean I I was always going to be an unprofitable servant Heaven lord said of course said of course said you're not an investment to me I love you and I thought to myself and I ran in there I told my wife and I started crying she started crying and I said you know I thought about this I thought how much I love my wife and I thought yeah my wife I don't grade her she's not a she's not an investment I love her I go out and I I spend money in resources buying her stuff you know why so I can see that smile it's not about an investment it's not a balance sheet she's not a prospectus out of spent double to see that smile I just been triple to see that smile Hallelujah this this isn't a report card this is a marriage license you are always going to be unprofitable you never could repay him all you can do why don't you do it with me stand to your feet and raise up your hands say Lord I'm yours my whole heart my whole life I'm yours I can never repay you but take what I am o God and help me and use me oh is that your desire Bethel Tabernacle is that your desire friends oh it's a love affair it's not about him not I'm not being graded created I'm not I'm not a Roi is there's not another return on investment [Applause] he loved me he loves you yeah you'll never equal it you'll always be an underachiever but I'm going to give you the message he gave me that's by Design so at the end of the day now I'm going to say on Resurrection morning I was the Lord's unprofitable service and now I'm going home hallelujah oh let's raise up our hands and thank him Lord we thank you this morning how we worship you oh God We Adore You for Your Truth oh god oh your majesty takes our Breath Away Lord So Glorious what a plan when I think about Redemption I say my goodness what a plan what a plan who could have come up with it except a god it would have taken a god with an infinite mind who could literally account for everything leave nothing leave no way for me to be lost no way for me to miss it seal me in sealed in by the Holy Ghost I'll never come into the Judgment Lord I am your unprofitable servant and I've never been more happy in my whole life I thank you for these things Lord I Thank you that it's love I thank you that it's love I thank you that your throne is established in Mercy oh while all all heads are bowed and all eyes are closed I wonder if there's somebody here today and maybe you haven't known the Lord and the way that I'm preaching today and you'd like to say preacher I'm going to raise up my hand and say I want to know him that way there are some Honest Hearts I want to know him in the power of his resurrection that's honest hands God sees that friend say I've always felt I know I'm his unprofitable servant I just want to be more for him oh
