[3:48] good morning
[3:50] god bless you let's stand to our feet
[3:51] we're going to turn to revelation
[3:53] chapter 2 this morning continuing on
[3:56] in our revelation series through the
[4:00] entire book of revelation not
[4:02] exhaustively in this class
[4:04] but we want to cover enough
[4:08] to lay in some good some good teaching
[4:11] give you some
[4:12] understanding amen teaching is what
[4:14] establishes
[4:15] us it shows us what we believe
[4:18] and why we believe it and the book of
[4:21] revelation
[4:22] both qualifies and quantifies
[4:26] and gives us con context for why we're
[4:28] here
[4:29] how we got to here what's it all about
[4:32] and what's ahead
[4:34] so it's uh certainly the bride's book at
[4:36] the end time we keep repeating that
[4:38] because it is such a paramount statement
[4:40] revelation chapter 2
[4:43] verse 1 unto the angel of the church of
[4:47] ephesus
[4:47] write these things saith he that holdeth
[4:51] the seven stars in his right hand
[4:53] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[4:56] golden
[4:56] candlesticks i know thy works and thy
[5:00] labor
[5:00] and thy patience and how thou cast not
[5:03] bear them
[5:04] which are evil and thou has tried them
[5:08] which say they are apostles and are not
[5:11] and has found them liars and has borne
[5:14] and has patience and for my name's sake
[5:17] has labored and has not fainted
[5:20] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[5:22] thee because
[5:24] thou has left thy first love remember
[5:27] therefore
[5:28] from whence thou art fallen and repent
[5:31] and do the first works or else i will
[5:34] come unto thee quickly
[5:36] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[5:39] his place
[5:40] except thou repent but this
[5:43] thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of
[5:47] the nicolaitans
[5:48] which i also hate he that hath an ear
[5:52] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[5:55] the churches
[5:56] to him that overcometh will i give to
[5:58] eat of the tree of life
[6:00] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[6:02] god let's pray
[6:04] father we're committing ourselves into
[6:06] your hands for service now
[6:08] lord i pray that you will allow this
[6:10] lesson to come forth
[6:12] concisely lord that it might bring a
[6:14] benefit to our understanding
[6:16] we commit it to you in jesus name amen
[6:18] god bless you friends you can be seated
[6:22] good to have you all here in the house
[6:25] of the lord for sunday school i sure
[6:27] appreciate it
[6:29] i don't really have the words to tell
[6:31] you how just how much
[6:32] i appreciate it it means a great deal to
[6:34] me hopefully others are coming along
[6:37] quickly
[6:38] and or at least catching the stream
[6:40] because we
[6:41] spend a lot of time laboring over this
[6:44] and we want to make sure that
[6:45] if i cook it i want to make sure you eat
[6:47] it amen
[6:48] so it's not me of course cooking it i'm
[6:50] just preparing the ingredients it's the
[6:52] lord that has to
[6:53] have to get it finished amen so we found
[6:56] in our
[6:57] in our previous studies when we were
[6:59] covering the first chapter
[7:01] of revelation how that it was a net it
[7:05] was necessary that the book
[7:07] begin with the revelation of jesus
[7:10] christ and the
[7:11] entire chapter in fact is laid out to
[7:14] that end
[7:15] so that we can have a clear
[7:17] understanding
[7:18] of the seven characteristics of christ
[7:21] which are listed
[7:22] in the first chapter and we then last
[7:26] time
[7:27] we did an introduction to chapter 2 and
[7:30] we called it a breach
[7:31] between chapters 1 and chapter 2 and the
[7:34] reason we called it a breach not
[7:36] necessarily
[7:37] to connect it in your mind to the sermon
[7:39] brother branham preached on the breach
[7:41] though he said
[7:42] that was to connect the ages to the
[7:44] seals but and i
[7:45] and there's a part of it of that that is
[7:47] relevant and i and i did mean a part of
[7:49] it in that way
[7:50] however i i also wanted to emphasize and
[7:54] did emphasize
[7:55] and restate today that you want to
[7:59] we needed to have that connection
[8:01] because
[8:02] it's not it wasn't going to stay in
[8:05] jesus christ
[8:06] the whole point of the book of
[8:09] revelation
[8:11] is to show the continuation of jesus
[8:14] christ
[8:15] you have the gospels for his ministry on
[8:18] earth
[8:18] you have the book of acts for the
[8:20] history the way
[8:22] the ways and the understanding of how
[8:25] christ poured out his spirit on the
[8:26] church and how he moved and the things
[8:28] that he taught the things that were
[8:29] established
[8:30] and the book of acts sets up the
[8:32] epistles that come later
[8:34] from the apostles people who do not like
[8:36] to include the book of acts might as
[8:38] well throw the bible away certainly the
[8:40] new testament
[8:41] because the book of acts is what
[8:42] connects the gospels to
[8:44] the epistles because the the book of
[8:47] acts is the epistles being lived
[8:50] amen so with without the book of acts
[8:53] then paul came to you in word only
[8:56] but he said i didn't come in word only
[8:58] and he has the book of acts to prove it
[9:00] amen so he came in power and
[9:03] demonstration as did
[9:04] peter and stephen and james and the
[9:07] different
[9:08] ones that it deals with in the early
[9:09] part of the book of acts
[9:11] but then of course the book of
[9:12] revelation was not written
[9:14] uh during paul's day and in fact is it
[9:17] was
[9:18] after that the apostle paul had gone
[9:20] home that's why paul doesn't quote from
[9:22] it now paul
[9:23] will we'll quote out of the old
[9:25] testament which re which is then
[9:26] repeated in the in the book of
[9:28] revelation
[9:29] fact is you i think um every chapter
[9:32] except for two chapters in the book of
[9:34] revelation
[9:35] refer back to daniel's prophecy and so
[9:38] everything that's in daniel's prophecy
[9:40] is in the book of revelation and in
[9:42] other various places
[9:43] of the old testament but we find then
[9:46] that
[9:47] that paul leaves the scene and then john
[9:51] with polycarp uh with polycarp was his
[9:54] student and then the student of polycarp
[9:56] was ireneus who
[9:57] was the messenger of the second age so
[9:59] this is spanning decades now
[10:01] but john as an elder statesman uh
[10:04] is after the apostle is gone he's the
[10:07] last one
[10:07] to die uh many of them have already been
[10:10] have been their lives have been taken
[10:12] and john is still alive and he he teams
[10:16] up with his student polycarp
[10:18] to gather all of the letters all of the
[10:21] epistles of
[10:22] you know that that had ever been written
[10:24] you know his own epistles the
[10:26] epistles of peter of james of jude
[10:29] of the of saint paul and he's actually
[10:32] compiling them and translating them in
[10:36] to make a bible
[10:37] and the romans catch him doing that
[10:42] and since christianity was considered
[10:44] contraband at that time
[10:46] they arrested him for it and they put
[10:48] him on the
[10:49] prison island of patmos and that's why
[10:51] john says
[10:52] i was on the prison i was on patmos for
[10:55] the word of god
[10:56] because he was actually translating it
[10:58] and uh he was
[11:00] working you know under the undercover
[11:03] and uh they caught him now
[11:04] isn't this amazing and you're gonna see
[11:07] this repeat
[11:08] if you if you miss this what i'm about
[11:10] to say
[11:11] a lot of the things that you see
[11:13] prophesied concerning the church in the
[11:15] new testament
[11:16] you're going to look at it and say wow
[11:18] it looks like the devil snuck up on god
[11:21] and put one in there
[11:22] and maybe god didn't account for
[11:24] everything that that's what the devil
[11:26] tries to tell you in the day and hour
[11:27] that you live in
[11:28] that well you're facing things god
[11:29] didn't account for in his bible that's
[11:31] not true
[11:33] that's patently untrue you're facing
[11:35] things that
[11:36] brother branham didn't didn't account
[11:38] for in the message that is patently
[11:40] false
[11:41] that everything that you would ever
[11:43] encounter from the cradle to the grave
[11:45] is the answer for it is in god's word a
[11:48] prophet even tells us how that
[11:50] you know if you find yourself in a very
[11:52] difficult situation and you don't know
[11:54] what to do
[11:55] he said go like paul said they're for
[11:58] our examples
[12:00] right paul said that right bible readers
[12:03] bible readers paul said the the old
[12:05] testament is for our examples
[12:06] how many know that wow i thought i was
[12:09] gonna have to
[12:10] back up and start a genesis 1-1
[12:14] so brother branham now echoing that
[12:17] echoing that principle gives you a piece
[12:20] of advice he says when you get into
[12:21] sitch and i'm paraphrasing it
[12:23] don't have it in front of me but when
[12:24] you get in a situation and you're not
[12:26] sure what to do
[12:27] you're in a jam go back into the bible
[12:30] and find you a bible character who had a
[12:32] situation like that or similar to it
[12:35] and look how what he did and how god got
[12:38] him out of it
[12:39] and he said you just do the same thing
[12:41] and then god who can't respect persons
[12:43] will get you out of it as well
[12:44] so you can actually if you're if you're
[12:48] taking
[12:49] if you do that you can actually
[12:52] tell people it'll look like you're a
[12:54] prophet you can say
[12:55] god will get me out of it and here's
[12:57] exactly how i'll get out of it and when
[12:59] you do
[12:59] people would go wow how did you know
[13:01] that and i'll go well
[13:03] i had a prophet who told me go back into
[13:05] the word and saint paul had said they
[13:07] were for our examples
[13:08] and so we find out that the statement i
[13:11] want to make to you is this
[13:13] that when you look at what happened to
[13:16] john
[13:18] as a human being you could fairly say
[13:21] and it would not seem you know um
[13:24] out of the ordinary to say wow
[13:27] that just seems upside down that seems
[13:30] lord
[13:31] i'm just saying that seems
[13:32] counterintuitive to hear john was
[13:34] getting all the bible together and
[13:35] getting all the letters together he's
[13:37] the only one who could do it
[13:38] he's in translating it they're the only
[13:40] people in the world who can do it
[13:42] and you let him get arrested
[13:45] for real you know i didn't get arrested
[13:47] and put on an island
[13:48] they tried to kill him first and then
[13:50] they poked his eyes out how in the world
[13:52] is it
[13:53] but but what but what no one knew
[13:57] at that time was god wanted the book of
[14:00] revelation
[14:01] included and it hadn't been written by
[14:04] anybody
[14:05] so god stops john in his work his noble
[14:08] endeavor
[14:09] allows him to go to jail allows him to
[14:12] almost get killed boiled in oil
[14:15] put eyes put out put on a prison island
[14:18] and so then when he comes back now he
[14:20] can finish his work
[14:22] gather all the letters add the book of
[14:24] revelation to it
[14:26] and we find that while the book of
[14:28] revelation
[14:29] speaks to every age it speaks chiefly to
[14:33] our day
[14:34] because why what have i taught you
[14:37] john was caught up in the spirit to the
[14:40] lord's day
[14:41] amen so you understand so the book of
[14:44] revelation
[14:45] is primarily to you and i because we
[14:48] have arrived at
[14:49] the lord's day this is the time of the
[14:52] end
[14:52] of the gentiles and so when you
[14:56] look at the at the stories through
[14:59] the book of revelation and you begin to
[15:01] see
[15:02] things of the martyrdom and the noble
[15:05] saints of god and the things that seem
[15:07] to happen to the church and
[15:09] and then you even bring it into your day
[15:12] friends and you look at your life and it
[15:13] seems sometimes counterintuitive lord
[15:15] why are you letting
[15:16] this happen to me it doesn't make sense
[15:19] well it might not to you
[15:23] but it makes perfect sense to him
[15:25] because there's no accidents with god's
[15:27] family
[15:28] amen our whole objective of
[15:32] life is to stay out of the way
[15:36] be a conduit that god can flow
[15:40] his plan of his word through your vessel
[15:44] and stay out of the way don't plug up
[15:47] the flues
[15:48] don't plug up the pipe don't plug up the
[15:51] conduit
[15:52] don't put kinks in it don't feed on the
[15:55] things of the world and poisons and
[15:57] toxins and
[15:58] as brother branham used the old archaic
[16:00] term gom up the whole system
[16:02] you know it it it makes everything
[16:05] sticky it makes everything
[16:07] constricted it you know it's it's like
[16:09] you know in your in your body if you
[16:11] just think of the natural typing the
[16:12] spiritual as the bible does
[16:14] it refers to your body and makes a
[16:16] spiritual connection well
[16:18] what do they say happens to your body if
[16:21] you eat the wrong
[16:23] food it clogs up your arteries and then
[16:26] and then blood cells pile on top of
[16:28] blood cells and you have a suddenly you
[16:30] have
[16:31] a real serious problem and so so you
[16:34] don't want that to happen to you
[16:35] spiritually either
[16:37] it's not up to you to figure out your
[16:39] life
[16:40] it's not up to you to figure out you
[16:43] know what what should be your plans or
[16:45] be your dreams just relax stay humble
[16:50] pray let god open the doors in front of
[16:53] you
[16:54] and as he opens them then walk through
[16:56] them say well i i got this plan i got
[16:58] this plan i
[16:59] i want to have a certain education i
[17:00] want to have a certain career i want to
[17:01] have a certain
[17:02] marital life i want to have a certain
[17:04] status i want to have it fine nothing
[17:06] wrong with wanting to be
[17:07] and maximize every every gift that god
[17:10] has given you but
[17:11] remember you're not put here to live
[17:14] your life
[17:14] you're put here to live his life and if
[17:17] he blesses you in that way and opens
[17:20] those doors ahead if you find
[17:21] walk through them i've seen people
[17:24] become very you know fabulously
[17:25] successful
[17:26] and yet remained spiritual and so one of
[17:29] the things that you don't ever want to
[17:31] do
[17:32] is substitute spirituality for
[17:34] religiosity
[17:35] because i've seen many many people
[17:37] become very religious
[17:38] extremely but they don't get any more
[17:40] spiritual at all
[17:42] and you find that the fruit of their
[17:44] life doesn't bear spirituality
[17:46] and so we find then that that chapter 2
[17:50] now is is solidifying that
[17:53] you're actually going to begin to see
[17:57] god operating in his body now we
[18:00] dealt with that last time as we showed
[18:03] you and i'm not going to go over them
[18:04] all again today
[18:05] but we went to revelation 2 1 and we
[18:08] found identifications that he had spoke
[18:10] about in
[18:11] chapter 1 verse 13. we we went to 2
[18:14] 3 we went to chapter 2 verses 4 to 6.
[18:17] we went down to chapter 2 verse 7 and
[18:20] you find
[18:21] these seven characteristics of god
[18:24] are now to be lived in his church and
[18:27] they're
[18:27] listed in the church age though they
[18:29] were previously established
[18:31] in chapter one why is that why did we
[18:34] tell you that last time
[18:35] so that you can identify that you're
[18:38] living a life of christ
[18:40] because your life in chapter two matches
[18:42] his life in chapter one
[18:44] amen amen and i don't care how noble you
[18:48] feel or how educated you might get or
[18:50] how profound might be your thinking
[18:52] if your life in chapter in the church
[18:55] ages
[18:56] doesn't match his life in the revelation
[18:58] chapter one
[18:59] you're off course friends you're off
[19:01] you're off the trail so
[19:03] so he has declared his revelation to
[19:06] john
[19:07] in chapter one to show
[19:10] what she the church is to be and she's
[19:14] to be
[19:14] an active manifestation catch it
[19:18] she's to be an active manifestation
[19:21] in chapters two and 3 of what he
[19:24] revealed himself as
[19:26] in chapter 1. amen jesus doesn't come
[19:30] and live a life in the earth in
[19:31] revelation 1.
[19:33] he's already did that in the gospels but
[19:36] revelation 1
[19:37] opens with an understanding of his
[19:39] personage and all of his characteristics
[19:41] and chapters 2 and 3 are now designed
[19:45] for the church the body
[19:46] the bride to live out those
[19:49] characteristics that's the whole purpose
[19:51] of the holy ghost
[19:53] that's why the holy ghost came that's
[19:55] how you know you have it
[19:57] that's how you can that's how you are in
[19:59] a position
[20:00] that you have passed from death to life
[20:03] so
[20:03] the bride is demonstrating that he is
[20:07] actively operating through her
[20:10] she in this last day in the lord's day
[20:14] in the lord's day she is the voice of
[20:17] god to the age and her
[20:21] teachings and her lifestyles
[20:25] is god living through her
[20:29] so when she's the final voice to the
[20:31] final age she's not her own voice
[20:33] the church that's the mistake the church
[20:36] makes
[20:37] that's why brother branham said at the
[20:39] end time the church which he had been
[20:41] speaking through
[20:42] one of the unique characteristics of our
[20:44] day is finally he stopped speaking
[20:46] through the church
[20:48] he don't do that anymore in the after
[20:50] the last age
[20:51] because the church kicked him out and
[20:53] brother branham
[20:54] said the church is no longer his
[20:57] mouthpiece
[20:58] they have become their own mouthpiece
[21:01] and brother branham said
[21:03] going back to the book of genesis when
[21:05] adam
[21:06] sowed fig leaves brother branham said
[21:09] they they tr
[21:09] and their words even brother branham
[21:11] even noted that they almost rhyme
[21:13] he said they tr they traded leaves for
[21:16] creeds
[21:17] and he said when i read leaves he said
[21:19] it sounds a whole lot like creeds
[21:22] and he says they sow their creeds
[21:24] together and try to cover their shame
[21:26] but it no the leaf couldn't do that
[21:29] neither can the creeds do that
[21:30] it takes blood to reverse your shame
[21:34] amen so we find then that that
[21:37] the the the bride is not making the same
[21:41] fundamental mistake
[21:42] in the ages that the church makes here
[21:44] at the end time
[21:45] where they become their own voice she is
[21:48] the voice of god
[21:50] to this last age let's repeat my own
[21:53] note again
[21:54] and her teachings and her lifestyles
[21:57] are him speaking through her
[22:01] to the world amen
[22:04] he's trying to lead them to life
[22:07] and he's using you
[22:11] he's trying to lead the lost to life
[22:15] and he's using you he he
[22:18] he gave his you know i could say it like
[22:21] this
[22:22] that in the last day he gave his only
[22:24] begotten bride to lead them
[22:27] because he only had like the father had
[22:29] one begotten son
[22:30] christ only has one begotten bride who
[22:32] has become a creation
[22:34] of his spoken word it has brought her to
[22:38] life
[22:38] and she's the living epistle
[22:41] see that proves we've been restored back
[22:44] to paul's teaching
[22:45] that proves we've been restored the
[22:46] omega has now become the alpha
[22:48] because that's what the apostles taught
[22:50] that you are the temple of the holy
[22:52] ghost
[22:52] you are a written epistle that is to be
[22:54] read of all men
[22:56] amen all right i got five minutes let me
[22:59] let me
[23:00] let me try to get into the church age as
[23:02] best we can
[23:04] so brother branham talks about how that
[23:07] you know
[23:07] here in the statue of a perfect man so
[23:10] he said we started back here
[23:12] where was the church first founded where
[23:15] was the pentecostal church first founded
[23:18] by saint paul
[23:19] at ephesus the star see that's why
[23:22] today the azusa revivalist
[23:26] took the term pentecostal
[23:29] but it's a misnomer because they
[23:32] it and and i get but brother branham
[23:33] even uses that
[23:35] you know that wording he he because he's
[23:38] preaching to them and so he's trying to
[23:40] identify with them
[23:41] i get it but in his teaching brother
[23:43] brennan made it clear
[23:44] that that the azusa revival was not
[23:48] the pentecostal restoration and he said
[23:51] it what proved it is that they
[23:53] denominated
[23:55] and as soon as they denominated it
[23:56] proved that it was not all
[23:59] azusa was was another continuation
[24:02] of the restoration luther had
[24:03] justification wesley had sanctification
[24:06] the gifts of the spirit returned back to
[24:08] the church but the restoration could not
[24:11] come
[24:11] until elijah is on the earth and the
[24:14] mighty angel descends with the open book
[24:17] amen and so when the seals are open now
[24:20] elijah steps fully into his office
[24:22] and he's feeding the word comes from
[24:25] christ to the bride
[24:26] and you're eating the book because you
[24:29] must prophesy the prophet's going to go
[24:31] home
[24:33] and we don't need him to come back
[24:37] the voice is now in her see and so
[24:40] brother branham says he says all right
[24:42] where was the
[24:43] pentecostal church first founded saint
[24:46] paul
[24:46] at ephesus the star of the ephesian
[24:48] church age the second church age was
[24:51] smyrna
[24:51] virtue irenaeus you might hear greek
[24:54] scholars pronounce it irenaeus i just
[24:56] like brother branham's
[24:57] kentucky english better arrhenius the
[25:00] first
[25:01] he says the great man who held up
[25:04] the gospel of paul next church age in
[25:08] fact his
[25:08] arrhenius brother branham shows us was
[25:11] the last
[25:12] messenger who had a
[25:16] yeah it was irenaeus who had the full
[25:19] understanding of the godhead
[25:21] by the time it gets to martin it's
[25:23] already a little bit sideways
[25:25] by the time it gets to columbus it's
[25:26] more sideways by the time it gets to
[25:28] luther it's just
[25:28] it's gone and luther absolutely it
[25:31] preached a trinitarian
[25:33] personage of god so but irenaeus now is
[25:36] still holding on to it and
[25:38] that's why if you go to the second age
[25:41] you'll get you'll see it when we get to
[25:42] it i got to close
[25:43] but when we get to it you'll you'll
[25:45] you'll see that through the first and
[25:47] second age
[25:48] that they hadn't denied his name they'd
[25:50] stood for his name but then
[25:52] that name in ame is not mentioned
[25:54] anymore in any of the other ages
[25:56] until wesley's day when an open door is
[25:58] set there
[25:59] to restore the name of the lord jesus
[26:02] christ
[26:03] all right and so that that open door is
[26:05] a door that opens up at the end of the
[26:07] age and is never going to be shut till
[26:09] it till the millennium
[26:10] so it's the revelation of jesus christ
[26:12] and so that's
[26:13] why you had jesus name preachers coming
[26:15] and and water baptism in acts 2 38
[26:18] that's why because that
[26:19] got set at the end of the sixth age and
[26:22] if you go back in history
[26:24] it wasn't like 1906
[26:27] that suddenly here's old daddy seymour
[26:30] and he's just preaching a sermon and
[26:32] suddenly the building catches on fire
[26:34] what they think
[26:35] called the fire department out because
[26:37] people are saying this building's
[26:38] engulfed in flames and it
[26:39] building wasn't on fire at all it was
[26:40] the glow of the holy spirit people
[26:42] actually called the fire department
[26:44] but that did that suddenly it wasn't
[26:47] just in 1906 that god comes down
[26:49] bang here's the gift of the spirit
[26:51] that's historically not even how it
[26:53] happened
[26:54] years before that even the latter part
[26:57] of the 1800s
[26:58] you had men like partner and grant and
[27:01] men like that who preceded
[27:03] seymour who were actually already
[27:05] starting to preach the baptism of the
[27:07] spirit
[27:08] and and because why an open door had
[27:11] been set
[27:12] at the backside of the sixth age that's
[27:14] why brother branham said laodicea
[27:16] is almost could almost be thought of as
[27:18] just an extension of philadelphia
[27:20] because it's an open door that's going
[27:22] to go all the way
[27:24] into the and arrive at the day of the
[27:26] lord
[27:27] and then a prophet is going to come born
[27:29] out of season
[27:30] open the seals that last movement will
[27:33] reject
[27:34] that kick christ out a prophet will
[27:37] follow him out
[27:38] turn around and indict the church
[27:41] pronounce judgment upon her
[27:42] he'd already pronounced judgment on the
[27:44] nation right
[27:46] and now he pronounces judgment upon
[27:48] church systems and now he says come out
[27:51] of her
[27:51] my people and so so you realize now that
[27:55] the authority the the authority to
[27:57] indict the authority to judge by
[27:59] determining what is the right word
[28:01] and that's it god's done they're dead
[28:03] completely dead
[28:04] and that's it god's done they're dead
[28:06] completely dead
[28:07] and he's going to have to bring and it's
[28:09] going to go from columba
[28:11] it's going to go into the dark ages
[28:13] interestingly enough
[28:15] the catholic church what we call the
[28:18] dark ages
[28:18] they see that's where she established
[28:21] her false doctrine and
[28:22] and began began the beginnings of the
[28:26] balaamism and nicolaitanism but
[28:29] brother branham shows us it's not until
[28:31] 606
[28:32] that and that's even after columba has
[28:34] already gone
[28:35] when the age of thyatira opens
[28:38] columbus already off the scene so they
[28:41] put a triple crown
