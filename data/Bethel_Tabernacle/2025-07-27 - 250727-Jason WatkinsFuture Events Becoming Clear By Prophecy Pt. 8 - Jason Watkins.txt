Now his his boy Teddy has had uh one eye was like 20 over 200 which is legally blind and he was at Louisiana camp two years ago and he was told then that God was going to heal his eyesight. So that month Teddy took his glasses and destroyed them. And um just last night after service, Brother Andrew was preaching, but he he walked over to his mom and dad and said, "I can see better out of that eye than the other one." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen.

[Music] Every night there by your bed, close hold your eyes, bow your head, throwing up another prayer in faith. When you're wondering if he's hearing you, look at me. I'm living proof holy right where I am today cuz somebody pray. So I hit my knees cuz I've seen all heaven move. [Music] I pray, "Father, please, cuz I've seen all he can do. These hands have no power. There ain't he don't come true." That's why when mountains move I say looks like somebody prays [Music] worn out altars to is still I won't give up on you. I believe that nothing can change when somebody prays. [Applause] So I hit my knees cuz I've seen all heaven move. &gt;&gt; Don't matter if you hit my God. I pray father please cuz I see what he can do. Don't mind the storm coming. My God come through when you call. These hands have no power. But there ain't he don't come through.

And you hit rock bottom. My God pick you up when you're father please. Cuz I see what he can do. &gt;&gt; No matter if the storm cloud coming my God come through when you call.

Praise the Lord. wrote this song quite a while and years ago. And if it sounds a little homegrown, that's probably why. So, just listen to the words. [Music] Walking through this veil of sorrows, trusting Jesus for my tomorrows. There is nothing holding me down here. [Music] Well, I've burnt all my bridges behind me. My eyes on the cross, not on things beside me. My Lord, he's the one I want to please. [Music] There is nothing I'd rather be than to be a child of the king. In him I have everything.

We thank you for your great word and the great liberty of your spirit that we feel and we sense. Lord, thank you for all the worship and the singing. Lord, we come now to that moment where our hearts and minds are now ready, made ready and tuned to hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Grant it to us, Lord, that it would be a living word. That as we hear it, Lord, it would take root in our hearts. And from deep within, there would be that amen that says, "Yes, Lord, so be it unto me." May you grant it today, Lord. May you be with the speaker and the hearer. Give us hearing hearts today. We pray. We commit it to you, Lord. That's all we can do. We can prepare. We can come. We can make you welcome. I believe that's happened now, Lord. Now, you come, Father. Without you, Lord, it won't be accomplished. So, we we sense you're already here. And we believe now that you'll bless your word in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Going to invite you to Daniel chapter 12 this morning. And um want to just be remembering those prayer requests. I heard them go out. Amen. Want to trust the Lord that Amen. Ellie, it'll be just fine. And then um I heard that testimony brother Luther gave. And uh so just wonderful. And uh Brother Tony will be heading today to academy. So just be keeping him in prayer, would you? Amen. Praise the Lord. I I know he'll do fine, but Amen. I want the Lord just to let him know he'll do fine. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Matt is away ministering. Brother Brad is away ministering. Want to be in prayer for them today. Amen. You love him. &gt;&gt; What do you need to do next? Turn around, shake hands, say, "God bless you." After 30 years, you already ought to know me by now. Praise the Lord. Daniel chapter 12. while we have you standing. Verse one. And at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which standeth for the children of thy people. &gt;&gt; And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. And at that time thy people shall be delivered. Everyone that shall be found written in the book, and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever. Amen. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. Then I, Daniel, looked, and lo, I'm sorry. Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, this represented the Holy Ghost, the one on the water, "How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?" He's the only one that would know. And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand, and his left hand unto heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and half. And when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. And I heard, but I understood not. Then said I, oh Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end. Many shall be purified and made white and tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand. And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolations desolate setup, there shall be a,290 days. Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the,35 and30 days. But go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of thy days. At the end of the days. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You can be seated. I covet your prayers this morning. We are moving into um a point that is very very dear to me and I I really want to be very clear on it and uh I believe that the Lord will help us. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm quite sure that he will. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me get my ducks in a row here. All right. So, we're reading, of course, about the consummation of all things and and um Daniel is an amazing book. Probably I I think I heard a figure that at more than 3/4 of the book of Revelation quote and or referred directly from the book of Daniel. And so, it is u it is an incredible thing, brother. And he's he's he's hearing about the end of uh his people, the coming of the kingdom. This was always a question. You remember the disciples, people were gathering around Jesus, you know, with the belief that if you be the Messiah, then uh let us make you a king. And Jesus was certainly going to be a king, but all things had to be in the right time sequence. That's a super important point. You can't God don't run ahead of himself. He doesn't allow history or the future to run ahead of his plan. If he does, he will speed up and drop back to adjust. And because the because one of the problems that the Lord runs into is not that nature runs ahead of him, but mankind is always trying to run ahead of him. He started in the Garden of Eden when he tried to run ahead of the plan. And so, we're realizing that God uh makes the adjustment as he goes along. You have to appreciate that prophecy is happening in real time. It's happening right while you live. That's not new. That's not novel or unique. That's the way it's always been. And so as the prophecy unfolded, then it became clear they, you know, you remember brother Brandham would say things like, you know, how that that you know, scholars, they argued over Isaiah's prophecy for more than seven centuries, 712 years to be precise. They argued over what Isaiah's prophecy could mean. a virgin shall conceive. And but brother Brandham would say when God got ready and it wasn't that they didn't have opinions and sermons and doctrines, but when God got ready to actually interpret it himself, he just brought it to pass and the manifestation was the interpretation. Just the same way Mark 16, you know, that the church was given a commission to go into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature. These signs shall follow them that believe and my name they shall cast out devils. They'll lay hands on the sick. See, and they'll recover. And so they argued in this day, what does that mean? How do we interpret that? And brother Brandham, you know, oh, it must have been for a past day. And brother Brandham would just say, look, when when God interprets his word, he interprets it by manifesting it. And so the manifestation is the inarguable interpretation. You can argue all day long with the Greek and the Hebrew and your opinion of this and opinion of that. But in the face of manifestation, all your theory falls down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so this is why we are we are not just, you know, our message to the world is not merely what God has said, but what God has done. &gt;&gt; And not merely what he has done, but what he is doing. &gt;&gt; And what because what he has done has led to what he's doing. and what he's doing will lead to what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; And so I want to know what's happened. I want to know what's happening. And I want to know what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that because we have come to the consummation of the ages. Daniel was told it would be a day like no other. We know the tribulation time will be such a world uh when the world order will collapse. And the world is not ending, just the world order is ending. And I don't want to get sidetracked on that today. I have a sermon I'm working on concerning the world order. We won't get there today, but we realize that that the world is transitioning. And I I hate to use this term because it's been coined in conspiracy theory. Uh but but but it is true. There is coming a new world order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's really not about Illuminati. &gt;&gt; There is a new world order that's actually not just coming. It's already starting to transition and it's already moving in and that is one of the things that was prophesied to happen when the mystery of God would be uh understood at the end time. So, you know, we have an explanation for the madness that we see in the world, the impossibilities that we face in this unprecedented time. You live, and I've said it before, you live in a in an a a a a perverse age the likes of which has have never been faced &gt;&gt; by any age. We have so many things that are unprecedented in human history and I could just say Bible history because Bible history starts with human history and it goes all the way back predates human beings walking on the earth. Of course, Adam was in the in God, but then God put him in the flesh. And the Bible records how it all got started, how it all went wrong, and how God has repaired it, and how he has given a plan of redemption for all for whomsoever would like to have it. Uh salvation can be had by any sincere heart. Now, we know salvation and redemption are are different in some ways. redemption is the next level of of salvation. We know that there will be millions in glory who are saved from destruction, granted eternal life. That's inarguable in the Bible. But we also know that there was a a section in the lamb's book of life of election whose whose members were in God and part of God before the foundation of the world. That is just as inarguable. So we we realize that we are facing a perverse age uh never faced by any age. It's it's it's broken all previous records. We have uh you know Satan. I mean look I I would just say that we are facing an age that was not faced by any of the Old Testament saints including the Anidolivian world. &gt;&gt; Say well but every man's mind was evil continually. Okay I get it. But that was just the days of Noah. But in Abraham's time, he had to face the days of Lot and and Sodomy uh beginning to take root. But our day, we face both of those simultaneously in their &gt;&gt; zenithmen &gt;&gt; globally. &gt;&gt; And so so we realize that it's uh you know even even in the days of Jesus, you face a darker day than the days that Jesus faced. &gt;&gt; I only got sister Jean amening that. Come on. &gt;&gt; You face. You fa Jesus warned the church about the day coming &gt;&gt; and said, you know, in me you'll have tribulation. Here was his words of comfort. Be of good cheer. I've overcome the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so this is why he would implore his church that and he would warn them to say, remember that only in me can you accomplish anything. Now, there's there's people who the world is filled with people who accomplish amazing things. But let me just say it like this. If you want to accomplish something that counts &gt;&gt; eternally, then you better be in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can say, well, I might accomplish getting the whole world. I might accomplish ruling heavens and earth. Heavens and earth will pass away. &gt;&gt; But only the word of God will remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you want to find your place trusting in the word. We face an age worse. It was not faced by Jesus. It was not faced by his disciples. Uh Satan at that time had only had 4,000 years to rebuild his Eden. So, brother Brandon when he comes to Satan's Eden, the God of this evil age, and different messages, and he points uh he says, you know, now just like God took 6,000 years to build his Eden, now Satan's had 6,000 years to build his. So now, uh and then and then he goes into Paul's teaching about how that, you know, there's coming a time, a perilous time, and there's going to be a man of sin revealed, and the end can't come until all that has been manifested. And and so, Brother Brandham goes back to show in in the God of this evil age where Satan would actually accomplish his vision that he had been trying to accomplish for 6,000 years and couldn't get it done until the last day. &gt;&gt; And that is that he would be worshiped like God and he would be the worshiped being. And even to even under such a deception that millions and perhaps billions would sit in Christian churches and worship and believe they're worshiping God and they're actually worshiping Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul referred to him as another Jesus whom we have not preached. And it's a concoction of man-made theory and Satan's right in the middle of it. So, so we realize that we are living in a time and I I want to say this also. We're living in a time far more perverse even than the days of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have now reached a point where Isaiah 60 is fully made manifest. &gt;&gt; That darkness now covers the entire world. Remember that before America rejected the gospel for the last time in 1956, there was still a blessing in light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the gospel had traveled from the east to the west. Once America, the last western culture all the way to the west coast where Isuza fell. After that, you're going to start heading back east again. You're going to find that once that happened and uh Christ was crucified the second time, indicted by a prophet, then Isaiah 60 was in full steam. They had rejected the opening of the seals, which was not knowledge. The opening of the seals was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to want to really remember that. I'm choosing my words with great care today because when you when you when you think of the book and we go to the book of revelation and there's a closed book and there's one they're they're calling let whoever's worthy come and then we find that a worthy one stepped from eternities and took the book. &gt;&gt; You you you need you're going to need to realize that a lot of what John is seeing is in symbol form. So don't don't think of a a leatherbound book filled with paper pages. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon would say Christ broke those seals off of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One place he said he broke them out of himself. &gt;&gt; So we realize that it's and brother Brandham is going to be making it very clear that it's Christ. It's the word. It's the revelation of of Christ &gt;&gt; that had parts of which had been hidden down through the ages only partially revealed until it gets to the end time and the full disclosure &gt;&gt; with everything else that makes now makes sense. Now we understand why they rejected Christ, why it went into Isaiah 60. Now darkness is covering the whole earth. Why a prophet would indict them. Why why in denominationalism that leads to the mark of the beast. Now we understand why that is. You see? So we understand exactly who the man of sin is and we understand exactly what the image to the beast is is. We understand the false prophet the red dragon. We get all of that. We understand the ages. &gt;&gt; See? So so now we're we're we're actually this is why brother Brandon would say you're feeding on the body word not of a man but the body word of the son of man. Because those seals were broken off of him. now. And now you've been called to the feast of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which which if you eat at this feast, you'll eat at that feast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll eat at my father's table. Hallelujah, friends. That's the one I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you are eating your way to a body change to have a body like unto his glorious body. &gt;&gt; So, we see Satan's Eden. We see he's the god of this age. We see darkness around the world. see men's minds uh completely covered over in darkness. But brother Brandham comes here in 1964 and sir, we would see Jesus. Let me have my title slide. Brother Mark, by the way, I'll go ahead and get that up and running and make sure that I'm operational. Turn it off. Turn it on. Okay, I think that should work. Perfect. Okay, so I don't have this quote here on purpose. I just want to read it to you. So now we we talk about how wicked and how dark and how evil we are. And we have a darker day than Jesus had, a darker day than the church through the ages had, a darker day than William Brandham had to experience. But brother Brandham would come around and say, "There is nothing wrong." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is going to turn out all right. &gt;&gt; Don't be scared. I'm so glad. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that after he comes with an indictment and it sounds like it's hopeless. After he preaches souls in prison and scares everybody to death, including his own self, he comes around and says, "Don't be scared. God's big time piece is ticking right along. It'll be there. It'll have a church without spot or wrinkle." It was in his thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we see terrible signs of the time around the world. We've talked about some of them. We've identified events made clear in prophecy that have been in the past. We've talked about the present day. We can we could sit here and I could make this whole thing a a teaching on prophecy about, you know, what are we looking for in the Antichrist and the money and the sellout and the and the and the false prophet, how it's going to take over and how it's going to control this. Uh, you know, I'm not here just to fill you with knowledge today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's not that that'll actually harm you if you don't know the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, George Baros is the Russia team and geospatial intelligence team lead at the Institute for the Study of War. His work focuses on Russian information operations, the Kremlin's operational art and the campaign design in Ukraine and Bellarus, as well as Ukrainian politics. He he himself is uh I believe Ukrainian. He's a he's an expert. He regularly briefs senior military and political decision makers and his work has been featured in various media outlets including the Hill, the Washington Post, the BBC and Routers. He makes this statement very recently in terms of the global situation. I read you his credentials so you know this ain't just somebody in a basement with a YouTube channel, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. in terms of the global situation. We are in a 1937 moment on the global scale. Now that's just as the second woe was starting to ramp up &gt;&gt; and bring Hitler had already been years as chancellor according to prophet's vision and now things are beginning to move forward. And he's he's he's he's juxtaposing World War II with what he believes is about to be World War II. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so he says we have once again come to a moment. We are in a 1937 moment on the global scale. Our adversaries are teaming at the door. They sense blood in the water. They sense opportunity. War is tragic. I when I read this, I just thought, my goodness, war is tragic. I'm sorry. War is a tragic and inevitable part of the human experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are overdue for another big global war. Really? &gt;&gt; This is the man who briefs the military. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This period of 80 years of relative stability and global peace that we have had since 1945 to the present has been an anomaly in the human experience. And we need to prepare for the worstc case scenarios moving into the future. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I read that, I could almost feel nervous for me, for you, for my children. What's the world going to face? But then I come back around and now listen to it again. There is nothing wrong. Everything is going to turn out all right. Don't be scared. God's big time piece is ticking right along. It'll be there. It'll have a church without spot or wrinkle. It was in his thinking. You were in his thinking. I'm in his thinking. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, so, okay. So, we're at a 37 moment and maybe World War II is by 27. Who can say? I don't know. He's not trying to say. But what he is saying is this 80 years, don't get used to it because it's an anomaly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not. It doesn't match history. a friend of mine who's a pastor, very well-known, very good friend of mine, my family. We've we've been discussing for a number of days some things and he told me one time he he I made a statement to him and he told me the next day he said, "Hey buddy," he said the next he said, "I yesterday in the pull pit," he said, "I I unabashedly quoted you verbatim and I didn't even name drop you." He said, "I took all the credit." And so, so I wrote him this morning. I said, "Hey, I'm getting ready to quote you verbatim because the statement you sent to me, I can't improve on it, and I'm pretty good at improving on statements. Writing is what I do best." But I I said, "This this needs no uh no improvement. Listen as I read." He says, "This seventh angel, the messenger to the Leodysian church age, does not come bringing new doctrines. He comes with a restoration of the original faith. &gt;&gt; The faith which was once delivered unto the saints according to Jude 1:3. &gt;&gt; His ministry does not add to Paul's gospel. It restores it. &gt;&gt; He brings back the apostolic message in power and clarity. I'm so glad &gt;&gt; unveiling the mysteries that had been sealed within the book for generations. Yet it is undeniable. This is where this is where our discussion has been. Yet it is undeniable that more has been revealed in this age, not by contradiction to Paul, but as the unfolding of what was already there hidden beneath centuries of creeds and traditions. &gt;&gt; See, so that so so it's a fine line between saying that this message isn't anything new. It's only a restoration of what Paul said, which is a thousand% correct. But at the same time, you're going to understand this morning that God unveils his word. God operates on a need to know basis. &gt;&gt; And he unveils his word according to the time and the season. You understand? &gt;&gt; So, so, so we find that you can go back to Paul, but you don't find Paul teaching on Daniel 70 weeks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? It wasn't relative to them. You don't find Paul even talking that brother Brandham said that the all I mean all the gospel is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Is that what the Bible says? &gt;&gt; But you don't find them talking about the seven church ages. And even when John comes with it in a book, it's all sealed and nobody even knows what it means. And brother Brandham said God wouldn't let them know &gt;&gt; that there was going to be 2,000 years and seven ages and he wasn't coming imminently because that would have destroyed their expectancy and their zeal. You understand? So God wouldn't even let them know that. And so at the end time now that it's relevant now a prophet comes and goes back to cover things Paul never needed to cover. &gt;&gt; We've come through seven ages and it went into the dark ages and it came out under Luther Wesley. It's the restoration of the bride. They never knew the bride tree was going in the earth, going into the ground. They never knew it was going to die and be buried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, they were certainly on their way to the rapture. They had the abstract title. They had the token. They had the ministry of the son of man. They had the perfect word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were on their way, but that church backslid as the apostles died away. It backslid. And we find then that that that that the church backslid. And then history goes along and now it's ages and now there's seven messengers. And no one knew that seven spirits of God or the seven human messengers sent into the church in each age. Wait, huh? What? What? What did you say about an age? A messenger? A spirit? Huh? What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you I if if you would go back there and preach this kind of reality that's true cuz we know it's happened. They would go, "What are you talking about?" All right. &gt;&gt; We just heard the apostles say, "He that's coming will not tarry." You're talking 20 centuries minimally. &gt;&gt; And in fact is we're going to be in the 21st century after you. And it's still not happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so you have to realize then that it's not But here's here's the beauty of it. This is why you don't hear the Apostle Paul quoting from the book of Revelation because he was already dead and gone when John comes back with it. So the mysteries are starting to be sealed up more and more and more down through the ages. You can go all the way into Iranius and you still find the truth of the godhead. Perfect. Brother Ram said he was the last one. &gt;&gt; He had a clear understanding of the godhead. And then after that, by the time you get to Martin, it's already faded. Then Colombia, it's way faded. And then after Colombia, you're going into the dark ages in 606 because now it wasn't just na at 3:25. Uh that's where that was that that the whole thing was spawned. But it actually took till 606 until finally they crown a false prophet, set him on a throne at the seat of Jezebel. And now and now you go into a thousand years of dark ages. &gt;&gt; And not until Luther comes along with a single revelation. You know how he caught that revelation? A seal partially opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And dropped a mystery and a messenger caught it. The early church wouldn't have understood that kind of lingo. &gt;&gt; But here's the beauty of it. When a prophet comes and preaches the opening of the seals, everything he preaches agrees with everything Paul taught. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we have a more sure word of prophecy. Just like Peter could say, the you guys, you Jews, y'all understood that Messiah was coming and you had a word of prophecy that he was coming. Well, guess what? We've had the word of the prophecy made more sure to us cuz we know he came. &gt;&gt; See, so they had all that prophecy, but today you have a more sure word of prophecy than the early church had. You get that? Does that make sense to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a We didn't need an eighth age or an eighth messenger to tell us these things. It's just recognizing where we are in prophecy, where we are and what God has done in this hour. And the only messenger after Elijah was you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in the bride &gt;&gt; is the final voice. &gt;&gt; So he goes on, my friend, yet it is undeniable that more has been revealed in this age, not by contradiction to Paul, but as the unfolding of what was already there, hidden beneath centuries of creeds and traditions. We now understand the seven church ages and their messengers. We've been shown the mystery of the Antichrist spirit working through the ages. The man of sin, the beast, the false prophet, things that had not yet occurred in Paul's day, but which the spirit had made known has made known in this final hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, they were prophesied. Jesus prophesied about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was in the book of Revelation, but it was all hidden under mystery. &gt;&gt; You follow that? See, now you can say, "Well, maybe Paul knew more than we realized. Maybe he did &gt;&gt; if he knew. He didn't say &gt;&gt; if he knew about the ages. He was caught up to the third heaven. &gt;&gt; He was caught. He saw what John saw in the throne room. And he said, he said, "There's things I heard I can't even repeat. It's not even lawful to repeat." See? &gt;&gt; So, so, so if he knew, he didn't say. Brother Ram said, "God don't always tell his prophets everything, and his prophets don't always tell the people everything." &gt;&gt; So, so that that's really not not the point. The point is now that the book has been unsealed. So he says, "So, uh, but now through the ministry of the seventh angel, the seals have been, or wait a minute, down through the ages, that antichrist spirit steadily closed the book, wrapping the truth in layers of man-made theology. But now, and it finally led to the dark ages. But now through the ministry of the seventh angel, and I might add, through the ministry of the fifth and sixth and seventh angel, because that's where the restoration began. But now through the to to the culmination of it, we find that through the ministry of the seventh angel, the seals have been loosed. The book has been unsealed. And we've been brought back not to something new, but to what Paul had, the original word, restored and revealed in its fullness. &gt;&gt; We have returned to the land, I love this. We have returned to the land of the Bible, to the landmarks of truth that Paul laid down. Not one word added, not one word taken away. The same gospel, the same mysteries, no longer hidden in shadow, but shining in the full light of this bright age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just say amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We've learned in our series about an intrinsic nature uh that li that comes from God that is in his offspring. You, you know, and brother Brandon would use the natural typing, the spiritual. There are so many things that the older I get, the more I remind my own self of my dad. I didn't used to see that when I was younger, I thought I was so much more handsome than him that I but but but these days, you know, and sister Debbie doesn't help matter. She's all the time going, "You're just like your daddy." Now, she's meaning it as a compliment, not as an insult. And I'm going, "Wow, really? Thank you." It puts a smile on my face. Sometimes I'll catch myself sitting with my hands a certain gesture or I'll be sitting eating thinking and I'll be doing the same expression he was doing. So it's it's intrinsic to me. It's innate. I got it from him. It's a passed down thing. You understand? So, we realize then, as I said to you in a previous uh installment, Brother Brandon would show us that in order to get the understanding of the water baptism, all you need to be able to do is read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even require a revelation if you can just read. And that's read the Bible and read history or put them together. They all declare the same thing. And he and he goes on to talk about the original sin of the serpent's seed. And brother Brandon would say a 12-year-old child could understand it. It's so clear. And it is. And we've proven how clear it is. And so we've did that publicly. And so, but now when it comes to the Godhead, even when you it's so um it's so vast a topic that even within the revelation, a mystery remains. See, now that's that's a Scofield statement that brother Brandham endorsed and repeated that even he read it from Scofield's notes and and he endorsed it on on tape. So even within the mystery, that's how amazing it is. That's why we can never fully grasp the the book of life on this side cuz that's on that side. It's in another realm and it's the God's person. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So it requires revelation to even get to the level of understanding that will give you redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there because you have to have that to in order to come to redemption because that's the requirement of this age. It wasn't in the other ages. Christ was in the eternities winking at their ignorance. They didn't understand that. Luther didn't understand it. Wesley didn't. Many of the Isuza fathers. Great men of God. I think of Wigglesworth. What a great man of God. So powerful and yet prayed to a thrice god. I think of Arthur Pink, a beautiful mind. No, I mean, so so astute in the word of God and yet prayed to the thrice God. &gt;&gt; I think of I think of Spurgeon and all these different ones and they didn't understand these not three people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and brother Brandham was coming in the last day because the open door was set between the end of the sixth and opening of the seventh and it was going to be a restoration of the deity of Jesus Christ. That's why I believe the first sermon we have recorded is 1949, the deity of Jesus Christ. And so, Brother Brandon would not just show that he's one. That's not what the seventh seal stopped at. That's because the oneness understood. Now, they had a misunderstanding of how he's one and and and and so brother Brandon would say, "Well, the oneness are wrong and the trinitarians are wrong." But but what came to us under the seventh seal was the true revelation of how he's one by expression. He keeps expressing himself in new forms. It doesn't make him multiple people. It's just God changing his mask. And the beauty of it was that just like Christ came out of God, he was the word and that word was made flesh. And then that word, the life in that word now lives in us. And now the bride becomes part of the godhead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the seventh seal broke to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you are actually part of. And brother Brandham uses that kind of language in a number of places. How that we're literally we're literally seen in the in the trinity in the in the three uh father, son, and holy ghost. That's right on tape. And that brother Brandon would talk about any son and daughter of God that's born again of the spirit of God that you are in Godhead. You are in God's godhead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the beauty. That's what that's what separates us. We're not we're not following cunningly devised tales. We never followed a man. We're not feeding on a man. We we it the Godhead has been revealed to us and we found out he's always been the word and I've always been a part of that and that's why I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I can't not believe it. &gt;&gt; See, so the only way re we can receive the revelation of the Godhead is because we are a part of the Godhead. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the revelation of it is intrinsic to you being of a gene of God. &gt;&gt; This is why those whose names are not in the section of election can never catch the full revelation of any age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever at whatever level it was, you had to be part of that original fabric of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. So its truth then is intrinsic to us as after the new birth and it becomes self-evident at our conversion because it gives us a real and life-changing experience. And if it doesn't give you a real life-changing experience and it hasn't become a revelation to you yet. &gt;&gt; It's not to insult you. That's to help you. &gt;&gt; See, so this is why brother Brandon would say we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth. This is why you're an alien. This is why you live in a world you seem unfitted to live in. &gt;&gt; Here's why. Um, in Revelation 15:3 it says, "And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints." The lamb, the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty. Now, I'm not sure how I didn't get it this little last sentence in here. I I think I was transitioning between screens. It's not here. But he goes on to say, he says, um, "His blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty." That is his present office. That is what he's doing now, pleading his blood for our sins. So don't let somebody tell you that because the seals are open and the presence of Christ is among us that we no longer have an advocate. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because this is what he's doing now. &gt;&gt; See, and I get that someday we won't need an advocate. But I'm sure glad I got one right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But one day the lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah. They say, "Well, I thought he was already John turned to see a lion and he saw a lamb. I thought the lion has already stepped forward." You understand? John is seeing symbols. And God is is going to play it out in time. You can't get too transfixed on the symbol and and and mess up your whole picture. You've got to take the whole flow of revelation. Watch. But one day the lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah. See that means he'll he is already the lamb. But that's not in effect yet to the Gentiles because we're still here. &gt;&gt; You understand? He is the l the lion. But right now he's a lamb interceding for you and I. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; All right. He is he is the coming king. I'm sorry. But one day the lamb will become the line of the tribe of Judah. That means in effect he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign as king. And see this is all in the millennium. He's coming king of the earth. Of course that does not say he is not king. Now you see how that goes back and forth. For he is our king, king of saints right now. It is a spiritual kingdom. You following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not of this world even as we are not of this world. That's the reason we act different from the world. Our citizenship is in heaven. We're nothing but a cult. &gt;&gt; Did I read that wrong? &gt;&gt; Our That's the reason we act different from the world. Our citizenship is in heaven. And we have a a stringent list of dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; If you make a mistake, we'll put you out of the message. It is not of this world the spiritual kingdom even as we are not of this world. That's the reason we act different from the world. Our citizenship is in heaven. We reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where Jesus is the king already. &gt;&gt; I'm sitting together in heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "This is why there here there here's the reason. This is why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much. That is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin." Here's why. Our dominion is the dominion over sin. And it is enforced through the power that is that is the spirit of Christ that indwells us. Every kingdom on earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham comes now to we've been studying a lot from who is this Melzdc. You still with me? &gt;&gt; All right. I'm doing good on time. I I'm going to make my mark today. It's going to be perfect. So he says, I won't get to everything I wanted to, but that's okay. I can see where I'm going to get. So he says, now we find him at the beginning, his attributes, and now this is what we've been taking service after service to drill into us. And now you were with him then. Then then is when the book of life comes into view. Then now he's talking about about God's person, how that you are in him. And now we're talking about the book of life. All right? Now remember, not a leather bound with paper pages. The the the mystery is Christ. He broke the seals off of himself. You understand? So it's not a leather bound book with paper pages. Remember, John is seeing symbols. So, brother Brandham, you know, and and and he and I've already told you the quote about breaking them off himself and even from within himself. So, so you don't So, let me just say the reason I'm emphasizing that is to say because of what it actually is, then you don't get to pick and choose when the book is sealed or open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so it's it's been it's been closed and opened at various levels down through the ages. Let me point out to you that Christ began revealing parts of his mystery to Abel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right out of the garden. &gt;&gt; See, he went on from there to reveal himself to Enoch. He went right on there to reveal himself to Noah. He went right on from there to reveal himself to Abraham. And he and he goes on to pick up Moses. And then he says to Moses, "You're knowing me in a way Abraham didn't. I don't I wasn't known but to him by his Jehovah Gyra, even though he knew that's who I was. That's not how we rolled. That's not how I operated. But now I've got a family. I'm going to lead you out of Egypt in a first Exodus. There's going to be three of them. And the third one's going to take my gentile bride home to glory. &gt;&gt; The second one is going to lift him up out of a grave. and all those who died in faith are going to rise with him and empty out paradise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he goes on to reveal himself to Abraham on and on and on. Then to the Jews he further reveals himself as Jesus. And then to the world he reveals himself through his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand the plan was never for Jesus to get resurrected and go back to walking the shores of Galilee. Right. &gt;&gt; The plan was that I'll be with you, even in you, and that you will go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, &gt;&gt; Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the earth. Then when this gospel has been preached in all the earth, the end will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, they didn't know it would be seven ages, but it would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so, so it negates the question then. It it it totally makes a mood point of the question, was the book sealed to Paul? That's a mood point, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It completely negates that question because we're not talking about a leatherbound book. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the revelation of Almighty God revealing himself in stages down through the ages. See, &gt;&gt; so none of the mystery of Christ I can tell you this that none of the mystery of Christ say, "Well, okay. Well, did then maybe Paul didn't understand Daniel 70 weeks. Maybe he didn't understand." I think Paul understood a lot more than we give him credit for. He understood the rapture in three phases. He understood who was Melzdc. And he had way more to say about Melzdc than he could write. He said, "I have much more to say, but you've already become dull of hearing." &gt;&gt; He already understood that the rapture can't come till the man of sin be revealed. &gt;&gt; You understand? He knew he was a false prophet. Jesus had said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so you but but here here's the bottom line. None of the mystery of Christ that was needed for his day, nor anything that would be necessary for redemption was ever hidden to Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing. He had the gospel of redemption for God's people that we are still reading from and standing on and basing every doctrine we have based on what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So yeah, and and not even in the ages. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because even even in the ages, the seals were being cracked open, partially open to release a mystery down to messengers in each age to give that age what was necessary. Not more, but just what was necessary for that age. &gt;&gt; You got that? &gt;&gt; See, because it because what did you say? Necessary for what? Necessary, you know, so that they could so that they could uh be happy. The word in every age brought enough to enough necessary revelation for them to come to their pre-ordained uh order in God. &gt;&gt; Everything that Christ had saw in position, John saw it. Oh my goodness, friends. And everything that God's family has ever been ordained to come to as a position in God, he's given it. And today, we have all that he's ever opened to this point. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this bride has to come to her position also as the final voice. So how could she do that if he's hidden part of the word from her? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so brother Brandon would would say, uh, let me see. Do I want to read? No, not not yet. All right. So I I didn't put this one up. Here is a questions and answers 1963. So now he says, "Brother Brown, I'm talking about this book." He says, "The book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it." Now, now watch what he says. He said, "Brother Jason thought, you said it's not a leatherbound book." Hold on. The book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now. Not each one's name, &gt;&gt; but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names. Amen. &gt;&gt; So even the names were not being called out as a list of names, but the mystery of of God was unfolding to God's family, revealing to them that they were part of the mystery that it was being revealed to them in their age, in the age that they lived in. The fact that it's revealed to you proves you're in the book. You're on the roll. &gt;&gt; You say, "So, so there is a book. There's certainly a record in heaven. The Bible says in the book of Revelation, the book of life was open. The books are open. Not saying there's not a book. There's not a record. There's not a role. I'm trying to get you to understand and look beyond the symbol. This was not a some leather bound book that Christ had on this one. This messenger didn't have it and this one did. It's all been the unfolding mystery all down through the Old Testament and in the New Testament to the very hour we and I, you and I live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at whatever level it was being revealed was always the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so you're not merely being identified in the eternal record of heaven, but you are yourself. You are I want to say this very carefully. You are yourself a an unfolding revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm say it again. You're not merely being identified in the record of heaven. More than that, you are in and of yourself an unfolding revelation of the eternal word, which is Christ in you, overcoming this impossible darkness. &gt;&gt; And if you didn't have it and didn't have faith in, didn't have a revelation of it, you would never overcome this impossible darkness because it's impossible. It's not because you're a great person. It's not because you got great strength, but because God has declared it in his word. He's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle. And she'll believe his word. And I just say, "Amen, Lord. Nothing in my arms I bring. Simply to thy cross I cling." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so I love I love when brother Tony sings, "It's already done from Sister Brenda." Love that. It's already done. &gt;&gt; The battle is over. &gt;&gt; The victory is won. It's already done. Why? because it was done in Christ before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Daniel until the time of the end &gt;&gt; or until the ending of Christ's mediation. You understand? For the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; All right. So it was not that the revelation of God's mystery would never be known until the end time. As I said, he started giving that revelation to Abel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, so it's not that the that the revelation of God's mystery would never be known until the end time. He certainly kept revealing himself to humanity long after Daniel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was revealing himself long after Daniel. And it wasn't yet yet the end time. So you see, it's a progressive process that God is doing. It it's always been it's not about that. It's not about, you know, was it to Daniel? Is it the end time? Nobody can know. It's not about that. It's always been about the word of God coming forth to live in the lives of his offspring. And they were they would be dispersed across all the Old Testament and New Testament ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was always the revelation was not about knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was always coming forth to live in the lives of his offspring. So, it's not merely about secret knowledge or even primarily that cuz listen, knowledge puffs up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowledge fuels pride. And that's why seeking knowledge without a new birth is always a train wreck. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be a train wreck for you if you don't get the new birth and try to seek after knowledge. That's partly what's been responsible for the nonsense that's went on in so-called message camps. They don't been message camps. They've been man-made man-made camps. He only has one camp and that's gathered the eagles gathered around his carcass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham says in things that are to be, he had showed the people and proved to them that he was Jehovah manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a quote. Now, go with me to, you know, we're going to turn, but you're it's familiar to you. Matthew 24 and Jesus is telling about what's coming. Now, they didn't they still didn't know it's going to be 2,000 years. It's going to go across time, across seven ages. But he's he's giving them information. &gt;&gt; He's giving them knowledge. He's giving them some insider trading secrets. &gt;&gt; You see, and so, so, but in Jesus in Matthew 24, here's my question to you today. in his in his Matthew 24 discourse, which do you imagine was more important? Jesus a Jesus dropping hints and knowledge about the coming ages? Remember, you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you've been remember that &gt;&gt; and and whi which is more important Jesus dropping knowledge and hence about the coming ages or that he was Jehovah manifested in the flesh? That's what brother Brandham said. He come to prove that he was Jehovah. Man, what good would it do you to go to his services and hear his preaching and even say amen and get all excited if you didn't believe that he was Jehovah manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so the revelation then of the mystery is about the manifestation of the living word living behind living skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; The great mystery of God manifesting himself through his redeemed family. I &gt;&gt; want to say it again. The revelation of the mystery is about the manifestation of the living word living behind living skin. Amen. &gt;&gt; And every age that followed the word that had it revealed from Abel to now, they were an event made clear in prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They themselves were the event made clear in prophecy. It was never about knowledge. It was about a living God living his life behind living skin in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so they they always they had always been an event made clear by prophecy. It's how God calls his family from among the dying to to to live among the living in their own modern day. In their own modern day, now your own modern day. He's called you from dying to living. He's called you from darkness to light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he, as I said earlier, he he manifest he unfolds prophecy and manifestation on a need to know basis. I want to finish this before I may not get back to my quotes or I might. It looks like I might, but it's all right. So now let me just give you some more examples. I've already given you a number of them. All right. I said, "We have all the knowledge revealed to date." Well, there are parts of the seven trumpets that we still don't understand. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because it doesn't apply to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's on a need to know basis. We know parts of it. God revealed parts of it. I can go back and see the trumpets and the vials. We've preached on that and show show how it's been unfolding through history. The trumpets have unfolded in Jewish history just like the seals unfolded in Gentile history. See, &gt;&gt; and God was was opening temporary plagues on the earth the same way he was opening temporarily seals. &gt;&gt; You understand? Partial partial. But in the tribute, but at the end time, all the seals have been made known. And now we're ready for tribulation. And all of those bowls, all of those vials are going to be poured out in the tribulation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there are questions we have concerning the appearance of Moses and Elijah and how it'll all unfold and what it will all look like. See, we don't know. We don't know how what that'll all look like. We know they're coming. &gt;&gt; I know the bride's leaving. &gt;&gt; I know Moses and Elijah are going to them. Are they there? Are they not? Is it the literal? Is it men? We don't know. Brother Bam didn't know. He had an opinion. &gt;&gt; We've got opinions. It's It's not relevant to your redemption because it doesn't apply to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's what applies to you. If you want to hear come up, make sure you hear come out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't apply to us. So, we only have a partial understanding. You say, "Well, how and how will it be made known?" It'll be made known as it is manifested. See, &gt;&gt; some things occur within the beast system controlling the world economy that we don't have a clear picture of. All we have the best we have is prophetic surmising. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham admits to that. He says, you know, the the Rome will make a deal with the Wall Street Jews and then in the midst of it, they'll break that covenant. We're long gone. Thank God. &gt;&gt; And they'll break that covenant. And then later on in cood they ask him brother Brandham where in the scripture you were saying that there's a a deal made between the Rome and the Jews and where is that? And brother Brandham says his answer is very unambiguous. He says well I don't have an exact scripture for that. He said but but based on everything I do see that's what I believe it will be. I can't think it could be any other way. &gt;&gt; So it's still it's that's just a prophetic surmising. You understand it wasn't necessary. And if he ever did know, he didn't need to tell us or we would know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? So you don't So I'm I'm I'm saying all this so you don't get trapped in that question was, you know, is was the word sealed to Paul? Was it not open to Paul? It was open long before Paul. And it's open to Paul and through the ages and today. And all it is is a continual. Was it was it sealed off from the ages? Almost all of it was. Every time it got another age, it got more and more sealed. More and more sealed. until it went into complete dark ages until God cracked open another seal and sent Luther to the earth with a revelation and that began to restore the bride tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're you and I are at the long tail end of a restoration message. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so some things that occur on the world economy, I know we I know I know this. I know when they can't buy nor sell except you have that mark. I know we're already gone then. See, so it's not relevant to us because why? Why is that not relevant to me, Brother Jason? I should worry about it right now. I should go build a bunker and fill it full of canned goods. I should get nine rifles and three handguns and be prepared. Well, if you plan to miss the rapture, I would advise you to do all of the above. But I don't plan to need that or be here. I'm I've come out, so I'm coming up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, whatever happens in the tribulation is not relevant to me. That's only relevant to Lot's children. Lot's children will manifest that in the tribulation. Not Abraham's children. The Abraham's children leave prior to that in the third Exodus. Glory to God. I say, Lord, come quickly. Lord Jesus, I'm so ready to depart this mad world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, stop thinking of it as a mere book. I'm not suggesting there's not a record in heaven. But don't just merely get locked down to this. It's a it's a leatherbound book and is it open or is it not open? Was it open? Was it not open? &gt;&gt; So, you know, you got to stop thinking of it as a book. I mean, look, friends, that you've got your Bible, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Is this a book? Sure. &gt;&gt; But this wasn't even his first Bible. &gt;&gt; It wasn't even his second Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The stars were his first. Enoch's pyramid was his second. This is the third iteration. And I'm gonna tell you something. There's coming a day when he'll have another Bible. And it'll be you. It won't be this. When the books are closed for the last time, the word will be flesh. &gt;&gt; You will be the word of God. You are already being turned into that. &gt;&gt; See, he will have another Bible and it'll be you and you'll be the last one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A kingdom of saints. And I'm glad my Bible says that's an everlasting kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm done. Stand up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was going to bravely go trudging forward, but I see my time and I I I there's so much more I want to continue to say. I don't want you to get over sponge. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, brother Kenny. Come. Amen. Have a song or two for us. Oh friends, what a privilege that we have for the things that God has shown us in this hour. So I, you know, I I want you to fully grasp I th this series I'll have probably have at least one more part, maybe two more parts at best. And so that would be part nine and part 10. Uh, come on. Oh. Oh, sorry, Mace. You want Mace to play? You want to get on the Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's do that. Amen. Give this young man some practice. Amen. Make use of that nice haircut. Praise the Lord. I need you on the base anyway, big dog. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can't believe how famous brother Aaron is around the world. We were in Poland and they literally have almost uh made a carbon copy. They even have the picture like that. I was telling the brother, I said, "Brother, you got the same picture we've got." He goes, "Yes, brother." uh embarrassed to say we kind of copy everything you do. They they they they've even got it arranged like this. They've got, you know, all of these musicians. They got a they got a big guy with a beard on bass. They got piano players. They got uh drummers. Except it ain't quite that. It's the kind that you see Chris sometimes in the fellowship all sit on and plays, you know, beating it between his legs. And uh and the only thing they don't have, Sister Ruth, they don't have a black organist, but they have a white girl who's a cello cello player. Well, you play the cello. Okay. Oh, you don't? How fast can you learn? And and then literally when you if you pan my video, it goes across and they've even got a John Linichek in the corner on a guitar. It was complimentary and funny at the same time. Amen. Oh, I love to be part of the family of God. Don't you friends? &gt;&gt; It's worth it, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's worth believing. Let's go sing, Brother Kenneth. Oh, let's do it, brother. Amen. That's a good song for you. Finish a sermon like this. Amen. Give us the words. &gt;&gt; Test, test, test. I don't know if this is on. &gt;&gt; It's all you, brother Ken. Okay, you better get a mic that works. There you go. All right. Give him the white one, Jackson. King of glory.

I just want to be with you. &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you. I just wanna be with you. &gt;&gt; Just play that softly for me, Debb. Let's bow our heads. Master, &gt;&gt; you are indeed the king of glory. You're our king. You're our coming king, but you're our king right now. You're a king of this spiritual kingdom of which we are members, Lord, and very happily so. We thank you today for your word, Lord, for your revealed word to us. It's been very real, very moving. We see ourselves Lord clearly. We want to be in position. We want to be in the right time, the right place, saying, feeling, doing, thinking the right things. Everything in our lives, Lord, that is unpleasing to you, may you take it away, Lord. We could not possibly hear a sermon like today and realize this lofty position of your bride and and have any notion to hold on to the things of the world. May it not be. May it never be. Go today with us, Lord, as we get ready to depart. We continue to sing and praise you. But Lord, let the let the work of the Holy Spirit now do that thing that only you can do. Do that thing, Holy Spirit, which you do so well. Lord, even when words of preachers and friends and family, and even when a manifested life right in front of somebody, even that's not sufficient. They can hear the word preached. The the Bible says their sound went into all the earth. Have they not heard? Yay, they've heard the sound went into all the earth. But with some of them he was not well pleased for they heard but they did not believe. They did not mix it with faith. Lord I pray that be nobody of Bethl Tabernacle. May we all mix our faith with your word so that it can become a living life Lord and we can daily daily and daily and every day coming. However many days we have left we can surrender more and more to the vision of your word for our lives. I pray you grant it. Lord, someday every man will bow as the song sings that we're singing. Someday every man. It's not a question of of if. It's only a question of when and where. Lord, let us bow now while there's mercy. Let us bow before the throne of your word where you are seated Lord as king. Father, I pray that every word of God would be yay and amen in our hearts today as take the people from here Lord and may you continue to grow them. Speak to them. speak to them about things that I can't know, Lord. Things about their life, things that only you and they know, Lord God. And they and and maybe if they're anything like me, they've got areas in their life they'd like to see more victory. If they're anything like me, they often have to turn around like Paul and repent and die daily. Lord, I pray that you'll give us courage to just keep going forward and die daily as I have to die and surrender as I need to surrender and accept your word for my life. Lord, may you grant it. May you be the king of glory. May you be the king in my life that brings that my life might bring you glory. We love you. We thank you for it Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You love him. &gt;&gt; King of gloryy. Oh fill this place. I just want to be with you. Yes Lord. I just want to be with you. &gt;&gt; King of glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; King of glory, fill this place. I just want to be with you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you. &gt;&gt; Lift your voices. King of glory. King of God. May God bless this place. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you. I just want to be with you. Yes. The world will bow down and say you are God. [Music] Every man will bow down and say you are king. So let's start right now. Why would we wait? King of glory fill this place. Just want to be with you. I just wanna be with you.
