[8:36] [Music]
[8:38] All right, let's um you all can be
[8:42] seated momentarily. I'm going to um
[8:44] Brother Luther, if you make your way,
[8:46] I'm going to read some prayer requests
[8:47] and then uh we'll stand and pray over
[8:50] the tithes and the offerings. Um have
[8:53] several here that I from the uh various
[8:57] people.
[8:58] Um, this is uh from Sister Meredith
[9:02] says, "Um, uh, I wonder if we could have
[9:04] the church pray tomorrow for brother
[9:06] Emanuel Wade, Martha Ward's dad. He has
[9:09] a pretty significant gastrointestinal
[9:11] bleed that he was hospitalized for and
[9:13] has left him very weak. He is home now.
[9:15] He asked that the church be praying for
[9:17] him to regain strength and for complete
[9:19] healing."
[9:21] Um, so we want to remember that. Um
[9:25] uh this is from uh brother Jeremiah
[9:27] Bray. Um prayer request for my dad. He
[9:30] was taken to the emergency room last
[9:32] night due to discomfort in his chest.
[9:34] He's fine now, but turns out he had a
[9:37] mini heart attack and a blocked artery.
[9:39] They put a stent in and he's in the
[9:41] hospital being watched for um for a day
[9:45] before he's released. We're praying God
[9:48] would put a stop to that right there. We
[9:51] believe that.
[9:53] Um and then finally uh from sister
[9:56] Melissa. Good uh morning. I have two
[9:57] prayer requests for this uh for this
[10:00] morning. One is for the for a situation
[10:02] concerning my daughter Nicole. She's
[10:04] asking for prayer. The other is that
[10:06] this week my class will will take their
[10:08] final math test for the year. I pray
[10:11] that each student show uh shows abundant
[10:14] growth. Thank you, Sister Melissa. So we
[10:17] want to uh keep that all of those in
[10:19] prayer. Um and uh we'll have the the
[10:24] offering.
[10:27] Bless you, brother.
[10:30] Let's all stand.
[10:33] Amen. I'd like to just um welcome all
[10:37] our visitors and pray that you have
[10:41] a good time and that the one we all
[10:43] seek, serve, that he would touch your
[10:46] heart this morning.
[10:48] bring you to that place that
[10:51] my every human being hungers and thirst
[10:54] for that righteousness of God. Amen.
[10:56] Pray that he would bless you today.
[10:59] Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you
[11:02] this morning. I'm so thankful, Father,
[11:06] that you went to that cross with me in
[11:08] mind. And each one here, Father, may
[11:12] that thought be in their hearts that you
[11:15] went for them. Father, let it be a
[11:18] personal communication, a personal
[11:20] relationship between you and them. We
[11:23] pray that you would have your way in the
[11:24] service this morning. Father,
[11:27] we remember Emanuel Wade, Lord.
[11:31] Father, we just pray in the name of
[11:33] Jesus Christ for that same atonement
[11:36] bought our healing, dear God. And we
[11:38] pray for Jeremiah Bray's
[11:41] dad. Father, so thankful that nothing
[11:44] more serious happened, but we pray as he
[11:47] prayed and asked that would be the end
[11:49] of that. Father, touch his body, heal
[11:51] him fully. And Lord, as we um remember
[11:56] Melissa's special request
[11:58] concerning her, a friend of her daughter
[12:02] Nicole's.
[12:05] Father, touch him, Lord. Heal him,
[12:08] Father.
[12:09] And all of these students,
[12:12] each one, even ones in her, not in her
[12:15] grade,
[12:17] want to come around and just
[12:20] share in the love that she has for the
[12:21] children. Father,
[12:24] I know the work that she's put into it,
[12:26] Father,
[12:27] and Lord, they have responded in kind. I
[12:31] pray that you would touch each and
[12:32] everyone. Bless the testing, Father.
[12:36] And Lord, as we approach the word of God
[12:38] this evening,
[12:40] each day is a testing time in our lives.
[12:44] And Lord, as we know the minister will
[12:46] come,
[12:48] he'll stand here, but that gift inside,
[12:50] Father,
[12:52] Lord, that he has just to step out of
[12:55] the way and allow it to have
[12:56] preeminence.
[12:58] And as a congregation this morning, help
[13:02] us to pull on that gift. Father,
[13:05] we all want you, Father, to look beyond
[13:07] the man down to our hearts
[13:10] and our intentions. May we look at each
[13:13] other the same way. As we collect the
[13:16] tithes and offerings, I pray that you
[13:18] bless the cheerful giver. Lord, we
[13:20] surrender our lives to you in Jesus
[13:22] Christ's name. Amen.
[13:25] [Music]
[13:31] Um, God bless you friends. You can take
[13:34] your seats. Um want to have a time for
[13:37] some a special brother Donald Jackson
[13:39] would come up. Understand he has a
[13:42] special song for us and um we'll have uh
[13:46] a few specials after that.

[13:57] willing to
[13:59] uh seeing specials, especially when I
[14:02] got a lot on my plate for Sunday school
[14:04] and leading worship.
[14:08] Amen.

[18:36] [Music]
[18:47] [Music]
[18:52] His
[18:56] [Music]
[19:11] ways are mysterious,
[19:16] but his word is just.
[19:19] [Music]
[19:21] Sometimes he giveth
[19:25] and he takes away.
[19:30] When my fears arise
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] and sorrow covers
[19:41] me,
[19:43] still I will say,
[19:47] "Be it unto me."
[19:54] Even when I cannot see.
[19:58] [Music]
[20:01] Something rises up in me.
[20:05] I say be it unto me.
[20:10] Help cometh from the Lord.
[20:14] I'll trust him even more.
[20:19] I have to say
[20:22] be it onto me.
[20:27] [Music]
[20:33] Thy kingdom come,
[20:38] thy will be done
[20:42] on earth as it is
[20:46] in heaven.
[20:49] [Music]
[20:51] I walk in rightuousness.
[20:59] Order my footsteps
[21:06] and I will say
[21:09] be it unto me.
[21:16] Even when I cannot see,
[21:20] [Music]
[21:23] something rises up in me.
[21:27] I say be it unto me.
[21:31] Help cometh from the Lord.
[21:36] I'll trust him even more.
[21:40] I have to say
[21:43] be it unto me.
[21:52] Even when I cannot see,
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] something rises up in me.
[22:02] I say be it unto me.
[22:06] Help cometh from the Lord.
[22:11] I'll trust him even more.
[22:15] If my heart is broken,
[22:19] my eyes are stayed on him.
[22:23] If I search for something more,
[22:27] he's all my heart longs for.
[22:32] I have to say
[22:36] be it unto me.
[22:41] I have to say
[22:44] be it unto me.
[22:47] [Music]
[22:56] [Applause]
[23:02] really appreciated that. Um, let's all
[23:07] stand. We're going to get ready to
[23:10] change the order of the service. Um, I
[23:12] had this song on my heart really, really
[23:14] strong this morning
[23:16] and um

[23:22] to that? Okay. Well, we don't have
[23:24] lyrics, but they're not that
[23:25] complicated, and you can do your best to
[23:29] sing along. I think many of you know it.
[23:31] I know we've pro I think you sing this
[23:32] as a special at least once, right? Um,
[23:35] but I had this on my heart and I really
[23:37] wanted to sing it and um I'm sure if we
[23:39] don't have lyrics, you can pick it up
[23:41] pretty quick. Um
[23:43] [Music]
[23:47] there was no crown
[23:51] for him of silver or
[23:57] of gold. There was no diet
[24:03] for him to hold,
[24:08] but blood adorned
[24:12] his brow and proud it stay
[24:18] and sinners gave
[24:22] to him crown.
[24:25] [Music]
[24:27] A rugged cross
[24:31] [Music]
[24:32] became his throne.
[24:38] Kingom.

[28:24] Thank you Jesus.
[28:35] and wore the Lord
[28:40] upon
[28:41] him. Amen. You're thankful for that
[28:45] sacrifice. Why don't we give the Lord
[28:46] Jesus a hand? Amen. He's worthy of our
[28:49] worship.
[28:51] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Ephesians chapter
[28:53] 4. If you have your Bible, we'll turn
[28:55] there to into the book of Romans,
[28:56] chapter 2. I'm sorry, chapter 12. Amen.
[28:59] God bless you. So good to be here. Amen.
[29:02] With you in the house of the Lord. Amen.
[29:05] I I just uh want to say this morning
[29:07] that my dad is away at brother Blues
[29:10] this morning. His brother Blues church,
[29:11] I should say. And for those of you that
[29:14] don't know, brother Maurice is um
[29:16] becoming the p being elected as the
[29:18] pastor there today. So he had asked um
[29:22] my dad to come and and be there to be a
[29:24] part of that. So he just wanted me to
[29:26] say that to you. That's where he's at
[29:28] today. And so we just want to be
[29:30] remembering him. Amen. And remembering
[29:33] brother Maurice. Amen. And so just pray
[29:36] that God just anoints him with um Amen.
[29:39] his blessing. Amen. For that church. We
[29:41] love that church in Green Pond and the
[29:43] believers over there. And and God's got
[29:45] a plan and a purpose for everything. And
[29:47] nothing happens by accident or mistake.
[29:49] How many believe that about the Lord?
[29:52] Amen. He is sovereign over everything in
[29:54] our life. So we just want to be uh
[29:57] thinking about that. Also, brother Tony
[29:59] is there with his dad in Florida way. I
[30:02] think his whole family went with him. So
[30:04] we he just uh wrote me yesterday to let
[30:06] me know that. So amen. You love the Lord
[30:09] Jesus.
[30:10] Amen.
[30:11] We just want to look to the word this
[30:13] morning. I spoke Wednesday on taking
[30:15] back Eden. And then today I want to just
[30:18] minister to you with the Lord being my
[30:20] help. But I just want to title this, a
[30:22] restored Eden has begun. A restored Eden
[30:26] has begun. Let's look at Ephesians 4,
[30:28] what we read, and then we'll look at
[30:30] Romans 12. Why don't we just begin
[30:32] reading here
[30:34] um let me find my place here. Let's just
[30:36] start be begin here at uh verse uh 22.
[30:41] Ephesians 4
[30:44] verse 22.
[30:47] that you put off concerning the former
[30:50] conversation, the old man, which is
[30:52] corrupt according to the deceitful lust.
[30:56] And notice the scripture here, and be
[30:58] renewed
[30:59] in the spirit of your mind. And be
[31:02] renewed
[31:03] in the spirit of your mind. And that you
[31:06] put on the new man, which after God is
[31:08] created in righteousness and true
[31:10] holiness, wherefore putting away lying,
[31:14] speak every man truth with his neighbor.
[31:16] For we're members one of another. Be ye
[31:18] angry and sin not. Let not the sun go
[31:22] down upon your wrath, neither give place
[31:25] to the devil. We spoke a lot about that.
[31:27] Verse 27, Wednesday, not to give place
[31:31] to the devil. How many cut the grass?
[31:35] Amen. I was looking at it just uh just
[31:38] uh even just yesterday still just not
[31:40] knowing what direction the Lord would
[31:42] take me. And and I was happened just to
[31:44] be somewhere in in a real wildernessy
[31:46] area, me, my son Ethan, and we seen a
[31:48] big old man, black uh snake with yellow
[31:52] uh you know, circles going through it.
[31:54] Four feet about 4t 5t long uh just
[31:57] massive just slithered right through.
[31:59] It's a king snake and uh not poisonous,
[32:02] but you know, a snake doesn't have to
[32:05] have a poisonous venom to kill you. A a
[32:09] king snake actually constricts. He wraps
[32:12] himself around his prey and he kills
[32:14] that prey by his his power to to bind
[32:18] him. And so we know that there's spirits
[32:21] that bring poison in our life. There's
[32:23] also spirits that bring binding.
[32:26] And uh and can bind us and suffocate us.
[32:30] Amen. But the Bible says, "I've given
[32:32] you power over serpents. You shall tread
[32:34] upon the head of serpents." That's what
[32:36] Jesus said.
[32:37] Amen. And so we we don't want to give
[32:39] place to the devil. We want to not give
[32:42] him any bedding ground. I want to give a
[32:44] bedding ground to the seed of the word
[32:46] and let that have it take root in my
[32:48] life. Let's keep reading here. Let him
[32:50] that stole steal no more, but rather let
[32:52] him labor working with his hands that
[32:54] thing which is good that he may have to
[32:55] give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt
[32:58] communication proceed out of your mouth,
[33:00] but that which is good to the use of
[33:01] edifying, that it may minister grace
[33:04] unto the hearers. Romans 12. And you'll
[33:06] be seated after I read this verse here.
[33:08] Ver chapter 12 and verse 2. Very
[33:11] familiar scripture. And be not conformed
[33:15] to this world. And be not Romans 12:2.
[33:18] Be not conformed to this world. We know
[33:22] that word world means cosmos. Uh uh it's
[33:26] the it's the structure, the order, the
[33:28] opposite of the word chaos. Be not
[33:31] conformed to the to this world, but be
[33:34] ye transformed
[33:36] by the renewing of your mind. There it
[33:38] is again. That you may prove what is
[33:41] that good and acceptable and perfect
[33:44] will of God. How many just wants to be
[33:46] remembered in prayer? Just hold up a
[33:48] hand before the Lord. Let's bow our
[33:49] heads. Lord Jesus,
[33:51] Father, my hands are up today, God, in
[33:53] need of you. I pray Lord that you would
[33:56] just take sovereign control over the
[33:58] direction Lord that you've placed upon
[34:00] my heart. Lord, we feel your atmosphere
[34:03] even as brother Matthew was leading that
[34:05] song. Lord, we just feel such an an
[34:08] atmosphere and an attitude of of
[34:11] gratefulness, Lord, for you, for the
[34:13] work that you're doing, the work that
[34:15] you've done in our lives. We're
[34:17] testaments, Lord God. Just to be able to
[34:19] stand here today in this church, Lord,
[34:23] sitting at your table ready to receive.
[34:25] That's just a nothing of oursel, Lord,
[34:29] but it's the testament of the grace of
[34:31] God in our life. You've brought us,
[34:33] Lord, a mighty long way. And Father, we
[34:36] just want to give you thanks for that
[34:37] this morning. I pray, God, that your
[34:39] word would just take preeminence now.
[34:42] Lord, I pray that you would take your
[34:44] place amongst us. And may the words that
[34:46] are spoken today, Father, may it
[34:48] minister grace unto the hearers. Grant
[34:51] it, Lord Jesus, we pray. In your name we
[34:54] ask. Amen. You can be seated this
[34:56] morning.
[35:04] I want you to turn if you could in your
[35:06] Bible while I'm just speaking here to
[35:08] the book of Joel, chapter 2. Very
[35:11] familiar scripture. Just have that
[35:13] ready.
[35:14] I want you just to uh to just turn there
[35:17] and just hold your place there just for
[35:19] a moment while I just uh start to come
[35:21] into this thought. We know I I've been
[35:23] studying the message and boy, it's such
[35:26] a good one to study. If I'd give you
[35:28] one, amen, that I've just been feasting
[35:30] upon here for the last few days. It's
[35:32] the power of transformation. Brother
[35:34] Brandon preaches it there in Arizona and
[35:37] he preaches that message, the power of
[35:40] transformation. And I think it's
[35:42] transformation is just the center of
[35:45] that that you'll find of that entire
[35:47] sermon. Brother Barnham uh talks about
[35:49] the change of heart and the change of
[35:52] not just your heart but of your mind to
[35:54] be renewed uh in your mind. And the
[35:57] Bible says that we just read in Romans
[35:59] 12 to not be conformed but be
[36:02] transformed. And he quotes Romans 12:2.
[36:05] If you study that message, you'll find
[36:07] that brother Brandham speaks a lot about
[36:09] that mind of Christ. And the Bible says
[36:12] that uh to that that that the mind that
[36:14] was in Christ to let that mind be also
[36:17] in you so that you can do the perfect
[36:21] and acceptable will of God. And and and
[36:24] you'll find in God's power of
[36:26] transformation that the the brother
[36:28] Brandham is speaking about only what the
[36:31] the blood of the Lord Jesus can do. You
[36:34] can do a religion can do a lot of
[36:36] conformity can change can change us on
[36:38] the outside and make us look different
[36:41] or make us you know visually appear
[36:43] different but sometimes that religion is
[36:46] just a covering it's just a cloak and
[36:48] really the inside man has never been
[36:51] really transformed friends I just want
[36:53] to tell you I'm not in any way
[36:55] interested whatsoever in religious
[36:57] conformity or a religious even dress
[37:00] code of looking or talking like a
[37:02] believer. But I want something that can
[37:05] change me to a metamorphosis
[37:08] of of the old man to the new man.
[37:11] Amen.
[37:12] Amen. I believe that's what the message
[37:13] of the hour teaches is that this isn't
[37:16] just a putting on of a new religion or a
[37:19] new coat. As brother Brandon said, he
[37:21] said, I he said, I think many times we
[37:23] he we treat religion like a jacket. We
[37:25] treat it like a covering and we put a
[37:27] new covering. a man comes as a sinner
[37:29] and we just put a new covering, a new
[37:31] suit coat upon him. But many times you
[37:34] got a new coat, but the man on the
[37:36] inside is dirty. And brother Bam says,
[37:38] you know, I'm not interested in getting
[37:40] new coats on the men, but I'm interested
[37:42] in in in getting new men in the coats.
[37:46] How many just want to say, Lord, I want
[37:47] that in my life more than anything.
[37:49] Don't give me a a conformity on the
[37:52] outside, but change the the man that's
[37:54] inside of the coat
[37:57] and be transformed. Be changed. It means
[37:59] to be made something different. He takes
[38:03] that example of that tadpole that
[38:05] transforms. The power of transformation.
[38:08] He turns him from a tadpole into a frog
[38:11] and it becomes an entirely new creature.
[38:13] Let me tell you something. He don't swim
[38:15] anymore. He jumps. He hops. You say,
[38:18] "What does that mean, brother Matt?" It
[38:19] means his behavior is nothing like his
[38:22] old behavior. He acts different. He
[38:25] talks different. He walks different. And
[38:27] when the power of God really comes into
[38:30] the soul of a man, he will walk
[38:32] different. He will Come on, somebody. He
[38:34] will talk different. He will look
[38:36] different.
[38:37] Amen.
[38:38] Amen.
[38:39] He will put off the old man and the new
[38:42] man will take place. A new creature born
[38:45] again. The Bible says by God's word, by
[38:48] the incorruptible seed, that's the word
[38:50] of God. The only thing that doesn't have
[38:52] the curse upon it is this new life in
[38:55] Christ. And so, he talks about this, and
[38:58] I just want to go just a little bit
[39:00] further in this. And he talks about that
[39:03] that there's got to be a willingness to
[39:06] change. There's got to be something that
[39:08] that we we we've got to be willing for
[39:11] God to come in a in a divine
[39:13] supernatural act and transform every
[39:16] part of our life, every part of our
[39:19] conversation, every part of our per
[39:21] person, the things that we dwell upon.
[39:24] That's what Ephesians 4 was speaking of.
[39:26] That you put off the old man, you put on
[39:29] the new man. No corrupt communication,
[39:31] no corrupt thoughts, no corruption in
[39:34] the person. The curse has been lifted
[39:38] and you now live under Romans 8, the law
[39:42] of liberty to the believer. Can you say
[39:44] amen this morning? Just bear with me and
[39:46] pull on the word of God as I just
[39:48] develop the Lord just filling this
[39:50] inspiration. I just want to give it to
[39:52] you this morning. I believe it'll be a
[39:53] blessing to you. So he he talks further
[39:56] about creation and the power of Genesis
[40:00] 1. I want you to to notice something
[40:02] about Genesis 1 because many times we we
[40:05] would think that Genesis uh 1 in the
[40:08] beginning was all about creation. But
[40:10] can I just change that narrative in your
[40:13] mind that Genesis was not about
[40:15] creation. Genesis was about restoration.
[40:19] Because the Bible says that before the
[40:21] power of creation spoke, the world was
[40:24] in a condition of unrest. It was in a
[40:27] condition of of of darkness and a and a
[40:31] and a darkness covered the face of the
[40:33] of the waters. And it was the the earth
[40:36] w needed creation, but it creation
[40:39] brought restoration.
[40:41] Amen.
[40:41] Hold on to that just for a minute. I
[40:43] said sometimes the power of creation in
[40:46] our life brings the power of
[40:49] restoration.
[40:50] Amen.
[40:51] Because sometimes God has to start in
[40:53] our heart at the very bare bones.
[40:56] Nothing there. Cut it down to the root.
[41:00] Because restoration can only begin
[41:03] after, let me say it and be careful how
[41:06] I say this just to uh make sure you
[41:08] don't miss my point. Sometimes before a
[41:11] broken situation can ever be restored,
[41:14] it has to hit rock bottom.
[41:18] Amen.
[41:18] Hello, somebody.
[41:20] You go all the way back to the beginning
[41:22] uh in in in that restoration there in
[41:25] the book of Acts. I'm sorry, in the in
[41:27] the book of Genesis. It's a picture here
[41:30] uh of a of a of a world that was without
[41:34] form. It was without it was it was
[41:37] without form at void and darkness
[41:39] covered the face of the waters. And so,
[41:42] Brother Brandon preaches this power of
[41:44] transformation to to to not just show us
[41:48] what God did in Genesis,
[41:50] but that your world can also become
[41:53] without form and your world can also be
[41:56] covered by darkness. Talking about real
[41:59] world problems here, real people that
[42:01] live in real lives
[42:03] and face real battles.
[42:05] and live in also a garden of Eden in
[42:08] your own home, in your own marriage,
[42:11] your relationships.
[42:12] Amen.
[42:13] Your your your your your your life here
[42:16] that you that you live as a believer is
[42:20] very much like a garden of Eden. Listen
[42:23] to what brother Bandam says here. And
[42:25] and I just have this brothers. I sent
[42:27] that, brother Kevin. You could display
[42:29] that. He said in in the future home of
[42:31] the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly
[42:33] bride in this new earth. Let's look at
[42:36] it for a few minutes. Now in this new
[42:38] earth the skies listen if he doesn't
[42:41] have it just listen as I read it here.
[42:43] He says in this new earth let's look at
[42:46] it. The skies will never be black again.
[42:50] That's from the curse.
[42:51] Yeah.
[42:52] Never be angry clouds. Winds will never
[42:56] blow across her like that. Amen.
[43:00] She'll never tear up the trees and tear
[43:02] up the houses and turn over things.
[43:04] Lightning and the wrath will never belch
[43:08] from Satan across there and kill a man
[43:11] walking down the road or burn up a
[43:12] building. Talking about tornadoes or
[43:14] wildfires. No more. There will be no
[43:17] more typhoons sweep down or storms and
[43:20] tornadoes and tear up houses and kill
[43:23] little children. Uh-uh. Won't be no
[43:26] more. trying to destroy it won't be
[43:28] there. Satan is cast out.
[43:32] Amen. G.
[43:33] Don't you long for that day?
[43:36] Heavens and earth, he says, I'm just
[43:38] going to advance it here. I can do that.
[43:40] He says, heavens and earth have met. God
[43:44] and man is reconciled. And notice that
[43:48] progression. Heavens and earth have
[43:50] finally met. Right now, what are you in,
[43:52] brother Matt? You're in the process of
[43:55] heaven meeting earth.
[43:58] God and man now is in the process of
[44:01] being reconciled. But one day we'll be
[44:03] fully reconciled. A restored Eden has
[44:07] begun. See, all the curse, I love this.
[44:12] All the curse is gone. A restored Eden,
[44:18] a a a a restored atmosphere,
[44:22] a restored condition. I love this so
[44:24] much. Let me just find my place here.
[44:28] A restored atmosphere.
[44:31] You just forgive me just for one moment.
[44:33] Thank you, Lord. I want you to just to
[44:36] dwell with me here and get in get in the
[44:38] the way of thinking that that the Lord
[44:40] has just had me in just over the last
[44:43] few days here.
[44:45] I want you just to imagine. We know that
[44:48] when we speak about the the a millennial
[44:51] kingdom, we know that prior to heaven,
[44:53] prior to time ceasing, uh there first is
[44:57] a millennial reign. How many believe
[44:59] that?
[44:59] Amen.
[45:00] And in that millennial reign, there will
[45:02] be uh uh 10,00 this is this is this is
[45:07] part of the of the restoration that God
[45:10] refers to as the kingdom. You see, in
[45:13] that kingdom, that that heavenly kingdom
[45:16] that we speak about, it's it's referring
[45:19] to this time to where we're still in
[45:22] time. There's still sin,
[45:24] but sin has been bound. Sin has been by,
[45:28] brother Brandham said, Satan had been
[45:30] bound by a chain of circumstance. How
[45:32] many remembers him saying that?
[45:34] So that that heavenly kingdom meeting is
[45:36] brother Brandham says, heavens and earth
[45:38] have met. God and man is reconciled. A
[45:41] restored Eden has begun. I want you to
[45:45] notice this because brother Brandham
[45:47] talks about this in the seventh seal.
[45:49] And he says we must remember that this
[45:51] seventh seal is the end of time.
[45:54] The things written in the seven sealed
[45:56] book, the plan of redemption before the
[45:59] foundation of the world, it every bit
[46:01] ends. It is the end. I love how he says
[46:04] this right here. It is the end of the
[46:07] struggling world. Yes.
[46:09] It is the end of struggling nature. It
[46:12] is the end of everything in there. It's
[46:15] the end of the trumpets, the end of the
[46:17] vials. It's the end of the earth. It's
[46:19] the end of time. Time runs out. The
[46:22] Bible said so. Revelation 7, the 10th
[46:24] chap that uh time runs out. Revelations
[46:26] 10:7. The angel says time will be no
[46:29] more. Everything runs out in this time.
[46:33] At the end of this seventh seal, notice
[46:35] it's the end of the church age. It's the
[46:38] end of the trumpets, the end of the
[46:40] vials, even the end the he says an even
[46:44] end the ushering in of the millennium.
[46:48] That's on the seventh seal. So he talks
[46:51] about this ushering in. We know that
[46:53] what takes place after for believers is
[46:56] not heaven. After the rapture is not
[46:59] heaven. And you've got an entire
[47:00] tribulation period of 3 and 1/2 years
[47:03] that the world begins to feel the full
[47:06] wrath of God, the belching wrath of God
[47:09] as it pours into the entire earth,
[47:12] entire world, and we're at the marriage
[47:14] supper of the lamb. Thank God I'm not
[47:16] here for any part of that. I won't be
[47:18] connected to that dimension of chaos.
[47:21] I'll be in a heavenly dimension where
[47:24] the marriage supper of the lamb.
[47:25] Friends, I don't know about you, but
[47:27] I've got a place at that table. I've got
[47:29] a place, and I intend to be there. I
[47:32] don't intend to be here when the
[47:33] judgments begin to fall. You say, "How,
[47:35] brother Matt, because I've I've heard
[47:37] the the the the the the I've heard the
[47:40] the marriage sermon, and I've prepared
[47:43] myself." The Bible says, "The bride hath
[47:46] made herself ready."
[47:48] And so, so he notices here that before
[47:51] that, there's a there's a wedding supper
[47:53] going on. And then you come from that
[47:54] and you enter into this millennial
[47:57] world. The Bible speaks about it in re
[48:00] revelations 19 uh and 20. And he talks
[48:04] about how that Christ would come and he
[48:07] would establish his millennial kingdom
[48:10] and that new heaven and and and then the
[48:13] new heaven, sorry, and the earth which
[48:15] is out of time. Remember the millennium
[48:17] is still in time,
[48:18] right? Amen. And so notice he says here,
[48:22] he says, uh, let me just find my place
[48:24] here. He goes further and I don't want
[48:26] to take time to read it too much, but
[48:29] can I just get your minds just to
[48:31] capture here for a moment. Can you
[48:34] imagine a world?
[48:37] Can you imagine a world that you can
[48:40] live in? Talking about a real place that
[48:42] feels just like this one. Tangible just
[48:45] like this one.
[48:47] Life of people. As brother Adam said,
[48:49] living real lives. Can you imagine a a a
[48:53] a a world where righteousness
[48:57] prevails
[48:59] always?
[49:00] Hallelujah.
[49:01] Can you imagine a a world being ruled by
[49:04] a sovereign king? Let me just ask you
[49:06] this question here because in the mind
[49:08] of God, the kingdom of God is I is so
[49:11] different than the democracy system that
[49:13] we have today where we have either
[49:16] parliament, you know, or here we have an
[49:18] elected official and you got, you know,
[49:20] you got the branch of government the and
[49:22] and and we, you know, we men are men
[49:24] can't just they're not kings. They can't
[49:26] just rule forever, you know, uh and just
[49:30] keep ruling. Thank God we don't live
[49:32] under that kind of uh government. uh
[49:34] where a man could just rule forever, but
[49:36] we we can vote them out. We don't like
[49:38] them, we could put them in. But can you
[49:39] imagine being ruled? Let me just ask you
[49:42] it this way. Would you like to be living
[49:45] under today in this world without a say
[49:48] in a vote, unable to vote for who your
[49:51] elected official is, who your president
[49:53] is? He's just placed over you. None of
[49:55] us, not not one of us would sign up for
[49:57] that.
[49:59] You know why? Because we live in a
[50:01] sin-cursed world.
[50:02] Amen. And we know that men are cursed
[50:04] with sin. Can you say amen?
[50:06] Men are cursed with sin. So, no, I I
[50:09] would never want to live in that kind of
[50:10] pl I would never want to live in a place
[50:13] where there's a king ruling and a and a
[50:16] and a dynasty of a king and then when he
[50:18] dies, his son rules. It's all good as
[50:20] long as the king's a good king.
[50:22] Yeah, that's right.
[50:23] But it ain't so good when he's not a
[50:25] good king.
[50:26] Amen.
[50:27] So, you say, "Brother Matt, dear, you
[50:28] know, we don't we don't want no kingdom,
[50:30] no no rule of kings." Well, give me two
[50:33] seconds here to convince you that
[50:35] actually a kingdom ruled by a king is
[50:38] the best type of of government
[50:42] that God has ever created.
[50:44] That's right. Amen.
[50:45] As Church Hill famously said, democracy
[50:48] is the worst form of government except
[50:50] all the rest.
[50:53] In other words, it's the it's the best
[50:56] of the worst.
[50:57] Amen.
[50:59] But how about a king who's always just?
[51:05] Think about that just for a moment. How
[51:07] about a king who would love his people
[51:10] so much that he would give his life and
[51:14] lay down his life for his people?
[51:16] Amen.
[51:17] How about a king who's perfect in his
[51:19] rule, who never makes a mistake?
[51:23] a a a a a a king where his dominion and
[51:28] his reign doesn't allow poverty, doesn't
[51:31] allow doesn't allow hunger. In his
[51:34] kingdom, no one goes hungry.
[51:36] Amen.
[51:37] And his kingdom, there are no poor.
[51:40] And his kingdom, he it's it's it's it's
[51:43] over. It's o it's it's it's a kingdom
[51:45] that that that has no effect of the
[51:49] curse of sin.
[51:51] Hallelujah. I'm talking about a king
[51:54] ruled by God, King Jesus.
[51:57] Can you imagine a world here where
[52:00] goodness,
[52:02] which is godness, because there's none
[52:05] good but God.
[52:06] And true godliness only comes from God.
[52:09] Goodness comes from God.
[52:12] Where goodness dominates the society.
[52:15] Where everything
[52:17] is fair and equitable. Can you imagine a
[52:21] world where there's peace from shore to
[52:24] shore?
[52:25] Amen.
[52:26] Total and lasting peace, no war,
[52:30] no jealousy, a world where there's just
[52:32] joy and happiness. Can you imagine a
[52:34] world where health is so widespread
[52:38] that there is no sickness?
[52:40] Amen.
[52:41] There is no cancer. There is no disease.
[52:45] Can you imagine that kind of a world? I
[52:47] plan to live in one that kind of world
[52:48] one day. Amen.
[52:50] The Bible speaks about children will
[52:52] play with the adder. It talks about
[52:54] lions feeding as the ox even wolves you
[52:59] know uh mingling with the lambs. There
[53:01] is no desire. There is no death. There
[53:04] is no murder. There is no violence.
[53:08] The Bible says where lambs and lions
[53:10] will walk together where where bears and
[53:14] cows this is what the scripture speaks
[53:15] of. Uh uh uh it talks about a world
[53:19] where there everything is plenteous.
[53:21] There is nobody in any want. There's no
[53:24] one experiencing depression or fear.
[53:27] Amen.
[53:28] Or anxiety. Can you just imagine a
[53:31] perfect world where Eden has been
[53:34] restored?
[53:35] Amen.
[53:36] Can you imagine a world ruled by just
[53:39] one person with a perfect mind, a
[53:41] perfect heart, a perfect will, a perfect
[53:44] word? He never makes a mistake. One who
[53:47] enacts perfect judgment and justice,
[53:50] perfect wisdom, and he's loving and he
[53:53] rules by his word.
[53:56] Can you imagine where a world where uh
[53:59] this is what the millennium speaks of?
[54:01] Because the Bible talks about how that
[54:03] God will rule. Know you not that you
[54:05] shall judge angels, the saints shall
[54:07] judge the earth. So who will be part of
[54:10] this great dominion that God has? It
[54:12] will be the elected bride of Jesus
[54:14] Christ.
[54:15] Amen.
[54:15] Amen.
[54:16] Can you imagine? Let me let me just tell
[54:18] you what the the scripture speaks about
[54:20] it here just for a moment. Can you
[54:22] imagine that type of place? Cuz I'm
[54:25] talking to you about a restored Eden, a
[54:28] real a a reality that actually exists.
[54:33] Say, "Brother Matt, that sounds great.
[54:35] Can I just get you to go on further with
[54:38] your imagination this morning?"
[54:39] Amen.
[54:41] Can you imagine a home with no stress?
[54:47] None.
[54:49] Amen.
[54:51] Can you imagine a home
[54:54] with no stress ever?
[54:59] Can you imagine a home with no
[55:02] arguments?
[55:03] Praise God. Amen.
[55:06] Oh, I guess y'all don't argue in your
[55:08] home, do you?
[55:11] I already got that kind of you live in
[55:13] heaven on earth. Well, you're at church.
[55:15] You better get to the altar.
[55:18] Can you imagine a home where there's no
[55:21] shouting across the room? No slam doors.
[55:24] Can I get Can I be real with you here
[55:26] today?
[55:27] Amen.
[55:27] How many Christians want to take off
[55:28] your angel wings and your halos?
[55:31] Come on.
[55:32] Say, "I live real life." This is what
[55:34] brother Brandon talks about. The end of
[55:35] a struggling world.
[55:37] Listen, friends, let me just say this.
[55:39] The struggle is by design.
[55:41] Yeah.
[55:42] Amen.
[55:42] Brother Brandon preaches that in and and
[55:44] and and a super sign. And he says,
[55:46] "Everybody wants a super something. They
[55:48] always want this super this and a super
[55:50] highway and a and he said they they
[55:52] imagine this perfect this perfect world
[55:54] with no problems and no trouble. That
[55:56] world is coming." But I got news that
[55:58] world is not now
[56:01] and the struggle is part of the story.
[56:04] You cannot have a perfect Eden without
[56:08] the struggle.
[56:09] True.
[56:10] Amen.
[56:11] I would love it. I would love it if I
[56:14] could cut my grass and never have to cut
[56:17] it again.
[56:18] I would love it if just one hard day of
[56:21] labor would be all I had to do and work
[56:23] from the sun up till sun down. And man,
[56:26] I would I'd I'd sweat and I would I you
[56:29] know, if if I knew it was just going to
[56:31] be that one day and after I cut all the
[56:33] grass and pulled up all the weeds, it
[56:35] would never grow again.
[56:37] But I got news, it don't work that way.
[56:40] Cuz that grass in the springtime, those
[56:42] weeds that you pull up, you look at it,
[56:44] oh, look how beautiful it is. Come about
[56:46] 3 days later and you got a little weed
[56:49] that sprouts up right in the middle of
[56:50] your manicured yolan. What is it? It's a
[56:53] constant struggle. This is what God told
[56:56] Adam. You've got to tend it. Don't ever
[56:58] get complacent. Don't ever think that a
[57:01] victory is final because on the other
[57:04] side of that victory is a valley. On the
[57:06] other side of that victory is a test. On
[57:09] the other side of that high experience
[57:11] where you just feel like you can take on
[57:13] the world, there's waiting a test to
[57:16] mold your character. And you can't sit
[57:19] down. You can't get complacent. You've
[57:21] got to say, "I'm going to pick up my
[57:23] sword. I'm going to fight another day. I
[57:25] might have fallen down. I might have I
[57:27] have dirt on my face, but I'm going to
[57:29] get back up. I'm going to go back out
[57:32] there and wage war with the devil.
[57:35] Yes, sir.
[57:36] This is part of the struggling world.
[57:38] We're going to a world where there is no
[57:40] struggle. Hallelujah.
[57:41] But right now, God has intentionally by
[57:45] design placed us in a place where we can
[57:49] live in an Eden, an atmosphere of health
[57:52] and harmony and unity. But you've got to
[57:55] fight for every inch of ground.
[57:58] Amen.
[57:59] That God gives you. And you know what?
[58:01] God doesn't just give it to you all
[58:03] overnight.
[58:04] Amen.
[58:05] Let me say this to you Christians here.
[58:07] How many believers do we have here
[58:08] today? God never intended to give you
[58:11] success overnight. As a believer, there
[58:14] is no such thing as a microwaved or o
[58:17] overcoming life.
[58:19] You can't open a can of of over of
[58:22] overcoming and just, you know, a canned
[58:24] life of a victorious Christian. It don't
[58:26] happen that way.
[58:27] Amen.
[58:27] You got to fight for it. It's a
[58:29] struggle. Go read Deuteronomy chapter 4
[58:31] and the Bible tells them that God said
[58:33] to Moses, he said, "The land I've given
[58:36] you, thank God it's a promise. Thank God
[58:38] it's your inheritance. Thank God I got
[58:41] my inheritance in the land. But then
[58:43] there's a very important key to unlock
[58:45] that inheritance. He says, "And I will
[58:47] not give it to you in one day, but I
[58:50] will give it to you little by little."
[58:53] Amen. Amen.
[58:54] You know why he says that? He says, "So
[58:56] that the land so that I don't just give
[58:59] it all to you." And then he says, "Then
[59:01] the land overtake you." So God's path to
[59:05] Eden is little by little by little by
[59:09] little. And the more little that you
[59:12] get, the bigger it becomes.
[59:14] Amen.
[59:15] Amen.
[59:16] But God never intended to give us this
[59:18] overnight. It's a struggle. Can can do
[59:20] you do you do you are you glad to know
[59:22] that the struggle that you're in was
[59:24] designed by God?
[59:26] Amen.
[59:26] He absolutely made it that way. He put
[59:30] the snakes there
[59:32] for you to have to keep out of your
[59:35] garden.
[59:36] Amen.
[59:37] Amen.
[59:38] Let me go further. Imagine a place where
[59:41] there's no slam doors. There's no silent
[59:44] treatment.
[59:49] There's no tension.
[59:50] Yeah. Come on.
[59:52] Just peace.
[59:54] Just love.
[59:55] Yeah.
[59:55] Just joy. A place where everyone is
[59:59] known, everyone is valued, everyone is
[1:00:02] loved. This was Eden and this has begun.
[1:00:09] I want you I want you just to take your
[1:00:11] mind here just for a moment because I'm
[1:00:14] going to speak to you about vision. I'm
[1:00:17] going to speak to you about not looking
[1:00:19] at what you see now. Because brother
[1:00:21] Matt, what you talk about is so
[1:00:22] ethereal, so way out there, unreachable.
[1:00:25] Well, let me just tell you something
[1:00:26] today. In order to get there, you've got
[1:00:28] to have a vision
[1:00:30] of where God's taking you, not where
[1:00:33] you're at currently.
[1:00:34] Amen.
[1:00:35] Can I say this? Restoration,
[1:00:37] when a man goes to restoring something,
[1:00:40] he's got to have a vision of the
[1:00:42] finished product.
[1:00:44] If he looks at the ruin that's in front
[1:00:46] of him, it will so overwhelm him that
[1:00:49] he'll never start the process
[1:00:51] of restoration. Amen.
[1:00:53] And sometimes our life can get so
[1:00:55] broken, our eating can get so overgrown.
[1:00:59] There can be so much stress and so much
[1:01:01] trouble that we just lose sight of even
[1:01:03] trying and we sort of put down our
[1:01:05] shovels and put down our picks and put
[1:01:08] down our chainsaws
[1:01:10] because it's just too overwhelming. The
[1:01:12] growth is just too much. But you've got
[1:01:14] to have a vision. Yeah,
[1:01:16] you've got to have a vision of not
[1:01:18] today, but might maybe not tomorrow.
[1:01:21] Maybe not even next year, but God's
[1:01:24] going to do it.
[1:01:25] And it may be little by little, but what
[1:01:28] are you going to do? I'm going to put
[1:01:29] one step in front of one foot in front
[1:01:31] of the other foot, and I'm going to
[1:01:32] march until I have what God has promised
[1:01:36] me.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:38] Can you just hear think of that here
[1:01:41] just for a moment? This was Eden. only
[1:01:43] peace, only the presence of God, not
[1:01:46] just a garden, but a a a blueprint for
[1:01:49] what God intended. A place where there's
[1:01:51] no corruption, a place where heaven
[1:01:54] meets earth and every breath is filled
[1:01:57] with the shalom of God, the peace of God
[1:02:00] that passes understanding, the hope of
[1:02:03] God, the trust, and despite of varying
[1:02:06] circumstances, a trust that's
[1:02:07] unwavering, a confession that's
[1:02:09] unwavering. You say, "Brother Matt, what
[1:02:11] are you preaching on?" I'm preaching on
[1:02:12] what we can have today if we could just
[1:02:14] catch a vision. Stop looking at what's
[1:02:17] here and look beyond what what is here
[1:02:19] and what can be.
[1:02:21] Amen.
[1:02:24] So notice this here. I I I I love this
[1:02:27] so much because brother talks so much
[1:02:29] about this vision and he talks about how
[1:02:32] that the scripture even speaks about it
[1:02:35] that with without a vision the people
[1:02:38] perish. How many remember that
[1:02:39] scripture?
[1:02:41] that without a vision you the the the
[1:02:44] people perish. This is exactly what the
[1:02:46] scripture says. We talked about
[1:02:47] Wednesday about this uh this this this
[1:02:50] this garden of Eden, this perfect
[1:02:53] condition, this perfect place. But you
[1:02:57] notice what happens here when you when
[1:02:59] you when when when it becomes overran
[1:03:01] and overgrown. Let me let me read you a
[1:03:03] powerful word here. I thought this was
[1:03:05] so good. I just want it to sink in. It
[1:03:08] was by a man named PK Bernard years and
[1:03:10] years ago and he made a powerful
[1:03:12] statement about a vision and he says a
[1:03:14] man without a vision is a man without a
[1:03:17] future.
[1:03:19] A man without a vision is a man without
[1:03:23] a future. A man without a future will
[1:03:27] always return to his past.
[1:03:30] Amen.
[1:03:30] Think about that here for a moment.
[1:03:33] Without a vision to see beyond it. So
[1:03:36] the vision is actually the bridge. I'm
[1:03:40] not talking about the tangible. I'm
[1:03:41] talking about catching a vision of what
[1:03:43] can be. So the vision is the bridge
[1:03:47] between the present and the future. How
[1:03:50] do you get to the future? You got to
[1:03:51] have a vision.
[1:03:52] Yeah.
[1:03:53] So vision then will give pain a purpose.
[1:03:57] Vision will give struggle a purpose.
[1:04:00] Vision will give strife a purpose.
[1:04:02] Vision will give trials. How many's got
[1:04:05] trials?
[1:04:06] If you have a vision for why God has put
[1:04:08] you through that, it'll give a purpose
[1:04:10] to that trial.
[1:04:12] Otherwise, you look around and all you
[1:04:13] see is the destruction and the trouble
[1:04:16] and the current here and now. And if
[1:04:18] Satan can, he will stop your growth. He
[1:04:21] will stunt your growth. He will get you
[1:04:23] into that spirit of complacency. Well, I
[1:04:26] guess it's just how it's going to be. I
[1:04:28] guess it'll always be this way, and
[1:04:30] it'll never change. And if the devil
[1:04:31] can, he will suffocate you under that
[1:04:34] lie. And you'll go to your grave
[1:04:36] believing it can never change. But I'm
[1:04:37] trying to preach you out of that
[1:04:39] condition today to say, "Look beyond the
[1:04:41] current. Look beyond the here and now.
[1:04:44] Catch a vision of what God can do."
[1:04:47] Hallelujah.
[1:04:48] Amen.
[1:04:49] Oh, how many believes that here today?
[1:04:51] What God can do. You say, "Brother Matt,
[1:04:53] but you don't know how bad it is." Let
[1:04:55] me let me give you something that the
[1:04:56] Lord gave me. You know, sometimes it
[1:04:59] becomes so overwhelming. And you say,
[1:05:00] "How do I even begin?" Let me give you a
[1:05:03] very simple key. Start where you're at
[1:05:06] right now. It's as simple as that. Start
[1:05:09] right where. But you got to start.
[1:05:13] Everyone's looking for something great
[1:05:15] in the future to take place. And oh,
[1:05:17] it'll get better. But let me tell you,
[1:05:19] Eden's reachable. It's attainable. But
[1:05:21] you got to start where you're at right
[1:05:23] now.
[1:05:24] You got to use what you already got.
[1:05:27] Stop looking for what you don't have and
[1:05:29] look at what you do have. Already in
[1:05:32] Jesus, you've got the authority over
[1:05:34] every devil that comes to attack your
[1:05:37] home, your health, your body, your mind,
[1:05:39] your spirit. You don't need something
[1:05:41] out in the future. Friend, let me just
[1:05:43] say, you've already got the remedy.
[1:05:45] You've already got the antidote. You've
[1:05:47] already got the power, the authority.
[1:05:49] All you got to do is stop sitting on
[1:05:52] your seat of do nothing. Stop. Come on,
[1:05:55] somebody. Let us stop sitting on, oh,
[1:05:57] it'll get better. Oh, if this can ever
[1:05:59] happen, and stand up and start fighting
[1:06:02] where you're at right now. Look at the
[1:06:05] God who can,
[1:06:08] not at what you cannot do. You've got to
[1:06:10] use what you've got. You got to see a
[1:06:14] vision. I'm preaching to you this
[1:06:15] morning. I know I'm preaching to
[1:06:16] somebody here today. So, God is the one
[1:06:19] who gives that vision. He'll give you a
[1:06:22] picture. Let me say this. The God will
[1:06:24] give you a picture of where you're going
[1:06:25] before you ever get there.
[1:06:28] And Satan will give you a picture of a
[1:06:31] place that you'll never end up actually
[1:06:33] going. And he'll he'll create an image
[1:06:36] of fear in your life and let you live in
[1:06:39] that fear. And it's actually something
[1:06:41] that God will never allow to take place
[1:06:43] in your life. But if the devil can get
[1:06:45] you to believe that, he'll suffocate you
[1:06:48] and starve you of all the graces of God,
[1:06:51] thinking and living in that life that
[1:06:53] that lie that will never take place. But
[1:06:56] I got a word for you this morning. God
[1:06:58] will never promise you something that he
[1:07:01] won't keep in your own life. God will
[1:07:03] never give you a promise that he can't
[1:07:06] keep. God will never give you a word
[1:07:08] that he hasn't already secured your
[1:07:11] journey that you will end up there. You
[1:07:13] will arrive there. Stop thinking you'll
[1:07:16] never make it, church. You're going to
[1:07:17] make we're going to make it. It may pull
[1:07:20] us through a lot of fights and a lot of
[1:07:22] cuts and a and a lot a lot of trials,
[1:07:24] but we will arrive to our destination.
[1:07:27] You say, "How, brother Matt?" Because he
[1:07:29] spoke it. He promised it and I believe
[1:07:32] it with all of my heart.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] It's a picture, something that's ahead
[1:07:37] of you. a vision of something God gives
[1:07:40] you. And you've got to live into that
[1:07:43] picture. You can't stop here. You can't
[1:07:46] stop at the here and now. You can't look
[1:07:48] at the broken. You've got to look at
[1:07:50] God's promise.
[1:07:52] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:54] A restored Eden, Brother Brandham says
[1:07:58] that has begun. A restored Eden has
[1:08:03] begun. Bear with me here just as I find
[1:08:05] my place. I want you to notice the
[1:08:08] importance of when God gives a vision or
[1:08:11] God gives a dream. We we don't want to I
[1:08:13] don't I'll just quote it for you. Joel
[1:08:15] chapter 2. No, turn turn there. Thank
[1:08:17] you, Lord. Turn there if you already had
[1:08:19] it. Good. I'm glad. We'll just read it
[1:08:21] here together. I know it's so familiar
[1:08:23] to you. You're This is uh uh um this is
[1:08:27] the scripture here that we we know was a
[1:08:30] fulfillment of the book of Acts, but I
[1:08:32] just want to take it here from Joel
[1:08:33] chapter 2. I think it's verse 28. Let me
[1:08:35] just f pull it up for me. I want you to
[1:08:38] notice this promise here in Joel chapter
[1:08:40] 2 about restoration. And God says here
[1:08:43] in verse 23, let's just begin there. He
[1:08:46] says, "Be glad you children of Zion, and
[1:08:48] rejoice in the Lord God, for heath given
[1:08:50] you the former rain moderately. He will
[1:08:52] cause to come down to you the rain, the
[1:08:54] former rain, the latter rain in the
[1:08:56] first month. The floors shall be full of
[1:08:58] wheat." Is the floors full of wheat yet?
[1:09:01] Somebody answer me. Are they full of
[1:09:04] wheat yet? No, but they shall be.
[1:09:07] Notice the promise is always future.
[1:09:09] It's not the here. It's not the now, but
[1:09:11] they shall be. The floors shall be full
[1:09:14] of wheat, and the fat shall overflow
[1:09:17] with wine and oil. Verse 25. And I will
[1:09:20] restore. Somebody say, "Will."
[1:09:23] Amen.
[1:09:24] And I will. Not I might, not I may, not
[1:09:27] it might happen, but I will. You got to
[1:09:30] catch a hold of that, church. You got to
[1:09:32] catch a hold to say, "God, I don't
[1:09:34] believe you might, you maybe, you could.
[1:09:37] I got a confession here today to say
[1:09:40] everything that the devil has taken, God
[1:09:42] will restore it back to my life.
[1:09:45] Everything that the devil has came and
[1:09:47] robbed, he's a thief. He's a He's a He's
[1:09:50] a He comes to steal and kill. But here's
[1:09:52] what my vision says. God will."
[1:09:55] Not just God can. Somebody say, "God
[1:09:57] will."
[1:09:58] I will.
[1:09:59] I will restore to you the years. If you
[1:10:02] don't catch that vision, you'll stay in
[1:10:04] that ditch your whole life. If you don't
[1:10:07] catch a vision of what God not can do,
[1:10:10] but will do.
[1:10:12] Amen.
[1:10:13] Oh, I feel that all over me right now.
[1:10:16] What God will do, not can do, but what
[1:10:18] he's going to do.
[1:10:20] That's faith, my brother, my sister.
[1:10:23] That's when you really get a revelation
[1:10:25] of your healing of your body. That's
[1:10:27] when you get a revelation of the healing
[1:10:29] of your family. When you don't just say
[1:10:31] what God can do, what he might do, he
[1:10:33] might do for somebody else. But when you
[1:10:35] say, "My God said it. I believe it. He's
[1:10:37] going to do it. It may not happen today.
[1:10:40] It may not happen tomorrow, but I
[1:10:42] believe God's going to do it in my
[1:10:44] life." If anything the devil will do is
[1:10:47] get you to give up on your promise. to
[1:10:50] give up and just say, "Oh, I must have
[1:10:51] misunderstood it. I must have and got
[1:10:54] and Satan will get a person, a believer
[1:10:56] in such a discouraged state because they
[1:10:59] just give up. They lose their dream."
[1:11:02] Yeah.
[1:11:03] They lose their vision. They lose what
[1:11:06] God can do. Let's read it here together
[1:11:08] in verse 25. He says, "And I will
[1:11:11] restore to you the years that the locust
[1:11:13] has eaten the cankerm, the caterpillar,
[1:11:15] pommeor, my great army which I sent. You
[1:11:17] shall eat in plenty." I love that. "And
[1:11:20] be satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:11:22] Lord God that had dealt wondrously with
[1:11:24] you and my people shall never be. You
[1:11:26] shall know that I'm in the midst of
[1:11:28] Israel and that I am the Lord your God."
[1:11:30] Here it is right here. And it shall come
[1:11:32] to pass afterward that I will pour out
[1:11:36] my spirit upon all flesh and your sons.
[1:11:40] If you are a son here today under the
[1:11:43] age of 18, raise your hand this morning.
[1:11:46] Hold it up high. If you are under 18 and
[1:11:48] you are a son, raise your hand and hold
[1:11:50] it up. Keep it up. If you are a daughter
[1:11:52] today, under the age of 18, raise your
[1:11:55] hand here today. Raise them. Come on,
[1:11:57] somebody. Keep them up. If you are a
[1:11:59] girl, female, uh, a daughter, and you're
[1:12:02] the under the age of 18, raise that hand
[1:12:04] up. Come on, Amariah. I don't see that
[1:12:06] hand. Raise it up. You are my daughter.
[1:12:08] Oh, you're under not the age of 18.
[1:12:09] Okay, forgive me.
[1:12:12] You look at your kids at all times that
[1:12:14] they're 18 and younger. I want you to
[1:12:16] keep those hands up. How many dads we
[1:12:18] got here? How many fathers? Raise them
[1:12:20] up, dads. Hold them up. Come on. Don't
[1:12:22] Don't nobody put their hand down. How
[1:12:25] How many How many How How many mothers
[1:12:27] do we have? Raise your hand up here
[1:12:29] today if you're a mother.
[1:12:31] I want you to notice this here today.
[1:12:33] Your young men, your sons, your
[1:12:35] daughters. How many young men do we have
[1:12:38] here today? Come on. By faith, reach out
[1:12:40] there, you young man.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:43] Hold it up high. Come on. Why don't I
[1:12:45] see hands? Come on, somebody. Are you a
[1:12:47] do not a We don't have mothers and
[1:12:49] fathers. Young men, somebody have faith.
[1:12:52] How about you old men? Some of you
[1:12:53] that's honest enough to admit it. I'm an
[1:12:55] old man. Raise that hand up. Hold it up
[1:12:57] high. I want you to notice this here. H
[1:13:00] Now, I want you everybody in the middle
[1:13:02] who's not listed in old or young or son
[1:13:05] or daughter, raise up your hand this
[1:13:07] morning. I want you to notice this. This
[1:13:09] promise is to all of you.
[1:13:13] God, don't leave nobody out. Raise your
[1:13:16] hand. Say, "Lord, it's me."
[1:13:18] Don't point it. It's right here.
[1:13:20] It's me. You shall listen to what it
[1:13:22] says. He says here in verse 28, "I will
[1:13:25] pour out my spirit," somebody say this
[1:13:27] together, "won all flesh,
[1:13:30] your sons, your daughters, your old men,
[1:13:34] your young men."
[1:13:36] Amen.
[1:13:36] So notice the the the importance of this
[1:13:39] verse here that your old men dreams.
[1:13:46] I want you to look at this first time
[1:13:49] that that word the word that we get for
[1:13:52] revival. The first time that it's used,
[1:13:55] it's only used a few times in the Bible,
[1:13:57] but the first time revival is used is to
[1:14:00] an old man.
[1:14:03] Think about that here for a moment. To
[1:14:04] revive
[1:14:06] the weak. To revive the old. That's
[1:14:11] God's intention to give an old man a
[1:14:15] dream
[1:14:17] because he's always remembering what
[1:14:20] was. He's always remembering what God
[1:14:23] did. He's always he's at that point of
[1:14:26] life to where he's he's crossed a
[1:14:29] transition and he's not so much looking
[1:14:32] back in a way to say I want to go back
[1:14:34] there. He's look, he's got to a place in
[1:14:36] his life to where he knows the God that
[1:14:38] could and the God that did is the God
[1:14:40] who still will and the God who's going
[1:14:43] to do.
[1:14:45] And it's to a man named Jacob actually
[1:14:48] whose dream his son Joseph who he thinks
[1:14:52] is dead. He he he was the type Joseph
[1:14:55] you could say was the dream. It was the
[1:14:58] it was the promise that he had received.
[1:15:00] But now this old man had gotten to a
[1:15:02] place in his life to where he had given
[1:15:04] up hope. He had given up on the dream.
[1:15:07] For all for what he believed, Joseph was
[1:15:10] dead.
[1:15:11] For what he believed, he didn't know how
[1:15:12] he died. Didn't know his end, what had
[1:15:15] happened to him. All he knew is Joseph
[1:15:16] was no was dead. You know what the Bible
[1:15:19] records? It records that Joseph
[1:15:22] saddles up horses and came or camels and
[1:15:25] he puts upon him wagons, loads of wagons
[1:15:28] of goods and food and and all kinds of
[1:15:31] thing. And the Bible says that Joseph
[1:15:34] sent back the wagons with his brothers
[1:15:37] and said, "Give this to Jacob." And your
[1:15:39] Bible says that when Jacob seen the
[1:15:43] wagons, he knew Joseph was alive. And
[1:15:47] the Bible says when he seen the wagon,
[1:15:49] this is the first time that word revive
[1:15:51] is used. The spirit of Jacob revived.
[1:15:56] So what was an old man getting a dream
[1:15:58] realizing that what he had given up on,
[1:16:01] God was still going to do in his life.
[1:16:04] Oh, I hope somebody catches it today.
[1:16:06] Don't you give up on your promise God
[1:16:08] gave you. Say, "God, revive my spirit
[1:16:12] this morning." How many want that today?
[1:16:14] How many old men will say, "Revive, oh
[1:16:17] God, not the God of yesterday, but the
[1:16:19] God of today."
[1:16:22] You know, he says, "Your old men shall
[1:16:24] dream dreams, and your young men shall
[1:16:27] see visions."
[1:16:30] So, it would be important for old men to
[1:16:33] dream, but it would be just as important
[1:16:35] for young men to see visions.
[1:16:38] Amen.
[1:16:39] What was a vision? It's the God of
[1:16:41] possibility.
[1:16:43] I love that, brother Brandham. And once
[1:16:45] more, Lord, he says, Samson, do you know
[1:16:47] this is the first time that that word
[1:16:50] vision, one of the first times you will
[1:16:52] find this prophecy coming to pass, young
[1:16:55] men seeing visions, is a young man who
[1:16:58] had lost his vision,
[1:17:01] who had who had who had lived so apart
[1:17:05] from the purpose and the plan of God for
[1:17:07] his life that he finds himself with a
[1:17:10] prostitute. He finds himself in her lap.
[1:17:12] She shaves off his hair. He loses his
[1:17:15] strength. He's bound in a prison. He's
[1:17:17] put as a a as a mockery to the enemy.
[1:17:20] Here was an Israelite who was born a
[1:17:23] seed of Abraham. Anointed to do a job
[1:17:26] but had failed miserably for his job.
[1:17:30] Failure had become such a place in his
[1:17:32] life to where he was not only had no
[1:17:35] strength, but further than that, he was
[1:17:37] bound by the enemy with feathers of
[1:17:39] brass. And worse than that, they had
[1:17:41] plucked out his eyes. They had put out
[1:17:43] his vision. Oh, I think about the way
[1:17:45] that sin does so many young men. It gets
[1:17:48] to such a place of shame and and it'll
[1:17:51] wreck you. It's a poison like a
[1:17:53] poisonous snake that will destroy every
[1:17:55] part of your life. And it will not just
[1:17:58] take your strength away, young man. You
[1:18:00] feed on that spirit. It will rob you of
[1:18:03] every strength that you have. It'll rob
[1:18:05] you of every every virtue that God your
[1:18:09] mother and your father has striven to
[1:18:11] place in you. Sin will will bring a
[1:18:14] curse upon your life. And you you have
[1:18:16] no power and and and no strength. And
[1:18:19] worse than that, Samson was bound. Oh,
[1:18:22] can I preach here today? Sin will bind
[1:18:24] you into such a place. It It's like that
[1:18:27] p like that bo that king snake I seen
[1:18:30] who wraps himself around his victim and
[1:18:32] robs him of his strength.
[1:18:34] Amen.
[1:18:36] And then if you allow it, it'll go
[1:18:38] further than that and it will put out
[1:18:39] your eyes.
[1:18:41] Wow.
[1:18:42] And then you can't see. You never seen a
[1:18:45] person who can't see. They they have to
[1:18:47] trust in feeling.
[1:18:49] You have to trust in in other senses
[1:18:52] outside of that sense.
[1:18:54] But let me just say this. God never
[1:18:56] intended to save you to walk blindly.
[1:18:59] But he intended to give you the Holy
[1:19:00] Ghost, which was a vision uh for what
[1:19:03] God can do in your life.
[1:19:05] But we've got we we we have people that
[1:19:08] are so so bound with sin that they can't
[1:19:11] see beyond their failure. They can't see
[1:19:14] beyond the circumstances here today. Oh,
[1:19:17] but can I tell you that my Bible says,
[1:19:19] "Your old men shall dream dreams, and
[1:19:21] your young men shall see visions." And
[1:19:24] the first man who got his vision back
[1:19:27] was a man named Samson who had disgraced
[1:19:30] the name of God, failed the name of God,
[1:19:32] walked away from the vision of God. But
[1:19:35] God was going to say, "I'm going to give
[1:19:36] the vision back to a man who has fallen.
[1:19:39] And in his vision, in his death, God's
[1:19:42] going to do more in his death than he
[1:19:45] can do in his life.
[1:19:47] And brother Baram says, "What happened
[1:19:49] to Samson?" He caught the vision of
[1:19:51] possibility.
[1:19:52] Hallelujah.
[1:19:54] Amen.
[1:19:54] I said he caught the vision of what I
[1:19:57] did was wrong. What I did was a wreck.
[1:20:01] But I caught a vision of what God can do
[1:20:04] in my life. Amen.
[1:20:06] And the Bible says the hairs of his head
[1:20:08] started regrowing again. I believe God
[1:20:11] can give you your hair back. Satan might
[1:20:14] have stripped it away from you and
[1:20:16] stripped you of all virtue, but God can
[1:20:18] grow everything that Satan has taken
[1:20:20] away from you and he will give it back.
[1:20:24] Amen.
[1:20:24] It's a young man catching a vision of
[1:20:28] what God can do in his life.
[1:20:31] He caught the vision of possibility.
[1:20:34] Samson had not done that, he would have
[1:20:36] lived as a mockery.
[1:20:39] But because he caught a vision of what
[1:20:42] God was going to do in his life, he died
[1:20:45] a victor.
[1:20:47] Amen.
[1:20:48] Amen.
[1:20:48] You love the Lord.
[1:20:50] Amen.
[1:20:51] So it starts with this. It was a vision.
[1:20:54] Jacob gets his gets his v gets his dream
[1:20:57] back. Samson gets his vision back. And
[1:21:00] the Bible says without a vision the
[1:21:02] people perish. I think of men like David
[1:21:07] who had gotten to such a place in his
[1:21:09] life in Ziglag where it looked hopeless.
[1:21:11] You know the story when he goes and he's
[1:21:13] living not not you know in sin per se
[1:21:16] but backslid developed you know it got
[1:21:19] to such a place to check out from the
[1:21:20] pressure of life. He goes and settles in
[1:21:22] Ziglag, his family, his wife, his, you
[1:21:25] know, his children, his daughters. And
[1:21:27] and he gets in a mess there. And and the
[1:21:30] Bible says they come back and they cross
[1:21:32] over the hill and there's smoke and and
[1:21:34] David realizes his wife is captured, his
[1:21:38] daughters are captured, his home is
[1:21:40] destroyed.
[1:21:41] Amen.
[1:21:42] I talk talking about a discouraging
[1:21:44] place.
[1:21:45] Yeah.
[1:21:45] And he gets to such a place to where
[1:21:47] he's so discouraged.
[1:21:50] The Bible says that the men who had
[1:21:52] fought with him, you know, had began to
[1:21:55] weep. And the Bible says it this way,
[1:21:57] they cried until they had no more tears.
[1:22:00] Men who lost their wife, lost their
[1:22:03] children, thought all hope was lost.
[1:22:06] Yeah. Amen.
[1:22:08] And and the Bible, I love how the Bible
[1:22:10] says that he says that David, you know,
[1:22:13] even himself was discouraged because the
[1:22:17] men he heard them murmuring.
[1:22:22] They he heard the men talking about
[1:22:25] killing him. These were his men.
[1:22:27] Amen.
[1:22:28] Men who who he would give his life for.
[1:22:30] Now they wanted to stone him. That's
[1:22:31] what the scripture says. They spoke of
[1:22:32] stoning him. And David got so
[1:22:35] discouraged
[1:22:37] because his Eden, his perfect place had
[1:22:39] been so overran by the devil and it and
[1:22:42] and now it was utter destruction and
[1:22:45] chaos in his life. The Bible says that
[1:22:48] the men spoke of stoning him that he
[1:22:51] would lose it all that he was going to
[1:22:53] that he had not not lose it all but had
[1:22:55] lost it all. You know, let me let me
[1:22:58] just say this here as I just close here
[1:23:00] just today. Let me bring this wine this
[1:23:02] on down to a close.
[1:23:04] It It's so powerful because if you look
[1:23:06] at throughout even history,
[1:23:10] it it would it would it would take men
[1:23:13] it would take something inside of a man
[1:23:15] to believe in something more than what
[1:23:18] his current situation told him. He would
[1:23:22] have to catch a vision. And you think of
[1:23:23] brother Brandham talking about it in
[1:23:25] countdown how that they had to take that
[1:23:28] that that the the the the materials that
[1:23:30] were already there to believe that there
[1:23:32] was something beyond it. It was a man
[1:23:34] actually by the name of Christopher
[1:23:36] Columbus. You could you know very well
[1:23:38] the story of Christopher Columbus and
[1:23:40] and his discovery of the new world. We
[1:23:43] know his story very well. But let me
[1:23:45] just say that that the reason why
[1:23:47] Columbus discovered the the new world
[1:23:50] was not just because, you know, he just
[1:23:52] randomly happened upon it, but there was
[1:23:55] there was something inside of him.
[1:23:58] There was a there was an eagerness of
[1:24:00] discovery. There was a there was a
[1:24:03] something more, let me say, more than a
[1:24:05] curiosity,
[1:24:07] but something that drove him to believe
[1:24:09] there's something beyond what we have
[1:24:12] settled for. Yes. Amen.
[1:24:14] When the rest of the world, even some
[1:24:16] believing that the world was flat,
[1:24:17] that's not the main reason why Columbus
[1:24:19] set sail. But but one of the, you know,
[1:24:22] the the people that was against him just
[1:24:23] believed that you'd go to try to
[1:24:25] discover a new word, you'll fall off the
[1:24:26] edge of the earth. Or and one man said
[1:24:28] that that sea monsters and dragons and
[1:24:31] and and will will just, you know, will
[1:24:33] will eat your boat up and destroy all of
[1:24:35] you. There was just naysayers. Listen,
[1:24:37] the devil will put any kind of fear he
[1:24:39] can upon you. he'll to make up any kind
[1:24:42] of mythical story upon you what's going
[1:24:44] to happen to you. But Columbus wasn't
[1:24:46] going to allow the naysayers to stop
[1:24:49] him. The the history records he was
[1:24:52] laughed at. He had a theory that his
[1:24:54] theory said there's something beyond
[1:24:57] what we see here. There's something
[1:24:59] beyond what we know already. There's
[1:25:02] something past this. It was met with
[1:25:05] great skepticism and people laughed at
[1:25:07] him, made fun of him because he he
[1:25:10] believed that there was more than what
[1:25:13] men had discovered. Queen Isabella,
[1:25:15] history tells us that the queen of Spain
[1:25:18] gives him a commission and gave him the
[1:25:20] money and he financed Christopher
[1:25:22] Columbus to and his crew in the journey
[1:25:25] that he would take a ship and he would
[1:25:27] set out to, you know, uh to to to to to
[1:25:30] discover. And so what's amazing is
[1:25:33] because a paradigm shift occurred in his
[1:25:36] own life and crew that he had that would
[1:25:39] be willing not just to go but to risk
[1:25:42] their own life to risk everything to
[1:25:45] discover a place they had never been
[1:25:48] before.
[1:25:49] Amen.
[1:25:50] Think about that here for a moment. When
[1:25:52] Abraham leaves everything he had ever
[1:25:54] known, this was the father of the faith.
[1:25:57] And God says, "Get up, Abraham." And
[1:26:00] Abraham starts a journey to go to go
[1:26:03] seek a place that he had never known. A
[1:26:08] place he had never been before. That's
[1:26:10] why the Bible says Abraham sought a city
[1:26:14] whose builder and maker was God.
[1:26:16] Amen.
[1:26:17] What was it? There was something in
[1:26:19] Abraham. He wasn't going to settle for
[1:26:21] the here and now. He wasn't going to
[1:26:23] just settle for the norm, the status
[1:26:26] quo, but he was going to pick up
[1:26:28] everything he had known and he was going
[1:26:30] to seek and a city whose builder and
[1:26:33] maker was God.
[1:26:35] I think of the pioneer what even the
[1:26:37] word pioneer means. It's a person with
[1:26:40] vision to see beyond the here and now.
[1:26:44] pioneers who broke barriers and pursued
[1:26:48] a vision beyond what was visible or what
[1:26:51] you could say was accepted by everybody
[1:26:54] around them. You think of great stories
[1:26:56] of invention and exploration. And what
[1:26:59] you'll find is is even men like Thomas
[1:27:02] Edison, I love this so much. He he was
[1:27:05] dubbed the wizard of Menllo Park. He
[1:27:07] believed he could harness electricity to
[1:27:10] light up the world at a time when gas
[1:27:12] lamps was the only light that men had.
[1:27:15] He he created and you know that he
[1:27:17] creates the incandescent light bulb. But
[1:27:19] let me tell you about that incandescent
[1:27:21] light bulb. It was filled with failure.
[1:27:25] It was filled with no success. It was
[1:27:28] filled with attempt after attempt after
[1:27:30] attempt
[1:27:31] with no results.
[1:27:34] Some of the greatest places God can take
[1:27:37] you will be filled with some of your
[1:27:40] deepest failures.
[1:27:42] Some of the greatest places God will
[1:27:45] bring you will will on the journey will
[1:27:48] have mistakes and missteps and you'll
[1:27:51] come up short.
[1:27:52] Oh yeah.
[1:27:54] Come on. Amen. Edison reportedly tested
[1:27:57] thousands of materials
[1:28:01] from bamboo to cotton thread with little
[1:28:03] to no success. What did he do, brother
[1:28:06] Matt? Did he give up? No, cuz he
[1:28:08] couldn't give up. There was something
[1:28:09] inside of him that would not let him
[1:28:11] give up.
[1:28:13] Amen.
[1:28:14] And rather than give up, you know what
[1:28:16] he did? He reframed the narrative. The
[1:28:19] narrative was you failed.
[1:28:22] That's what was true. He failed. A
[1:28:25] reporter asks him about his many
[1:28:28] unsuccessful attempts and Edison
[1:28:31] replied, "I have not failed. I've just
[1:28:35] found 10,000 ways that won't work."
[1:28:42] It's funny, but you know what he was
[1:28:43] doing? He was changing the narrative
[1:28:46] of failure. I hope you get a hold of
[1:28:48] that today. You can look at your life in
[1:28:51] one of two ways. You could look at your
[1:28:53] life and say, "It's just been a failure
[1:28:55] and I've made a lot of mistakes and
[1:28:57] it'll I never amount to nothing." If you
[1:28:59] let the devil do the speaking and do the
[1:29:02] talking, that's what your confession
[1:29:04] will be. Or you can say, "Many are the
[1:29:06] afflictions of the righteous, but God is
[1:29:09] faithful to deliver them from them all.
[1:29:12] There is no saint. The only difference
[1:29:14] between the sinner and the saint is the
[1:29:16] saint falls down, but he gets back up
[1:29:19] again. He keeps pursuing and pressing
[1:29:22] beyond his failures.
[1:29:26] Edison says, "I found 10,000 ways that
[1:29:29] don't work." We know the story that he
[1:29:31] discovers. And and he toils day and
[1:29:34] night until he has a breakthrough. And
[1:29:36] you know what that breakthrough was? It
[1:29:38] was a breakthrough out of darkness into
[1:29:39] light.
[1:29:40] And sometimes the devil wants to get you
[1:29:42] into such darkness in a place in your
[1:29:44] life, you can't see the light. Oh, but I
[1:29:47] believe for a breakthrough. I believe
[1:29:49] for a breakthrough, I believe you've got
[1:29:52] to first believe that God can break you
[1:29:54] through. You first got to believe it,
[1:29:56] then you got to confess it.
[1:29:59] Come on, somebody.
[1:30:01] Then you got to confess it. Oh, it was
[1:30:04] men like we've preached on before. Like
[1:30:06] the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orbal
[1:30:08] Wright were two bicycle mechanics,
[1:30:10] worked on bicycles, and but they had a
[1:30:13] dream. They had a dream that men can
[1:30:16] fly. In the early 1900s, it was
[1:30:19] ridiculed and laughed at and and and and
[1:30:22] you know, they they they they were put
[1:30:24] to scorn and put to shame that a man
[1:30:26] could ever fly. Government had had had
[1:30:29] financed a thousand dollar I think it
[1:30:31] was at that time, which would be equal
[1:30:33] to tens of thousands today. Educated men
[1:30:36] and scientists to discover if man could
[1:30:39] fly. You know what all their education
[1:30:41] told them? It's impossible. It'll never
[1:30:43] happen. Did that slow down two country
[1:30:46] boys from North Carolina who had no
[1:30:48] education? They had no Come on,
[1:30:50] somebody. Sometimes education gets in
[1:30:52] the way of revelation. Sometimes our
[1:30:55] intellect of what we know and we're so
[1:30:57] familiar with. But in order to to to see
[1:31:00] beyond in order to see the new world,
[1:31:03] you can't look at the existing world.
[1:31:05] You got to catch a vision.
[1:31:08] Amen.
[1:31:09] Not God can, but God will.
[1:31:12] Amen.
[1:31:12] It didn't slow them down. They developed
[1:31:14] a a flying machine. It was they they
[1:31:16] they started having this idea and just
[1:31:19] one week before the right success a
[1:31:22] promma editorial pro prominent editorial
[1:31:24] proclaimed it might take one to 10
[1:31:27] million years if it's possible for man
[1:31:30] to fly. You know what they did those
[1:31:32] right boys they started they stopped
[1:31:34] listening to the naysayers
[1:31:36] and they start looking at things that
[1:31:38] were already flying.
[1:31:40] They studied the eagle. They studied
[1:31:43] birds because what were they doing? They
[1:31:45] were they were looking they caught the
[1:31:47] vision of possibility.
[1:31:49] And they stopped at looking at what
[1:31:51] couldn't and what could. Not wasn't, but
[1:31:54] what was
[1:31:56] and they studied birds and how birds
[1:31:58] flew and glided. And they knew that this
[1:32:01] can be achievable by men. After years of
[1:32:04] painstaking experiments on remote sand
[1:32:07] dunes, it was on December 17th in 1903
[1:32:11] in Kittyhawk, North Carolina that the
[1:32:13] right flyer lifted off the ground for a
[1:32:16] grand total of 12 seconds and then it
[1:32:20] crashed.
[1:32:24] It's a lot like God does in our life. He
[1:32:26] don't just give us all the victory. He
[1:32:28] lets us get up to see what's possible
[1:32:30] just for a second and then we crash down
[1:32:33] like Peter did below the water. Oh, but
[1:32:35] let me just say to you, my brother, my
[1:32:37] sister, don't let your crash discourage
[1:32:39] you. It might have only been just for a
[1:32:41] second that you walked in victory. Let
[1:32:43] it inform you that there's a vision of
[1:32:46] possibility. Stop looking at the
[1:32:48] naysayers and look at what God can do,
[1:32:51] what he will do in your life. Yeah,
[1:32:54] it was 12 seconds, but it was humanity's
[1:32:56] first powered flight. Even that triumph
[1:32:59] was met with skepticism. Newspaper
[1:33:02] ignored the story. Observers dismissed
[1:33:04] the brief flight as insignificant. It
[1:33:06] really didn't matter. And so, you know
[1:33:08] what the Wright brothers did? They kept
[1:33:10] on going. They kept on pursuing. They
[1:33:13] kept on pressing. And they pursued five
[1:33:16] more years all in the face of naysayers.
[1:33:21] And in 1908, Wilbur Wilbur writes a
[1:33:24] letter. I love this letter so much to a
[1:33:27] a man. He's trying to express his his
[1:33:30] vision. And I I don't have it here
[1:33:31] before me, but you can go and read the
[1:33:33] letter online. Wilbur begins, I think it
[1:33:36] was, or Orville writes that letter and
[1:33:38] says, "I want to tell you I have I am
[1:33:40] afflicted with a disease of a belief
[1:33:44] that man can fly." You know, you can be
[1:33:47] afflicted with a belief. I believe
[1:33:50] believers can get afflicted with the
[1:33:52] belief. I'm not talking about doubt. So
[1:33:54] many people are afflicted by what can't
[1:33:56] happen, what won't happen, what never
[1:33:58] will happen to me. But but Wilbur said,
[1:34:01] "I'm afflicted with the belief." And he
[1:34:03] says, "And I fear that my affliction
[1:34:07] will cost me all my money and it might
[1:34:10] even cost me my life."
[1:34:15] 1908,
[1:34:21] 5 years later, he goes to France and
[1:34:25] they lift off the ground. You know how
[1:34:28] long this flight was? Two minutes.
[1:34:31] Amen.
[1:34:32] Two minutes.
[1:34:34] You know what it did? It changed the
[1:34:37] skeptics
[1:34:38] of what could never happen to what could
[1:34:41] happen.
[1:34:43] It changed the narrative of failure and
[1:34:47] failure and attempts and it'll never be.
[1:34:50] It'll never happen to me. It'll never be
[1:34:52] in my home. It'll never be in my life.
[1:34:55] It'll never happen. Miracles happen, but
[1:34:57] they'll never happen to me. Restoration
[1:34:59] happens, but it can't happen to me. It's
[1:35:00] too late. The ship's already sailed.
[1:35:02] I've just settled for what I see, and
[1:35:05] I'm okay with the world I'm living in
[1:35:07] now. But let me tell you, Christopher
[1:35:09] Columbus wasn't going to settle for the
[1:35:11] world he lived in. He was going to
[1:35:13] persevere beyond all of the naysayers
[1:35:16] and all of the skeptics, even his own
[1:35:18] men who had risked their entire life.
[1:35:22] And you know what? You know what
[1:35:23] happens? Those men start speaking a
[1:35:25] mutiny after they sail or forget for how
[1:35:27] long it was. And you know, all they
[1:35:28] could see was the seas. That's all they
[1:35:30] could see was the seas. All they could
[1:35:33] see was the waves. And they they they go
[1:35:36] on and they get to the point to where
[1:35:37] even his own soldiers, even his own I'm
[1:35:40] sorry, his own sellers, his own men
[1:35:42] begin to speak of mutiny just like
[1:35:44] David. But the Bible says David caught a
[1:35:46] vision. Something happened to David. And
[1:35:48] the scripture says it this way that
[1:35:50] David encouraged himself in the Lord.
[1:35:53] Amen.
[1:35:54] I'm talking about when you can get to a
[1:35:56] place to where you don't depend on the
[1:35:59] encouragement from a brother or a sister
[1:36:01] or a pastor or a church or a mother or a
[1:36:04] father. And God says, "Stop looking for
[1:36:06] your encouragement from those things
[1:36:08] that are around you." But it's laying
[1:36:10] right inside of you. It's got to start
[1:36:13] right here. David said, "I'm going to
[1:36:15] encourage myself in the Lord." And God
[1:36:18] gives him a God gives him a message. You
[1:36:21] shall recover all, David.
[1:36:23] Everything that you lost is going to be
[1:36:26] restored to you, David.
[1:36:29] And his men speaks of stoning him.
[1:36:33] You can imagine Columbus after he's
[1:36:35] given it all thought he was crazy. But
[1:36:38] you know what? Just 4 days later, I
[1:36:40] think it was, or two days later, they
[1:36:42] see the first sign of land.
[1:36:46] Amen.
[1:36:47] And he wasn't even looking for the US.
[1:36:49] He wasn't looking for America. He's
[1:36:51] looking for some place. I think it was
[1:36:52] in Italy or or in China. That's where he
[1:36:55] was trying to go.
[1:36:56] What he set off to discover.
[1:36:59] Actually, God had bigger plans.
[1:37:02] Come on, somebody. Sometimes we settle
[1:37:04] for the little and God's wants the
[1:37:05] great. God wants to give us so much
[1:37:08] more. And they they discover that land.
[1:37:09] Well, guess what happens? Guess what
[1:37:11] happens? Oh, yeah. It's a great
[1:37:13] discovery. My goodness. Christopher
[1:37:14] Columbus has discovered the new world.
[1:37:17] And and he discovers the the new world.
[1:37:19] You know how quickly, just overnight
[1:37:22] almost, just very quickly, it became a
[1:37:25] regular thing to travel from the old
[1:37:28] world to the new world.
[1:37:29] Yeah.
[1:37:31] It became to go back and forth. Isn't it
[1:37:34] amazing? What once was thought
[1:37:36] impossible,
[1:37:37] now everybody just accepts those Wilbur
[1:37:40] Wilbur brothers, now we don't have 12 or
[1:37:42] two minutes of flight. Man, you can go
[1:37:44] 14 hours,
[1:37:47] 15 hours on a plane.
[1:37:49] Now it's a common thing. Come on,
[1:37:52] somebody stay with me here.
[1:37:54] Now it's a common thing. It's accepted.
[1:37:56] We can do it. He was once thought crazy.
[1:38:00] But now everybody does it. Now it's just
[1:38:02] they go back and forth to the to the to
[1:38:05] the new world. He gets spices and think
[1:38:07] it was that he was after and and and he
[1:38:09] brings silver and gold and all the
[1:38:11] beauty from the from America. He brings
[1:38:14] it back and he brings it back. But you
[1:38:16] you know what happened a a after a while
[1:38:19] become as I said it became a regular
[1:38:21] thing to go back and forth. He discovers
[1:38:23] that new world he brings back all kinds
[1:38:25] of things from America the American
[1:38:27] shores. But you know what go read
[1:38:30] history. You say what did Columbus do
[1:38:32] after that brother Matt? Did he go back
[1:38:34] and just kick up his feet and retire
[1:38:36] cash in? No. He still believed there's
[1:38:40] more.
[1:38:41] Yeah. Amen. because something in him
[1:38:44] would not let him settle for where he
[1:38:47] had attained to.
[1:38:49] But like Paul said, I forget those
[1:38:51] things which are behind me and I press
[1:38:54] towards the mark of the high calling in
[1:38:57] Christ Jesus.
[1:38:59] And he wasn't going to settle with what
[1:39:01] was normal. He wasn't going to just camp
[1:39:04] down and hunker down and lose his fire,
[1:39:08] lose his passion, lose his will to
[1:39:11] discover more. But the but but history
[1:39:14] records to us that that he he after that
[1:39:17] he he doesn't it wasn't long he sets out
[1:39:19] on another journey. Surely just trying
[1:39:22] to find other places that weren't
[1:39:23] discovered. But you know what? You know
[1:39:26] what happens in Spain? the the the the
[1:39:28] the the the flare of selling a new world
[1:39:31] began to just dissipate. Noah's like,
[1:39:33] "Come on, man. Haven't you discovered
[1:39:35] enough? Just settle down. Be happy."
[1:39:37] Spain had become so so Listen, let me
[1:39:40] say this one. I hope you catch it. Spain
[1:39:42] had became so content with just going
[1:39:44] back and forth that they had lost their
[1:39:46] desire for more. Come on, friends.
[1:39:48] Sometimes we can. We didn't even know
[1:39:50] what a spiritual life was as a sinner.
[1:39:53] We didn't know what it was to be a
[1:39:55] Christian. We didn't know what it was to
[1:39:57] have a spiritual experience. Come to
[1:39:59] church, hear the preaching of the word
[1:40:01] of God, feel something pulsated in our
[1:40:03] heart, hear the praise and worship and
[1:40:05] the worship of the Holy Ghost. Man, some
[1:40:07] of us didn't know anything about that.
[1:40:09] And when we first experienced it, boy,
[1:40:11] it was like a brand new experience. It
[1:40:14] was like discovering a whole new world.
[1:40:16] And now everything has become new. But
[1:40:18] I'm afraid some of us have been content
[1:40:21] with just going to church. coming to
[1:40:23] church, that experience just begins to
[1:40:25] be so normal. Everybody goes to church
[1:40:27] and I'll come in and have my little feel
[1:40:29] and have my little social gospel and
[1:40:31] hear a good old sermon. Preacher's going
[1:40:33] to preach me happy and we'll go out to
[1:40:35] eat. Come on, friends. We don't never We
[1:40:37] can't settle for just coming to church
[1:40:40] and having regular church and regular
[1:40:43] services. Can I say there's more?
[1:40:45] There's more for us. I believe that what
[1:40:48] God wants to give us is not over. If
[1:40:51] anything, there's more waiting now than
[1:40:53] everything that God has given us in the
[1:40:55] past.
[1:40:57] It's not about settling down on what
[1:41:00] we've learned. It's about the desire for
[1:41:03] more.
[1:41:04] Amen.
[1:41:06] How many want that today?
[1:41:08] Amen.
[1:41:09] Not just to settle down in my walk with
[1:41:11] God,
[1:41:13] but to say, "Lord, there's more. There's
[1:41:16] a lot more you want to give me. a lot
[1:41:19] more you want to bring me to. Musicians,
[1:41:21] come if you could. He doesn't want us to
[1:41:24] settle down or colonize
[1:41:28] over what he's given us.
[1:41:30] But something inside of us needs to say,
[1:41:34] "Lord, I'm not going to settle
[1:41:37] for what I have. I'm going to believe."
[1:41:40] Listen, bow your heads with me just
[1:41:42] today as we close this service out.
[1:41:49] As we said, don't lose your vision
[1:41:53] for more,
[1:41:55] further, greater, greater than what God
[1:41:59] did.
[1:42:04] We settle down on what happened
[1:42:06] yesterday, thankful for it.
[1:42:09] But there's more.
[1:42:12] There's more.
[1:42:15] Can I just give you the burden of my
[1:42:17] heart? Every head bowed, please. Every
[1:42:19] eye closed, please. Just let the Lord
[1:42:22] deal with hearts here just for a moment.
[1:42:29] Yes, Lord.
[1:42:31] You got to break past
[1:42:34] those barriers.
[1:42:37] Break past what you've known.
[1:42:41] Like Edison, I've not failed. I've just
[1:42:44] found 10,000 ways that won't work.
[1:42:49] But, Brother Matt, I failed so many
[1:42:51] times. Yeah. So did he.
[1:42:54] So did every discoverer. So did every
[1:42:56] man who's ever accomplished anything for
[1:42:58] the kingdom of God. It's been a life
[1:43:00] wrought with struggle.
[1:43:04] The Bible says in Galatians 6, don't
[1:43:06] grow, let us not grow weary
[1:43:09] and welloing.
[1:43:12] Don't let us faint,
[1:43:15] get tired, and no urge to go on, but we
[1:43:20] just settle down.
[1:43:23] I'm okay with it. It's good enough for
[1:43:25] me. Lord's brought me this far, and
[1:43:28] that's good enough. Friend, don't ever
[1:43:29] let that be your testimony.
[1:43:33] But believe that God has something more
[1:43:36] for you.
[1:43:38] God has a dream of an overcoming life. A
[1:43:42] vision of an overcomer.
[1:43:46] Vision of a a as we said a place with
[1:43:50] harmony.
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:53] A place with as we said. Can you imagine
[1:43:56] that? Can you imagine here just for a
[1:43:59] moment no more of that strife in your
[1:44:03] life?
[1:44:08] That Eden represents peace.
[1:44:13] No tension.
[1:44:16] That Eden represents harmony.
[1:44:20] my
[1:44:26] a restored Eden.
[1:44:29] Now parallel that to your own life as
[1:44:31] your head bowed, eyes closed.
[1:44:34] Imagine a life with no sin, no shame, no
[1:44:39] guilt. Imagine waking up in the morning
[1:44:42] and never feeling anxious.
[1:44:44] No racing thoughts, no fear of tomorrow,
[1:44:48] no weight of yesterday. Imagine a heart
[1:44:51] free of resentment.
[1:44:53] You can have it where no bitterness
[1:44:55] lingers, no jealousy eating away at your
[1:44:58] peace that God wants to give you. No
[1:45:00] envy, no insecurity,
[1:45:03] no evil thoughts passing through your
[1:45:05] mind, creeping in, corrupting your your
[1:45:07] your daily life.
[1:45:10] No hatred that poisons you. No anger
[1:45:12] boiling beneath the surface. No
[1:45:15] discontentment, just a deep abiding
[1:45:17] satisfaction in who you are, cuz that's
[1:45:20] who God said you are. Imagine here,
[1:45:23] maybe you're not in that place of that
[1:45:25] Eden. But I'm just trying to get you to
[1:45:27] catch a vision. Catch a vision, young
[1:45:29] person. Catch a vision, Mom. Catch a
[1:45:32] vision today.
[1:45:34] Catch a vision of a life, a mind that's
[1:45:37] at rest that sleeps at night with no
[1:45:40] nightmare, no fear that you go to bed
[1:45:43] with, a soul that's in harmony with God,
[1:45:46] no guilt in your life.
[1:45:50] That's guilt suffocating.
[1:45:52] That was that life that was in Eden.
[1:45:55] That is that life that Jesus came to
[1:45:58] give you back by the power of
[1:46:01] transformation.
[1:46:03] Not just a day that will be, but
[1:46:06] something that can happen for you in
[1:46:08] your life right now.
[1:46:11] Something that God gives you and doesn't
[1:46:14] take back. You want it? You want it
[1:46:18] today?
[1:46:20] Want to say, "Lord, I've caught a vision
[1:46:22] of possibility of what can be in my
[1:46:24] life." Oh, raise that hand up. I see
[1:46:26] hands going up. Just do that to the
[1:46:29] Lord, not to brother Matt.
[1:46:31] Say, "Lord, I I'm going to I'm going to
[1:46:35] catch a vision today,
[1:46:37] a fresh vision of not what you might do,
[1:46:41] not what you could do, but I believe the
[1:46:44] God who will do, the God who will, I
[1:46:48] will. I will restore. I will give back.
[1:46:55] I you can live in that place where
[1:46:59] there's where that trouble that
[1:47:01] besetting sin that thing in your life.
[1:47:03] You can have a vision to live beyond
[1:47:05] that.
[1:47:08] Don't settle. Satan wants us just to
[1:47:10] settle in the here and now. But God was
[1:47:12] God's saying to somebody's heart today,
[1:47:15] there's more for you, child. There's
[1:47:17] more. Get up out of that ditch. Get up
[1:47:20] out of that spot in your life. that same
[1:47:23] routine of going back and forth and back
[1:47:25] and forth and oh, it just became normal.
[1:47:29] But a real Christian can never settle. A
[1:47:33] real believer can never settle. You know
[1:47:35] what history records? History says
[1:47:37] Columbus actually died blind. You know
[1:47:40] why he died blind? Cuz he navigated his
[1:47:42] boat not by maps. He navigated it by
[1:47:45] always looking at the sun. And history
[1:47:48] says he squinted his eyes so much to the
[1:47:51] new horizon cuz he never could believe
[1:47:54] that he had discovered everything.
[1:47:57] Friend, you say, "Brother Matt, what are
[1:47:58] you saying?" I'm saying that you should
[1:48:00] look into the eyes of not the su, but
[1:48:03] squint into the eyes of the s o n and
[1:48:06] look at that new horizon in your
[1:48:08] marriage, in your home, in your life, in
[1:48:10] your family, in your testimony. You need
[1:48:12] healing in your body. God can give you
[1:48:14] healing in your body. Look to that new
[1:48:16] horizon. Brother Bandham said it this
[1:48:18] way. Imagine a whole body and walk
[1:48:20] towards it. I'm afraid we've settled
[1:48:23] down and sat aside. But God wants to do
[1:48:25] so much more for us. He's restoring
[1:48:29] Eden. And it starts right here, right
[1:48:32] now. I raise my hand. I stand to my feet
[1:48:35] and I say, "Lord, restore Eden." Could
[1:48:37] you stand and say that? Lord, if
[1:48:39] restored Eden has begun, let it begin
[1:48:42] right here. Let it begin on not just my
[1:48:44] belief but my testimony, my confession.
[1:48:48] Let me start right now. Eden starts.
[1:48:51] Eden is restored to the believer. Lord
[1:48:55] Jesus.
[1:48:56] Amen.
[1:48:57] Thank you. Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:05] Thank you for that promise.
[1:49:07] Amen.
[1:49:08] Not you can, but you will.
[1:49:13] Not what might be, but what will be.
[1:49:18] You got to change the narrative
[1:49:23] that the devil wants to label you with.
[1:49:28] You got to change the label of what the
[1:49:31] Satan has tried to get you to sell you
[1:49:33] and it just accept it. Just settle down
[1:49:37] and say,
[1:49:38] "I believe
[1:49:40] what the word says. That's all that
[1:49:43] matters. I confess what he said about
[1:49:46] me. That's all that matters." Thank you,
[1:49:50] Jesus, that there's a vision of
[1:49:51] possibility in the greatest moments of
[1:49:54] failure in our life. The greatest
[1:49:56] moments when we think just Jacob did,
[1:49:59] Joseph is just dead and that dream is
[1:50:01] over. Oh, but the Bible says the spirit
[1:50:04] of Jacob was revived when he saw the
[1:50:06] evidence
[1:50:08] of a living son,
[1:50:11] Lord. And we've tasted, we've not just
[1:50:13] tasted of heaven. We've experienced it
[1:50:16] in our own soul, in our own life. And
[1:50:18] there's a vision of possibility, Lord.
[1:50:21] There's a power of transformation that
[1:50:23] can take that ruined state, that
[1:50:26] darkness that covers
[1:50:29] and light. You said, "Let there be
[1:50:32] light."
[1:50:33] Oh, your prophet tells us it it could
[1:50:35] have taken years for that to manifest,
[1:50:39] but the moment you spoke it, nothing
[1:50:42] could stop it.
[1:50:45] Many times, Lord, those promises are
[1:50:47] that way in our life. Maybe take time to
[1:50:51] manifest, but you spoke it and it's
[1:50:54] going to be. We believe it, Lord.
[1:50:57] We believe it, Jesus.
[1:51:00] I wonder if you just want to raise your
[1:51:01] hand to the Lord now and say, "God, will
[1:51:03] you start right here? Restore, rebuild,
[1:51:08] renew. Lord, if I've been like Samson,
[1:51:11] let me get my vision back. Restore.
[1:51:13] Lord, rebuild it. I'm taking it back
[1:51:16] today." As David said, I'm going to
[1:51:18] recover all that the enemy has taken
[1:51:21] from me. Both great, the Bible says, and
[1:51:24] small. His wives, his daughters, his
[1:51:27] sons. You weren't going to leave anybody
[1:51:29] out, Lord. You were going to give it all
[1:51:31] back to him.
[1:51:34] That's what you're doing, Lord.
[1:51:35] Restoration.
[1:51:37] We live in that hour of restoration,
[1:51:39] God. We live in this in the moment where
[1:51:42] you're restoring all things.
[1:51:46] Help us, Jesus. I pray you love him,
[1:51:48] friends. Love him this morning. Why
[1:51:50] don't we just worship him here? Just
[1:51:53] before we go, let's just close our eyes,
[1:51:56] raise our hands, and just sing to him.
[1:51:58] Brother Matthew go.
[1:51:59] We've been made more than
[1:52:05] Oh, yes.
[1:52:08] Overcomes
[1:52:09] in this love.
[1:52:13] Yes, Lord.
[1:52:16] We've been made
[1:52:18] victorious.
[1:52:21] Through the blood. Through the blood of
[1:52:26] Jesus.
[1:52:28] Oh, sing that like you mean it now.
[1:52:31] We've been made. We've been made
[1:52:35] coner
[1:52:38] overcomes
[1:52:40] overcomes
[1:52:43] in this. Oh, don't look to the now. Look
[1:52:46] to the guy who will we
[1:52:57] through the blood of Jesus.
[1:53:12] Yes.
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:21] We made
[1:53:24] victory
[1:53:29] through the blood of Jesus. You're
[1:53:33] worthy of it all. Could we sing that for
[1:53:35] her with the verse? You're worthy of it
[1:53:39] all.
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:45] You're worthy of it all.

[1:55:12] Sing this with me if we could.

[1:55:19] angels

[1:55:33] elders.

[1:58:11] For from you are all things
[1:58:15] and to you are all things.
[1:58:20] You deserve the glory.
[1:58:25] Give him a hand. Clap him with praise if
[1:58:26] he would.
[1:58:29] Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:32] Thank you, Jesus. We're going to let you
[1:58:33] go. Amen. And be dismissed. You love the
[1:58:36] Lord Jesus. You feel refreshed. Feel
[1:58:38] your hearts filled. Amen. If they're
[1:58:41] not, just say, "Lord, fill it up today."
[1:58:43] Amen. Don't leave out of this place
[1:58:44] empty. Amen. God can fill you. Amen.
[1:58:47] We're going to let you go. I wonder if
[1:58:49] we could try that song we taught a
[1:58:51] couple maybe a couple Wednesdays ago.
[1:58:53] Can y'all sing that? Help me. Amen.
[1:58:56] Let's try it together just as we as we
[1:58:58] go. I thought it was so good. Amen.
