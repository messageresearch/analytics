[5:19] happy to have you

[5:23] to
[5:24] invite you to stand and we'll read right
[5:26] quick um
[5:28] i want to just turn to the book of
[5:30] revelation chapter one
[5:31] we're continuing in our study on the
[5:34] entire book of revelation and we're
[5:37] sufficiently finished with um
[5:41] chapter one however we want to
[5:45] finish the connection between
[5:48] christ introducing himself in chapter
[5:51] one
[5:52] and his movement in the churches
[5:56] beginning in chapter two
[5:58] amen i trust you've been enjoying the
[6:01] sunday school class
[6:02] and uh again i remind you that we're not
[6:05] covering it exhaustively in this class
[6:07] we will be covering it exhaustively
[6:10] in the podcast i've had a lot of emails
[6:12] when is that podcast going to start well
[6:14] we're working on it trust me and all
[6:17] things are pretty much ready at this
[6:19] point
[6:20] um brother jd is out of town today so
[6:22] he's preaching for brother keith brown
[6:24] in florida want to be remembering him
[6:27] and i don't know if he took the family
[6:28] with him i don't see
[6:29] sister amy or the kids so they might all
[6:31] be with him amen
[6:33] revelation chapter 1
[6:36] and we want to just read uh from verses
[6:40] 2 verse 20 and then we'll catch verse 1
[6:42] of chapter 2 to make the connection
[6:46] the mystery of the seven stars which
[6:48] thou sowest in my right hand
[6:50] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[6:53] seven
[6:54] stars are the angels of the seven
[6:56] churches
[6:57] and the seven candlesticks which thou
[7:00] sawest
[7:01] are the seven churches verse 1 of
[7:03] chapter 2
[7:04] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[7:07] right
[7:08] these things saith he that holdeth the
[7:10] seven stars
[7:12] in his right hand who walketh in the
[7:15] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[7:18] father we commit our lesson into your
[7:21] care today now
[7:22] lord may you bless the people may you
[7:25] let it flow
[7:26] freely to them as it did to me commit
[7:29] myself into your hands for service in
[7:31] jesus name amen god bless your friends
[7:33] as you're seated
[7:43] one of the statements that we finished
[7:46] up with
[7:47] was on our last time
[7:50] was how that we dealt with god blinding
[7:54] israel and paul dealt with that quite a
[7:57] bit and i don't have
[7:58] sufficient time in the sunday school
[8:00] class to backtrack a whole lot you would
[8:02] have to get the archive
[8:03] but we just briefly we were dealing with
[8:07] the connections that paul made in the
[8:09] scriptures
[8:10] and through the book of acts chapter 13
[8:13] verse 46 and in romans 11 7
[8:16] just by reminder paul says what then
[8:19] israel hath not obtained that which he
[8:21] seeketh for
[8:23] but the election hath obtained it and
[8:25] the rest were blinded
[8:27] so we were concluding last time on how
[8:31] the reason that he blinded them was so
[8:34] that god could in fact turn from the
[8:36] jews
[8:37] to the gentiles the scripture says
[8:40] that god will take out of the people
[8:43] a bride from the gentiles
[8:46] he calls israel his wife remember
[8:50] that israel was the wife of jehovah and
[8:53] he
[8:54] calls his wife
[8:57] israel to jehovah but he calls the true
[9:00] church the bride of jesus christ and
[9:03] that's
[9:04] that has to be made made known you have
[9:06] to catch that
[9:08] and so you you can you can realize why
[9:11] there's a
[9:11] uh uh a what we would call election and
[9:15] remnant
[9:15] brother ram said in every age whether
[9:17] that would be new testament or old
[9:19] testament
[9:20] you find a remnant in every age
[9:22] certainly the old testament
[9:23] uh had its time of ages as well brother
[9:26] brennan makes that reference though he
[9:27] doesn't
[9:28] get down into the bolts of nuts and
[9:30] bolts of that too much just makes a few
[9:33] reference points that gives us some some
[9:35] kind of some land markers to
[9:37] try to put the rest of it together and
[9:40] um
[9:40] we find that in acts 15 verse 14
[9:44] simeon hath declared how god at the
[9:46] first did visit the gentiles
[9:48] to take out of them a people for his
[9:51] name because the wife
[9:53] takes the husband's name and so you see
[9:57] that
[9:57] all the way down through the bible you
[9:59] see joseph which was probably
[10:02] the best type of christ i i guess you
[10:05] could point to moses but
[10:07] i think that joseph would be the most
[10:08] complete picture
[10:10] in in certain ways uh that how that he
[10:12] was in
[10:13] exile that he was given a gentile
[10:17] bride by pharaoh he was given
[10:20] asnath who was a gentile and so we know
[10:22] that it was
[10:23] his gentile bride that was dismissed to
[10:25] the palace
[10:26] when he made himself known to the
[10:29] hundred and to
[10:30] to his brethren particularly to benjamin
[10:33] we do see a type of course in moses you
[10:35] know moses when he was in exile took
[10:38] uh a non-hebrew wife and took zipporah
[10:41] and so this this type is all through the
[10:44] scripture
[10:44] and so each letter then in revelation
[10:47] chapter 2
[10:48] and revelation chapter 3 he now begins
[10:51] to address himself
[10:53] to each messenger because and in our
[10:55] thorough
[10:56] examination of chapter 1 we were showing
[10:59] you
[11:00] how that the book of revelation being
[11:02] really more perfectly
[11:04] not exclusively but more perfectly the
[11:06] bride's book at the end time because
[11:08] john was translated to the day of the
[11:11] lord
[11:12] and so that you can see how brother
[11:14] branham comes into there
[11:15] and he talks about the ages and then he
[11:17] says you know the the
[11:19] the bride goes up at the end of chapter
[11:21] three she's not seen again
[11:22] until revelation 19 when she comes out
[11:24] as the armies of heaven however
[11:27] he takes chapter five he mentions
[11:29] specifically and of course chapter four
[11:31] and chapter five
[11:32] are you shouldn't divide them as
[11:34] separate events they're exactly the same
[11:36] event
[11:36] and so chapter four begins the process
[11:39] of opening up into chapter five and
[11:41] brother branham says he uses those
[11:44] chapter that chapter five to explain
[11:47] how he pulled it off remember that how
[11:49] he managed to get a bride
[11:51] out of the ages into a rapture and then
[11:54] of course
[11:55] from there on he's going to continue to
[11:57] demonstrate
[11:58] remember that the book of revelation is
[12:00] not like the gospels the gospels
[12:02] was christ operating christ jesus christ
[12:06] who created all things now
[12:09] operating in a human ministry as the
[12:12] redeemer as the
[12:13] as the lamb of god and he had a ministry
[12:16] there but we've showed you many times
[12:18] that god's plan was never to stay
[12:20] bottled up in a single
[12:21] man walking the source of galilee and so
[12:24] then of course you have the book of acts
[12:26] which records the
[12:27] early history of the holy ghost working
[12:29] in the church
[12:30] then when you come to the book of
[12:32] revelation we find that it's introduced
[12:34] to the church
[12:35] after paul is gone john comes back with
[12:37] it he's the last one to die
[12:39] dies of actually dies of natural causes
[12:41] as an elderly brother
[12:42] and statesman of the church and so we
[12:45] realize that it's a book of
[12:47] symbols and so what it is now
[12:50] is it's the revelation of jesus christ
[12:54] that god gave to him to show the
[12:56] churches
[12:57] this is how i'm now going to work i'm
[13:00] going to work in my body
[13:02] in the ages to come and so that's
[13:04] important that you
[13:05] understand that so we realize he begins
[13:08] speaking to the messenger of
[13:10] each age to the to the of each of the
[13:12] seven ages
[13:14] and we find out that the book is
[13:16] prophecy sealed
[13:17] and of course you you it's going to stay
[13:20] that way
[13:21] and revelation 10 4 can you give me 10 4
[13:23] josh can you find revelation 10 4 real
[13:25] quick
[13:25] just to put that up sorry to jump you i
[13:27] should have had that already you
[13:28] notified
[13:29] but we find that this book is prophecy
[13:32] sealed
[13:33] and you'll notice here uh in revelation
[13:35] 10 4 when the seven thunders had uttered
[13:37] their voices
[13:38] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[13:41] from heaven
[13:42] saying unto me seal up those things
[13:44] which the seven thunders uttered
[13:46] and write them not and so when we look
[13:49] at that we realize
[13:50] that the voice of god and this is how
[13:53] we've been understood and to understand
[13:55] it by the teachings of brother branham
[13:58] that the voice of god then is a thunder
[14:01] and so
[14:02] you know brother branham makes the
[14:03] statement when he's asked about the
[14:04] seven thunders and he says
[14:06] you know the thunders were the mysteries
[14:08] that came out of the seals
[14:09] and so of course the opening of the
[14:11] seven seals opened up the whole book
[14:13] broke all the seals and opened all the
[14:14] mysteries
[14:15] not for theology remember that it's not
[14:18] for to make you
[14:19] bet with better theology than the
[14:21] baptist but it was so that you could
[14:23] be transformed into the open word
[14:26] because that's what it's all about
[14:28] is about christ being manifest to the
[14:31] world
[14:32] through his church through his bride
[14:34] that's what the book of revelation is
[14:36] really about
[14:37] it's to give us con it's to give us
[14:39] context for
[14:41] who we are how we got here
[14:45] what what we're to do and how it's going
[14:48] to conclude
[14:49] and so the book of revelation being open
[14:51] to us that's why
[14:53] we say again that it is particularly
[14:55] with an emphasis for the bride of the
[14:57] last days so that she can
[14:59] uh qualify and quantify everything that
[15:03] is happening
[15:04] around her it's what takes the fear out
[15:05] of us amen
[15:07] it's what gives us purpose it's what
[15:09] gives us understanding it's what
[15:11] it's what opens us up to realize that
[15:13] we're not here by an accident
[15:14] our lives are are driven by the purpose
[15:17] of god
[15:18] so your life is purpose driven you don't
[15:20] own it
[15:22] see so let us be glad and rejoice for
[15:25] the bride
[15:26] hath made herself ready how did she do
[15:27] it by the un
[15:29] unsealing of this mystery and so god
[15:31] then the voice of god being a thunder he
[15:33] speaks seven
[15:34] times and how did he speak he spoke
[15:37] through
[15:37] man uh to an age he spoke seven
[15:40] times but of course it was sealed up and
[15:43] not to be understood
[15:45] uh until the end time it had to be that
[15:47] way because the church fell away
[15:49] there was certainly not sealed up to
[15:50] paul everything that paul taught he
[15:53] understood clearly the mystery of
[15:54] melchizedek he understood clearly the
[15:56] rapture of the church in cycles he
[15:58] understood clearly
[15:59] the godhead the baptism predestination
[16:01] serpent seed election
[16:03] i mean what doctrine do we have in the
[16:05] message that doesn't come from paul's
[16:07] teaching not a single one
[16:09] and so we realized that they were they
[16:11] did have the full abstract they did have
[16:13] the jubilee
[16:14] they they had um the the the mighty god
[16:18] unveiled
[16:19] but after but after the disciples fall
[16:21] away and paul falls away the church
[16:23] begins its backslide
[16:25] of course at that point the church can't
[16:27] go in the rapture christ must sit back
[16:29] down now on the throne
[16:31] he can't step forward and take his bride
[16:33] just come by his side because now she's
[16:35] a fallen woman
[16:36] and that was necessary that wasn't the
[16:39] devil's sucker-punching god
[16:41] that was necessary because that seed had
[16:44] to follow like
[16:44] christ had to go into the ground and
[16:47] come back up again
[16:48] like a phoenix from the flames now the
[16:51] one of the things that is going to make
[16:53] this last day brad unique
[16:55] uh uh unique completely unique from all
[16:58] other ages is that she is predestinated
[17:02] not to fall every age fell israel fell
[17:06] the early church fell this bride
[17:08] won't and can't the womb is already
[17:11] sealed she's already been impregnated
[17:13] with the word of god so
[17:15] so when you received the mystery of
[17:17] christ
[17:18] it already begins a transformation in
[17:20] you once a woman becomes pregnant she
[17:22] can't stop the transformation
[17:24] and man if she does that she does that
[17:26] only does that by breaking god's law
[17:28] and and murdering a child and so but the
[17:31] bride
[17:32] of christ isn't going to miscarry she's
[17:34] going to see this thing through to a
[17:36] body change
[17:38] and so we realize then that he speaks
[17:40] seven
[17:41] times and so christ you know sits down
[17:44] upon the throne
[17:44] seals the book in seven seals it's got
[17:47] to wait for the end time for elijah to
[17:48] come forward
[17:49] and break them back open to the church
[17:51] and so now
[17:53] we have been restored back to that
[17:55] perfect word the final voice to the
[17:57] final age
[17:58] because why what have i taught you
[18:00] because we've been restored
[18:02] to paul's original teaching who was the
[18:04] final voice to all the ages
[18:06] remember that nothing can be added to
[18:08] paul's teaching even paul can't add to
[18:10] it
[18:11] nothing can take away not even god could
[18:13] take away from paul's teaching
[18:15] it can't be countermanded even by god
[18:17] because god
[18:18] gave it to paul and paul was speaking it
[18:21] thus saith the lord it became scripture
[18:23] and therefore heavens and earth will
[18:25] pass away but not one word
[18:27] of god's word can ever pass away so
[18:30] the lord sealed it with an oath
[18:33] and so we find then that he brings his
[18:36] letter
[18:37] you know to each age and you see the
[18:39] pattern
[18:40] uh you see this pattern constantly where
[18:43] every age opens up how that jesus
[18:46] declares
[18:47] you know one of his manifested
[18:49] attributes and
[18:50] he he's always tying it back to this
[18:52] very first chapter it's why we've taken
[18:54] so long
[18:55] i think today's part 11 i think just on
[18:58] chapter one
[18:59] don't know that we'll need that many uh
[19:01] on on each of the ages
[19:03] maybe until we get further along but
[19:05] chapter one is so important that you
[19:07] understand what christ
[19:08] who it is and what he's doing and why
[19:10] he's doing it and what he's to
[19:11] accomplish and so
[19:12] in every age chapter one is so important
[19:15] that
[19:16] he opens every age with some type of a
[19:19] reference
[19:19] to one of his manifold attributes you're
[19:22] gonna see that then of course
[19:24] there's a condemnation uh i'm sorry
[19:27] uh well there is a condemnation to every
[19:30] age except philadelphia
[19:32] and there is a commendation to every age
[19:34] except laodicea
[19:37] you catch that so we find then that
[19:40] there's an exhortation
[19:41] there's a promise of a reward to the
[19:44] overcomer
[19:45] and and so you know jesus is going to
[19:48] address the angel
[19:49] uh of the age and he's going to give a
[19:52] description of himself it's amazing
[19:54] how that when we come down to the last
[19:57] day
[19:58] that we we remember how that we've
[20:00] taught you that
[20:01] everything uh and brother branham
[20:04] taught uh i should say brother branham
[20:06] taught us that
[20:08] that they're cumulative and they
[20:10] accumulate
[20:11] and so you see that in the pattern of
[20:13] the horse riders the white
[20:15] to the red to the black accumulates into
[20:17] the pale
[20:18] and that that also makes our age unique
[20:21] that's why it's satan's eden
[20:22] that's why he's the god of this evil age
[20:24] that those are unique
[20:26] characteristics to this age alone and so
[20:30] we we realized now it's it doesn't mean
[20:32] that it's a
[20:33] a greater mystery or a further truth
[20:36] we're not preaching another jesus in the
[20:38] end time message
[20:39] it's a restoration of the original but
[20:42] there
[20:42] is a a further manifestation because
[20:46] if if you can't see that anywhere in the
[20:49] middle just let me
[20:50] cut to the chase and point it out to you
[20:52] at the end
[20:53] we get a body change amen
[20:57] that's never happened amen right not
[20:59] universally
[21:00] not a bride not a many member bride
[21:02] who's the who's now
[21:03] the fullness of the godhead in a
[21:06] mini-membered bride as jesus
[21:08] was in a single body and so we realized
[21:11] that
[21:11] while we were not neglectful to remind
[21:13] us ourselves of enoch
[21:15] as a type of being translated but this
[21:18] will be the first time that god has ever
[21:21] brought the holy ghost on a people
[21:23] universally and transformed them at the
[21:26] molecular level
[21:27] wow and we're almost home friend
[21:30] what an hour that we live in and so
[21:34] we we realized then that that he's he's
[21:37] he it's further areas of manifestation
[21:41] that the first church would have reached
[21:44] had they not fallen away from
[21:46] so you've got to keep that in your mind
[21:48] real clear it's not a further
[21:50] another jesus or new mysteries or
[21:52] further mysteries
[21:53] there's nothing that the book of
[21:55] revelation i've said this before there's
[21:58] nothing that the
[21:59] that understanding the book of
[22:00] revelation there's nothing in it that
[22:03] reveals
[22:04] a a further understanding of god
[22:07] as far as doctrinally understanding it
[22:09] however
[22:10] paul does make a reference to looking
[22:12] through a glass darkly now that's not
[22:15] doctrine that's where people mistake
[22:17] paul's not speaking of doctrine
[22:19] he's speaking of manifestation paul
[22:21] could see that we're going to be changed
[22:23] he writes about it in a moment
[22:25] in the twinkling of an eye he had went
[22:28] up into heaven and
[22:29] he heard things that couldn't even be
[22:31] uttered so he knew it was there
[22:33] and he's preaching listen friends here's
[22:34] what's going to happen church
[22:36] that the dead in christ shall rise first
[22:38] and we which are alive and remain shall
[22:40] be caught up now he knew that was going
[22:41] to happen
[22:42] but it didn't manifest itself in his age
[22:45] you understand so that so in that in
[22:48] that way
[22:48] they looked through a glass darkly
[22:50] looking to because when you
[22:52] when you when you
[22:55] when something happens to you
[22:59] and you experience it you have a better
[23:02] understanding
[23:04] i mean you can read all the books in the
[23:06] world about what it is to have children
[23:08] but until you have them amen then what
[23:11] happens everything you understood
[23:12] theologically from reading this baby
[23:14] book
[23:15] suddenly you're going oh wow boy where
[23:18] are they shortchanging me here
[23:19] there's way more to it you know and it's
[23:22] not that greater
[23:23] it's not a greater theology but it is a
[23:26] further manifestation we're coming to
[23:29] the time frames
[23:30] and that that that that that that darkly
[23:33] of that manifestation
[23:34] is getting brighter and brighter and
[23:36] brighter because we've already came to
[23:37] the
[23:38] sun rising the sun is already up we're
[23:40] already under full light and you know
[23:42] what that's doing
[23:43] that's transforming you into full light
[23:46] what's it going to do it's going to
[23:47] change you at the atoms it's going to
[23:50] change you at the molecular level
[23:52] we are literally uh eating our way to
[23:55] a body change because you assimilate you
[23:57] are what you eat
[23:59] you are what you feed on amen
[24:03] so so we realized then that this pattern
[24:06] as i've said if we look at revelation 2
[24:08] 1 i've got nine minutes to close up here
[24:10] and that's using up my five minutes of
[24:12] overtime um
[24:13] we find that revelation 2 1. watch unto
[24:16] the angel of the church of ephesus
[24:18] right these things saith he
[24:21] ah that holdeth the seven stars in his
[24:24] right hand
[24:25] now this is the same attribute described
[24:28] in revelation 1 13.
[24:30] so you see when he comes even comes into
[24:32] chapter two he connects back they go
[24:34] it's still me right now it's still me
[24:37] in you see revelation 2 1
[24:40] all right now watch this commendation i
[24:43] know thy works
[24:45] and thy labor and thy patience and how
[24:47] thou canst not bear them which are evil
[24:49] has tried them which say they are
[24:51] apostles and are not and has
[24:53] found them to be liars
[24:56] and so so here you see that the bride
[24:59] is demonstrating catch it now
[25:02] he's he's commending the age that
[25:06] that you have caught liars in your midst
[25:10] and you've identified them and you were
[25:13] right
[25:14] well done and god and so we realized
[25:17] then that the bride
[25:19] is demonstrating that he the same one in
[25:22] chapter one
[25:24] is actively operating through
[25:27] yes amen because he didn't come down and
[25:29] say and
[25:30] send a prophet in and say hey that one's
[25:33] wrong that one's a liar that one says
[25:34] he's a jew he's really not
[25:36] god didn't need to do that the bride had
[25:38] a discernment of spirit within her
[25:40] and so she's proving by her life that
[25:44] she is an
[25:44] active manifestation in chapter two of
[25:48] what he said he would be in chapter one
[25:50] amen oh and that's where we're at my
[25:53] friend so now watch
[25:54] uh verse um three and has
[25:58] borne two uh chapter two verse three and
[26:00] has borne
[26:02] and has patience and for my name's sake
[26:05] uh has labored and has not fainted so
[26:08] he's commending them
[26:10] two four to six watch this here's the
[26:12] complaint
[26:13] notice the complaint all right uh he had
[26:15] a common accommodation now he's got a
[26:17] complaint nevertheless
[26:18] i have somewhat against thee because
[26:20] thou has left my first love
[26:22] remember therefore from whence thou art
[26:25] fallen and repent and do
[26:27] the first works or else i will come to
[26:29] thee quickly
[26:30] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[26:32] his place except thou repent
[26:33] but this thou hast thou thou hatest the
[26:36] deeds of the nicolaitans
[26:38] which i also hate all right 2 7. all
[26:41] right now watch
[26:42] then there's then there's this promise
[26:44] of the reward to the overcomer
[26:46] he that hath in here let him hear what
[26:48] the spirit saith unto the churches
[26:50] to him that overcometh will i give to
[26:52] eat of the tree of life
[26:53] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[26:54] god now the sumerian age
[26:56] he does the same thing you know 2 8 unto
[26:59] the angel of the church of smyrna
[27:01] right these things say at the first and
[27:03] the last and was
[27:04] which was dead in his life there he is
[27:06] back in chapter 1
[27:07] verse 17 again you see how he's
[27:10] constantly connecting to say
[27:11] it's not ever going to be you it's going
[27:13] to be me in you
[27:15] that's the secret yes that's what
[27:17] separates you from denominationalism and
[27:19] organized religion
[27:20] that that is a man-made system this is a
[27:23] god-made thing
[27:24] amen i'm not supposed to be preaching on
[27:27] sunday school for a while but i get
[27:28] excited
[27:30] oh i got four minutes all right so
[27:34] so we you find it costly 2 9 jesus
[27:36] introduces himself
[27:38] and and he's commending you know uh
[27:41] on their their condition look i i know
[27:44] your works and tribulation and poverty
[27:46] thou art rich and i know the blasphemy
[27:48] them which say they're jews and are not
[27:49] the synagogue of satan
[27:51] and so and then he goes into 10 to 11
[27:54] starts
[27:54] starts you know giving them a
[27:56] commendation see
[27:57] fear none of those things which thou
[27:59] shalt suffer the devil cast some of you
[28:01] into prison he may be tried slept
[28:02] tribulation 10 days
[28:04] we'll deal with that when we get into
[28:05] the church age itself be thou faithful
[28:07] unto death i'll give you the crown of
[28:08] life he that hath and here let him hear
[28:10] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[28:12] so there it is again this promise to the
[28:15] overcomer
[28:16] and we've shown how that that it is
[28:20] that it is cumulative just like just
[28:23] like
[28:23] white horse red horse black horse yeah
[28:26] lion
[28:27] ox man eagle and so it accumulates in
[28:32] each age
[28:32] even the wrath pours over from age to
[28:34] age because the cup of iniquity is not
[28:37] full
[28:38] and so every age he opens a seal
[28:41] partially drops a mystery down a
[28:43] messenger catches it
[28:45] there it goes forth gathers a people
[28:47] there's a rejection
[28:48] and then a temporary judgment is dropped
[28:50] and the cup of iniquity not the full cup
[28:52] not the tribulation period but it pours
[28:55] over into the next stage and just keeps
[28:57] accumulating
[28:58] keeps accumulating till we come to the
[29:00] last where we're literally in satan's
[29:02] eden
[29:03] amen say my we're in trouble no we're
[29:05] not because we have the mighty god
[29:07] unveiled back among us and he's in you
[29:11] hallelujah don't doubt that he's in you
[29:14] he's well able
[29:15] to handle this age i'm here to tell you
[29:17] friends if you'll keep the flus cleaned
[29:19] out and keep your heart pure
[29:21] god in you is able to handle anything
[29:23] you can face
[29:25] amen amen amen believe that
[29:28] so he's certainly able to do that my we
[29:31] want to we want to have the sword with
[29:33] the two edges and so
[29:35] a lot more to say on that coming forward
[29:37] amen but
[29:38] you better have that sword with two
[29:40] edges i'll just say that friends because
[29:42] that's the only thing that'll stop a
[29:43] devil
[29:45] don't be out here wielding a butter
[29:47] knife
[29:49] that might be fine for spreading peanut
[29:51] butter but that ain't gonna stop a devil
[29:53] that ain't going to stop him from taking
[29:55] your home and your family and your
[29:56] marriage and your finances and your
[29:58] health
[29:58] you're going to need the sword with two
[30:00] edges
[30:01] hallelujah and you're going to find that
[30:03] that's christ operating through you just
[30:05] as well
[30:06] all right i got to close so we we we we
[30:09] can see then that this cumulative
[30:11] this cumulative uh overcoming and that's
[30:14] a beautiful thing
[30:15] let me catch that just before we close i
[30:17] think i may have hit it before
[30:18] remember friends that that everything
[30:22] that they had to overcome in each age
[30:25] and they got a reward
[30:26] our our reward of the last day is that
[30:28] we'll be granted to eat of the tree of
[30:30] life have a crown amen
[30:32] and be seated with christ to him that
[30:34] overcometh will i grant
[30:36] to sit with me in my throne see and you
[30:39] and you have access to the to the tree
[30:41] of life and so
[30:42] so we realized then that that you say
[30:44] well what is what is it that we have
[30:47] to overcome brother jason you've got one
[30:49] thing left only one
[30:50] you know why because cumulatively
[30:54] accumulatively you have already overcome
[30:57] everything the ages have overcome i've
[31:00] already come to
[31:01] overcome the white horse rider he can't
[31:04] fool me
[31:05] i came out of her my people amen
[31:08] we've already overcome the red horse
[31:10] rider we've already come the black horse
[31:12] we've already overcome denominational
[31:14] systems
[31:14] the last thing that we've got to
[31:16] overcome
[31:18] in this age is to overcome the deception
[31:21] that would so strong it would deceive
[31:24] the very elected if possible
[31:27] i'm here to tell you if you're a
[31:28] believer today you've already overcome
[31:32] amen amen you already have understood
[31:34] and overcome and the only
[31:36] thing we're doing here is daily allowing
[31:39] christ
[31:39] to live more and more in our lives god
[31:42] bless you you're dismissed
[31:47] hallelujah
