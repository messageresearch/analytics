[12:13] Joyful noise. Just a little reminder,
[12:16] there's uh no food allowed in the
[12:18] sanctuary. If you got to feed your
[12:19] little ones, it's got to be some kind of
[12:21] dry, inconspicuous food.
[12:24] so that
[12:26] we don't get a mess. We have some chairs
[12:28] that are a little bit contrary because
[12:32] there's food other than like dry cereal
[12:34] and stuff we got on them. Okay,
[12:37] I'm done with that. God bless you all.
[12:40] Let's pray.
[12:42] Father,
[12:43] I know that in the hearts of each and
[12:45] everyone,
[12:48] there's requests, there's burdens,
[12:51] the burdens of life. Father,
[12:54] I lift them up to you. Father, in the
[12:57] name of Jesus Christ, as well as my own,
[13:01] I pray for each and everyone today that
[13:03] we be able to get all that you got for
[13:05] us. Father, you'd open your word and we
[13:08] would open our hearts to receive what
[13:10] you'd have for us. Father,
[13:13] may the anointing not just be
[13:16] a jump and a shout,
[13:19] but Father would be a springing that
[13:22] seed to life to live a life
[13:26] that would reflect yours. We love you
[13:29] this morning, Father. We praise you,
[13:31] Jesus.
[13:32] We come to collect the tithes and
[13:34] offerings. I pray that you would bless a
[13:37] cheerful giver, Father.
[13:40] Lord, there'll be a man to stand behind
[13:42] this desk,
[13:44] surrendering himself to your anointing
[13:46] in your spirit that you would guide the
[13:48] words that would come from him
[13:51] for that is what you ordained before the
[13:53] foundation of the world. Father,
[13:56] you gave a five-fold ministry to guide
[13:59] your children. We respect and honor that
[14:02] this morning, Father. Those that are
[14:05] streaming, I pray that you would bless
[14:07] them. And Lord, we pray for our sick and
[14:10] needy this morning, those that are
[14:12] afflicted. We lift them up to you,
[14:15] Father, praying that you would touch
[14:16] their bodies,
[14:18] that you'd heal them, sounding well. As
[14:22] we collect the tithes and offers, I pray
[14:23] that you bless the cheerful giver.
[14:25] Father, bless your children. We pray in
[14:27] Jesus name. Amen.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:34] Amen. Won't you turn and greet your
[14:35] brother and sister. Amen. Just say God
[14:37] bless you this morning and thank you

[24:50] the furnace thrown in the lion's den.
[24:54] Left for dead in the dungeon. I face my
[24:57] red sea time and again, but through the
[25:00] trials the Lord has taught me. I won't
[25:02] escape if I complain, but he'll deliver
[25:06] every time. I praise him through the
[25:09] pain.
[25:11] I just come out praising.
[25:15] Stronger than I've ever been. Flying
[25:18] high up there with the eagles on the
[25:21] breeze of a second wind. Oh, anybody can
[25:26] sing and smile, standing in the choir.
[25:29] So Lord, thank you for the song you
[25:31] taught me. In the storm and through the
[25:34] fire, beneath the waves and between the
[25:37] tears, when I should have gone crazy, I
[25:41] just came out praising.
[25:48] I know you're on the brink of giving up
[25:51] and giving in.
[25:53] You're weary and discouraged and tired
[25:56] of trying to understand. But this trial
[25:59] wasn't meant to break you. It only came
[26:02] to make you strong. You might have gone
[26:05] in weak and crying, but you'll come out
[26:08] with a song.
[26:11] You're going to come out praising,
[26:15] stronger than you've ever been. Flying
[26:18] high up there with the eagles on the
[26:21] breeze of a second wind. Oh, anybody can
[26:25] sing and smile. Standing in a choir. So
[26:29] Lord, thank you for the song you taught
[26:31] me. In the storm and through the fire,
[26:34] beneath the waves and beneath the tears,
[26:37] when I should have gone crazy, I just
[26:40] came out crazy.
[26:44] God won't let this trial get the best of
[26:48] me
[26:50] because he said it's only a test for me.
[26:57] I went in broke going to come out
[27:00] wealthy. Went in sick going to come out
[27:02] healthy. Went in bound coming out
[27:05] released. Went in worried but now I got
[27:08] feast. Went in confused but now my
[27:10] mind's brand new. with it complaining,
[27:14] but I'm coming out praising.
[27:20] I'm going to come out crazy,
[27:24] stronger than I've ever been. Flying
[27:27] high up there with the eagles on the
[27:30] breeze of a second wind. Oh, anybody can
[27:34] sing and smile, standing in a choir. So
[27:38] Lord, thank you for the song you taught
[27:40] me. In the storm and through the fire,
[27:43] beneath the waves and beneath the tears,
[27:46] when I should have gone crazy,
[27:49] I just came out praising.
[27:53] Stronger than I've ever been. Flying
[27:55] high up there with the eagles on the
[27:58] breeze of a second wind. Wo! Anybody can
[28:03] sing and smile, standing in a choir. So
[28:07] Lord, thank you for the song you taught
[28:09] me. In the storm and through the fire,
[28:12] beneath the waves, in between the tears,
[28:15] when I could have gone crazy,
[28:17] I just came out crazy.
[28:23] Oh, came out praising.
[28:29] I came out praising.

[28:51] her. Excuse me. Sister Amber, she come.
[28:53] Let's give her a hand. Amen.
[29:28] Peace
[29:30] like a river
[29:34] attendeth
[29:36] my way.
[29:40] When sorrows
[29:44] like sea
[29:46] below
[29:48] roll,
[29:54] whatever
[29:59] my life,
[30:02] thou hast taugh me
[30:07] to Say
[30:10] it is well.

[30:34] with my soul.
[30:41] It is well.
[30:45] It is well
[30:48] with
[30:50] my soul.
[30:57] Though Satan
[31:01] should buff
[31:03] it, though trials
[31:08] should come,
[31:12] let it bless. Let
[31:16] assure
[31:18] us
[31:20] come true
[31:26] that Christ
[31:29] has regarded
[31:33] my helplessness
[31:39] and has shed
[31:43] his own blood
[31:46] for
[31:47] my soul
[31:52] and it is well
[32:00] with my soul.
[32:07] It is well.
[32:11] It is well
[32:14] with
[32:16] my soul
[32:21] and it
[32:23] is well
[32:29] with my soul.

[33:03] him a hand.

[33:32] anymore. The last one. My goodness.
[33:40] We're almost home. Amen.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; As I look back down the pathway up the
[33:54] mountain, I have trod weary worn and
[33:58] feet a little sore.
[34:01] Thought by now I'd be much further up
[34:04] the road than where I am. I've cast
[34:06] aside some weight. I must do so much
[34:09] more.
[34:11] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[34:13] precious time.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Setting weight with haste. I will
[34:18] swiftly cast aside.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[34:26] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[34:29] done. Oft
[34:39] gaze across the valley of decision where
[34:42] I was and thank the Lord he led me from
[34:46] that place.
[34:49] The heights I've gained are greater than
[34:51] were all my yesterdays. But I must press
[34:54] on to see my Savior's face. There's no
[34:59] time to waste my fleeting precious time.
[35:04] Be setting weight with haste. I will
[35:06] swiftly cast aside.
[35:10] No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[35:14] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[35:17] home.
[35:30] When I reach those gates of glory, only
[35:34] then will I take rest. But the first
[35:37] thing I will do when I get home,
[35:41] I'll crawl up to my Jesus and I'll weep
[35:45] down at his feet. My source of joy, the
[35:49] savior of my soul.
[35:54] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[35:57] precious time.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Setting weight with haste. I will
[36:02] swiftly cast aside.
[36:05] No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[36:10] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[36:13] home.
[36:15] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[36:17] precious time.
[36:20] Setting weight with haze. I will swiftly
[36:23] cast aside.
[36:26] No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[36:31] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[36:34] done.
[36:38] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[36:41] home.
[36:45] I can hardly wait. I know.
[36:51] I'm almost home.
[36:59] Amen.

[43:31] talking this morning. We're going to
[43:32] keep praying for sister Kathy. She's
[43:34] still real weak. I said, "But brother
[43:35] Jack, the devil ain't nobody." He still
[43:37] ain't nobody. Amen. I thought, "Brother
[43:39] Jack going to come through the phone on
[43:40] me." Amen.
[43:44] Amen. That's the truth. Not saying he's
[43:47] not real. Don't you ever think that. But
[43:50] when we say that, it just simply means
[43:52] he has no authority over our lives. He
[43:54] makes no decisions.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; You just remember that. I don't care
[43:57] what you're going through. Satan has no
[43:59] jurisdiction to make decisions about
[44:01] your life.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; My life, my times, as David said, are in
[44:05] God's hands.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; God, my father's alone. And so, whatever
[44:09] my father allows to come my way, I'll
[44:12] just uh follow Peter's instructions and
[44:14] I won't even think it's strange.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around and shake hands with
[44:18] somebody standing near you. Say, "God
[44:20] bless you. Happy to have you in the
[44:22] house of the Lord." Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[44:36] Want to take the sixth and what I think
[44:38] will be the final installment in our
[44:41] series on demonology in the spiritual
[44:43] realm. And um I really don't want to let
[44:47] me let me say what I want to do and what
[44:49] I don't want to do. What I would like to
[44:51] do today is just take a very methodical
[44:55] uh um kind of and I know people are
[44:58] going to brother Paul, you're going to
[44:59] hear them. They're going to laugh at me
[45:00] because they know I'm not good at that.
[45:02] I get preaching and I forget that I want
[45:04] to go slow.
[45:06] Amen. But it just gets delicious and I
[45:08] just can't Amen. I just uh get excited.
[45:11] Amen. But I love it. I love the word and
[45:14] I love what it's done in my life and I'm
[45:16] grateful to God. I was this morning
[45:18] pulling my Bible out of my briefcase and
[45:20] just held it over my heart and said,
[45:22] "Lord, what would I do if you hadn't
[45:25] revealed this to me and opened this
[45:26] book? Oh my goodness, I'd just be in
[45:29] line with 33,000 other different
[45:31] versions of the gospel. I'm glad to know
[45:34] that we have the revealed word in this
[45:36] hour." And uh he didn't have to open my
[45:39] eyes as brother Leno sings. He could
[45:41] have easily passed me by.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; The age I was living in was wretched
[45:46] poor and blind. But I heard recognizing
[45:49] your day.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Serpent seed, perfect faith, the breach,
[45:54] and the message of grace. Lord, I thank
[45:57] thee. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. So,
[46:01] we're going to take this today, and I u
[46:04] what I what I don't want to do is is
[46:06] rehearse and recount what we've learned
[46:08] already. We've learned quite a bit in
[46:10] this series and it's all been practical
[46:13] instructions on how to live an
[46:15] overcoming life. So, go back and catch
[46:17] the series. It'll put strength in you. I
[46:19] promise you, it's helped me a lot and
[46:21] I've had a good bit of feedback, amen,
[46:23] from around the world, people enjoying
[46:26] it. And I have enjoyed it. Amen. It's
[46:28] meant a lot to me. I'm grateful to the
[46:30] Lord for it. And you know it's um there
[46:33] there's a method a real scriptural way
[46:37] to overcome in this world and overcome
[46:40] you must. Amen. Now the Lord has already
[46:42] overcome and given you the chance to
[46:45] overcome. Without him doing that you
[46:47] wouldn't even have a chance. But there's
[46:49] things in our lives the prophet taught
[46:51] us that he's not going to overcome that
[46:53] for you. You're going to have to
[46:54] overcome it. He'll help you. He'll stand
[46:57] behind his promises. How many know that
[46:59] his promises are yay and amen?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And he will keep all of his promises.
[47:04] I've never seen a promise of God fail.
[47:07] I've had God fulfilling his promises in
[47:10] way in ways I didn't expect
[47:13] &gt;&gt; and ways I didn't understand.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; But it, you know, didn't take too long
[47:17] downstream to look back and go, "Yeah,
[47:20] he was right. Of course, he was right."
[47:22] You know, all along he knew father truly
[47:25] knew best. And I I wouldn't I wouldn't
[47:28] trade it because uh it's made me what I
[47:30] am. And uh you have been made for this
[47:34] hour, this moment, friends. It's
[47:35] crossing over time. And the ages have uh
[47:38] been, you know, we're at the
[47:40] consummation of all things. He only had
[47:42] seven stars in his right hand.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; There were only seven lampstands that
[47:47] the son of God was walking in the midst
[47:49] of. Friends, there's not coming another
[47:50] one. You are the last generation that
[47:53] will ever be on earth.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are the final voice to
[47:57] the final age. And so I want to run my
[48:00] race well. I want to I want to hit every
[48:03] target. I want to I want to do it well.
[48:06] I want to go forward and be successful.
[48:09] Not in a s not not in pride. The more
[48:12] victorious I am, the more humility I
[48:14] feel because I'm aware. And we would all
[48:18] say at times we are painfully aware that
[48:22] if he had not left us a seed, we too
[48:25] would be allto together like unto Sodom
[48:27] and Gomorrah. So it's all about him and
[48:30] we're grateful for that. God bless you
[48:32] today.
[48:34] So I I want to stay methodical. I don't
[48:37] want to have to rehearse all the
[48:39] different things um that we've learned.
[48:42] I want to uh come to these last thoughts
[48:44] that have been on my heart. Now, Luke
[48:47] chapter 14
[48:49] and verse uh 16. I'm not going to be
[48:52] able to read Luke out of Hosea, that's
[48:54] for sure.
[48:57] Amen.
[49:00] Luke 14:16-
[49:03] 24.
[49:05] Oh, and there's other I think I've
[49:07] greeted my visitors. God bless you.
[49:08] We're happy to have you today. Luke
[49:10] 14:16-
[49:12] 24.
[49:16] Then said he unto him,
[49:19] "A certain man made a great supper, and
[49:21] bade many, and sent his servant at
[49:24] supper time to say to them that were
[49:26] bidden, Come, for all things are now
[49:29] ready." And they all with one consent
[49:33] began to make excuse.
[49:36] The first said unto him, I have bought a
[49:38] piece of ground and I must need to go
[49:41] see it. I pray thee have me excused. My
[49:45] business is just more important than my
[49:47] soul.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; I was just reading between the lines
[49:51] there. Sorry.
[49:53] And another said, I have bought five
[49:56] yolk of oxen and I go to prove them. I
[50:00] pray thee, have me excused. And another
[50:03] said, I have married a wife and
[50:05] therefore I cannot come. So that servant
[50:08] came and showed his lord these things.
[50:10] Then the master of the house being angry
[50:13] said unto said to his servant, "Go out
[50:16] quickly into the streets and lanes of
[50:19] the city." See, it had to be quickly
[50:22] because this is the end time. The
[50:24] scriptures is being personified right
[50:27] now in real time.
[50:29] Go out quickly into the streets and
[50:32] lanes of the city and bring in hither
[50:35] the poor and the maimed and the halt and
[50:37] the blind. And the servant said, Lord,
[50:40] it is done as thou has commanded, and
[50:42] yet there is room. And the Lord said
[50:45] unto the servant, "Go out into the
[50:47] highways and hedges, and compel them to
[50:50] come in that my house may be filled. For
[50:54] I say unto you, that none of those men
[50:57] which were bidden shall taste of my
[50:59] supper. Um, for those of you who are
[51:03] tape listeners, you'll recognize that as
[51:05] brother Brandham's text for, is your
[51:07] life worthy of the gospel. Let's pray.
[51:14] Master, we're thanking you for this time
[51:18] now to come to your word. We're grateful
[51:20] for all of the gathering of the people
[51:22] and the songs and the worship. Now we
[51:25] come to that most important part and
[51:27] that is the delivery of eternal life
[51:29] through the preaching of the word. There
[51:31] is nothing more important. Lord, I pray
[51:34] that you will give us hearing hearts
[51:36] today and help me now be with my heart
[51:39] and mind as I try to come to these po
[51:42] points. I don't want to miss even one of
[51:44] them, Lord. I don't have many, but
[51:46] they're vital. And I want to fully um
[51:51] fully delve in and and so that I can
[51:54] communicate the burden you've laid on my
[51:57] heart, a burden of the word for the
[52:00] people. Lord, may it be so. I commit it
[52:02] to you. I commit myself into your hands
[52:06] for the sake of your kingdom and all
[52:08] things, Lord, of your word in Jesus
[52:10] name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You
[52:13] can be seated.
[52:25] Gideon, if you'll give me um St. John
[52:28] chapter 15,
[52:30] I want to look at a couple of verses
[52:33] there. Some time back, we preached on on
[52:37] abiding in Christ. And not going to go
[52:40] back today.
[52:42] I felt tempted to go back and pull up
[52:44] some points from that. It was such a
[52:48] really for for last year, it was one of
[52:50] the hallmarks for me of all the things I
[52:52] preached on. Amen. Abiding in Christ was
[52:56] so important to me personally. Seemed to
[52:59] help a lot of people and I was so
[53:00] grateful for that. But I resisted that
[53:03] today because I'm just not going to let
[53:05] myself get pulled away from the material
[53:07] I I'm determined to cover today. And I
[53:10] believe the Lord will help me because I
[53:11] believe I'm following his leadership.
[53:15] But St. John 15 is an easy passage for
[53:18] me to turn to because St. John 15 and
[53:21] St. John 17 are probably certainly my
[53:25] favorite passages in the all the
[53:27] gospels. St. John 17 may be my favorite
[53:30] chapter in the entire Bible. Um if if
[53:34] there's other ones there, they're
[53:35] they're real close there. But St. John
[53:37] 17 because he Jesus was praying for me
[53:40] there he was praying for you praying
[53:43] said I pray not for the world but those
[53:45] thou hast given me. See and so thine
[53:48] they were. See and thou gavest them me
[53:51] and I have gave them thy word.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Here I go. Okay, calm down.
[53:58] Let me
[54:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:04] Amen. St. John 15 verse one.
[54:09] I am the true vine. So if he if he's a
[54:12] true one, there's got to be false ones.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; That's the first thing.
[54:16] I want to avoid the false ones.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; I want the true one. Problem is there's
[54:21] a lot of false ones.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; There's only one true one.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; See, so I can tell you today, what are
[54:27] your odds of finding it? Less than zero.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Except he left us a seed. Except the
[54:34] Holy Spirit revealed himself to you and
[54:36] I, there'd be no chance for you to find
[54:38] it. See, I am the true vine, and my
[54:42] father is the husbandman.
[54:45] Every branch in me that beareth not
[54:49] fruit, he taketh away, and every branch
[54:52] that beareth fruit,
[54:55] he purgeth it, that it may bring forth
[54:58] more fruit. So when you bring forth a
[55:01] lot of fruit, he's not going to send you
[55:04] on vacation. He's going to purge you so
[55:05] you bring forth even more fruit. I
[55:08] promise you'll be happy for it on the
[55:10] other side.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You won't think you've missed out on the
[55:14] other side. It's the world that's going
[55:16] to miss out.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; He purgeth it that it may bring forth
[55:21] more fruit. Now ye are clean. Catch this
[55:25] third verse. Here's the whole reason I
[55:28] wanted to
[55:30] look at St. John 15. Now ye are clean
[55:34] through the word which I have spoken to
[55:37] you. We've told you so many times and
[55:39] proved it throughout the scriptures that
[55:42] we that a man is born again by the
[55:47] spirit of God and that gives him right
[55:49] standing with God. You understand? and
[55:52] and no man from Genesis to Revelation or
[55:56] all through the church history, no man
[55:58] or woman ever found right standing in
[56:01] the presence of God by denying part of
[56:04] his word.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; So the only way you will ever come to a
[56:08] right standing and be justified as
[56:11] though you never sinned in the first
[56:13] place and filled with the Holy Ghost is
[56:16] you will say amen to every word. And
[56:19] that is how the new birth comes. You're
[56:22] born again by the spirit that comes
[56:24] through the word of God. We've proven
[56:26] that so many times over and over again.
[56:29] You're clean through the word which I
[56:32] have spoken unto you. Brother Diggs did
[56:34] some wonderful speaking of the word to
[56:37] us Wednesday night. And I I was watching
[56:39] the Lord give a lot of people a lot of
[56:42] needs. I had a list of needs. He gave
[56:44] them to me. He gave them to you. I was
[56:47] thankful that the Lord was handing out.
[56:50] Amen. and and coming by and handing out
[56:52] handfuls of blessing and purpose and
[56:55] keeping his word. And I've had
[56:56] testimonies already uh some pretty
[56:59] miraculous ones. Um you know uh my my
[57:02] own wife and my own daughter-in-law said
[57:04] that when brother Diggs this isn't this
[57:07] isn't sensationalism. This is just
[57:08] actually real that when brother Diggs
[57:11] came by and preaching and took them by
[57:14] the hand, my wife said it felt like
[57:17] electricity went from all down to her
[57:19] bottom of her feet. Sister Rachel said
[57:21] the exact same thing. Never felt
[57:22] anything like that in their life. And
[57:24] the Lord was meeting the need that they
[57:25] had.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; He's not here as a circus to show off.
[57:28] That's not what he is. This isn't Barnam
[57:30] and Bailey. We're not We don't chase
[57:32] sensations. But I do know that he keeps
[57:35] his word.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And I do know that signs follow the
[57:39] believers. And I do know that devils run
[57:42] when when the word goes forward and and
[57:44] people believe it.
[57:47] So I, you know, and I I know that the
[57:50] Lord was delivering a lot of people of a
[57:52] lot of things and cleaning you up by the
[57:54] word. See, you're washed clean by the
[57:57] washing of the water of the word.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; But I want to just make a statement that
[58:02] I'm going to circle back to later. I
[58:04] don't want to get in the trenches of it
[58:05] yet, but I want you to understand that
[58:08] that Satan knows how to retreat.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; He knows how to survive to fight another
[58:15] day. That's right.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. I just want that in your mind so
[58:21] that now you are clean. But when he goes
[58:25] into dry places, if he comes back and
[58:28] finds that area that he used to occupy
[58:30] in your life, I'm talking about
[58:32] believers,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Where he occupied things in your life
[58:35] and hel held sway over you AND GOD
[58:38] CLEANED YOU AND DROVE HIM OFF. I'm here
[58:40] to tell you, you better fill that up
[58:42] with Jesus. Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Whatever
[58:45] whatever you'll empty out of the world
[58:47] and and Christ will come in and fill up
[58:50] that spot. If you don't do that, Satan
[58:52] knows how to survive
[58:54] &gt;&gt; to fight another day." See, this is this
[58:57] is what what what Legion did. I have
[59:00] little doubt that he, you know, he every
[59:03] time that he didn't fill it up with the
[59:05] right things and the enemy came back and
[59:07] every time it got worse and worse until
[59:10] finally he crossed the Rubicon and he
[59:12] couldn't come back it from it anymore.
[59:15] And it's like the the the proverbial
[59:17] snowball rolling down the hill and you
[59:19] can hold it back for a while, but after
[59:22] a while it gets so big you can't hold it
[59:24] back anymore. I'm here to tell you
[59:26] something, friends. That's a miserable
[59:28] life for a believer. Let the Holy Spirit
[59:30] cleanse your heart and fill up with the
[59:32] spirit of God and you can have victory
[59:35] from from this day forward all the way
[59:38] TO THE RAPTURE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm a Christian because I
[59:43] want to enjoy his life.
[59:49] So he says in that third verse, you are
[59:52] you you are clean through the word which
[59:56] I've spoken to you. SO NOW QUITE
[59:58] NATURALLY HIS NEXT WORD WOULD BE abide
[1:00:02] in me and I in you. What else do you
[1:00:04] think he would say? See you're clean
[1:00:06] through the word. Now abide in me
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; and I in you. As the branch cannot bear
[1:00:12] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[1:00:14] vine. No more can you except you abide
[1:00:15] in me. So the third verse from the
[1:00:18] amplified says that ye are cleansed and
[1:00:22] pruned already because of the word which
[1:00:26] I have given you the teachings I have
[1:00:29] discussed with you. Dwell in me and I
[1:00:32] will dwell in you. Live in me and I will
[1:00:36] live in you.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God. IS
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; THAT A BEAUTIFUL PROMISE? AND YOU KNOW
[1:00:41] these disciples at this moment are not
[1:00:44] yet even converted by the Holy Ghost but
[1:00:46] they are believers
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS HAS BREATHED on them
[1:00:50] POTENTIALLY GIVING THEM THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:00:52] IT YOU KNOW AND SAYING RECEIVE YOU THE
[1:00:55] HOLY GHOST AND THEY'RE BELIEVING.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; So they're clean through THE WORD. AND
[1:01:01] SO NOW HE'S SAYING YOU KNOW YOU'RE
[1:01:03] YOU'RE ALREADY CLEANED. You're already
[1:01:05] pruned. YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO
[1:01:07] MORE. THE HOLY GHOST WASN'T YET GIVEN AT
[1:01:09] THAT MOMENT, BUT THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR
[1:01:13] AN overcomer's life. Um, 7 days a week,
[1:01:17] 365 days a year. I can tell you that if
[1:01:21] you do this, you'll succeed. And if you
[1:01:23] don't, you won't. Full stop. Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; At whatever level you do not surrender
[1:01:29] out of your life and FILL THAT UP WITH
[1:01:31] CHRIST, Satan will doggedly dog you and
[1:01:34] have control of that and he WILL NEVER
[1:01:37] BE SATISFIED. HE'LL GO FOR MORE AND MORE
[1:01:39] INCHES AND MORE AND inches turn to feet
[1:01:41] and feet turn to yards AND THE NEXT
[1:01:43] THING YOU KNOW HE'S GOT MILES
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; OF YOUR LIFE AND HE'LL STAY THERE FOR
[1:01:48] YEARS. That's right.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; It's a miserable place for a child of
[1:01:55] God.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You are cleansed already. You're pruned
[1:01:59] already.
[1:02:02] There is, and this is all part of
[1:02:04] demonology in the spiritual realm. I'm
[1:02:06] I'm giving you the tactics how the
[1:02:08] spirit of God works, how the spirit of
[1:02:09] the Antichrist works.
[1:02:12] There is a vast distance
[1:02:15] between
[1:02:17] and I'm really going to go slow on this
[1:02:18] one because I want it so clear because
[1:02:21] I'm speaking about the greatest
[1:02:23] existential threat to the human race.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; There's not a more important topic than
[1:02:27] what I'm about to go into.
[1:02:32] What I'm about to go into is the
[1:02:35] difference between you making a rapture
[1:02:38] or going into annihilation in the
[1:02:40] tribulation period. Can you think of a
[1:02:42] more important subject?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; There's a vast distance between being
[1:02:50] converted and being reformed.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] Now when I say reformed, that's not to
[1:02:57] be confused with the reformation era of
[1:02:59] Martin Luther in the Sardisian age,
[1:03:01] which by the way produced a new birth at
[1:03:04] that time.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; You understand
[1:03:07] the whole premise
[1:03:10] of the reformation movement that Luther
[1:03:14] led and others. It wasn't just Luther.
[1:03:17] He was the spearhead of it. Just like in
[1:03:19] brother Brandham's day, he was the
[1:03:20] spearhead. He was the voice to that age.
[1:03:23] Luther, you know, um the the whole
[1:03:26] premise was was not to create a new
[1:03:32] man-made church system. That's not what
[1:03:34] Luther was trying to do.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; He was not trying to create a man-made
[1:03:39] church system. Today, we have north of
[1:03:42] 33,000
[1:03:44] versions of the single true vine gospel.
[1:03:48] 33 north of. That's the That's an old
[1:03:50] count. I've heard new counts that say
[1:03:52] it's approaching 40,000 of denominations
[1:03:55] and indep various independent Christian
[1:03:57] societies and organizations. And even
[1:04:00] when they call themselves independent,
[1:04:01] they're anything but.
[1:04:04] So the whole premise of it was not to
[1:04:08] make a man-made church system, but in
[1:04:11] Luther's mind, he was trying to take the
[1:04:14] church back to the original word, to the
[1:04:16] original church. Now you you and you can
[1:04:19] and I and I did a lot of reading because
[1:04:21] I wanted to read it in his own words. I
[1:04:23] didn't just want to take some
[1:04:25] historian's word for it. I went back and
[1:04:26] actually pulled up Luther's sermons and
[1:04:28] I have them in my library and I have
[1:04:30] access to them and I spent a lot of time
[1:04:32] just reading it word for word and I've
[1:04:34] got a couple of quotes from brother
[1:04:36] Luther himself.
[1:04:38] And so I everything I'm saying I can
[1:04:41] prove by his own writings and his own
[1:04:43] sermons. Uh Martin Luther has a sermon
[1:04:46] uh on Pentecost, Acts chapter 2.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; And you can actually go online and read
[1:04:52] it. And it's and it's translated from
[1:04:54] his German language. And and I did I did
[1:04:58] I did do some reading of it. So So I
[1:05:01] want to I want to make that clear. The
[1:05:04] spirit of restoration was falling on
[1:05:07] Martin Luther. That was the first stage
[1:05:09] in a four- stage restoration of the
[1:05:12] bride tree.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; You understand? It went down uh from
[1:05:16] those first ages. And that first, you
[1:05:20] know, uh spirit of that lion anointing
[1:05:22] and that white and that white horse and
[1:05:24] that spirit uh you know of the lion
[1:05:26] carried through all the way through, you
[1:05:28] know, through in uh through the first
[1:05:29] three church ages. Brother Brandham
[1:05:31] taught us this. And then you find going
[1:05:33] into that fourth, leaving the third,
[1:05:36] going into the fourth. Now they're going
[1:05:37] to enter dark ages and Satan is
[1:05:39] switching his rider. Now he's going to
[1:05:41] red. He's going to start slaughtering
[1:05:42] them wholesale. And then from there
[1:05:44] they're going to go into a thousand
[1:05:45] years of dark ages and he's going to get
[1:05:47] on a black horse and and God is going to
[1:05:50] come, you know, uh at the at the
[1:05:53] beginning of Sardis and he's going to
[1:05:54] begin to restore it back. So Luther is
[1:05:58] actually not trying to start a new
[1:06:02] denomination. HE'S HE JUST CAME OUT OF
[1:06:05] THAT. THOUSAND YEARS OF DARK AGES OF
[1:06:08] THAT.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S NOT TRYING TO DO THAT. HE'S
[1:06:10] TRYING TO restore us back to the
[1:06:12] original. NOW HE DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE
[1:06:14] PIECES.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have all THE REVELATION. A
[1:06:17] SEAL PARTIALLY OPENED. A mystery dropped
[1:06:20] down and a messenger caught it and ran
[1:06:22] with it. But it's IMPORTANT THAT YOU
[1:06:24] UNDERSTAND IT'S ALL PART OF THE PACKAGE
[1:06:26] OF restoration starting to work. So to
[1:06:30] to YOU KNOW HIS IDEA IS TO TAKE THE
[1:06:33] CHURCH BACK under the control and
[1:06:37] guidance of the Holy Ghost. But as so
[1:06:40] many times in history, brother Brandham
[1:06:43] dealt with this when that leader goes
[1:06:44] off the scene men get in there and it
[1:06:47] doesn't take many generations after
[1:06:49] that. You can see it in history.
[1:06:52] subsequent generations of followers
[1:06:54] manage to they they manage over time to
[1:06:57] sever the movement from the vine again.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Turning it into a eventually a mere
[1:07:04] denomination.
[1:07:06] AND AND EVEN SO-CALLED, AS I'VE said
[1:07:09] already, even so-called independent
[1:07:12] Christian movements at the end of the
[1:07:14] day are still just man-made religious
[1:07:19] organizations that produce reform.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; But I've already told you there's a big
[1:07:26] distance between conversion and
[1:07:28] reformation.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; So they're trying to reform. Now, that
[1:07:33] can seemingly be a good thing. and
[1:07:35] because reformed to you know positive
[1:07:39] reformation in your life uh I DON'T SAY
[1:07:41] THAT'S A BAD THING BUT THAT'S NOT the
[1:07:44] new birth
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; necessarily
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; when you present a version of the gospel
[1:07:54] that seeks to merely improve
[1:07:58] or you know to to to try to produce an
[1:08:01] improved person
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; or a reformed armed person, but but it
[1:08:07] downplays or completely disregards
[1:08:12] uh a thorough NEW BIRTH BY THE BAPTISM
[1:08:15] OF THE HOLY Ghost for a real conversion.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That is the not a that is the trap of
[1:08:29] the antichrist at the end time.
[1:08:32] THERE'S NO SUBJECT MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU
[1:08:34] than the one I'm speaking of right now
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; because there are there are thousands
[1:08:40] and tens of thousands of pull pits that
[1:08:43] just limit their ministry. Fine people,
[1:08:47] not again AN IMPROVED PERSON, A SOMEWHAT
[1:08:51] REFORMED PERSON. YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING
[1:08:53] TO A GUY ONE TIME. HE'S ACTUALLY A
[1:08:55] FRIEND OF MINE. WORKED FOR MY DAD ON HIS
[1:08:57] CREW AND I was running that crew and and
[1:09:00] you know HE HE HAD STARTED GOING TO
[1:09:02] CHURCH AND UH YOU KNOW I WAS WITNESSING
[1:09:04] TO HIM AND SOME DIFFERENT THINGS AND I
[1:09:06] FINALLY SAID SOMETHING HE DIDN'T like
[1:09:09] and he LOOKED AT ME DEAD IN MY EYE HE
[1:09:11] SAID LISTEN Jason you need to understand
[1:09:14] I'm just a reformed thug
[1:09:17] and I and I'm only going to take you
[1:09:20] saying so much to me I was like wow I
[1:09:23] didn't even know I was offending you
[1:09:25] much less, you know, you're going to go
[1:09:27] full thug on me and I'm going to end up
[1:09:28] in a scrap. Now, I like a good scrap,
[1:09:31] but I didn't want He was larger than me
[1:09:33] and I wasn't all too sure I could
[1:09:35] survive.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] When you do that, when you downplay or
[1:09:49] eliminate THE HOLY GHOST COMING IN for a
[1:09:53] real conversion,
[1:09:55] then why that's so deadly is that opens
[1:10:00] A PERSON UP TO accepting a religious
[1:10:03] spirit.
[1:10:05] THAT AND THAT RELIGIOUS SPIRIT AND
[1:10:07] BECAUSE OF THEIR improvements and
[1:10:08] reformations makes them feel like that
[1:10:11] they are okay TO JUST BE A BETTER
[1:10:14] PERSON.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said you must be born again.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Your first birth is no good and you
[1:10:28] CAN'T UNDO IT BY BEING GOOD.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:34] The spirit of God has to be allowed
[1:10:38] by you into your heart and change you
[1:10:43] into a new creation.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; REVELATION 3:20, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT the
[1:10:52] door and knock." This is an end time
[1:10:54] prophecy. If any man hear my voice and
[1:10:57] open the door, I will come into him
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; AND WILL S WITH HIM and he with me. So
[1:11:05] this is going to be fellowship. This is
[1:11:07] the mystery of God, not a doctrine. This
[1:11:11] mystery wants fellowship.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:11:15] AND AND SO SO LET ME LET ME JUST SAY IT
[1:11:18] TO YOU LIKE THIS SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE
[1:11:20] WE WE WE just cut to the chase. BEHOLD,
[1:11:25] I STAND AT YOUR HEART TODAY.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm knocking.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; If you will OPEN THE DOOR TO YOUR HEART,
[1:11:35] I'LL COME in you and live.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME, AS PAUL SAID, a new
[1:11:42] creation. You become, AS WILLIAM
[1:11:45] BRANDHAM SAID, A BRAND NEW UNIT.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE SCOURED OUT BY THE FIERY
[1:11:51] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT fell in
[1:11:54] THE UPPER ROOM AT PENTECOST. THE SAME
[1:11:57] ONE,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; NOT A DIFFERENT ONE. THE SAME ONE.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THAT
[1:12:03] SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS FROM THE
[1:12:06] DEAD DWELL IN YOU, IT'LL also quicken
[1:12:08] your mortal body.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; This is important.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:15] Luther explicitly taught that the that
[1:12:19] the CHRISTIAN UH PENTECOST IN IN THE
[1:12:22] SECOND CHAPTER of Acts according TO
[1:12:25] LUTHER IT STANDS AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS
[1:12:27] UNTIL I REALLY READ IT. I WHEN I WHEN I
[1:12:30] FIRST BEGAN TO READ SOME OF THESE THINGS
[1:12:31] I THOUGHT MY I DIDN'T I'm going to have
[1:12:33] to go REALLY LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:12:34] NOT what I understood and I HAD ALREADY
[1:12:38] SPENT YEARS reading through his
[1:12:39] writings. But it BUT IT BUT THE CLAIM
[1:12:42] WAS THAT LUTHER CLAIMED THAT THE
[1:12:44] CHRISTIAN PENTECOST IN ACTS TWO STANDS
[1:12:47] IN A DELIBERATE CONTRAST. NOW THAT MAKES
[1:12:49] SENSE to me. IT STANDS IN A DELIBERATE
[1:12:52] CONTRAST UH TO THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:12:56] PENTECOST AT SINAI BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
[1:12:57] IT STARTED.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT STARTED UNDER THAT
[1:13:00] PENTECOST THEY GOT A LAW.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; You understand? SO, SO, SO THAT THAT SO
[1:13:08] THAT SO THAT WHAT WAS GIVEN IN THE UPPER
[1:13:10] ROOM ACCORDING TO MARTIN Luther was a
[1:13:13] NEW LAW OF A DIFFERENT KIND, NOT a
[1:13:17] replacement code of commandments.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; BUT THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT WAS TO BE
[1:13:27] WRITTEN in their heart. YEAH.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; YEAH. I HOPE YOU'RE GRASPING.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS
[1:13:35] OF THE RESTORATION of the bride.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; LUTHER WANTED THAT CLEAR FROM THE START.
[1:13:44] AND AND AND AND THAT WAY NOW THAT WE'VE
[1:13:46] COME SINCE LUTHER IN THE 1500S AND HERE
[1:13:49] WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY AND ALL OF
[1:13:50] THAT IS ALMOST GONE AND WATERED DOWN AND
[1:13:53] IT'S ALL JUST REFORMATION AND
[1:13:55] IMPROVEMENT and self assessment AND
[1:13:56] SELF-HELP AND BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE
[1:13:59] ORIGINAL RESTORATION WAS ABOUT.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; SEE, it was to BE A NEW LAW OF THE
[1:14:06] SPIRIT WRITTEN IN OUR HEART. IN HIS
[1:14:07] PENTECOST SERMON ON ACTS 2, Luther
[1:14:10] actually says that the that the Jewish
[1:14:12] Pentecost originally commemorated the
[1:14:15] giving of the law through Moses, but
[1:14:18] that Christians celebrate Pentecost
[1:14:21] because of a new covenant. Now, Paul
[1:14:23] taught that. That's exactly right. SO,
[1:14:26] SO THE SO THEN, so then he and I'm
[1:14:28] quoting him now. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE
[1:14:30] FROM HIS SERMON PENTECOST, Acts 2. The
[1:14:34] Holy Spirit came in accordance with
[1:14:37] Christ's promise and gave them a new
[1:14:41] law. WE NOW CELEBRATE THIS FEAST NOT
[1:14:45] BECAUSE OF THE OLD HISTORICAL EVENT, BUT
[1:14:49] BECAUSE of the new one, the sending of
[1:14:52] the Holy Spirit.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Close quote. Martin Luther.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; For Luther, THE CONTRAST WAS SHARP. NOT
[1:15:01] ONLY SHARP BUT INTENTIONAL AND VERY
[1:15:04] DELIBERATE. SINAI ACCORDING TO LUTHER
[1:15:07] WAS WAS A LAW WRITTEN ON STONE THAT
[1:15:10] PRODUCED FEAR AND ACCUSATION AND DEATH.
[1:15:13] BUT BUT BUT BUT ACCORDING TO LUTHER THE
[1:15:16] JERUSALEM PENTECOST IN ACTS TWO THAT LAW
[1:15:19] WAS WRITTEN ON OUR HEARTS PRODUCING A
[1:15:22] LIFE OF JOY AND willing obedience.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] So the danger
[1:15:34] AND THE GREAT DECEPTION OF THE DAY IS
[1:15:37] PREACHING A VERSION OF THE GOSPEL THAT
[1:15:40] ONLY reforms people somewhat on the
[1:15:43] outside.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; They sit in man-made systems of
[1:15:47] religion. SOME OF THEM VERY FINE PEOPLE.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's why we still preach.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Matt JUST BUILT US A
[1:15:54] NEW WEBSITE. WE'RE TRYING TO REACH OUT
[1:15:55] TO THE WORLD AND SAY, "HEY, YOU'RE IN A
[1:15:57] TRAP."
[1:15:59] SEE,
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; THEY SIT IN THESE MAN-MADE SYSTEMS OF
[1:16:03] RELIGION THINKING THEY ARE OKAY. YOU
[1:16:06] KNOW, BROTHER JASON, WHAT is what is
[1:16:09] man-made religion? And I THAT'S A VALID
[1:16:12] QUESTION. AND I HAD TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
[1:16:14] You know, LET LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE
[1:16:16] THIS WAY. LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. It's
[1:16:19] manufactured.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; It's synthetic.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; It's human caused.
[1:16:29] Not God caused
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; God never organized like that.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; It's even at Sinai he didn't do that.
[1:16:37] It's God it's THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR is
[1:16:40] God caused not human caused.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; So you know it it
[1:16:47] it what happens when it's manufactured
[1:16:50] OR IT'S SYNTHETIC OR IT'S A HUMANCAUSED
[1:16:54] SYSTEM OF RELIGION.
[1:16:57] UH WHICH IS ALWAYS AS BROTHER BRENNHAM
[1:16:58] SAID A PAINTED FIRE.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T GET warmed by it.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Uh but it's an impersonation
[1:17:05] OF TRUE WORSHIP AND IT CAUSES AN
[1:17:09] IMPERSONATION OF CHRISTIANITY.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID THE DAY IS COMING WHEN THEY
[1:17:16] WORSHIP THEY THAT WORSHIP ME MUST
[1:17:18] WORSHIP in spirit and truth. It's the
[1:17:21] ONLY KIND OF WORSHIP THE FATHER CAN
[1:17:23] ACCEPT. THERE IS A VAST OTHER KIND. THE
[1:17:27] BIBLE SAYS THAT IN VAIN DO THEY worship
[1:17:30] me teaching for doctrine,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; THE HUMAN CAUSED SYNTHETIC MANUFACTURED
[1:17:36] GOSPEL.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; SO WHY IS THIS THE GREATEST EXISTENTIAL
[1:17:42] THREAT TO the survival of the human
[1:17:44] race? Because it is the very thing that
[1:17:47] will destroy civilization in the
[1:17:50] tribulation period. It's Antichrist
[1:17:53] disguised as authentic Christianity.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; If the book of Revelation is to be
[1:18:02] believed,
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; there were to be many lying wonders
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; that fooled the people. Yeah.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; I I touched on this last Sunday because
[1:18:19] don't don't get fooled by lying wonders
[1:18:21] because Satan is able to produce
[1:18:23] tremendous amounts of emotion from
[1:18:26] people
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and things can seem very exciting
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; and you know you're not just coming to
[1:18:33] church. I mean that's not even a lot of
[1:18:35] times in the modern day that's not even
[1:18:36] the vibe anymore. It's a it's a concert
[1:18:38] vibe.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; It's a show. And and that's what it it's
[1:18:43] entertainment.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not after that kind of a vibe.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I want a church that's on fire for the
[1:18:49] Holy Spirit.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; I WANT A CHURCH THAT BELIEVES THE
[1:18:51] BAREFISTED WORD OF GOD.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; I WANT A CHURCH THAT LOOKS TO GOD TO
[1:18:55] KEEP HIS PROMISE. AND HE DOES.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:00] SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF EXCITABLE THINGS
[1:19:04] THAT ARE LYING wonders and and vast
[1:19:07] numbers gather into the tens of
[1:19:09] thousands and satellite and people
[1:19:11] crying and and even miracles as brother
[1:19:14] Matt SMITH WAS SAYING TODAY MIRACLES
[1:19:16] OPERATE BECAUSE OF FAITH.
[1:19:18] IT'S IT DOESN'T INDICATE THAT THAT THAT
[1:19:20] THAT YOUR DOCTRINE is true THAT AND AND
[1:19:24] IN FACT IS IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION
[1:19:27] THAT the the PART OF THE ANTICHRIST
[1:19:30] system fools the world OR ACTUALLY CO
[1:19:35] coerces the WORLD INTO FOLLOWING THE
[1:19:38] ANTICHRIST BECAUSE IT COULD BRING FIRE
[1:19:40] DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT'S WHAT EXACTLY WHAT
[1:19:44] HAPPENED IN THE DESERTS OF NEW MEXICO
[1:19:47] AND OVER JAPAN.
[1:19:49] THE UNITED STATES BROUGHT FIRE DOWN OUT
[1:19:52] OF HEAVEN.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said that was that was
[1:19:55] the uh nuclear bombs. And we're the
[1:19:58] first ones. I shouldn't say that. WE
[1:19:59] WERE NOT THE FIRST ones to invent a
[1:20:01] nuke. Brother Matthew found out that
[1:20:03] Sodom and Gomorrah got nuked.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Wow. They had a heat event that can only
[1:20:09] be equaled in with atomic uh fusion
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; and and and it literally they thought it
[1:20:15] WAS GLAZING ON POTTERY AND AND THE LABS
[1:20:17] not glazing. This is this is SOMETHING
[1:20:19] THAT IS CAUSED BY AN INTENSE HEAT EVENT
[1:20:21] A SUDDEN SHOCKING ELEVATION IN HEAT AND
[1:20:24] THEY SAID well what what kind OF
[1:20:26] TEMPERATURE LIKE THE SUN POSSIBLY COULD
[1:20:28] CAUSE THAT ONLY A NUCLEAR BOMB.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; These things aren't accidents. Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; God is constantly giving the world
[1:20:38] signs. He's always done that. He never
[1:20:39] brings judgment without first warning.
[1:20:42] OH MY GOODNESS. LET'S RUN TO THE SAFETY
[1:20:45] IN THE cliff of the rock today.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF lying
[1:20:50] wonders that the world can get you to
[1:20:52] thinking, "Oh, this is okay." BECAUSE
[1:20:55] YOU SEE ALL THE EMOTION and you see the
[1:20:57] you you could sit in that AND FEEL THE
[1:20:59] VIBE AND IT CAN FEEL VERY EMOTIONAL AND
[1:21:01] YOU FIND YOUR OWN SELF UH THRILLED AND
[1:21:03] CRYING. DON'T GET DUPED BY LYING
[1:21:06] WONDERS.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; The only wonder I'm looking for that's
[1:21:14] not a lie is something that will change
[1:21:17] my life.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; And if it won't do that, then it's just
[1:21:22] a lying wonder.
[1:21:25] It's a trap that billions will fall for.
[1:21:30] If the book of Revelation is to be
[1:21:32] believed, all the nations
[1:21:36] and religions of the entire world
[1:21:40] worship the beast system.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what religion they are.
[1:21:46] They don't even have to be Christian.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You understand? Doesn't matter what
[1:21:49] government they are or what kind. It
[1:21:51] doesn't matter if they're a communist,
[1:21:53] socialist, capitalist. Doesn't matter.
[1:21:55] Doesn't matter if they're if they're a a
[1:21:57] a leading nation or a small tiny island.
[1:22:01] Doesn't matter if they're Christian,
[1:22:03] Buddhist, or what? THE ENTIRE WORLD
[1:22:06] ACCORDING IF THE BOOK OF REVELATION IS
[1:22:08] TO BE BELIEVED.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; NOW, if you don't believe it, then I'm
[1:22:11] not sure why you're here today. But I
[1:22:13] believe it. Right.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And if the book of revelation is to be
[1:22:18] believed, then all the nations of all
[1:22:20] the world and all the religions worship
[1:22:23] the beast system of a false Christian
[1:22:27] religion and EVEN GIVE THEIR POWER TO IT
[1:22:30] FOR ONE PROPHETIC hour
[1:22:36] just before
[1:22:38] the whole thing suffers a global
[1:22:42] annihilation
[1:22:44] of all living things.
[1:22:48] The tribulation ends with an
[1:22:50] extermination event of the entire human
[1:22:52] race.
[1:22:56] That's the system that threatens the
[1:22:59] world.
[1:23:01] It's why I've never understood why
[1:23:04] people want to spend valuable time. Time
[1:23:07] is precious. It's more precious than
[1:23:09] money. You can lose money and get more.
[1:23:12] You lose time, you can't get it back.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; You can't save it. You you're you're
[1:23:16] you're spending it whether you want to
[1:23:18] or not.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; It's not replenishable.
[1:23:22] And so that's why I've cashed in and
[1:23:23] went for eternal life.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I want the kind that didn't start. And
[1:23:27] since it didn't start, it doesn't end.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; I don't just want endless time. I want
[1:23:32] eternity. Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:23:35] SO SO WE REALIZE THEN that
[1:23:40] you know this this great system that is
[1:23:44] destroying the world and I don't want to
[1:23:46] just keep going down that but I I was
[1:23:49] going to say and I just want to say it
[1:23:50] briefly because it's not worth my time
[1:23:52] talking about it more very much at all
[1:23:56] other than to just mention how
[1:23:57] ridiculous that people would spend time
[1:24:01] lots of it building websites and
[1:24:04] YouTubetubes attacking a message that
[1:24:06] they already know makes people into the
[1:24:08] image of Christ.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And they already know a faithful servant
[1:24:12] who was thought faithful around the
[1:24:14] world his entire life and never suffered
[1:24:16] an accusation.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And they spent all THEIR TIME ATTACKING
[1:24:19] THAT and and you say, "Oh, here you go
[1:24:21] again." No, no, I'm not going to talk
[1:24:22] about that because I don't care about
[1:24:23] that. What bothers me is, and I said it
[1:24:26] to their face, what bothers me is, you
[1:24:28] know what the real threat to the world
[1:24:30] is, and I don't see you spending one
[1:24:32] minute,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; telling the world about the beast system
[1:24:36] and Rome and and America and Revelation
[1:24:39] 13, AND YOU KNOW IT. You preached it.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; You know IT FITS IN THE BIBLE. AND I'LL
[1:24:44] HEAR YOU WARNING THE WORLD AT ALL. I
[1:24:46] guess you can't BECAUSE YOU'VE JOINED IN
[1:24:48] WITH THEM. SO, IF YOU TURN AROUND AND
[1:24:50] WARN THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE POT
[1:24:51] CALLING THE CATTLE BLACK. AND I Okay, I
[1:24:54] GET IT. I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU THAT YOU
[1:24:57] CAN'T TAKE THE WHOLE UNADULTERATED WORD.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU CAN HAVE THIS WORLD. GIVE ME
[1:25:02] JESUS.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THIS WORD. I'LL STAND BY MYSELF
[1:25:06] IF I HAVE TO. I JUST WANT HIM AND HIS
[1:25:09] WORD AND HIS LIFE. AND I WANT ALL OF IT
[1:25:11] NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ME.
[1:25:19] How could I not love a God who who has
[1:25:22] followed me all the surely goodness
[1:25:24] followed me all the days of my life?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Even when I was running from him as a
[1:25:29] rebel and he chased me down. I don't
[1:25:31] know. DID HE TRIP ME? DID HE KNOCK ME
[1:25:33] DOWN? DID HE KNOCK ME OUT? HE MIGHT HAVE
[1:25:35] DID ALL THE ABOVE. ALL I KNOW IS WHEN I
[1:25:37] CAME TO, I WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SORRY. I'M ONLY
[1:25:42] SORRY I RAN SO FAST IN THE OPPOSITE
[1:25:44] DIRECTION.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; And then HE HE STILL FOLLOWS ME IN SPITE
[1:25:47] OF ALL MY FAILURES WHEN I WOULD HAVE
[1:25:49] KICKED ME TO THE CURB SO LONG AGO. AND
[1:25:52] HE JUST KEEPS RENEWING ME DAY BY DAY,
[1:25:55] DAY BY DAY. HE KEEPS FORGIVING ME. HE
[1:25:58] KEEPS CLEANSING ME OF ALL
[1:25:59] UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. HOW COULD I NOT LOVE A
[1:26:02] GOD LIKE THAT?
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD I NOT DEDICATE MY LIFE TO IT?
[1:26:07] AMEN.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; AS MUCH OF A FAILURE AS I FEEL, HOW
[1:26:10] WOULD I NOT AT least try?
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE SAID in these systems, these
[1:26:19] synthetic manufactured human-caused
[1:26:22] systems, you say, "Can the spirit of God
[1:26:25] STILL BREAK IN ON THAT system and rescue
[1:26:27] his child from it? CAN HE STILL BREAK IN
[1:26:30] AND REVEAL HIS WORD AND LEAD THEM OUT to
[1:26:33] a true new birth?" OF COURSE HE CAN FOR
[1:26:35] NOW
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR NOW WHILE THE BRIDE
[1:26:39] IS STILL HERE AND AND THE MESSAGE OF
[1:26:41] GRACE IS STILL GOING OUT. BUT BUT BUT
[1:26:44] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING FRIENDS WHEN
[1:26:45] WHEN THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS THE HOLY
[1:26:48] GHOST true to his promise LEADS THEM
[1:26:51] SWIFTLY OUT OF THAT TRAP.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; He doesn't leave THEM IN THAT TRAP. WHAT
[1:26:56] KIND OF SALVATION WOULD THAT BE? RIGHT.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; he leads them SWIFTLY OUT OF THAT trap
[1:27:05] into the further light of the hour.
[1:27:07] That's always the Bible pattern. That's
[1:27:09] always That's always the Bible pattern.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] when the Jews, the devout Jews
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; at came FOR THE FEAST OF PENTECOST INTO
[1:27:24] Jerusalem and Peter AND THEY HEARD
[1:27:27] PETER'S SERMON IN ACTS CHAPTER 2 AS AN
[1:27:28] INDICTMENT MESSAGE blistered them. And
[1:27:31] when IT PRICKED THEIR HEARTS AND THEY
[1:27:33] THEY SAID, "WHAT MUST WE DO? YOU MUST
[1:27:35] REPENT." And and and they and they were
[1:27:37] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BAPTIZED
[1:27:39] AND ADDED TO THE CHURCH. I'LL PROMISE
[1:27:41] YOU THAT THEY THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE THE
[1:27:43] HOLY GHOST TO BE SENT HOME AND CONTINUE
[1:27:47] TO BE DEVOUT JEWS.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE INDUCTED INTO THE FAMILY OF
[1:27:53] GOD AND BECAME PART OF THE FAMILY OF God
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; and and in THE RANKS OF THE REDEEMED.
[1:27:58] WHEN PAUL MET APOLLOS IN ACTS CHAPTER
[1:28:01] 19, YOU KNOW, WHEN PAUL GAVE HIM THE
[1:28:03] CORRECT WORD, HE DIDN'T HE DIDN'T LEAVE.
[1:28:06] APOLLOS DIDN'T LEAVE THERE AND STAY A
[1:28:09] FOLLOWER OF JOHN'S MESSAGE AND JOHN'S
[1:28:11] BAPTISM,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; BUT HE HE ACCEPTED THE REVELATION OF THE
[1:28:16] WORD, BECAME BAPTIZED AND FILLED WITH
[1:28:18] THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND SUBJECTED HIMSELF
[1:28:21] TO THE PROPHET OF HIS AGE, ST. PAUL, AND
[1:28:24] ALL THE OTHER APOSTLES.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE DOESN'T SAY IN
[1:28:28] REVELATION 18, "STAY IN HER, MY PEOPLE,
[1:28:32] AND BE a partaker of her sins." BUT THE
[1:28:35] VOICE THAT ECHOED FROM HEAVEN SAID,
[1:28:36] "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE."
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; ONLY HIS PEOPLE WILL COME OUT OF HER, MY
[1:28:42] PEOPLE, THAT YOU AND BE NOT A PARTAKER
[1:28:44] OF HER SINS, THAT YOU DO NOT PARTAKE OF
[1:28:47] HER DESTRUCTION. AMEN.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt sent me one of the items on
[1:28:56] the website that he's built for us and
[1:28:58] had so many compliments on it already.
[1:29:01] It's still being tweaked and and edited.
[1:29:03] So, just bear with us. We're trying to
[1:29:05] get it perfect. It's very close to that
[1:29:07] now.
[1:29:09] We still got to add a live link for
[1:29:11] those who are streaming. So hopefully
[1:29:13] you're getting through the YouTube live
[1:29:15] or the Facebook live, but we're going to
[1:29:16] have a link there.
[1:29:19] But he said, "Hey, Dad, I want you to
[1:29:20] take A LOOK AT THIS TOPIC OF
[1:29:22] transformation from Romans 12:2, and um
[1:29:26] here's here's a here's a scaffolding.
[1:29:28] Here's a a loose loose wording just just
[1:29:31] as a foundation, and I want you to take
[1:29:33] it and and do that thing you do and and
[1:29:36] give it back to me. I want to put it on
[1:29:37] the website."
[1:29:40] So I did.
[1:29:43] And I even sent him another edit this
[1:29:45] morning to say, "Hey, add this in front
[1:29:47] of that word." Words are important.
[1:29:49] Yeah,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; you can't believe in all the the the the
[1:29:54] published work that I've had over the
[1:29:56] years on the internet, sometimes a
[1:29:59] single sentence will take me days
[1:30:02] and I'll change it 50 times because I
[1:30:04] want the wording perfect
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; and I and I'm and I I've never reached
[1:30:10] perfection in it yet, but I'm I'm I love
[1:30:13] striving
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; for it.
[1:30:16] Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this
[1:30:21] world. How many say amen to that?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Now, here's a port an important point
[1:30:27] that I've made numerous times and I keep
[1:30:29] making it. Paul is talking to people who
[1:30:31] are born of the spirit.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; He's not down in in the honky tonks
[1:30:36] preaching to drunkards.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; This is to the church.
[1:30:40] Be not conformed to this world, but be
[1:30:43] you transformed by the renewing of your
[1:30:45] mind, that you may prove what is that
[1:30:48] good. Thank you, Gideon. An acceptable
[1:30:50] and perfect will of God.
[1:30:53] So, I wrote this and you'll read it um
[1:30:56] when the edit this morning is put in.
[1:30:59] More than an outward reform or religious
[1:31:03] behavior,
[1:31:04] transformation is an inward change
[1:31:07] brought about by the life of Christ in
[1:31:10] the believer.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; A transformation that begins with the
[1:31:14] new birth. When a person is truly born
[1:31:17] again, they are a new creation
[1:31:20] possessing the very spirit of Christ who
[1:31:23] changes their desires, attitudes, and
[1:31:27] character from the inside out.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This new birth continues its work. And
[1:31:33] that was an important addition that I
[1:31:35] added in. This new birth continues its
[1:31:38] work. The new birth is a is a is an
[1:31:40] experience.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; You don't slowly get born again. You're
[1:31:43] either born again or you're not born
[1:31:45] again.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; But at the SAME TIME, IT'S NOT NOW
[1:31:48] YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. SEE YOU IN THE
[1:31:49] RAPTURE. The Holy Spirit now BEGINS A
[1:31:52] LIFETIME WORK OF you coming into the
[1:31:54] image in every area of your life. THE
[1:31:56] NEW BIRTH SENDS YOU WAY DOWNSTREAM.
[1:31:59] CHANGES YOU INTO A NEW CREATION. GIVES
[1:32:01] YOU THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF
[1:32:03] GOD, EVEN THE ONES YOU DON'T KNOW YET.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; I got a point to make about that in a
[1:32:10] second. A TRANSFORMATION THAT BEGINS
[1:32:13] WITH THE NEW BIRTH. When a person is
[1:32:16] TRULY BORN AGAIN, THEY ARE a new
[1:32:18] creation possessing the very spirit of
[1:32:20] Christ who changes their desires,
[1:32:22] attitudes, and character from the inside
[1:32:24] out. This new birth then continues its
[1:32:27] work in the individual, transforming
[1:32:30] them daily to reflect God's word and
[1:32:33] produce a life worthy of the gospel. IT
[1:32:36] IS NOT AN INSTANT PERFECTION OF the
[1:32:38] flesh. IT IS A CONTINUAL SHAPING OF THE
[1:32:41] believer as they yield to God's word and
[1:32:45] spirit. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT TOKEN
[1:32:47] WILL BRING YOUR BODY SUBJECT TO THE
[1:32:49] WORD. SEE,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; genuine transformation
[1:32:53] IS THE EVIDENCE OF GENUINE CONVERSION.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; A life being daily aligned with God's
[1:33:02] nature, will purpose. It produces a
[1:33:06] willing a willingness from the heart to
[1:33:10] hear, to recognize, and act upon the
[1:33:15] word of God.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; AS I SAID TO YOU EARLIER, DEMONS ARE
[1:33:20] SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN TO RETREAT.
[1:33:22] THEY'RE LIKE A GAMBLER. They wrote a
[1:33:23] song like that somewhere back in my
[1:33:25] youth in the 80s about gamblers knowing
[1:33:27] when it's time to walk away. AND DEMONS
[1:33:30] ARE SMART. THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING ON
[1:33:32] HUMAN BEINGS FOR six millennia,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; They're very good at fooling you.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; AND BUT THEY KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THE
[1:33:41] LORD CAN COME IN AND DRIVE THEM off
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; but and they'll BE AND THEY'LL JUST GO
[1:33:47] BECAUSE THEY KNOW IF THEY HANG AROUND
[1:33:49] THEY'RE GOING TO SUFFER AN ANNIHILATION.
[1:33:52] SO THEY'LL QUICKLY RETREAT SO THAT
[1:33:54] YOU'LL THINK, "OH, I'M I'M GOOD. THIS IS
[1:33:56] ALL I NEED." AND IT'S NOT ALL YOU NEED.
[1:33:59] THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO CALM
[1:34:01] DOWN,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; GET A DRINK OF WATER, SIT DOWN, AND
[1:34:04] THEY'LL COME RIGHT BACK IN. AND THEY
[1:34:06] DON'T START WITH A PHYSICAL ATTACK LIKE
[1:34:08] EVE. THEY START WITH A QUESTION.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU LONG, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
[1:34:14] YOU'RE A LITTLE WAYS DOWN THE road and
[1:34:16] they've got you right back where I
[1:34:18] remember Brother Lonnie used to describe
[1:34:20] it that Okay. SO, THE DEVIL KNOWS HOW TO
[1:34:21] JUST, YOU KNOW, cross the moat, pull up
[1:34:24] the bridge, AND JUST WAIT IN HIS castle
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; until you calm down, and then he'll
[1:34:29] lower the bridge back down and walk back
[1:34:30] across right into your life.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't be that kind OF A CHRISTIAN,
[1:34:35] FRIENDS. LET THE WORD CLEANSE YOU. Stay
[1:34:37] free, STAY CLEANSED, GROW IN GRACE.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; LET THE LET THE WORD DWELL IN YOU
[1:34:44] RICHLY.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; LET THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST BE in
[1:34:48] you. Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; I thought ABOUT THIS AND THE LORD JUST
[1:34:55] SPOKE IT IN MY HEART. MUTUAL DESIRES
[1:34:58] with God. I thought, what does that even
[1:34:59] mean?
[1:35:01] What does IT MEAN TO HAVE a mutual
[1:35:03] desire with God? I had so many Bible
[1:35:06] people I love to have talked about. I I
[1:35:09] would have loved to have talked about
[1:35:10] Moses and Abraham and uh and and go up
[1:35:13] through the prophets. There's so much
[1:35:15] good preaching in there. I wanted to go
[1:35:17] in through the New Testament and, you
[1:35:19] know, talk about St. Paul and the
[1:35:21] different ones, but I I basically
[1:35:23] WHITTLELED IT DOWN TO JUST talking about
[1:35:25] David and the son of David, Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Having a mutual desire with God because
[1:35:33] that was what David was known for.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; He he HAD A HEART LIKE GOD. THE BIBLE
[1:35:40] SAID, "HE'S A MAN after my own heart."
[1:35:43] That means that my the the motives and
[1:35:46] objectives and desires and feelings I
[1:35:48] have, he's like that.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; He's like me. He's a chip off the old
[1:35:51] block. He thinks like me, feels like me,
[1:35:53] reacts like me. He's a man after He's a
[1:35:56] man like me. He's a man after my own
[1:35:58] heart.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; See, AND SO HAVING MUTUAL desires with
[1:36:04] God means that your wants, which you
[1:36:08] have in YOUR HUMAN WILL BECAUSE YOUR
[1:36:09] FLESH IS NOT CONVERTED. RIGHT?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST
[1:36:14] BATTLE BEGINS. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE
[1:36:16] GREATEST battle till you're born again.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Now you've because THEN YOU ARE A TRIUNE
[1:36:20] BEING AND ALL ALL THREE OF YOU WERE
[1:36:22] HEADED IN THE DEVIL'S DIRECTION. BUT GOD
[1:36:25] COMES IN AND CHANGES ONE OF THOSE REALMS
[1:36:27] AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A A GREATEST BATTLE
[1:36:29] EVER FOUGHT. YOU'VE GOT AN INSIDE MAN
[1:36:31] THAT SAYS, "I WANT GOD." AND YOU'VE GOT
[1:36:33] A FLESH THAT SAYS, "I LIKE THE WORLD."
[1:36:34] AND YOU'VE GOT AN INSIDE MAN SAYS,
[1:36:36] "WE'RE GOING TO CHURCH." AND YOU'VE GOT
[1:36:37] AN OUTSIDE MAN SAYS, "I'M TOO TIRED TO
[1:36:39] GO TO CHURCH." BUT GREATER IS HE
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN ME, THANK GOD, THAN HE THAT
[1:36:45] IS IN THE WORLD. AND SO I'M HERE TODAY
[1:36:47] BECAUSE OF THAT. I'M A BELIEVER BECAUSE
[1:36:50] OF THAT.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE GOD.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; DO YOU FAIL? I DO. AND I REPENT, BUT I'M
[1:36:58] DETERMINED TO SERVE HIM.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. I WILL NEVER
[1:37:03] QUIT OR GO BACK.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I would rather die.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. It means that YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING
[1:37:11] RESHAPED. YOUR WHOLE WANTS AND DESIRES
[1:37:15] TO HAVE MUTUAL DESIRES WITH GOD. YOUR
[1:37:18] YOUR DESIRES ARE BEING RESHAPED UNTIL
[1:37:20] THEY LINE UP WITH HIS. IT'S NOT, AND
[1:37:22] THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT, IT'S NOT
[1:37:23] JUST OBEYING HIM BECAUSE YOU SHOULD.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "OH YEAH, YOU
[1:37:29] DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL." OF COURSE you
[1:37:30] don't. But that's not why you obey him.
[1:37:34] You obey him genuinely
[1:37:38] because you want what he wants.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; You love what he loves.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; You gladly turn away. You're glad to be
[1:37:49] given the power to turn away.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; From things that he rejects
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; often even before you're even told to.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Brother B talked about that there in
[1:37:59] Africa and those native women from the
[1:38:02] tribal areas. and with almost no clothes
[1:38:04] on because they're raised as heathens.
[1:38:06] They don't know. And he said, "Nobody
[1:38:08] told those women to suddenly cover up."
[1:38:10] He said, "As soon as the Holy Ghost fell
[1:38:11] on them, women covered themselves and
[1:38:12] walked out of the PRESENCE OF MEN."
[1:38:14] NOBODY EVEN had to instruct them. Sister
[1:38:16] Jean could give you a testimony from her
[1:38:18] as a young woman, JUST A YOUNG MOTHER.
[1:38:20] And when she came, nobody had to tell
[1:38:22] her to lay down the things of the world
[1:38:24] and garments that pertain to a man and
[1:38:26] smoking and cursing and all of THESE
[1:38:28] THINGS. SHE THEY JUST STOPPED. YEAH.
[1:38:30] RIGHT.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I CAN'T I CAN'T RECONCILE THE
[1:38:33] WOMAN I KNOW NOW WITH THAT KIND OF
[1:38:34] WOMAN." YOU KNOW WHY? CUZ SHE'S NOT THAT
[1:38:36] WOMAN ANYMORE.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; SHE'S A BRAND NEW UNIT. SHE'S A NEW
[1:38:40] CREATION.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WRONG TO THINK THAT'S NOT THE
[1:38:43] SAME WOMAN.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; That's exactly why.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; MUTUAL DESIRES IS ALIGNMENT. IT'S
[1:38:52] DEFINITELY NOT COERCION. It's not God
[1:38:54] dragging you to his will. your heart is
[1:38:56] voluntarily
[1:38:58] lending and and leaning and you're
[1:39:01] willing to just be leased and bought and
[1:39:04] used
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; in your daily life. This goes deeper
[1:39:09] than behavior, friends. I hope you're
[1:39:10] getting that.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Please don't limit in your mind that I'm
[1:39:14] talking about just mere behavior.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Um this is your motives. This is your
[1:39:20] affections. this is, you know, they they
[1:39:22] they've GOT TO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
[1:39:24] POINT WHERE YOUR MOTIVES AND YOUR
[1:39:26] OBJECTIVES START MATCHING HIS motives
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; and OBJECTIVES NO MATTER WHAT IT COST
[1:39:31] YOU.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, so the scripture points at at this
[1:39:36] directly uh there in Jeremiah 31:33
[1:39:41] put he's going to put his law in their
[1:39:44] inward parts. See? So, so that's mutual
[1:39:47] desire in action.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's mutual desire in real time.
[1:39:52] See, IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S HIS WILL IS
[1:39:55] BECOMING YOUR WILL. SO, DAVID, A MAN
[1:39:58] AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART, DAVID CERTAINLY
[1:40:00] ISN'T CALLED THIS BECAUSE HE WAS
[1:40:01] FLAWLESS.
[1:40:03] CLEARLY, he was not flawless. SEE, BUT
[1:40:08] BUT BUT BUT WHAT MADE HIM LIKE THIS IS
[1:40:10] THAT HE DESIRED GOD HIMSELF. NOT JUST
[1:40:14] GOD'S BLESSINGS. WOW.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED GOD HIMSELF.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND WHEN CORRECTED, HE HUMBLED
[1:40:23] HIMSELF. Y'all have HEARD THE STORY FROM
[1:40:25] WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN we had our
[1:40:28] challenge down at the university and and
[1:40:30] and I and here's this, YOU KNOW, DR.
[1:40:33] BAKER IS, you know, SO RESISTING I CAN'T
[1:40:36] EVEN HARDLY GET A WORD OUT. AND HE, YOU
[1:40:38] KNOW, I'M TRYING TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT,
[1:40:39] YOU KNOW, PREDESTINATION AND ELECTION OF
[1:40:41] GOD. IT'S RIGHT IN THE BIBLE. AND HE
[1:40:43] SAYS, WELL, HE SAYS, UM, AND WE START
[1:40:46] TALKING ABOUT CAIN AND HE SAYS, YOU
[1:40:48] KNOW, YOU YOU YOU TALK ABOUT DAVID AND
[1:40:50] and you talk about Cain and he SINNED
[1:40:52] AND BECAUSE HE WASN'T ADAM'S SON, LIKE,
[1:40:54] RIGHT? SO, which so you're SAYING HE'S
[1:40:56] NOT GOD'S HE'S NOT GOD'S A PRODUCT OF
[1:40:58] GOD'S LIFE? THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT. Cain
[1:41:00] was not. Cain was of that evil one. The
[1:41:02] Bible says I didn't say it. The Bible
[1:41:04] says it.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; You teach HE WAS FROM THE EVIL ONE? NO,
[1:41:06] I DON'T. THE BIBLE DOES. I ONLY SAY WHAT
[1:41:08] THE BIBLE SAYS. AND HE SAYS, WELL, HE
[1:41:12] SAYS, THEN I GUESS DAVID WASN'T OF GOD
[1:41:14] EITHER BECAUSE he sinned just like Cain.
[1:41:17] Now, THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PUSH BACK.
[1:41:19] AND FOR ABOUT A MILLISECOND, I DIDN'T
[1:41:21] HAVE AN ANSWER UNTIL A VOICE SPOKE
[1:41:23] INSIDE MY HEAD AND SAID, "YES." BUT
[1:41:25] DAVID REPENTED.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; DAVID HUMBLED HIMSELF.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; CAIN WOULD NOT REPENT. CAIN DUG IN AND
[1:41:31] SAID, "I WILL NOT CHANGE MY WAYS AND
[1:41:33] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY WAYS."
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; BUT DAVID SAID, "OH, FORGIVE ME. RENEW
[1:41:38] IN ME. CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART and
[1:41:42] renew a right spirit in me.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Was there anyone who exemplified a
[1:41:51] perfect mutual desire with God than
[1:41:53] Jesus himself such an ultimate example
[1:41:56] to do the father's will? He said, "I do
[1:41:58] always those things which please him."
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is written of me in the
[1:42:04] scrolls. Lo, I have come to do thy will,
[1:42:07] O Lord." He finally says just before he
[1:42:10] pays the ultimate sacrifice, not my
[1:42:13] will, thine be done.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; So mutual desire
[1:42:21] doesn't mean the lack of struggle.
[1:42:24] Jesus had such a struggle. The Bible
[1:42:27] says in that he feared. He was heard in
[1:42:30] that he feared.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And he his sweat became like drops of
[1:42:35] blood. and he asked if there's a way
[1:42:38] around it.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to die such a horrible
[1:42:42] death and nearly be mutilated uh before
[1:42:44] he was finally killed.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And he didn't want to leave his
[1:42:47] brethren. He was young. He had his
[1:42:48] brethren. He had his ministry. He loved
[1:42:50] life. He wanted to live. But he knew,
[1:42:52] you know, as he as he looked at those at
[1:42:54] those brethren with him, he knew that
[1:42:56] this could only be temporary if he
[1:42:58] didn't give his life for them.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; His love for them said, "I'll die for
[1:43:02] them so that I can have them forever."
[1:43:04] So that on the other side 26 trillion,
[1:43:08] what did I say last? Brother Bram said
[1:43:10] 400
[1:43:12] billion trillion billion trillion years
[1:43:15] downstream. Jesus still wanted to sit by
[1:43:18] a stream and have fellowship with you
[1:43:20] and me and his disciples. I just say
[1:43:23] count me in.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that you'll lack, you
[1:43:29] know, mutual desire. doesn't mean you'll
[1:43:31] LACK STRUGGLE, BUT IT DOES MEAN PERFECT
[1:43:33] SURRENDER.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Sure does.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:43:40] it's something that
[1:43:44] something that and I I search for a word
[1:43:47] and I'm rarely lost for a word, but I I
[1:43:50] I feel like I don't have the enough of
[1:43:53] the right words, but it's something
[1:43:55] about God's word that is so intrinsic in
[1:43:58] my heart. It didn't used to be. So, I
[1:44:00] know something happened. I can remember
[1:44:02] a time when it wasn't and now it is. And
[1:44:04] something in there happened. Say, "Take
[1:44:07] me down to a to a date in a year and
[1:44:09] give me the time that you looked at your
[1:44:10] watch." I didn't. I don't know. All I
[1:44:12] know is I once WAS LOST. NOW I'M FOUND.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I once know. NOW I DIDN'T SO CARE, BUT
[1:44:17] NOW I DO. HERE I DIDN'T. NOW I DO.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And and it's AND IT'S IT'S UH IT'S SO A
[1:44:24] PART OF ME. IT RESONATES. His word
[1:44:26] resonates through me.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The more I GET OF IT, THE MORE I
[1:44:30] WANT OF IT. And and and and EVEN IF HE
[1:44:33] HAS TO CORRECT ME, HOW MANY GET
[1:44:34] CORRECTED? And and isn't IT TRUE THAT
[1:44:38] THAT CORRECTION THOUGH IT FEELS PAINFUL,
[1:44:40] IT FEELS RIGHT
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; AND IT DOESN'T FEEL OFFENSIVE.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU BORN AGAIN PEOPLE. WHEN GOD
[1:44:48] HAS TO CORRECT YOU, ISN'T IT TRUE
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; THAT IT IT FEELS RIGHT. IT DOESN'T FEEL
[1:44:54] OFFENSIVE. RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; might be painful, but I need it.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Your prayers begin to shift from bless
[1:45:05] me, Lord, to order my steps, Lord.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; It's what Ruth wanted. She didn't want
[1:45:12] just per handfuls of purpose. She wanted
[1:45:14] Boaz.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; She knew if she got Boaz, she got the
[1:45:17] whole field.
[1:45:26] every person.
[1:45:29] I'm going to say this and I'm going to
[1:45:31] call the musicians. Brother Tony, get
[1:45:32] ready to bring your team.
[1:45:35] You've been very patient today and I
[1:45:37] appreciate it.
[1:45:39] I've managed to stay on t on on track.
[1:45:42] I've managed to come to the end of this
[1:45:43] series, but please don't let it be the
[1:45:45] end of you in life. I want you to go
[1:45:48] forward and learn from these things and
[1:45:51] learn how to let the word of God dwell
[1:45:53] in you richly. Learn how to surrender
[1:45:55] and humble yourself to every word of
[1:45:57] God. Learn to let your desires be
[1:46:00] aligned with his desires
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; because every person in the Bible who
[1:46:05] truly walked with God,
[1:46:10] they were not just doing his will, but
[1:46:12] they wanted
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; to do his will.
[1:46:19] Come Anthony, bring your team. Let's you
[1:46:22] you just stay seated for a moment. I'm
[1:46:24] going to play an audio clip for you.
[1:46:31] And I read you the opening text of
[1:46:35] brother Brandham when he
[1:46:38] gave an opening text for Is your life
[1:46:40] worthy of the gospel? My favorite sermon
[1:46:42] in all, 1200 plus tapes. Has been for
[1:46:45] many years.
[1:46:48] And I've
[1:46:49] they're going to get to a part where he
[1:46:52] says, "I want to raise my both hands to
[1:46:54] God." And I even after all these years,
[1:46:58] even up to this morning, sitting in my
[1:46:59] office playing it, I can't hold back the
[1:47:02] tears. And I'm hoping I've cried myself
[1:47:05] out already so that I can get through
[1:47:07] this.
[1:47:09] This is This is not only me wanting from
[1:47:12] you. This is me for me. this. You're
[1:47:15] about to hear what I want.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. G, give me that.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Just remember, Jesus humbled himself to
[1:47:24] death for you.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; He was not fussy. When they spit his
[1:47:28] face, he didn't spit back. When they
[1:47:30] pulled his beard out, he didn't pull it
[1:47:32] theirs. When they slapped him on one
[1:47:34] side of the face, the other, he never
[1:47:36] slapped him. He prayed for him. Walked
[1:47:38] on humbly. He was an example of
[1:47:42] humility.
[1:47:44] He was full of faith. Why? He knowed his
[1:47:47] words couldn't fail. He so lived by the
[1:47:50] word that he became the word. Oh God,
[1:47:55] let me hold my both hands to God before
[1:47:58] this audience. Let me live like that.
[1:48:02] Let this word so become that me and this
[1:48:04] word's the same thing.
[1:48:07] Let my words be this word. Let the
[1:48:10] meditation my heart let him be in my
[1:48:12] heart on my mind. Tie his commandments
[1:48:16] upon the post of my intelligence. P upon
[1:48:19] the post of my heart. LET ME JUST SEE
[1:48:22] HIM when temptation rises. Let me see
[1:48:24] Christ.
[1:48:28] Can I interrupt your program, Brother
[1:48:30] Tony? Brother Anthony, uh uh Brother
[1:48:32] Andrew, learning to lean. Let's stand to
[1:48:35] our feet.
[1:48:37] And after this, Brother Tony, you can go
[1:48:39] with what you want. But I just want to
[1:48:41] sing this. It's what's on my heart.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; How many can say that? I raise my both
[1:48:47] hands and say, "Lord God, let me live
[1:48:50] like that. Let let this word and and my
[1:48:55] life be the same thing. Let me want what
[1:48:58] he wants. Let me act like he acts. Let
[1:49:01] me have his kind of a life.
[1:49:03] There's no way for you to do it apart
[1:49:06] from his help. Friends, why don't you
[1:49:08] reach out to him today? If you've never
[1:49:10] known him in his power and his
[1:49:11] resurrection, I'm here to tell you that
[1:49:14] very God who fell in the upper room is
[1:49:16] here today. Amen. As we sing this song,
[1:49:19] you sing it like a prayer. Oh, I'm
[1:49:22] learning
[1:49:25] to lean.
[1:49:27] Oh, I am learning
[1:49:31] to lean.

[1:49:59] need
[1:50:01] to wait
[1:50:04] on Jes.
[1:50:07] Oh, I've loved that since a boy. Oh, I
[1:50:10] learned.
[1:50:14] We used to sing that in the tabernacle,
[1:50:15] brother Paul. Hallelujah. We used to
[1:50:18] sing that as boys. They would sing that.
[1:50:21] Brother James would sing that. They'd
[1:50:23] sing that in the tabernacle. I love that
[1:50:25] song.
[1:50:27] I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:50:32] Oh, I am flying
[1:50:35] more power
[1:50:39] than I ever
[1:50:44] for
[1:50:53] one more time.

[1:51:25] that I may.

[1:51:30] you. If you got a need in your body, we
[1:51:33] can pray.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; See, God still moves. God still heals.
[1:51:37] God still saves.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Sing it again. Oh, I'm learning
[1:51:46] to leave.
[1:51:49] I'm learning
[1:51:52] to leave.

[1:52:12] than I ever
[1:52:16] dream.

[1:53:03] dream.
[1:53:05] I'm learning
[1:53:08] to lean
[1:53:11] on Jesus.
[1:53:25] My soul
[1:53:30] I made Jesus
[1:53:33] my king.
[1:53:36] Have you done that today?
