[34:48] you're the healer of all of it and we're
[34:50] thankful for that
[34:52] that we can call upon your name lord and
[34:54] you you hear and you answer and you move
[34:56] in such a supernatural way in our lives
[34:59] may our faith
[35:01] even now reach out lord
[35:04] and touch you
[35:06] that we might receive
[35:08] exactly what we have need of lord
[35:11] we pray it for your blessing
[35:14] on your word
[35:15] this evening
[35:16] i pray that you would come and that you
[35:18] would speak

[35:22] through the word that is spoken lord

[35:25] to get ourselves out of the way
[35:28] get our worries and our fears and our
[35:30] frustrations out of the way
[35:32] and look
[35:34] to jesus christ
[35:36] look and live
[35:38] that's our desire lord
[35:41] we just want to commit
[35:43] ourselves to you for your glory
[35:45] we ask it in jesus name amen
[35:48] god bless you
[35:51] be doing
[35:52] probably the last
[35:54] in their series on
[35:56] chosen by god
[35:58] and
[35:59] we'll be
[36:02] in the future lord willing moving on to
[36:05] speak about
[36:07] the attributes of god
[36:09] not in the sense of the elect
[36:11] but in the sense of
[36:13] god's holiness god's justice
[36:15] righteousness etc
[36:17] um in the
[36:18] in the future subjects on wednesday
[36:20] nights
[36:22] so uh with that said let's go to the
[36:24] scripture
[36:28] romans 8
[36:30] verse 13
[36:37] for if you live
[36:39] after the flesh you shall die but if you
[36:41] through the spirit
[36:43] do mortify the deeds of the body
[36:46] you shall live amen amen can be seated
[36:50] seems like a very strange verse to
[36:54] begin speaking about about
[36:57] being chosen by god
[36:59] but
[37:01] it's a vast subject
[37:02] and
[37:04] there's many avenues that you need to
[37:06] look at when you're looking at election
[37:08] it's not just
[37:09] simply that we've been chosen by god but
[37:11] it's
[37:12] all the process
[37:13] within that
[37:15] and what specifically we're looking at
[37:18] is you probably know it as
[37:20] eternal security
[37:22] or it's also referred to and you know if
[37:24] you look this up in the message search
[37:26] brother branham will refer to it as the
[37:28] perseverance of the saints
[37:30] and
[37:31] you'll often find brother branham said i
[37:33] do believe in eternal security but often
[37:36] it turns into disgrace
[37:39] and that's the part that
[37:41] we want to talk about
[37:43] a little bit tonight because
[37:45] the true
[37:46] understanding scripturally
[37:48] of eternal security
[37:50] has within it the process there eternal
[37:53] security isn't you believe
[37:55] and that's the end of it
[37:57] eternal security speaks of
[38:00] the process he who began a good work in
[38:02] you will be faithful
[38:05] to complete it to finish it
[38:09] there's a work that he begins and
[38:10] there's a work that he finishes there's
[38:12] a process that we
[38:14] as the elect of god as the bride of
[38:16] christ must be going through amen as an
[38:19] outward evidence
[38:21] that there's an inward work of grace
[38:23] that's taken place in our lives
[38:26] and that's why i read that scripture to
[38:27] start
[38:29] for if if you remember
[38:31] probably don't but if you remember at
[38:32] least a little bit of what i spoke about
[38:34] last on this subject last time
[38:37] we talked about
[38:39] how
[38:42] you know there are scriptures that speak
[38:43] about people falling
[38:45] away
[38:47] and people it being impossible to renew
[38:50] them
[38:51] again unto repentance if they fall away
[38:54] talks about people that are they were
[38:57] once around among us
[38:59] they had faith etc
[39:02] um and we
[39:04] we read there
[39:05] in 1st john 2 19
[39:08] gives a good explanation of that
[39:11] i don't have that in my powerpoint but
[39:15] you can
[39:17] refer to it in the in your bible if you
[39:19] want to or i'll just read it and you can
[39:20] listen along
[39:22] they went out from us
[39:25] so they left they fell away
[39:27] why did they go out from us john
[39:30] they were not
[39:32] of us
[39:34] for if they had been of us
[39:36] they would no doubt have continued with
[39:38] us but they went out that they might be
[39:41] made manifest
[39:42] they were not all not
[39:44] of us
[39:46] so let's unpack that
[39:51] he's not talking about
[39:53] some group
[39:54] of people it's not talking about a
[39:56] specific local church as though this
[39:58] local church you know the baptist
[40:00] denomination or the message church
[40:03] everybody in the churches are
[40:05] saved and
[40:06] filled with the holy ghost and believers
[40:08] we know that that's not true that
[40:10] there's three kinds of believers in
[40:11] every church
[40:12] and
[40:14] you know we're looking at the mystical
[40:16] body of christ
[40:18] why did they leave why did they stop
[40:20] believing
[40:21] john
[40:23] they went out because they were not
[40:24] elect
[40:26] if they had been elect they would stay
[40:29] with
[40:30] the word they would stay in faith
[40:33] and again we talked about that before
[40:34] it's not that
[40:36] there are people who are genuinely
[40:38] filled with the holy ghost
[40:40] saved
[40:41] elect of god
[40:43] that
[40:44] make serious mistakes and fall miserably
[40:47] but god
[40:49] is ultimately going to save them restore
[40:52] them
[40:53] we've seen it people have experienced it
[40:56] it isn't saying that people never fall
[40:58] it's saying that god has them
[41:01] and he is going to keep them even
[41:03] through the fall but yet there are
[41:06] people that go out from us why because
[41:09] they were not of us
[41:11] if they would have had genuine faith
[41:13] given as a gift of god god doesn't give
[41:16] the gift and pull it away because if
[41:18] you you you
[41:21] earned the fact that he pulled it away
[41:23] you didn't earn the fact that he gave it
[41:24] to you and you can't
[41:27] do anything for him to take it away he
[41:29] never will
[41:30] the fact is that people heard responded
[41:32] but they never had true faith given to
[41:35] them as a gift by god they just had
[41:37] human faith
[41:38] and when when the circumstances arose
[41:41] the human faith failed and they walked
[41:43] away and john says why did they walk
[41:45] away they weren't of us they weren't
[41:47] elect
[41:48] they weren't predestinated in god before
[41:51] the foundation of the world so that's
[41:52] why there's people
[41:54] they draw near to god with their mouth
[41:57] but their heart is far from him
[41:59] that's why there's people that say lord
[42:01] lord
[42:02] haven't we prophesied and done many
[42:04] mighty works in your name and you'll say
[42:06] depart from me you were conic your
[42:07] workers iniquity of iniquity why because
[42:10] they didn't do the will of the father
[42:12] the father they didn't follow
[42:14] the word of god
[42:16] they follow their own mind their own
[42:18] will their own purpose
[42:23] all that for an explanation
[42:25] of
[42:26] back to romans 8 13.
[42:30] paul here
[42:32] puts it on us
[42:34] if you live after the flesh you will die
[42:36] wait a minute paul
[42:38] you wrote before that by grace are you
[42:41] saved through faith that not of
[42:43] yourselves it's the gift of work of god
[42:46] not of works lest any man should boast
[42:49] now you're saying if you live after the
[42:50] flesh you'll die but if you through the
[42:52] spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh
[42:54] you'll live
[42:56] you're putting it back on me as though i
[42:58] can earn eternal life
[43:01] no
[43:03] no
[43:04] that's not what he's doing he's saying
[43:06] if you have the gift of god
[43:10] you didn't earn it by works and you're
[43:12] not earn it earning it by mortifying the
[43:14] deeds of the body but if you have the
[43:17] spirit dwelling in you which is self his
[43:21] salvation
[43:22] if you have the spirit of god living in
[43:24] you
[43:25] it produces something inside of you what
[43:28] is that
[43:29] that you put to death
[43:32] the deeds of the body
[43:34] true and genuine spirit-filled
[43:37] faith
[43:39] given faith
[43:41] puts to death the deeds of the body
[43:46] human faith
[43:48] worldly faith
[43:50] will not do that right it will not
[43:52] accomplish that
[43:53] it will abide in sin it will make
[43:56] excuses it will justify
[43:59] true genuine faith
[44:01] puts to death
[44:02] the deeds
[44:03] of
[44:04] the flesh
[44:05] that doesn't mean there's not a struggle
[44:08] that doesn't mean
[44:09] there is in a long time
[44:11] maybe lifelong
[44:14] battle against
[44:15] specific sin in your life but ultimately
[44:19] you will humbly bow your head before god
[44:22] say
[44:23] help me put this to death amen i don't
[44:26] want this in my life i hate it
[44:30] i despise it
[44:31] may it be gone from me
[44:34] and god will give victory
[44:36] it might be at the end of your life
[44:38] that's okay that's in god's hands
[44:41] you don't accomplish
[44:43] your own salvation you don't accomplish
[44:46] your own sanctification
[44:49] it's a work of grace right three works
[44:51] of grace sanctification isn't a work of
[44:54] the flesh
[44:56] it isn't a work of your own will it
[44:58] isn't a work of your own power
[45:00] it's a work of god
[45:02] in
[45:03] you if you're if you have true genuine
[45:06] justification i'm talking bride
[45:08] justification
[45:10] new testament justification
[45:12] it results in produces sanctification
[45:17] and a sanctification that goes from now
[45:19] until you have a new body
[45:22] it's it's continual
[45:25] and that's what the spirit does within
[45:27] us
[45:28] isaiah
[45:29] i'm going to bring that up 66
[45:32] verse
[45:33] 2.
[45:37] for all those things hath mine a
[45:39] handmade
[45:40] and all those things have been saith the
[45:42] lord but to this man will i
[45:44] look this is the kind of condition
[45:48] of a man that god will look to dwell in
[45:53] you know it's talking about his dwelling
[45:54] place in isaiah 66
[45:57] heaven is my throne earth is my
[45:59] footstool
[46:00] where is the place of my rest
[46:03] he says oh i've made all this all this
[46:05] has been i've done it
[46:07] where but to this man will i look this
[46:09] is the place i want to live and dwell in
[46:12] amen this is the condition of the heart
[46:16] of the godly man that i want to live in
[46:19] even to him that is poor
[46:22] and of a contrite spirit
[46:24] and trembles at my word amen
[46:28] do you tremble at the word of god
[46:31] amen
[46:33] you should you say well i have no fear
[46:36] god loves me well
[46:39] that's
[46:40] god does love you but you have to
[46:42] understand
[46:44] god still is a consuming fire
[46:48] god is a just god he's a good god
[46:51] but he's a just god and he will give
[46:54] to every man according to his works
[46:58] we will all stand before the judgment
[47:00] seat of christ no it's not a judgment to
[47:03] condemnation but it is a judgment of our
[47:05] works done in our body
[47:07] unto
[47:08] reward
[47:10] some will be saved
[47:12] smelling of smoke the bible says
[47:16] others they'll build
[47:18] gold
[47:20] precious stones some build on the
[47:22] foundation hay and stubble the the fire
[47:26] will declare what kind of works
[47:28] your life
[47:30] has produced right
[47:32] some will be burnt up they'll be saved
[47:35] and they'll smell a fire
[47:38] the others will be purified
[47:41] by the fire amen
[47:44] hymn that is of a contrite spirit and
[47:46] trembles at my word that's
[47:48] that's what the
[47:50] new birth produces
[47:52] in a man or a woman
[47:54] a poor not a proud spirit
[47:57] a poor a contrite a humble spirit
[48:00] one that trembles at the word of god
[48:04] one that just doesn't pass over quickly
[48:06] and say oh
[48:07] it doesn't matter god will forgive me
[48:10] that's a sign that's a bad sign
[48:13] that's a really uh
[48:17] disgusting spirit around you that would
[48:19] say that it doesn't matter
[48:23] if you love god you don't want to hurt
[48:24] him not what the prophet told us
[48:28] you say but he
[48:29] he looks at me he sees the blood
[48:31] absolutely but it also says if if you
[48:34] sin
[48:35] you need to confess your sins he's
[48:37] faithful and just to forgive your sins
[48:40] it also says if you don't forgive
[48:43] those who have sinned against you
[48:44] neither will your father in heaven
[48:46] forgive you
[48:47] these are things that should cause us to
[48:48] tremble
[48:50] at his word
[48:52] it's not as though you know god leaves
[48:54] that on us period
[48:56] god is working all along
[48:59] but we have to respond to it
[49:02] we read that quote the other day you see
[49:05] 1962 a marriage of the lamb if you want
[49:07] to
[49:08] pull it up again
[49:10] i'm not sure if i can control it
[49:13] back here
[49:18] yeah
[49:19] you you see god could not push us
[49:21] through
[49:23] a little pipe pull us out on the other
[49:24] end and then saying blessed is he that
[49:27] overcometh you had nothing to overcome
[49:29] he just pushed you through but you've
[49:31] got to make decisions for yourself
[49:34] i have to make decisions for myself in
[49:36] doing that
[49:37] we show our faith and respects
[49:40] to god
[49:49] let me go back
[49:50] to philippians 2
[49:54] yeah
[49:56] so let's look at that in the context of
[49:58] of this verse
[50:00] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[50:02] obeyed not as in my presence only
[50:04] but now much more in my absence work out
[50:07] your own salvation
[50:10] with
[50:11] fear and trembling remember we read that
[50:14] he that trembles at my word
[50:16] so work out your own
[50:19] salvation
[50:20] with fear and trembling the work out
[50:23] there
[50:24] is not speaking of labor
[50:26] in that sense it's speaking of
[50:29] working out a mathematical problem
[50:33] in other words you're carrying it to its
[50:36] expected end 2 plus two equals four
[50:40] so as a christian we're going to carry
[50:43] out
[50:44] our salvation
[50:46] to what it equals to
[50:48] right right we're going to do the things
[50:50] that god wants us to do
[50:53] we're going to walk in obedience to him
[50:56] we're going to repent when we sin
[50:58] we're going to make things right with
[51:00] people
[51:01] we're going to be givers we're going
[51:03] we're going to
[51:04] read the word we're going to pray we're
[51:06] going to pray for each other we're going
[51:08] to exhort each other the things the
[51:10] scripture commands us to do
[51:12] we walk in obedience to them
[51:15] we don't have to make up our own
[51:16] equation the equation is already set
[51:18] amen
[51:20] but we
[51:21] need to follow the word of god work it
[51:23] out with your own
[51:25] with your own salvation with fear and
[51:27] trembling
[51:28] why
[51:30] for it is god
[51:31] which worketh in you both to will
[51:35] and to do
[51:37] of his good pleasure so how are you
[51:39] working out your own salvation
[51:44] in your own
[51:45] power and strength
[51:48] no it's god who's energizing you
[51:52] god who puts his power
[51:54] in you
[51:55] both to ch to will means to choose
[51:59] so how are you choosing and making the
[52:01] decision
[52:03] to work out your salvation
[52:06] god is working in you to will
[52:09] and to do of his good pleasure
[52:12] so no he doesn't push you through a pipe
[52:15] you have to
[52:17] walk with him
[52:18] you have to live for him
[52:20] you have to respond to him
[52:23] but we understand that actually in all
[52:25] this it's god working in us
[52:28] paul says i think in
[52:30] i guess first corinthians
[52:32] 15 that he labored more than all the
[52:35] other apostles
[52:38] it's quite a statement i worked harder
[52:40] than everyone yeah
[52:42] yeah what did he say right behind that
[52:44] yet
[52:45] not i
[52:47] but the grace of god that was in me
[52:51] so this there's this working that you
[52:53] and i do
[52:54] this effort that we put in but
[52:57] ultimately we understand it's god in
[53:00] there
[53:01] working and moving
[53:03] amen
[53:04] [Music]
[53:08] let's go on to uh
[53:10] yes
[53:12] brother branham says this
[53:14] so if you ever want to pray for me this
[53:16] is in the sermon show us the father and
[53:17] will satisfy so if you ever want to pray
[53:20] for me it's not to have money not to
[53:21] have big homes or be popular
[53:23] but just pray that i can stay in the
[53:25] hands of christ mold clay that he can
[53:28] mold me and use me in any way that he
[53:30] sees fit to do
[53:32] i'll pray the same thing for you that
[53:34] you'll be the same way
[53:36] so no god doesn't push us through a pipe
[53:39] and yet
[53:40] we're clay
[53:42] he molds us
[53:43] he shapes us
[53:45] he works in us so you have to have both
[53:46] sides it's not just we're going to take
[53:49] this quote
[53:50] and this quote and we're going to cause
[53:53] them to fight against each other or this
[53:54] scripture in this scripture i mean right
[53:56] there
[53:57] in philippians chapter 2 he says work
[53:59] out your own salvation
[54:01] i'm going
[54:03] oh it's getting hot in here i'm not sure
[54:05] how that's going to work
[54:07] i can't work out my own salvation paul
[54:10] and then right behind it he comforts us
[54:12] with those words
[54:15] it's god working in you both to will
[54:18] and to do of his good pleasure
[54:20] but he he didn't just leave it as god
[54:23] working in you he's saying you work it
[54:24] out because it's god working
[54:28] they both go hand in hand and they're
[54:29] both important
[54:31] first john 3 verse 3
[54:35] and every man that has this hope in him
[54:38] purifies himself even as he
[54:42] is pure i love that
[54:44] so if
[54:46] you're elect
[54:48] if you're truly filled with the spirit
[54:50] of god you have that hope in you
[54:53] what is it
[54:54] you you purify yourself
[54:57] even as
[54:58] god himself is pure
[55:00] god is in you
[55:02] you'll be purified by the pure one
[55:06] first john
[55:07] 2 verse 29 if you know that he is
[55:10] righteous
[55:11] you know that everyone that does
[55:13] righteousness is born of him amen
[55:17] again
[55:18] very clear scriptures
[55:20] if you're
[55:21] if you're of this opinion and idea that
[55:25] we're saved by the grace of god
[55:27] and we don't have to live a righteous
[55:29] life
[55:31] that's that's what john is writing to
[55:34] that god's grace is free and full it
[55:36] matters not how we live we can live any
[55:39] way
[55:40] we choose to live and he says
[55:42] if you do righteousness you're born of
[55:44] him
[55:46] now in in a way you look that at that
[55:49] and say oh my so is it my righteousness
[55:52] that makes me born of him
[55:54] no
[55:56] no that's not what's being said it's
[55:57] saying it's looking at the outward to
[56:00] the inward
[56:02] paul is looking from
[56:04] the outward
[56:06] to the inward in philippians 2
[56:08] right
[56:09] other places he looks from the inward to
[56:11] the outward but this one is saying
[56:14] hey you think that you're born of god
[56:16] without doing righteousness
[56:19] you've got it you got it wrong
[56:22] if you're doing righteousness you're
[56:23] born of him yeah
[56:25] in other words what produces
[56:27] righteousness amen right
[56:29] being born of him
[56:31] so being born of him you will live
[56:34] a righteous life
[56:36] a just life before god
[56:39] you're not going to be living sloppy
[56:41] any old way you're going to be living as
[56:44] a reflection of jesus christ
[56:48] first john 4 7
[56:51] beloved let us love one another for love
[56:54] is of god and everyone that loveth is
[56:56] born of god and knoweth god
[56:59] again
[57:01] if you love you're born of god does that
[57:03] mean i have to love to get born of god
[57:06] no
[57:07] you love him
[57:09] because he first loved you we love as a
[57:12] result of his love being placed upon us
[57:15] but when his love is placed upon us
[57:18] it produces
[57:19] it produces something
[57:21] right it produces a life of
[57:24] agape love
[57:28] not just lip service reality
[57:30] amen
[57:33] people
[57:34] misunderstand
[57:37] what love is
[57:39] we were talking about that on
[57:41] on sunday and sunday school
[57:43] and people get love as this
[57:45] sloppy thing
[57:47] love is corrective
[57:48] love is compassionate
[57:51] love reaches
[57:52] out love does
[57:55] love doesn't just
[57:56] sit back and say
[57:58] i love brother brad i see that he's you
[58:00] know dying on the street but that's fine
[58:02] i love him
[58:04] love says oh
[58:05] i gotta i've gotta help i've gotta do
[58:07] something all right
[58:10] uh first john
[58:12] 5 18. we know that who whosoever is born
[58:15] of god
[58:17] sins not ooh
[58:19] but he that is begotten of god keeps
[58:21] himself and that wicked one
[58:24] touches him
[58:25] not
[58:27] what does that mean because
[58:28] if that's if we're to take that lock
[58:31] stock and barrel literally
[58:33] i know i'm disqualified
[58:36] but we can't take it lock stock and
[58:37] barrel because he starts the book out
[58:40] saying
[58:40] if you say you don't have any sin you're
[58:42] a liar
[58:44] so what is he what is he trying to
[58:47] point out here
[58:50] i i
[58:52] it could be something else but i'll just
[58:54] put it this way
[58:55] uh on the one hand you look at god god
[58:58] justifying us
[59:00] and he he
[59:02] he looks at us and says you've never
[59:03] sinned in the first place
[59:05] so you could look at it from that
[59:07] direction or you could look at it also
[59:08] in the direction that
[59:10] the person that's born of god doesn't
[59:12] make a practice of continuing and
[59:15] abiding continuously in sin amen
[59:19] you know a believer is in a continual
[59:21] process of purging himself
[59:24] from sin we saw that before
[59:27] if you're you're born of god
[59:29] or if you have that hope
[59:31] in yourself
[59:32] you purify yourself even as he
[59:35] is pure we don't just sin continue if
[59:38] you look at it from that context that
[59:40] john is writing to people that are
[59:41] abusing
[59:42] what paul is preaching on the grace of
[59:45] god
[59:46] in the sense that you know let a sin
[59:48] that grace may abound
[59:50] if you look at it that in that sense
[59:51] you'll see whoever's born of god sins
[59:54] not i mean that's wrapping them on the
[59:56] fingers and saying
[59:57] if you have
[59:58] the new birth
[1:00:00] you're not going to be walking in a
[1:00:02] sinful lifestyle on a continual basis
[1:00:05] you'll be purging yourself and you'll
[1:00:07] not be walking and living
[1:00:10] in sin
[1:00:11] before god
[1:00:18] philippians 1 6 we referred to it before
[1:00:20] but just as we kind of close this
[1:00:23] portion of talking about election and
[1:00:25] move on
[1:00:27] to the next
[1:00:29] sub-topic
[1:00:32] he that began a good work in you will be
[1:00:34] faithful to complete it
[1:00:36] until the day of jesus christ
[1:00:39] that is ultimately what we're talking
[1:00:41] about when we talk about eternal
[1:00:42] security it's talking about the one who
[1:00:45] started the work will continue it and
[1:00:47] finish it it's not talking about he
[1:00:49] started to work and there's nothing else
[1:00:51] going on we just believe and we'll be
[1:00:53] saved there's nothing happening it's
[1:00:55] it's literally talking about he will
[1:00:58] keep us
[1:00:59] and preserve us
[1:01:01] until the day of jesus christ
[1:01:04] he will strengthen us to abide
[1:01:06] and stay and walk
[1:01:08] in christ through many ups and downs
[1:01:12] through many
[1:01:13] falls through many
[1:01:14] sins but will keep getting up and will
[1:01:17] keep walking because it's god working in
[1:01:20] us
[1:01:21] and he'll be faithful to complete it
[1:01:24] so
[1:01:28] next part is looking at
[1:01:32] that christ and you'll recognize this
[1:01:34] from quotes but christ died
[1:01:37] only for those whose names are written
[1:01:39] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:01:41] foundation of the world
[1:01:44] he dies only
[1:01:45] for the elect
[1:01:47] now
[1:01:48] we understand salvation is offered to
[1:01:50] all
[1:01:52] his blood is sufficient
[1:01:55] for all
[1:01:56] and yet god is not
[1:02:00] running his great drama
[1:02:02] of redemption and saying i hope some
[1:02:05] people
[1:02:06] respond
[1:02:08] he has a specific plan
[1:02:11] a specific purpose christ came he died
[1:02:14] exactly for that purpose
[1:02:17] for the elect
[1:02:19] he wiped all their sins away
[1:02:22] completely amen from start to finish
[1:02:25] but it was for specific people
[1:02:28] he did not die
[1:02:30] for
[1:02:30] every single human being in all of
[1:02:33] history if he died for every single
[1:02:35] human being in all of history
[1:02:37] every single human being in all of
[1:02:39] history would be saved
[1:02:41] but not every single human being in all
[1:02:43] of history is saved
[1:02:44] so we'll look at the scriptures
[1:02:46] first one is revelation 13 verse 8
[1:02:50] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:02:52] worship him whose names are not
[1:02:54] written in the book of the life of the
[1:02:56] land book of life of the lamb slain
[1:03:00] from the foundation of the world so
[1:03:02] there's people whose names are already
[1:03:04] on that book of life they're written
[1:03:06] there and they're written before the
[1:03:08] foundation of the world amen the next
[1:03:10] one
[1:03:12] revelation 17 verse 8 the beast that you
[1:03:15] saw was and is not and shall ascend out
[1:03:17] of the bottomless pit and go into
[1:03:19] perdition and they that dwell on the
[1:03:20] earth shall wonder whose names were not
[1:03:22] written
[1:03:23] in the book of life from the foundation
[1:03:25] of the world
[1:03:26] when they behold the beast that was and
[1:03:29] is not and yet
[1:03:32] is
[1:03:35] so those are the ones
[1:03:37] that he was slain for
[1:03:39] those are the ones that he died for
[1:03:42] everyone whose name was written on that
[1:03:44] book
[1:03:45] he died for them
[1:03:47] proving his word brother branham says
[1:03:49] this
[1:03:51] now that's a big word predestinate but
[1:03:52] we all know it's the truth we absolutely
[1:03:55] know that the infinite god predestinated
[1:03:58] all things by foreknowledge before the
[1:04:00] foundation of the world even the lamb
[1:04:02] was slain and every name that would ever
[1:04:04] be on the book was put on the book
[1:04:05] before the book was ever written now how
[1:04:07] many knows that's true and jesus came to
[1:04:09] redeem those that were in the book in
[1:04:12] the bible the land came from the behind
[1:04:14] the curtain and taken the book and
[1:04:15] opened the seals that it was sealed with
[1:04:17] for he came to claim all that he had
[1:04:19] redeemed he's the intercessor now an
[1:04:20] intercessor making intercessions
[1:04:23] for those who he has redeemed all whose
[1:04:25] names was written on the lamb's book of
[1:04:28] life
[1:04:29] is redeemed
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:34] so john 3 16 is the very first verse
[1:04:37] that people will bring up when they want
[1:04:39] to prove this is contrary to scripture
[1:04:43] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:04:44] only begotten son that whoever believes
[1:04:46] in him
[1:04:47] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:04:49] life
[1:04:50] so god so loved the world
[1:04:54] that he gave his only begotten son so it
[1:04:56] must be that he died
[1:04:58] for the whole world
[1:05:02] well
[1:05:03] we'll look at that
[1:05:05] in more in more depth in the scripture
[1:05:07] who did he die for
[1:05:09] but before we get there i want to read
[1:05:11] ii peter
[1:05:12] 3 verse 9
[1:05:15] and we want to look at the will of god
[1:05:18] we speak of the will of god
[1:05:20] and we all know there's the perfect will
[1:05:22] of god the permissive will of god
[1:05:25] and there's different ways even the
[1:05:27] scripture speaks about the will of god
[1:05:30] ii peter 3 9 the lord is not slack
[1:05:32] concerning his promise
[1:05:34] as some men count slackness but is
[1:05:36] long-suffering to us word
[1:05:39] not willing that any should perish but
[1:05:41] that all
[1:05:42] should come to repentance so not willing
[1:05:47] so willing is the word we're looking
[1:05:49] that god is not willing
[1:05:53] so i'm going to look there's three
[1:05:54] different ways
[1:05:56] and there's there's more ways than that
[1:05:58] but
[1:05:58] three main ways i want to talk about
[1:06:00] tonight that god
[1:06:02] it's that the bible speaks of the will
[1:06:04] of god
[1:06:05] first the bible speaks of the sovereign
[1:06:07] will of god
[1:06:09] whatever god decrees he does it before
[1:06:11] the foundation of the world and that
[1:06:13] will come to pass there's nothing that's
[1:06:15] going to stop it there's nothing that's
[1:06:17] gonna thwart it nothing will get in the
[1:06:19] way of god working out
[1:06:21] that will which he has declared before
[1:06:24] the foundation of the world
[1:06:27] next one is how god makes his
[1:06:30] declaration of himself
[1:06:32] uh by
[1:06:34] the word
[1:06:35] he declares his word and he wants us to
[1:06:37] walk in obedience to it
[1:06:39] so that is the will of god
[1:06:42] for us how do we know god's will for you
[1:06:44] and you and me
[1:06:46] we read this book
[1:06:48] then we know the will of god for for us
[1:06:51] do we always follow the will of god
[1:06:53] in this book
[1:06:54] no we don't
[1:06:57] and so that's called sin
[1:06:59] when we
[1:07:01] don't believe and don't walk in
[1:07:02] obedience to the word of god
[1:07:06] and so
[1:07:08] that is
[1:07:09] that was in the sovereign
[1:07:12] will of god
[1:07:13] declared before the foundation of the
[1:07:15] world
[1:07:16] even though it's contrary to his
[1:07:18] declared word written in scripture
[1:07:21] and then the third third
[1:07:23] way the bible speaks about it
[1:07:26] is like human-like
[1:07:28] uh
[1:07:29] expressions of god
[1:07:31] you know that god uh
[1:07:33] burned an anger toward the children of
[1:07:35] israel
[1:07:37] and it's like
[1:07:38] god repented that he made man upon the
[1:07:41] earth
[1:07:42] well
[1:07:43] god knew
[1:07:45] when he made man before the world was
[1:07:46] ever created
[1:07:48] that they were going to sin that he was
[1:07:49] going to drown the earth in water
[1:07:53] none of that caught god off guard he
[1:07:56] planned it that way right it was his
[1:07:58] purpose and yet we he it speaks in a
[1:08:01] human-like
[1:08:02] expression of god's will in the sense of
[1:08:05] emotions
[1:08:07] this is how this is god
[1:08:09] in his heart towards the world right
[1:08:13] we know that that's
[1:08:14] that's not the only way that we look at
[1:08:16] the will of god because we understand
[1:08:18] nothing cuts him off guard he planned it
[1:08:20] that way
[1:08:21] so in this
[1:08:24] let's go back to the previous verse
[1:08:28] god is not willing that any should
[1:08:30] perish
[1:08:32] so
[1:08:34] does that mean that god was
[1:08:36] unable to save some people
[1:08:40] that god was
[1:08:42] not omnipotent
[1:08:46] that he lacked the power to save people
[1:08:50] no
[1:08:51] of course not
[1:08:52] this is speaking on a human
[1:08:54] human level
[1:08:56] god's heart towards the world he's not
[1:08:58] willing he doesn't want anyone to perish
[1:09:03] but look at it closer and notice that it
[1:09:06] says long suffering
[1:09:07] not to everyone
[1:09:10] long suffering to us word
[1:09:13] not willing that any should perish so
[1:09:15] the us word qualifies when he says any
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:22] so he doesn't mean any as in the whole
[1:09:24] human race from all of history
[1:09:27] it's qualified us word whose us word
[1:09:30] god's elect
[1:09:35] again god's not a spectator
[1:09:38] in his great drama of redemption
[1:09:41] he is working all things after the
[1:09:43] counsel of his own will
[1:09:45] ephesians 1 11.
[1:09:49] all right go ahead to the next one
[1:09:52] john 6 37 all that the father giveth me
[1:09:56] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:09:59] me
[1:09:59] i will in no wise cast out that that
[1:10:01] looks at it from both directions
[1:10:04] anyone that puts their
[1:10:06] trust and faith in jesus christ
[1:10:09] will be saved
[1:10:12] but remember
[1:10:14] we're not talking about human faith
[1:10:17] that has nothing to do with salvation
[1:10:20] we're talking about the faith that is
[1:10:21] given as a gift from god
[1:10:24] the faith of jesus christ imparted to us
[1:10:27] as a believer
[1:10:30] that's what that's the faith that god
[1:10:32] recognized
[1:10:35] all the father given me will come
[1:10:37] that's the other side of it is not
[1:10:39] everyone comes to christ how do we
[1:10:41] explain that because
[1:10:43] they're not ordained to do it
[1:10:45] they're not ones that the father is
[1:10:46] given next verse
[1:10:51] john 6 39 and this is the father's will
[1:10:53] which has sent me that of all which he
[1:10:56] has given me i should lose nothing but
[1:10:58] should raise it up again at the last day
[1:11:01] do you think jesus has lost anyone
[1:11:06] he said all power in heaven and earth is
[1:11:09] given unto me
[1:11:10] amen so omnipotent power is in the hands
[1:11:14] of jesus christ
[1:11:16] he will lose not a single one
[1:11:19] everyone that god has
[1:11:21] chosen from before the foundation of the
[1:11:22] world christ will bring through
[1:11:26] next one
[1:11:29] john 17 2 as thou has given him power
[1:11:32] over all flesh
[1:11:34] that he should give eternal life to as
[1:11:37] many
[1:11:38] as thou hast given him
[1:11:41] doesn't say he gives eternal life to all
[1:11:43] flesh
[1:11:45] he gives eternal life to the ones that
[1:11:47] are given
[1:11:48] to him what does that mean the ones that
[1:11:51] god chose in christ before the
[1:11:53] foundation of the world amen next one
[1:11:57] i have manifested thy name unto the men
[1:12:00] which thou gavest me out of the world
[1:12:02] thy they were and thou gavest them me
[1:12:04] and they have kept
[1:12:06] thy
[1:12:07] word he wasn't sent to everyone was he
[1:12:11] he was sent to manifest
[1:12:13] god's name
[1:12:15] to the men which were given to him
[1:12:17] just to those next verse
[1:12:21] i pray for them
[1:12:23] this is shocking
[1:12:25] i pray not for the world
[1:12:28] amen oh jesus
[1:12:30] how can you say that you should be
[1:12:32] praying for the whole world that wasn't
[1:12:34] his job that's not what he was sent to
[1:12:37] do
[1:12:39] i pray for the ones you've given me i
[1:12:42] pray for the elect
[1:12:45] next one
[1:12:48] verse 24 father i will that they also
[1:12:51] whom thou has given me
[1:12:53] be with me where i am that they may
[1:12:55] behold my glory which thou has given me
[1:12:58] for thou lovest me before the foundation
[1:13:01] of the world
[1:13:03] doesn't pray for everyone this is
[1:13:05] christ's intercessory prayer
[1:13:08] before he goes to calvary
[1:13:12] he's interceding not for everyone but
[1:13:14] for the ones that the father gave him
[1:13:19] that they would be
[1:13:21] in heaven together amen
[1:13:23] next verse
[1:13:26] isaiah 53 8
[1:13:29] he was taken from prison and from
[1:13:31] judgment
[1:13:32] and who shall declare his generation for
[1:13:35] he was cut off out of the land of the
[1:13:37] living
[1:13:38] for the transgression of my
[1:13:42] people was he stricken
[1:13:46] the whole world was he stricken no
[1:13:49] my people god's people god's elect
[1:13:52] next verse
[1:13:57] 53 verse 11 he shall see of the travail
[1:13:59] of his soul
[1:14:01] and shall be satisfied by his
[1:14:04] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:14:07] justify all
[1:14:10] no justify many
[1:14:12] for he shall bear their iniquities it's
[1:14:15] many not all
[1:14:19] next verse john 10 verse 15
[1:14:22] as the father knoweth me
[1:14:24] even so i know i the father
[1:14:27] and i lay down my life for the sheep
[1:14:31] who did christ come to die for
[1:14:34] he didn't come to die for the goats
[1:14:37] he came to die for the sheep that's who
[1:14:40] he laid the ones that the father had
[1:14:42] given him
[1:14:43] that's who he's laying his life down for
[1:14:46] the ones who he was sent to manifest his
[1:14:48] god's name to
[1:14:51] those are the ones the ones he was
[1:14:52] praying for i don't pray for the world i
[1:14:54] pray for the ones you've given me
[1:14:59] brother branham says this in the hebrew
[1:15:02] series he wasn't willing that you should
[1:15:03] be perished you would perish but him
[1:15:05] being infinite he had to know the end
[1:15:07] from the beginning or he isn't god so
[1:15:09] jesus never come to earth to say well
[1:15:11] i'll just see if somebody be mercy if i
[1:15:13] act to die in a hard way they'll
[1:15:15] probably think well
[1:15:16] it'll persuade their hearts and they'll
[1:15:18] god don't run his business like that
[1:15:20] jesus came for one purpose that's to
[1:15:23] save those who god before the foundation
[1:15:25] of the world knew would be saved he said
[1:15:27] so that's right it's not him that
[1:15:29] willeth or him that runeth it's god that
[1:15:31] showeth
[1:15:32] mercy amen
[1:15:34] thank you
[1:15:36] so
[1:15:37] as we said before if christ
[1:15:39] died
[1:15:41] for the sins of the whole world every
[1:15:43] person
[1:15:44] would be saved
[1:15:45] because that's how effective his blood
[1:15:47] is
[1:15:49] his blood is effective if it if god
[1:15:51] would have said this forgives an
[1:15:53] infinite number of sins then it would
[1:15:56] but that's not what he said
[1:15:58] he said he'll die for my people
[1:16:01] i came down to lay down my life for my
[1:16:04] sheep he'll justify many
[1:16:12] our sins
[1:16:15] our sins are completely dealt with
[1:16:18] at calvary amen that's why we can have
[1:16:21] that you know this is something we can
[1:16:22] have confidence
[1:16:24] in the blood of jesus christ it is sent
[1:16:27] for a specific purpose
[1:16:29] according to scripture
[1:16:31] to forgive my sins to forgive your sins
[1:16:35] specifically every one of those sins was
[1:16:38] it wasn't as though god said well
[1:16:40] all the sins of the world i don't know
[1:16:42] what's going to happen but you know
[1:16:44] there's been a lot of sins let's throw
[1:16:45] them on jesus
[1:16:46] and see kind of what sticks
[1:16:49] there and if anybody believes in him
[1:16:52] you know it'll work for him
[1:16:54] i mean
[1:16:56] that's crazy
[1:16:58] he took he knew what sins he was dying
[1:17:00] for he took my sins
[1:17:03] specific ones exact ones precise ones
[1:17:07] and they were there put upon christ in
[1:17:10] gethsemane
[1:17:12] and he was forsaken and he was bruised
[1:17:15] for my
[1:17:16] iniquities
[1:17:20] it's very that's that's our god our god
[1:17:23] is exact and specific he's not generic
[1:17:27] he knows exactly
[1:17:30] what he's doing
[1:17:34] god never fails
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:37] god never fails he doesn't just throw
[1:17:40] throw the gospel net out and wonder
[1:17:42] what's going to happen
[1:17:44] he has the the plan is perfectly laid
[1:17:47] out
[1:17:48] the sins are perfectly atoned for
[1:17:51] he knows the very moment you're going to
[1:17:54] receive the holy coast or that you did
[1:17:56] receive the holy ghost
[1:17:58] all of that is pre-planned by god before
[1:18:01] the world was ever created
[1:18:03] brother branham says even
[1:18:05] every time that a flea would bat its eye
[1:18:08] something as insignificant as a flea
[1:18:11] god knows how many times it bats its eye
[1:18:15] one flea
[1:18:16] he knows how many hairs that brother
[1:18:18] luther lost
[1:18:22] and he knows how many hairs he still has
[1:18:26] and he's going to give every one of them
[1:18:28] back to him one day
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:33] did jesus lose anyone
[1:18:36] he's never lost
[1:18:38] one of his sheep he couldn't possibly do
[1:18:40] it
[1:18:42] does christ intercede for the whole
[1:18:44] world
[1:18:48] he he said he didn't i don't pray for
[1:18:51] the world
[1:18:54] i pray for the ones you've given me
[1:18:57] even the intercession the mediatorship
[1:19:00] of christ
[1:19:01] is very specific and targeted and exact
[1:19:09] uh romans 8 33 and 34
[1:19:13] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:19:16] god's elect it is god
[1:19:19] that justifies
[1:19:21] so the implication is there's no one
[1:19:23] that's going to lay anything to the
[1:19:24] charge of god's elect
[1:19:27] it's completely impossible the highest
[1:19:29] judge
[1:19:31] of all the earth
[1:19:32] that's what abraham called him the judge
[1:19:35] shall not the judge of all the earth do
[1:19:37] right
[1:19:39] so he's the judge of all the earth
[1:19:41] it's god that justifies so you're
[1:19:44] you're making accusations but they're
[1:19:45] not sticking satan amen amen who is he
[1:19:49] that condemns
[1:19:51] so who's the one that can raise up
[1:19:53] and bring articles of condemnation
[1:19:56] against brother brad
[1:19:58] it's christ that died yeah yeah rather
[1:20:00] that is risen again who's even at the
[1:20:02] right hand of god who also
[1:20:05] makes intercession for us yes
[1:20:09] we got this we got this salvation thing
[1:20:12] wrapped up
[1:20:14] it's all taken care of
[1:20:16] we have god justifying us we have christ
[1:20:19] interceding for us
[1:20:22] there's he's not going to lose one
[1:20:24] amen next verse
[1:20:30] matthew 1 21 and she shall bring forth a
[1:20:33] son
[1:20:34] and thou shalt call his name jesus for
[1:20:36] he shall save
[1:20:38] who his people
[1:20:40] from their sins
[1:20:43] next verse
[1:20:47] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:20:49] ministered unto but to minister
[1:20:52] and to give his life a ransom for
[1:20:55] many
[1:20:58] next verse
[1:21:02] blessed be the lord god of israel for he
[1:21:05] hath visited
[1:21:06] and redeemed his people not all people
[1:21:11] his
[1:21:12] people next verse
[1:21:16] i am the good shepherd the good shepherd
[1:21:18] gives his life for the sheep
[1:21:22] next verse
[1:21:24] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:21:25] to all the flock over the which the holy
[1:21:27] ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[1:21:29] the church of god which he hath
[1:21:31] purchased
[1:21:32] with his own blood
[1:21:34] who did he purchase the whole world no
[1:21:37] the church of god the elect of god
[1:21:42] next verse john 11
[1:21:44] 49-52 and some of some and one of them
[1:21:47] named caiaphas being the high priest
[1:21:49] that same year said unto them you know
[1:21:51] nothing at all
[1:21:52] nor consider that is it expedient for us
[1:21:55] that one man should die for the people
[1:21:58] and that the whole nation perished not
[1:22:01] and this spake he not of himself being
[1:22:03] high priest that year he prophesied that
[1:22:05] jesus should die
[1:22:06] for that nation
[1:22:08] and not for that nation only
[1:22:10] but that also he should gather together
[1:22:13] in one the children of god that were
[1:22:15] scattered
[1:22:16] abroad
[1:22:20] i love that
[1:22:22] i love how john speaks of that that it's
[1:22:25] he's laying down his life for who
[1:22:27] everyone
[1:22:28] i know the children of god which are
[1:22:30] scattered gentiles
[1:22:32] not just for jewish children of god but
[1:22:35] for gentile
[1:22:37] children of god
[1:22:39] specific first
[1:22:41] timothy 2
[1:22:45] a few
[1:22:46] verses that people will bring as
[1:22:48] objections
[1:22:49] for there is one god and one mediator
[1:22:51] between god and men the man
[1:22:54] christ jesus who gave himself
[1:22:56] a ransom for all to be testified
[1:23:00] in due time uh oh jason you're in
[1:23:03] trouble
[1:23:06] he gave himself as a ransom for all now
[1:23:08] number one
[1:23:10] we can never take a multitude of verses
[1:23:14] and try to reinterpret those verses
[1:23:17] based on one
[1:23:18] verse scripture interprets itself
[1:23:21] same thing that we look at the godhead
[1:23:25] you don't just take one verse and
[1:23:26] isolate it again you don't take matthew
[1:23:29] 28 19 and isolate it against the
[1:23:31] scriptures in the book of acts
[1:23:34] you don't take first john 5 7 and
[1:23:36] isolate it against
[1:23:38] the rest of the whole scripture
[1:23:41] you have to understand each of them
[1:23:43] and bringing a
[1:23:47] proper balance and blend
[1:23:49] to the whole situation
[1:23:52] so
[1:23:53] you know let's look at uh i think the
[1:23:55] next one up there is um
[1:23:57] mark
[1:23:58] 1 verse 5.
[1:24:01] you know
[1:24:03] well let's read it and there went out
[1:24:05] unto him all the land of judea and they
[1:24:08] of jerusalem and were all baptized
[1:24:11] of him
[1:24:12] in the river of jordan confessing their
[1:24:14] sins
[1:24:17] so
[1:24:19] if we take this verse
[1:24:21] at face value isolated against the rest
[1:24:24] of the gospel story
[1:24:26] we would be quite confused
[1:24:29] here we have
[1:24:31] all the land of judea is responding
[1:24:34] to the message of john
[1:24:36] and every one of them goes out
[1:24:39] and is baptized by john the baptist
[1:24:43] in the jordan river
[1:24:45] we know as a fact based on the gospel
[1:24:47] narrative
[1:24:48] not every single person
[1:24:50] agreed with john
[1:24:52] not every single person believed john
[1:24:56] many people rejected john so what does
[1:24:59] it mean
[1:25:02] what is the picture that's being painted
[1:25:03] here
[1:25:05] well
[1:25:07] let's the next verse i think is
[1:25:09] got luke 7 30 but the pharisees and
[1:25:11] lawyers
[1:25:12] rejected the counsel of god against
[1:25:15] themselves being not
[1:25:17] baptized
[1:25:19] of him
[1:25:21] amen
[1:25:24] so all
[1:25:25] and then here's not some of them were
[1:25:27] not
[1:25:28] so how do we how do we arrive here
[1:25:31] i mean it's pretty simple plain language
[1:25:33] it's it's
[1:25:34] it's simply saying a vast number of
[1:25:36] people from all ranks and societies went
[1:25:39] out to be baptized by john
[1:25:42] not literally every single person
[1:25:45] but many many many many many many many a
[1:25:47] huge number of people went out
[1:25:50] that it was everyone was shocked
[1:25:52] that's why the big
[1:25:54] superlative
[1:25:56] amount is used all of them went out and
[1:25:58] they were all baptized
[1:26:01] no not literally every single person we
[1:26:04] know that
[1:26:07] so all of what you know it can also be
[1:26:11] the bible can speak uh
[1:26:13] uh we read it before i think it was in
[1:26:16] revelation
[1:26:19] 13 verse 8 and all that dwell
[1:26:22] upon the earth shall worship him whose
[1:26:24] names are not written in the book of
[1:26:26] life of the lamb
[1:26:27] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:26:30] so the whole all that dwell upon the
[1:26:32] earth will worship him well we know
[1:26:34] by scripture not every single person
[1:26:36] there's elected that don't
[1:26:39] so it's not all in that sense it means
[1:26:42] all of a group
[1:26:44] all of what group all of the ones who
[1:26:46] are not
[1:26:47] written in the lamb's book of life from
[1:26:50] before the foundation of the world all
[1:26:52] of that group
[1:26:53] so what is this saying they all went out
[1:26:56] they were all baptized
[1:26:58] a big group of people went out and a big
[1:27:01] group of people was baptized from every
[1:27:03] station of life from
[1:27:05] important people to the poor person to
[1:27:08] the average person they all went out and
[1:27:10] were baptized
[1:27:12] so
[1:27:13] christ gave his life as a ransom for
[1:27:17] all
[1:27:19] all who
[1:27:21] context of scripture
[1:27:23] all of god's elect amen
[1:27:26] who shall lay a charge against god's
[1:27:28] elect
[1:27:31] first timothy
[1:27:33] 4 verse 10 is another verse that's
[1:27:36] can be brought up
[1:27:48] for for therefore we both labor and
[1:27:50] suffer reproach
[1:27:52] because we trust in the living god
[1:27:55] who is the savior of all men
[1:27:59] especially
[1:28:00] of those
[1:28:01] who
[1:28:02] believe amen god's the savior of all men
[1:28:05] amen
[1:28:06] god makes his reign to fall on the just
[1:28:10] and the unjust
[1:28:12] god helps
[1:28:15] all of mankind those that love him those
[1:28:17] that hate him
[1:28:19] and in that sense we can say he's the
[1:28:20] savior of all men
[1:28:22] but then it goes he he wants to point
[1:28:26] out
[1:28:26] something more specific
[1:28:28] especially of those that believe this
[1:28:30] word specially means
[1:28:34] most particularly
[1:28:36] or in the greatest degree so he's the
[1:28:39] savior of all men but in the greatest
[1:28:41] degree
[1:28:42] of those that believe
[1:28:44] so there's two degrees here that paul's
[1:28:47] talking about there's one degree where
[1:28:49] he's the savior of everyone
[1:28:50] does that mean everyone's going to
[1:28:52] heaven
[1:28:53] no
[1:28:55] but he's
[1:28:56] to the greater degree the savior of
[1:28:58] those that believe
[1:29:00] he's the savior of all men
[1:29:02] he makes his reign to shine fall
[1:29:05] on the just and the unjust he pours his
[1:29:07] blessing out out on the just and the
[1:29:09] unjust
[1:29:11] he
[1:29:11] even helps people heals people
[1:29:15] delivers people from terrible
[1:29:17] circumstances that never call on his
[1:29:20] name
[1:29:21] never ask for help never even
[1:29:24] care
[1:29:25] or recognize that god did something for
[1:29:27] them that's our god
[1:29:29] he does good
[1:29:32] to the evil and of the good that's why
[1:29:34] he calls us to do the same thing right
[1:29:36] because he does it
[1:29:40] so musicians if you'd come
[1:29:42] just to bring a conclusion
[1:29:46] i'm gonna turn in the book of ephesians
[1:29:50] chapter one
[1:30:08] verse 4
[1:30:13] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:30:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:18] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:30:20] before him in love
[1:30:24] and then down to verse 11
[1:30:27] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:30:29] inheritance being predestined
[1:30:31] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:30:33] of him
[1:30:34] who works all things after the counsel
[1:30:37] of his own
[1:30:39] will
[1:30:42] this is our sovereign god amen he
[1:30:45] predestinated us again that means that
[1:30:48] he fixed our destiny
[1:30:51] before the foundation of the world he
[1:30:53] said this person is going to be immortal
[1:30:56] and is going to be walking on an eternal
[1:31:00] place an eternal city
[1:31:03] he's destined us to that before the
[1:31:05] foundation of the world and he works it
[1:31:07] according to the council of his own will
[1:31:09] he doesn't work it according to our will
[1:31:12] or all purpose he work our purpose he
[1:31:13] works it according to his purpose then
[1:31:16] he begins this work in us
[1:31:19] he draws us to himself he opens our
[1:31:22] heart
[1:31:24] to hear and receive the word
[1:31:26] he fills us with the holy spirit and
[1:31:28] then he says i've started this work in
[1:31:31] you
[1:31:32] and i'm going to continue this work of
[1:31:34] making you more like jesus christ of
[1:31:37] washing you
[1:31:38] with the water of the word
[1:31:41] and as an identification
[1:31:44] you're going to be walking in
[1:31:45] righteousness holiness love
[1:31:48] and but it's going to be me working in
[1:31:50] you and producing this
[1:31:52] and i've covered all your sins i've
[1:31:54] taken care of all of that and i'm going
[1:31:56] to keep you
[1:31:57] to the very
[1:31:59] end amen
[1:32:01] that that is the work of salvation that
[1:32:04] is election
[1:32:05] all of those processes and the fact is
[1:32:08] you can't make any of it happen in your
[1:32:12] own will
[1:32:14] remember we we started out where we
[1:32:16] talked about
[1:32:17] there's none that seeks after god
[1:32:19] there's none that does good no
[1:32:22] not one
[1:32:23] you're it's god that does the calling
[1:32:27] it's that god that does the filling with
[1:32:29] the spirit you can't fill yourself with
[1:32:32] the spirit of god
[1:32:34] it's god that creates the conditions in
[1:32:37] you that you respond to his call
[1:32:41] and then god continues to work in you
[1:32:44] to will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:32:46] and because of that work in you you have
[1:32:49] a heart that trembles
[1:32:51] at his word
[1:32:53] amen let's pray
[1:32:57] gracious heavenly father we're so
[1:32:59] thankful
[1:33:01] for your word lord
[1:33:05] so many treasures in there so many
[1:33:08] treasures to know

[1:33:20] lord
[1:33:21] what treasures
[1:33:23] and that it's your work in us
[1:33:28] making us more like jesus christ
[1:33:31] making us more of a reflection
[1:33:35] of his love
[1:33:39] lord we just
[1:33:40] we ask that your
[1:33:42] spirit would take these words and write

[1:44:54] in the
[1:44:55] name of jesus christ
[1:44:57] amen
[1:44:58] um i wanted to give an opportunity to
[1:45:01] sister brenda
[1:45:03] to tell her testimony i'll
[1:45:05] bring you the microphone here
[1:45:22] okay
[1:45:23] so this is just a shortened version um
[1:45:26] because there's so many things that the
[1:45:28] lord has done
[1:45:30] in this situation there would be no way
[1:45:32] for me to tell it all at this time but i
[1:45:35] do want to make it known that i thank
[1:45:37] god for all of it because it's all been
[1:45:39] so dear to me
[1:45:42] so back in october of last year um the
[1:45:46] lord delivered a message that went
[1:45:47] straight to my heart while i was in
[1:45:50] church
[1:45:51] and he let me know
[1:45:53] that i was gonna go through something
[1:45:55] but he was with me and i would be okay
[1:45:58] and that the battle is the lord's
[1:46:01] and i found myself sir surrender my will
[1:46:03] and accept the lord's word
[1:46:05] i was experiencing in my heart
[1:46:08] throughout that entire service
[1:46:10] and i made notes later and i shared it
[1:46:12] with my parents
[1:46:13] as a way to encourage them and not to
[1:46:16] fear as the lord had already prepared me
[1:46:18] for this
[1:46:24] i had a choice to make and accept his
[1:46:27] will use his word for my strength and i
[1:46:30] found a faith that rose inside of me
[1:46:32] that left no room for fear
[1:46:35] i just felt myself facing everything
[1:46:37] that was said to me as god's opportunity
[1:46:40] to be god in my life and to show himself
[1:46:43] his word was my faith my strength my
[1:46:46] comfort and as i faced pain and physical
[1:46:49] symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis
[1:46:54] i can't express strong enough that it
[1:46:57] was his word that came to me and spoke
[1:47:00] to my heart that gave me victory
[1:47:02] from the moment i heard it and accepted
[1:47:05] it
[1:47:05] it was an absolute no fear zone for me
[1:47:08] because of his word
[1:47:10] so in january the diagnosis was stage 3
[1:47:13] melanoma cancer and it was explained
[1:47:16] that once it gets into the lymphatic
[1:47:18] system
[1:47:19] and bloodstream in microscopic cells it
[1:47:22] travels throughout the body
[1:47:23] through these symptoms i'm sorry these
[1:47:26] systems
[1:47:27] and it shows up in other parts of the
[1:47:29] body and that melanoma is a very
[1:47:32] aggressive cancer so i became aware of
[1:47:35] something painful
[1:47:37] under my arm in july or august last year
[1:47:40] and i was thinking that i had pulled a
[1:47:42] muscle from where i had been moving
[1:47:45] knowing hindsight that this was an
[1:47:48] aggressive cancer leads me to believe
[1:47:50] that god refused that demon any further
[1:47:53] access
[1:47:54] just my opinion but that is how i feel
[1:47:57] now that the treatment plan was given
[1:47:59] three to four months of a dual
[1:48:02] drug immunotherapy by infusions
[1:48:05] surgery to remove all my lymph nodes
[1:48:07] under the arm
[1:48:09] and other surrounding tissues
[1:48:11] as the tumor was too large to operate at
[1:48:14] that time they would not be able to get
[1:48:16] a clear margin around it
[1:48:18] and then they would do radiation
[1:48:21] and then they would go back to
[1:48:22] immunotherapy
[1:48:24] to finish out treatments for a full year
[1:48:27] so it would be march of 2021
[1:48:30] to continue treating the systems that
[1:48:32] run through my body for protection
[1:48:36] i felt somehow resistant to surgery and
[1:48:38] even though i knew it was god's if that
[1:48:41] was god's will i would surrender my will
[1:48:45] it just never felt that it was going to
[1:48:47] be required i said no and i felt the
[1:48:50] lord back me up
[1:48:52] so i thank the lord for sparing me this
[1:48:55] the first week of march i received the
[1:48:57] first infusion and the first treatment
[1:49:01] literally laid a killing blow
[1:49:04] the treatment boosted my own immune
[1:49:06] system to do exactly what god had
[1:49:08] designed my body to naturally do my
[1:49:10] immune system fought and it killed
[1:49:12] cancer cells
[1:49:14] i literally felt it pulsing and gurgling
[1:49:17] it was aching and i was having a lot of
[1:49:19] pain that whole week
[1:49:21] and then it just suddenly stopped
[1:49:24] on week three i went back for the
[1:49:26] checkup in the examination and they
[1:49:28] couldn't feel the tumor at all it was
[1:49:30] gone
[1:49:32] after three months
[1:49:33] i had the ct scan and it showed that it
[1:49:35] had shrunk drastically
[1:49:37] the doctor said more than
[1:49:40] likely there was no cancer there at that
[1:49:42] time but my lymph nodes were still
[1:49:44] somewhat swollen
[1:49:47] so shortly after that appointment my
[1:49:49] examinations were felt to be all normal
[1:49:51] lymph nodes
[1:49:52] and my doctor kept just repeating almost
[1:49:55] in disbelief this is so wonderful
[1:49:58] i had to wait for the six months to get
[1:50:00] another scan and so here we are at six
[1:50:03] months and per my doctor's words
[1:50:06] i love this
[1:50:08] oh my goodness
[1:50:11] oh her words perfect scan
[1:50:14] no sign of any disease in my body all
[1:50:17] lymph nodes are normal all labs are good
[1:50:20] and i just need to go out and celebrate
[1:50:24] so i say
[1:50:26] yep
[1:50:32] so i say thank you lord jesus for such
[1:50:35] an awesome work of your love your grace
[1:50:38] and your mercy and your healing that you
[1:50:40] bestowed upon me thank you
[1:50:44] lord amen
