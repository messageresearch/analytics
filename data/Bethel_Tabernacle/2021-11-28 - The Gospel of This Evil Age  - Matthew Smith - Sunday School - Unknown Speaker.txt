========================================

quote but there was a part of it that had struck my heart that maybe he and i had mentioned it to him after the fact there's a particular aspect of it that he never covered and then he asked me to do a sunday school about it so when i told him kind of what i uh had saw there so i want to read the quote again and um uh says now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are christians but they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain mark 7 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are christians for what else could they be and is muhammadan that is his religion no matter how he lives lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the qur'an teaches in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind etc in fact in the late ocean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity christian scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel now brother branham uses the phrase social gospel regularly throughout the message uses it a lot and i growing up in the message i heard it a lot and i never had a um i didn't realize that there was a little bit more i always took it as a him just sort of saying that it's a socially acceptable gospel that we're gonna we're gonna modify the gospel um to sort of fit contemporary times and you all pray for me when i have to talk fast i got not a lot of time to get through a lot so um he i always kind of took it like and we kind of see this in modern times um if any of you have heard of a guy by the name of michael o'fallon he's a elder in the southern baptist convention i say elder i know he's an influential figure and he's been involved in a lot of the recent church dealings and he started pushing back really hard because of the major movement to have what you might call a socially progressive evangelical church um uh more colloquially we would say um uh like woke to the the church would be woke um and you're starting to see a lot of this um and i'm gonna just go through some of the different things um that the things that i've seen and stuff that um mr o'fallon kind of detailed and some of the stuff that he was doing really kind of helps documenting that kind of stuff but um just different things like i've seen stuff just on various social media platforms um one thing that absolutely horrified me was this kind of i used the largest air quotes possible but pastor who was telling people i mean just absolutely blasphemous doctrine about um i mean he outright said that there's you know multiple ways to to cr to to god ex outside of christ talking about let me just total acceptance of of sort of the trans agenda the gay rights agenda the whole the whole thing right um there's just a couple other things that um mr o'fallon was talking about that i had seen um some of you might have heard of something called resolution nine this was um put through the southern baptist convention um and um the in essence it's a little bit longer than what i can actually read but the long and short of it was that the southern baptist convention which is the largest protestant denomination in the world um has now officially accepted critical race theory as a an official lens through which to view the scripture now i don't know how educated everyone is on a critical race theory but put simply it's about as anti-new testament doctrine as you're gonna get um for the southern baptist convention to make that an official stance is i mean they they might as well declare themselves antichrist which a prophet already did but we won't go there um so you also have um so you had that also within um oh yeah you also had uh the gospel coalition um it's a large interdenominational organization uh put out an eight-part series on how the gospel uh how to view the gospel through the lens of um uh daredevil and foucault these are post-modernist philosophers anyone who's ever heard a single jordan peterson lecture is going to know what that is about um let's just say it's not good um it basically you're you strip any authority out of the scripture if you're viewing the scripture through that lens um you also have the uh presbyterian church um is dealing with critical gender theory um and you're just seeing this massive explosion of like i said what we would call sort of woke ideology within the church being accepted as doctrine um exactly what uh brother branham said here um in the italian church age in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity christian scientists have done this already as well multitude through social gospel and also in mark 7 where it says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching the doctrines and commandments of men they're worshiping god claiming to while teaching foucault and dereda i mean it's it's complete it's a complete abomination and now you you've got to ask the question why are these churches that have been around for in some cases hundreds of years or well over 100 years anyways why are they suddenly shifting to this and it's because as the elder generation dies off um you're getting newer generations of church leadership who have all been educated in this stuff they've all went to college they've all been educated in this um you had um uh the f uh is the 45th moderator of the general assembly of the presbyterian church effectively he's the president of the presbyterian church openly say i am a critical race this is one of the big addresses to the whole sort of church leadership said i'm a critical race theorist and i believe that you can be a christian and a critical race theorist at the same time i personally disagree and i think paul would as well but i mean i mean a huge part of paul's ministry was um was smashing the divisions between jew and gentile and that there would be a roman church and a hebrew church and a greek church and that these would all be sort of racially segregated and sort of and and and not have some sort of um uh that they they wouldn't come together as a as a unified church under christ um and this is this is exactly what you'll get if you try to merge critical race theory and and scripture um uh anyways um i'm gonna skip over some of this um anyway so they're losing membership because what you're having is you're having the older generations die off they were you know regular members of all these churches and then they die and their kids went to college and became social activists and didn't come back and so you're getting church leadership going well we can't we can't properly you know spread the gospel to all these various communities because we're not packaging the gospel in social activism we can't we can't reach out to the younger generations because all they want to do they want to do their social activism work right they're they're more interested in in say gender theory or you know you know transgender rights than they are in anything that we have to offer so we have to repackage the gospel into that to get them to come to church um and one of the so i i saw an interview with a he's actually an atheist but he was talking with like i said uh mr o'fallon who's a member of the church and he's talking to this atheist because this atheist had already seen this exact same movement through the universities and how it just degenerated completely cored him out and he asked him well what do you think about this and he says well i think if i was back in the day when i was a really militant atheist i would be jumping for joy he said because i believed then that if you wanted to destroy the church you would start making woke preachers and sending them into the church because it will just eat itself from the inside and um so he's like you have a you have a big pretty wooden horse outside your gates is what you have and if you let it in it's going to kill you from the inside um now we're all pretty aware of this we all are aware of uh anyone who's been following culture the news or anything pretty aware of how this stuff works um or if not uh really in depth at least on the surface level but i want to go back to that quote where brother branham said in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity christian scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel now i was unaware until a couple months ago and i kind of forgot the brother brandon uses terminology and then i heard something else from a political commentator and then brother jason preaches the sermon where he reads that quote and it's like this light bulb goes off every we kind of sort of take this phrase the social gospel as just sort of like i said sort of like a socially acceptable new gospel but that actually referred to something specific there was actually a movement that started in the late 1800s i want to say about 1870 and ran up until the 1930s 1940s called the social gospel movement and um i just so one of the main thinkers in it was walter rosenbosch who in 1917 wrote what is considered the bible of the social gospels a book called um a theology for the social gospel and it the social gospel movement had such a massive widespread impact on american culture and politics that um it actually got a president elected uh woodrow wilson was a adherent to the social gospel and actually they were able to pass the 18th amendment that the 18th amendment which we would more refer to as the prohibition amendment amendment was the work of social gospel politicians um and so i want to read you some some excerpts from the theology of the social gospel because when you read this you suddenly realize that this whole woke thing ain't new it's old it's the same spirit repackaged on a different coat of paint the brother random say that uh god takes his man but leaves the spirit and the devil takes his man and leaves the spirit same thing um so this is this is just a couple excerpts from right beginning the book um and like i said this is uh rosenbosch in the theology of the social gospel if theology stops growing or is unable to adjust itself to its modern environment and meet its present tasks it will die many now regarded as dead the social gospel needs a theology to make it effective but theology needs the social gospel to vitalize it so this is a man who's claiming to be a christian who ostensibly believes in the eternal word of god but need thinks that the word of god needs a social movement to vitalize it that's interesting the argument of this book is built on the conviction that the social gospel is a permanent addition to our spiritual outlook and that its arrival constitutes a stage in the development of the christian religion we need not waste words to prove that the social gospel is being preached it is no longer a prophetic and occasional note it is a novelty only in backwards social or religious communities right only only those holy rollers believe in anything other than this um right you know only those those weirdo cultists believe in anything other than this new socially progressive gospel is that clock broken it hasn't moved in a while it's cortisol okay um the social gospel has become orthodox it is not only preached it has set new problems for local church work and has turned the pastoral organizing work of the ministry into new and constructive directions really well i thought the pastoral work and the church organization should be saving centers why is it in new directions now why what what new directions are we going in that that is you know you see you see what i'm saying um the church has always had or at least ostensibly has always had a focus on saving sinners and and promoting the the work of christ why are we changing it into new directions this is clearly not a christian movement this is something other than that it's paint got a coat of paint as a christian movement but it is not christian huh it has imparted a wider vision and a more statesmanlike grasp to the foreign mission enterprise the religious literature uttering the social gospel is notable both for its volume and its vitality and conviction the emotional fervor of the new convictions has created prayers and hymns of social aspiration prayers and hymns of social aspiration prayers not of worship not of praising god not of communing with the lord your savior but social aspiration and hymns were singing the praises of what exactly uh let's see um lost my place um so okay um uh for which newer handbooks are making room conservative denominations have formally committed themselves to the fundamental ideas of the social gospel and their practical application the plans of great interdenominational organizations are inspired by it it has become a constructive force in american politics not american religion or society or culture but politics this new orientation which is observable in all parts of our religious life is not simply a prudent adjustment of church methods to change conditions there is religious compulsion behind it those who are in touch with a student population know that the impulse to social service means to college men and women it is the most religious element in the life of many of them man you thought that was wrote in 2020 not 1920 among ministerial students there is an almost impatient demand for a proper social outlet some hesitate to enter the regular ministry at all because they doubt whether it will offer them sufficient opportunity and freedom to utter and apply their social convictions for many ministers who have come under the influence of the social gospel in mature years it has signified a religious crisis and where it has been met successfully it has brought fresh joy and power and a distinct enlargement of the mind it has taken the place of conventional religion and the lives of many outside the church we i mean this is this is obvious anybody who's seen some of the stuff that's happened knows that the people who are acting the way that they are they see this is they don't have god in their lives but they have to worship something so they're worshiping their social activism and this is the reason they act like like zealots effect essentially i mean they they they will happily kill people in the name of their social activism so um yeah it's the most religious thing that a lot of people have right now and this is the core of the whole thing in case any of you had not quite figured it out yet as to what is the motivating force behind the social gospel he says it right here it constitutes the moral power and the propaganda of socialism this is explicitly a marxist ideology where they tried to package marxism in a in a christian robe because and think about what he says it's the moral power and the propaganda of socialism socialism is a political move social gospel is a moral position the gospel is moral it's not political gospel has never been about politics right jesus said give unto caesar what is caesar god unto gods separate your politics and your religion they're not the same thing and we and but what they're trying to do is merge the two because it gives their their frankly evil uh political ideology a moral core that they can that they can use to to dupe people into buying in and he goes on i i don't was that the time okay all right um i'm going to uh skip over some of this um but in effect he goes on to just talk about how um well i'll just read one little excerpt whoever wants to hold audiences of working people must establish some connection between religion and their social feelings and experiences this they packaged it then as well the church is dying and we have to change the gospel to meet some new political agenda to entice people into our churches because the church membership is dying and we're not going to appeal to those younger generations it's the same thing that they're doing now it's it is a political move disguised as a religious one the fact of the matter is um and i just want to go back to that quote um how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men we now have the churches shifting from what we read in acts 2 to repent be baptized and be filled with the holy spirit to repent be baptized do your social activism work and then be filled with the baptizement of the holy spirit right there there i mean in the um southern baptist church they literally had a um it was a it was a talk where they were teaching the the leadership about how they need to start including um like uh critical race theory activism as a sort of inclusion within sort of like i said that that gospel teaching that it's not just sinner saved sinners saved by grace it's sinners saved by grace and woke ideology it's it's it's the gospel plus right like i think brother jason mentioned that one time when he was preaching and i think that and i think we could all agree that this is uh well because uh when he says um in the latest churches they'll call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving themselves the right to deny his deity they'd have to deny his deity because if they accepted his deity there would be they would they would be ashamed to try to do this to try to package politics into the gospel to use the gospel as a political tool the gospel's never been about politics it's about saving sinners because it's about people who need help and and uh i was actually thinking about this um before i came out and when i was getting ready for church how i thought it was very fitting that jesus would come to earth as the son of a carpenter and work in a carpenter shop because he would he's the god of creation so he would create as a carpenter he would build things from nothing but he would also spend his life fixing broken things and the world is a we have a world full of broken people that need christ and that's what the good news was for that you could repent be baptized and fill with the holy spirit and have a life that wasn't yours and to to the reason at the end of the day the reason why you do not package politics into your gospel is because you dilute the gospel you you dilute the gospel and you make you give your politics unearned morality that it doesn't have you you take something evil i mean i would just like to point out that this this in case anybody was unaware though i mean if we want to put put you know rank the ideologies of evil socialism killed far more people than nazism ever did right so why are we why what kind of demonic spirit would attach that to the gospel it's it it cores out anything rips the morality out of the gospel strips away any ability to help people and tells them that what they need is to vote you don't need to vote you need god right like god is the only planet and by the way i just want to make another comment about um one thing that i didn't get to with the social gospel they explicitly said that the aim of the social gospel was to bring the kingdom of god to earth through social activism that by changing the politics because they could legislate morality and make everyone on earth a christian through force of law that's why that's why they passed the prohibition movement by the way the prohibition amendment it was we would all agree we don't think you know drinking is is morally acceptable we don't believe in that but if you enact it by the force of of a gun that's not a christian act at all right that should be a voluntary act done between you and god not because the state told you to if that if the only reason why you're not drinking is the state told you to then sad to say but you haven't repented at all right and the end result of that like i said they removed the deity of god they removed they removed they removed behaving in a moral way from doing it because you you loved god and had a relationship with god and attached it to a political motive and the end result of that was so unpopular that a few years later they had to repeal the amendment it got literally millions of people killed because of the the cartels and the the mafia that popped up out of that amendment it it was a complete disaster it didn't work it didn't stop anyone from drinking it was a complete failure why because it was man trying to crowbar god's plan onto people whether they liked it or not and that's never going to work the only way to to a new life to to walk away from the things of the world is to have a personal relationship with god that is it you're not going to achieve utopia by by voting it's not going to work the political system is corrupt it's all going to break down and and it's it's pointless to try to do this anytime you try to push christian virtue through politics it won't work and um i think i'm out of time and i think that's a good place to stop so uh thank you all for listening and um uh i guess we'll stand and pray lord we thank you for this word you've given us this morning ask that you blessed and anoint the people that they would be able to get something out of it and i know that i might not be able to help anyone with
