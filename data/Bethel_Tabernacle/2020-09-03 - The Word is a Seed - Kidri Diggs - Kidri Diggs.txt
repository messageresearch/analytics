send in your prayer requests brother jason is streaming so feel free to send them to him and he'll get them on to me for the end of the service um there's uh as brother diggs is getting to come out there's just a quote that was on my heart that i just wanted to read as he's coming brother branham says this is god's provided way for this for this day we're expecting to see him move among us showing his presence giving people faith inspiring them to believe that's our purpose of being here we know we can trust him we won't we we'd be disappointed amen so ultimately where is your faith is it in brother diggs or whoever's preaching no it's not god is sovereign over every mouth that speaks here and if you put your faith and confidence in him if you have a need you just hold it in your heart say god i have a need i need wisdom i need direction i i need you to just point me in the right direction to correct me whatever it might be to give me peace i'm here speak it through the lips that are coming and your faith isn't in the man we we love him we appreciate him but ultimately if if you're going to get your need met it's not going to be by our brother it's going to be by him and so i just want to pray and then we'll turn it over to him heavenly father we're just so thankful for each one here tonight streaming watching the recording we ask that your spirit would abide with them even now be give them rest give them peace lord meet their needs may their faith make contact with you and that through that faith your great presence amongst us in this day would be manifested

with all our heart we certainly you know if we just look at our lives and see it we will be nothing without god so he's our all in all he's our help he's our keep he's our future he's our past he's our present amen so everything we have need of is in him let's just bow and we'll read the word of scripture and we'll get right into the service tonight by the grace of god let's pray let's remember those i believe brother jason brother mad of traveling so let's just remember them in prayer amen the different ones that are in need let's pray lord jesus father here we are again lord and the lord you told us to pray without ceasing lord so lord and in many cases lord we prayed once but that doesn't mean to stop lord and lord that you put something in us a perseverance within us lord to pray

pray to bless those lord who are traveling lord brother matt but the jason lord and prevention some other family members lord we just know that you you you god and you order our footsteps lord and we just pray father god that you just be god to us tonight in the service lord lord take it beyond just the voice of a man or what a man can put together but lord we pray that your spirit comes off the pages lord lord and it connects with your people lord that we'll know when we leave this place that god spoke with us that we had fellowship lord just testifying lord that when the prophet said all that was in adam was restored in christ lord god so we believe those promises lord and we just want to see them manifested in our lives lord and lord jesus you forgive us for our sins lord and anything lord that's not like you we pray you remove it from the service in the name of jesus christ the church say amen amen praise the lord again we certainly uh appreciate brother jason his absence amen let's just if you have your bible let's go to um matthew the seventh chapter matthew seven praise the lord thank god for good old toasty south carolina i was just telling brother jason that i mean yeah bro jason that um you know me and somebody was talking earlier today and and uh they were saying that they didn't know if they wanted to remain in south carolina and i was like why would you we got the best weather in the world we got nice hot summers and we got nice short mild winters so a perfect recipe for living amen you know so hey man i'm glad that god chose me to be here and get too many amens on that one some of y'all want to move hey man that's all right matthew chapter 7 amen let's start reading that verse um 17. matthew chapter 7 verse 17. he said even so every good tree pay attention to this for me please it says even so every good tree bring it forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth forth good fruit is hewn down bringing forth not good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them amen let's backtrack let's go to ecclesiastics chapter seven and we're just going to read a verse out of here ecclesiastes 7 and let's read uh verse 8. the bible says better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit amen the lord of blessing reading of his word you can have your sees tonight thanks bro amen amen by the by the grace of god i want to use for a subject the word is a seed amen you know and that's kind of what i want to deal with tonight is the seed you know and um you know there's a parable where jesus talked about the different kinds of ground and he said that a soil went to sow and you know and as he sold some fell on good ground some fell on stony ground some failed by the wayside and so forth but then he came back in the parable he said you know this is what the soil was sowing the seed was the word hallelujah and he said that you know notice that there was nothing wrong with the seed the problem was the ground that it fell upon so i want to say that in in saying that church that you know whatever seed is in you is gonna only bring forth that life hallelujah you can't be good if evil is in you and you can be evil if good is in you hallelujah your tree can only bring forth what's inside of you hallelujah you know that's the bible and then he said you know in the book of genesis he said that you know god created the heavens and the earth and all these things and y'all know i'm paraphrasing you know and he said uh whose seed is in itself hallelujah you know so that that seed being inside that that tree or that branch or that animal or whatever god created that that life hallelujah is going to come from within that seed who's in itself hallelujah whatever that tree is whatever that animal is nothing can be added to it the life is already in the seed hallelujah so church let's just think about it if we call ourselves the children of god hallelujah if we are the seed of god the life of god what should we bring forth we should bring forth christ's very own life hallelujah we should bring forth the life of the seed hallelujah and he says the word is a seed amen so i want you to catch this tonight church you know that's why it's so important for god to come in our day and restore the word hallelujah restore everything that was lost because what he did was he was restoring original seed hallelujah he is restoring everything that he is hallelujah see the baptist only had a portion of the life but it couldn't bring forth a full mature tree hallelujah and so forth to all the other churches you know the anglo-saxon the the pentecostal the catholics or whatever you want to call it none of them could bring forth the fullness of that tree hallelujah although they had a portion of it church in our day hallelujah we should be seeing the full manifestation of the seed in our life hallelujah but i i i i want to illustrate something to you tonight by the grace of god you know as we talk about the seed we deal with a seed what i have in my hand tonight is a what talk to me i have a seed in my hand hallelujah now how many of you looking at this can tell what kind of seed it is see i see we got some sharp people out here brother said a pc i heard but jason said it's a pc and they are correct but they're identifying the seed by their own experience hallelujah obviously somewhere sometime in a life they've eaten a peach hallelujah and if you eat a peach it'll only come back down to what's inside of it hallelujah a peach seed holy but you know we look at the seed how do we get the life out of the seed first things first the seed has to be now we're thinking about life amen now we have a seed inside of us amen and we know that natural types are spiritual so how does god get life out of you oh my hooray think about it church think about the steps think about the stages that a seed goes through to bring forth life so i asked you the question tonight what's the first thing god does to get life out of you hallelujah if i wanted life out of this pc what was the first thing i got to do i got to bury it so you mean to tell me in order for god to get anything out of me he has to bury me harley but what i want you to understand you're not just buried you're placed in dirty dark filthy conditions hallelujah now remember that's the only way you can get life out of the seed is to put it in some dirt go away to god we ought to rejoice because your trial hallelujah your tribulation hallelujah your sickness your pain your heartache we consider all those things to be dirt but that's god bringing forth life hallelujah somebody rejoice with me hallelujah church i want you to look at your stages a little bit different tonight hallelujah because the only way hallelujah i can get hurry up peaches is for me first to plant the seed in a nasty condition [Music] amen you know if i go out here and i look at the ocean i don't know what ocean we got here on the east coast what is it atlantic hey man i i wasn't too good with all that stuff at school all i knew it was with water holly but you know what if i take the seed and i throw it in the atlantic hallelujah there's no guarantee that it'll come forth huh it got water hallelujah but it needs more than water holly it needs some dirt all right you say brother jesus we're in the message there's a good anointing no good without dirt hallelujah you need a filthy condition holy a dark condition oh yeah so let me say this tonight church hallelujah you look at your situation you look at your trial your sickness of what you're going through god planted you in some dirt to bring forth life so let me say this to you tonight our dirt is good dirt all right it has to be good dirt in order for life to come forth but it's still dirt the dirt is no good only to smother the seed and for those of you who are farmers and got gardens and everything i challenge you go home take your seeds and just lay em on the car porch pour water on it let the sun put in a good place where you know the sun hits it all the time and just watch it and watch it and watch it i guarantee you nothing will come forth holy it'll even dry out but no life will come forth holy but in dirt hallelujah just see it and dry out and it'll begin to breathe forth life hallelujah in dirt it'll begin to go to its own metamorphosis they call it a photosynthesis amen i believe that's when light begins to hit the seed hallelujah and that's what happens to us church god allows us for the first stages in our life and we may not even understand why we go through certain things let me tell you god's trying to get the life out of the seed hallelujah and the only way you can get it hallelujah is the first thing for it to be planted in dirt harley in order for us to reap the benefit of the life of the seed the seed has to be put in the conditions where it doesn't even look like it'll be able to come forth and you know hallelujah there's good dirt and there's bad dirt honey but notice i want to say if you bring forth anything that your dirt is good dirt you say homeboy dicks i got this habit i got that habit good dirt if you're still in church good dirt hallelujah you said i'll bring dicks i told a lion i got caught if you're still in church good dirt hallelujah you say oh i got this problem and i watched this or i heard that if you're still in church good dirt you say oh bro dicks i gotta do sickness i got that sickness if you're still in church good dirt hallelujah oh yeah you need some dirt to come forth and you know sometimes hallelujah we don't even pray like we ought to till we feel like we in dirt you know what you say sometimes we like to have dirt on one another oh let me tell you about the dirt and they lie that's all right talk about my dirt because all my dirt doing is making me a better person hallelujah all my dirt doing is bringing forth a greater manifestation of the life of the city now let's dig into it a little bit deeper holiday i ain't gonna be long y'all know i'm about to close but look church holly you bury it and you place it in dirt hallelujah and you know it seems so it's insignificant because when we go home when we walk out of here most of us are going to walk on what dirt holy we walk on dirt almost every day of our life but do you even realize that you're walking on life it's so common to us that we don't even realize that we're walking on life that's already planted beneath us hallelujah amen and as you walk hallelujah you walk on different dirt different things in your life you're walking hallelujah on your growing process hallelujah the prophet of god even gave an illustration that you can take this seed and play concrete over it i know some people just uh got a piece of their yard paved you watch after luau the area that they got paved all around the grass gonna start to grow you know why because that's where grass used to be and let me tell you this church holy god has always been there with the believer in their dark trial god has always been with the believer in their dirt hallelujah was he there with abraham in his life was he there with rahab and her prostitution god was always there in the midst of the dirt he was there with the whoremongers he was there with the drunkards he was there with the liars and the cheaters god loves good dirt amen we ought to rejoice notice i'm not talking about sin i'm talking about the stages of growth holy see cuz because as that seed begins to grow what does it do it pushes out of the dirt so don't worry about your young people hallelujah don't worry about your children hallelujah look at they dirty and say that's good dirt because we got to realize that hallelujah we all came through some dirt holly i just did some of the same things that my children do and hallelujah so you know what it don't bother me because if god cleaned me up out of the dirt he can clean him up out of the dirt hurry up if he can wash the wash me he can wash them hardly because you know what you say why you say that because it's the same seed i'm not saying my children of the devil know they got the same seed i got so their dirt is good dirt we're gonna go to pentecost right now somebody say dirt somebody say good dirt somebody say i got good dirt see me personally i love to snatch the enemy's power away because what he tries to do is make us feel bad by our mistakes he tries to make us feel bad about our dark places earlier you know priya future somebody could be going through depression right now holly but that depression in the form of good dirt is only to show you that god can lift you out of it hallelujah you might say well brother jesus i got i'm seeking i got this problem in that problem that's good dirt hallelujah because god uses that sickness to show he's a healer so you ought to rejoice right now no matter how you feel hallelujah life is coming forth holy god needs that dirt to bring forth life oh i feel my helper coming on hallelujah let me tell you something rejoicing is in your seed it's a part of the life hallelujah you can't get here you can't get god without praise you can't get god without worship hallelujah it's a part of the seed hallelujah you say well brother jesus that ain't in me and i'll tell you that you don't have the seed of god in you [Music] because god loves worship first thing he did was he created angels to do what to worship him hardly if you go a little deeper and job when asked job said job where were you hallelujah when when the sons of god shout in the morning started saying and we had a prophet come forth and tell us that we were in the mind of god hollywood amen what were we doing in the mind of god we were singing and worshiping wow so don't get mad remember i told you last time there was a rumor remember that rumor that scripture proves it wrong because that scripture says that we all were in the mind of god with the morning stars and the sons of god singing and shouting for joy so why is it so hard to do on this side because we get our own personalities in the way we don't want personality we want life that's what we want we want life hallelujah remember earlier the end of a thing is better than the beginning of a thing so you look at this right now this is no good hallelujah i can't eat this and be satisfied how many of y'all walk around eating seeds we're gonna pray for you brother because that's unnatural just to achieve honey what we're supposed to do is eat the fruit of the seed and you look at the church i'm running let me back up let me back up hallelujah let me back up whoa hallelujah i love a church that pulls hollywood and you know let's back up a little bit i want how you want the young people to be able to get this first things first first stage the seed is buried honestly it's put in a dark condition hallelujah and it can't get out the only way it can get out is to grow oh hallelujah i feel like i got my shout out now going tonight hallelujah hey the only way hallelujah that this seed can get out of darkness is to grow hardly so if you get healed that's a growing process if you come out of depression that's a growing process if you believe god for a certain substance or circumstance that is a growing process hallelujah when you overcome hurt and pain and loneliness and all these things what is it it's a growing process so if you ever get back in those conditions again you'll understand that it's a process and you won't be discouraged hardly first things first is it's in a dark dismal condition and and the only way hollywood but let's look at this condition a little bit more holly little condition of the seed church the seed is planted in dirt and that dirt it compacts it smothers the seed oh no water no sunlight it's smothered by dirt honey but that's what it needs that's the only way hallelujah that the processes within the genetic substance of the seed can come forth it's for it to feel like hallelujah is closed in i'm finna say something powerful right now i want you to catch it that seed has to feel like it has no choice think about it that seed in the ground surrounded by dirt smothered and compacted by dirt what choice does it has the only thing you can do is die hallelujah hallelujah and sometimes god will let us get in conditions when we're smothered hallelujah and we feel like we have no choice what does that do that causes us to doubt our ways and rely on god we say lord help me and the only thing we can do is die and right i know i ain't the only one y'all just good at holding y'alls and when you get home and you begin to recite what was said and you got your portion you're gonna be in the mirror like i know i know us i know what you do hallelujah you gonna be in the mirror trying to imitate me why because that happiness you feel is a part of the seed hallelujah it ain't something strange that's a part of the life hallelujah but church you look it's compacted it's smothered by dirt it only has one choice and that is to die but dying is good hallelujah because once that seed hallelujah in the ground smothered by dirt dark conditions heavy trials sickness heartache pain what happens the shell begins to pull back what is god trying to do he's trying to get rid of your flesh he's trying to get rid of the out with you so that the real end with you could come out hallelujah hallelujah so he'll put us in conditions as a seed that we have no choice but to die to our thoughts die to our desires die to our ways why so real original life can come forward hallelujah and then as that original life comes forth the sea the shell breaks open and the real dramatized sea inside church what we're seeing right now this right here is not the seed this is the shell hallelujah the life is on the inside but it takes a different condition to bring it forth you have to be more than just a church member hallelujah but you have to be in a place holy when you die right to your own thoughts your own desires and that shell begins to break back cuddling when the shell begins to break off you know that's a type of that's a type of you coming into the holy ghost because it's no longer you that liveth but it's christ inside that liveth in you hallelujah glory hallelujah listen let me read you something right quick this is the prophet of god saying you notice we started out and we were saying that the word is a seed church i want you to understand what you're hearing right now is a seed holy and what i'm doing by the grace of god i'm preaching the word but what i'm preaching is supposed to be planted on your ground hallelujah notice what i'm saying by the grace of god if i'm anointed and preaching by the holy spirit what i'm saying is truth so it has to bring forth the life behind it and if you receive it hallelujah you didn't take it hallelujah you succumbed what's being preached you will become the very thing that you're eating oh yeah so church when we think about the word or the message of the hour you know the prophet of god would say i got thus said the lord can i get a man he would say that all the time i got thus saying the lord i believe that this is thus saith the lord now how many of us believe that the prophet had thus had the lord and we have eaten the book so you and i have thus said the lord hallelujah we have the very same word life because it ain't a different seed it can only bring forth the same thing amen listen again to get to this i had to eat the fruit so for us to get to the manifestation that we've seen in a prophetic ministry we have to eat the fruit oh yeah we have to eat the word hallelujah we have to eat this message we have to eat the bible we have to eat jesus christ holy that's the only way you're going to see the life within hallelujah if you don't get to that place all you got is shell and i'll tell you right now if anybody want a piece of this is a little piece broke off you wanna eat this i bet you nine times out of ten my brother eat seeds you won't taste i guarantee you that the fruit of this tastes way better than just the shell of this anything you plant earlier you're not trying to get the shell you want the fruit so what is god trying to get from us why did he give us a message with us says the lord he's trying to get the fruits of himself he's trying to get that word that of like oh my church look at it look at it good now if i plant this and it comes up and it produces fruit hallelujah and i get the fruit and it comes back to this what did i get when i get the fruit i get original seeds that's why i'm kind of leery of eating fruit with no seed [Music] some of us will be eating no seed hybrid thank god for my brother he he graced with seeds amen phil pray hallelujah [Music] you're a special breed holiday but you know church hallelujah if if if you eat fruit and you get back to the seed you get original so when you're eating honey watermelon or or or grapes or or apples or whatever you eat and there's no seed that means it's not original oh now what y'all gonna do y'all go home and eat your fruit and look at it let's see if he got a seed you better you better examine what you eating to see if he got life inside of it because if it don't have life inside of it it won't digest the same whoa not only it won't digest the same it doesn't have the same nourishment in it why because there's no life inside hallelujah there's no life inside of it because there's no seed now i ain't gonna say that i won't eat a watermelon without no seed cause sometimes they sweeter sometimes they're bigger but you know it just helps my conscience a little bit more when i can scrape them seeds off it just helps my conscience a little bit more when i can pluck them seeds out them grapes that need it just can you imagine eating a peach and never get down to the seed do you realize if you eat something like that you're eating science that's what you're eating you're eating scientific genetics but when we can eat fruit and we can come back to this we're eating the book of genesis eating original life original seed hallelujah original substance what did he say he said those are my children my sheep who know my voice he said i give unto him eternal life what is he giving us that word eternal means zoe he's giving us god's own very life so when we eat this word when we eat this unveiled holy just this bread that god has unveiled to us hallelujah in this end time what are we eating we're eating god's very own life so we eat god's very own life we become what we're eating and we begin to manifest god's very own life but what i love about that is i started out in dirt i started out looking like nothing i started out looking crazy i started out looking like i'd never be a benefit honey but god planned it that way holy because the end of a thing is better than the beginning of a thing let me finish hallelujah somebody say good dirt and i know i know some of y'all kids gonna try to use that against your parents all right mama remember brother say i'm good dirt i know i'm being disobedient but this disobedience is good dirt i ain't talking about like that i'm talking about when you're living and you've dedicated yourself to god and you may make mistakes in your growth processing you may do certain things that hollywood you don't want to do amen then you're good dirt because remember he said a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit hallelujah and a bad tree cannot bring forth good food hallelujah so if you are a child of god hallelujah when you go through things is for your good he did all things work together for good to those who love god are called to conscious purpose all right oh my holy luke glory listen he says every word of god is a seed and every seed sown correctly in the right kind of ground we're brief of just exactly what it's supposed to oh hello this word falling on the right ground can only bring forth this word he won't bring forth a portion he won't breathe for well you know i love god but i don't understand why i got to pay tithe no we won't do that well i love god but i just you know i have a problem with authority no it won't do that say yeah i love god but you know what i was talking to a friend of mine and he was telling me that in this pandemic hallelujah that they he he ready to go back to church and they had a vote to go back to church and the people said no we were going to stay home and stream lord have mercy what is it coming to you does the people rather sit home listen to this people rather sit home in the comfort of the house [Music] eating potato chips popcorn drinking kool-aid then to come to church and listen to the word of god you see the parallel people want to do what makes their shell comfortable remember it's not this pandemic is not about your shell it's about life coming out of you hallelujah all right thank the lord for covering 19 because what is it doing is showing who really loves god and people find all kind of reasons not to come to church just remember there's a prophecy in the last days hallelujah that summer's going to fall away hallelujah there's a prophecy that children will be disobedient hardly there's a prophecy that means it'll be mean to be lovers of them own sales hallelujah there's a prophecy hollywood the bible says i believe it's in timothy hollywood to talk about they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof ever learning they know what you know they know what the prophet's saying they're ever learning but they'll never come to a surrender amen and they even fight you with the calls so they can stay home oh lord don't get mad at me i don't go here you have to see me hallelujah hooray i guarantee you it won't work because you know what i'm equipped i'm built a certain way well i'll say things brother jason want to say i'll tell you straighten up get back in line soldier hallelujah i'll tell you hollywood that there's a demon anointing you to keep you to stay home hallelujah bro jason be like well god bless you brother whenever you're led but he sees the same thing it's the same it's the same seed it's just a different anointing listen by the grace of god he says corn forth corn can i get amen wheat will bring forth wheat can i get amen and every divine promise of god will bring forth what it promised can i get amen now i want you to think about a divine promise that you're believing god to fulfill hallelujah and if you believe that promise holier in seed form you should also get the manifestation of what you believe hallelujah all right if god is a healer holy and i believe that god is obligated to show me the manifestation [Applause] amen the prophet of god said if you're believing the word a certain way he said god is and it's the true way according to his promise he said god is guilty until he fulfills that in your life like you believe it i'm talking about truth now if you believe god is a healer and you are sick the power of god said god is guilty until he heals you he said the scriptures are guilty until they're manifest in your life if you believe them like they are amen he said the word is a seed but the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of ground no matter how much seed you got if you're afraid to sow it there's no good yeah church look now we take the seed hallelujah the stages hallelujah as this seed begin to grow i'm winding down now i hope y'all ain't waiting on the punch line cause i don't have none i hope you ain't waiting on a special coat where you wow man let me write that one down i never heard that before don't work that way with me you pull i preach you quit i stop you resist i sniff hallelujah because then there's something hallelujah stopping the flow of water from hitting your plant because cause mothers and sisters you know and maybe some of you brothers who who have cultivated land you can take a plant hallelujah that's growing fine it's in a good spot and it's growing and you move it and it starts to die hallelujah church let me tell you if you didn't stop growing you need to go back to that position hallelujah get back in that place where you were growing hallelujah get back in that spot holy where the sun is touching you where water is doing what it's supposed to do so you can grow it's unnatural for a seed not to bring full of life it's unnatural for a seed not to bring forth what's inside of it and if you are not bringing forth oh yeah the word of this hour her the restored scriptures of our day that means somewhere you've gotten out of position but you look at this and you take it all right let's look at it now are you with me where where do we stop the sea was breaking away because it was in so much darkness right y'all with me it was breaking away because it was just so much dirt but you know the shell it falls on this side falls on that side and it makes room for the real life to come out and it's that real life that pushes out of the dirt remember he said i give you a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit in you see it's his spirit that pushes us out of those conditions hallelujah we can't do nothing without the holy ghost hallelujah you think i'll say oh i can go here i'm all right i can do this i can listen to that i'm all right you can't do it with your spirit your spirit is still shale hallelujah your spirit is no good it has to fall away hallelujah and god will put his spirit inside of you honey and that is what gives you power to come out of the dirt hut and as that seed begins to grow what's causing it to grow sunlight and water let me say something real clear hey man i want to encourage you tonight hello if the seed here ever breaks out of the shell nothing can stop it from coming forth wow use as soon as you give your life to god you go through a hard trial nothing can stop it from coming forth once it touches water nothing can stop it from coming forth listen church when it comes to growing in god there is no reversal process if he ever circumcises you he can never find what he cut off it's not over here in some kind of holding block for you to mess up and then god said okay i uncircumcise you now no once the process starts there's nothing that can reverse it and you know i give you a natural type how many of you sisters when your water broke nothing could stop it nothing could stop that baby from coming forth doctors say well your husband here yet so let's try to hold the baby let's try to wait you like no the baby coming in all the pain and all the agony nothing could stop that life from coming forth hallelujah hooray nothing could stop that abigail nothing could stop that micah from coming forth no matter how hard mama was trying because daddy wasn't there nope didn't matter if daddy wasn't there hallelujah that life was coming forth right doctor give you a shot try to stimulate it a little bit harder try to slow it up the devil try to slow it up sometimes but can't stop it it's coming hallelujah and you know what they do they say prepare for delivery oh hallelujah great church even when things go wrong hallelujah one of my kids hallelujah the uh um um i think it was kiara yeah she she um she used the bathroom in the process of birth so a heart rate speeded up so we could no longer have a natural birth hallelujah and sometimes if the birth can't just be as natural as opposed to god got something else for you he got to cut you open and snatch you out he'll do it but you're gonna come forward hallelujah all right that system might feel like well i don't feel like pushing okay let's go into the emergency c-section but that baby gonna come forward hallelujah you might say well i got time and i don't feel like serving god trust me hillary the natural labor of hallelujah goes on the pains and everything goes away much faster than a c-section if you ain't got to go through a c-section praise god so church why go through all these things when all we have to do is just let god bring forth life hallelujah now the shell pulls back and life starts to push out of the dirt it's connecting with water and sunlight water and sunlight then when it gets his head above ground it ain't finished right holly it still hasn't brought forth life yet hallelujah when that tree holler when this peach seed hallelujah comes out of the ground and it's this high it still ain't no good to me because i can't just go i know you see but i hope you eat tree too man cause tree ain't no good friend of mine i was in canada one time we was we went to an indian restaurant and he ordered this dark colored looking drinks hey you won't you want to try this i was like what is i said now give me a sprite he's like hey why don't you try this i said what is it he said it's a drink made from tree bark i'm like why would you want to drink something like that what kind of scent would make you want to drink some tree ball come in on we ask ourselves sometimes why do you consume the things you consume when it's not going to bring forth life it's just holding up your growth process but i want to encourage you tonight hallelujah when that seed hallelujah comes forth out of the ground and let's just say it's now a little flower harley then it grows maybe two inches it's a little tree it still ain't no good to us right a little tree ain't nothing on it's just leaves and bushes now it's good for the deer we shoot the deer eat the deer hallelujah but i'll never get the seed like that right hallelujah i can't get the seed out of deer i got to get the seed out of that tree hallelujah you know sometimes we try to get life out of other hybrid things no you can only get life out of the original way and you don't church that seed it grows that tree it grows as a little branch i mean it's a little bush now it's about two inches high and the probably god say when it's two inches high every bushel hallelujah every barrel hallelujah every measure of of fruit that's in it is in it right then when it's two inches high amen let me say this if you are destined for the holy ghost if you are destined for the life of christ every blessing every miracle every healing every piece of joy is in you right now somebody say right now it's in you right now he said when the tree is this high every bushel is in it right then and it hadn't even brought forth any fruit [Music] yeah i know y'all think i'm crazy but leave me alone it's the heat listen listen to this everything you have needles now catch this now holly anybody need something from god about half of you the rest of you just here okay i wish i was like y'all didn't need nothing he says everything you need you have need of in this earth's journey anybody on a journey is in you when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost now this is the question do you have the holy ghost do you got the holy ghost brother hallelujah everything you have need of you already got it when you get the holy ghost if you seek the night hallelujah if you knew you got the holy ghost you already have your healing confess it right now tell satan get behind me to get behind me hallelujah everything i have need healing is a part of the seed where does healing come from jesus christ and what are we eating jesus christ so if i got jesus christ in me that means i got healing in me if i got jesus christ in me i got perfect love perfect faith i got meekness temperance joy everything that he is is in me when i become seed when you become seed hallelujah church we ain't lacking nothing when we receive the holy ghost this this quote where he encouraged me because i got some things i'm praying about but when i read this i'ma back up and read it again he says everything that you have need of in this earth's journey is in you when you receive the holy ghost hallelujah all the healing you ever need all the rejoicing you ever need all the power you ever need everything that you got in need of is in you when you hallelujah got christ in you hallelujah anybody got christ so we can leave out of here as a church not wanting tonight we can leave out here as a church believing hallelujah not wanting believing because you know we have to change our language you know we walk out and say man i just want the lord to bless me with this i want the lord to bless me with this you say no i'm waiting for god to fulfill this in my life hallelujah i'm believing god to fulfill this according to his will it's a part of the seed holy amen he says but the only thing you have to do is keep drinking and drinking now i'm coming down i get nervous he said the people don't get thirsty enough see that tree that little branch it has to remain thirsty because if it doesn't get thirsty it won't drink and it'll be water all around of it sitting on top but you ever notice hallelujah it rains and then the rain goes away what happened to it it doesn't evaporate it goes in the ground amen what is it doing it's bringing forth more life thank god for my thunderstorm but you know what we do we have thunderstorms and some of us stop driving i can't see no keep riding keep riding because you stay the course long enough you'll drive yourself right out of the storm hallelujah hurray where it's dry amen he said the people don't get thirsty enough the bible says blessed are ye when you do hunger and thirst after righteousness when ye thirst when you're thirsty you can drink and the more you drink the more you can spread out the more grace you get the more power you have the more faith you have as you keep drinking that's why we read our bible that's why we study this message hallelujah because we get more power we get more grace we get more fame hallelujah amen keep drinking from christ who is the inexhaustible life hallelujah drinking the seed form he's an inexhaustible fountain hallelujah but you know what the key is in my closing this is the key what we have to do is that tree as it comes out of the dirt and some of you may not be in a dirt stage right now some of you may be you didn't pushed out of that now you're in the presence of the sun and now you just a bare tree with no fruit still ain't no good to us what good are you to me without the fruits of jesus christ being manifested out of your tree you just a big tree standing there let me tell you a little story i like telling the story there's a young preacher that people used to say man you need to study and and maybe god will use you and you'll become a preacher so he started studying and getting his life together and just like everybody was telling him he became a preacher but once he became a preacher he got conviction so all the people that encouraged him they didn't like him so much when he started preaching against him then they started coming against him and saying are you too young and you two you two that so one day he went to the past he's in the pastor's office he said pastor the people that once supported me they don't support me no more he said son come here let me show you something he said look at this wonder he said what do you see he say i see two trees he said what kind of tree he say one is an oak tree one is a pecan tree he said what you see at the bottom of that at that oak tree he said nothing he said what you see at the bottom of that pecan tree they say sticks shoes rocks all kinds of stuff he said see this is the difference of the two trees he says the oak tree doesn't have anything anybody wants so nobody throws at his fruit he says but the pecan tree everybody wants pecans so to get it you got to throw at it hallelujah so if you're being thrown out that means somebody you got what somebody wants hallelujah the only reason people are throwing at you the only reason they lie the only reason they talking about you because they see your fruit and they want it we got to let them eat hallelujah listen he said you are a covenant people of god god god took christ apart at calvary making the covenant swearing by himself and he took the body upon heaven which will return someday he says but the spirit he gave back to lead the church the same life hallelujah what we should realize what we have the holy ghost is the same life that was on the cross that ought to make you rejoice it in a different life hallelujah so if your patience is being tested trust me you should have the same patience christ had to die on that tree it ain't a different patience it'll produce the same patience oh my the same faith where you say we understand that the worlds will frame hallelujah all of that is the life of the seed amen all of that is in here hallelujah he said but he said but but he gave back the same to leave the church the same life in christ jesus is in the church tonight by the holy ghost doing and acting and performing the same thing he did when he was here on earth you received it so we believe we had to restore the original word we have the original life of christ hallelujah don't take that lightly we should be able to see the same things manifested that we saw in christ hallelujah and that shouldn't be strange hallelujah because remember after jesus was gone and the disciples went out doing signs warnings and miracles the people started taking knowledge of them the bible said to acknowledge them that they had been with jesus what did they see they saw the same life amen they asked john are you the christ what was it they saw the same life oh my so what's our end you say oh brother i got i got the message i got the message i got seat i got to see no good no good just seed form is no good what i really want amen that seed ain't no good but this right here you know what dusk can do this right here can satisfy me oh this ain't good too brother eating in church what else am i supposed to do in church huh don't we come to church to eat hallelujah but it's the same some of you starving yourself but the only way i can get back to christ listen to me good now i'm gonna put some weight on your shoulders if believers if if if if unbelievers come in here that don't know god but they are seed the only way they can get to christ is to eat your fruit because where's the seed where's the seed it's inside the fruit it's inside the fruit right so that's why the prophet would always say a dead church is no good right hallelujah because it's not manifesting life nobody's eating off your tree hallelujah but if your tree is bringing forth life we all can eat hallelujah and you know what this can do earlier this can give me enough energy to get to the next day hallelujah i need to go on clothes so i can finish eating this but church i want you to think about it where is the life of christ now he's living in the fruits of the believer yeah we got the seed i'm not saying nobody's not bribed hallelujah but is there life coming forward again what good is a seed with no fruit ain't no good i'll take this and throw it out in the yard so we won't do now but if it's planted it's bringing for a fruit huh fruit in my closing fruit is the reproduction of the seed hallelujah so when we see christ being manifested in your church it's the reproduction of his life when we see the quotes and and the message and the bible and all the scriptures hallelujah living amongst us what is it it's the manifestation of christ hallelujah not in seed form anymore but it's the reality of the life see this is the reality of the seed right oh yeah see at first i just had the potential you got the books you got the tapes you got all that you got the potential still no good but when i got this i got substance i got material i got the real deal harley i got something that can nourish me holy i got something that can even cause me to grow hallelujah so church let's just remember the word of god is a what and as you eat you become what you eat amen so after the service i'm going to become peach because that's what i'm going to eat but spiritually what are we we're eating the word so we become the word come on musicians i'm closing if your fruit are really good you can do things that can excite the whole house because you take a sister that know what she got and can take this from just being a peach and turn it into a cobbler now we talking now your your fruit has become supernatural hallelujah hey man it's not just a regular peach anymore but now it's a cobbler same substance you just stretched it out a little bit more into another form how many want to be stretched out by god hallelujah let's pray lord jesus father we thank you for your word and lord we pray lord that the animation or the vision that was trying to be portrayed tonight that the people could see it lord that everything we stand in need of everything that we're longing and desire all of that life is already in the seed and father we just have to place ourselves in the right condition where it can come forth lord lord we love you and we thank you lord and we pray lord that you will just manifest your word tonight vindicate what we've heard in the name of jesus christ we pray church amen god bless you church i lifted of lord [Music] come and quench this thirsting of my soul prayed of heaven feed me [Music] fill it up and make me [Music] i lift [Music] come and quench this thirsting of soul bread of heaven feed me fill it up and make amen when do you think a plant stops needing dirt [Music] think about that for a second i loved that type that tribulations trials difficulties pains representing dirt you think about that what he said at the end that everything that we have need of uh by the bat is in us by the baptism of the holy ghost all the fruit of the spirit is there but you know you look at romans 5 it's tribulation that produces patience and so it takes that tribulation uh like soil has nutrients in it you know if you're gonna if you're gonna if you're gonna plant a garden you can't just uh you can't just throw in some topsoil it might grow but it's not going to be everything that it has need of you need you need compost you need manure messy smelly stuff but it brings it brings a nutrition a rotting something happens there and it begins to grow and that's that's those things that you're facing in your life those trials those difficulties those tribulations we don't like it we don't enjoy it but there's vitamins in there that's going to produce a fruit and i thought of the scripture um matthew 13 23 but he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word and understands it but it doesn't stop there which also bears fruit this is what god is looking for not just a dead seed in the ground not just a plant he's looking for that seed to produce something and not just one something multiplied it says which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60 and some 30. you got one apple seed you plant that it grows it might take years depending on the apple tree four or five years before you get fruit but then it brings about fruit and fruit and fruit and fruit when does the apple tree stop needing soil it never stops but think about it this way when does the fruit stop meeting soil when it's harvested [Music] the only time we stop needing these things in our life these trials these tribulations is when the rapture takes place when we're when the harvest comes so we haven't we have need of the word we have need of the spirit and we have need of tribulations and trials you know and it doesn't mean something's wrong or you've done something wrong if you're going through a trial in tribulation because i want to remind you jesus as a seed said he was made perfect he learned obedience through the things which he suffered he was sinless he was obedient and yet there was a maturity there was a growth there was there was a place of bringing him to the place that he needed to be in his life to be the sacrifice for you and me and it could only have come by trials and tribulation through his life so we thank the lord that he works it all for good there's good vitamins in that soil amen so thankful for that and we don't outgrow it you know i'll grow that need for that amen well we have a few waiting for some of the requests to come um we have one from sister sarah i believe says please keep brother harrison in your prayers we took him to the er this morning he had some swelling in his stomach which caused shortness of breath they've been able to drain a lot of fluid and is feeling better but they're suspecting an infection please pray with us that all will be well and that he can go home one more brother matt sent
