[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] God bless you all this morning amen good
[0:08] to be in the house of the
[0:10] Lord let's just all stand and we're
[0:12] gonna uh turn in our Bibles this morning
[0:16] we're going to turn to the Book of
[0:18] Proverbs
[0:20] first we're going to go to two two
[0:23] verses just two single verses today the
[0:26] first one is proverbs 4 and verse 7
[0:33] amen it says wisdom is the principal
[0:36] thing therefore get wisdom and with all
[0:39] thy getting get understanding and then
[0:42] we're going to turn over in the New
[0:44] Testament to James the Book of James
[0:47] chapter 4 it's right uh right after
[0:51] Hebrews James 4 right before
[0:54] Peter James 4:10 it says humble
[0:58] yourselves in the sight of the Lord Lord
[1:00] and He Shall lift you up amen let's go
[1:04] to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we
[1:06] thank you for this day father we thank
[1:08] you for Lord just the reading of your
[1:10] word we pray that you'd Lord open it up
[1:12] to us today Lord we love you and we
[1:13] humble our hearts to you now in the name
[1:15] of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless
[1:18] you as you take your seats this
[1:21] morning I've got a bit of an odd title
[1:24] this morning the Lord laid on my heart
[1:26] um a few days ago after my
[1:31] to so TI angles like angles in Geometry
[1:35] Not Angels amen um I have several quotes
[1:39] and several pictures this morning I so I
[1:41] made a slideshow for us to follow along
[1:43] and we'll get to that in just a few
[1:45] minutes you can leave that up though
[1:46] that's fine um we're going to look at
[1:49] Angles and perspectives this morning um
[1:52] perspectives are in the most basic sense
[1:55] a point of view um and I want to type it
[1:59] this morning to our our opening
[2:00] scriptures in with humility and with
[2:03] wisdom and that's why I chose those two
[2:06] uh two verses to open with I believe
[2:08] that perspective can lead to wisdom in a
[2:11] lot of situations amen often times if we
[2:14] can go into a situation or a question
[2:17] that we have in our hearts with humility
[2:19] God is able to show you the right angle
[2:23] and give you understanding on that issue
[2:26] amen and um you know we we receive
[2:29] perspective from many different sources
[2:32] I believe it's important to reach out to
[2:34] others that you trust for perspective um
[2:37] you know because many times they they
[2:40] might see things at at a different angle
[2:42] or at a different a different Viewpoint
[2:46] to give you a clearer picture of of
[2:48] what's going on to give you a more clear
[2:51] understanding um and that's in counsel
[2:53] in our friends and and people that we
[2:55] trust that hopefully have an experience
[2:58] with God Amen um but even more
[3:00] importantly when you find yourself in a
[3:02] situation that you can't seem to grasp
[3:05] and you don't know what to do God always
[3:07] knows best because he sees and he sees
[3:09] every angle amen um so so many times I
[3:14] believe that God is willing to give us
[3:18] insight to his view but it does require
[3:22] the correct approach and we've got to be
[3:24] willing to take it however it comes amen
[3:27] we when we were speaking last Sunday we
[3:29] spoke on on Josiah and his approach to
[3:31] God and how he humbled himself and just
[3:34] at the humility of his approach God held
[3:37] back cursing the entire Kingdom
[3:39] throughout his whole reign as a king
[3:41] amen so let's go to the next slide
[3:45] brother um I'll just have you control it
[3:47] I don't know how this thing even works
[3:50] it looks like it's on so we'll try so
[3:53] I'm going to have you follow me through
[3:54] this quote this comes from expectation
[3:58] 1958 where where my inspiration had come
[4:01] for this
[4:02] morning he says once there was a young
[4:05] musician who had trained in all the
[4:07] music that he knowed how to be trained
[4:09] in for he wanted to master in it and
[4:12] there was a great concert and there was
[4:14] a young fellow was to play and this
[4:16] young fellow was to play after he got
[4:18] through with his master playing oh he
[4:20] was Grand and all the people began to
[4:22] stand to their feet and applaud the
[4:24] young man with clapping their hands and
[4:26] screaming and whistling but they noticed
[4:29] the young man did not even notice any of
[4:32] that let me see if I can it works
[4:36] awesome he kept his eyes looking up and
[4:40] the more they tried to attract his
[4:42] attention by their screams and
[4:45] applauding he looked steadfast towards
[4:48] the top of the balcony and the audience
[4:50] was amazed to see him not accepting or
[4:53] bowing their applauding and they turned
[4:56] to see and up in the balcony was the old
[4:58] Master teach teacher he was looking up
[5:01] to see what the old Master said and not
[5:03] paying attention to what the people was
[5:06] around him saying if we could only do
[5:09] the same if we could look up and see
[5:11] what the master is saying and not notice
[5:14] what the people are saying
[5:17] amen John spra who was healed with a
[5:20] throat that could not speak which
[5:22] alarmed the nation through the magazines
[5:24] I was talking to him some time ago and
[5:26] he said I was in Paris and I was taking
[5:29] the tour around seeing the religious
[5:32] sights and so forth and I came into this
[5:34] certain garden and he said there was a
[5:36] statue of Christ and said I was looking
[5:39] at it and said my wife was looking at it
[5:42] and we were criticizing it in our hearts
[5:45] because it didn't have any really look
[5:48] to it that would look like the
[5:50] sufferings of Christ amen let me just
[5:54] follow along on
[5:56] here didn't have any look of it that
[5:59] would be like like the sufferings of
[6:01] Christ and said the guide came to me and
[6:04] he said sir you're probably doing just
[6:08] like all the rest of the tourists do
[6:10] when they come here you're wondering why
[6:12] the sculpture ever made the Statue like
[6:15] that he said yes sir I was he said come
[6:18] here just a moment he said you see there
[6:20] is a kneeling rail beneath the statue
[6:23] said yes sir said that's an altar said
[6:26] now you come here and get down on your
[6:28] knees and said now Now look
[6:36] up and when he looked up he said his
[6:39] heart almost failed him for the
[6:42] sufferings of Christ was seen in the
[6:45] sculptor's work and he said sir do you
[6:49] see this what the do you see the
[6:51] sculptor had in mind that Christ is to
[6:53] be knelt and looked up to that's the way
[6:57] he made it not to stand off criticize
[7:00] but if you'll get down and you'll look
[7:03] up to it then you'll see the full
[7:06] purpose my goodness and before you
[7:09] criticize the Holy Spirit and God's word
[7:13] it wasn't made to be criticized neither
[7:15] was the Holy Spirit kneel on your knees
[7:18] and look up to it and you'll think
[7:21] differently and God bless you s shall we
[7:24] pray and so he says we can just take
[7:26] that down for just a few minutes I'll
[7:28] have you go to the next slide here and
[7:29] just just a few minutes they were
[7:31] looking at this sculpture and they began
[7:33] to almost be critical of it you know
[7:36] they were Christians and yet they saw
[7:39] how it almost seemed that they were
[7:41] doing some kind of an injustice to to
[7:43] the cross of their lord and but the
[7:46] moment that they changed their Viewpoint
[7:48] the moment they got on their knees and
[7:50] looked up they saw the sculpture from a
[7:53] whole new angle amen and that's that's
[7:57] the only way the artist meant people to
[8:00] view the work of art it must have been I
[8:04] believe that the designer knew that only
[8:07] those who had experienced the love of
[8:10] the man on that cross would be able to
[8:13] respect and appreciate it the way that
[8:16] it was meant to be appreciated in the
[8:19] angle in which it was meant to be
[8:20] appreciated amen so he crafted it in a
[8:24] way the designer the sculptor crafted it
[8:26] in a way that only those who were
[8:29] willing to go at the foot of that cross
[8:31] and get on their knees and look up were
[8:34] able to see the whole picture amen glory
[8:38] to God and you know he um that just that
[8:41] just types everything in our in our
[8:43] Christian experience having the right
[8:45] having the right approach having the
[8:46] right attitude you know and um he told
[8:50] the disciples I wanted to catch this
[8:51] verse if you want to go to it for me
[8:53] brother Matthew 10 and verse 10 he told
[8:56] the disciples these things aren't given
[8:58] to them to understand but to you it is
[9:01] given amen Matthew 10 and the disciples
[9:03] came and said unto him why speakest thou
[9:06] unto them in Parables and he answered
[9:08] and said unto them because it is given
[9:09] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[9:12] Kingdom but to them it is not given for
[9:14] whosoever hath to him shall be given and
[9:18] he shall have more abundance but
[9:20] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[9:22] taken away even that he hath therefore I
[9:26] speak to them in Parables because they
[9:29] seeing see not and hearing they hear not
[9:34] neither do they understand and then in
[9:36] them is fulfilled the prophecy of isias
[9:39] which saith by hearing ye shall hear and
[9:41] not understand and seeing ye shall see
[9:44] and not perceive for this people's heart
[9:47] is waxed gross and their ears are dull
[9:49] of hearing and their eyes they have
[9:51] closed lest at any time they should see
[9:54] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[9:56] and should understand with their heart
[9:57] and should be converted and I should
[9:59] heal them and then in verse 16 he comes
[10:02] and says but blessed are your eyes for
[10:04] they see and your ears for they hear for
[10:07] verily I say unto you that many prophets
[10:09] and righteous men have desired to see
[10:11] those things which you see and have not
[10:12] seen them and to hear those things which
[10:14] you have heard and have not heard them
[10:17] and I believe that the same thing
[10:19] applies today many people can can read
[10:21] the same word that we read and can read
[10:23] the same things that we read and hear
[10:25] the same things that we hear but they
[10:27] don't have the right angle on it amen
[10:29] they don't have the Revelation because
[10:32] it wasn't given to them to see amen it
[10:34] wasn't given to them to hear um and and
[10:38] you see the the value the exponential
[10:41] value at at looking at something from
[10:44] the correct angle you know even when it
[10:47] requires sometimes a conscious effort to
[10:50] go out of your way to do it the sculptor
[10:53] when he created that sculpture sculpture
[10:55] of Christ he wanted to make sure that
[10:58] when people looked at this sculpture
[11:00] that they would see the fullness of what
[11:03] Christ had done for them and saw what
[11:05] what how God had suffered and died but
[11:08] anybody that would just pass by anybody
[11:10] that just reads the word just sees it
[11:13] and they don't see the fullness of what
[11:15] God really did for them amen until you
[11:17] have that experience where you get on
[11:19] your knees amen and you look up to
[11:21] Christ and you see him at a different
[11:22] Viewpoint you see him at a different
[11:24] angle at that point you're able to catch
[11:27] the revelation of what Jesus really did
[11:29] for us what he did for you personally
[11:32] not what he did for them but what he did
[11:34] for you and that's I I just thought that
[11:37] scripture or that uh that story brother
[11:39] renham tells of that man just typed so
[11:42] closely to what it is so it's so
[11:44] important for us to make sure that we
[11:46] have the right Viewpoint you know on our
[11:48] Christian walk but in every situation
[11:50] that we face this could go from from the
[11:52] biggest decisions you make to the
[11:54] smallest decisions you make because God
[11:55] is in all of it amen he's in every step
[11:57] that you're taking he's in every move
[11:59] you're making amen so sometimes it just
[12:01] requires us to take a a look from a
[12:04] different angle take a look from a
[12:06] different perspective
[12:08] amen
[12:10] um you know brother brandham had this
[12:12] dilemma he was facing one one day
[12:15] discussing discussing Jesus as the judge
[12:19] and he was talking about the
[12:20] supernatural Cloud there in Arizona that
[12:22] was captured 1963 and you know he tells
[12:24] this full story there in spiritual food
[12:27] and due season we're just going to catch
[12:28] part of it this morning um but I I have
[12:30] it if you if you want me to send it to
[12:32] you he couldn't he couldn't make out
[12:35] Jesus standing there with white hair as
[12:37] wool he he just couldn't quite
[12:39] understand it so he began calling his
[12:41] friends that were theologians and and
[12:43] doctors of divinity in the scripture and
[12:45] they gave him some explanation of the
[12:47] thing you know but the explanation that
[12:50] they gave him it just didn't resonate
[12:52] with brother brandom and so he brought
[12:54] it before God I don't think I have this
[12:58] in the in the slid so just going to go
[12:59] through this brother random says I got
[13:01] in the room there and I got to speaking
[13:03] to God and I run my accordance to take
[13:05] it back to D take it back to Daniel
[13:07] where it said and he came in the Ancient
[13:09] of Days whose hair was white as wool and
[13:12] I said Lord I don't know what to say and
[13:14] got the responsibility now that was
[13:17] before and remember before the Seven
[13:18] Seals was open about a year or more
[13:20] before I was praying there Lord what was
[13:23] it and I looked standing before me and
[13:26] there stood a man and he was a judge and
[13:29] he had a white wig on the old judges of
[13:32] ancient days used to wear a white wig to
[13:34] show that he was supreme authority and
[13:37] then when I seen Jesus with the white
[13:40] wig I said it only vindicates the truth
[13:43] that we know that he is the supreme
[13:46] authority God witnessed the same thing
[13:49] on Mount Transfiguration and said this
[13:50] is my beloved Son hear him the supreme
[13:53] authority moving down a little bit
[13:55] further he's begins talking about this
[13:56] cloud and he says now that
[13:59] then when that went up the big
[14:01] observatories from way down in
[14:03] California Plum down in Mexico over
[14:06] Tucson everywhere taking the picture of
[14:09] it it was a mysterious sight brother
[14:12] sofman here standing right yeah stay
[14:14] there for me standing right back there
[14:16] and I and brother Jee Norman standing
[14:18] right there present when it went up they
[14:20] took the picture still they don't know
[14:23] what about it here's some time ago
[14:25] everybody saying looky here looks like
[14:26] this and them Angels wings and how they
[14:29] folded in there and this is this is this
[14:31] next part is what I wanted to get to
[14:32] this morning if you
[14:34] catch the cloud and we all we're all
[14:37] familiar with this and we we all know
[14:38] where I'm going with this but one day he
[14:41] says one day turning it to the right
[14:44] looking there was Jesus Christ as
[14:46] perfect as Hoffman ever draw him it was
[14:50] standing there with the white wig on
[14:51] looking back towards the Earth showing
[14:54] that he is supreme authority the heavens
[14:56] declared it the Bible declares it the
[14:58] message declares it all the same supreme
[15:01] authority with the white wig on you see
[15:03] his black beard under many of you have
[15:05] seen the picture we got it right back
[15:06] there just turn it to the right sideways
[15:10] and look at it there he is just as
[15:12] perfect as it was if it had been
[15:15] photographed of him they were looking at
[15:17] it from the wrong angle you've got to
[15:20] look in the right angle amen and we see
[15:24] that today you I
[15:27] mean it there's many people you know who
[15:31] could still who still look at this
[15:32] picture and they still they could see it
[15:34] in this angle but they don't have the
[15:36] revelation of it so they try to explain
[15:38] it away but once you have eyes to see
[15:40] you can't unsee it amen you can't you
[15:43] can't look at that and say anything
[15:44] other than that's Christ
[15:46] amen and the only way he says that God
[15:51] can reveal Only God Can reveal which is
[15:53] the right angle you turn it to the right
[15:55] and look at it there he is just as
[15:57] perfect as if it had been photographed
[15:59] up there and then he said my my house
[16:02] has never been without that picture so
[16:04] you've got to look you've got to have
[16:07] what he says you've got to have the Lord
[16:09] to have you show to show you to look at
[16:12] it from the right angle amen and that
[16:15] that angle we were talking about it's
[16:16] it's perspective and and it can be tied
[16:19] to Revelation if you looked at that
[16:21] cloud with the wrong perspective or the
[16:24] wrong angle you might not and you people
[16:26] still might not be able to see amen what
[16:29] it is and what it means but if you're
[16:31] willing to do what that couple did in
[16:33] the story and get down on your knees and
[16:36] look up amen anybody that has that wants
[16:39] to follow Christ in the fullness of the
[16:42] word it doesn't matter where you are in
[16:44] life if you're willing to see something
[16:47] amen and I'm talking about the message
[16:48] of the hour if you're willing to Humble
[16:51] yourselves enough to see that God can
[16:53] still speak in this final day to you and
[16:56] look up and see God can show you the
[16:58] revelation
[16:59] God can show you the right angle you to
[17:02] look at that thing amen and and um and I
[17:06] believe it's it's it was like I said the
[17:08] sculptor had a purpose in making it that
[17:13] way
[17:15] um go to the next slide brother I think
[17:19] brother benam says that just puts me in
[17:21] mind of a Greek artist I seen one time
[17:23] in an ancient Cathedral showing what
[17:25] Adam and Eve looked like they looked
[17:26] like beasts or something and that's what
[17:28] the caral mind can perceive of some
[17:31] spiritual thing I think Adam was the
[17:33] most handsome man that ever lived and
[17:35] Eve was perfect a perfect woman in every
[17:37] way and now carnal Minds wrap up the
[17:39] thing in their own ideas and then God
[17:43] sends down and unfolds The Thing by his
[17:46] power amen your carnal mind our human
[17:49] mind can perceive something a certain
[17:52] way we get some idea of how something
[17:55] should be we get some idea of how we
[17:57] need to act we get some idea and we can
[18:00] even we can even think that it's right
[18:03] be sincere in thinking that it's right
[18:05] and it seems like it is right but until
[18:08] God shows you that it's the right thing
[18:10] until he opens up his word to you amen
[18:13] and and he gives you his revealing power
[18:16] you've got to take all the carnal mind
[18:18] and the your own perception out of the
[18:20] thing amen because carnal minds and
[18:22] perceptions that you have will never
[18:24] match up to what God can see
[18:27] amen um
[18:30] I think that there's there's uh a great
[18:32] value in having we talked about this a
[18:34] minute ago having another uh another
[18:37] person's perspective on a subject you
[18:39] know because we see we see things
[18:41] differently you know we're crafted
[18:43] differently amen you can see that in the
[18:45] gospels you see the same story told
[18:48] several times and it will have the same
[18:51] characteristics and the same idea and
[18:53] the same validity to it but because God
[18:55] chose different men to write it some
[18:58] things stand out to this man that didn't
[19:01] maybe stand out to this man amen because
[19:03] there was a different there was a
[19:05] different angle that they were looking
[19:06] at it from amen and that's what we are
[19:08] as Brothers and Sisters in Christ you
[19:10] know it says bear one another's burdens
[19:12] with each other so we we we we counsel
[19:14] with each other and you say well this is
[19:16] what I'm going through and you know if
[19:18] you approach it from the right angle and
[19:20] you allow your brother to to be a help
[19:23] in your life and you show him what
[19:25] you're going through maybe he can
[19:27] provide another perspective another
[19:29] angle another Viewpoint to give you
[19:31] Insight on how to handle that kind of
[19:33] situation
[19:34] amen
[19:36] um I think this this is also a really
[19:40] important concept when it comes to
[19:43] prayer um if you go to the next
[19:46] slide I think brother Brenham says this
[19:49] in questions and answers he
[19:51] says how do you feel is
[19:54] best the best way to find the Lord how
[19:57] do you feel it's the best way to find
[19:59] the Lord's will in some important
[20:00] matters now I don't believe let me see
[20:02] if I can get the can get continuity on
[20:05] it how do you feel is the best way um I
[20:09] see it should be a comment here I said
[20:10] was how do you feel is the best way to
[20:11] find the Lord's will in some important
[20:13] matters I tell you dear friend the best
[20:15] way to find the will of God in some
[20:17] important matters in life if you go to
[20:18] the next slide now let me here's a
[20:20] wonderful little thing if you have a
[20:22] matter that's very important now young
[20:24] people it doesn't matter what age you
[20:26] are if you have a matter that's very
[20:28] important listen to what the prophet
[20:29] says now there's the way I do it I take
[20:31] it before the Lord it's always been my
[20:33] strength I wait upon the Lord and see
[20:35] what he says and I just let myself
[20:38] neutral to it I don't take either side
[20:41] and say now Heavenly Father it can and
[20:43] it can and he's really just showing our
[20:45] human nature because when we have
[20:47] something that we're praying about
[20:49] whoever we are you know that maybe you
[20:51] want to go a certain way with it amen
[20:53] that's just our human nature you know
[20:55] Lord I'm laying this out before you but
[20:57] you know in your mind or in your heart
[20:59] maybe you want to go a certain way about
[21:00] it but brother brandom had this strength
[21:02] and he T types this out and he says if
[21:04] you get completely neutral on the
[21:05] subject it does it doesn't matter what
[21:07] it is small or big if you get completely
[21:09] neutral and you're willing to let the
[21:12] Lord actually speak to you because what
[21:14] happens often times is as we can take a
[21:17] subject to the Lord and we have a way
[21:19] that we already want to go with it amen
[21:21] and so then you're we're going to try to
[21:23] justify every which way to go that
[21:25] specific Direction I mean we're going to
[21:27] push and pry and try and do everything
[21:29] we can to go that way but God wants us
[21:31] to be neutral on it because maybe maybe
[21:34] we've offered two ways and he wants you
[21:35] to go a Third Way amen maybe he maybe he
[21:38] shows you three ways and there's the
[21:40] fourth way you know God has God sees
[21:42] everything amen he knows our life he
[21:44] knows every Every Which Way that we're
[21:46] going to go every decision we're going
[21:47] to make all of those things so sometimes
[21:50] we have these decisions that we need to
[21:51] make or we have these paths we're trying
[21:53] to take or we have you know we're
[21:54] praying about something this is how we
[21:57] have to do it he says
[21:59] get yourself neutral on this subject no
[22:02] matter how hard it is that actually in
[22:04] and itself in and of itself can take
[22:06] prayer Lord I want you have to maybe
[22:08] even come before the Lord and say Lord I
[22:09] want to be neutral on this subject maybe
[22:11] you have someone that you're that that
[22:13] you're young people that you're
[22:14] interested in I want to get neutral on
[22:16] the subject Lord I really want to go
[22:18] with this person but I'm going to get
[22:19] neutral I want to go with whoever you
[22:21] want me to go with amen I want God's
[22:23] choice on the matter I don't want my
[22:25] choice because God sees your future amen
[22:27] and that's who you want to help you make
[22:29] the decision
[22:31] amen go to the next slide for me slide
[22:34] 12 it says course now in most in in my
[22:38] case most of the time wow it's 10:53 uh
[22:41] if it's very important I wait on a
[22:42] vision but many people God doesn't deal
[22:44] with invisions so therefore I wouldn't
[22:46] advise you to do that I don't know if
[22:48] any of you see Visions but I wouldn't
[22:50] advise unless you're a prophet to do it
[22:52] that way because it's just some people
[22:54] that has visions and does it that way
[22:55] when you do something else that I
[22:56] couldn't do maybe is in your way of in
[22:58] the Lord God deals with us different
[23:01] next slide slide 13 and so if I would
[23:03] have uh if I was in your place I I
[23:04] wouldn't have visions from before the
[23:05] Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and
[23:07] say Lord now you show me what the
[23:09] decision is to make and then that's the
[23:11] way that you feel led to do it then wait
[23:13] just a little bit then wait a little bit
[23:15] longer and see which way which sh you
[23:17] lean towards he says now which way the
[23:20] spirit now father in my heart you know
[23:22] it doesn't matter but I want you to know
[23:24] about it and then he goes on to discern
[23:26] this is important friends because then
[23:28] he goes on to discern the spirit of so
[23:30] many people's questions regarding this
[23:32] matter because what happens in this
[23:33] situation is you get yourself in a
[23:35] situation where you don't know the
[23:37] answer and you cannot you cannot find
[23:39] the will of the Lord amen who's ever
[23:41] been in that you you're praying about it
[23:42] you're waiting and then you've waited
[23:44] and then you've wait it and Lord I don't
[23:45] know exactly what to do and he says
[23:47] brother bam says you know that
[23:49] everybody's had had that question before
[23:51] he says um he says what if I chose the
[23:54] wrong thing what if I'm not sure and I
[23:56] chose the wrong thing that's the way he
[23:58] says I do about meeting sometimes I feel
[24:00] kind of led to go this way or that way
[24:03] then I'll follow that way that's the
[24:04] best way to do it cuz it's in prayer
[24:06] then that you're doing the best you can
[24:08] and I believe this my friends as Paul
[24:10] was in in the New Testament was days
[24:11] gone by he was between two Straits which
[24:14] way he would go and he started on the
[24:16] wrong road and he got to the Macedonian
[24:18] call and I believe if you're making a
[24:20] decision for God and you do it the best
[24:22] that you can I believe God will correct
[24:24] you and don't see that you don't go
[24:26] wrong I believe God will do it going to
[24:28] make wrong decisions you're going to
[24:30] take paths that that you messed up but I
[24:32] believe if you're a son or daughter of
[24:34] God God will correct you so if you're
[24:35] not sure you know type it out wait on
[24:38] the Lord but if you're not sure make the
[24:39] decision and then if God is in your life
[24:43] then he will correct you in what you're
[24:44] going to do amen he will show you the
[24:47] way he will show you the path amen he
[24:49] will make it clear to you you just have
[24:50] to be willing to see it from his angle
[24:53] amen and it's it's a just a beautiful
[24:55] place to be as a Believer completely
[24:58] neutral on the subject ready and willing
[25:01] to go whichever way the Lord leads you
[25:03] amen willing to go either way whichever
[25:06] whichever way amen uh then God can can
[25:09] really do a work in your life um just in
[25:13] the my closing comments the Bible says
[25:15] that the fear of the Lord is the
[25:17] beginning of wisdom amen Proverbs 9
[25:20] teaches that and that word fear speaks
[25:23] of reverence amen and I believe in many
[25:26] cases I believe that we fear the the
[25:28] Lord we reverence the Lord enough to
[25:30] save us from our sins enough to help us
[25:33] when we're in trouble enough to do these
[25:35] things but if true wisdom only starts in
[25:40] the Bible what the Bible says it only
[25:43] starts in fear in reverence of him then
[25:45] that shows us that our wisdom in this
[25:47] life starts when we're able to respect
[25:49] God enough to to make our decisions in
[25:52] our life no matter how big no matter how
[25:55] small if you're willing to if you're
[25:58] weighing something you're you're willing
[26:01] to let him make that decision amen we're
[26:04] sometimes so and I I I'm speaking to
[26:06] myself sometimes we're so stubborn in a
[26:07] certain situation you want to go a
[26:09] certain way because you feel like this
[26:10] is the this is the leadership of the
[26:12] Lord but then God shows you that's not
[26:14] the leadership of the Lord you need to
[26:15] go this way with it well I'm stubborn
[26:17] and I feel maybe I need to go this way
[26:19] you need to be willing to let God show
[26:22] you Amen to let God lead you in all
[26:24] things and really that's just the
[26:27] beginning of wisdom amen glory to God
[26:30] let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank
[26:32] you for this day we thank you for the
[26:34] word Lord we pray that you just minister
[26:36] to us Lord from your servant Lord as we
[26:39] father go and move into the service I
[26:41] pray for the the musicians the song
[26:43] leader Lord God we just open up our
[26:44] hearts Lord I just want to receive
[26:46] something from you we love you and we
[26:48] ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[26:51] God bless you
