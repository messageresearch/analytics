thank you jesus blessed be your name o god hallelujah amen praise the lord first samuel chapter 30 if you have your bible amen this morning god bless you amen good to see everybody here in the house of the lord you love him this morning amen i'm so glad to be here amen and we're just uh grateful amen our family is grateful this weekend amen for the past few days here for your love and your prayers and thoughts and different i know that the whole church was praying amen and so i'll just give an update i know my dad is at home streaming this morning amen and he he would have been here against my our advice to say don't come stay home uh but he was ready to come but the the medicine that they got him on they're gonna have to change it's made him a little bit light-headed and dizzy and so he just wasn't able to come this morning but i know they're home streaming and so uh we're disgrateful amen we're grateful to the grace of god amen that watches over us even when we don't realize he's watching us and so i'll just say you know to make it just to say it briefly um you know because i know my dad he's a he downplays everything and he's watching he downplays everything and uh you know and and and he wouldn't make a deal out of it um but what took place was a big deal and that was a real big deal for us and for him and according to the doctor uh we're very lucky to have him and so the the doctors the cardiologists made it really clear really uh really obvious that um you know the the artery that he had 99 blockage in was one that could have killed him at any moment could have had a massive heart attack but the lord the lord's in control of when we have our last heartbeat when we breathe our last breath god doesn't control that you don't even control that the lord controls that right and uh and brother branham says the if the footsteps i remember reading uh this uh the bible says if the footsteps of the footsteps of the righteous of a righteous man are ordered of the lord and so that means that every step even your last one is ordered of the lord and god wasn't ready amen to take him and we really surely definitely weren't ready to lose him in any way shape or form and i said dad you're too valuable you mean too much to too many people you're a you're an essential uh player you're a franchise player as he calls it i can't lose you and so we're grateful amen just to see the way the lord worked everything out a great testimony we could share about it and i'm sure he'll he'll get a chance to do that but um it was it was just the lord everything looking back from last wednesday when uh when he when when everything sort of happened i'm sure you noticed a little commotion there wednesday night but we made him go said gotta go now and uh and and so he's in the i he's called he calls himself the eternal optimist and he is and he is an optimist looks at the bright side of everything and this time it was it was uh to him it was to a fault i could say because he just you know thought everything was fine and it'll be good and you know no big deal and it turned out to be a very big deal and actually the cat the the stress test had it revealed really much of anything uh would have just probably sent him on his way amen but the the holy spirit just stopped that and actually a brother had uh had texts that brother daryl ward had texted whose family has had we know you know brother brother daryl's family having different heart issues and then uh you know brother daryl had rode in there said brother jason even if you you passed the stress test you know i'd recommend get the heart cath because a stress test you can pass a stress test completely and and then fell a cat the cath show blockage and so um so i texted him i said i think that was from the lord he said yeah i do too and then sure enough the doctor thought the same thing said we're gonna do one even though you passed the stress test we're gonna do one and when they did it immediately they seen the blockage and and just told you know he told my mom and uh probably was the worst thing he could have told my mom but he called my mom and said you're lucky he's alive lucky he was in my office you know of course we look and say it ain't got nothing to do with luck you believe that there ain't nothing that happens it's luck or bad luck or good luck it's all the mercy that god blesses us and watches over us and protects us amen so we're thankful looking forward to having him amen back here if you have your bible first salmon chapter 30 amen we'll just read just a few verses here amen first samuel chapter 30. and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that were there and they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep david's two two wives were taken captives let's all move on down to verse six and david was greatly distressed but the people spake of stoning him because of the soul because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god david said to abathar the priest amalek's son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abbathar brought thither the ephod to david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all so david went he and the 600 men that were with him and they came to the brook bethsor where those that were left behind stayed amen i'd like to minister to you this morning on part two of restoring years let's just bow our heads here if you have a need maybe you just make it known lift your hand say lord amen i've got a need upon my heart why don't we just pray lord we're so grateful jesus for your grace thankfulness lord comes from there of our from our soul this morning how you watched over my dad lord and our pastor father lord how much he means to us to this whole church lord to every family here lord and we're grateful lord we just want to take a second and say thank you lord jesus how very different this service could have been this sunday morning we could have spent today in sorrow lord but you had a different plan lord and and in all of it lord it was to show your your glory it was to show your protective hand upon your children that you put a hedge around them and satan can only go so far as your prophet said satan can't even touch you until god's finished with you so we're grateful for that this morning lord we ask that you would be with us now lord in this service and each heart each life that's gathered here today lord with different needs the hands were raised up my hands lowered up this morning asking you god to come and be the need meter this morning lord jesus may you touch every life every heart lord god i pray that your word would be in season lord may it speak to the to to the very soul of every individual that's here this morning we give you all the thanks all the honor and all the glory in jesus christ's name and the church says amen you can be seated this morning thank you amen musicians restoring years we spoke on this wednesday and i just want to continue as a second part to that tonight amen just to see where the lord will have us and we'll have us go thank you brother john it's amazing when when you read this and i've ministered on this many times this story in first samuel chapter 30. we've spoke on this uh before and the lord just brought this back over in my mind and i thought about how much that david had lost and and the the i've learned so much from this man's life from david's life amen i believe he's so relatable to all of us here this morning and and and maybe different stories uh that you've read maybe different bible characters or different uh things that you've pointed out i believe that's important you know god speaks by his word and the prophet of god said find someone find a story identify yourself in the word and say that's me lord and and so i i so identify with with david i think we all can relate to how he must have felt when he comes back home from uh from war with his with his men and there's ruins and destruction and his home is torn down and his his everything he had lived his life everything he had built up and everything he had worked for uh he had lost it all and and he and and it was looked like a picture of just ruined looked like a picture of just complete despair complete destruction and and calamity and you know calamity strikes sometimes so unexpectedly and crisis can come upon us sometimes just when we are least expecting it and when we're least prepared for it and when we're least uh when when we're least ready for it you can never prepare for you don't always have the opportunity but you can never prepare for unexpected crisis and when suddenly there's trouble and sometimes trouble comes that way i believe that even the world that we live in is uh is a uh is so very different i read yesterday i was reading in genesis and read the entire story of creation and watching how the spirit of god just moves and and as i was reading the the the the the my bible there i could hear as i'm reading each verse i can hear the the prophet of god just begin to dramatize the way that the logos just moved out from god and he says and he he started cooing to the seeds that were already in the earth and and he said as he began to coo and the holy spirit began to move over the earth he said darkness begin sorry seeds begin to come forth and life began to come forth and he said and he'd coo over the earth and and a tree would would pop up just like that and he said he said watching the holy spirit brood upon creation and and i was reading through my bible and and and just watching just going through the the creation and the way that the the earth was just responding and and and they they were it was just so re the creation was so responsive to the moving of the spirit you know why because darkness had been removed the the the the darkness had been removed from the the earth and the seeds and when the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the spirit of god moved upon the earth the earth responded magnetically it had a reaction to the spirit of god i began to read that and i said lord i want to be that i want to be responsive that when the spirit of god begins to move over my life that there's no darkness there no hindrance there there's no blockages there there's nothing to stop the spirit from moving freely over my life there's just a freak open channel i said lord i want to i want to be li i'm like the earth i was in that dark condition and darkness covered the face of the deep but you spoke to that darkness and the darkness was removed and the earth got into a condition to where it could respond to the voice of the lord there was no hindrances there i told the brothers in the prayer meeting last night i said i might preach home after going through all this with the heart doctor and my dad and all the you know the the this 99 blockage i said you know i think i might just preach a sermon on spiritual blockages where we're so blocked from the from the from the freed the free moving of the spirit of christ and the blood has to flow i want the blood to flow freely say lord i don't want there to be no no blockages in my life nothing causing a spiritual heart attack but let my heart be healthy let me you know how you know you're healthy when you can react and you move and your your your life changes from the moving of the spirit of god i read all of that yesterday and i was beginning to read on just to watch the way that the creation and life begins to to come forth and seeds and plants and botany life and the earth just begins to get a revival and begins to be stirred and begins to be moved and begins to dance and begins to move to this to the rhythm of the creator as he coos over its creation and all that all you go through all of the creation and you've got this beautiful perfect planet and perfect world to where everything's in harmony and everything's synchronous and everything's moving by the voice of the lord and then he comes to the very end of it and god and the bible says and god said it is good and i thought he looks over this earth and there's there's harmony and and there's life and there's health and and then god says and it was good and i thought as i read those words i looked in there in my bible and i said lord how very different how very different the the world that we live in today is from that world that i read about how very different we that god looks at the earth and says it's good but what's happened it's it's it's not good anymore it's not good at all the world that you live in god doesn't look at this cosmos and the condition of of our world and say it's good it's it's very good no it's it's under a curse it's in it's in travail it's in groaning it's in it's in uh uh a birth pangs and the earth is not good i i read that just i was reading my bible and i said lord what a wicked world we live in today what a what a what a what what an evil what an evil world that we walk through and we exist in and we live in and we work in and we we go and we make the best of it you should we make the best of it that we can we make the you know and but there's you know really friends there's so much there's so much facade there's so much pretense we we we do the best that we can to to to cover up and to patch up and to hide the darkness and the evil and we do everything we can to keep ourself from it you should you should keep yourself from it you do everything you can you keep the world you keep the the atmosphere of the world i don't want anything i don't want any part of it in my home i don't want any part of it in my mind people the people's living in such a neurotic condition to where there's such anxiety and it's just complete insanity and total insanity i mean you can't even you no matter where you go there the the world they're such a thin veneer you know of of of of happiness i was taking i was just reminded taking my dad monday me my dad left our thursday morning leaving the cardiologist after they told him he had to go to the hospital and we didn't don't even get out of the parking lot there's already a road he's backing out and some guy thinks he's cut him off and this guy's in a rage and he's ready to get out of the car and he's ready to really he was ready to fight us couldn't believe it i hear my dad we've just we're about to go to the hospital he's already having heart trouble and now this guy's blowing the horn and and and waving his arms and all we did was just back out of the parking space and he's just on someone looked at his face and he's just so on edge and i thought my goodness it's such a nervous such a nervous condition such a such a an anxiety the the the the world the the the the the the atmosphere of the world today is so tense it's so tense there's so much tension there's so much pressure to wear and you deal with that every single day you don't know what's gonna happen you have no you know you don't know you know uh uh what what's going to take place you can be anywhere you read about the people you know shopping in a shopping store and some guy comes in with a gun and starts shooting people little children going to school when someone comes in shooting people you know it's just it's an it's a there's a present there's a presence and a present evil all the time and it's a we're preaching on restoring years all the years that joel says that the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm the locust all that they have ate away and i'm beginning to think about this this morning and i said lord it's just such a world that constantly even as believers as christians we're living in a world where there's a corruption that's in the rest of the world and and the the devil has the ability to even affect us as believers living in this fallen world to rob us and to steal from us anything he possibly can i thought about that you know i i i said that to my dad i said you know why satan you know you know why you're my dad who's saying lo it must mean the lord still has something god didn't take me it must mean that the lord has still has some work for me to do and he wrote that in the church chat must mean the lord still has a fresh purpose and the lord has a purpose for my life i said dad that's right but it also means that satan hates you he can't stand you he wants to destroy you he wants to take you off of this earth and you know friends let me just say that the devil hates you if he can kill you he'll kill you if he can take your life he'll take your life if he can rot and if he can't you know what he'll do he'll rob you because jesus says the thief comes to kill to steal and to destroy he's a robber he's a thief he'll steal he's a thief he'll take he'll take whatever you whatever he can he'll rob you and and there's there's there's sorrow you know we're grateful here today thankful here today that god spared uh that god was watching over protecting my dad's life so thankful but i think of how much tragedy others in that same situation have faced as the nurse begins to tell us a nurse just uh the the this the other day sister uh brother travis's secretary there katie be in the hospital and begin to tell us a story about one of the nurses that she worked with and her her you know and her mom had had a previous heart attack and they called her and said she's on the way now she's coming got her bed ready got her room ready got her got her got her got her room ready was going to receive her and and before she can the husband comes into the emergency room to take her in and he comes and he says i think she's she's passed out he said she's not out of the car goes out to the car and she begins to tell us there she is dead in the car didn't even make it to the hospital room starts doing chest compressions trying to resuscitate her and just she was just expressing to me to say you're so lucky to have your dad and she said there's the the worst horror stories of my career in the hospital was those situations where you lose some where it doesn't turn out the way that it turned out for you and i thought you know this is the world that we live in such a we live in a fallen world and we live under the curse of sin and for as much for his firs for as for as much happiness as there is there's sadness for as much joy there's sorrow and there's there's there's times of loss and we go through pain some of us even in our own church you know some of us you know got covered and and and we we had hardly no symptoms and you know really it was worse i would take the flu i've told people i said that my the cobia when i was diagnosed with coba they said how bad was that i said i would take that and quadruple it before i would get the flu that's how the flu's bad but the flu was much worse but you know that wasn't everyone's story i have a brother here in our church who suffered greatly from it and on in and out of the hospital and and some who even passed away and died from it because you say brother matt why is that because it's an evil world and darkness covers this entire world and the atmosphere of this world is a it's in a condition it's in a it's in a condition of curse and death and god protects us i'm thankful for that and we have the blood of the law of jesus that we plead over our lives and you should be pleading that and say lord protect me and watch over my life and and and guard my heart and guard my home and guard my family keep me from the evil one you know that that ought to be more we ought to pray that every day of our life ephesians 6 the the take on the full armor of god you ought to wake up every day and say lord let me put on the full armor of god before i go out into this world give me the shield of faith the helmet of salvation give me the sword of the spirit let me make sure that that i'm walking under the unction of the holy spirit that keep me as jesus prayed keep me from the evil one deliver us from the evil one i'm just telling just preaching to you what the lord just highly placed it upon my heart amen that that there's there's in this world that we live in there's death there's sickness there's lots of sadness there's disease rampant mental disease physical disease all those things are real and you live in it every single day and there's just a there's a there's a there's a uh you that that doesn't even that just covers the diseases and sicknesses it says nothing to do with the the greatest disease and that's sin amen and and more than ever before we live in a sinful world you know we're we're so you don't realize how sheltered you are to live here in a small city even you go and study the the the lineage of cain and you'll find that it was kane who is who who it was the lineage of cain not the lineage of seth but it was the lineage of cain who created um uh uh i'm trying to think of the word here but who who was ironsmiths and and and created uh uh uh commerce and and cities they were builders of cities you know what a city is it's centralized it's centralized so what is what is this what is this what does a city do it brings in sin and it centralizes sin and it's very it's very centered with sin you just go into the cities one time you don't believe me go travel to nashville we were there just a couple weeks ago wanting to go see the downtown area of nashville oh it's going to be great you know looking forward to seeing all it's going to be my goodness couldn't even hardly go down a street without having to close your eyes because of just the the sin was so rampant rock and roll music bars playing on every left hand right hand left hand right hand people half dressed guy selling marijuana right on the street and we went down one street and down the other street and down the other street what was it the closer you go to that city center the greater the sin becomes more sinful and more sinful and more sinful you won't find that really in and you go to rural areas of america if that's all you've ever experienced if you've only ever living in small cities and rural areas you know you'd say my goodness how could they put someone like kamala harris how could they put joe biden what's wrong with this world it must have been a rigged election there's no way everyone i talk to likes trump everywhere i look as american flags everyone i talk about says in god we trust you know and there's a disconnect because you're like how could how could he have won there's no way he won there's no way he won the election i mean how could they have put a guy trump was you know stood for israel you know he at least professed that he was trying to do good things for christians and everybody i'm around is you know well don't don't forget you live in the bible bell and if you've ever of all you ever experiences rural areas and small cities you don't realize it wasn't those small cities and rural areas that put him and put joe biden in office it was cities city centers and you go our intercity and i i stopped and i had some of my nieces and nephews i forget it was ryan mita and my kids i had gideon and the rest of them in there and i said guys listen i said you want to know who put joe biden in office you're in it right here and the background is the loud rock and roll music guy selling marijuana on the side of the street women really with nothing not wearing anything adultery and fornication going on right in front of your eyes and you wonder why brother branham would make a statement like if god lets it go any longer he'll have to he'll have to apologize to sodom and gomorrah for the sin that would be so rampant in the world it's a sin disease it's a sinful world and it's more sin is more accessible to people when to the hidden sin is more easy to hide than ever before hidden sin in the heart private lives are more it's easier to be private about something and and and to keep it concealed to conceal david said to them to conceal a transgression he said i concealed my transgressions and it destroyed me internally you know it's more it's easier to live that kind of a life than ever was before because you can do anything you want you have the world wide web be anything live in a romantic relationship and don't tell anybody about it haven't have an affair online don't even tell anybody have a relationship online don't even tell anybody but no one ever even knows you say that stuff doesn't happen brother matt why you say why does it happen because it's an evil world and there's present evil everywhere it's ever present but you know what the bible says it says god says i'm an ever-present help in the time of trouble as as ubiquitous as sin and and satan and demon spirits and and and and evil is in the entire world god is is covered he says i'm in all i'm through all i'm in you all i'm everywhere i'm just a prayer away [Music] i don't know how we got on that but let me just let me just continue on here this morning it's it's a i i preach that to say it's a you live in a world to where you can lose so much and you don't even realize it because satan's a robber he's a thief he comes to steal he comes to kill he comes to destroy and he'll rob you sitting in church he'll rob you claiming to be a christian he'll rob you having a spiritual or a godly marriage and a godly home and a good family don't ever forget the thief is out to kill you he's out to steal from you and he's trying to destroy you and the bible says he's a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he's always on the prowl he's always trying to disrupt he's always trying to destroy and you get to a place you're like oh i'm you know we're doing good the church is in revival and you know my family's doing good and things are looking up and and god's doing something for me just be careful because don't ever get complacent don't ever get complacent in that condition because satan's busy he's busy all the time trying to disrupt trying to rob you trying to steal from you i remember i preached a message on that years ago and i had something stolen from my from from my uh i had a car was broken into and i had i just that's what it was i had a tool very expensive tool stolen you know it's amazing because i didn't i didn't even realize it was gone until it was almost probably three months i've traced down the date to when it was stolen it was three months later and it had been stolen for three months and i had no idea until i needed it and looked for it and thought my goodness where did it go and begin to trace it and track it down and i thought my you know that's the that's the that's a good thief you know what a good thief does a good thief i'm not talking about a burglar comes in you know and he just robs you and kills you i'm talking about a thief we had our cars broken into and i remember the police officer told me they said you got to understand he said these guys guys broke into your car he said they've been they've been probably walking through the neighborhood he's probably seen him a hundred times and he said they were watching you studying you when are you home what time does lights go out what times does lights turn on or what time do you go to church he said last sunday we had a woman a house broken into while she was at church took everything in our electronic device in our home he said these these guys study they watch they wait i begin to think about that and say you know that's exactly like the devil the devil studies us and watches us and waits for our weakest moments our most vulnerable times when we're complacent in our heart he knows just how and when and time to have a perfectly precise time when to attack you and that robber that that thief the the police officer said he said he's been studying you he said they want you they they they wait for the right opportunity to strike and if they can that he says like this thief they'll do everything they can so that you don't notice you don't notice anything it's just gone i didn't notice anything would have never known didn't know that entire time i had been stolen from and here it was gone and i and i had no recourse now months later they don't they don't a good thief doesn't rob from you and then the next day call you and say ah i got you i took all your stuff go open the drawer it's gone no they wait they hope that they can leave everything undisturbed so that you don't even know any any disruptions happen in your life and i you know i thought that's exactly like just like the devil how many times you you don't even realize the joy of the lord's gone until suddenly down the road you you just you can't worship the lord like you should you know church attendance slowly falls off and before you know it you're just here on sundays and you're never here on wednesdays and then before you know that you're not it you're you're not you're not fellowship you know it's a it's a sign it's a it's a a spiritual barometer and god has these in our life i believe that they're important because the bible says you should guard your heart you should watch your heart guard it watch it make sure make sure that to say like david lord search me see if there be any wicked way in me don't let me don't let me get a blockage in my heart and not know about it then down the road i have a crash or some great crisis uh lord let me be inspected now inspect me now lord and let me say if there's any blockages in my life lord would you clear them all out would you free my mind free the channels david was so greatly stolen from i could imagine as he comes to that calamity as we said the calamity strikes so unexpected and you know satan attacked what was dearest to him notice he doesn't take it's he doesn't either david doesn't come home to all of his valuables his money stolen and all of his gold and all of his diamonds and his wives are crying and his family's crying they came in and raided us and took everything they took all of our possessions all of our years of life savings all of our no but what is what is the devil attack he doesn't he does he bypasses the money he bypasses the material things and he goes right to the most important most closest nearest to his heart amen nearest to his to his emotions he comes home and it's not his belongings that are gone but his family if satan could hurt you the deepest way he could possibly hurt you is when he attacks those you love can you say man mothers say man fathers attacks those who you love and it was it was this was the center of of of satan's attack on david he he attacked who he loved the most his family his children the men they come home it's not just david's wife and his children but his his men's children all of their families and then he burns everything to the ground he burns it all they david comes home to complete destruction hillman 600 men after coming back from victory and they come home and now the amalekites have kidnapped everything now david doesn't know that they're kidnapped at this point for all he knows they're dead for all he knows the calamity he's walked into is complete loss everything's burned down the bible says in verse three first samuel let's turn let's read it here for a moment first samuel chapter 30 verse three i'm seeing bibles i'll wait give you a second to get to that scripture here's the scene he comes to the bible says so they came david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters how important these people how intricate how how special saying the text the most special thing to you he's a thief and he's a robber and he's a destroyer takes he tried to take the one of the most important people in my life my own dad tried to attack his life i'm sure you could testify here today and say the the satan is satan's out to he's tried to take my wife maybe your husband maybe your children maybe your father maybe your mother because he's a destroyer he's a thief he's a robber and he hits you where it hurts the most and the bible says david notice you imagine as these men no doubt the the the there's just silence they they don't even know what to say what is that what's happened they're in shock complete shock no no no idea you imagine i thought about this you imagine the mind battles imagine the things they begin to think in their mind of the fate of their family they come back home and now suddenly everything's been flipped upside down everything's been flipped completely upside down he says in verse 4 notice the bible says then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep you look at this show you look at this here it's a it's a he had a reason to weep he had a reason to be these men had a reason to to cry they had a reason to question they had a reason to to to ask and say god why would you allow this to happen why would something like this take place why such calamity lord and the bible says they begin to weep and they begin to cry no doubt it was a time for weeping it was a time for sorrow as solomon says there's a time to weep there's a time for sorrow there's a god has a purpose in that god has a purpose for your weeping don't hurt in your hearts amen but god has a purpose god had a season there's a reason that god allowed them i hope you catch this here this morning there was a reason that god allowed the calamity to happen and for david to experience the emotion of being forsaken and forgotten there was a reason that god allowed david and these men to have such an uncertainty there was no angel that stepped out and said don't cry don't cry no no no no you guys have misunderstood this it's okay they're gonna be all right the end of the story david just enough in a few hours you're gonna get everything back oh oh oh thank you thank you for telling me that i i begin to get worried you know god doesn't do that god allowed him god allowed him to experience that what-if god allowed him to experience those thoughts of wow how things could have been so different you know sometimes god will bring you to the very edge in your life god will bring you to the very edge just to cause you to ponder that question for a moment and you realize what things are important and what things are not important you let calamity or health problems strike and then suddenly all of your business that you've been working so hard on let let a loved one get sick to the point of death and you don't know if you're going to have them or not you don't know what's going to happen and you don't know the outcome you don't know if you're going to lose them suddenly everything gets very what you thought was real now it's real anybody know what i'm talking about and god allows that to happen because it's important david it's important for you to know it's important for you to experience it's important for you to process this for a moment and i want you to process it i'm not going to tell you i'm not going to say anything i'm going to let you go on believing now god knew that his wife and children were safe he knew that all of these men all of the men's families you go we're going to read it here in just a minute the bible says they recovered all and then emphasizes and says both great and small in other words every little thing he didn't lose anything he didn't lose one speck not anything there was nothing but david restore was restored everything as we preached on you wednesday night god restores everything he's restoring the years the locusts the pomeran the caterpillar and there's nothing lacking that's what the my king james says there was nothing lacking not great not small but you know what david didn't know that at this moment he had no idea of that and god intentionally didn't let him know that he wasn't going to tell him that god was gonna allow david and these men to wipe to weep until they had no more power the bible says look at verse four they had no more power you ever cried and cried and cried and cried so much to you can't cry anymore you know what that feels like you're out of tears you're still crying but there's nothing coming out you have no power to weep anymore and then the bible says notice this it says it says they had no power to weep anymore go to verse 5 the next verse and david's two wives were taken captive verse 6 and david was greatly distressed distressed greatly distressed god why'd you allow him to go through that lord you were going to rescue him you were gonna save him all of his family was okay they were actually okay at this point moment god you had a greater plan why didn't you tell him that you allowed him to go through this moment sometimes that tension that you feel in your life is not from the devil it's from god because god's trying to get your attention god allows and manipulates manipulates certain circumstances in your life so that that language that you you haven't heard is language of love you haven't heard you haven't heard the language of the word you've ignored that you haven't heard the language of the preacher you've ignored that you haven't heard the language of wisdom from friends you've ignored that so god has to speak a different language to get your attention and david's greatly distressed calamity strikes for the people spoke of stoning him total loss no cattle no homes no crops no family no children no wives and the bible says that they spoke of stoning him what an amazing time what what an amazing scene here the bible says because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david here's the notice the colon there every man including david was grieved for his sons for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god there was a time when distress was okay there was a time when weeping was okay but that time had now ended and god said it's not you got to end that day of weeping you've got to end that day of sorrow i purposed it in your heart but now that you've got to have a you've got to get your fight back you've got to get your faith back this situation has caused you to to go to the ground and weep and and wonder what's going to happen to your life but david you're going to need to get up off the ground because i've got to work for you to do you're going to recover everything that you've lost but you'll never recover anything weeping on the ground you've got to encourage yourself in the lord you've got to build your faith back up you've got to get your your spiritual man uh wake him up inside of your soul and say lord i believe that you're in control in spite of what i see or understand i believe that you're orchestrating the events in my life in spite of how badly i think i've messed it up the bible says david encouraged himself in the lord listen to hebrews chapter 12. quickly brother george if you could hebrews chapter 12 and verse 12. listen to what he what the scripture says here paul says this song i don't thank you perfect wherefore he says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees in other words david you got to do this you can't stay there crying you can't stand there weeping lift up those hands don't feel like lifting those hands lord they're so heavy i'm going through so much lord don't you know how much i've lost i don't you know how much the how heavy the enemy's attacking me paul says lift up the hands which hang down even if you don't feel like it this morning even if you don't feel like it lift up those holy hands and those feeble needs go knees go to verse 13. notice what he says in the next verse he says wherefore lift up the holy hands which hang down and the feeble knees in other words strengthen the hands that's what that word means there strengthen the hands which are weak and he says and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed you're hearing the word of the lord this morning to david get up david don't stay there david don't stay there david lift up the holy hands the feeble needs make straight paths for your feet because if you don't you'll stay in that if you don't you'll never recover all unless you get past this david you'll never you'll never recover your wife your children your home don't stay down exercise paul says exercise the gift that's within you exercise your faith so how do i do that brother matt well i promise you there's got to be resistance in order to properly exercise if you're feeling good raising your hands don't mean nothing you know what exercise it is when your hands are heavy and you raise them up in spite of it it's when you're down cast and depressed and you have no reason you have no reason to have joy you have every reason to have a frown on your face but you smile what are you doing you're lifting up the feeble hands you're you're lifting up the feeble knees you're strengthening the feeble hands you're making your path straight because if you don't you'll succumb to that fear if you don't you'll you'll succumb to that worry it'll suffocate you brother john saying sings that song fear is a liar it'll take your breath it'll take your happiness it'll take everything out of you to take your joy it'll take your praise it'll take your spirituality but you know what you do you say fear is a liar so you cast your fear in the fire because fear it is a liar you got to encourage yourself in the lord you got to say lord i believe you're going to restore but no one's going to do that for me it's not going to fall out of the sky you've got to get up off the ground you've got to get up all onto your feet and say lord i believe i'm going to stand i believe your promises are yea and amen there's a time to cry but there's a time to exercise your trust in the lord jesus i preached a long time ago on isaiah 52 i just want to mention it here today the lord made it fresh to me isaiah 52 brother george and verse 1. this is isaiah speaking about what he calls the daughter of zion which is speaking directly to israel and their condition and listen to the words of isaiah from the from god this is the words of god through isaiah and he's speaking to this daughter of zion he says awake awake put on your strength o zion isn't that amazing the way he words that awake awake like waking someone up who's in a slumber who's in a sleep wake up what are you doing what are you doing get out of bed wake up put on your clothes you got to get dressed you've got a job to do there's a battle raging the lord needs you he can't have you in bed what are you doing in bed get up he says awake awake put on your clothes what is your clothes your strength put on your strength o zion he says put on he says put on your beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come to you shake yourself from the dust isn't this what david did he shook himself from the dust you know what david was doing he was completely changing the atmosphere and until you're willing to change your atmosphere you'll never change until you're willing to change the atmosphere you'll never change because as we preached on last wednesday if you just stay in a negative negative atmosphere negativity breeds more negativity it becomes like a like a cancer depression just leads to deeper depression sadness leads to deeper sadness david could have stayed there but the what was the atmosphere the atmosphere was one of sorrow and everybody had everything in common you say brother matt but he had a reason absolutely he had a reason [Music] he had a reason yeah yeah he could he could justify his calls as many of us can in times of great calamity and crisis we could justify it and that's what we do yeah that's what we do yeah that's easy to preach preacher you don't know what i'm went through and you don't know what's happened in my life and yeah let me just give me a few minutes and i'll tell you and it's true you know it's true people have reasons and i'm not taking away those reasons i'm not here to tell you you don't have a reason to to be downcast you don't have a reason to be crying on the ground you don't have a reason to be in the dust i'm not here to say that today not here to say there's david had a reason but david had to understand that as long as he stayed in that atmosphere of depression and sorrow and worry he would just perpetually stay there you know what we do when we get in that condition we expect someone to come around you know i'm just so you get so wrapped up in yourself we expect someone's going to come and someone's going to pick me up and there's someone lay hands on me it's going to deliver me and i'm just waiting for some man to come and somebody to come and waiting for the holy you know what god wasn't going to sin god god wasn't gonna send a a prophet in this case for david god wasn't gonna send a preacher he wasn't gonna blow a trumpet as many times you read in the bible when men would cry out then god prophet would come but god was just waiting he was just waiting just watching how long was david gonna stay in there i'll tell you how long david would have stayed crying with his men he would have stayed there till his men stoned him and he would have succumbed to that but you know what david did david david himself he himself three people me myself and i david encouraged himself in the lord you know what david was doing he was refusing to live in a negative atmosphere but it didn't make any sense brother man he had every reason to be that's right he did have every reason to be negative but he is also a man of faith and he had every reason to believe he had every reason to give god a chance he had every reason to believe in the bible says david encouraged himself when no one else was there to sing david began to sing sometimes you need a song for yourself it's good for others to sing for you and you get blessed by that but sometimes god needs those words to come out of your lips you say why because it'll do something to you that other singing won't do when when you begin to confess and you begin to cry out and you begin to proclaim the promises of god for yourself when david began to say i'm not going to wait on anybody what was god saying david uh you're not going to send anybody you're not going to wait on anybody you're not going to be able to draw from another man's well but you've got to draw from the well that's down inside of you whether you realize it or not david you've got it within you david it's within yourself all that you need to get out and change your circumstances not external it's inside of you david you just gotta have enough faith to believe it and cry out and claim it and say i'm gonna i refuse to stay down i refuse to stay on the ground i refuse to stay bound in the dust i'm going to stand up to my feet i'm going to raise the hands that are heavy and feeble i'm going to strengthen the weak knees i'm going to make my path straight wake awake put on your straight though zion your beautiful garment old jerusalem he says loose notice what he says here shake yourself isaiah 52 shake yourself from the dust shake yourself this should this is verse 2 brother george shake yourself from the dust arise from the dust and sit down in other words she wasn't sitting she was on the ground groveling shake yourself arise and sit on old jerusalem loose yourself verse three hey oh don't just keep stay there sorry verse two he says shake yourself from the dust to rise and sit down in jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck wait god you you mean wait you mean this band around my neck you i was waiting for you to to lose that i was waiting for you to deliver me from that i was waiting for a preacher to say something i was waiting for them to pray for me lord i thought you know god says loose yourself the only thing holding you is you the only thing holding you back is you loose yourself from the bands in other words god was saying i didn't put them there i didn't put them there satan didn't put them there you put them there yourself so loose yourself there's chains satan puts on us but in this case this depression this negativity that's always staying down never going forward staying complacent perpetually in a ditch and perpetually in a rut i'm just in a rut i just feel like i'm so down i feel like i'm so depressed oh brother man i have no joy anymore i just can't get any joy to sing anymore i can't get any joy to praise the lord anymore i'm just always so downcast uh what's god going to do for me i hear what the word of the lord says shake yourself from the dust arise thou o man of god sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck loose yourself o captive daughter of zion what a condition what a condition he describes there he says the uncircumcised shall the unclean shall no longer come to you in other words he says here this is israel remember this is israel this daughter of zion this is who it is are you here this isn't jezebel this isn't jezebel laying in the dirt this isn't jezebel this is god's daughter amen you speak very differently to your own daughter this is his daughter this is the redeemed of the lord this is who god the the we can say it this way this is the purchased of his blood this is the price this is this is the purchase that calvary bought and paid for as the bible says you are not your own you are bought with a price what is redemption redeeming is when god goes and buys you back he buys what's what's already his he redeems it back to himself i could hear the words of sister brenda lewis say that's what redemption is all about he went to the pawn shop and he brought me out oh hallelujah i i i all i can do is praise the lord because of redemption it bought me back when i couldn't save myself and lose me when i couldn't free myself his blood purchased me and i'm his and he is mine oh daughter of zion get up who were you once once daughter you were pure and beautiful and virtuous and righteous and spotless oh and you gave birth to sons and you had you had a family you had a heritage you had a home you have a name it's the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob there's there's a there's a blessing that's upon your life there's a blessing from your father abraham and i swore by your father that your seed shall possess the gate of his enemy that's who you are oh daughter of zion get up awake what are you doing on the ground don't you realize who you are don't you realize what you've been called to don't ever let the devil tell you you're just a captive uh you know a harlot over here don't don't ever let them tell you're to somebody over here worthless you're the redeemed of his blood amen but now your garments are torn filthy and you'll die in that condition and slavery that's what that chain was that that yolk around her neck you've enslaved yourself you imagine here as the bible says she she laid there downtrodden became a doormat for the enemy that's why it says the ur uncircumcised are no longer coming into the you've given yourself to to to the enemy you've given yourself to the enemy you're you're you're in that you're in that perpetual condition and you've here's there's the worst part you've done it for nothing notice the next verse he says in verse 3 notice let's read it again he says for thus saith the lord you have sold yourself you have sold your self you cannot satan cannot buy what god has already bought but you can sell yourself and you say what do you sell yourself to you sell yourself to lies lies of the enemy you sell yourself to a lie god doesn't love me church doesn't love me no one wants me around no one needs me i'm not needed anymore you know what you're doing you're selling yourself to a lie i'll never i'll never be anything i'm just always going to stay in this condition you're selling yourself this isn't for me i i don't even know i just feel like i don't belong you're selling yourself you've sold yourself for nothing that's what that word means for not for nothing yeah you've sold yourself and it and it was for nothing it was it was for nothing no no no you didn't you weren't overcome by some great uh unseen powerful raiding army and you were just the unfortunate daughter who was just captured no this is different this is very different you sowed yourself to those lies you entertained them you flirted with them you believed them and now they've built a stronghold in your mind and you wonder why you're depressed you wonder why you're constantly struggling you wonder why there's so much anxiety you wonder why you're having to satisfy yourself with things of the world to satisfy a thirst for god down inside of you because you've sold yourself you've sold yourself you know what that that you know what you have to do in that condition as we preached last wednesday repentance is recognition you first must recognize i'm wrong what's brother adam say the zeal of the hour is to repent to say i'm wrong lord as the song we sing it's not my brother not my sister but it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer when you recognize and you know what you recognize sin is not worth it lies and those lies of the devil is not worth it doesn't lead to any happiness it leads to corruption it's senseless it's useless the cycle of sin is one that ends in a dead end literally a dead end that road to sin leads to a dead end there's no real joy there there's only temporary satisfaction and you sell yours why god says you've sold yourself for nothing all that you've given yourself to you give yourself to those worldly passions those those those human lusts and you know what they give you in return sorrow you know what alcohol gives you all the pleasure and all the fun and all the joy of the world and all of its music and all of its all of its fornication and all of its lust you know what it pays in the end nothing it gives you a broken body a messed up home a broken family complexes and lies and scars don't believe the lie of the enemy listen to me uh young people here tonight don't let it today don't listen don't don't listen to the enemy that tries to sell you a lie that there's real happiness there's no contentment there there's no peace there there's only despair you'll end up like this daughter of zion laying in the dust groveling in her pain chained i'm closing chained broken chained and broken chained bound addicted what are you doing there who are you who are you ask yourself that question who am i me you're not a daughter of jezebel this isn't this isn't a daughter of the wicked one your daughter of the lord let me say it for all of us you're a son of god what are you doing there what are you doing there you're a daughter of the king and so what does god do he sees her in this condition and listen to what this listen to what the cooing wooing voice of the lord begins to say i love this i love this next verse it means so much to me the lord doesn't the lord doesn't say he doesn't walk up and say fine fine that's fine just lay there i'll get somebody else that's all right you want to stay there and you want to keep on in the way that you're going whatever but listen to what the heavenly father says verse 1 isaiah 52 verse 1 awake awake you know when

god says the same thing to peter after peter felt him god says after peter's all messed up he's all messed up in his mind you know why because pride had got him to such a point to where he didn't think it was possible for him to fall peter got to such a point and he curses the lord denies he even knows him you know what god does you know what jesus does when jesus sees peter jesus says to simon it says so when they dined jesus said to simon peter lovest thou me more than these peter lovett thou me but lord i messed up so bad i'm just so you don't understand all of his pride everything ever before before before peter gets to this point you know he had he he he thought he was someone special you know god will take a person like that and god will allow that person to come to such intense trial to where all of their grit and all of their will and all of their willpower and self-determination fails them and then they bow their head and come back and say lord without you i am nothing felt like such a failure god says to peter lovett thou me peter more than these you love me peter more than all your pride amen more of all your boldness more of everything that you've got you love me more than that peter oh but you know what peter had to do peter had to first deal with himself he first had to get past himself but god have messed up yeah i know peter you've messed up but but lord but but but you don't understand i know that peter i know what you went through i know what your life's been i know what you did but i still love you peter do you love me are you willing to get past that you see it wasn't until peter could get past his own self david had to get past his own self he couldn't question what his the mistake that he had made oh i've messed up so bad and now all these men have lost all of their family all of their homes all of their life the bible says david encouraged himself and the lord he tells abithar he says give me an ephod notice here in in in first samuel 30. we're going to close with this right here verse 7 and david said to abbathar the priest elimelech's son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod nabathar brought through the ephod to david and david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall overtake them he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely you notice right when david encourages himself in the lord god immediately comes on the scene immediately comes on the scene you imagine the test that david has he's even thinking grab me the ephod i get abathar the priest david doesn't know what's going to happen probably knows god's completely forsaken him but as soon as david could get up off of the ground as soon as david could stand up to his feet god speaks just like that shall i pursue you shall as if god was just waiting for the moment so that he can say you're going to get it all david now you've done the right thing now i can speak to you you're not on the ground anymore shall i pursue after this tube shall i ever take them and he answered them pursue in other words go forward for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover oh everything nothing will be lost verse 17 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and their escape not a man of them save 400 young men which rode upon camels and fled it's a good thing david gets victory you know what you're going to get victory let me give you the word from god you're going to get victory i don't feel like it you're on the road to victory and you're going to whip that devil who's been bothering you you're going to destroy all enemies will come under your feet but let me go further than that not only are you going to defeat the enemy but the bible says in verse 18 and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives verse 19 and there was nothing lacking someone say nothing nothing i said say nothing nothing there was nothing lacking to them and in case you didn't realize what he meant when he wrote that let me go a little bit give you some more detail neither small there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great
