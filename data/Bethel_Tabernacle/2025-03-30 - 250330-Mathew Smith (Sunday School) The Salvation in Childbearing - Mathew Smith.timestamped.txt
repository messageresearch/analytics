[0:09] Good morning. Let's uh stand and have a
[0:12] word of prayer if we would.
[0:17] Dear precious father, Lord, we come
[0:19] before you this morning, Lord, yielding
[0:22] our hearts to you, Father, that you
[0:24] could speak to us and that as we would
[0:27] open our hearts
[0:30] be pliable to the word, Father. That you
[0:33] would mold us and make us into something
[0:37] perfect, Lord. Lord, that maybe if I
[0:41] could step out of the way and allow you
[0:42] to speak through me, that Lord, I could
[0:44] say something that, Father, the people
[0:46] would find helpful, that they would
[0:50] be able to go to their heart, Lord, and
[0:54] help them to grow into the perfect image
[0:57] that you would have for all of us, Lord.
[1:00] So, we ask you be with us this Sunday
[1:02] school, anoint the word, what's spoken,
[1:05] be with us through the remainder of the
[1:06] service, through the worship of the the
[1:10] preaching. Lord, we ask these things in
[1:11] the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:15] I want to turn this morning if you would
[1:18] to
[1:20] 1 Timothy chapter 2 and verse 5.
[1:31] This
[1:37] something's wrong. Hang on.
[1:50] Somehow.
[1:58] Well, all right then. That's the wrong
[2:00] scripture. How' I put that down?
[2:04] Um, let me pull up the
[2:12] Ah, that's why because it's 1 Timothy
[2:14] chapter 2 verse1 15. Forgot that. Um,
[2:19] so we're going to go to 1 Timothy
[2:21] chapter 2 and verse 15.
[2:24] Um, actually let's uh let's
[2:28] go back to verse 13. We'll start from
[2:30] there.
[2:32] says uh verse 13, for Adam was first
[2:34] formed, then Eve, and Adam was not
[2:37] deceived, but the woman being deceived
[2:39] was in the transgression. And verse 15,
[2:42] notwithstanding, she shall be saved in
[2:44] childbearing if they continue in faith
[2:46] and charity and holiness with sobriety.
[2:49] And um y'all can be seated. And I want
[2:52] to want to start by laying a little bit
[2:54] of foundation. It might not seem like
[2:55] it's related to that, but it'll circle
[2:57] back around.
[2:59] Um, and I want to start with
[3:04] my notes back up. There we go. U, I want
[3:08] to start with a a quote. This is from
[3:10] the breach
[3:12] um, in 1963. It says, "And they lost
[3:15] their claims on eternal life by the fall
[3:17] of Adam and Eve, who fell from eternal
[3:19] life to death in the Garden of Eden and
[3:22] brought all nature under them to death.
[3:25] A tree never died before Adam. An animal
[3:28] wouldn't die before Adam. And there's
[3:31] only one thing that cannot die, and
[3:33] that's God. Because he's eternal. And
[3:36] that's the only way we can ever keep
[3:38] from dying. We have to have eternal life
[3:42] in us to be sons and daughters of God.
[3:45] But when we died, as I said in the
[3:48] message this morning, to sin, we sold
[3:51] out our birthrights and crossed this
[3:54] chasm. Now we're beyond the reach of God
[3:57] on this other side of the chasm. Now of
[4:01] course when Adam fell to death, he
[4:04] brought death upon all creation.
[4:09] Now I want to read again and this is
[4:11] from Satan's Eden 1965.
[4:14] Um he says now he by this fall
[4:18] um it has took over the possess uh took
[4:21] over and possessed the garden of Eden
[4:24] himself. He took it over and now he has
[4:27] had 6,000 years of deceitful rule,
[4:31] deceiving the people, God's children, as
[4:33] he did then because they were based on
[4:38] free moral agency to act any way they
[4:41] wished to and believing that they would
[4:44] act right or trusting that they would
[4:45] act right, then they've come with the
[4:49] wrong act and sold their birthights as
[4:53] Esau did for for the world. And Satan
[4:56] won it and he took it over. And he's had
[4:59] 6,000 years to build up his Eden as God
[5:03] had 6,000 years to bring his Eden to a
[5:06] close. And by deceit, deceit of the word
[5:10] or the people now established his own
[5:13] Eden in this earth in sin.
[5:17] Now,
[5:19] um I read that because I want to
[5:21] establish something and that is that
[5:26] um you know
[5:29] this this this idea that you know God
[5:31] takes a thousand years to build an Eden.
[5:33] In the midst of that Eden, there's a
[5:34] tree of life and a tree of knowledge and
[5:36] then mankind falls. And so now Satan has
[5:39] a right to build an Eden, right? He took
[5:42] he the birthright was ownership of Eden,
[5:46] right? That was the birthright and or to
[5:48] possess Eden and to live there. And so
[5:51] now Satan took that birthight and now he
[5:54] has the right to build in Eden. Okay? So
[5:57] he builds it. And so the the earth is
[5:59] fallen. It's it's it's it's a a thing
[6:02] created by Satan. It's going to be a
[6:03] thing plagued with with torment and
[6:06] death and sickness and disease and and
[6:08] and chaos and all these different
[6:11] things.
[6:12] they're going to be the product of Satan
[6:14] and and uh you know what it's going to
[6:18] be Satan's vision for humanity, right?
[6:22] And so as a result, everything that
[6:25] comes from the earth is now cursed with
[6:29] Satan's design, right? Which creates a
[6:32] problem for us because we're made of the
[6:34] dust, right? We're we are from dust we
[6:37] came and unto dust we go, right? We have
[6:40] a a body that's made of the dust of a
[6:43] fallen earth. The food that we eat, you
[6:46] literally your physical body is now
[6:47] under a curse that is subjecting it to,
[6:53] you know, the the control of Lucifer.
[6:57] And so, as a result,
[7:00] we have all kinds of problems.
[7:02] Obviously, we get sick. But you know in
[7:05] our in our bodies we have failures, we
[7:06] have faults, we have all these many
[7:08] things and many of much of that is the
[7:11] pro the product of the fact that our
[7:13] physical bodies
[7:16] um don't just stop with you know what
[7:19] you can see right you we we think of we
[7:22] interact with the physical world with
[7:23] our five senses but we also know that
[7:25] there's five spiritual senses
[7:28] and those five spiritual senses are also
[7:31] tied directly to your physical body
[7:33] Right? I mean, you know, uh just to to
[7:35] list them off, you have imagination,
[7:38] conscience, memory, reason, and
[7:39] affection. So, Brother Ram lays out as
[7:41] the five spiritual senses. Well, if
[7:43] memory is a spiritual sense, it's an
[7:45] aspect of your spirit man, but you know,
[7:48] it's not it's not a a crazy notion for
[7:51] somebody to get hit in the head in an
[7:53] accident and then lose their memory.
[7:55] Okay? So, your your spiritual senses are
[7:58] tied to your physical body. There's an
[7:59] aspect of that, right? I mean, we know
[8:01] that, you know, reason
[8:03] Well, re, you know, your logic, your
[8:05] reason. Well, I mean, you know,
[8:08] teenagers
[8:09] uh don't really develop that. You know,
[8:11] people don't develop that fully till
[8:12] they're 25, right? Because your brain
[8:14] doesn't finish developing. I heard it. I
[8:17] think this is one of my favorite quotes
[8:18] I ever heard. I think it was Samuel
[8:21] Clemens uh said this. Said that um when
[8:25] he was uh 14, he thought his father was
[8:27] the most foolish man to walk the earth.
[8:29] And then when he had turned 21, he was
[8:31] shocked to see how much his father had
[8:32] learned in just seven years.
[8:36] Um, you know, his reality is that, uh,
[8:40] people, you know, it's it's, you know,
[8:43] your your brain doesn't really finish
[8:44] developing. You're you're trying to
[8:46] think if you're a teenager, you're
[8:47] trying to think with half your brain
[8:48] tied behind your back. It's why God gave
[8:50] you parents to help you get to the point
[8:53] where you're 25 and your brain is fully
[8:55] developed and you can actually think.
[8:57] And it's amazing when you know when you
[8:58] turn 25 and you s suddenly realize come
[9:01] to the real realization mom and dad were
[9:02] right. It's like yeah well that's
[9:04] because you have a brain now right you
[9:06] know and it and so but this is your
[9:10] reason this is a aspect of your spirit
[9:11] man that is directly tied to your
[9:15] biology right to your physical man. And
[9:18] so
[9:19] obviously all of these things these
[9:22] aspects of your spirit man is going to
[9:24] be tied to your fallen earth man. It's
[9:26] that's why, you know, and you've heard
[9:28] it before, but I'm, you know, maybe just
[9:31] showing a little bit of a different
[9:32] angle
[9:33] that your spirit isn't redeemed
[9:38] under. Your spirit doesn't get the Holy
[9:40] Ghost, right? The Holy Ghost falls on
[9:41] your soul and the the Holy Ghost can
[9:43] work and and cause your spirit to to
[9:46] behave, right? But it doesn't really get
[9:47] the Holy Ghost. It doesn't get redeemed
[9:50] because it's part of your flesh, right?
[9:52] That's why you can have the Holy Ghost
[9:53] and still have struggles and still have
[9:55] issues because and that all has to be
[9:58] brought under subjection of the word.
[10:01] Now
[10:04] um
[10:07] so but but we can get all kinds of all
[10:09] kinds of scars and damage because we're
[10:12] part of Satan's Eden, right? We we're
[10:14] we're a kind of a product of it, right?
[10:16] Your physical body is a product of this
[10:18] world that it's immity against God. So
[10:20] much of your spirit is gonna not
[10:23] naturally have a desire for the things
[10:26] of God, right? It's why at the pinnacle
[10:29] of Satan's Eden, isn't it funny how the
[10:32] like the like the number one message
[10:34] that's taught to young people is follow
[10:36] your heart.
[10:38] And I'm here to say no. Do not follow
[10:41] your heart. Your heart is desperately
[10:43] wicked. Your heart is immity against
[10:45] God. your heart. Following your heart is
[10:48] a scam, right? It is a it is a it is a
[10:51] landmine that's waiting for you to step
[10:53] on it so it can ruin your life. Okay?
[10:56] Your heart is immity against God. And
[10:59] your heart will lead you into all kinds
[11:00] of horrible things because it's it's
[11:02] fallen. It's not it's part it is it is
[11:05] as as fallible and corrupt as your
[11:08] physical body is. It is as susceptible
[11:10] to disease and ailment as much as your
[11:12] physical body is. Okay. mental illness
[11:15] is is real, okay? And if you've ever
[11:19] encountered it firsthand, you will
[11:21] there's no doubt about it, you know,
[11:26] but
[11:27] it's because but we're at the
[11:28] culmination of this of this Satan's
[11:31] Eden, right? And so that's why uh you
[11:34] know, we struggle so much with a lot of
[11:36] these things. Things are so oppressive.
[11:40] But
[11:41] if if Satan
[11:45] had destroyed God's Eden, had taken it
[11:47] over by causing the woman to partake of
[11:52] the tree in the midst of the garden,
[11:56] then logically or in fairness and and
[12:00] its tracks through the word that God
[12:03] would have to destroy Satan's Eden by
[12:05] having his woman partake of the tree of
[12:08] life that is in in the midst of Satan's
[12:10] Eden, right? That when God comes down in
[12:13] the form of a man is the tree of life
[12:15] descended into the midst of of Satan's
[12:17] Eden and went a seed went into the
[12:20] ground and died and rose up as you know
[12:23] and he said I am the vine, you're the
[12:24] branches, right? Christ is the the vine
[12:28] uh you know maybe a more translation a
[12:30] better translation to modern English
[12:31] would be I'm the trunk of the tree and
[12:34] you are the branches, right? He's the
[12:36] the stem and everything else comes off
[12:38] of that.
[12:39] Well, so here's the the tree of life
[12:44] grown in the midst of Satan's Eden. And
[12:45] it is the bride is called to go to that
[12:48] tree of life and partake, bring the
[12:50] seed, and then manifest that back
[12:52] through herself.
[12:53] Okay? It's to to do exactly what Mary
[12:56] did to to bring forth the life of God
[13:00] again, to take in the word and express.
[13:03] And we've talked about this um a lot. I
[13:06] don't want to keep reiterating points.
[13:08] I'm sure you're all very aware of. Um,
[13:13] but I, you know, but we talked about how
[13:15] it's our our our our responsibility.
[13:17] It's our calling to accept the
[13:20] quickening power
[13:22] of the word, right? You know, and the
[13:24] word the term quickening is used all
[13:25] throughout the Bible. Um,
[13:28] and uh, you know, we talked about Paul
[13:31] how he talks about it would quicken your
[13:32] mortal body.
[13:35] um or you know we were you know uh you
[13:37] know dead in sin and that but it we were
[13:38] quickened. Um
[13:42] also a lot in uh in Psalms, David uses
[13:46] this a lot uh you know calling on the
[13:50] Lord you know in prayers in in psalms of
[13:52] prayer calling on the Lord to quicken
[13:54] him right that he feels you know that
[13:56] the enemies around about them but Lord
[13:58] quicken us well the word quicken I did a
[14:02] little bit of a study on it
[14:04] um
[14:06] because so some of you
[14:10] may be familiar if you followed the um
[14:13] when they overturned Roie Wade and in
[14:16] the in the Supreme Court decision if you
[14:18] read that um they cited one of the
[14:22] oldest
[14:23] um the oldest law that we have is
[14:26] actually English common law from back in
[14:28] like I think the 1500s where under
[14:31] English common law protection of the
[14:34] unborn started at what they called the
[14:36] quickening.
[14:38] Okay. To the under in the the original
[14:41] origin of the word quickening in English
[14:43] is specifically when a baby receives
[14:47] life in the womb. That is what the word
[14:50] comes from. Okay. Specifically the word
[14:54] the the word quick is uh comes from old
[14:58] English or actually technically old
[15:00] German um which means to be alive or to
[15:03] live.
[15:05] And the historical sign of it, it was
[15:08] the concept of quickening as the first
[15:10] sign of fetal life. Uh because that was
[15:13] the first indication that they knew that
[15:14] the baby was viable and alive is when it
[15:17] started moving because they didn't have
[15:18] you know in the 1500s they don't have
[15:19] ultrasounds, right? And so
[15:23] but what is that right? It's it's you
[15:25] know so in the in the Bible when it's
[15:27] talking about to quicken you know those
[15:29] who are dead and are being quickened it
[15:32] means to revive the dead right you know
[15:34] Christ was was quickened you know he was
[15:36] dead and then he was quickened back to
[15:38] life but it's always going to carry the
[15:40] underlying implication of the new birth
[15:43] right there has to be a birth there a
[15:46] new birth of life come into that um
[15:49] because that's what the word quickening
[15:51] means it is it is a reference to to a
[15:55] seed coming forward and a baby going to
[15:58] be born from that new new life
[16:03] and
[16:04] um
[16:07] you know so like in in in D in the
[16:09] Psalms man the Psalms are full of David
[16:12] calling on the Lord for quickening power
[16:14] right and if you don't take it from this
[16:18] approach then you think David is he's
[16:21] surrounded by enemies right he's
[16:22] surrounded on enemies on all sides ides
[16:25] and he's asking the Lord for quickening
[16:28] power. And you would read this and think
[16:31] David is surrounded by Philistines and
[16:32] he's asking the Lord for super speed.
[16:35] No, David is surrounded by his own
[16:37] faults and failures and is asking the
[16:39] Lord for the new birth. That is what's
[16:42] happening, right? the you know the the
[16:47] so when we're talking about um
[16:50] so now in this context where we have the
[16:52] bride of Christ in this day our mandate
[16:57] to to bring to fulfill the plan of
[16:59] redemption just like Ruth and Boaz right
[17:02] the plan of redemption with Ruth and
[17:03] Boaz did not end it was not fulfilled
[17:07] when Ruth and Boaz got married
[17:10] okay that was not the point of the
[17:12] redemption The point of the redemption
[17:14] was to raise up new seed. That was the
[17:17] point. The redemption did not finish.
[17:20] The story of Ruth and Boaz did not end
[17:21] when they got married. It ended when she
[17:24] had a baby.
[17:26] Right? There's a there's a very
[17:29] important that's the the the culmination
[17:32] of all this.
[17:36] And I this whole thought came about and
[17:39] I'm going to you know I don't got too
[17:41] much time left so I want to wrap it up
[17:42] and put a bow on this for you and tell
[17:44] you where this came came from. This this
[17:47] thought that's all my foundation. I'm
[17:48] going to I'm going to tell you why this
[17:50] all is important to me.
[17:52] Um, so,
[17:57] um, I was reading
[18:01] was actually I think I was listen to a
[18:02] podcast originally and then I did a
[18:03] bunch of reading on this um, where they
[18:06] talked about they were talking about the
[18:09] benefits and the importance of pregnancy
[18:12] for women and how integral the you know
[18:16] the idea that oh well men and women are
[18:18] all the same and no they're not. women's
[18:20] biology is entirely built around
[18:22] pregnancy. That is like their entire
[18:24] body is built around pregnancy and
[18:26] everything they do even psychologically
[18:28] their their mental state is wildly
[18:30] affected by all of this. Um, everything
[18:34] is built around pregnancy and and having
[18:36] babies
[18:38] and
[18:41] when a woman is having a baby, there is
[18:44] so much that goes on in that that you I
[18:48] mean the idea that this is somehow like
[18:50] equivalent like the the amount of uh um
[18:52] like the hormone release that affects
[18:54] your psychology and affects all kinds of
[18:56] things. And one of the things that they
[18:58] mentioned that I had somehow never heard
[19:00] before that blew my mind was that during
[19:05] pregnancy, the fetus can donate stem
[19:09] cells to the mother.
[19:12] Okay? Now, for those of you who don't
[19:13] know what stem cells are, when a baby's
[19:16] first forming, it starts out with one
[19:19] cell and then that cell becomes two
[19:20] cells and four cells and eight cells and
[19:21] 16 cells and it's a little little
[19:23] bubble, little blob that's growing and
[19:25] growing and growing growing. And those
[19:26] original cells aren't eye cells or skin
[19:29] cells or heart cells or whatever.
[19:30] They're not tissue cells. They're what
[19:31] they call stem cells. They can be or
[19:33] vine cells, you might say, right? It's
[19:35] almost like this this creative power
[19:37] like Jehovah incarnated into a little
[19:39] cell that can just be anything. It's the
[19:41] power of creative, you know, that life
[19:43] is coming out of this thing. And it's it
[19:45] can be anything. It could and it and it
[19:48] it's like a a wild card, right? You can
[19:50] it can once it gets to a certain point
[19:52] where they have this critical mass of
[19:53] stem cells then it can start
[19:54] differentiating into all the other
[19:56] tissue kind types and then once it'll
[19:58] branch off, right? That's why it's
[20:00] called a stem cell, right? It is the
[20:01] stem that then branches out into all the
[20:03] other different tissues. It's all the a
[20:07] stem cell is anything. It can be
[20:08] anything.
[20:10] And so the baby grows and it grows off
[20:13] of stem cells, right? It originates in
[20:15] stem cells and then it grows out in and
[20:17] you know grows a first little heart and
[20:19] then a nervous system and then you know
[20:21] fingers and toes and little toes to poke
[20:23] into mommy's ribs. Um and it, you know,
[20:26] grows all the bits of a baby and then
[20:28] it's a baby. Well,
[20:31] once the baby's born, it still has a
[20:33] massive load of stem cells that because
[20:36] it has to get bigger, right? It doesn't
[20:37] stay the size of a baby. It gets into
[20:39] grows into a fully grown adult. Well,
[20:40] how does that happen? Well, it's got a
[20:42] massive reserve of stem cells. This
[20:44] person, as they grow and get bigger,
[20:46] those that bigness has to come from
[20:48] somewhere, and it's growing from stem
[20:50] cells that are remaining in their body
[20:53] um until about 25 when the last of those
[20:56] stem cells turn into brain cells. Um
[20:59] this also consider the fact that brother
[21:01] Brandham said that you are gaining life
[21:04] until 25 and then you start dying. Isn't
[21:06] it funny that he was able to say that
[21:09] like way before the concept of stem
[21:11] cells and genetics were really
[21:12] understood? Crazy that. Um but here we
[21:17] have but but stem cells are like the the
[21:20] foundation for all of this. It is the
[21:21] the foundation for life and they can be
[21:24] anything. We've heard of things like
[21:25] stem cell therapy where they can inject
[21:26] people can donate stem cells. And they
[21:28] can maybe someone has a major injury
[21:30] like in a knee and you can inject stem
[21:31] cells into the knee and then that there
[21:34] are certain tissues that don't really
[21:36] regenerate, right? Like if you cut your
[21:38] arm and you have a hole in your flesh,
[21:40] well then your flesh cells around it
[21:42] multiply, right? And they fill the hole
[21:44] back in. Well, if you get a hole in your
[21:46] heart, doesn't exactly work that way.
[21:48] Heart cells don't reproduce. You don't
[21:49] make new heart cells. You don't make new
[21:51] brain cells, right? There are certain
[21:53] tissues that just don't regenerate. You
[21:55] got what you got. Yeah, once you're out
[21:57] of stem cells, that's it. It's why
[21:59] little kids can heal from things that
[22:01] are like an adult would never recover
[22:03] from, right? Little kid can have a major
[22:05] brain trauma and still recover from it
[22:07] and be more or less fine in a lot of
[22:09] cases because they have enough stem
[22:12] cells to reproduce tissue that would
[22:13] normally never reproduce. They would
[22:15] never get more of.
[22:19] Well,
[22:20] babies in the womb donate stem cells to
[22:23] mom. Amen. Right. So,
[22:27] there have been instances of moms who
[22:30] have had uh major heart problems like
[22:33] like myocarditis and things like that as
[22:36] a little kid and then always had heart
[22:39] problems until they got pregnant and
[22:40] then they resolved like that. Amen.
[22:42] Because that baby donated some of its
[22:44] creative the creative power that God put
[22:47] in that got donated to mom. Right. the
[22:51] they've done studies where the scars
[22:54] from C-sections
[22:56] have that baby's stem cells in it that
[22:59] the baby leaves stem cells for mom to
[23:02] heal after the pregnancy. They found it
[23:04] um in in brain tissue in um heart tissue
[23:08] in um at one point they did one study
[23:10] where there was a woman hadn't had a
[23:12] baby in 10 years had a heart attack 10
[23:15] years after her her child was born and
[23:17] that baby's stem cells were still in her
[23:19] body and healed her heart attack the
[23:22] damage from her heart attack. This is
[23:26] the reason why this is important is
[23:28] because we come into the world in
[23:30] through Satan's Eden, right? We come
[23:32] into the world broken. Our flesh is
[23:35] weak. Our spirits are weak. We have all
[23:37] this damage and destruction. And yet,
[23:40] when we take on that seed of God and let
[23:43] that grow inside of us, the process of
[23:45] birthing the word into the world will
[23:48] donate that creative power and will heal
[23:50] your body. It will heal your spirit. The
[23:53] things that the damage that you have for
[23:55] by the nature of your birth, right? The
[23:57] damage that you have because you were
[23:59] broken from birth can be resolved, can
[24:02] be healed by a by the power of the
[24:05] spoken word manifesting through your
[24:07] life. Okay. The dam the not just to your
[24:11] flesh but to your spirit. It is the same
[24:13] thing. If you have damage in your body,
[24:16] you have you have you need uh need
[24:18] healing. Well, then the word can
[24:19] manifest this the vine, right? The the
[24:23] Christ is the vine. And if he's living
[24:25] through you, then that stem cell will
[24:28] enter your life and and heal your body.
[24:30] If you have problems in your heart, in
[24:32] your soul, in your in your in your
[24:35] spirit, right? You have those memories
[24:36] that plague you from a past a past time
[24:39] in your life, God can heal the damage to
[24:41] those memories, right? If you have have
[24:44] uh problems in your reasoning, in your
[24:47] in your conscience, in these in these
[24:50] all these things that we struggle with,
[24:51] these faults and failures, as long as
[24:54] you keep manifesting the word in your
[24:56] life, the power, the creative power of
[24:59] God working through you will heal those
[25:02] problems. You will heal the damage.
[25:05] Okay? It will heal it. It heals the body
[25:08] as a whole, right? I mean, we look at
[25:10] the individual, the bride as
[25:12] individuals, but also the bride as a
[25:13] whole, right? Damage to the bride body
[25:16] of Christ globally where where churches
[25:18] have infighting and feuds. Well, if
[25:20] those churches
[25:22] manifest the word,
[25:24] that will heal. Yes. Okay. When when we
[25:29] have prodals who have left the word, you
[25:31] keep keep the word manifesting. Let the
[25:34] church come together as a body and focus
[25:36] on on being true to the word of God and
[25:39] that will resolve. Okay. The the spirit
[25:42] of go, the creative power will will
[25:44] bring those people back. The bride as a
[25:47] whole can heal any wound, right? both on
[25:51] the individual and on on the church
[25:53] level when there's um uh you know
[25:56] problems any you know what I guess you
[25:59] know I'm out of time but I'll I'll just
[26:01] finish and say this
[26:04] the the if you have problems I've and
[26:06] I've man I've experienced it firsthand
[26:08] whether it's health problems or finance
[26:10] problems or marriage problems or
[26:13] whatever the problems you're having are
[26:16] if your first step is Lord I'm going to
[26:19] draw closer to you that I can see the
[26:21] problems in my own self and I'm going to
[26:23] draw closer to you. You would be shocked
[26:25] how many things just fix just
[26:28] miraculously the issue just disappears
[26:32] because you draw drew closer to the
[26:33] Lord, right? You just pull on the word,
[26:37] find just draw closer to God and build
[26:40] the relationship with God and you don't
[26:42] have to do anything and it just problems
[26:44] start falling away. Amen. The mom whose
[26:48] heart is repaired with stem cells from
[26:50] her baby doesn't have to go through a,
[26:53] you know, a program or go to a seminar
[26:56] to activate those stem cells. She just
[26:59] manifest the baby and it just happens.
[27:04] Okay, I'm out of time. Let's stand and
[27:06] have a word of prayer.
[27:11] Lord,
[27:15] we thank you for this time that we've
[27:16] had this morning. Hope that something
[27:18] that was said would touch the heart of
[27:21] the people. Lord, that give some someone
[27:23] courage, some encouragement, Lord. That
[27:25] this time of great shaking, time of that
[27:29] would shake people's faith. This time
[27:31] that would discourage people that Lord,
[27:33] we'd have the boldness to stand on your
[27:35] word, Lord, and move forward. that we
[27:37] wouldn't be um distracted by things of
[27:41] the world, distracted by,
[27:43] Father, the the the the lies that the
[27:46] devil would try to tell us, Lord. But we
[27:48] we ask that you would keep us close to
[27:50] you and be with us as we go through our
[27:53] lives, Lord. We thank you for this in
[27:57] Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
