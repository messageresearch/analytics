don't know if we're we're off the stream or if we're we're good but those listening in we're just having an online only service because of the the construction that's going on and laying of the concrete that was done today so things will be back to normal uh as far as service wise and so forth um I think with the with the bathroom situation as well we'll be back to normal on on Sunday so we're very thankful what the Lord is doing for us and we're walking with the Lord step by step by faith and he's our great provider we Look to Him in all things so my goodness I'm I'm so blessed by the song service tonight I'm ready for a concert with these two uh voices just brought into the presence of the Lord Lord and so thankful when you can come to the pulpit and and you don't have to labor through Thee the Lord is standing right here we appreciate that and I don't know if you got that PowerPoint up brother Brad but we're going to go directly to the word so thankful to have all the Watkins back you all had a wonderful time together as a family we missed you and glad you hurried back so continuing uh brother Jason asked me to continue on the topic that I was covering on Sunday overcoming depression we'll uh read the verse and then our musicians can find their seats Proverbs 12:25 anxiety in the heart of man causes depression but a good word makes it glad amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can find your seats amen we are we're living in an hour and in an age as we talked about on Sunday where this modern Viewpoint of psychology is all pervasive it's everywhere it's it's in entertainment it's it's on the news it's in social media it's on it's taught on Tik Tik Tok uh schools are dedicating new um new positions in every school for a psychologist and it used to be when I was a a kid your school counselor just said what do you want to do okay I want to play sports this is what you need to do all right so now but now it's not that you are licensed psychologist and licensed counselors and social workers who are also trained in Psychology this picture is all pervasive from the time kids are in kindergarten and a and even to the point where their basis and their desire is to undermine the family and as you begin to study and look at this uh psychology it's a uh it's an ultra piece of feminism directly connected to the feministic spirit that's per permeating this age and so I want to speak about I want to combat that spirit because it is all pervasive to the point where many times we don't even recognize what's going on or what's what's happening um many many popular modern preachers oh they say we love his preaching it's just so relevant they're nothing more than a psychologist who is anointing their psychology with Biblical verses and ideas and terminology and so it's it's everywhere it's in the music industry po popular music it's in public schools it's new news media it's in the modern Pulpit it's almost to the point where it we don't even recognize it it's so all consuming and so as we read in the Bible it the Bible gives us an outline anxiety causes depression but a good word Mak makes it glad that's simple that's simple the Bible gives an outline for mental emotional spiritual and even physical healing to come to us the power of the Gospel is sent to us to bring healing and to transform us to have the mind of Christ amen in fact the New Covenant is that he gives us a new nature we were dead in sin and trespasses and now he's quickened us we're Made Alive together with Christ it's not a mere well just have a change of mind if we want to look at and think about psychology is they're simply trying to change your mind in order to bring healing we understand even even uh brother Don's sermon last week was a good precursor to that is they the devil will put a clog in those five channels of your mind and and and that clog will result in unbelief but the gospel uh comes to bring transformation it gives us a Ministry of the Holy Ghost every every one of us as Believers has a Ministry in the Holy Ghost you're given the Holy Ghost to profit with all or for the common good so each one has a gifting to bring a blessing to others so the Holy Ghost turns the focus from me to him and others I'm living to be a blessing to others it's teaching us to live unselfishly with true agape love and to help others be blessed to be healed and to feel the love of Christ as it comes forth from us it's also gives us an ongoing remedy as we talked about last service to combat anxiety that leads to depression it g it also gives us a community of people who are interested in loving and healing others in Christ it gives us elders and ministers that can counsel us by the word of God biblical counseling is not psychology amen if you can understand it correctly we're preaching the word of God to you here as a group counseling is simply applying the word of God in a very specific way here we're applying the word of God by preaching in counseling we simply apply the word of God to the life situation where there's a struggle and and uh counseling biblical counseling through a pastor through through the ministry is an important part of the local church but it is its approach functionally is not psychology its approach is bringing someone under submission to the will of God or let's put it this way perhaps the person is struggling to understand why the word is not having an effect in their life and it is due to a particular circumstance in their life of Disobedience and so the counseling is to point to the word so that repentance takes place or to a change of mind takes place so that health and healing and wholeness can be there in the human being and as we spoke about before I just I just want to go briefly into this because we laid the foundation on Sunday psycholog modern psychology and the modern philosophy about life is that everything is about being happy wow and so they seek after happiness as an end in itself this is what everyone's taught this this is what everyone goes for this is what psychologists are pointing to not only is what psychologists are pointing to it's it is what schools are pointing to and it's what parenting is pointing to and when you're pointing to that you're missing the mark entirely because God didn't design us to seek happiness for the sake of Happiness what what is what does Solomon tell us Solomon has access to all the pleasures of life he goes after everything he goes after study to be the greatest doctor of every every kind of knowledge what does he find out vanity vexation of spirit seeking that as an end in itself to find meaning you'll die seeking physical Pleasures as an ending of itself is Vanity of vanities it's meaningless and we we go on we go on and on what does he come to in the end and what he realizes and that's why I see that Solomon he repented at the end of his life in his old age amen but what did he what did he come to what is what is the the the purpose of man it's to fear God and to keep his Commandments this is the whole man in our translations it says the whole duty of man but we talked about it means the whole man this is the whole man this is what Man was created and designed for this is his purpose he'll never be happy he'll never find Joy he'll never find real meaning until he finds what makes him whole and that's fearing God and keeping his Commandments and we further know based on the New Covenant that he made with us that it's only by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that we can truly fear God and keep his Commandments because that is where he writes the word in our heart and in our mind so that we can live that word so it's that's the only satisfying portion that man can find regardless of his circumstances regardless of the scenario regardless of what it is that is what our purpose in life is for if you want to be a whole man or woman you must fear God and keep his Commandments and you have to know how that comes you you you can't approach it by your own works we understand how that comes based on the New Testament and the teaching of this message but in psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior psychologists are actively involved in studying and understanding mental processes brain functions and behavior the foundation of our world's Psychology today is a mixture of atheistic evolutionary feminist and Marxist thought that at its core Rejects and despises a Biblical worldview and the power of God unto salvation at its very core it's a misdiagnosis and the wrong prognosis and leaves people in the position of having no hope outside of themselves amen unless psychology understanding the mind and behavior is directed by the Bible and has at its core biblical Redemption by the power of God it is by its nature antagonistic towards healing and deliverance true healing in Deliverance as a minister of the Gospel I have to remember how the mind of man works but to divorce that from the Bible or to try to amalgamate modern psychology with Biblical thought is a horrible error amen and at its core it stagnates and removes people from the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ let's look at Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen so psychology wants to conform us to a way of look looking at the world looking at life looking at the situations that we faced in in life but the gospel has come to transform us that word is literally transfigure that's the same word that's used for Jesus on Mount of transfiguration we are to be transfigured transformed by the renewing of our mind in other words what is the what is the aim and what is the goal amen it's the image of Jesus Christ we are to be a perfect reflection of Jesus Christ that's why we receive the Holy Ghost we receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost has a purpose that's to make us like Jesus Christ and so how are you going to get there it's by the renewing of your mind amen renewing of your mind towards what the mind of Christ what is that the word so how do we how do we have a renewing of the Mind it's by the revelation of the word through the Holy Spirit to us as individuals then through that we can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God but what does it start with asserting our self will asserting what we want in our life finding what makes us happy verse before that tells us exactly what it is present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is a reasonable service you it's a it's a total surrender to the purpose plan and will of God it's laying aside any goal that I have it's laying aside any plan that I have it's a lady assy any purpose I have and saying God I just want your will I want to be led by you I don't care what this world has to offer I only want you and and so that's how it starts it doesn't start by saying you know I really want to find a way to become very happy brother Luther no the the the place is the transformation comes and starts with offering your body amen offering your entire being to him on the Altar and saying I you can't take it back when you bring your lamb to the temple you don't bring it there and say well that was idea but you didn't do a sacrifice you didn't offer a sacrifice you changed your mind when you offer the sacrifice you give it to the priest wow amen and he takes care of the rest and so that's what we have to do we offer it to the Lord Jesus and we don't take it back we don't try to bring pick it up again we give it to him many of our problems this is that we Face many of our mental problems that we face and struggles and trials it's because we we want to pick it up yeah we want to pick it up we don't want to lay it down and leave it there amen 2 Corinthians 10 verse 3-5 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh amen so again if we approach the battles that we face in our mind on the fleshly level we're not even we don't we don't even know where the war is yeah amen if we're just approaching it as well I want to reform myself you can many people do they they they they go to AA they they go to a psychologist and they learn how to reform themselves but that isn't what we're talking about here amen that isn't what the gospel is I have no problem with someone reforming themselves trying to make themselves a better life but you're Mi as a Christian you're missing the mark and you're you're in danger of making someone else your lord and savior I uh you know it it's we we look to the Lord the Lord is our strength and we look to what he has provided and so we can't we can't look at this battle that we're facing of life as merely a fleshly battle that we can win on a fleshly level or a mental level because we're not Waring after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not fleshly but they're Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity most of our thoughts to The Obedience of Christ every thought to The Obedience of Christ and so if if it's a thought of anxiety if it's if it's a thought of fear if it's a spirit of depression trying to come upon you we have to bring every thought into that captivity amen we have to take it captive right that's that's a now we have political Wars and it's all everything's all messed up but in the past you did two things you either killed your enemy completely or you killed him and took him into captivity that's all you did so here here the purpose is every thought now must be captive to The Obedience of Christ so that in other words we're thinking the mind of Christ we're thinking his thoughts we're thinking word thoughts every situation every circumstance that we approach we're not thinking humanly speaking and approaching the situation humanly we're thinking about it with the mind of Christ and with the attitude and heart of Christ and every thought and there's a lot of thoughts that exalt themselves against the knowledge of God what we talked about before what is that how does the the devil talk to you he doesn't send a text message sometimes he does but not directly what does he do when he deals with you directly what is he doing he's getting to your mind amen and it comes as a thought in your mind and so then we have to every thought that comes we have to say is this of God or is this of the devil is the devil speaking or is God trying to deal with me right and so when we when those thoughts come we have to know which which one it is and cast down the ones that are from the enemy amen that's right Amen in the sermon the angel of God brother brandham says I will grant you this it is psychology in this way Psy I of course means mind and it's the mind of Christ and the human being has the privilege to enter in and know the mind of Christ Hallelujah my what a reality to dwell in the channel of Christ we unworthy Mortals have been brought in to be Sons and Daughters of God to be fellow citizens amen amen amen so the the the real psyche is having the mind of Christ and and that only comes by a supernatural birth we know that you cannot figure out the mind of Christ amen it's not an algorithm it's a supernatural experience that you walk in day by day by day amen and that's the important part to remember is psychology is offering you a natural means to try to heal what is its background worldview and what is it aiming at amen what is the word aiming at the word the word is aiming at your total health wow physical spiritual and at the soul level but it doesn't come he's not coming from the outside in that's what psychology is doing outside in approach but the word comes from the inside out amen it's it's coming by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to transform your nature in your soul so that nature is God so that you are being molded and shaped into the mind of Christ in Maya the prophet brother bam says we'll never be able to convert the World by trying to shine up our churches and make them bigger and polish up our ministers with better education they already got all that stuff they got all kinds of psychology and ball games and everything the world has got that but we got something they haven't got that's Christ amen try just stay in your own territory we got Christ they don't have Christ they got all the psychology don't try to match W them with wits you can't do it they don't they they can outmatch you just once more Lord now we got seminaries that hatch out our min ministers and we're building bigger ones all the time and we got students of psychology and that's all right if you want to teach psychology but I don't care about psychology I just want to know Jesus Christ that's all I want to know is him amen now psychology tries to explain and categorize human behavior as such it's directly affected by the worldview that stands behind that theory we have to understand that is people are trying to heal your mind they're trying to offer all kinds of things to heal your mind and we say we say well away with psychology in one in one sense people are handling it and saying we don't need counseling we just need uh preaching we don't need uh you know to talk we just need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that solves everything well you you have to have the word in the right balance amen amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just your starting process as a Christian you you you have the mind of Christ at an infant level right you have to grow into it he gives us the word he gives us life experiences that causes us to grow into it sometimes we get to a place brother Bram was a holy ghost filled Christian got to the place where he wanted to take his own life yeah amen okay you can get to a place where you have complexes and it's by the preaching of the word but also by personal application of the word look we have we have we're friends with one another we have friends and we can talk to each other we have a pastor we as the body of Christ need to be tools in the hands of the Lord to help heal one another all of us will find oursel in a situation where we have where our mind is all gummed up amen and we're struggling and I think the I think the point I'm trying to make is be in be in balanced about it if we preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost in such a way to make you think that you'll never have a problem again in your life we've really missed the mark amen but if we if we preach on uh dealing with your mind and H how to go through problems without getting you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're just trying to treat the outside symptom again we're coming from the outside in we got to go from the inside out amen but but really realize that there's times and I could speak of my own experiences that you're all messed up and you're thinking about people and situations and you go talk to a brother and he says what yeah you're think what the scripture says this and this and you go I'm such a dummy I was thinking I was just thinking I was stuck in my thoughts all that time about that and I wasn't even looking at it right see and we can that's healing yes amen that's that's that's amen that's friend biblical friendship you know better are the wounds of the I don't forget how the scripture goes but better are the wounds of a friend yeah and the the kisses of an enemy something like that you know people will people will flatter you from a distance but yet your friend is the one that knows you and could say w what's going on here I'm not sure that you're looking at this situation the right way and that's we need each other for that we all get to that place and and and the thing is that you know the world wants to replace that with a a psychologist and a social worker and and maybe that's okay maybe somebody has to do that but the reality is that they can't do what if I just would talk to my wife about the situation what my wife could do or what my friend could do they can't there's a relationship there there's a friendship there maybe there's a little joke that can go forward and lightens things up that would bring healing you see there there's so many things that we miss but the devil wants when there's a spirit of depression the devil will bring you to the place where you just isolate yourself from everybody amen that's right or or you get these thoughts of anxiety and we you pet them and baby them and pet yourself and baby yourself and encourage yourself I'm just you know I'm just an anxious person again uh all these mental illnesses that they've codified today is I doubt that they're even real because the reality is many of them are just identifying a devil and then people are accepting a devil anointing upon their mind amen and I just I personally like to say I'm an overcomer God I'm not an anxious person I'm an overcomer I've got Wars and battles but I'm day by day defeating the enemy every day that I wake up and keep walking with God I'm defeating the enemy once again amen and so this extreme the the the the world's Theory and approach to this is painted by the world's system and it's an antichrist and anti- mentality and we as as Believers need to un understand the big picture not only with what the world's pushing on us with psychology but also how we can be tool in the hands of the Lord to heal one another it can also it can be it can be uh even dangerous to to sometimes you're preaching so hard against psychology and people start to think I can't talk to anybody I'm struggling in my mind I can't talk to anybody that's not what is being said over the pulpit right now I I what I'm what I'm saying the opposite is we God has given us the tools there's people right here if somebody's struggling that will help you get healed and get free they'll just listen to you and point you to the scripture amen don't just sit there and struggle and fight and fume and fuss when you have a pastor that'd be more than willing to talk to you and other ministers that would and brothers and sisters that would just sit and listen to you say I need to talk we have to realize that we we all struggle and we all face difficulties and that we're all here for each other amen I think I just want I want to get this out and then move on to my next St I think what we have right now in this prevailing Theory especially amongst the Young Generation is that well this Behavior comes as a result of a trauma response from childhood and people talk and say well I'm triggered by certain things that I encounter this then then this creates a behavior chain resulting from past experiences is there a truth to that sure sure it is but don't that you you go looking under every Rock for that you're going to find it amen as we talked about before that understanding and approach to psychology lead leads to a permanent victim mentality it helps nothing it improves nothing and it makes a bunch of soft people that are not able to function in life in a normal way they're not able to go to a job they need mental health breaks because someone told them they did something wrong at the job they can't stand correction they're bastard children even though they grew up with a mom and dad in their home cuz their mom and dad don't want to correct them because what what's going to happen oh if we if we're hard on them they'll have a mental trauma and they'll get older and and they'll blame it on us that you know what if they're a real if you raise them right they'll stay in the way that they go and they'll praise God for a mom and a dad that spanked them am the Bible and we'll look at the scriptures but the Bible never allows us to blame our behavior and our responses on other people we are responsible in his sight for our choice choices and for our own behavior and definitely trauma response can be helpful in understanding some root causes brother brandham talks about it in some of his discernment lines even some behaviors some behaviors but we can't explain everything and explain it away and give ourselves an excuse of why we can't be healed you think about it these young people have been raised more gently than any generation in history and they have the most hatred for their parents and they don't want to have children of their own it's because of the root problem of this feministic ly livered psychological trauma response approach to raising children and that we've given to our own selves and again I said before I'm sure there are social workers that have helped people help people change their minds that's good I never want to take away any kind of help that a person could have but if it's pointing people away from Christ and pointing them towards some pathetic weak uh thing that keeps them as a victim ultimately what is it Satan has created this atmosphere of psychology upon the people's minds to keep them him standing under he's standing on top of them that's what he's doing he's got his foot over their head and that's all that they know to do I'm a victim I'm a I'm a victim you we have to realize the system of training and approaching life around this world has caused almost irreparable damage to the point that the nation must perish amen and it has produced a generation of people that is the most depressed people people in the history of this nation brother Bram said it was a neurotic age and brother branham's time people struggled with anxiety not even depression as we talked about before the statistics show almost no one was depressed in America in the 50s and 60s but they were anxious now everyone is anxious and 15 to 25% of people are have major depressive disorder so could it be that the system that's training people's minds is wrong yes of course that's what it is it's not according to the Bible and it corresponds directly with when they kicked the Bible out of the school and put the psychologist in the Bible's place and it's crippled them to the point where all they think about is their own happiness they're they're taught and encourage encouraged by their school and by their parents seek you got to you got to be happy come on and everything's telling them find find happiness that's the real meaning of life is being happy and then what do they give them as the means to be happy well this person hurt my feelings and now I can't do that anymore because I'm traumatized by it so not only does the devil see have them seeking after something that is actually like a vapor that you can't even grab hold of even as Christians we can't live like that saying I'm seeking after what's making happy uh seeking after something that's that that's happy happiness is like a vapor you can't grab a hold of it how many times are you happy during a day I don't know the more you think about it the less happy you'll be I promise you instead they encourage people to ruminate over the people that have hurt them person that's done me wrong this one this one hurt my feelings my my mom spanked me now I I won't be able to function as a as a good adult because I'm traumatized by this correction that I received by this crazy monster that's what they think and when I was young my my mom said this and I was a teenager my dad did this and uh I'm unhappy and my life is ruined because of it look everyone goes through struggles and trials yes amen you will be miserable if you're trying to avoid struggles and trials you young men you have to be challenged you have to do hard and difficult things all of us and if you don't you will be unhappy amen that's that's part of the problem in America we have everything so easy we're unhappy all the time but again it's seeking after the wind and reaping the Whirlwind is what this nation has done and they're ending up in the beginning of Ecclesiastes vanity of vanities all is Vanity and they want to take their own life thinking about our problems does not solve them amen true thinking about the thoughts that we have and ruminating about our past and the troubles and trials that we had doesn't bring healing amen it makes you worse it it doesn't improve the situation it makes it worse not only that the Bible tells us not to do that am the Bible tells us to to think on good things think on positive things think on the testimonies that God has given you think about the good things that God has provided you think about the word what the word says there are times of course we talked about it sometimes you need to talk about what you're going through sometimes you don't you just need to move on amen amen sometimes talking too much about it makes you fixated on it sometimes it's just just move on Commit it to God it happened it hurt let's move on with God we love him he's a Healer and the thing is what you're so we become so focused on self that we miss what actually God wants to use us for what we need today this is from the identified Masterpiece of God what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us that's what purifies not the outward turned around collar or degree of psychology or something it takes the power of the resurrected Christ to make us what we should be God has no other plan than let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church amen that is the plan that is the purpose of God if we want that's what he wants to do through us right he doesn't want us thinking about past hurts and past pains if you need if you're keep thinking about it go talk to someone that can help set you straight and move forward Satan has so deceived this world their total focus is inward amen the whole focus of the mind and the heart is selfish selfish and self-centered they're taught don't judge how you feel your feelings are the absolute they're your final Authority follow your feelings what a Madness what a danger you have to understand why you feel the way you feel you have to keep keep coming back to these same thoughts over and over again and and you know your therapists will treat you they'll give you they'll talk to you for a fee every week and they'll get you the medication that you need for all this of course I know people struggle I know people face difficulties I do I face sorrow I face sadness but it's a h it's a how we approach it that dictates whether we heal or whether we become victims Perpetual victims that's what our young people today that's gen gen Z gen Alpha they are they are being trained and taught to be Perpetual victims and fact they're they protest for the atrocity atrocities of Hamas not knowing what they're protesting for but they find meaning in this self-centered crazy mindless approach to I don't even know what they're doing Madness they they they would step one foot in Gaza Strip they would they're not talking about that they have no idea what they're talking about or what they're dealing with or what they're doing am they're just victims and anyone else that's a victim they identify with that victimhood wow how about we do what Jesus said to do and that we get our eyes off of oursel and get our eyes on him and serving others that's the that's the approach that we need to take he didn't many times Christians struggle because they think being a Christian is coming to church and sitting in a Pew you are supposed to be active you are supposed to be serving others you are supposed to be looking for people to help heal and if you just sit on your hands and listen to preaching that's all you ever do and and sing the songs and don't put your faith into action in serving others amen you will get stuck in the self centered cycle we have to get off of that Philippians 4:6 I'm going to read from the NLT don't worry about anything instead pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done as we talked about before you're exercising the very same thing just which direction are you going towards Satan or God when we when we think about something a situation and we begin to worry and we think about all the possibilities of what can go wrong our our we're we're exercising faith in what Satan is speaking to us and we'll be conformed to that way of thinking good instead instead of worrying in because that's ex again that's exercising faith in the word of Satan instead pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done not only for all that he's done but all that he's going to do because if he's made a promise you've identified that promise you've prayed about it he's under obligation to fulfill it for you then you will experience God's peace which exceeds anything we can understand did you see that then that's a connection that means this verse is connected to the that verse if you do this then this will follow if you do this don't worry about anything instead pray about everything tell God what you need thank him for all he's done then you will experience God's peace it's a perfect formula from the word we want peace Philippians 4:6 follow that and you'll receive the peace that exceeds anything we can understand his peace will guard your hearts and Minds as you live in Christ Jesus and now dear brothers and sisters one final thing fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admir able think about those things that are excellent and worthy of Praise so Paul is telling you what you must think about amen it's not just what you have to do he's telling this is how if you want peace then you have to think about these things if you think about worry fear anxiety it is going to produce unbelief it's not going to produce Faith so if you if you want peace follow what Paul is telling you to do he reiterates it even further keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me everything you heard from me and saw me doing then he used that word again then then the God of Peace will be with you this is amazing to me look at this verse Paul is telling them put into practice what I've taught you and the example that I've left to you then you'll have peace amen we think if I just pray hard enough I'll have peace well there's a connection to that but it's not just that it's what you think about if you pray and then worry worry worry worry worry worry worry you're not doing what the word is saying to do you pray you give thanks to God you commit it to him then you then you then you say Lord help me instead of going back to the worry help me to think about the things that's pleasing to you that you've told me to think about and then we have to go further and realize that if we're not walking in obedience to the Vindicated word of the hour then we can't expect to experience peace in our life if our life is budding up against what the word says and saying no no no no I I'll go this far but not that far we can't expect to experience peace in our life it it has to be a full surrender to the word to do to do what the Apostle taught us to do not not in part not with our own thinking but a fully surrendered life to him then the peace that passes that goes beyond all circumstances will follow once again I'm going to have another part to this let me skip ahead a little bit to where I can finish again as we started you can never do any of this without the power of God by the holy ghost in your life that's the prerequisite get the baptism of the Holy Ghost have a true and genuine experience with God so that you know that you know that you know that you have it without question I have received the Holy Ghost and I'm a new man I'm changed but then now we're set free now we're set free now we're not in bondage to sin anymore but it we have to let Faith have control amen we can let worry and fear and we can get all kinds of complexes built up in our mind or we can let go of it all and let God be in control no doubt every one of us has experienced things that have hurt us that have frustrated us that we could fixate on and say I'm leaving everything but there's something if you got the Holy Ghost your predestinated seat of God there's something on the inside of the inside that's pushing you forward despite despite your better judgment as brother brandham said you're you're going forward with God and you're saying I don't know what happened and I don't know why it happened but God allowed it to happen and I trust him and I love him and I'm walking forward so that faith can be that controlling thought pattern and your living and doing the word regardless all right so I want to just in clo in closing just a few more minutes talk about some of the steps of doing the word I think this is important because the Bible does clearly give us a process for holess and when we have when there's a a a struggle and a sickness in your mind and again in all that I've said I'm not detracting from the fact that there are struggles by any means Amen brother brand had them I have them you have them we all know that we're not so super spiritual with Halos on our heads that we don't realize that our our thoughts can get messed up and mixed up and we can struggle and get frustrated and really if if if we understand it's all on us and we have to understand that it is on us to control how we think about things am and what we let control us cuz those thoughts can control control you and stop you from doing what doing the word living the word so what are some steps of doing the word if you're struggling if you're having trials if you're facing difficulties if you're stuck up in your mind that you just can't let go of something talk to your pastor or someone that you trust in the body of Christ talking through the depression can often lead a person to discover wrong ways of thinking unrepented of sin or just help them be released from the pain that they have by talking to someone that cares I've seen it many times in counseling people just listening I didn't say a word almost the whole time and I just listened and I and I could feel what they were going through and at the end I I gave them just a little scripture and prayed with them oh my I'm just the Lord has healed me I I feel like I've just been totally released from this thing thank you so much for everything you did I didn't do anything the Lord did it amise the Lord and you just talk to someone that cared that's what we need to be as a part of the body of Christ people that care you any of us if you care you can be a means of healing for someone amen act in obedience to God's word no matter the circumstances act in obedience to the word the devil's going to try to push you away from doing that wake up in the morning spend time in prayer reading the Bible listening to the message before you go to sleep pray read the Bible do the same thing amen attend every church service and bible study and prayer meeting the Church offers talk to and fellowship with like-minded believers this is on the carnal level but it has its impact everywhere exercise your body drink water eat healthy right amen as brother John Andy says drink water brother that's true many times we become dehydrated and it impacts on all of our health these things are carnal but they do all of them it has an impact on the whole person resolve conflicts quickly as best as you can deal with people that wrong you directly not in Gossip or behind their backs playing the blame game go directly to your brother or sister and speak to them and get it resolved many times a person facing depression it's coming because they've not resolved the conflicts that they have and they've hold on to something instead of doing what the word says and it's maybe it's very uncomfortable to do but it's what the word says Matthew 18 doesn't say go and gossip go tell your therapist about how horrible this person is it says go and deal with them directly many times we Face mental struggles and trials because we're not doing the word if we just did what the word said to do it would we wouldn't even get sick in our minds all right start do musicians if you come we talked about this before but I think it's important start doing something to serve others we get so focused on oursel take the focus off of yourself and put it on others when God deals with you and heals you from something many times that's the very thing that God will use you to help others with amen and as we talked about control your thought Life by the power of the Holy Ghost speak to yourself with scriptural patterns of thought not with demonic lies and patterns from your past and the ways that the world teaches you to nurture your feelings think the with the mind of Christ again what is the devil's purpose when the devil has created this system of the world in this program he wants to have victory over the Saints yes he wants us defeated and he wants us living defeated so that we're it's a powerless bride we can't we we can't be in that situation in that circumstance and it's going to the greatest battle ever fought where is it fought between your ears between your ears but we have to remember it takes that soul in full surrender to the word as the control tower controlling over the mind the devil chose your mind chose the ma the mind of man as his Battlegrounds God chose the heart and that's heart that that is the place by the Holy Ghost where we can then be Overcomers and control amen how we think what we think about and what we're feeding on because ultimately it has to be word thoughts word on top of word lined in our soul so that we're expressing expressing the full manifestation of Jesus Christ amen let's pray Heavenly Father we come to you now Lord and we ask that your presence would be with us Lord we ask that you would just continue to move and work in our lives Lord anyone here anyone listening in on the stream or the recording Lord I pray that you'd move in their heart if they're struggling and facing difficulties Lord just you are that balm that's in Gilead you are that healing
