[0:50] [Music]
[0:56] so
[1:00] [Music]
[1:27] good morning everyone god bless you
[1:30] let's stand and pray
[1:35] heavenly father we love you we're so
[1:38] thankful for your mercy and grace lord
[1:40] we know
[1:42] we know the wickedness
[1:46] of our own sin lord even even today
[1:50] even even at the same time you tell
[1:54] us that we're washed in the blood of
[1:55] christ
[1:57] and that we're cleansed that we never
[1:59] even did it in the first place lord we
[2:01] yet we know we know in our hearts that
[2:04] we
[2:06] often make mistakes and we fail
[2:10] and yet lord you pick us up you you draw
[2:13] us
[2:13] further and closer lord you give us a
[2:16] heart
[2:17] to repent i believe that's the zeal of
[2:20] this
[2:21] seventh church age be zealous therefore
[2:24] and repent
[2:26] and so lord i think it was luther that
[2:29] said the christian life is a life of
[2:31] repentance
[2:33] and so lord we just want our hearts to
[2:35] be right with you
[2:37] we want our minds to be right with you
[2:40] and we just want to experience the
[2:42] the cleansing of the washing of water of
[2:45] the word lord just cleanse our hearts
[2:47] and minds and
[2:48] make us more in the image of jesus
[2:51] christ that's why we're still here
[2:52] that's why the rapture has it takes
[2:54] taken place you're making us more like
[2:57] him
[2:58] so we just commit ourselves to you we
[3:00] ask that the holy spirit would come
[3:02] take this word and break it open to our
[3:04] hearts
[3:05] lord anoint the speaker anoint the here
[3:09] and you be glorified in jesus name amen
[3:13] i'm going to continue on the subject of
[3:16] christian character this will be part 8
[3:19] and we're continuing to look at love
[3:22] we're going to continue on that from
[3:24] that subject i'm going to do a quick
[3:25] review
[3:26] to start it off and then we'll go
[3:28] further than we
[3:30] did last time the opening scriptures
[3:32] romans 12
[3:35] 9 and 10.
[3:39] let agape love
[3:42] be without dissimulation abhor
[3:46] that which is evil cleave to that which
[3:48] is good
[3:50] be kindly affectioned this word
[3:54] kindly affection is phyllostorgos
[3:57] it's a combination of
[4:01] brotherly love filo or friendship love
[4:04] and store ghost which is family love
[4:08] one to another with brotherly love
[4:12] so philadelphia in honor preferring one
[4:15] another
[4:16] may the lord have the blessing to the
[4:18] reading of his word he can be seated
[4:21] so we mentioned it before but agape love
[4:24] from the strong's concordance says
[4:28] agape is wider embracing especially the
[4:31] judgment and the deliberate ascent
[4:33] of the will as a matter of principle
[4:36] duty
[4:36] and propriety
[4:40] filio love uh
[4:43] from strong's concordance says to be a
[4:45] friend to
[4:47] fond of an individual or an object have
[4:50] an affection
[4:51] denoting personal attachment as a matter
[4:53] of sentiment or feeling
[4:55] embracing especially the judgment and
[4:57] the deliberate ascent of the will as a
[4:59] matter of principle duty and propriety
[5:02] so it's similar to agape
[5:05] but it's a little different in that
[5:09] filio love is looking at it from the
[5:11] aspect of friendship
[5:13] agape love is looking at it as this is
[5:16] how we treat everyone
[5:17] whether if there's a connection through
[5:20] the body of christ or through family or
[5:21] whatever it might be
[5:23] whether there's no connection in fact
[5:24] there's enmity from one party towards
[5:26] you
[5:27] agape love still needs to rule
[5:30] first thessalonians 4 9
[5:34] and 10 but as touching brotherly love
[5:38] that's philadelphia
[5:40] you need not that i write unto you for
[5:42] ye yourselves are taught of god
[5:45] to agape one another and indeed you do
[5:48] it toward all the brethren which are in
[5:50] all macedonia
[5:51] but we beseech you brethren that you
[5:53] increase more
[5:54] and more so you see again philadelphia
[5:57] filio love
[5:58] and agape love are closely connected
[6:01] together
[6:02] i i would put it like this agape love
[6:06] actually completes filial love you can
[6:09] have one without the other
[6:11] and uh and you can have agape love for
[6:14] someone
[6:15] without having that friendship or
[6:18] affection
[6:19] between each other and if they hate you
[6:21] you agape them
[6:22] but if they're your buddy like brother
[6:25] luther
[6:26] brother you have filio love and agape
[6:28] love both together
[6:30] you need to have it so those things are
[6:34] kind of the foundational aspect
[6:37] proverbs 17 verse 17.
[6:41] and again we're kind of looking more so
[6:43] at filio love at
[6:45] what i would say at biblical friendship
[6:48] proverbs 17 verse 17 says this a friend
[6:51] that loves at all times
[6:54] and a brother is born for
[6:57] adversity let's think about this verse
[6:59] for a second
[7:00] a friend stands with you in good times
[7:03] and bad times
[7:05] but a brother he doesn't always stand
[7:08] with you in
[7:08] in good times but when there's adversity
[7:12] your brother will stand up and step up
[7:15] and stand with you
[7:16] so again this is talking about
[7:18] friendship versus a family
[7:20] relationship and and of course proverbs
[7:24] is this is an
[7:25] absolute you know you have you could
[7:26] have a brother that stands with you at
[7:28] all times
[7:29] right um it's this is principles
[7:32] you know you'll have that's why you'll
[7:34] have in the book of proverbs
[7:35] one verse it says one thing the next
[7:37] verse it says the exact opposite
[7:39] both are true it just depends on the
[7:40] circumstances in the situation that
[7:42] you're
[7:43] you find yourself in a friend loves you
[7:46] in
[7:46] an adversity a true friend he could be
[7:49] your brother too
[7:51] a true friend loves you when there's
[7:53] adversity
[7:54] and he loves you when the times are good
[7:56] he doesn't just love you when the times
[7:58] are good
[7:58] job had some friends like that didn't he
[8:01] and then
[8:02] then accuse him and fight against him
[8:04] when the times are bad
[8:07] which is the next verse we have job 19
[8:10] verse 14.
[8:15] brother branham talks about this he says
[8:17] sometimes
[8:18] the lord will allow everyone to turn
[8:20] against you
[8:21] because he wants to see how you respond
[8:23] how how you react
[8:25] he wants to see where your faith and
[8:27] confidence is fully
[8:29] put job had that happened to him my kin
[8:32] folks have failed
[8:34] his family's failed him my familiar
[8:36] friends have forgotten me
[8:39] so there's times where
[8:42] you really find out who your friends are
[8:45] you really find out who stands with you
[8:48] and it hurts
[8:49] it's painful when you find out your
[8:51] friends ain't your friends
[8:53] but that's okay that's okay as
[8:55] christians we say okay
[8:56] we forgive you and we move along because
[8:59] we have a friend that will never fail us
[9:02] will never leave us never forsake us our
[9:04] lord jesus christ
[9:06] brother branham says this in october
[9:09] 1958 lifting him up out of history
[9:14] it seems like that that real family love
[9:17] don't exist much more just something has
[9:20] happened home life is running out we
[9:22] don't have the old american home as we
[9:24] used to have it long years ago
[9:26] there's another thing i would like to
[9:28] say that is another thing running out
[9:30] is friendship is running out it don't
[9:32] seem like that we have the friends as we
[9:34] used to have
[9:36] and the friends that we have are not
[9:38] loyal friends
[9:39] like used to be it used to be i can
[9:41] remember when someone got sick in the
[9:43] neighborhood
[9:44] that everybody come around and they
[9:46] helped them with all their work and
[9:47] lended a hand to anything could be done
[9:50] set up with them all night at a time as
[9:52] i've often said it's the truth that we
[9:53] hardly know the neighbor is dead
[9:55] until we see it in the paper friendship
[9:59] so i i don't want to take that it's just
[10:02] as brother branham complaining
[10:04] about what we have i want to take it as
[10:06] this is what
[10:07] friendship means this is what being
[10:09] neighborly means
[10:11] what does it mean he says here
[10:16] loyalty loyalty to your friend standing
[10:19] with your friend
[10:21] you'll you'll have times where people
[10:23] will come
[10:24] and make accusations against your friend
[10:27] or stand against your friend
[10:29] right or wrong will you stand with them
[10:32] okay if they're wrong you can
[10:33] talk to them but if another person is
[10:35] coming and attacking your friend
[10:37] be loyal god loves that
[10:41] god delights in a loyal friend that
[10:43] won't throw their other friend under the
[10:44] bus
[10:45] but today we don't have anything like
[10:47] the love of many wax
[10:48] grows wax cold it's terrible
[10:52] so it used to be when someone got sick
[10:54] in the neighborhood that everybody
[10:57] come around and help them with all our
[10:59] work so a real friend
[11:01] someone's sick you go and help them with
[11:04] their work
[11:05] and he says that they used to stay stay
[11:07] up lend a hand
[11:09] and stay up and sit with them all night
[11:12] if it was necessary so that a spouse
[11:14] or a daughter or son could go and get
[11:16] some rest
[11:17] this he's talking about what real
[11:19] friendship is
[11:23] hardly we hardly know the neighbor is
[11:26] dead until we see it in the paper again
[11:28] don't take it as just a complaint and
[11:30] say oh it's just a fact
[11:31] he's he's telling this is what you
[11:35] as christians should be doing you should
[11:36] know your neighbors i'm convicted i'm
[11:38] guilty
[11:39] you should know your neighbors you
[11:41] should know what's going on in their
[11:42] life
[11:43] so that you can do what he says here be
[11:46] a help
[11:47] to them make a meal for them sit and
[11:50] talk with them
[11:51] just be friendly we don't we don't do
[11:53] that anymore it's not our cult
[11:54] it's not our american culture anymore
[11:56] but i believe brother branham's telling
[11:58] us it's god's culture
[12:00] this is god's purpose this is god's plan
[12:02] love your neighbor
[12:04] as yourself who's your neighbor
[12:06] everybody everyone on the planet
[12:09] proverbs 27 verse 10
[12:17] thine own friend and thy father's friend
[12:20] forsake not think about that
[12:24] don't forsake your friends what does it
[12:27] mean
[12:28] to forsake your friends it means to a
[12:30] desert
[12:32] or abandon them how easily we do it
[12:36] how easily we do it in today's day and
[12:38] age we just move on
[12:41] we we move on from the friendship we
[12:43] move on from the relationship not a word
[12:45] nothing
[12:46] don't it don't hardly matter to us
[12:49] it's completely unscriptural it says
[12:51] don't forsake your friend
[12:52] you say but they're doing this but
[12:54] they're it doesn't say any qualification
[12:56] it says don't forsake them
[12:59] it's not telling you if they do this do
[13:01] that stick with them
[13:03] not only your friend but your father's
[13:05] some of the best friends you could
[13:06] possibly have
[13:08] are your dad's friends why
[13:12] if you have a godly dad then he's got
[13:14] godly friends
[13:16] and that means that they can be an
[13:18] example of
[13:20] manhood they can be an example they can
[13:23] give you advice
[13:24] they can direct you and help you in your
[13:27] life they can be a help
[13:28] in many situations often my dad's
[13:31] friends would stand up and
[13:32] almost do anything for me because they
[13:35] love my dad
[13:37] how important is don't forsake him don't
[13:39] take that lightly don't take these
[13:40] relationships as
[13:42] meaningless or unimportant god sees them
[13:45] differently
[13:46] and the word of god treats them
[13:48] differently than we do in our society
[13:51] too much we're impacted by american
[13:53] culture it's not good
[13:55] it's not good at all neither go into
[13:58] your brother's
[13:59] thy brother's house in the day of
[14:01] calamity
[14:03] interesting for better is a neighbor
[14:06] that is nearer than a brother that's far
[14:08] off what does it mean it's talking about
[14:13] someone who is a true friend who stands
[14:15] with you you might have a brother
[14:16] and you're not close there's not a good
[14:18] relationship or there's
[14:20] a bad rivalry or a bad situation well of
[14:22] course as a christian you should try to
[14:24] heal that
[14:25] you should try to fix that keep it in a
[14:27] good positive place
[14:28] but if you can't fix it just understand
[14:32] go to your go to your neighbor go to
[14:34] your real friend's
[14:35] house in the day of trouble they will
[14:37] stand with you a true christian brother
[14:40] will stand with you and that goes to the
[14:41] reverse is we need to stand
[14:43] with each other in difficult times
[14:46] in trials you know we don't have to
[14:49] give all of our money like it's a
[14:51] commune and then support it but
[14:53] we should not consider that our money is
[14:56] our own
[14:57] somebody has a need and is in
[14:58] desperation we should just say
[15:00] here knowing that god don't say well
[15:04] if i give that then i won't be able to
[15:05] do this god knows
[15:08] he knows all that he can meet your need
[15:11] he says give and it will be given to you
[15:14] you know we're that's what he wants us
[15:15] to do is to
[15:17] be there for each other in
[15:20] the days of calamity
[15:26] james 1 19 and i'm going to
[15:29] read it from the english standard
[15:32] version
[15:33] for this one says know this my beloved
[15:36] brothers let every person
[15:38] be quick to hear slow to speak
[15:42] and slow to anger
[15:46] i think this is so critical
[15:49] in our day and age our social media
[15:53] and just in general life teaches us not
[15:56] really to listen
[15:59] we don't really listen we just wait for
[16:01] our opportunity to shout over the top of
[16:03] somebody else
[16:04] or just to give our opinion be quick be
[16:08] quick to give your opinion
[16:11] no it says be quick
[16:14] to hear i think the saying has been said
[16:17] over and over again you have two ears
[16:18] and one mouth
[16:19] use them accordingly
[16:24] but a real friend takes the time
[16:28] to close their mouth and listen and even
[16:32] more than that a real friend if the
[16:33] friend is just doesn't want to talk and
[16:36] is all clammed up the friend is going to
[16:38] not
[16:38] rest until their friend shares their
[16:41] heart
[16:43] and talks through what they're going
[16:45] through
[16:46] and a real friend he's going to be not
[16:49] not just
[16:51] i'm just going to listen and then
[16:53] dispute no he's going to ask
[16:54] questions he's going to talk he's going
[16:57] to clarify
[16:58] he's going to help he's going to ask
[16:59] questions to help the friend
[17:02] realize what's really going on what's at
[17:03] the bottom of this problem
[17:05] you don't have to say anything you just
[17:07] have to have wisdom to ask questions
[17:09] many times
[17:10] and god the person solves their own
[17:12] problem
[17:14] through the bible and through asking
[17:16] biblical questions
[17:17] that's all that's necessary
[17:20] we want to make sure we understand our
[17:23] friends
[17:25] correctly really are deeply
[17:26] understanding them
[17:28] before we open our mouth and talk it's
[17:31] critical
[17:31] it's key
[17:36] be quick to hear and slow to give your
[17:38] opinion
[17:40] on real life and social media
[17:43] there was a there was a little meme i
[17:46] sent out
[17:47] onto the um the booth group that i i
[17:50] really
[17:51] kind of live by is when it was a picture
[17:54] of a little frog
[17:55] and then i think a chameleon the little
[17:57] frog was just sitting there
[17:59] and the chameleon had its like hits its
[18:02] hand over the top of its mouth
[18:04] and it said uh me trying to
[18:08] respond to a political post on social
[18:11] media
[18:12] and he says this is me the frog and then
[18:14] the the chameleon or the little lizard
[18:16] was
[18:17] the holy spirit with his hand over and
[18:18] saying shut your mouth
[18:21] stop in your mouth i think that's good
[18:24] we don't always have to respond to
[18:25] everything
[18:26] it's not up to us and sometimes
[18:29] sometimes you display christ the best
[18:33] with your mouth shut
[18:37] and if someone frustrates you don't
[18:40] speak the frustration speak the love
[18:43] that you have
[18:44] even if you don't feel it if you feel
[18:46] frustrated if you feel upset
[18:48] speak the love because the feelings will
[18:50] then follow we're not supposed to follow
[18:52] our feelings we're supposed to follow
[18:53] the truth
[18:54] and the truth is that i love my enemies
[18:57] i don't always feel that but i
[19:00] we it says be slow to anger so
[19:04] be slow to anger be quick to listen
[19:07] and be quick to express love
[19:10] to others let's see where am i
[19:14] at here job 6
[19:17] 14. i'm going to read from the esv again
[19:22] he who withholds kindness from a friend
[19:25] forsakes the fear of the almighty
[19:28] wow amen
[19:32] he that withholds kindness that's
[19:35] quite an astounding statement in other
[19:38] words
[19:40] giving kindness to others is an
[19:42] expression that you have
[19:44] reverence for god your reverence for god
[19:49] is expressed by
[19:51] doing something loving for
[19:54] another person
[19:58] believer or unbeliever co-worker anyone
[20:01] that's expressing fear the fear of god
[20:04] in your life
[20:07] and if on the the reverse is that if you
[20:10] ignore
[20:11] if you see someone has a need and you
[20:13] don't do anything about it
[20:14] you ignore it you don't fear god
[20:18] wow ouch
[20:22] proverbs 27 verse 9.
[20:28] again i'm going to read from the esv oil
[20:30] and perfume make the heart glad
[20:33] and the sweetness or pleasantness of a
[20:36] friend
[20:37] comes from his earnest counsel
[20:40] counsel means advice isn't that
[20:44] isn't that beautiful the sweetness
[20:48] of a friend comes from his genuine
[20:51] sincere advice i think i think that's
[20:55] something that
[20:55] we need to remember about friendship we
[20:58] just look at friendship as fun
[21:00] in america but friendship is not
[21:03] equal to fun that's not what it's all
[21:05] about
[21:06] marriage is not equal to fun that's not
[21:09] what it's all about
[21:12] ultimately friendship is influence over
[21:15] one another
[21:16] and young people you have to remember
[21:18] that what kind of life are you building
[21:20] look at your friends look at the people
[21:24] that you're receiving advice from well i
[21:25] don't receive advice from them
[21:28] you are receiving advice from them
[21:31] absolutely even if they're not giving
[21:33] you advice of course they are
[21:35] of course they are you just don't look
[21:37] at that at it that way
[21:40] but you're if they're your friend and
[21:41] they're in your life you're getting
[21:43] their advice do you want their advice
[21:46] if you weren't emotionally attached in
[21:48] some way would you really want their
[21:50] advice or would you
[21:51] run like the wind like a gazelle
[21:54] away from their advice then you should
[21:56] consider why is this person my friend
[21:59] that doesn't mean you have to stop
[22:03] serving them in whatever way but in some
[22:05] way some ways if that person has
[22:08] got into your life so close and you're
[22:10] just constantly receiving their
[22:12] advice and their counsel it's time to
[22:14] break it off and run like a gazelle
[22:27] let's see here proverbs
[22:30] 27 verse 6.
[22:40] faithful are the wounds of a friend but
[22:42] the kisses of an enemy
[22:44] are deceitful amen
[22:48] we don't ever we usually don't want to
[22:50] be corrected
[22:51] we usually don't want to have any kind
[22:53] of
[22:55] words quote unquote come against us
[23:00] but that's because we have a wrong
[23:02] viewpoint we have a viewpoint of
[23:04] protecting self
[23:06] what's the point of protecting yourself
[23:08] if yourself is not in line with the word
[23:10] of god
[23:12] you want to come in line with the word
[23:14] and a real
[23:16] genuine friend is going to
[23:19] wound you what does it mean
[23:22] he's going to correct you he's going to
[23:24] speak truth
[23:26] into your life whether you like it or
[23:27] not and actually
[23:29] you'll learn and grow to appreciate it
[23:32] it won't be an offense to you why
[23:33] because there's a real
[23:35] connection between you if a stranger
[23:37] comes up to me or someone who's distant
[23:39] from me or rude to me
[23:40] all the time comes up and corrects me
[23:42] what am i going to do right away
[23:44] who are you to talk to me that's our
[23:47] attitude
[23:49] and it's not good at the same time
[23:52] is understandable so us
[23:55] if you want to correct someone have a
[23:57] build a relationship build a friendship
[23:59] first show love first don't just show up
[24:02] into their life and punch them in the
[24:04] nose and then walk away
[24:07] build a build a friendship build a
[24:10] relationship
[24:11] and through that relationship through
[24:13] that friendship
[24:14] you can speak truth to them that might
[24:16] hurt a little bit and they can do it to
[24:18] you
[24:19] and it might hurt a little bit that's
[24:21] what a real godly friend will do
[24:24] and it'll be a normal thing i had a i
[24:26] had a friend back in minnesota and he
[24:28] and i met
[24:29] on a weekly basis for for coffee
[24:33] didn't always work but it most of the
[24:35] time it did
[24:37] and he and i got to the place in our
[24:39] relationship where we would just openly
[24:41] it was no problem we we had it like well
[24:44] what's going on
[24:45] okay and they'd bring it back to me like
[24:46] oh okay and it was just a normal thing
[24:49] in our relationship why because the love
[24:51] never changed the attitude never changed
[24:54] the approach never changed and we
[24:55] appreciated each other
[24:57] for speaking hard things to each other
[24:59] that other people wouldn't do
[25:01] i believe that's the kind of friendships
[25:03] we need
[25:04] to have with one another but the kisses
[25:07] of an enemy are deceitful
[25:09] kisses of an enemy what is it talking
[25:11] about it's saying
[25:12] people are flattering you it's saying
[25:16] people are buttering you up
[25:18] what does that look like it looks like
[25:20] they're really your friend doesn't it
[25:24] but actually they're just your enemy if
[25:27] all you hear is
[25:28] pat's on the back oh you're such a good
[25:31] guy you're so nice you're so this you
[25:33] said
[25:33] just wait for it
[25:36] the slap is coming
[25:40] but we need godly correction and we need
[25:42] friends like that
[25:44] that we feel loved and secure
[25:48] in the christian friendship that we have
[25:50] that we can speak
[25:52] convicting things to one another and
[25:54] that we rejoice in that
[25:57] philemon 1 10 through 12 and once again
[26:02] i reading from the esv just to get a
[26:04] little bit more of the feel of it
[26:06] i appeal to you for my child onesimus
[26:10] whose father i became in my imprisonment
[26:13] formerly he was useless to you
[26:16] my goodness that's quite a statement
[26:18] formerly he was useless to you
[26:22] but now he is indeed useful to you and
[26:25] to me
[26:26] i am sending him back to you listen to
[26:29] this
[26:30] sending my very heart
[26:33] what a statement what a relationship and
[26:36] friendship that paul had with philemon
[26:39] that they that he could say i'm sending
[26:41] philemon but it's not just philemon i'm
[26:43] sending to you
[26:44] it's my very heart i believe that's the
[26:47] kind of connections that god wants us to
[26:49] have in the body of christ
[26:51] no not that we make one another god
[26:54] instead of god but that we have such a
[26:58] we have a heart to heart
[27:01] connection that we really know each
[27:03] other
[27:05] from the heart and understand each other
[27:08] from the heart so many problems
[27:10] are are solved by really knowing each
[27:13] other in this way
[27:15] being genuine being honest being true
[27:17] not putting up
[27:19] putting up a front or a wall
[27:22] to protect ourselves no god doesn't want
[27:24] that in the body of christ
[27:26] he wants true ministry to happen between
[27:29] all of us
[27:30] not just from the preachers but between
[27:32] all of us
[27:34] but it comes when he unites our hearts
[27:37] in connection together
[27:44] proverbs 17 verse 9.
[27:50] and again i'll read from the esv whoever
[27:52] covers an offense
[27:53] seeks love but he who repeats a matter
[27:57] separates close friends this is critical
[28:02] in a friend and a genuine friendship
[28:05] is when you speak to someone you should
[28:08] know that it's staying between the two
[28:09] of you
[28:11] and it's not going any further than that
[28:15] and if you if you cover an offense
[28:19] what are you what are you doing what is
[28:20] your purpose not to hide it
[28:23] not to sweep it under the rug of course
[28:24] you're talking talking to them about
[28:26] about it and they're you're talking to
[28:28] each other to help them in their growth
[28:30] in christ
[28:31] and you cover it why because you love
[28:34] them
[28:34] you're seeking love but the person that
[28:39] repeats it to someone else you're
[28:42] separating
[28:43] close friends
[28:47] proverbs 16 28 says a dishonest man
[28:49] spreads strife and a whisper separates
[28:52] close friends again this is absolutely
[28:56] critical
[28:57] gossip destroys relationships
[29:00] gossip destroys friendships and we have
[29:03] to
[29:04] absolutely it destroys trust
[29:07] and destroyed trust brings a distance
[29:10] between people and it brings a wall
[29:12] between people
[29:13] and god wants us to seek to restore it
[29:16] not
[29:17] not if you offended should you restore
[29:19] it if you were the one
[29:20] being offended the bible says you are
[29:23] supposed to go to the person
[29:25] and talk to them and if you know you
[29:28] offended someone you're not supposed to
[29:29] rest until you've gone
[29:31] and solved the problem you're not
[29:34] supposed to bring even your tie
[29:35] your tithe or come and take communion
[29:38] until you go
[29:39] and solve the problem why because it
[29:41] breaks the unity and brother branham
[29:43] talks about it you can't you can't have
[29:44] healing you can't have
[29:46] spiritual blessings when these things
[29:48] are going on in the body
[29:49] it brings damage it brings hurt it
[29:52] brings
[29:53] to the place where the spirit of god has
[29:54] just stopped why because we're selfish
[29:56] protecting ourself
[29:58] we don't want to confront we don't want
[29:59] to deal with it
[30:01] you we need to we need to
[30:04] talk to each other that's that's what it
[30:07] is and we need to be
[30:09] quick to listen and slow to speak
[30:13] and slow to get mad about it so
[30:16] let's stand up and pray
[30:23] heavenly father we thank you so much for
[30:25] these things lord i pray that you would
[30:26] help them to be a
[30:28] a reality in our life not just really
[30:30] good
[30:31] doctrine put forth over the sunday
[30:34] school pulpit lord but
[30:36] correct us and teach us and and plant
[30:38] these things in our heart and convict us
[30:40] and help us to
[30:41] really move forward in the love of
[30:43] christ
[30:45] lord we commit the service to you today
[30:47] we ask that your holy spirit would just
[30:50] come and and deal with us throughout it
[30:53] lord
[30:54] in the worship in the prayer and in the
[30:56] preaching of the word
[30:58] and we ask that you would be glorified
[31:01] we
[31:01] commit it to you in the name of jesus
[31:03] christ amen
[31:04] amen god bless you
