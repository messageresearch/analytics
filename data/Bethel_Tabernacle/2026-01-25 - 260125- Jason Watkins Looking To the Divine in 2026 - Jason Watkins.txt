As the skies turn black and the earth turned red at the foot of the cross. He was standing near your mother. They were so close. They could hear you sighing all around them. Angry voices pierced the darkness. And you were dying, but they would not leave. They lingered there. No matter the cost, they were staying. They were praying at the foot of the cross.

We're happy to have you all in the house of God today and um want to give you greetings in the name of the Lord and glad that uh most of that storm is passing all above us. We're um want to be in prayer for there's churches all across a big old band of believers. But I know that God knows where every one of his children are. And I just know that the Lord cares. Amen. He has demonstrated that over the years. Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to have the boys in from Clemson today. Papa had to turn some screws, but I got it done. Amen. Praise the Lord. I had to be cool about it though because, you know, I didn't want to try to act like I was ordering him around. Although, they would have did it if I'd have ordered them, but I didn't want to make it like that. So, I was just trying to help mom and dad get them home. I think mom and dad just wanted to see them. Amen. So, uh, but I said, "Hey, man. You don't want to be snowed in without power and Door Dash won't be running. Uh, Uber Eats won't be running. You have no power and no food." and uh Noah said, "Okay, we're Amen." So, we're happy to have them here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Um so, I just want to be in prayer. Oh, yeah. Sure enough. Um a lot of power is out. I'm getting notices um up in Tennessee and some different places like that. Amen. We trust our um stream will stay okay today. We may have a number of streamers from cancelled service. If so, God bless you. Amen. Um, the backbone of our stream goes right through Atlanta. And if that has a problem, sometimes it can create a problem for us here. So hopefully everything will stay steady. Amen. And uh, we'll be good to go on the stream. We're going to invite you to Philippians chapter 2 this morning. And um I want to take today as we've kind of become cussed at the calling it kind of my own personal state of the union address. I do it the beginning of every year. I don't always do it on the first weekend of January, but I try to do it at least within the month. And it just gives me an opportunity to kind of open my heart up to you all in a personal way. And um you know no service is complete without the the gospel and the reading of the word and and exhortation on the word of God. So we're going to uh inter you know weave that in and um some things that I want to say will actually give me a perfect segue to uh the burden of the word because I do have a burden of the word on my heart today. And I want to take u this thought looking to the divine in 2026. looking to the divine. And I'm not here, I promise you, this isn't um um I'm not here, this isn't a YouTube podcast on current events. This is not a news show. I'm going to preach the gospel. I'm a gospel preacher. It's what I do. But uh we do want to talk about some world events as they relate to prophecy. Brother Brandon would do that from time to time and kind of catch us up on world events at that era, in that era. And we can see that there were things that he said were coming that didn't materialize so much in his day as they have in our day. So it's relevant. Amen. To us. Are your hearts and minds open today to hear from the Lord. Amen. Philippians chapter 2 and we're going to catch verses 12 to 18. If there be if there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, I'm sorry, I'm starting. I'm in the wrong place. Ch verse 12. My apologies. I knew that didn't sound right. And you just pray for me today. Yesterday, I battled a curious headache all day. I couldn't get it to go away, and that's unusual for me. And then, um, went to sleep last night. I was telling Brother Jack, I slept 12 hours, which is like double my sleep time. And I woke up this morning with lying flu symptoms. And so, but the devil is still a liar. &gt;&gt; And uh I don't mind calling him liar to his face. Amen. He still ain't nobody. And we're going to persevere and press on anyway. So if my voice sounds a little weaker than normal, you just keep praying for me. Amen. Verse 12. Philippians 2 verse 12. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. It's interesting he would daisy chain those two principles together, connecting them back to back. work out your own salvation, but it's God doing it. &gt;&gt; All right. Do all things. So your So your main working is to let is to be able for God to do it. Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. Yay. And if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all. For the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me. Let's pray. Father, I thank you for your wonderful word that I feel such an anointing for this morning. And and Lord, it's come to me in such a curious way. not so much in the normal way. I I've even found as I've studied it out and it it it just seemed like you wanted me to sit more quietly just in your presence and just reflect from my heart. So that's exactly what we're going to do today. I ask you to remember me embody the devil attacking and other families who are sick today with a number of requests that came in and some families traveling and uh on the road. I pray for their safety. Lord, all of your saints from Texas to Virginia and beyond and up into even Lord, Father, Midwestern states are under terrible conditions of storm. And we pray that you'll be a covert from storm for them all. Help us today. May you be with our technology that it doesn't fail, Lord, and keep us going now. We pray. We commit it all to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated looking into 2026, you know, just just from the natural standpoint. And if you'll bear with me for just a few minutes, I want to use some of the natural part of things that the church that we're involved with and things that are happening, things also projects that I'm working on personally in my personal ministry. Aside from um my duties here at the church, you know, we um we still have our building project that is underway and and I and I you know, I can say a couple of things to that that it has gone longer than we wanted it to. Uh but it has not gone longer. It has not surprised us as brethren and trustees and and things of how long it's gone. These projects are are large and we we're trying by all possible means to do it without debt. And um so we have more to say on that. not going to take it all today and and pitch um you know our building program, but uh we've had a lot of stuff going on myself personally with moving and renovating the house next door that has caused some delays. Brother Matt was building for a number of years and he's kind of the head of that project and that and so I just want to say all of that to say that we are still very it's very much on our front burner now and we're looking I don't plan any new personal um major projects uh until we see this project completed. We need it. We want it. We have growing assembly, growing families, and we need the facilities upgraded, and we're trying by all possible means to save our money and do it uh with cash so that we don't have to borrow any money. And so, that's kind of where it's at. I just want to let you know that it's still underway and it's going forward. We first of all, you know, you're aware that we spent the first two years just trying to get it permitted and that was through the city. So much red tape to almost an embarrassing level and uh I was even entertaining the thoughts of reaching out to uh um a legal firm and attorneys and just say, "Hey, can you step in because it's becoming ridiculous and obviously things are happening on purpose and we know it's the devil fighting. We didn't have to do that. You know, I I I talked to one pastor of a large church in Texas and and they they actually when they get ready to do any kind of a building project, they actually submit their their permits to the city through an attorney's office. They actually have the attorney submit all the applications. And maybe that's a way to do it going forward if we ever run into that again. so that uh the powers that be understand that we're serious and uh we're going to have to be expect to be treated fairly. So that being said, we have all the permits that we need. I didn't even know that. I thought we only had the next stage. My understanding is now we have all the permits we will ever need to go all the way through to finish our to to start to erect our fellowship hall and connect it here and then renovate the sanctuary inside here. It'll give us more seating. It'll give us actually for the first time ever a vestibule area because when you step in from outside you're immediately in the in the sanctuary. So it'll give restrooms at the back. You won't have to walk around all the way around uh the church. So, don't don't make sure that we don't triple our trips to the restroom just because they're more convenient. Amen. But, uh, we're looking at doing that and and you just keep us in prayer. And if you have, you know, thought that you'd like to give and you've wondered, hey, what's even going on and don't just want to give to a Phantom Project, it's real. And, uh, your contributions are all put in continually into that fund and we have a long ways to go. And so, but I think that we can um create a a sense and and I have some plans with the brothers to to present to you a really fresh updated version of of dollars and cents and where we are and building costs only go up. It gets more expensive every year. So, that's where we are in 2026 on our building project. We'd like to um make you aware that we have uh had the first meetings and and the wheels are already turning. We're not waiting to get them going. We've talked it through. We've mapped out a pro a program and we actually have wheels turning for Bethl Tabernacle School of the Future. and we call it the future not because we're doing it in the future, but because we're going to make it first class uh school learning environment. We already have students. We already have volunteers. We already are assembling our curriculum and that's going to involve a lot of technology and uh you can't avoid that. You know, we'd love to just go back to the one room schoolhouse with the Bible as our primmer. And believe me, the Bible will be our primmer. But uh but we're going to leverage technology in a safe environment and it's going to have ministry oversight from day one. So I want you to know that and I just I'm I'm of the opinion that u children should not go to public schools uh in grade school, middle school, or even high school. That's brother Jason's personal opinion. I know that some have, some do, some will, and they do it successfully. But I believe that we can give a better alternative with a a schooling and uh with the with the agentive future that's rushing in right now. Trust me, brickandmortar learning institutions, their days are numbered. Certainly, if they don't have a major overhaul, uh they're going to become they are already becoming irrelevant rapidly. Um, I could spend my entire sermon just updating you on where we are in technology and markets and business and things like that. And businesses are already scrambling. 2026 is going to be the year. Not going to be, it already is happening. So, it's not something we're predicting. It's already happening. Um, the business models are changing. um the the the the the technology is such and they're moving towards super intelligence that uh it's going to be the most and I say this without any hesitation. It will be the most transformative thing to happen to the world. It'll it'll exceed the internet, the computer, the automobile, the jet plane, space travel. It will exceed all of that. It will be the largest transformation of politics, education, business, government, lifestyle and it is rolling in very rapidly. Friends, mankind is inventing himself into his own destruction and it is coming and uh the types and shadows in the scripture are so clear. It's it's ringing the bells of prophecy as it goes along. And you know, everything from the tree of knowledge, we know brings more death. And so, you know, businesses are are right now trying to play catch-up. And the businesses who aren't are going to find themselves irrelevant very quickly. and governments and you know I could just I could just um take you to some of the most learned people that I that I follow um so that I stay on the on the absolute edge because it's for me it's not about being on the edge of technology. It's about being able to track modern events made clear in prophecy. That's why brother Jason does it. That's that's really my 90%. I have a personal appeal to technology. I'm a little bit of a nerd that way. But for me, it's all about prophecy and where are we and the things that I see happening. I can tell you friends, look up. Your redemption draweth nigh. &gt;&gt; The world is racing and judgments are racing to meet the world. And as you've heard me say many times, the only way out is up. Amen. And so, if there was ever a time for you to be to make your calling and election sure, it's now. If there was ever a time to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, it's now. So, we are we are looking to to kind of uh take that and provide a learning environment uh for our children. And um I don't condemn any parents who still put their children in public schools. And I'm not brother Brandham was not opposed to education. &gt;&gt; He was absolutely not opposed to education. What what bothered brother Brham is that the as long as you understand the more you eat of education that education, civilization, politics, everything is of the devil. &gt;&gt; That's that's right from a prophet. It leading the world to Armageddon and a self-destruction. And in fact is God's not going to have to destroy mankind. He's just going to stop stopping him from destroying himself. And the only reason that that's being stopped right now is you are here. And once the bride goes up, Satan is cast down. Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth for Satan has come down to you. I'm here to tell you something, friends. That's not a time you want to be here. This is a serious hour. And we're preaching that we uh that we have ourselves ready as I've been preaching that just like Enoch the rapture. And I proved it to you. We strung a bunch of quotes together in services some uh some some services ago that the rapture will be so simple it will be just the next short step. Uh it'll be a short step further than you were the day before and you'll just step in and your the dead love dead loved ones will come back because they're not actually dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've never actually died. You know, one of the conversation starter I love and I'll provoke it in a group of people is when somebody says the end of the world and I say to the world's not ending &gt;&gt; and all eyes you got everybody's attention right fast. The world's not ending. The earth's eternal attribute of God can never be annihilated. What's ending is the civilization, mankind's 6,000year run in a fallen condition. That's ending. And a new king is taking over the earth. We're going to be right here. It's going to carry right on. See? and and you know so so and then the next thing when they talk about this person died or that famous person and I'll sometimes I'll pitch in no one's ever actually died yet. &gt;&gt; No one only the second death the lake of fire is actual full death. All people have done since the Garden of Eden is transition from this dimension into another one. They're still very much alive. See? So, so, so when you when you die, that's why when people try to take their own life because they want to get out of a miserable situation. I'm sorry, but all you do is transfer your own self from the frying pan to the fire because there's you dying doesn't fix anything. You're still alive. Your body lays down. The spirit exits, but everyone who's ever lived is still alive &gt;&gt; and somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever lose sight of that. See, and so we know that on that morning the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain. Brother Brandham said you'll you'll feel a little feeling come across you. You'll turn around and there'll be mother or father or that loved one that grow that's gone on and there they'll be and then that'll be a catalyst to your faith to change your mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I don't feel like the flu this morning. My goodness. Amen. So, so there there's some of the things that we're doing. We're also um restarting um not restarting it as if we canceled it, but we brother Kevin and Sister Sarah, they did the financial peace university classes. We're going to be starting that back up again. You should see brother Kevin uh and sister Sarah to get on the schedule. That was magnificently successful. and young couples at that time really and even even older couples and I audited those classes most of them set in on them myself and they're very good and uh we're going to be starting that up again very soon do you have a starting date brother Kev for that yet &gt;&gt; okay but it's soon &gt;&gt; very good very soon and so you be getting if you want to um it's it's it's it's biblical principles u that brother Kevin and sister Sarah have studied and learned and are and actually are qualified, certified to teach those things. And um there's there's few things worse than being chained to Pharaoh's chariot of debt. There's few things worse than being chained to that. And so one of the best things that you can do is to, you know, see yourself successful financially. Nothing wrong with that either. But you want to that God has a provided way. God has a provided way for everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we Why would you not go God's way? It's provided. Amen. So we're going to be starting that very soon. Uh we also have as another Bethl tabernacle project is some we have some new mission work opportunities that are ramping up right now and beginning to scale in India. And from there we have plans for India and Pakistan. They used to be actually one country and they divided away from Hindus and Muslims back in the days of Gandhi. And so, um, we're working now to put translated books into the hands there in India. Working there with, um, um, brother, um, um, my good friend, never forget him. Um, I'm drawing a blank right now. It'll come to me in a minute, but we're working with brother Barry Coffee with those brothers. I hope he doesn't hear that because he's going to say, "How could you not remember my name?" I do remember his name. It's just old-timers. But anyway, amen. So that's starting to scale and we're we're also still involved with Vision Books, putting books into Africa across the continent. We've been working with Brother Barry Coffee on that for a number of years. So this is a new project uh that we're ramping up uh there. Amen. I'm going to get that name as sure as anything. But anyway, Brother Samson Shetty, praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Samson, my very good friend. Amen. and he is heading up a team of brothers there to do that. Um I I coveret your prayers on some personal projects I'm working on. I am um I'm I'm working and I've already completed part of it on um a verse byvere commentary on the entire book of Revelation. I started that some years ago with live um uh teaching online live Bible studies. We went a little over three and a half years and we went verse by verse. We called it the work of a thousand days. That's all on audio files. I'm working on trying to transcribe that into a study guide book um on the entire book of Revelation verse by verse. I've picked up again uh on my my work from some years ago on a translation and commentary on the book of Romans. Uh I've started actually writing a new book personally called if I could talk to Jesus face to face and I was the whole idea of that came to me because I realized that Jesus preached to thousands. He sat in a boat and preached to everybody on the shore. He moved among they thronged him and and there were times but there were times in the Bible where it was just Jesus and a person. He was just speaking to them. They were talking to him. I think of Nicodemus who met him in the middle of the night. See, and I I I think of these these times where individuals met him when the centurion came to him. My my servant is sick. And these kinds of one-on-one conversations. To my shock when I began to look at it, there's more than more than 30 almost 40 different times where Jesus is actually speaking to an individual face to face. And so the whole premise of the book is to take those instances and give the world an idea of how the actual Jesus handled life situations. And I'm here to tell you something, friends, by by studying his interaction personally, not his sermon on the mount. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about when he's feeding 5,000. I'm talking about when he's face to face. If I could talk to Jesus face to face and tell him my problem, what do I expect his answer? How would he talk to me? In what way? What tone? What approach would he take? And so that's something that I've been working on. I've also felt inspired to begin a work on the entire book of Psalms from the perspective of William Brham. Brother Brham used a lot of the Psalms. So, you know, they say as long as somebody owes you money, you'll never be broke. So, I figure as long as I've got a project to work on, I'll never be bored. Amen. I'll never have nothing to do. So, you pray for me. I'll I'll I'll kind of keep you up to date as those projects go along. Amen. I'm enjoying the work. I love I love I heard brother Tim Puit make a statement some years ago. I had such an affinity with it. He said he made this statement. And he said, "I do not study to preach." He said, "I study because I love it." And that I just said, "Man, how well said is that?" And uh I don't truly don't study to preach. I feel like I'm preaching all the time, either in a pullpit or online or personto person. But uh I study the God's word because I love it. It's like I can't get enough of it. And so um so you be praying for me in those projects. Amen. That's what we're looking forward to going in this year. Now, I want to say a few more things about modern events made clear in prophecy. But I want to first take you back to our to our opening text from Philippians. And I'm going to read it to you. Brother Kevin, if you have uh the NIV translation, you can pick up Philippians 2:12. And I'm I want to read just a couple of these verses again. And I want to begin to make some points. Paul says here in Philippians 2:12 uh from the New International Version, "Therefore, my and the NIV is not a version I use a lot of. I'm I really don't favor it most often, but it I favored a particular way that it it worded something here." So, I'm um and I first had to study to make sure it was accurate, and it certainly is. And so he says here in verse 12, "Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed, not only in my absence, but now much more in my absence. Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose." Not yours, his. do everything without grumbling and arguing. Most commentators think that Paul being a Jew was all too familiar with the the common thing that seemed to be among Israelites and that is to grumble and complain. You remember when Moses brought them out in the wilderness and they all they grumbled and complained. They were always grumbling, always complaining. Don't never do that, friends. Brother Brandham said, "Don't never let a negative word come out of your mouth." See, we've been talking a lot about what things are pure and lovely and of a good report. We should be thinking on these things. So, he says, "Do everything, you know, and this is a burden on Paul's heart." And I I felt when I read Philippians 2, the Lord seemed to lead me in that direction. I thought to myself, you know, here Paul has been moving among them. He was there and preaching and they knew him and he knew many of them in the flesh. And now he's been taken away for by circumstances beyond his control. There were times when Paul would write to churches and say, "I purposed to come see you, but Satan hindered me." It's hard to say why God would allow Satan to hinder that. But what for whatever reason, it didn't stop God's program. And and and I'm here to tell you something, friends. A lot of times we, you know, we we find ourselves thinking that, you know, I I I I've been such a failure at this and such a failure at that. You know, when God told David that there would never fail to be a man on the throne from David's lineage and that he would establish the throne of David forever and that even when Messiah come, he would be known as the son of David in the millennium. And you know, David had some rather titanic failures after that. But you know, not one of his failures stopped that prophecy. Not one God kept putting a man on the throne. God w God God Christ came as the son of David. He will rule and reign in the millennium. And I know that we have our ups and downs. Let's just own it today. just to say, you know, UM I DON'T ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, sometimes I I don't always keep all my commitments and promises to the Lord. David didn't either. That's why David said, "I, you know, I I I thought on my ways and I turned my feet toward the Lord." Brother Brandham said that meant that what was happening with David is David was remembering all the times all the promises he had made God. And he realized as a human he hadn't always kept them exactly like he promised the Lord he would. And he SAYS AS I THOUGHT on my ways. See, and I think it's good for us to think on our ways and realize that I I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN WHAT I NEED TO BE, BUT GOD IS STILL GOD AND THE WORD IS STILL TRUE AND I'M STILL A BELIEVER AND I'M STILL HEADED FOR A RAPTURE. I I I I'M I'M PREDESTINATED not to fall. &gt;&gt; I BECAUSE OF MY ELECTION, I CANNOT I CANNOT BE DECEIVED by the lie that is being told to THE WORLD. THAT'S OF NO merit on my own. Right? &gt;&gt; If I didn't GET IT BY MERIT, HOW WOULD I LOSE IT BY FAILURE? &gt;&gt; SEE, SO IT'S GOD WHO RULES AND REIGNS, FRIENDS. And I'm HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING TODAY. SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL ALMOST wearied by your own uh LACK OF SPIRITUALITY. YOU KNOW, I I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, AS I'VE SHOWN YOU MANY TIMES BEFORE, they know this in the military, that when you WHEN YOU GET OUT OF A STEP, THE WHOLE REASON THEY HAVE THAT CADENCE, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, and they sing and they and it's ALL TO A RHYTHM. ARMIES HAVE DONE THAT through millennia. SEE, BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT DOES SINGING give courage, BUT IT ACTUALLY CAUSES THAT UNIT TO OPERATE. the the Roman legions would beat a drum and they those whole failanks was would TURN AND THEY KNEW AND they'd raise a flag and beat a drum and they knew exactly how to do it and AND AND SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I remember that um brother Stacy told me there brother Stacy Goodre he's in the I think the Air Force and we were talking about you know the brother Brandham showing the bride he said the two or three of them at the end were getting out of step and he said I SCREAMED YOU KNOW GET BACK IN STEP GET STAY IN LINE STAY IN HE SAID, "WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE VISION, I WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH MY HANDS OUT SAYING, "STAY IN LINE." SEE, AND BROTHER STACY SAID, "YEAH." HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE SAID, "THEY were marching." Because brother M said they were marching to the step of the gospel and two or three at the END AT THE LAST THE LAST DAYS. SOMETIMES WE FIND OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT OUT OF STEP. &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER STACY SAID, "BUT THE THING TO REMEMBER, UH, he says, IS IT ONLY TAKES A HALF STEP TO FIX IT." AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT ONLY TAKES A HALF STEP. AND I I'VE DEMONSTRATED IT BEFORE. THE WAY BROTHER STACY DEMONSTRATED, it's left, LEFT, AND IF YOU'RE AT A STEP, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LEFT and just TAKE A HALF A STEP. YOU'RE ONLY A HALF A STEP OUT. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DEVIL HAS DONE. YOU'RE ONLY A HALF STEP OUT. JUST MAKE A HALF STEP AND YOU'LL BE BACK IN HARMONY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS A HAS A WOMAN COME UP IN THE LINE AND HE SAYS, "NOW, YOU'VE BEEN AWAY FROM GOD." YES. BUT YOU WANT TO COME BACK. YES, YOU'RE BACK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. HIS MERCIES ARE NEW EVERY MORNING. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. WE'RE CLOSE TO HOME, FRIENDS. PRESS TOWARDS the mark. &gt;&gt; Be willing to press. &gt;&gt; That means strain, STRETCH, REACH. SOMETIMES YOU'LL CATCH A CHARLIE HORSE DOING THAT. AND AND SOMETIMES A SPIRITUAL CHARLIE HORSE IS WHAT YOU NEED. &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU MAY SAY IT'S PAINFUL. YEAH. AND AND AND YOU YOU DO A INDIAN WAR DANCE. YEAH, GO FOR IT. BECAUSE IT'LL PUT YOU BACK IN STEPS. SAY I I DON'T I NEED TO GET IN BETTER SHAPE SO THAT WHEN I'M STRETCHING I DON'T CHARLIE HORSE LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THIS ISN'T A TIME TO BE afraid because the world is ending or the world is transitioning. This is a time that Jesus said Jesus named a whole string of of really um frightening uh words and prophecies. You know, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE WARS AND EARTHQUAKES AND THERE'S GOING TO BE FAMINES AND ALL THESE THINGS AND BUT CARRY ON THE TIMES NOT YET. BUT THEN YOU'LL FINALLY GET TO A TIME WHERE YOU'LL SEE THIS AND you'll see that and there will be many false Christ. AND I MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A message of doom. you know, JESUS WAS ANYTHING. BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW, SOME OF THESE PROSPERITY PREACHERS, SOME OF THESE SMILEY PREACHERS WHO JUST TELL EVERYBODY THAT, "OH, GOD LOVES YOU. IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER." OH, IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS HOW YOU LIVE. IT MATTERS HOW WE THINK. SEE? And so, WE'VE BEEN PROVING THAT IN OUR IN OUR PREVIOUS SERIES. And so, Jesus would say, "When you see these things, LOOK UP. YOUR REDEMPTION draweth nigh." &gt;&gt; So, this isn't a time to be discouraged. is certainly not a time to BE GETTING OUT OF STEP. IT'S NOT A BECAUSE THE BRIDE IS ALREADY ASCENDING. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. The rapture is not a future coming event. THE RAPTURE IS NOW. YOU'RE IT. YOU'RE IN IT. It's happening. &gt;&gt; It's happening in real time. AS YOU LIVE AND BREATHE RIGHT NOW, THE BRIDE IS GETTING CLOSER and closer to that momentous morning. SO I I LOVED THIS TEXT BECAUSE VERSE 15 14 and 15 DO EVERYTHING WITHOUT GRUMBLING and or arguing so that you may become blameless and pure children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation. Now we've shown you the reason I'm zeroing in on that is because as we've shown you before Paul IS CLEARLY TALKING TO PEOPLE who are already children OF GOD. SO HE'S NOT SAYING IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH you can become a CHILD OF GOD. HE'S TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY CHILDREN of God who are already born again of the spirit. And he's HE'S BASICALLY HIS THIS IS HIS SAME MESSAGE PRESS TOWARDS THE MARK. YOU NEED TO BECOME BLAMELESS and pure because you LIVE IN A WARPED AND CROOKED GENERATION AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A LIGHTBEARER. SO HE'S JUST SIMPLY SAYING YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR LIGHT IS SHINING BRIGHT SONS AND DAUGHTERS of God. &gt;&gt; See, SO IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE EARNED OUR WAY INTO SUNSHIP. You can't really do that. YOU CAN'T GAIN ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH WORKS like that. But it's it's it's but it but it's what WE HAVE BEEN PREACHING IN OUR IN our previous series that that the that even AFTER THE NEW BIRTH, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, SEE YOU IN A RAPTURE. IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. NOW YOU'RE NOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CAST DOWN EVERY VAIN IMAGINATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE HUMAN MIND, THE FALLEN mind of man is enmity against God and can never agree with God. See, that's the scriptures. And so, THE FIRST THING GOD HAS TO DO IS BEGIN TO MOVE ON YOUR LIFE AND START TO DEAL WITH YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IT LIKE THIS. HE SAYS IN PLANTING THE vine and where to plant it. I'm watching my time carefully. Brother Brandham says, "Now, Israel in Egypt was not planted. They were JUST SET OUT. IT wasn't their original home ground. &gt;&gt; You understand? So they ended up there through consequences that stretched over hundreds of years. BUT BUT HE SAYS, "BUT THEY WERE NOT PLANTED THERE." THAT'S NOT WHERE GOD PLANTED his vine. They had been planted uh in in the promised land. AND SO MOSES IS AND THAT WAS GOD'S PROMISE THAT ABRAHAM WAS GIVEN THAT LAND. AND GOD TOLD MOSES, "YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM BACK THERE. THIS ISN'T WHERE THEY BELONG." MY AND CATCH that friends because BECAUSE MANY OF THEM WERE BORN in Egypt. BUT IT WHAT THE THE THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT, HOW, WHEN, WHERE YOU WERE BORN. YOU HAD A PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN THE MIND OF GOD. AND GOD HAS A PLACE IN HIS WORD THAT YOU ARE PREDESTINATED TO ARRIVE AT. AND NO, NO EFFECT OF MY BIRTH OR MY RAISING OR THIS HAPPENING OR THAT HAPPENING. EVEN IF I WAS CULPABLE IN THE HAPPENING, NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; AND WHILE I'M GOING THERE, THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO NOT GRUMBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I PROMISE YOU, LIFE WILL FLOOD YOU WITH OPPORTUNITIES to not complain. &gt;&gt; It's just an opportunity. &gt;&gt; It's up to you whether you do or not. See, it's up to you whether you press or not. Paul is suggesting that you need to do this so that you can become blameless in a in a perverse in a warped. &gt;&gt; It wasn't so much so only 4,000 years in Paul's day. &gt;&gt; Paul wasn't dealing with the pale horse rider. We are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul wasn't Paul wasn't dealing with Satan's Eden. We do. &gt;&gt; Paul Satan wasn't the god of the age in his day. And they had a they HAD A LION TO TO ANOINTING. WE HAVE AN EAGLE ANOINTING. GOD HAS NOT LEFT US WITH THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. FRIENDS, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, EVERY PROMISE IN THE BOOK IS YOURS IF YOU'LL CLAIM IT AND BELIEVE IT. AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL THAT CAN STOP YOU. &gt;&gt; Only you can stop you. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO I JUST SAY PRESS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS IS A WARPED GENERATION AND WE NEED TO BE LIGHTS and we NEED TO HAVE THEM BRIGHT AND SHINING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DIDN'T START HERE, &gt;&gt; NOT finishing here. IF 2026 FINISHES MY LIFE ON EARTH, I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T HAVE A GUARANTEE OF TOMORROW. YOU DON'T HAVE A GUARANTEE YOU'LL SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; You see, AND THAT'S WHAT PAUL IS SAYING. YOU KNOW, I I WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT THAT NOW THAT I CAN'T BE AMONG YOU. I USED TO BE, NOW I CAN'T BE. I WANT TO KNOW ON THAT DAY I DIDN'T RUN IN VAIN. I EVERY PREACHER, EVERY PASTOR feels that way. I I CAN'T LISTEN FRIENDS. IF THE LORD WOULD TARRY U YOU KNOW ANOTHER EVEN ANOTHER 30 YEARS 40 50 YEARS WHICH I DON'T THINK AT ALL THERE'S ANY EVEN any any I TO ME I DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD BE EVEN be possible AND AND IT'S NOT THAT GOD COULDN'T DO IT I JUST SIMPLY SAY I DON'T SEE HOW HUMANITY COULD SURVIVE ANOTHER 30 or 40 years &gt;&gt; at the rate that IT'S SELF-DESTRUCTING AND BUT YOU KNOW IF IF THAT HAPPENS and and I PASS ON YOU KNOW I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I SAY TO SOME OF YOU YOUNGER ONES, I'm sorry that I can't be with you for your whole life &gt;&gt; as a message BELIEVER AND SOMEDAY I'LL PASS ON. CAN BROTHER JASON KNOW THAT ON THAT DAY I WON'T HAVE RUN IN VAIN? &gt;&gt; CAN EVERY PASTOR KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T RUN IN VAIN? HE DIDN'T LABOR IN VAIN. I'M TELLING YOU FRIENDS, WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND SOME OF OUR ALL HAVE GONE AHEAD OF US AND I MIGHT GO AHEAD OF YOU AND YOU'LL COME AHEAD OF ME. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST WANT TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO BE THERE. I WANT YOUR FAMILIES TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; SEE? SO, so we strive, we press, I want to BECOME I'M I'M ALREADY A CHILD SON OF GOD. I WANT TO BECOME BLAMELESS. Paul wouldn't suggest that if it wasn't possible. See, HE'S NOT SUGGESTING I I ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT'S NOT EVEN DOABLE, so that you may become BLAMELESS AND PURE CHILDREN OF GOD WITHOUT FAULT in a warped and crooked generation. Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. See, AND SO HE GOES ON, HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, uh that I that I did not uh labor in vain. Uh but even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service COMING FROM YOUR FAITH, I AM glad and rejoice with all OF YOU. CAN I say today, it's been worth it. &gt;&gt; I want you TO KNOW SOMETHING. I STARTED 30 years ago in a little frame in a little A-frame church with with barely 20 people and you couldn't the tall PEOPLE HAD TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE AND THE SHORTER PEOPLE HAD TO STAND AGAINST THE WALLS or you stood like this. WE WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS BETHL TABERNACLE AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE IT AND I DON'T REGRET IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I I'M GLAD TO be numbered WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE WORD OF GOD. I've never HAD THAT PROBLEM HERE. HAVE NEVER HAD A CONGREGATION THAT WEREN'T LOVERS OF THE WORD of God. &gt;&gt; My, we are truly all in this thing together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, Israel in Egypt was not planted. They were just set out. It wasn't their original home ground. And a man that's a Christian that rest his eternal destination upon some denominational creed, he's not in his right mind. He was born to be free and a child OF GOD TO WORSHIP GOD. BUT HE'S UNDER A CREED. He can't bring forth his fruit. Catch this. Yet something in him is longing to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we can all say amen to that. Listen, I might not be trapped under a creed, but sometimes I get trapped under my own under my own guilt and trapped under my own bad feelings and trapped under my own human nonsense. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I REALIZED WHEN SOLOMON WAS TRYING TO put that ter that temple together that day, he had all the parts, but he had to write a letter say, "I need send me therefore a man, SOMEBODY WHO'S CUNNING, SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS. I JUST I TOOK THAT AND I PREACHED, SEND ME THEREFORE A MAN. I NEED THE MAN CHRIST JESUS WHO CAN COME DOWN AND TAKE ALL THE PARTS THAT ARE ME AND PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND SO THAT I'M A TEMPLE WHERE GOD CAN COME IN AND WE CAN HAVE FELLOWSHIP. SEND ME A MAN. &gt;&gt; OH, THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN THAT KNOWS ME AND KNOWS ALL MY WEAKNESSES AND KNOWS WHERE ALL THE PARTS GO AND CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE I'VE MESSED IT ALL UP AND HE CAN PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. I JUST SAY, "COME QUICKLY, LORD JESUS. &gt;&gt; Align my life to your word." See, AND SO SO HE HE GOES ON HERE. He shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water. Rivers plural, water singular, many rivers coming into one channel. In other words, brother Brandham says he'll be like a man in the scripture that believes all of God's word where the power and the nine spiritual gifts can flow through one God into his innermost being. SO IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST GIFTS COMING FROM heaven and making the TRIP DOWN THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERES and flowing through me to somewhere. IT'S IT'S LITERALLY THESE GIFTS CAN FLOW THROUGH ONE GOD IN MY INNERMOST BEING. THAT ONE GOD I'M NOT I'M NOT CONNECTED TO ALPHA CENTURI. &gt;&gt; I HE'S VERY PRESENT. HE'S IN ME. HE'S AROUND ME. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE A CONDUIT SO THAT SO THAT THE WORD CAN GET OUT SO THAT THE LIGHT CAN SHINE. &gt;&gt; SEE, WHAT GOOD IS CHRISTIANITY IF IT'S NOT THAT? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S the point? That's right. &gt;&gt; See, SO, SO, SO WE, SO PAUL SAYS MAKES a statement, BUT NOW MUCH more in my absence, WORK OUT YOUR OWN SALVATION with fear and trembling. Interestingly enough, Brother Brandham, he he he takes both sides of that. can find this and brother Brandham teaches on it and blasphemous names and God's provided place of worship and Revelation chapter 5 and especially Revelation chapter 5 where he deals with I'm sure you'll you'll be familiar remember he deals with Ruth there and it's Ruth uh laboring or working and Ruth trusting and then Ruth resting and and and and he's dealing with that in in the fifth chapter of Revelation. I think it's part two perhaps. And so, Brother Brandham DEALS WITH ALL OF THAT, BOTH SIDES OF THAT, HOW THAT, you know, before the new birth, because the new birth is a work of the Holy Spirit that changes that it that divinely heals your soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, divine healing, you've already experienced divine healing in your soul. &gt;&gt; See, you've been born again. The old nature WAS ANNIHILATED. NOT IT'S NOT THAT THAT OLD NATURE GOT PUT ON A GOT PUT UNDER a chain. It's that it was annihilated. YOU ARE A BRAND new unit. The gene of God that was in you was in seed form AND NOW IT'S COME TO LIFE. BROTHER BRANDHAM DEALS WITH THAT AND AND THERE IS A MAN HERE WHO CAN TURN ON the light. See, IT'S NOT THAT WHEN HE SAID LET THERE BE LIGHT. BROTHER BRHAM SAYS HE WASN'T speaking to the sun. The sun was already there. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The sun was already there. The earth was already there. But over the earth, there was a thick billowing blackness and the and THE SEED WAS ALREADY IN THE EARTH. SEE, BUT THE SUNLIGHT COULDN'T STRIKE THE SEED BECAUSE OF THE THICK DARKNESS. SO WHEN HE SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT," HE WASN'T TALKING TO THE SEED OR THE EARTH or the sun or THE SUN, THE SEED OR THE EARTH. HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE DARKNESS. MOVE AWAY. BREAK APART. BE ANNIHILATED. ALLOW THE SUN TO STRIKE THE SEED. THAT'S HOW YOU WERE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND LIGHT CAME UP OUT OF ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT WAS IT ANNIHILATED THAT OLD NATURE. I'M A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST JESUS. OLD THINGS HAVE NOT NOT BEEN PUT UNDER UNDER A CHAIN. THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY. &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW. WHY? BECAUSE SAY, "WELL, BUT I'VE STILL GOT MY FALLEN FLESH, MY BODY AND MY SPIRIT, MY 10 SENSES, YOU KNOW, AND 10 INLETS AND FIVE FIVE INLETS, FIVE OUTLETS." AND EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A NEW GOVERNOR. THERE'S A NEW KING IN THE HEART. THERE'S A NEW THRONE. THERE'S A NEW THINKING. THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO TAKE OVER. AND WHEN THE BODY WOULD GO BACK ITS OLD PATH, THAT NEW NATURE SAYS, "NO, SIR. YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THAT DIRECTION." WHEN THE BODY WOULD THINK THIS OR THINK THAT, AND THAT NEW NATURE SAYS, "CAST THAT DOWN. THAT WILL HAVE NO PLACE IN HERE. I WILL NOT SHARE MY DOMAIN WITH THE POWERS OF THE WORLD." I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THERE'S LIBERTY AND THERE'S FREEDOM IN THE HOLY GHOST. THAT YOU CAN KNOW IT TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO STRIVE, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PRESS, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LET THE WORD OF GOD DWELL IN YOU RICHLY. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TOOK BOTH SIDES OF THAT. YOU KNOW, THE HOW THAT RUTH he he I think it's uh I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE I BUT IT'S IN ALL THOSE MESSAGES and I've studied so DIFFERENT MANY OF THEM, BUT I I BELIEVE THERE IN IT'S IN uh I believe it's in Revelation 5 part two. I don't have the quote in front of ME WHERE HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT, you know, Ruth started out by working and he says she's doing her legalism. She's getting her works. And see, so justification, a lot OF TIMES WE GO JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, BAPTISM, the Holy Ghost. It's the Holy Ghost doing all of them. &gt;&gt; See, justification brings you to a saving grace and and THAT AND YOU REPENT OF YOUR SINS AND IT REMITS ALL YOUR PAST SINS. IT DOESN'T HELP YOU FOR THE FUTURE, but it but it but IT REMITS ALL OF YOUR PAST SINS. AND THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT KEEPS WORKING AND STARTS CLEANING UP YOUR LIFE. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID YOUR OLD YOUR OLD NATURE, YOUR OLD YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT CONVERTED YET. AND SO YOUR MIND IS STILL ENMITY. HE SAID, "SO FIRST THING HE HAS TO DO IS, YOU KNOW, YOU GO THERE INTO EZEKIEL AND HE'S GOING TO SPRINKLE CLEAN WATER UPON YOU AND HE'S GOING TO PUT A NEW SPIRIT ON YOU." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE HAS TO GET A NEW SPIRIT PUT ON YOU. THIS IS BEFORE HE SAYS, "I'LL PUT MY spirit in you." He puts a NEW SPIRIT ON HIM. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "SO YOU CAN GET ALONG WITH THE HOLY GHOST." AND YOU START GOING TO CHURCH AND YOU START CLEANING UP YOUR LIFE. AND AND BUT BUT REMEMBER THAT THE HOLY GHOST WILL THANK YOU, BROTHER MATT. THE HOLY GHOST WILL KEEP MOVING YOU IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE THE THE NEW BIRTH IS I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT IN YOU AND CAUSE YOU TO KEEP my word and my statutes. SEE, &gt;&gt; SO A LOT OF TIMES WE BREAK THAT DOWN OVER A LONG TIME AND SOMETIMES IT CAN GO FOR A WHILE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO. GOD IN A MOMENT, THOSE PEOPLE IN THE UPPER ROOM, THAT HAPPENED ALL THE THAT HAPPENED TO THEM IN A MOMENT WHEN THE DEVOUT JEWS SHOWED UP, THEY WERE ALREADY DEVOUT MEN. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SANCTIFYING AND THEY BECAME A BELIEVER AND WERE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEGAN TO TESTIFY. AND AND YOU FOLLOW ON IN THE VERSES, VERSE 39, 40, 41, AND 42, THEY THEY WERE BREAKING BREAD. THEY WERE IN CHURCH. THEY WERE LISTENING TO THE WORD. THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE APOSTLES DOCTRINE. THAT'S A SIGN OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A SIGN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST IS THAT YOU SIT IN A CHURCH FOR YEARS AND BELIEVE the truth of it, BUT THERE'S NO REAL EFFECTIVE CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU'RE STILL HALFWORLDLY AND HALF GODLY. IF THERE'S SUCH A such a a crazy thing, it it's it's it's I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THAT'S MISERY. THAT'S MISERY. DON'T LINGER THERE. MOVE ON. GO ON. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO BE HAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER SISTER JEAN. I TALKED TO HER THIS MORNING. I'll just give you an example of of that whole process, you know, because we HAVE A A PERFECT EXAMPLE HERE IN our assembly. Sister Jean who's been a believer now 64 years. She's 21-year-old young mother. AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU FIRST OF ALL AND SO I I THOUGHT I HAD IT STRAIGHT AND and I wanted to talk to her. I said, "Mom, can you take me back?" And and she gave me a quick, YOU KNOW, PRIMER ON HER LIFE, YOU KNOW, PREVIOUS STARTED OUT AS A YOUNG TEENAGE GIRL AND EVEN younger than that. And you know, I I SOME THINGS I WANT TO SAY HERE THAT FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU to understand Sister Jean was a North Carolina country girl. poor just a sassifrass North Carolina country girl where in those DAYS EVERYBODY USED FOUR-LETTER words everybody smoked it was North Carolina &gt;&gt; I mean that was like the the the smoking capital of the nation you KNOW AND RJ REYNOLDS AND ALL of those AND AND SO YOU KNOW SISTER JEAN GREW UP IN THAT environment she she made and and THIS WAS JUST AS A YOUNG GIRL NOT EVEN NOT EVEN A CHRISTIAN JUST AS A YOUNG GIRL YOU WEARING PANTS AND SHORTS AND CUTTING HER HAIR AND WEARING MAKEUP AND AND HER DADDY, MY GRANDPA, BOUGHT HER HER CIGARETTES. AND SISTER JEAN WAS SO POOR SHE HAD TO MAKE THEM LAST. SHE COULD NEVER THEY SHE HAD TO STRETCH THEM OUT. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS WAS THIS WAS THE EARLY 19, YOU KNOW, LATE 1940S, EARLY 1950S. They didn't even know &gt;&gt; that they were unhealthy. IT WASN'T EVEN A THING, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS WAS KIND OF THE CULTURE THAT SHE WAS RAISED up in. and she she made a pact with her girlfriend at the time in school, I think high school, AND THEY MADE A PACK THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO USE FOUR-LETTER WORDS. NOW, we're not talking about vulgar language. Sister Jean was never a vulgar. She was still she was never promiscuous. She was none of that. She was very decent young girl raised by my grandparents were good people and later came to be Christians themselves. And then you see the product we have today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO, SO, BUT AS A YOUNG GIRL, her and her girlfriend made a pack that if if any either one of them used a four-letter word, they would get slapped. Sister Jean, I said, "Did you get slapped?" Oh, I got slapped a a bunch of times. So, YOU KNOW, THEY INVENTED SLAPPING. THAT'S not new. That's that's these slapping competitions. and and IF SHE WOULD LET A WORD OUT, WHAMMY, YOU KNOW, AND AND AND BUT THEN SHE GOT TO HAVE PAYBACK ON HER GIRLFRIEND. AND SO AND AND SO AND SO, YOU KNOW, I SAID, "WELL, DID IT DID IT HOLD?" SHE SAYS, "NO, IT DIDN'T TAKE THAT FROM ME." SHE SAID, "AND EVEN WHEN I WHEN I GOT MARRIED AND JUST A young woman," she said, you know, and she she went another direction. she got married, we lost track. And she said that, SHE SAID, "FINALLY," SHE SAID, "I ME AND YOUR DAD, WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A BAPTIST church and we came under the preaching of the gospel." AND HER GRANDMOTHER GOT saved and her f her gr her her mother got saved and her father got saved and and they began to clean up the home and and these were just old country people and and so SISTER JEAN JUST A YOUNG WOMAN AND THEY COME INTO A BAPTIST CHURCH AND SHE COAST TO AN ALTAR AND SHE FALLS DOWN IN REPENTANCE THE HOLY SPIRIT IN A BAPTIST CHURCH CONVICTED her see AND SHE GAVE HER HEART TO THE LORD IN JUSTIFICATION REPENTED OF ALL OF HER SINS HANDS, MY FATHER ALONG WITH HER. And from that moment, from that moment, that that KIND OF LANGUAGE USAGE passed away from her. SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT the message yet. IMMEDIATELY, YOU KNOW, SHE STARTED TO BE CONVICTED UH ABOUT WEARING PANTS. AND SO, SHE STOPPED WEARING SHORTS AND SHE STOPPED AND and then and then the whole thing was AND I SAID, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT CUTTING YOUR HAIR?" SHE SAID, "OH, THAT WAS THE ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS." SHE SAID, "BECAUSE I always loved I always wanted long hair." She said, "I thought it looked so beautiful, but the trend of the day was to the bob and you cut it off or you know and and and it's convenient." And and and and she said, "WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE THAT THE BIBLE FORBID A WOMAN TO CUT HER HAIR," SHE SAID, "THAT WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF MY LIFE." SHE SAID, "I THOUGHT, PRAISE THE LORD. GOD WANTS IT. I WANT IT. LET'S DO IT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO SHE WENT FORWARD AND AND AND THEN YOU KNOW LATER ON SHE SHE FINDS OUT AND YOU KNOW BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT THAT BLUE STUFF AND she never was a a Jezebel type but she had some LIPSTICK AND SOME EYES SHADOW BUT SHE LOVED that blue. She just loved it. She just oh my goodness that is so beautiful. And then she SHE COMES INTO CONTACT AND THE LORD BEGAN TO CONVICT HER OF THAT. AND AWAY THAT WENT AND YOU KNOW AND AND AND THEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE GOT NEAR A BELIEVER AND AND THE WOMAN WALKED BY AND SAID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET ENOUGH OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE'LL TAKE THOSE BRIDGES AWAY FROM YOU AND PUT YOU IN A DRESS. THE PROBLEM WAS, YOU KNOW, SHE HAD ALMOST NO SHE HAD LIKE ONE DRESS. &gt;&gt; HER ENTIRE CLOSET WAS FULL OF FULL OF PANTS CUZ THAT WAS THE CULTURE. THAT'S HOW SHE GREW UP. SEE? And and but BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING PULLING HER. SOMETHING WAS SANCTIFYING HER. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? YOU KNOW, RUTH, BEFORE RUTH GOT BOAZ, SHE HAD THESE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING AND SHE HAD TO DEMONSTRATE. AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, IT MAY ALL HAPPEN IN A MOMENT. OR LIKE SISTER JEAN, GOD TOOK HER AND MY DAD THROUGH NINE OR 10 MONTHS CLEANING THEM UP, CLEANING THEM UP, CLEANING THEM UP, TAKING THIS AWAY, THAT AWAY. AND FINALLY, WHEN MY AUNT MARGARET GOT HIM INTO A MESSAGE CHURCH, MY MOM SAYS, "AS SOON AS I WALKED IN THE DOOR, I KNEW I WAS HOME." AND RIGHT AWAY, SHE WANTED MORE OF THE GOD, SHE WANTED THE HOLY GHOST. RIGHT AWAY, HER HAIR IS GROWING, THE MAKEUP'S GONE, THE CIGARETTES ARE GONE, THE CURSING IS GONE, THE PANTS ARE GONE. SHE'S AT SHE'S STANDING IN A POOL OF WATER WANTING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. NINE MONTHS PREGNANT WITH ME. AND WHEN SHE COME UP, WHEN SHE WENT DOWN INTO THAT WATER AND ME WITH HER, SHE COME UP AND ME WITH HER, BAPTIZED IN THE HOLY GHOST. I WAS I WAS IN THE HOLY GHOST IN MY MOTHER'S WOMB. AMEN. PRAISE THE LORD. I'M KEN TO JOHN. &gt;&gt; And I'm HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. YOU SEE HOW THAT WORKS? YOU SEE HOW GOD TOOK HER OVER NINE OR 10 MONTHS AND SAVED HER, CLEANED HER UP, CLEANED HER UP, AND THEN FILLED HER WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND FROM THAT HOUR NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM FLIPS THE OTHER SIDE. NOW RUTH IS RESTING. NOW IT'S NOT HER TRYING TO DO IT. IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT LIVING INSIDE HER. AND 64 YEARS LATER, SHE'S NEVER DESIRED IT AGAIN. SHE'S A SHE HER SHE'S LET HER LIGHT SHINE TO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S 85 YEARS OLD LIKE CALEB. JUST LIKE CALEB, SHE'S JUST AS STRONG IN HER FAITH TODAY AND READY TO GO TO WAR AGAINST SATAN AND READY TO WITNESS TO ANYONE WHO WILL GET WITHIN TWO FEET OF HER. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THERE'S POWER IN THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WAY GOD THAT'S THE WAY HE RODE THROUGH MY MOM AND DAD. SEE? SO, SO WE FIND THEN THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HERE, AND I'M GOING TO turn turn for the finish line. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN THE ONCOMING STORM, WE'VE got an oncoming storm. The church doesn't make you a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church only helps you to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. helps you to remain &gt;&gt; what you've been born into. &gt;&gt; So I would think that it should be a priority. &gt;&gt; The church doesn't make you a Christian. The church only helps you to be a Christian. Helps you to remain what you've been born into. Helps you to contain your experience while you're fellowshipping together with brethren of like precious faith. Because that's so well said you can't even improve on that. Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom. Look what kind of a life they were living. And Jesus compared that day to this day. Sinful. WATCH WHEN LOT WENT TO TELL HIS PEOPLE. They laughed of him. Laughed at him. Made fun of him. The sins of the city vexed his righteous soul. The angel's message didn't stir them. had no effect on them. But they were asked to come out because judgment was upon the city and God was going to bring a storm of fire upon the city and they refused to walk. They refused to come out. They were satisfied with their sins. &gt;&gt; That takes my breath away. I can't I can't imagine that someone can look at the kind of day that we live in today and have the kind of word that God has sent us in this hour. What a contrast between the word and the world. And how anyone can come face to face with the word and all of its purity and all of its cleanness and all of its wholesomeness and all of its life and its eternal life and its joy and it and and its beauty and the fragrance of beauty and holiness and somehow still want to choose the world. But I will tell you that your fallen nature is trying to do that. And God is trying to get you to be like Ruth and just start moving toward him. And he'll start working in your life and start cleaning you up and and and and and if you'll and and as you follow, if we we will know the Lord if we follow on to know him. See? And so as you follow him, friends, he'll take you from justification, sanctification to the new birth and beyond and on. AND YOU'LL BECOME, AS PAUL WAS SAYING TO US, YOU'LL BECOME BLAMELESS. YOU'LL BECOME PURE. YOU'LL BECOME A BRIGHT AND SHINING LIGHT. THERE'S A JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME. AND IT'S AND IT'S AND IT'S YOU'RE JOURNEYING IT UNTIL WE'RE TAKEN HOME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's THE IT'S THE LACK OF seeing the oncoming storm. It's the nonchalant, NON-CARE ABOUT JUST LET'S JUST KEEP GOING. THE WORLD will just keep going. It won't. It can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are so many prophecies that are taking place right now. THINK AND AND YOU KNOW, WE WE HAVE SUCH a a more sure word of prophecy because there are so many things that WERE PROPHESIED TO TAKE PLACE RIGHT NEAR THE END TIME. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CAN SEE THEM ALREADY started &gt;&gt; and we can see them in development. And we and we GOT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AT an alarmingly fast rate. AND I I WAS saying to you, you know, at at the again, I don't want this to be an INFORMATION SHOW, BUT BUT YOU KNOW, I MEAN, EVEN EVEN governments and and and and the markets and everyone and the gold standard and and and and um Bitcoin and things like that, you can't believe the whole world is transitioning rapidly AND AND CATHOLIC NATIONS ARE STARTING TO GATHER UP GOLD. AND BROTHER BRANDAMAN SHOWED US IN THE BIBLE, HE SAYS THE JEWS, Wall Street, they hold the the paper, the bonds, AND THAT THAT THE VATICAN CONTROLS THE METAL, THE GOLD, &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT JUST ALL UH IN VATICAN CITY, IT'S BECAUSE LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THAT WHEN THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT THAT THE WHOLE world shall WORSHIP THE BEAST, THE WHOLE world &gt;&gt; shall worship the beast and they'll ALL GIVE THEIR POWER OVER TO THE BEAST. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO NOT DO IT. IF THEY WANT TO STAY A NATION, IF THEY WANT TO STAY A BUSINESS, IF THEY WANT TO KEEP FOOD ON THEIR TABLE, I'M SO GLAD I'M ESCAPING THAT. I'M SO GLAD I HAVE A THIRD EXODUS THAT IS UPON ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH MY FRIENDS, I DON'T WANT TO GET SO SIDETRACKED, BUT THESE THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AND THEY ACTUALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONE OF THE MOST PROBABLY IF NOT THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD. NOT BECAUSE HE'S SOME GREAT GUY. &gt;&gt; THE MAN IS QUITE VILE. AND A LOT OF THE LEADERS of of tech, EVEN ONES THAT I FOLLOW, THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE VILE. AND AND I AND I DON'T FOLLOW THEM OUT OF SOME SOME FANBOYISM. I FOLLOW THEM JUST TO SO THAT I CAN SEE WHERE WE ARE IN PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; BUT AS SOON AS THEY THEY GET YOU GET A LITTLE BUBBLE, THEY'LL BURST IT ON YOU. AND AND I JUST REALIZE THERE'S NO CLEAN PLACE EXCEPT RIGHT HERE. THERE'S JUST NO CLEAN PLACE. YOU CAN YOU CAN BE A FAN OF WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU CAN GET INFORMATION. YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER. BUT THERE'S NO CLEAN PLACE. THE BIBLE SAID ALL OF THEIR TABLES ARE FULL OF VOMIT. &gt;&gt; OH FRIENDS, I I WANT TO I WANT TO SEE YOU DRAWING FROM THE TREE OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; You're never YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ESCAPE THE EFFECTS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. YOU MAKE USE of them. This is the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; This is the tree OF KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS THIS IS A BOOK BY A PUBLISHER PRINTED ON PAPER AND PUT IN A BOOK AND SOLD &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT BROTHER BRANDON TALKS ABOUT HOW GOD GAVE INSPIRATION for that BECAUSE OF THE REFORMATION THEY HAD TO HAVE A WAY TO MASSPRODUCE NEW BIBLES. BUT LISTEN FRIENDS, IT IT ALL COMES FROM THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE AND civilization which is of THE DEVIL AND WILL PERISH. &gt;&gt; IT NOT WILL PERISH, IT IS PERISHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO THE WHOLE WORLD IS CHANGING SO RAPIDLY. And I can I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE ANTICHRIST SYSTEM is moving to where IT CONTROLS AND CAN BY COMMERCE and through craft force the world into submission. &gt;&gt; It's already happened. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING and it will continue to happen. This isn't a fairy tale. The world is transitioning and you can't stay here. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY OUT IS UP. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE ONCOMING storm and brother Brandham, you know, he he TALKS ABOUT HERE, HE SAYS THEY WERE SATISFIED IN THEIR SINS. You know, we have let me just give you this final key. I I I I wanted to read I wanted just to read you real quick before I forget it. A good friend of mine, Brother Mark Coffee, transcribes all the sermons I preach here. Helps me, especially it's so helpful when I'm in the middle of series and I'm wondering what have I preached, what have I covered because I'm preaching online and sometimes I go back and forth and lose track of where I'm at. And uh he we were talking and he he said this in an email to me this morning. He'd listened to part seven of uh my recent series and he says changes happening in the world now which are happening at a very fast pace and it is happening openly and watched worldwide. You can see the world leaders are shaking their heads trying to understand what is going on in the world. That shows that it's not them doing it because they don't know what is happening either and things are really starting to move in place quickly on both sides. Look up. And I said, ' That's well said, brother Mark. When I think about here, we have a mere a mere scientific prediction of a storm. Said, "Well, no, the radar, it's there. You can see it." Well, they're but they predicted it was coming. They're predicting where it'll go. &gt;&gt; It's all just, you know, scientific calculation and prediction. reliable but not foolproof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's gotten way better. Entire states declare in advance of it even arriving. THEY HEAR THE PREDICTIONS BEFORE IT EVEN GETS THERE. ENTIRE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE DECLARING STATES OF EMERGENCY. I I looked at the map. Half of this went all the way across the lower southern and upper Midwest and up into the north of states already who had went into states of emergency. Federal agencies already start gearing up for disaster relief. predictions while helpful and they've COME A LONG WAY WITH THEIR ACCURACY, but they're they're BASED MERELY ON SCIENTIFIC calculations with known margins of error. Those those margins of error are known to exist. Why you think they have so many models? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, well, they have the American model and the European model. That's a such an oversimplification. They have they have over a hundred various in things that they use to track and and and and 40% will agree with 60%. And and the science contradicts itself sometimes sometimes and all they can do is make their their best educated guess. And you know, EVERYONE WHEN THIS STARTS HAPPENING AND STATES ARE DECLARING EMERGENCIES and meteorologists ARE GIVING THESE CALCULATED MODELS AND AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ON THE move and everyone is jumping through rings of fire TO GET READY AND TAKE PRECAUTIONS and they THEY MAKE SACRIFICES AND THEY OPERATE IN WAYS THAT THEY HUMAN BEINGS OPERATE IN WAYS WE WOULDN'T NORMALLY OPERATE. You know, Monday morning WE GET UP, WE GO TO WORK, HERE'S MY JOB, HERE'S MY WE GO to school, we come home, WE EAT. NOW EVERYBODY'S SCRAMBLING. YOU KNOW, THE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE CLOSED DOWN. THERE'S ICE COMING. SCHOOLS ARE SHUT DOWN. WE WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO DO? WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO DO? WE HAVE THIS PREPARATION, THAT PREPARATION. THE PEOPLE UP IN THERE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR NO POWER AND, YOU KNOW, and and frozen roads. &gt;&gt; AND SO, AND IT'S ALL BASED MERELY ON SCIENTIFIC CALCULATIONS WITH KNOWN ERRORS. THEY AND THEY COMPARE THESE VARIOUS COMPUTER MODELS WEEKS IN ADVANCE. AND EVERYONE IS TAKING PRECAUTIONS AND EVERYONE IS MAKING SACRIFICES AND EVERYONE IS OPERATING IN UNUSUAL WAYS. And yet we have scriptural prophecy. &gt;&gt; AN ELEMENT, MAY I SAY, OF A SINGLE OMNISIENT, ALL- KNOWING, ALL POWERFUL MIND WHO'S KNOWN TO NEVER BE WRONG, &gt;&gt; WHO'S KNOWN TO HAVE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE. AND YOU YOU THINK AN ONCOMING STORM, THE ONE THAT'S HERE IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO THE ONE THIS ONE IS PROPHESYING. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THIS ISN'T A COMPUTER MODEL. THIS ISN'T MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS. THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD. THE EARTH IS PASSING AWAY FROM ITS CURRENT SITUATION. AND A NEW DAY IS DAWNING. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WANT IT TO MOVE THROUGH MY LIFE. I WANT TO MOVE ACCORDING TO WHAT THE WORD HAS TOLD ME. I WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHERE IT TELLS ME TO BE CAREFUL. PREPARE WHERE IT TELLS ME TO BE PREPARED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is not a time to be slowing down or letting the pied piper of Leodysa &gt;&gt; put you to sleep with his music and his entertainment and HIS RECREATION AND HIS EDUCATION AND HIS CIVILIZATION AND HIS GOVERNMENT AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. THESE ARE NECESSARY elements to life in the 21st century. But I plan to be alive in the 22nd &gt;&gt; and 23rd and 24th and 25th and 26th. I'll still be alive in the 27th. I will never have died and I'll still be alive. &gt;&gt; Is that your desire? Friends, this is a a year that's going to be seismic. And I I say that with a lot of consideration. I don't just throw that out there. It's going to certainly within the next 36 months you will see changes like you can't even imagine. And it's not coming. I cannot underscore that enough. It's not coming. It's happening. &gt;&gt; It's already moving. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I like I say, I could just take my whole I could take another hour, two hours and just update you on how it's moving and where it's headed as best we can tell. All I But but you know what it would be? It' be a mere prediction. But let's stick with what we know to be true. &gt;&gt; I know if it doesn't end today and it doesn't end tomorrow, it's still ending. &gt;&gt; I know that when it transitions, I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do I know that? because I have allowed this to become my guide. &gt;&gt; I have believed the report. They asked Jesus, "How can we do the works of God?" His answer was straightforward and o and overly simplistic. When they said, "How can we do the works of God?" Jesus said, "Believe on him whom God hath sent." This is the works of God. &gt;&gt; I want to believe on everything that he has sent to me in this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you, Bethl Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. So, that's where we are, friends, in 2026. We're going forward. I want you to be in prayer over the projects that we laid out, my own personal projects that I'm working on. Um, whether they'll ever get completed, I have no idea. Hopefully not. I'm just being quite serious. Hopefully not, &gt;&gt; you know, and whatever I have of them, maybe somebody will find in inner ears and maybe figure out a way to not take the mark of the beast. I don't know. I've got a a a bookcase full of eternal life words. &gt;&gt; I It was so beautiful to me. I was unpacking and I had had to wait till I got my bookcase that I had ordered and and I was just unpacking all my precious books and and everything and my old Bibles and I was looking through old notes and my such nostalgia and it's hard to believe that we're here and that was decades and in the making and and uh and it it just it just u it's hard to stay a breast of it but I just thought Lord and I told I told my wife I said cuz my daughter-in-law is coming in and she's kind of the boss of how things get decorated in the house. And so I said, "Tell Martha, do not move my book. She can do anything else. Move any direct decoration. Decorate how she wants to. Nothing pink, but otherwise she can decorate it how she wants, but do not touch my books. They are sacrosan, never to be touched." And so I love them. I have them on display. I'm so proud of them. Amen. And I thought, my goodness, I've read through or entirely almost every book on this. It was stacks and stacks of them. And you just accumulate life going forward, don't you? You know, and you look back and you go, "My oh." And I when I look back, I say, "It's been worth it. It's been worth it." Brother Jason, are you are you satisfied having been a Christian all these years? My only regret is I didn't do it way sooner. I love the Lord. I love the word. I love his people. I love the promises of God there. Yay and amen. and they're trustworthy. Amen. Praise the Lord. I want you to bow your heads with me. Father, we thank you for this word today. Thank you for the strength I feel in body that I felt ministering. And I pray you'll be with me now afterwards, Lord, and keep me from the hand of the enemy. We have others who are sick and suffering. And we have needs before you, Lord. You're well aware. And we're looking to see you move in a mighty way on some of these needs, very serious needs. Our loved ones here at Bethl Tabernacle, we want to see them in complete victory, Lord. And I pray that you will give us fresh vision going forward these projects, Lord, that we have going on at Bethl Tabernacle, whether it's uh a new school, whether it's a fellowship hall and church renovations, whether it's missionary work abroad, Lord, what whatever whatever all of the different things that we have going on, may you bless it. May you bless me in my personal endeavors and keep us true and keep us faithful. Your mercies were new to me this morning and I love the thought that they'll be new again tomorrow morning. May I ever may I ever avail myself of all that you have given and done. When I think about the record of the saints down through the ages, Lord, I want to take my place. want to take my place, Lord, in that long line of warriors that have successfully walked through their entire life, Lord, from the day they knew you going forward now, Lord, all the way to the consummation of their life or the consummation of the ages. There's going to be an age where there will be those who are alive and remain. There's going to be some people who are still alive and remain at the coming of the Lord. I want to be one of them. I believe I will be. But Lord, I I want to make sure that my life is worthy right now. May you grant it to us today. May you let the word fall that's fell into the hearts of the people here and across the internet. Lord, may it be quickened by the Holy Spirit. That's what a prophet taught us. That the word is unsealed when a seal is broken and what's on the inside is re revealed. And then down comes an anointing upon that word to make it live. I want it to live, Lord. May you grant it to us. I commit this whole audience and all of the unseen audience into your hands. Our physical needs, our financial needs, our emotional, mental, spiritual, whatever those needs are. May you be very gracious to us, Lord, and strengthen us. We pray again, Lord, for all those in the path of the storm. Keep them safe. keep them under your care in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing, brother. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; I want that holy life. I want that holy life. Sing it. &gt;&gt; I want that holy way. Let me hear it. &gt;&gt; I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy holy. I want that holy loss burning deep down in my soul. I want Lord Jesus Christ to take complete control. I want that holy life. So beautiful. &gt;&gt; I want that holy life. &gt;&gt; Do you want I want that holy life. Is that a great desire? &gt;&gt; I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that again. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy life. Bow our heads one more time. You give me just a moment to be obedient and sensitive to the Holy Spirit. The Lord informs me that there's some in here that, you know, the word found you out today. You know, it did. Not going to call anybody out. I don't know who it is, but the Holy Spirit's speaking to my heart now. It might be someone who's coming through the process of justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and you're on your path. And maybe you just want to say, "Lord, give me strength to complete my journey all the way to the new birth." Yeah. Now, see there, I didn't even ask for hands and hands going up. Keep those heads bowed. Maybe you're a believer full of the Holy Ghost, but you know that we're still here and you're not home yet, and you want strength to redouble. Oh, Lord God, I like Brother Brandham. Let me raise my both hands to God. Let me live like that. Let that be me. Let let he and his word be my whole life. Father, we're giving everyone an opportunity under the sound of my voice. Often, Lord, I would sing a few times and turn away and leave the worship leader leading worship and the people singing, take a seat and just seemed like, Lord, I felt a prompt from the Holy Spirit to give everyone an opportunity to reach out to you right now for everything that you need. And you know the word, you know that, like the Bible says, we look in the word and it's like a mirror. We actually see who we really are, not who we fool ourselves that we are. We see our weaknesses. We see our faults and failures. We know that we want more of God's life. But how to like Paul, when I would do good, evil is present. How to perform it? Paul said, I thank God through Jesus Christ. Lord, let everyone be encouraged today who wants that that greater life, that holy life, more of you. Whatever journey, wherever they're at on their journey, Lord, whether they're working out their own salvation with fear and trembling before they are born again in the spirit of God, or whether they're working out their continuing to work out their salvation with fear and trembling on the other side of the Holy Ghost, I pray you will give them fresh courage today, Lord. Give them fresh courage and a fresh determination to press forward and free themselves from the grip of the enemy by the power of the Holy Spirit. It's not about human will, Lord. It's not gritted teeth. It's not that. It's all about surrender. May there be a fresh surrender. I raise up my hands, Lord. Let there be a fresh surrender right here in 2026. Lord, let there be a fresh surrender right here at the beginning of the of the year. I pray you'll grant it to us in Jesus name. That holy life. Amen. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy life. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saint. &gt;&gt; I want that holy God bless you to be dismissed. Give me that other life. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy life. I want that holy ghost burning deep down in my soul. I want Lord Jesus Christ to take complete control. I want that whole life. I have a vision, a vision in my view. I'm pressing my way, trying to make it through. There's a merry supper that's been called by the lamb. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. Yes, I am. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that home. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy life. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that whole holy life. Holy life. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that save a rich bl like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. was blind, but now I see. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransom me. Like a flood and mercy reigns. Unending love. Amazing grace. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my savior, your ransom me. And like a flood, his mercy raised uning love.
