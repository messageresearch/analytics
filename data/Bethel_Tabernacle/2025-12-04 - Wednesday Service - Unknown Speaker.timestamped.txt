[5:08] [music]
[5:19] Oh,

[6:50] [music]
[6:53] &gt;&gt; We just stand to our feet. We'll have a
[6:54] [music] word of prayer.
[6:57] God is good. Amen.
[7:00] Aren't you happy to be in the house of
[7:02] the [music] Lord?
[7:04] Amen. I was going to read Psalms 134. If
[7:07] you could get a somebody [music] to come
[7:08] up and put a battery in this and get it
[7:10] going, I'd appreciate it. Anybody,
[7:12] please. Thank you.
[7:17] [music] In the book of Psalms, it reads
[7:19] on this wise Psalms 134.
[7:23] It says, "Behold, bless ye the Lord, all
[7:28] ye servants of the Lord, which by
[7:30] [music] night stand in the house of the
[7:32] Lord.
[7:34] Lift up your hands in the sanctuary,
[7:37] [music] and bless the Lord, the Lord
[7:40] that made heaven and earth bless thee
[7:43] out of Zion."
[7:45] You want to bless the Lord. Amen. Not
[7:48] just with your hands lifted up, but with
[7:50] your [music] heart. Right.
[7:53] Amen. Let's just say a word of prayer
[7:54] and bow our heads.
[7:57] Almighty God,
[7:59] Father, it's a privilege and an honor,
[8:01] Lord, to be able to come before your
[8:04] throne tonight, Lord, asking for your
[8:06] blessings upon this service, Lord. May
[8:10] you speak to the hearts of your people
[8:12] tonight. May you just anoint the words
[8:15] that [music] are spoken, Father, and may
[8:17] they just come down and just [music]
[8:19] water our our ground and our heart,
[8:22] Father, that you just may stir us. We
[8:26] can look to you, Lord, in all of our
[8:29] times of need. May our hearts truly be
[8:32] given over to you, Lord. We are so
[8:35] [music] thankful your word and thankful
[8:37] for all it does for us and the life
[8:40] behind [music] the name Lord. Oh Lord,
[8:44] your words are living water to us. We
[8:48] just pray now that you'd bless [music]
[8:49] this service
[8:51] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ our God
[8:54] and our King.
[8:56] We just love you so much.
[8:59] Amen.
[9:05] Amen.
[9:10] Did you get it? Thank you. Praise the
[9:13] Lord.
[9:15] Testing. All right.
[9:18] [clears throat]
[9:19] For as the deer
[9:23] panteth for
[9:26] the water, so my soul
[9:30] longeth after
[9:33] thee.
[9:37] [music]
[9:38] And you alone [singing]
[9:42] are my heart's
[9:44] desire
[9:46] and I [music] long
[9:49] to worship
[9:52] [music] thee.
[9:56] And you
[9:58] alone
[10:00] are my strength, [singing and music]
[10:03] my shield.
[10:05] To you alone
[10:10] does my spirit
[10:13] yield.

[36:17] tonight in the house of the Lord. So
[36:19] honored uh to have brother Alex Mgalis
[36:22] with us. Amen. Brother Alex attends
[36:24] Brother [music] Wayne Lawson's church
[36:25] there in uh cold Ohio. This ain't cold,
[36:28] y'all. I'm just going to go and tell you
[36:30] right now. Um they got there's there's
[36:32] uh they got quite a bit colder weather
[36:34] there. So we won't [music] complain
[36:36] about uh what we call cold around here.
[36:39] But I just want to feel the warmth of
[36:41] the Holy Spirit. Tell you what, we live
[36:43] in a bitter cold world. Amen. The world
[36:45] is cold and it's [music] getting colder.
[36:47] Lord, I'm glad we got a place we can go
[36:49] to. Amen. To feel the warmth of the Holy
[36:51] Spirit. We want Brother [music] Alex to
[36:53] just have his complete liberty. Let the
[36:56] Holy Spirit have his liberty tonight.
[36:57] How many want that? Amen. You know that
[37:00] the prophet taught us we control, we
[37:01] [music] operate the gift that God places
[37:04] in a person's life. How many knows
[37:05] Brother Brandon said that?
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And so we we really control the outcome
[37:10] of what we get or we don't get [music]
[37:12] out of church, out of this sermon. Amen.
[37:14] I I I'm positive our brother has
[37:17] prepared [music] himself and laid before
[37:19] the Lord and asked God to give him
[37:21] something that would be specific, would
[37:22] be in season, [music] amen, would be in
[37:25] time, amen, for your need. So, we just
[37:27] want to Amen. make our [music] brother
[37:29] feel welcome, but more than that, make
[37:31] the Holy Spirit feel welcome. Let's sing
[37:33] it one more time as we invite our
[37:35] brother Alex [music] to come. Lord,
[37:38] prepare.
[37:40] Could you raise your hands as you sing
[37:41] it now?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:42] &gt;&gt; to be a sanctuary,
[37:49] pure
[37:50] and [music and singing] holy,
[37:55] tried [singing]
[37:56] and true, [music]
[37:59] with with thanksgiving,
[38:01] with [singing]
[38:04] [music]
[38:09] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[38:14] &gt;&gt; sanctuary
[38:15] [music]
[38:19] for I wonder could we [music] just do
[38:22] that one more time tonight? Let's sing
[38:23] it once more. Oh Lord, [music]
[38:26] prepare [singing] me
[38:30] to be a sanctuary.
[38:35] [music]
[38:37] Pure and holy,
[38:43] [music] tried and true,
[38:49] and with [music]
[38:50] thanksgiving
[38:54] I'll be [singing] unliving
[39:00] [music]
[39:01] sanctuary.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; [music]
[39:07] &gt;&gt; for
[39:09] you. [music]
[39:12] Amen. I believe that's the key tonight.
[39:13] Amen. We uh we we always look forward to
[39:16] having a visitation from the Lord, but I
[39:18] want to be a habitation. Amen. I don't
[39:20] just want him to come and go in my life
[39:22] and come and do a few things and leave,
[39:24] but I want him to have a residence.
[39:25] Amen. Is that is that your desire
[39:27] tonight? Well, I believe that's that's
[39:29] the Christian life. Amen. So we just
[39:31] thank God for his unfailing presence. We
[39:33] don't have to fear to go anywhere or do
[39:35] anything because that unfailing presence
[39:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ is always with
[39:39] us. Amen.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; And uh I trust you brought your lick of
[39:42] fire tonight. We just want to greet you
[39:44] on behalf of the church in the name of
[39:46] the Lord Jesus Christ. It's good to see
[39:48] so many different familiar faces. If I
[39:50] start taking time to talk to
[39:52] individuals, uh well I don't know how
[39:54] much time I have but probably not that
[39:55] much time. So but you all know who you
[39:57] are. God bless different ones. It is
[39:59] really terribly good to see the Crossman
[40:01] family tonight especially. Haven't seen
[40:02] them in a while. So, we just appreciate
[40:05] so many different uh familiar faces as I
[40:07] said. So, um we'll try not to prolong
[40:09] the time too much tonight. I just invite
[40:11] you to turn with me this evening into
[40:12] the book of St. Matthew and we're going
[40:14] to look in the second chapter tonight.
[40:17] And um I pray that uh you know, you're
[40:22] talking about Ohio being cold. That's
[40:23] that's true. Um, you know, I used to
[40:26] feel like a real big shot because where
[40:27] I'm going back a single digit. And now I
[40:29] just the older I get to realize I feel
[40:31] kind of foolish about the whole thing.
[40:32] Why? Why didn't I just move? You know,
[40:35] you know, when you're young, you I'm
[40:36] tough. I can handle anything. Man,
[40:37] that's that's that's for young foolish
[40:40] people. I don't got nothing to prove
[40:41] anymore. I like being warm. So So
[40:44] God bless you. You're you're blessed to
[40:46] be here where it's not below freezing
[40:49] tonight. So I hope I take that fire back
[40:52] with me because I'm going to need it.
[40:54] All right. Well, Matthew chapter 2,
[40:55] we're just going to read the first 18
[40:56] verses here, and we'll have a word of
[40:58] prayer after that. The scripture says
[41:00] this. Now, when Jesus was born in
[41:02] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[41:04] the king, behold, there came wise men
[41:06] from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
[41:08] "Where is he that is born king of the
[41:11] Jews? For we have seen his star in the
[41:13] east, and are come to worship him?" When
[41:16] Herod the king had heard these things,
[41:18] he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with
[41:21] him. So, this got around pretty quick.
[41:23] And when he had gathered all the chief
[41:25] priests and scribes of the people
[41:27] together, he demanded of them where
[41:29] Christ should be born. And they said
[41:32] unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for
[41:34] thus it is written by the prophet," it's
[41:36] in the book of Micah, by the way, "and
[41:38] thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art
[41:40] not the least among the princes of
[41:42] Judah. For out of thee shall come a
[41:44] governor that shall rule my people
[41:46] Israel." Then Herod, when he had privy
[41:50] called the wise men, inquired of them
[41:52] diligently
[41:53] what time the star appeared. And he sent
[41:56] them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and
[41:58] search diligently for the young child.
[42:00] And when ye have found him, bring me
[42:02] word again that I may come and worship
[42:05] him also." Spoilers, he wasn't going to
[42:08] go worship him. That wasn't actually
[42:09] what he was about. [laughter]
[42:11] [gasps] And when he had heard when they
[42:13] had heard the king, they departed. I
[42:15] like this part here. And lo, the star
[42:18] which they saw on the east went before
[42:20] them till it came and stood over where
[42:22] the young child was. When they saw the
[42:26] star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
[42:29] joy. And when they were come into the
[42:31] house, they saw the young child with
[42:33] Mary his mother, and fell down and
[42:35] worshiped him. And when they had opened
[42:37] their treasures, they presented unto him
[42:39] gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrr.
[42:42] And being warned of God in a dream that
[42:44] they should not return to Herod, they
[42:46] departed into their own country another
[42:49] way. And when they were departed,
[42:51] behold, the angel of the Lord appearth
[42:53] to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise,
[42:55] and take the young child and his mother,
[42:57] and flee into Egypt, and be thou there
[43:00] until I bring thee word. For Herod will
[43:03] seek the young child to destroy him."
[43:05] When he arose, he took the young child
[43:07] and his mother by night, and departed
[43:09] into Egypt, and was there until the
[43:11] death of Herod, that it might be
[43:13] fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord
[43:15] by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt
[43:18] have I called my son." Then Herod, when
[43:21] he saw that he was mocked of the wise
[43:23] men, was exceeding wroth, and sent
[43:25] forth, and slew all the children that
[43:28] were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
[43:30] thereof from two years old and under,
[43:33] according to the time which he had
[43:35] diligently inquired of the wise men.
[43:38] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
[43:40] by Jeremy the prophet. I want you to
[43:42] notice how many times the scriptur is
[43:43] telling you, thus it was fulfilled. I'm
[43:45] going to come back this, but scripture
[43:46] after scripture is being fulfilled in
[43:48] what we would look at as a tragedy.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; But yet, God has ordained this for a
[43:52] purpose. Notice in Rama, there was a
[43:54] voice heard, lamentation and weeping and
[43:57] great mourning. Rachel weeping for her
[44:00] children and would not be comforted
[44:02] because they are not. I just invite you
[44:05] to bow your heads with me for a word of
[44:07] prayer here as we look unto the author
[44:10] now. Our heavenly father, we have read
[44:12] this word which has been preserved for
[44:14] us. Lord, it's more than just a a
[44:16] historical document to us tonight, but
[44:18] we're aware that the author of these
[44:21] words is in this place tonight. We've
[44:24] come into a divine audience. And Lord,
[44:26] as we bow our heads, we just ask now
[44:28] that you'd come and take these words and
[44:30] speak to the needs and the hearts of
[44:32] these your children. Lord, come and do
[44:34] and speak that which only you can do.
[44:36] May it be a blessing. May it be a help
[44:38] to your children as they're here, as our
[44:41] brother said, in this dark, cold world.
[44:43] We're so grateful to have a fire, not a
[44:45] painted fire, but a fire that gives
[44:47] warmth and light and revelation and
[44:49] strength to the hearts of your children
[44:51] tonight. Lord, help me as a man to move
[44:53] completely out of the way now. And may
[44:55] all these things that are done for the
[44:56] help of these your children, may you
[44:58] receive unto yourself great glory and
[45:01] honor and praise for all these things.
[45:03] for we commit it to you now in the name
[45:05] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And
[45:08] the bride says,
[45:09] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. You may be seated
[45:11] this evening. I'd like to take this
[45:13] thought uh why it had to be Magi. Of
[45:16] course, Brother Be takes many different
[45:18] types of uh sermons throughout the the
[45:21] Christmas season. I guess I'll just call
[45:22] it what it is, but I don't know where
[45:24] we're at with that. So, I'm just going
[45:25] to go ahead and go here. But [laughter]
[45:28] but during this time of the year that
[45:30] happens once a year as it's apt to
[45:32] happen, he takes several different
[45:33] thoughts on it. And uh he preaches, you
[45:36] know, brother Bam talks about why little
[45:38] Bethlehem and and brother Bam goes into
[45:39] great lengths to talk about why God
[45:42] chose Bethlehem as the birthplace of
[45:43] Christ as the scripture fortell. He he
[45:46] does it for several different reasons.
[45:47] Brother Bam talks about you know the
[45:49] name Bethlehem talking about the house
[45:51] of bread or the house of God's bread. It
[45:53] speaks of its purpose and of God's
[45:55] purpose because Christ of course he's
[45:57] the true bread that descends out of
[45:58] heaven. Amen. Of course, him being the
[46:00] son of David also by ancestry. David
[46:03] hails back to Bethlehem. And and God I I
[46:06] I love this. You know, God is showing
[46:08] his humility to have Jesus come in such
[46:11] a lowly and a humble manner. Amen. Uh
[46:14] men would have thought perhaps that
[46:15] Messiah should come in a more dignified
[46:17] manner. Amen. He need to have him in a
[46:19] nice bright place. I'm going to take
[46:21] this off now. You know, like I'm in
[46:22] Ohio, I guess, but it's not quite that
[46:24] hot either. Praise Man, that was really
[46:27] thoughtful. Thank you, man. It's harder
[46:29] to get out of the older I get for some
[46:31] reason. Anyway, you're not here to hear
[46:33] about that tonight. But, uh, it's
[46:35] talking about the humility of it. Amen.
[46:36] Men would have thought perhaps Messiah
[46:38] should have come from a more dignified
[46:40] manner or a greater pomp. But, it what's
[46:42] interesting, God has no such need. Amen.
[46:44] God doesn't need the the biggest palace
[46:47] or what we think is impressive. Amen.
[46:49] because the glory of God is not found in
[46:51] those kind of circumstances or those
[46:53] settings. So, uh for for God, what is a
[46:55] manger and he different from a palace?
[46:57] Amen. So God, he he shows us and we you
[47:01] know the scripture testifies that we
[47:02] know that the foolishness of God is
[47:04] greater than the wisdom of men. Amen.
[47:07] But I believe it's evident when we look
[47:08] at this, if you really consider it in
[47:10] choosing such a setting, we see the very
[47:12] wisdom of God. We know God's revealed in
[47:15] simplicity, but he's also hidden in
[47:17] simplicity. Is that right? You say,
[47:18] "What do you mean by that?" Well, the
[47:20] Bible tells us it was the wisdom of God
[47:22] to to do it the way that he did it.
[47:23] Amen. In other words, he brings Christ
[47:25] into this world in a manger. And it's a
[47:27] setting that the ambitious and the
[47:30] powerful are absent. The Bible tells if
[47:32] the princes of this world had known,
[47:35] they would have crucified him. And they
[47:36] would they would have not crucified him,
[47:38] rather. Amen. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE
[47:39] ALLOWED HIM TO FULFILL this purpose. AND
[47:41] SO GOD HIDES things from the wise and
[47:44] the prudent. But there's a an elected
[47:46] group of people that he reveals him to.
[47:48] Amen. And so GOD CHOOSES TO TO PLACE
[47:51] CHRIST NOT IN A PLACE OF POLITICS or of
[47:55] men's ambition or seats of authority,
[47:58] but in a manger. Amen. He He He's
[48:00] keeping him FROM A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT
[48:02] WOULD HAVE TAKEN the word. Amen. Can I
[48:05] say it this way? They would have taken
[48:06] the message, taken what God was doing
[48:08] and used it for their own agenda. they
[48:10] would have made a puppet out of it or or
[48:12] orchestrated some sort of man-made
[48:14] attachment to it. SO SO GOD HIDES HIM IN
[48:17] THIS PLACE. AND GOD DOESN'T just hide
[48:19] things to be cute or to be difficult,
[48:21] BUT HE'S GOT A PURPOSE in it. Like we
[48:23] said, he's doing it to HIDE IT FROM THE
[48:25] EYES of the wise and the prudent. AMEN.
[48:27] I I REMEMBER FOR MYSELF WHEN I WHEN I
[48:29] first heard about the message, God led
[48:30] me to this place and I heard about the
[48:32] message. And I don't know for each of
[48:34] you what your experience was, but I
[48:35] heard ABOUT THE MESSAGE AND I'M
[48:37] THINKING, WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW
[48:39] ABOUT THIS? THIS OUGHT TO BE ALL AROUND
[48:40] THE WORLD. EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW WHAT
[48:42] THIS MESSAGE IS ABOUT. YOU SHOULD BE
[48:43] ABLE TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA. YOU SHOULD
[48:45] BE ABLE TO GO TO INDIA. YOU SHOULD BE
[48:47] ABLE TO GO TO INDIANA. AND THEY SHOULD
[48:49] EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW WHO WILLIAM
[48:50] BRANDON IS. WHY DON'T THEY KNOW?
[48:52] EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW. AMEN. And it
[48:54] struck me AS A YOUNG [screaming] MAN,
[48:55] WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW? BUT WE HAVE
[48:57] OUR ANSWER. AMEN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
[48:59] GO GOOGLE WILLIAM Brandom
[49:01] &gt;&gt; and you'll have YOUR ANSWER FOR WHY NOT
[49:03] EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. GOD HID IT
[49:05] FROM A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE. AMEN. We
[49:07] look at our media today. We look at our
[49:09] politics today and the propaganda
[49:11] machines THAT WE HAVE. THEY'RE NOT
[49:13] INTERESTED in taking this MESSAGE AND
[49:16] PROMOTING IT AS THE VINDICATED WORD OF
[49:18] GOD. THEY'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING
[49:20] TO MAKE THEM MONEY. They're interested
[49:21] in what's going to MAKE A STORY SELL.
[49:23] AND THEY'VE GOT AN AGENDA attached to
[49:25] it. Amen.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; They're not interested in presenting it
[49:28] that you WOULD HAVE LIFE, BUT THEY'VE
[49:30] GOT THEIR OWN IDEAS AND THEY'VE GOT
[49:32] THEIR OWN PRESENTATION AND THEY'LL TAKE
[49:34] WHATEVER YOU GIVE THEM AND THEY'LL
[49:35] MANHANDLE IT. AMEN. IMAGINE THE LEVEL OF
[49:38] PERSECUTION IF IF IT WAS AS WIDESPREAD
[49:41] AND AS WIDE KNOWN AS I WAS TALKING
[49:43] ABOUT. IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD BE THE
[49:45] scrutiny we would be under tonight.
[49:46] AMEN.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT AND WE SAY WELL
[49:49] WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE THIS AND WHY NOT?
[49:51] WHY ISN'T IT MORE VISIBLE? BUT WE
[49:53] UNDERSTAND YOU know it's it's like the
[49:55] old adage the tallest tree in the forest
[49:56] is the first to fall. I MEAN GOD HIDES
[49:59] THINGS FOR A REASON. HE HIDES IT FOR OUR
[50:01] GOOD. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED BECAUSE
[50:03] YOU'RE A LITTLE FLOCK TONIGHT. AMEN.
[50:05] BECAUSE IT'S THE FATHER'S GOOD PLEASURE
[50:06] TO GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISCOURAGED THAT YOUR NAME'S
[50:11] NOT SOMEWHERE IN SOME MAGAZINE OR IN
[50:13] SOME SPOTLIGHT OR SOME MARQUEE. YOUR
[50:15] NAMES ARE WRITTEN DOWN IN THE LAMB'S
[50:17] BOOK OF LIFE. AND WHEN ALL THESE OTHER
[50:19] THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY AND THEY'RE ALL
[50:21] GONE, YOU SHALL REMAIN.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; PRAISE the Lord. So, I'M NOT I'M NOT
[50:26] UPSET ABOUT IT. I I accept that it's the
[50:28] wisdom of God in my life. Amen. I'm not
[50:31] looking to promote something. I'm
[50:33] looking to BE A CARRIER. NOT JUST A
[50:35] CARRIER, BUT I AM THE LIGHT MANIFESTED.
[50:37] YOU'RE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD TONIGHT.
[50:38] AMEN.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; AND WHOEVER SEES IT, I want to represent
[50:42] Jesus Christ to that one. Amen. So, we
[50:44] look at this THAT THAT GOD IS PLACING IT
[50:46] SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM THE INFLUENCE and
[50:49] the control of money AND POLITICS. AND
[50:51] BROTHER TALKS ABOUT WHY IT HAD TO BE
[50:53] SHEPHERDS. THE SAME VERY THE THE very
[50:55] same kind of thing. THESE SHEPHERDS,
[50:57] THEY'RE THEY'RE SIMPLE MEN.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SCHOLARS. THEY'RE
[51:00] NOT THEOLOGIANS. THEY'RE NOT IN SOME
[51:02] SORT OF ECCLESIASTICAL SYSTEM. AMEN.
[51:05] They're not looking to take what they
[51:06] found and UTILIZE IT FOR THEIR OWN ENDS
[51:09] TO TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. THEY'RE
[51:11] SHEPHERDS. AMEN. THEY'VE GOT NO
[51:13] PRECONCEIVED IDEAS. They've got no
[51:15] agenda. They're just in a BLANK SLATE
[51:18] FOR GOD TO USE. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S
[51:20] LOOKING FOR. SOMEONE THAT'LL LAY ASIDE
[51:22] their own thinking, THEIR OWN IDEAS, AND
[51:24] ACCEPT THE WORD AS GOD REVEALS IT. AND
[51:26] GOD REVEALS IT TO THESE MEN. AMEN. THESE
[51:29] THESE SHEPHERDS, AND THEY'VE GOT THE
[51:30] RIGHT KIND OF A NATURE. AMEN. AS THE
[51:32] PROPHET SAID, LAMBS AREN'T BORN IN
[51:34] HOUSES.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CHRIST, THE LAMB OF GOD. IT WOULD
[51:38] BE SHEPHERDS TO VISIT HIM. AND THEY'RE
[51:40] RIGHT AT HOME IN THAT SETTING WHERE NO
[51:43] ONE ELSE THINKS IT'S POPULAR WHEN THERE
[51:44] WAS NO ROOM FOR HIM THERE, but they're
[51:46] right at home in THIS PLACE. AMEN.
[51:48] BROTHER SAID THAT THEY were the ONLY
[51:50] KIND THAT WOULD ACCEPT HIM. A SHEPHERD
[51:52] WAS THE ONLY THING WOULD ACCEPT a lamb.
[51:54] They know how to TAKE CARE OF IT. And so
[51:57] it is today when we get the lamb's
[51:59] message. Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. WE OUGHT TO BE SO GRATEFUL
[52:03] TONIGHT FOR SOME REAL SHEPHERDS. THEY
[52:05] TAKE CARE OF THE LAMB'S MESSAGE. AMEN.
[52:07] LISTEN, I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME HERODS in
[52:08] the pulpit. I know we've had different
[52:10] things and and and things have come up
[52:12] AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE TRIED TO TAKE THIS
[52:13] MESSAGE AND USE IT FOR THEIR OWN. BUT
[52:15] DON'T LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU FROM THE
[52:18] FACT THAT GOD ORDAINED A TRUE FIVE-FOLD
[52:20] MINISTRY. AMEN. AND GOD'S GOT SOME REAL
[52:22] SHEPHERDS. THEY WON'T SCATTER THE FLOCK,
[52:24] BUT THEY'LL FEED THE PEOPLE of God.
[52:27] THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD JEREMIAH, "WOE BE
[52:30] TO THE PASTURES THAT DESTROY. THEY
[52:32] SCATTER THE SHEEP OF MY PASTURE WAS THE
[52:34] SAME GOD THAT ALSO SAID, I WILL SET UP
[52:37] SHEPHERDS OVER THEM WHICH SHALL FEED
[52:39] THEM AND they sh I love this. And they
[52:42] shall fear NO MORE NOR BE DISMAYED,
[52:45] NEITHER SHALL THEY BE LACKING." AMEN.
[52:47] You're blessed tonight TO HAVE A PASTOR.
[52:49] YOU'RE BLESSED TONIGHT TO HAVE
[52:50] MINISTRIES. And listen, I KNOW YOU don't
[52:52] ever have trouble here.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; I know there's never any DISAGREEMENTS
[52:56] HERE. LISTEN, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE EVERY
[52:57] DECISIONS THAT'S EVER MADE AND YOU MIGHT
[52:59] NOT LIKE THE COLOR OR SOMETHING AND YOU
[53:01] MIGHT NOT LIKE EVERYTHING THAT SOMEBODY
[53:02] SAYS, BUT THANK GOD TONIGHT FOR GOD
[53:04] ORAINED SHEPHERDS, A GOD ORAINED PASTOR
[53:07] THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR. AMEN. YOU
[53:09] MIGHT NOT LIKE EVERYTHING, BUT YOU DON'T
[53:11] HAVE TO FEAR THAT HE'S FEEDING YOU SOME
[53:13] POISON TONIGHT OR GIVING YOU SOME
[53:14] DENOMINATIONAL THEORY. HE'S FED YOU WITH
[53:16] THE WORD OF GOD.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE COMING TO GIVE YOU THE WORD OF
[53:20] GOD. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DISMAYED
[53:22] AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR. YOU DON'T
[53:24] HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE YOUR MEAL COME
[53:25] FROM.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; WELL, I NEED TO LOOK UP ON THIS
[53:28] PACKAGING WHERE THIS IS MANUFACTURED AND
[53:30] WHERE IT WAS PACKAGED. YOU KNOW WHERE IT
[53:31] COME OUT OF. IT COMES STRAIGHT OUT OF
[53:33] HEAVEN. AMEN.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; IT COME FROM A VINDICATED THUS SAYETH
[53:36] THE LORD.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for that tonight. Well,
[53:40] glory to God. Listen, there's a blessing
[53:42] in that. Amen. If you have respect for
[53:43] that, there's a blessing in that. You
[53:46] believe that tonight?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; God's got an ordained way of doing
[53:48] things. If you if you'll honor God's way
[53:50] of doing things, there's a blessing for
[53:52] you there. Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Now, we're looking at this tonight, but
[53:55] what about these wise men? Why them? And
[53:58] I I like this. You know, Brother Bram
[53:59] had the same question. He talks about in
[54:01] great shining light. These these wise
[54:03] men, these magi, THESE ARE THESE ARE
[54:05] PERSIAN MEN.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; They're not Israelites. THEY'RE NOT
[54:09] ANYBODY THAT WE WOULD THINK IS SPECIAL.
[54:12] AND SO, WHY IS THIS THAT THAT GOD WOULD
[54:14] USE THESE MEN? And you know, now I'll
[54:16] just say this, if I could qualify this
[54:17] for a moment. I'm perfectly content to
[54:20] accept what brother Bam says about it
[54:22] and just take that at face value about
[54:23] these wise men. That's all right. But I
[54:25] I thought, you know, for myself, I
[54:27] thought it might be appropriate to look
[54:28] in the histories a little bit and go
[54:30] through this and what what does the
[54:32] history say about these wise men and see
[54:34] if it lines up and with what brother Bam
[54:36] says and things like that. And when you
[54:38] look at what Brother Bam says about it,
[54:39] it leads me to believe that he was
[54:40] acquainted with some of these writings.
[54:42] Now, I'm saying this for this reason.
[54:43] Contrary to some people's thinking,
[54:46] Brother Ben did in fact read books.
[54:49] And that doesn't bother me. And maybe it
[54:51] bothers you. I don't know why it would.
[54:52] BUT BROTHER BEN READ BOOKS. AMEN. Is
[54:55] that okay? If you read books, that
[54:58] doesn't make you a nerd. It makes you
[54:59] literate.
[55:01] [laughter]
[55:03] Well, I I mean, SERIOUSLY, WE'VE GOT THE
[55:05] SCRIPTURES. We got the message. AND
[55:06] LISTEN, I I don't think you need
[55:08] anything BESIDES THAT. I BELIEVE
[55:09] EVERYTHING we need, it's been given to
[55:11] us. Amen. But you know, SOME PEOPLE THEY
[55:13] ALMOST BECOME DOGMATIC ABOUT IT. Like if
[55:15] you pick up a brochure at a gas station
[55:18] and you read it, you're a backsliding
[55:19] heathen double pagan
[55:22] LIKE DON'T BE READING THAT NOW. WHAT YOU
[55:24] READING FOR? And I'm thinking cuz that's
[55:25] what that's how you find stuff out.
[55:28] Amen.
[55:30] Well, praise the Lord. LISTEN, BROTHER
[55:31] BAM TALKED ABOUT ONE TIME HE WAS IN NEW
[55:32] YORK and he listened TO A LECTURE FROM
[55:36] ALBERT EINSTEIN. NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO
[55:39] ASK FOR A SHOW OF HANDS TONIGHT. AMEN.
[55:42] But if you sit there and say, "Well,
[55:43] listen, you don't need to BE DOING
[55:44] THAT." WELL, YOU'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND
[55:46] CORRECT THE PROPHET.
[55:49] [snorts] Praise the Lord. Somebody say,
[55:51] "Well, Brother Bam said, "Educations of
[55:53] the devil." And people, THEY WENT OUT on
[55:54] a limb with that where if you go to
[55:57] school, if you know how to SIGN YOUR
[55:58] NAME, LISTEN, BROTHER BREN, LISTEN,
[56:00] BROTHER BEN, WHEN HE STARTED OUT
[56:01] PREACHING, HE COULDN'T even read the
[56:02] Bible. He had to HAVE HOPE READ IT. THAT
[56:04] DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM LEARNING.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And people WILL ALMOST GO, "WELL, I
[56:08] don't know. Here we are. PEOPLE WILL
[56:11] ALMOST GO THE OTHER WAY LIKE, "WELL, YOU
[56:13] TOOK IT UPON yourself to learn some
[56:15] valuable skill. THEREFORE, IT'S THE
[56:17] DEVIL."
[56:19] &gt;&gt; NOW, we're laughing, but it's true.
[56:20] PEOPLE, THEY THEY'RE SO SPIRITUAL.
[56:23] THEY'RE SO MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU TILL
[56:24] THEY'RE NOT any smarter than you.
[56:28] BROTHER SAID, "I'M NOT SUPPORTING
[56:30] IGNORANCE." AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL,
[56:32] WE'LL ALMOST MAKE IT THAT WAY. Bless
[56:34] God. You better not look that up or READ
[56:36] THAT. AMEN. LISTEN, THE WORLD HAS ENOUGH
[56:38] IGNORANCE IN IT TODAY. IT DOES NOT NEED
[56:40] US TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED TO ADD OUR IGNORANCE.
[56:45] AMEN. PAUL SAID, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
[56:47] IGNORANT." AMEN. WE'RE WE'RE THE PEOPLE
[56:49] THAT KNOW.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW SOMETHING. AMEN.
[56:53] THAT'S NOT TO MAKE YOU ARROGANT. LISTEN,
[56:55] if it's just KNOWLEDGE AND IT PUFFS YOU
[56:57] UP, YOU'LL WALK AROUND WITH YOUR
[56:59] FAVORITE QUOTES AND YOU'LL CONDEMN
[57:00] EVERYBODY ELSE FOR NOT BEING AS
[57:01] SPIRITUAL AS YOU. BUT IF IT'S REAL GODLY
[57:03] LOVE, IT'LL EDIFY THAT PERSON AND YOU'LL
[57:06] TAKE THAT. LISTEN, YOUR YOUR
[57:07] INTELLIGENCE, IF YOU'VE GOT SOME, not
[57:10] claiming any for MYSELF TONIGHT. YOUR
[57:12] INTELLIGENCE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A
[57:15] HINDRANCE TO GOD. IT'S ONLY IF YOU LET
[57:18] IT.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE YOUR EMOTION. IT'S LIKE
[57:21] anything else. Are you going to SUBMIT
[57:22] IT TO GOD OR ARE YOU GOING TO LET it
[57:24] rule over you?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Well, now that's that's my rant for
[57:28] tonight, I guess.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, BROTHER SAID THESE MAGI, HE SAID
[57:32] THEY WERE SCIENTIFIC MEN.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. SCIENTIFIC MEN THAT
[57:36] WERE STUDYING this thing. Brother says
[57:38] this, I was thinking this comes to mind
[57:39] about these magi and the star. AND WHAT
[57:42] STRUCK ME WAS WHAT DOES A MAGI HAVE TO
[57:45] DO WITH CHRIST? THEREFORE, BY READING
[57:47] many of the ancient scholars last night
[57:50] late and he had a late night, too.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; So, here he's reading the ancient
[57:55] scholars. Sounds kind of dignified
[57:56] actually. Brother Brandon was pouring
[57:58] over the [laughter and gasps] the the
[58:00] books of the ancients, BUT HE'S READING
[58:03] THESE ANCIENT SCHOLARS late last night
[58:05] till I went to sleep AT THE DESK TRYING
[58:08] TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD BRING A
[58:10] LITTLE light on the subject for today.
[58:13] So, and brother mentions Hampton is one
[58:15] of these these these different ones. So,
[58:17] I look through I if anybody cares, I'm
[58:20] not going to give you all the quotes
[58:21] because that's a whole another I'll put
[58:22] you all to sleep a little too early. But
[58:25] Josephus talks about not in antiquities
[58:27] but in his uh book of the history of the
[58:28] Jewish war and Tacitus and Satonius
[58:31] different ones they they all talk about
[58:32] this and what's remarkable now this is
[58:34] this is what's interesting to me what's
[58:35] remarkable is they all talk about this
[58:38] expectation there was an expectation on
[58:41] the earth AND THESE ARE PAGAN NATIONS
[58:45] &gt;&gt; THESE are Romans and Persians THERE'S
[58:46] THIS EXPECTATION OF THEM THAT SOME great
[58:49] ruler is going to appear upon the earth.
[58:52] Amen. in the culture that day was Roman,
[58:54] but before it was Roman, it was the
[58:55] Greeks. Before it was the Greeks, it was
[58:57] the Mes and Persians. They had influence
[58:59] in the area in in that whole area and it
[59:01] had it had carried over. Amen. And and
[59:03] UNDER THE PERSIANS, IT WAS THIS IDEA
[59:06] that had taken hold. AND WE KNOW WHY. A
[59:08] PROPHET TELLS US WHY. BECAUSE there was
[59:09] a man by the name OF DANIEL THAT WAS IN
[59:12] Babylon one day and then later the Mes
[59:13] and the Persians. AND HE'D RECEIVED A
[59:15] WORD FROM THE LORD THAT GOD'S PEOPLE,
[59:17] THEY'VE BEEN IN CAPTIVITY 70 YEARS, BUT
[59:20] NOW 70 WEEKS have been determined upon
[59:23] the people. And and Daniel, he he goes
[59:26] into this. And of course, we know the
[59:27] scripture of it. I'm not going to preach
[59:28] it all to you tonight, but you're you're
[59:29] familiar with it. AMEN. AND SO THESE
[59:31] MEN, THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, and people
[59:33] knew about this. IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY
[59:36] PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T LOOKING FOR IT WAS
[59:39] THE JEWS. THE VERY PEOPLE IT WAS
[59:42] ORDAINED TO GO to [screaming] was the
[59:45] VERY PEOPLE THAT SEEMED IGNORANT OF IT.
[59:47] THEY LISTEN THEY HAD SCRIPTURES ABOUT
[59:48] WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO and where he would
[59:51] come from AND WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE.
[59:53] BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES GOD
[59:55] TALKS ABOUT WHEN THAT IN THE MIDST of
[59:57] the 70th week he's GOING TO BE CUT OFF
[59:59] THAT the beginning this prince is GOING
[1:00:01] TO APPEAR AND EVERYBODY there's this uh
[1:00:03] the the historians talk about this this
[1:00:05] star THEY CALL A A CELESTIAL ORACLE.
[1:00:07] THIS LIGHT IN the sky appears and they
[1:00:10] see this and they document and they TALK
[1:00:12] ABOUT IT. NOW, HERE'S WHAT'S FUNNY.
[1:00:13] THEY'VE ALL GOT different
[1:00:13] interpretations. They think it's going
[1:00:15] to be this Roman emperor. They think
[1:00:16] it's going to BE THIS. THEY THEY ALL SAW
[1:00:19] SOMETHING, but they all interpreted it
[1:00:22] differently. BUT PRAISE GOD, WE HAVE THE
[1:00:24] DIVINE COMMENTARY TONIGHT. I DON'T NEED
[1:00:27] WHAT JOSEPHUS SAYS ABOUT IT. I KNOW WHAT
[1:00:29] IT'S ABOUT. AMEN. WE KNOW WHAT IT'S
[1:00:31] ABOUT. MATTHEW WROTE IT DOWN. WE WE
[1:00:33] UNDERSTAND a ruler did arise. Amen.
[1:00:35] [laughter] A scepter WAS TO RISE OUT OF
[1:00:37] SHILOH. AND THESE MAGI, THEY'RE AWARE OF
[1:00:40] THE DIVINE PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY HAD THE
[1:00:42] WORDS of Daniel. AMEN.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S NOTEWORTHY. THEY'VE GOT ONE OF
[1:00:45] THE FEW THINGS THAT SAYS WHEN HE'S GOING
[1:00:48] TO COME.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; NOW, you see where I'm going? Probably
[1:00:50] not a little bit. AMEN. THEY WEREN'T
[1:00:52] JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.
[1:00:53] THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE DAY and the
[1:00:56] time and they recognized their hour.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; They recognized the day they were living
[1:01:00] in. AND THAT'S WHY BROTHER BAM SAYS
[1:01:02] THAT'S WHY THEY SAW IT BECAUSE THEY WERE
[1:01:04] LOOKING FOR it in the first place.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.
[1:01:09] NOW YOU THINK ABOUT THESE GUYS. IMAGINE
[1:01:11] THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT.
[1:01:13] IMAGINE. CAN I DRAMATIZE THIS? I'M NOT
[1:01:15] USING an anacronism. I'm just GOING TO
[1:01:16] DRAMA. IMAGINE THESE GUYS. THEY COME IN
[1:01:18] THERE. THEY MEET UP. THEY HIGH-FIVE EACH
[1:01:20] OTHER. AND THEY WALK INTO JERUSALEM AND
[1:01:22] THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN. THEY
[1:01:23] GET TO THE PALACE. THEY GO UP TO HEROD
[1:01:24] AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR STREAMERS OUT AND
[1:01:26] THEIR PARTY HATS ON AND THEY'RE THEY'RE
[1:01:28] WAVING FLAGS.
[1:01:30] WE FINALLY MADE IT. IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS.
[1:01:34] WHEN WE MADE IT AND THEY KNOCK ON THE
[1:01:35] DOORS, HEY GUYS, WE'RE HERE. WHERE IS
[1:01:38] HE? WHERE IS HE THAT'S BORN KING OF THE
[1:01:40] JEWS?
[1:01:46] WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; And they're like, did did I stutter or
[1:01:52] is this Maybe I need to practice my
[1:01:54] Hebrew a little bit. Where is he
[1:01:58] THAT IS BORN IS YOUR KING. WE DON'T HAVE
[1:02:00] what I don't know what you're talking
[1:02:01] about.
[1:02:03] [laughter]
[1:02:05] And these these guys like we don't know
[1:02:06] what you're talking about. And they're
[1:02:07] like, well, I don't know why you don't
[1:02:08] know what I'm talking about. IT'S YOUR
[1:02:11] KING. IT'S YOUR PROPHECY. IT'S YOUR
[1:02:14] MESSIAH. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THESE GUYS
[1:02:16] ARE TROUBLED. AND PROBABLY THE MAGIC
[1:02:17] WERE TROUBLED THAT THEY WERE TROUBLED.
[1:02:20] LIKE, HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT WE'RE
[1:02:22] TALKING ABOUT? YOU WERE HERE WHEN IT
[1:02:25] HAPPENED AND YOU MISSED IT.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, just think ABOUT THIS. OUT
[1:02:31] SOMEWHERE IN A MANGER TWO YEARS PRIOR, A
[1:02:36] HEAVENLY HOST SPOKE TO A BUNCH OF
[1:02:38] SHEPHERDS THAT MESSIAH HAD BEEN BORN.
[1:02:40] BEHOLD, I BRING YOU TIDINGS OF GREAT
[1:02:42] JOY. AND ALL THIS IS GOING ON. AND THESE
[1:02:44] GUYS HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS [screaming]
[1:02:46] OF MILES AWAY, THEY SEE A STAR AND THEY
[1:02:50] TAKE OFF. AND ALL THE TIME THE CHURCH
[1:02:52] HAD NO IDEA. [cheering]
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; They're looking around. I don't know
[1:02:57] what you're talking about.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Well, let's go OPEN A BIBLE AND find
[1:03:00] out. Well, maybe you should have opened
[1:03:01] it beforehand.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. It's like my wife says, you
[1:03:06] know, you get people and they get
[1:03:07] critical, they get hurt, and they they
[1:03:09] they get hurt. They get whatever. They
[1:03:10] get confused. They hear certain things
[1:03:12] and they they begin to study the message
[1:03:14] and they're looking for faults. If they'
[1:03:15] have studied it when they were aiming
[1:03:17] towards believing it, they might not
[1:03:18] disbelieve it. Amen. THEY WAIT TILL THEY
[1:03:20] GET ALL HURT AND DISCOURAGED AND
[1:03:22] CONFUSED. WELL, NOW MAYBE WE BETTER LOOK
[1:03:23] THIS UP.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONES LOOKING.
[1:03:27] THEY SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IT. AND YET
[1:03:30] GOD DIDN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THEM.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; THEY GET TO JERUSALEM is lights out.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; THEY'D FOLLOWED THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF
[1:03:39] MILES. BUT THE DARKNESS OF
[1:03:42] ECCLESIASTICAL DENOMINATIONALISM OVER
[1:03:45] JERUSALEM WAS SO GREAT THAT GOD SAID,
[1:03:46] "WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO NEXT." COULD
[1:03:49] you tell us WHERE TO GO? WELL, WE'VE got
[1:03:51] some HISTORICAL IDEAS. WE'VE GOT SOME
[1:03:54] DOCTRINE. WE KNOW WHERE HE SHOULD HAVE
[1:03:55] BEEN TWO YEARS AGO. WE CAN'T REALLY TELL
[1:03:57] YOU WHERE HE IS TODAY. HEY, MAYBE YOU
[1:03:58] CAN FIND HIM FOR US.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. MAYBE YOU COULD TELL
[1:04:04] ME WHERE HE'S AT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE
[1:04:05] HE'S AT.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE CHURCH WORLD SHOULD HAVE
[1:04:13] RECOGNIZED THE MESSAGE, SHOULD HAVE
[1:04:15] RECOGNIZED ELIJAH. BEHOLD, I SEND YOU
[1:04:18] ELIJAH. THEY SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IT.
[1:04:20] YET, THEY WERE [screaming] THE VERY ONES
[1:04:22] THAT MISSED IT. THEY REJECTED IT. THEY
[1:04:24] SLAYED IT. THEY MURDERED IT. THEY SAID
[1:04:25] EVERY KIND OF DIRTY THING ABOUT IT.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; WELL, the party hats come off.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; PUT PUT YOUR STUFF BACK AWAY. IT'S NOT
[1:04:36] TIME YET.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; WELL, they said go over to Bethlehem,
[1:04:40] but I love it. They get out there a
[1:04:42] little bit and the light comes again.
[1:04:44] [laughter]
[1:04:45] All they had to do was get out from that
[1:04:47] little bit of that that confusion, that
[1:04:50] Babylon, that nonsense, the historical
[1:04:53] idea. As soon as they come out, they see
[1:04:55] the star again.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my, praise the Lord. They get out
[1:05:01] there and you know, and brother Bam
[1:05:03] talks about this. It's it's not like our
[1:05:05] our modern nativity scene. They don't
[1:05:06] get there. He's a little baby. It was
[1:05:08] two years they traveled. Herod inquires
[1:05:10] about this. This is why later he orders
[1:05:12] the children two years in to be slayed.
[1:05:14] Amen. So they probably traveled about
[1:05:16] the space of two years. So I want this
[1:05:18] where I'm coming to with this. When they
[1:05:19] get there, Jesus is not a baby at this
[1:05:21] point. Now I don't know how far they
[1:05:23] traveled. Brother Bam said they were
[1:05:24] still in Bethlehem. So I don't have any
[1:05:25] reason to say otherwise, but there's
[1:05:27] nothing that supports the idea that he
[1:05:29] sat in a manger for two years.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; He's 2 years old kicking blocks AROUND
[1:05:33] IN THE EXACT SAME manger that probably
[1:05:35] would had to pay whatever for that.
[1:05:37] Like, "Hey guys, you've been here a year
[1:05:39] and a half. Could you could you help us
[1:05:41] out a little bit? We got THE END'S NOT
[1:05:43] FULL ANYMORE. AMEN.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WASN'T WHERE HE WAS AT TWO YEARS
[1:05:49] AGO.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; HE WAS WHERE THE WORD said he would be.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the light led them right to
[1:05:55] wherever he was. The light led them NOT
[1:05:57] WHERE THEY TOLD THEM TO GO. BUT THE
[1:06:00] LIGHT LED him right where HE WAS AT.
[1:06:02] THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF IT. AND WHEN
[1:06:04] THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY DIDN'T SIT THERE
[1:06:05] AND MOPE AND GET SAD AND SAY, "WELL,
[1:06:07] BLESS GOD. I guess we'll find him. Oh,
[1:06:08] we've got the greatest message there's
[1:06:10] ever been. Well, praise God. Let's just
[1:06:12] fold our hands and thank God and WE'LL
[1:06:14] COME BACK. MAN, THEY REJOICE.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; THEY FOUND SOMETHING. AMEN. LISTEN, I
[1:06:19] GLORY TO GOD. THEY FOUND SOMETHING TO
[1:06:21] REJOICE ABOUT.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. They get there and they come right
[1:06:25] to where the holy child is. AND BROTHER
[1:06:27] BRANDON, like I said, he talks ABOUT
[1:06:28] THIS THING. THESE MEN IN JERUSALEM, THEY
[1:06:30] ALL MISSED IT. BROTHER SAYS THAT THEY
[1:06:32] DIDN'T EVEN SEE A SIGN OF IT.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; AND I'M THINKING HISTORIANS WROTE ABOUT
[1:06:35] IT.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; BUT THE JEWS, THEIR OWN OBSERVATORIES
[1:06:38] DIDN'T SEE A THING. THESE HEBREW PEOPLE.
[1:06:43] WHY? Because they weren't expecting it.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; See why timing is so important. It
[1:06:51] wasn't just for these these these wise
[1:06:54] men. It wasn't just that they knew it
[1:06:55] would happen. They recognized the day
[1:06:58] they were living. They recognized this
[1:06:59] was the time for it. Amen. They could
[1:07:02] know by the stars. They could discern by
[1:07:03] prophecy, by the signs of the heaven.
[1:07:06] This was the hour. Amen. [snorts]
[1:07:09] Brother says this, they know the
[1:07:11] scriptures because Daniel was their
[1:07:12] chief. You know that second chapter of
[1:07:14] Daniel tells he was made chief over
[1:07:15] them. SO HE TAUGHT THEM. NO doubt at one
[1:07:18] night they was sitting there reading the
[1:07:21] scriptures about and Daniel said that he
[1:07:22] beheld all these kingdoms till finally
[1:07:25] they become into what they was each the
[1:07:27] me of Persians and on down till they
[1:07:29] come into Rome. AND THEN FINALLY HE SAW
[1:07:32] a stone cut out of the mountain without
[1:07:33] hands. And they said it must be about
[1:07:36] that time.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [panting]
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; They remembered the rehearsal way back
[1:07:42] before that time. Way back in the days
[1:07:44] of the journey of Israel when they come
[1:07:46] up and heard Balam say when he seen
[1:07:47] Israel SAID THERE WILL ARISE A STAR OUT
[1:07:50] OF JACOB. AMEN. IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT
[1:07:52] THAT time when they was thinking about
[1:07:54] those things that the new visitor
[1:07:57] appeared.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; See, there was an expectation. Amen.
[1:08:01] Now, this is this is a whole another
[1:08:02] thought. I don't want to get into it too
[1:08:04] much, but I was just talking about this
[1:08:05] here the other day. You know, it's like
[1:08:06] Moses. Moses had been out there in the
[1:08:08] wilderness for 40 years. He'd been in
[1:08:09] exile from Egypt. And one day he's out
[1:08:11] there and God, YOU KNOW, GOD, HE HAS A
[1:08:13] WAY OF GETTING your attention.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, he puts THIS BURNING BUSH UP
[1:08:18] HERE IN THIS BUSH. IT'S NOT CONSUMED.
[1:08:20] AND AND HE DOESN'T START SAYING, "HEY,
[1:08:22] MOSES, LOOK UP HERE. THERE'S A BURNING
[1:08:23] BUSH UP HERE. LOOK UP HERE, MOSES."
[1:08:25] But he just he lights it UP. AND MOSES,
[1:08:27] HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THIS SIGHT ABOUT THIS
[1:08:30] BUSH? IT'S BEING BURNED. I SEE." HE
[1:08:32] SAYS, "I WILL NOW TURN ASIDE TO SEE
[1:08:36] THIS." THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND WHEN he
[1:08:38] turned, GOD SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID,
[1:08:41] "MOSES, MOSES." SEE, GOD GOD HIDES SOME
[1:08:44] THINGS TO HIDE IT FROM SOME PEOPLE, but
[1:08:46] he also hides some things so you'll find
[1:08:48] it cuz he's looking for someone who's
[1:08:50] interested. AMEN. IT'S THE IT'S THE
[1:08:52] GLORY OF GOD TO CONCEAL A MATTER. BUT
[1:08:55] IT'S THE HONOR OF KINGS TO SEARCH IT
[1:08:57] OUT. SO GOD LEAVES A LITTLE SOMETHING
[1:08:59] FOR YOU. HE LEAVES A LITTLE SOMETHING
[1:09:01] FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY'LL THEY'LL
[1:09:03] SHOW AN INTEREST. AMEN. NOT JUST A
[1:09:05] CURIOSITY, BUT AN INTEREST. THESE MEN
[1:09:07] ARE NOT JUST, "HEY, LOOK, THERE'S A
[1:09:09] STAR. I BET IT'S TIME. I BET IT'S TIME.
[1:09:11] IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT WHEN WE HEAR THE
[1:09:13] STORIES ABOUT, BUT THEY WERE INTERESTED
[1:09:15] IN MEETING THIS ONE." AND THEY GOT THEIR
[1:09:17] GIFTS AND THEY LISTEN, THEY TRAVELED NOT
[1:09:20] JUST A HOP, SKIPPING A JUMP. NOT LIKE ME
[1:09:22] DRIVING DOWN HERE TO SOUTH CAROLINA.
[1:09:24] THEY TRAVELED AT GREAT DISTANCE AND RISK
[1:09:27] AND PERIL TO THEIR OWN WELL-BEING, AND
[1:09:29] THEY DIDN'T COME EMPTY-HANDED.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LUGGING THEIR GIFTS. THEY'RE
[1:09:33] BRINGING THEIR CAMELS. THEY BROUGHT THIS
[1:09:34] STUFF WITH HIM AND BROTHER BAM TALKS
[1:09:36] ABOUT THIS THING. THESE MAGI THEY
[1:09:37] [screaming] WERE INSPIRED.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT'S NOT JUST like me going down
[1:09:41] getting you a card saying we'll marry
[1:09:43] Dewali or whatever it is you all you
[1:09:45] know people believe. AMEN. THAT THERE
[1:09:47] WAS SOMETHING in them. THESE THESE
[1:09:49] GENTILE
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; MAGI
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; YET GOD INSPIRED THEM BECAUSE GOD IN
[1:09:54] SUNARY TIMES DIVERSE MANNERS HE SPAKE.
[1:09:56] AMEN. AND HE INSPIRES THESE men when
[1:09:59] they bring these gifts. Brother Bam says
[1:10:00] this. God guided those gifts because
[1:10:02] they were gifts to identify him.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Brother M says in God gifts always find
[1:10:09] their places. 1963 he says now he says
[1:10:11] now what how beautiful those gifts fit
[1:10:14] into Jesus Christ. See gold speaking of
[1:10:17] his deed. He says now they wasn't
[1:10:19] heathens. That's kind of an interesting
[1:10:21] statement because
[1:10:23] uh colloquially speaking they were. But
[1:10:25] he says they wasn't heathens. THEY WERE
[1:10:28] INSPIRED BY GOD.
[1:10:32] They weren't wasn't imagining something
[1:10:35] that proves right there even the magi
[1:10:38] that they did see the supernatural
[1:10:41] because their own GIFT THAT THEY OFFERED
[1:10:44] IDENTIFIED AND SPOKE WELL OF their
[1:10:46] testimony that they did see THE
[1:10:48] SUPERNATURAL LIGHT. WHY? IT SPEAKS
[1:10:50] PERFECTLY. They brought gold deity. They
[1:10:52] brought frankincense service. They
[1:10:54] brought myrr for his death when he was a
[1:10:56] baby. Yeah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You imagine giving the baby, hey, this
[1:11:00] is for your funeral one day.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; But that was the purpose of his coming.
[1:11:05] And they recognized that because they
[1:11:06] were inspired.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Showing that deity would be put to
[1:11:11] death in the flesh that it might redeem
[1:11:14] fallen man. Praise the Lord for that.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; So notice, as brother Ram would say,
[1:11:18] their gifts showed what they thought of
[1:11:21] him.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was their identification
[1:11:26] of him. But where did they come from?
[1:11:28] That thought they were inspired. It
[1:11:29] showed what they thought of him. Amen.
[1:11:31] Brother says this. I say that to us
[1:11:33] today. The thing that we bring to him
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; identifies what our thoughts is about
[1:11:38] him. He says you understand what I mean.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; He says if you believe with all your
[1:11:43] heart every word of that, you'll
[1:11:45] identify it by giving all that you have
[1:11:48] to it. But if you believe it's just a
[1:11:51] good place to associate
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; with better people
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; around the church and things like that,
[1:11:57] that's just about what you'll give.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Just a few social hours with some of the
[1:12:02] congregation or something. But if you
[1:12:03] believe it with all your heart,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; if you believe with all your heart,
[1:12:08] you'll give everything that's in you to
[1:12:09] it. See, it identifies you and you
[1:12:12] believe the message that you believe it
[1:12:14] to be the truth.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:19] Now I want to come back to the question
[1:12:21] here at hand. Why does it have to be
[1:12:23] magi? Why does God take a bunch of
[1:12:25] people from outside the holy land,
[1:12:27] outside of Abraham's lineage and and all
[1:12:30] this to do this? Why? Well, we talked
[1:12:32] about at the beginning to fulfill the
[1:12:33] scripture.
[1:12:35] See, God can't fulfill these scriptures
[1:12:38] with just the Hebrew people. Amen. We
[1:12:40] read here twice in the book of Matthew.
[1:12:42] These things were done to fulfill the
[1:12:44] words of the PROPHETS BECAUSE OF THE
[1:12:46] VISITATION of these WISE MEN. THAT'S WHY
[1:12:48] Herod brings about a slaughter. Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; They're vi it seem it seems kind of uh
[1:12:54] seems kind of morbid if you think about
[1:12:55] it.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; If these men had NOT VISITED IT MIGHT
[1:12:58] NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT BECAUSE they visit
[1:13:00] it triggers a slaughter. It triggers the
[1:13:02] the killing of these children. Amen. But
[1:13:04] why? That the words of Jeremiah might be
[1:13:07] fulfilled. Amen. Because they do this
[1:13:09] and he's seeking the Lord Jesus. HE'S
[1:13:11] SEEKING MESSIAH. IT'S because of this.
[1:13:13] The angel of the Lord comes to Joseph by
[1:13:15] night
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; because there's a persecution coming.
[1:13:18] The angel comes to Joseph and tells him
[1:13:21] to flee into Egypt. Why? That it might
[1:13:24] be fulfilled.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That was spoken to the prophets. Amen.
[1:13:29] Now, we look at it tonight. Pray for my
[1:13:31] voice here. Then we look at it tonight
[1:13:32] and these people, they don't look like
[1:13:34] what we would call likely candidates to
[1:13:36] be used of God.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're they're not religious.
[1:13:39] They're not theological. Amen. But yet
[1:13:43] we watch and God has used them. They're
[1:13:45] the ones looking.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Where is he that's born king of the
[1:13:48] Jews? Brother Ram says this. Someone
[1:13:50] might think that those magi would not
[1:13:51] have been a privileged people to have
[1:13:53] seen this. But if you'll read the book
[1:13:55] of Acts, Peter said that he perceived
[1:13:57] that God was of no respect of person and
[1:14:00] that he would visit those or accept
[1:14:02] those receive those of any nation that
[1:14:04] feared him and worked righteousness. God
[1:14:07] is no respector of persons.
[1:14:10] He says they then someone must have
[1:14:12] wanted to see that heavenly visitor and
[1:14:14] wonder what did this mean? THEY COULD
[1:14:16] UNDERSTAND why these magi he says people
[1:14:19] today
[1:14:21] don't understand. Did you know that
[1:14:23] those magi saw the star and it passed
[1:14:25] over observatories? We don't have any
[1:14:27] history of anybody else ever seeing it.
[1:14:28] Why? They wasn't looking.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I believe they saw the star. The Bible
[1:14:35] said they do. That's the reason today
[1:14:37] that people don't see the things they
[1:14:40] should see.
[1:14:41] The mysteries of God being unfolded
[1:14:44] because they're not looking for it. God
[1:14:46] only reveals himself to those who will
[1:14:48] let him and expecting him.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Now, WE CAN TALK ABOUT this in the
[1:14:54] broader sense, but even in our lives,
[1:14:56] how many times do we miss what God's
[1:14:59] trying to do in our lives because we're
[1:15:00] not paying attention.
[1:15:03] YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE says that they that
[1:15:04] are the sons of God, they're led by the
[1:15:07] spirit of God. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE JUST
[1:15:08] ARBITRARILY leads you when he feels like
[1:15:10] it. There's there's always leadership
[1:15:12] present. God is speaking TO US ALL THE
[1:15:14] TIME. THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE NOT ALWAYS
[1:15:16] LISTENING. JOB TALKS ABOUT IT. GOD WILL
[1:15:19] SPEAK TO MAN ONCE, YAY, TWICE, AND HE
[1:15:22] DOESN'T RECEIVE IT. SO GOD HAS TO COME
[1:15:23] TO HIM IN A DREAM. WE THINK, "MAN, I GOT
[1:15:25] A DREAM." WELL, PRAISE GOD FOR THE
[1:15:27] DREAM. WELL, THE DREAM'S ALL RIGHT, BUT
[1:15:28] MAYBE IT'S because you weren't LISTENING
[1:15:29] IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:15:31] HOW MANY TIMES DO WE MISS GOD SPEAKING
[1:15:34] TO US
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; and God's trying to show US STUFF AND
[1:15:36] WE'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR IT. AMEN.
[1:15:38] WE'RE NOT PRAYING LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE.
[1:15:40] WE'RE NOT EXPECTING LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE.
[1:15:42] AND WE SAY, "WHY ISN'T GOD DOING
[1:15:43] SOMETHING IN MY LIFE?" WHAT ARE WE
[1:15:44] LOOKING FOR HIM TO DO?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; SEE, we've got TO MAKE A PLACE TO ALLOW
[1:15:50] HIM TO DO IN OUR LIVES. AMEN. WE'LL SIT
[1:15:52] THERE AND WE'LL HAVE OUR GROCERY LIST.
[1:15:54] We pray, "Well, God, I want this and
[1:15:55] God, I want that and God, I want this."
[1:15:56] And we go to bed snore like mules. AND
[1:15:59] WE NEVER LET GOD SPEAK TO US. LISTEN,
[1:16:01] I'M NOT PRAYING TO A STONE
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; IDOL TONIGHT. MY GOD SPEAKS BACK. THAT'S
[1:16:06] WHAT THE MESSAGE PROVED.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You think ABOUT THE APOSTLE PAUL, A MAN
[1:16:13] BORN OUT OF SEASON. AMEN. AND THOUGH
[1:16:15] HE'S A BLASPHER AND A PERSECUTOR OF THE
[1:16:17] CHURCH, BUT HE DOES IT IMMINENTLY, BUT
[1:16:19] THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS MAN.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS MAN THAT
[1:16:22] DESIRES TO SEE GOD AND HE GETS STRUCK
[1:16:24] DOWN ONE DAY. HE'S OUT PERSECUTING
[1:16:26] CHRISTIANS.
[1:16:28] HE'S OUT LOOKING TO CAUSE TROUBLE. BUT
[1:16:31] THAT LIGHT COMES AND BROTHER SAID THE
[1:16:33] SAME LIGHT THAT STRUCK PAUL DOWN ON THE
[1:16:35] ROAD TO DAMASCUS IS THE SAME LIGHT THOSE
[1:16:37] MAGI SAW. THAT SAME LIGHT COME AND IT
[1:16:40] HUMBLED HIM AND IT BLINDED HIM BUT IT
[1:16:42] RAISED UP A DIFFERENT KIND OF MAN THAT
[1:16:44] NIGHT.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; So you and I ARE REPRESENTED IN THESE
[1:16:50] MAGI. AMEN. LISTEN, I WASN'T THERE. Like
[1:16:52] Jesus when he was born physically, THEY
[1:16:54] WEREN'T THERE. I WASN'T THERE. WE
[1:16:56] WEREN'T SEPARATED BY JUST 2,000 MILES,
[1:16:58] but 2,000 YEARS OF HISTORY SEPARATED US
[1:17:02] FROM THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. I
[1:17:05] WASN'T THERE TO WITNESS IT. I'M NOT AN
[1:17:07] ETHNIC HEBREW. NEITHER ARE YOU. AMEN.
[1:17:09] BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN US THAT COULD
[1:17:12] RECOGNIZE OUR [screaming] DAY AND ITS
[1:17:14] MESSAGE AND IT RECOGNIZED WHEN IT STRUCK
[1:17:16] THAT SEED. THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE
[1:17:19] TO BE QUICKENED THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE
[1:17:22] THIS IS THE WORD FOR MY DAY. YES.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; CAN I GIVE A testimony with a little bit
[1:17:26] of voice I got LEFT HERE? AMEN. LISTEN,
[1:17:28] I REMEMBER WHEN I WHEN I WHEN THE WHEN
[1:17:29] GOD first got a hold of me and I heard
[1:17:31] this message. Amen. And listen, I I was
[1:17:33] looking. I was reading stuff TRYING TO
[1:17:35] FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF WACKOS IS THIS.
[1:17:37] WHAT kind of what KIND OF WEIRD STUFF
[1:17:39] DID I FIND? BUT THE MORE I LOOKED AT IT,
[1:17:41] THE MORE I RECOGNIZED IT WAS THE WORD OF
[1:17:43] GOD. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SCRIPTURE
[1:17:46] ACCORDING TO THUS, SAYETH THE LORD. BUT
[1:17:49] I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO
[1:17:49] GO VISIT SOME OTHER CHURCHES, look at
[1:17:51] different things, and listen, IT'S JUST
[1:17:52] LIKE A JERUSALEM. THERE WAS NOTHING
[1:17:54] THERE. I go DOWN HERE, THEY'RE SAYING
[1:17:56] THIS. I GO DOWN THERE, THERE WAS NO LIFE
[1:17:58] OR LIGHT IN THOSE THINGS. AMEN. BUT WHEN
[1:18:01] I COME BACK OUT AND SAID, "OKAY, I'M
[1:18:03] GOING TO TAKE MY LIFE. I'M GOING TO
[1:18:05] ORIENT MY LIFE TOWARDS THIS MESSAGE."
[1:18:07] AMEN. THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE WHERE I CAN
[1:18:10] GO TO FIND THE WORDS OF LIFE. AMEN.
[1:18:12] THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT COME AGAIN.
[1:18:15] AND I SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO GET AWAY
[1:18:16] FROM IT. I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT GO
[1:18:17] AGAIN. THIS IS IT.
[1:18:20] [snorts]
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I went to a lot of churches that should
[1:18:26] have been able to tell me, "Well, where
[1:18:27] is he?"
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; LIKE THESE JEWS, WHERE IS HE? WELL, YOU
[1:18:30] KNOW, WE think this and we had this
[1:18:32] idea, you know, 200 years ago this or
[1:18:34] 500. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE IS HE
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; that's born. Not where was he? I I can
[1:18:41] look that up. I need to know where HE'S
[1:18:44] AT RIGHT NOW. AND LET ME TESTIFY. NOT
[1:18:47] ONLY DID I FIND OUT WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT
[1:18:48] NOW, I AM WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW. YOU
[1:18:52] ARE WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW. AND THAT
[1:18:54] MEANS MORE TO ME THAN ANYTHING else you
[1:18:56] could give me.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WORTH ALL MY GIFT AND ALL MY LIFE
[1:19:01] AND ALL MY EVERYTHING THAT I AM.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S WORTH EVERYTHING YOU GOT TONIGHT.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs]
[1:19:07] Once I saw what this message was, it
[1:19:09] wasn't just good sermons. Uh-huh.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just better theology or more
[1:19:13] holiness, but I [snorts] saw a light.
[1:19:16] Amen. It brought a God out of history.
[1:19:19] Amen. The same God that did those things
[1:19:21] there, HE'S DOING IT TODAY. He's doing
[1:19:23] it right here tonight in Bufort, South
[1:19:25] Carolina. AMEN. WHY? I HAVE SEEN A STAR.
[1:19:28] YOU'VE SEEN A STAR. AND YOU'VE COME TO
[1:19:30] WORSHIP HIM TONIGHT. IT'S CAUSED YOU TO
[1:19:32] REJOICE WITH EXCEEDING GREAT JOY. AMEN.
[1:19:34] THIS STAR TOLD ME THIS IS THE TIME OF
[1:19:37] HIS COMING. YEAH,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; IT' been one thing to read Malachi 4 AND
[1:19:41] BE LIKE, "WELL, THAT'S GREAT. I CAN'T
[1:19:42] WAIT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. I KNOW PEOPLE
[1:19:43] LIKE THAT. I'VE BEEN IN CHURCH." WELL,
[1:19:45] we're waiting for Malachi 4. I didn't
[1:19:46] know the people were waiting for it.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, Jesus own disciples DID THAT.
[1:19:52] WHEN'S ELIAS GOING TO COME? I TELL YOU,
[1:19:54] HE CAME already and you didn't recognize
[1:19:57] it. It was too humble for them. IT
[1:19:59] DIDN'T COME THE WAY THEY WANTED. THEY
[1:20:01] WANTED IN THE PALACES AND THEY WANTED IT
[1:20:02] IN THEOLOGY, BUT IT WAS RIGHT THERE
[1:20:04] WHERE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN IN HUMILITY.
[1:20:10] The time the light lets us know the
[1:20:13] time. Amen. When the ecclesiastical
[1:20:15] world walks on tonight even in ignorance
[1:20:17] and six church AGES IS ALREADY PASSED.
[1:20:20] NOT KNOW LISTEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
[1:20:22] THEIR own hour. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:20:25] AMEN. THINK ABOUT IT NOW. THEY DIDN'T
[1:20:27] KNOW THEIR OWN HOUR. YOU BROTHER talks
[1:20:28] about a watchman. Watchman is not JUST A
[1:20:30] PASTOR OR PREACHER. It's a prophet.
[1:20:32] Amen. He can look at the stars. He can
[1:20:35] look at the TIME WHEN THERE'S NO SUN
[1:20:36] DIAL WORKING, WHEN YOU YOU DON'T have an
[1:20:38] atomic clock. But he can look at those
[1:20:40] STARS AND HE CAN TELL YOU THE HOUR OF
[1:20:43] THE NIGHT. WE'VE HAD ONE.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ALL WATCHMEN. WE'VE HEARD A
[1:20:47] WATCHMAN. AMEN. HE COULD LOOK AT
[1:20:49] LUTHER'S STAR AND LUTHER DIDN'T KNOW HIS
[1:20:51] DAY, BUT HE COULD LOOK AT LUTHER'S day
[1:20:53] and he COULD LOOK AT WESLEY'S DAY AND
[1:20:55] TELL THEM WHEN THEIR DAY WAS AND WHEN
[1:20:57] HIS OWN DAY WAS. HE [screaming] KNOWS
[1:20:59] WHAT TIME IT IS. [snorts]
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; What's the time of it? THIS IS THE HOUR
[1:21:05] WHEN HE'S IDENTIFIED. THE SON OF MAN IS
[1:21:07] AMONGST US ONCE AGAIN. WHERE IS HE AT IN
[1:21:10] HUMAN BEINGS?
[1:21:12] HE'S STILL HERE TONIGHT. LISTEN, THE SON
[1:21:14] OF MAN DIDN'T DISAPPEAR IN 1965 AND
[1:21:18] WE'RE WANDERING AROUND IN DARKNESS. WHAT
[1:21:20] ARE WE GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. HE'S
[1:21:22] STILL HERE TONIGHT. THE MESSAGE LIVES.
[1:21:24] CHRIST LIVES TONIGHT.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, brother Brandon was baptized in
[1:21:29] the Ohio River one day. Amen. He was
[1:21:30] baptizing that 17th person out there in
[1:21:33] the river. Amen. And that great light
[1:21:35] descended upon him. AND WHAT DID THE
[1:21:37] VOICE DO? IT TOLD HIM THE HOUR THAT IT
[1:21:40] WAS COMING INTO AS JOHN THE [screaming]
[1:21:42] BAPTIST FORERUN THE FIRST COMING OF
[1:21:45] CHRIST. SO YOUR MESSAGE WILL FORERUN THE
[1:21:48] SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. THE STAR
[1:21:51] IDENTIFIES THE HOUR THAT HE'S LIVING IN.
[1:21:53] I LOVE BROTHER TALKS about the
[1:21:54] newspaper. The newspaper ran this
[1:21:56] headline. Mystic star.
[1:22:01] MYSTIC STAR APPEARS OVER MINISTER
[1:22:05] BAPTIZED IN THE RIVER. IF THAT'S NOT THE
[1:22:07] SAME LIGHT TONIGHT, AMEN.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME LIGHT, THE SAME THING THE
[1:22:12] MAGI SAW, THE SAME THING THAT PAUL SAW,
[1:22:14] WE HAVE BEEN A WITNESS TO IN THIS
[1:22:16] GENERATION.
[1:22:18] [panting]
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:21] And we've come tonight. Listen, it's not
[1:22:24] just the mystic star that appeared, but
[1:22:26] there are seven stars in the right hand
[1:22:29] of this one like the son of man. And all
[1:22:31] these stars were important and I
[1:22:32] appreciate God. I thank God for all
[1:22:34] these stars. But there was a notable one
[1:22:36] among them. There was one that could
[1:22:38] identify our age. Amen. And what did the
[1:22:40] star come to do? The light the star
[1:22:43] didn't come to lead you to itself.
[1:22:45] [panting]
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother didn't come to say,
[1:22:48] "Hey, look at me."
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; As some people do. you know, they're
[1:22:51] they're looking for him to do this and
[1:22:53] they think he he rose on the third day.
[1:22:55] The light come to lead them to the Lord
[1:22:58] Jesus. THE THE THE CANDLESTICKS and the
[1:23:02] inner court was to lead them into the
[1:23:04] presence OF GOD. AND THIS STAR THAT HAS
[1:23:07] COME IN OUR AGE, THIS PROPHETIC MINISTRY
[1:23:09] HAS COME TO REVEAL THE FULLNESS OF JESUS
[1:23:12] CHRIST.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs]
[1:23:16] These guys come like we've come
[1:23:20] and they didn't just come with a a
[1:23:21] greeting card and a congratulations.
[1:23:24] Hey, congratulations, Mary. You did a
[1:23:26] good job.
[1:23:28] Way to fulfill the scripture.
[1:23:31] HEY, [screaming] JOSEPH, GOOD JOB. DON'T
[1:23:32] YOU DROP HIM NOW.
[1:23:36] They come to worship him. [gasps] We've
[1:23:40] seen a star. We've come to worship him
[1:23:42] that's born king of the Jews. we had
[1:23:44] come to rejoice. And like I said, these
[1:23:46] guys didn't make a hop, skip, and a
[1:23:47] jump. [sighs and gasps]
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't just run downtown to pick up
[1:23:51] some milk. They're about as far away as
[1:23:54] a pre a people could be in the civilized
[1:23:57] world at that time. Amen. Brother
[1:24:00] Brandon says this, they straddled their
[1:24:02] camels and started on hundreds times
[1:24:04] hundreds of miles of journey. It wasn't
[1:24:06] an overnight. It taken two years for
[1:24:09] them to get there. And some of us won't
[1:24:12] walk two city blocks to get to him or
[1:24:14] from the MIDDLE OF THE TABERNACLE to the
[1:24:17] altar to get to him.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God, man. I thought you'all
[1:24:22] be running after that one.
[1:24:26] It's quite a statement.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And listen, I'm not downing anybody. You
[1:24:30] couldn't make it tonight or what. I'm
[1:24:31] not That's not what I'm getting at.
[1:24:32] Amen. When these guys wanted to see
[1:24:35] Jesus, they found a way.
[1:24:38] That's right.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Well, we don't really have a way to do
[1:24:40] it. They'll find a way.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I I don't know. You I'll say it this
[1:24:44] way. Listen, when when I was a sinner
[1:24:47] and I wanted to do something, I found a
[1:24:49] way to do it.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got no money. I ain't got
[1:24:51] no right. Well, guess what? I'll beg,
[1:24:52] borrow, and steal to do something you
[1:24:53] want to do. Listen, if you love rock and
[1:24:55] roll music and you love concerts and you
[1:24:57] ain't got a DIME AND NOBODY, YOU'LL FIND
[1:24:59] A WAY IF YOU LIKE IT BAD ENOUGH. YOU
[1:25:01] LOOK AT ADDICTS. HEY, MAN. THEY AIN'T
[1:25:03] GOT NOTHING. BUT THEY FIND A WAY TO GET
[1:25:06] THEIR FIG. YOU WANT SOMETHING BAD
[1:25:08] ENOUGH, YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO GET IT.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; But these men SAID, "WE WANT TO SEE
[1:25:12] JESUS. WE WANT TO SEE THIS ONE THAT
[1:25:14] DANIEL TALKED ABOUT." AND THEY FOUND A
[1:25:16] WAY. LISTEN, WHEN YOU REALLY mean
[1:25:19] business, AND YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE
[1:25:21] JESUS, YOU'LL FIND A WAY.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; WELL, I BELIEVE GOD USED TO DO THAT, BUT
[1:25:25] NOT TODAY. NOT MY SITUATION. OH YES. IF
[1:25:28] YOU BELIEVE HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[1:25:30] TODAY, AND FOREVER, YOU'LL FIND A WAY.
[1:25:32] YOU'LL FIND A WAY. LISTEN, GOD CAN MAKE
[1:25:34] YOU A WAY WHEN THERE IS NO WAY. GOD
[1:25:37] BROUGHT THE GIFTS TO HIMSELF TO
[1:25:39] IDENTIFY. LET ME SAY TONIGHT, HE'S STILL
[1:25:41] A HEALER.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL A SAVIOR.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; HE STILL GIVES THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO TESTIFY THAT MORE THAN YOU
[1:25:49] WANT IT.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU. YOU SAY, "I'M A YOUNG
[1:25:52] PERSON. I NEED THE HOLY GHOST. I'M AN
[1:25:53] OLD PERSON. I NEED THE HOLY GHOST."
[1:25:55] LISTEN, HE WANTS YOU TO HAVE IT MORE
[1:25:57] THAN YOU WANT IT.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; WE GET THIS WISHY-WASHY ATTITUDE. WELL,
[1:26:01] YEAH, BLESS GOD. I WANT THIS, BUT I
[1:26:03] DON'T KNOW IF GOD WANTS THIS FOR ME.
[1:26:05] LISTEN, IT'S NOT GOD HOLDING BACK FROM
[1:26:08] YOU. IT'S US HOLDING BACK ON GOD.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; TALKS ABOUT IN THE THIRD EXODUS, THE
[1:26:15] THESE JEWS, THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THE
[1:26:16] WILDERNESS. THEY'RE WAITING ON GOD.
[1:26:18] THEY'RE WAITING ON GOD. BROTHER SAID,
[1:26:20] BROTHER SAID GOD WAS WAITING ON THEM.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Let's not keep God
[1:26:27] waiting. Yeah.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; LET'S NOT MAKE SOME OF US HAVE MADE HIM
[1:26:31] WAIT A REALLY LONG time [panting]
[1:26:34] because we don't pay attention. We don't
[1:26:36] want to this. It would inconvenience us.
[1:26:39] Let's not make God wait. He's a
[1:26:40] gentleman. He's waited long enough.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs]
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; It's not God holding back tonight.
[1:26:47] [gasps]
[1:26:48] God wants you to have the blessing more
[1:26:52] than you want the blessing. And as soon
[1:26:54] as you recognize that, you'll go to any
[1:26:57] length. You'll pack whatever camels.
[1:26:59] Listen, when that woman with a blood
[1:27:00] issue realized my, you think about this
[1:27:03] woman, think about what she went
[1:27:04] through. And we read that like a
[1:27:05] newspaper. Well, bless God, she went
[1:27:08] with 12 years and she had a blood issue.
[1:27:10] [gasps and sighs]
[1:27:15] Listen, this woman, SHE IS CEREMONIALLY
[1:27:17] UNCLEAN. THIS IS NOT JUST, WELL, I'VE
[1:27:20] HAD THIS THIS PROBLEM FOR 12 YEARS. THIS
[1:27:22] HAS RADICALLY RUINED HER LIFE FOR 12
[1:27:26] YEARS. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAD A FAMILY
[1:27:28] AND KIDS OR WHATEVER before that, but
[1:27:30] listen, IF SHE DID, SHE CAN'T SEE HIM.
[1:27:32] SHE CAN'T LIVE IN HER HOME. She can't
[1:27:34] this. SHE THIS THIS HAS UPENDED HER
[1:27:37] WHOLE LIFE. AND DOCTORS BACK THEN,
[1:27:39] THEY'RE LIKE DOCTORS TODAY. YOU CAN GIVE
[1:27:41] THEM ALL YOUR MONEY AND THEY DON'T DO
[1:27:42] NOTHING, BUT THEY KEEP YOUR MONEY.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; No offense to the medical professionals.
[1:27:46] I know you got to get paid. LISTEN,
[1:27:48] SHE'D SPENT ALL HER LIVING
[1:27:51] ON THIS and was none the better, BUT SHE
[1:27:53] WAS WORSE. BUT WHEN SHE SAW HER CHANCE,
[1:27:57] SHE didn't sit there and him holler on,
[1:27:59] "Well, I HOPE SOMEBODY PASS ME OVER TO
[1:28:01] HIM. I HOPE THERE'S A WAY. I I I DON'T
[1:28:03] WANT TO BE UNDIGNIFIED."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; SHE GOT IN THE MUD AND SHE CRAWLED,
[1:28:10] SAID, "I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY
[1:28:12] BLESSING. I'M [screaming] NOT GOING OUT
[1:28:14] THE WAY I CAME IN EVER AGAIN." AND WHEN
[1:28:17] YOU GET THAT ATTITUDE, THAT'S WHEN
[1:28:18] SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Can you IMAGINE THESE MEN GO FOR A 18
[1:28:24] MONTHS AND SAY, "WELL, bless God, it's
[1:28:27] been a hard journey. [snorts]
[1:28:29] Let's just GO BACK. WE'LL GET A HEAD
[1:28:30] [screaming] START NOW. IT WON'T TAKE
[1:28:32] WE'LL GET BACK ABOUT A YEAR EARLIER."
[1:28:34] NO, we come too far. [panting]
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; GOD INSPIRED US. God ordained us. But
[1:28:41] they're a BUNCH OF NOBODYIES. THEY'RE
[1:28:42] UNIMPORTANT. THERE'S SOMEBODY TO GOD.
[1:28:45] DON'T EVER LET THE DEVIL TELL YOU YOU'RE
[1:28:47] A NOBODY. IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS, YOU'RE A
[1:28:49] SOMEBODY.
[1:28:51] THESE PEOPLE ARE AS NOBODY AS NOBODY
[1:28:53] COULD BE. BUT GOD HAD TO FULFILL HIS
[1:28:55] WORD CUZ HE TOLD ABRAHAM 2,000 YEARS
[1:28:58] PRIOR, IN YOU SHALL ALL NATIONS BE
[1:29:02] BLESSED.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A GENTILE GROUP TO
[1:29:06] RECEIVE THAT WORD AND BE THE BRIDE OF
[1:29:09] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:29:13] Oh my. [panting and sighs]
[1:29:15] They were desperate. We've got to get to
[1:29:18] them. Our mission's too important.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Our mission is too important to give up
[1:29:24] now.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for somebody TO COME
[1:29:27] UP AND FILL UP THE CHARGE. I'm not
[1:29:30] calling AAA or Uber. Hey, can you can
[1:29:32] you deliver this FOR ME? IT'S ALL OR
[1:29:35] NOTHING. Jesus or bust. Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY OR WE'RE GOING
[1:29:40] TO DIE TRYING.
[1:29:43] [sighs and gasps]
[1:29:44] [panting]
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; SEE, what you press for shows where your
[1:29:46] faith at.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You got a real need, you'll get down in
[1:29:52] your prayer closet. You'll get down in
[1:29:53] your altar and you'll When was the last
[1:29:55] time some of us prayed through? We used
[1:29:56] to talk about praying through.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Last time we really GOT DOWN AND PRAYED
[1:30:00] THROUGH ON SOMETHING. SEE, I'M GOING TO
[1:30:02] GET DOWN here and I'm going to pray and
[1:30:04] if I DON'T HEAR FROM GOD, THERE'S GOING
[1:30:05] TO BE A PILE OF BONES here when he comes
[1:30:07] back.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; We got real serious about it. We love to
[1:30:11] have fun. We love TO FRAUD. WHEN WAS THE
[1:30:13] LAST time we got real serious, real
[1:30:15] reverent about it, real life and death?
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; See, it's okay if it works out or
[1:30:20] doesn't, whatever. See, that's why so
[1:30:22] many times, not I'm not trying to take
[1:30:24] everything that's ever, but I'm I'm
[1:30:26] telling you this. We We don't take it
[1:30:28] seriously enough.
[1:30:30] These men took it seriously and you've
[1:30:32] got a lot more tonight than they had to
[1:30:34] work with.
[1:30:36] God help me. Okay, raise my hand. God
[1:30:38] help me.
[1:30:40] Amen. We get in trouble. We'll get on
[1:30:43] the phone. We'll ask a bunch of people.
[1:30:44] We'll Google our symptoms and before you
[1:30:46] know it, we've got six different things.
[1:30:49] [panting]
[1:30:49] Well, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THIS. We'll
[1:30:51] go to the doctor and he'll say this. I
[1:30:52] think it's this. Why are you going to
[1:30:54] the doctor? You know better than him.
[1:30:56] Sometimes you do, but that's one of
[1:30:57] them.
[1:30:59] We got it all figured out
[1:31:01] except we don't have the answer because
[1:31:04] he's the answer.
[1:31:06] We're raising our hands. What are we
[1:31:07] going to do? AMEN. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
[1:31:09] ABOUT MY PROBLEM? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
[1:31:11] ABOUT MY SITUATION? WHAT WE SHOULD BE
[1:31:13] ASKING IS WHERE WHERE IS HE THAT'S BORN
[1:31:16] king of THE JEWS? WHERE IS GOD? WHAT
[1:31:18] DOES GOD WANT TO DO WITH LISTEN, GOD
[1:31:19] DON'T JUST PUT YOU IN SITUATIONS TO PUT
[1:31:22] YOU IN SITUATIONS. GOD'S TRYING TO SHOW
[1:31:24] YOU SOMETHING. HE'S TRYING TO DRAW
[1:31:26] THINGS OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN. He's
[1:31:28] trying to He's TRYING TO TAKE YOUR LIFE
[1:31:30] AND MAKE IT A TESTIMONY.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; We're just praying for answers. What we
[1:31:36] need to do is pray for God, show me the
[1:31:38] bigger picture.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; What are you trying to reveal
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; to me?
[1:31:45] Well, you know, I was sick and nobody
[1:31:47] came to see me. Well, the Bible says you
[1:31:49] call for the elders. Amen. Nobody cares
[1:31:51] about me. Well, maybe they didn't know
[1:31:52] you were sick. You never talked to
[1:31:53] anybody anyway. All right.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I hope this I I'm kind of a
[1:32:01] closet introvert. I don't know if that's
[1:32:03] a thing. Why do people talk to me? Well,
[1:32:06] you'd have to talk to them every now and
[1:32:07] then, I guess. You know how it is. We We
[1:32:10] get a complex. Nobody loves me. God
[1:32:13] don't care about me. Well, that wasn't
[1:32:15] God that told you that.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; That was your imagination. That was your
[1:32:19] idea. We did what I'm all over the place
[1:32:22] here. We do what Jacob did when he found
[1:32:24] out about Joseph. We begin to invent
[1:32:26] things in our minds. Well, he must be
[1:32:27] dead. It must be this. IT MUST BE THAT.
[1:32:28] WE DON'T KNOW THAT.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'LL INVENT something in our mind
[1:32:32] and we'll live off of that imagination.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; We all want the KINGDOM OF GOD AND all
[1:32:43] the blessings just to fall in our lap.
[1:32:44] But listen, we're called to be
[1:32:46] overcomers.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; That means you and I tonight, we've got
[1:32:49] something to do.
[1:32:51] Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Every man that wants in this kingdom,
[1:32:55] he's got to press into it.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something in us that
[1:33:00] it's not that we're driven, it's that
[1:33:01] we're led.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Something is drawing us. Something is
[1:33:04] leading us. Brother talks about that
[1:33:06] little chicken in the egg. Let me say it
[1:33:07] this way. Can I say eaglets tonight?
[1:33:09] That chicken, whatever. That little
[1:33:10] chicken in the egg. Amen. If you try to
[1:33:12] bust it through it shell for it, YOU'LL
[1:33:14] KILL IT.
[1:33:16] THE STRUGGLE IS WHAT GIVES US THE
[1:33:19] STRENGTH NOT ONLY TO COME THROUGH THE
[1:33:21] SHELL TO HAVE ITS BREAKTHROUGH BUT TO
[1:33:23] LIVE AFTERWARDS. AMEN. And God will put
[1:33:25] YOU IN SITU. HE'S NOT TRYING TO DESTROY
[1:33:27] YOU. HE'S TRYING TO MAKE YOU STRONGER.
[1:33:30] HE'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THINGS ABOUT YOU
[1:33:33] THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. I DIDN'T
[1:33:35] KNOW I COULD SURVIVE THIS. I DIDN'T KNOW
[1:33:36] I COULD GO THROUGH THAT. BUT GOD MADE A
[1:33:38] WAY. AMEN.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU BEEN THROUGH THE WORST
[1:33:42] THINGS IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU SIT THERE
[1:33:43] SAYING, "WHY [screaming] DID I GO
[1:33:44] THROUGH THAT?" CUZ GOD'S TRYING TO HELP
[1:33:46] YOU BREAK THROUGH THE SHELL TO THE NEXT
[1:33:48] LEVEL.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T WANT YOU JUST STAY IN THERE.
[1:33:51] HE'S GOT SOMETHING
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; FOR US TONIGHT. AMEN.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; SAY, "How do I break through the same
[1:33:56] way you do anything as a Christian?" By
[1:33:58] faith.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Your whole armor is supernatural. It's
[1:34:00] all by faith. Listen, with faith and
[1:34:03] patience, you can inherit any promise.
[1:34:04] The Bible says,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:34:07] [snorts] It's time for us to break out
[1:34:09] of our shell to to have our
[1:34:11] breakthrough. Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says this,
[1:34:17] "What does that star mean to us today,
[1:34:19] friend?" Daniel gives us the answer.
[1:34:21] Daniel said, Daniel 12:3, it said,
[1:34:24] "They, those that are wise and know
[1:34:27] their God shall shine
[1:34:31] as the firmaments of the heaven, and
[1:34:33] those that turn many to righteousness.
[1:34:36] God help us tonight. Those that turn
[1:34:38] many to righteousness shall shine as the
[1:34:41] stars forever and ever.
[1:34:45] He says, "What are we today then? We are
[1:34:48] stars."
[1:34:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Not a rock star or a movie star, but I'm
[1:34:54] that kind of a star. I'm the kind that
[1:34:56] Abraham saw.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You're the kind Abraham saw when God
[1:35:00] said, "Look up."
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You're representing that tonight. Amen.
[1:35:06] We are stars. Every born again Christian
[1:35:08] is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:35:11] A star to reflect the power and holiness
[1:35:14] of the Lord Jesus. To reflect him in his
[1:35:16] life, to perfect him in his speech, to
[1:35:18] perfect him in his healing power, to
[1:35:20] perfect him in his resurrection, to
[1:35:21] reflect HIM IN EVERY WAY THAT HE WAS
[1:35:23] REFLECTED TO US BY GOD THE FATHER. WE
[1:35:27] are stars.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Got a whole constellation here tonight.
[1:35:34] Listen, I know there's lots of darkness
[1:35:35] and chaos in the world today. Amen. But
[1:35:37] listen, that's how it was. It wasn't a
[1:35:39] picnic for these magi either. Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's the way it was in that day, too.
[1:35:43] But they saw the light
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; and they overcame obstacles. They
[1:35:46] overcame coldness. They overcame heat.
[1:35:48] They overcame distance and HUNGER AND
[1:35:51] PROBLEMS. THEY OVERCOME THE RELIGIOUS
[1:35:53] rejection of the day they lived IN
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY FOLLOWED THE light of that
[1:35:57] star.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when THEY SAW IT, THEY FOUND,
[1:36:01] LISTEN, THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE THEM NO
[1:36:04] REASON TO REJOICE. THEIR TRIALS GAVE
[1:36:06] THEM NO REASON TO REJOICE. BUT WHEN THEY
[1:36:08] COME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THAT STAR,
[1:36:10] THEY FOUND A REASON TO REJOICE. NOT
[1:36:13] BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, NOT BECAUSE OF THE
[1:36:15] COLD, BUT BECAUSE THEY FOUND THE ONE IT
[1:36:17] WAS POINTING THEM TO. AMEN. AND WHEN
[1:36:18] THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY REJOICED WITH
[1:36:21] EXCEEDING GREAT JOY.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; We ought to be the happiest people on
[1:36:27] the earth tonight.
[1:36:29] You know, brother M said the human heart
[1:36:30] wasn't made to be upset. It wasn't made
[1:36:32] to be sad.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that's not always seems
[1:36:35] to be the case with us.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you were made to be happy.
[1:36:38] Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:42] [sighs]
[1:36:43] Praise the Lord. Listen, tonight, each
[1:36:45] one of us, we all have gifts tonight
[1:36:48] like these men did. But it's not just
[1:36:51] that we have gifts. We are gifts.
[1:36:55] man. Well, you should feel pretty good
[1:36:56] about yourself there. Listen, YOU YOU
[1:36:59] ARE GIFTS. YOU'RE NOT JUST carrying
[1:37:01] light. You are the light of the world.
[1:37:03] Now, Jesus said,
[1:37:05] you're the ones that are showing or
[1:37:07] reflecting or revealing IT TONIGHT. IT'S
[1:37:10] NOT GOING TO BE REVEALED down the
[1:37:11] street. IT'S NOT REVEALED in the HALLS
[1:37:13] OF POLITICS. IT'S NOT REVEALED ANYWHERE
[1:37:15] BUT IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU DON'T JUST HAVE A GIFT. YOU HAVE
[1:37:20] GIFTS, BUT YOU ARE GIFTS. AND LET ME
[1:37:22] JUST SAY THIS, YOU'RE NOT JUST GIFTS TO
[1:37:23] A DYING WORLD. YOUR GIFTS TO ONE
[1:37:25] ANOTHER.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; NOW, you might not always feel that way
[1:37:29] about it. Some of you might be looking
[1:37:30] at the clock now. I don't know how I
[1:37:32] feel about that right now about this
[1:37:33] guy,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; whether you like it or not.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. Don't throw away
[1:37:39] the wrap the gift because you don't like
[1:37:40] the wrapping paper. And then don't throw
[1:37:42] away because you DON'T LIKE THE LOOK AT
[1:37:43] WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE. I'VE NEVER GOT A
[1:37:45] GIFT AND SAID, "WELL, I don't want this
[1:37:46] because of the wrapping with Listen, I
[1:37:48] can't wrap it to save. That's why I pay
[1:37:49] somebody else to wrap my gifts. I can't
[1:37:52] do that. My wife like you do it. You're
[1:37:53] better than me." I'm like, I don't know
[1:37:54] what you're talking about. YOU COULDN'T
[1:37:56] DO ANY WORSE THAN ME.
[1:37:58] But nobody ever looks at your gift and
[1:37:59] says, "Well, I don't like how it's
[1:38:00] wrapped. I don't want that." Whatever.
[1:38:03] They just rip it off. And you got some
[1:38:05] of you weirdos that save the paper. And
[1:38:10] that's why you do gift bags.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; It's what's the inside.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; It's what you got on the inside. Amen.
[1:38:18] You are gifts tonight to one another.
[1:38:22] And if you treat each other that way,
[1:38:23] it'll bless you that way.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; We look at the lengths they went to to
[1:38:28] bring their gift to Jesus. And I ask us
[1:38:31] tonight for each one of us, what are we
[1:38:33] doing tonight with our gift?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; How far are we willing to go for the
[1:38:39] cause of Christ? Amen. Listen, Jesus, he
[1:38:41] was sitting in the the corner of the
[1:38:43] house one day in Simon the Pharisees
[1:38:44] house.
[1:38:46] And there was a little ill-famed woman,
[1:38:48] a nobody kind of like these mag,
[1:38:52] she was so ill-famed. These men said,
[1:38:55] "If this man was a prophet, he would
[1:38:57] know what kind of woman this is. He
[1:38:59] would know what she's like."
[1:39:02] But this woman, she went and she
[1:39:03] decided, "I'm going to anoint the feet
[1:39:05] of Jesus.
[1:39:06] I'm not going to let him sit there with
[1:39:08] unwashing feet." And she goes, and I
[1:39:10] love how Brother Bam says it. She goes
[1:39:11] to buy this anointing oil. And she never
[1:39:13] said, "Give me a good one." She said,
[1:39:15] "Give me the best one
[1:39:19] [snorts] cuz he's worthy of the best."
[1:39:20] Brother Bam says, "What do we give him?"
[1:39:21] The leftover.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll preach to me for just a
[1:39:25] minute so you all don't feel guilty.
[1:39:27] We're guilty.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just give him the leftover.
[1:39:30] Brother says, "We'll run around all day.
[1:39:31] We're busy." And we'll give him three
[1:39:33] minutes at the end of the day. Now, I
[1:39:34] know, now listen, I know some of you get
[1:39:36] busy. I understand that. If we're not
[1:39:37] careful, that becomes our whole life.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll give him what I got left
[1:39:41] over. I'll give him what I GOT LEFT.
[1:39:44] WE'LL GIVE him the leftovers and he'll
[1:39:45] take what you give him.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; But he deserves the best.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, Samson gave GOD HIS STRENGTH,
[1:39:52] but not his heart. And God TOOK HIS
[1:39:54] STRENGTH AND HE USED HIS STRENGTH, but
[1:39:56] God deserved his heart.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever you decide to give God tonight,
[1:40:01] I want you to rest assured God will take
[1:40:02] it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; He's a gentleman. He'll take what you
[1:40:05] give him. But I want to remind you
[1:40:07] tonight in this season of gift giving,
[1:40:09] he deserves the very best.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He doesn't deserve We'll We'll put some
[1:40:14] of us I hope this is okay. Some of us
[1:40:16] will put some time this season to
[1:40:18] picking out the perfect gift for
[1:40:20] everybody.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And we'll and and that's fine. Hey,
[1:40:22] whatever. You know, I'm not I'll let the
[1:40:23] pastor deal with that. But we we we will
[1:40:27] dedicate time and energy and effort and
[1:40:29] thoughtfulness towards these gifts.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; What are we doing with our gifts for
[1:40:33] Jesus?
[1:40:35] Does that reflect our attitude towards
[1:40:37] Listen, it's his birthday. Well, not
[1:40:38] really, but [laughter]
[1:40:41] what are we doing for him?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He deserves the very best. I know
[1:40:47] we're getting ready to have a prayer
[1:40:48] meeting here in just a moment. Maybe
[1:40:50] tonight when you come up for prayer,
[1:40:53] maybe you make your dedic maybe if
[1:40:54] you've never made your dedication to him
[1:40:56] tonight. If you have, maybe make a
[1:40:58] rededication tonight as we go into this
[1:41:00] season. He deserves the very best.
[1:41:04] that we can give him because he gave us
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; the very best that he could give. If
[1:41:10] there's anything greater he could have
[1:41:12] given, he to give it. We're guilty. I'm
[1:41:15] guilty. I raise my hand. We're guilty so
[1:41:16] many times of giving them our leftovers.
[1:41:19] I say, "God, forgive me.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I want to be like these men. I I want to
[1:41:23] I want to endure. I don't want to get to
[1:41:26] the end of my life and say, well, you
[1:41:27] know, I did this little thing here and
[1:41:28] this and that."
[1:41:29] I want to be able to say, "Listen, like
[1:41:31] that man that got up on that chariot,
[1:41:33] listen, I'm bearing scars in my body.
[1:41:36] [panting]
[1:41:37] It was worth it. Whatever I went
[1:41:38] through, whatever I suffered, it was
[1:41:40] worth it to bring my gift to Jesus to
[1:41:43] come to where he was taking me." You
[1:41:45] believe that tonight? You stand to your
[1:41:46] feet.
[1:41:49] Let's just pray together tonight. God
[1:41:51] bless you. So happy to be with you
[1:41:53] tonight. You know, I I appreciate the
[1:41:55] welcoming spirit and I trust, Lord, we
[1:41:58] just continue to bless each one of you
[1:42:00] as we pray tonight. Heavenly Father, we
[1:42:04] every one of us, Lord, is
[1:42:07] is guilty at times.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, we think of these priests in the
[1:42:11] book of Malachi. They would bring these
[1:42:14] inferior offerings.
[1:42:18] God, you charged them. You wouldn't give
[1:42:21] this to your governor. You wouldn't give
[1:42:22] this to a father.
[1:42:25] Lord, we are guilty sometimes of giving
[1:42:28] to you less than we would give a natural
[1:42:31] boss or a father, a pastor. Lord, how we
[1:42:34] ought to to be ashamed tonight. Lord,
[1:42:37] I'm ashamed of them many [music] times.
[1:42:41] But Lord, tonight I'm thankful that
[1:42:43] there's a place for your grace. And
[1:42:45] Lord, that you don't cast us off. Lord,
[1:42:48] we just want to take a few moments to
[1:42:50] examine ourselves and and re rededicate
[1:42:53] ourselves to this purpose. Say, Lord,
[1:42:56] what you'd have of my life, I want you
[1:42:59] to have it all, Lord. I want you to have
[1:43:00] my heart. I want my desires. I want to
[1:43:03] orient my my entire being around this
[1:43:06] great light. I don't want to give you
[1:43:09] second or third or fourth place, but I
[1:43:11] want to always be my priority. I want to
[1:43:13] I want to make time to listen for the
[1:43:15] voice of the Lord. I want to make time
[1:43:17] to ask, "What do you want from me today,
[1:43:19] oh God? WHAT WOULD PLEASE YOU, my Lord?"
[1:43:22] Brother Brandham, he said, "Always
[1:43:23] there's a tension in our lives. Am I
[1:43:25] pleasing my Lord? If I could hear from
[1:43:27] him, may that be the very resonance of
[1:43:30] every believer's heart tonight, I pray,
[1:43:33] am I pleasing my Lord? If I could hear
[1:43:36] from him,
[1:43:38] take these dear ones, these children
[1:43:41] that you've purchased by the precious
[1:43:44] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:43:48] and may you just use them for your
[1:43:49] glory. Strengthen, establish, and settle
[1:43:52] every heart we pray. And we thank you
[1:43:54] for this time in Jesus [music] Christ's
[1:43:57] name.
[1:43:59] Amen. Let's go ahead and sing that song.
[1:44:04] myself away.
[1:44:08] [music]
[1:44:12] Give myself away [music]
[1:44:16] so you
[1:44:18] can use me. [music] I give myself
[1:44:22] [singing]
[1:44:23] away.
[1:44:30] Give myself [music] away.
[1:44:34] So
[1:44:36] here
[1:44:40] I [music]
[1:44:41] am.
[1:44:44] Here I stand. [music]
[1:44:48] Lord,
[1:44:49] my life
[1:44:52] is in [music]
[1:44:54] your hands.
[1:45:02] to [music] see
[1:45:07] desires [music and singing]
[1:45:09] revealed
[1:45:11] in me.
[1:45:14] I give myself [music and singing]
[1:45:16] away.
[1:45:23] [music]
[1:45:26] So you
[1:45:29] can use me. [music]
[1:45:38] [music]
[1:45:40] I keep myself away.
[1:45:44] to you.
[1:45:47] [music]
[1:45:49] I deserve my heart.
[1:45:52] To [music] you I belong. [singing]
[1:45:57] I give myself [music]
[1:45:59] I give myself to you.
[1:46:03] [music]
[1:46:04] Oh my life is not my own.
[1:46:10] To you [music] I belong. [singing]
[1:46:14] I give myself [music]
[1:46:16] I give myself.
[1:46:19] Oh I give myself [music and singing]
[1:46:22] away.
[1:46:27] Oh
[1:46:29] I give myself [music]
[1:46:31] away
[1:46:33] so you
[1:46:35] can use me. [music]
[1:46:39] Let's just bow our heads together.
[1:46:41] Wonder if maybe something our brother
[1:46:42] said, your head bowed, [music] your eyes
[1:46:44] closed. Amen. I don't know about you,
[1:46:46] but I just felt there as brother Alex
[1:46:49] was just closing. Amen. So appreciated
[1:46:51] [music] the word but just felt the Holy
[1:46:54] Spirit just speaking maybe directly amen
[1:46:57] to my heart [music]
[1:46:58] maybe you'd want to identify the same
[1:47:00] thing to say Lord
[1:47:02] I want to make [music] sure that you're
[1:47:04] first place
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; oh yes
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; in every part of my life as our brother
[1:47:09] quoted brother Brandham [music] so well
[1:47:11] he'll take whatever you can give him
[1:47:13] whatever you're willing to he'll take it
[1:47:16] but he deserves to be first place and I
[1:47:20] just want to say in this season of
[1:47:21] giving and and Christmas. I just want to
[1:47:24] say, Lord, let me think about you first.
[1:47:26] How many [music] want to say, Lord, I
[1:47:28] want to place you in the highest place.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; I want to place you [music] at at the
[1:47:33] top priority over everything that I do,
[1:47:37] all of my motives, all of my [music]
[1:47:39] prayers that I pray for, all of my
[1:47:40] needs. There's nothing more than I want
[1:47:43] to. No matter what you can give me, no
[1:47:46] matter what I can gain, there's [music]
[1:47:47] nothing greater than I give Jesus.
[1:47:49] number one, first place. Lord, that's
[1:47:53] our prayer tonight. I raise my hands,
[1:47:54] Lord, in identification, Lord. The word
[1:47:57] just pricricked our heart. We're
[1:47:59] thankful for that, Lord Jesus. Thankful,
[1:48:01] [music] Lord, that we can still be moved
[1:48:04] by your word.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; We live in such a world, Lord, where
[1:48:08] services and they've been preached to so
[1:48:10] much and heard sermon after sermon and
[1:48:12] gets to a place, Lord, where it doesn't
[1:48:14] even affect them. I'm just so thankful,
[1:48:16] Lord, that I can still be moved in my
[1:48:19] spirit by your word, Lord, where the
[1:48:21] word is [music] can stab me in the heart
[1:48:23] as they did on that day of Pentecost.
[1:48:26] Lord, when the Bible says they were
[1:48:28] pricricked in their heart, [music] Lord,
[1:48:30] thank you, Father, that you can still
[1:48:31] stir us, still speak to us, Lord. Thank
[1:48:34] you for using our brother Alex, Lord
[1:48:36] God, to deliver your word. Now, God, I
[1:48:38] just raise my hand and say, Lord,
[1:48:39] [music]
[1:48:40] I I I want to give you first place,
[1:48:43] first priority, God. May you be the
[1:48:45] first thought that I think of Lord when
[1:48:47] I wake up in the morning. May you
[1:48:49] [music] your word be the first thing
[1:48:51] upon my lips. Not my problems, not my
[1:48:54] Lord, even the goals that I'm trying to
[1:48:56] [music] attain or the Lord the tasks
[1:48:58] that I need to complete, Lord. But may I
[1:49:01] look to you first, Lord God. First above
[1:49:04] all things, [music] Jesus, I pray. Grant
[1:49:06] it now, Lord Jesus. I pray you'd, Lord,
[1:49:09] just minister to our brother Alex, Lord,
[1:49:11] as he's poured his heart out, Father, to
[1:49:13] be used, Lord. May you pour back into
[1:49:15] him. We ask it in Jesus name. Whatever
[1:49:21] it takes
[1:49:24] to draw [music and singing] closer
[1:49:28] to you, Lord. That's what [music]
[1:49:31] That's what
[1:49:34] I'll be willing
[1:49:37] to do.
[1:49:39] [music]
[1:49:43] And whatever [music and singing]
[1:49:47] it takes
[1:49:50] to be [singing]
[1:49:51] more
[1:49:53] like you. [music]
[1:49:55] That's what Oh, that's [singing] what
[1:49:59] I'll be willing
[1:50:02] to do. Could you raise your hands

[1:55:48] Sarah Smith and then those that are
[1:55:50] sick. Amen. Brother Alex, come now if
[1:55:52] you could pray here.
[1:55:56] [music] Let's believe together. Heavenly
[1:55:58] Father,
[1:55:59] Lord, there was many different needs
[1:56:02] represented here tonight. And besides
[1:56:04] that, many unspoken ones here just
[1:56:07] gathered around this altar this evening.
[1:56:11] Lord, the scripture says that many are
[1:56:13] the afflictions of the righteous, but
[1:56:16] that you would [music] deliver us out of
[1:56:17] them all. And we're thankful tonight.
[1:56:18] You never promised us a flowery bed of
[1:56:20] ease. We're not a bunch of hot bed
[1:56:22] plants tonight, [music] but we are
[1:56:24] ordained to endure and to overcome. And
[1:56:27] Father, we see the different things
[1:56:28] before us. But before any of these needs
[1:56:32] were known to us or voiced tonight,
[1:56:34] [music] you knew the need before we
[1:56:35] asked. And we believe that a divine
[1:56:38] provision has been made before [music]
[1:56:40] the foundation of the world. For you're
[1:56:42] still Jehovah Gyra tonight. You're the
[1:56:44] God that sees. You see it and you see to
[1:56:46] it. And you've undertaken for every
[1:56:48] situation tonight. Lord, just now we
[1:56:51] commit them into your hands. May you
[1:56:53] take these [music] trials and turn them
[1:56:55] into testimonies and trophies of your
[1:56:57] grace. Bless these different ones. We're
[1:57:00] so thankful you answer prayer, Lord. not
[1:57:02] just for our sakes tonight, but you said
[1:57:04] you would do it that the Father would be
[1:57:06] glorified. And we thank you. We rejoice
[1:57:08] now [music] and in time to come. That
[1:57:10] you are faithful to answer prayer and
[1:57:12] that you've seen these Lord. May you do
[1:57:14] exceeding abundantly above the things
[1:57:16] that we could ask or even think tonight
[1:57:19] and bless these children once more. We
[1:57:21] ask we thank you in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:57:24] Amen.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; We'll take [music] a minute if there's a
[1:57:27] testimony something pressing. We didn't
[1:57:29] I think do it last time. Anybody got
[1:57:31] anything [music] quick before we go?
[1:57:33] Testimony somebody wants to share. Amen.
[1:57:35] If not, we'll sing and let you. How many
[1:57:37] appreciate our brother Alex? Want to let
[1:57:39] our brother Alex know [music] how much
[1:57:40] you appreciated him. [applause] Amen.

[1:57:48] uh Sister Ruth. Amen. [music] Good

[1:57:52] was willing to serve and minister to us

[1:57:57] hand before you go before you're
[1:57:58] dismissed. Tell him, "God bless you.
[1:58:00] Good to see you all [music] in the house
[1:58:01] of the Lord." Lord willing, we'll see
