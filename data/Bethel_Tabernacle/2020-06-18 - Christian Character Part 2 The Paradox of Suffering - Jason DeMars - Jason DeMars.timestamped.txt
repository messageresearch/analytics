[0:00] good morning everyone god bless you
[0:03] let's stand and pray gracious Heavenly
[0:09] Father we just come to you now Lord and
[0:11] we ask that your Holy Spirit would be
[0:12] with us and speak to us Lord that you
[0:14] would take your word and open it to our
[0:17] hearts Lord may it may it be something
[0:20] that challenges us to come a little
[0:22] higher father yes we just want to commit
[0:25] ourselves to you for your glory we ask
[0:27] it in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[0:30] let's read from 2nd Timothy chapter 3
[0:34] and we're gonna continue on part 2 of
[0:37] Christian character and looking at the
[0:40] paradox of suffering 2nd Timothy chapter
[0:47] 3 and we're gonna start at verse 10 but
[0:52] thou has fully known my doctrine manner
[0:56] of life purpose faith long-suffering
[1:00] charity patience persecutions
[1:03] afflictions which came unto me at
[1:07] Antioch at Iconium at Lystra what
[1:09] persecutions I endured but all out of
[1:13] all of them the Lord delivered me yay
[1:16] and all that live God will live godly in
[1:19] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:22] may the Lord had the blessing to the
[1:24] reading of his word he can be seated so
[1:28] I was listening recently to a message by
[1:31] a non-denominational minister named Eric
[1:35] Ludi and he happened to be speaking a
[1:37] little bit about this topic and he used
[1:40] this illustration and said that for if I
[1:45] were to tell you you need to get ready
[1:47] to do a triathlon and you can say but
[1:50] that's gonna be really difficult and
[1:52] painful and I'm gonna be sore and it's
[1:55] gonna hurt well yeah that's what how you
[2:00] train your body to be able to do that is
[2:03] there's there's a side effect of pain
[2:06] and the reality is as when you live a
[2:10] godly life in this evil world where
[2:14] Satan is the Prince of power of the air
[2:16] the side effect that we get as
[2:19] Christians is suffering that is not
[2:23] naturally produced by living a godly
[2:26] life now if you don't live a godly life
[2:27] you do everything you can to fit in with
[2:30] the world it won't produce suffering
[2:32] just like me
[2:34] when I when someone says train for a
[2:39] triathlon I sit on my couch and drink a
[2:43] cup of coffee and say you go ahead and
[2:46] so I don't have the pain and suffering
[2:48] from working out well the same goes for
[2:54] people who profess to be followers of
[2:56] Jesus Christ if you're a genuine
[2:59] follower of Jesus Christ you will
[3:01] experience suffering you can't get away
[3:06] from it if you're not experiencing
[3:08] suffering then perhaps there's something
[3:10] wrong with your experience or your stand
[3:13] or something needs to take place in your
[3:15] letter needs to be repentance or a
[3:17] complete surrender of your life to Jesus
[3:21] Christ and when you do that you get the
[3:25] side effect of suffering you say well I
[3:29] didn't sign up for that well jesus said
[3:35] take up your cross and follow me that
[3:39] that statement right there
[3:41] at the very beginning should give you
[3:44] the picture yeah because a cross is a
[3:47] place of extreme torture and suffering
[3:50] we not not we're not looking for it
[3:53] we're not going and begging for people
[3:55] to cause us to suffer it's just a fact
[3:58] of how the Christian life works
[4:02] there will be demonic attacks there will
[4:05] be demonic attacks through people
[4:08] against you people will hate you and
[4:11] think they're doing God a service Jesus
[4:13] cetera that's the that's the side effect
[4:16] of living a godly life why would you
[4:17] expect
[4:18] that's when he said all that will live
[4:21] godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
[4:23] persecution as I said I talked about
[4:25] last week were shocked and surprised and
[4:27] surprised and dismayed speak against us
[4:31] when people say hey you can't do that
[4:33] you shouldn't do this why are you doing
[4:35] this and all other kinds of names that
[4:40] they call you expected expected if
[4:45] you're a young person listening expected
[4:47] and what did Paul say in verse 11 what
[4:53] persecutions I endured he didn't just
[5:01] just I'm just gonna take it he'd had
[5:05] endurance he had strength he went
[5:08] through that he didn't quit he didn't
[5:11] give up he didn't stop nothing could
[5:15] stop Paul only death would stop Paul not
[5:19] even prison would stop and so it needs
[5:23] to be the same with us okay people are
[5:25] speaking against you people are coming
[5:26] against you people people want to stop
[5:29] you from what you're doing and they
[5:34] called the master of the house Beelzebub
[5:36] what about those of his household you're
[5:39] going to experience suffering and you
[5:41] should expect it and you should be ready
[5:43] for it and you should say I'm ready to
[5:46] endure because the scripture says he
[5:49] that endures to the end shall be saved
[5:52] then it's not your strength anyways
[5:54] that's the amazing part it's it's his
[5:56] strength but you have to cut the goal go
[5:59] into it with grit the Bible says in Paul
[6:07] writing to the Corinthians quit you like
[6:09] men
[6:10] it literally means be a man Oh sisters
[6:16] say how how am I supposed to be a man
[6:17] Corinthians was not just written to men
[6:20] it was written to sisters as well to
[6:24] women as well and Paul said be a man
[6:27] sister
[6:29] but man he says you're a bride okay so
[6:34] what what what does it mean to be a man
[6:36] well today it means something different
[6:38] but when Paul wrote it when Paul wrote
[6:42] it being a man meant be strong you be
[6:47] the one to take the hit if there's an
[6:49] intruder in the house don't say I
[6:50] believe in women's rights when you go
[6:52] ahead you stand up and you're the one
[6:57] that goes and meets the trouble you're
[6:58] the one that goes and and Paul is
[7:00] writing that to us as Christians sisters
[7:03] brothers beat be a man step up be strong
[7:09] don't be a jellyfish don't be a baby
[7:12] take the hits take the punishment
[7:14] because you have the power to overcome
[7:17] don't don't be shocked or dismayed when
[7:20] people stand against you and don't even
[7:23] be shocked and dismayed when it's people
[7:25] in the church that do it sometimes
[7:27] that's the worst pains that you receive
[7:30] it happens we're not against anybody
[7:34] we're not trying to bring a fight but
[7:37] sometimes people bring the fight to us
[7:38] and the weapons are of our warfare are
[7:41] not carnal we're not retaliating Jesus
[7:46] said turn the other cheek so that
[7:49] doesn't mean that we're just soft and
[7:52] just let people do whatever with us but
[7:54] we respond with love we we try to
[7:58] understand where this person is coming
[7:59] when we try to have compassion we try to
[8:02] say we say I forgive you if you've been
[8:06] forgiven you can forgive others even if
[8:10] they don't ask you for forgiveness you
[8:13] can forgive them anyhow nobody was
[8:15] asking Jesus for forgiveness when he was
[8:19] speaking crucified on the cross he
[8:22] forgave them yeah before they said a
[8:24] word yeah while they were mocking him
[8:28] and so what about you and me
[8:35] Matthew 5:10 through 12 blessed are they
[8:39] which are persecuted for righteousness
[8:41] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[8:45] blessed are you when men shall revile
[8:47] you and persecute you and shall say all
[8:49] manner of evil against you falsely for
[8:52] my sake yeah but I don't feel very
[8:57] blessed when that happens and it feel
[9:04] that sometimes the water is really muddy
[9:07] and you look at yourself and saying
[9:10] maybe I maybe I did something wrong
[9:13] maybe it was maybe it was me and it's
[9:15] coming from another person that
[9:17] confesses to be even a messege believer
[9:20] what should you do how should you
[9:23] respond I don't think the if you've done
[9:25] something wrong you God will reveal it
[9:28] to your heart yeah then you make it
[9:31] right but if you haven't done anything
[9:33] wrong and you know in your heart and
[9:35] your conscience you are doing the will
[9:37] of God and people are coming against you
[9:40] what should you do
[9:42] retaliate what does the Bible say to do
[9:49] yeah love your enemy do good for them
[9:53] was it in Luke Luke 6 is kind of a
[9:58] parallel passage to this I've got it
[10:02] further in my notes but I'll bring it
[10:03] now Luke 6 22 and 23 blessed are ye when
[10:07] men shall hate you and when they shall
[10:09] separate you from their company and
[10:11] shall reproach you and cast out your
[10:12] name as evil for the son of man's sake
[10:15] rejoice ye and that day and leap for joy
[10:17] behold your reward is great in heaven
[10:20] for in like manner did their fathers
[10:21] under the prophets so if people speak
[10:24] against you how should you respond you
[10:27] should leap for joy
[10:31] huh just do it doesn't mean you have to
[10:36] feel it just be obedient leap for joy
[10:40] when people speak against it that goes I
[10:42] want to go cry in my room are you a
[10:45] Christian or no are you a believer or no
[10:50] if you're a believer then you should
[10:53] want to obey the word and the word says
[10:55] if people speak against you leap for joy
[10:58] so let's start leap that's doing some
[11:01] leaping some of you like me my leaping
[11:04] his skills are not good some some some
[11:08] of you that are AIDS challenged you're
[11:12] leaping skills might not be good but
[11:14] just give it a good throw your hands in
[11:16] the air
[11:18] [Music]
[11:23] john stott british theologian wrote how
[11:28] did jesus expect his disciples to react
[11:30] under persecution in matthew Twite 5:12
[11:34] he said rejoice and be glad we're not to
[11:38] retaliate like an unbeliever nor sulk
[11:41] like a child no lick our wounds and
[11:44] self-pity like a dog nor just grin and
[11:47] bear it like a stoic still less pretend
[11:50] we enjoy it like a masochist what then
[11:53] we are to rejoice as a Christian should
[11:56] and even leap for joy it has to be
[12:02] deeper though than just mere external
[12:05] responses that we train ourselves to do
[12:09] the world the world does that people
[12:11] reform themselves that's fine I'm glad
[12:14] when people reform themselves but that's
[12:16] not Christianity Christianity is a new
[12:19] birth it's a transformation from the
[12:21] inside out so how do I respond to trials
[12:27] suffering persecution the way Jesus told
[12:31] me I ought to respond and there's I'm
[12:35] sure there's more but I looked at this
[12:37] and I saw four different things one was
[12:40] a vision for what God has called you to
[12:42] be to
[12:44] a sense that this is not your home 3 an
[12:48] inner supernatural peace and confidence
[12:52] that every trial comes to us through
[12:55] God's providence for the supernatural
[13:00] power of God in the ables agape love
[13:03] within us so I want to break these down
[13:06] so in 1 a vision for what God has called
[13:10] you to be first John 3:2 beloved now are
[13:13] we the sons of God and it does not yet
[13:15] appear what we shall be but we know that
[13:18] when he shall appear we shall be like
[13:20] him for we shall see him as he is
[13:24] your carrier of God's life you're a part
[13:29] of God every son is a part of their
[13:32] parents genetically a part of their
[13:34] parents
[13:34] so you're genetically a part of your
[13:37] Heavenly parent you his life courses
[13:41] through your veins so you know who you
[13:45] are in him you know the authority that
[13:47] he has given you as a son of God and
[13:49] your you have the confidence to take
[13:52] that authority it starts right from
[13:54] there jesus knew who he was there was no
[13:59] confusion and he knew God's purpose for
[14:02] him so that when he when he met every
[14:05] trial every difficulty he faced it like
[14:08] a man I think of Jesus in the Garden of
[14:12] Gethsemane what what at the hand he knew
[14:16] what was going to happen to him he knew
[14:18] the suffering that was gonna come and he
[14:21] did it he stood there in the dark in a
[14:27] garden he knew this place you just bring
[14:31] salt and he knows he says whatever you
[14:33] do do it quickly so he knows exactly
[14:36] what's coming and he he prays and he's
[14:40] trying to get his disciples to see and
[14:42] eventually he says they sleep on and
[14:45] he's alone completely alone the whole
[14:48] everyone has forsaken him and he stands
[14:52] there and he comes and he's he meets
[14:54] them who are you looking for
[14:56] you and I would say there come let's he
[15:00] could have good me of very easily even
[15:04] even when they tried to throw him off
[15:05] the cliff all he did was just walk
[15:07] through the crowd and he was he could
[15:10] have but he laid his life down now
[15:15] that's a man that is that is what it
[15:19] means to be a man he meant danger he met
[15:26] that for you and me what about us
[15:29] can we meet that for our brothers and
[15:32] sisters did we have that kind of love in
[15:35] our heart to meet suffering and shame
[15:38] head-on like a man say how can you talk
[15:42] about being a man you're crying up there
[15:44] a man experiences all the emotions but
[15:51] he stands up and says I will meet this
[15:53] head-on not for myself but for the glory
[15:57] of God for my love for other people yeah
[16:01] yeah you but you can only do that
[16:04] starting when you know who you are and
[16:07] you know God's purpose for you if you
[16:10] don't know that you're gonna remain
[16:12] confused and you won't have confidence
[16:15] to take your step and take your stand
[16:18] number two a sense that this is not your
[16:22] home it isn't your home
[16:25] we're not citizens here we are citizens
[16:28] of here but ultimately where is our
[16:32] citizenship Philippians 3:20 from the
[16:35] ESV version but our citizenship is in
[16:39] heaven and from it we await a savior the
[16:43] Lord Jesus Christ that's our home that's
[16:46] where we belong is heaven
[16:48] not here Hebrews 11:14 for they that say
[16:53] such things declare plainly that they
[16:57] seek a country are you seeking a country
[17:00] do you have a heavenly vision or is your
[17:04] vision focused here and now
[17:07] verse 16 in the same chapter of Hebrews
[17:10] but now they desire a better country
[17:13] that is in heavenly wherefore God is not
[17:17] ashamed to be called their God for he
[17:18] hath prepared for them a city God's
[17:21] prepared a city for us are you looking
[17:24] for it are you waiting for it sadly most
[17:26] Christians are just living for the year
[17:27] and now they're looking for prosperity
[17:30] here and now that's that's the hope of
[17:34] most Christians but aren't that's not
[17:36] our hope are our citizenship is in
[17:38] heaven our hope is in heaven we still we
[17:42] understand the truth of the message that
[17:44] the Lord has come down with the shout
[17:46] and yet there's a man interceding for us
[17:48] in heaven and we await to see him
[17:50] literally appear for us we're waiting
[17:53] for that that's where it because that's
[17:55] where our citizenship is that's where we
[17:58] came from revelation 21 verse 4 and this
[18:01] really gives us an understanding when
[18:03] we're going through suffering and trials
[18:06] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[18:10] their eyes and there shall be no more
[18:13] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[18:16] shall there be any more pain for the
[18:18] former things are passed away that's
[18:24] that's where we belong that's where we
[18:26] come from that's where we're going to
[18:27] where there's no pain there's no
[18:30] suffering we can suffer now because
[18:34] there's a joy that is set before us
[18:37] same thing for Jesus he could suffer he
[18:41] could submit himself to a cruel death
[18:43] because of the joy the reward that of
[18:45] the glory that was set before him we can
[18:48] - yeah we can choose the way with the
[18:51] Lord's despise whew we can choose the
[18:54] way of suffering that's what the
[18:57] Christian Way is there's many other ways
[19:00] that are called Christian but the
[19:02] Christian way is the way of trial of
[19:06] difficulty number three an inner
[19:11] supernatural peace and confidence the
[19:14] every trial comes to us through God's
[19:17] providence a lot can be said about this
[19:20] one first scripture that comes to my
[19:23] mind with on this was John 19 9 through
[19:27] 11 and when again into the judgment Hall
[19:30] and saith unto Jesus whence art thou but
[19:33] Jesus gave him no answer then saith
[19:36] Pilate unto him speakest thou not unto
[19:38] me knowest thou not that I am power to
[19:41] crucify thee and have power to release
[19:44] the pilot never talked to a man like
[19:46] this before he was used to people say
[19:50] look I didn't do anything it's not my
[19:52] fault I I can pay you I can do this I
[19:56] can do that he's just silent yeah but
[20:01] when he said this I have power over you
[20:03] Jesus had to correct it jesus answered
[20:07] thou couldst have no power at all
[20:08] against me except it were given thee
[20:12] from above what an understanding he knew
[20:18] some of us we say I don't know in this
[20:21] situation in this situation if God has
[20:24] placed me in this and I don't stop if
[20:29] you're in that situation God has placed
[20:31] you in that situation if you're a
[20:34] Christian you understand that God's
[20:36] providence has you here now for a
[20:40] purpose and whatever is being done
[20:43] whatever is being accomplished
[20:45] he knows sometimes that's just enough he
[20:48] knows yeah yeah and he's with me and
[20:52] whatever you're going through
[20:54] God can God will take care of it Paul
[20:57] had Paul where the first Scripture we
[20:59] read you know the sufferings
[21:01] persecutions that I went through I
[21:04] endured them but the Lord out of them
[21:08] all the Lord delivered me so we have to
[21:11] endure them and we can have confidence
[21:13] the Lord will deliver them that's based
[21:15] at Scripture many are the afflictions of
[21:18] the righteous but the Lord delivered
[21:19] them
[21:20] in the mall doesn't mean it doesn't mean
[21:23] there's no affliction
[21:24] there is affliction many but the Lord
[21:28] will deliver you sometimes that
[21:30] deliverance is that city that we're
[21:33] looking for that's okay
[21:36] that's really good Genesis 50 19 and 20
[21:42] we know the story of Joseph and his
[21:44] brothers they were afraid he was going
[21:47] to kill him and finally get back with
[21:48] him now that his father was dead and
[21:52] Joseph said unto them fear not for am I
[21:55] in the place of God but as for you you
[21:58] thought evil against me but God meant it
[22:01] unto good to bring it to pass as it is
[22:04] this day to save much people alive I
[22:08] think look I look up look out at all
[22:11] these faces and each one has a story and
[22:14] a testimony of trials and suffering some
[22:18] of you say I don't know I still don't
[22:21] know why that happened I don't I still
[22:23] don't know what the purpose was one day
[22:25] you will some of you do know and you
[22:28] regionally singing glorifying God
[22:30] because of it
[22:31] but those of you that don't know there
[22:33] is a reason the devil minute for evil
[22:37] but God means it for good yeah and to
[22:40] save much people alive so just have that
[22:44] confidence job 2 9 and 10 then said his
[22:50] wife unto him does thou still retain the
[22:52] integrity curse God and die but he said
[22:56] under now speakers as one of the foolish
[22:58] women speaketh what shall receive good
[23:01] at the hand of God
[23:02] and shall we not receive evil in all
[23:06] this did not drove sin with his lips he
[23:09] knew that what was happening to him
[23:12] as much as he struggled as as much as he
[23:15] cried he knew that God was in it and God
[23:20] had a purpose for it God was going to
[23:24] show that to job job just simply had
[23:27] it's up for us to have faith and
[23:30] confidence that God is the orchestrator
[23:33] of all
[23:34] our circumstances I'm not gonna read all
[23:38] the verses but I'm just gonna refer to
[23:39] the story King David was chased out of
[23:43] the capital city Jerusalem by his son
[23:47] Absalom and as he was going one of the
[23:51] sons of one of one of the shimmie I was
[23:56] his name
[23:56] throwing stones and spitting at David
[24:00] and David still had his guard around him
[24:03] and they said we're gonna kill that man
[24:05] for doing that to you David said what if
[24:10] the don't do that the Lord told him to
[24:13] do that to me it may be that the Lord
[24:17] will look on the rock wrong done to me
[24:19] that the Lord will repay me with good
[24:21] for his cursing today David had
[24:24] confidence that God controlled his
[24:26] circumstances that God didn't eat even
[24:30] though he was being cursed spit on
[24:33] stones thrown at him he could entrust
[24:35] himself to the Lord the Lord is the one
[24:39] that takes vengeance not us we commit
[24:42] ourselves to him he can do with us if
[24:46] it's his will for us to die if it's his
[24:49] will for us to go to prison it's his
[24:51] will for us to suffer so be it so be it
[24:55] we rejoice and we live and behave like a
[24:59] Christian regardless of the
[25:00] circumstances and in closing we'll go on
[25:05] number 4 the supernatural power of God
[25:08] that enables agape love
[25:10] that's from Romans 5:5 and hope maketh
[25:13] not ashamed because the love of God is
[25:15] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[25:18] Ghost which is given unto us and that
[25:22] enables us to fulfill Luke 6:27 which
[25:25] says but I say unto you which hear love
[25:27] your enemies do good to them which hate
[25:31] you
[25:31] do good to them don't just tolerate them
[25:36] be nice to them be kind do something
[25:38] good for them something God is in
[25:41] control of how you treat me
[25:42] my response is love
[25:45] and you can do that truly do that only
[25:49] by the power of God the power of the
[25:52] Holy Ghost
[25:53] inside of you outside of that you're not
[25:56] able so let's close gracious father we
[26:02] come to you and we thank you so much for
[26:04] your word we thank you so much for its
[26:07] encouragement Lord its conviction its
[26:11] challenge to us Lord yes we need you we
[26:16] can't we can't do these things on our

[26:20] not human responses this is not human
[26:23] fleshly reactions this is this is this
[26:27] is you this is your character your
[26:32] nature Lord and that's what we want in
[26:33] our lives regardless of the
[26:36] circumstances of situations where we're
[26:38] at where we might not be the
[26:40] disappointments the hurts we want to
[26:42] have the character of Jesus Christ so
