[6:48] selves covetous boasters proud
[6:51] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[6:54] unthankful unholy
[6:56] without natural affection truce breakers
[6:59] false accusers incontinent fierce
[7:03] despisers of those
[7:05] that are good now you would you would
[7:08] think after that kind of a bullet list
[7:11] man how much worse could it be well hang
[7:13] on
[7:14] it gets worse but wait it gets worse
[7:17] traitors
[7:19] heady high-minded
[7:21] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[7:23] god
[7:24] having a form of godliness but denying
[7:27] the power thereof from such turn away
[7:31] now i also want to um
[7:34] read a little further on but we will
[7:36] just uh pray and i'll let you be seated

[7:41] let's pray father
[7:42] we thank you lord for your word your
[7:45] revealed word to us in this hour
[7:47] we ask now lord that you give us the
[7:49] unction of the spirit that we might
[7:52] deliver a burden of the word on our
[7:54] heart for the people we commit it to you
[7:56] now in jesus christ's name god bless you
[7:59] you can be seated friends god bless you
[8:02] amen amen praise the lord
[8:08] amen
[8:14] oh yeah here we go uh second let's go
[8:17] right to the next chapter please um
[8:20] g-man 2 chapter 4 2 timothy chapter 4.
[8:26] continues on with some other admonitions
[8:28] i charge thee therefore before god
[8:31] and the lord jesus christ
[8:33] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[8:35] at his appearing and his kingdom
[8:38] preach the word be instant in season
[8:42] out of season
[8:43] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[8:46] long-suffering and doctrine
[8:49] for the time will come when they will
[8:51] not endure sound doctrine
[8:53] but after their own lust shall they heap
[8:56] to themselves teachers having itching
[8:59] ears and they shall turn away their ears
[9:01] from the truth and shall be turned unto
[9:05] fables but watch thou in all things
[9:08] amen
[9:09] now
[9:11] by the help of the lord i i want to
[9:14] speak to you this morning let's okay
[9:16] let's have it let's have it up get in
[9:18] there's only two slides so you can just
[9:19] run it for me
[9:21] i want to take a little sunday school
[9:22] lesson this morning
[9:24] on tribulation approaching
[9:27] where we are
[9:29] in prophecy and just hold right there on
[9:30] the title slide
[9:32] where we are in prophecy
[9:35] it is interesting to me and this thought
[9:38] actually came on my heart
[9:40] uh from when brother diggs was preaching
[9:43] the last wednesday and i thought he read
[9:46] actually read this passage that we read
[9:49] in 2 timothy 3 i'm sure it's still fresh
[9:52] on your mind
[9:54] but as he was reading it one of the
[9:56] points that brother diggs pointed out
[9:59] was that having a form of godliness
[10:02] but denying the power this is people who
[10:05] literally go to church
[10:08] but yet
[10:09] but yet they're everything above that
[10:12] list
[10:13] they're everything above they go to
[10:15] church but the people that i'm talking
[10:18] about
[10:20] are lovers of their own selves and
[10:22] covetous and boasters and proud and
[10:25] blasphemers
[10:27] people that go to church are traitors
[10:29] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[10:32] more than lovers of god they do go to
[10:35] church they do have a form of godliness
[10:37] but they deny the power brother adam
[10:39] said they deny the reality of the living
[10:41] god to live in their lives and
[10:44] everything becomes just a
[10:47] uh just becomes works and becomes a you
[10:49] know some kind of a standard i was
[10:52] i was speaking to
[10:54] my son chris and i we were out
[10:56] exercising the other day we were walking
[10:58] the bridge and it's a wonderful time of
[11:00] fellowship for he and i and i keep
[11:02] telling chris chris when are you going
[11:03] to bring some of these thoughts and
[11:04] teach a sunday school class for us
[11:07] uh because man it just it just comes out
[11:09] of that guy it just flows and i get plum
[11:11] excited and i start preaching next thing
[11:13] you know we're having a jubilee trying
[11:14] to walk and exercise so we're we're you
[11:17] know bodily exercise profiteth a little
[11:20] right
[11:21] but spiritual exercise is much better
[11:23] and you know we got to talking about the
[11:26] difference between the religions in the
[11:28] world and having traveled the world i
[11:31] have met and nearly come you know come
[11:33] into contact with certainly with all of
[11:35] the leading religions of the world the
[11:37] major ones that we would talk about of
[11:39] course would be christianity and then
[11:41] there'd be the the religion of islam
[11:44] there would be buddhists there would be
[11:45] hindus there would be you know various
[11:47] many many many others down the line
[11:50] after that
[11:51] and you know i was
[11:53] saying to chris i said you know
[11:55] that if someone were to ask me
[11:57] you know why do you choose christianity
[12:02] over islam or over the buddha or over
[12:06] any of these other religions and my
[12:07] answer as a world traveler would be very
[12:10] authoritative i could say listen
[12:13] you know the the the message of islam uh
[12:17] the religion of islam when it's kept in
[12:19] its purest form is a very noble religion
[12:22] they i've been around the muslims who
[12:24] are real muslims now i'm not talking
[12:25] about radical islam just like we have
[12:28] radical christians and radical catholics
[12:30] but i'm talking about real true muslims
[12:33] real true buddhists real true hindus
[12:36] they are
[12:37] they i have found them to be very noble
[12:39] very very they actually talk about the
[12:43] in betterment of living a life of
[12:45] righteousness and holiness they believe
[12:48] in that
[12:48] they believe in holiness standards they
[12:50] believe in in living righteousness i
[12:53] mean that's the whole philosophy of
[12:54] buddhism is to overcome this flesh and
[12:58] through enlightenment see through
[13:00] enlightenment to put this flesh
[13:02] under control so that you can live you
[13:05] know a higher level of human life islam
[13:09] is the same way
[13:11] they have they share many of the same
[13:14] tenants and same goals they believe in a
[13:16] paradise that after you leave here
[13:19] you'll go to a paradise now
[13:21] they don't mention a lot about a
[13:22] resurrection and things like that uh
[13:25] they believe that their elijah muhammad
[13:27] will their prophet elijah muhammad will
[13:29] resurrect of course he hasn't in all of
[13:32] these thousands of years but but but
[13:34] nonetheless the parallels are very
[13:37] striking
[13:38] when you are between being a real
[13:40] christian being a real muslim being a
[13:42] real buddhist uh now
[13:44] so then so then so then the question
[13:46] comes back well then why would you
[13:49] choose
[13:50] christianity
[13:52] because that in christianity
[13:55] jesus christ promised something that
[13:59] none of the others even even even aim at
[14:02] and that is that he said
[14:05] i will be with you even in you and and
[14:08] paul said i become a new creation in
[14:11] christ the old me passes away only
[14:14] christ offers you
[14:17] to have the very god of creation living
[14:20] inside you
[14:21] and to change your nature in your soul
[14:26] the other religions while they have very
[14:28] noble aspirations
[14:30] it's all about willpower it's all about
[14:33] legalism it's all about works it's all
[14:36] about hampering you know putting this
[14:38] flesh under my feet i'm glad i don't
[14:40] have to do that i'm glad the holy ghost
[14:42] done that for me
[14:44] and so jesus so christianity has a
[14:48] natural advantage over all other
[14:50] religions in that it changes you into a
[14:53] brand new person
[14:55] so that now it's not hard to desire
[14:58] holiness you wake up desiring it it's
[15:00] not hard it's not difficult to to
[15:03] disdain sin and ungodliness your nature
[15:07] within you now sure you've still got
[15:09] this flesh to deal with of course we
[15:12] still have to overcome but i'm glad that
[15:14] in the soul realm which is the real man
[15:17] that man in the engine room that's the
[15:19] man who really controls everything i'm
[15:21] glad that there's a power in me that
[15:24] helps me to bring this flesh under
[15:27] subjection
[15:29] now then
[15:30] now there's a second layer so then my my
[15:33] my argument then goes further to say
[15:36] since jesus christ
[15:38] made that promise and he's the only one
[15:40] who did he's the only one who even
[15:42] offered to do it
[15:44] and then he actually did it he said how
[15:47] do you know because he did it to me
[15:49] he did it inside of me then quite
[15:52] naturally i'm gonna go back and believe
[15:55] everything else he said i mean if he
[15:57] said i'll come in and change your nature
[15:59] and he did and he came in and he changed
[16:01] my nature then why would i not believe
[16:04] him when he said i am the way the truth
[16:09] and the life
[16:11] why would i doubt that i mean here is
[16:14] here is some here is a man who offered
[16:17] to do something inside of a human being
[16:20] that is impossible to do for yourself
[16:23] and there's no other human being can do
[16:25] it for you to you in you through you
[16:29] what jesus simply was promising could
[16:32] only be accomplished by the supernatural
[16:37] power of almighty god
[16:40] and since that has happened inside of me
[16:43] then that informs my thinking as to his
[16:46] identity and when he says he's the son
[16:48] of god yeah i'm gonna believe that when
[16:51] he says i'll i'll i'll come into you and
[16:53] i'll sup with you and and you with me i
[16:55] believe that i see it and when he says
[16:57] i'm the way the truth and the life i i'm
[17:00] sorry but there's no way i could accept
[17:03] islam or buddhism or hinduism or
[17:06] anything they don't even offer me that
[17:08] and there's no evidence that anything
[17:10] they say is even true but christ proves
[17:13] his word by by performing in you and i
[17:18] and we all know
[17:20] that no one could make us this
[17:23] we all know we can all look each other
[17:25] in the eye and say it's not me it's him
[17:28] it's by his grace
[17:31] see and so so for me
[17:34] christianity is the very obvious choice
[17:37] so now you've got so now you come to a
[17:40] further category
[17:41] and can you imagine for a moment
[17:44] that people would choose christianity
[17:47] but choose to not let it have its
[17:50] greatest effect and main purpose for
[17:52] even being
[17:53] amen
[17:54] they would take a form of christianity
[17:57] but they would keep their their their
[17:59] traitor attitude their headiness their
[18:02] high-mindedness their lovers of pleasure
[18:05] more than lovers of god they're proud
[18:06] blasphemous boasters incontinent fierce
[18:09] despisers of those that are good they
[18:12] would choose as brother branham said
[18:14] the fine qualities of jesus christ
[18:18] but deny the power deny the reality of
[18:22] the living god which is the very reason
[18:25] christ came that's the reason the holy
[18:28] ghost that's what the holy ghost is
[18:29] given for is not to just have you join a
[18:33] church and not to just have you live a
[18:35] certain standard but to literally change
[18:38] your inner nature so that you crave to
[18:42] be like this and it comes out of you
[18:45] automatically amen
[18:48] so when we come to this term and paul
[18:51] begins to say
[18:53] they won't endure sound doctrine they'll
[18:55] they'll be turned aside from from truth
[18:58] unto fables
[19:01] it's an interesting term because
[19:03] the word fable
[19:05] is very similar it's a greek word muthas
[19:09] which is very similar sounding to the
[19:12] term we're more familiar with logos
[19:15] and we all know what the logos was it
[19:17] was that which came out of god and was
[19:18] god it was god taking a form all right
[19:21] now
[19:22] in fact is not only do muthos and logos
[19:26] sound the same
[19:27] and that's why paul used them because
[19:29] one is truth and one is a fable but
[19:31] they're both a story or words or
[19:34] declaration but one is the truth and one
[19:37] is a fable
[19:39] and in fact is muthus and logos
[19:42] when they begin
[19:43] mean the exact same thing word
[19:47] but what happens is though they begin
[19:50] identical
[19:51] once they start going a little while
[19:54] down the road and mutha starts just you
[19:56] can't hardly tell but it just starts a
[19:58] little bit of a turn
[20:00] and then as it goes further it turns
[20:02] more and as it goes further it turns
[20:04] more and finally downrange
[20:07] you know like you're trying to zero in a
[20:09] gun and and you're you're you might be
[20:12] an inch off at the barrel but by the
[20:14] time you get 200 yards downrange you're
[20:16] going to be feet off
[20:18] and by the time it gets down to the end
[20:20] of the line muthost has completely
[20:22] twisted around until finally it's
[20:24] nothing but a fable
[20:26] it's so completely mongrelized the truth
[20:29] and paul is saying now i want you to
[20:31] grasp this
[20:32] paul is saying that people were actually
[20:35] following the truth
[20:38] and god turned aside
[20:40] unto fables
[20:43] i mean that to me that is that would be
[20:45] so devastating on the day of
[20:47] of of of the the judgment and uh you
[20:51] know the disclosing of all men's hearts
[20:54] to stand there and realize and see it
[20:56] played back that god actually revealed
[20:58] his truth to you and you believed it and
[20:59] walked in it and you're standing there
[21:01] now and you're standing under a fable
[21:03] you completely walked away from the word
[21:07] i mean that takes my breath away when i
[21:08] think about that i say lord god help me
[21:10] ever to stay true to the truth
[21:14] that's why i'm so thankful for a message
[21:17] that's why i'm so thankful that uh god
[21:19] would send a prophet
[21:21] with the express purpose to take all of
[21:24] the man-made debris and clutter and move
[21:27] it away and and get rid of it so that
[21:29] you could actually see the scriptures
[21:32] the amen like me too brother joe amen
[21:35] and that is what god has done now
[21:38] when i come to
[21:40] this idea
[21:42] of this scripture as it relates to
[21:44] tribulation approaching
[21:46] i had this thought wednesday night
[21:50] when we read these words about how that
[21:53] it's perilous times and it goes down
[21:55] this long list i mean
[21:59] it's like as if wow paul you just like
[22:02] emptied the dictionary on bad things
[22:06] i don't you didn't hardly leave it
[22:07] nothing left i mean
[22:09] i don't think it could
[22:10] possibly excuse me
[22:13] i don't think you could possibly have
[22:16] a a more bleak picture
[22:19] of the end time amen
[22:21] now here's the here's here's the catch
[22:24] what the day he was talking about you're
[22:27] living in it
[22:29] it's now
[22:31] and sometimes i wonder
[22:33] if people really believe what paul is
[22:37] saying
[22:40] sometimes the way
[22:42] and you know even within my own self
[22:44] i've had to say at times
[22:46] you know here you are
[22:47] and this is going on and this is going
[22:49] on
[22:50] are you really grasping
[22:53] the gravity
[22:54] of what he's saying this age would be
[22:57] does it sink in on you
[23:00] that this age
[23:02] is completely anointed
[23:05] it's anointing humanity
[23:09] don't know why my throat is doing that
[23:11] it worked fine on my bible study this
[23:12] morning
[23:13] amen but praise the lord we're going to
[23:15] carry right on
[23:17] probably because i'm trying not to
[23:18] preach and usually when i preach i blow
[23:20] it white out and then i'm good to go
[23:22] so i'm trying to hold my horses a little
[23:24] bit this morning
[23:25] but we find that
[23:28] that when you really take in
[23:30] the gravity of the words
[23:33] and then you see the way that people
[23:36] live
[23:38] brushing rubbing shoulders with
[23:40] carnality in their lives and listen
[23:42] friends i mean
[23:43] let let let it let the chips fall where
[23:46] they fall in us today we're sitting here
[23:48] listening to this i mean have you
[23:50] grasped but i had to ask myself those
[23:52] who might be streaming today have you
[23:54] fully grasp
[23:55] i had to look at myself in the mirror of
[23:57] god's word and say jason have you fully
[23:59] grasp
[24:00] do you realize how
[24:03] just how dire a picture paul is painting
[24:07] because there's this tendency just to
[24:09] carry on into the world
[24:11] as if carnal things don't matter it just
[24:14] doesn't matter i can dabble in this i
[24:16] can dabble in that i can let my children
[24:18] do this church doesn't mean all that
[24:21] much i don't even need to be there it's
[24:23] not all that important if my children
[24:24] are even there and people who operate
[24:28] that way would never openly say
[24:30] well that's not even true it's important
[24:32] to me that i'm at church and it's
[24:33] important to me that my children are
[24:34] church well then why aren't you and why
[24:36] aren't they
[24:38] and why why is their appearance rare and
[24:41] why is their appearance late and why is
[24:43] their appearance you know uh
[24:46] why what then why is the appearance of
[24:48] the world lingering
[24:50] i mean these are serious questions
[24:52] friends that we really need to ask
[24:55] ourselves because i'm here to tell you
[24:57] there's a tribulation approaching
[25:01] i wonder give me my my next slide i
[25:03] think it's the only one i got brother
[25:04] jackson
[25:06] i wonder if people
[25:07] really realize what this means right
[25:10] amen
[25:11] do you really
[25:12] comprehend this is a headline from a
[25:15] major news organization
[25:18] and this one if i read you the article
[25:21] the whole thing that
[25:23] western powers are scrambling over
[25:26] is there in fear
[25:28] that
[25:29] vladimir putin will use nuclear weapons
[25:34] now
[25:34] it's good that they fear that because he
[25:37] will
[25:38] he's i don't know if it'll be him
[25:40] particularly but brother branham said
[25:42] thus saith the lord russia
[25:44] will drop a bomb on the vatican
[25:48] and the bible in the book of revelation
[25:50] records that her her torment and her end
[25:52] came in an hour
[25:54] and that shipment and captains and
[25:57] seafaring people will be out at sea and
[26:00] they can't come in for nuclear because
[26:02] of the fear they the bible says the fear
[26:04] of her torment which is nuclear fire and
[26:07] there and nuclear radiation and they're
[26:10] going to lament because rome is the
[26:13] hinge pin they're the they're the
[26:15] they're the the hub that makes western
[26:17] civilization go a lot of people don't
[26:19] aren't aware of that but that is
[26:21] absolutely provable
[26:24] and i'm talking about the the
[26:26] capitalism and world commerce and
[26:28] through craft and the bible says that
[26:31] the that the roman system will lead the
[26:33] whole world
[26:34] and rule the whole world through that
[26:36] commerce and craft
[26:39] through these things and here you're
[26:41] going to drop an atomic bomb on the very
[26:44] heart of western civilization
[26:48] and set off no doubt chain reaction
[26:51] leading to armageddon
[26:53] so the thing about this is sometimes we
[26:56] we need to look at a headline like this
[26:58] and there might need to be a time where
[27:00] you need to shake yourself
[27:02] and say my goodness i i actually live in
[27:05] bible times
[27:07] i really have arrived at the time that
[27:09] brother branham said the world is crazy
[27:12] and he says i'll prophesy to you it will
[27:14] get worse and worse until it goes
[27:18] completely insane
[27:21] and he talks about people losing their
[27:23] mind in their imaginary mind seeing
[27:25] creatures roam the earth and fly through
[27:27] the heavens unimaginable of unimaginable
[27:30] scale
[27:31] and and and these things are going to
[27:33] actually happen in people's imaginary
[27:36] mind and brother ramsay they're going to
[27:37] run and scream and be crazy and friends
[27:40] we're here
[27:42] i mean if there was ever a time when
[27:43] parents need to pinch their conscience
[27:46] when old people young people married
[27:48] people single people boys girls men
[27:51] women little children need to be
[27:52] understanding this that the the
[27:55] tribulation is approaching and as i've
[27:58] said to you before the only way out is
[28:02] up
[28:04] and i want to go up friends
[28:07] when i look at these scriptures in these
[28:10] verses i my recommendation to you today
[28:13] is go home and read this third chapter
[28:15] of ii timothy and read where we read
[28:17] into the fourth chapter and sit down
[28:20] quietly and talk to the lord and say

[28:27] this mean for my family what does this
[28:29] mean for my relationships what does this
[28:31] mean in my career and my job and my
[28:33] pursuits of excellence where where does
[28:36] this awareness
[28:40] fit in my plans
[28:42] don't let me just go off living life
[28:45] and not paying any attention
[28:48] to the most important book ever given to
[28:51] humanity

[29:01] a hard look at the scriptures and the
