[1:54] everyone
[1:56] God bless you let's stand
[1:59] we'll
[2:00] read our scripture and then approach the
[2:02] Lord in prayer John 17. verse 3. I want
[2:06] to speak
[2:08] this morning Sunday school on knowing
[2:10] him is life
[2:13] and this is life eternal
[2:16] that they might know the the only true
[2:19] God in Jesus Christ whom thou has sent
[2:23] Heavenly Father we come to you Lord and
[2:25] we're so thankful
[2:27] that we know you Lord
[2:29] we are so thankful that you've called us
[2:32] and that you've changed us and you've
[2:34] given us eyes to see and ears to hear
[2:38] not facts and knowledge about you but
[2:41] knowing you personally
[2:43] and knowing your purposes in our lives
[2:46] Lord your plan for us and your plan for
[2:50] your people in this hour Lord we're so
[2:52] thankful for that we ask that your Holy
[2:55] Spirit would come and take your word and
[2:57] make it live
[2:58] in our hearts Lord we're we're so needy
[3:01] both both
[3:03] speaker and hearer so desperately needy
[3:06] and our desire is that you would come
[3:08] and take your word and write it upon our
[3:11] hearts we ask these things in the name
[3:13] of Jesus Christ amen can be seated
[3:20] knowing him is life
[3:24] we want to know God in truth
[3:26] and
[3:28] if if we misinterpret who God is
[3:31] or you do not approach him scripturally
[3:35] you're walking in ignorance which is
[3:39] okay just don't stay there
[3:43] or the worst part would be you would be
[3:45] willfully turning away from him or
[3:48] willfully rejecting
[3:50] his revelation of himself
[3:54] that's where the grave danger is
[3:55] ignorance is not as much of a problem as
[3:58] willful rejection
[4:01] ignorance you could say you just need to
[4:03] be taught you just need to learn you
[4:05] know that's what that's what we do as
[4:07] missionaries you go into the missions
[4:08] field and you don't assume they know
[4:10] everything you go and say they have to
[4:12] be taught
[4:13] and then if they are not not taking heed
[4:16] to what God is saying then you bring the
[4:19] rebuke
[4:20] God can deal with someone that's
[4:22] ignorant but someone that willfully
[4:24] refuses to hearken unto the word of the
[4:27] Lord
[4:28] there's there's not there's no hope
[4:34] Jeremiah 9.
[4:36] verse 23 and 22.
[4:41] thus saith the Lord
[4:43] let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[4:47] neither let the Mighty Man in glory in
[4:51] his might let not the rich man glory in
[4:54] his riches
[4:55] but let him that glorieth glory in this
[4:58] that he understandeth and knoweth me
[5:01] that I am the Lord which exercise loving
[5:04] kindness judgment and righteousness in
[5:07] the Earth for in these things I Delight
[5:10] saith the Lord
[5:12] so you you see this is what our this is
[5:15] what our first Pursuit should be is
[5:18] knowing him
[5:20] brother Branham says this in the
[5:23] um
[5:24] sermon uh the works that I do bear
[5:26] witness of me in 1951. he says so
[5:29] friends find a lot Divine love and favor
[5:32] with God
[5:33] then God if he finds favor with you will
[5:36] give his gifts into you but first find
[5:39] The Giver
[5:40] seek The Giver then the gifts will come
[5:44] as God sees fit to give it to you do you
[5:47] believe that
[5:48] we believe in the gifts we understand in
[5:52] the scripture that we're told even to
[5:54] covet them and and earnestly desire them
[5:58] absolutely but we don't put that as our
[6:01] God we put the giver as our God and we
[6:05] seek Him First and eternal life
[6:09] is not necessarily spiritual gifts
[6:11] having spiritual gifts
[6:13] eternal life is knowing him you see what
[6:16] what Pentecost did where they went wrong
[6:19] is they got that out of order
[6:21] and brother Branham continually rebuked
[6:23] them for that you're seeking the gifts
[6:25] instead of seeking The Giver
[6:28] and there's there's a danger in in
[6:29] getting out of balance because Paul says
[6:32] we are to seek after the gifts right but
[6:35] not in lieu
[6:37] of the the most important thing
[6:39] right that's knowing him
[6:41] knowing him is eternal life
[6:45] Matthew 7 tells us you can have gifts
[6:48] and still be lost and go to hell
[6:51] you can be Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[6:54] on your flesh and your human spirit and
[6:58] do and prophesy cast out devils and heal
[7:01] the sick
[7:02] and he he'll come and say depart from me
[7:05] you workers of iniquity I never knew you
[7:09] but at the same time these signs shall
[7:12] follow them that believe
[7:14] so so again we get it in the right place
[7:16] knowing him is eternal life not having
[7:19] his gifts not having his power not
[7:22] having access to those things is eternal
[7:25] life knowing him then when you know him
[7:29] and you're you how do you know him
[7:34] theology
[7:36] human knowledge opening opening your
[7:39] Bible and just
[7:41] learning what comes from the Bible
[7:42] that's fantastic that should be our that
[7:45] should be a life Pursuit learning what's
[7:47] in this Bible God gave it to us not so
[7:49] it would sit on the shelf and we would
[7:51] say by osmosis pass this over to me it's
[7:54] to be opened it's to be read it's to be
[7:57] fed upon it's to be lived by every word
[8:01] but just having a basic human knowledge
[8:05] of what this says is not eternal life
[8:09] knowing him is eternal life
[8:14] knowing him personally
[8:16] in the sermon Moses in 1950 brother
[8:19] Brandon says when I made that remark a
[8:21] while ago about education I wasn't
[8:23] trying to make take crutches for my
[8:25] ignorance
[8:26] what I'm trying to say is that it
[8:28] doesn't take education to know God
[8:31] it takes a submissive heart to know God
[8:36] that's key A person can have education
[8:39] and be hard
[8:41] and proud and they can have a doctor of
[8:44] divinity degree and they could argue you
[8:47] up and down from scripture
[8:50] but that that's not eternal life
[8:53] that's not knowing him that's knowing
[8:55] facts uh let's just be flat a person can
[9:01] preach this message for 30 years
[9:06] okay let's be let's be real a person can
[9:08] preach this message for 30 plus years
[9:10] they can grow up in it from the very
[9:13] beginning of it and come to a place
[9:15] where
[9:17] their life shows they never knew the
[9:20] Lord Jesus
[9:22] so don't think just because you can
[9:25] quote the message and you can quote
[9:27] scripture and you can you know this
[9:29] about it and you can spend hours giving
[9:32] a testimony that you don't that that
[9:34] that that's enough
[9:37] that's not enough you have to know him
[9:39] you have to meet him personally and and
[9:43] that's he when you meet him personally
[9:46] that brings a transformation that brings
[9:49] life and again this is on on a human
[9:53] level you can be a great kid you can
[9:56] grow up in a message church you can do
[9:58] the right things and make the right
[10:00] choices
[10:02] but God has to come to you
[10:05] it's not about you coming to God
[10:09] once you once he comes to you once he
[10:12] calls you and changes you then we're
[10:15] told come to him
[10:16] but the reality is you can you'll never
[10:19] no man that's John 6 44. no man can come
[10:25] to me except the Father which has sent
[10:28] me draw him and I will raise him up at
[10:31] the last day
[10:34] First Corinthians 12 3
[10:38] says wherefore I give you to understand
[10:40] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[10:42] God calls Jesus accursed
[10:45] and that no man can say that Jesus is
[10:48] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost
[10:53] Matthew Matthew 7.
[11:00] verse 21 I'm sorry
[11:02] read my mind brother Caleb
[11:06] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[11:08] Lord
[11:10] oh
[11:11] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[11:13] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[11:16] which is in heaven
[11:19] so here in one place he says no one can
[11:22] say Jesus is Lord
[11:24] but by the Holy Ghost here he says
[11:26] people are saying Jesus is Lord
[11:29] and they're lost
[11:33] so how do we how do we how do we see
[11:36] this how do we understand this
[11:39] we're talk we're talking about genuine
[11:42] salvation
[11:43] a person a person can come and mimic
[11:47] what's happening what's going on they
[11:49] can say Jesus is Lord they said Jesus is
[11:53] Lord verse 22 many will say to me in
[11:55] that day many he didn't just say a few
[11:57] he said this this is going to be uh this
[12:01] is going to be a pandemic this is going
[12:03] to be an epidemic this is going to be a
[12:06] large amount of people many will say to
[12:08] me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[12:11] prophesied in thy name
[12:13] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[12:16] in thy name done many wonderful works
[12:19] and then will I profess unto them I
[12:21] never knew you depart from me ye that
[12:25] work iniquity these guys were preachers
[12:27] they had prayer lines
[12:30] they had Deliverance services
[12:33] they were anointed man they were they
[12:36] were on fire
[12:37] and yet here Jesus says you never knew
[12:40] me
[12:41] you knew facts about me
[12:43] you knew the fact that I was they even
[12:46] knew that he's a miracle working God
[12:49] that isn't enough
[12:51] what does Jesus put the emphasis on in
[12:53] verse 20. go back to verse 21 what is
[12:55] his emphasis
[12:57] he that doeth the will of my father
[13:00] what's the will of the Father which is
[13:02] in heaven the word
[13:05] you say well wait a minute they were
[13:06] doing the word because it says
[13:09] to do Miracles and cast out Devils
[13:11] that's not the only word
[13:14] it's following the word that's been
[13:17] Vindicated today and what did Brother
[13:19] Branham say a submissive heart to know
[13:22] God this wasn't a submissive heart this
[13:25] was a proud heart they didn't point to
[13:28] Calvary
[13:30] right did they point to Calvary
[13:32] they pointed to their own works as
[13:36] justification for their salvation
[13:38] they're dead
[13:41] you don't point to your own Works a real
[13:43] believer never points to themself how
[13:46] could I point to my own works as brother
[13:48] Joe said go and wipe that toilet and say
[13:51] Here's here's my good works Lord It's a
[13:54] filthy rag
[13:56] nothing what was the prophets nothing in
[13:59] my arm continuously said nothing in my
[14:02] arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling
[14:06] it's through the blood of Christ
[14:08] that we're saved and we know from the
[14:11] beginning we could we we could not even
[14:13] come to him unless he were drawing me
[14:18] acts 16 verse 14.
[14:20] says a certain woman named Lydia seller
[14:23] of purple of the city of thyatira which
[14:24] worshiped God heard us they heard the
[14:27] word preached
[14:29] okay that's good that's a great start
[14:30] that's not enough though
[14:33] whose heart the Lord opened there is
[14:36] what has to happen
[14:38] Lydia didn't open her own heart
[14:41] Lydia didn't hear and say oh I believe
[14:43] that
[14:44] she did do that
[14:46] but that's not the what really happened
[14:48] what really happened was God came to
[14:51] Lydia and called her
[14:54] he opened her heart
[14:56] so that she attended unto the things
[14:59] that were spoken of Paul she heard the
[15:03] word and she didn't just hear it she
[15:06] attended to it
[15:07] she obeyed it she heard the word and
[15:10] acted in obedience to that word
[15:14] Ephesians 2 verse 8 and 9.
[15:22] for by grace are you saved
[15:26] simple verse that every one of us should
[15:28] have memorized from from when we're six
[15:31] years old
[15:33] for by grace are you saved through faith
[15:37] that's magnificent but Paul doesn't stop
[15:39] there and he says that
[15:41] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[15:46] the faith that you're saved by is not
[15:49] your own human Faith it's not what you
[15:52] could believe
[15:54] many will say to him out of their own
[15:56] human faith
[15:58] out of their own human confession Lord
[16:00] Lord look what we did
[16:03] look how we prophesied
[16:05] not not by this one this one
[16:08] their faith is a gift from God
[16:12] not of Works lest any man should boast
[16:16] you can't boast to say I I have great
[16:19] faith I just believe I just believe I am
[16:21] such a great believer no you're not
[16:25] God changed changed your heart God came
[16:28] to you God opened your heart
[16:31] to receive the word salvation is of the
[16:34] Lord salvation is not from you if it was
[16:37] your faith
[16:38] you saved yourself
[16:41] ultimately when it comes down to it it
[16:43] wasn't the cross it wasn't Christ it
[16:45] wasn't any of that it was you by your
[16:48] own belief
[16:50] that saved yourself boy that's fickle
[16:52] I'm so glad I'm not saved by my own
[16:56] faith I'm so thankful that it was that
[16:59] he came to me
[17:02] he put a faith in my heart why because
[17:05] my my reaction is in Romans 3 my
[17:09] response to the word was what growing up
[17:12] yeah I'll get to that later
[17:14] yeah I'll get to that later
[17:16] I grew up hearing the Bible
[17:21] I grew up with a mom reading me the
[17:23] Bible what did I say I believe that
[17:29] I believe that I went to do what smoke
[17:31] the weed smoke some weed
[17:33] while I believed it
[17:35] somebody came to me spoke about
[17:37] predestination do you believe that yet
[17:38] next day I went and smoked marijuana
[17:40] went to a party and and got drunk
[17:44] believing
[17:45] with your own human faith is not going
[17:48] to do it it's not accomplish anything
[17:50] God has to come to you this is a
[17:54] okay I hate this statement really
[17:56] because it's so trite a God thing if
[17:59] your life can be explained by your own
[18:01] human effort and what you do as a as a
[18:04] as a good kid
[18:06] a good message kid there's a huge
[18:09] problem
[18:10] God has to he has to call you
[18:14] he has to draw you he has to open your
[18:17] heart he has to give you the Holy Ghost
[18:19] and then it's his work that he's doing
[18:23] all along
[18:25] and you you might say with the Apostle
[18:27] Paul I labored harder than anybody else
[18:30] but then you'll come behind that with
[18:32] the Apostle Paul and say it wasn't me it
[18:34] was the grace of God in Me
[18:36] if if your life can be explained by your
[18:39] own human effort you haven't got the
[18:42] Life of Christ yet
[18:45] it's great to be a good person we love
[18:47] good people we're thankful for good
[18:49] people and surely even if you just sat
[18:52] here and listened to the message on a
[18:54] human level it would make you a better
[18:57] person but that's not what we're talking
[18:59] about we're talking about salvation
[19:02] salvation is of the Lord and God's focus
[19:05] is you knowing him
[19:08] why did he come down in the form of a
[19:11] pillar of fire and manifest himself and
[19:14] tell the secrets of the heart and show
[19:16] his love and care for every detail
[19:20] through through that Prophet why did he
[19:22] do that because he wants you to know him
[19:25] he wants you to know his
[19:28] eternal love he wants you to know his
[19:30] care for everything about you he wants
[19:33] you to know that his hand is in every
[19:35] area of your area of your life no matter
[19:38] how hard it is no matter how much trials
[19:40] you're going through that he is with you
[19:44] what does David say in some I love Psalm
[19:47] 139 this is not in my notes but we're
[19:49] going to go to Psalm 139
[19:52] and I'm gonna cry for a while
[19:56] because I don't remember ever reading
[19:58] Psalm 139 without crying
[20:02] This Is The Life
[20:05] of a predestinated belief verse one you
[20:07] could pull up
[20:08] this is the life of an elected believer
[20:10] Who's Got Hand God's hand is on them you
[20:16] might run
[20:18] you might try to hide
[20:20] you might get in a dark place a terrible
[20:23] place
[20:24] but guess what no matter how deep and
[20:28] dark and terrible it is
[20:30] God is right there with you
[20:34] and he knows every detail of your heart
[20:37] you're not hiding anything from him you
[20:39] might hide it from your parents might
[20:40] hide it from your spouse you might hide
[20:42] it from the people at church but you're
[20:44] not hiding nothing from God
[20:46] and he still loves you
[20:49] and he loves you so much that he's not
[20:51] going to leave you in that condition
[20:52] he's going to Humble you
[20:54] the the whole world Will Go On
[20:58] and they'll preach and they'll do
[20:59] they'll do all these different things
[21:01] and what do they do they continue in
[21:04] Pride why because God's this they don't
[21:08] have Psalm 139 as a reality in their
[21:12] life their faith is a human faith
[21:14] and they might be anointed to do Mighty
[21:16] things but if you're a child of God God
[21:19] will humble you
[21:21] God Will Take Care
[21:23] to send you many difficulties and trials
[21:27] to make you more like him
[21:30] because that's that's what he's trying
[21:32] to see he wants you to know him
[21:34] know his love no know everything about
[21:37] him
[21:38] know his power
[21:40] know his his
[21:43] healing every attribute he wants to
[21:46] reveal to you
[21:48] most of those attributes come by
[21:51] Revelation through a life of Trials and
[21:55] suffering
[21:57] oh Lord
[21:59] you have searched me and known me
[22:02] you know my down sitting and my uprising
[22:07] you understand my thought far off
[22:12] isn't that incredible
[22:15] think about that
[22:17] God understands you
[22:21] it's not that he just knows the fact of
[22:24] your thought
[22:25] s
[22:26] he knows it certainly he knows
[22:29] everyone's thought
[22:30] before the foundation of the world
[22:32] before you think it it's not that it's
[22:34] that he understands you he understands
[22:36] what you're going through he understands
[22:38] the pain you have
[22:40] and he's there
[22:44] thou compasses meet my path in other
[22:47] words he surrounds
[22:49] surrounds you your path is surrounded
[22:54] and my lying down and you're acquainted
[22:56] with all my ways
[23:00] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[23:02] low Lord thou knowest it all together
[23:05] thouest beset me
[23:07] behind and before and laid thine hand
[23:11] upon me
[23:14] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[23:16] it is high I cannot attain to it
[23:21] go back to that scripture that that's
[23:25] such a statement to me
[23:28] because you could say you could say like
[23:31] a theologian
[23:32] well he's just speaking of the
[23:34] omnipotence omnipresence and omniscience
[23:37] of God we all know that
[23:40] we do
[23:41] but that's not just what he's talking
[23:42] about this is a man who lived a life
[23:47] this is a Psalm of David
[23:49] who who experienced this this is an
[23:52] experience that we're talking about
[23:54] right here that David had was I tried to
[23:56] run from him and he was the path that I
[23:59] was on he was in the front and he was in
[24:01] the back and he was all everywhere
[24:03] around me and no matter where where I
[24:06] went he was there
[24:07] why because he's got a plan and a
[24:10] purpose he's doing something and he
[24:13] wants you to he wants you to know him
[24:14] and he wants other people to know him
[24:17] through your lived life
[24:21] and such knowledge is
[24:24] to it it will make your brain explode
[24:27] and and
[24:29] it should be making us shout and dance
[24:32] because what an incredible thing
[24:36] it's high
[24:37] I cannot we can't have a full
[24:40] comprehension of all that God knows
[24:42] about us
[24:43] how much he loves us how much he cares
[24:46] for us remember nothing
[24:48] can separate us from the love of God in
[24:52] Christ Jesus our lord nothing you do
[24:55] nothing you think
[24:57] nothing no devil
[25:00] no experience in life
[25:02] no no no government
[25:05] absolutely nothing
[25:07] not nakedness not famine not Peril no
[25:12] trial that could come your way will
[25:14] separate you from the love of God in
[25:17] Christ Jesus our lord nothing
[25:21] because before the world was ever
[25:24] created
[25:25] you were already
[25:27] a part of his life you were his seed
[25:30] Gene and that love is eternal
[25:33] and that thought that he had of you is
[25:36] eternal and he's gonna he is he is so
[25:39] zealous he's so much more zealous
[25:41] than we are he is zealous to accomplish
[25:44] what he wants to accomplish in your life
[25:47] and in my life and nothing will stop him
[25:52] verse 7 wither shall I go from thy
[25:54] Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy
[25:56] presence the answer is nowhere

[26:00] elect of God and he's called you and
[26:03] he's filled you with his Spirit you're
[26:05] not going anywhere
[26:06] you might want to go somewhere God is
[26:09] going to be there
[26:13] if I Ascend up into heaven you're there
[26:16] if my if I make my bed in hell behold
[26:20] Thou Art there
[26:22] if I take the wings of the morning and
[26:24] dwell in the uttermost part of the sea
[26:25] even there shall thy hand Lead Me in thy
[26:28] right hand shall hold me
[26:30] if I say surely the darkness shall cover
[26:34] me even the night shall be as light unto
[26:37] you
[26:38] be light about me yea the darkness hides
[26:42] not from thee but the night shines as
[26:44] the day the darkness and the light are
[26:46] both alike to thee for thou has
[26:48] possessed my Reigns thou has covered me
[26:51] in my mother's womb I will praise thee
[26:54] for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[26:57] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[27:00] knoweth right well my substance was not
[27:04] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[27:06] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[27:09] parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my
[27:12] substance yet being imperfect or not
[27:14] fully formed and in thy book all my
[27:16] members were written which in
[27:18] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[27:21] there were none of them how precious
[27:23] also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how
[27:26] great
[27:26] is the sum of them if I should count
[27:29] them they are more in number than the
[27:31] sand when I awake I am still with thee
[27:34] surely
[27:35] thou will slay the wicked Old Guard
[27:37] depart from me

[28:40] surrender if you it takes a submissive
[28:43] heart to know God if you have if God has
[28:47] given you that submissive heart because
