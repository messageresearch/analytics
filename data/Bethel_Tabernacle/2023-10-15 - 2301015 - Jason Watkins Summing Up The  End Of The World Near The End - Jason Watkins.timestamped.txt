[27:26] hardly any sleep
[27:28] all and I had come up here and got
[27:30] prayed for last Sunday
[27:33] and I felt the Lord when I went back to
[27:36] my seat I felt a presence come near me
[27:38] and it's like it
[27:40] went and I knew at that moment I was
[27:43] like I'm going to sleep
[27:45] tonight well I went home went to bed
[27:48] that
[27:49] night I couldn't sleep tossed and turned
[27:52] all night long could not sleep and I was
[27:54] like Lord I know I felt your presence
[27:56] what what is going on here
[27:58] and next morning I was so tired I had to
[28:00] get up for work and I was literally
[28:01] crying I looked at my husband and I said
[28:03] I can't keep going like this I said I've
[28:05] got to have some sleep so I text a group
[28:08] of people and I said you've got to pray
[28:11] for me because if I can't get sleep I
[28:13] can't go to Camp I said I'm so tired I
[28:16] said I can't even think straight half
[28:17] the
[28:18] time well they started praying and that
[28:21] night I went to bed and I slept so good
[28:25] and the next night I went to bed and I

[28:38] sounds foolish to some people but if

[31:04] between two

[44:35] and hearer of your word father I commit
[44:38] myself into your hands in Jesus name
[44:41] amen God bless you friends let's turn to
[44:44] Matthew chapter
[44:54] 22
[45:05] praise the
[45:06] Lord I'm really excited for Camp coming
[45:10] up and uh I just know I believe the Lord
[45:12] is going to do great things for us amen
[45:16] Matthew 22 and we're going to catch 34
[45:19] through
[45:20] 40 and then I've got another scripture
[45:23] we'll go to but I'm going to let you be
[45:25] seated after after we read this
[45:28] amen but when the Pharisees heard had
[45:32] heard that Jesus had put the Sadducees
[45:35] to silence they were gathered together
[45:39] then one of them which was a lawyer and
[45:42] this is a a a student of the law it's
[45:45] not like an attorney like we would have
[45:47] today it's a student of the law then
[45:50] when one of them which was a lawyer an
[45:52] expert in the law asked him a question
[45:55] tempting him and saying Master which is
[45:58] the great commandment in the
[46:01] law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[46:05] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[46:09] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[46:13] this is the first and great commandment
[46:16] and the second is like unto it Thou
[46:20] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on
[46:24] these two Commandments
[46:26] hang all the law and the prophets may
[46:30] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[46:32] you can be seated keep your Bibles handy
[46:35] we'll go um to John 16
[46:41] momentarily amen and I just covet your
[46:53] undivided waiting for the otion
[46:57] St we get a legitimate exitus from the
[47:01] platform but we get a unfavorable Exodus
[47:05] from the building uh right as I seat the
[47:09] people and I'd sure like to see that
[47:11] stop amen I know it can be done I raised
[47:14] my children that way they went to the
[47:17] restroom when they arrived at church and
[47:20] they didn't go again and didn't need to
[47:22] go again until the service was concluded
[47:25] and if they had an emergent emergency I
[47:28] would always let them go but it wasn't
[47:31] you know this idea of just an automatic
[47:34] thing so I'd like to see that stop like
[47:37] to see parents bring that under a
[47:40] tighter regulation and goodness sake
[47:43] let's not have parents doing it
[47:45] amen all
[47:47] right I ask your prayer for me this
[47:49] morning I've got a rather unusual
[47:52] approach to this sermon today and I I
[47:55] I'm I'm I'm trying to just be very
[47:58] studious and I really covet your
[48:01] undivided attention um we're going to go
[48:05] into some areas today and I just want to
[48:07] be very careful how I cover it don't
[48:09] want to give the wrong impression what
[48:11] I'm the impression I'm trying to avoid
[48:14] is that I'm up here preaching Christian
[48:16] psychology I want to avoid you thinking
[48:18] that all right because I don't that's
[48:21] not what I'm going to be doing today but
[48:23] I am going to be doing some compar
[48:25] compon between Christian psychology and
[48:28] real faith brother brandham did that
[48:31] just in case you don't know in wisdom
[48:33] versus Faith all right amen so I'm I'm
[48:37] right in the line in order of the
[48:39] Prophet okay all right so according to
[48:45] Jesus here he is saying that the first
[48:49] great commandment is to love the Lord
[48:52] with all your heart and with all your
[48:55] soul and with all your mind now then he
[48:59] comes to a second one and I want to
[49:01] propose to you today that the second
[49:05] commandment you'll notice that Jesus
[49:07] says it's like unto so in other words
[49:10] it's related to the first so I want you
[49:14] now if you can grasp that I want you to
[49:17] go one more step and realize that it's
[49:19] really a continuation of the first it's
[49:23] an outcropping of the first it's it's a
[49:26] harvest of the first it's a result of
[49:29] the first it's a continuation of the
[49:32] first all right so it's not like a
[49:35] second separate rule that you say well I
[49:39] can get one but I don't know about that
[49:41] second one if you don't have the second
[49:44] one you don't have the first
[49:47] one amen is that easy if you don't have
[49:50] the second one you don't have the first
[49:53] one and so Jesus ties the these two
[49:56] together and he doesn't even go into
[49:59] lying and murder and adultery and
[50:01] idolatry and all these different things
[50:03] he doesn't even visit the Ten
[50:05] Commandments other than right here and
[50:07] he says on this one thing and its
[50:11] natural continuation hang all the law
[50:15] and the prophets this is everything the
[50:19] law was designed to achieve this is
[50:22] everything the prophets taught this is
[50:25] is not only what they taught but they
[50:28] lived all
[50:30] right so according to James we're not
[50:34] going to turn to it today but in I just
[50:37] got one verse in James 2:8 which is
[50:39] familiar you'll recognize it uh James
[50:42] tells us uh you know how that how that
[50:46] there's a royal
[50:48] law um I I probably should turn you to
[50:51] it give me James 28 brother Mark I'm
[50:53] sorry to jump you uh by surprise but
[50:55] let's let's have that just so I can fit
[50:57] that in
[50:59] amen let me make one quick adjustment
[51:17] here
[51:19] perfect
[51:21] okay so so sometimes people laugh at me
[51:25] because I'm the guy who has backups to
[51:28] my backups of my
[51:31] backups and so
[51:33] today technology was weird weird and so
[51:37] me being me I made a backup in a
[51:40] different place and since my first one
[51:43] isn't working now I'm on my
[51:45] backup so you know the Jesus
[51:51] saves brother Jason saves I back up amen
[51:57] James 2:8 if you
[51:59] fulfill the Royal law according to the
[52:03] scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[52:05] as thyself you do well so so we realize
[52:09] that James here is is calling Jesus
[52:14] second addition or Jesus's addendum or
[52:18] his Adon to the first commandment upon
[52:22] which all the law and Prophets hang and
[52:24] James is now going to label that that's
[52:27] the Royal law so because of this being
[52:32] true it's the Royal law of God's Kingdom
[52:36] so then we would call it then and I
[52:38] would be able to say today it's a royal
[52:41] man it's a
[52:43] manifestation of the royal
[52:45] family am I connecting the dots I'm not
[52:48] going too fast am I all right so we've
[52:50] come from the one law upon which all the
[52:54] prophets and and and all the law and
[52:57] everything was founded upon and that is
[53:01] there's nothing more important or even
[53:03] to be mentioned other than this this is
[53:06] the cure all that will cure all and
[53:10] deliver all and make the royal family
[53:13] live like the royal family is if you
[53:15] love the Lord God with all your heart
[53:19] and all your mind and all your soul amen
[53:23] all right all right so it so it becomes
[53:26] a royal manifestation it is not
[53:29] sufficient Jesus talks about this that
[53:33] there are people in his day and there
[53:36] are people in our day who honor God with
[53:39] their
[53:42] lips but their heart is far from him and
[53:46] that is a a problem that would only be
[53:50] exacerbated with the burgeoning of
[53:52] humanity across the world for the last
[53:55] 2,000 years and we go from so many
[53:57] millions and then a billion and then two
[53:59] and then three and four and five six
[54:00] seven and approaching 8 billion so that
[54:03] that issue would only increase and in
[54:06] fact is Paul told us that it would be
[54:11] not just acute at the last day but it
[54:14] would be and the reason it would be so
[54:18] so perilous is because it would be
[54:21] personified in the masses of humanity
[54:24] that they would have a form of
[54:27] godliness but they would deny the power
[54:30] amen that that that that they would have
[54:33] a form of godliness but they would and
[54:36] brother brandham said that means they
[54:38] deny the real
[54:39] realities They Don't Really allow Christ
[54:42] to come in and change their life amen
[54:46] amen you know it's it's it's it's just
[54:49] ironic and so so now that if you really
[54:53] do love love the Lord thy God with all
[54:57] your heart and with all your soul and
[55:00] with all your mind then then you are you
[55:06] are you are at the beginning properly
[55:10] you have started the race that Paul
[55:13] spoke of and now you can accomplish
[55:16] great things for God's kingdom because
[55:19] you'll manifest th that fact that your
[55:22] heart not just your lips but your heart
[55:24] loves God
[55:26] and you've dedicated your whole soul and
[55:28] your whole mind which means you've made
[55:30] him the center of everything you
[55:33] do he's not a
[55:35] sidebar I I can tell who makes God a who
[55:38] makes Christ a sidebar by their Church
[55:42] attendance their Christianity is a
[55:44] Christianity of convenience and if it
[55:46] can work out and everything can be
[55:48] convenient then I'll I'll I'll I'll act
[55:50] and do and you'll think I'm a Christian
[55:52] but if it if it cramps my style
[55:55] hinders my schedule or keeps me from
[55:58] chasing my own personal dreams and my
[56:00] own agenda then you know I I'm not going
[56:03] to appear as
[56:05] fervent and the amazing thing is God
[56:08] just lets you do that see Israel I'm
[56:11] going to tell you what happens Israel
[56:15] asked for those Quail they were tired of
[56:19] the bread and they and the Bible says
[56:22] God granted it to them but added
[56:25] leanness to their
[56:27] soul so Chase your own dreams at your
[56:30] own Peril I'm not saying you're not a
[56:33] child of God I'm saying he's not the
[56:35] center of your
[56:37] life you're not you're you're and
[56:40] therefore your manifestation shows he's
[56:43] not the center of your life now am I am
[56:47] I condemning you well I the Holy Ghost
[56:50] doesn't condemn so much as he convicts
[56:54] and I hope that if if if that's you
[56:55] today maybe you're streaming and maybe
[56:58] there'll be a little tinge of conviction
[57:00] and you'll say to yourself if you don't
[57:02] say anything else you might not even say
[57:04] it out loud but you just say I'm G to
[57:06] change that amen how many have had that
[57:09] happen I've had things where I just
[57:12] observed wrong Within Myself and I just
[57:14] said to myself that's not going to be a
[57:16] part of me and I'm going to change that
[57:19] and I and the only way I can is more
[57:21] surrender because the Lord will change
[57:23] that for me see so I don't want to make
[57:26] you mad and you cut me off right at the
[57:27] beginning so just stay right with me
[57:30] please I'm trying to help us
[57:33] today so it's a the Royal law produces a
[57:37] manifestation that identifies the royal
[57:39] family remember it's all about
[57:42] identification so therefore the first
[57:44] great commandment is to love him with
[57:46] all your heart and soul and mind and the
[57:48] second is akin to it to love your
[57:50] neighbor as yourself and the second law
[57:52] is called the Royal manifestation it my
[57:55] own in my own way of saying it so it
[57:58] it's something that will be evident uh
[58:00] in the lives of those who are part of
[58:03] the royal family those who truly love
[58:06] God with all their mind soul and their
[58:08] heart and and they hold him as first in
[58:10] their lives all right now we're going to
[58:12] go brother Mark to John
[58:15] 16 now Jesus knew verse 19 I'm sorry
[58:18] John 16:1 19-2 24 now Jesus knew that
[58:22] they were desirous to ask him and said
[58:25] unto them do you inquire among
[58:27] yourselves of that I said a little while
[58:30] and you shall not see me again a little
[58:32] while and you shall see me verily verily
[58:34] I say unto you that you shall weep and
[58:37] lament but the world shall rejoice and
[58:40] ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow
[58:42] shall be turned into Joy you're seeing
[58:45] that on the world scene today you're
[58:47] seeing the ungodly rejoice and you're
[58:50] seeing The Godly in sorrow see and and
[58:54] you're you're you're finding he says but
[58:57] don't worry your sorrow shall be turned
[58:58] into Joy a woman he's going to give an
[59:01] analogy that every woman who's had a
[59:03] child can relate to a woman when she is
[59:06] in travail hath sorrow that's no joke
[59:09] that's for real because her hour is come
[59:12] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[59:14] child I watched this happen to my wife
[59:16] three times it was like magic I couldn't
[59:19] believe it and and I was thinking about
[59:22] this scripture that that but as soon as
[59:24] she is delivered of the child she
[59:26] remember no more the anguish for joy
[59:28] that a man is Born Into the world and I
[59:31] literally watched her go from pain and
[59:33] suffering and crying and Agony and as
[59:36] soon as the child was delivered and
[59:38] handed to her joy and smiles and and and
[59:41] immediately the tears you know are
[59:44] because her nerves are still and the
[59:45] tears are still coming but she's happy
[59:48] see and so and you now therefore have
[59:51] sorrow but I will see you again
[59:55] and your heart shall rejoice and your
[59:58] joy no man taketh from you and in that
[1:00:02] day you shall ask me nothing verily
[1:00:04] verily I say unto you whatsoever you
[1:00:05] shall ask the father in my name he will
[1:00:07] give it you hitherto you have asked
[1:00:10] nothing in my name ask and you shall
[1:00:14] receive catch this line that your joy
[1:00:18] may be full
[1:00:20] amen I could have very easily uh titled
[1:00:24] this sermon uh today uh on the fullness
[1:00:28] of
[1:00:29] joy however uh I I that's kind of what I
[1:00:32] want to bring it down to today so we
[1:00:35] find that people you know searching for
[1:00:38] meaning people do that it's a natural
[1:00:41] human tendency to search for meaning for
[1:00:45] purpose for happiness and for
[1:00:48] contentment I think about some uh some
[1:00:51] very fin looking young people they were
[1:00:54] more Mormon by faith and they were being
[1:00:57] interviewed by a Christian evangelist on
[1:00:59] the
[1:01:00] street and he was um he was just asking
[1:01:04] them about eternal life and you know you
[1:01:06] may have you may have seen I subscribed
[1:01:08] to his channel he's got very good ways
[1:01:10] of approaching people one onone and he
[1:01:13] says I you know imagine I've got a knife
[1:01:15] in my back I've got three minutes to
[1:01:16] live what can you tell me I don't want
[1:01:18] to go to hell I'd like to go to heaven
[1:01:19] what can you tell me and they said well
[1:01:22] you know that depends he goes I got two
[1:01:24] and half minutes left what can you tell
[1:01:26] me Well we don't really believe in a
[1:01:27] hell oh my goodness I'm down to two
[1:01:29] minutes how do I get in heaven okay you
[1:01:31] don't believe in a Hell how do I get in
[1:01:32] heaven well you know there's going to be
[1:01:34] works but I thought Jesus said I
[1:01:36] couldn't get there by my works I'm down
[1:01:38] to a minute and a half help me please
[1:01:39] don't let me
[1:01:40] die and they're all you know they're
[1:01:43] they're taken back by this sudden uh
[1:01:46] approach and and you know it was sad
[1:01:49] because I found out you know as as they
[1:01:52] were testifying that they first first of
[1:01:54] all they don't really believe that
[1:01:55] anyone goes to
[1:01:57] hell which is contrary to the
[1:02:00] Bible and the and we find that they
[1:02:03] pretty much think feel that everybody
[1:02:05] goes to some level of Heaven and the
[1:02:08] level of Heaven you get to go to it will
[1:02:12] depend on the works that you do and so
[1:02:15] you can earn your way to a level three
[1:02:18] of version of heaven or if you really go
[1:02:21] all out you get a version a level six
[1:02:23] and you might get I don't know how many
[1:02:24] many levels they even have but the upper
[1:02:27] echelon level put puts you up there and
[1:02:29] you become like God himself you become a
[1:02:32] God and then you go off and you know and
[1:02:36] and Pioneer your own creation and world
[1:02:39] and the cycle just goes on and goes on
[1:02:41] and goes on and goes
[1:02:43] on and I thought about that and I'm not
[1:02:45] here today to take such exception to
[1:02:49] that you know um I I I
[1:02:53] saw I I'm I'm speaking about the
[1:02:57] sadness that I
[1:02:59] felt in in thinking about these poor
[1:03:02] people What a Sad Awakening they're
[1:03:06] going to have on that
[1:03:08] day I I saw a documentary was actually a
[1:03:11] very moving documentary I would even
[1:03:14] recommend it um possibly I would but it
[1:03:19] was uh by a Grammy awardwinning artist
[1:03:23] I'll Reserve his name for now but he's W
[1:03:28] 19 Grammys he's the most decorated has
[1:03:30] the most sold the most gospel music of
[1:03:33] any gospel singer and artist in
[1:03:36] history and you know and and there he
[1:03:39] was talking about the the childhood the
[1:03:42] painful childhood is very heart-rending
[1:03:44] and it had somewhat of a happy ending
[1:03:46] but filled with sadness also and it and
[1:03:49] you know and and and there was some
[1:03:51] Redemption that went on between him and
[1:03:53] his father and then him to his son you
[1:03:55] know broken people end up producing
[1:03:58] broken people and and he was dealing
[1:04:01] with this and coming to terms with and
[1:04:03] he'd been you know had quite a um um
[1:04:07] absent a daddy and absent really a
[1:04:09] mother and was adopted and and and
[1:04:12] really it was heartbreaking it was
[1:04:13] really heartbreaking but what was more
[1:04:15] heartbreaking is that as he talked about
[1:04:18] his Christianity and he talked about
[1:04:21] Christ in such glowing words like you
[1:04:23] and I Mike would talk about the Lord and
[1:04:26] then he goes into his anguish and he's
[1:04:29] he and then the anger comes up and he
[1:04:31] says I've spent my whole life you know
[1:04:34] trying to figure out who and he he
[1:04:38] literally utters a Common Street
[1:04:42] vulgarity who the blank I am and he
[1:04:45] stops with forming the first
[1:04:48] letters and his wife just don't say that
[1:04:51] you're on camera and you realize my
[1:04:53] goodness
[1:04:54] that what I'm seeing is not even the
[1:04:56] real
[1:04:57] himym and and then and then a little
[1:05:00] while later he's actually they let they
[1:05:03] put it on the documentary and he says I
[1:05:05] can't I can't see how in the hll people
[1:05:08] can think I'm thinking I thought you
[1:05:09] were a
[1:05:11] Christian now I'm not here to even
[1:05:15] condemn that
[1:05:17] artist uh you know
[1:05:20] something because brother brandham talks
[1:05:22] about misinterpreted the
[1:05:24] ology and he says you know women say
[1:05:28] they read the scripture about cutting
[1:05:30] hair and say well my pastor said that
[1:05:33] that I don't have to follow that and
[1:05:35] brother brandham said he'll suffer for
[1:05:37] it in the regions Beyond so I can see
[1:05:40] why they HED desperately William Brandon
[1:05:42] was a false prophet because if he wasn't
[1:05:44] they're
[1:05:45] doomed and and and I'm not even really
[1:05:48] trying to come down and I I felt sorry
[1:05:52] for this musical artist artist uh and
[1:05:56] and I I felt sorry you know me I I
[1:05:59] thought to myself it was ironic because
[1:06:02] when you think about brother brand
[1:06:03] because what they've saw is such a
[1:06:06] misrepresentation yes they've not just
[1:06:10] heard misinterpreted
[1:06:12] theology they've not only maybe not
[1:06:16] heard the message of there like brother
[1:06:18] brandham said concerning Jackie Kennedy
[1:06:20] he said but you know maybe she never
[1:06:22] heard one of my messages
[1:06:25] maybe if she would have things could be
[1:06:28] different I that that made me glow
[1:06:31] inside I thought what a wonderful thing
[1:06:33] for brother brandham to
[1:06:34] say and you know because there you don't
[1:06:38] ever want to take hope
[1:06:40] away and I always say as long as Jesus
[1:06:43] is on the throne there's always hope
[1:06:45] you're never hopeless as long as he
[1:06:49] reigns so I and I'm trying to get to my
[1:06:53] real EXP expression of my heart today so
[1:06:56] it's it's not that you know I'm that
[1:06:59] they just haven't maybe picked up a book
[1:07:01] and and read something or heard a tape
[1:07:04] or came here it's not that they just had
[1:07:06] some misinterpreted theology but they
[1:07:09] are they are living in a world where
[1:07:14] people have a form of
[1:07:17] godliness but deny the power and they
[1:07:20] Heap to themselves those preachers
[1:07:24] having itching ears that tell them what
[1:07:26] they want to hear and preach a version
[1:07:27] of The Gospel that's not their gospel
[1:07:31] but it's a version of The Gospel they
[1:07:33] want to be true and they follow it do
[1:07:36] you know something brother
[1:07:39] Brandon felt sorry for people under
[1:07:43] misinterpreted
[1:07:45] theology he did we and Brandon expressed
[1:07:49] that over and many many many times he
[1:07:51] was a Man Who Loved people and it broke
[1:07:53] his heart to see people and he would say
[1:07:55] open your eyes friends go back to the
[1:07:57] Bible and he would plead with them go
[1:07:59] back to the word so well my pastor says
[1:08:01] but what does the Bible
[1:08:03] say and then God would come on the scene
[1:08:05] in Mercy and prove what he was saying he
[1:08:07] was saying now if what I've said is the
[1:08:10] truth and what he had said was use your
[1:08:12] Bible don't believe somebody preaching
[1:08:15] something outside of the
[1:08:17] Bible and and it broke his heart that
[1:08:20] people would still make that choice and
[1:08:23] even you know the the sister um glattus
[1:08:26] or not or U I forget her name I think it
[1:08:29] was Sister glattus who was there in
[1:08:34] Louisiana when brother brandom is
[1:08:36] preaching choosing of a
[1:08:38] bride and I mean at the end brother
[1:08:41] brandom is just beside himself and the
[1:08:43] people are screaming and and and he's
[1:08:45] saying you know you know you know you
[1:08:47] need to repent and and and and and the
[1:08:50] end is upon us and California's going to
[1:08:52] go down and and people are screaming and
[1:08:55] I believe it was choosing of a bride
[1:08:56] there in Louisiana but it seemed like
[1:08:58] maybe he was there in California because
[1:09:00] he's saying repent Los Angeles so I
[1:09:02] might have the sermon titles inverted
[1:09:04] but it was all part of those last
[1:09:06] Closing Services of his life and she and
[1:09:11] and you can hear the audience people are
[1:09:13] wailing and screaming and brother
[1:09:15] brandham says you know I'm not like this
[1:09:17] I'm not given to this he says but I'm
[1:09:19] telling you something's about to happen
[1:09:21] and people are and you know what that
[1:09:24] and and they asked this sister I
[1:09:26] remember brother Bisal told us years ago
[1:09:27] said he I asked sister I think it was
[1:09:29] sister glattus said what was the
[1:09:31] response I can hear it on the tape but I
[1:09:33] wasn't there what was the response of
[1:09:35] the people she said half the people were
[1:09:39] on their faces on the ground screaming
[1:09:43] and crying and the other half and women
[1:09:46] with their high heeled shoes clicky
[1:09:49] clack their way out the
[1:09:52] door
[1:09:55] turned on their high heels and out they
[1:09:57] went said half the audience walked out
[1:10:00] immediately and half of them was on
[1:10:02] their faces screaming how do you get
[1:10:04] that kind of disparity I you know and
[1:10:06] brother Brandon would he felt very sorry
[1:10:09] for people who had had misinterpreted
[1:10:11] theology he expressed his regret that
[1:10:14] Jackie and and Jack Kennedy had maybe
[1:10:17] never got to hear one of his sermons but
[1:10:20] you know
[1:10:21] something that that did not
[1:10:24] occupy William bram's main feeling of
[1:10:29] Sorrow his his his primary sorrow wasn't
[1:10:34] that they hadn't heard a tape of his or
[1:10:37] that they uh that that they' had a
[1:10:39] misinterpreted theology but he said what
[1:10:43] what made him the most sorry was he felt
[1:10:46] sorry for the sinner amen who saw the
[1:10:50] hypocrisy of the Christian church and
[1:10:54] saw no difference between them and
[1:10:56] himself themselves he says that's the
[1:10:59] one I feel sorry for I feel sorry for
[1:11:02] the sinner who looks at that and doesn't
[1:11:04] know what to think doesn't know what to
[1:11:08] choose trying to find eternal life and
[1:11:11] don't even know where to start why I
[1:11:13] could go to those Christians they're no
[1:11:15] different from me I drink with those
[1:11:19] guys that's the truth I I remember I got
[1:11:22] a buddy who's uh in the message today
[1:11:25] and he was uh he was a Catholic and and
[1:11:28] he started his life started falling
[1:11:29] apart and somebody said to him well you
[1:11:31] need to go see a priest he says a priest
[1:11:34] he said I drink with those
[1:11:35] guys well why would I go see them they
[1:11:38] got the same problems I got he said I
[1:11:41] need to find somebody that that's that's
[1:11:42] different and he came across some
[1:11:44] Believers and his life was never the
[1:11:47] same see and and so a lot of times we
[1:11:50] can say you know you know oh I feel
[1:11:53] sorry for those people brother Jason you
[1:11:55] should have more Compassion maybe
[1:11:57] they've never heard the truth maybe
[1:11:59] they've never heard the message I don't
[1:12:02] deny that but could I throw in a little
[1:12:04] bit of of push back a little bit for
[1:12:06] balance sake why would God teach someone
[1:12:09] algebra if they've already refused his
[1:12:12] ABCs why would he even do that would you
[1:12:16] do that see they they he they they've
[1:12:19] already denied you know you you you
[1:12:22] don't just whatever you do don't go
[1:12:24] imputing
[1:12:26] God you cannot impune God he's always
[1:12:29] just he's always righteous he's always
[1:12:34] fair so you know this is where we have
[1:12:38] gotten to in the world and brother
[1:12:40] Brandon felt sorry for the sinner who
[1:12:43] looked at the confusion of it all and
[1:12:45] really you know didn't know what to
[1:12:50] do um brother Mark let's have my
[1:12:58] PowerPoint all right I've only got a few
[1:13:00] slides to show you and I'm not going to
[1:13:03] spend a great deal of time on this and
[1:13:05] here's the psych the Christian
[1:13:07] psychology part actually it's not even
[1:13:08] Christian psychology it's uh aristotlean
[1:13:12] psychology uh this word is has various
[1:13:16] spellings it also has various
[1:13:17] pronunciations depending on what scholar
[1:13:19] is saying it uh it's uh UD demonia or or
[1:13:24] udonia I've heard it pronounced both
[1:13:26] ways I prefer udonia that's the one I've
[1:13:28] heard most commonly and it it basically
[1:13:31] is happiness according to the Greeks all
[1:13:34] right now we
[1:13:36] read Jesus declaring to us in our
[1:13:40] scripture in John 16 that hither to you
[1:13:44] have asked me nothing in my name ask and
[1:13:46] you shall receive that your joy may be
[1:13:50] full all right now just stick with me
[1:13:52] for a minute
[1:13:55] all right so
[1:13:57] whoops
[1:13:59] so Yia is a term which comes from
[1:14:03] Aristotle's work called nicoman ethics
[1:14:06] and means individual well-being and
[1:14:10] happiness it combines the prefix EU
[1:14:13] meaning good and Damon meaning Spirit
[1:14:16] Socrates also delved into goodness and
[1:14:20] the virtues of knowledge leading us to a
[1:14:23] achieve the ultimate good all right so
[1:14:28] the word udia is an ancient Greek word
[1:14:31] that appears in many philosophical texts
[1:14:34] historically it has been translated as
[1:14:37] happiness in philosophical context
[1:14:40] though it can mean wealth Prosperity or
[1:14:44] Good Fortune however most modern
[1:14:46] historians claim that this is an
[1:14:48] inaccurate translation udonia is not an
[1:14:51] emotion it is it is more a constant
[1:14:55] state of
[1:14:56] being all right
[1:14:59] so I I just want that in your mind so
[1:15:02] this is this is wisdom versus
[1:15:05] Faith that's the pursuit of wisdom and
[1:15:08] I'm going to break it down for you a
[1:15:09] little bit further and I just ask for
[1:15:11] your patience because I really want to
[1:15:14] bring the comparison to you you stick
[1:15:17] with
[1:15:18] me so udia then is a concept from
[1:15:22] ancient Greek philosophy that refers in
[1:15:27] some cases to a state of flourishing or
[1:15:30] well-being or happiness that is achieved
[1:15:34] through living a virtuous life in the
[1:15:36] philosophy of Aristotle and and I've
[1:15:39] read many of his statements udonia was
[1:15:42] actually in his mind the ultimate goal
[1:15:45] of human existence all right so he
[1:15:48] believed that by pursuing virtue and
[1:15:52] excellence in all areas of your life a
[1:15:55] person could achieve a state of lasting
[1:15:58] happiness and fulfillment now I'm all
[1:16:00] for the pursuit of
[1:16:02] Excellence Jesus was a a man who pursued
[1:16:06] Excellence he said I do always that
[1:16:08] which pleases the father all right so
[1:16:11] it's a way of let now and this an
[1:16:13] important point so Aristotle was not
[1:16:15] just saying it's happy
[1:16:18] thoughts see and actually he believed
[1:16:22] that it was a way of life rather than
[1:16:25] just a momentary feeling of pleasure
[1:16:27] from I don't know some fortunate
[1:16:29] circumstance that you found yourself in
[1:16:31] or maybe some accomplishment that you
[1:16:34] had and you had that high of
[1:16:36] satisfaction he's saying you know you
[1:16:39] your diamond KN is more than that
[1:16:40] according to Aristotle virtue is the
[1:16:44] ability to reason properly and then act
[1:16:48] accordingly wi with that proper
[1:16:51] reasoning which then leads leads you to
[1:16:53] true happiness now this is all sensible
[1:16:56] stuff I'm not up here condemning it I'm
[1:16:58] going yeah pursuit of Excellence you
[1:17:01] know you you do good things you reap
[1:17:03] good things you have a purpose you have
[1:17:05] a drive brother Brandon had a bum come
[1:17:07] to his door that he fed him a meal and
[1:17:09] brother bram's trying to ask him a
[1:17:11] question where you from oh here and
[1:17:12] there where you going
[1:17:15] wherever well where do you live wherever
[1:17:17] I hang my hat oh come on man and brother
[1:17:20] Brandon was trying to say you know
[1:17:21] what's your purpose and the man said you
[1:17:23] know I just he didn't have one and
[1:17:25] brother brandham says whatever you do
[1:17:27] don't just don't be
[1:17:29] Driftwood life is
[1:17:31] precious it's valuable don't waste it I
[1:17:35] promise you it burns so fast already
[1:17:39] your life passes by at nuclear speed is
[1:17:41] just here today and gone tomorrow you're
[1:17:43] just a little Vapor you appear for a
[1:17:46] little while and then like a like a like
[1:17:49] you can look in the sky I preached years
[1:17:50] ago on a vapor trail I can look in the
[1:17:52] sky and I can see you know contrails
[1:17:55] from jets that have passed over I don't
[1:17:57] see the Jets they're already gone but I
[1:18:00] can see where they came from and I can
[1:18:02] see where they went to because the the
[1:18:04] one that's the most dispersed is the
[1:18:06] oldest and the one that's still tight is
[1:18:08] where they vanished into the Horizon so
[1:18:11] you know what kind of Trail are you
[1:18:12] leaving behind when people when you're
[1:18:14] gone and they see your life are they
[1:18:17] going to say are they going to look at
[1:18:18] your life and say he's in heaven how do
[1:18:20] you know cuz that's the way he went the
[1:18:22] his whole life he moved toward
[1:18:24] Heaven see
[1:18:27] so so it was the it's a it's a noble
[1:18:30] thing but but it falls short wisdom
[1:18:34] versus Faith wisdom of man though it has
[1:18:38] many noble Endeavors like brother
[1:18:39] Brandon would say when Jesus rose he
[1:18:42] said there had never been a man like him
[1:18:44] brother Brandon said there had been many
[1:18:46] good men there had been many good men
[1:18:49] who died for a good cause but there had
[1:18:52] never been a man a good man who died for
[1:18:55] the greatest cause and could lay his
[1:18:57] life down and then pick his own life
[1:18:58] back up again that had never happened
[1:19:01] see so so in Aristotle's view that's
[1:19:06] that's the way to get yourself to true
[1:19:09] and Lasting happiness Buddhism has some
[1:19:12] similars some similarities uh you know
[1:19:15] in Buddhism there's the idea of
[1:19:17] Enlightenment you know which involves
[1:19:19] letting go of of of of attachments and
[1:19:22] desires
[1:19:23] to where you achieve an an inner state
[1:19:26] of of inner peace and inner wisdom in
[1:19:29] Hinduism there's the idea of something
[1:19:31] called Maka which is The Liberation from
[1:19:34] the cycle of rebirth and
[1:19:37] suffering and you say well you know
[1:19:40] there there's there's always the tree of
[1:19:42] knowledge is a tree of Good and Evil you
[1:19:45] understand that's the that's the catch
[1:19:47] it it look it can look good say man
[1:19:49] that's pretty sensible we all desire
[1:19:52] that but as brother Brandon would say
[1:19:54] there's no way to achieve that only
[1:19:56] through Christ amen it's the only way to
[1:20:00] God is through Jesus Christ This is why
[1:20:04] a just God will raise the Heathen up in
[1:20:07] the Millennium who never heard the
[1:20:09] gospel so that he can have a chance see
[1:20:13] so so so this is Aristotle's View and
[1:20:16] and and his his proteges it was their
[1:20:19] View and they and you can see it in in
[1:20:21] that kind of um Greek uh wisdom you know
[1:20:25] so so we find that Jesus on the other
[1:20:29] hand would say that true happiness comes
[1:20:33] from a relationship with God Amen
[1:20:37] something Aristotle didn't include in
[1:20:39] his formula at all you just need to be a
[1:20:42] good person and and Excel in wisdom and
[1:20:45] knowledge and you'll have and that'll be
[1:20:47] the most satisfying life you can ever
[1:20:50] have you know the world is your oyster
[1:20:53] go get it and and you'll have a happy
[1:20:55] ending and that's just not
[1:20:57] true so Jesus comes along he's offering
[1:21:01] a completely different way that that
[1:21:04] true happiness only comes from a
[1:21:06] relationship with God though virtuous
[1:21:09] Behavior sure just like Aristotle says
[1:21:12] it's all about virtuous Behavior great
[1:21:15] that's awesome Jesus also preached ver
[1:21:18] virtuous Behavior but not just any
[1:21:21] virtuous Behavior
[1:21:23] it's a virtuous behavior that is
[1:21:26] inspired by faith in God that's the only
[1:21:32] real
[1:21:33] virtuous strength that that can make you
[1:21:37] acceptable in the
[1:21:39] Beloved is not that you went after
[1:21:41] wisdom wisdom versus faith faith wins
[1:21:44] every
[1:21:46] time
[1:21:47] see so for Jesus true happiness is found
[1:21:52] in surrendering to God's
[1:21:56] Will and living a life then that
[1:21:59] reflects God's love and God's grace that
[1:22:03] is taught in his word amen this is why
[1:22:08] the first and great commandment is to
[1:22:10] love God make him the center of your
[1:22:12] life he's your everything and then your
[1:22:14] life will be a life of Grace that you'll
[1:22:16] live among fellow men and then you will
[1:22:19] be uh in the perfect will and plan of
[1:22:22] God and that's virtuous and then by that
[1:22:26] you give virtue to those around you you
[1:22:29] don't weaken their faith by causing
[1:22:32] Confusion by by quoting this but living
[1:22:37] differently you're harming the
[1:22:40] world brother Brandon was so adamant
[1:22:43] about that that he said if you're not
[1:22:46] going to be a Christian stop calling
[1:22:49] yourself that cuz you're only make a
[1:22:52] confusion you're harming your fellow man
[1:22:55] you're not helping him I don't care how
[1:22:56] many hospitals you build for him and how
[1:22:59] many of bread lines you put him in
[1:23:01] you're you're harming him because you're
[1:23:04] you're you're not you're the greatest
[1:23:06] thing you can do I I said to the group
[1:23:09] in Swansea I wanted to repay their
[1:23:11] kindness to me and I got up on Sunday
[1:23:13] and I said you know the greatest thing I
[1:23:15] I want to somehow repay you all you've
[1:23:18] been so kind my accommodations the pull
[1:23:20] on the word has been so Wonder and I was
[1:23:23] driving to church today and I thought
[1:23:24] Lord what can I do for these people to
[1:23:27] show my gratitude and I thought to
[1:23:29] myself and I said this to them I said I
[1:23:31] thought to myself the greatest thing
[1:23:33] that I could do for you would be to
[1:23:35] Grant you eternal life however I don't
[1:23:38] have that kind of power it's not mine to
[1:23:41] give that would be the greatest thing I
[1:23:44] could do but since I can't do that what
[1:23:46] I can do is give you that which will
[1:23:49] lead you to eternal life I can do that I
[1:23:53] can give you the
[1:23:55] word and that's far better for you than
[1:23:58] if I give you
[1:23:59] $50 or
[1:24:01] $5,000 see so so we find then that that
[1:24:07] you know Jesus taught that it's a life
[1:24:09] that reflects God's love and God's grace
[1:24:12] as it's taught in the word otherwise
[1:24:14] you're harming the
[1:24:16] world Aristotle and
[1:24:18] Jesus were two for sure two of the most
[1:24:23] influential men that's ever lived in
[1:24:26] human history we we build our whole
[1:24:28] society today on aristotlean wisdom and
[1:24:31] Greek Greek
[1:24:33] knowledge and uh and so Aristotle and
[1:24:36] Jesus being two influential figures who
[1:24:39] have literally shaped the history of
[1:24:42] philosophy and religion and both of them
[1:24:45] uh have offered their viewpoints on what
[1:24:48] is udonia meaning happiness or
[1:24:51] well-being or or as Jesus would say that
[1:24:54] your joy may be full however how however
[1:24:59] their views differ
[1:25:01] significantly in terms of what
[1:25:04] constitutes these qualities and how they
[1:25:07] can be
[1:25:08] achieved for Aristotle he felt that udia
[1:25:13] is the highest human good and the
[1:25:16] ultimate goal of Life man's Wisdom and
[1:25:20] the practice of moral Behavior
[1:25:22] see so and and and as I've said it's
[1:25:26] it's not just a state of mind but it's
[1:25:27] an activity Aristotle actually believed
[1:25:30] in hearing recognizing and acting on his
[1:25:33] wisdom see so he defines virtue as a
[1:25:37] disposition to act in a rational and
[1:25:40] excellent way and to be balanced in your
[1:25:43] actions rejecting rashness Aristotle
[1:25:47] distinguishes between two kinds of
[1:25:49] virtue one he calls ethical virtue which
[1:25:52] involves moral character and emotions
[1:25:55] the other is intellectual virtue which
[1:25:57] involves wisdom and understanding this
[1:25:58] is this is similar to Abraham Lincoln
[1:26:01] saying that if you declare something to
[1:26:04] be true that you don't actually know is
[1:26:06] true then you have told a lie and he
[1:26:10] said that that's dishonesty at at the
[1:26:13] root level because you've told something
[1:26:15] as a matter of fact when as a matter of
[1:26:17] fact you don't know what you're talking
[1:26:19] about see and so he Aristotle had a high
[1:26:23] belief in ethical virtue morally and
[1:26:28] intellectually which involved wisdom and
[1:26:31] understanding showing you how to live a
[1:26:33] moral life and a life of character he
[1:26:35] argues that the highest forms it's okay
[1:26:39] he argues that the highest form of
[1:26:43] intellectual virtue is theoretical
[1:26:46] wisdom now we're coming to where brother
[1:26:48] Brandon preached wisdom versus
[1:26:50] Faith he he argued that intellectual
[1:26:53] wisdom was the highest form of
[1:26:55] intellectual virtue theoretical wisdom
[1:26:58] which consists of contemplating the most
[1:27:01] noble and divine things therefore he
[1:27:04] concluded that the most udic life is one
[1:27:10] that is to that is devoted to
[1:27:13] philosophical or scientific inquiry
[1:27:17] while also practicing ethical virtue and
[1:27:21] enjoying other Goods such as friendship
[1:27:24] pleasure and
[1:27:27] honor but for the the most radical
[1:27:31] teacher the world has ever had for Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ true
[1:27:38] happiness real
[1:27:41] contentment and and the fullness of joy
[1:27:47] are not worldly or human cont Concepts
[1:27:53] at all but they are a Divine gift and a
[1:27:58] promise from
[1:28:00] God and if you achieved them any other
[1:28:03] way you went around you you didn't come
[1:28:06] through the door and Jesus gives that
[1:28:08] Parable somebody crawled in with their
[1:28:11] aristotlean wisdom and got thrown out
[1:28:14] see so it's not something According To
[1:28:17] Jesus it's not something that can be
[1:28:20] achieved by human effort or reason it
[1:28:23] can only be achieved by grace and by
[1:28:26] faith Jesus teaches contrary to
[1:28:29] Aristotle that things are not at all
[1:28:32] dependent hear me hear me hear me
[1:28:34] there's a big point oh my and I know
[1:28:37] you're paying attention I'm just getting
[1:28:39] excited Jesus teaches that these things
[1:28:42] are not at all happiness contentment the
[1:28:45] fullness of joy you
[1:28:48] dimia Jesus teaches that they're not at
[1:28:51] all
[1:28:52] dependent on external
[1:28:55] circumstances or
[1:28:57] possessions but but it's based on one
[1:29:00] thing your relationship with God and
[1:29:03] obedience to his
[1:29:06] will oh I could that way I could dismiss
[1:29:08] we go home that's enough for you for the
[1:29:10] day has nothing to do with your
[1:29:13] accomplishments or or winning the Blue
[1:29:16] Ribbon it's not about how many how many
[1:29:17] zeros are in your bank account or how
[1:29:19] your education is that that's wisdom
[1:29:22] versus Faith choose
[1:29:28] Faith Jesus defines them as the
[1:29:30] Fulfillment of the law and the prophets
[1:29:32] which can be summed up in those two
[1:29:35] Commandments loving God with all your
[1:29:36] heart soul and mind and strength and
[1:29:38] love your neighbor as yourself it's not
[1:29:40] as we said two different things but the
[1:29:42] latter is the result of loving God fully
[1:29:44] he also Jesus actually in his in his
[1:29:48] teaching sets down on the mount one day
[1:29:51] and goes into teaching of Parables and
[1:29:54] he starts to we we call it the
[1:29:56] Beatitudes see and so in in the
[1:30:00] Beatitudes which describe now look how
[1:30:02] contrary this is to
[1:30:05] aristotlean uh udonia Jesus in his
[1:30:09] Beatitudes he describes the qualities
[1:30:13] and attitudes that lead to the fullness
[1:30:17] of
[1:30:19] joy for example he says
[1:30:22] that those who are poor in spirit Meek
[1:30:27] merciful pure in heart peacemakers
[1:30:31] persecuted for righteous Stakes for
[1:30:33] righteous sake those are the Blessed
[1:30:36] ones and those are the ones who will
[1:30:39] inherit the kingdom of God the Kingdom
[1:30:42] of Heaven therefore he
[1:30:44] concludes that the most
[1:30:46] fulfilled and joyful life is one that
[1:30:50] follows him as Messiah follows him as
[1:30:55] the Son of God and even follows him in
[1:30:58] the fellowship of his suffering being
[1:31:01] made conformable unto his death while
[1:31:03] also at the same time serving others and
[1:31:06] seeking God's kingdom Above All
[1:31:11] Else wisdom versus Faith make your
[1:31:14] choice today make your choice young
[1:31:17] people you're headed for a youth camp
[1:31:19] make your choice now don't wait two
[1:31:20] weeks from now
[1:31:25] amen so Aristotle's view is based on his
[1:31:28] rational and his empirical investigation
[1:31:30] of human nature and reality whereas the
[1:31:34] Lord's view is based on his Revelation
[1:31:37] and Authority as God incarnate who you
[1:31:39] going to
[1:31:40] follow Aristotle's view emphasizes human
[1:31:44] autonomy and Excellence while Jesus's
[1:31:47] view emphasizes divine grace Aristotle's
[1:31:51] View aims at achieving happiness in this
[1:31:54] life while Jesus's view aims at at
[1:31:57] attaining happiness in the Life to Come
[1:32:00] GL Hallelujah that's the one I'm
[1:32:02] interested in
[1:32:07] today so my my sermon today too if I
[1:32:10] were to be preaching to Aristotle
[1:32:12] himself had I lived back there I would
[1:32:14] have my sermon would have been that true
[1:32:16] and Lasting joy and
[1:32:19] happiness it's not something
[1:32:22] that can be attained through external
[1:32:25] means like material possessions or you
[1:32:28] know worldly success and but rather
[1:32:30] Aristotle I would say it comes from
[1:32:33] within it comes from spiritual growth it
[1:32:37] it grows one's character it is the
[1:32:39] cultivation of the Life of Christ within
[1:32:43] you as Jesus said in Luke
[1:32:47] 17:21 the kingdom of God is with within
[1:32:53] you so the fullness of
[1:32:56] joy is a spiritual
[1:32:59] reality not a psychological one
[1:33:03] amen you'll never get the fullness of
[1:33:07] joy on a college campus
[1:33:10] instruction I I'm all for pursuing
[1:33:13] Excellence but just know that I don't
[1:33:15] care what you ever achieve in this life
[1:33:17] the fullness of joy is not going to be
[1:33:19] how many zeros are in your bank account
[1:33:21] that's not where it comes from the
[1:33:23] fullness of joy is not how many likes
[1:33:24] you have and clicks you have it's not
[1:33:26] that's not where it comes from that is
[1:33:27] so shallow so
[1:33:29] flimsy life moves by so quick at the
[1:33:32] speed of light this is exactly why that
[1:33:36] th this is exactly why and you've heard
[1:33:38] me teach them this before that when
[1:33:40] Jesus comes there in Matthew
[1:33:42] 16 and he says to them who do you who do
[1:33:45] men say I am they said well some
[1:33:47] Jeremiah Elias are one of the prophets
[1:33:48] he said well who do you say they said
[1:33:50] well you're Christ son of the Living God
[1:33:51] God and Jesus says blessed art thou
[1:33:53] Simon say blessed and and and Dr zoda's
[1:33:58] in his in his lexical Aid always took
[1:34:00] exception to that being translated as
[1:34:02] happy or fortunate he says not that it's
[1:34:05] not blessed in the Greek doesn't mean
[1:34:07] happier Fort that's
[1:34:09] aristotlean
[1:34:10] influence that's what they think of
[1:34:12] blessed means happy and fortunate you
[1:34:15] know but but but real the fullness of
[1:34:18] joy isn't isn't based on external things
[1:34:21] it's not based on accomplishments or
[1:34:22] possessions it it's based on a
[1:34:24] surrendered life that that lays its life
[1:34:26] on the cross beside of
[1:34:29] Christ and is willing to say Lord
[1:34:31] remember me when you enter into your
[1:34:35] kingdom so so and and Dr zod's always
[1:34:39] took exception to that he says what it
[1:34:41] literally means Is possessing the
[1:34:45] characteristic of
[1:34:47] deity I thought how Wonder have you ever
[1:34:49] heard brother R say a c genene cuz
[1:34:51] that's exactly what he's saying that
[1:34:53] word means Simon that this is how you
[1:34:56] recognize me because we have a common
[1:34:58] father we're K this is how I say thou
[1:35:01] art Peter this is how I know who you are
[1:35:03] that's how you know who I am that's why
[1:35:05] nobody can shake it from you because
[1:35:07] it's not it's not wisdom it's a it's an
[1:35:10] identity based on your inheritance based
[1:35:13] on a gene of God I'm here to tell you
[1:35:16] something friends I don't know the world
[1:35:17] can identify as this and identify as
[1:35:19] animals and identify as the opposite
[1:35:21] gender I identify as a spiritual being
[1:35:24] having a natural experience I identify
[1:35:27] that I came from God I'm going back to
[1:35:30] God I identify that we're kin folk and
[1:35:33] he's my father how do you know cuz I
[1:35:36] love his word and it consumes my
[1:35:40] life there's no other Pursuit worth
[1:35:43] anything besides
[1:35:46] that oh
[1:35:48] my so so from the perspective of a
[1:35:51] humanistic
[1:35:53] view of aristotlean wisdom and knowledge
[1:35:55] of Christ
[1:35:57] then you know if Aristotle was looking
[1:36:00] at at that
[1:36:02] verse he would say as many Greek
[1:36:05] Scholars as Dr zod's do Zodi said they
[1:36:08] misinterpret it Aristotle would do that
[1:36:11] he would look on it as happiness or he
[1:36:13] would look on it as being fortunate but
[1:36:16] from the perspective of revelation of
[1:36:18] the spirit it's much higher see it
[1:36:22] represents an
[1:36:24] identity oh my
[1:36:27] friends I am not here I'm G to close
[1:36:30] today I'm not hardly got hardly got
[1:36:33] going in this sermon I'm GNA

[1:36:38] statement but Anthony come bring your
[1:36:50] team
[1:36:51] I am not here and I hope you are not
[1:36:55] here to chase
[1:36:58] contentment or
[1:37:00] riches from a broken
[1:37:05] world this world is not my
[1:37:09] home I'm just passing through that's
[1:37:12] right my treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:37:17] beyond the
[1:37:20] blue
[1:37:22] why don't you stand with
[1:37:26] me I want you I want to say this again
[1:37:28] I've got three lines I want to give
[1:37:31] you and I'll try to
[1:37:36] stop I'm not here to
[1:37:40] chase contentment from the
[1:37:43] world I'm not here to chase riches from
[1:37:47] this broken
[1:37:49] world I my whole life is dedicated to
[1:37:53] one purpose and that is laying up
[1:37:56] Treasures beyond the
[1:37:59] stars
[1:38:01] someday I'll be drawing benefits from
[1:38:04] them as I sail right past them Same
[1:38:09] Stars friends you can't imagine what's
[1:38:12] just on the other side and we are so
[1:38:15] close to it we are so close to it i' I'd
[1:38:19] need at least another hour or maybe an
[1:38:21] hour and a half to finish my sermon so
[1:38:22] I'm not going to attempt it we are so
[1:38:27] close bow your heads with
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:33] me Lord I promised you I would
[1:38:37] just I determined Lord by your
[1:38:41] permission that I would go as far as I
[1:38:44] felt to go and when you gave me the
[1:38:46] nudge I would I would just stop so much
[1:38:49] more to say so much more I Des desire to
[1:38:52] say but I pray Lord God that enough was
[1:38:56] said today and I believe it
[1:38:59] was that it it it if it doesn't do
[1:39:03] anything Lord it was in a very
[1:39:04] provocative
[1:39:06] way to to provoke people to
[1:39:10] thinking that's that's what preaching
[1:39:12] does if it's successful it provokes
[1:39:16] thought it provokes
[1:39:20] introspection and and and in that sense
[1:39:22] it's always to be provocative in that
[1:39:25] way it's not just I'm not just up here
[1:39:27] as an information Source I'm not an AI
[1:39:30] and I'm not a not here just to as a
[1:39:33] newsman I I'm here to provoke people to
[1:39:36] thinking
[1:39:38] deeply a sermon is successful no matter
[1:39:41] its content no matter how long or how
[1:39:44] brief it might be its success is based
[1:39:48] on the fact that does it get people to
[1:39:50] think on their
[1:39:53] ways Lord we saw such a an
[1:39:58] astonishing display of that last
[1:40:02] Wednesday night and we had a brother who
[1:40:04] just preached I I don't even know if he
[1:40:07] preached 30 minutes and one after
[1:40:10] another after another after another
[1:40:12] after another after another came forward
[1:40:14] from prayer why
[1:40:17] Lord because as our brother said I just
[1:40:21] I just preached what the lord gave me
[1:40:23] and it
[1:40:25] worked it it it didn't have to be hours
[1:40:28] long it
[1:40:30] worked he he didn't have to run all over
[1:40:32] the building and have and have States
[1:40:35] presence and lights and and pyate
[1:40:38] Technics it worked it reached the heart
[1:40:41] of people and they had a response to the
[1:40:43] word of
[1:40:45] God I pray for such a response
[1:40:49] today Lord the altars always open people
[1:40:51] are always welcome to come for prayer
[1:40:53] that's any time it's anyone can come
[1:40:56] today for prayer but if no one comes I
[1:40:59] will gauge Lord the success of this
[1:41:02] service just knowing that this has
[1:41:05] caused people to pause and think
[1:41:08] deeply go back and maybe now you you'll
[1:41:12] have an interest to go back and hear
[1:41:15] God's Prophet preach wisdom versus
[1:41:18] Faith they are millenniums apart wisdom
[1:41:22] and
[1:41:23] Faith one is so human it it has good
[1:41:27] because it's a tree of knowledge of Good
[1:41:28] and Evil it has good embedded in it but
[1:41:31] it's a trick it's a trap to keep them
[1:41:33] from the real and brother Bram said why
[1:41:36] would you take a substitute when the
[1:41:38] heavens are full of the real why would
[1:41:41] you just take human philosophy however
[1:41:43] brilliant it may
[1:41:46] sound why would you accept the agenda of
[1:41:50] of the
[1:41:52] world rather than give your whole life
[1:41:57] over to the one who has built the next
[1:42:00] one and has a spot for you there oh Lord
[1:42:03] God I pray you'll move on Hearts young
[1:42:06] and old today I commit it to you now in
[1:42:10] Jesus name sing brother
