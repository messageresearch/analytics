foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that we have to come to your house we thank you Lord because we know how different this day could have been we offer prayer Lord for the Saints um Lord down in western Florida Lord who suffered such a Devastation to their cities we thank you for the reports that the Believers are all well and Lord we're thanking you for sparing Our Fair City once more as you have done so many times in the past we give you thanks this morning we ask you now to take us into your word Lord lead us and guide us now and to everything that you have for us in Jesus name amen God bless you friends let's turn to the Book of Psalms chapter 47. praise the Lord I was secretly coveting to take the Sunday school class today and it turned out to my favor at the last minute and so um I was asked if I could jump in brother Matt had a wonderful lesson lined up for us but we had a few technical issues he needed to attend to and I was just wanting so bad to teach the Sunday school class so I thank the Lord both Tom I think he heard my prayer and saw the burden on me amen happy to have sister Amy's family here with us today amen and so let's look in in Psalms chapter 47 and we're just going to read one verse and we will let you be seated straight away Psalms 47 and 4 you have it say Amen excuse me he shall choose our inheritance for us isn't that beautiful look at it again he shall choose our inheritance for us the Excellency of Jacob whom he loved Sila may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated praise the Lord now when we look into prayer and I want to take today a title the way of prayer there it is the way of prayer the lord gave me this thought actually some time ago and uh just ruminating on it and a little here a little there amen until it seemed like the Lord just rushed in on me the other morning up early and just I thought wow I sure would love to take the Sunday school but I guess I'll carry it for Wednesday night but amen and I'm careful not to do that on purpose because I promised Lord many years ago I would never do that if he gave me a thought for a sermon I wouldn't play the human part and go I'm going to save that for a lot of people or a big crowd of the service I want to preach it in and the Lord knows that's one of the promises among the few that I've kept for him and never kept to him and never broken I've broken plenty of them but never that one by his grace I don't know if you have the Amplified version there on the on the machine Brother Jay but if you could put that up if you do I'm going to read it regardless I want you to think about this 47th Psalm this fourth verse of the 47th Psalm and the Amplified it reads he chose our inheritance for us the glory and pride of Jacob whom he loves and you'll notice that word see law that means to pause and calmly think on that and I would like for you to do that this morning uh I'll just give you a few moments to pause and think about what he's saying here he chooses our inheritance for us isn't that wonderful think about that he chooses our inheritance for us then how should we pray what should be the approach angle when we pray what should be on the front of our mind not just in the back of our mind well hey I know he chooses my life but I got these needs and I got these desires and I'm going to go to prayer and ask him for him wait a minute he chooses our inheritance for us and catch it the glory and Excellence of Jacob so this is like a love letter of God saying listen I love you so much that I'm just going to go ahead and choose all your inheritance for you and set it out in front of you and I'm going to put you on the path and if you just follow me and trust me everything will turn out great Jeremiah chapter 29 I love this it's of we probably could almost quote this from our days and Sunday school class Jeremiah 29 11 brother Jason for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end think about that to give you an expected end in other words you know there there's one um uh the the one translation from Eugene Peterson's translation called the message I love it he says this is what God is saying to you in Jeremiah 29 11. I know what I'm doing yeah I have it all planned out plans to take care of you not abandon you plans to give you the future you hope for now I'm I'm not so uh you know spoiled as to think that that I want what I want regardless of the cost I know this I want to stand and sing on that Shore that's what I know that's my hope forth I say Lord that's my All My Hope Is I stand and sing on that Shore and the Lord is saying to me I know I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end to give you that desire of your heart many Haskins years ago Point wrote a poem called God knows it's one of my favorite poems of all time and I love poetry and especially of the spiritual kind and and she lived from 1875 to 1957. this is actually King George at the beginning of World War II read uh from a portion of this poem as England was committing its sons and uh and uh to war knowing that there would be the loss of millions and and so it refers to the man who stood at the Gate of the year now that's a metaphor uh you know we're coming to a new year and we're actually approaching a new year a year we never thought we would approach but we are so I just say let's fight on see he he he he's got it all planned amen so you can see why Jesus would would say be anxious for nothing all right because when you get anxious and and this is uh brother Branham talked about that and brother Branham called it a plague the nervousness of this age it's a nervous neurotic time of anxiety and anxiousness and brother Branham called it a part of the plague that that's upon this it's part of that seventh vial that affects the minds of men we've been preaching on but she she talks about it in this way I love this is the portion I'm always fond of quoting so she's in a metaphorical position coming to the man who stands at the Gate of the year and she's got to go through the gate you know and into the new year and so she says Miss Haskins says and I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the year oh if I can get through this give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown and he replied go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God that shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way so I went forth and finding the hand of God trod gladly into the night and he led me toward the hills and the breaking over the day in the lone East so heart be still what need our little life our human life to know if God hath comprehension in all the Dizzy Strife of things both high and low God hideth his intention amen God has a secret will and God doesn't always reveal his will to you up front that's why I read psalms 47 and Jeremiah saying I know my I've got it all fixed I've got it all planned I know my thoughts for you they're not evil they're for your good see so God has a secret will that he doesn't always reveal to us on a day-to-day basis he might not reveal the next several hours of future to you or the next several days or weeks or months or years but he is saying to you I will get you home he doesn't always explain his plan for you in any particular situation so now I come back to my to my basis how should we pray what should be our attitude in prayer how should we approach it what should be our expectations see you know it's all about your attitude you know you know as parents a child's attitude in a request can be the difference between life and between getting it and not getting it [Music] between getting it and not getting it amen um let me stop right there not going to go to husbands and wives [Laughter] but he doesn't always explain his plan for you in a particular situation in fact is you may get you may get no advanced warning of something coming and you may get no explanation at all after it has happened something that you did don't favor something you wouldn't have chosen for yourself you go down a path you say I've had I known I would have never well someone knew see and it's very likely the one who built the path God has a will that he keeps secret why why does he do that so he can bring it to pass without you running ahead of him and interfering that's really even on the good things because I can promise you you can't make anything come out as good as God can and you can look at an opportunity and say man I know how to maximize this no you don't you're totally inexperienced in future planning but you see trust put your hand in the hand of God you don't need a light I'm going to give you an idea of something that'll be better than a light and it'll be safer than a known way see so sometimes he he does that to keep you from running ahead to keep you from interfering as many Haskins said God hideth his intention but he always now and I want to say this because you know her she ends that part of it with God hides his intentions now I want to say to you with more perfect understanding from the scripture he always actually he he hides sometimes what he's doing and he hides what's about to happen to you he hides his plans he has them but he hides them but what he doesn't hide really is his intention by that I mean he never hides his motive and his objective his his objective is for your Perfection he says that in the Bible don't think it's strange the fiery trials that come your way because therefore you're good that's his goal Therefore your perfection even if they're fiery he says that I I have plans for your good we read it in Jeremiah not for evil so no I actually do know his intention even if I don't know his plan and even if I didn't get a pre-warning and even if it's bad and even if he won't tell me why I do know his intention his intention is love so how should we pray [Music] that's my subject today how should we pray his revealed will brother Branham has taught us is always his word and he gives his word to mankind to lead him and God will never reveal something to you contrary to his word amen if you think that you have an understanding of God's will you're going to have to make sure to qualify it by the word of God because God will never go outside of his will this is why brother Brandon would say anything outside the line in order of his word fails so you want to make sure that your life is going forward that you're living the kind of life according to his word you're living the kind of life he can get behind and prosper that life he has a will and a prescribed path for our lives to follow and very often it can be kept secret at the start a will sometimes that he makes clear by measure but in in in all of it he wants us to trust him so how should we pray he wants us to trust him when we say thy will be done that's what Jesus said he was the Prototype he gave us an example see he was Jesus the Christ and and the Christ is the anointed word some Jesus life was a blueprint for when it would be your turn to be the word made flesh so when he says thy will be done see that's how he taught us to pray he set the example in the Garden of Gethsemane when you don't know God's will and you're in a terrible fix in a terrible situation and you say brother Jason I've prayed and God won't reveal his will to me I don't know what to do well you can always fall back on not my will but thine be done amen so there's no out here you're not going to do an end around on God God has this lesson today is about teaching you the approach to prayer and what should be our attitude see and so when we say thy will be done you need to understand that we are agreeing to his secret will for us so when you pray they said Lord teach us how to pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven and he goes on down this prayer you know you know and and and he we're looking to make the Earthly image match the Heavenly image see that's that's that's what his prayer is All About You Know Thy will be done on on Earth in this Earth as it is in heaven whatever is your word whatever is your vision for my life that's my prayer that this life matched that one whatever it takes to get me to that do it here so we are agreeing to his secret will for us to be you know to be slowly revealed and it will be slowly revealed but oftentimes by unfolding as we continue to trust and follow amen regardless of circumstances wow God first tells the Exiles give me Jeremiah 29 again brother Jason and let's look at verses 10 and 11. Jeremiah 29 10 11 for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end they're headed into 70 years of imprisonment of Babylonian captivity where their hearts become so sad that they sit by the river and the Babylonians say wow when we first took you guys in my goodness you had all these songs and you played these wonderful instruments and you had the joy of your God in you and man you you you you made you made all of Babylon Mary and and we were we were almost happy to capture you and but you know play play for us those songs again and the Jews said how can we how can we sing the songs of joy and happiness when our hearts are broken because we're held captive here what what we're starting to learn is is that God first tells the Exiles what he will do and why see he's actually telling them here's what I'm going to do and here's you know why I'm doing it I made it clear in my Prophet Jeremiah has already told you you went away from me you backslid it from my will you're here for punishment uh Hannah lied to you he was a he was a false anointed person he was a true anointing but a false messenger because he prophesied you contrary to my will and told you contrary to what Jeremiah told you he told you two years that's not going to happen I killed him yeah amen amen and what I told you is going to come to pass you're going to be here for 70 years and now you know what's going to happen and now you know why it's going to happen and therefore what should be the attitude of their prayer they should pray accordingly and then verse 12 give me verse 12. then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken to you so he first tells them what he'll do he then tells him why he did it and then they are to pray accordingly and then God will hear them pray accordingly pray according to his will I'm going to be here 70 years he doesn't want me to ask him yeah let me go in 20 years that's not his will he's already gave them his will he's already told them what he's doing it he's already told them it's to restore them and he will restore them and they need not fear it but they need to say thy will be done that should be their prayer what should be your prayer friends see so those who seek God where the whole heart will find him look at verse 13 and 14 brother Jason verse 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you isn't that beautiful saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity after 70 years and I will gather you from all the nations from all the places with her I have driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you again into this place once I caused you to be carried away captive so those who seek God with a whole heart will find him those who are willing to accept his will for their life and pray I'm gonna I got a little bit to say about that in the main service today I don't want to jump into that but but you know we shouldn't complain about the way that God has set for us see he knows what he's doing and so prayer is not trying to get God to do something he might not otherwise do I want to say that again prayer is not something it's not a tool to be used to try to get God to do something he might not otherwise do it's not like you're rushing into the throne and saying God I got a better idea than you how about this yes sir not amazing I mean how many times have we done that yeah it's not trying to get God to do something he might not otherwise do rather I gotta hurry rather it is aligning our thoughts our desires and and and and and our thoughts and our desires and our will with God so that's the primary function of Prayer not not to fix God to fix you see not that he needs an attitude adjustment you do not that he needs to understand what's really going on I promise you he understands it infinitely better than you do see yes and so you know we we must align our thoughts and our desires with God's revealed will as we consider our circumstances consider our circumstances in light of what he has revealed to us so if his revealed will is for you to have more love and more patience and more faith then don't pray against the methodology he uses to get you there and question him amen see we're learning we're learning how to pray aren't we so we ask him to do his will uh give me Matthew 6 10 brother Jason let's look at this one verse here in Matthew 6 10. thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth this Earth and in my life in Earth in my life in this body as it is in heaven so we ask him to do his will God speaks first God speaks and we respond to his word amen see so he initiates prayer how does God what is what is what is God when he's calling upon you to pray he initiates Prayer by revealing his will because true prayer is always that that God will fulfill his revealed will so I don't need him to spell out what's happening tomorrow or what's happening today I don't need to know the why see I just when I go to prayer my my goal is is to build up my faith to trust in him he hears me when I pray and I and I know if I ask according to his word that he heareth me the Bible says that that you can know that he hears you and when you know that he hears you you know what you have what you've asked for what should we be asking for Lord align my will with your will my life with your life help me that's that's what prayer is four is to get you conditioned to walk in faith because whatsoever is not faith is sin so when we don't know the details of his will as I said to you we can follow the example of Jesus yet not what I will but what you will you can read that in Mark chapter 14. as his adopted children that's what we are we are adopted through the faith of Abraham we are adopted into the family of Christ I want to tell you something friends you can rest confident that whatever he ordains will ultimately be for our joy and His glory now could you want a better outcome than that say Lord I don't know all the why I don't even know the what I'm not even sure what's the question that I need to ask but but here's what I know I know what your intentions are I've read in the Bible that you have ordained my path I've read in Psalms 47 I've read in Jeremiah 29 29 that that that you have thoughts of good and not for evil Psalms 47 do you have the NLT New Living Translation Jay Psalms 47 1. in the NLT come everyone clap your hands shout to God with joyful praise for the Lord most high is awesome he is the great king of all the Earth he subdues the Nations before us putting our enemies beneath our feet he chose the promised land as our inheritance the proud possession of Jacob's descendants whom he loves Sila interlude think on that God has a plan God knows what he's doing with our lives and that my friends is the way of Prayer God bless you we'll have an intermission I went one minute over apologize to brother Tony God bless you we'll see you in the main service [Music]
