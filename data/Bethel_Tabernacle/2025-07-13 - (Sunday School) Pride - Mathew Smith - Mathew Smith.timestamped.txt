[0:00] Lord, we come before you this morning,
[0:02] Lord, to gather together for a Sunday
[0:04] school lesson. Lord, that if we'd be
[0:07] dependent upon this man, this this flesh
[0:11] of mine to bring some lessons that it'd
[0:13] be a useless lesson, Father, it'd be
[0:16] nothing of value. But Lord, that we're
[0:18] turning to you, that you would speak,
[0:20] that I would offer up myself for you to
[0:23] speak through me, and that the people
[0:24] would be encouraged and blessed,
[0:26] that they would be uh uplifted where
[0:29] uplifting would need and and chastised
[0:32] where chastisement would be needed, and
[0:34] that correction
[0:36] begins at the house of the Lord. But
[0:39] encouragement and healing begins there
[0:40] as well. So, Father, we ask that you
[0:43] would be with us this morning, that we
[0:45] could as we look into the word that it
[0:47] would have need of whatever it is that
[0:49] we would have need of would be met. We
[0:52] ask these things in the name of the Lord
[0:54] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Um, we want to turn um to Isaiah 14 and
[1:01] verse 12 this morning.
[1:05] Um,
[1:11] Did I get that 14 and verse 12
[1:14] and
[1:16] it says, "How art thou fallen from
[1:19] heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning?
[1:22] How art thou cut down to the ground
[1:24] which d weaken the nations? For thou
[1:28] hast said in thine heart, I will ascend
[1:30] into heaven. I will exalt my throne
[1:32] above the stars of God. I will sit also
[1:35] upon the mount of the congregation in
[1:37] the sides of the north. I will ascend
[1:39] above the heights of the clouds. I will
[1:42] be like the most high.
[1:45] Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell,
[1:48] to the sides of the pit, that uh they
[1:52] that see thee shall narrowly look upon
[1:56] thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this
[1:59] the man that made the earth to tremble,
[2:01] that did shake kingdoms? You all can be
[2:04] seated as the Lord would add blessing to
[2:07] the word. Um I want to speak this
[2:10] morning um the name of my this thought
[2:13] um I've named pride. Um obviously we're
[2:18] hopefully hopefully we're familiar with
[2:20] this scripture. um is very uh you know
[2:24] common reference when we're talking
[2:26] about the origin of not only of Lucifer
[2:29] but this is the this is the moment in
[2:31] which
[2:32] you know there was a war in heaven began
[2:34] right like this is a moment in which we
[2:36] now have a deviation from the plan of
[2:39] God or not necessarily I mean all things
[2:41] are in the plan of God but this is a
[2:44] moment in which you have a conflict
[2:45] between what God wants and what this
[2:47] other entity wants right
[2:48] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:49] &gt;&gt; this is kind of the origin of of all the
[2:52] all the misery and hate and destruction
[2:55] and and you know awful things that we
[2:58] can think of all started right there,
[3:00] &gt;&gt; right? It all started with Lucifer
[3:03] wanting to raise himself
[3:06] above God's congregation.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; And it's I think it's important that we
[3:10] look at origin. If there's anything that
[3:13] I would say that is a a theme that you
[3:15] could run through the entire message of
[3:17] the hour, it is that um
[3:20] origin is a termination of outcome.
[3:23] Right? Or your outcomes are indication
[3:25] of your origin.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Right? The fulfillment of something is
[3:29] only a manifestation of where it
[3:30] started. And where things start is going
[3:33] to be a direct line to where you're
[3:36] going to end.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:38] And one, you know, we this is just a
[3:42] fulfillment of the principle that every
[3:43] seed brings forth after its own kind.
[3:46] And I don't think that we can really
[3:49] understand where we are today in this
[3:51] day and hour. Um, unless we get back to
[3:56] a lot of the original ideas that God had
[3:59] for humanity, right? That what was the
[4:01] purpose that God had for man when he
[4:04] made uh man? what was the what was you
[4:07] know the the big question why are we
[4:09] here right obviously not why are these
[4:12] people in this building today but why is
[4:14] humanity on the earth what was the point
[4:16] of all that
[4:17] &gt;&gt; um
[4:19] and
[4:22] you know if we want to look at the
[4:23] spirits that we have today we we
[4:26] obviously were you know taught well that
[4:28] we're surrounded we are in Satan's Eden
[4:30] we are surrounded by evil spirits we're
[4:32] surrounded by darkness we're surrounded
[4:33] by things that frankly to the h to the,
[4:36] you know, to the saint seems like this
[4:38] is madness. This is absolute insanity.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Um, but you'll only ever be able to
[4:44] really figure out, you'll only
[4:46] understand why things are the way they
[4:48] are if we go back and look at how they
[4:50] started, right? We'll only understand
[4:53] what happened in is going on in the book
[4:54] of Revelations if we know what happened
[4:56] in the book of Genesis, right? You'll
[4:58] only, you know, brother Brandham said
[5:01] that the the um the seeds of every
[5:05] everything in Revelation in the book of
[5:06] Revelations got is was seeded. It was
[5:10] Genesis is the seed book, right?
[5:12] Everything was planted in Genesis that
[5:14] ultimately sprouted and grew and bear
[5:15] fruit in Revelation, which is where we
[5:17] are.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:19] And
[5:21] um you know we the Bible the and we in
[5:24] revelations we hear a lot about things
[5:25] like the mark of the beast and the
[5:26] antichrist
[5:28] and
[5:30] um you know that's something especially
[5:33] even amongst the sort of the nominal
[5:35] Christian world and even the secular
[5:36] world that especially in this this time
[5:38] when everything seems so chaotic and and
[5:40] and
[5:42] at risk and it seems like even you don't
[5:44] even have to be a Christian it seems
[5:45] like and people are realizing that the
[5:47] end of the world is upon
[5:48] right? We're getting down to the down to
[5:50] the end and people are starting to
[5:53] really um
[5:55] a lot of this stuff comes up, you know,
[5:57] and so I think it behooves us if we're
[6:00] going to be the people who are in
[6:02] opposition to the Antichrist spirit. It
[6:04] really behooves us to really
[6:08] figure out what that is,
[6:10] &gt;&gt; right? You can't be in opposition to
[6:11] something that you don't understand. You
[6:13] can't be in opposition to something that
[6:15] you don't know what it is. You can't
[6:17] defend yourself against something that
[6:19] you can't see,
[6:20] &gt;&gt; right? Um,
[6:24] and so I want to uh look and I we let's
[6:28] turn to Genesis chapter 4 and verse 8.
[6:33] And I think this is I think an excellent
[6:37] um
[6:39] representation. is really, as far as I
[6:42] can tell, one of, if not the first
[6:44] really good glimpse in the Bible of what
[6:46] the Antichrist spirit looks like, how it
[6:50] manifests, and which included in that is
[6:52] the mark of the beast.
[6:55] And it says um
[6:59] uh
[7:00] and Abel, let's see, where's my reading?
[7:04] We'll go down to verse eight. And Cain
[7:06] talked with Abel his brother. And it
[7:08] came to pass when they were in the field
[7:10] that Cain rose up against Abel his
[7:12] brother, and slew him. And the Lord said
[7:15] unto Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?"
[7:17] And he said, "I know not. Am I my
[7:19] brother's keeper?" And he said, "What
[7:21] hast thou done? The voice of thy
[7:23] brother's blood crith unto me from the
[7:26] ground." Uh,
[7:30] and uh, now thou art cursed from the
[7:32] earth, which hath opened her mouth to
[7:34] receive thy brother's blood from thy
[7:36] hand. I want to skip down to verse 15.
[7:38] And the Lord said unto him, um,
[7:43] uh, see, yeah. And the Lord said unto
[7:46] him, therefore, whosoever slayth Cain,
[7:47] vengeance shall be taken on him
[7:49] sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon
[7:52] Cain, lest any finding him should kill
[7:54] him. And so, here is Cain. And you know,
[7:57] I'm sure we're all familiar with the
[7:59] story. This is the adult Sunday school
[8:00] class. Um the uh you know, the you know,
[8:06] Cain was Cain was warned ahead of time.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we know the story. Kane, you
[8:10] know, if you're taught at all in the
[8:12] scripture, you understand these people
[8:14] were not Cain wasn't non-religious. He
[8:17] wasn't um completely he wasn't an
[8:20] atheist. He wasn't uh completely against
[8:24] you know the living right. I would I
[8:27] mean just consider this.
[8:30] If Abel got the revelation that blood
[8:33] was required
[8:36] to atone doesn't that kind of imply that
[8:41] Abel was felt guilty about something so
[8:44] strongly that he knew blood was only
[8:46] going to fix it?
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Abel knew that there was like he
[8:51] recognized that what was needed was
[8:53] blood. On a on a outwardfacing level on
[8:57] a on a from the outside looking at the
[8:59] these two brothers I would hazard a
[9:02] guess that Cain looked a lot holier than
[9:05] Abel did from the outside.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Cain's sacrifice was beautiful.
[9:10] Cain's uh religion was beautiful. Cain
[9:13] had this beautiful thing. But when it
[9:15] came down to it, when they came into the
[9:17] presence of the Lord,
[9:20] the deciding factor between who was the
[9:24] seed of the serpent and who was not came
[9:27] down to their reaction to the word of
[9:30] the Lord. Yes.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; And another thing that we see here is
[9:33] that one of the defining features of
[9:39] a Lucifer spirit of an antichrist spirit
[9:42] of of evil actual evil is the evasion of
[9:48] accountability.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? When somebody is confronted with
[9:52] the word of God, when somebody is
[9:53] confronted with here's you're not living
[9:55] right and here's why. here's here's the
[9:57] the line and order of God's word and and
[9:59] you're not measuring up to that. The
[10:01] first thing someone will do if they're
[10:03] operating under the spirit of of Lucifer
[10:05] will evade accountability
[10:08] &gt;&gt; always what what did what did uh when
[10:11] God comes to come to Adam and Eve in the
[10:14] garden
[10:16] they they were trying to cover
[10:17] themselves God asks Adam who gave you
[10:19] the fruit oh that woman you gave me
[10:22] Adam's evading accountability he's
[10:24] evading responsibility doesn't want to
[10:26] admit fault right Cain as soon as he he
[10:30] uh he kills his brother and God comes to
[10:32] him. What does he say? Well, I don't
[10:34] know what happened to him. Am I am I his
[10:36] keeper? Right? He wants to he wants to
[10:38] evade. He doesn't want to confront what
[10:39] he did. And I mean and you this pattern
[10:42] follows all through the scripture
[10:45] &gt;&gt; every time somebody you know when it's
[10:49] the exact same uh as to paraphrase
[10:53] brother Brandham. I don't have it in my
[10:54] notes. It's just kind of come to me. He
[10:56] there's a a quote where he says, you
[10:58] know, we we know that, you know, God
[11:00] doesn't send sinners to hell. He sends
[11:01] rejectors to hell, right? And in that he
[11:03] says, God won't send someone to hell for
[11:05] being a sinner. He'll only send someone
[11:07] to hell because they remained a sinner
[11:10] when they didn't have to.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; The defining feature, I mean, as brother
[11:15] JD has been teaching, um, which I think
[11:17] is very, very good. You should all
[11:19] listen to that if you haven't. Um about
[11:22] the uh David versus Saul, how Saul, you
[11:26] know, he he was given a commandment to
[11:28] go do something. He he didn't kill all
[11:31] the didn't slaughter everything. He took
[11:33] he flew upon the spoils. He brought a
[11:35] bunch of people back, took the king
[11:36] alive. And then when the prophet comes
[11:38] to him and confronts him on this, he
[11:40] says, "Oh, the people did it.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; The people took the spoils." Well,
[11:45] sorry, Saul. The buck stops with you,
[11:46] buddy. like you're the you're the king.
[11:49] You you sat on your hands and didn't do
[11:51] anything when you saw them doing this.
[11:53] You the buck stops with you. You don't
[11:56] get to say
[11:58] and I I truly feel like this is this is
[12:00] a an exhortation to anyone, myself
[12:05] included, if if nobody else, right?
[12:08] Anyone who is in a leadership position,
[12:12] okay? Whether you are a a a husband to a
[12:15] wife, a father to children, a mother to
[12:18] your children, a minister, whatever your
[12:20] situation is, if you are in a leadership
[12:23] position, and your instinct is to let
[12:26] let the people under you take the blame
[12:29] for things, that is antichrist spirit.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Period. Okay. What was the nature of
[12:36] Christ? that people that when he did
[12:38] nothing wrong, Christ did everything
[12:40] right. And yet the people under him, he
[12:43] took their blame on himself.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; That is the nature of Christ to accept
[12:48] blame and accept judgment even when you
[12:51] don't deserve it because you're in
[12:54] charge. They're your responsibility.
[12:56] They're they're under you. And so when
[12:58] when uh when uh parents want to say,
[13:02] "Well, my kids are doing wrong and it's
[13:04] on that's not my, you know, I'm not
[13:07] going to accept blame for that." You
[13:09] might not accept it, but God doesn't see
[13:11] it that way.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Okay? God will lay that blame upon you,
[13:15] &gt;&gt; right? There's even a a a I I I read
[13:20] this before. I don't again I don't have
[13:21] it. This is kind of coming to me. I
[13:23] believe it's in doors and door and doors
[13:26] in Flagstaff I think is when he preached
[13:29] this. Um I don't quote me on that though
[13:32] my memory memory may uh may fail me
[13:34] there. But um brother Brandon in dealing
[13:37] with uh young men who um he's talking
[13:40] about these young these young boys who
[13:42] he saw them in a I think a restaurant
[13:44] come in and they're all sloppy and their
[13:46] hair's not cut and they're you know got
[13:47] hair hanging down and and he called them
[13:50] uh uh you know just just disheveled and
[13:53] and um I think he called them like look
[13:55] like trying to look like the Beatles.
[13:57] and he said that any man who would hire
[14:00] a young man that looked like that uh
[14:03] couldn't even call themselves a
[14:04] Christian. Okay? Even when it comes down
[14:08] to employers in their hiring decisions,
[14:11] who you hire, who you voluntarily
[14:13] associate with your name as a and
[14:16] reputation as a Christian, right? That
[14:19] level of leadership, like even at that
[14:21] level of leadership, you are responsible
[14:23] for what people do. If you accept that
[14:25] level of leadership, this is why this is
[14:28] why
[14:31] uh it is so vitally important,
[14:36] vitally important, life and death
[14:39] important that when we are talking about
[14:41] courtship, when we are talking about uh
[14:44] you know getting young people getting
[14:46] ready to get married and start their own
[14:48] families that we need to be absolutely
[14:52] positive, be on any shadow of a doubt
[14:54] that the young men who are going to be
[14:56] going to become heads of household
[14:59] actually have the spirit of God inside
[15:00] of them living through them and with the
[15:02] Holy Ghost. You you do not want to play
[15:05] games with that. We need to have a
[15:07] revelation of headship. We need to have
[15:08] a revelation of what that means, right?
[15:11] Leadership is not I sit at the back and
[15:14] point fingers of where to go and what to
[15:17] do. Leadership means the first one in
[15:20] line, right? There's a um a famous
[15:24] speech in which Alexander the Great,
[15:26] great general, you know, led his armies,
[15:28] conquered half the world, basically the
[15:30] entire known world at that time. He gets
[15:32] to a point and all of his men were
[15:33] getting ready to abandon him um because
[15:35] they felt like he wasn't appreciating
[15:37] them. And he has this great speech where
[15:39] he basically says, "Shame on all of you.
[15:41] Shame on you. you how many time you guys
[15:44] are sitting here you know laying charge
[15:45] against me but any time that there was
[15:48] uh you know when we went to battle I was
[15:50] the first one in the charge I've got
[15:52] scars all over my body you know
[15:54] there'sn't a single part of my body that
[15:55] doesn't have scars on it cuz I was
[15:56] wounded in the battle just like you you
[15:59] know I you know there's there's when the
[16:01] when it was time to collect spoils I
[16:03] didn't take hardly anything I gave
[16:04] everything to my men you know uh there's
[16:07] there's when it was time to you know uh
[16:09] stand out you know lose some sleep so
[16:11] you can be on nightw watch. I Alexander
[16:14] was the was in the line too. Alexander
[16:16] didn't didn't uh um sure like he he
[16:21] didn't think well I'm the king I'm I'm
[16:22] the boss I can just do whatever I want
[16:24] you know and let the peeons take care of
[16:26] the the no he was the first one in line
[16:28] and because of that his men would have
[16:31] followed him to the end of the earth
[16:32] they were ready to
[16:33] &gt;&gt; and and that's you know that's a a
[16:35] carnal example but I mean even even
[16:39] amongst carnal people we recognize it's
[16:41] it's so clear
[16:44] when Uh true leadership is being the
[16:49] first one to take the responsibility.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't
[16:53] &gt;&gt; you can't expect your children to rise
[16:57] higher than your level of spirituality.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Okay? You you you'll you have to lift
[17:06] them up to where you're at. And if
[17:08] they're not higher, like if they're not
[17:09] up to that level, then you need to climb
[17:11] higher,
[17:12] &gt;&gt; right? You need to climb higher. lift
[17:14] people up with you as you go higher the
[17:17] you know and that's that's for anyone
[17:18] who wants to be in a leadership position
[17:20] anyone who wants to be a leader even
[17:22] amongst I mean we can get all the way
[17:25] from the level of ministry all the way
[17:28] down to the level of if you think you're
[17:30] a leader amongst you know a a youth
[17:33] person like a young person who's seen as
[17:36] a leader of your friend group you have a
[17:38] responsibility to be raising people
[17:40] higher
[17:41] &gt;&gt; right if people are looking to you for
[17:43] leadership, then be a a proper leader.
[17:46] Be a true leader. Your your influence on
[17:48] people matters. And the what you push
[17:52] people towards or pull people towards
[17:54] will you will be held accountable for
[17:55] that.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Um
[17:58] that was a rabbit trail I did not intend
[18:01] to go down. Um at least not to that to
[18:05] that extent. Um but yeah, so with David,
[18:09] we know that when when David did wrong
[18:11] that the an the prophet came to him,
[18:13] David immediately accepted
[18:14] accountability,
[18:16] &gt;&gt; right? Immediately repented, immediately
[18:19] uh uh turned from what he had done. Um
[18:23] we know with the sin with Bashibba
[18:24] again, um when he had um uh where do I
[18:29] have this? Um
[18:34] uh in 2 Samuel 24:17, David had brought
[18:37] a census and which was he wasn't
[18:39] supposed to do that and so the Lord was
[18:41] going to punish him. And there came a
[18:43] plague and what did David say? Lord, he
[18:46] could see the angel wiping the people
[18:47] out with pestilence. He said, "Lord,
[18:49] I've done wrong, but what have these
[18:51] sheep done? What have my sheep done?
[18:54] &gt;&gt; My the people that you've put over me,
[18:55] they didn't do anything wrong. I did
[18:57] wrong. Punish me." Right? Don't the mark
[19:01] of a true headship, the mark of a true
[19:03] leader, the mark of someone who is um
[19:08] going to fulfill the role of of a
[19:10] headship in accordance with Christ
[19:14] will not be so proud that he will avoid
[19:17] responsibility. He will always accept
[19:19] blame, always expect accept
[19:21] responsibility even when it's not really
[19:23] his fault.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[19:27] Because even Moses, even Moses said when
[19:29] the people had built the golden calf,
[19:31] Moses when God was I'm going to wipe
[19:32] them out, Moses, we're going to restart
[19:34] with you. And Moses says, "Well, if
[19:35] you're going to if you're going to
[19:36] destroy them, then blot my name out of
[19:37] the book, too." Right? The leader will
[19:40] not expect his people to be punished or
[19:43] or destroyed without being the first one
[19:46] in line for destruction, right? Because
[19:48] it's his responsibility no matter where,
[19:51] you know, what part of that you're on.
[19:53] Um,
[19:57] now the the key thing that I want to get
[19:59] at here is this avoiding of
[20:02] responsibility, avoiding of uh
[20:05] accountability and trying to evade and
[20:07] say, well, it's not my fault or I have
[20:09] some excuse or it's, you know, here's
[20:11] some gray area or I'm going to create
[20:13] my, you know,
[20:16] ludicrous legal theory as to why I have
[20:18] these quotes in these scriptures and I'm
[20:20] going to concoct some amalgamation to
[20:22] justify by this thing that in 99.999%
[20:26] of every quotes that you know you can
[20:28] come up with it's flatly condemned and
[20:31] yet you have some contraption that
[20:33] you've built out of you know and now and
[20:37] now you're going to justify some action.
[20:39] Look, I mean
[20:42] that kind of attitude just shows that
[20:44] again it's you're you're avoiding
[20:46] accountability. you're avoiding when
[20:48] when the the word is coming and trying
[20:51] to bring you into something beautiful,
[20:53] right? If the if you believe that God
[20:55] loves you, then you believe that God
[20:56] want wants what's best for you, right?
[21:00] It's showing there's a lack of trust.
[21:02] It's showing when people are avoiding
[21:04] accountability and avoiding facing the
[21:07] consequences of what they've done. It
[21:09] shows that there there's a there's fear
[21:11] there, right? It's either it's either
[21:14] one of two things. either pride, they
[21:15] they just cannot stand the thought of
[21:20] facing
[21:21] um
[21:23] that they weren't actually as good as
[21:24] they thought they were.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Which actually, I think I'm I'm just
[21:27] going to skip down to something real
[21:29] quick. Um let's go to uh Romans chapter
[21:31] 1. I only have a few more minutes. Time
[21:34] just flies.
[21:36] Um
[21:39] uh I want to turn to Romans
[21:42] chapter 1.
[21:50] and we're going to go to verse 18
[21:59] um
[22:01] actually we'll go to verse 19. It says
[22:03] because they uh because that which may
[22:05] be known of God is manifest in him in
[22:08] them. For God hath showed it unto them.
[22:10] For the invisible things of him from the
[22:13] creation of the world are clearly seen
[22:15] being understood by the things that are
[22:17] made even his external power and
[22:20] godhead. So that so that they are
[22:22] without excuse. Because that right when
[22:26] they knew God, they glorified him not as
[22:30] God, neither were thankful, but became
[22:32] vain in their imaginations, and their
[22:34] foolish heart was darkened. Professing
[22:37] themselves to be wise, they became
[22:39] fools, and changed the glory of the
[22:41] uncorruptible God into an image made
[22:44] like to corruptible man, and and to
[22:47] birds, and for-footed beasts, and
[22:49] creeping things. Wherefore God also gave
[22:52] them up to uncleanness through the lust
[22:54] of their own hearts to dishonor their
[22:56] own bodies between uh between themselves
[23:00] who changed the truth of God into a lie
[23:03] and worshiped and served the creature
[23:06] more than the creator who is blessed
[23:08] forever. Amen.
[23:11] So here's Paul laying out why
[23:17] humanity when confront when when shown
[23:19] that there that there's the the
[23:21] realities of God, right? Shown the
[23:24] realities of God that they would make
[23:26] instead of worshiping God as God and
[23:28] submitting to God, they'll make a
[23:31] they'll fabricate something
[23:34] that's in the image of something of of
[23:36] the creation. Right? And I like where he
[23:38] says in the image of corruptible man,
[23:42] we might not worship 4-footed beasts and
[23:44] we might not worship birds and trees and
[23:46] whatever, but in this day and age, we
[23:49] sure do worship us some people,
[23:51] &gt;&gt; right? 90% of the time, it's the one
[23:54] that looks at you from the mirror,
[23:56] right? Most of the time, and if you keep
[23:58] reading, what does he do? Um,
[24:02] uh, that they would be turned under like
[24:05] under a a reprobate mind. And it goes
[24:08] down this list. Um,
[24:12] and even as they did not like to retain
[24:15] God in their knowledge, God gave them
[24:17] over to a reprobate mind to do those
[24:19] things which were not convenient, being
[24:20] filled with all unrighteousness,
[24:22] fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
[24:24] maliciousness, full of envy, murder,
[24:26] debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers,
[24:29] backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
[24:32] proud, boasters, inventors of evil
[24:34] things, disobedient to parents, without
[24:36] understanding, uh, covenant breakers,
[24:39] ers without natural affection,
[24:40] implacable and unmerciful.
[24:43] This is what God would turn people over
[24:46] to because they chose to worship things
[24:48] that look like themselves.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; Right? We we want to have our own way.
[24:56] We want to have look at, you know, we
[24:59] don't want to admit fault and say we're
[25:02] wrong. We don't, you know, we've been
[25:05] exposed by the word. And then instead of
[25:08] instead of saying I'm wrong, Lord,
[25:11] forgive me. I I've done wrong and let me
[25:13] change. We'll make an evasion, we'll
[25:15] make an excuse, we'll say, well, no,
[25:17] that there's I have some justification
[25:19] for some some reason. And when you do
[25:22] that, and you keep doing that over and
[25:24] over and over again, eventually
[25:27] you've built an idol to your own pride.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Right. You've built an idol out of your
[25:32] own pride.
[25:34] And God is not going to allow an altar,
[25:39] a an idol, idolatrous thing, an an idol
[25:43] worship, especially if you're one of his
[25:45] own,
[25:46] &gt;&gt; right? God God will tear down every
[25:49] idol. And so what does he do when people
[25:52] want to build an idol out of themselves?
[25:54] Then he'll turn them over to all these
[25:55] other things to desecrate that.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; He will tear it down. You want to be
[26:00] proud? Okay, fine. You will become
[26:03] awful, right? You will everything in
[26:06] your heart will be manifest and it will
[26:08] become awful, right? It will it will
[26:11] disintegrate and break down into um you
[26:15] know
[26:17] and just so many different things, any
[26:19] aspect you can think of, everything from
[26:20] murder all the way down to children
[26:22] disobeying parents, right? Which I mean,
[26:26] think of that. God put gossip and
[26:29] disobedience of parents into the same
[26:31] box as murder,
[26:33] &gt;&gt; right? This is because what it boils
[26:36] down to actually what it actually boils
[26:39] down to going back to Saul and David,
[26:41] what what Saul did from the outside
[26:43] perspective doesn't really even look all
[26:46] that bad. Especially when you get to the
[26:48] point where he said, "Well, we were
[26:49] going to sacrifice the animals, right?
[26:51] They were still going to die. He was
[26:53] still going to kill them. We're just
[26:54] going to kill them over here instead of
[26:55] over there." What's the big deal,
[26:57] Samuel? Right. From the outside
[27:00] perspective, the things that uh that
[27:03] Saul did, honestly, from our
[27:05] perspective, didn't look anywhere near
[27:06] as bad as what David had done. The
[27:08] difference was not what they did. The
[27:11] sin is practically irrelevant to God.
[27:13] All sin is worthy unto death. All of it.
[27:16] The difference is whether or not you're
[27:18] willing to repent
[27:19] &gt;&gt; because repentance is the first step of
[27:23] redemption. What time do I have here?
[27:28] Repentance is the first step of
[27:30] redemption.
[27:32] Uh very very briefly and I'll I'll
[27:34] button it up here. Um
[27:38] let me go to Acts
[27:42] chapter 2
[27:46] starting in verse 22. You men of Israel,
[27:49] hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a
[27:51] man approved of God
[27:54] among you by miracles and wonders and
[27:57] signs which God did by him in the midst
[28:00] of you, as ye yourselves also know. Him
[28:03] being delivered by determinate counsel
[28:05] and fornowledge of God, ye have taken
[28:08] and by wicked hands have crucified him.
[28:12] And then skipping down to verse 37. Now
[28:13] when they heard this, they were
[28:15] pricricked in their heart and said unto
[28:16] Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[28:18] men and brethren, what shall we do? Then
[28:21] Peter said unto him unto them, repent
[28:24] and be baptized every one of you in the
[28:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[28:27] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[28:29] the gift gift of the Holy Ghost. For the
[28:31] promises unto you, and to your children,
[28:34] and all that are a far off,
