[2:22] good morning everyone god bless you
[2:25] let's stand and
[2:26] pray and read our opening scripture
[2:30] heavenly father we come before you now
[2:32] lord and we're so thankful for your
[2:33] grace and mercy
[2:34] lord we know that as the scripture
[2:38] speaks to us that we
[2:40] should rejoice more and and glory more
[2:43] in our infirmities
[2:45] lord because when we're weak
[2:47] then you are strong and lord help us to
[2:52] always recognize our
[2:54] our own weakness and frailty and
[2:57] our desperate need
[2:58] for you
[3:00] lord so i ask that you'd come and that
[3:02] you would minister through your word to
[3:04] your people we ask in jesus name
[3:06] amen
[3:08] so i'm gonna start a
[3:10] a topic probably take two times maybe
[3:13] three
[3:14] um on pride and his prisoners
[3:19] i'm just going to read the scripture
[3:20] then you can sit down and be comfortable
[3:22] and i'll tell you the other details
[3:24] after this
[3:25] psalm 10 verse 2
[3:29] the wicked and his pride doth persecute
[3:32] the poor let them be taken in the
[3:34] devices
[3:35] that they have imagined may the lord
[3:37] have the blessing to the reading of his
[3:38] word you can be seated
[3:40] so
[3:41] the the title pride in his prisoners
[3:45] came to my mind from a
[3:47] book i don't know if you've ever heard
[3:48] of
[3:49] the lamplighter publishers but they
[3:52] they go to old books that were written
[3:54] in the 1700s i mean even back to the
[3:57] 1600s that are out of print that are
[4:00] just tremendous stories if you've never
[4:02] seen lamplighter and you like to read go
[4:04] find
[4:05] lamplighter and this particular book is
[4:07] excellent but there's a lot of excellent
[4:09] books that they do
[4:10] pride and as prisoners and i think
[4:12] that's
[4:13] a very
[4:14] appropriate way of speaking about it
[4:16] because
[4:18] a person that has pride in their life i
[4:20] mean we all have some level of pride
[4:24] but
[4:24] a person that has pride in their life
[4:27] becomes a captive
[4:29] to that pride and
[4:31] actually what what ends up happening is
[4:33] we
[4:34] we will worship that
[4:37] and serve that pride more than will
[4:39] serve
[4:40] god and surrender our lives to god
[4:44] and so it's it's such a grave
[4:48] danger
[4:50] for us as believers to
[4:52] fall captive to
[4:54] pride
[4:57] the word
[4:58] pride means
[5:00] inordinate self-esteem and unreasonable
[5:03] conceit of one's own superiority and
[5:05] talents
[5:07] beauty wealth accomplishments rank
[5:10] or elevation in office which manifests
[5:12] itself in lofty heirs distance
[5:15] reserve and often in contempt
[5:19] of others
[5:21] so
[5:21] that first scripture we read the wicked
[5:23] in his pride does persecute
[5:26] the poor pride
[5:28] will cause a person to
[5:30] take advantage of people that are weaker
[5:32] than you
[5:34] so i mean i think it's so amazing how
[5:36] the scripture gets to the very
[5:41] center of the issue and it reveals the
[5:43] secrets of the heart
[5:45] you see this i'm not i'm not talking
[5:47] about pride
[5:48] out there in the world
[5:50] we know that's there that's that's
[5:52] obvious if a person's not born again
[5:54] they'll never be in a condition
[5:57] to be able to humble themselves before
[5:59] god
[6:00] but the
[6:01] the thing i'm talking about here is
[6:03] pride amongst believers pride in the
[6:05] church you know there's three kinds of
[6:07] believers in every church there's
[6:09] there's three kinds of believers that
[6:11] are surrounding
[6:12] uh the body of christ if you look at the
[6:14] kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven
[6:16] is this it's a field and there's wheat
[6:19] and there's tares and there's wise and
[6:21] foolish virgin there's all these
[6:22] different
[6:23] layers and levels of things happening in
[6:26] this thing called the kingdom of heaven
[6:32] and
[6:32] so tares can come in amongst the wheat
[6:35] and so there can be pride and and
[6:38] you've you've seen that where
[6:40] uh someone with a a a false anointing
[6:45] false
[6:46] false ministry would come in and they
[6:48] have such
[6:50] a hold on pride has such
[6:52] taken them captive
[6:54] that this is what they're this is what
[6:55] they constantly are operating through
[6:57] and by
[6:59] and they might have a level of charisma
[7:01] and be able to control people but
[7:04] ultimately what their god is is pride
[7:10] j.c rile says this
[7:13] let us watch against pride in every
[7:14] shape
[7:15] pride of intellect pride of wealth
[7:18] pride of our own goodness
[7:19] nothing is so likely to keep a person
[7:21] out of heaven and prevent them from
[7:23] seeing seeing christ
[7:25] as pride
[7:26] so long as we think we are something we
[7:28] shall never be saved
[7:31] let us pray for and cultivate humility
[7:33] let us seek to know ourselves
[7:35] correctly and to find out our place
[7:37] in the sight of a holy god
[7:40] that should answer everything for us
[7:41] right there is
[7:44] when you see yourself
[7:46] through god's eyes i don't know if any
[7:48] of you pray that
[7:49] let me see this situation through your
[7:51] eyes lord not through my eyes
[7:53] not see how about seeing yourself
[7:57] i should i should pray that also let me
[7:59] see myself in your eyes and i think
[8:02] when you look
[8:04] i don't care
[8:05] who you are what maturity level you have
[8:08] pride can come
[8:09] up and
[8:11] eat you up
[8:12] and just hurt and damage you and damage
[8:15] people around you
[8:17] and so it's so
[8:18] critical that we
[8:20] guard against that
[8:24] pride in our own gifts spirit even
[8:27] spiritual gifts person can get worked up
[8:30] about themselves
[8:31] oh i have this gift i have this place no
[8:35] remember it's a gift
[8:37] it's not an innate ability that you have
[8:41] god has made it that way but it's all
[8:43] it's that it's actually a gift
[8:48] let's see
[8:49] next
[8:50] scripture
[8:52] yeah psalm 10 verse 4 the wicked
[8:55] through pride of his countenance
[8:58] will not seek after god
[9:00] god is not in all of his thoughts
[9:03] pride of his countenance pride of his
[9:05] countenance is
[9:07] what does that mean
[9:08] countenance
[9:09] well the word is
[9:11] actually either means his face or
[9:13] actually his nose so the pride of his
[9:16] nose
[9:18] it doesn't fit for
[9:20] our american dialect but
[9:22] what does it mean
[9:24] in other words a person can
[9:26] they have their appearance that they see
[9:29] of themself
[9:30] and so
[9:31] you know they wouldn't want to come to
[9:33] the altar
[9:34] crying and blowing snot bubbles because
[9:37] they're
[9:37] repenting before the lord
[9:39] they they want to be in a they want to
[9:41] be in a condition where everybody sees
[9:42] them
[9:43] prim proper and exactly fit the right
[9:47] way
[9:48] i'm strong i don't need anyone's help i
[9:51] don't need everyone's strength so what
[9:53] is what is what is their focus it's
[9:55] their outward appearance it's not
[9:58] their heart and god but it's an outward
[10:00] appearance this is a great
[10:03] danger this says will not seek after god
[10:05] god is not in all his thoughts well you
[10:07] think that's maybe an atheist right
[10:09] no
[10:10] it's not an atheist it's a religious
[10:12] person
[10:15] because they can they can they don't put
[10:18] god first doesn't mean god is not ever
[10:21] in their thoughts it means that in in
[10:24] the center of their thoughts god is not
[10:26] in the center is in the not in the midst
[10:28] he's not the purpose behind
[10:31] all of their thinking
[10:33] i remember jesus and i probably
[10:34] mentioned this the last four times i've
[10:37] preached but remember jesus
[10:39] talks about the motive of why you're
[10:41] doing something
[10:43] you he says if you're doing it to be
[10:45] seen by people
[10:47] you have real reward
[10:49] right
[10:50] because you did it to see people people
[10:52] saw you do it
[10:53] there you go that's your reward
[10:55] but we're not to be like the pharisees
[10:57] we're not to be like the gentiles we're
[11:00] to be like jesus christ
[11:02] and why do we what is our motive what is
[11:04] in our heart to please god to glorify
[11:06] god to see god move in people's lives
[11:09] and we do that in secret
[11:12] not wanting we don't care about being
[11:13] seen we don't care about getting
[11:15] recognition or someone patting us on the
[11:18] back
[11:18] we just care about god
[11:21] and god's people being helped and
[11:23] blessed that should be our heart and
[11:25] that should be our motive whether we're
[11:27] kicked to the side kicked to the curb
[11:30] people mistreat us
[11:32] i mean
[11:33] it doesn't get much more mistreatment
[11:35] than what jesus got
[11:38] and what did he do and in the in the
[11:40] very last thing
[11:42] when he was dying he said father forgive
[11:45] them he prayed for them
[11:47] and so let that be our hearts regardless
[11:50] of whether we have recognition regard
[11:51] regardless if anyone says
[11:53] hey you did a great job or said nothing
[11:57] it's not what we're doing it for
[11:59] we're doing it for his glory
[12:05] psalm
[12:06] 59
[12:07] verse 12 for the sin of their mouth
[12:10] and the words of their lips let them
[12:12] even be taken in their pride
[12:15] and for cursing
[12:17] and lying which they speak
[12:19] my goodness look at what end pride
[12:23] brings brings to you
[12:25] that's pride in the heart leads a person
[12:27] cursing and lying
[12:31] they'd rather lie
[12:33] and make and maintain the pride that
[12:35] they have in themselves
[12:37] then speak the truth just humble
[12:39] yourself
[12:43] confess
[12:44] i made a mistake i did this wrong
[12:46] whatever it was
[12:47] just be humble enough you don't have to
[12:49] have pride as your motive how i look as
[12:52] my motive
[12:54] how you look is not going to have any
[12:56] impact
[12:58] on god
[13:00] if that's what you're worried about if
[13:02] if your own
[13:04] value and other other people's eyes is
[13:07] what you're
[13:08] working for pushing for
[13:10] trying to get
[13:13] that's a stink in god's nostrils
[13:17] god god cares how you look right but he
[13:21] wants it to be from your heart
[13:24] if your heart is right
[13:26] then he'll take care of the rest because
[13:29] how we look that's our testimony but
[13:31] you're going to have no greater
[13:32] testimony
[13:33] many times
[13:35] i've
[13:36] i remember being at work and you tell
[13:37] your boss something and you immediately
[13:39] you're condemned because you told him
[13:40] half the truth
[13:42] and i've gone to him and i knew i was
[13:44] going to be in trouble and said
[13:47] i didn't exactly tell you the 100 truth
[13:49] i told you half the truth this is the
[13:50] case
[13:51] and i am so sorry i i didn't do that and
[13:53] i'm so sorry
[13:55] and you know what that actually elevated
[13:58] me higher
[13:59] in the person's sight just by humbling
[14:01] myself and say i was wrong i didn't tell
[14:03] the whole truth
[14:05] forgive me
[14:06] over and over again it caused them to
[14:08] see me as more honest than i really was
[14:12] and so lord help us just humble
[14:14] ourselves
[14:15] because it's part of our testimony part
[14:16] a huge part of our testimony
[14:20] all right
[14:22] psalm 73 verse 6 therefore
[14:26] pride can pass it them about as a chain
[14:29] violence covers them as a garment i mean
[14:31] you talk about pride
[14:33] that is prisoners
[14:35] pride compasses them what does compass
[14:38] mean surrounds them i mean you think
[14:40] about
[14:42] you're you're the one that's in the
[14:44] center and there's an army
[14:47] surrounding surrounding you you're all
[14:49] you're completely alone
[14:51] and what is that
[14:52] pride pride is surrounding you and what
[14:55] is that your freedom is gone right your
[14:58] freedom in christ is gone
[15:00] your ability to do anything
[15:03] for the lord is gone oh yeah you you
[15:05] might be doing something you might be
[15:08] going forward you might be in the
[15:09] appearance that you're doing something
[15:11] for god but you're not doing anything
[15:13] for god
[15:14] you're
[15:15] literally a captive
[15:17] to pride
[15:19] and that's
[15:20] what a danger
[15:21] what a danger because you can look just
[15:24] exactly like everybody else
[15:26] but the reality is that pro pride has
[15:29] you
[15:30] as a captive
[15:33] and then of course the next thing that
[15:35] happens is violence
[15:37] violence covers them as a garment so
[15:39] when pride takes you captive the next
[15:42] thing is violence it might not be
[15:44] violent violence of fists
[15:47] but violence of words
[15:49] violence of gossip violence of
[15:52] false accusations and so forth why
[15:55] because you are losing
[15:57] your position your appearance
[16:00] before everyone so you should go and
[16:02] destroy other people so because that
[16:05] brings you higher in your own head it
[16:07] brings you lower
[16:10] it destroys you
[16:11] you're ruining yourself that's
[16:13] you're captive
[16:15] you're captive
[16:22] when pride cometh
[16:24] then cometh shame
[16:27] but with the lowly
[16:29] is wisdom
[16:30] in god's eyes
[16:32] pride leads us to disgrace
[16:38] many times it doesn't lead us to
[16:39] disgrace in other people's eyes but for
[16:42] sure in god's eyes he says what a
[16:43] disgraceful creature
[16:46] what are you going after your own pride
[16:48] for
[16:49] you're living and walking in your own
[16:50] pride
[16:52] but with the lowly with the with the
[16:54] humble
[16:55] someone that keeps him he understands
[16:57] who he is in christ that doesn't
[16:59] humility doesn't mean you think you're
[17:01] nothing
[17:02] you you know who you are in christ
[17:04] but you realize your desperate constant
[17:07] continual
[17:09] need for him to cleanse your heart
[17:15] humility is
[17:16] wisdom why is it wisdom same the reason
[17:20] is the fear of the lord is the beginning
[17:21] of wisdom because you recognize truly
[17:24] your position and your desperate need
[17:26] for god
[17:31] proverbs 13 10 only by pride cometh
[17:33] contention
[17:35] but with the well advised
[17:37] is wisdom i love that
[17:40] so through pride fighting fighting
[17:43] happens
[17:44] fights in the church disagreements
[17:46] amongst amongst ourselves
[17:48] fussing with one another what does it
[17:51] start from
[17:52] pride pride of our own opinion
[17:54] pride of our i own our own ideas pride
[17:57] of how we think things
[17:59] should be done
[18:00] hey i'm guilty
[18:04] you know and
[18:05] and it
[18:07] it leads to fighting and fussing but
[18:10] with the well advised is is wisdom in
[18:13] other words
[18:14] you understand
[18:16] yourself
[18:17] you have people around you that say uh
[18:20] be careful
[18:22] watch what you're doing watch where
[18:23] you're going you're you're embracing and
[18:25] going after pride
[18:27] it's not the right way
[18:31] proverbs 14
[18:33] 3
[18:35] in the mouth of the foolish
[18:38] is a rod of pride but the lips of the
[18:40] wise shall preserve them
[18:44] so
[18:45] the mouth of the foolish
[18:48] is a rod
[18:50] of pride what is a rod used for for use
[18:54] for beating people right
[18:57] and so the rod of pride then is
[19:00] the mouth
[19:02] so
[19:03] how careful we need to be with our mouth
[19:06] many times
[19:08] we don't use our mouth the right way and
[19:10] what does it happen it shows that
[19:11] there's a rod of pride
[19:13] coming out of your mouth
[19:15] with jesus there's a sword coming out
[19:17] right
[19:18] a fiery sword that's coming out which is
[19:20] the word of god that discerns the
[19:22] thoughts and intents of the heart
[19:24] but with the foolish
[19:26] there's a rod coming out of their mouth
[19:29] beating people upside the head
[19:32] over and over again what a danger
[19:35] what a grave danger
[19:41] proverbs 16 18-19 very familiar verse
[19:45] often misquoted
[19:46] pride goeth before destruction
[19:49] and a haughty spirit before a fall
[19:53] better is to be of a humble spirit with
[19:55] the lowly than to divide the spoil
[19:59] with the proud it'd be better to lose
[20:03] and stay humble
[20:05] than it would be to win the battle
[20:07] and be so proud of yourself and your own
[20:09] accomplishments
[20:11] and be better off
[20:14] you'd be more pleasing to god to be a
[20:17] humble loser
[20:20] the the pro than a prideful
[20:22] winner
[20:24] you'd be better off to have no position
[20:27] in the church and just be humble
[20:29] than you would to be having a position
[20:31] and have
[20:32] a heart full of pride
[20:35] why because you lose you have a position
[20:38] but
[20:39] you lose you lose out on god's blessing
[20:44] and this is god's heart you know and
[20:46] we'll see this as we go forward in some
[20:48] of the scriptures through the
[20:50] through the prophets
[20:51] pride goes before destruction and a holy
[20:53] spirit before a fall
[20:55] you know this is this is one of those
[20:58] spiritual principles
[21:00] um
[21:01] many times it happens in this life but
[21:03] sometimes it doesn't happen to people in
[21:04] their life it happens right at the end
[21:06] of their life
[21:07] and it happens in the world to come
[21:10] because
[21:11] suffering torments
[21:13] sometimes the pride the proud they grow
[21:16] to
[21:17] ceos and the best positions the best
[21:19] places the highest positions in this
[21:22] world and in churches and in
[21:25] all kinds of places
[21:27] but ultimately
[21:29] destruction is following them
[21:32] destruction of
[21:34] their homes their families their lives
[21:36] now i'm not saying that they lose their
[21:37] money they lose their position they
[21:39] might they might not
[21:42] but ultimately is what's happening
[21:43] around them is
[21:46] destruction their family is destroyed
[21:48] their lives are destroyed people around
[21:50] them destroyed that's why you see over
[21:52] and over again
[21:54] rich billionaires and highly successful
[21:57] millionaire pastors
[21:59] or they're divorced and remarried why
[22:01] because destruction is
[22:03] going before them wherever they go
[22:07] all right
[22:08] isaiah 23
[22:10] 29 oh
[22:13] did i double up i doubled up no i didn't
[22:16] a man's pride shall bring him low but
[22:18] honor shall uphold the humble in spirit
[22:22] again the way brother branham says the
[22:25] way up is down
[22:27] the way down
[22:29] is up
[22:31] if if you want to go up then like
[22:33] brother branham talks about that
[22:34] preacher he went up to the pulpit
[22:36] all proud proud of himself and
[22:38] he went down and he was
[22:40] humiliated
[22:42] but
[22:43] the true heart is to go up and say lord
[22:45] i
[22:46] i can't help these people
[22:48] i don't have any i don't have anything
[22:50] special
[22:51] in myself it's just your word and it's
[22:53] your spirit that can help them
[22:55] just
[22:56] use me
[22:58] use me to help help and be a blessing
[23:00] and be a strengthening
[23:02] to them
[23:04] honor shall uphold the humble in spirit
[23:07] someone who has a humble spirit
[23:09] in god's eyes is honored and in the in
[23:13] the eyes of true
[23:15] holy ghost filled believers will also be
[23:18] honored and that will be your great
[23:20] testimony
[23:22] humility
[23:23] is actually the if you think about it
[23:26] deeply it's the root of all
[23:29] godly virtues
[23:31] without humility
[23:32] all virtues that you might have in your
[23:34] life are corrupted when there's pride
[23:37] you know love joy peace patience
[23:39] kindness goodness
[23:40] gentleness self-control you might have a
[23:43] modicum of that but pride will come
[23:44] through
[23:45] and corrupt that
[23:47] you know ruin the ruin that be like a
[23:51] disease to ruin the apples you got
[23:53] apples on your tree
[23:54] bearing fruit
[23:56] absolutely
[23:57] but man they sure ain't worth eating
[24:00] they're rotten
[24:04] and so
[24:06] we don't want that we want humility to
[24:08] be at the root and to be that sap that
[24:11] comes in and have a beautiful shining
[24:14] glorious apple that tastes so delicious
[24:17] in god's sight that's what we want to be
[24:20] but it starts with that humility
[24:24] all right
[24:26] here we go isaiah 23 9 the lord of hosts
[24:28] has purposed it
[24:30] to stain the pride of all glory
[24:33] and to bring into contempt all the
[24:35] honorable of the earth my goodness
[24:37] what a statement
[24:40] the lord of hosts has purposed this god
[24:43] has counseled with his own self you know
[24:46] the scripture in ephesians chapter one
[24:48] he's counseled with himself
[24:51] and he has set forth this decision
[24:55] i'm going to stain the pride of all
[24:57] glory
[24:59] let's let's stay far away from pride
[25:03] you better you better search your heart
[25:06] i better search my heart
[25:08] it's not something to go along in our
[25:10] lives and just
[25:11] whistle through the graveyard
[25:13] thinking everything's all right and i'm
[25:15] all right
[25:16] are you staining are you going to be
[25:18] are you going to be stained
[25:20] or is god going to polish you
[25:22] with humility god's going to polish you
[25:25] and let you shine
[25:26] but here god says i'm going to stain you
[25:31] and really when you look at it what is
[25:33] he going to he's going to stain you with
[25:34] blood
[25:36] that's that's a harsh thing to say but
[25:38] as we go along in the scriptures you'll
[25:39] see it
[25:40] to stain the pride of all glory and to
[25:43] bring
[25:44] into contempt
[25:46] all the honorable all the proud
[25:49] people on the earth that are honorable
[25:51] in the earth's eyes
[25:54] isaiah 25 11 he shall spread forth his
[25:56] hands in the midst of them as he swimeth
[25:59] spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he
[26:02] shall bring down their pride together
[26:04] with the spoils
[26:05] of their hands again this is god's heart
[26:08] towards pride and you'll see it over and
[26:10] over again i'm going to skip that one
[26:13] jeremiah 49 16 thy terribleness hath
[26:15] deceived thee in the pride of thine
[26:17] heart oh thou that dwelleth in the
[26:19] clefts of the rock that hold us the
[26:21] height of the hill though thou shouldest
[26:23] make thy nest as high as the eagle i
[26:25] will bring thee down from thence saith
[26:27] the lord you see rich people making all
[26:29] kinds of hiding places and
[26:32] plans if society falls apart and god
[26:34] says you can hide yourself wherever you
[26:36] want to
[26:37] i'm going to find you and i'm going to
[26:39] destroy you
[26:40] so
[26:41] i don't want to be in that position
[26:43] where god is becoming a mighty mighty
[26:45] hunter
[26:46] to find me
[26:47] so he can thrust me through with his
[26:50] sword
[26:51] that's god's attitude and heart towards
[26:54] pride
[26:56] skip that
[26:57] um
[27:00] let me go back mark 7 20 through 23 and
[27:04] he said that which cometh out of the man
[27:06] that defiles the man
[27:08] for from within
[27:10] out of the heart of men precede evil
[27:13] thoughts
[27:14] adulteries fornications murders
[27:17] thefts covetousness wickedness deceit
[27:20] lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy
[27:23] pride
[27:24] foolishness all these evil things
[27:28] come from within and defile
[27:30] the man
[27:31] pride of heart
[27:33] pride of heart will defile you
[27:37] because it comes out of your heart and
[27:39] defiles you not the food that you not
[27:41] eating a little bit of pulled pork
[27:43] that's not gonna that's not gonna defile
[27:46] you
[27:47] right because that comes from the
[27:48] outside comes in and goes into the
[27:50] drought as jesus said
[27:52] right but
[27:54] it's what's from the inside it's good
[27:56] though brother joe
[28:00] yeah so it's what comes from the heart
[28:03] that actually
[28:04] defiles a man
[28:07] all right
[28:12] first timothy 3 6 he must not be a
[28:14] recent convert or maybe come puffed up
[28:17] with conceit and fall into the
[28:19] condemnation of the devil
[28:21] i'm not looking necessarily at the
[28:23] surrounding context of that
[28:25] regarding deacons and and
[28:28] overseers but more so looking at that
[28:32] becoming puffed up with conceit
[28:35] it'd be better like i said before it'd
[28:36] be better just to take take a humble
[28:39] lowly place take the lowest seat right
[28:42] that's what jesus said to do take the
[28:43] lowest seat
[28:45] then to become
[28:46] puffed up conceited over what position
[28:50] or place you have
[28:52] first john 2 16 for all that is in the
[28:55] world the desires of the flesh and the
[28:56] desires of the eye
[28:58] and pride of life is not from the father
[29:01] but is from the world
[29:03] the pro that pride
[29:06] is not it's not of god
[29:08] it's not of god it's not the nature of
[29:10] god
[29:11] god is against it god hates
[29:14] that pride
[29:16] psalm 12 3 the lord shall cut off all
[29:18] flattering lips and the tongue
[29:20] that speaks proud things i mean
[29:24] think about what that means for a second
[29:27] god's going to cut off all flattering
[29:30] lips and
[29:31] that's brutal
[29:32] that's a brutal statement
[29:35] but it's the truth
[29:36] god will cut off everyone that acts with
[29:40] with pride
[29:42] psalm 94 2 lift up thyself thou judge of
[29:44] the earth render a reward to the proud
[29:49] proverbs 16 5 everyone that is proud and
[29:51] heart is an abomination to the lord
[29:53] though hand joyed in hand he shall not
[29:55] be unpunished though people agree
[29:57] together to operate in their pride
[30:00] a pride in unity
[30:03] god says it's an abomination
[30:05] makes him sick he hates it
[30:09] james 4 6 but he giveth more grace
[30:12] wherefore he saith god resists the proud
[30:16] but gives grace unto the humble
[30:21] god actually
[30:23] if you look at this verse
[30:25] he sets himself in battle array
[30:29] he girds his sword
[30:31] that's what he's that's what it's
[30:32] talking about when he says resist
[30:34] we think resist is like the proud is
[30:36] pushing back and god is just like i'm
[30:38] trying to push against this guy's pride
[30:40] that's not what it's saying he's saying
[30:42] god actually sets himself in battle
[30:46] against
[30:47] the proud he looks at the crowd and says
[30:50] i'm taking out my sword
[30:52] and i'm going to fight how would you
[30:54] like do we want to be in that position
[30:56] do we want to have pride in our heart
[30:59] again the problem with pride is
[31:02] pride put you know they put blinders on
[31:04] a horse
[31:05] that's pride on a christian you can't
[31:07] see it
[31:09] you think you're humble enough i think
[31:11] that's i one of my quotes that we put in
[31:14] later there's no
[31:15] better proof
[31:17] that you're
[31:19] bound by pride than to think i'm humble
[31:22] enough
[31:25] amen
[31:26] this is god's heart this is the heart of
[31:29] the matter
[31:30] when you're living
[31:32] with pride when you're operating by
[31:34] pride when you're making decisions by
[31:36] pride when you deal with others
[31:39] with pride
[31:40] god is not your friend
[31:44] you still be a christian you're saved
[31:46] but in your operation of your life
[31:49] you're in a position where god is going
[31:51] to
[31:52] come against you and resist you and if
[31:54] you're predestinated seed god will break
[31:56] you down
[31:59] god will not stop at any length
[32:02] to break you down that's your health
[32:05] your body your mind
[32:07] whatever it might be god's gonna you
[32:09] might lose everything
[32:12] you might lose everything but god is
[32:14] going to have you humble
[32:15] if you're not predestinated seed you're
[32:17] just going to go on you say don't matter
[32:19] i'm humble enough
[32:22] you're never humble enough
[32:25] in god's eyes i don't know why this is
[32:26] on my mind i've really got to close but
[32:29] this statement and i probably have said
[32:31] this before
[32:32] but this statement you know i feel like
[32:35] i'm just not enough
[32:37] i hate that so much
[32:39] i feel like pride is that self-pride
[32:42] is at its center of that you are not
[32:45] enough i just set the record straight
[32:46] you're not enough you'll never be enough
[32:49] that's not that's why jesus came
[32:52] that's why we're christians that's why
[32:54] god changed our life is because you're
[32:56] not enough and you never will be enough
[32:58] but jesus christ is enough
[33:01] let's humble ourselves
