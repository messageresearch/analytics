[4:57] morning this is just daniel 12 and um
[5:00] we're going to take this over the next
[5:02] few sunday schools let's begin here
[5:04] today
[5:05] verse 1 at that time shall michael stand
[5:07] up the great prince which standeth for
[5:09] the children of thy people and there
[5:11] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[5:14] was since there was a nation even to
[5:17] that same time
[5:18] and at that time thy people shall be
[5:20] delivered
[5:22] every one that shall be found written in
[5:24] the book
[5:25] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[5:27] of the earth shall awake
[5:29] some to everlasting life some to shame
[5:32] and everlasting contempt
[5:34] and they that be wise
[5:36] shall shine as the brightness of the
[5:38] firmament
[5:39] and they that turn many to righteous the
[5:42] stars forever and ever
[5:44] but thou o daniel
[5:46] shut up the words and seal the book
[5:48] even to the time of the end
[5:51] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[5:54] shall be increased
[5:56] then i daniel looked and behold there
[5:58] stood
[5:59] other two the one on this side of the
[6:01] bank of the river
[6:02] and the other on that side of the bank
[6:04] of the river
[6:06] and one said to the man clothed in linen
[6:09] which was upon the waters of the river
[6:11] how long shall it be to the end of these
[6:13] wonders
[6:15] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[6:17] which was upon the waters of the river
[6:20] which he held up his right hand and his
[6:22] left hand unto heaven and swore by him
[6:24] that liveth forever that it shall be for
[6:26] a time
[6:27] times
[6:28] and a half
[6:29] and when he shall have accomplished to
[6:31] scatter the power of the holy people all
[6:34] these things shall be finished
[6:37] and i heard but i understood not then
[6:39] said i o my lord what shall be the end
[6:42] of these things and he said go thy way
[6:45] daniel for the words are closed up and
[6:48] sealed
[6:49] till the time
[6:51] of the end
[6:53] let's keep reading
[6:54] many shall be purified
[6:57] and made white and tried
[7:00] but the wicked shall do wickedly
[7:02] and none of the wicked shall understand
[7:04] but the wise
[7:06] shall understand
[7:08] and from the time that the daily
[7:10] sacrifice shall be taken away
[7:13] and the abomination that maketh desolate
[7:15] set up
[7:16] there shall be a thousand two hundred
[7:18] and ninety days
[7:20] blessed is he that wadeth and cometh to
[7:23] the thousand
[7:24] three hundred and five and thirty days
[7:27] but go thy way till the end be
[7:29] for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot
[7:33] at the end of days you can be seated
[7:38] you could just have that power point for
[7:40] me if you could i just want to read from
[7:41] it and brother brad i'm speaking here in
[7:43] the beginning and ending of the gentile
[7:46] dispensation and listen to what he says
[7:49] right here he says now at this time at
[7:51] that time the 12th chapter
[7:54] and at that time shall michael stand up
[7:56] the great prince that standeth for the
[7:58] children of thy people and there shall
[8:00] be a time of trouble such was never
[8:03] since there was a nation even to that
[8:06] time and at that time thy people shall
[8:08] be delivered every one that shall be
[8:10] found written in the book oh my listen
[8:13] to what brother branham says here aren't
[8:15] you glad your name is on his book
[8:18] daniel over here saw him come to the
[8:20] ancient of days whose hair was as white
[8:22] as wool
[8:24] and he opened up the books and they were
[8:25] judged every man out of the books the
[8:28] great white throne judgment
[8:30] now daniel is given the assurance that
[8:32] at the end of the gentile dispensation
[8:35] when you go home tomorrow read the 11th
[8:38] chapter i want to pause right there
[8:40] underline this when i read this
[8:42] i want you as your homework to this
[8:45] class
[8:46] to go read the book of daniel and
[8:49] specifically chapter 11
[8:51] on all the way through the end of the
[8:53] book of daniel we're going to be
[8:55] covering a lot of it here
[8:57] let's just pick up brother branham says
[8:58] you can see how the king of the north is
[9:00] coming down which is nothing else but
[9:03] russia
[9:05] coming down to press against it like a
[9:07] whirlwind now brother branham uses that
[9:09] word like a whirlwind because if you
[9:12] read daniel chapter 11 that's exactly
[9:15] what he's referred to as the king of the
[9:17] north will come
[9:18] like a whirlwind
[9:20] and the great battle of armageddon will
[9:22] be fought right there near the gates of
[9:26] jerusalem
[9:27] there's been a lot of interest in people
[9:30] questioning and asking about russia and
[9:31] ukraine and the war that's happening
[9:33] right now
[9:34] and immediately when things like this
[9:36] happen our mind as believers go straight
[9:38] to the prophet and what did what did
[9:40] brother adam say about this and so
[9:42] there's a lot that he did say and i
[9:44] think there could be a
[9:46] sometimes a lot of misunderstanding and
[9:48] a lot of confusion well didn't brother
[9:49] branham you hear this statement a lot
[9:51] well didn't brother branham say
[9:52] something about that over here and you
[9:54] know it's funny you never really chase
[9:56] those things down and find out what did
[9:58] he say so you just sort of stay in
[10:00] wonderment and wonder what exactly did
[10:02] he say well i'd encourage you go back
[10:04] and find out what he said
[10:06] because there's some very specific
[10:08] things that brother branham said about
[10:09] and you were not
[10:10] we you're you
[10:12] there's nothing that the lord desires
[10:13] greater than to give you clarity where
[10:15] there's confusion on any matter whatever
[10:18] it is the lord wants to
[10:19] because we have an answer and i'm so
[10:21] glad that we do we have an answer
[10:23] specific answer
[10:24] and so i don't want to really get bogged
[10:26] down in that uh this morning but i just
[10:28] want to say that uh the there is a
[10:32] context in which you talk about russia
[10:34] there is a context in which you type
[10:37] in which you correlate that with the
[10:39] king of the north in the book of daniel
[10:42] but there's no scripture
[10:45] that speaks of ukraine and russia going
[10:47] to war now there's a lot of things you
[10:49] see in in highlights and maybe setting
[10:51] the stage for certain things um
[10:55] even someone forwarded uh
[10:58] someone's forwarded that i didn't know
[11:00] if i could uh i don't think i had it
[11:02] written in my notes but someone had
[11:04] forwarded a video yep someone had
[11:06] forwarded a video of
[11:07] of biden um in poland as he just went
[11:11] there u.s president uh there went to
[11:13] poland and if you watch his speech he
[11:16] begins
[11:17] his speech
[11:18] uh with the words be not afraid
[11:21] and he's quoting from pope john paul
[11:25] now here's a u.s president quoting from
[11:28] a pope i i'll share you the um the first
[11:32] pope of poland i should say in 1978
[11:36] and i could i could forge that video if
[11:38] you want to see it it's pretty
[11:39] incredible an american president using
[11:41] the words quoting the words of a pope
[11:45] in poland
[11:47] and you look at the beast power
[11:49] that's raising up and really what as we
[11:52] heard over the last uh maybe two sundays
[11:54] ago what putin is finding out is that
[11:56] you can't make war with the beast
[11:58] that's what the bible says who could
[12:00] make war with him
[12:01] and so a lot of these things you don't
[12:03] you you want to go home and actually
[12:05] read and and and so i encourage you to
[12:08] go back and read the book of daniel from
[12:10] 11 on and you're going to find out why i
[12:12] picked that chapter and on here in a
[12:14] minute
[12:15] notice let's follow along here he says
[12:17] coming down to let's go back back to the
[12:19] slide there coming down to press against
[12:21] it like a whirlwind and the great battle
[12:23] of armageddon
[12:25] will be fought right there near the
[12:27] gates of jerusalem
[12:29] notice oh i love this and at that time
[12:32] they thy people shall be delivered every
[12:34] one that's been found written in the
[12:36] book
[12:37] the lamb's book of life michael the
[12:39] great prince
[12:41] shall stand up for what for thy people
[12:44] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[12:46] of the earth shall awake win when these
[12:48] times take place
[12:50] some to everlasting life some to shame
[12:53] and everlasting contempt and he ends
[12:55] with verse 40 and at that time of the
[12:58] end shall the king of the south push at
[13:00] him and the king of the north shall come
[13:01] against him like a whirlwind with
[13:03] chariots with horsemen and with many
[13:05] ships and he shall enter into the
[13:07] countries
[13:08] and shall pass over so you this amazing
[13:12] book of daniel is filled with stories
[13:14] that you know very familiar daniel in
[13:17] the lion's den it has shadrach meshach
[13:19] and abednego
[13:20] belshazzar's feast and and all of these
[13:23] stories that uh you know you hear the
[13:25] the writing the handwriting on the wall
[13:27] many men will take many many take a you
[13:29] farce and all of the stories that you
[13:31] hear from sunday school but then you
[13:34] move after chapter 10 and you have all
[13:37] the stories of the life of daniel daniel
[13:39] from captivity
[13:41] because the book of of daniel covers
[13:44] about 75 years of daniel's life about 75
[13:49] years of it
[13:50] what's incredible is though it covers 75
[13:53] years of daniel's life it actually
[13:55] covers thousands of years of human
[13:58] history
[14:00] because there's two types of history
[14:02] did you know that there's two types of
[14:04] history
[14:05] there's that which is past
[14:08] that's already taken place
[14:10] and then there's that which is future
[14:12] you say brother matt future history yep
[14:15] it's called prophecy
[14:17] because prophecy is future history
[14:20] in other words in the mind of god it's
[14:23] already taken place
[14:24] and there's a prophet who's already seen
[14:26] it and has already spoken of it and it's
[14:30] historic in the mind of god
[14:32] do you realize that friends that
[14:33] everything that's going to happen in
[14:35] your lifetime and in after your lifetime
[14:39] if there's an after your lifetime has
[14:41] already taken place in the mind of god
[14:43] it's all just a drama
[14:45] taking place
[14:46] and it's all of uh it's up to us to find
[14:48] our place in that drama
[14:52] and so he covers he covers 75 years of
[14:54] daniel's life
[14:56] because the but what you have it all the
[14:58] way from chapter 1 to chapter 10 is is
[15:00] daniel's life and daniel coming through
[15:03] and you have all the stories of daniel
[15:05] but then in chapter 11 it changes to
[15:08] prophecy and that's why when you read
[15:09] here in daniel 12 and we're reading the
[15:11] 11 and you're hearing things about the
[15:13] end time you're hearing about armageddon
[15:15] you're hearing about the king of the
[15:17] north and the great white throne
[15:18] judgment and those that raised to shame
[15:20] and those that raised to life what you
[15:22] find is is that daniel's saying i don't
[15:24] understand i don't have understanding
[15:26] then god says seal it up daniel for it's
[15:28] not not it's not at this time you're
[15:30] going to lay in peace you'll lay in your
[15:32] lot you're going to die
[15:33] you want to see it but it's not for you
[15:35] right now but god was going to speak
[15:38] through this prophet and he was going to
[15:40] prophesy about things that have happened
[15:43] since daniel has went off the scene
[15:46] and since you've been born
[15:49] it's pretty incredible really when you
[15:50] think about it
[15:52] how
[15:52] relevant it is to your life so as we
[15:55] said
[15:56] god can tell uh the future as god looks
[16:00] at the future as history that's why the
[16:01] bible says the lamb that was slain
[16:03] before the foundation of the world and
[16:06] so daniel sees into this future he sees
[16:10] way beyond his life he doesn't
[16:12] understand
[16:14] how far beyond his life this is going to
[16:17] happen
[16:18] but he he sees it he has no idea he sees
[16:21] it past his life
[16:23] he actually sees past
[16:25] your life
[16:27] and he sees all the way over into the
[16:29] end of all things the climax the
[16:32] finality of everything the finality of
[16:34] all time
[16:37] and so
[16:38] i just want to skip through some of
[16:39] these notes to make sure we cover
[16:42] um
[16:43] so what you'll find is is that in daniel
[16:45] chapter 11
[16:46] especially with chapter 11 we read
[16:48] chapter 12. but you're going to have
[16:51] vivid
[16:52] vivid specific i love god the way that
[16:55] god writes this in the book of daniel
[16:57] the way he writes prophecy is so
[16:59] specific
[17:01] it's not generic
[17:02] there's no there's no room for
[17:04] miscalculation of dates there's no room
[17:07] for well he could've and and it's so
[17:09] funny to me i was watching a um a
[17:11] pentecostal uh word of prophecy so i
[17:14] posted up on facebook somehow a feed of
[17:16] of a man who was uh uh pro something
[17:18] something something prophetic ministries
[17:20] and he's in a church and he's discerning
[17:23] uh the people and he's got it on his own
[17:25] facebook and his own feed and he's he's
[17:27] in this church and he's saying you there
[17:29] you're he says you there in the back
[17:31] right there sir what's your name sir and
[17:33] the man gives him his name and he says
[17:34] what's the woman beside you and then he
[17:36] starts going over these uh uh you've
[17:39] been through some trouble and some hard
[17:41] times and and and i'm thinking
[17:43] haven't we all been through some trouble
[17:45] in some hard times
[17:47] and then he asks them their name and and
[17:50] and who what's your name and and where
[17:52] and where are you from and you're not
[17:54] now it's amazing because in my mind i'm
[17:56] contrasting this to a real true gift of
[17:58] a prophet who doesn't ask anyone their
[18:00] name he tells them their name doesn't
[18:02] ask them where they're from he tells
[18:03] them what street they're on what address
[18:05] they're on gives them an address two
[18:07] addresses gives them one address and a
[18:09] sister comes back to the woman
[18:11] afterwards says sister you don't live
[18:13] there she says you you've she he she
[18:15] says well sister she says i've moved
[18:17] from that address that was that was you
[18:19] remember the story that the brother
[18:20] branham tells of the woman and she says
[18:22] i had moved from there yesterday from
[18:23] that she says you don't live there
[18:25] brother branham gives her the address of
[18:26] her new home and the sister didn't even
[18:28] know she had moved he says actually move
[18:30] that is my address
[18:32] and it's amazing because god doesn't do
[18:33] anything generic it's very specific
[18:37] unquestionable and so daniel is vivid
[18:40] detailed prophecy about 200 over
[18:43] over roundabout depending on what how
[18:46] you how you uh categorize it there's
[18:48] about 200
[18:50] specific details in the book of daniel
[18:54] chapter 11
[18:56] all everything of those 200 specific
[18:59] details don't happen in daniel's
[19:01] lifetime they happen centuries later
[19:05] and they happen exactly as daniel said
[19:08] they would happen
[19:10] you say brother matt what does that mean
[19:11] it means that it wasn't a book written
[19:14] by man
[19:15] it was inspired of god beforehand right
[19:20] for i am god and there is none other i
[19:21] am god he says in isaiah there's none
[19:23] like me declaring the end from the
[19:25] beginning and from ancient times things
[19:28] that are not yet done so it's amazing
[19:30] because you you go through some of these
[19:33] and i just want to cover some facts of
[19:34] these because you could almost and i
[19:36] know we've taught on this before but i'm
[19:38] teaching specifically on chapter 11 and
[19:40] chapter 12
[19:41] daniel could be cut into two halves
[19:44] so the first half of daniel daniel 1
[19:46] through 10 is all about miracles and
[19:49] things that took place in daniel's
[19:51] lifetime and then chapter 11 on
[19:54] uh is all a book about prophecy and so
[19:58] the first six chapters uh you you you
[20:01] understand all from sunday's school the
[20:02] life of daniel the lion's den the
[20:04] shadrach meshech and the bendigo daniel
[20:06] being caught up in the court of darius
[20:08] and all of those things that you can
[20:10] read about but then you go from chapter
[20:12] six
[20:13] and then chapter seven
[20:15] all the way to chapter 12
[20:17] um are things that maybe you probably
[20:19] haven't heard of before you haven't read
[20:21] because you don't read those parts of
[20:22] the bible you read the good stories
[20:24] about the lion's den and the shadrach
[20:26] meshach and abednego then you get to
[20:28] those parts and it's like whoa wait
[20:29] what's he talking about hold on a minute
[20:31] let me just stop you and say
[20:33] when you get to that moment pull out
[20:35] your table app and i've done this to the
[20:37] men's breakfast go to the exact search
[20:40] and search some of those things that
[20:42] you're reading you'll be amazed
[20:45] at how much is there that brother
[20:46] branham gave
[20:48] understanding on those things that you
[20:50] don't understand
[20:52] i believe we should have a desire to
[20:54] understand those things
[20:57] right
[20:58] and so
[21:00] he says in se i just want to make sure i
[21:02] cover uh the portion here i want to get
[21:05] to
[21:05] um
[21:09] yes
[21:10] first half one through six second half
[21:12] set i want to make sure i had that right
[21:14] seven through
[21:15] and so
[21:16] what's incredible about
[21:19] this book
[21:20] is the first half
[21:22] of daniel this is amazing
[21:25] the first chapter i should say because
[21:27] you have the first half the book of
[21:29] daniel we did this last time we talked
[21:30] on this and i took the book of daniel
[21:32] and held it in two halves
[21:34] the first half of daniel chapter one
[21:36] through chapter six
[21:38] and then the second half chapter seven
[21:39] through chapter twelve as something
[21:41] pretty incredible
[21:43] the first half
[21:45] the first chapter sorry
[21:48] of the first half
[21:49] is written in hebrew
[21:52] the language of hebrew
[21:54] but the next five chapters are written
[21:57] in aramaic
[21:59] you follow that yeah
[22:01] so the first chapter
[22:03] in daniel
[22:04] is written in hebrew the next five two
[22:07] three four five are written in aramaic
[22:09] now aramaic is the official language of
[22:12] that time it was the common language it
[22:14] was used everywhere in the ancient world
[22:17] the first chapter
[22:19] of the second half
[22:21] right so after chapter five of the
[22:24] second half
[22:25] is written in aramaic the next chap but
[22:28] the next five chapters are written in
[22:30] hebrew again it's amazing they've
[22:32] changed the language the language is
[22:33] written originally in hebrew and in
[22:35] aramaic and so it tells you what you say
[22:38] why is that significant it tells you
[22:42] where the book was supposed to be read
[22:44] who it was intended you write something
[22:47] and the writer has an audience in mind
[22:49] he has someone he's going he's planning
[22:51] on reading
[22:52] this portion of the book so it tells you
[22:54] where the chapters were meant to be read
[22:57] and who those chapters
[22:59] were directed towards so you can tell
[23:01] which parts were meant to be read
[23:04] widely amongst everybody and anybody can
[23:07] read it and anybody could understand it
[23:10] but then there were certain parts of
[23:12] daniel
[23:13] that were written in a different
[23:16] language
[23:17] so that only
[23:19] hebrews
[23:20] could understand
[23:22] and could read
[23:25] i hope you followed that
[23:27] some of daniel is written for everybody
[23:30] to read and understand
[23:32] then there's certain parts
[23:33] only you understand
[23:36] there's certain parts of the bible that
[23:39] are written for the whole world to
[23:42] understand
[23:43] in fact the whole bible at a certain
[23:45] level but i want you to understand that
[23:48] to his bride there are certain parts
[23:51] that is meant for you to understand
[23:54] and everybody else may read it and go ah
[23:57] don't really see anything there but to
[23:59] you
[24:00] it means everything
[24:03] and so so don't don't criticize someone
[24:06] who can't see what you see
[24:08] because maybe they don't understand that
[24:10] language because they weren't meant to
[24:12] understand that language
[24:14] you say brother matt this is very
[24:15] similar what jesus said when he said
[24:18] jesus lord master why do you speak in
[24:20] parables very simple answer
[24:23] because to you it is given to understand
[24:25] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[24:27] to them
[24:28] it's not given
[24:30] blessed are your eyes for they see
[24:32] blessed are your ears for they hear
[24:35] so even in daniel there are portions
[24:38] that were written to the common everyday
[24:41] language where everybody in the world
[24:42] could understand
[24:44] and then there were certain portions
[24:46] that were written only for god's family
[24:49] to be able to understand because god
[24:52] hides himself
[24:54] from the wise and the prudent
[24:56] and he reveals himself unto babes
[24:59] and i believe that if anything any
[25:01] attitude we could always have and keep
[25:03] and maintain before god is never a
[25:06] know-it-all i know everything i can't be
[25:08] taught anything but keep a teachable
[25:10] spirit before the lord because that's
[25:12] the spirit of a babe such as would learn
[25:15] this never brother branham said don't
[25:16] ever put a period put a comma there let
[25:19] god open himself up more to you can you
[25:21] say amen to that
[25:23] and so
[25:25] you go beyond this and all the way
[25:26] through chapter 12. what's amazing is
[25:28] that he's going to go
[25:30] he's going to go and i'm going to
[25:32] skip some of this details through
[25:34] chapter 1 through chapter 5.
[25:35] chapter 11 is going to include details
[25:38] about empires
[25:40] kingdoms
[25:41] uh it's going to talk about different
[25:43] developments in the political sphere and
[25:45] end time powers that would affect the
[25:48] jews and the jewish people and so the
[25:51] the the through chapter 10 i'm just
[25:53] going to read this from verse 1 of
[25:54] chapter 10. in the third year of cyrus
[25:56] the message in the third year of cyrus
[25:58] king of persia message was revealed to
[26:00] daniel whose name was called bell to
[26:03] chazar
[26:04] the message was true but the appointed
[26:07] time was long and he understood the
[26:09] message at ha and had understanding
[26:13] of the vision so you go through chapter
[26:15] one it's all about the deportation uh of
[26:19] of of of the jews to babylon the royal
[26:22] court of babylon and daniel's one of
[26:24] those hebrew boys that were deported off
[26:27] of the land into babylon and they're all
[26:29] given babylonian names daniel's given a
[26:32] babylonian name uh misha is given a
[26:34] babylonian azariah is given a babylonian
[26:36] name uh michiel those are shadrach
[26:39] meshach and abednego that wasn't their
[26:40] real names that was babylonian names
[26:43] that the king had given them and so
[26:45] daniel you go through chapter two and
[26:47] then you have this dream of this great
[26:50] giant statue of a man and nebuchadnezzar
[26:54] calls all of his prophets into the room
[26:55] and says can you tell me the meaning of
[26:58] this dream and he calls all the wise men
[27:00] to give me the interpretation and they
[27:02] couldn't and so now you find daniel in
[27:04] chapter 2 coming along to give the
[27:06] interpretation of this great stature and
[27:09] it's this great giant and as you notice
[27:12] all the way and i don't have the the
[27:14] slide that we had before but you've seen
[27:16] the slide of the picture and you go down
[27:18] all the way down this great giant
[27:20] stature and you'll notice the quality of
[27:22] materials go down all the way from gold
[27:25] to silver to iron and then in the feet
[27:27] it's mixed in with iron and clay and we
[27:30] know that all of those different
[27:31] materials represent a different empire
[27:34] whether it was the greeks and then it
[27:36] goes moves on down to the iron which was
[27:38] rome and then it moves into the clay
[27:41] mixed with iron and so
[27:43] that nebuchadnezzar daniel gives him the
[27:45] interpretation to nebuchadnezzar of this
[27:47] dream that this entire figure that
[27:50] you've had in your dream of this great
[27:52] stature and the different uh the
[27:54] different materials of this great
[27:57] stature daniel's interpretation was king
[28:00] this is speaking of empires that will
[28:03] outlive you
[28:04] much greater than you
[28:06] well this dream that you've had this
[28:08] whole entire figure is the unveiling of
[28:10] future empires that will replace babylon
[28:16] and so babylon will be replaced by the
[28:18] medes and the persians and then under
[28:20] cyrus and darius and then that happened
[28:23] uh but they were they were never in the
[28:25] great in the in the grandeur and the
[28:27] splendor of babylon then they would be
[28:29] followed by the greek empire under
[28:31] alexander the great and daniel speaks of
[28:33] the little horn and we don't have time
[28:36] to get into that but it's it's amazing
[28:38] details
[28:39] uh about that empire who would conquer
[28:41] the persians and the medes and then
[28:43] alexander the great went all the way uh
[28:46] all the way to india and he builds
[28:48] builds uh persopolis the capital and he
[28:51] has this great victory and and it
[28:53] conquers the conquers what you would
[28:54] think is the entire world
[28:56] and and then the greeks would replace be
[28:59] replaced by the romans and then that
[29:01] empire would rise and that empire would
[29:02] fall
[29:03] and then the the uh and then there it
[29:06] would be a great army that would be
[29:08] followed and mixed with uh clay and iron
[29:11] and he saws then he sees a stone that's
[29:13] taken from the mountain and it's god's
[29:16] first warning to this one king
[29:18] nebuchadnezzar king you might be in
[29:21] charge of your dominion but i'm in
[29:22] charge of the whole world and i'm in
[29:25] charge of all of history and i calls
[29:27] kingdoms to rise
[29:29] and i cause kingdoms to fall biden's not
[29:32] in control neither was trump in control
[29:34] of the nation
[29:36] and putin's not in control of
[29:38] russia people say oh man it's
[29:41] putin pushes that button let me tell you
[29:43] something let me just get you put your
[29:45] minds at ease no man that may be a
[29:47] physical man who's anointed to do
[29:49] something but no man
[29:52] has the say-so of when that button is
[29:54] pushed
[29:55] there is a man who's got his finger on
[29:56] the button and his name is jesus
[29:59] and he decides to say time shall be no
[30:02] more
[30:03] and the end of all things so your life
[30:04] in my life isn't in the control of kim
[30:07] jong-un or some tyrant over in russia my
[30:10] life is in control and my life has been
[30:12] called up into another entire sphere
[30:15] not of this world not part of it
[30:17] and so you go through all of this and
[30:19] what's amazing is that daniel sees all
[30:21] the way and you move on chapter 3
[30:23] chapter 4 all the way into daniel 11 and
[30:25] it's incredible because
[30:27] daniel sees
[30:29] he sees the messiah prince and we know
[30:31] that the prophecy of
[30:33] daniel 70 weeks
[30:35] and he sees all the way
[30:37] to the coming of the messiah prince
[30:41] all the way down to the day he rides in
[30:43] jerusalem
[30:45] and daniel
[30:46] in the book of daniel you find the exact
[30:48] to the amount to the to the to the very
[30:51] day that jesus comes writing in and
[30:53] daniel sees this messiah he sees the
[30:55] time in a.d and then in bc
[31:01] all of time and daniel sees the coming
[31:04] of jesus and he sees what happens to the
[31:06] jews before that coming and he sees
[31:08] right before at the ending
[31:10] at the ending of bc
[31:12] before christ
[31:15] right before christ comes daniel sees
[31:20] a tyrant an evil man
[31:22] an evil man that is more evil to the
[31:24] jews than any other
[31:26] nation or any other leader had ever been
[31:28] and daniel sees destruction and you can
[31:30] go in historically you read about
[31:33] antiochus epiphanes and if you study
[31:36] the the maccabean revolt and the book of
[31:39] maccabees you'll learn all about this
[31:41] man antiochus epiphanes in history who
[31:44] who and you you have judah benjamin jude
[31:46] i think is his name in the book of
[31:47] maccabees and you have all of this
[31:49] history that takes place and then you
[31:51] have jesus and daniel sees the coming of
[31:54] this messiah prince down to the day down
[31:56] to the day that he's cut off and then
[31:58] it's like it's like daniel stops there
[32:02] he he he stops speaking about the
[32:04] messiah prince and he goes straight into
[32:07] the end the white throne judgment and
[32:09] the battle of armageddon and the the end
[32:11] time end of all end and the climax of
[32:13] everything
[32:14] he skips thousands of years of history
[32:17] in which you're a part of that history
[32:20] and he moves if you read in the book of
[32:22] in the in chapter 12 he moves all the
[32:24] way from jesus the messiah prince and
[32:27] then he immediately it's sort of like
[32:29] two binocular if you look through a pair
[32:31] of binoculars
[32:33] and you have a i'm just going to close
[32:34] here because we're out of time you have
[32:36] a mountain and you're looking at a
[32:37] mountain range you know if you take
[32:38] those binoculars and you're looking at a
[32:40] mountain range and you see a peak right
[32:42] here right
[32:44] you see a peak right here and you're
[32:45] looking this way and then there's a
[32:47] higher peak beyond it you know what it's
[32:50] going to look like to you it's going to
[32:52] look like all one big mountain
[32:55] what you can't see
[32:57] is that in between those two peaks
[32:59] is a large gap
[33:01] and daniel's seen the
