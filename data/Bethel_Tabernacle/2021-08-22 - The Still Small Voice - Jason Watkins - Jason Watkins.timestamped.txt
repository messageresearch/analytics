[0:00] that's what christ came to do
[0:02] not to give us knowledge
[0:04] he came to redeem us
[0:06] so that the lives that we have
[0:09] are expressing what what he made us to
[0:12] be in in the beginning
[0:14] in his image and his likeness
[0:16] to be the visible expression
[0:18] of the invisible spirit
[0:21] so we're walking you and i are walking
[0:23] around in life people are seeing god
[0:26] that's what we were made
[0:28] created in the beginning to be
[0:31] jesus died on the cross so that we would
[0:33] have that
[0:34] what do we have the message today what
[0:36] is the restoration of the message today
[0:39] so that we would be
[0:41] him manifested
[0:44] why were we restored to the full why did
[0:46] we even have to be restored to the full
[0:47] word couldn't we just have the blood of
[0:49] christ and have a part of the word
[0:52] there'd be no rapture that's for sure
[0:54] there needs to be a full word restored
[0:58] are you gonna are we gonna be a bride
[1:01] without spot or wrinkle
[1:03] with just
[1:04] one part of the word
[1:06] maybe we have seven sacraments and we
[1:08] believe in
[1:10] all kind of nonsense but hey we believe
[1:12] in jesus
[1:13] that's enough i got a relationship with
[1:16] jesus
[1:17] that's that that's doesn't mean anything
[1:20] that has no meaning without the life of
[1:23] jesus being inside of you judas had a
[1:26] relationship with jesus too
[1:29] it didn't mean he experienced salvation
[1:32] right a lot
[1:34] uh
[1:35] caiaphas had a relationship with jesus
[1:38] too
[1:38] oh but i'm not talking about that
[1:40] okay what are you talking about then
[1:45] are jesus in you produces
[1:48] a life of what
[1:51] surrender to the word jesus said if you
[1:54] love me
[1:56] you'll do whatever you want to do
[1:58] and you'll disregard anything everything
[2:00] half of what i say
[2:04] that's what the denomination tells us
[2:07] that's what the system tells us
[2:09] we don't need the full word we're
[2:11] comfortable with where we're at
[2:14] the bride is not comfortable with where
[2:16] she's at until she's in full surrender
[2:20] to jesus christ if you love me
[2:23] keep my commandments
[2:25] and he says where i am
[2:27] there will my servant be also it doesn't
[2:30] say wherever my servant is that's where
[2:32] i am
[2:33] who's the one that's leading you or him
[2:39] my goodness i'm so far off my topic
[2:42] matthew 16 16-18
[2:48] peter
[2:51] had a supernatural revelation simon
[2:52] peter replied you're the christ
[2:55] the son of the living god and jesus
[2:58] answered him blessed are you simon
[2:59] barjona
[3:00] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[3:02] this to you but my father who is in
[3:04] heaven and i tell you
[3:05] you are peter
[3:07] and on this rock i will build my church
[3:10] and the gates of hell shall not
[3:12] prevail against it
[3:16] that's the revelation of who he is peter
[3:19] is not that rock
[3:20] peter means little stone
[3:23] jesus is not directly the rock rather
[3:26] it's the revelation of who
[3:29] jesus christ is that is the foundation
[3:33] that the church is built upon
[3:35] it's the foundation
[3:37] right
[3:38] it's not the continuation it's just the
[3:40] foundation
[3:42] this is where we start who is jesus
[3:45] who is jesus
[3:47] is jesus the one that's proclaimed on
[3:49] the denominational church
[3:54] oh yeah that's jesus
[3:56] it is
[3:57] jesus is who he
[3:59] says he is
[4:00] jesus is where he manifests himself
[4:04] so when jesus wants to
[4:08] be known
[4:09] he makes himself known
[4:11] we don't get to stand up and say hey
[4:13] this is what we this is what this is
[4:15] what jesus is that's theology
[4:19] jesus declare he's first he's declared
[4:21] himself in the word and then he's
[4:23] promised certain things in the word to
[4:25] be manifested in certain ages
[4:28] then who is jesus
[4:30] the mighty angel that came down with an
[4:33] open book to restore us back
[4:35] to the original faith
[4:37] jesus
[4:38] is not some historical figure that died
[4:42] two thousand years ago
[4:44] that people want to model their lives
[4:46] over because he was such a good man
[4:48] that's not who jesus is
[4:50] that's who he was
[4:53] but who is he
[4:55] it's who he declares himself to be
[4:58] who you know when moses
[5:00] was called of god he said who
[5:03] should i say
[5:04] sent him
[5:05] he didn't he didn't say well
[5:07] you know
[5:09] historical god he made reference to
[5:10] historical god
[5:12] the god of abraham god of isaac the god
[5:15] of jacob but when he said who will i say
[5:17] sent him he didn't say tell him the god
[5:19] of jacob sent you
[5:21] he said i am that i am.
[5:24] tell them i am sent you the god
[5:27] who declares himself that's
[5:30] another way you could translate i am
[5:32] that i am is i become what i become
[5:35] in other words
[5:36] i manifest myself in front of you that's
[5:40] who who is this the one that's been
[5:41] manifested
[5:43] that's the importance of this message
[5:47] let's not get away from that
[5:49] what is it what is this all about
[5:53] we have a relationship with jesus what
[5:55] jesus
[5:56] there's another jesus
[5:59] which is not jesus
[6:00] who is jesus he's the one
[6:03] who manifests himself he's the i am not
[6:06] the i was
[6:08] not the i will be the one who's declared
[6:11] himself
[6:12] in this day through a prophet
[6:15] this is who jesus is
[6:17] the whole world is grasping after
[6:19] something else
[6:21] something different
[6:22] another idea
[6:24] another theology
[6:26] a new book that some superstar
[6:29] quote-unquote christian
[6:31] theologian puts out
[6:33] no
[6:35] no
[6:36] he is the word
[6:38] and he declares himself the same
[6:40] yesterday today and forever he did that
[6:44] through the prophet so that we would
[6:45] understand what is he doing in this hour
[6:48] he is perfecting a bride
[6:52] jesus is not calling
[6:55] in denominations
[6:57] you see denominations they have meanings
[6:59] they have things happen people are
[7:01] coming to the altar
[7:03] they're not experiencing jesus
[7:06] say who are you
[7:07] who do you think you are
[7:09] up there telling us who jesus is and who
[7:12] jesus isn't
[7:13] the prophet taught us
[7:15] the truth
[7:17] has nothing to do with my idea
[7:20] we just need to get rid of this
[7:22] false concept
[7:24] that there's a thousand jesuses
[7:27] and whichever way i live it's fine
[7:29] just as long as i stamp the name of
[7:31] jesus on top of it
[7:33] that's not right
[7:34] that's not scriptural
[7:37] jesus produces a life
[7:39] that's in conformity to the word
[7:43] not in conformity to our thoughts not in
[7:45] conformity to the world
[7:49] to the word
[7:51] that's
[7:52] the jesus that we worship
[7:54] that we're serving people say well
[7:57] that's not my jesus okay
[8:00] you have your own jesus
[8:02] you make up your own jesus but it's an
[8:04] idol
[8:06] jesus has been manifested today
[8:09] we don't get to make up what we like we
[8:11] don't get to make up the doctrines we
[8:13] don't get to say oh we like this one and
[8:15] like that one and this one's okay and
[8:17] that one's okay
[8:19] go ahead
[8:20] go ahead you're doing exactly what they
[8:22] did when the white horse rider was
[8:24] riding don't listen to the voice of the
[8:27] white horse rider
[8:29] there's a word that's been vindicated
[8:31] and manifested we have to take it back
[8:33] to the bible
[8:36] we have to use spiritual discernment
[8:38] to understand what's thus saith the lord
[8:42] but when brother brandon preaches
[8:43] something for 20 years
[8:46] it's not our job to redefine it to
[8:48] change it
[8:49] to say oh that's wrong
[8:51] no
[8:52] god vindicated that word
[8:55] and he expects disa
[8:57] he he says
[8:59] i want you to obey that word when when
[9:01] the prophet deuteronomy 18 when a
[9:04] prophet comes
[9:06] preaches that preaches his brings his
[9:08] message
[9:09] he says those who don't listen i will
[9:12] require it of them
[9:14] in other words they're going to answer
[9:15] to god at the day of judgment
[9:17] for turning down and rejecting
[9:20] the manifested word
[9:22] amen let's let's stand and pray
[9:29] heavenly father i thank you so much for
[9:31] your word
[9:33] lord help us to not conform you to our
[9:38] thinking lord but to
[9:40] be conformed to what's been
[9:42] proven and vindicated
[9:44] help us lord
[9:46] forgive us our
[9:48] sins forgive us our unbelief
[9:51] lord cleanse our hearts father correct
[9:53] us
[9:54] and help us lord to walk more
[9:58] lord in that image and likeness which he
[10:00] created us to be
[10:02] we ask your blessing upon the worship
[10:04] upon the preaching of the word may your
[10:06] name be lifted up and glorified
[10:08] we ask these things in the name of our
[10:10] lord jesus christ
