awesome but i'm looking for some more awesome today i didn't come tired i came with a great expectation how many came with a great expectation say lord i got an empty cup again today and i'm gonna lift it up what is that cup brother matt whatever you need whatever your whatever's in your life put it there place your name there and say lord here's my need here's my cup lord would you come and fill it up and you know what's awesome about god is god can take a crowd like this with so many different needs so many different storms of life that people are going through so many different prayers and burdens and requests and you think man we need a service for each and every single need but god can take one hour hour and a half whatever it is two hours he could take a a servant a minister of the gospel and just like he multiplied the fishes and the loaves he could take all of those needs and in one service he could meet every single need in your life and i want to say lord would you do that for me today i don't want to leave empty i don't want to leave these meetings go back in my car and journey home and miss what god has what god had planned and laid in store for my life don't miss it friends you don't have meetings we don't know how much longer we'll be here and we didn't think we'd ever envisioned a meeting like this a year ago my goodness would have been impossible we don't know what lays ahead so you know what you do you take advantage when you got the opportunity and now here's your chance here's your moment i just want to say lord i want to avail myself of everything you have for me amen we're going to take up the offering this morning before we do you can have your seats just for a minute we have some specials also and i just want to make a um a few

meetings but we wanted to do something nice and put it together we've held off the uh the offering ties and offerings until today you want to make sure i don't miss any um announcements yeah so yeah we've we've uh we've there's been a great experience we didn't charge anything didn't want to charge anything to bring anybody here but if you want to give unto the lord contribute and give to god and for these meetings anything you give will go directly towards the expense it wouldn't cover it um the amount that wouldn't come close to covering it but if you want to give we want to take up the ties and offerings today brother luther let's all stand to our feet amen if you have a need something upon your heart also at this time something you're praying about you just want to raise a hand to the lord and say god come and meet my need this morning as we take up the tithes and offerings [Music] god bless you ain't nothing like dwelling in unity in the holy spirit no other place to be you know we could uh go make some money it'll vanish but what's happened here this weekend is eternal amen and we just want to stay with that commitment and just praise the lord let's pray lord i love you and

him sister sharon carter if you could come amen let's sing that one more time as they get ready i would not be denied until jesus came and made me hope i would be amen you can have your sinks [Music] [Music] i wanted to mention that uh as brother john was preaching there's a song i sang years ago and i'm not going to end up singing it today but it's called heal the wound and leave the scar because it's a reminder of how merciful you are satan always tries to remind us of the wound and oftentimes even i have found myself agreeing with satan and uh forgetting to look at the the what he's actually pointing at is actually healed over and it's a scar now so it's not a wound so uh it's pretty much he's he's putting out his own he's pointing out his own failure so uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] babylon teaching me her pleasure-driven ways [Music] have some fun forget about tomorrow live today [Music] [Applause] her music and her fashion her hollywood and passion can stimulate the flesh just like wine [Music] and all the while she pulls us all away from everything divine but i have heard voice calling me out of babylon [Music] to a higher place there's a mountain i can live upon and i have made my choice jesus my joy and liberty [Music] babylon will never never have its hold on me [Music] mystery reaches further to the soul [Music] [Applause] but never let the spirit have control she stands against revival the truth within the bible binding hungry hearts with chains of fears and somehow makes confusion of the word god [Music] calling me out of babylon [Music] to a higher place there's a mountain i can live upon and i have made my choice jesus [Applause] babylon will never [Applause] [Music] revelation 18 2 says babylon the greatest fault is fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean and hateful bird but verse 4 says i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues i have heard a voice calling me out of babylon to a higher place there's a mountain i can live upon and i have made my choice in jesus [Applause] babylon will never never have its hold on me [Music] i have made my choice jesus [Music] [Applause] babylon will never [Music] [Applause] i'm never glad i heard a voice calling me out of babylon [Music] to a higher place there's a mountain i will live upon and i have made my choice jesus is my joy in liberty [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] babylon will never never have it told on me [Applause] babylon will never never on me [Music] so [Music] so oh [Music] i sought the lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear those who look on him are radiant they'll never be ashamed they'll never be ashamed [Music] my enemies the son of god [Music] he will deliver them [Music] magnify the lord with me [Music] [Music] the lord with me [Music] forever [Music] that the lord is good [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] together with me [Music] let us bless the lord every day and night never ending praise [Music] let us [Music] may our instance rise let us [Music] anyway [Music] magnify the lord with me [Music] foreign foreign [Music] me [Music] is foreign he'll give you everything he'll give you everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen how many can say the lord is good amen babylon couldn't hold you you sought the lord and he delivered you i would say he's good amen give him another hand clap this morning hallelujah [Music] amen amen i'm going to ask brother jaron brown to bring his special after that we'll have the youth choir bring theirs amen as i get ready let's just sing that song thank you jesus for the grace that you've given us amen oh thank you jesus for the grace that you have given us though i can't repay from my heart i'd like to say that i i thank you and i'll say thank you jesus [Music] for the grace that you have given though i can't repay although i can't repay from my heart i'd like to say that i thank you [Music] amen god bless you all just like to say a word of thanks to all the musicians that are up here um how many appreciate our musicians today man let's give them a handy page [Applause] and it would certainly be a different service without them had a song on my heart to sing i was requested to sing and sister deborah here my goodness she was labor until wee hours of the morning with all the the specials amen which have been such a blessing amen but i just wanted to say a special word of thanks to the musicians amen and their contribution to the service amen this song is very special to me man i pray that it's a blessing to you just pray for me i'm a little nervous as i sing this song amen but my mind goes to the story in the bible of the the prodigal son if there was ever a story that i could relate to it was a story the prodigal son amen and god's love for him amen you know in all the when i read my bible and all the stories that it mentions there was only one time in all the great and mighty things that our god has done there was only one time when he ran amen was when the his son turned his heart back to him his wayward son amen almighty god [Music] powerful [Music] commanding king of kings mighty conqueror and the only time the only time i ever saw him was when he ran to me he took me in his arm held my head to his chest and said my sons come home again he lifted my face and wiped the tears from my this in his voice he said son didn't know i still love you [Music] he called me by surprise god red [Music] oh i knew i'd broken his heart [Music] and i wonder if things would ever be the same and then one night oh i remembered his love for me and so down that dusty road that i could see it was the only time it was the only time i ever saw him he around me in his arm and held my head to his chest and said my sons come home again lifted my face and wiped the tears from my eyes and with forgiveness in his voice he said son do you know i still love you oh he called me by surprise oh when he brought me to my knees when god read i was so ashamed and all alone and so far away but now i know that he's been waiting for this day i saw him run to me he took me and his arm and healed my head to his chest and said and with forgiveness in his voice i felt his love for [Music] home again he lifted my face oh and wiped the tears from my eyes and with forgiveness in his voice she said son [Applause] and he said son do you know i still love you he called me by surprise and he brought me to my ears god [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm saying ready [Music] [Music] we bend our knees oh spirit come make us humble [Music] we turn our eyes from evil things [Music] give us not lift our souls to another give us give us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that seeks your oh god of jacob and god let us be a generation that speaks that seeks your face oh god of jacob we vow our hearts we bend our knees spirit come make us [Music] let us [Music] give us pure hearts let us [Music] [Applause] oh god [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh god of he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken we bend our knees [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah that's sister amariah watkins if she'd bring her special amen don't you love the lord certainly thankful for the church here amen while i have the microphone for a second i'll take the opportunity to say thank you brother jason and the church here why don't we give them another hand amen [Music] amen god is good to us amen how many can say he ran to me aren't you thankful for that amen aren't you thankful he ran to you amen he's here again this morning to meet every need amen wireless [Music] amen you love him this morning amen this is a song i really don't my voice just from the meetings is gone so but it was requested that i sing this so i don't really have it this morning but amen i'm going to sing to the glory of god and i really believe that i mean this the meaning of this song so many can identify with um the man who wrote this song said that for years he battled a drug addiction and alcohol addiction and god set him free from it and he said if i was to ever have the devil in the room and have a minute with him he said this is what i'd like to tell him you might not recognize me now the chains that one surrounded me are laying on the ground [Music] you can't keep digging up my past you may have had a laugh or two but you won't get the last [Music] you might not recognize me now [Music] maybe i was blind but now i see maybe i was bound but now i'm free and maybe you need reminded you're under my feet maybe you're a lie that i don't need maybe you should listen when i speak maybe you need reminded you're under my feet if you want us i'll show you scars [Music] if i were you i'd be afraid cause everything you may forgive the cross is meant with grace maybe i was blind but now i see and maybe i was bound but maybe you should listen when i speak and maybe you need reminding you're under my feet [Music] i think it's time you meet my maker i think it's time you meet my maker [Applause] i think it's time that you remember i think it's time that you remember maybe i was blind but now i see and maybe i was bound but now i'm free and maybe you need reminded you're under my beam maybe you're a lie that i don't need maybe you should listen when i speak and maybe you need reminding you're under my needs maybe this is where we say farewell maybe you should get on back to hell and maybe you need reminding you're under my thief you might not recognize me now [Music] amen let's stand together [Applause] hallelujah amen has he changed your life man you might not recognize me now amen before we turn it over to brother jason why don't we just close our eyes lift our hands to him and sing i love him love him because he first loved me and purchase my salvation [Music] oh i love him [Music] oh do you just really love him with all your heart today just tell him say lord i love you you first love me and purchase my my salvation on [Music] oh i love him yes i i love him [Music] lift all [Music] amen blessed be the name of the lord we'll have brother michael lead us in that once more when i finish here as we transition to the most important part how many has enjoyed this weekend my what a wonderful time what wonderful leadership what wonderful teamwork i wanted to just have a minute again i greeted you all on friday night and i just wanted to make one final closing remark to thank you all for being here you have made this possible it's exceeded far above and beyond our expectations but i knew the lord would do that that's just how he rolls he always does more than you can think or ask so you should ask big because he's going to even do more than that so brother brown said don't don't be afraid to ask big things you're not going to drain the ocean you're just a little fish drink all you want you're not it's still going to be there tomorrow amen i i tell you god he doesn't conserve energy we do we have to we're mortals we have to you know think about conserving energy let's not use it all up you know there's big conservation things man the lord he'll he'll throw down a lightning bolt be millions of volts in that thing he's got power to burn he don't conserve energy at all so so say lord hit me with one of them today amen amen fill me up lord my we've certainly enjoyed uh having brother john and sister sharon here with us and such a perfect fit for our our vision for this weekend and i just would like to thank all of my teams and we had a number of people here working i'd like to uh give a special recognition to brother matt and sister rachel who kind of ramrodded the whole thing and headed it up for me it's been the first time brother matt's just a little bit older now uh than i was when we were uh getting some feedback by the george he's just a little bit older now than i was and we were running public meetings in the downtown park and and ever meeting since then amen i've been right at the head of it and so this time i said man i'm going to sit back and let these younger generation just take it over and uh believe me you'll be collapsing tomorrow i've told my wife every time i've said it before i'll say it again i would rather preach 10 sets of meetings than host one it is exhausting you have no idea for the pastor the host pastor it is exhausting even though you're not doing the preaching and so he's going to be tired but it wasn't just brother matt and sister rachel it was all of the helpers and the parents of the young people that made it all possible we even managed to lasso in a superstar song leader today i was so loved i i was so excited to hear brother michael was going to be leading singing today he joins uh a wonderful we have a wonderful team of worship leaders and everybody and our musicians doing such a wonderful job but you know above it all above the minister and the ministry families and the workers and the the officers and the musicians and and worship leaders and everybody that has made this possible the lord sets at the top of it all and his word and you don't think friends i'm going to tell you something this word on this weekend has been laser focused and i happen to know i could stand here and take the rest of the morning just testifying to you the supernatural way i know that it was the hand of god amen you know i i was sitting behind brother john friday night as he was preaching you know about a wound center and you know somebody could might think wow wow these these are just young people what are they they don't even live long enough to have that many wounds and scars and uh but you know i had just come that very morning and i had read an article that i had saved to read months ago and forgot to read it by the john and on friday morning i woke up and i looked at it you know what it was it was a friend of mine a doctor who sent it to me and it it you're talking about a a pandemic right now the the psych hospitals the mental hospitals are overran with young people committing suicide in the last 24 months it's nearly doubled to nearly 100 percent increase psychiatrists are saying we've never seen anything like it children young teens and teenagers and older teenagers trying to take their own life i thought my here's a world of teens with no answers running to take their life and here's young people running to life running to the tree of life running to the river of life hallelujah what a contrast that we have brother john i tell you i knew right away you were right on the target this is the mind of the lord i tell you friends we're almost home and uh you know brother branham said i'm not looking for another revival he said i'm looking for the coming of the lord amen don't wait for a revival coming it's here you're in it and you are it do you believe that so i want you to pull on the word today's our final service it always happens that way it starts and bang it's over and i'm looking forward to that day where we won't have a schedule and we got to get back and we can just always peace forevermore on that happy golden shore so thank you to everybody who made this possible and all my friends and the youth we we salute you and we love you and all of those that came up in the prayer friday and saturday or who might come for prayer today we haven't even made a a call but people have come and you know that's god moving on hearts you can't remember paul said the human mind is enmity against god i could never agree with god you can't force a young person really a teenager in that awkward state with all their peers around to step out come up and in front of everybody weeping and crying and all the audience weeping and crying you can't it takes god to do that brother john doesn't have enough charisma to make that happen he's got it but he doesn't have enough to do that but that is god doing that i'm always keenly aware that it takes the holy spirit to do that so i want to say thanks and we've still got this service and then afternoon fellowship and for all those who will be driving back home today god bless you from brother jason and the bethel tabernacle family and uh you want to stay around the afternoon we'll fellowship until as brother gerald hughes says till the cows come home and the calves cry for buttermilk amen i have no idea what that means but he has said it for years it's a nice catchy phrase amen we're going to ask brother michael to come and lead us in this great anthem of the church again it's an old stanza and so it's how i feel i tell you something friends calvary means a great deal to me that day on calvary wow what what you know what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be made up to be quickened to be made alive in christ jesus brother michael come lead us god bless you friends amen praise the lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] love me [Music] salvation [Music] amen with your eyes closed now jesus is the sweet name i know and he's just the same as his lovely name that's the reason i love him and that's the reason why amen i wonder if you could just say that this morning i love you jesus oh yes for jesus he is the sweetest oh the sweetest name i know oh yes you are low and jesus is the sweetest name i and he's just the same [Music] oh and that's the reason why i love him so for jesus is the sweetest thing i know he's [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] lord let's just worship him in our hearts and lift up our voices together let's let this whole congregation lift up your voices just don't worry about who's around you glory to god just speak what's in your heart i love you jesus i thank you lord praise you lord god for coming in your wonderful way we love you we receive you praise the lord oh father we welcome you today lord take the microphone take our hearts take our lives lord come so near that all of us could reach out and like we could touch you lord [Music] oh just blanket the service lord i know we've sang for a while and had good singing and prayers but we just love you lord and want you to come and speak this last meeting lord we don't want to go a meeting without you don't let anyone receive any glory but you lord we've saw you all weekend and this assembly bethel tabernacle has been jesus to us oh can we say thank you lord you arranged these meetings lord it was like an oasis it was like a fountain in the middle of the desert it was like healing bomb it was just on time it was exactly what we needed so lord once more i know it's already the afternoon but would you come and talk to us sit down by the well sit down by the well lord give us living water oh that as we drink we would never thirst for anything else but you lord we just keep coming back keep coming back and give us food that we can eat from that would last us for 40 days not a momentary blessing not a weekend of but as you did in the old testament to the prophet that was up in the mountain that needed to get away you brought him flesh and water and brought him nourishment that lasted him 40 days a whole over a month you can do that this morning hallelujah come lord and speak to us in jesus name amen and they all said thank you musicians amen thank you amen we appreciate you and amen maybe you can just have your seats for a moment i just need to shake this brother's hand nice to have you today thank you brother hallelujah thank you musicians you did wonderful today and have you enjoyed the weekend and we want to thank you i know it's already 12 15 and you know i've been preaching too long this weekend you know i get it right away from my wife do you know how long you preach tonight and uh it's better than a sandal being thrown at you hallelujah amen she still loves me after all of this you know it is amazing so god bless you and sister debbie nice to see you today and brother jason and brother matthew and sister rachel god heard your cry for restoration and i thank you and brother jason and your wife and all of the team you've just been real servants and we've saw this the lord jesus use your church this week this hasn't been a local meeting it's been uh for many that has gone some have already gone away back to their home churches and are song leading and in their local assemblies and it hasn't been a local meeting this has been uh all of us even the services that's been spoken there's been hundreds hundreds of people that have viewed those services so it's not just those on this property or at this address you know um there was a lot of lyft drivers and uber and taxi cab drivers last night that came by here and hallelujah picked up all you drunk people hallelujah y'all woke up in your motel or in your house and but isn't it great to serve the lord if you don't know what i meant you have to go back and hear the service amen we want to fall in love with jesus i i know many in this local church isn't even here today they're streaming and they made room for us and we really appreciate that and uh i shook hands with a father that's at a motel with his wife and streaming he wanted his children to be at the service he didn't want to hinder but they're streaming so their young people can be here and sit and i think that's good sometimes young people just need to hear the word with out a dad or mom or somebody screaming behind him i'm not saying that's negative i'm just saying sometimes we just need to get our children in an atmosphere so the physician can touch them you understand what i mean i had two things on my heart for this morning and uh praying and i was getting ready in my room alone and i said lord it would take a miracle it would just take god to do those things and already today it's already happening the very people that we were praying for and i said brother jason it was going to take a miracle i can't even do that the lord's already done it in the service two people specifically isn't he great so this is our last meeting and we don't want to be long and so let's just stand and turn to the book of psalms chapter 103 and and then malachi chapter 4 uh two places psalms 103 these are some of the greatest times of your life sacred sands like this and meetings like this and to have a church open hallelujah i mean will people want to pray with you people love you people want you to go on the rapture no one's bitter no one's against you you just come in and it's all good like here's your chair here's your seat what can we do to make you feel comfortable because we want you to go out change we don't want you to be the same that's why we have these meetings and we come is because we want all of you to make it and if there's anything we've said or done that's offended anyone i'm sorry sometimes we have to become fools in front of you so that we would maybe win somebody's heart you understand sometimes we have to like be foolishness to win somebody over and that's okay i think you understand psalms 103 verse 1 to 5 this is the psalm of david he said bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits hallelujah his benefits don't forget them this morning verse 3 who forgiveth some of your iniquities is that what your bible says no who forgiveth all thine iniquities those are things that you did that you knew was wrong that you shouldn't have done you did it anyway god says i just forgive you and there's things that you're not doing that you should have been doing and you're neglectful and you say man that's going to do me forever and god's saying nope i'm going to forgive you of that isn't that great who healeth all thy diseases praise god who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies isn't this wonderful god's dress where amen god's armament um god's speaking to you in a certain way because he loves you and he puts gifts in the church that can say things a certain way to just you know he's crowning you with loving kindness and he's tender he's wonderful he's in this building right now verse 5 who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles isn't that wonderful david saw this he was a shepherd so he knew what it was like to have sheep that needed to go by cool waters and waters that were just like uh he leadeth me beside still waters because sheep get nervous and you can't have them always going by rushing water it's still water it's just rushing fast and the currents going david knew that sheep needed to go by waters that were just slowly or just barely moving because they're nervous lions are after them tigers are after them foxes and you just need to come by a place where you can hear the word and it can impact you hallelujah malachi chapter 4 i had you seated earlier so you'd have a little strength to just stand with us as we read malachi chapter 4 verse 1 the last chapter of the old testament for behold let's say behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly and brother branham stopped here and said when he when the bible says all the proud and he says like the americans and so forth so they're all proud and then they all have it on their church signs and out on their signs when there's an emergency pray pray pray but when things get back going no they're just right back to their worldly things so there is a day coming though when all the proud ye and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you hallelujah who's in there that fear or have respect for my name shall the son of righteousness arise with what amen i i read that too actually last night i saw that in the news there's more young people that are committing suicide and have committed suicide in the last year than have died by the virus in a global pandemic and on the news every day they're putting fear and the virus and the numbers and there's more suicides of young people than by the virus thank god for this oasis and in a time of judgment god's going to rise upon you with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet and the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him and horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments verse 5 behold i the same one that said i will restore says i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart verse 6 he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart let's all say heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse and elijah has come and done his work already and we are those that were in the field that was when the message was waved over the field saying there's more like that that's going to come to maturity you and i were in the field this is our revival every generation has their chance god's given you a chance don't be bored with the chance don't be pushing off the chance don't be you know he's knocking at our hearts door and you i'm busy i'm tired i'm nervous no no then he'll just gonna go around to the back door he's gonna knock on the attic wherever you find yourself praise the lord god bless you this afternoon as you have your seats amen forgive us for having you stand our title this morning is revival in the new generation brothers you can put up our first slide if you don't mind revival in the new generation you that have listened to spoken word as the original seed and other messages uh read the church age book know that brother branham said that every generation deserves their chance at the word they get their chance this is your revival this is your time young people we ought to be on the edge of our seats before we drive home this afternoon knowing that god has a word for us do y'all remember last night brother branham was remembering speaking to young people several months later on june the 1st 1963 he said i remember when those angels came down on the mountain i remember what was said and especially about the young people so any real ministry that is uh working operating in the third pool ought to be dealing with young people there ought to be a feeling there ought to be a heart there ought to be compassion there ought to be a willingness to lean down anybody that's great knows how to humble themselves get out of the way so that our children our grandchildren you that are coming in or maybe you've heard it before and you just maybe have slid away a little bit it's time to come back it's time to be restored all that you've been hearing all that you know it's time to put it in and say god make it real in my life here's a psalm of david speaking from his soul and all that is within me but david said in psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits let's all say benefits everyone wants to make you know six figures hundred thousand two hundred thousand they're worried about their salary but don't forget about the benefits you can make a lot of money but you got to have gas you're going to have insurance you're going to have others and if you have a company say i'll pay this amount and i'll pay you benefits you ought to have a smile on your face and say thank you lord hallelujah today we ought to say thank you lord don't forget his benefits that means his dealings i put it on the bottom of the screen for you don't forget the way that god recompenses or he brings benefit to your life dealing of one's hand upon the way that god has handled you as a young lady or as a young man has been bright even when you've been mishandled things have not handled been right or something harsh or i want to say this word misunderstanding has happened in your life god always brings another way to restore you back god change our attitudes today give us a right mental attitude toward every promise of god all of us have had bad things happen to us i'm going to get into that and just nail it down before we leave one another that you can't be a victim the rest of your life think everything's against you and always looking sideways and you know crossing bridges before you get there and and always thinking somebody's following you and and you just get nervous and you can't you know be it dark because there's always you know it's amazing how as a young person children are like wet cement whatever's been impressed upon them is what they become you put your hand down in concrete like that and pull it out that's what's going to be in the concrete and children are like young people are like wet cement whatever is impressed upon them is what they become so thank the lord that in our youth god has impressed himself upon our lives david said early will i seek thee that's early in the morning early in the day it's good to talk to the lord i'm just speaking to you right now good to pray in the morning good to have devotion in the morning start out with five minutes start out with 10 minutes you already spent that much time on your cell phone anyway before you got to the bathroom most of you this morning had already checked your cell phone can you just pray a little bit before you turn on your cell phone you know it's just habits it's just daily will i seek thee early early in the morning early in my youth early when god starts dealing with your life can the older ones say amen back there i mean the scars of life and the things that happen and you get run through the ring or backwards you know and nobody calls you up to sing and you had a song ready or you know you have an attitude about that why are they already saying that person sang three times this morning or two times or whatever well these are just bad attitudes you know but we can get it kind of something in our spirit and we just need to let that go don't forget god's benefits and how he has fully dealt with us god's been good to you does anybody have anything against the lord i'm asking a question because tuesday night it better not be where we're lord this lord lord you know people have done that adults have done that lord why and why well we just need our hearts god didn't cause all that satan brings death satan brings trouble none of us have a reason to get angry with god and just anger and bitterness and hatred and you get opposite that's what the holy spirit is just purging us from in these meetings praise god we're sitting right here being washed and you might not think a lot's happening right now but god is just washing somebody just cleansing their minds he's like weaning a child or weaning a little baby it's like god's saying to the young people it's time to step into your position now i put it in my notes days ago to come this sunday morning because the lord had already laid this on my heart i wrote down friday night saturday night and sunday morning's title days ago and so he had dealt with us to encourage the young adults i want to encourage you don't leave it all behind the pulpit and leave it to the preachers and the older ones they've ran their race brother john's 49 years old and i've said this publicly i'm past my prime i'm over the heel you might laugh but in the old testament at 50 they put the high priest out the pasture and another pastor said no brother john you're in your prime i already know i'm over my prime i don't need nobody to tell me that there's better ministers out there there's more young men that are coming up and we want to encourage them brother matthew we don't want to stifle and discourage the song leaders we need to encourage them and brothers that are finding their wings we need to give them their wings and strengthen the church somebody say amen with me amen you know we talk a lot about young people and young people's meetings but sometimes we need older people's meetings it's like the young people have a problem or something we're having youth meetings young people special whole you know i think sometimes the older ones need a change in their attitudes come on young people you can say amen that's all right come on sometimes they get stiff and starchy and cold and indifferent and always pointing fingers at the young people well we're a product of them the young people is a product of the old people's revelation so i don't need to know a lot about your pastor or your church i've solved the young people i already know what goes on in this church and other churches in this region by seeing your young people amen for just a few minutes you can tell whether they really are connected to god or is this just church or are we just coming together and i'm more interested and down next week than i am right now we need men and women to get connected to god so that monday tuesday wednesday they're overcoming they're they're battling the the food that came to the prophet in the mountain fed him for 40 days he didn't need to be traveling to the next youth meeting next weekend and the next weekend like he he for 40 days the fiber of what they were going through was able to minister to them and you all know what i'm talking about and by the way if there's a youth meeting next weekend go be there the next weekend but don't be a person that's a revival surfer we're not revival surfers we're we're men and women that god's given the baton to given the sword to here's the sword use it we can video game and we can be all about social media and internet stuff and social you know but friend it's time that we take the word this is our revival praise god this is our last service so you might as well jump in and the more you encourage me it'll go faster the minute i feel like there's kind of something something you know going like this and then something goes wrong then we've got to go out here to bring you back just stay right in the channel with me stay focused here it is i've had this since friday night out of the church age book brother branham said we see a seventh age messenger coming and he's a prophet not only do we see this messenger coming here in revelations 10 7 but we find that the word speaks of elijah coming before jesus returns matthew 17 10 and his disciples ask him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus said elias truly shall come first and restore all things and brother branham said before the coming of our lord elijah must come back for a work of restoration in the church this is what malachi 4 5 says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before let's all say before hallelujah the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse god help us tonight may there not be one person in this building miss the rapture we've talked about a rapture for a long time we've had meetings for a long you've heard a lot of preaching but i don't want to be here five minutes after the rapture happens five minutes the first five minutes after the rapture happens and a person realized they missed it that'll be enough hell for someone that's been raised in the message [Applause] to know that all they sang about talked about they missed it y'all know what i'm talking you talk about the something coming over you you'll feel like blowing your brains out the bible talks about they'll cry for the mountains to fall on them but they won't be why it's in tribulation then oh my loving brother and sister let's make sure we're in the bosom of someone that's not going to cast you the next morning like a wadded up piece of paper into another garbage can like you're another number that's what the world treats you that that's what sex will do for a young person before they're married you're just another number you're just another lust spirit that's been manifest and then you have unborn children and you have things that go on scars for years god's trying to protect some of you don't go that way i'm looking down the road to some of your marriages and some of your families that's why i preach like this it's not a feel-good gospel sometimes it's it's a rugged road it's a rugged road and the martyrs brothers and sisters before you and i they were going to the stake like this to be burned at the stake these are young people and they're just leaning over saying you don't need to tie my hands that's the spirit that was on them to lay down their life i'm not going to run i'm not going to run away you don't need to tie my hands and they just some of them they just gave and they just stood there and the flames are licking up around them and they just gave their life freely some of us run and maybe run in this morning and you have it so easy why would you delay another afternoon without the lord jesus i think this would be a fantastic afternoon for the whole weekend and everything just to be right that you can just say lord put your arms around me fill me i want to go home with something in my script bag in my little bag and i want to feel those stones of strength and revelation that god's given me personally put oil in me so that i'm not always needing it for someone else the wise virgins had oil and there'll come a time when you'll go to a brother or sister at a special meetings wanting the holy ghost and you won't get it it's too late and we sense the spirit of god lifting off even the meetings and and people wonder why the enthusiasm and why the fire spiritually and why the lack you know it can be like this all wonderful but what what are you talking about in your dorms what are you talking about in your motel rooms what are you talking about in your bedrooms when you're with one another what kind of pictures are you sending what kind of words are you texting what kind of movies are you watching i shouldn't even say that [Applause] brother branham said blow it out with a shotgun well some of you would have a hard time getting a shotgun down on your watch that's on your arm your little apple watch or your little whatever you're more connected than people were years ago there was dick tracy moby dick whatever they was like some sci-fi thing today some of you or teenagers or young people have more on your arm than they did years ago and brother brown said blow it out with a shotgun some of you are texting in church shame on you i'm talking about people that are in the congregation we ought to be connecting to god [Applause] if that device it takes up more of your time and just look at it i don't want to offend you but have has it drawn you closer to the lord this is the time of your youth don't waste it and look back you know in your 20s and say man i was so foolish i i just was so foolish i didn't understand it hadn't really hit me that's what i was doing to the lord jesus but may it strike us now let's get more serious about god i'm encouraging you today this is a revival so brother branham quotes the scripture there is absolutely no doubt that elijah must return before the coming of jesus he has a specific work to accomplish and that work is the part of malachi 4 6 and i want everyone to listen he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers the reason that we know this is his specific work to do is that is because he has already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children when elijah when the elijah ministry was here in john the baptist because luke 1 17 says he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord in the ministry here it is in the ministry of john the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children yeah amen i'm just doing a little bit of teaching because i'm fulfilling joel 2 that in the same month there will be a former and ladder rain there'll be teaching there'll be a rain there'll be teaching there'll be inspirational don't worry i'll get there but right now we need to grow and say god i'm willing to tread some water i'm willing to bear the yoke i'm willing to be taught here part of malachi is the hearts of the fathers would be turned to the children but we're living in the last part this is what i'm trying to get to you we know that because jesus said so it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers this is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the pentecostal fathers not the hollywood fathers not what movie you're watching or where you're going to school or what your career is and who you're going to marry god wants to turn your heart back to the word to our pentecostal fathers john got the fathers ready for jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this prophet william branham [Applause] is that okay i'm not adding to the word it's it's peter standing up saying this is that it's not just brother jason demars that needs to say that i believe in a prophet that's come to term you ought to be able to say god has sent me a prophet i'm talking about you i send you that ought to be so personal and wonderful and you're not ashamed of it and i don't care if they make 387 websites more this year than last year against it you don't have time for it you're focused in you're lasered in god sent me a prophet that's turning my heart back so that's why i listen to it every day now this prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back jesus let's all go like this welcome back jesus you say how are you all going to get ready god sent us a message god sent us a prophet you're a predestinated seed even though you've wondered you've wondered and even though you've wondered you've wondered god has not forsaken you and he has not treated you nor i the way we deserve to be treated somebody say amen to that if you were treated the way you deserve to be treated we'd all deserve hell but god rich in mercy says i'm going to forgive you of your iniquities and your sins and your transgressions see that's where you know i'm not into just always having to read three chapters a day or five chapter you know just stop right there and say god has forgiven my iniquity when you read isaiah when it says by his stripes you are here say by his stripes i am healed and i have an acne issue i have a a a learning disability i have a problem sleeping my mind is just going crazy lord i need peace what if some of you actually started praying like this lord give me your peace not as the world giveth but give me your peace it's not just here today and gone tomorrow and up naturally we will struggle through life and battle certain seasons when satan comes against us and there's times we need doctors there's times we need nurses brother branham believed in medicine there was a man that brother branham was close to that started having problems and it's because the man thought he had so much faith and he just thought taking medicine was not having faith and brother branham picked that up and i think it was a phone call and his first question was this have you been taking your medicine amen and we need to remind ourselves that luke was a physician and they actually used that against i think it was paul that why are you carrying around with you a physician when you're saying we believe in divine healing moving on in topeka kansas brother branham said if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize that he let's say he he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us that's the reason why he appears in youth meetings like this is to release our desires that we have in him to us say but i don't have that i don't have that that's why he's appearing to us in these meetings is to release it to us somebody say praise the lord that's why i said receive it receive it because it's god trying to help you brother brown said people would be dying on the doorsteps the hospital is inside the physicians and your help's on the inside and they're dying on the on the doorsteps but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age this age is made manifest not the promised word for moses age or any of the other ages but the promise of the word for this age oh i just feel inspired right there you are the generation in the message that's alive right now that's going to be here at the coming of the lord amen god knew that he predestinated that so you're not second class you're not third class you're not god has not forgotten you when you feel like you're all alone you're not alone he said i will never leave you i will never forsake you and you got to do school by zoom or you you've been distanced for a while some of you need to learn to get back to worship and praise and feeding off the word and saying hallelujah because you've been in your room you've been distancing you've been can't go to church can't have youth meetings and sometimes it's like an eagle we need to stretch our wings and let the renewing power be released on us hallelujah just let it flow some of you in this building have taken drugs before i know i've heard some testimonies you know what it's like to be on a high oh man y'all are quiet or y'all are angels right y'all were born with the holy ghost you have no problem you've never gone down that pathway drugs and alcohol where a person's just under the influence well what's that's on the negative that's what satan has done to pervert the human where they just get under the influence and then they come out and they can't even be normal so they want that high again well what's wrong with that in the spiritual where you just feed on god and love his presence and cry a little bit and praise him a little bit you might as well start feeling comfortable around here because this is what heaven's gonna be like and if you're just kind of always you know kicking against it and you know then you're not going to feel comfortable in heaven this is heaven this is heavenly places he's trying to bring it down to you and i to release to us we're not earthlings we're not human beings only we're sitting in chairs some are standing some are streaming there's more streaming this service right now or we'll stream it that's in this room right now i heard a preacher say a few days ago well i'm not preaching to those that i don't see i'm preaching to this audience that might be fine for him i'm not saying the same thing i'm preaching to all of you here but there's a lot more that are hungry out there there's hundreds maybe thousands brother matthew that are wondering what's happening amongst the young people what's happening in the message when i look out across the congregation is there a bunch of earrings and makeup and you know how do they dress what do they do like when they play volleyball and what's their attitude like that's what they're looking for is some reality from africa they're looking at your song specials and they're wondering how you're singing i wonder what that young lady's like you know um with the other young people i wonder if that brother is that real when he's out with the brothers moving on brother move on brother [Applause] i can tell when i'm getting just a little bit and then i just pull back a little bit then i tighten it down and i pull it back a little i know what i'm we've been down this road a little bit you know god is awakening us god's causing revival he's throwing flames into your heart he's doing whatever it takes to get your attention we're not in church today we're at the presence of the lord we are the church if you're dead and dry you just need a little gasoline a little you need a little spark you need to get around some people that are praise god hallelujah you know what i was reading last night and my wife and i were up to almost two in the morning i was getting ready for the service today praise god what were you doing at two in the morning well brother i was sawing logs i was asleep praise the lord somebody else i was watching a movie i was talking about this well there's gonna come a generation that has a revival and your young men and your young ladies shall have visions and dreams and god's going to pour out a young lady that used to be all in her room you know or all alone now she's going to be saying mom what can i do for you dad what can i do for you can i do something around here and after you pick them up off the floor your mother after it from recitation like wow really is that was that really the same person that last thursday we just had an in and out all out and now she's asking what she can can she do something he's saying can i take out the garbage that's a real man brothers let's ask my wife we do that you know that's a real man that's a real lady that can say i'm sorry i was wrong if i've ever done anything to offend you i've never meant to do that that's a real lady that's the sweetness of god that is being awakened in these meetings brother matthew that was what was on rachel's heart as i will restore she was wanting a daughter she was wanting a son where there's not all struggle and it's always rebellion and we just want a home where we can have jesus feels comfortable around here friends if we can get a majority of us pushing and the peer pressure is positive then we can get this ball moving the rock can move a little more say i'm pushing i'm pushing but you get all of us pushing and pushing and and god can do something among us can you say amen don't worry about the wildfire we've got enough problems just having fire we hear all the quotes about emotion we need some emotion awakening god's awakening he's stirring he's bringing us to a realization he's bringing us to an emerging i see an emerging generation sister debbie they're coming up can i say something you're coming up you're rising up and you're not going to hear it from my lips you know get down who do you think you are what are you doing we're encouraging you go further than me go further than brother matthew you can teach better than brother jason you can preach better than brother john you can take the offering brother than the brother did this morning hallelujah he said i must walk him down the middle you'll be jumping over here and you'll be wow what that brother make him a trustee and he can just sit back there and retire with his new wife young wife hallelujah and he can say praise god look at those young men they're taking position in the church i encourage not give me that give me that nobody can take these offering like me we didn't we don't need no deacons that are 25 years old we need some that are 68 years old here give me this thing you know what you need to do go sit down because you're killing the new generation you're killing them see nobody can preach like me you need to go sit down and shut up the only rooster in this barn is there's only one rooster in this barn and shame on you anybody say that we need a team we need brothers and sisters that are working [Applause] what do they call that brother ben you gotta reverse and then cut that off the internet please i'm sure somebody's already clicked off you know shake they're shaking their head i'm sure sister lisa saint john's shaking her head right now yeah i love her too she prays for us you know she's gonna stay on the whole service god's awakening these things something that's spiritual he's it's divine it's not natural something that's godly in your life something that's holy and heavenly and unseen it's the holy spirit he's he's bringing these desires that are yearnings and needs that you have and needs that he has are you listening there's needs in the body that he's trying to get you to get out of the way so that he can use you to touch somebody else that's down the pew it's not all the preachers we don't need superstar preachers they have it in sports they have it you know they'll come out and they'll fill stadiums to see their star that ought to stop in the message we're superstar preachers and then you know draw a crowd it ought to be following jesus that ought to be where we're lifting up jesus where he's all i need where he's he's cultivating love in our life and aspirations and longings and wishes something deep that's why he's appearing to us in these meetings is to do these things that i've put on the screen for you do you all appreciate this the reason i put these on the screen is i think you get more out of it if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose i put it on twice to release our desires things that were in you that you didn't even know about but it's there i wanted to go back a little bit and show you something from the welsh revival 1904 is this okay something that happened and it wasn't an ordinary church service it was a bunch of young people that had got together because they were hungry and thirsty for a revival and even the late the young lady that her pictures in front of you probably wouldn't win a beauty contest can you all see that she wouldn't be miss america or miss peru or miss whatever of the universe probably wouldn't win that but here's flora evans she was a teenager between 16 18 years old from a certain place who in this meeting she publicly confessed that she loved the lord jesus christ with all her heart she did this in the morning youth meeting at her church her simple words and this is what happened flora was in the service and all of a sudden she just lifted up her hands and stood and said lord i love you with all of my heart and in that meeting when she said that those simple words were the spark that lit revival fire in her church and in the west wales area this is the wales welsh revival a fire that would soon become national in its scope these words were spoken on sunday february 14 1904 were to be the first drops of an international downpour not a preacher not a pope not some it was a young lady she was a teenager she lord i love you with all of my heart and the holy spirit fell there in wails and over a hundred thousand souls were one to christ here's another man that probably most of us would pass over he needs to maybe trim his mustache a little better brother seth i love you but this is back in these days and it's september of the same year 1904 where an evangelist his name was seth joshua was addressing a convention which included these young people is this all right i'm trying to influence 2021 young people i'm trying to influence the message young people i'm trying to show you revivals in the past how god used young people and and this uh evangelist was speaking at a convention and some of these young people they had young ladies and young men that were in prayer meetings and they were singers at the certain place and seth himself had been praying for years that god would raise up a young man from the pits the coal pits is what he's talking about the pits to revive the churches little d did he know that on thursday september 29 1904 his prayer was to be answered in a life-changing experience for one 26-year-old student his name was evan roberts here's evan i'll show you i've seen a documentary on evan he was just possessed it was like he tried to go to school he tried to work it just he had to work in the pits he tried to go to school and he's just just in his mind he was just possessed with the revival the coolness of the church it's cold and things and evan roberts just a man that was 26 year old a student and so during 1904 this evangelist seth joshua had been holding missions all over wales including one at newcastle emeline where he first came in contact with evan roberts it was a prayer so brother seth is having a convention some of these young people were there in this certain city let's just say beaufort south carolina but this was a place in wales and seth was praying and it was in this prayer that seth begin to pray bend me o lord bend me o lord bend me it was like a groaning like he wasn't satisfied and going in the same direction bend me oh lord where are the young people now brother john's coming into this building speaking to you right where are the young men where are the young ladies and brother seth was at a convention but it was in a prayer he just been me he didn't care about the crowd or how much money the offering was or what people thought about him he'd got far he was broken he was just humbled he was weeping bend me lord is there someone is there a young man that can take this torch and evan roberts was in that service and it so affected him it so touched him that became a prayer and a motto so what was in the older generation was passed to the younger generation of fire and love and i want to show you here this was the revival with youth on fire young men yes and young women i was up this is what i was doing between one and two i was putting his name sydney evans and annie davies on this slide so somebody in this building could say god i want that fire that's what brother john was doing after one o'clock i was putting i put it on there so that you all could see it a little bit i knew the pictures are a little hazy i'm not preaching history i'm trying to put some flame into somebody's heart what what he did before he can do today he's doing today this is another book of acts sydney evans and even annie you'd say annie annie needs a little song or she needs a little revival that's fine but i'm showing you a photo these were real young people this was the welsh revival this was over a hundred thousand souls were one to christ in that generation and i just want to stop right here because i know this is our last service god send us a holy ghost revival [Applause] let us see the revival that you're doing right now don't just not in the future it's already happening brother john already said that on friday night this year of 2021 has been a great outpouring of god's spirit with young people and youth meetings and churches that are hungry they're thirsty god we don't want to get in a rut we don't want to get cold and indifferent and i and i hear the cry and i believe your cry has touched the heart of god somebody say thank you jesus [Applause] don't let us get callous don't let us get cold don't let us get always in our fellowship talking about the virus and the numbers and how many people this and are you wearing a mask or have you been vaccinated we hear enough about that tomorrow we hear about that on the news fake news whatever news what could be real so and so people died i'd rather hear some good news we've just had three services this is like prime time this ought to be the focus this ought to be we had to go back to our home saying what did you say what are you trying to say to the young people of the message what's the spirit of god doing well how is he moving we have come to another season am i prophesying right now i'll just speak to the on streaming audience we are in another season we are another time in the message and it's time for you and i to realize things have changed we've come to another level okay i'll preach to you right here let's move to the next level young people let's stop going through cycles of revival of life and death and life and death and living on the mountain and then going in the valley living on the mountain going there's got to come a time that you know that you can't grow fruits on the mountain fruits are growing in the valley i'm speaking to you i'm like a doctor in the room talking to you privately you can't live on the mountain it gets cold that's where the snow is i live near a mountain mount baker and there's snow up there most the time of the year i don't live in the mountain i might go visit the mountain and we've had fantastic experiences in the mountain but i've got to leave the mountain and come back home come back to school come back to university you got to put a key in your door unlock it and get in and start your car and drive somebody help me i'm trying to get a message to you you can't live on the mountain you got to go down into the valley and live your life for christ that's where fruit comes from that's where you can plant and get your potatoes and get the fruits of the spirit it's not on the mountain god gives us mountaintop experiences but whenever you get to the mountain you'll always see that there's more mountaintops there's more valleys and you've got to leave the mountain and go down into the valley and none of you wanted to hear that this morning this afternoon but that's what we need to hear while we're up here on the mountain we see the next mountain and to get there you got to go down into a valley you're going to be forsaken you're going to be misunderstood you're going to be talked about and you've got to be lady enough and man enough to say whatever i got on that mountain he's going to carry me through this is part of the service today this is god restoring our hearts of children back to the faith of our fathers because real pentecostal fathers and men and women some of your parents are older ones some of them have gotten older and ministers are passing away deacons are passing away you're in another season stop living off of grandma or grandpa or empty or what happened in your family you've got to live today like there is no tomorrow god put a flame in our hearts i've got to preach like this is my last service ever in my life so excuse me if i raise my voice and we get a little excited but this is real friend some of you might clock out and check out before tonight at six o'clock you might be coming into the presence of god and have to give an account for your life i'm trying to give you the last service that you can reach back your mother your father this brother here could say no i saw that brother he was two brothers over for me that sister i noticed her during the service and how god was dealing and i'm so thankful that she was under that atmosphere brother matthew i'm so glad that we had these meetings that we could say together that it's been like an oasis it's been like a healing meetings like this are times that we can come together thank god for it some of you older ones ought to be saying amen preach it brother it's like a bomb of healing when we've had trauma this week you're going to be tormented by thousands of thousands demons that have been loosed the hell the hell's lid has been taken off satan knows he's got his last chances and he's like a person falling down a slippery slope of snow and he's grabbing for every person and everything that he can but he's not gonna grab you you need to stand up and with some real spiritual faith and say i'm gonna climb this mountain i'm gonna go up brother i'm going up the rough side [Applause] some of you need to be bigger than your sorrow bigger than your pain i don't care if it's in your shoulders in your spirit or in your ankle you need to say i'm bigger than this pain i'm going to live for god's glory i'm not just going to shout and praise and clap in church i'm going to live for christ god put a holy ghost revival on somebody i don't care what your name is where you're from that would stand up in a meeting and say oh god bend me lord god give us young ladies that will stand up in a service and say i love you lord jesus with all of my heart and not care what the brothers think of her friend thinks we're more concerned about what jesus thinks lord give us this generation a holy ghost revival and burn me up lord if you've got to put me down and set me aside you'll raise up somebody else somebody else can do better preaching to your young people invite them next year brother matthew don't invite me there's another brother that's in the channel can catch what the people need what the young people need that can minister not over their heads but in their hearts then you invite that brother we're not fooling around and it might be somebody that don't agree the same as matthew or brother jason or brother jason it might be somebody else that maybe opposes you or is different but they can reach the young people invite them it's amazing we can talk about preachers and talk about the pastor and everything's negative and nothing's ever good and you wonder why your young people have no trust in no one we need to shut up our mouth sometimes that might be the very brother that can help your young lady or we'll reach your young man six months from now to too much bad things too many murders have taken place around our dinner tables and i know we don't eat dinner as much as we should so it's around the kitchen bar or around your little snack or a little comment in the van driving down the road before this green sign down here if you notice i said green i didn't say stop sign or red sign you ever wonder why we say just go down to the stop light and make a right why don't we say go down to the green light you're not going anywhere until it turns green anyway it just shows our natures we get glued to the negative glue to the negative glue to the negative well brother my cup is half full this morning my cup is half full i'm not why i ought to be i'm not a good christian i'm just have you ever felt like you're never it's never really the way it ought to be yeah about every day well doesn't that make you feel like you want to stop and quit and when you get texts and emails and when you see your name on websites that you know you're part of the shame group and does that do anything to your morale absolutely it's like throwing fire gasoline on fire it's like praise god at least we were standing up there saying something we don't need monday morning quarterbacking and people sitting behind the desk what did you think about that throw brother jason what'd you think about that move there they are they're so fat and plumpy and got their big earrings and they're and they're talking about something that happened yesterday like oh they they should have thrown to that brother he was wide open and don't you see he's wide open yeah you're sitting up here with a big monitor and no he's down on the he's got getting his guts he's got mud on his face and grass and he's helmet and all kinds of tear and he's sweating that's why he didn't see that man and he and watch the next play we can so dissect everything down well whatever that brother preached never touched us he hasn't said pornography one time this whole weekend well the holy spirit did to your heart so brother john don't need to go on and on about makeup and split skirts and how high heel we're not even going there if we if we don't have enough holy spirit in our meetings [Applause] if we don't have enough conviction and power of god we're not even at first base everybody wants a home run hitter you know you got to get to first base then you got to go to second why am i talking sports i said we're not going to talk sports brother matthew you know but that's where some of you are living and you've got to go to third and if you miss first base i don't care if you hit a home run they're going to call you out that happened this week and major league baseball guy and he's so watching the ball wondering if it's fair he ran right by first base never even touched it ran all the way around absolutely it was a home run but he's called out well you called me up you didn't touch first base you're so excited and this and that you you miss first but go but you know i don't want to go back and touch for it no you're out god put us back in the game and if you want to learn something stop going in the dugout and take our you need to learn touch first base next time just a minor league player telling us that little peep squeak sitting down now over there on that you're you know 24th on the team you should've touched first base yeah that's what you need to do i don't care if you're an all-star player how did we get on baseball you've taken five minutes out of the service no wonder we've been preaching two hours honey sorry baby because you all must be on your cell phones and playing baseball and football and i'm not against none of that i'm just talking your language but when we come to the house of god god give us a real revival so that when we go home there's something burning something burning youth that care youth that are gripped youth that are excited youth that are interested youth that are engaged and by the way i have that in my notes so i'm reading my notes i'm staying focused youth that are focused youth that respect youth that are patient youth that admire youth that are humble maybe i'm speaking some attributes that you need to be we'll just reach out and grab it why is he appearing to us in these meetings it's to awaken these desires make us humble make us patient make us willing to learn let us be willing to be quiet and shut our mouths and listen and listen i need to do better than that if you ever get married you're going to have to learn i'm not looking at my wife you're going to have to learn how to listen shame on us we don't listen very good well just turn up your hearing aid brother john you know i don't have a hearing aid i probably need one god give us a group of young people that live deeper and aren't a bunch of surface feeders forgive us if we've been lazy forgive us if we're proud for or sarcastic i'm coming into your prayer life these are things that at the end of the service when they close that you just kind of bow your head and say i'm just going to linger here for a minute lord forgive me for being lazy forgive me if i've been sarcastic forgive me if i've been rude and hasty and arrogant lord forgive me if i've been a bad dude with a bad attitude and i hope my three year old grandson ain't listening we have this little phrase he's a cool dude with an attitude and then he started saying it i said lord forgive me i finally changed it to he's a great big man with a great big plan because he's going around he's a cool dude with a manitou we influence one another i'm like oh lord forgive me jesus isn't it great to serve the lord [Applause] and so i did a little video clip of him watching the service the other night and brother john's over here talking about you got shoes i got shoes yeah oh god and he i get a little video of my three year old grandson sitting at the table watching and laughing he just enjoys i praise god hallelujah we all girls got sandals boys got shoes right no nice sandals birkenstock i know sister your goodness is i don't know my neither don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplexed the last generation that'll ever be on the earth is sinful adulterous full of petrified source oh everything that's been decent has become indecent this is your prophet is that true national politics filth nations are broke up way back in the jungles of africa and safari hunters they had to take high-powered radios to hear elvis presley pat boone and them guys with that rock and roll and the twist and the natives trying to see them act along jerking jerking their head and acting like that the natives stood and looked at him but you see they're not americans like pat boone and elvis presley and ricky nelson amen and i'm trying to think of some popular singers you know justin bieber and whoever he thinks he's a christian he's deceived if he's going to be in the rapture and in heaven right beside you then why would god hold you to another standard if all the women in the world that wear pants earrings and this live a lot and smoke i had a manager one day when when i was younger she smoked she wore pants cut hair and everything i'm going to heaven she said i know i'm going to heaven if that's what we believe then why do we hold such a standard why is there such a holiness it's because not all those people that say they're going to heaven are going to heaven and even people with dresses and long hair and if our attitude stinks and uh and our spirit's wrong we're not going to the rapture either so it's not how you dress and what you do but if you have the holy spirit it'll come out in your dress so they're not americans like these other things but they're not judases of that type but they're see it's a spirit he's putting his finger right on it it's a spirit and the spirit is not only in america this is 1965. the spirit is not only in america it's been spread itself out over the world to bring them to the battle of armageddon now if that's true on the negative what about the positive can god do something that's global it's a global wave it's a global revival you're not an elite group because you're in america i'm sorry i'm really sorry we're not elitist hey amen i got about half of you with me america is not the promised land and the american dream yep it's had a huge pin put in the bubble the economy the you talk about a little virus has shut down the world and not just churches shut down stadiums amen so you think oh man it's getting a degree it's making money yeah a lot of those people just sat at home and collected unemployment or whatever it's more of jesus we need if it's gone global in the negative then there's a global revival happening amongst the message young people they act like that whatever nation they come from africa india wherever it is that vulgar and stuff that's a lot of stuff when the lord comes don't worry about your stuff that's luke 17. jesus said don't go back and get your stuff remember lot's wife she looked back she wanted to cut her hair she wanted to be part of a society she thought she could wear those kind of skirts and get away with it and she didn't know that the pages of adultery that she's going to stand at the day of judgment of of people that have committed adultery with i've never committed adultery with that person but you did and the only way to erase those pages is to ask god to forgive you and put it under the blood that's the only way you can be saved i know i'm long this morning but if the blood covered every single person wouldn't that be fantastic wouldn't that be great if the death angel came through beaufort and just passed over pass over when i see the blood i'll pass over you because the pentecostal church and these other churches there they they quit after a certain time and they go out and they're smoking out back the young girls and they're just running off doing this and that yeah we got them all fooled yeah yeah yeah and they're going on a fast track in the wrong direction thank god for conviction thank god for a mom or dad that will say just a second here you know some of you need to go back home and say mother i love you father i love you pastor i love you thank you for providing for us i know this is really deep but don't stumble over the simplicity it's been spread all over the earth by just one man starting it negative one man started it so has the gospel and the power of god almighty god has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place hello everybody wake up everybody the separation time has now taken place where god is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church let me be part of the bride and the young people said let me part of the bride people and young adults are trying to find themselves say where is the real you i'm just trying to find the real me brother john who is the real you today people are dying for a little bit of love don't just run to your car after the service and get on out of here maybe you just need to shake hands with somebody i'm going to be praying for you brother thank you brother thank you sister just a kind word can heal a wound just a little bit of love stretched over maybe you saying i forgive you people want to be accepted people want to feel a part of something that's real and they they want to feel a part of something that's winning i wrote this in the last days coming into these meetings i'm going to say them before i close every person has been made to be part of something that's winning that's why they wear t-shirts property of blah blah blah and that's why they stand and cheer that's why they want to identify with a winner that's why they're attracted to sports that's why they are attracted to romance because they want love that's why people are attracted to social media and internet addiction they're it's like connected it's like we're connected it's because god has made you to feel connected to someone somewhere and you can be in your little room and feel like you're connected to so and so and so and so and i put out this and i'm going to the washroom i ate cheer and people want to post and people want to post and and they have a need to feel connected and they're not connected they're so socially um yes but they don't even know how to talk they try to go out and have a conversation they can't look you in the eye they're embarrassed you know they're looking buzz and they're so nervous and they got to get out of this it's because of internet social media and you don't even realize it's a side effect and they can't carry on a conversation and they're nervous and yeah okay we gotta go where you going i don't know i just gotta go and they rush by you and they'll drive really fast here and then you meet him at the red light you pull up and their truck is going [Music] and rocking it meet you at the next light is that true then you go to a restaurant and there's four people and they're all like this no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no what's on that device i always thought if someone from 300 years ago was resurrected and and looked at people on the airplanes or in their and they just caught a little video through their into their office and they've been sitting there in front of this object what is that thing i don't know but they've been looking at it for the last hour and 28 minutes oh what you know god must be talking to them they must be hearing from angels no they're watching a movie they're looking to enter wow that's pretty exciting it seems like they're always you know they're trying to cross the street and they're like [Applause] y'all know what i'm talking about and we're trying to have i'm watching and and we're having a meal and we're all together and there's a husband wife and children and they're all they got a little game boy wow they must be playing with angels that's about how foolish it is it would be like one of those martyrs that gave their life and they see some of us and what we do in our spare time i think we'd be embarrassed oh excuse me you know and yeah what was you saying and god bless you brother yeah i'm a young person from i gave my life i was under an anointing and we're not connected friends let's let's just admit some of us right we're so far down the road somebody tell us something like that we're off no i'm not addicted i'm not addicted what are you telling me i'm addicted i've only been on here for the last hour i'm gonna go up to my room and really text with somebody that loves me i mean don't you think i look so wonderful yes you do well my dad and my mom they just took away my cell phone you probably shouldn't have had one in the first place [Applause] well i better move along you know people that's why they're they want to be part of gangs because that makes them feel apart they want to feel part of a group they want to feel like they're important and they have an important part to fulfill wouldn't it be fantastic if we all changed our attitude and just felt like every person that we met today and this afternoon is very very important god bless you brother it's nice being with you this weekend god bless you brother what's your name god bless you brother nice having you i'm glad you all are sitting you're sitting on this section over here but that's fine god bless you sister hallelujah you're brave to be on the front row man god bless you if we just had a little bit more compassion and feeling you say brother john you're really strange no brother branham talked to his own wife like this and they were walking down the streets of of uh jeffersonville doing some shopping and and and then somebody walks by and sister bryan went like this smiled and hey that lady that lady she you didn't greet her she was wanting to greet i smiled at her oh man brother brown said what's wrong with a good handshake yeah give me some skin matthew's going to start that give me some skin a few months ago i was like we couldn't have had this a year ago this these meetings and and two months from now it might be shut down they talk about another wave or another variant but what's wrong with another wave of the holy ghost just another wave another way another way so it's time for us to go brother jason's already back there he's already supporting me i told the brothers in the booth start going like this he said i would never do that oh okay so this weekend i introduced you to this place that one year ago this coming week my mother and father's anniversary i took them to olive garden i mean maybe this is for you brother rhett and i we're at the olive garden and i looked across and saw this place and i started to read care and the wound healing center the wound healing center the wound healing center huh and i thought that's amazing do you mean the people in the world have a place that people can go to when they got wounds and from that time be healed and i started to think of young people in the message is there a place that young people can go to to be healed and notice the title healing wound healing we're not here to puncture your wounds and punched at your bruises i'm not here jesus's ministry was is to help those that had been bruised the wounded you all know luke i think it's luke i've come to the brokenhearted that's the ministry of jesus your heart's broken i wish i had another service a broken heart a person can literally die of a broken heart physically die because their heart's broken his broken heart but we don't have another service but if that's you this morning god will give you a new heart and a new spirit and brother jason found out a few weeks ago he could have kept living his life thinking everything's okay even though i'm breathing a little bit kind of i can't even hardly wha but if he wouldn't have had some help this church might be without him being the assistant pastor he could have been gone and sister debbie we could have been visiting a a neighborhood cemetery and maybe brother matthew would have been the pastor but god rich in mercy had a doctor that was trained to put in a splint and allow that blood to flow and that heart can beat and he can walk and he can breathe and he can be your pastor a pastor that would invite us all to come this weekend and be supporting us and cheering us on thank you jesus and i thought if someone in the world can have a wound healing center what what about the young people in the message that are wounded i'm not talking about pediatrics and the birthing center that's another subject i'm talking about young people that need healing in another area brother brothers brother john has come here this weekend with that in our hearts i hope you understand and as i was reminded of this and i looked across the parking lot i thought surely lord you have something for the young people of the message that they can be healed of their wounds healed of deep wounds scars that happen and things that have been said and things that have people that's walked away from the message and then they make big declarations by the way that a lot of those came from a church that that we're right close to our church the song leader the the leaders of they oh i'm not even going to give them credit by giving their website but they've turned anti-message and even people in this city that used to follow the prophet william branham have walked away because of an influence from thousands of miles away it's what i just read a few minutes ago about it's a spirit and it wasn't a few thousand miles ago wait it was from the pit of hell and it has tried to destroy some of you it's put a question in your mind that's right it's made some of you have to challenge and even ministers take whole series to try to def and hear what i am to say today you don't want those people's private life you don't want to be married to them you don't want to be their son or their daughter because i can tell you where they're at today they have gone more crazy than just no people that's out in the world that you'd say that's a normal person out in the they've gone further than that i'm just giving a testimony if that's where you want to go you're just dabbling off this and that no you're feeding from some fruits that have a lot of sin behind it no they'd never tell you we found jesus we've never been so free they're free to do whatever they want to do just like every single person here but i'm happy to be a prisoner of jesus christ don't worry i'm already part of the hall of shame so i don't need to be embarrassed about being on the internet and here you see stages of people after a wound and if you tried to shake hands with this person today on the left it'd be blood oh it's tender ooh brother sorry and volleyball yesterday you know but you just let some time go by god will heal that i i was able to look into someone's eyes this morning and say i understand what they're going through because i do understand where someone else that hasn't gone through that i'm praying for you brother and i hope the lord but but when you've experienced that kind of pain amen scars scars that happen it's only evidence and this is where when our brother stood over here and gave that little short word about the song of uh scars what was the title again he'll say it out loud did you really say that sing that heal the wound but he'll what he'll heal the wound but are you really serious you're willing to have a scar the rest of your life you think i'm talking to them i'm having them repeat it for you some of us i don't want that scar brother i don't want that to happen i live my life i'd rather stay in my room because there could be an accident there could be something happen you could get a sickness well if that's how you're going to live can god really use you it's time to have faith and get out of your cave and go serve the lord die on the front lines say that's misaligned faith no it's not that's holy ghost revival that's what evan roberts had that's what seth joshua was preaching at the convention bend me lord ben bend us lord that's why he's appearing to us in this meeting and so that somebody would go home and look down at their scar and instead of saying ah they're saying oh god to god be the glory use this for your glory lord use the scar use this incident i don't know why it happened i don't want it to happen again but can you use this for me to touch somebody else lord because it's something that happened in the past but it didn't take your life you're still here today do i have an audience that's alive it's breathing then you're not part of that young lady that drank too much last night and crashed on her way home flipped upside down she's gone today you were in a holy ghost field meeting you thought you're in bondage you thought your brother john is just being funny holding you till you know 10 o'clock 11 o'clock what are we standing here people's coming let's just go well maybe god spared you from a drunk driver our precious prophet was taken by a drunk driver amen if he would have just went to the restroom at denny's that his family ate their last meal together brother branham didn't feel to eat that last meal and he just got in the car and drove and billy paul passed his father then here comes a card that it's getting toward evening time and brother billy paul thought it was maybe a morning a motorcycle because it's just one light coming down and and he didn't realize it's a headlight out on the driver's side i mean and he swerved around and and then all of a sudden and he looks in his rearview mirror that's dad that's your prophet you see that couldn't have happened our prophet not not all mangled up and i've seen the car all mangled up and and brother brad i'm pinned under there and she's gone she's gone mother's gone just reach my hand over so i can touch her do you all know that happened and where's my hair billy get my hair piece you say the paramedics are coming the please get my hair piece i don't want to be seen like this he's about he's in trouble and trauma and he's thinking about his hair piece you say oh so so vain you're the same i'm the same we think about our looks and how we present it's not unrighteous he's in the last hours of his life he wasn't even going to live another week amen i don't know why i'm saying this but it's scars it's wounds it's things that happened and let me just say this to clarify brother branham was not killed by a drunk driver it was god's will that he go at that time because if he would still be alive today and in jeffersonville there'd be a stadium that would seat 180 000 and we'd all be living there wanting to see brother branham wheeled out on a wheelchair that's how we all are i don't want to offend nobody but god took his prophet so that we could have a church in beaufort church in florida church in georgia church in north carolina church and so these scars is something that's happened in your life but it didn't take your life and these burns that happen in issues and it might take 120 days it might take four months for you to come out of this brother i'm not going to stand here and lie to you but greater is he that's going to be in you now than he that's in the world we're not trying to mind over matter throwing out the cigarettes and watching the fence post that go by so that tomorrow when i have the urge i'm gonna come back and get because i paid 5.88 cents plus tax for that brother no it's saying god take this desire out of my life give me a nature like yours lord bend me lord give me a love for your word that's greater than these other things it's not out it's not complicated this you that came forward last night a lot of you if you noticed brother john said that it's not complicated right we me we we just think it's not complicated sim just believe god's word drink and push out keep drinking the word and push out so here this morning as we close it's time to leave the wound healing center you visited there friday night saturday we're about to leave this afternoon and say goodbye but for some of you you really need to hear these closing remarks so i'm going to give them to you you've had your time god spoke to you that he understands but you cannot live at the wound healing center amen you can't stay there forever sister brother you've been kind of sequestered kind of pulled out and god gave you meetings like this don't go back home and get in the same ditch you can't rent a room in this place you can't lease a room there you can't buy a floor at this address i'm i'm talking seriously and since then my wife and i drove by they're just the uh they've taken down that care part they've moved away from this medical group that was called care i don't know why i just gave you some information it's still the wound healing center but i'm glad god never takes away the care but there has to be time that you went in there with a need you talked to the receptionist you walked down the the hallway you got embarrassed with the nurse they put on a little gown you had to talk to a doctor about your private life he listened he looked at the chart he talked to you privately he left the room you put your clothes back on you got to walk out the door can you help me close you got to walk out of the door put your clothes back on you might cry a little bit it might hurt your feelings that he said you need to exercise more you need to get more sleep and rest and stop staying up till two in the morning it's killing you and you wake up with a headache i'm gonna give you a big mystery and unveil it you need to drink more water i'm serious it's huge brother john has prayed for thousands of people headaches migraine headaches let's just go to first base drink some more water today i know that's deep and that's not out of the seventh seal page 847 but drink some more water i don't know where that comes from sometimes you know but it's time for some of you to leave it's time for some of you to know that your your calling and position in life cannot be the address of this wound healing center that's across the parking lot from olive garden that brother john looked across and saw this brother jason and i said immediately i thought about our young people and i thought if they can have a whole place like that what about us in the message why can't our churches why can't we give our young people some healing but you you got to leave this place brother john can't be your father you don't want my burdens amen you have to say that's not my calling to go in there and stay in there the rest of my life just give me a room in here because everybody in here cares and knows and give me medicine and whether you have scars and even this morning this afternoon whether you are healed from that scar or whether you you don't get the answer for the rest of your life you must be willing to go forward and live the rest of your life for christ regardless of what's happened in your past my past will not dictate my future i refuse god gives you an experience you talk to the doctor the bill is paid just a paid in full by the blood of the lamb you're not gonna get a six thousand dollar bill no it's paid just go and do what the doctor said [Music] i i i had in my notes to deal with anxiety so i dealt with it last night a little bit in nervousness was that okay i i felt led this weekend to speak about that healing is in the body god has wonderfully made the body to restore itself it's going to be okay and if it's not okay in this life god's going to give you a new body if everything that's been wrong in your life is twisted and messed up don't you worry god's doing something when we get to heaven it won't even come in your mind isaiah said the former thing shall not be remembered or come into mind amen well what about my friends and what about this it won't even come in your mind if they're not a predestinated part of god's mind you won't even think about it oh brother john when we're gonna sit at the marriage supper and be crying and weeping it's because my friend didn't make it that's not tears the bible's not talking about tears that my friend missed it it's gonna be tears of joy that you made it and that friend that person won't even come into your mind that trouble that you're dealing with today and your soul like this about and you just need to go like this and let it go it won't even be in your mind then there's no work over there there's no school over there there's no bills over there there's no pain over there i don't know about scars jesus even when he was changed he showed thomas his scars so i don't understand all that and i don't need to know y'all remember thomas unless i see the scars brother unless you show me unless you show me the side where the spear went in i'm not going to believe it i love all you people but i've got to have a personal revelation myself unless i see the scars on his hand i'm not going to believe so jesus you know he's just like jesus he appears in the next service and the disciples and people he just appears in the room and he just walks over to brother thomas god bless you brother how you doing what's your name stand up here brother emmanuel for the next uh 45 seconds you're thomas how you doing thomas and all the other believers are in the room and jesus just walks over to thomas and says hey thomas look he didn't say thomas you have so embarrassed me emmanuel the whole church knows that you said that unless you see the scars and i'm not going to show you you're the last person you didn't even believe me you're not my disciple indeed come on over here and i'm gonna sit down you know i'm gonna read your journal i'm not gonna read your journal she put her hand right on them and and thomas thomas stand up over there emmanuel and thomas you know she believed she she believed she put her hand on her journal when i took it she didn't want me to read her journal i'm not going to read her journal because you're not supposed to read a girl's journal don't forget that oh so thomas you know i'm going to talk to her because she's a real believer over here she's so sweet and you know what you told everybody you posted it in fact that you're not you're you're not going to believe until you have this happen in your life so i'm marking your name off my disciples just sit down no stand up i'm not being double-minded i'm just no jesus comes over to thomas says god thomas look at you look here bro just take my hand look at that those are for you those scars thank you so now here's thomas do you think he just felt like embracing him my disciple emanuel was like you know what i can love a person like that you know what i'm going to give my life for you you'll love me like that in spite of my unbelief i'm gonna serve you the rest of my life god bless you brother [Applause] because as we go home this afternoon this is what satan wants to do to all of us he's trying to jump on us gang up on us and what they're doing is they'll bite the back flanks of the big animal it could weigh more than them but they if they can just get this animal bleeding that's why i circled that and they jump on the back of these and they'll jump on the back of elephants they're trying to get them unstable because if they can get this elephant on its side and start going for the juggler within moments it's gone huge animals huge and it'll go for the juggler and it'll just latch right on and they'll shake and shake and all they're doing is just shaking more and it's not long and on the bottom photo what this uh animal will do it'll run behind someone and then it'll flick out its paw like that while it's running and that animal will topple after running running running running satan's got you alone you're wounded you're out by yourself and then he starts running after you the devil's after and then he's go and he'll just and then before you know it you're tumbling tumbling your head is hitting your ears your your brain and then just tumbling tumbling and then that and it'll go over a latch a hold of your throat and gasping and gasping and spiritually that's what a lot of people become they've become a product of satan and they'll run around in the field and they he's got you he's got you he's coming after you you need some help and this is what's called the hamstrings on the back of you he'll get the hamstrings and brother branham said the hamstrings is your prayer life and he'll grab your hamstrings so then i got my arms i got my i i got my feet i'm so strong i'm so able to do things and satan's going for your hamstrings your prayer life and this is like a a night vision camera took these photos of this deer and the wolves and the coyotes they got them going in circles and they bite at their flanks and they bite it there because this is a sensitive part and they're biting at the hamstrings and they're biting that in that tail in the backside then they get so weak and they lose their blood they start losing the life and then they fall down and those wild dogs and coyotes and those just start pulling out they literally pull out the intros of the animal while it's still alive they say oh brother john change the picture that's what he's doing to young people he's literally pulling out the insides and they're living they're smiling give me a starbucks what kind of drink you all like and stuff chick-fil-a ain't open on sunday so it'll be you know burger whatever and let's live life yes and their inside just being pulled out bloody bloody and this animal majestic animal it died and don't forget about the forest fires that happen this is your life can you go back brothers yeah there it is and that five-year knot you all remember that i know friday night was a long time ago look at that it was a five-year knot count the line and it's something that happened in your life that whenever it comes around to that you remember you remember and it's a knot but it didn't kill you there's life after the knot i felt to say that to you there's rings after the night there's rings after the forest fire there's rings after the scar can you all see the rings dry years wet years there's rings there's there's things that happen to all of us and our closing quote here maybe our musicians could just come from christ as the ministry and our singing team christ is the mystery of god revealed all of this mystery is revealed as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it are you standing on it today don't be distracted here that's her stand why do you hunger church why are you thirsty it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you i wonder if we can all pray together lord don't let anything take it out of me [Music] we're just closing up some loose ends now lord don't let anything take it out of me we've gone too far now some of you are down the road and you've gone through a lot of battles we're too far we're way over on this side amen amen you have more to lose now than if you would have walked away five years ago because we might not have another six months three months does anybody do y'all recognize worth the end times [Applause] so if you gave up this next week you have lost more you've lived your life you tried to be holy you tried to live sane tried to walk the walk and you sang you went you were there and then you just i'm done i'm done you have lost more i think the lord's presence has been so good to us why are you hungry and why are you thirsty you let so many things get it out of us our job your wife your husband your children cares of the world let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsty you're hungry our last line it's god trying to reveal it to you see the revelation god's not trying to hold it back from any person here there's no good thing that god's trying to keep from any person god's not he doesn't do that to his children he's like this he's saying whatever you need whatever you ask just ask just ask say i don't know if i can ever be no you can you can be even stronger you can take that weakness and take that scar for the glory of god hallelujah and god can remove the scars also he's great and fantastic as i've heard the testimony that's why the world wants to tattoo all up their bodies and stuff god's not into that he wants you to be pure and holy and give your life while you're young why you're youthful let's stand to our feet like an army lord give me passion give us youth with passion give us youth that have a love for christ make me that way lord make me that way lord as brother michael is going to sing with us now let let me be a youth of this generation let's walk out of these doors this afternoon like we're under a commission like we've been charged open up your paper for the next week and god's given you a charge he's given you your assignment live for him don't be ashamed even if you stand alone god will honor your life and he might be so wonderful like you did the three hebrew children he said i'm going to come down there and stand with them to where even an ungodly king says my the form of the fourth man is like the son of god praise god would you all like that or even the world has to testify there's something different about that group heavenly father flow through us this afternoon again we've lingered and we've been long this morning when we woke up and even last night we didn't want to be long we didn't want to go through all the notes again and repeat and repeat but something kept being a witness there's going to be somebody there sunday morning that hasn't been at the other meetings and they need to hear it so lord i was obedient to that we took a few extra minutes and even this morning you were as a witness to our hearts that there's going to be some here in the service that need to hear what we heard

a person who's half committed or just coming in to say something that would tickle your ears but this brother was fully committed to this meeting with his whole heart with his whole body his whole soul his whole mind he was all 100 percent as if he took on a bethel tabernacle shirt and put it on and said i'm not i'm not coming just to assist i'm right part of this team and he supported it with prayers hallelujah amen [Music] amen he's he's poured his whole heart into it for weeks you know praying and just stirring asking god to move upon you move upon the services and he you've seen it you've seen it on display here over the last three weeks the last three services you've had a you've had a servant and you've had a man who's just moved himself out of the way forgot about us anybody

back behind that brother john that was the holy spirit that's because what you said the lord told you confirmed it to my heart as i was sitting there and brother john's going over some of the things he spoke friday some of the things he spoke saturday the holy spirit has dropped in my heart and said someone's here maybe one maybe two maybe more that wasn't here couldn't be a part and i got to say something to them so if that's you who the holy spirit was speaking to i just want to say be sensitive to what the spirit said amen get what god's wanting to give you this morning you know we're we're

heart we're not hey we came all this way had these meetings no sense in being in a rush if if not that's fine but if you got something on your heart maybe someone that was praying and saying maybe brother matt or brother jono and make another another invitation i believe when a young person comes to the altar god blesses you especially because that's a hard thing to get out of your seat and break past your complexes and your anxiety and and all of your doubts so if god's dealt with your heart this morning i want to sing it one more time and give that opportunity that's fine if no one
