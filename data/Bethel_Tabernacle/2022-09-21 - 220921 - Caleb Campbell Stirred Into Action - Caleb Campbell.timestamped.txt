[4:45] we don't even know how to pray or what
[4:47] to pray but Romans 8:26 will say that
[4:50] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[4:53] infirmities for we know not what we
[4:55] should pray for as we ought but the
[4:57] spirit itself maketh intercession for us

[5:07] amen and as Pastor was saying the other
[5:09] day the Bible tells us when we pray that

[5:13] Ephesians 6:18 says praying always with
[5:15] all prayer and supplication in the
[5:17] spirit watching there unto with all
[5:19] perseverance and supplications for All
[5:21] Saints amen amen I W
[5:25] to by the help of the Lord I want to go
[5:27] into Acts chapter 12 and I W to
[5:30] read a little bit about what happened
[5:32] when Saints pray in the spirit amen here
[5:35] in Acts we can turn in our Bibles acts
[5:37] the 12th
[5:39] chapter we read of at this time Herod
[5:42] what what the king at this time was
[5:44] grandson to the Herod the Great was
[5:47] seeking after Fame in verse 1 and two it
[5:51] says that he took the sword and he
[5:53] killed James and martyred him and seeing
[5:56] that that action had pleased his F
[5:58] followers it pleased pleased them
[6:00] pleased the Jews in verse three he
[6:02] proceeded further to take Peter also and
[6:06] when he had apprehended him he put him
[6:08] into prison and delivered him into four
[6:11] quadrants quadrant of soldiers to keep
[6:14] him intending after Easter to bring him
[6:16] forth unto the people amen while while
[6:20] he was in prison while Peter was in the
[6:21] prison during this trial it says that
[6:23] the church was in constant prayer to God
[6:26] for him in verse five he was so bound
[6:29] with shackles in verse 6 that said it
[6:32] said Herod kept him so completely bound
[6:35] that scripture says that he was bound
[6:37] not with one but with two chains between
[6:39] two soldiers and with even more soldiers
[6:42] guarding the prison doors so Shackled In
[6:44] this trial that there was no way out
[6:47] there wasn't even a chance for him to
[6:49] get free one commentator writes he says
[6:52] Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers
[6:54] bound with two chains Roman prisoners
[6:56] had a chain fastened at one end to the
[6:58] wrist of their right hand and at the
[6:59] other to the wrist of the Soldier's left
[7:01] hand leaving the right arm of the keeper
[7:04] free in case of any attempt to escape
[7:07] for greater the security the prison was
[7:09] sometimes as here chained to two
[7:11] shoulders on each side the enemy always
[7:13] thinks he's got a firm grasp on you amen
[7:16] he'll try to chain you up on both sides
[7:18] he'll put guards at every single stop
[7:21] but but the fragrance of those sweet
[7:23] prayers broke into another atmosphere
[7:25] amen the constant prayers that were
[7:27] being offered up it put the angel of the
[7:30] Lord into action that night Hallelujah
[7:32] it says that the angel struck his side
[7:35] in verse 7 waking him
[7:38] only the light of Deliverance Shone
[7:41] brightly amen and when those words that
[7:43] were spoken by the angel he says arise
[7:46] quickly make haste Peter we're breaking
[7:49] you free from this trial we're breaking
[7:51] you free from this prison but we're on
[7:54] the enemy's territory so we must move
[7:57] quickly make haste Saints
[8:00] oh my it takes a purpose-driven faith
[8:02] amen the angel says listen You'll Be
[8:05] Free but it's not a time to mess
[8:09] around it's not a time to keep those
[8:11] carnal things in your life it says to
[8:14] make haste and keep your eyes fixed on
[8:16] this light Amen on this Vision follow me
[8:20] stay close there isn't time to slack
[8:22] Hallelujah wow we are living in brother
[8:25] brother Jason was saying we are living
[8:27] in the time of all things Hallelujah and
[8:29] it's time time to arise and to do it
[8:31] quickly as he says to make haste and to
[8:33] have your purpos driven Faith Hallelujah
[8:37] good amen with your eyes on that light
[8:39] Peter thought he was in a vision in
[8:40] verse 9 verse 11 it says by the time
[8:43] that he had escaped he came to himself
[8:45] he realized that he was delivered
[8:48] Hallelujah he was supernaturally
[8:49] delivered from this if you go to verse
[8:52] 12 and it says while they were lifting
[8:55] up their prayer for Peter a little old
[8:58] Believer by the name of sister Roa heard
[9:00] that knock of the door you know these
[9:02] were the these were the Saints that had
[9:04] prayed in the upper room these were the
[9:07] Saints that had a Pentecostal experience
[9:09] I believe that that night they were
[9:10] praying in the spirit amen I believe
[9:13] that they weren't just they weren't just
[9:15] Lon around they were praying with
[9:17] Earnest faith that Peter needed a
[9:21] deliverance and they were praying with
[9:23] an expectation that no matter what
[9:25] happened to him that God was in control
[9:27] of the situation and just at that time
[9:30] that they were praying at the very time
[9:32] that they were praying she the a knock
[9:34] comes on the door amen Oh Sister Roa she
[9:38] she heard that knock on the door and
[9:40] before that she even opened the door she
[9:42] recognized The Voice Hallelujah who's
[9:46] recognized The Voice tonight oh praying
[9:49] for his Deliverance through the night I
[9:50] can just think of it there Saints she
[9:53] was too excited to even open up the door
[9:56] that she ran back in the house
[10:00] she didn't even open the door she
[10:01] interrupted the very prayer that they
[10:03] were currently praying for Peter at the
[10:05] time yeah and they couldn't even they
[10:07] couldn't hardly believe it the Saints
[10:09] the Saints they were they thinking that
[10:10] she was mad and after listening and
[10:12] insisting they all concluded that it was
[10:14] the spirit of Peter Hallelujah my
[10:17] goodness we ought to we ought to Just
[10:19] Praise when our prayers are answered for
[10:21] it is our creator responding to our
[10:23] needs and he finds it important enough
[10:26] to supernaturally react sure Prayer
[10:30] Changes Things friends I'm just building
[10:32] something up I just want to build your
[10:33] faith up for a minute my what a
[10:36] testimony but Peter said to keep silent
[10:38] he said keep this testimony quiet he
[10:41] said the enemy can't find my whereabouts
[10:43] oh my goodness I can just imagine sister
[10:45] roota there that night and he she tells
[10:47] us that tells him that and how can I
[10:50] keep quiet the very thing that I was
[10:52] praying for you you're you knocked at
[10:55] the door how do you expect me to keep
[10:56] quiet Hallelujah
[11:00] how many times friends when we were yet
[11:02] offering up a fragrance of prayer a
[11:05] fragrance of a Deliverance a fragrance
[11:07] of something that we needed in our life
[11:09] he is yet sending his Angel down to
[11:12] Deliver us from our enemy am amen what a
[11:15] stir it caused Hallelujah in verse 18
[11:17] and as much of a stir that was happening
[11:20] with those Believers the next scripture
[11:22] goes on to say that a stir actually was
[11:25] caused among the soldiers can you
[11:27] imagine these soldiers that were
[11:28] literally chain to this man now we're
[11:30] still sitting there they woke up the
[11:32] next morning and they're still in
[11:34] bondage they're still in Chains but the
[11:36] one that their prisoner the one that
[11:38] they were watching out for was no longer
[11:41] even there he had gotten out of their
[11:43] guard he had gotten out of the the the
[11:46] insurmountable odds that were all around
[11:48] him Hallelujah can you imagine
[11:51] Hallelujah can you imagine the stir
[11:54] among the ranks of hell when you break
[11:57] free from a trial when you break free
[12:00] from a Deliverance when you come to
[12:02] something in your life and that hedge is
[12:04] dropped
[12:05] Hallelujah glory to God I can just
[12:08] imagine those Devils oh man the devil
[12:11] would just have a chain he'll have these
[12:13] his little demon minions chained to you
[12:15] and he'll have every everything around
[12:17] you in every way possible and then one
[12:20] day he he realizes how did you get free
[12:23] it doesn't even make any sense I've
[12:25] built these Hedges I've built every
[12:26] single thing but how did you get free
[12:29] glory to God I'll venture to say that
[12:31] it's similar to what had happened here
[12:35] hallelujah oh glory to God oh there is
[12:40] thinking there isn't any way of Escape
[12:42] then one day he wakes up and realizes
[12:46] you've escaped glory to God I pray we
[12:47] can be encouraged in that tonight
[12:49] Hallelujah more than once my brother my
[12:53] sister more than once you've caused a
[12:56] stir and I'm talking to each and every
[12:59] one of you tonight who claims to be a
[13:02] Christian who claims to be a believer of
[13:03] this message who claims to have the Holy
[13:06] Ghost because you have that possession
[13:08] within your heart he said once you have
[13:11] caused a stir and I want you to have I
[13:13] want you to put yourself into this you
[13:15] have caused a stir among the ranks of
[13:18] Hell by the word of your testimony
[13:20] Hallelujah we all remember the story we
[13:23] remember the story of Paul and Silas
[13:25] friends and we remember that they were
[13:26] just in prison they were in bondage that
[13:29] night and you know they they the
[13:32] scripture doesn't really talk about this
[13:33] but I can just imagine the Mind battles
[13:34] that were going through their mind I can
[13:36] just imagine the oppression on the walls
[13:38] of those prison just bearing down on
[13:40] them they everything was against them
[13:42] they had insurmountable odds but what
[13:44] happened they just began to lift up
[13:46] their praises to God they began to do
[13:49] the only thing that they really could do
[13:51] it says that they began to pray and to
[13:53] begin to praise begin to worship God and
[13:56] their their atmosphere was changed
[13:59] Hallelujah the they were Shackled to
[14:01] their circumstance and their trials
[14:04] bound up Hallelujah but they just had
[14:07] their only defense that was praise glory
[14:09] to God praise changes
[14:12] things Prayer Changes Things Hallelujah
[14:16] am notice in both of those scripture
[14:20] circumstances in both of those
[14:23] times they were not alone when they were
[14:26] doing that it wasn't anything one that
[14:29] they could do of their own power of or
[14:31] of their own will Hallelujah it was
[14:33] something that was placed within their
[14:35] hearts within their souls it was the
[14:37] spirit of God that was just crying out
[14:40] Hallelujah and all they could do was
[14:43] surrender Hallelujah but they Wen
[14:45] strengthened by one another Hallelujah
[14:47] it seems to be a theme when I when the
[14:50] Lord just put something Upon My Heart
[14:52] Lord to to to be in one mind and one
[14:54] Accord with one another because it's
[14:56] important that we bind together in
[15:00] prayer we're strengthened by one another
[15:02] Hallelujah I was listening to a sermon
[15:05] brother Jack duve not too long ago and
[15:06] he began to to to minister began to
[15:08] describe what Belgian horses and I found
[15:11] out I did some research found out
[15:13] historically they were used as a work
[15:15] horse they were used for farmwork and
[15:17] plowing and an amazing thing is is one
[15:19] horse by itself can pull 8,000 lbs that
[15:23] is four tons by itself Hallelujah but
[15:26] interestingly enough when they began to
[15:28] work together they don't just carry if
[15:30] you put two together they don't just
[15:32] carry 16,000 lb a pair of them when
[15:35] trained together can carry up to 32,000
[15:40] lbs that is quadruple just them by
[15:44] themselves friends Hallelujah there is
[15:46] something in having in one being in one
[15:49] in mind in one Accord Hallelujah when we
[15:52] pray when we pray we carry a heavy
[15:56] load when we earnestly earnestly lift
[16:00] our voices to praise thanks bro Atmos
[16:03] atmospheres can
[16:05] shift but when we enter in together how
[16:08] much more can those strongholds be
[16:10] broken Amen on glory to God when they
[16:14] are put into action in one mind and one
[16:16] Accord
[16:18] Hallelujah brother Brenham picks this up
[16:20] in
[16:23] uh what message is this I have heard but
[16:26] now I see he says in order to stay stay
[16:29] with God stay gentle God is gentle in
[16:31] order to stay with God stay with love
[16:33] God is love stay Meek not never be
[16:37] self-sufficient always rely upon him
[16:39] never use your own mind take his
[16:42] thoughts Hallelujah let his thoughts be
[16:45] your thoughts and take them into your
[16:47] carnal mind Hallelujah and repeat them
[16:50] over and over and say oh God take all of
[16:53] my doubt away Lord Oh Lord take all of
[16:56] my let all my thoughts be your thoughts
[16:58] and you sick people do is we're speaking
[17:01] just take away Cast Away the thought of
[17:03] sickness take God's healing thoughts and
[17:06] let them excuse me let them become your
[17:08] thought hallelujah amen we ought to say
[17:11] that tonight oh God take away all of my
[17:13] doubt and let all of my thoughts be your
[17:15] thoughts amen hallelujah if we're
[17:17] standing in need tonight of a
[17:19] Deliverance maybe it's a healing maybe
[17:21] it's something spiritual in your life
[17:23] maybe it's a mind battle maybe it's an
[17:25] oppression but take those thoughts those
[17:28] healing thoughts Lord take all of my
[17:30] doubt away and fill me Lord
[17:33] hallelujah brother Brandon picks this up
[17:35] and he says think upon these things and
[17:36] the Bible said if there be any praise
[17:38] and if there be any virtue and what he's
[17:40] doing is he's referring to Philippians
[17:42] 4:8 where it says finally Brethren
[17:44] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[17:46] things are honest whatsoever things are
[17:48] just whatsoever things are pure
[17:50] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[17:52] things of are a good report if there be
[17:55] any virtue and if there be any praise
[17:58] think on on these things it says to
[18:00] think on these things friends there's
[18:02] going to be there's going to be mind
[18:04] battles that say that you're not
[18:06] delivered there's going to be things in
[18:07] your mind that say that you're not
[18:09] healed there's going to be times where
[18:11] it feels like you you're just you can't
[18:13] get over this but you think on these
[18:16] things you think on these Praises
[18:18] Hallelujah I've got a praise tonight I
[18:21] got to give a little testimony brother
[18:23] Jason Hallelujah I stood up here 15 16
[18:26] months ago and my first sermon I just
[18:29] claimed and I believed I had the healing
[18:31] in my stomach I had I went to the doctor
[18:33] and he told me he said oh you've got
[18:35] this and these pre pre cancerous cells
[18:37] were the words that he used and he said
[18:39] I want to see you every once in a while
[18:40] and I want to make sure that that they
[18:42] don't grow into anything more than what
[18:44] they are now and and he just he just
[18:46] basically just told me that this is what
[18:48] it was going to be and I declined that
[18:51] in my heart I declined it Hallelujah I
[18:54] declined those thoughts and for months
[18:57] and months I still had that I still had
[18:59] those those pains I still was not able
[19:02] to but Hallelujah I I got a phone call
[19:05] the other night I had a procedure done I
[19:07] had both endoscopy and I colonoscopy
[19:10] done hallelujah and to this day to this
[19:15] day he said he called me two nights ago
[19:18] and he said that we did three biopsies
[19:21] and everything that we found the last
[19:23] time is completely gone it's completely
[19:26] gone every I don't even want to see you
[19:28] anymore because it looks like a brand
[19:31] new stomach
[19:32] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[19:35] hallelujah my God is alive tonight if
[19:39] you have a need you find your promise in
[19:41] that book and you take a hold of it
[19:43] Hallelujah I apologize for my voice
[19:46] Hallelujah I have heard of it that thou
[19:48] would create squirrels I've heard of
[19:50] thee that thou would create a ram but
[19:52] now I see this is brother brandom and
[19:54] the rest of that quote th then the
[19:55] vision was made visible when God
[19:58] promised anything that's what he'll do
[20:02] Hallelujah that's what he'll do notice
[20:05] he says when you have a need perhaps
[20:07] like Joshua he had a need he never
[20:10] thought of the
[20:11] circumstance hallelujah oh the devil is
[20:15] always trying to get your vision on the
[20:17] circumstance he's always trying to keep
[20:19] your eyes fixed on what you can't do or

[23:51] new and the Old Testament and he sees
[23:54] every promise that he's made and Faith

[24:08] looks out yonder he keeps the Crosshair
[24:11] dead sinner of the word glory to God

[24:18] in a man that does those things it's not

[28:15] always and it did the work had ceased
[28:19] for years and
[28:21] years we read in Zechariah 4 if we want
[28:24] to turn in our Bible Zechariah 4 in
[28:27] verse one it says know this is about a
[28:29] vision that Zachariah has said now the
[28:30] the angel who talked with me came
[28:33] back amen we'll turn in our Bibles maybe
[28:36] if we can turn up there now the angel
[28:38] who talked with me came back and
[28:40] weakened me wakened me I'm sorry as a
[28:43] man who was wakened out of his sleep and
[28:45] he said to me what do you
[28:49] see so I said I am
[28:52] looking and there is a lampstand of
[28:55] solid gold with a bowl on top of it and
[28:58] on the stand seven lamps with seven
[28:59] pipes on the seven lamps two Olive
[29:01] treeses are by it one right by the bowl
[29:04] and the other on its left and I answered
[29:06] and spoke to the angel who talk to me
[29:08] saying what are these my Lord then the
[29:10] angel who talked with me answered and
[29:11] said do you not know what these things
[29:13] are and I said no my
[29:22] Lord amen I must have a different
[29:24] version but he said no my Lord and he
[29:26] answered and said this is the word of
[29:27] the Lord to zerubabel he says not by
[29:30] might nor by power but by my spirit
[29:35] saith the Lord then he says in verse
[29:37] seven he says who are you oh great
[29:39] Mountain before zerubabel you shall
[29:41] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[29:44] the capstones with shouts of Grace Grace
[29:48] to it the enemy stop the work with might
[29:52] and with power but it isn't going to be
[29:54] the same way when I come and finish the
[29:56] work it's going to be by my spirit
[29:58] Spirit sayith the
[29:59] Lord and when it's finished and this
[30:02] mountain that you're that you feel like
[30:04] is in front of you it will become a
[30:06] plain and it'll be my grace Hallelujah

[30:26] were stirred into action as we go to
[30:29] Hagi the first chapter is what we read
[30:32] in the at the beginning he says
[30:35] says the Lord stirred up the heart of
[30:38] zerubabel verse 14 I'm sorry let's read
[30:41] it off of here and the Lord stirred up
[30:44] the spirit of zerubabel the son of shiow
[30:47] governor of Judah and the spirit of
[30:49] Joshua the son of jehos the high priest
[30:52] and the spirit of all the remnant of the
[30:54] people and they came and did work in the
[30:57] house of the Lord of hosts their God
[31:00] their hearts were stirred the Lord
[31:02] caused a stir among the people that
[31:05] caused them to be put into action and it
[31:08] just it wasn't just on the priests it
[31:09] wasn't just on the leaders it wasn't
[31:11] just on it was on everybody Hallelujah
[31:14] it says the spirit of all the remnant of
[31:16] all the people and they came and worked
[31:18] on the house of the Lord
[31:21] hallelujah oh glory to
[31:24] God Amen is this all right tonight a
[31:27] little bible lesson I like I love I love
[31:29] the
[31:30] Bible we read of a familiar event that
[31:33] took
[31:34] place at the Battle of
[31:37] Jericho amen we can turn if we want to
[31:41] turn to Joshua 65 sorry brother Josh I'm
[31:44] giving you a little workout says Joshua
[31:47] 65 and when you hear the sound of the
[31:50] trumpet and all the people Shout with a
[31:53] great
[31:55] voice and the wall of the city shall
[31:58] fall down flat and the people shall
[32:00] Ascend up everyone on high right says
[32:03] that all the people shall Shout with the
[32:05] great shout and the wall of that City
[32:08] will fall down amen we're all familiar
[32:10] this is a Elementary story amen but I
[32:13] read the commentary on this and it says
[32:15] that this the shout of steadfast faith
[32:19] is in direct contrast to the moans of
[32:22] wavering faith and to the whales of
[32:26] discouraged heart wow
[32:29] Hallelujah contrasting here friends
[32:32] we're contrasting what those priests did
[32:34] and we're contrasting what these people
[32:36] did he says among the
[32:39] secrets among the secrets of the
[32:42] Lord I do not know of any more that is
[32:45] valuable more valuable than the secret
[32:47] of this shout of faith says the Lord
[32:51] said to Joshua see I have given thee
[32:53] into thine hand Jericho and the King
[32:56] thereof and the Mighty Men of valy
[32:58] and he has said I will give but I he
[33:00] didn't say I will give but he said I
[33:03] have given it belonged to them already
[33:07] and now they were called to take
[33:09] possession of it
[33:11] Hallelujah but the question was how
[33:15] right the question with us is always how
[33:17] are we going to do this it looked
[33:19] impossible but the Lord declared his
[33:22] plan as he always will maybe not to us
[33:26] sometimes but he always has a plan
[33:28] Hallelujah now no one can
[33:30] suppose this is still in that commentary
[33:32] no one can suppose for a moment that
[33:34] this shout caused the walls to fall but
[33:37] yet the secret of their Victory lay in
[33:40] this shout for it was the shout of a
[33:43] faith that
[33:45] dared on the authority of God's word
[33:49] alone to claim a promised Victory wow
[33:54] glory to God while as yet there were no
[33:58] signs of this Victory being accomplished
[34:01] and according to their faith God did
[34:04] unto them
[34:05] hallelujah oh and so when they shouted
[34:08] he made the walls to fall Hallelujah
[34:11] sometimes we just need to send a shout
[34:13] of Faith saying Lord I know I'm Healed
[34:16] Lord I know I'm delivered Lord I know
[34:19] that I've got these mistakes but you
[34:21] don't I've already I've already asked
[34:23] Lord Lord you've already placed them
[34:25] under the blood they in your Seas of
[34:28] forgetfulness
[34:29] Hallelujah glory to
[34:32] God sometimes it just takes a shout of
[34:35] Faith to dare to act on the authority of
[34:37] God's word amen and it was on the
[34:41] seventh day when they had had to get up
[34:44] out of bed when they had to get up out
[34:46] of maybe some discouragements when they
[34:48] had to get up out of this it was on the
[34:51] seventh day that their Victory would be
[34:53] made
[34:54] manifest glory to God is the seventh day
[34:59] now friends and it's time to turn our
[35:01] shouts to shouts of steadfast Faith

[36:32] try and keep the vessel quiet he knows
[36:35] that he he can't destroy the spirit he

[36:57] fellow a man doing not but good let him
[36:59] confess Christ as his Savior and
[37:01] acknowledge the operations of the gift
[37:03] of the holy spirit in tongues and
[37:04] prophecy and healing and miracles and he
[37:06] will be
[37:08] condemned oh but the spirit of this
[37:10] world hates the spirit of God because it
[37:13] can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it
[37:16] tries to destroy the vessel in whom the
[37:19] spirit of Truth dwells friends the
[37:22] spirit of Truth dwells within you so he
[37:25] is going to try to destroy Your Vessel
[37:28] and he's going to do everything he can

[43:09] God I've got your answer devil oh the
[43:14] devil's that's the reason he's howling
[43:16] brother Brandon picks up that's the
[43:17] reason he's howling the way he is his

[43:35] devil's
[43:36] answer Glory it's not me that liveth
[43:39] it's not me that does anything but it's
[43:42] Christ the word living in me it's not my
[43:45] idea it's his power it's not my idea
[43:48] it's his word oh he promised it here it
[43:52] is he said it would be here and here it
[43:54] is we got his answer I've got your
[43:57] answer devil Oh Glory to God Christ is
[44:01] risen and he's paid the price for our
[44:03] Redemption amen oh what God in Christ
[44:06] has manifested he gave that flesh and
[44:08] that blood and then that blood might
[44:10] come to life and that flesh be redeemed
[44:13] that God in his redeemed flesh could
[44:15] manifest his word for the day as he did
[44:18] in that day I believe he's manifesting
[44:21] his word in our day as he did in that
[44:23] day glory to God hallelujah here's your
[44:27] answer devil and in Mark 10 and
[44:31] 52 Mark 10 and
[44:36] 52 and Jesus said to him go thy way thy
[44:41] faith hath made the whole glory to God
[44:45] and immediately he received his sight
[44:47] and followed Jesus in the way I think
[44:50] this is such a beautiful scripture
[44:52] because it says your faith has made thee
[44:54] whole and now he's a follower of Jesus
[44:57] but before he was a follower of Jesus
[45:00] because something was yearning within
[45:02] his heart Jesus Son of David glory to
[45:07] God oh friends oh I just want you to
[45:10] stand with me tonight friends
[45:14] Hallelujah I believe that that same
[45:17] Jesus is on the scene
[45:20] tonight amen let's just raise our hands
[45:23] together I believe he's on the scene
[45:25] tonight sometimes I believe that it
[45:28] takes a steadfast shout of our

[45:34] stirred into action like blind barus was

[45:57] sometimes the spirit of the world or
[46:00] unbelief is hindering it from happening
[46:04] amen amen that happens to all of us the
[46:07] spirit of unbelief or the spirit of the
[46:08] world or or or just leosa it just it
[46:12] causes the unbelief to kind of overtake
[46:15] our
