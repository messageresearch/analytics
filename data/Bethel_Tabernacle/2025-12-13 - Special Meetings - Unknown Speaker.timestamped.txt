[32:32] Um I have a question.
[32:36] Uh how do you feel when somebody asks
[32:38] you to pray for something?
[32:41] Pray for them.
[32:43] I have several requests here.
[32:46] One is from uh brother Mark Lori for his
[32:49] [music] wife, sister Deborah. She's just
[32:52] really
[32:54] had that back thing and she's just going
[32:56] through a lot of pain and it's just
[32:58] [music] kind of
[33:00] it's a trial.
[33:03] So, she wants and I want Brother Mark
[33:06] wants God to move. Amen. [music] so that
[33:11] &gt;&gt; she can have a normal life and not have
[33:12] to deal with the pain and prescriptions
[33:14] and things like that. I actually have
[33:17] four more requests and I'm just going to
[33:19] read them out.
[33:22] This is from Sister Hope quick. Prayer
[33:25] request for Friday night service.
[33:26] [music] Please pray for a mother of
[33:28] three,
[33:30] Clara Shinda Wolf.
[33:34] Her third baby is a newborn. She has
[33:36] been having strange symptoms and a CAT
[33:38] scan revealed [music] a minor tear in
[33:42] the lining of her corateed artery.
[33:46] She is waiting on the results of an MRI
[33:48] to see if it has caused stroke or brain
[33:50] damage. She praises God [music] that so
[33:52] far everything seems mine, but requests
[33:54] prayer for stress levels, answered
[33:56] questions, [music] quick healing, and a
[33:59] clean MRI and a protection for the
[34:01] breastfeeding baby from the medication
[34:04] she [music] has to take.
[34:07] you know, I don't know how old this mom
[34:09] is. [music] She has a newborn.
[34:12] I'm just
[34:14] many years [music] before uh beyond
[34:17] that, I'm sure. So, she's still a young
[34:20] woman,
[34:21] three children from Sister Melissa
[34:24] prayer request. First, I would like to
[34:26] thank everyone [music] for your prayers
[34:27] for the teacher who has diagnosed with
[34:28] cancer.
[34:30] She is still in the midst of the trial
[34:32] [music] working.
[34:34] However, our prayers are working. When
[34:35] we last spoke, she said her latest scans
[34:38] were clear. Amen. Thank the Lord for
[34:40] that. And she may not have to do
[34:42] radiation. Her whole family is battling
[34:44] [music] a severe case of flu. Please
[34:46] have been cleared. Also, there's another
[34:49] teacher. She's in the hospital
[34:52] and currently in the hospital and
[34:54] doctors unsure the exact cause of her
[34:56] symptom. [music] She is miserable and
[34:58] unable to eat.
[35:01] The Tuesday and Wednesday coming are the
[35:02] midyear math tests. I pray all goes
[35:05] well. My class has shown so much growth,
[35:07] [music]
[35:08] but these tests many times don't show
[35:10] that growth. And she sister Melissa
[35:13] [music] would like to see that result
[35:16] come on the test. Also,
[35:19] here's another from Sister Amber [music]
[35:22] Smith.
[35:24] We have no choice but to get these at
[35:26] the beginning. So, never mind. That's
[35:28] that's brother Jason. Um, prayer
[35:31] request. Please remember my niece
[35:34] Nicole. Her blood pressure is high and
[35:36] the doctors are trying to figure out
[35:38] what's wrong. She has two small kids
[35:41] that [music] she has to take care of by
[35:43] herself. You know, I've um have
[35:46] experiences with wrong medications for
[35:49] high [music] blood pressure in my family
[35:51] and stuff like that. It's just it's kind
[35:54] of a practice to see what works. So,
[35:57] [music] we just want to pray that
[35:58] everything goes out comes out well and
[36:01] that she's able to take care of them
[36:02] little ones. Sister [music] Sarah Smith,
[36:04] a prayer request for brother Mark
[36:06] Buchanan.
[36:08] Mark Buchanan, he's in Flagstaff. He's
[36:10] who brother Kevin Smith worked for and
[36:13] um bless the Smith family very much.
[36:16] Help them come back full.
[36:20] He has uh with low oxygen level very
[36:23] much appreciated. Lord Jesus, help our
[36:25] brother. If you have a request upon your
[36:28] heart this evening,
[36:31] we all do. We all have desires and
[36:34] wants. He's the one that can fill them
[36:37] all. Let's pray.
[36:39] Father, you know how I [music] feel,
[36:42] Lord,
[36:43] when somebody asks me to pray for
[36:46] something. Father,
[36:48] how I long to be able to reach the
[36:51] throne of mercy with this request
[36:54] and that you [music] would hear and that
[36:56] you would work upon it, Father.
[36:59] So Lord, we pray for the mom with three
[37:01] little children.
[37:03] Father, I pray that you would heal the
[37:04] little tear. May they find nothing else
[37:06] wrong. May there be a [music] healing
[37:09] take place.
[37:11] And Father, we pray for Brother Mark's
[37:12] wife, Sister Deborah.
[37:15] Lord, it's [music] been a trial. I pray
[37:17] that you would bring deliverance in this
[37:19] trial, victory, Father.
[37:22] And Lord, we pray for Amber's niece,
[37:25] Nicole, with this blood pressure issue.
[37:29] Father, I pray that you would heal it in
[37:31] Jesus' name. Remember these two
[37:34] teachers, Father, one in the hospital,
[37:37] [music] one that's Father, battling
[37:39] cancer. Remember the students as they
[37:42] take their tests.
[37:44] Father, we love you and we know that we
[37:46] don't have [music] any other place to
[37:48] go, but ask that you would move upon
[37:51] these requests. Father, we pray that you
[37:53] would bless those that are streaming.
[37:54] [music]
[37:55] Continue to bless the music and the song
[37:58] service. Father, we love [music] and
[38:00] worship you and we come here, Lord, for
[38:04] the breaking of the [music] bread of
[38:05] life to feed our hungry souls. We love
[38:08] and worship you for that, Father. And as
[38:10] we collect the tithes and offerings, I
[38:12] pray that you would bless the cheerful
[38:14] giver. Father, we ask all these things,
[38:17] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[55:25] below
[55:28] in this old [music] sinful world,
[55:33] hardly
[55:34] [music] a comfort can afford.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Driving
[55:43] alone
[55:45] to face temptation.
[55:48] Sore. [music]
[55:50] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[55:58] See [music]
[55:59] where could I go?
[56:03] Oh, where [music] could I go?
[56:08] Seeking
[56:10] a refuge for my soul.
[56:17] Needing [music]
[56:19] a friend
[56:21] to help me in the air.
[56:26] Where [music] could I go but to the
[56:30] Lord?
[56:32] [music]
[56:34] Well, now neighbors
[56:37] are kind.
[56:39] I love them. [music]
[56:41] Everyone,
[56:44] we get along in sweet [music] accord.
[56:53] But when my soul [music]
[56:56] needs man up from above, see [music]
[57:01] where could I go but to the Lord? Let's
[57:06] put our hands together.
[57:10] Where [music]
[57:11] could I go?
[57:14] See where could [music] I go?
[57:18] Well, I'm seeking
[57:20] a refuge [music] for my soul
[57:26] when I needed
[57:29] [music] a friend. Oh, to help me in the
[57:34] end. See [music] where could I go but to
[57:40] the Lord?
[57:44] Well, [music] life here is grand
[57:49] with friends I love so dear. [music]
[57:54] Comfort I get [music] from God's own
[57:58] word.
[58:02] Yeah. [music]
[58:04] And I pray. Oh [singing] my. [music]
[58:11] Where could I go to [music]
[58:15] the Lord?
[58:18] Oh,
[58:20] [music] where could I go?
[58:24] [music] Where could I go? Will I seek
[58:30] [music]
[58:31] a refuge for my soul
[58:37] when I [music] need
[58:39] a pray?
[58:42] to help me in the
[58:46] everywhere
[58:48] I go but to the Lord.
[58:53] [music]
[58:59] Where could I go but to the Lord? I
[59:01] wonder sometimes how the world survives
[59:04] without God's [music]
[59:07] presence in their life. not just a
[59:09] belief about God, but actually his
[59:12] presence in their life. My mom and I
[59:14] were talking about it one time and she
[59:16] was commenting because, you know, from
[59:19] my perspective, and I'm not 25 anymore,
[59:22] but she's even older than me. Sorry,
[59:24] Sister Mom, but [laughter]
[59:26] but I and so for her, when she looks at
[59:29] what the world used to be and what it is
[59:31] now, she really has quite the
[59:32] perspective. She said, "How how is the
[59:35] world surviving without this wonderful
[59:37] truth?" And I said, "Well, the mom,
[59:39] they're not. That's why suicide and drug
[59:43] addiction and pharmaceuticals are making
[59:45] gazillions of dollars is because they're
[59:48] not coping. And that's why you see the
[59:50] madness on the streets that you see. But
[59:52] I'm glad we have an anchor."
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Where could I go but to the Lord? Where
[59:57] would I want to go but to the Lord?
[1:00:00] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're very
[1:00:02] happy to have you all here in the house
[1:00:04] of God tonight. I have no idea if
[1:00:06] Brother Tony's done it yet, but you're
[1:00:08] going to have to turn around and shake
[1:00:09] hands with somebody. Amen. Now that I'm
[1:00:11] standing here, turn around and shake
[1:00:12] hands with somebody. Tell them God bless
[1:00:14] you. Happy to have you all in the house
[1:00:17] of the Lord. It's a super special
[1:00:20] weekend for us here. We've been uh
[1:00:24] planning for it for quite some time,
[1:00:26] counting down the days literally. I
[1:00:28] actually had it on my heart months and
[1:00:30] months even before even reaching out to
[1:00:32] brother Aaron and just [music] uh it
[1:00:35] just I just kept in my whole heart I
[1:00:37] said man I would love to get brother
[1:00:38] Aaron we're trying to figure out how to
[1:00:40] get that done and so uh this is kind of
[1:00:43] like when we I think it was last year
[1:00:44] that we had the Puits here the year
[1:00:46] before I believe it was last year and so
[1:00:49] uh kind of almost started a tradition
[1:00:51] and uh we've got them out here having a
[1:00:53] little bit of vacation time [music] and
[1:00:55] I said now bring your preaching shoes
[1:00:57] cuz you're going to have to work for
[1:00:58] food, but we're going to get you a nice
[1:01:01] place to relax out with his family.
[1:01:03] Sister Elizabeth and the whole family.
[1:01:05] They're [music] right there. Everybody
[1:01:06] turn around. Stare at them right here.
[1:01:07] Amen. McGary family, wave at everybody.
[1:01:10] Come on.
[1:01:12] Amen. We're happy to have them here with
[1:01:14] us today. Jack, did you wave at
[1:01:16] everybody? You probably Okay, you I
[1:01:18] figured you would, buddy. Amen. Brother
[1:01:20] Aaron is a friend for many, many years.
[1:01:23] And um I tell you his whole family. I've
[1:01:27] uh I I was trying to think back today
[1:01:29] how many years it does go back. And of
[1:01:31] course I knew brother Aaron even when
[1:01:33] they were living in Texas. He's been in
[1:01:35] Phoenix now for quite a little spell.
[1:01:37] And uh [music] so we're happy to have
[1:01:39] him here. I have 100% confidence in him.
[1:01:42] So I want you to relax. Let [music] the
[1:01:44] Lord minister to you. Do you have a need
[1:01:46] tonight? How many came to church not
[1:01:49] just because it's a habit or because
[1:01:50] it's a schedule, but say, "I'm here
[1:01:52] because I have needs in the word of
[1:01:54] God." And so, I wrote to brother Aaron
[1:01:56] today and I said, "I want you to take
[1:01:58] your complete [music]
[1:01:59] absolute liberty." Have 100% confidence
[1:02:03] in his ministry. And I got a lot of
[1:02:05] friends out there uh at his assembly
[1:02:08] there in Arizona. And [music] so, uh
[1:02:10] perhaps some of them are streaming
[1:02:11] tonight. Happy to have Hope and Jeff and
[1:02:14] Milo. Milo, God bless you, buddy. Happy
[1:02:16] to have you here.
[1:02:18] [laughter]
[1:02:20] Yeah. Hey, brother Milo, God bless you.
[1:02:22] Happy to have you. Amen. Happy to have
[1:02:25] them here. You feeling better, Sister
[1:02:27] Hope? Uh we [music] were praying the
[1:02:29] Lord would give you a touch. Amen. The
[1:02:31] devil tried to attack actually Brother
[1:02:33] Aaron's family right when they were
[1:02:34] headed to the airport. And boy, I just
[1:02:37] said, "That's just like the devil." So,
[1:02:38] we started praying and they all got on
[1:02:40] the plane and they're here. So, we're
[1:02:42] looking forward to tonight, tomorrow,
[1:02:44] and [music] Sunday. Amen. We're going to
[1:02:45] keep them around Monday for some more
[1:02:47] extended fellowship. Amen. We're going
[1:02:49] to come back around on that song. Where
[1:02:51] could I go but to the Lord? Want to
[1:02:53] invite brother Aaron to [music] come.
[1:02:54] Amen. To the platform. Take his liberty
[1:02:56] tonight. Oh, where could I go? Oh, where
[1:03:05] could I go?
[1:03:08] Seeking [music]
[1:03:10] a refuge for my soul. [singing]
[1:03:14] Oh
[1:03:16] my needing [music] a friend
[1:03:20] to help me in the end. [music]
[1:03:24] See where could I go but to the Lord.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; See where [music]
[1:03:35] could I go?
[1:03:38] Oh where could I go? [music]
[1:03:43] seeking a refuge for my soul.
[1:03:52] Oh, needing [music]
[1:03:54] a
[1:03:55] [singing]
[1:03:56] help me [music] in the air.
[1:04:00] Oh, where could I go? [singing]
[1:04:04] [music] Sing it again. Lord,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; amen. Where could I go? [singing]
[1:04:09] Where [music] could I go?
[1:04:15] But I go [music] when I seeking
[1:04:20] a refuge for my soul
[1:04:25] [music]
[1:04:26] when I need
[1:04:29] a friend
[1:04:31] to help me in the end. [music]
[1:04:35] Oh, where could I go [music] but to the
[1:04:40] Lord? [singing]
[1:04:45] Amen.
[1:04:47] Amen. It's not often you get to groove a
[1:04:48] little bit when you come to the pulpit.
[1:04:50] If so, I liked being [music] in the
[1:04:52] pocket there a little and worshiping.
[1:04:55] That felt good. Amen. You all get to
[1:04:57] have all the fun worshiping and setting
[1:04:59] the atmosphere while the preacher just
[1:05:01] sweats it out in the back. So, thanks
[1:05:03] for letting me be a part of the worship.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could turn to Genesis
[1:05:07] chapter 28, going to be reading verses
[1:05:09] 16 to 22.
[1:05:12] Genesis chapter 28, starting with verse
[1:05:15] 16 to verse 22. It's a great privilege
[1:05:17] to be here. Very grateful for the
[1:05:19] opportunity. And uh as brother Jason
[1:05:22] already expressed, we've been friends
[1:05:23] for quite a long time. Sister Elizabeth
[1:05:25] and I celebrated our 20th anniversary
[1:05:27] this year of marriage. And so, um, he's
[1:05:30] had reason to like me for at least that
[1:05:32] long. And, um, stuck it out. And I
[1:05:35] believe we've just become dear friends.
[1:05:37] And I feel the same way about, uh, his
[1:05:39] family. Brother Matthew has been a
[1:05:41] tremendous encouragement to me through
[1:05:42] the years. And I feel like he's always
[1:05:44] fellowshipped up. So, that um, I view
[1:05:47] him more as a peer and maybe even some
[1:05:50] ways a mentor. And, uh, just really
[1:05:52] appreciate his fellowship. Always been
[1:05:54] encouraged by that. But we love each one
[1:05:56] of you dearly. Glad to be here. and we
[1:05:57] just want the word to have the
[1:05:58] preeminence. Um, so if you just allow us
[1:06:01] uh just to preach and minister, I know
[1:06:03] that you'll be blessed in that.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Mark, God bless you. Good to
[1:06:07] see you. I guess I forgot you were out
[1:06:09] here, but it's really good to see you.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; You're keeping them. That's That's fine
[1:06:13] with me. It's fine with me if I don't
[1:06:16] read into that. No, I'm just kidding.
[1:06:20] But no, it's good to see you. God bless
[1:06:21] you. Genesis chapter 28. My title is
[1:06:24] very unique. uh the way the Lord's dealt
[1:06:27] with my heart for this weekend. I
[1:06:28] recognize this is a very unique weekend
[1:06:30] and my burden is for you locally uh that
[1:06:33] we could just be family and speak from
[1:06:35] the word of God to encourage you. So my
[1:06:36] title is building Bethl,
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; building Bethl. And I hope you can make
[1:06:41] it personal.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 28 16. And Jacob awoke
[1:06:46] out of his sleep and he said surely the
[1:06:48] Lord is in this place and I knew it not.
[1:06:51] And he was afraid and said how dreadful
[1:06:53] is this place. This is none other but
[1:06:55] the house of God and this is the gate of
[1:06:58] heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the
[1:07:01] morning and took the stone that he had
[1:07:02] put for his pillows and set it up for a
[1:07:04] pillar and poured oil upon the top of
[1:07:06] it. And he came and he called the name
[1:07:09] of that place Bethl. But the name of
[1:07:12] that city was called lose at the first.
[1:07:15] And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God
[1:07:17] will be with me and will keep me in this
[1:07:19] way that I go and will give me bread to
[1:07:20] eat and raignment to put on, so that I
[1:07:22] come again to my father's house in
[1:07:24] peace, then shall the Lord be my God,
[1:07:26] and this stone which I have set for a
[1:07:28] pillar shall be God's house. And of all
[1:07:31] that thou shalt give me, I will surely
[1:07:33] give the tenth unto thee." Amen. If we
[1:07:36] could bow our heads and pray together.
[1:07:38] Gracious heavenly father, thank you so
[1:07:40] much for this privilege we have to be
[1:07:42] gathered together in your house and to
[1:07:44] be fellowshipping one with another. This
[1:07:46] privilege we had of being able to
[1:07:48] worship and to exercise our gifts and to
[1:07:51] yield those gifts as song leader and
[1:07:54] musicians and even as those that lifted
[1:07:56] up their voices, we could say that for
[1:07:58] Friday night, it's been good to be in
[1:07:59] your presence already. But now Lord, as
[1:08:02] we turn to your word, we're nothing
[1:08:04] without this. And this the message which
[1:08:07] we have received in this hour was sent
[1:08:09] for the purpose of uh loosing the
[1:08:12] scriptures, the denominational uh chains
[1:08:14] that were placed on it and the muddling
[1:08:17] of truths and the mudding of the waters.
[1:08:19] Lord, you've you've made it a new book
[1:08:21] to us and we see it as our absolute this
[1:08:24] scripture. So now, Lord, we turn our
[1:08:26] attention to the word for we're nothing
[1:08:27] without this scripture and this word.
[1:08:29] and may you make it alive to us by
[1:08:31] revelation as we commit ourselves to
[1:08:32] you. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:34] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You could be seated.
[1:08:39] I've mentioned my title already, so
[1:08:42] we're going to be tracking that as we go
[1:08:44] forward. I know the setup for this
[1:08:46] weekend is a little bit different with
[1:08:47] maybe not a traditional service
[1:08:49] tomorrow. Uh but we um just trust that
[1:08:52] we can fellowship in this subject this
[1:08:53] weekend. In Exodus 25:8 it says, "And
[1:08:57] let them make me a sanctuary." So this
[1:08:59] is God that's speaking. He says, "Let
[1:09:01] them make me a sanctuary that I may
[1:09:04] dwell among them." He's saying, "Build
[1:09:07] me a house so I can live amongst you."
[1:09:09] That's what God desired is he desired to
[1:09:12] live amongst Israel. The tabernacle in
[1:09:14] the wilderness then was going to be
[1:09:16] God's house with Israel as they
[1:09:18] journeyed. It's called the tabernacle of
[1:09:20] witness or testimony. Jehovah's tent of
[1:09:23] testimony is another way that you could
[1:09:24] take uh take and translate that language
[1:09:27] or the sacred tent of God and you know
[1:09:30] the different arrangements of it. How
[1:09:32] there was an outer court and a holy
[1:09:34] place and a most holy place. Uh what we
[1:09:36] call the holy of holies. Uh in the outer
[1:09:39] court all the Jews were allowed to come
[1:09:41] there and there was a bronze altar that
[1:09:43] faced the entrance and then there's a
[1:09:44] labor that was available. But in that
[1:09:47] holy place uh the first chamber of a
[1:09:50] structure within that entire enclosure
[1:09:51] they call that the court there was the
[1:09:53] bread table the lampstand but only
[1:09:55] priests were allowed to enter in there
[1:09:57] for service and then you had the most
[1:10:00] holy place that holy of holies and only
[1:10:02] one person entered there entered once a
[1:10:05] year that was God's room that was where
[1:10:07] the presence of God was it was that
[1:10:09] innermost western room of the tabernacle
[1:10:12] it contained the ark of the testimony
[1:10:15] and this was the temple of the
[1:10:17] tabernacle. Revelations 15:5 it says
[1:10:21] after that I looked and behold the
[1:10:23] temple of the tabernacle of the
[1:10:25] testimony in heaven was opened. So the
[1:10:27] testimony in heaven is that tent but
[1:10:30] then within that there's the temple of
[1:10:32] the tabernacle and that was the holy of
[1:10:34] holies in the tabernacle in the
[1:10:36] wilderness. So that's the that's the
[1:10:38] place that God would dwell. Verse 21 and
[1:10:41] 22 of the same chapter says, "And thou
[1:10:43] shalt put the mercy seat above upon the
[1:10:46] ark, and in the ark thou shalt put the
[1:10:49] testimony that I shall give thee, and
[1:10:51] there I will meet with thee." So it's
[1:10:53] not just outer court or inner court, but
[1:10:55] it's there in this temple of the
[1:10:57] tabernacle, the most holy place. I will
[1:11:00] meet with thee and I will commune with
[1:11:02] thee from above the mercy seat. So there
[1:11:04] God will commune. That means he'll
[1:11:06] speak. There's some sort of declaration.
[1:11:08] I'm going to command. I'm going to give
[1:11:10] promises. I'm going to warn you, but
[1:11:12] that's where I'm going to speak. So, it
[1:11:14] was a sacred meeting place. There I will
[1:11:17] commune with thee from above the mercy
[1:11:19] seat. There I will dwell. It is the
[1:11:21] dwelling place of God. We know according
[1:11:23] to scripture, this is where God visibly
[1:11:25] manifested his glory there between the
[1:11:27] cherubams. And if I could say this just
[1:11:30] a way of summarizing a lot of scripture
[1:11:32] and a lot of even oral tradition of the
[1:11:34] Hebrews, it represented heaven.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; All right? In the structure of the
[1:11:38] tabernacle, you have the outer court
[1:11:40] where everyone would be and then you
[1:11:41] have the inner court where uh the
[1:11:43] Levites would go and the priest would
[1:11:44] go. But then the way this most holy
[1:11:47] place was structured, that veil
[1:11:49] represented the uh the heavens and it
[1:11:52] and this veil between what is seen and
[1:11:53] what is not seen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; It was sealed off from the view of those
[1:11:57] outside. So that most holy place
[1:12:00] represents heaven.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; In Psalms 11:4, and the Lord is in his
[1:12:04] holy temple, the Lord's throne is in
[1:12:06] heaven. The Jews believe that the
[1:12:08] structure of the tabernacle corresponds
[1:12:10] to the structure of heaven and earth. So
[1:12:12] the outer the outer court and the inner
[1:12:14] court represent earth. But then in
[1:12:16] behind that veil represented heaven
[1:12:18] because the Lord's throne is in heaven.
[1:12:20] He said I will meet you there between
[1:12:22] these cherubams.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; So the holy of holies is a shadow and a
[1:12:25] type of heaven. Heaven is Jesus said
[1:12:29] that my father which is in heaven. I say
[1:12:31] well the father was in him
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; but there is it's God's throne room.
[1:12:36] Heaven is where God is manifesting
[1:12:37] himself in full glory, where he's
[1:12:39] worshiped endlessly. If there's no God,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; it ain't no heaven.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; I guess if you learn anything tonight,
[1:12:46] you can say, "Well, that's one thing I
[1:12:48] can know is if God's not there, it's not
[1:12:50] heaven."
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And so heaven, brother Bam said, is
[1:12:52] consisted of the word.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; So God on the mercy seat in the Holy of
[1:12:57] Holies, there he received worship. And
[1:13:00] that temple, the tabernacle, that most
[1:13:02] holy place, I want to use this phrase.
[1:13:04] It was heaven on earth. The Lord is in
[1:13:06] his tabernacle. The Lord is uh Lord's
[1:13:09] throne is in heaven. When he said, "Make
[1:13:11] me a place, make me a sanctuary that I
[1:13:13] may dwell among you." That was heaven on
[1:13:15] earth.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And so it has it holds great meaning to
[1:13:18] us. In John 14 23, we see there's a
[1:13:23] shifting here in terms of God's dwelling
[1:13:25] place. And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:13:27] him, "If a man love me, he will keep my
[1:13:29] words, and my father will love him, and
[1:13:32] we will come unto him and make our abode
[1:13:34] with him." Saying, "We'll make our
[1:13:36] dwelling, our stay." This is where we
[1:13:38] will abide, and we will abide in the
[1:13:41] heart of man. So what happens now is
[1:13:42] God's not dwelling behind badger skins,
[1:13:45] and he's not dwelling in the tabernacle
[1:13:47] of witness, nor is he behind a veil in a
[1:13:49] temple, but now he makes his abode in
[1:13:51] the heart of men. And then your heart
[1:13:54] becomes a a home for God or this heaven
[1:13:57] on earth.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The Old Testament, God's dwelling place
[1:14:00] was the tabernacle. Then that transition
[1:14:02] to the temple. In the New Testament, we
[1:14:04] see that God's home is in his church.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; God's home is in the heart of his
[1:14:08] individuals. In eternity, we could even
[1:14:10] look to eternity. In the future home,
[1:14:12] God is resident in Christ and his bride
[1:14:14] on earth. But he has a dwelling place in
[1:14:17] his bride, revealing himself through
[1:14:18] Christ and his bride on earth. And in
[1:14:21] every single instance you see in the Old
[1:14:24] Testament, in the New Testament, even in
[1:14:26] the future home, it's God making a home
[1:14:28] on earth or a place where there's heaven
[1:14:30] in earth.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You following me?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I just want to make this very simple
[1:14:34] point. So I believe that as we often
[1:14:37] sing and we long uh to to be in that
[1:14:40] place, we should have this goal of
[1:14:42] making heaven our home. We speak of the
[1:14:44] rapture and the chain translation and
[1:14:47] these things. That's a that's a worthy
[1:14:48] aim. This world is not my home. I'm just
[1:14:51] a passing through. And so we got to be
[1:14:53] forward looking and we have to have a
[1:14:54] vision to that translation to that
[1:14:56] future home, but if I could say this,
[1:14:59] not to be contradictory or put it in a
[1:15:01] way that's uh different, but there must
[1:15:03] be another ambition and goal that we
[1:15:05] must have now if we ever want to make
[1:15:08] heaven our home. We need to be a home
[1:15:10] for heaven on earth.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:15:12] There has to be an ambition to that if
[1:15:14] we want to have all that glorious
[1:15:16] liberty uh of the millennium or a future
[1:15:19] home then we have to yield to that now.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 2 19 to 22 it says now
[1:15:27] therefore ye are no more strangers and
[1:15:29] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:15:32] saints and of the household of God. This
[1:15:36] is a a family of God, a
[1:15:39] something very rich in meeting and are
[1:15:40] built upon the foundation of the
[1:15:43] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[1:15:45] himself being the chief cornerstone, in
[1:15:48] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:15:50] together, groweth unto a holy temple in
[1:15:52] the Lord, in whom ye also are builded
[1:15:56] together for a habitation of God through
[1:15:58] the spirit. This is in God's economy. In
[1:16:01] his economy, there was a plan not just
[1:16:03] for one home, but many homes.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; In my father's house, there are many
[1:16:07] mansions. It speaks of many different
[1:16:08] homes. So, this is his household,
[1:16:11] many different dwelling places, many
[1:16:13] hearts that he wants to inhabit.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; So, God says that we are of his
[1:16:17] household. The scripture does. We are
[1:16:19] this building framed together that is
[1:16:21] built together. In 1 Peter chapter 2:5,
[1:16:25] "Ye also are lively stones, are built up
[1:16:28] a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to
[1:16:31] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:16:34] to God by Jesus Christ." So let me put
[1:16:37] it this way. We should desire heaven.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; We have to have a desire beyond this
[1:16:42] life. If if we if there is no afterlife,
[1:16:45] if there is no resurrection, if there is
[1:16:47] no eternity, then we of all people are
[1:16:48] most miserable. And so there must be a
[1:16:51] desire for heaven or this longing to
[1:16:54] leave. But there has to be some sort of
[1:16:57] context uh of God's desire for us. In
[1:17:00] other words, our longing to leave means
[1:17:02] nothing unless we understand God's
[1:17:04] desire for us right now.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to get out of this
[1:17:07] earth. I just want to go in a rapture. I
[1:17:09] just want to make it to heaven. But we
[1:17:10] have to understand that God wants a home
[1:17:13] now.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, just one day in in glory, one day in
[1:17:16] heaven, one day in eternity. I'm going
[1:17:18] to make heaven my home. And God is
[1:17:19] saying, "Heaven wants a home now.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; You're you're guaranteed and assured of
[1:17:24] this eternal resting place and in and
[1:17:26] the future home, but God now wants to
[1:17:29] have place in us."
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; First John 4:19, we love him because he
[1:17:34] first loved us. So there is a deep
[1:17:37] calling in us to be there, but we only
[1:17:39] have a desire to be there because God
[1:17:41] desires to be here.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; The longing we have for heaven
[1:17:45] originates from God's desire for our
[1:17:47] heart.
[1:17:49] Brother Bannon said, "We're going to
[1:17:51] life to real eternal life. We're going
[1:17:52] to heaven, a paradise." So, we know
[1:17:55] we're going there. That that is to come.
[1:17:58] I I want to say this. Our desire to go
[1:18:02] to heaven is exceeded by God's desire
[1:18:05] for your heart.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Our desire to for the rapture, our
[1:18:09] desire for the change is is is smaller
[1:18:12] than God's desire for home in us now.
[1:18:15] Good.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And Isaiah 66:1, "Thus sayith the Lord,
[1:18:19] the heaven is my throne and the earth is
[1:18:21] my foottool."
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Where is the house that ye build unto
[1:18:24] me? Surely this speaks of God's
[1:18:27] greatness that the heaven is my throne,
[1:18:29] the earth is my foottool. It just gives
[1:18:31] him this appearance as if he exist in
[1:18:33] all time and space. He cannot be
[1:18:35] contained. It just speaks to this great
[1:18:38] uh just how vast God is. But then he
[1:18:40] says, "Where is the house that you will
[1:18:42] build me? And where is the place of my
[1:18:44] rest?"
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It's not said rhetorically. In other
[1:18:47] words, you can't build me a house. There
[1:18:48] is no place that I could find rest. But
[1:18:50] it speaks to God's desire and longing.
[1:18:52] Yeah. Though I feel all time and space,
[1:18:54] though that even eternity itself is
[1:18:56] unending because God cannot be
[1:18:58] contained. Where where's my home?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "What house will you build me?"
[1:19:04] That's that beeth. It's that family of
[1:19:06] descendants, a household.
[1:19:09] It comes from the Hebrew word banana
[1:19:10] which means to build a house. Where is
[1:19:13] my family? Where's my generation? Means
[1:19:17] to establish a family. Where is the
[1:19:19] place of my rest? When this is picked up
[1:19:22] in the book of Acts in Acts 7:49, it
[1:19:24] says what house will you build me? That
[1:19:26] means what descendants? What stock? So,
[1:19:29] he was looking for a generation. He was
[1:19:31] looking for a people. And it wasn't just
[1:19:35] a a a church or religion. It was a home
[1:19:38] is what he desired.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I hope that I know I know there's a lot
[1:19:42] attention we can give to that and I hope
[1:19:43] you're just recognizing these these
[1:19:45] little pieces as we try to put them
[1:19:47] together. Now, if you'll look at script
[1:19:49] uh Psalms chapter 27:4, I find this
[1:19:52] chapter to be an extraordinary chapter
[1:19:54] especially when a prophet is able to
[1:19:57] identify it as a prophecy for the
[1:19:58] rapture. And so, there's a lot in this
[1:20:01] especially we say, "Oh, this is rapture
[1:20:03] scripture." A and in a time of trouble,
[1:20:07] he's going to hide me in his the secret
[1:20:08] of his presence, in the secret of his
[1:20:10] tabernacle. The verse uh the verse prior
[1:20:13] to that says, "One thing have I desired
[1:20:15] of the Lord." Psalm 27:4, "One thing
[1:20:18] have I desired of the Lord, that will I
[1:20:20] seek after."
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; So, let's think about this. One thing
[1:20:24] desired, and that one thing I desire, I
[1:20:27] will seek after. I I in studying on this
[1:20:30] subject some time ago, I remember what
[1:20:33] uh really came to me and crystallized is
[1:20:35] life is all about simplicity
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and that the more that we can reduce our
[1:20:41] desires and distill our desire down,
[1:20:43] that's what life is. Life is about
[1:20:44] reducing all the noise and removing all
[1:20:47] the distractions and and bringing
[1:20:49] reducing our desires down to one. And so
[1:20:52] this is the wisdom of the scripture. One
[1:20:54] thing have I desired of the Lord, and
[1:20:55] it's that which I'll seek after,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:21:00] Lord all the days of my life, to behold
[1:21:03] the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in
[1:21:06] his temple.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; This is, if I could say this way so I
[1:21:11] could kind of continue this theme, this
[1:21:12] is a desire to make a home for heaven.
[1:21:17] And this that desire that we want to
[1:21:19] make a home for heaven. I'm wanting to
[1:21:21] tie these two things together. This
[1:21:22] desire that we should have to let Christ
[1:21:25] have preeminence in us now should exceed
[1:21:28] our desire to leave
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; at the very least precede it.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Our desire to leave is not going to be
[1:21:33] more genuine and more sincere unless
[1:21:35] there's a desire to allow Christ have
[1:21:37] preeminence in us.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Only by him having greater preeminence
[1:21:40] in us is there going to be this
[1:21:42] increased desperation to get out of
[1:21:44] here. Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; But he says, "One thing will I seek
[1:21:47] after to behold the beauty, the
[1:21:48] kindness, the pleasantness, the favor,
[1:21:51] the grace of God. To inquire." That
[1:21:53] means to seek, to consider. I'm I'm
[1:21:55] going to reflect upon. It is a place
[1:21:57] he's looking for. A place to seek him.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Not just a place to call upon his name.
[1:22:03] Not just a place to worship him, but a
[1:22:04] place where he can be found. A place to
[1:22:06] seek him. So the defining characteristic
[1:22:09] of the house of the Lord is God's
[1:22:11] presence. When he says to dwell in the
[1:22:15] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:22:16] life, it's not how some people may have
[1:22:19] a I may a second home. I know we don't
[1:22:22] know what that means, but a vacation
[1:22:24] home or we go and we stay in an Airbnb
[1:22:26] and you're staying in somebody else's
[1:22:27] house. But uh ideally, they're not
[1:22:29] there.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to stay in God's
[1:22:33] Airbnb. We want to be we want to stay in
[1:22:36] his home. We want to be where he is.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. They say, "Well, I want to invite
[1:22:41] you into my house, but I'm not going to
[1:22:43] be there." I if God if we just wanted to
[1:22:46] be in the house of the Lord and his
[1:22:47] presence wasn't there, our follow-up
[1:22:49] should be, "Well, wherever you are, we
[1:22:51] want to be there also.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I don't need the structure. I don't need
[1:22:54] the framework. I just want your
[1:22:55] presence."
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And so, he's saying where to dwell in
[1:22:58] the house of the Lord speaks of God's
[1:23:00] presence. It speaks of his provision and
[1:23:02] it speaks the pleasure that we derive
[1:23:03] from his presence. the provision that
[1:23:06] comes from that, a place of safety, a
[1:23:08] place of beauty.
[1:23:10] In Micah 4:es 1
[1:23:13] uh to verse two, it says, "But in the
[1:23:15] last days, it shall come to pass that
[1:23:17] the mountain of the house of the Lord
[1:23:19] shall be established in the top of the
[1:23:21] mountains, and it shall be exalted above
[1:23:24] the hills." And just catch the language
[1:23:25] as he's describing this. The mountain of
[1:23:28] the house of the Lord is going to be
[1:23:28] established in the top of the mountains.
[1:23:31] And many nations shall come and say,
[1:23:33] "Come, and let us go up to the mountain
[1:23:35] of the Lord, and to the house of the God
[1:23:37] of Jacob, and he will teach us of his
[1:23:39] ways, and we will walk in his paths. For
[1:23:42] the law shall go forth to Zion of Zion,
[1:23:44] and the word of the Lord from
[1:23:45] Jerusalem."
[1:23:47] I read this scripture because the house
[1:23:49] of the Lord is so clearly being
[1:23:50] described as being on earth.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; So when David says, "One thing have I
[1:23:54] desired of the Lord, that will I seek
[1:23:56] after." to the Jews when they longed for
[1:23:59] this place, when they longed to see his
[1:24:01] face. When they wanted to see this
[1:24:02] kingdom established, they did not seek a
[1:24:04] place in heaven.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; They're not seeking a place in a sixth
[1:24:08] or seventh dimension where they leave
[1:24:10] this earth and they shed their flesh.
[1:24:12] But they were looking for uh they
[1:24:14] weren't looking for this invisible
[1:24:15] habitation of God beyond this life. But
[1:24:18] what they were longing for, what David
[1:24:20] said when he said, "That will I seek
[1:24:22] after." He was seeking heaven on earth.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Wasn't asking to die and go into another
[1:24:27] dimension. This wasn't a longing uh for
[1:24:30] the seventh dimension. This was a desire
[1:24:33] on earth where God could be seen. He
[1:24:35] could be sought after. Where God was
[1:24:37] present.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I I really this is a real important
[1:24:41] part. So I'll say this. If you don't
[1:24:44] catch this part, then I'm just going to
[1:24:46] keep saying it over and over again to
[1:24:47] you. At least I the war of attrition.
[1:24:49] You say, "Fine, brother." And we get it.
[1:24:50] What David wanted was a place on earth.
[1:24:52] Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; When David said, "One thing have I
[1:24:54] desired, that will I seek after," it
[1:24:56] wasn't a translation, but it was God's
[1:24:58] presence on earth,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; heaven on earth.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; I like how I could prime you for that
[1:25:04] response. That that worked out
[1:25:05] perfectly.
[1:25:06] So, the house of the Lord is a place
[1:25:08] where God is king. It's where the shina
[1:25:11] glory rest. The Bible says here, a place
[1:25:14] where we're taught his ways. It's a
[1:25:16] place where we are judged, a place where
[1:25:18] judgment goes forth, but it's a place of
[1:25:20] peace, a place of counsel.
[1:25:22] And if David was seeking this place, if
[1:25:26] this is something that the Old Testament
[1:25:28] longed for, and the Old Testament didn't
[1:25:29] long for a a rapture, they longed for
[1:25:32] the Messiah, a kingdom be to be
[1:25:34] established on earth. If this is what
[1:25:36] the desire was, and even God's desire,
[1:25:39] then the question would be, is there a
[1:25:42] place like this on earth today?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] Is there a place where we can seek him?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Is there a place where we can inquire
[1:25:51] when we're needy? Is Is there a place we
[1:25:53] can go where God's presence is?
[1:25:57] Now, if you could just take your Bibles
[1:26:00] and read again here in Genesis chapter
[1:26:02] 28.
[1:26:03] I'd like to read uh our text again uh to
[1:26:07] cover what we what we read in the
[1:26:10] beginning but now with this kind of
[1:26:12] foundation I think we could explore this
[1:26:13] subject a little bit more says and Jacob
[1:26:16] awoke out of his sleep and he said
[1:26:18] surely the Lord is in this place and I
[1:26:21] knew it not. So there's a there you can
[1:26:23] read where he's very troubled. He knows
[1:26:25] something beyond himself was there. He's
[1:26:27] afraid and said how dreadful is this
[1:26:29] place. Not in a fear where h of
[1:26:32] something horrible but this dread of
[1:26:35] knowing this unsettling knowing that God
[1:26:37] was here. And he says this is none
[1:26:38] other. Notice this declaration. This is
[1:26:41] none other but the house of God and this
[1:26:45] is the gate of heaven.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; He says this is the house of God. That's
[1:26:50] what Bethl is. It's the house of God.
[1:26:52] Ba. It comes from beth which is house
[1:26:54] and l which is God. So he says this is
[1:26:57] none other than the house of God. And
[1:26:59] this is the gate of heaven. When he says
[1:27:02] the gate of heaven, he's making he's
[1:27:04] using uh this this phrasing for us to
[1:27:06] recognize that to him. He said this is
[1:27:08] where God dwells. And I'm at this very
[1:27:11] uh place, this meeting place.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; This is the very spot where heaven meets
[1:27:16] earth. Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; This is the this is the place where the
[1:27:19] natural is meeting the supernatural.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's where he he felt he was at this
[1:27:24] this blending of what he knows to be
[1:27:26] human and he knows to be carnal. He
[1:27:28] knows to be earthly. But now he gets
[1:27:29] this sense that this is beyond all that.
[1:27:31] And I'm at the very gate of heaven.
[1:27:34] That's what a gate refers to. It refers
[1:27:36] to an entrance, a meeting place. And the
[1:27:38] scripture, it's a place of authority.
[1:27:40] It's a place of judgment. You find many
[1:27:42] scriptures where this is done in the
[1:27:44] gate.
[1:27:46] He says, "This is the gate of heaven."
[1:27:47] And Jacob rose up early in the morning.
[1:27:49] He took a stone that he had put up for
[1:27:51] had put for his pillows and set it up
[1:27:53] for a pillar and poured oil upon the top
[1:27:56] of it. I think some some of you have
[1:27:59] tried to interpret this as meaning that
[1:28:00] church is a place to sleep. But he he's
[1:28:03] woke up right there's no the stone is no
[1:28:07] longer a pillow. It's going to be set
[1:28:09] upright. So that's your we wake up in
[1:28:12] the house of God. You know, Brother Bram
[1:28:14] taught us that you will miss it if
[1:28:15] you're not wide awake.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; If if you're not fully awake, there's a
[1:28:19] lot of things that we miss.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; So, it says he poured oil upon the top
[1:28:24] of it and he called the name of that
[1:28:26] place Bethl. And he said, "This stone
[1:28:29] which I have set for a pillar shall be
[1:28:31] God's house."
[1:28:33] So by him uh laying setting a right this
[1:28:36] stone by erecting a stone and then
[1:28:39] anointing with oil anointing it with
[1:28:41] oil. This is a an act of dedicating the
[1:28:44] place.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; It's a great sign and a type of us when
[1:28:47] we become the when we begin to be
[1:28:49] established as God's dwelling place. He
[1:28:51] fills us with the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:53] Ghost. That new birth. There's that oil
[1:28:54] of anointing upon us. So here he takes
[1:28:57] the stone and he anoints it with oil and
[1:28:59] he's dedicating it. He says, "I'm going
[1:29:02] to name this place Bethl."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Beth is the gate of
[1:29:07] heaven." In other words, Bethl is heaven
[1:29:10] on earth. It's where heaven and earth
[1:29:12] meet.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; It's a prefigure to the house of the
[1:29:15] Lord. And in this very instance, when he
[1:29:18] wakes up AND HE SAYS, "GOD'S HERE." And
[1:29:20] he wants TO ESTABLISH THIS STONE AND
[1:29:22] THIS PILLAR AND then anointing. HE SAYS,
[1:29:23] "RIGHT HERE IN this place is is Bethl.
[1:29:27] It is the house of God. it it's a type
[1:29:30] that you can bring forward through every
[1:29:32] other form of the house of God that
[1:29:33] appears in scripture.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; It's a picture of God's house in its
[1:29:37] different forms.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; So I want to at this point then this is
[1:29:43] going to maybe you might say this will
[1:29:46] escalate very quickly. But if we're
[1:29:48] going to look at a house, this is what
[1:29:49] my my goal is to address this for the
[1:29:52] remainder of the weekend is that a house
[1:29:54] refers to your body
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; to you individually scripturally. A
[1:29:58] house is a body, but then it's also a
[1:30:00] dwelling place.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; So, it's a home or some sort of house
[1:30:04] containing a family. So, it's it's you
[1:30:06] as an individual,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; then it's or your family
[1:30:11] or it also represents a temple
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; or church. So as we continue tonight and
[1:30:18] I'm I'm very careful about the time and
[1:30:20] so whatever remaining time we take
[1:30:22] tonight that's intentionally vague we
[1:30:25] will focus on you uh that this this
[1:30:28] place consider your body your house or
[1:30:31] your family and your church as Bethl.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Or that it ought to be.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; So when we use the subject building
[1:30:38] Bethl then God intends and God desires
[1:30:41] to dwell
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; amongst you. He wants to He wants a home
[1:30:45] on earth to in order for there to be
[1:30:47] heaven on earth, God has to be resident.
[1:30:48] We don't we're not just wanting a place
[1:30:50] that we visit and then leave and and
[1:30:52] take a stone and anoint it and we just
[1:30:54] kind of go by and we rub the stone and
[1:30:55] we say we've done our duty, but God
[1:30:57] wants to dwell in your heart. So God
[1:31:00] wants to build us into a bethl.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And then God's desire in the beginning
[1:31:04] was not to have a church, but his desire
[1:31:06] in the beginning was to have a family.
[1:31:09] And that's why he had man and a woman
[1:31:10] with the goal to bring forth children in
[1:31:13] the same image. And so God's desires to
[1:31:15] dwell AS HE SAID, "WHAT HOUSE WILL YOU
[1:31:17] BUILD ME? WHAT HOUSEHOLD?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; WHO SHALL DECLARE MY GENERATION?"
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; So it's more than just an individual,
[1:31:24] but it's a family or your house, but
[1:31:27] then also a church. A church should be a
[1:31:30] Bethl. So that's why that's what I'm
[1:31:32] looking at when I say building Bethl.
[1:31:35] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16-1 17 we
[1:31:39] already referred to the scripture
[1:31:41] earlier where Peter said that you are
[1:31:43] living stones built up a spiritual house
[1:31:47] where Paul said you are the household of
[1:31:49] God so the individual is a house now the
[1:31:51] household itself is the dwelling place
[1:31:52] of God he says all the building fitly
[1:31:54] framed together groweth it's built into
[1:31:57] the habitation of God through the spirit
[1:31:59] what is Ephesians 4 uh two saying he's
[1:32:02] building Bethl
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Don't know if I have it in my notes for
[1:32:08] this evening, but that was the very
[1:32:09] phrase brother Brandham uses in Statue
[1:32:11] of a Perfect Man, building the dwelling
[1:32:12] place of God's presence.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Just some kind of paraphrase it. That's
[1:32:16] what we are built into.
[1:32:19] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16 and 17. Know
[1:32:22] ye not that ye are the temple of God.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:32:27] you. that whatever we saw then in
[1:32:30] prefigure in the Old Testament uh it all
[1:32:33] foreshadowed. We know it foreshadowed
[1:32:35] Christ. And so when Christ came, he
[1:32:38] comes as the fulfillment of the what the
[1:32:40] temple foreshadowed. And even all the
[1:32:42] sacrifices and all the shadows and type,
[1:32:44] Christ comes as the Messiah who is the
[1:32:46] dwelling place of God.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And then that that Messiah that is the
[1:32:51] word made flesh. The father comes to
[1:32:54] dwell in him. He becomes this dwelling
[1:32:56] place of God on earth. But as we carry
[1:32:58] that forward, now he is in his church.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; He makes himself resident in the
[1:33:03] believers. So now by the Holy Spirit, he
[1:33:05] says God dwells in you.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "And if any man defile the
[1:33:10] temple of God, him shall God destroy.
[1:33:12] For the temple of God is holy, which
[1:33:15] temple ye are."
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this would seem to be
[1:33:19] blasphemy to an Orthodox Jew who
[1:33:21] believed uh you know who believes in the
[1:33:23] sacrifices of the temple and the layout
[1:33:25] of the temple and the prefigure in the
[1:33:27] uh the tabernacle in the wilderness to
[1:33:29] say now you are the temple of God.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; In the same way that we honor honor the
[1:33:34] temple and and no one's to go behind
[1:33:36] that veil and we honor the we wash
[1:33:38] ourselves and we have all these rules
[1:33:39] and regulations for temple worship. He
[1:33:41] say now you are the temple of God and
[1:33:43] you ought not to desecrate that.
[1:33:46] I don't know if I've mentioned it here
[1:33:48] before
[1:33:49] and and I I think I've only been here
[1:33:51] once since we uh moved from Arizona and
[1:33:55] once was enough. I'm not I'm not wanting
[1:33:57] greater frequency of invitations
[1:33:59] whatsoever at all. I I feel that uh
[1:34:03] I I feel like I was pushed into this a
[1:34:05] little bit by God by God. I don't like
[1:34:08] to travel. But I had preached a
[1:34:10] ministers meeting one time and it was
[1:34:12] the subject was and there was two
[1:34:14] speakers and I was to go first and the
[1:34:16] subject was uh the five definite
[1:34:18] identifications of the true church of
[1:34:20] the living God.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And so I took that sermon and I just
[1:34:24] realized that what brother Brandham is
[1:34:25] teaching is that there is the true
[1:34:27] church of the living God. And that true
[1:34:29] church of the living God is this body of
[1:34:32] Christ that has no geographical
[1:34:35] constraints or boundaries. That that's
[1:34:37] the true church of the living God. And
[1:34:38] so I was like, man, I got just just
[1:34:40] going to come out, lay out these
[1:34:41] principles, and the minister that
[1:34:42] follows me, he was the more veteran
[1:34:43] minister, and he would preach second.
[1:34:45] It's the way they had this ordered. And
[1:34:47] and that way the materials would be out
[1:34:49] there for the ministers to use for the
[1:34:50] rest of the day. And but they switched
[1:34:53] the order. And my my main point was
[1:34:55] going to be the five identifications of
[1:34:58] the true church of the living God is
[1:34:59] that the no one local church is the true
[1:35:03] church of the living God. Well, this
[1:35:05] brother got up and preached that his
[1:35:06] local church was the true church of the
[1:35:08] living God. Well, maybe not just his,
[1:35:11] but that if you didn't have these five
[1:35:12] definite identifications, you were not a
[1:35:14] true church. And so, he began to talk
[1:35:16] about the sanctuary and the disrespect
[1:35:18] for it and the building and the true
[1:35:20] church. And it was all kind of relegated
[1:35:22] to that kind of local system where you
[1:35:24] have a location, you have a physical
[1:35:26] pastor, and you have all these
[1:35:29] requirements to have a local assembly.
[1:35:31] And I basically had to get up and say,
[1:35:33] not to be disagreeable, right? But there
[1:35:38] no one local church is the true church
[1:35:40] of the living God. And because and I and
[1:35:43] I remember making these points that how
[1:35:46] much more sometimes we could be so rude
[1:35:49] and disrespectful
[1:35:51] uh towards people and very very reverent
[1:35:54] for the sanctuary
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; and be CAREFUL HOW YOU TREAT THE
[1:35:59] SANCTUARY. BE CARE AND WE HAVE NO REGARD
[1:36:01] for the true temple of God which is you.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And when it and if I could just finish
[1:36:06] my thought on the true church of the
[1:36:08] living God. The local church can have
[1:36:09] many different pastors.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; One could pass away, one could be voted
[1:36:13] out, one could move. And so a local
[1:36:15] church can have different pastors, but
[1:36:16] the true church of the living God has
[1:36:17] one shepherd
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; once and for all forever.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; The local church you God could lead you
[1:36:23] to attend and then you can leave and go
[1:36:25] attend another church. But once baptized
[1:36:27] into the true church of the living God,
[1:36:28] you never leave that one.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; So there's a definite difference from
[1:36:32] the identification of the true church of
[1:36:34] the living God and local churches.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; But it's that when Paul says that you
[1:36:39] are the temple of the HOLY GHOST, THAT
[1:36:41] IS SOMETHING SPECIAL.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE RESPECTED. THAT
[1:36:45] IS SOMETHING THAT represents the
[1:36:47] identity of God's dwelling place.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham writes in the church
[1:36:51] age book chapter 3, "Man was created for
[1:36:53] God. Man was to be the temple of God.
[1:36:59] The place of God's rest,
[1:37:01] the Holy Spirit was man, the temple.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; It wasn't behind the veil in the Holy of
[1:37:09] Holies.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't even in Christ alone. It was
[1:37:13] in man.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; In the church age book, he writes that
[1:37:17] God reserved that place alone, that
[1:37:19] dwelling for you. Yeah.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; You realize this is this is what helps
[1:37:24] us to understand the original sin. Helps
[1:37:26] us to understand what Satan's motive was
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; in the beginning. He could not dwell in
[1:37:31] the heart of Adam.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Could not dwell in the heart of the
[1:37:34] woman. He had to create a hybrid so he
[1:37:36] could dwell in it
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; because God reserved that place for
[1:37:41] himself alone.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; So when Christ came born of a virgin,
[1:37:44] God could step into that
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; and sat but Satan couldn't. HE WAS
[1:37:48] SEALED OUT. SATAN. JESUS WOULD HAVE HAD
[1:37:51] TO RELINQUISH his authority
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; and worship Satan to receive kingdoms in
[1:37:56] another way. But Satan could not dwell
[1:37:58] in there because God reserved that place
[1:38:00] alone for him.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So it's by the new birth that we become
[1:38:03] new creatures IN CHRIST JESUS. AND GOD
[1:38:06] THEN DWELLS IN OUR HEARTS FULFILLING
[1:38:08] WHAT HIS BURDEN WAS AND his desire was
[1:38:10] in the beginning.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; So God made man or humanity to be his
[1:38:16] house. Yeah,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; I preached on a subject just this past
[1:38:20] Wednesday, Wednesday night. I kind of
[1:38:21] just stopped in the middle of it and uh
[1:38:24] and I I'm not going to give you our URL
[1:38:26] or our YouTube channel so you can uh
[1:38:28] subscribe and smash that like button and
[1:38:30] turn on notifications, but it when we
[1:38:33] preached on that, I I preached a
[1:38:35] portrait of humanity.
[1:38:37] A and I think a lot of people are still
[1:38:39] confused because all the scriptures I
[1:38:41] used to show the portrait of humanity in
[1:38:44] Jesus Christ was all his miracles.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:47] But then you can go to the scripture and
[1:38:48] find that every these things Christ was
[1:38:51] doing was what Adam was called to do.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; And that brother Bam taught us that
[1:38:56] Jesus was proving that what man lost in
[1:38:58] the fall, CHRIST WAS RESTORING. SO IT
[1:39:01] WAS THIS PERFECT PICTURE OF HUMANITY.
[1:39:04] NOT AS HUMANITY is now, but as humanity
[1:39:06] God intended it to BE TO BE HIMSELF ON
[1:39:09] EARTH.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; And this is WHEN WE GOT GOD MADE
[1:39:13] HUMANITY TO BE HIS DWELLING PLACE.
[1:39:16] GOD GOD DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. HE
[1:39:19] DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE CREATION. HE WANTED
[1:39:21] TO be and live and exist.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; As it's been said before, GOD DIDN'T
[1:39:25] WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY. HE WANTED TO
[1:39:26] BECOME A FAMILY.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, MAN, we are we must then
[1:39:33] reflect and be reflective of the temple.
[1:39:38] And I can say this that we therefore are
[1:39:40] reflected in it in the shadows and
[1:39:42] types.
[1:39:44] In 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 23 it says,
[1:39:46] "And the very God of peace sanctify you
[1:39:48] holy.
[1:39:50] And I pray God your whole spirit and
[1:39:53] soul in body
[1:39:55] be preserved blameless under the coming
[1:39:57] of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; So we know that we are body, spirit,
[1:40:00] soul.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; That man is a triune being.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's a three-
[1:40:05] room house,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; a three compartment service. One is your
[1:40:09] body, what you do for Christ. The other
[1:40:11] is your spirit, what you think of
[1:40:12] Christ. The other is your soul. the
[1:40:14] faith that you have in Christ. Notice
[1:40:15] how he's able to break that up and put
[1:40:17] these different applications on it. So
[1:40:19] each one has a utility. Each one has a
[1:40:21] use. Each one forms who you are. He says
[1:40:25] three room house completely absolutely
[1:40:29] dedicated to the service of the living
[1:40:31] God.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; That's what makes us what we are.
[1:40:35] Without without one of those rooms, you
[1:40:38] aren't that house. Right?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Completely absolutelyututely dedicated
[1:40:42] to the service of the living God. 1
[1:40:44] Corinthians 6:19 says, "Know you not
[1:40:46] that your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:40:48] Ghost which is in you, which you have of
[1:40:50] God, and you are not your own." Peter
[1:40:52] says, "YOU ARE LIVELY STONES BUILT up to
[1:40:55] a spiritual house."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; this is what God made you to be.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; This is this is not poetry.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not analogy that if I
[1:41:04] could just have the mind of God in terms
[1:41:06] of just adopt moral principles that are
[1:41:08] Christlike and I can treat human beings
[1:41:10] as as Jesus taught us that we must treat
[1:41:12] them. If I could just use the Bible as a
[1:41:14] an analogy or an allegory of good works
[1:41:17] and I could do that then somehow through
[1:41:19] the theqi and and this universal energy
[1:41:21] I could be a good person. No, God wants
[1:41:24] to inhabit you.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; God has ordained you and SET YOU ASIDE
[1:41:28] TO be his dwelling place.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; And you have to you are a three- room
[1:41:35] house, body, spirit, soul.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 10:5,
[1:41:44] wherefore when he cometh into the world,
[1:41:46] he saith, sacrifice and offering thou
[1:41:49] wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[1:41:52] prepared me.
[1:41:54] This is what we see in Jesus Christ
[1:41:57] that this Jesus was a born of a a woman
[1:42:02] and yet not conceived by man. And God
[1:42:06] said, "This is my beloved son in whom
[1:42:08] I'm well pleased to dwell." This is what
[1:42:09] God was aiming for all along.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; A dwelling place,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; a body thou hast prepared me.
[1:42:16] God is not desiring the sacrifice of uh
[1:42:20] physical restraint and abstaining from
[1:42:22] sin or evil works.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; If that was the case, then uh then we we
[1:42:27] put the same diligence into being the
[1:42:31] body of God that vegans do in terms of
[1:42:33] not eating red meat.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Just discipline,
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; That I I I'm going to restrain. I'm
[1:42:39] going to limit myself. I'm going to
[1:42:41] sacrifice this. I'm going to give that.
[1:42:44] And
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; and if that's all our lives become is
[1:42:46] restraint and then and giving that
[1:42:48] that's not what God wants. God says, "I
[1:42:50] want a body."
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; He's not wanting us to be disciplined
[1:42:54] and that we restrain from doing things.
[1:42:55] Nor is he just wanting the offering of
[1:42:57] good works.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; I don't smoke and drink and I give to
[1:43:00] the poor. I don't do this, BUT I DO DO
[1:43:02] THIS. THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD'S WANTING. We
[1:43:04] could say that modern Christianity and
[1:43:05] even just morality anymore is the re
[1:43:08] refusing to do bad things and the desire
[1:43:10] to do good things. But he's wanting more
[1:43:13] than that. He wants a body.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; He wants a dwelling place where he can
[1:43:18] commune. HE CAN HAVE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP.
[1:43:20] What does he want? HE WANTS A BETHL in
[1:43:21] you.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO BE A BETHL.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT'S
[1:43:26] MY TABERNACLE. THAT'S MY DWELLING PLACE.
[1:43:29] WHEN THEY TOOK THAT TEMPLE UH WHEN THEY
[1:43:31] BUILT THE TABERNACLE IN THE WILDERNESS
[1:43:33] and even when they placed the ark of
[1:43:34] their testimony IN ITS SOCKETS, BROTHER
[1:43:36] MAN BEGINS TO DESCRIBE HOW THAT THE
[1:43:38] PRESENCE OF GOD CAME A AND GOD WAS SO
[1:43:40] PLEASED BECAUSE GOD FOUND HIS REST.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And he said when THE HOLY GHOST FELL ON
[1:43:45] THE DAY OF PENTECOST, THAT WAS JUST LIKE
[1:43:47] THAT TIME WHEN THE ARK OF THE TESTIMONY
[1:43:49] FOUND ITS PLACE BEHIND THAT VEIL. THAT
[1:43:51] WHEN GOD'S SPIRIT WAS POURED OUT ON THE
[1:43:53] DAY OF PENTECOST AND HE FELL INTO THE
[1:43:54] SOULS OF MAN AND WOMAN THAT THAT WAS GOD
[1:43:57] FINDING HIS RESTING place
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; that God finds rest in you and I
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; so our body I'm wanting to emphasize
[1:44:05] this in these few scriptures that Bethl
[1:44:08] is a place on earth where God dwells.
[1:44:10] Bethl is heaven on earth
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; and then you are a temple of God where
[1:44:14] God desires through the new birth to
[1:44:15] dwell in your soul. The new birth is the
[1:44:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost. By that you
[1:44:19] become a sealed son of God into the body
[1:44:21] of Christ. AND CHRIST IS IN YOU, THE
[1:44:23] hope of glory.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:26] personally to you.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; He wants a body. He wants a dwelling
[1:44:31] place. So your body, you as an
[1:44:33] individual, you are a temple of the
[1:44:35] Lord.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; But this this Bethl extends beyond just
[1:44:39] the individual, but also your family.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Your home. I even say your place where
[1:44:44] you live and your church should also be
[1:44:48] gates of heaven.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; What do you become when you become a
[1:44:52] child of God? You become a book
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; read of all men.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; It it it's a point at which heaven
[1:44:58] begins to make itself known.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And therefore our not only should we but
[1:45:03] also our houses and our churches should
[1:45:05] be gates of heaven. Yeah. And
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; we have this duty to consecrate and to
[1:45:10] set aside not just ourselves but our
[1:45:12] home and our church as gates of heaven.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Notice this in the scripture and I'm I'm
[1:45:19] realizing now uh I I didn't find out
[1:45:21] till this afternoon that I wasn't
[1:45:23] preaching tomorrow night in a
[1:45:25] traditional sense, but we were going to
[1:45:27] be with sticky fingers for making
[1:45:29] s'mores and the smell of a campfire, you
[1:45:31] know, talking to one another. It's going
[1:45:33] to be just a little bit of different
[1:45:34] setting. And so I I'm just not sure
[1:45:37] what's going to happen tomorrow night.
[1:45:38] Come just for that reason alone.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Ju just come thinking we have no idea
[1:45:43] this could go viral. We got to see
[1:45:44] what's going to happen.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And so I'm not sure just how much time
[1:45:48] we're going to have to explore these
[1:45:49] things, but I I can at least uh use this
[1:45:52] now for you to begin to think about more
[1:45:54] deeply about this that you I believe we
[1:45:56] can accept by scripture that our hearts
[1:45:58] are to be a place for God.
[1:46:01] But there is a further desire then that
[1:46:03] if the individual is a dwelling place of
[1:46:06] God, God then wants to have preeminence
[1:46:08] in your home life. And he certainly
[1:46:11] should be welcome in our churches.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; You know, every church must preach
[1:46:15] salvation and divine healing
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; that that there must be a place where
[1:46:19] Christ is made available as the the
[1:46:22] healer and the deliverer and the savior.
[1:46:24] But in 1 Timothy 3:5, it says, "For if a
[1:46:27] man know not how to rule his own house,
[1:46:30] right?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; How shall he take care of the church of
[1:46:33] God?"
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Paul is immediately drawing a parallel.
[1:46:36] I say immediately, but what he is doing
[1:46:39] here in the scripture I chose to use is
[1:46:41] he's drawing a parallel between what a
[1:46:43] man's home life is like and the church.
[1:46:46] Yeah.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, IF HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
[1:46:48] to rule his own family, I
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; if he doesn't have exhibit a wisdom and
[1:46:53] grace uh and and patience and love and
[1:46:56] he doesn't have certain characteristics
[1:46:57] at home,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; then then what what kind of person will
[1:47:01] he be in his in a church if he rules?
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I think it's been said before, watch how
[1:47:06] a man treats his wife and then you'll
[1:47:09] know how he treats his church.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we know just exactly how
[1:47:13] they treat their wives. And we're like,
[1:47:14] oh my goodness, poor church. Yeah.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; But then we may not know their personal
[1:47:17] life. Just see how they treat the
[1:47:19] church. And you can say, "Oh my
[1:47:20] goodness, I feel bad for his wife."
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Because there are uh ideologies and
[1:47:26] images of leadership that are very very
[1:47:27] carnal
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; and they think, man, a man ruling his
[1:47:31] house, that that's one fit. And so it's
[1:47:32] more fear and abuse and intimidation a
[1:47:36] codependency which is just rife uh uh
[1:47:38] for manipulation and abuse. And so he's
[1:47:41] not saying that THIS RULE HAS GOT TO be
[1:47:43] a a a dictator,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; but there is a parallel where how a man
[1:47:50] governs his home is going to determine
[1:47:52] whether OR NOT HE'S FIT TO GOVERN a
[1:47:54] church.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Because if a MAN CANNOT GOVERN HIS own
[1:47:57] house, how shall he govern? Paul is
[1:47:58] saying, AND HE'S ASKING IT RHETORICALLY
[1:48:00] TO SAY, IF HE CAN'T MANAGE his own
[1:48:02] personal affairs, he shouldn't be
[1:48:03] managing the affairs of God's house.
[1:48:05] Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; So from a from a higher level
[1:48:09] perspective in terms of office in a
[1:48:11] church, we must rule our own bodies and
[1:48:14] our homes if we want any kind of service
[1:48:16] or role in a church to be right.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; This should apply to all of us.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I think we should take a personal
[1:48:23] responsibility for the character of the
[1:48:25] church.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; That we should we should say, wow, this
[1:48:28] church is this church only exists to
[1:48:31] serve individuals and families. And so
[1:48:34] the beauty of the church, the strength
[1:48:35] of the church is how strong individuals
[1:48:36] are and how strong families are. So we
[1:48:38] don't kind of come here to cosplay as
[1:48:40] Christians.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; We don't kind of show up and LIKE, WELL
[1:48:43] NOW, AS LONG AS WE GO TO BETHL AND WE'RE
[1:48:45] here going to church, then then I could
[1:48:48] say I BELONG TO SOMETHING BEYOND MYSELF
[1:48:50] and that what brother Jason preaches
[1:48:52] that reflects who I am and how they
[1:48:54] live. It reflects how we live. No,
[1:48:55] you're the you ARE THE CHURCH.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE WHAT MAKES UP ITS CHARACTER.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And some may be asking, "Well, I
[1:49:05] wonder if Brother Aaron even knows the
[1:49:06] name of the church." Well, it was
[1:49:08] intentional. Building Bethl, it was
[1:49:10] intentional.
[1:49:12] You didn't change the church when you
[1:49:13] change the name of the church and you
[1:49:14] change the outside, right? Like, it's
[1:49:16] still the same. I went to your website
[1:49:17] the other day and it was down. You might
[1:49:19] need to find someone who knows how to do
[1:49:21] websites or something.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; So we must rule our house.
[1:49:32] We must rule our bodies before we rule
[1:49:34] our homes.
[1:49:36] And in a more in this image of the
[1:49:38] individual and his home, those those
[1:49:41] elements being there, the testimony and
[1:49:43] the and the character is what's required
[1:49:46] to serve in church.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; So our heart is a home for heaven. And
[1:49:50] then our house, if our heart is a home
[1:49:52] for heaven, then home should be a house
[1:49:54] should be a home for our hearts.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; That's that's a good perspective to
[1:49:58] approach it. Say, well, we don't want to
[1:50:00] just have a place where we keep our
[1:50:01] stuff and we lay our heads, but we want
[1:50:03] to have a place where we feel at home.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It's one of the the great reasons why we
[1:50:07] try to you want to have a the token
[1:50:10] applied and you make decisions about the
[1:50:11] atmosphere within your home because it's
[1:50:13] all for the purpose of making a place
[1:50:15] where you feel at home.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the story brother
[1:50:19] Badam tells where he married a very rich
[1:50:21] couple. He did perform the ceremony for
[1:50:23] them and he said he went to the house
[1:50:25] and everything was just so ornate and so
[1:50:27] beautiful and had this beautiful view
[1:50:28] overlooking the river and I went and
[1:50:30] looked up the h the not the homes per se
[1:50:32] but the family that he was referring to
[1:50:34] as a very wealthy family in that area
[1:50:36] and he said he had performed their
[1:50:37] wedding ceremony and as he's walking up
[1:50:39] to the house he just hears the bickering
[1:50:41] and the fighting and the things that was
[1:50:42] going on in their social life but as
[1:50:44] soon as the door was open it WAS LIKE OH
[1:50:46] HI REVEREND Brandham and we would look
[1:50:48] at that and if I could just give you an
[1:50:50] example today if we just saw that
[1:50:52] snapshot of their house when they open
[1:50:54] the DOOR AND SAID, "OH, REVEREND
[1:50:55] BRANDHAM, THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S
[1:50:57] Instagram is."
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; That moment, RIGHT, OF OH, LOOK AT OUR
[1:51:02] LIFE.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "WELL, THAT'S THE LIFE. I
[1:51:04] WANT TO LIVE THAT LIFE. I WANT TO ASPIRE
[1:51:06] TO HAVE THOSE THINGS. I I I want UH THAT
[1:51:08] THEY MUST HAVE A REAL happy place." But
[1:51:11] then he tells the story of a poor couple
[1:51:12] that he married. And my when he gets
[1:51:14] into the details of it, we would our by
[1:51:16] our rules today, we would say that uh no
[1:51:19] god-fearing man would ever marry that
[1:51:20] couple because that man's got to have
[1:51:22] this and they've got to have that. They
[1:51:23] got all sorts of rules in terms of how
[1:51:25] marriage should take place today. Uh
[1:51:27] just saying
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; and yet he marries this couple AND WHAT
[1:51:30] THEY HAD FOR EACH OTHER IS LOVE AND THIS
[1:51:32] RESPECT.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; He said in the very shadows of that
[1:51:35] house on the hill, he went to visit this
[1:51:37] couple living in a rail car. Right.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And when he sees them, he just hears
[1:51:43] them talking to one another. Oh, honey,
[1:51:45] I know we don't have much, but I saw
[1:51:46] this. I want you to have it. And they
[1:51:47] were in love. And he, Brother Brandham
[1:51:49] said, if I ever found a heaven on earth,
[1:51:53] it was
[1:51:55] there was heaven on earth.
[1:51:58] Not not just not just your heart is
[1:52:00] heaven on earth, but the home could be a
[1:52:02] heaven on earth. Your heart it ought to
[1:52:06] be a dwelling place for God. But why
[1:52:07] would we stop there? God wants your
[1:52:10] house to be a Bethl.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; He wants your family to be a place where
[1:52:14] God is welcome.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; When we speak of Bethl, when when even
[1:52:18] the in the naming of this church, Bethl
[1:52:20] tabernacle, it's not just to represent a
[1:52:22] place where you come to worship, but it
[1:52:24] even represents on a high level WHAT YOU
[1:52:26] OUGHT TO BE, WHAT YOUR FAMILIES OUGHT TO
[1:52:27] BE, AND WHAT ETERNITY is going to be.
[1:52:29] Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Bethl is a place where we as the church
[1:52:33] live
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and and and where we as the church,
[1:52:37] Bethl is a place where we as the
[1:52:39] individual that make up the church where
[1:52:40] we live and even this church becomes a
[1:52:43] place where others can meet him.
[1:52:46] This church should be a gate of heaven.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Your home where you live should be a
[1:52:51] gate of heaven.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; You as an individual should be a gate of
[1:52:54] heaven.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Places where others can meet him. place
[1:52:58] where his wisdom, his presence can be
[1:53:00] communicated.
[1:53:03] In 1 Timothy chapter 3:15,
[1:53:07] this this connects to again to what he
[1:53:10] said um in verse 5. If a man can't rule
[1:53:13] his own house, how shall he take care of
[1:53:14] the church of God? But if I tar long
[1:53:16] that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
[1:53:18] to behave thyself in the house of God,
[1:53:21] which is the church of the living God,
[1:53:23] the pillar and the ground of truth.
[1:53:26] I
[1:53:28] What I've tried to transition to now is
[1:53:29] we go from you the individual to your
[1:53:32] personal family or your home.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; But now the church
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; because he says how we ought to behave
[1:53:37] ourselves of the house of God. The
[1:53:40] individual is filled with the Holy
[1:53:41] Ghost. If that individual doesn't know
[1:53:43] how to rule his own house, so there's
[1:53:44] the other Bethl, how shall he take care
[1:53:46] of the church of God? And now he says,
[1:53:48] how we behave in the house of God, which
[1:53:50] is the church of the living God, the
[1:53:51] pillar and ground of truth. He brings
[1:53:53] together this great image of the
[1:53:56] mythical body of Jesus Christ, the
[1:53:59] mystical body of Jesus Christ. He brings
[1:54:01] it together in the church and the local
[1:54:03] gathering. Paul, HE'S CALLING THAT THIS
[1:54:06] GATHERING THAT WE HAVE tonight is a
[1:54:08] gathering of believers. It is is a house
[1:54:12] of God.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; He's likening our gathering together for
[1:54:17] worship as a temple, as a dwelling place
[1:54:20] of God. He calls it the house of God.
[1:54:23] the sermon. Why? Brother Bam said, 'What
[1:54:24] makes a person want to drink and run
[1:54:26] around and act like that? It's because
[1:54:28] we don't have any God. He says, "Is it
[1:54:30] because we don't have any God? Is it
[1:54:32] because there's no joy in the house of
[1:54:34] the Lord anymore?
[1:54:36] Is it because the Holy Spirit isn't
[1:54:37] ready to bless all of us? Is there
[1:54:39] anything wrong with it? But because we
[1:54:41] do it, there's a reason we're cursed.
[1:54:44] The reason God's put this thing upon the
[1:54:46] church, this cold and dampness, we're
[1:54:48] going to other places for pleasure
[1:54:50] instead of coming to the house of the
[1:54:52] Lord for pleasure.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; The the the world exceeds
[1:54:58] in attention gra attention grabbing.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; We do we do not have a a really there's
[1:55:04] been studies on it. It says uh and there
[1:55:06] was a study long ago which was kind of
[1:55:07] falsified by Microsoft. Thanks
[1:55:10] Microsoft. uh they said our attention
[1:55:12] span is only eight seconds. I think they
[1:55:14] got the rodeo mixed up with the study,
[1:55:16] but the point wasn't that man has a
[1:55:18] attention span of eight seconds, but
[1:55:20] there's so many other things to distract
[1:55:21] us
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; and that there's so many gimmicks now to
[1:55:24] try to keep us keep us locked in.
[1:55:28] And nowadays
[1:55:30] what they're measuring through the way
[1:55:33] that they've establish.
[1:55:36] You're thinking, "Well, I'm glad brother
[1:55:37] got out of the the the ancient ages as
[1:55:41] up here in the modern times, the stone
[1:55:42] age now into the modern times." But it's
[1:55:44] not what you click on, it's how long you
[1:55:47] stay.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; There's a timer determining whether or
[1:55:52] not they've hooked you and how long
[1:55:54] you're staying
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and how quickly you move on to the next.
[1:55:56] And if they notice that you be you
[1:55:58] scroll at a certain pace when you're not
[1:56:01] interested and you pause when something
[1:56:02] gets your attention, put another stone
[1:56:05] in the weight in the algorithm. Feed
[1:56:08] them more of that.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; And see how long they look.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; And then whenever you start scrolling,
[1:56:14] you got to intensify. You got to change
[1:56:15] it up. You got to you got to lead them
[1:56:17] now to the next. And that's how people's
[1:56:19] vices get worse and worse and worse.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; But he says here, there's no joy
[1:56:23] anymore. He says there's no pleasure. We
[1:56:25] get our pleasure in these other things
[1:56:26] instead of coming to the house of the
[1:56:27] Lord for pleasure.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; You might look at coming to church as a
[1:56:31] chore that you just have to do. But you
[1:56:33] should be willing. David said, "One
[1:56:35] thing have I desired of the Lord, that
[1:56:37] will I seek after." I WAS GLAD WHEN THEY
[1:56:38] SAID UNTO ME, "Let us go into the house
[1:56:40] of THE LORD." WE'VE LOST THAT JOY.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; We go with, "Wow, without suffering,
[1:56:44] you're not made perfect." So I'm glad we
[1:56:46] meet twice a week so I can suffer so I
[1:56:49] can be made perfect.
[1:56:50] Now the kind of suffering you need,
[1:56:52] that's why you have seven days a week is
[1:56:54] that's how much suffering you need to be
[1:56:55] made perfect. You should come to the
[1:56:57] house of God for joy.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; He said the house of the Lord is the joy
[1:57:02] of the Lord.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Just as God finds strength in you and
[1:57:07] and wants to have a place in you, HE
[1:57:09] SAYS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD is the joy of
[1:57:11] the Lord. THE JOY OF THE LORD IS THE JOY
[1:57:13] OF HIS PEOPLE.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO COME TO church and
[1:57:16] worship him and be happy and be
[1:57:17] satisfied. Give him praise.
[1:57:19] Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; He wants you to come to church.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Therefore, what he does want you to do
[1:57:24] is go to church, not stay home and
[1:57:27] string.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; If if I ever once really sat down, push
[1:57:31] played, and obeyed, I'd find myself
[1:57:33] going to church. He wants you to go to
[1:57:34] church, worship, be happy, satisfied,
[1:57:37] giving praise and honor and glory and
[1:57:38] wisdom and might and power to God. He
[1:57:40] wants you to do that.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; So, we are TO BE VESSELS OF THE DWELLING
[1:57:44] PLACE OF GOD. AND OUR FAMILIES ARE TO BE
[1:57:46] A CONSECRATED PLACE WHERE where the Lord
[1:57:48] has preeminence in our homes. Listen, as
[1:57:49] soon as Jesus leaves our homes,
[1:57:51] trouble's on the way. BUT THEN HE ALSO
[1:57:53] WANTS US TO GO TO church
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; and the unchangeable word of God. He
[1:57:58] said God makes a distinction. God gives
[1:57:59] a mark on the people. If he believes,
[1:58:02] these signs shall follow them that
[1:58:03] believe. The believer, not they that say
[1:58:06] they believe or not the supposed
[1:58:08] believer, but the real believer. And he
[1:58:11] says, "I want to belong to a church
[1:58:13] that's got them signs and wonders
[1:58:15] following it. That's where I want to
[1:58:17] have my fellowship, right under the
[1:58:19] blood of Jesus Christ. We're angels and
[1:58:21] powers and the HOLY GHOST AND GOD WORKS
[1:58:24] BACK and forth through his church,
[1:58:25] THROUGH HIS PEOPLE, SHOWING SIGNS AND
[1:58:27] WONDERS. WHY? IT'S THE GREATEST THING I
[1:58:29] EVER NOTED in my life. It's part of
[1:58:32] heaven on earth."
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Part of heaven on earth. you when your
[1:58:39] soul becomes a dwelling place of God,
[1:58:40] heaven is deposited in your soul.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; But then a home that is rightly aligned
[1:58:45] that that poor couple. He says, "If I
[1:58:47] ever found heaven on earth, I found it
[1:58:48] in that box car that day."
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "A church where God
[1:58:52] the word has its preeminence." And he
[1:58:53] says, "The Holy Ghost and the power of
[1:58:55] God's working through." He says, "That's
[1:58:56] a part of heaven on earth."
[1:59:00] These are the Bethls.
[1:59:03] And there's a parallel among these three
[1:59:04] gates, your body, your house, and the
[1:59:07] church.
[1:59:09] I believe that our home life should
[1:59:11] reflect the hidden life.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And so we have the dwelling place of God
[1:59:15] in your soul. That's that's invisible.
[1:59:17] That's the hidden life.
[1:59:19] But then church exists to promote the
[1:59:21] health and well-being of your hidden
[1:59:23] life.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; It it feeds that hidden life. It exists
[1:59:27] to promote the the well-being of your
[1:59:29] body, of the individual, and also your
[1:59:31] home. And we have to have all three
[1:59:35] together. They they constitute that
[1:59:37] three room house. Brother Ram in the
[1:59:39] sermon knoweth it not begins to look
[1:59:40] into these things. He says there's three
[1:59:44] rings, three circles. He says that's
[1:59:45] you. That's God. The trinity is one.
[1:59:48] Without a trinity, he's not God. He
[1:59:49] can't be manifested any other way. And
[1:59:51] neither can you be manifested without
[1:59:53] the Trinity person that you are. That's
[1:59:55] body, spirit, soul. Without either of
[1:59:58] them, you are not complete.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; So, you could have a good home life and
[2:00:02] a really good church, but if you don't
[2:00:04] have the Holy Ghost in your heart,
[2:00:05] you're not complete.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD HAVE THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR
[2:00:07] HEART AND YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY GOOD
[2:00:08] CHURCH, BUT IF YOUR HOME LIFE'S NOT
[2:00:10] RIGHT, you're not complete.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; You have to have You could BE A REALLY
[2:00:14] SOUL-FILLED, SPIRITFILLED CHRISTIAN,
[2:00:15] HAVE A GOOD HOME LIFE, but you also HAVE
[2:00:17] TO HAVE A CHURCH LIFE.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; You have to have a BODY THAT YOU'RE A
[2:00:20] PART OF OR YOU'RE NOT COMPLETE. DO
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE THAT'S THE LONGING OF MANY
[2:00:24] PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE TO STREAM IS THEY'RE
[2:00:26] NOT DOING IT AS a substitute. They're
[2:00:28] doing it because THEY KNOW GOD DESIRES
[2:00:29] THEM AND WANTS THEM TO BE A PART OF A
[2:00:31] FAMILY, PART of a church.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; They want to have a Bethl to go to.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT ANY ALL THREE OF THEM, YOU
[2:00:38] ARE NOT COMPLETE.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; You have to have all three.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; The soul, that's the real you.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; The inside of the inside, the inner man,
[2:00:49] that's the most private.
[2:00:51] Think of the the the analogy of the
[2:00:53] three- room house. Then you have the
[2:00:55] your spirit. The man is a soul and the
[2:00:57] man is a spirit. He says those three
[2:00:59] rings, the soul, that's where God dwells
[2:01:00] in you. And so that's your soul. Then
[2:01:03] you think of your spirit. And if you
[2:01:05] think in terms of a house, there's some
[2:01:07] things that are hidden and more
[2:01:08] personal, but not quite as personal as
[2:01:10] what's on the inside of the inside.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; And then your body. Everyone sees your
[2:01:15] body.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; They see your physical image. Well,
[2:01:18] that's the church. It's visible. Yeah,
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; it's public.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Was everyone invited to service tonight?
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I was kind of hoping it was by
[2:01:28] invitation only. That way I wouldn't
[2:01:30] take it personal.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Unless you handed out more invitations
[2:01:34] than what we see here, I could still
[2:01:35] take it personal. I had somebody tell me
[2:01:38] one one time that I wasn't their cup of
[2:01:40] tea. And they're very faithful in our
[2:01:41] church. Very faithful. I almost said
[2:01:43] that like Trump. Very faithful. Good
[2:01:45] people, right? Very faithful people in
[2:01:48] our church. And but they said, "You're
[2:01:49] not really uh you're not really my cup
[2:01:51] of tea. I I I maybe prefer something
[2:01:53] different." And I just told him, I said,
[2:01:55] "I know that because if I thought I was
[2:01:58] everyone's cup of tea, I'd be
[2:01:59] depressed."
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Like, "Why isn't everybody coming? Why
[2:02:03] isn't our church bursting at the seams?
[2:02:07] Where was I?" Oh, that's right. Church
[2:02:09] is public. That's the outward part. It's
[2:02:12] the part everyone can come in contact.
[2:02:14] Everyone's invited here, but not
[2:02:15] everyone makes it to your home.
[2:02:18] And then though people may make it to
[2:02:19] your home, they they don't know the
[2:02:20] inside of the inside your heart.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; These all these three exist.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; So we have if I could just use this as
[2:02:29] our our closing moments intentionally
[2:02:31] vague.
[2:02:34] We must we must dedicate
[2:02:38] we must build. We have a duty to build
[2:02:40] and dedicate these gates. soul,
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; spirit,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; body.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Individual, family, church. We have a
[2:02:49] duty to dedicate these homes to God.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; If we have time, we may explore it in
[2:02:55] greater detail that just anybody could
[2:02:56] have a house, but it takes more than a
[2:02:58] house to have a home.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; We must be able, we must dedicate soul,
[2:03:04] individual, family, church as a bethl, a
[2:03:07] home for heaven.
[2:03:10] We whether it be your body, your family
[2:03:13] or your house or your church must be
[2:03:16] must become they must be gates of
[2:03:18] heaven.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; It's the point where God has contact
[2:03:21] with the earth.
[2:03:23] It's the point at which his his
[2:03:25] characteristics are made known, his
[2:03:27] attributes are expressed where others
[2:03:28] can have access to God. It's a place to
[2:03:31] see God manifested in me, in my family,
[2:03:34] in my church. A place where truth CAN BE
[2:03:37] RECEIVED BY ME in our home, in our
[2:03:39] church.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; But the gates are also where the en
[2:03:43] enemy attacks.
[2:03:45] If the gates are weakened, we can be
[2:03:48] made vulnerable.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; It's through the gates that the enemy
[2:03:51] has access.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; In Ezekiel 21:15, it says, "I have set
[2:03:56] the point of the sword against all their
[2:03:59] gates."
[2:04:04] all their gates that their heart may
[2:04:06] faint and their ruins be multiplied. Ah,
[2:04:09] it is made bright. It is wrapped up for
[2:04:10] the slaughter. The word that's used in
[2:04:13] the Hebrew, all their gates, it's used
[2:04:15] to refer to a city, a palace, and a
[2:04:18] house.
[2:04:20] All their gates, your church,
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; your family, and you. They're all on
[2:04:25] Satan's radar because without all of
[2:04:27] them, you're not complete. So, if he
[2:04:29] could just compromise the one, he could
[2:04:30] say, "Game's not over yet."
[2:04:33] So we have a duty. If the gate then is a
[2:04:35] place where the enemy wants to draw and
[2:04:37] point his sword at you, at your family,
[2:04:39] at the church. If these are places and
[2:04:41] points of attack, then we have a duty to
[2:04:43] guard them.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; We have a duty to build these gates up,
[2:04:47] build our hearts up, build our homes up,
[2:04:49] build our church up.
[2:04:51] And in Psalms 147 12 and 13, we'll
[2:04:55] invite the musicians to come. SAYS,
[2:04:57] "PRAISE THE LORD, O JERUSALEM. PRAISE
[2:04:59] THY GOD, O ZION, for he hath
[2:05:02] strengthened the bars of thy gates. He
[2:05:05] has blessed thy children within thee.
[2:05:08] If I could say this, and I can say it
[2:05:10] about this church, Bethl is a place
[2:05:12] where heaven is welcome.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] Bethl is a place where the word is
[2:05:17] expressed.
[2:05:19] Bethl is a place where God manifest
[2:05:21] himself.
[2:05:23] So if we're building Bethl, what we
[2:05:26] desire to have is to be a heavenly place
[2:05:29] where God dwells. That's what I want for
[2:05:31] my my my person, my individual self. I
[2:05:34] want to be a a place where God dwells.
[2:05:37] That's what I want for my family and my
[2:05:39] home, my home life. Apply when I say
[2:05:41] apply the token to the home, it it very
[2:05:43] specifically refers to this dwelling
[2:05:45] place where the household lays, where
[2:05:47] your possessions are. It's the place you
[2:05:48] return back to.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; It could be a apartment. It could be a
[2:05:52] cottage. It could be a basement suite.
[2:05:53] It could be any any kind of dwelling
[2:05:55] place. But that place too must be
[2:05:57] consecrated to God.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; LET US NOT FOOL OURSELVES. WE CAN'T SAY,
[2:06:01] "WELL, I'VE GOT THE HOLY Ghost in me."
[2:06:02] And then we return to a place that HAS
[2:06:04] THINGS ON THE WALLS AND THINGS PLAYED
[2:06:06] and things we interact in and THINGS WE
[2:06:08] ENJOY AND say that we we're feeding that
[2:06:10] Christian experience and that we have a
[2:06:12] sanctuary AND THAT THE TOKENS APPLIED.
[2:06:14] GOD WANTS THAT PLACE UH UM SET ASIDE FOR
[2:06:17] HIM BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT RIGHT, THEN
[2:06:19] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL COMPLETE.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMETIMES WE IMMEDIATELY GO TO
[2:06:23] BLAMING UH BLAMING THE CHURCH FOR ALL
[2:06:25] OUR OUR PROBLEMS. WELL, THAT COULD BE
[2:06:27] PART OF THE PROBLEM, BUT YOUR SOUL HAS
[2:06:29] TO BE RIGHT. YOUR HOME LIFE HAS TO BE
[2:06:30] RIGHT. AND CHURCH NEEDS TO BE RIGHT FOR
[2:06:32] YOU TO BE COMPLETE.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; And so, we want our church to be the
[2:06:36] same place where God dwells.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Where he's made known where he can we
[2:06:40] others can meet him. That's what Bethl
[2:06:43] is. A place where God dwells,
[2:06:47] is made known,
[2:06:49] and where others can meet him.
[2:06:53] In the sermon, God hiding himself in
[2:06:55] simplicity, then revealed himself in the
[2:06:57] same
[2:06:59] brother Brandham makes this beautiful
[2:07:01] statement at the beginning. He says, I
[2:07:03] think it's our duty to make the inside
[2:07:04] right by the grace of God.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; He's talking about a physical building.
[2:07:09] He says, it looks beautiful on the
[2:07:10] outside.
[2:07:13] So I it's striking
[2:07:17] and and I remember brother Jason and
[2:07:19] sister Debbie just sharing with us their
[2:07:21] visions for the remodels in this church
[2:07:22] years ago [music]
[2:07:24] and I could say it's coming to pass
[2:07:27] the the way that it looks it it it it's
[2:07:30] beautiful to the eye but brother says we
[2:07:31] have a duty to make the inside right
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God
[2:07:37] to be so grateful to God that this will
[2:07:39] just not be a beautiful building that we
[2:07:41] come to but May everyone who comes in
[2:07:45] see the beautiful characteristic of
[2:07:48] Jesus Christ in every person that comes
[2:07:50] in.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; So the church can be a beautiful
[2:07:55] building, but it does not become a
[2:07:57] beautiful church until beautiful people
[2:07:59] come in. And I know some of you are
[2:08:00] going, "Man, I'm bringing down the
[2:08:02] average." But that's not what he's
[2:08:03] referring to. He's talking about
[2:08:05] character. [music]
[2:08:07] MAY IT BE A CONSECRATED PLACE TO our
[2:08:09] Lord. The consecrated people, NO MATTER
[2:08:12] HOW BEAUTIFUL THE structure is. And he
[2:08:15] said that we certainly do appreciate the
[2:08:18] beauty of the church is the character of
[2:08:20] the people. He says, I trust it will
[2:08:23] always be a house of God of beauty. One
[2:08:26] thing have I desired of the Lord, that
[2:08:28] will I seek after, that I may dwell in
[2:08:30] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[2:08:32] life, to inquire in the temple. AND TO
[2:08:34] BEHOLD, TO BEHOLD THE BEAUTY of the
[2:08:36] Lord.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; WE WOULD NOT SEE THE BEAUTY of the Lord
[2:08:39] unless we see people dwelling together
[2:08:41] in unity. We do NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF
[2:08:43] THE LORD UNLESS WE SEE THE BEAUTY OF
[2:08:44] HOLINESS. WE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY of
[2:08:46] the Lord TILL WE SEE THE BEAUTY OF
[2:08:47] PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING. AND WE SEE THE
[2:08:50] WORD BEING LIFTED up and heaven
[2:08:51] preeminence. AND WE SEE THE HEARTS OF
[2:08:53] THE PEOPLE BEING CHANGED BY THAT. THAT'S
[2:08:55] THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; The beauty of the church is the
[2:09:00] character of the people. The character
[2:09:01] of the people cannot come unless the
[2:09:03] word is first.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Let the word have preeminence in your
[2:09:07] individual life. HE CAN HAVE MORE
[2:09:09] PREEMINENCE IN YOUR HOME LIFE. AND THEN
[2:09:11] THIS CHURCH, THE WORD WILL HAVE
[2:09:12] PREEMINENCE BECAUSE IT STARTS IN THE
[2:09:15] INDIVIDUAL that then begins to make up
[2:09:16] the families. And therefore, I believe
[2:09:18] with all my heart that we do not exist
[2:09:20] to make church beautiful, but churches
[2:09:22] exist to help us get ready.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; What's all the rage these days? I'm
[2:09:26] going to look at some of the sisters.
[2:09:27] Get ready with me. RIGHT? THAT'S EXACTLY
[2:09:30] WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS, IS A
[2:09:32] GET READY WITH ME VIDEO. SO, THIS IS
[2:09:34] WHAT WE GOT TO DO TO GET OUT OF HERE.
[2:09:35] AND SO, THE CHURCH EXISTS TO GIVE YOU
[2:09:37] THE RESOURCES AND TO SUPPORT YOU TO BE A
[2:09:41] PLACE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH SO THAT ONE DAY
[2:09:43] IT JUST OVERFLOWS into eternity. And we
[2:09:45] leave here. Amen.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; That let heaven have its preeminence
[2:09:49] here. THAT AS WE GET READY to leave, as
[2:09:51] we begin to make ourselves READY FOR A
[2:09:53] TRANSLATION, WE'RE ALLOWING HEAVEN TO
[2:09:55] HAVE PREEMINENCE HERE TO THE POINT TO
[2:09:57] WHERE HEAVEN AND EARTH JUST going to
[2:09:58] blend together.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; And we're changed in a moment, in a
[2:10:01] twinkling of an eye and find ourselves
[2:10:04] for a season in that dimension in the
[2:10:06] air, one day to come right back here,
[2:10:11] live out a thousand years. But
[2:10:12] ultimately, where does the future home
[2:10:14] set? right here on earth. God's vision
[2:10:18] all along has never been for us [music]
[2:10:20] to uh go into the seventh dimension, but
[2:10:23] that the seventh dimension could have
[2:10:24] full preeminence and manifestation
[2:10:27] expression here
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; on earth. So I say let it start with
[2:10:31] you.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; You become the first Bethl.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Consecrate our homes as Bethl
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; and this church will live up to its
[2:10:39] namesake
[2:10:41] as we let [music] God have preeminence.
[2:10:42] could just stand together
[2:10:46] if you would like just another
[2:10:49] rededication.
[2:10:50] Let's just pray together. Maybe just
[2:10:52] lift your hand before the Lord and say,
[2:10:55] "Lord, I I want to be a dwelling place.
[2:10:57] I want your beauty to be seen in me."
[2:11:00] And we could say the same as it was in
[2:11:01] the days of Christ that when God was
[2:11:03] manifesting himself in his full beauty,
[2:11:05] the world turned their eyes from him
[2:11:08] because they couldn't see the beauty in
[2:11:09] him.
[2:11:11] You realize it takes beauty in you to
[2:11:13] appreciate beauty externally.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; The reason why you can appreciate the
[2:11:17] beauty of something because it's in you
[2:11:19] to that something some attribute is in
[2:11:21] you. And therefore, we want to see the
[2:11:23] true beauty of God, not try to be made
[2:11:25] up to what the church looks like
[2:11:28] in the world. But I want to have this
[2:11:29] real beauty of God in my heart. Let's
[2:11:32] pray. Our gracious heavenly father,
[2:11:34] Lord, we are a very needy people.
[2:11:39] If we measure ourselves by the perfect
[2:11:41] tabernacle and the stature and the
[2:11:43] measure of a perfect man, we don't feel
[2:11:46] by certain metrics that we could ever
[2:11:48] achieve that. But yet, Lord, you said
[2:11:51] that you gave gifts and that the purpose
[2:11:54] of those gifts were so that we could
[2:11:56] come into the unity of the faith. That
[2:11:57] we could fill up the measure
[2:12:00] of the perfect man
[2:12:03] that our character could be molded to
[2:12:05] your character and that you've invited
[2:12:07] us to that.
[2:12:09] What you're doing, Lord, is you're
[2:12:10] building Bethl.
[2:12:14] And Lord, I pray that we could become
[2:12:16] more conscious and aware of this process
[2:12:18] that we undergo as Christians.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; That our soul having been made of Bethl,
[2:12:23] then we become members of a body of
[2:12:26] Christ that is then with a mission being
[2:12:29] commissioned to build Bethl
[2:12:33] to give our attention to the resources
[2:12:35] that are necessary to consecrate home
[2:12:37] life and to give you preeminence.
[2:12:41] Now Lord, also we have a duty to this
[2:12:43] church to make the inside right by the
[2:12:44] grace of God.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; So Lord, I pray tonight is we've had
[2:12:49] plenty of time to express these things
[2:12:51] that your Holy Spirit could just come
[2:12:52] behind it and now begin to deal with our
[2:12:55] hearts in a more personal way just how
[2:12:57] you could tailor this that's been very
[2:12:59] general, Lord, not very specific, but
[2:13:01] you could begin to tailor it to our
[2:13:03] individual lives and realize I am a
[2:13:05] dwelling place of God. My family should
[2:13:07] be a dwelling place of God. My church is
[2:13:09] a dwelling place of God. and we could
[2:13:10] begin to take this duty to all three
[2:13:12] very much more seriously. Lord, I commit
[2:13:16] the people to you now in the name of the
[2:13:17] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:13:19] Amen.
[2:13:21] In the presence
[2:13:29] of
[2:13:31] Jehovah,
[2:13:32] [singing]
[2:13:37] God Almighty,
[2:13:42] [music]
[2:13:45] oh prince
[2:13:47] [singing] of peace,
[2:13:53] Trles [music and singing]
[2:13:55] vanish.
[2:14:00] Oh, and [music and singing] hearts
[2:14:03] are made
[2:14:07] [music]
[2:14:09] in [singing] the presence.
[2:14:13] [music]
[2:14:16] Oh, of the [music]
[2:14:19] king.
[2:14:21] Just make your heart a home now. Oh,
[2:14:25] [singing] in the presence.
[2:14:31] [singing and music] Oh,
[2:14:33] I love you.
[2:14:42] [music]
[2:14:43] Praise
[2:14:49] [music]
[2:14:51] me. [singing]
[2:14:53] [music]
[2:15:00] [music]
[2:15:07] [music]
[2:15:11] Oh yes, thank you.
[2:15:16] [music]
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Let's raise up [music] our hands and
[2:15:23] sing it one more time with all your
[2:15:26] heart in the presence.
[2:15:31] [music and singing]
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; In your presence, Lord.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; the whole
[2:15:40] world
[2:15:44] [music]
[2:15:46] might [singing]
[2:15:51] praise [music]
[2:15:53] on [singing]
[2:15:59] [music]
[2:16:04] this Help me
[2:16:09] [music]
[2:16:16] the [singing and music] praise.
[2:16:20] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:16:24] The king,
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; the king.
[2:16:28] Just keep playing that for me softly,
[2:16:30] Sister Deb.
[2:16:32] My my
[2:16:36] you know I I was quite smitten by that
[2:16:40] sermon.
[2:16:42] I was
[2:16:44] thinking so deeply [music] and trying to
[2:16:45] take notes that
[2:16:48] meant a lot to me. I believe it meant
[2:16:51] [music] a lot to you.
[2:16:53] You know, isn't it true that whenever we
[2:16:58] find ourselves,
[2:17:00] you know, saying, "Man, I need to kind
[2:17:02] of play some catchup and get caught back
[2:17:05] up into that spiritual plane that uh,
[2:17:08] you know, which is the only place a real
[2:17:11] believer's comfortable."
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Life is just so uncomfortable for a
[2:17:17] believer. when you when you find
[2:17:19] yourself at a lower altitude, anything
[2:17:22] any [music] number of things can do it.
[2:17:24] But and not even not even bad things,
[2:17:27] just stuff, just life. And isn't it
[2:17:29] true, friends, that the first thing you
[2:17:32] think of is is tighter disciplines, more
[2:17:36] works, more things I need to do. I need
[2:17:37] to do this, I need to do that. I'm just
[2:17:39] so glad that it's it's really not
[2:17:41] [music] that it's not that complicated.
[2:17:44] It's just saying, "Lord, I know you can
[2:17:48] lift my altitude. You can get under
[2:17:50] [music] my wings and lift me back up. I
[2:17:52] just need a closer fellowship with the
[2:17:55] Lord." Isn't that beautiful? Just to
[2:17:57] think about that, friends. You don't got
[2:17:59] to you don't got to go say the Bible
[2:18:02] says we're we're going to not need to
[2:18:04] say somebody go across the ocean and go
[2:18:07] bring him to us or somebody go up to
[2:18:09] heaven and bring him down here so we can
[2:18:11] say, "No, no. There's coming a day
[2:18:13] you're not going to do that. Oh my. He's
[2:18:16] right among you. He's right with you.
[2:18:18] He's He'd be not far from us at all. The
[2:18:20] Bible teaches us.
[2:18:22] Wow. I I just was that was just what the
[2:18:26] doctor ordered for me. And I believe it
[2:18:29] is for you. I was looking and thinking
[2:18:32] about
[2:18:35] about Brother Brandham and I just kept
[2:18:37] hearing it over and over in my head.
[2:18:39] [music] Brother Brenham talking about
[2:18:42] what causes heaven and earth to embrace
[2:18:45] and he started talking about that early
[2:18:47] in his ministry 1956 [music]
[2:18:49] he starts talking about it and he he
[2:18:52] comes he's constantly coming to Jesus in
[2:18:54] the water and the dove is coming and
[2:18:57] [music] a voice is speaking and you
[2:19:00] remember brother Aaron was taking us to
[2:19:02] show us look it it's about it's about
[2:19:05] God desiring to have a home in you more
[2:19:09] then you're desiring to have a home with
[2:19:11] him.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; And I guess I've never thought about
[2:19:13] David is actually not trying to go
[2:19:16] somewhere to heaven. He's not that's not
[2:19:18] a a dream way off in the lofty blue
[2:19:21] because the very the very next verse, if
[2:19:23] you read the fifth verse, he says,
[2:19:25] [music] "For in the time of trouble,
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; you're not going to have trouble in
[2:19:28] heaven." So the whole premise, God, I
[2:19:30] need you here. I need you right now.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; I need you to live. I need to be able to
[2:19:35] go into your presence and dwell there.
[2:19:38] Oh my goodness. And brother Brandham 56
[2:19:42] 57 he keeps saying it keep it's it's
[2:19:44] burning his heart. He comes back around
[2:19:47] in the N64 in the future home and he
[2:19:50] starts talking about that's where God
[2:19:53] God and man heaven and earth embraced.
[2:19:56] He kept saying it. Heaven and earth
[2:19:58] embraced. Finally he says heaven and
[2:20:00] earth embraced [music] and kissed.
[2:20:03] Because that is really what God is
[2:20:05] desiring is to [music] have that. He
[2:20:08] desires it more than you desire it.
[2:20:10] Sometimes we can think, "Oh, I just need
[2:20:13] the Lord so bad." Can Can you absorb
[2:20:15] tonight that the Lord desires you even
[2:20:18] more than you desire that more than you
[2:20:20] desire to go to heaven and have a home
[2:20:22] there, he wants your life to be his home
[2:20:24] here on the earth. That's what Jesus was
[2:20:28] for him. I [music] was just my my
[2:20:32] goodness. I think I I think I would like
[2:20:34] to just set y'all back down and preach a
[2:20:36] whole sermon based on what I just heard
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; in the presence
[2:20:42] of Jehovah. Have you enjoyed your time
[2:20:45] in the house of God tonight? I want to
[2:20:48] sing it again. And I just feel in my
[2:20:49] heart that you receive what you heard
[2:20:53] tonight as much as I did. And here's a
[2:20:56] here's an opportunity now. We're getting
[2:20:58] ready to you're going to go right back
[2:20:59] out into that. Listen, it's a cold, dark
[2:21:02] world. Wouldn't even matter if it was in
[2:21:04] the middle of the day. It's a cold, dark
[2:21:06] world. And here's an opportunity,
[2:21:08] friends, to have all three of those, to
[2:21:11] have your triunity lined up, to have the
[2:21:13] Holy Ghost, to have a home, and to have
[2:21:15] a church.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't just want to be with the
[2:21:18] Holy Ghost and have a nice church, but
[2:21:20] my home isn't right.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; I don't just want to have a nice home
[2:21:22] and a nice church, and the Holy Ghost
[2:21:24] ain't right. How many want to have all
[2:21:26] three? To say, "LORD, BE THE PERFECTION.
[2:21:29] LET YOUR LIFE live in every aspect of my
[2:21:33] [music] life in the presence.
[2:21:39] Come on Bethl. Come on Bethl. Lift it
[2:21:41] up. [music]
[2:21:44] Jehovah. [singing]
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; How many want [music] to be a Bethl for
[2:21:49] the Lord?
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; God
[2:21:52] mighty. [music]
[2:21:56] Oh Jesus. Prince
[2:21:59] of peace, [music]
[2:22:03] peace,
[2:22:06] trles,
[2:22:07] [music and singing]
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; the [music] praise.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Wow. [music] How true.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; That is for my heart. If [music] you'd
[2:22:34] like prayer, we're going to sing. Oh
[2:22:48] [music and singing]
[2:22:52] God Almighty.
[2:22:58] Hallelujah. [music]
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the King.
[2:23:07] True.
[2:23:09] [music]
[2:23:18] [music]
[2:23:26] [music]
[2:23:32] [music]
[2:23:33] Sing it with all your heart.
[2:23:37] [singing]
[2:23:39] [music]
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; The praise
[2:23:42] of
[2:23:45] [music]
[2:23:48] the
[2:23:50] world.
[2:23:52] [music]
[2:23:54] God Almighty,
[2:23:59] [music]
[2:24:00] Almighty,
[2:24:02] praise of
[2:24:09] tr [music]
[2:24:20] [music]
[2:24:24] It is
[2:24:26] the praise
[2:24:30] [music]
[2:24:35] with every head bowed now. Master,
[2:24:38] [music]
[2:24:40] what a time in your word tonight.
[2:24:43] How refreshing it was to hear. Lord, it
[2:24:46] just seemed like to me [music]
[2:24:49] like a a fountain flowing from the
[2:24:52] throne of God with no end,
[2:24:55] no
[2:24:57] no worries about
[2:25:00] running it, running it dry. It just
[2:25:02] seemed to be an endless source, an
[2:25:04] endless supply. We were certainly tapped
[2:25:07] in, Lord, [music] to that river of that
[2:25:09] river of life that flows out from under
[2:25:12] your throne. Flows down, Lord. It's the
[2:25:14] image of what the new heavens and the
[2:25:17] new earth will be. But that's but Lord,
[2:25:19] that that's what we're coming to.
[2:25:21] [music] And right now, you desire that
[2:25:24] kind of imagery. That's Bible imagery.
[2:25:26] That's what you desire in our life. As
[2:25:28] the preacher said, it just blends. Lord,
[2:25:32] I've always wondered I I don't think
[2:25:33] I'll ever wonder about it again after
[2:25:36] tonight. Hearing hearing how Brother
[2:25:38] Brandon would describe it [music] that
[2:25:40] I'll speed up, they'll slow down. What
[2:25:43] does that even mean? Lord, I think
[2:25:45] that's what's happening even [music]
[2:25:46] right now. Lord, I know it'll bring the
[2:25:48] saints out of the grave and I know it'll
[2:25:50] change our body. We're not diminishing
[2:25:52] that. But Lord, it it's not just a
[2:25:54] lightning strike event. It's happening
[2:25:57] right now. I pray, oh God, that my life
[2:26:01] will begin to speed up because I want to
[2:26:03] be with you and you want to be with me
[2:26:06] and we want to be together. And Lord,
[2:26:08] this is coming [music] from both ends.
[2:26:09] This is coming from above, down, and
[2:26:11] from down upward. Oh God, help us
[2:26:14] tonight to see it that way, to realize
[2:26:17] it, Lord, that we don't have to cross
[2:26:19] the ocean or or to bring you here. We
[2:26:21] don't have to bring you down from
[2:26:23] heaven. You're right here in our midst
[2:26:25] tonight. Lord, I pray you give us great
[2:26:27] refreshing, Lord. This is this is
[2:26:29] [music] a great time to be in your
[2:26:31] presence. I'm thanking you, Lord, for
[2:26:33] answering prayer. May your blessing
[2:26:36] continue with us this weekend. Lord,
[2:26:39] tonight would just be a begin to break
[2:26:41] into that atmospheres in that realm,
[2:26:43] Lord, where we can just feast upon your
[2:26:45] word and it can fix us. It can do all
[2:26:48] all the healing that's needed, all the
[2:26:51] correction that's needed, all the
[2:26:52] alignment that's needed. Lord God, let
[2:26:55] it just be a whole banner weekend for
[2:26:56] Bethl Tabernacle. I pray we commit it to
[2:27:00] you. [music] I commit these people,
[2:27:02] Lord, who who heard the word tonight. I
[2:27:04] commit it. Commit them into your hands
[2:27:07] now. Go with us to our homes. Be with us
[2:27:09] throughout the evening. We'll no doubt
[2:27:11] long remember some of the words we heard
[2:27:13] tonight. I want to wake up tomorrow and
[2:27:16] continue to think on them. Lord, I
[2:27:18] commit it to you now [music] in Jesus
[2:27:20] name. Amen. Amen. Turn around and greet
[2:27:24] somebody standing near you. Shake their
[2:27:26] hand and say, "God bless you. Thank you
[2:27:28] for coming out to the house of God
[2:27:30] tonight for
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; We'll see you tomorrow.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Got a wonderful day of activity planned.
[2:27:37] [music] God bless you.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Who can calm the storms [singing]
[2:27:43] of life
[2:27:45] like my Lord?
[2:27:50] [music]
[2:27:51] His
[2:27:53] rest
[2:27:55] to the weery
[2:27:58] brings [music]
[2:27:59] new life
[2:28:01] to [singing]
[2:28:03] the hopeless.
[2:28:05] There's no doubt
[2:28:08] [music]
[2:28:10] about it. He's my Lord.
[2:28:15] [music]
[2:28:18] He's my Lord.
[2:28:24] There is no [music] other
[2:28:28] one
[2:28:31] who
[2:28:33] can calm the storms of
[2:28:36] [music and singing] life
[2:28:38] like my Lord.
[2:28:42] Oh,
[2:28:45] he gives rest
[2:28:48] to the weery. He brings [music]
[2:28:52] new life
[2:28:54] to the hopeless.

[2:29:03] about it. He's my Lord.
[2:29:08] [singing]
[2:29:09] [music] Oh,
[2:29:11] he's my Lord. [singing]
[2:29:17] There is no other
[2:29:21] one
[2:29:24] who
[2:29:25] can calm [singing] the [music] storms of
[2:29:29] life like my Lord.
[2:29:36] Oh, he gives rest [music]
[2:29:40] to the weery.
