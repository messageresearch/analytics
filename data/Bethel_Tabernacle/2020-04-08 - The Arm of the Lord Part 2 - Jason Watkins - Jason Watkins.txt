I can carry on right here this mic actually one of the best mics we have in the whole house is right here amen so even when you listen to it on the on the audio on the internet stream you find that it's extremely clear and picks up really well amen we're going to invite you to the book of Genesis this evening chapter 18 and we'll catch a reading there let you be seated and then we're going to go and pick up over in Isaiah 53 but let's get Genesis 18 while we have you standing a man now while you're finding that let me just make a couple of quick announcements and let me add this prayer request here that I just got alright so if there's any prayer request just remember to send them directly to me via via via whatsapp because that's the clearing house where I check and to make sure that I'm not missing any alright and then I want to also make a quick announcement that so the you brothers got the announcement today but so this is mainly the announcement for that I guess for the church on the streaming but the the Saints in New Zealand where I was supposed to be ministering this weekend in fact as I was supposed to be in New Zealand right now and the meetings were going to start tomorrow for us which is already tomorrow for them so I would just be a number of hours away from starting those meetings well things being things those meetings had to be set aside we couldn't hold them I couldn't travel there and they actually couldn't gather so they're there under the same thing that we're under so they they petitioned brother brother al ray if he would ask me would I be willing to go in and preach the convention virtually via come right here and stream it and they're all going to be over there streaming it streaming the whole service through the whole Easter weekend so I've got my work cut out for me I agreed to it a man in a moment of weakness no I agreed to it because it you know sister Debbie reminded me today she said well you know that that makes sense because you really felt led to accept the invitation when it was given and I did I prayed a long time about that invitation I had several invitations and I had to turn down a couple and and there were other ones even overseas and domestically that I turned down because I felt led to take that one and so it's going to give me a chance to fulfill I had no idea be doing it that way a man through the third technology so what we're gonna do is for them it'll all be morning services in their time otherwise I'd have to come here at 3 in the morning and preach I mean I'd do that I don't know if I get my booth crew here to back me up at 3 in the morning but a man we're gonna be preaching here in the evenings Friday Saturday and Sunday night which will be for them Saturday morning Sunday morning and Monday morning because they always run their Easter meetings into Monday curious thing I find that all the time and I go overseas so I've got tonight I get one one little breather tomorrow night and then I'm gonna preach Friday night Saturday night and then here for our regular service on Sunday morning which would be Easter Sunday and then back again Sunday night so how many be praying for me amen I feel like I need to put myself at the top of the prayer list tonight so what yeah six o'clock in the evening Friday and Saturday and Sunday night so I sent out two brothers who would like to come and I think that they're gonna handle all of the their own preliminaries so I just need any brothers that want to come we only needed a couple of maybe one or two broadcast personnel we didn't even necessarily have musicians so I just sent it out to brothers to say hey after after one or two booth engineers I've got you know good eight slots open seven or eight slots open and so different brothers have said they liked fill those I still have a few slots that are available and maybe you want to come some of the services not to all of them and you certainly would be welcome to do that and make sure there's not the same okay I have to already have that okay so we're let's get right to our reading so anyway I just wanted to make that let that be known on the internet to the church we'll be streaming back here again Friday night at 6:00 6:00 then Saturday night at 6:00 and then of course our regular Sunday morning Easter service will be here and then I'll be right back here again Sunday evening at 6:00 amen so we'll be streaming that from here live and that'll be they're gonna they've got a way they're gonna do it where there's kind of an interaction I don't know how it's going to work yet somehow they'll be able to see me I'll be able to see them I don't know how that's going to work if I get delayed amens that's going to throw me out so I'm not sure I told him I said we'll have to figure that out so I think we've got a summa tonight but as Jason to figure that out I think they're set for that all right let's get right to Genesis 18 sorry to keep you standing for so long all right let me let's start at verse 1 and the Lord appeared unto Him this is Abraham in the plains of Mamre the Lord appeared unto Him and the plains of Mamre as he and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on after that after that you shall pass on and for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said verse 6 and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and sent it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and he said Behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety bear a child which amoled is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh let's pray master we thank you for your word here this evening and now Lord I'm praying for your anointing to be upon the the preacher and the hearer tonight Lord we're just before you humbly Lord I I believe I have exactly what you want to say to the people tonight let it encourage them Lord let it be a pouring of strength into our hearts in this kind of an hour Lord we need it so I pray that you'll grant it to us in Jesus name Amen god bless you friends as you're seated and as you're seated you can find your place in Isaiah 53 Wood has catch two verses there Amen I want to carry on tonight from last Wednesday when I or the last time when I was ministering I'm not I don't think that was last Wednesday but I think it was a previous Sunday I was preaching on the arm of the Lord and tonight I'd like to take part too let's look now in Isaiah chapter 53 to go back to our reading that we had there on that previous Sunday and I'll just catch a couple of quick verses here verse 1 and we'll catch verse 11 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed verse 11 he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities amen the arm of the Lord we were showing you endeavoring to show you last time how that you know when we talk about you know the arm of the Lord that you find that the scripture is showing us an imagery of God working in the earth not God the invisible spirit that dwells in eternity but when it speaks of who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed we find that this chapter 53 being a perfect perhaps I think I I said to you on that last time on part 1 that this chapter of Isaiah 53 referring to Christ that the you know it's referred to so often throughout the rest of the of the Gospels that it's the whole premise upon which Jesus would come and arrive and he was oppressed and afflicted and he opened not his mouth all we like sheep have gone astray he's wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities chastisement of our peace upon him so we're we're realizing right quick and this is a really an important point that you can lose sight of is that when you hear this example the arm of the Lord then then this is actually God manifesting something even even you find them that that when we we say what's attached and we dealt with this a little bit what's attached to an arm a hand and you find that that God moves by his mighty hand and whenever you see God moving like this and these kind of descriptive terms more often than not perhaps in an overwhelming way this is God that great eternal spirit who's going to materialize himself he's going to manifest himself he's going to become this is God extending his being in a in a reality way down into the earth alright now we found that when we were preaching part 1 we showed you how that brother branham showed that the keys to the kingdom were given to the church that Jesus he says there we read that for you last time in the Serpent's e.message how that he did not have when he rose on the third day did not have the keys to the kingdom of heaven and brother Branham says because he had given those to Peter Jesus had keys of death and hell and we found out that that you know that whatever they would bind on earth that it would be bound in heaven and so this great this great operational power that exists in heaven your that God's family was going to have a key in order to access that power and they were going to need it you're you're going to need it in your daily life because life here this this the horth is cursed Satan is the god of the age the lid is torn off of Hell and demon power streaming into the earth if there was ever a time when the body of Christ needed to unlock heavenly power in the earth it's now it was going to be necessary it was going to be necessary since since since you know that that that his he that his his elect who came through his grace and it was going to be to them a revealed faith and so then it was going to be necessary to give them the keys to this kind of power and if God has given me keys to the power of his heavenly kingdom I just plan to use it I mean I don't know what you're doing with your keys but I don't decide I never like just carrying keys around for no purpose I like to use a key if I'm gonna carry it I want to have a reason to carry all right you know I I'm like that I have a utility type of mentality I don't you know I that's why I'm not a hoarder I don't keep things that I don't use I don't buy things they don't can't make sense of it so you know God has all kinds of blessings and I I determine when I look at the world and I look at the promise and the challenges upon my life then I just say my goodness I'm going to need to access these blessings I'm not the kind to go off in pride and arrogancy thinking I can do it on my own I already know I can't do nothing and so I don't mind admitting to you tonight I don't mind raising my hands and looking to heaven and saying I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I need him every morning every night everywhere I go I need him who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many you know when you would think of and you know as well as me it would make sense to you tonight if I were to say that if God was going to display his then you know you you you might say that when God was gonna roll up his sleeve and display his arm that it would it would probably be the most powerful looking arm you could ever imagine you know I don't think any weightlifter could ever equal in his arm what my expectation would be if somebody says God's about to roll up his sleeve and stick his arm into the earth you would think that the arm of God would be a super arm and it is but in appearance it was quite unimpressive now this important point the Bible says concerning Jesus that there was no beauty no beauty that we should desire him you know you you would think that God's arm would be super that it would be impressive but when it but when it became on a human being and lived in the earth it looked like probably one of the most unimpressive arms you would ever see brother branham said now this is amazing brother branham said he was a little man now that's that's doubly an amazing statement when you're a little man saying that about another man and brother branham was a small man in stature very small I think man I think it was mating 5/7 and and weighed about 150 pounds and he looks at the Lord Jesus and says he was a very small men stooped shoulders very narrow said you'd almost say you almost couldn't look at him in and just weep when you looked into his eyes and yet at the same time you are aware that if he would just speak the world might end I don't think we can get our mind around it friends now say what's the real point because because I was showing to you the first in the first part and I'm going to reiterate it tonight that the end of an arm is a and and and when God delivered Israel he delivered them by the hand of God and that hand was a man and it was Moses so you see now that you might say I'm nothing well that's exactly or just the kind of guy Jesus is looking for so I'm weak well that's perfect because then he can be strong but I'm undeserving perfect that means he gets all the credit I can't do anything awesome that means he can do everything so when you would you might think that to be a Christian you'd have to be some supersonic person now you'd have to be some battle-hardened Bulldog warrior of faith actually the weaker you are the better it is for him because if you're strong you tend to get in his way and the best thing to do is just admit you can't do anything except through him you can do everything so we see then that this arm you know it was uh it was a common arm it was a small arm it was a weak arm in appearance but yet to stage sinners it had to be the greatest arm that was ever put in the earth because God is going to use that arm which is going to stand in the body of a lonely Nazarene and God's going to use that little frame of a man as God's arm and it's going to save the entire family so we're going to find out that big powerful things come in little small packages that don't look like a whole lot we read to you from recoated you from Psalms chapter 8 and verse 3 that when God made the universe the Bible says he used his fingers but when it came time to save all of God's family God used his arm and as we were showing you a type the type of the Ministry of the Son of Man that you're going to find the arm of the Lord you know appears in a in a person distinct from himself because it calls him his servant say the arm of the Lord so it's God himself but look at the distinction God makes in the scripture God who says the it's the arm of the Lord that's going to come and save and we know that to be Jesus and yet the Bible calls him the servant of the God who has the arm this is the beauty now it's it's so you should thank God for revelation in this hour because if it weren't for that you can easily believe Jesus must surely be the second person in a Trinity of Godhead but the beauty of it is that God's not showing a second person in the Godhead God is showing that he's going to tabernacle in humanity hallelujah and that that when that humanity stands on the earth he's going to be a prototype of an entire family so who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord extended who's it made known to who's the hand on the end of the arm of God now it's not the Galilean walking the shores of Galilee it's you it's me it's his bride his family and the earth and yes we don't look like much that's because we look like him hallelujah sometimes we feel so weak well that's because he was a small weak man jacent and friends he could stand at the grave as brother brandon would say stand there and weep over Lazarus so that was just a man said that when he pulled back and brother branham was descriptive said when he pulled back his little shoulders and said Lazarus come forth thankfully he called a name or all graves would open that's kind of power that I want to be tapped into today hallelujah so we find then that that the arm of the Lord you know appears distinct from the Lord because that's see that's that's a type of the son of man ministry because that's the role you're going to play son of man ministry remember the office of son of man is a prophet that's one to a generation we don't got another one we don't need another one the one that came did his job finished it went his reward but the Ministry of the son of man is a broader term it means the Word made flesh I'm here to tell you something friend the same ministry that was in the son of man is now working in the body of a son of man ministry so it's the family of God then now here comes you know really the hindrance to it all because the family of God though elected and though we preach that to you and you can read it in your Bible you can hear the prophets saying it over and over and over again and though we are the family of God and though we are elected you know I stand up here and I'm showing you how that the arm of the Lord is attached to the hand so it's so you understand the arm is what bridge is the body to the hand you remember Jesus said that that I am the vine my father is the husbandman he's the one who planted me now the vine doesn't grow the fruit the branches grow the fruit but there had to be a vine between the fruit bearing branches and the husbandmen and that was the vine and that was Christ that was the arm you understand the arm the arm that the world was saved the salvation was in the arm of the Lord but when God puts his hand in the earth that's his family that's what that was Moses they were saved by the hand of God the Bible says and yet God said I've come down to do it you can pick it up in the scripture brother Branham deals with that in the fourth seal that he says now Moses I've heard the cry I remember my promise I've come down and I'm sending you saying said God always uses man so there so you have you have now watch this friends it's beautiful now I'll ask you a question you see that you see my body you see my arm you see my hand is that three different people it's all the same me I'm a body I got an arm and I got a hand take something God reached his arm down in Christ and Christ life extended in you and you're the hand or you're the branch call it whatever you want you're working the works of God you're bearing the fruits of Almighty God you're attached through Christ to God hallelujah see that's the plan of God we don't have a problem with that that's why we can see that the true teaching of the Godhead so easily see because we're not we're not trying to look often this is where Trinitarians get so messed up and we're we're tunis get messed up they're looking wealth in the heavens trying to figure out all of that language of these different beings we're not even looking up there we're realizing that's here in me and walking around I can see the trueness of the Godhead because I'm an extension of that I'm the kenai said put that in Bible language okay the Bible says that Christ was the beginning of the creation of God if you had a beginning you're going to have a continuation and by the Renison you are the continuation of that same God that same Christ that same example amen the continuation of that same creation so the family of God an extension of God this is why this explains why you can see the revelation of this hour and others can't it is has nothing to do with how handsome you are or how good you smell it has nothing to do with how intelligent you are it has nothing to do with how you were born it has nothing to do with how successful or unsuccessful how how how righteous you might have lived or how evil you might have lived it has nothing to do with that it just is simply that God has a genealogy God has an issue and out of God King Christ and out of Christ King me hallelujah this is why when people walk against election I just say look there's only there's only one elected son according to the Bible and that's Christ I'm just part of him so I'm sorry you don't like election but he's the elected son I just happened to be part of him say I came from him and so we realized that it's nothing that we earned it wasn't because we were good enough it had no merit of our own and and for this reason now the devil knowing that that's the human weakness of the human mind is that I can stand up here and I can prove you and you catch it I can tell the audience on the internet I'm sure people are seeing that Wow the body to the arm to the hand God into Christ into the church the husbandman who planted the vine who grows the branches who deliver the fruit these are beautiful portraits out of the Word of God you hear it you love it you believe it but oftentimes I stand up here and say you're the hand of God in the earth and although you know you hear your family of God and although you hear that you're elected we oftentimes do not feel worthy to be the hand of God let's be honest brothers so oftentimes and see this is this is the devil knowing this this is how he hinders you because he's got he's got he's got you cold dead to rights he's got evidence I mean he's got video replay of your of everything you've did and thought it intended and evidence that he wants to leverage against you but here's here's the beauty of the scripture Christ in his courtroom has already dismissed all that evidence see when Satan tried to bring that up to God God dismissed that case and and rebuked Satan him ever I've preached the giotto Zechariah 3 God dismissed the evidence because that he this was his family that he had elected this was his own issue and how dare Lucifer bring an accusation against God to accuse his issue as to accuse him just on election alone God dismissed all the evidence as invalid and God rebuked the devil for even saying it and that's why Paul could say there is now therefore no condemnation but the case has already been decided when Christ represented his blood on the altar in atone for all of God's family that would ever be born thousands of years down to today now the court case is decided in God's Court what about yours what about your courtroom brother has the decision been made in your courtroom see this is the devil's already lost he's already lost in the Supreme Court so he comes down here to your mind that's the battleground and we don't feel worthy it just seems too good to be true that God on the basis of his word alone and on nothing else has already declared you are redeemed done finished brother branham said in the mind of God which is the only real reality this thing's finished up a long time ago brother you I find that one of the best ways to start you wait to that cross open state Oh the solid rock and his word alone I take my stand and I faced the enemy and the enemy says you're not worthy and I say that's true but you ain't facing me if you're facing me then you already have one devil but you're facing Christ in me if this is based on me we're all sunk but it's based on him he had to have a hand God wasn't just gonna have an arm without a hand I'm here to tell you something friends you are that hand so become useful another wonder Jesus could save his business see we don't always feel worthy brother Brandon would say in recognizing your day in its message now I'm going to say something he says national force I read this for you some services ago we had it on the overhead national force put Israel in her homeland we can see that that's history you can see how that World War one the first woe Rove the Jews out of the out from under the Ottoman Empire under their control in the Ottoman Empire receded but of course they were still assembled in Central Europe so it took the second woe tender hand of Jehovah national force drove them home did it work yeah drove them home by the millions they raised a six point Star of David and ninth in 1948 raised a six point Star of David recognized as a nation for the first time in thousands of years what did that national force see say I thought God did it God did it but God used national force you follow that circumstances on the ground made them go home national force will put the church not the bride but after the rapture when the bride is gone and the church is left be kind national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches and they won't have a choice brother branham makes that so clearly said they'll be able be caught in a boycott and he said that will force and he would use that word constantly it'll force why is that true because that's what babylon broad was the first one to to to launch out with a forced takeover a hostile takeover of other people's and a forced worship and a forced unity he wanted to go out and gather all the living and bring them under one auspices one headship one worship one government one state and that spirit that was anointing Nimrod was none other than the Antichrist and that was ancient Babylon which Peter would call Rome Babylon because it's the same spirit doctor his lot proved that conclusively in his book on the two babylons and and found he I love the point he says it was so amazing when the Jesuits first penetrated the interior of China never been penetrated by white men and when Catholic Jesuits first penetrated the interior of China for the very first time they found a Madonna I found a woman a mother and a child sitting there and glowing and an eminence around the child and the mother and they're like who who taught you all about Jesus who taught you all about Mary the Virgin no one had taught him this is the interior of China they had never heard about it but you can see that that ancient spirit of Babylon permeated all kinds of ancient cultures see and so so we realized then that so he says national force put Israel their homeland national force the power of church and state how I'm not here tonight to preach on how that's gonna come I don't know I don't care I'm gonna be gone hallelujah watch children can deal with that Abraham's children never had to worry about it and so we find that that he says now national force will put Israel homeland national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride so you know something friends it's it's not God using circumstances of my of the world powers like he did in in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and he he he got dictators and czars and chancellors to rise up and begin to persecute the Jews and brush them home it's not about like how he gets ahold of the church in the state and forces churches against their will to become son of God then why would you believe any kind of power could push you out of it it has nothing there is no national power there is no natural power that can put you in and there's no natural power not even yours not no actions by the government no actions by you you can't keep yourself out of the bride and nothing can put you in it but the power of the Word of God alone when it is believed puts you in the kingdom of God and then that life inside you begins driving you he says world Force's this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward when I read that itis I won't to have a Jubilee because I wasn't sure how I was gonna get up there I feel so trapped down here I feel so weak and so letting I feel like I gotta let feet I'll never get off this hurt I don't know I don't need to worry don't worry tonight friends sometimes I know you don't feel worthy I know you don't feel much like the hand of God but don't fear the power of God is going to force you say what's goin on in my life why can't I go to the same places I used to go because there's a force moving you see the Spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit in life did Jesus say that we'll put the bride the my word his spirit and life will put the bride in her place say why how in what way cuz she'll recognize her position in the word not my my my I'm not going around now here's what Satan does Satan wants me to recognize my position in weakness Saint wants me to always recognize that I got this flaw or that I got this trouble he wants me to recognize that he's always tripping me right here he wants me to recognize that he's always stumbling me right here but I'm not here to recognize a weakness or flaw or trouble or failure or a past I'm to recognize myself in the word and when I do that none of those weaknesses Falls or troubles can keep me out of it he says she'll recognize herself in the word position in the word then she's in Christ and that'll put her in her place no national force will do it the national force did Drive Israel the national force forces the world council council churches will drive every organization but the power of God will raise the bride into glory I'm gonna sit back tonight and just revel in that promise I'm just gonna close my eyes to the world and shut my ears to the siren song of doubt and fear and the enemy and just say let me tune my hearing to the word let me turn my eyes upon Jesus let me believe what a prophet has said and I'm here to tell you there'll be a force but I dine amic begin to lift you up into a higher realm we don't feel like it but we don't feel worthy but this is why Paul dealt with Hebrews 10 brother George give me Hebrews chapter 10 verses 21 to 23 he bruised ten having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he knows that you'll be faithful can I read that again for he is faithful that promised he is the one faithful and I could even if I even if I'm not faithful he can't deny his own self he's already promised himself me and so there's no way he's gonna break his promise to himself hallelujah he abides faithful this was really this was really ground zero for for Abraham Sarah because what God was suggesting to them was had been and remained impossible they couldn't bring forth children when they were young and they had been he had matter I think she was only 15 and here they here they come along and now they went all these years through their life nobody to have children and now they're already passed bearing children and since Sarah Sarah wasn't being some rebellious child of God Sam wasn't Sarah's nature this is a woman who called her husband Lord this is a woman who followed him and he was a wanderer in the desert this was not a rebellious lady this was not a women's lib this was not some dominating female Sarah was a very humble woman calling him Lord following his every decree and and she wasn't being rebellious but she thought it ridiculous me I I couldn't do that when I was young and now I'm old now it's actually in a reality physically impossible at least when I was young it was possible now it's actually already too late see and he said to her but notice what he said Genesis 18 give me that 18 10 brother George look at the language any sin Genesis 18 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him this was not ambiguous language friends now you're you're sitting here tonight and you hear me preach about the election of God in the power of God in the hand of God in the arm of God you hear me talk about the promise of God in the court in heaven you are rejoicing with me on that but but but yet at the same time come on all you humans at the same time we love to hear it and we want to believe it and we lift up our hands because it emit moves us and it's it I want that to be true but at the same time at the same time it's it's it's me saying to you that weakness you will never stumble at it ever again in fact as you go the rest of your life from this day forward and you'll never commit another sin that's how impossible what God was saying to Sarah in Sarah's mind and he was saying I will certainly return and he rebukes her and she denies it all no you did you did you laughed you said how can I being old have this with my husband and he's old and then and then later on down because God's not going to let unbelief have the last word if you keep on reading down he repeats it again I will come at this time next year according to the time of light and you will embrace it you will embrace the Sun you are going to have this child I'm here I'm only here now watch it what was this tent meeting about this this little tent that that he was coming to meet Abraham in was to confirm a promise that he made to him all the way back in Chapter 12 and makes it again and makes it again and makes it again and Abraham doubts it and Abraham back slides and Abraham lies and God keeps confirming an Abraham says Lord he finally gets so you told me I'm gonna be the father of many nations I didn't got a child and this daily easer who's my servants gonna inherit everything and I thought you told me and the Lord comes back again it will not be that way out of your own loins you're going to have a son I don't care what it looks like I'm it's not you doing it Abraham I'm gonna do it and when he comes now in the evening times at this evening and this evening time and he's going to have an evening meal and an evening hour he's gonna he's going to sit down and eat with Abraham and after the meal then this angelic visitor who who announces that a son is going to be born to Sarah in exactly a year and of course we we know I mean chapter 16 you can go various different places 16 and 7 we won't bother going to it's certainly the Lord Himself brother branham makes that clear there commentators make that clear there's no doubt this is Almighty God that's speaking and stand and though the thought seemed ludicrous to Sarah and she laughs at it the Lord in His graciousness could have killed her but she was a part of Abraham and God in his gracious I know sometimes it it sounds like a rebuke and he's he's rebuking her and he's correcting her but understand friends put yourself there when God rebukes you isn't it in love don't you as men of God as sons of the Living God and sister Deborah here with us I think we can all hear witness tonight that even when he rebukes me I feel his love he's coming what is it he's not rebuking me to destroy me he's rebuking me to challenge me and he says to Sarah is anything too hard for the Lord you're here tonight brother you I'm here to tell you you're the hand of the arm that came from God and you say but I it can't be if you only knew my life if you only knew my problems the only my weakness I'm gonna say to you I'm gonna give you the same challenge is anything too hard for the Lord see is anything too hard for the Lord in the Hebrew one of the you marvelous that he could that he could promise me of all guilt and you say oh brother my life clear me of all guilt it's just too marvelous you have no idea I'm here to tell you something friends he can clear you of anything no matter how disastrous even if your whole life was a disaster he can clear you of all guilt and place you and his inheritance and the kingdoms to come is anything too marvelous is anything too hard for the Lord so this account that we read here in Genesis 18 if it's anything at all it's a call for the believer to believe that God can do the impossible because that's what Paul said were to read it in that frame of mind that it's for our examples that we're to read those Old Testament stories and we're to learn and have that for our examples and if there's anything that this example is showing at the evening time during an evening meal when the son of man ministry is displaying itself and God is compared to confirm a promise that you want you have believed this message and this word that you have believed and let the world say what they want I know it took me out of the clutches of the devil and I know it keeps me every hour and I know it's gonna place me in a millenium say does it have that kind of how can it put me up there well how did it get me here I couldn't get me here you didn't get me here all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't get me here there was only one who could get me here and if he got me here he can take me there hallelujah so this confirmation visit it was he confirming his promise by this personal visit I want you to catch that I'm closing in seven or eight minutes I want to try to be done by 8:30 he's this you you got to see the scene of what Genesis 18 you you formation hallelujah and he's going to have a meal with them and the eating of the meal confirmed it and what's the what's that what's the climax what's the apex of Revelation 10 that you must go say oh mighty angel descended well that's part of it that's the beginning without that nothing happens well there's a seventh angel yeah that's right he had to be there because he had to receive that mighty angel but that's still not the climax that's nanny says now that seventh angel who's gonna go off the scene but before he does he's got to take the open book and John's got to go ask for it and the angels gonna say now have a meal have a meal in the evening time have a meal on the body word on the son of man son of man revelation 10 was a confirmation you're gonna make it you are the word God's at work we are going home surely say yeah I don't think I can make it and God is saying you surely I will do this I will come back in the time of life and I will change your body and that's exactly what he did Abraham and Sarah it's changed the physical bodies is the eye you under my control when the bride recognizes who she is when the bride can get it and get past the courtroom of her own mind and start agreeing with the data with God and when the devil brings his evidence to your courtroom say this case has already been decided case closed yeah I see that evidence devil it don't count God saw it before I God saw that evidence before you had it you and he want to be the hand of God but attached to the arm of God which is a the person of God a man this divine declaration to Adam and to Adam's bride it's a declaration it's a humanly impossible birth that's just where you are your new birth was humanly impossible now your birth in the world was because of a human interaction but your new birth was a human impossibility this is wide Nicodemus struggled when Jesus said you have to be born again what I'm home am I gonna reenter what are you talking about and Jesus is like wow you're you're a master in Israel you don't even understand these spiritual things you don't even understand why you're even a sinner you don't even understand why God would need to send a messiah oh I'm here to tell you people don't understand why God needed a message boy I do they understand why he need to send a prophet boy I do hallelujah I'm here to taste something friends I wouldn't have wanted to face the world that and face the devil that the world has to face on just the theological opinions of some preacher hallelujah thank God that Christ the mighty out - a prophet on the earth and that prophet handed us an open book not a closed book an open book and said now have this meal have this meal step into the vision of Genesis 18 find yourself there by eating this meal eat your meal with Almighty God they want to go and do that today say Lord let me eat my word meal in the presence of Almighty God you see say well he ate he ate that's right brother and said he ate a CAF sandwich and drank glass of buttermilk well that makes perfect sense because brother branham said the Holy Ghost in you feeds you I love it so much Oh have you read over here did you understand what this meant oh yes Lord I seen the Prophet speak of it right here I see myself in it and I know it's not a it's not some Kingdom it's not some power there's no human power while we're talking I can't get there but I couldn't get here either and yet here I am I'm a believer how about you a crate
