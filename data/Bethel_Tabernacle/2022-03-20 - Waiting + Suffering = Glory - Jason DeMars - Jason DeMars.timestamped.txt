[26:07] when you're born into a family you don't
[26:09] have a choice
[26:10] you know
[26:11] my mom and dad
[26:13] i didn't say i didn't want to come i
[26:14] didn't
[26:16] it's the same with god each one of his
[26:18] children
[26:19] he's the progenitor
[26:22] you know and it's funny how people look
[26:23] at it like you're making yourself
[26:25] something when all we do is just we're
[26:26] just so thankful for the grace of god
[26:28] and revelation
[26:30] we're not trying to put ourselves up
[26:31] anywhere or anything

[26:35] he's the one that did the selecting amen
[26:38] and i appreciate that very much
[26:41] i probably wouldn't have chose
[26:43] me

[27:20] anointing mightily bless the people they
[27:22] speak to father
[27:24] lord we don't believe we just kind of
[27:26] walk haphazardly we believe each and
[27:29] every step we take is ordained of god
[27:32] and if i may say so especially
[27:34] when a minister
[27:36] goes somewhere
[27:38] and especially the minister that we will

[28:56] wonderful thing and when there's a death
[28:58] and there's a funeral there's so many
[29:00] things and god he experiences all of
[29:04] these gamut of emotions all the time

[29:09] wasn't easy
[29:10] god they're praying god help them we're
[29:12] all going through different things at
[29:14] different times it just blows my mind

[38:07] for them and if you have a need

[38:19] lord we're just lifting our hands lord
[38:21] i'm lifting my hand
[38:23] to you lord and we have many needs
[38:26] represented behind each of these hands
[38:28] lord
[38:29] we ask that you'd move
[38:30] in a supernatural way
[38:33] in every one of these needs lord we ask
[38:35] that you'd move
[38:37] lord in the meetings in in lula and in
[38:39] the meetings in
[38:41] in
[38:41] that literal life lord may your holy
[38:43] spirit
[38:44] just flow
[38:46] through your gifts
[38:48] that your name would be lifted up and
[38:50] glorified in all things lord
[38:52] and and for here lord we ask that your
[38:55] your spirit
[38:57] just would continue to flow through each
[38:59] of us lord
[39:00] i know i know within myself
[39:03] i have nothing
[39:05] good i can offer
[39:06] i have nothing good i can give to these
[39:09] people that are going to bring eternal
[39:10] life that that's going to bring
[39:12] rapturing faith lord it's not in me it's
[39:14] not in any of us but it's in you by your
[39:17] spirit
[39:18] and the working of your spirit
[39:21] in your body
[39:22] lord we just want to be under your
[39:24] headship we want to be under your
[39:26] leadership
[39:27] lord we want to be following you we want
[39:29] to be found faithful
[39:30] so we ask that you would strengthen us
[39:32] to that end lord help each one of us
[39:34] to step out of the way to lay the cares
[39:36] of this life aside and focus on you
[39:40] and your word just for a few minutes
[39:42] here
[39:43] this morning lord for your glory we ask
[39:45] these things in jesus name
[39:47] amen
[39:49] amen i
[39:50] want to speak on
[39:53] subject waiting
[39:55] plus suffering
[39:57] equals glory so i know everybody signs
[40:00] up it says
[40:01] first message i want to hear is the
[40:03] preacher preaching on suffering
[40:06] and you know the youtube channels
[40:08] everybody's watched oh they see a sermon
[40:10] on suffering they sure want to watch
[40:11] that
[40:13] it might not be necessarily what catches
[40:15] our
[40:16] eye or catches our mind or even
[40:19] something the things that we're going
[40:20] through
[40:21] we don't want to go through them but
[40:24] they're necessary
[40:26] because the end is glory
[40:28] which when you see that word
[40:30] i think you need to recognize it's it's
[40:33] very it can be a very ethereal we're
[40:36] we're predestinated to glory we're
[40:38] ordained
[40:39] to glory what does that mean if you
[40:42] think of it in real practical terms it's
[40:44] a new body
[40:46] the rapture right
[40:49] and what comes thereafter all that comes
[40:51] thereafter a new body ruling and
[40:53] reigning with christ eternal life
[40:55] immortality all these things
[40:58] and a position of authority
[41:02] in god's kingdom
[41:03] so
[41:05] when you see glory don't just don't just
[41:07] think of some ethereal thing but this is
[41:09] vitally important it's our it's future
[41:13] future grace and so waiting plus
[41:15] suffering it could be suffering plus
[41:16] waiting too
[41:18] it could go either direction but
[41:21] it's not necessary to be in that order
[41:23] but waiting and suffering come together
[41:26] and the results is glory
[41:29] and so
[41:30] let's go to the scripture while you're
[41:32] standing
[41:34] read
[41:35] psalm 69 verse 3
[41:38] i am weary of my crying
[41:41] my throat is dried mine eyes fail
[41:45] while i wait for my god. may the lord
[41:48] have the blessing to the reading of his
[41:49] word he can be seated
[41:58] last night
[42:00] i was
[42:01] in my office back there most of the
[42:03] afternoon and it seemed like
[42:05] every time i wanted to
[42:07] get on my knees and pray and and start
[42:09] studying another thing came up and then
[42:11] another emergency came up and then
[42:13] another thing came up and it was just uh
[42:16] it was tough to get to that place and
[42:18] then i did get to pray and i just prayed
[42:21] and it was just waiting
[42:24] it was waiting and no answer
[42:26] no answer and i finally was like well
[42:29] it's time to go home for a little bit
[42:31] and eat dinner and
[42:33] and uh
[42:34] got in the truck and said lord i don't
[42:36] know what i'm gonna be speaking on
[42:38] tomorrow i need your help and he said
[42:40] you're not gonna be speaking tomorrow
[42:44] oh
[42:46] i begin to think well then who is
[42:48] and he said i'm going to speak tomorrow
[42:51] would you let me speak tomorrow
[42:53] and i said okay he then he said trust
[42:56] me. okay usually that means it's
[42:59] something
[43:01] extraordinary and out of the ordinary
[43:03] usually i come to the pulpit with a
[43:05] clear
[43:06] vision and i know exactly where we're
[43:07] going to go and where i want to take you
[43:10] and i don't
[43:13] right now
[43:14] the lord i laid in bed till very late
[43:17] last night
[43:18] uh past one o'clock
[43:21] and uh also got up very early thank you
[43:23] brother brad
[43:24] and
[43:25] in the in the night the lord just gave
[43:27] me two scriptures which we'll get to
[43:30] in a little bit he didn't even give me
[43:31] what the content was he just gave me the
[43:33] two scriptures philippians 1 27 and
[43:36] philippians 2 12.
[43:38] and that's where this
[43:41] the inspiration came because as i read
[43:42] those verses and the verses that came
[43:44] behind that
[43:46] it led me
[43:47] down a certain direction
[43:49] and
[43:52] i had no title until i finished putting
[43:55] my scriptures and quotes out
[43:57] usually i have notes and a lot of
[43:59] different things that i say in between
[44:00] the scriptures there's scriptures
[44:02] and there's quotes
[44:05] and we trust the lord
[44:07] that he'll put it together
[44:10] by his grace
[44:11] not by anything that we deserve
[44:14] but it's his promise to feed you
[44:17] amen
[44:18] and that's the desire in my heart is to
[44:19] see
[44:20] each one of you fed in the lord
[44:23] speaking by his his word
[44:25] through that so
[44:27] next scripture we have up there
[44:29] um is romans 8.
[44:32] so
[44:34] i'm going back uh
[44:37] the lord
[44:38] in this verse
[44:40] waiting for god
[44:42] how many have ever waited for god
[44:44] how many ever waited
[44:46] a decade for god
[44:49] how many ever waited longer than that
[44:51] how many are still waiting
[44:53] well all of us actually we're all
[44:55] waiting because we're waiting that's
[44:56] what christian life is is waiting for
[45:00] the rapture
[45:01] that's what every that's what every age
[45:03] was looking for and waiting for
[45:05] so in that sense we're all waiting but
[45:08] there's individual purposes we have in
[45:11] our life
[45:12] and we have to wait for
[45:15] god to work i think this is such a key
[45:18] this is a key
[45:19] verse here in waiting at least in my
[45:21] experiences because when you're waiting
[45:24] what's happening
[45:26] you say well nothing
[45:28] because you're waiting
[45:29] no
[45:31] there's a lot happening
[45:34] and you'll see as we go through the
[45:35] scriptures there is a lot happening
[45:38] but we wait
[45:39] and when we wait
[45:41] what happens we get
[45:44] weary
[45:45] we get
[45:47] we sometimes we get weak
[45:49] sometimes we feel purposeless
[45:52] we feel like whoa what am i doing i'm
[45:55] supposed to do something
[45:57] and god is saying
[45:59] just
[46:00] sit
[46:01] be still
[46:03] rest in me i have a purpose
[46:06] i have a plan
[46:08] i have not left you alone
[46:10] i've not cut you've not come to this
[46:11] place where i've just abandoned you
[46:13] i've i'm bringing you through something
[46:16] to bring something through you
[46:20] he wants to accomplish a purpose and so
[46:22] when we wait for god
[46:25] while we wait for him a lot is happening
[46:28] but a lot is happening inside of us
[46:31] it's not necessarily on the outside
[46:34] but on the inside of us god is doing
[46:37] something incredible
[46:39] something that couldn't come
[46:41] in another way
[46:43] i think if you look through
[46:46] scripture
[46:47] isn't it true that god made
[46:50] all of his servants wait
[46:52] and wait
[46:54] and wait and wait
[46:57] and so there's a great thing
[47:00] for every every servant of god we're all
[47:02] servants of god
[47:04] not just the preacher we're all servants
[47:05] of god but every child of god every son
[47:08] of god every daughter of god
[47:10] has to learn
[47:12] to wait on the lord
[47:15] the the greatest triumphs
[47:17] in the bible are people waiting on god
[47:22] the greatest failures
[47:25] in the bible are people that couldn't
[47:26] wait for god
[47:29] couldn't allow god
[47:31] to work out what he was trying to work
[47:33] out and put things in order and set
[47:35] things in the right stage
[47:38] and go when god says to go
[47:43] all right
[47:45] romans 8 23 and not only
[47:48] they but ourselves also
[47:50] which have the first fruits of the
[47:52] spirit
[47:53] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[47:57] waiting oh waiting
[47:59] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[48:02] redemption of our body we're waiting for
[48:04] glory we're waiting for that rapture to
[48:07] take place
[48:09] and when we're waiting what are we doing
[48:11] groaning
[48:13] that's what we read in the scripture
[48:14] before that crying
[48:16] weeping tears
[48:18] waiting for this
[48:20] immortality to come
[48:23] romans 8 24 says for we are saved by
[48:26] hope
[48:28] so
[48:28] this one is sometimes confused because
[48:30] the english word hope is kind of like a
[48:33] wish
[48:34] but in the bible hope is an earnest
[48:37] expectation
[48:39] for we we're saved by
[48:41] hope being an earnest expectation but an
[48:43] earnest expense expectation
[48:46] that is seen is not hope in other words
[48:49] you already have it
[48:50] you're not earnestly expecting already
[48:53] something you already possess
[48:54] for what a man seeth why does he yet
[48:57] hope for it
[48:59] but if we hope for that we see not then
[49:02] do we with patience wait for it
[49:05] and so that's key to the christian life
[49:08] we have to wait
[49:09] on god
[49:11] and we have to wait for god
[49:13] to accomplish his purpose in us
[49:17] i think
[49:19] as you get older
[49:21] you learn this art
[49:23] but when you're younger you don't want
[49:24] to wait for anything
[49:26] you just
[49:28] want action
[49:29] you want to move forward you want to
[49:31] push forward
[49:32] but if the young people that are
[49:34] listening the greatest
[49:36] the greatest thing you can learn as a
[49:38] young christian is to wait on the lord
[49:42] nothing is good is accomplished by
[49:44] pushing forward not listening to god not
[49:46] waiting for god to speak and just
[49:48] pushing forward in what you think you
[49:50] ought to do you can destroy your whole
[49:52] life doing that
[49:54] you can go out you can completely go off
[49:55] the rails no you'll never lose if you
[49:57] have true salvation you'll never lose
[49:59] that
[49:59] but you can go so far outside of the
[50:01] will trying to do him a service without
[50:04] that being what he wants to be doing
[50:06] what want to be accomplishing through
[50:08] you
[50:09] and if we understand scripturally if
[50:12] you're a seed of god god is going to
[50:13] bring you back to where you're supposed
[50:15] to be
[50:16] but it's probably going to hurt
[50:20] it's going to hurt
[50:25] second thessalonians 3 5 and the lord
[50:28] direct your hearts
[50:30] into the love of god
[50:32] and into the patient waiting for christ
[50:38] how this is critical
[50:41] a critical
[50:42] part of the christian faith
[50:45] is patient waiting
[50:48] we don't like that too much
[50:50] in america
[50:51] we want to have it now
[50:54] brother jack you started serving the
[50:56] lord a long time ago you're you're
[50:58] you were waiting then
[51:00] for christ and you're waiting now for
[51:02] christ
[51:03] and you'll will continue until he comes
[51:05] we'll continue waiting but
[51:07] many times we get impatient when we get
[51:09] impatient we start doing things and
[51:11] going in directions that we ought not to
[51:13] go
[51:15] wait on the lord
[51:17] we can be content
[51:19] just to be a servant
[51:20] just to do and be what he wants you to
[51:23] be
[51:23] don't run ahead of him and say i've got
[51:25] to do something i've got to go do this
[51:27] i've got either whether it's in
[51:29] a personal life situation whether it's
[51:32] in
[51:33] ministry in the local church on any
[51:35] level not just preaching
[51:37] whatever it is
[51:39] entrust yourself to the lord
[51:42] believe that he is sovereign
[51:45] over you and your life and the purpose
[51:48] that he has for you many times you see
[51:52] churches break up church split why
[51:55] because it's people that cannot wait for
[51:57] god
[51:58] to move
[52:00] you see marriage is split you see
[52:03] families broken why because they don't
[52:05] want to wait
[52:07] for god they want everything to be done
[52:09] their way
[52:10] and in their time
[52:12] and that's not how life works and that's
[52:15] not how god works
[52:20] brother branham says but not only this
[52:22] is from the ephesian church age
[52:24] but not only is the candlestick of gold
[52:26] and is a beaten gold
[52:28] hand crafted of beaten gold according to
[52:31] her blueprints
[52:32] which were spirit given outside of her
[52:34] lord and master jesus christ was ever
[52:37] a people so beaten and purged as the
[52:39] bride of jesus christ
[52:42] surely she's filling up the sufferings
[52:44] that christ has left behind her goods
[52:46] are despoiled her life is in jeopardy
[52:49] she is accounted as sheep for the
[52:50] slaughter
[52:51] she is killed all the day long she
[52:53] suffers much but in it
[52:55] all retaliates not neither does she
[52:57] cause others to suffer
[52:59] worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[53:00] bride of christ and as gold is malleable
[53:03] whereas brass will break with the
[53:05] beating this gold of god will bear her
[53:07] sufferings for the lord
[53:09] not bowed not broken not destroyed but
[53:11] formed as a thing of beauty and a joy
[53:14] forever by the trials
[53:16] and testings of this life
[53:20] do you know that was in the church ages
[53:21] book
[53:24] you know we we we understand and we'll
[53:26] get to that in a minute to talk about
[53:28] the difference between
[53:29] suffering tribulation and suffering in
[53:32] the tribulation
[53:34] those are two different things
[53:36] and it's important to differentiate that
[53:38] but
[53:41] look at this i mean no one suffers
[53:45] as much as the bride of christ for all
[53:47] ages
[53:50] too many times that's that's not in our
[53:52] theology
[53:54] no no please set that aside
[53:58] we're we're the bride we are not going
[54:00] to suffer
[54:02] because we're going to be taken in the
[54:03] rapture you're taking
[54:05] american
[54:07] approach to the gospel
[54:09] and superimposing that
[54:12] onto the true gospel
[54:14] and then adding that into message
[54:17] teaching
[54:18] about the rapture
[54:19] so the saints in ukraine
[54:22] are they suffering
[54:25] are saints in iran are they suffering
[54:27] saints in turkey are they suffering yeah
[54:30] they're not going through the
[54:30] tribulation period
[54:32] that's god's wrath
[54:34] this is not god's wrath
[54:36] necessarily directly it could be
[54:38] indirect but god's purpose
[54:41] for someone who is suffering that's a
[54:43] christian
[54:44] it's not wrath
[54:46] it's it's actually has a purpose to it
[54:50] it's either corrective or it's simply
[54:52] there
[54:53] to
[54:54] perfect us
[54:56] it's either to correct us or perfect us
[54:58] and even the correction
[55:00] is for the purpose of perfection
[55:04] so you might you might have suffered you
[55:05] might have had hard trials you may have
[55:07] difficulties that you're facing
[55:09] constantly you know i
[55:12] brother brother john
[55:13] sings that song one more valley one more
[55:15] hill which i love and i understand the
[55:17] bigger picture but i think
[55:19] brother there's one one more valley a
[55:21] day
[55:24] sometimes there's five of them
[55:27] and sometimes
[55:29] sometimes the hills are twice as
[55:31] high
[55:34] but in the big picture of course i
[55:36] understand
[55:37] the time is short
[55:39] the lord is coming soon
[55:40] the rapture is going to take place soon
[55:42] just around the corner and yet many
[55:45] trials
[55:47] many are the afflictions of the
[55:48] righteous but the lord delivers them out
[55:51] of them all
[55:52] and god's purpose for a believer when he
[55:55] brings trials it's never
[55:58] to pour out his wrath
[56:00] he has a great eternal purpose sometimes
[56:03] the lord allows us allows us to lose
[56:07] something or someone
[56:09] and we in our finite minds looking at
[56:12] time and space say oh it's terrible how
[56:15] could we ever suff how could we ever
[56:16] survive this and god is saying
[56:19] hold my hand
[56:21] trust me this hurts i know this i'm
[56:23] crying with you and yet understand i
[56:26] have a purpose
[56:27] that's higher that's greater that's more
[56:29] beautiful than you can even imagine
[56:33] and so
[56:34] we suffer we go through trials
[56:36] part of the reason is
[56:39] we are the people that god
[56:41] is working in and through to accomplish
[56:45] something in the earth
[56:47] and what happens satan opposes that
[56:50] satan fights against that
[56:53] and by by just not just naturally
[56:56] speaking though spiritually speaking i
[56:57] guess i should say spiritually speaking
[57:00] what's going to happen is there's going
[57:01] to be trials difficulties
[57:04] and god chooses those out for us
[57:07] even though satan comes against us satan
[57:09] is not like
[57:11] messing up god's program
[57:13] god's program is being accomplished
[57:15] perfectly
[57:18] but we face trials difficulties battles
[57:22] and testings of this life
[57:25] of course we would
[57:26] of course we would we're the people that
[57:28] god is using to bring this word to the
[57:31] whole world
[57:32] why wouldn't we would have to have
[57:35] opposition
[57:36] opposition from spiritual realms
[57:38] opposition from
[57:40] natural realms
[57:42] and so we suffer as a result
[57:44] as a result of being the bearers of the
[57:47] gospel
[57:49] and god says you know what
[57:51] i'm going to take those and use those
[57:53] and harness those
[57:55] to make you more like me
[58:02] in waiting
[58:05] we will be found obedient
[58:09] when we wait on him now of course
[58:12] it can this can go a million miles off
[58:14] to the wrong direction somebody just
[58:16] waits on the lord all the time and never
[58:18] takes action when the lord speaks
[58:20] that's not right either there's a
[58:21] balance to that
[58:24] but wait on him to be sure it's god that
[58:27] you know brother branham
[58:29] um tells on himself sometimes where he
[58:32] he says the lord the angel of the lord
[58:34] rebuked him and said you're just waiting
[58:36] for me to push you through a pipe
[58:38] and brother branham kind of gives a
[58:40] mixed review on that thinking okay on
[58:43] the one hand
[58:44] then i know everything i'm doing is the
[58:46] perfect will of the lord
[58:48] and when i wait on the angels of the
[58:49] lord to tell me what to do i know it's
[58:51] the perfect will of the lord
[58:52] but at the same time he's given me a
[58:54] commission
[58:56] and i should just go and follow those
[58:58] open doors
[58:59] and so i think together you bring bring
[59:02] those two
[59:03] thoughts together in a balance
[59:05] that's where we go because you know if
[59:07] you remember the some of the different
[59:09] stories where brother branham made his
[59:10] plan for his trip i think to the midwest
[59:14] and the lord gave him a dream and
[59:16] directed them completely somewhere else
[59:18] we've go when we're walking with him
[59:20] we've got to be able to say sorry
[59:22] brother i can't come to that meeting i
[59:23] know he planned it but the lord said to
[59:24] me over here
[59:26] or take that on to your personal life
[59:28] i made this commitment i thought this
[59:30] was the right way but excuse me forgive
[59:31] me
[59:33] the lord is telling me not to do that i
[59:34] have to go over here
[59:36] and so
[59:37] waiting isn't necessarily just sitting
[59:39] on your hands
[59:41] that's a that's also a misunderstanding
[59:43] there's a lot of obedience that takes
[59:45] place we don't we don't
[59:47] need
[59:48] necessarily god speaking us
[59:51] to us on every circumstance we have his
[59:54] word
[59:55] we have his word but there's things in
[59:57] our lives where we don't know the answer
[59:59] because it's not in it's not exactly in
[1:00:01] the word to move here to to go preach a
[1:00:04] certain place to go on a vacation all
[1:00:07] those things we should be following the
[1:00:08] leadership of the lord
[1:00:10] not our own fleshly desires
[1:00:13] say that i would never go on a vacation
[1:00:14] brother jason no god sometimes wants to
[1:00:17] send you away to give you rest
[1:00:21] but you wait on him you follow his
[1:00:22] leadership regardless
[1:00:25] but in
[1:00:26] waiting on the lord
[1:00:29] and for the lord
[1:00:31] we will be found obedient
[1:00:37] the first thing that comes to my mind in
[1:00:39] this is
[1:00:40] when i think about
[1:00:41] not waiting on the lord is
[1:00:43] soul
[1:00:44] you know what a tragedy
[1:00:47] god called him anointed him
[1:00:50] and he was appointed
[1:00:52] by the nation and
[1:00:54] set up by the nation and
[1:00:56] here he is get
[1:00:58] hearing direction direction
[1:01:00] from the prophet of god who's vindicated
[1:01:03] and he's told to go and and tarry seven
[1:01:06] days he tarried seven days according to
[1:01:07] the set time that samuel had appointed
[1:01:10] but samuel came not
[1:01:12] to gilgal and the people were scattered
[1:01:15] from him okay
[1:01:17] bad situation right it looks like i
[1:01:19] should i should act i should do
[1:01:21] something i've got to fix this problem
[1:01:23] don't we get that
[1:01:24] kind of thought process going in our
[1:01:26] head about church and different things
[1:01:31] this is bad everybody's leaving
[1:01:34] samuel you're messing it up for me
[1:01:38] and saul said bring hither a burnt
[1:01:40] offering to me
[1:01:41] and peace peace offerings
[1:01:45] saul did that
[1:01:46] and he offered the burnt offering
[1:01:50] and it came to pass that as soon as he
[1:01:51] had made an end of offering the burnt
[1:01:53] offering behold
[1:01:54] samuel came and saul went out to meet
[1:01:57] him
[1:01:58] that he might salute him
[1:02:01] it's a strange thing usually when you do
[1:02:04] wrong you just kind of
[1:02:06] run away but samuel is so
[1:02:09] crazy
[1:02:11] self-absorbed proud he runs out to
[1:02:14] samuel said i did a great job
[1:02:17] and samuel said what what have you done
[1:02:20] and saul said because i saw that the
[1:02:22] people were scattered from me and that
[1:02:24] thou camest not within the days
[1:02:26] appointed and that the philistines
[1:02:27] gathered themselves together at mikmash
[1:02:30] therefore said i the philistines will
[1:02:32] come down now upon me to gilgal and i
[1:02:34] have not made supplication of the lord i
[1:02:36] forced myself therefore and offered a
[1:02:39] burnt offering
[1:02:40] samuel said to saul
[1:02:42] that was done foolishly thou has not
[1:02:44] kept the commandment of the lord thy god
[1:02:46] which he commanded thee for now would
[1:02:48] the lord have established thy kingdom
[1:02:50] upon
[1:02:51] israel forever
[1:02:53] wow
[1:02:55] that was just
[1:02:57] he couldn't wait
[1:02:59] he saw the circumstances and said i'm
[1:03:01] the king i have to be a problem solver
[1:03:04] this will solve the problem i'm going to
[1:03:05] offer a sacrifice
[1:03:07] now you created the problem
[1:03:10] what if the lord was going to deliver
[1:03:12] them by only a few
[1:03:15] right and those people were supposed to
[1:03:16] go away
[1:03:17] have you ever seen an example of that in
[1:03:19] the bible before it doesn't matter if
[1:03:21] god if there's a few or there's a lot
[1:03:24] you wait on the lord
[1:03:27] he's not asking us to be problem solvers
[1:03:31] all the time
[1:03:32] i'm speaking to myself
[1:03:35] sometimes we should wait on the lord
[1:03:37] wait on the lord to
[1:03:39] bring the circumstances together who
[1:03:41] knows what would have happened but
[1:03:43] surely if samuel if saul would have just
[1:03:45] waited
[1:03:47] positive results would have come it had
[1:03:49] to
[1:03:50] but saul was looking only at what's
[1:03:52] going on around me and i need all these
[1:03:54] people to fight human thinking we get so
[1:03:57] caught up in human thinking thinking
[1:03:59] after the flesh this is how it's going
[1:04:01] to be and you know
[1:04:03] god doesn't need a great army to deliver
[1:04:05] by just needs one obedient person
[1:04:09] just one obedient person that one
[1:04:11] obedient person can conquer armies
[1:04:13] conquer nations take down empires
[1:04:19] philippians 1 27 this was the
[1:04:22] first verse the lord
[1:04:24] laid on my heart late last night
[1:04:27] only let your conversation
[1:04:30] be as it as it becometh the gospel of
[1:04:32] christ
[1:04:34] conversation speaks of your your conduct
[1:04:36] or your manner of living
[1:04:38] that whether i come and see you or else
[1:04:40] be absent i may hear of your affairs
[1:04:43] that you stand fast in one spirit
[1:04:46] with one mind
[1:04:48] striving together for the faith of the
[1:04:51] gospel
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:54] verse 28 and in nothing
[1:04:57] terrified by your adversaries
[1:05:00] which is to them an evident token of
[1:05:02] perdition
[1:05:03] but to you of salvation and that of god
[1:05:08] so
[1:05:08] here's a here's a foundation in this in
[1:05:11] sufferings and in trials don't be
[1:05:13] terrified
[1:05:15] by your adversaries
[1:05:17] don't be afraid
[1:05:19] don't be in fear
[1:05:21] because when we fear what does fear do
[1:05:23] fear
[1:05:24] speaks volumes as to where your faith is
[1:05:27] when you're when you have fear when
[1:05:29] you're under attack and you're afraid
[1:05:32] fear shows that you're the one
[1:05:35] that has the evident token of perdition
[1:05:38] but when you're under attack and you
[1:05:40] don't fear you just rest in the lord you
[1:05:42] encourage yourself in the lord
[1:05:44] as david did
[1:05:46] then that's an evident token of
[1:05:48] perdition to your enemies
[1:05:50] in other words it's a sign of defeat
[1:05:53] they're the devil's bringing all kinds
[1:05:55] of things railing accusations and
[1:05:57] fighting against you and you just are
[1:05:59] relaxed
[1:06:01] it's going to be fine it's going to work
[1:06:02] out
[1:06:04] i remember such a strange thing because
[1:06:06] usually i on a missions field there was
[1:06:08] this guy
[1:06:09] that uh
[1:06:11] uh i was preaching and he stood up and
[1:06:13] started asking all kinds of questions
[1:06:14] and
[1:06:15] he was getting angry with me and usually
[1:06:17] i will
[1:06:18] up the ante and answer back real quick
[1:06:21] to get him to sit down and
[1:06:22] for some reason the holy spirit just
[1:06:24] came over me and just i felt so relaxed
[1:06:27] i just said
[1:06:28] it's a good question it's going to be
[1:06:30] answered during the service don't worry
[1:06:32] about it
[1:06:33] have a seat kept preaching and then he
[1:06:35] stood up at the end
[1:06:37] and again he started yelling questions
[1:06:39] while i'm about to make an invitation
[1:06:41] for people to come
[1:06:43] come forward and for prayer and and so
[1:06:45] forth and he
[1:06:46] he just keeps talking so i just pray
[1:06:49] dismiss the service and
[1:06:51] oh people are all up in arms everybody's
[1:06:52] yelling they're mad at this guy because
[1:06:54] he ruined the atmosphere of the service
[1:06:56] and the pastor is so upset he comes up
[1:06:58] to my room at the conference center he's
[1:07:00] like what are we going to do with this
[1:07:01] guy's i said don't worry about it
[1:07:03] he didn't mean that
[1:07:05] just
[1:07:06] the lord will work this all out you just
[1:07:08] let's just pray so we we just
[1:07:10] bowed our heads and prayed together and
[1:07:12] said well just allow him to ask the
[1:07:14] question tomorrow after the service is
[1:07:16] over and
[1:07:17] again i felt just so relaxed so at peace
[1:07:20] like
[1:07:21] what is he tr why is he trying to do
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:23] that's it doesn't hurt me it doesn't
[1:07:25] harm me
[1:07:26] and the lord turned the whole situation
[1:07:29] around this guy
[1:07:30] from being upset says it's the best
[1:07:32] conference he's ever been to best
[1:07:34] services he's ever been to he learned so
[1:07:35] much
[1:07:36] he was so blessed
[1:07:38] and that's what we that's what we need
[1:07:40] the grace of the lord
[1:07:42] but that's what we need to be like when
[1:07:43] the devil attacks us am i always like
[1:07:45] that
[1:07:46] no
[1:07:50] are we always all like that
[1:07:53] no but we're we need to be striving with
[1:07:56] all our effort
[1:07:57] to be like that we don't need to be
[1:07:59] terrified by anything what are they
[1:08:01] going to kill us
[1:08:04] that's better
[1:08:05] that's a good thing what we think so
[1:08:07] temporary what about this person what
[1:08:09] about this do you know that god has
[1:08:11] everything in control in your life
[1:08:15] god promised to take care of our
[1:08:16] families
[1:08:18] he promised to provide for each one of
[1:08:20] us
[1:08:21] just be obedient
[1:08:23] let let the chips fall where they may
[1:08:26] as the carnal saying goes
[1:08:28] let it let whatever is going to
[1:08:29] whatever's whatever the lord wants to
[1:08:31] happen it's going to happen worrying
[1:08:33] about it is not going to change it
[1:08:35] but having faith about it could actually
[1:08:37] change the situation couldn't it
[1:08:41] so we need to be in this position don't
[1:08:43] be terrified by your adversaries
[1:08:46] now and sometimes it's just
[1:08:47] circumstances of life that appear to be
[1:08:49] an adversary but there's an adversary
[1:08:51] behind that
[1:08:53] creating those circumstances for you and
[1:08:55] so don't be terrified don't be worried
[1:08:56] don't be feared
[1:08:58] god's brother brad preached this i
[1:09:00] remember
[1:09:01] resonating in my mind when i could
[1:09:03] barely think about anything god's got
[1:09:05] this
[1:09:08] god has you in his hand
[1:09:10] don't be terrified
[1:09:12] because it when you're terrified it's an
[1:09:14] evident token of your own perdition
[1:09:17] but if you're walking in faith and
[1:09:19] you're not terrified
[1:09:22] who's who's going to be terrified your
[1:09:23] enemy
[1:09:27] philippians 1 28 and in nothing
[1:09:30] repeat
[1:09:31] for unto you it is given in the behalf
[1:09:33] of christ
[1:09:34] not only to believe on him
[1:09:37] amen hallelujah praise the lord
[1:09:42] but also to suffer
[1:09:43] for his sake
[1:09:46] why but why
[1:09:48] can't it just be easy
[1:09:51] no
[1:09:52] god didn't ordain it to be easy
[1:09:56] it was just easy and
[1:09:59] wouldn't be
[1:10:00] valuable to us
[1:10:03] we have to we also we believe on him
[1:10:06] and we suffer for his sake
[1:10:10] and guess what
[1:10:11] that shouldn't make us sad because what
[1:10:13] does the scripture say we're supposed to
[1:10:15] rejoice in our sufferings
[1:10:18] that's not natural that's not human
[1:10:22] but we're not supposed to be human right
[1:10:23] we're not supposed to be after the flesh
[1:10:26] we're supposed to have we have have a
[1:10:28] we're a different citizenship
[1:10:30] a different viewpoint a different heart
[1:10:33] on these matters
[1:10:34] should bring us rejoicing
[1:10:37] not sorrow
[1:10:39] having the same conflict which he saw in
[1:10:41] me
[1:10:42] and now here
[1:10:44] to be in me so
[1:10:46] in other words paul's saying you're
[1:10:48] we're all suffering together
[1:10:50] i'm suffering you heard about it
[1:10:53] you saw me suffering
[1:10:55] and now you're suffering as well
[1:10:58] but it's not for our own sake it's for
[1:11:01] the sake of christ
[1:11:05] philippians 2 12
[1:11:07] wherefore my beloved
[1:11:09] as you have always obeyed
[1:11:11] not as in my presence only
[1:11:14] but now much more in my absence work out
[1:11:17] your own
[1:11:18] salvation with fear and trembling work
[1:11:20] out your own salvation
[1:11:22] in one sense
[1:11:24] you there's that's not possible you
[1:11:26] cannot work out your own salvation only
[1:11:29] god
[1:11:30] can accomplish salvation in us so what
[1:11:32] does this mean work out
[1:11:35] it literally means to carry to its
[1:11:37] ultimate conclusion like a mathematics
[1:11:39] problem
[1:11:40] so you work out a mathematics problem it
[1:11:42] has an it has a conclusion at the end
[1:11:45] so you see those see those chalkboards
[1:11:48] they filled with all kinds of things
[1:11:50] well there's there's an end that they
[1:11:52] come to even though there's it's totally
[1:11:54] filled and
[1:11:55] no none of us could even make out what
[1:11:56] it is
[1:11:57] but but yet we in our salvation we're
[1:12:00] supposed to carry it out
[1:12:03] to its ultimate conclusion
[1:12:06] with fear and trembling
[1:12:09] so accompanied by
[1:12:10] fear and trembling so there's there is
[1:12:13] effort that we have to put into it
[1:12:16] there is surrender that we have to do
[1:12:20] and there there needs to be that place
[1:12:22] where there's such reverence
[1:12:24] and trembling at god's word that we know
[1:12:27] we can't make it on our own and we can't
[1:12:29] make it in following after the flesh
[1:12:32] and so it takes a surrender takes a
[1:12:35] deliverance continually daily more than
[1:12:37] daily hourly
[1:12:39] of ourselves over the lord that he would
[1:12:41] work in us and change us
[1:12:44] why though
[1:12:46] because god it's god working
[1:12:49] in you both to will
[1:12:51] and to do of his good pleasure so we can
[1:12:54] carry our salvation out to its ultimate
[1:12:56] conclusion
[1:12:58] why because why because god
[1:13:00] is
[1:13:01] working his power in us
[1:13:05] both to will that means to choose
[1:13:07] so when we when when our on our end what
[1:13:10] do we do we choose we make the right
[1:13:13] scriptural choices we we wait on the
[1:13:16] lord we seek his face
[1:13:18] and we wait on the lord some more
[1:13:21] wait for him to speak to us and guide us
[1:13:22] and show us show us what to do
[1:13:25] that's on our end and we just
[1:13:26] continually give ourselves to the lord
[1:13:28] and do the things that we are nowhere
[1:13:30] supposed to do because
[1:13:32] those things that god is willing those
[1:13:34] things in us god is leading us to make
[1:13:36] those choices and to do what's pleasing
[1:13:39] to him
[1:13:40] right
[1:13:41] so it takes a cooperation
[1:13:43] of wills
[1:13:45] god working in our will
[1:13:47] us surrendering that will
[1:13:53] do all things
[1:13:55] without
[1:13:56] murmurings and disputings that's that
[1:13:58] means
[1:14:00] do all things without complaining
[1:14:02] and fighting
[1:14:04] so don't let your
[1:14:06] testimony be
[1:14:08] complaining
[1:14:10] and fighting i think that's what paul's
[1:14:11] trying to say
[1:14:12] when people see your life don't think oh
[1:14:15] man here comes the complainer again
[1:14:18] always going to have 10 things to
[1:14:19] complain about the gas prices are high
[1:14:21] this is problem that's a problem
[1:14:25] biden's this and
[1:14:26] this one come on
[1:14:28] let's stop complaining
[1:14:30] and start trusting
[1:14:32] that god is sovereign that he's in
[1:14:34] control we don't like the gas prices we
[1:14:37] don't like inflation
[1:14:38] whatever
[1:14:40] god is in control god provide promise to
[1:14:43] give you food even if inflation was
[1:14:46] 29
[1:14:48] if it was 140
[1:14:50] god's promise is still the same
[1:14:53] it didn't change when biden became
[1:14:54] president it didn't change when the gas
[1:14:58] prices went up so stop worrying about it
[1:15:01] how will i be able to make ends meet god
[1:15:03] makes the ends meet
[1:15:05] you trust
[1:15:08] regardless of the circumstances
[1:15:12] trust him don't complain
[1:15:14] don't complain and don't fight
[1:15:17] these are why should we not because
[1:15:19] these these are manifestations of
[1:15:22] unbelief
[1:15:25] fighting
[1:15:26] complaining
[1:15:28] are not the fruit of the spirit just in
[1:15:30] case y'all didn't know that
[1:15:37] some people are sure
[1:15:39] 100
[1:15:40] that they are the fruit of the spirit
[1:15:42] but they're not
[1:15:45] they're not it's love joy peace
[1:15:49] patience
[1:15:51] peace and patience
[1:15:52] not complaining and fighting
[1:15:56] long suffering
[1:16:01] it's long
[1:16:02] and it's suffering
[1:16:05] and it requires patience
[1:16:08] philippians 2 15 that you may be
[1:16:10] blameless
[1:16:12] and harmless
[1:16:14] the sons of god without rebuke in the
[1:16:16] midst of a crooked
[1:16:18] and perverse nation among whom you shine
[1:16:21] as lights in the world so that's god's
[1:16:24] purpose for us to shine
[1:16:26] but you're not going to shine if you
[1:16:28] complain
[1:16:29] and fight
[1:16:33] why why why the
[1:16:35] admonition not to complain
[1:16:37] and to fight because we know
[1:16:40] that we suffer
[1:16:42] we have trials
[1:16:44] we have difficulties and god has
[1:16:46] ordained it so in our lives
[1:16:49] because he know there's two things
[1:16:51] that perfect us
[1:16:53] the word
[1:16:55] and trials
[1:16:58] if god could have done it another way he
[1:17:00] certainly would have but he chose not to
[1:17:04] he this is his perfect means to make you
[1:17:07] more like jesus christ
[1:17:10] the the word in your heart
[1:17:12] and the trials that you face
[1:17:15] we just want it to be the word
[1:17:18] don't it doesn't work that way it's not
[1:17:20] scriptural
[1:17:22] there must trials must come
[1:17:25] and if we want those trials if we want
[1:17:28] our waiting to be fruitful
[1:17:30] if we want those trials to be fruitful
[1:17:33] then don't
[1:17:34] damage what the lord is doing
[1:17:37] by complaining
[1:17:39] i heard a minister say one time is
[1:17:41] we're
[1:17:42] it's like a it's like a funnel that has
[1:17:44] a
[1:17:45] a a way to control and stop
[1:17:48] the bottom from coming out so
[1:17:52] when when we're going through a trial
[1:17:54] and we're waiting on the lord to move
[1:17:58] god is pouring good things into us
[1:18:01] and
[1:18:02] what we can do is we can take those good
[1:18:05] things and empty them out
[1:18:07] by complaining
[1:18:08] murmuring and fighting over the trial
[1:18:11] that we're facing god's pouring it in
[1:18:13] and we're just letting it come out by
[1:18:15] complaining and not trusting the lord
[1:18:18] and so don't don't use complaining as to
[1:18:21] open that
[1:18:22] spigot of good things that god's putting
[1:18:24] in you
[1:18:25] let it build up god wants it to build up
[1:18:28] and he wants it to overflow those good
[1:18:30] things onto other people
[1:18:33] but too many times i
[1:18:35] start complaining start fussing this
[1:18:38] isn't as it should be i wanted it to be
[1:18:39] this way these were my expectations
[1:18:42] we gotta let go
[1:18:43] of our dreams and expectations
[1:18:46] and allow god just simply to work and
[1:18:48] that's to be vessels for him to work
[1:18:51] through
[1:18:57] acts 14 22 confirming the souls
[1:19:00] of the disciples
[1:19:02] and exhorting them to continue in the
[1:19:04] faith
[1:19:05] and that we must through much
[1:19:07] tribulation enter into the kingdom of
[1:19:09] god paul was not a very good prosperity
[1:19:11] preacher
[1:19:14] all the other stuff was good but then
[1:19:16] that last part you know if you really
[1:19:18] want the ties and offerings to be coming
[1:19:20] in and building up your bank account you
[1:19:21] gotta leave that last part out
[1:19:27] but god doesn't leave that last part out
[1:19:31] and that that's the truth through much
[1:19:33] tribulation
[1:19:35] we must enter the king into the kingdom
[1:19:37] of god
[1:19:38] you want to enter into the kingdom of
[1:19:39] god
[1:19:40] here's a path and it's called much
[1:19:43] tribulation
[1:19:44] here's another path it's it leads to
[1:19:47] hell it's the good life
[1:19:50] which one do you want to take
[1:19:52] most people choose to the good life
[1:19:55] and at least the perdition
[1:19:57] we have to choose the road that god
[1:20:00] put us put put himself
[1:20:02] with you on
[1:20:05] and it caught trials suffering we want
[1:20:08] to do everything to avoid it
[1:20:10] we try as hard as we can continually and
[1:20:13] dedicate our lives
[1:20:16] to fight as hard as we can to avoid
[1:20:18] suffering trials and tribulation
[1:20:22] but it's missing the point we we don't
[1:20:26] go through our lives to avoid those
[1:20:27] things we go through our lives to be
[1:20:29] pleasing to the lord
[1:20:31] and whatever comes our way
[1:20:33] that comes our way
[1:20:35] sometimes times are good and it's a
[1:20:37] little easy sometimes times are very
[1:20:40] difficult
[1:20:42] and the trials are hard
[1:20:44] god is in both of them we just just rest
[1:20:47] in him
[1:20:49] suffering tribulation versus suffering
[1:20:51] in the tribulation so
[1:20:54] through much tribulation we must enter
[1:20:56] the kingdom of god there's a difference
[1:20:57] between what we
[1:20:59] theologically titled the tribulation
[1:21:01] period
[1:21:03] versus
[1:21:04] suffering tribulation
[1:21:07] tribulation speaks of pressure
[1:21:11] squeezing
[1:21:12] trials
[1:21:14] but we have
[1:21:16] one is like we said before there's god's
[1:21:18] wrath
[1:21:19] that brings the tribulation
[1:21:22] and then there is trials and
[1:21:23] tribulations that we face
[1:21:26] in our life which god has chosen and
[1:21:28] appointed for us to go through for our
[1:21:30] perfection and for his eternal glory and
[1:21:33] for our good
[1:21:34] those are two different things
[1:21:36] so first thessalonians 5 9
[1:21:40] speaking of the bride for god has not
[1:21:42] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[1:21:45] salvation by our lord jesus christ
[1:21:48] so the saints in ukraine they're not
[1:21:50] going through the tribulation period
[1:21:51] they're not going through the wrath of
[1:21:53] god
[1:21:54] this is a suffering and a trial that god
[1:21:57] has a lot allotted for them to go
[1:21:59] through
[1:22:00] we may have to go through it too
[1:22:03] god has allotted this trial for them
[1:22:06] to perfect them
[1:22:08] and god is working in their lives and
[1:22:10] giving them peace and strength
[1:22:12] and helping them through this
[1:22:14] all right but it's not it's not god's
[1:22:16] wrath
[1:22:17] but when the bride is taken out of the
[1:22:19] way or i should say christ in the bride
[1:22:22] is taken out of the way then the man of
[1:22:24] sin can be revealed
[1:22:26] then god's wrath is going to be poured
[1:22:28] out
[1:22:30] completely on the earth
[1:22:32] we're not ordained to that we're not
[1:22:34] ordained to go through that
[1:22:36] so first thessalonians 5 1 but of the
[1:22:38] times and the seasons brethren you have
[1:22:40] no need that i write unto you for
[1:22:42] yourselves know perfectly
[1:22:44] that the day of the lord so cometh as a
[1:22:46] thief in the night
[1:22:48] for when they shall say peace and safety
[1:22:51] then sudden destruction comes upon them
[1:22:53] as travail upon a woman with child
[1:22:56] and they shall not escape
[1:22:59] but you brethren are not in darkness
[1:23:01] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:23:03] thief
[1:23:06] so again there's a that's that's that
[1:23:09] difference we're not when you go through
[1:23:11] trials
[1:23:12] and tribulation and suffering it's not
[1:23:14] god's wrath
[1:23:16] god's wrath is going to be yes god's
[1:23:18] wrath is being poured out on the world
[1:23:22] and we suffer because we're in the world
[1:23:24] right but god's purpose is not so that
[1:23:27] he would put his wrath on you personally
[1:23:30] the hurricane comes through and your
[1:23:31] house is destroyed
[1:23:33] it's not god's wrath against you though
[1:23:35] it's god's wrath against the world you
[1:23:38] see that distinction it might be let me
[1:23:40] let me take a minute
[1:23:41] and explain it
[1:23:43] for you bad things have happened since
[1:23:45] the fall right
[1:23:47] bad things have happened to god's people
[1:23:50] since the fault it's part of living in a
[1:23:52] fallen world
[1:23:54] but god takes those things
[1:23:57] and uses them
[1:23:58] for
[1:23:59] your good
[1:24:01] for his glory
[1:24:02] for your perfection he's done it all
[1:24:04] through the ages as trials and tests
[1:24:07] but then there's coming a time where
[1:24:09] god's pouring his wrath on the whole
[1:24:11] world
[1:24:12] there's still elect on the earth right
[1:24:14] 144 thousand
[1:24:17] and god has his hands on them and god
[1:24:19] protects protects them
[1:24:21] for that season
[1:24:24] um
[1:24:25] as
[1:24:26] the prophet says they're type of the
[1:24:27] remnant that's carried over
[1:24:30] but
[1:24:32] god is pouring his wrath out on the
[1:24:34] gentile world
[1:24:36] okay
[1:24:37] that's why we're taken out of the way
[1:24:38] because they've rejected the message of
[1:24:40] elijah they've turned against god only
[1:24:43] thing left is wrath and the only thing
[1:24:45] that's holding it back is his bride
[1:24:47] being in the earth today
[1:24:49] so once we're gone then wrath can come
[1:24:52] so there's a big difference between
[1:24:54] suffering because we're on a fallen
[1:24:55] world and god actively saying i'm going
[1:24:58] to destroy this thing and start all over
[1:25:00] again he says you can't you can't be
[1:25:02] here when i'm doing this because i've
[1:25:04] not appointed you to that wrath
[1:25:09] um first thessalonians 5 4 but ye
[1:25:11] brethren
[1:25:12] are not in dark
[1:25:14] next one
[1:25:15] ii corinthians 1 3 blessed be god
[1:25:18] even the father of our lord jesus christ
[1:25:20] the father of mercies and the god of all
[1:25:22] comfort
[1:25:24] who comforts us in all our tribulation
[1:25:27] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:25:29] which are in any trouble by the comfort
[1:25:31] we're with we ourselves are comforted of
[1:25:34] god that's really worthy but think about
[1:25:37] this is
[1:25:38] in other words god is taking you through
[1:25:40] something some difficult trial
[1:25:43] so that he can comfort you and then use
[1:25:46] you
[1:25:47] to comfort and help someone else who
[1:25:50] will go through that trial
[1:25:51] so then they
[1:25:53] through you are comforted of god
[1:25:56] so it's not pointless and purposeless
[1:25:59] what we're going through
[1:26:00] what we go through god wants to comfort
[1:26:03] you and use you
[1:26:04] to be a blessing to other people
[1:26:07] for as the sufferings of christ abound
[1:26:09] in us
[1:26:11] so our consolation also
[1:26:13] abounds by christ
[1:26:16] for as
[1:26:17] so we don't want sufferings to abound
[1:26:18] but they do
[1:26:20] sufferings abound
[1:26:21] but where suffering abounds
[1:26:24] his comfort abounds amen
[1:26:28] and whether we be afflicted it is for
[1:26:30] your consolation
[1:26:32] and salvation
[1:26:34] isn't that interesting paul speaking
[1:26:38] speaking of
[1:26:39] i guess you could say his the ministry
[1:26:42] team
[1:26:43] he says we're we're being afflicted
[1:26:45] what is it for
[1:26:47] so that you'll be comforted and consoled
[1:26:50] and saved
[1:26:52] think about that
[1:26:53] that's quite a statement
[1:26:55] god will take you and it's not just
[1:26:57] people in ministry we're all in ministry
[1:27:00] god will take you through some
[1:27:02] affliction so that someone else can be
[1:27:05] comforted
[1:27:07] and saved
[1:27:09] so
[1:27:10] that person's salvation
[1:27:14] couldn't happen
[1:27:15] unless you
[1:27:17] went through what you went through
[1:27:19] to be a testimony to them
[1:27:22] so they could get saved
[1:27:24] which is
[1:27:26] effectual
[1:27:27] it means that it works
[1:27:30] in the enduring of the same sufferings
[1:27:33] which we also suffer
[1:27:35] or whether we be comforted it is for
[1:27:38] your consolation and
[1:27:40] salvation
[1:27:41] so again
[1:27:42] we get afflicted we get delivered it's
[1:27:44] for you
[1:27:45] it's for someone else isn't that a
[1:27:48] different way to look at
[1:27:50] the trials that we go through
[1:27:52] we're we tend to be so hyper focused on
[1:27:54] what we're going through
[1:27:56] and if we just looked at it like paul
[1:27:58] paul is saying i'm going through
[1:27:59] something
[1:28:00] very difficult going through a hard
[1:28:02] trial i'm going through suffering
[1:28:04] it's for you
[1:28:06] so that you would get saved so that you
[1:28:08] would get delivered so that you would be
[1:28:09] comforted
[1:28:11] that turns the focus from
[1:28:15] me
[1:28:16] to others
[1:28:19] and that in itself will turn you from
[1:28:21] complaining about the trial
[1:28:24] to rejoicing god is doing something
[1:28:26] amazing through this circumstance
[1:28:30] and our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[1:28:33] that as you are partakers participants
[1:28:36] of the sufferings
[1:28:38] so shall you be also of the consolation
[1:28:44] he's connecting those things together
[1:28:46] like it's a sure thing
[1:28:48] right
[1:28:49] if if you participate in suffering
[1:28:53] you're gonna
[1:28:54] participate in comfort
[1:28:56] can you say thank you lord
[1:28:58] that that's a promise
[1:29:00] if you're suffering if you're going
[1:29:01] through a hard trial
[1:29:03] say thank you lord comfort's coming
[1:29:07] consolation's coming
[1:29:11] for we would not brethren have you
[1:29:13] ignorant of our trouble which came to us
[1:29:16] in asia
[1:29:18] amen so
[1:29:19] here's paul saying i want you to
[1:29:21] understand
[1:29:22] something that we went through
[1:29:25] testifying of what they went through
[1:29:27] that we were pressed out of measure
[1:29:31] above strength in so much that we
[1:29:33] despaired
[1:29:34] even of life
[1:29:36] you know there's this thing that we see
[1:29:37] and says god won't put on you
[1:29:40] something more than what you can handle
[1:29:43] uh
[1:29:46] yeah he will
[1:29:48] yeah he will he did paul
[1:29:51] he'll continually put things
[1:29:53] in your lives that you can't handle
[1:29:56] why
[1:29:57] because he's god
[1:30:00] because he is powerful he's mighty to
[1:30:02] deliver
[1:30:03] and he wants us not trusting in
[1:30:05] ourselves i think i'm getting i'm
[1:30:08] getting to the next scripture but we had
[1:30:10] this sentence
[1:30:11] of death
[1:30:12] in ourselves that's dire
[1:30:15] i was sure i was sure to be a dead man
[1:30:18] that's basically what he's saying i was
[1:30:20] a goner
[1:30:23] but why did we have this
[1:30:25] not for no reason this wasn't
[1:30:26] purposeless it wasn't pointless it was
[1:30:28] so that we would not trust in ourselves
[1:30:31] but in god which raises the dead
[1:30:36] and so yep you're going to get things
[1:30:38] put on you that you cannot
[1:30:41] handle
[1:30:42] that you cannot deal with and you're
[1:30:43] going to lift your hands and say lord i
[1:30:45] can't i don't know i don't know how to
[1:30:47] make it through and he's going to say
[1:30:49] trust in me i raise the dead
[1:30:53] don't trust in yourselves
[1:30:55] if we only were given what we could
[1:30:57] handle then where would our faith be
[1:31:00] in me in my abilities
[1:31:07] who delivered us from so great at death
[1:31:10] and doth deliver
[1:31:12] in whom we trust that he will yet
[1:31:15] deliver us
[1:31:18] in other words i was i was i was
[1:31:21] delivered in the past from death
[1:31:23] i can trust this god who's delivered me
[1:31:26] in the past to continually deliver me
[1:31:28] until it's time my time to go it's like
[1:31:30] brother jason said i'm i'm immortal
[1:31:34] i'm unkillable
[1:31:35] until it's time for god to take me home
[1:31:39] and so not because i have some
[1:31:42] superpower
[1:31:44] but because
[1:31:45] god has a
[1:31:46] eternal purpose that cannot be blocked
[1:31:52] philippians 3 10
[1:31:54] that i may know him and the power of his
[1:31:57] resurrection
[1:31:59] that's good i like that
[1:32:01] i want to know him in the power of his
[1:32:02] resurrection
[1:32:05] let's just stop there can we just do
[1:32:07] part a of that verse
[1:32:09] and not move on
[1:32:10] but they go together don't they
[1:32:13] if you don't put them together you're
[1:32:14] not going to get
[1:32:16] either part
[1:32:18] you need and the fellowship of his
[1:32:20] sufferings being made
[1:32:21] conformable unto his death
[1:32:24] this is directly absolutely linked
[1:32:28] our life in him has to be made
[1:32:30] conformable to his death
[1:32:32] if our life is not continually in this
[1:32:35] process of him cleaning us
[1:32:37] making us conformable to his death
[1:32:40] we're not going to know him
[1:32:42] in the power of his resurrection and the
[1:32:44] fellowship of his sufferings you might
[1:32:45] get an anointing you might get excited
[1:32:47] you might shout you might dance
[1:32:49] but that's not getting more like jesus
[1:32:52] that's people do that at rock concerts
[1:32:55] at baseball games football games they do
[1:32:57] it way better than you do
[1:32:59] that don't make you a christian
[1:33:01] it's good to shout and i believe in all
[1:33:03] that
[1:33:04] i do but from a heart that has been
[1:33:08] changed that's experienced these trials
[1:33:11] these sufferings and says
[1:33:13] i'm going to savor christ more than i
[1:33:15] savor this life
[1:33:18] then shout and dance we should be
[1:33:20] shouting and dancing right now
[1:33:22] but sometimes the word is heavy isn't it
[1:33:25] sometimes it carries a weight
[1:33:28] and we we we begin to think and
[1:33:31] i've said it before
[1:33:32] to
[1:33:33] in private but
[1:33:35] you know many ministers they want to get
[1:33:37] you so excited and i failed if i didn't
[1:33:39] get the people jumping and shouting and
[1:33:42] screaming amen and i think man when i
[1:33:44] say something and they're so quiet
[1:33:46] i know that
[1:33:48] it's it's hit its point
[1:33:50] because there's a great reverence
[1:33:52] that takes place sometimes and there's a
[1:33:54] trembling that happens inside of us
[1:33:56] there's a trembling in me many times
[1:33:58] when i preach the word
[1:33:59] because there this is this is god we're
[1:34:01] talking about this is truth we're
[1:34:03] talking about it's heavy
[1:34:06] it's not just a dancing party every time
[1:34:09] sometimes it causes us to go on our
[1:34:11] our knees sometimes it causes us to be
[1:34:14] still
[1:34:15] and know that he is god
[1:34:21] and in all of these things
[1:34:23] i mean i have i'm emotional i get
[1:34:25] excited i get thankful but in all of
[1:34:27] this
[1:34:28] i want to be more like jesus christ
[1:34:30] that's my goal in my life that's the
[1:34:32] purpose that i have the purpose in my
[1:34:34] ministry is to help you be more like
[1:34:36] jesus christ
[1:34:38] to for you to grow
[1:34:39] for you to be strengthened to for you to
[1:34:42] have the have the power of the word in
[1:34:44] your life that you can go through hard
[1:34:47] trials and trust in the lord
[1:34:50] it's not just about looking good and we
[1:34:52] man we had good meetings you still see
[1:34:54] those people they're hanging from the
[1:34:55] chandeliers
[1:34:58] no i want to see you living and looking
[1:35:00] like jesus christ
[1:35:02] that's my goal
[1:35:04] and if you hang from the chandeliers
[1:35:06] praise the lord
[1:35:09] colossians 1 24 who now rejoice in my
[1:35:13] sufferings for you and fill up that
[1:35:15] which is behind
[1:35:17] of the afflictions of christ in my flesh
[1:35:19] for his body's sake which is
[1:35:22] the church
[1:35:24] who now rejoice in my sufferings
[1:35:29] lord give us that attitude all i can say
[1:35:31] is i'm helpless because
[1:35:34] my flesh does not rejoice in sufferings
[1:35:37] my flesh wants to complain about
[1:35:39] sufferings
[1:35:41] so it we have to be
[1:35:43] out of the flesh
[1:35:45] we gotta be in the spirit we gotta we
[1:35:47] gotta we we gotta see things the way god
[1:35:49] sees things
[1:35:52] and he says fill up
[1:35:55] that which is behind
[1:35:57] of the afflictions of christ in my
[1:35:59] flesh for his body sake it sort of
[1:36:01] sounds like he's saying that
[1:36:03] maybe the cross was not
[1:36:05] sufficient
[1:36:06] like
[1:36:07] he didn't suffer enough so
[1:36:09] we've got to suffer
[1:36:11] more so that christ suffers more but i
[1:36:13] don't believe that's what it's saying
[1:36:15] because
[1:36:16] that sacrifice was perfect
[1:36:19] and it's once for all
[1:36:22] he doesn't need to suffer again and
[1:36:24] again he suffered once for all and it
[1:36:26] completed
[1:36:27] the work that god had for him to do
[1:36:29] there to bring salvation but
[1:36:32] there is this aspect where there is
[1:36:34] suffering that takes place in the body
[1:36:36] of christ and if you remember i think i
[1:36:39] have that as the next
[1:36:40] verse yeah saul persecuting the church
[1:36:44] and he fell to the earth and heard a
[1:36:45] voice saying unto him saul saul why
[1:36:48] persecute us
[1:36:49] thou me
[1:36:51] well saul was persecuting jesus
[1:36:54] how was he persecuting jesus by
[1:36:56] persecuting the church
[1:36:58] and so there needs to be a filling up
[1:37:02] of those afflictions there's afflictions
[1:37:05] that we need to go through to perfect
[1:37:07] the church right
[1:37:09] we have to be perfected to go on the
[1:37:11] rapture
[1:37:12] god he's he's sending his word to
[1:37:14] perfect us but he also sends trials
[1:37:16] and suffering to perfect us so there's
[1:37:19] like a there's a measure that he has it
[1:37:21] says okay the the suffering has to be
[1:37:24] filled up this much
[1:37:25] and so
[1:37:26] christ is suffering jesus is being
[1:37:29] persecuted
[1:37:31] through us
[1:37:33] in our body
[1:37:34] in his body
[1:37:36] which is the church
[1:37:39] all right romans 8 17
[1:37:41] i think i'm coming to the end though i
[1:37:43] have no idea actually
[1:37:45] i'm ceased following my
[1:37:48] notes here
[1:37:50] just want to make sure i'm calling up
[1:37:52] the
[1:37:53] musicians at the right time but
[1:37:56] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[1:37:58] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[1:38:01] that we suffer with him that we may also
[1:38:03] be glorif be also
[1:38:05] glorified together
[1:38:07] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:38:09] present time are not worthy to be
[1:38:10] compared with the glory
[1:38:12] which shall be revealed in us again
[1:38:15] directly connecting our glory with
[1:38:18] suffering
[1:38:19] you're not going to get there
[1:38:21] to glory
[1:38:22] without first having suffered suffered
[1:38:25] for the sake of the gospel
[1:38:28] and it's not worthy the sufferings of
[1:38:30] this present time are not even worthy to
[1:38:32] be compared
[1:38:34] i mean think about it there's times
[1:38:35] where you're so consumed by what you're
[1:38:38] going through you can't imagine even
[1:38:40] getting through it
[1:38:41] and here paul is saying it's not even
[1:38:43] worth
[1:38:44] the comparison
[1:38:46] let's not even take time let's not waste
[1:38:48] our time to try to compare these two
[1:38:50] things because the glory is so
[1:38:52] beyond
[1:38:55] what the suffering is we're going
[1:38:57] through
[1:38:59] second timothy 2 12. if we suffer we
[1:39:02] shall also reign with him if we deny him
[1:39:04] he also will deny us
[1:39:07] so if if
[1:39:09] again this is a if
[1:39:11] if you suffer
[1:39:13] then you'll reign with him we want to
[1:39:14] reign with the lord
[1:39:16] then you're going to have to suffer
[1:39:19] that's not nice why
[1:39:22] why do i have to do that
[1:39:24] because it's it's god's program to
[1:39:27] perfect to produce character
[1:39:30] second timothy 3 12 yea and all that
[1:39:32] will live godly in christ jesus shall
[1:39:35] suffer
[1:39:36] persecution
[1:39:41] so before i go forward just take a
[1:39:43] second
[1:39:46] god could have created all of us
[1:39:50] instantly
[1:39:51] from the dust
[1:39:53] put us on a perfect world
[1:39:55] and we could have lived eternally
[1:39:57] together rejoicing in god
[1:40:00] but
[1:40:01] god did not want to do that
[1:40:03] he put adam and eve and he put in them
[1:40:06] the capabilities
[1:40:08] to fall and produce all the evil that we
[1:40:10] see in this world today
[1:40:12] the good that god produces
[1:40:16] in his children
[1:40:18] and for his glory far exceeds what it
[1:40:21] would have been if god would have just
[1:40:23] made it easy and perfect for all of us
[1:40:25] for all of eternity we never would have
[1:40:28] understood
[1:40:30] who god is
[1:40:31] we never would have understood his
[1:40:33] character we never we never would have
[1:40:36] reached a place of maturity
[1:40:39] if everything's just perfect for your
[1:40:40] children and they're just spoiled to
[1:40:42] death
[1:40:43] what happens
[1:40:44] rottenness is what happens
[1:40:47] they've got everything that they want
[1:40:48] and they they they
[1:40:50] never corrected they never face any
[1:40:52] difficulties the minute anything comes
[1:40:55] their way any testing comes their way
[1:40:57] they crumble
[1:40:59] they absolutely crumble and so for god
[1:41:02] for god to bring about perfection the
[1:41:06] world had to be exactly
[1:41:09] the way it was
[1:41:16] from the spirit and church age why does
[1:41:18] he stand by the reason is in romans 8
[1:41:21] 17 and 18 and if children then heirs
[1:41:23] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:41:25] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:41:28] may be also glorified together for i
[1:41:30] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:41:31] present time are not worthy to be
[1:41:33] compared with the glory which will be
[1:41:34] revealed in us
[1:41:35] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:41:37] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:41:39] reign the reason for this is that
[1:41:41] character is simply never made
[1:41:43] without suffering
[1:41:45] character is a victory not a gift
[1:41:48] a man without character can't reign
[1:41:50] because power apart from character is
[1:41:52] satanic
[1:41:53] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:41:55] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:41:57] throne on the same basis that he
[1:41:59] overcame and is set down in his father's
[1:42:01] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:42:04] with him
[1:42:08] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:42:10] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:42:12] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:42:14] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[1:42:17] treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:42:20] willing to enter his kingdom through
[1:42:22] much tribulation
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:26] we
[1:42:29] we need it
[1:42:31] why do we suffer because we need it
[1:42:35] we need it because we need character
[1:42:38] and god that's how god builds character
[1:42:40] in us
[1:42:41] and in lives and there's no there's no
[1:42:44] short there's no shortcut
[1:42:46] to that
[1:42:48] it comes through hard trials and
[1:42:49] difficulties
[1:42:52] in the sermon shalom god is a jealous
[1:42:54] god remember suffering for his word's
[1:42:56] sake
[1:42:56] is growing pains of his grace when you
[1:42:59] suffer for his word's sake it's just
[1:43:00] growing pains you know how a little kid
[1:43:02] 10 12 years old gets pains come and say
[1:43:04] mama my arms hurt and my legs are
[1:43:06] hurting so forth it's growing pains it
[1:43:08] shows he's got some good vitamins he's
[1:43:10] growing up
[1:43:11] sometimes it takes trials to break the
[1:43:14] bands of the world off of us
[1:43:17] take you out of the world might be have
[1:43:18] to take you out of your creed first like
[1:43:20] the man drowning in the river you have
[1:43:22] to take him out of the river before you
[1:43:23] get the river out of the man that's
[1:43:25] about the way god has to do sometimes
[1:43:27] let them throw you out one time then
[1:43:29] they get the world out of you got to get
[1:43:31] you out of the world first sometimes
[1:43:33] these growing pains is what does that oh
[1:43:35] yes
[1:43:37] so
[1:43:40] no again no bypassing
[1:43:42] when you're when if you want to grow to
[1:43:44] be an adult
[1:43:46] you have to go through some growing
[1:43:48] pains
[1:43:49] if you want to grow to be a mature
[1:43:51] christian you're gonna have to go
[1:43:52] through some pains and some trials
[1:43:55] ii corinthians 12 7
[1:43:58] the apostle paul
[1:44:01] and lest i should be exalted above
[1:44:03] measure through the abundance of the
[1:44:04] revelations in other words unless lest i
[1:44:08] would be given over to
[1:44:10] pride
[1:44:11] in my own self in my own position in god
[1:44:15] what did god do there was given to me a
[1:44:17] thorn in the flesh listen to what he
[1:44:20] says this is
[1:44:22] shocking if you really hear it the
[1:44:23] messenger the angel the messenger of
[1:44:26] satan
[1:44:27] to buffet me lest i should be exalted
[1:44:30] above measure so paul prayed three times
[1:44:33] lord take this away from me
[1:44:35] and the lord said no i have something
[1:44:37] better
[1:44:38] whatever this was was a bad thing right
[1:44:41] paul was it was a suffering it was a
[1:44:43] trial
[1:44:44] and he was saying lord deliver me
[1:44:47] and the lord saying no
[1:44:50] actually i am delivering you
[1:44:52] because much worse than this affliction
[1:44:54] in your body
[1:44:57] is the affliction of pride
[1:44:59] that you would get in your own position
[1:45:02] of revelation
[1:45:04] and understanding of the mysteries of
[1:45:06] the word of god
[1:45:07] so this is a better more positive thing
[1:45:10] to have this place of suffering
[1:45:13] than to be than to ruin your life
[1:45:16] because the root of all sin is pride
[1:45:19] so the lord was saying no paul i'm not
[1:45:21] going to allow you go that direction
[1:45:23] i'm not let you get puffed up and
[1:45:25] destroy yourself and others around you
[1:45:28] i'm going to allow this bad thing
[1:45:31] to be in your life to keep you humble
[1:45:37] doesn't the lord love us
[1:45:39] and he says your
[1:45:41] character in eternity is much more
[1:45:44] valued than a temporary deliverance from
[1:45:47] a bodily affliction
[1:45:49] don't say i'm preaching against healing
[1:45:52] i'm not i believe in healing with all my
[1:45:54] heart but sometimes god says no
[1:45:58] do you know that this is what this this
[1:46:00] is
[1:46:01] paul prayed for divine healing in his
[1:46:03] life and god said nope
[1:46:06] you're going to have that the rest of
[1:46:07] your life
[1:46:08] we say oh that's not
[1:46:11] you promised healing i did promise
[1:46:13] healing i almost pro i also promise
[1:46:15] victory
[1:46:16] and because of that i'm allowing this in
[1:46:18] your life
[1:46:20] for this thing i besought the lord
[1:46:21] thrice that it might depart from me and
[1:46:23] he said unto me
[1:46:25] my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:46:29] listen to this
[1:46:31] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:46:34] weakness
[1:46:36] he just said you're strong when you're
[1:46:38] weak
[1:46:40] no it's god's strength in you
[1:46:43] so when you're weak
[1:46:46] when you're afflicted
[1:46:47] when you're suffering
[1:46:50] that's when god's power is the strongest
[1:46:53] in your life
[1:46:54] you say no it's when i'm delivered and
[1:46:55] i'm i've i'm on the top of the pile and
[1:46:57] i'm the
[1:46:58] i'm the best and i'm in the place that
[1:47:00] i've always wanted to be
[1:47:02] no
[1:47:04] no it's in that place of affliction
[1:47:07] in that trial
[1:47:08] in that difficulty god's power is the
[1:47:11] strongest in you
[1:47:13] god's strength
[1:47:15] is perfect
[1:47:16] when we're weak
[1:47:19] most gladly listen to this now he
[1:47:21] changes he prayed lord deliver me this
[1:47:24] is hard this is difficult i i i can't i
[1:47:26] can't do it take it away from me and the
[1:47:28] lord says no my grace is sufficient for
[1:47:31] you
[1:47:33] and he says okay
[1:47:34] i'll change my i've changed my direction
[1:47:37] oh lord thank you for this infirmity
[1:47:39] hallelujah
[1:47:41] i've got this trial in my life lord
[1:47:43] praise god he was dancing he was dancing
[1:47:46] shouting giving god glory
[1:47:48] for his infirmity
[1:47:52] that's the place that we if we want to
[1:47:54] go on the rapture and be mature
[1:47:56] christians
[1:47:58] this is where this is what the lord is
[1:47:59] taking us to
[1:48:01] is to rejoice to glory in our
[1:48:03] infirmities
[1:48:06] why
[1:48:07] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:48:10] you
[1:48:10] you want the power of christ in your
[1:48:12] life there's a price to be paid
[1:48:15] it's not just coming to church and
[1:48:17] yelling
[1:48:19] it's not just coming to church throwing
[1:48:21] your hands up and screaming that's all
[1:48:22] fine
[1:48:23] that's great
[1:48:25] they do that at the ball game too
[1:48:27] that it that's not a christian life
[1:48:31] stop getting that thing in your oh we
[1:48:33] had great meetings well how about we had
[1:48:35] great meetings i died to myself
[1:48:38] i rejoiced in my infirmity
[1:48:41] oh he had a warm fuzzy when
[1:48:44] that guy was singing that song today
[1:48:46] what a good meeting
[1:48:48] okay
[1:48:50] that's good
[1:48:52] but that's not the christian life the
[1:48:54] christian life is at your home at your
[1:48:57] job
[1:48:58] in the midst of suffering a terrible
[1:49:00] trial in the midst of tears and saying
[1:49:02] god
[1:49:03] you're faithful i don't know what's
[1:49:05] happening i don't know why it's i'm
[1:49:06] going through this but you are faithful
[1:49:09] and i believe you and i trust you
[1:49:11] i don't know what's going to happen
[1:49:13] i might lose my life i might i might my
[1:49:16] family member might lose their life i
[1:49:18] might but you
[1:49:20] your power is resting in me right now
[1:49:24] when i don't feel like it how many times
[1:49:26] when you're in the trial and suffering
[1:49:28] you said oh i just feel like the power
[1:49:30] of christ is just flowing through me so
[1:49:32] strong
[1:49:33] sometimes most of the time you don't
[1:49:34] feel anything
[1:49:37] but that's when the power of christ is
[1:49:39] resting upon you
[1:49:42] if we have the right vision
[1:49:44] that's important remember
[1:49:47] paul
[1:49:48] immediately switches from okay i'm not
[1:49:51] going to be healed from this and he says
[1:49:53] i will glory in my infirmities
[1:49:57] that's that's a caveat
[1:49:59] that the power of christ may rest on me
[1:50:03] so
[1:50:04] do you want the power of christ in your
[1:50:06] life
[1:50:09] and start glorying in your infirmities
[1:50:12] in other words you can't do that unless
[1:50:14] the lord changes your attitude
[1:50:16] and your heart about them you're not
[1:50:19] going to achieve that
[1:50:21] by force of will
[1:50:23] because it's contrary to human will
[1:50:31] therefore
[1:50:34] i take pleasure
[1:50:37] in infirmities said
[1:50:39] no human being ever
[1:50:44] but a spirit-filled person
[1:50:46] that surrendered their life to the lord
[1:50:48] says this is my pleasure lord to go
[1:50:50] through this trial and through this
[1:50:52] suffering
[1:50:53] and through this reproach and through
[1:50:55] these necessities and through these
[1:50:57] persecutions and through this distress
[1:50:59] for the sake of christ it's my pleasure
[1:51:02] to do that
[1:51:04] you can't make that up that's not
[1:51:05] fakeable
[1:51:08] that has to be the lord
[1:51:10] for
[1:51:12] get this printed up on a shirt brother
[1:51:14] brad
[1:51:15] for when i'm weak then i'm strong
[1:51:20] uh
[1:51:22] that's god's equations
[1:51:25] the world's equations when you're weak
[1:51:26] you're weak and when you're strong then
[1:51:28] you're strong
[1:51:29] but in god's economy he works his
[1:51:32] equations different
[1:51:34] weakness oh look at the power in that
[1:51:37] weak person
[1:51:39] look at that omnipotent power dwelling
[1:51:42] in the weakness of that person's heart
[1:51:46] they know they're weak
[1:51:47] they know they can't do anything they
[1:51:50] they know that they don't have any power
[1:51:52] that's
[1:51:53] when the strength of the lord
[1:51:55] is in you
[1:51:57] that's a different that's a different
[1:51:58] equation that's a that's a person who
[1:52:01] has their citizenship in heaven
[1:52:03] whose focus is on heavenly things not on
[1:52:06] earthly things
[1:52:09] all right musicians if you'd come
[1:52:14] for our light
[1:52:15] affliction
[1:52:18] which is but for a moment
[1:52:21] worketh for us a far more
[1:52:24] exceeding
[1:52:25] an eternal weight of glory so it's in
[1:52:28] other words it's a momentary
[1:52:30] light
[1:52:31] affliction
[1:52:33] i mean it happened for paul for over a
[1:52:35] long period of time
[1:52:37] but in comparison to eternity
[1:52:39] the things that we go through are
[1:52:41] momentary
[1:52:42] and light
[1:52:45] and it says it worketh for us
[1:52:48] in other words it achieves
[1:52:50] there's an achievement that comes
[1:52:53] from the afflictions that we go through
[1:52:56] for the sake of the gospel
[1:52:59] there's an achievement what is that
[1:53:01] achievement a far more exceeding
[1:53:04] and eternal
[1:53:06] weight of glory far more exceeding is
[1:53:09] repeating the words twice
[1:53:11] and excessively exceeding is what paul
[1:53:14] is saying an excessively exceeding
[1:53:17] eternal weight of glory so the
[1:53:19] affliction is light in other words it's
[1:53:22] it's
[1:53:23] heaviness its weight is light in
[1:53:26] comparison to the weight
[1:53:28] that the glory that god has for us
[1:53:32] so think of it this way every trial
[1:53:36] every affliction
[1:53:38] everything that you go go through every
[1:53:40] suffering that you've gone through in
[1:53:42] your life
[1:53:43] god it's not meaningless it's not
[1:53:45] purposeless
[1:53:47] god has a purpose
[1:53:50] in the midst of it
[1:53:51] it's doing something in eternity
[1:53:55] you say i'm just suffering it's so hard
[1:53:58] i i i can't make it through the lord is
[1:54:00] working out something in your life
[1:54:03] but even better even greater is those
[1:54:06] things you're going through god
[1:54:09] is
[1:54:10] carving out
[1:54:11] that body you know brother branham says
[1:54:13] there's a theophany and these vitamins
[1:54:16] the word is coming i believe this is
[1:54:18] also connected to that our sufferings
[1:54:20] the trials that we have the reward that
[1:54:23] we get
[1:54:25] for eternity
[1:54:26] is directly connected
[1:54:28] to the sufferings and the trials and how
[1:54:31] we go through them
[1:54:34] so we want we want that theophany body
[1:54:37] we have to feed on the word we also have
[1:54:39] to surrender to the will of the lord in
[1:54:41] our life
[1:54:43] that is going to achieve something for
[1:54:45] us
[1:54:47] while we look
[1:54:48] not at the things which are seen
[1:54:51] but the things which are not seen for
[1:54:53] the things which are seen
[1:54:55] are temporal they're temporary but the
[1:54:57] things which are not seen are eternal we
[1:55:00] have to be
[1:55:02] looking at heavenly things
[1:55:04] we have to value what happens in this
[1:55:07] life
[1:55:08] according to that which is from eternity
[1:55:10] right
[1:55:11] if we value what's going on in this life
[1:55:13] and just
[1:55:14] it's just things we go through right now
[1:55:16] and we don't see how it impacts
[1:55:19] the eternal weight of glory we're
[1:55:21] missing it
[1:55:23] and it will negatively impact
[1:55:25] your attitude how in the world can you
[1:55:27] rejoice in infirmities and distresses
[1:55:30] and enjoy rejoice in sufferings and
[1:55:33] trials because you know
[1:55:35] this is light and it's momentary
[1:55:38] there's something that's eternal that
[1:55:40] god is doing through this thing i'm
[1:55:43] going through right now
[1:55:45] and it has great meaning
[1:55:47] amen let's stand
[1:55:53] heavenly father we're so thankful for
[1:55:54] your goodness and your mercy in our
[1:55:56] lives
[1:55:58] lord our desire lord is to be what your
[1:56:00] word says
[1:56:02] we need to be
[1:56:03] lord we want to rejoice
[1:56:06] in suffering we want to
[1:56:08] know that when we're weak then we're
[1:56:10] strong
[1:56:13] we want to we want to have these
[1:56:14] principles lord
