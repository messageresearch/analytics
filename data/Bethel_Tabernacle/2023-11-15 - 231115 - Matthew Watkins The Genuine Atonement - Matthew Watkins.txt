and I did job from about a week and a half ago then they thought he had double pneumonia so the next time I went there he wasn't there he was in the hospital and they turned out that his body was rejecting lungs so then they had to basically take all of his blood out clean it put it all back in two days ago was the fifth they're supposed to do it five days five times and he's feeling great you know I just uh I don't know if he's home yet but he couldn't breathe breathe and so they thought that's why they thought it was neonia so I just want to thank the Lord I've been praying for him and

people my fut my life is worth the living [Music] it's about that time I invite the minister I believe is brother Matt tonight come up and Minister the word I want to sing I was listening to a tape this today recently anyways her um brother brandom came out and they were singing only believe and and I'm sure we've all heard him say this before where he said you know it's the Angel's favorite song and amen you know it stuck with me and I Know It kind of turns into a cliche sometimes but I really want to sing that song and invite the minister out because it means so much to me um I got saved that song and it means a lot to [Music] meall Thank You Lord so I want to sing this as we all stand and invite the minister and you just whatever you have need of friends I don't know and I'm sure the minister doesn't know but the but the Lord knows and that's what we come here for so you you raise your hand and you sing this song and whatever you have need of whatever you're struggling with you pray in your heart you sing this like a prayer and I know the Lord will meet you [Music] tonight [Music] be we be all things [Music] [Applause] [Music] are ohly be all things are [Music] possible all Jesus is here amen [Applause] Jesus is here all things are a Jesus is here Jesus is Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here oh Lord I believe Lord I all things are possible Lord I let's raise our hands now [Music] Lord I believe oh Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord amen amen you love the Lord Jesus amen We Believe tonight tonight amen just want to tell the Lord that it's wonderful to tell him that Lord I believe you're here amen and I receive what you have for me God bless you if you have your Bible turn to the book of Galatians chapter 5 Galatians chapter 5 just read a few verses out of there I'm going to minister to you tonight on the genuine atonement we preached last Wednesday on a true atonement and I'm going to um Minister tonight on the genuine atonement the genuine atonement amen praise the Lord God bless you brother Isaiah amen good to have you here with us Amen in the house of the Lord did you come with a need this evening be honest enough to say that Lord I came with a need inside my heart amen and I'm just expecting to receive from you amen I believe the Lord is just here amen and he's here to meet our needs amen I'm glad for that you know he's here to meet the needs that we don't even know that we have because when the word comes it answers the questions that you didn't even know you had it addresses the problems that you weren't even aware of because the Bible says the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart so when the word Goes Forth it discerns your heart just like in a prayer line that person who'd come up before brother brandom they didn't know what disease they had but through that gift he would identify something they didn't know now the word is the same way how many could just say here tonight Lord discern my heart and if I hear something tonight maybe I wasn't even aware that I needed let me uh let me be a good uh uh believer and say I accept it Lord Jesus amen let's just look at this here in Galatians chapter 5 and let's just begin reading here at verse 13 actually let's let's just begin at verse 14 for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh now it's important to understand as brother bham taught us Paul is speaking to not unconverted people but this is Con this is Christians this is believers and he's saying this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so you mean that after I'm born again I still can walk and fulfill the lusts of the flesh amen right now let's look at what he talks about and what he calls the lust of the flesh let's look at it just a little bit further in verse 17 for the Lust For The Flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit now here's where you have Romans 7 again that when Paul says I have two people inside of me that which wants to do good and then that which that the flesh that I have wars against that Spirit man and so this is the same thing Paul is saying here for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot not do the things that you would Verse 18 but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness oh we thought we got away when we read verse 19 and thought okay I'm not guilty not me let's keep reading can we go a little further idolatry witchcraft remember these are the works of the this is what he calls The Works of the flesh he says idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies he Parks hatred right in with wrath sedition and Witchcraft amen amen envying murders you can murder a man brother bham said what more than just murdering him with a knife you speak against his character amen now that's not just a that's not just a meme that's not just a oh that was poetic that's real you can murder a man more than one way speak against his character that's not just good advice well you better not talk about somebody you you talk about his character brother bam says you assassinate assassinate that man God help us murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have told you in time past they that inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit so we had the works of the flesh now let's read the the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness goodness goodness just being good listen this is a fruit of the spirit Faith meekness Temperance that means self-control against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also how many can raise a hand and say help me Lord to walk in the spirit Lord Jesus we just bow our heads before for you so mindful Lord God of how real your word is Lord to us to each and every single person Lord that's here tonight I as I just ask God as I stand with them may we just remove ourself Lord from the equation here tonight father let us not become a hindrance let us not become a uh Lord a father anything that would prevent your word from going forth I pray you'd help us to move all out of the way Lord both hearer and speaker tonight tonight May the Holy Spirit come now Lord and take control of my vessel Lord I pray that you'd help me God to communicate the burden that you've placed upon my heart in a way that would be effective Lord to your children we ask it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated tonight and I have some slid some quotes there brother if you'd go ahead and put that up I'm going to just read some quotes here and I I just want to pick up sort of from where we were where we left off uh last Wednesday and I trust that that was a blessing to you and that the Lord uh can just continue to speak that uh here tonight and I'm going to minister to you on the genuine atonement I want to show you from where I got this title and if you weren't aware if you didn't catch it from the last time it's from the message the Feast of trumpets and brother Barham says here here and we took time to show uh this and I I won't I'll just cover some of this just here briefly as it's relevant to my thought but in Revelations 11 their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elijah calling to Israel out of the Jewish Traditions just as the seventh Angel's message called The Bride out of the Pentecostal Traditions now we showed you last Wednesday how that brother brandham teaches this in the Feast of the trumpet and you could also pick this up in the Sixth Seal and brother brandham really after the Sixth Seal really lays this in here real strong because at the time he preaches the six trumpet he doesn't have six seal I'm sorry he doesn't have the revelation of the trumpets yet and and even the the night before he ministers the Feast of the trumpets he still doesn't have the Revelation and he's in his room and and he comes to his wife and says honey I would have got made a terrible mistake I was going to preach this and I had it wrong and so the Lord the Lord reveals something to him just like he did in the seals when before each seal brother Bram at the end of a seal would say now I don't have a clue what the third seal is but the same way that the angel of the Lord came in the room this afternoon and gave me the revelation of the second seal he'll come and give me the revelation of the third seal friends I I believe that the Lord did that in that way to show you that this wasn't the mind of a man it was the it was the thoughts and the mind of Christ and so so brother Bron begins to show this here that Al how under that sick seal how the the and then when he comes to the Feast of the trumpets brother Bron begins to show us how that just as the seals were to the Gentiles the trumpets would be to the Jews you remember that from last Wednesday and how brother bham showed that all of those trumpets sounded under the tribulation seal how that it was a a the sick seal was the tribulation seal I want to take just a moment just to slow down because we went through some of that quickly and I and I just don't want it to get lost uh and I also don't want to get bogged down in teaching as we've got a lot and I don't want to um uh um set a personal record tonight with a Wednesday night service um as I did last Wednesday I want to beat my record from last Wednesday if you pull on the word you'll help me get to the Finish Line a lot quicker and so uh but so notice this here but the prophet of God shows how that and he and he answers this out of Revelations uh chapter 9 you don't have to turn but I'm just going to quote it here because the prophet typed this six seal with these uh with the tribulation seal and how that these four Angels were holding back uh let's just read it here in ver in chapter nine and if you can uh turn there quickly you can read it with me if not just listen and the the Bi Bible says in Revelations 9:13 and the Four Angels were loosed with which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men uh and the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000,000 and I heard the number of them and thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and he goes all the way through this for the power for their power is in their mouth and in their tails and he goes to the very end neither they repented neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication uh nor of their thefts and so the prophet takes time to show how that anytime you're looking at the seals and this will just be helpful to you as it was to me in understanding how the prophet could say that all of the trumpets sounded under the six seal and but yet we know that the tribulation period is the six seal this is easy not complicated and so we know that that tribulation seal would have a physical Happ happening chronologically in time that hasn't happened yet thank God but yet we know that the prophet said that there was also a spiritual happening something that happened spiritually when the seal broke there was a spiritual something that took place and he would go further and say that those thousand uh thousand times thousands uh uh uh uh 200 let me read it 200,000,000 horses that were held in Revelations 9 at the river Euphrates the prophet of God said were released spiritually politically and religiously this is simple I'm not getting deep and complicated here it's real real real real simple here just but it's important to understand because then when that breaks forth you'll get the Revelation it'll make everything make sense to you to understand that the seventh seal being the coming of the Lord is an actual event that hasn't hasn't the the the physical part of that seventh seal of the physical coming of the Lord Jesus has not yet taken place but yet we know that there's a spiritual application to that a revelation uh to that mystery that was been that's been given to God's elected to show us that just as there was a spiritual uh a spirit that was released under the six seal that's why brother brandham would say that that spirit that was released at the on these uh Chargers the river Euphrates he said that Spirit went into the atmosphere and It Came Upon men like Stalin and Hitler and musolini and that was a six seal pre-tribulation Spirit of persec if you want to know what the tribulation coming in the six seal just look at what happened when the spiritual breaking forth came came came forth it was a persecution naturally against the Jews to put them back in their Homeland right and so so brother bandam says that there these were angel this was something that happened these were Angels so there's there's something that takes place under the breaking of the of those seals that released an Angelic Ministry amen now remember a demon is an angel it's just a fallen angel and so everything that would happen under that Angelic release that came into the atmosphere whether it was a a demon Spirit under a fallen angel or an angel that would be released uh into the atmosphere that was a good Angel brother Brandon would go even further and say you've got an angel when you're born and you breathe your first breath there's an angel given to your life that guards you that protects you that leads you to an altar and encourages you and and and and listen friends I'm just preaching to what brother brandham T taught us and so we know that though as we taught last last Wednesday that those spirits that would come into the under that seal would be released into the atmosphere that is why the world is falling apart that's why we can't be like a boy whistling through a graveyard and just think that have time we just continue to go on and on and on Friends listen some of these things you're reading about in the news every single day I truly believe that it's just the Fulfillment of Prophecy and the fire's about to fall it ought to it ought to do something to us as children of God it ought not just to desensitize us but when we hear about things happening in Israel it ought to wake us up and and let us realize that Israel is God's time piece that what's happening over there in Israel God's God God's watch you want to know where your God's at in time brother bam said watch Israel look at what's taking place and look at what is taking place the world has gone completely insane and they don't realize they're under an anointing oh yeah amen and brother bam says that what happens we all know this you could we could sum summarize uh all of this and and and and in a summary you'd miss a lot of the details but in a summary we we we in a summary we know that just as two prophets are to appear in Revelations 11 to Mo uh Moses and Elijah's brother B I'm just now we just now read it here you say what's happening next uh in Prophecy under a prophet to the Jews what's happening next is God's is going to send them the uh the the prophets of Moses and Elijah to turn their hearts back to the faith of the fathers right to the faith of the children this is the Fulfillment of Malachi chapter 4 amen amen now only one part of that one part of that is to you and one part of that's to the Jews and the same that why do you think brother brandham had a Ministry that was like it unto Moses but he also had a Ministry liken under Elijah because it would be a prophetic Ministry of Mo I hope you catch it tonight friends the same message that youve received that turn your hearts back is the same message that the Jew will hear and it will turn their heart back to a genuine atonement and the prophet said just as Moses and Elijah will turn the hearts of those Jews away from traditions and dead sacrifice to the genuine atonement then what ought the seventh Angel's message do to the Gentile Church it ought to turn our hearts back to a genuine atonement Hallelujah and further than that he opened his Bible and that the the but it wasn't just Moses and Elijah Don't let me stopped there it was also the Joshua commission am as I was with Moses so shall I be unto so shall I be to you this was the ministry I hope that that's understandable this was the ministry that we've received listen now listen with that in mind now you'll understand where he's at in Revelations 11 when he's quoting in Feast of the trumpets in Revelations 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elijah calling to Israel out of the remember what he does to the Jews he first does to the Gentiles amen so he says he says out of the Jewish Traditions just as the seventh Angel's message called The Bride out of the Pentecostal tradition amen remember Moses and Elijah to call Israel out of the old atonement now type this here if you're spiritual at all if you study the message at all you you're you're type so start going off like crazy because brother brandham is going to type how he called them out of an old atonement or an old system just the same exact way he calls the bride out of Pentecostal systems or old atonement amen right he says out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the Real Living Sacrifice to the word I love this and the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything the same seal is to what call the people how many of the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word amen Christ listen let's go further impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us amen so what was that son of man Ministry to do to bring the bride out of the old atonement into the genuine atonement Christ in impersonated in his word here amen now what does brother bandam say my our pastor just read it I think Sunday when he quoted out of the trial and brother brandom says I challenge you to see the son of man the word made flesh revealed in the prophet's body that's not what he said in the bride's body you see many people can see the son of man Ministry in a prophet some people can't some people can go as afar as to see what that sign of the son of man was when he was impersonated in the ministry of God's Prophet but can you go a little bit further and realize that that same impersonation of the ministry of Christ and a prophet would have to be Revelations 10:7 and 8 thou must prophesy again so the word has to be impersonated in the bride amen and you've got to be a willing vessel to say Lord can I have enough Faith to believe in the son of godl can I have enough Faith to believe that the Son of God was the word made flesh he was deity in a human body can we have faith to believe that can we have faith to believe that in our generation we had a prophet of God stand behind a pull pit showing the sign of the son of man fulfilling rep fulfilling Luke 17 can we go that far now can we go a little bit further and realize that the same sign of the word made flesh wasn't going to stop at Jesus it wasn't going to stop at Paul it wasn't going to stop at brother brandom it would move all the way down into maturity of all of the seed of God to where Christ is impersonated his nature his life his love his acts amen would be identified in the bride of Jesus Christ those in the bride will do the very Works Jesus did that's a direct quote from brother brandham now do you believe that amen those in the bride will do the very works that Jesus did they would have his life now let me get to my thought here to a genuine atonement they would turn them notice to the genuine atonement Christ impersonated in his word made flesh Among Us science has proved it that's why the trial message you go a little bit further and brother random says not a nail scarred Jesus we don't look for a nail scarred Jesus that's the old atonement now don't let that choke you that's not to say that that there wasn't a nail scarred Jesus that's not to say that Calvary is is NL and void and done away with no friends but Calvary was facilitating the spirit that would come back on the church at the day of Pentecost amen but brother says not it we don't as the bride we don't look for a nail scarred hands or a crown of thorns we look for the word made flesh amen amen they miss it they miss it the world misses it listen that's only to a select group of people and you can't convince someone of it because you couldn't be convinced of that you see God God was going to give his church the God's going to give his the bride a weapon and it wasn't going to be intellect amen amen and it wasn't going to be some speaking in tongues emotion that's wonderful but what it wasn't going to be intellect and it wasn't going to be a gift of the spirit it was going to be a power of Revelation that the gates of hell can't Prevail against it you see the gates of hell can Prevail against a gift of the spirit it can Prevail against a human intellect but when Revelation drops in your heart it's an anchor that even when you can't explain it or you don't understand it yourself you still believe it and you still accept it because that's the power of Revelation that only God's family has amen and he notice he says this here he says here let me follow it here on mine also and he says to the genuine atonement uh the genuine atonement there's my sermon title Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us science has proved it by pictures and so we know that I'm just going to take just a moment here I'm already almost out of time my goodness gracious thank you I will notice so so even even this brother Brandon begins to tell us that the Mysteries that were the the revelations 10:7 when the seventh angel begins to sound then all the mysteries of God would be finished now the prophet uh inur as this the time he begins to tell he even quotes from the SC Scofield bible and he says now notice what are these Mysteries that are to be given back to the church what are some of these Mysteries and brother Ron begins to quote right from his notes he said you want to read it right out of your scofi Bible and he begins to quote the Mysteries that SC scoffield is is is saying brother begins to read them off the mystery of the atonement The Mystery of the of of of baptism the the the mystery of the church The Mystery of the and then brother bman search after all of those and he says and may I say this The Mystery of the serpent seed the mystery of true water baptism in Jesus name the mystery of the nature of godliness that God is not three uh he's not one like your fingers one but but he's the same God in three offices three manifestations right and brother Brandon begins to say had the mystery of iniquity and so we know that the world is living under this even the Apostle Paul uh begins to to to to tell us this and he begins to prophesy that in the last days there would be a great Fallen of away a great Falling Away we know this in our Bible he warns us that that the spirit of antichrist would come in and take over men's Hearts is this good is this this is real basic here and so we notice that that that uh that this is right in your Bible it talks about the man of sin it talks about the son of predition and so you know people have have have so just as we read out of the trumpets people can so literalize things and put it off somewhere down the road and they miss the spiritual application that's happening right now just like to believe that the that the six seal is just the tribulation period after the bride is gone is to miss the Revelation that at the breaking of that seal there was a spirit that came in into the Earth amen and so so um let me just stop here for a minute in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 8 we'll come back to that the Bible says that the man of sin let's just look at it second 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 you can follow me if you want quickly brother Josh if you're fast um on the draw there you can follow me if not don't don't don't uh don't even worry about it I'll just go through these some just quickly and so the Bible says that there's a man of sin how many believe that and so we could look at that literally and we could say there's the man of sin the the the this the uh the son of predition and those are you say is that going to be a real person let's not look at just the literal uh fact of that but let's look at the spiritual application of that we do know there will be literally be a real person right the false prophet right and so we know that in the tribulation after the church is gone there will be a real man of sin there will be the Antichrist how many believe that Christ is real how many believe that there's an actual Jesus Christ the the person the perfect lamb the Spotless sinless sacrifice my savior is a real living person he's not a figment of your imagination he's not just a feeling that you feel in the air but there's a real Jesus right uh who who sits on the throne as a perfect sacrifice interceding for your sins on behalf of your sins but just as I believe that there's a real physical Jesus I also believe that there's a spirit of Christ that lives in my heart that lives in your heart that I can feel that I can sense amen I I preach the we we we believe that we we can feel the spirit of Christ how many here believes we can have the spirit of Christ and so if we believe there's a physical Christ but yet there's the spirit of Jesus that lives in us then there must also of necessity be a real Antichrist and a spirit of antichrist that can indwell people's hearts is that simple enough and so just as the spirit of Christ enters the true church the spirit of antichrist enters the false Church in fact that's why brother Bram said that the false Church always persecuted the true church right and so the Bible says in second Thessalonians 2:8 whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so there is an antichrist amen amen and there's also a spirit of antichrist who exists now yeah hello I'm just going to say it again there's a real savior who lives in glory right now exists he's a living person he's real just as real and even though he's God uh and we're here on Earth his Spirit dwells within us amen and because you are Sons we know Galatians 4:6 because you are son so he has sent the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry Abba Father so I'm just taking just a moment here to show you very clearly that if you believe that then you ought not to stumble on the fact of the same way that a real Spirit of Christ could dwell inside people and could anoint people then so the spirit of the Antichrist can also anoint men's Hearts amen and so we we we we see that clearly and the Bible says that there's a spirit of Christ at work in the body of Christ yes amen do you believe that the spirit of Christ is at work in the world so also we must also believe that the spirit of antichrist is at work in the world Amen and what is the spirit of Christ doing it is preparing our hearts to receive the person of Christ I said what is the spirit of Christ at work doing he's molding your character he's molding your nature he's convicting you of sin that's why you can't get away with it that's why you can't get away from it listen you would have walked away from this thing a long time ago but there's the spirit of Christ that won't let you get away with it he won't let you get away from it oh I'm so glad that there's an there's an advocate I have an intercessor with the father who fights for me who prays for me Hallelujah and so what is the spirit of Christ now doing in God's en his body he's preparing his family to receive him amen and if you can't receive his word now you can't receive him then I said those that can't receive his word now can't receive him oh I would have if I was in the days of Jesus I would have stood up for him I I I would have stood against those Romans soldiers I would have stood against Judas I would I would have been one of those listen brother brandom says hold on a minute you want to know what you would have done then what are you doing right now with the word for your day what is the word for our day the message of the hour I'll just make it plain if you can't receive the message of your hour you can't receive Christ because Christ is his word you know what that ought to do that ought to make you so happy that you can say I'm so glad I can accept the message of the hour because I can accept the message that means I can accept Christ and so if you can't accept the me if you can't accept Christ here now you want to accept him then so if there's a spirit of Christ at work then we must also say that there's a spirit of the Antichrist at work amen right if there's a spirit of Christ possessing his family then what do you think's possessing the Antichrist family now those Antichrist family we know who they are brother mat but the the the family of the Antichrist is those you know hard heathens with you know hard a you know heavy metal death metal no then it's Voodoo Witchcraft and witches and and all kinds of wiah and Ouija boards no no no no no no no you see this the family of Satan the family of the Antichrist is just as religious as Abel was and just as there's a spirit just as there's a spirit and Ministry and word that goes forth from the true Christ there's also a Ministry that anoints there's a spirit of antichrist that anoints a false Ministry to deceive people yes that's why brother bandom said they'd go to church thinking they're worshiping God and they're worshiping the devil and they don't know it amen so there's a spirit of antichrist at work and you say brother Matt what is that Spirit doing just as the spirit of Christ is doing the Antichrist through his ministry through his music through his anointing through his word through social platforms political platforms relig just platforms he is preparing the hearts of his people to receive him that's why you look at the Bible and you go how in the world in the tribul how are they going to accept this false prophet how are because their hearts are being prepared to receive him now I said their hearts he's preparing their hearts to receive him now 1 John 4:3 very familiar scripture this 1 John 4 chapter 4 1 John chapter 4:3 this is that Spirit of antichrist now hold on brother Matt the Antichrist now hold on hold on don't confuse me because the Antichrist that's in the tribulation period it is but don't miss what's happening now right amen and every Spirit notice that confesses Christ has come in the and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come amen and even now already is in the world Amen so there's a coming yeah there's a happening coming but then don't miss what's happening right now oh friends I hope you're I hope you can catch it tonight there's a coming of the Lord that's going to take place but there's a coming of the Lord happening right now there's a jubilee that's going to sound one day but there's a jubilee in my heart that's already sounded I'm going to shout there but I'm going to shout here I'm going to worship there but I'm going to worship here there's something coming physically but there's something spiritually that takes place first Hallelujah you love him and so so let me just say it this way he says you have heard about the coming it's been preached it's been a taught you're expecting his arrival but I want you to wake up to something that spirit is already at work right now amen he's not going to suddenly appear on the scene and burst out of somewhere and then overwhelm everybody it's not what's going to happen but rather his spirit is mysteriously at work now setting his Kingdom up now amen in the hearts of people that claim to be Christians amen amen now let me just I I'm just right here in the word I'm not not not way off in left field so you can amen this this is not Al in leftfield he's setting up his kingdom now in the hearts of people that will accept him through a dry-eyed confession that's the spirit of antichrist amen he's setting up his kingdom now in coldness and indifference he's working in the hearts of people that's where hatred comes from that's where wrath comes from that's where Envy comes from that's where jealousy comes from that doesn't come from the holy spirit that comes from an evil spirit I ought to get a really loud amen and so so he's he's he he you say brother Matt where is the spirit of anti Christ at work now it's at work in coldness it's at work in compromise come on somebody help me preach it's at work when people compromise the word amen and when he finally when the man of sin finally appears and is revealed to the world he'll be revealed to a world that's already prepared to receive him this is where you see anti-Semitism come from this is where you see racism come from this is where are you name any Spirit you want to name it came from the pits of hell and it's been exacerbated from the six seal pre-tribulation anointing that comes upon the world that's what you're living in right now friends Paul warned of this he says in cians 2: 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity this is second 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work amen it's already working yeah only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way now brother bham picks this up in Daniel 70 weeks and says who is that who is he who now lth will let prophet of God says that's the Holy Ghost but where is the Holy Ghost Inside of his family amen so what do you think's going to happen when God's family do you realize that the heart of a fervent believer is is what's holding back the wrath of God from the earth friends I don't know if we realize how different we are than most people right amen I don't think we realize sometimes how different we are than most people amen how the littlest things in your life that might seem so minuscule to other people yet they're so large to us oh yes amen and if you ever told someone some of the things that you grieve over I'm not talking about major heinous sins I'm talking about things in your personality things in your character the littlest things that some people would look at and go come on give me a break we're all human yet God won't let you say thaten God won't let you settle and just resign to the fact that you're just going to have a temper CU you're human and that's just part of your Fallen nature do you realize how different you are because the Holy Ghost is inside you and fervent see that's that's not your righteousness that's the righteousness of God whereas the rest of the world look at those things and think come on man big deal you're really stressing over a little bit of alcohol a little social drink on a plane right home come on little just a little bit of alcohol you're going to make a big deal not getting drunk man just having a little but to you right amen that would destroy you well that must mean that I guess brother I guess that means I'm a good person oh no you missed it there's only one thing that makes you that way and it's not has anything to do with you it has to do with the Holy Ghost that's inside of your heart that won't let you get away with it the Bible says he convicts us of sin hello notice what brother bandam says here about the church and he says here in our PowerPoint if you you could just display that again just for a moment uh he says that about about the church notice this here uh he says he says in this let me let me go past this the church this is why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life amen notice what brother rham says here the church needs a baptism the church doesn't need a polishing up a better scholar in the pull pit a better Dressed Man a better dressed congregation it needs a new heart amen that's what the church needs it needs the Holy Spirit Hallelujah hello and he says that's what the church needs it needs a new heart it needs the Holy Spirit it needs that great unction to make a shout that great unction to make us dance and have joy unspeakable it needs that's what the church needs now more than ever before we need to have an emotional frenzy where everybody's jumping and screaming and hollering and shouting hey I'm all for it sign me up amen but I'm going to tell you what brother brandom says the church needs it needs that great unction that changes men and women's lives amen listen I'm for jumping shouting dancing screaming we ought to have more of it amen but at the end of all of your jumping and dancing and screaming if your life isn't changed to back to the genuine atonement amen amen hello he says it needs that great unction that changes I love this that changes men and women's lives amen how God promised that he would take the old Stony heart now listen to this how he would take the old Stony heart says Ezekiel 36 you know the scripture very well I'll take out the Heart of Stone this was the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost do we realize that this is one of the main themes of what the Holy Ghost was to bring was it going to bring outing sure was the Holy Ghost when it poured out upon our flesh was they going to speak in tongues and prophesy sure but don't leave off the main thing the main thing is that it would change people's lives I'll will give you a new heart and then he says and I'll take out take away the Stony heart and I I will give you a heart of Flesh and then he says and I will give you a new heart and my spirit will I pour into you Hallelujah God promised he take the old Stony heart so you mean brother Matt that as a Believer I don't have to live with my old Stony heartall no you don't brother then when this happens a change has been made Call Me Crazy but I cannot get away from this word change amen I can't get away from it last last week the Lord's just been my goodness every time it comes over me I just to be honest with you I I weep and cry anguish you say brother Matt why what is that because I realize how far away how far I am from the promise I see my own life and my own heart and my own nature and I realized that the nature of the token that the the promise of the token is the life of the Lamb comes back on the worshipper and I just sit there and weep and grieve and say God change me Lord I need it so bad it changes men that's why that quote last Wednesday meant so much to me when brother brandom says I don't want that in my life amen how God promised when that happens a change has been made let's go a little bit further and he says now in preaching these things even to the Pentecostal people uhoh and we have very little to brag about for in where we have tried to have a Pentecostal free move of God we have become to a place of a bunch of colonized Cults I wonder if this could be said about message people oh yeah amen and he says we don't have much to brag about in the Pentecostal group we have become to a place of a bunch of colonized Cults just a place of confusion and Discord what ought to happen here this afternoon there should be every Pentecostal Church in the city jammed into some big Stadium out here somewhere and if it wasn't for little petty indifferences among never would have believed it the ministers and notice when it gets on the ministers it gets on the people it would be that way amongst a lot of people this is then that is that was why is that so many Christians find it so hard to live at a real Christian Life this is enticing Spirits amongst a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth but the matter you preaching against emotions let me be on the record before I get labeled and cancelled I'm not not against emotion amen right you want your voice to be heard online give me a hearty amen this church is not against emotion amen notice we're not against emotion I went too far again and he says but amongst a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth there becomes paddling and back bitings and all kinds of little character flaws little things that God will wink at at the end of it all he'll wink at it and you'll still go in the Rapture anyway it's amazing how we categorize sin yeah but to God it's all either sin it's either unbelief or belief all kinds of ungodly things listen to this brother that sulfuric acid in the church what is tattling and back bitings amen I I'll say it further it's sulfuric acid in your family it's sulfuric acid in our marriage it's sulfuric acid in our hearts amen and he goes further and says it's demon power amen Spirit of men and women who get among one another and try to push off and say this is not right and this is not right and that's not right if you chase it down nine times out of 10 it's the very person making the stir that's not right amen God hates Discord among Brethren amen God hates Discord among Brethren God you know sort of doesn't like it so much he you know he it's less than preferable is that what he said no no no no I'm just reading you right out of the message of the hour that you say you believe amen God hates Discord one of the seven things he hates brother B's only quoting the scripture here be reverent be holy love God stand by him and as long as you know your life is diving up with the Bible with purity of heart purity of thought love toward your brother amen trying your best to upbuild the kingdom of God and doing those things but you know what the problem is sometimes we just we excuse our tattling and back bitings with well it's just righteous indignation hello somebody can I preach here tonight well I'm just defending the faith well I'm just standing up for Jesus well that's funny when when Peter thought that way he took a sword and he cut a man's ear off and Jesus rebuked him and said put away your sword Peter amen amen my goodness it got quiet in here love towards your brother trying your best how many are trying their best to build the kingdom of God and doing those things dressing right oh my goodness people can camp down on this one and I'm all four we ought to dress right but listen friends if we don't love right what good does it do is to dress right I said if we don't love right all you ought to say Amen if you don't love right your dress ain't got a thing doesn't mean that to God you have a skirt down to the floor dragging the floor hair dragging the floor men I don't care how holy our lives are if we don't love our brother it doesn't do us one bit of good you can have all talking right dressing right living right talking right going right places then you can have all the emotions you want to have and everybody will believe it what an amazing title where I think Pentecost failed good sermon you ought to go listen to it oh and all kinds of things and fussing and drawing barriers and things brother Matt get back to the seals get back to those trumpets just Rapture me into the etheral listen friends I'm only pointing you back to the genuine atonement this is the genuine atonement you want to know what the seals were to produce this am amen notice fussing and drawing barriers and things that's the reason the church is not going on it's true if you'd ever break down your walls let this one be this and that one be that whatever you are doesn't matter but when you can put your hands in your brother's hands and call him your brother amen and we're working for one cause yes that's the kingdom of God if it ever gets to a place that I couldn't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm backslid Amen brother Luther I'm glad you agree come on friends I know this is heavy but it's you ought to be you ought you ought to just reach out and grab that and say God if I ever get to the place to where I can't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and call him my brother then I ought to feel that I'm backslid amen I be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that I had Envy in my heart against any brother no matter who he is that's trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life remember the title where I think Pentecost failed Christians now this is what this is here I'm just going to read these and and then we're done with these quotes Christians you must have a personal relationship to God how many believe that in order to be a Son of God you must become relation to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only one thing that will produce that that's the new birth not shaking a preacher's hand not being a Son of a Preacher not growing up in a message church I don't care what it is there's only one thing that makes you a Son of God that's to be born again by the spirit of God which comes only through repentance of sins amen amen and he says there's only one thing that'll produce that that's the new birth the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God is that right Sons and Daughters then when this takes place then when men here's the question I want to get to you the man says what do we do then after we've been born again good question what do we do I've got born again now what do we do brother brandham so many asked me that question what should I do then brother brandham if you're born again notice your entire nature is changed he didn't leave off anything right your entire nature is changed well if I've got a personality and I'm just an independent person and that's just my personality surely the Holy Ghost doesn't take that away oh well if you're coming back to the genuine atonement amen it doesn't leave anything off and there's no excuses for any part of our nature our personality listen what is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you can put an amen and punctuate every word with an Amen brother bam says your entire Nature has changed you are dead to the things you once thought notice is the message is your life worthy of the Gospel what a what a what a sermon is your life is my life worthy of the Gospel why you say brother brandham when I joined church I got that well then God said Jesus Christ is him yesterday today and forever he still heals the sick he still shows Visions what brother Brandon my church now you're not born again right notice what he does he points to right when he quotes the word and then they stumble and they they they can't accept that brother B says that's proof you're not born again yeah if you can accept the entirety if you can't accept the word of God it proves you're not born of the spirit of God because the this is listen friends brother Brandon would take this he would take this this uh question what is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he would answer it over I could feel I could read before you tonight and be here till Sunday reading quote after quote after quote where the prophet of God clearly starts always stands between two things and he says at first I believe the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost was love sounded good yeah that's what he said he said sounded good truly must be the fruits of the spirit if it's not love brother B said sounded good but it wasn't love and he said because I've seen Christian Science and he said I've seen men that could have love more more human love than any Christian could ever have brother B says then what is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost well it must be the fruits of the spirit now the fruits of the spirit is important love is important all of these things that brother brandham says are not the evidence doesn't make them less than essential don't take something brother and that's not the evidence and well it must mean we don't even need it Sho get to the side I don't even need you no he's only saying it's not the evidence I don't brother brother B even in one place says I'm not saying it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says I'm simply he says I'm not saying it's not the evidence of the manifestation of the Holy Ghost I'm only saying it's not the evidence that the person has the Holy Ghost this is important I'm going to slow down here for a minute because I believe it's so essential that we get that we get this clearly established in in especially our young people's hearts what does it mean what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost brother R say he says it can't be it can't be the fruits of the spirit because Christian Science can produce that better than anybody but does that mean we don't need the fruits of the spirit I'm telling you what I've watched a lot of people do they have emphasized on one thing only to deemphasize another thing that's right and anytime we're doing that we're in danger of not of losing our Full Gospel title amen cuz when you are Full Gospel you don't deemphasize or overemphasize anything it's all the word of God brother Adam says it's not the fruits of the spirit but that doesn't mean we don't need the fruits of the spirit and he says notice if the very God his life is in you the life of your father did the very life of God is in you the very spirit that was in Christ is in you how can the spirit live in Jesus Christ and write this and then come back down in you and deny this so he would answer that question over and over and over and over again the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to punctuate every word with an amen and brother bam would say because watch then is it brother bham do you believe that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is this is the is the ability to speak in tongues brother brandom says as he's argued with the uh the the Pentecostal church over now brother bham stops in questions and answers in 1964 and he's asked that exact question brother bham do you believe that a person and the way they ask this is they ask it something to the effect of brother bam can a person have the Holy Ghost and not have an experience when it happens now brother Brandon before he starts to answer that question he knows what the thought is behind the motivation of that question is cuz in another place he answers that question he answers it very differently and he says no that you've got to have the experience when it happens and it gives the experience of the candle how can you have a candle you got the wick you got the Tallow you got everything but until the fire lights it the candle's not lit and he says you've to have the Holy Ghost you've got to have the experience when it happens you know the quote right amen but this time he when he's asked the when he's asked the question he knows the person and the way they're asking so he starts off by saying now now I love the Pentecostal people and he says now I was I'm Iden and Brother Band even says I'm identified with that group of holy rollers and he says but watch the way he separates that that Pentecostal denomination and those people and that system with the Pentecostal experience don't ever throw out the Pentecostal experience with the Pentecostal denomination because when you throw out the Pentecostal experience you've thrown out the Bible amen remember brother Brandon would say over and over again Pentecost is not a denomination it's an experience and so so he says he says now I love those Pentecostal people and he says you know often times he says out of any denomination and he says I've harped against the Baptist and against the Methodist he said because you know it's really hard to those intellectual dryad intellectuals he and brother bandam says it's always if in other words if you really read the quote what he's really saying is the if I had to choose one it'd be Pentecostal denomination that's what he says he says if I had to choose one of them I certainly wouldn't choose no Baptist I wouldn't choose no Methodist I wouldn't choose Catholicism and he says if I now they're all wrong he didn't stand for any denomination but he said out of any of them that I would stand for the least how do you say that the the least bad the lesser of two evils he says is that Pentecostal denomination and then he starts to answer the question and he says now in the evidence of the B of of the speaking in tongues he says I've differed with them because they've tried to put the initial evidence of the of of the Holy Ghost in speaking in tongues now you say brother brandom brother Bram says now I've differed with him that's not the evidence that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost prophet of God says this 1964 he says oh no no I would I wish every member of my church spoke in tongues and I believe that if you would pray and ask God you'd speak in tongues now that's 1964 don't look at me like a deer in the head light I I'll get you the quote after the service if you want it brother Brandon begins to go a little bit further than that you watch him the way he answers this question over and over and over and over again uh he answers he answers it this way and he always goes back to how would he points to to to the Book of John chapter 14 and he shows how that when the spirit of truth comes he'll lead and guide you into all truth he'll show you things to come brother bandam says and he always points back and says how could the word of God be dwelling in you deny his own word so then the evidence of the Holy Ghost would be able to punctuate every [Applause] word every word every word do we realize what every word means well then every word means if they can punctuate every word then that that just that then then we've got to believe in healing we've got we got to believe in shouting we've got to believe in dancing we got to believe in speaking in tongues and I'm believing all the word I'm with you but can can you go a little bit further come on brother brandom says I could ask a question to this audience tonight and say how many of you here have the Holy Ghost and he says I guarantee you 90 I think he says 99% of everybody would raise a hand and say well I've got it brother bandam and he says but I could quote you one scripture if you say you believe every word I could quote to you one scripture and he says I guarantee you not even three hands would go up in the building you know what scripture he quotes blessed are the he marks those who sigh and cry for the Abominations done in their City brother R says how many of you now that's every word that's the words of Jesus come on I thought we believed every word he who has the Holy Ghost shouts he he might shout dance he might dance speak in tongues he might speak in tongues but he might not but here's what brother said he will have he will have the fruits of the spirit in his life now the fruits of the spirit are not an Evidence of the Holy Ghost but you better have them in fact I'll say it this way it's an Evidence you don't have it brother Brandon would even say that about accepting the word for your hour and he says what what does it prove when you can't accept the word for your day and its message it proves you don't have the Holy Ghost right Amen brother bam quotes that scripture blessed are they the and cry brother sister now what is that that scripture could you punctuate that scripture with an amen where every night of your life you lay in your bed and you cry and can't sleep because you're crying sighing and crying over the lost and the dying in the world Amen now if you got the Holy Ghost brother Bram says that's an Evidence when you sigh and cry over the Abominations done and he brings it further and he brings it down to your life and he says when you mess up or misstep on the word of God do you sigh and cry over the Abominations done in your city so he would answer this over and over and over brother brandom I've been baptized in Jesus name the word says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost does this mean that does this mean the baptism the Holy Spirit or does it mean that I receive the gift I should receive a definite experience with baptism I'm anxious to be filled with the spirit now there's a good question now the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience that a person must receive now when I speak of not believing the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues I do not accept that I believe with God's help I could prove it in the Bible if that's wrong because the speaking of in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians for right how many knows that Divine Healing is a gift of the Holy Ghost now that's no evidence of the Holy Ghost you can't rely upon that you can't rely upon the fruit of the spirit because the fruit of the spirit is love and the Christian Science exercise more love than anybody I know of and they deny Jesus Christ being Divine amen see there's only one evidence of the holy spirit that I know of and that is a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour so see those priests were gentle they were Meek understanding men when it come to the fruits of the spirit they could show more fruit of the spirit than Jesus ever could but they failed to see that he was the promised word of the hour amen I could I could read you my goodness I could read you 40 of these but let's let's just read this last one and we'll close and is your life worthy because people say well brother brandham didn't really believe in the fruits of the spirit after the seals after 1963 let's read is your life worthy of the Gospel I guess this was uh uh I guess this sermon doesn't mean anything I had a brother tell me that let's listen to what brother bandham says brother BR in my church now you're not born again you can't be we've already read this come back down and and deny that you can't do it a punk sh then if you say well I'm a good member of the church that don't have one thing to do with it I know the Heathen Down in Africa amongst my dark Brethren down there I find the morals of them people higher than 90% of the American people it goes on further you could read that quote but he says when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything God says in his word is for you to do and everything that's in the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it Hallelujah that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit yes amen you say brother Bram says you say will I speak with tongues you might do that and you might not will I shout you might do that you might not amen but there's one things sure you will do you will bear the fruit of the spirit amen amen and the Fruit of the Spirit say him with me it's love joy come on say it together peace Faith longsuffering meekness gentleness patience your temper will not be ooh just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you amen amen now this is just what the Lord placed upon my heart I'm not preaching at you now I'm preaching at brother Matt brother bam says when you get that Spirit on you that poisons the holy you mean I can poison the holy ghost out of my life Ephesians 4 remember what we read grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption but you can grieve him out of your life amen amen and he says that poisons the holy spirit away from you when you get to a place that you want to fuss with everybody you come along there's something wrong but but but but but but but but brother random I I spoke in tongues I shouted I I danced I felt the an unction of the Holy Ghost I believe the message with all of my heart brother bham says there's something wrong let it be a diagnosis to her heart there's something wrong when you get to a place where a minister will read from the Bible that it's wrong to do a certain thing and you just remember brother Ram says and he and he says this is and you'll you'll you know sit there with your arms crossed and he says just remember there's no Christianity there at all amen by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said and you find yourself I skipped some of this just to save time he's talking about the real evidence of the Holy Ghost and you find yourself in love with your enemies somebody says well he's nothing but a Holy Roller and you start to get ah be careful don't don't don't just look at Holy Roller look at anything anybody would say to you and call you on a phone text you send you a screenshot and they're per purpose is to disparage another person wow amen now if I've ever been guilty and I have I want to say here tonight before this church Lord Jesus forgive me if I've ever been guilty of disparaging somebody or talking bad about somebody in a way then God here tonight forgive me Lord I don't want that in my life brother random says and you start be careful uhhuh come be careful but when you really find yourself that you love him regardless of what they do you still love them amen then you're beginning to find your patience just gets from about that long till it just don't have no end did y'all read that did that just go over your head when you can start Lov how many here wants more patience how many here are impatient keep those hands up don't be dishonest now there's not a one of us all of us battle with this oh but it's not in the listen if you believe in the genuine atonement it's in your carnal nature to be impatient it's in the fruit of the spirit to have patience brother BR says when you get to loving your enemies he says you begin to find your patience gets from about I'm just going to say that long I don't know how long he helds up till it just don't have no end anybody just keeps saying things about you well I don't care what you say don't get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first before you talk to them again amen y friends I'm telling you this works because this is in the atonement I'm afraid what's happened is is we've so emphasized the things with the atonement the great deep etheral things the Mysteries and I'm all for them all my my but you're you're talking to the wrong person if you think brother Matt doesn't enjoy some of the greater deeper things of God some of the great teaching some of the some of the manifestations of the Holy Ghost to speak in tongues you've heard me testify to you multiple times of times I've spoken tongues and I said to you after I spoke in tongues I thought how could anybody ever criticize it I got only one conclusion they've never spoken tongues amen amen but let me just say to you here tonight there's more to this atonement than just great doctrines or great Revelations or great Mysteries there's a life that can be changed there's a nature that can be changed and I'm here tonight to say God let the atonement come on my life to change my temper to change my attitude to make me Meek to make me sweet to make me holy to make me kind and affectionate one to another and when I find myself and that temper starts to flare up Lord stop me you know I've done that and I'm not here I'm by no means I'm I'm saying I'm just testifying to you about a change God's brought in my heart in my life when I could stop and find myself and and and before I would I'd fly off and my temper to get a hold of me and then in my mind even after that I'd have a moment where I had to come down from that oh come on don't look at me with angel's wings [Laughter] some of y'all came late for church cuz your temper was so flat up you knew you couldn't come into church fing that way and you had to calm down from that and come off of that come on we're only human but I'm not making an excuse for it and I've watched something in my life when that happens and then something in my temper and then God just convicts me because I've asked the Lord to do that and then suddenly I grab a hold of that and say God forgive me I didn't mean to act that way cuz I say like brother brandham Lord I don't want that in my life amen if I if all my revelation of of of this let me just say this to you tonight if my Revelation for this message as much as I could say I'm praying for Revelation let me go let me change my wording if my understanding of this message and this Bible never grows another inch never grows another C ceter but it means that my character becomes more like the nature of Jesus Christ then I'll stop with my knowledge and take his character in my life amen amen Amen brother bam says he says you find your patience anybody just keeps saying these things well I don't care don't get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first before you talk to them again don't get in fusses don't like to get in fuss amen wow amen if you like to see somebody raise up in church say you know what I tell you so and so did so and so you say no brother shame on you if you say oh is that is that so listen to that Scandal watch out watch out watch out if you say oh is that so listen to that Scandal watch out I love this the holy spirit is not a cesspool amen no no no no the heart is occupied by the holy spirit is full of Holiness and Purity thinketh no evil doeth no evil believe in all things endureth longsuffering see is your life worthy of this gospel I say God give it to me Lord give me patience where I don't have any give me meekness where I don't have any give me brotherly love oh God how we need it more than ever before oh could you stand to your feet I'm out of time I could keep going but I'm just going to stop right there could you bow your head with me every head bowed every eye closed I did a little better than last Wednesday at least I think I did just bow your heads with with me every head bowed every eye closed let's let's let the Holy Spirit just move just here for a moment right before we bring you up and we'll pray what does it mean to have the genuine atonement what does it mean to have the token on display listen friends it touches every part of your life you know why God directs men you know why God puts a burden like this on my heart brings me through something in my life because God is concerned about our lives and he won't let us get away with it so the Holy Spirit begins to minister and begins to tell you you got to do something about that temper you got to do something about that malice that you got locked up inside your heart you got to do something about that enemy that that that that you got to Jesus said you got to love listen friends these weren't suggestions these weren't pre- seals these weren't things that just don't matter and they're trivial I would present to you today they're just as important as anything you want to put behind him they're just as vital as anything brother Ram says don't fuss when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them don't fuss f with them don't fuss you see friends temper breeds temper yeah the first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you and you be fussing back then the Holy Spirit takes its flight brother Brandon repeats it temper breathes temper and you know what that when you grieve the holy spirit away from your life prayers go unanswered listen let the Holy Spirit deal with you here deal as he dealt with me when the Holy Ghost takes his flight prayers go unanswered things that you're praying over and you desperately need God to move on your life of your children desperately need God to move in your body and your health when you grieve the holy spirit away because you haven't surrendered this part of your nature prayers go unanswered needs go unmet because temper breeds temper but oh can I say to you tonight that if temper breeds temper then love breeds love and I want you to if you could raise your hand with me to say God I want you to I want you to give me love that'll breed more love so full of love where Jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another I'm not saying you got to agree with everybody I'm not saying you got to compromise for someone may maybe who's not in the word but I'm here you got to I'm here to say you got to love that brother you still got to love that sister did you know brother and sister you're a little Creator and you choose the atmosphere you create in your life when brother renom says I don't want that in my life that's your choice sister that's your choice brother you're a little Creator you want to be a loving person then say God as David said create in me a clean heart I raise my hand tonight and say as David said oh God lord Jesus I pray this prayer for myself have mercy on me God as I just stand here Lord in the under just total conviction of my own sermon tonight I can only do one thing Lord and that's to just pray as David prayed in Psalms 51 and I rais my hand and I say just as David said out of the sincerest part of my heart have mercy on me oh God according to thy love loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions create in me a clean heart oh God you can do it Lord Jesus I believe that with all of my heart you can take a person who's lived with a temper for 30 years who've lived with bitterness for 30 years who's lived with malice in their heart for years and tonight if they would surrender and repent of that thing God you could create a heart of love you could remove a Stony heart you could create a heart of forgiveness will tell but love that is patient that's kind that is longsuffering bring us back God to a genuine atonement that's my prayer Lord as I close this service here tonight I ask you Lord God bring us back to a full atonement that genuine atonement a full atonement it doesn't just cover my soul it also covers my spirit it also covers my body it includes my temper my personality it includes every part of me it's a genuine atonement and I ask God you'd bring us back to Gethsemane tonight bring us back to sacrifice bring us back to being identified with our atonement bring us back
