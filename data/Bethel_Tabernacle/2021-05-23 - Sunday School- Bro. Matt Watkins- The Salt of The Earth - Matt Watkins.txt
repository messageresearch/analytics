TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and we're just going to read a familiar passage here you find this scripture that we're going to read uh in the book of matthew uh and today it's it's going to we're going to read it from luke it gives just a little bit more context but it's very familiar with us when jesus speaks and says that you are the salt of the earth i'd like to speak to you on that today you are the salt of the earth let's read verse 34. salt is good but if the salt has lost its savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears let him hear he that has ears to hear let him hear you can be seated this morning it's amazing when you study the the meaning of salt in the ancient world we always have taken the scripture many times and you've heard it preached or taught upon you are the salt of the earth and we relate to salt by seasoning for flavor and so immediately we think of salt of the earth and when jesus says this that he's referring to us uh he's referring to salt as we season food and so when you read that scripture and it says if the salt loses its savior wherewith shall it be salted we immediately think of seasoning for food but that's actually not at all in any way what jesus meant when he said it that's a good modern uh it sounds good but uh but it's not what jesus was meaning there's a much deeper meaning in that and to be the salt of the earth is what jesus speaks of in matthew uh chapter five when he's giving the beatitudes and he says blessed are the poor in spirit and he goes through all of the character of the christian let's look at that if we could in matthew chapter 5 this morning let's just look here just for a moment and if they have that for the screen you could put that up uh matthew let me just open it actually i have it on the study version but let me open it here and we'll just begin reading here in verse one and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed now this is a good word here and it's the word that we it's amazing because the old testament when you look at the old testament it ends with a curse it ends talking about a curse when jesus comes on the scene his first sermon is when he opens his mouth is blessed and he speaks and says blessed it's a promise that he gives and he says blessed are the poor in spirit it's amazing because when he comes to this let me just pull it i want to make sure i have it on my screen correctly here blessed are the poor in spirit verse 3 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth move all the way down here to verse 12. rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you verse 13 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted it is fence forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be under foot of men you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid so he uses these two parallels you are the salt and you are the light now what's amazing about those two characteristics of salt and light is that in order for salt to have any purpose or value and in order for light to have any purpose or value it actually doesn't have to do anything there's no works that salt needs to perform in order to have a value salt has its value by being salt so it's not about what it does it's about what it is you follow that it's not about uh as uh you know my dad had that the testimony that he has about when the lord came to him about pastoring and he's got a sign on his door now the assistant pastor and is no longer pastor of the church but jesus is the pastor but you remember in his testimony he said the lord came to him and he said lord i want to do more for you i just want to do more for your kingdom i got to get busy and the lord spoke to him and said i don't need you to do more i need you to be more that's profound when you really think about it that's profound it's not in works the christian world has emphasized and this the nominal christian world has emphasized so much on works and what you can do to contact the world what you can do to affect your community and so by that basis they have their outreach and their ministries and their churches and everything is fitted and geared towards what they can do in the community and they do some many wonderful things that the the the you just take even just the uh the soup suppers that they have and the uh the um uh i'm trying to remember what it's called there brother charles that you work at the the food pantry yeah where where you you know so they're doing there's many wonderful things that they're doing for the community but it's been an emphasis on what they can do and they've missed that jesus didn't say when jesus was to tell the church what they're to be it wasn't about what they can go into the world and do for the world it was what they can be for it's only in you being what god made you to be that you can change the world and so therefore we're not salt as in pepper and salt it's not about how much if we just sprinkle enough christians in the world it'll you know sprinkle a little salt in the world it'll change the world that's not what it is that's why jesus said if the salt loses its savior in other words we're going to get into that what he was meaning there in a minute but it was the quality of what salt is by being salt light doesn't have to do anything except be light and a real christian all you have to do is be a real christian be a christian and you'll make a difference in the world what kind of difference how do we make a difference by being salt by being salt how do we make a difference by being what we are by not mixing it notice what he says here you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savor wherewith shall it be started in luke chapter 14 verse 34. he says salt is good but if the salt is lost at savor wherewith shall it be ceased now notice what he says here it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dung kill so he in he immediately gives you a reference as to the importance of salt salt was actually used for a fertilizer to ground and so they would put salt in the earth this is why jesus says you are the salt of the earth there's the there's there's what he's meaning salt was used for fertilizer and with the right amount of salt it could the seed could grow and then he he says so he says it's neither fit for the land nor yet for the dung now what does he mean when he says salt is good but if the salt has lost its savor wherewith shall it be seasoned you see back in the ancient times to to be the salt of the earth the romans were actually they especially in that culture other than the sun there was nothing more valuable than salt that's why you get the word that we have even coined today the phrase or is he worth his salt ever said that about somebody he's not worth his salt she's not worth her you know he's a you speak of that as a worker you know are they worth their salt and so that's where they get that's where it was coined from because to a roman salt was very valuable in fact romans were paid with salt because salt was very important it wasn't salt what we use now today it wasn't about uh we've got to season our food but actually it's how it was your fertilizer he says he says it's not he says if the salt has lost its savior so it was it was it was uh uh taken from the ocean from the dead sea and they would take this salt now when s when people would sell the salt because salt was very valuable you know they would uh as a way to uh you know to to uh it was it was a it was a cruel business practice but they would mix in sand with the salt and when you bought it you thought you had a pound of salt but you actually had about a quarter of a salt and three quarters dirt and so this is what jesus this is amazing when i read this this morning this is actually what jesus means when he says look in luke chapter 14 look it against verse 34 salt is good but if the salt has lost its savor you know for years i looked at them and said see if the salt isn't salty that's that's a that's a that's a paradox that's ca i mean not a paradox it's a it's impossible the salt can't lose its savor salt doesn't not become salt salt is salt you follow what i'm saying if the salt has lost its savor with the salt that means if the salt isn't salty anymore what the hell is that's possible because salt is salt it's you don't have some salt that's not salty you will never taste salt that's not salty if it's salt so jesus wasn't meaning that if we lose our flavor you know if a christian loses its flavor if it loses its saltiness what's he saying if it if it's mixed with the world if it's mixed with the dirt if it's mixed with other things if it's not salt that's what jesus is saying if it's not pure salt and it's hybrid with other things then it loses its savor because it's no longer pure salt it's mixed with other things you see why the importance that we keep our lives pure and unadulterated from the world but what has the world what has the church world done they've mixed the world with the gospel and now it's flavorless salt it's lost its savor and jesus says it's neither fit for the land because if you took that salt that was mixed with dirt and tried to use it as fertilizer guess what it's not going to work if you took now he says here nor yet for the dung kill lotus verse 35 the first 35 nor yet for the dunghill so what they didn't have toilets like we have today you go and flush the toilet so you had something in your backyard a mound this may get very uh gross for you here today but i'm just gonna tell you what jesus meant when he said it you'd use the bathroom in the backyard you'd have a spot in the ancient days and they would they would have a they would have a pile of dirt where you use the bathroom and in order to now not use fertilizer now it's not going to be a blessing it's it's going to curse it's going to curse the land they would use salt and throw salt on the dung hill and so jesus is using the reference here and he says but if the salt is mixed it's lost its effect it's lost its power it's lost its ability it's not good he says it's not fit for the land look at verse 35. it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear in other words jesus is saying i'm not talking about salt used for fertilizer are used for the dung hill you got to think deeper than that if you've got an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches you are the salt of the earth be i don't need you to do i need you to be i don't need you to do something it's not about what you can do we so many times as christians spend so much time on what can i do for the lord what can i do for the lord what can i do for my community what can i do to outreach and make a difference be a christian how do we evangelize is it by you know we can do many great things there's there's some awesome things that we can do we they the last night at the uh brother ken boos at his re at his uh coffee shop there had a had an outdoor singing it was wonderful wonderful outreach and it's you so we do things there's mediums that we use to contact the world but i can promise you that if if in contacting them we mix some worldliness with our salt what will it produce it'll produce a worldly church and what what you find is that the world the the the mixing this is what jesus was warning against the mixing of worldliness into the dirt the mixing the worldness into the salt and jesus says it's lost its savior wherewhat shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dungeon but men cast it out they throw it on the roadway they have no use for it and let me say this this is so this is this is so powerful what brother branham speaks about when he talks about a real christian and he says the world is looking they're thirsting for a real christian they're thirsting for they don't want the world doesn't want our mixed hybridized worldly gospel message they lose respect for that in fact that jesus is saying they they what is he saying he says when the church is mixed up and and and there's that you're not it's not pure and it's mixed in it's compromised oh we've got to be you know we've got to reach the youth so you know in order to reach the youth you know we've got to take our christian lyrics we'll put it with rock and roll music and then we'll have rock christian rock concerts and it'll bring them all in is this what jesus said jesus says no when you do that when you mix it and the salt loses its savor it's not good for anything and actually the response will be contempt that the world will will look at christianity with disgust that's all you got that's don't you realize the world is wanting the real they're wanting the real salt not the mixed salt they're wanting the real thing that has power that has an effect that brings change and brother branham says the world's looking for that they're thirsting to see they've seen so much of the counterfeit that's all you got to do you say how do i witness to my community be a christian as the you know the um you know the well how does the how does this saying go that you know if you preach us to to preach a sermon and if necessary use words so you live a sermon you live it out by your life that's what the world's looking for what can i do to affect my unsaved loved one just be a christian don't compromise and many times we get well i you know i don't want to be too ex i got to sort of sort of you know dole the word down a little bit don't give it to them so so sharp and and you know i gotta sort of uh peop listen we're all guilty of this you know i sort of gotta i can't be so you know um they'll think i'm weird well they'll think i'm strange well you'll get their attention you'll get their attention be a real christian you'll get their attention nothing else is getting their attention what is the message of as we said the message of the church mixed in uh with worldliness what's it done it's not it's made the world it's it's made the world have a can have a contempt or a disgust towards christianity i don't want nothing to do with that why would i want anything to do with that a gospel message that doesn't have power that doesn't clean lives it's about character and this is powerful the romans chapter 8 very familiar scripture verse 28 it says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to him to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so this was what was important that we don't project our own life but we're conformed to the image our life is a projector of the image of the sun the son of god that he might be the firstborn among many brethren listen to what brother branham says here he says now jesus gave us the example i didn't have time to put it up for you to read he says jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into god's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that is a perfect example that is a perfect example now but we find out that as long as we go along through life that our character molds the image that we are each one knows that he says you just he says he says each one know that your character molds you to what you are now you have seen people that you just love to be around yet they might not exactly be in your bracket or society and again they might be of a different race he says the the brown the yellow the white the black but there's just something about that character that you just love to be in their presence you know you know when i've you know you know who he's speaking of that that i think of believers christians i don't even have to know them but if you get around a real believer you get around a real christian there's just an ad an affinity that you have with them whether they speak your language or not you go to go to overseas you know you can't even sometimes the people can't even speak your language when you get outside and they just shake your hand and smile and you can't say anything but god bless you and they may know that much english and they can't say much more back you could tell they're bursting wanting to tell you what they thought about your sermon and everything that you said but you can't there's no conversation but yet there's a language that you're speaking one with another the language of a believer brother madam says it's that character he says there's just something about that character that you just love to be in their presence because each person is a little dynamo of their own and you put out an atmosphere whether you realize it or not your life is a little dynamo and it puts out an atmosphere and and jesus says you are the salt of the earth just be salt don't worry about what you can do just be a christian be a real believer just be what god made you to be and and and be it don't hide it that's what jesus says he talks about as you are the light of the world it says does men light a candle to hide it no but it's a city set on a hill what's important for the salt how's the salt going to get into the how how's the salt going to have an effect it's got to get into the earth it's got to you know if we just if all of our salt is is this church is just a big storehouse of salt and it never goes out into the earth how are we ever going to impact the world but you've got to take that atmosphere you've got to take that life and you've got to spread it into the uttermost parts of the earth and he says each is a little dynamo you put out an atmosphere then you see people that were noble people but yet you were always glad to get away from them yeah i've been around some people like that he says you've seen people and you're just always glad man i'm so glad i'm away from that person even noble it's just they create such an atmosphere around where you are nothing against them they're nice people but you just don't like that atmosphere they're in and they're and their character creates whatever they are makes them what they are we're out of time let's stand up stand to our feet i want to say lord give me that christ-like character let me reflect something that can change the world lord we thank you for this morning's teaching for the service lord today father may it be sown into her hearts lord i pray father it would be blessed of you lord bless the service the singing lord the minister and of your word in jesus name amen [Music] you
