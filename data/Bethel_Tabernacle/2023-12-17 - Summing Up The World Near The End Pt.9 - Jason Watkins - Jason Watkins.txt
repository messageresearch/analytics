scriptures to St John 15 this morning we hope to continue by the help of the Lord and perhaps might just get finished it looks like the finish line is in sight might be able to get there amen praise the Lord no giggling amen praise the Lord we're happy to have you all on this sunny still up there I just above the clouds don't ever forget it's still there this uh wonderful wonderful Sunny Sunday Monday morning praise the Lord the Son of God shining in our hearts amen I just said Lord if we can have the reign of the spirit equal to the rain we've had all this morning I'll take it amen praise the Lord uh greet our visitors here God bless you happy to have you other different ones perhaps here we um we want to be remembering uh the Howell Family I'm sure you got the notice that went out sister Becky called me about 5:30 this morning I guess they just found out so they're sad but they're also stalwart they're also believing God that it is an answer to prayer that God saved their son and the only way he could sometimes because God won't Force you but if you're his child he'll just Paul taught that brother Brown taught that he'll just take you off the Earth Amen to save your soul according to St Paul and so uh sister Becky had actually went through a prayer line few years ago um brother Ronald Dean Spencer and the desire on her heart was to say this was what she said to brother Ron she said I I just want to be like Hattie Wright I want to have the assurance that my children I want to claim them and have the assurance that he's he that she had and she said brother Ron looked at her and said all right sister hady claim it and believe it don't you never back up from it and that's been her testimony so today even through the sadness and the tears and I talked to brother Joe and you could hear their hearts breaking as you can well imagine uh but yet they are rejoicing in the mercy of the Lord they firmly believe they will see that Wayward young man again amen praise the Lord sister uh Becky joins a small number of sisters here who have lost sons and uh who were wayward but the Lord we're believing the Lord took them home amen amen we have um we have uh one announcement that after service today amen we are going to have a baptism praise the Lord you still on brother Josh praise God we're going to be baptizing brother Josh Morehouse at the end of service so amen praise the Lord I told all the brothers on the teams I said don't let me forget it if you have to Bing me with a spitwad do and immediately you can't believe how they piled on I'm bringing my ammo I'm making them now brother Charles said amen so if y'all see one of them firing at me say duck amen praise the Lord but we're happy in the Lord today amen happy to have all of you here amen we had a wonderful time at the youth Gathering uh Friday night I so appreciated all the participation and uh it was uh it was really really good the whole atmosphere we managed to teach a little bit a little bible study there gonna kind of for the young people who got to hear some of that uh Friday night it was really just a continuation of Wednesday night when we just came to a screeching halt and I I wanted to say a few more things I said it to them so we might young people we might recap not directly but I recap some of the general thought from Friday night and I want to go forward Today part nine of summing up the world near the end it is a very perilous age that we live in friends and I'm I'm glad to be able to tell you today that you are in a place where the supernatural power of God can come down and is obligated and has promised to meet your every need there's nothing nothing that's happening in the world with all the madness that we see that can overwhelm God's word so so you put your order in today will you you put your faith and say Lord I have needs in my life and I want to see the word how many I want to see the word come forward and put Supernatural strength in me because I'll promise you that it will do that it absolutely will I've seen that so many times over the years the word of God just come in with the perfect solution to everything you could need um St uh let's read from St John 15 amen this morning as we uh open our Bibles see here yes perfect okay we'll catch verse 1 to8 and we'll let you be seated I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman so this makes him the farmer every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word that's an important verse in verse three you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit Jesus seems to be really interested in you bearing Fair reading for without me you can do nothing verse verse six if a man abide not in me he's not letting it go see he didn't just want to say it he's not but he's not letting this go if a man abide not in me he's cast cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me he's still he's pressing his case if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you now here's the real goal herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples he has quite an interest in bringing glory to the father by being able to live through you amen but the only way he can do that is if you're out of his way all right now I'm summing up the world at the end time I'm not only summing up Satan's Eden which we have done in previous lessons of this but we're really coming down to this point that God is designed to have this world see one last time a quick brother brandham said a powerful demonstration of the holy spirit amen so we know that we are living in that moment that he's Desiring to do it so if ever St John 15 was important I think we could could conclude it's important today and if you don't conclude that I hope you will by the time we're finished with the sermon today let's pray father we thank you for your word and we ask for your divine blessing Lord upon it now and I pray you to settle my heart and mind Lord as I read through these notes I have such a burning desire to to go through them carefully and to this may be the last portion in this series and I want to clench it and drive the nail till it till it clenches Lord so I pray that you'll be my helper I commit it to you give us all hearing Hearts today thank you for the preparation lord of the spirit of God upon me thank you for anointing me Lord in prayer and in study I commit myself into your hands now Lord we're remembering brother Joe sister Becky and all of the children a very sad uh loss Lord but but Father Paul told us Paul didn't say that that we don't sorrow it's just that we don't sorrow as the world Sorrows having no hope our hope is in Christ Our Hope is in the word our belief and our faith is in a token Lord that was applied to that young man father and so we are looking to you with confidence today as children would look to any father Lord with a great need on their heart I pray you'll Comfort them lift them up above the shadows of this sorrow Lord and be their comfort I pray help us to know Lord what we can do more for them they are part of our bethl family they always will be lord they're very special to us and so we're asking for a very special blessing upon them in jesus' name amen God bless you friends you can be seated all right so I I want to just take five or 10 minutes and just recap just quickly um I'm definitely not going to burn up my time doing it but I just want to make some quick points to you and then we are going to take some scriptures and some quotes and different things uh to stir you up by way of remembrance will that be okay amen I'm just looking to make sure that I'm all got all my ducks in a row here I don't think I do but that's okay amen praise the Lord let me see why I don't no I do praise God all right excellent okay let's have my title slide brother Noah amen so we are summing up the world near the end and I'm taking for a subtitled today his presence in our lives his presence in our lives we were saying to you Wednesday night when we read our reading of St John 15 how that Jesus in the early part of his ministry his message to his disciples as it related to his relationship with them was come and follow me uh but there came a point late in his ministry this is very late in his life by the time you get to St John 15 uh The Book of John doesn't go uh much further so this is coming near the end of his life he has another very gripping prayer in the 17th chapter and from there his life begins to wind up rapidly and so we were pointing out to you uh as did Andrew Murray that great Theologian from yester year that's the commentator I couldn't think of his name Wednesday night a wonderful servant of the Lord and he was making the point he was emphasizing that it's near the end of Jesus ministry that now his message is going to transition and to not just follow me but abide in me and I in you now that's going to become necessary and this is the point that I wasn't able to get to so much Wednesday but I was able to get it to the young people Friday is that the the reason that you would need to abide that he changes his message it's not so much that he changes it as that he increases it he amplifies it and so he's because now he's getting ready to leave and the Holy Ghost is getting ready to come and the disciples have had they're not yet born again but they've had the advantage of hanging out with Jesus they've been with him they've ate together slept together fished together preached together prayed together and so they've had his presence there with them externally uh although they didn't have the Holy Ghost upon them yet it was upon him and that was a strong influence don't ever underestimate the strong influence you can have by having by being in possession of the Holy Ghost and the influence you can have don't ever underestimate it it's very powerful and so what you want to do you say well how can I make my influence how can the Holy Ghost in me uh I'm going to ask a good question on your behalf how can I have the Holy Ghost In Me affecting people and not just affecting them but effecting change in their lives how can I have that like Jesus had it the answer is super simp simple Jesus said I do always that which pleases the father so Jesus had a life of prayer he had a life of intentional dedication could I suggest to you today to serve God on purpose could I suggest to you today to have spirituality on purpose can I suggest to you today to make your prayer life intentional then if you do that then your Holy Ghost will influence those around you who don't have the Holy Ghost like maybe your children who have been raised in the ways of the Lord who are being influenced by the Holy Spirit and the greatest service that you can give to them as parents the greatest service you can do as Grandparents the greatest thing you can do as a student in school is allow the Holy Spirit to to work through your experience to those around you so that they can be affected and effected abide in me so it's a it's further than just follow me because now near the end before leaving for heaven he's going to introduce this new phase to signify the need and the access to a deeper spiritual ual connection which is going to come on the day of Pentecost in the upper room you're with me all right so when we look at that we emphasize these two verses now you're clean through the word that's logos which I have spoken to you now you know I I didn't take the time but because we've studied it so much in St John 1:1 you had that word logos in the beginning was the word that's logos the word the logos means the established word for those who haven't been here during the series it just means the established word but then Jesus would come down later that's in John 1 one but in John 663 he he has this all encompassing vital oh my how vital don't forget John 663 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing Paul would say that if you live by the flesh you'll die if you live by your flesh you'll never produce for God even if you've been born again of the spirit even if you've had a holy ghost experience if you don't abide in him if you don't serve him with fervor and Zeal on purpose amen with intent I listen Paul said the same way that you served the devil at one time now take that Zeal and serve the Lord I I you know at one time we all had our conversation in the world and we love the world don't deny it because Paul has already identified it we just have to admit it and in that time you loved the world you loved the things of the world maybe you were taught different maybe you were you knew you shouldn't do it you didn't want to miss the Rapture you didn't want to go to hell but but the the problem was your inner man lusted after the things of the world even though you knew it was wrong you loved the devil I'm sorry but that's the Fallen nature you were born with even if you were raised in a good home taught to know better and desired even to do better hell is paved with good intentions the road to hell is paved with good intentions a lot of people had very good intentions this young man a Rich Young Ruler had very good intentions he wasn't coming to Jesus for a show he actually had served God by the law but knew he still was coming up short and he says to the master of Life what can I do and Jesus said give your all that's really all he had to do give your all Jesus beholding him loved him give your all don't hold back anything it's not just Jesus wasn't chasing his money Jesus wanted his heart it wasn't just give all your money and give to the poor Jesus was saying come take up your cross and follow me see so but he couldn't do that and so we he says here the flesh Prophet is nothing but the words see now that's Rema the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so you have the world believing in the logos just like you do you understand we give you the example of Isaiah coming to and Gabriel coming to Mary Isaiah's prophecy was the logos but when the angel spoke it to Mary you're it then then God came down and a Supernatural way and quickened her faith and she said be it unto me I don't see how seems impossible but I'm a believer of the word and that faith in God's word was was then then what happened to Mary she got pregnant she became the Rema the living Isaiah's prophecy was logos it was just words but Mary became that prophecy in a body she became the Living Word the Rema of the logos and that's why Jesus said it is the spirit that quickeneth the Rema that I speak unto you not just that you memorize Bible verses not just that you live by a code of conduct but you have surrendered your life to Christ you have been filled with his spirit and your life now is a constant quest to get you out of the way and put him in charge and you become the Living Word in the world say how important is that brother brandham said it's so important that it'll that one of these mornings it'll raise the dead for hundreds of years is this bride becoming the Rema it's not sufficient to quote and believe Malachi 4 it's not sufficient to quote Revelation 10 seven and even believe it you've got to and you say I even I read 8 to 11 John eating the book and I believe that too it's not sufficient to just say I believe it are you going to be it are you willing to be the word I'm going to tell you what it's wonderful here in this atmosphere today and it sounds tastes very sweet in your mouth to say it yes sir I'll do it we raise up our hands but don't you don't think it won't be bitterness down in your belly because you're going to have to fight the greatest battle ever fought you're going to have every Devil with his guns trained on you you make yourself a Target but I just say bring it because I'm going to be a believer that's it I've made up my mind I'm going to be a believer and if I'm going to be one I'm going to be a real one tell you make a mistake sure what do you do about it then what do you do get up then what do you do go forward I will never stop hallelujah how many are with me today so it's so important the words that I speak it the Rema the in other words the revealed word not just the logos all the Christian denominations have this but it's the spirit that quickeneth it's the spirit that giveth life it's the spirit that giveth Revelation amen am so it's the anointed word it's the revealed word it's the Living Word that's the same thing just in different phases God reveals the word he anoints you to believe it and then you become it easy to follow all right so now ye are clean through the word which I've spoken to you that's why there's there's a blessing in just reading this there's a blessing in just hearing it there's a blessing in obeying it even if you're not born again absolutely this will give you a much better life even if you never become a Christian if there were I've I've often said if there was no heaven and no Rapture I'd still live by this because it's a better life I've never hung over I had to keep all my money because I don't spend it on booze and fast living I have a good name and a reputation I have a bomb in Gilead that I can get healed by if I get sick I have a comforter and a friend why why I I it gives me it makes me an honorable man who would not want to live by this even if they weren't even if there was no Heaven see the blessings of God Jesus said blessed are the merciful they shall obtain Mercy amen blessed are the meek blessed are the poor in spirit all these different things you know there that's why in just as just something as simple human the right mental attitude towards the word of God you know we've told we've told this testimony for Years brother Lyn Gibbs who's gone on to be with the Lord he preached tithes and offerings so strong as part of the Christian experience and they asked brother brandom do you have to pay ties to go to heaven brother R said well I I can't say that he said but I can say this if you are a Christian you certainly will pay your tithes and offerings he said because that's what a Christian does CU God overpays you and he gives you his portion to see if you'll bring it back to him and if you put it in your gas tank or in a restaurant you took your wife out or you bought a new car you you did that with God's portion you didn't return it to him how in the world am I on that oh I know I was telling you a story brother Gibbs preached that so strong this is a true story he had attorneys High rolling attorneys in that area where he lived who weren't even Christians didn't even go to church but they sent him ties because they said pastor we started doing it and we see God blessing us and blessing us and blessing us and we ain't even Christians God keeps his word just with a mental agreement right right amen please can I move on thank you amen wow what was up with that anyway it so if you abide in me and my words abide in you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you now I want to concentrate on that seventh verse if you become the Living Word this is my my this is what this is Brother Jason reading verse 7 if you abide in me and my words since I know what Rema now means abide in you you shall ask what you will in other words you'll be the one bringing forth fruit you'll ask what you will you'll be the one operating supernat power you'll be the one putting Devils under your feet who will do that the Believers who abide see if ye become the Living Word by a new birth and maintain a close spiritual relationship with me you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you you get it yes is that clear amen NLT on the next verse when you produce much fruit you are my true disciples this brings great glory to my father amen so here's where we've been I want to quickly read these next few slides this is where this was part of the theme of this series brother brandham in Christ is revealed in his own word August of 1965 there's three manifestations now the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into that one person Jesus Christ bride and B he's talking about the coming of the Lord the catching away amen how many believe are right there is when it's all gathered up into that one person Jesus Christ bride and body see I've been trying to get you to understand in this series that we can talk about summing up the world near the end but this is summing up the bride this is summing up Christ near the end I already know it's Satan's Eden I I already know that he's the God of this evil age I already know these things are are moving I already know there's Insanity everywhere on the streets but what about me and you is it our destiny just to tough it out here forever no we're leaving in an exodus we have a Third Exodus what is going to happen just before we leave the Earth thank you for asking I'm summing it up now the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into that that one person Jesus Christ bride and body at the physical Return of the Lord Jesus making his three times when he was brought on Earth killed crucified raised up manifesting him himself in the form of his body which is his bride the woman you get it she is part of his body and the woman and man is just so close together till they're just almost they are the same they ought to be anyhow there they are see they just exactly manifest manifested the same she is part of him because she was taken out from him and the B bride today is taken out from the body of Christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would do for this day the bride the queen king and the Queen all right you got that amen amen so so when we come back to it now Jesus introducing this new phrase not merely follow me but abide in me all right so I was want to give you a comparison of this for a moment I'm granting my starting line is that you've already had a new birth experience all right so you're following the Lord but there's a big difference difference between following and abiding because abiding following is standing in his presence as a follower this is surrender this is what your prayer life should be when the next time you're on your knees I want you to put this image in your mind I am bowing and I'm putting my head in his bosom and I'm saying Lord help me today I want to serve you more I want to be surrendered more I was praying that at 2:30 this morning Lord help me I want to surrender more oh I want to see the power of God move in your life move in your home move in your family I I'm I'm dedicated to it I'm committed to it oh but I I I can't do it alone bethl Tabernacle surrender surrender abide abide see there's a massive difference between between standing before God and kneeling not just men there's a massive difference between a sister standing with her hands up she's a follower of Christ there's a big difference between that and that come on sister there's a big difference let me appeal to you today this is the kind of lady you want to be on your knees head bowed saying Lord God make me more like you yeah Hallelujah you accept that I am more convinced I am more convinced listen to me bethl Tabernacle Ministry I am more convinced that a that that as the ministry emphasizes abiding in Christ as much as we emphasize forgiveness through his blood that I believe that Believers will produce more and more and more of his purity of his gifts of his life I'm not just up here with a sinner's sermon I'm not just here to tell you the blood of Jesus Christ forgives you I'm glad you're following him but are you abiding in him are you every day drawing closer amen oh let it be my brothers that we that we give equal time not just to the forgiveness and the blood of Christ but to the cleansing and to the changing power that it has and can have in our lives if you abide in me and my Rema abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you so if you become as I said if you become the living word by a new birth and you maintain a close and maintain maintenance is such a word you maintain a close spiritual relationship with Christ then you're the one who will ask and God will hear by by bearing much fruit you will Jesus said you will glorify my father all right and that's the purpose that Jesus lived for to glorify the father and he says and when you glorify the father then ye are my disciples you're not just a believer you're not just a follower you're actually a disciple because the world God is getting Glory through your life by bearing fruit you will glorify the father all right so so I would say let us strive to bear as much fruit as possible am that that should at this point now the early part of this series I was really emphasizing and teaching you from the prophet's message that it is this bride she is the his body she's the continuation but my message now as we come to a close because we're coming to the close of the age and we're we're coming to the that last moment and my message is beginning to push in this direction that we want to be able to demonstrate that our commitment is to Christ alone and in that and in that commitment we we can make uh the Lord you know glorified I I just would say today are are you willing to make that commitment today to say Lord I don't just want to be a Christian I just want to be a believer but I want to I want you to help me today here's what I'll commit Lord you being my helper I will begin I see what the pastor's talking about I'm going to get on the road to being more committed and more Abiding and more surrendered come on bethl Tabernacle oh my there's nothing you'll do to release power in your home more than that and fact is Rema must be in play for the established word to live out to his disciples that was going to be a point that Jesus was making that is what I told you Wednesday was the real non-negotiable non-negotiable is not the Trinity the the well you know what I to to a degree it is the correct Trinity because the Bible says there's no other name given among men whereby they must be saved and brother brandham flatly says on tape near the end of his ministry there is no Redemption under those titles if you've been baptized you need to be baptized again if you got baptized wrong see so it becomes very important but the real non-negotiable is that you allow the Holy Spirit to bring you to life and then you you you you know you allow him to work in your life inspiration and anointing I want to turn a corner now inspiration and anointing from the spirit of God doesn't require a new birth in and of itself it struck balum and he prophesied correctly a star shall rise in Jacob when the three wise men came they were following that prophecy it struck Caiaphas and he prophesied concerning the sufferings of Christ and he prophesied accurately see it struck Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar stood and said I will say today there is no God but Daniel's God only the god of Israel is the true God and he and that was what God taught him you see so so it can strike false anointed ones brother bradam show that it's a false it's a true anointing at the end time striking a false vessel so I want to say again that inspiration and anointing from the spirit of God doesn't require a new birth but now I'm going to tell you something friends uh to to to be born again that is Rema that is Rema that is the word alive so so it it can strike that the anointing that brings Rema the inspiration that brings Rema those men didn't become the Living Word did they see so when it falls on a true child of God we see a very different outcome and a result and that's why when the inspiration of God when the anointing of God Came Upon the characters of God's family in the Old Testament the writers of the Old Testament even even even before the Holy Ghost was given that inspiration struck Abel and Abel brought a sacrifice correctly Abel became Rema and he wasn't he couldn't even be born again but he did become a manifestation of a revelation he did it see it happened to Abraham it happened to Moses it happened to David it happened to Isaiah it happened to John the Baptist so whenever it strikes a child of God it definitely has a different effect than when it strikes a non-child of God it crossed into the New Testament and struck Peter Peter stood there in in Matthew 16 and he had a revelation said who do men say that I am you're the Christ son of the Living God he said Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that Peter My Father revealed it so Peter caught a revelation he wasn't even yet born again you understand the difference it struck the woman at the well uh brother bradam goes to St John 4 you know I I I can't confess that I've ever did a a thorough count but just in my experience of reading through the message all these many years I would say other than maybe Mark 16 and maybe Hebrews 13:8 John 4 the woman at the well brother Bram goes back to that more than any other scripture especially in the prayer line and people are coming up he says now here we have here's a woman and now we have a perfect scene of St John 4 a woman approaches a conversation ensues woman bring me a drink you know the story and and they go on down to verse 23 and and she she she starts immediately turning religious you know we know that you know this is going to happen in Messiah when he comes and and and Jesus says the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers so if there's true worshippers Jesus is talking about the time is and is coming in other words it's already in me and it's about to come in my kingdom you understand that the time he says and now is the hour cometh and now is it's coming when you will be like me that's the prophecy there's coming a time it already is in existence in me but it's coming in you and the true worshippers so if so if there's going to be true worshippers in the era of the Holy Ghost then there would also have to be false ones because you can't you can't have a counterfeit without a reel and you're not likely you're not going to have a reel without the devil counterfeiting it he's done it since the aons of of time of History he's always counterfeited what God does because he wants to be God he's always wanted to be Isaiah outed him for that even though Satan was pretty upset when that happened but Isaiah outed him publicly that that was the desire of his heart to be like God to conquer you you know something friends let me tell you let me give you some Insider Supernatural uh God's army military intelligence Satan wants your position he wants you out of it so he can take it I want to say to you don't let that happen teenagers don't let that happen you are entitled by that day on Calvary you are entitled as a child of God to stand in the steps of Christ to perform his Works don't let Satan Edge you out of your inheritance amen the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth see the problem is Sister you know you're you're saying in this mountain or that mountain and we say in Jerusalem but I'm just telling you after a while it ain't going to matter where you live or where you worship only that you do only that you do it in Truth and in and in spirit that you're not a hypocrite about it because there are going to be those who in vain they worship me teaching for Doctrine the the Commandments of men and he says and God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith to him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus Jesus saith unto her now catch this 26 and 27 Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he verse 27 I didn't put it up here on purpose and upon this catch those three words and upon this come his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her and verse 28 the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith unto all the men come see a man you know the story who told me the things that I've done so the woman at the well in St John 4:26 and 27 in which he's going to say and upon this at a at which time when it when when it says and upon this at that time two things happened in Rapid succession number one the first thing that happened was the disciples uh returned but all voices were silent and I'm here to tell you something friends it is in my experience that when this kind of Supernatural Revelation is breaking I'm here to tell you all other voices are silent you don't hear any other thing the devil can just talk and talk and talk and everybody can try to dissuade you and move you but when God is pouring out his Revelation Upon a Child of God every body falls silent I didn't say Speak Lord Speak Lord and I will listen the second thing is the effect that it brings for we see the woman leave her water pots and run with the testimony in other words we see the woman leave all other Pursuits behind with all of her former Pursuits and all of her former purposes I'm here to tell you it doesn't matter what you have invested in your life you may you may have invested in a career an education you may be in the middle of it right now but when you come into the presence of Jesus and he begins to reveal himself to you suddenly all other Pursuits she dropped her water pots she didn't care about that anymore she didn't care about her past she didn't care about her bad name she ran into the City and the Bible says she converted the whole village this is the power of Revelation amen and it all because that she had a gene of God but also she was willing to engage with Christ are you willing today are you willing to take some time set aside to engage with the Lord I'll assure you friends say well brother brother Jason she wasn't even yet born again I'll assure you that this experience at the well led her to the upper room I'll promise you she was among those 120 oh yes sir and brother brandham showed she's a she's literally a type of this bride in the last age because if there was ever an age where we come out of the worst possible condition I mean if you raised in a good home you have a great Advantage but many of us weren't and many of us were and still went out into the gutters of the world but oh God is rich in Mercy and Jesus said I must needs go by Samaria I'm glad one day he said I must go I must needs go by Newton North Carolina I got a young man who's not giving his whole heart to me and when he found me and I found him oh it was such a privilege to give my whole heart to him see so the result so it it's it's the the new birth I want to say this very carefully so the New Birth by the Holy Ghost uh that isn't necessary for this phenomenon of the anointing to fall upon you it's not for God's inspiration to fall upon you uh nor nor is it as I proved to you it's not even necessary that you have a gene of God but the result will be different if there's a gene of God the result will be different if it's a child of God moreover it takes the quickening I'm here to tell you something it it takes the quickening of the spirit it takes the revelation of the word word upon our heart to bring anyone to the new birth to bring you to the Living Word takes the baptism of the holy spirit this is why brother brandham would say when they ask him what is the new birth brother brandham and he would say it is the revelation of Jesus Christ who is the word right it it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and brother brandham says right behind his own statement amen amen I'm going to tell you something that's a that's a double something when a prophet makes a statement and says Amen to his own statement I'm here to tell you say why amen I believe it's because that this life produces an amen in the voice of your life I don't believe you can come to a revelation of God and stay the way you are it's impossible it changes Paul said all things are are all old things are gone and All Things become new amen the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin brother brandom says all desires of the world are gone from him see then he's all he's got to do then is contend with his flesh and that's where abiding comes in you can't redeem yourself but it's up to you but it's up the Bible says the bride hath made herself ready see it's up to you to abide in him to bring forth fruit so this this this anointing this revelation of the word creates Rema in you it makes an amen in the voice of your lived life the the gene seed which is also the word that's why brother Ram said two omnipotence met it's the word meeting the word see this is why you say Amen to the word because you can't say otherwise am I I had no choice but to fall in love with sister Debbie say you could have ran I tried I didn't get far then she played hard to get and kna killed me amen I had to come back crawling on hands and knees oh I didn't know she'd already captured my heart and I tried to run off without it and realized I didn't have it anymore but that's the way it is with Christ it makes the word a perpetual and continual Rema in your life all right is this all making sense to you so a life renewed daily by time spent with the Lord in prayer I'm I'm clicking along just stay right with me it's an entering into a partnership with Christ to influence the world around you it's a it's a faith and and a reality that that comes down from heaven it brings down a supernatural power into the world your dedicated life your prayer life your commitment your abiding makes you a conduit it brings down the supernatural power of God to move in the earth you understand when Jesus was here physically the supernatural power of God moved moved in the earth well he's in heaven now so now he comes into the Earth through his family and now you are a projector of the supernatural power of God see to bring to do what to bring glory to the father so this is why Jesus would say herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and the and so shall you be my disciples so when you're his disciple when you're bearing forth fruit then I'm here to tell you that gives you the power to walk into any situation doesn't matter you are a conquering force in any situation the Lord lead you into you accept that today you you you you're you're the one who can walk into any situation and take every Spirit under your control for the glory of God you're the one who can apply a token over a home and because you say it God honors it and it sticks Hallelujah that's paying big dividends to brother Joe and sister Becky today because they signed and sealed it with the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this kind of power will will bring order out of disorder it'll turn chaos into Beauty I don't care what's happened it'll beautify your life it'll cast out Devils it'll heal the sick it'll raise the dead we've seen it happen amen it's a living word that's brought to life by an experience of the Holy Ghost that Living Word listen friends it's that Living Word that can never die or face the Judgment it's passed from Death to eternal life that eternal life is alive in you and it's it's it's it's alive in you and it what it's really doing is daily that part of you is already in Heavenly places with Christ it's trying to get your body there it's it's not just trying to get your soul there now it's working on getting this flesh there Hallelujah abide in me as you can do nothing unless you abide in me so I'm believing that and as I said to the ministry I'm more convinced that this is an emphasis that we must make I believe it'll bring more faith I believe it'll bring more Resolve I believe it'll bring more power I you know it would produce power over evil in your life how many want that the power of God would move through you constantly it would be listen friends it would be out of that kind of life that the Redemptive blessings flow that's why Jesus is emphasizing it abide in me so that you can be fruitful so that you can bring your fruit fruitfulness will bring glory to God you've got the Holy Ghost is coming I'm leaving a little while the world won't see me but you'll see me it's a secret you don't understand it now but you will I'm going to be with you even in you and the life you see in me is going to be in you and the ministry of seeing me is going to be in you if you want to operate it like you see me operate then live like I live spend time in prayer spend time with the Lord dedicate yourself uh hide in that presence because it's out of that kind of life that the Redemptive blessings of Calvary all the blessings that Calvary purchased and everything that the Holy Ghost sealed in you oh I'm here to tell you something friends out of that life would flow all the fruits of the spirit you believe me it would give you power over your tongue and your temper would give you power over your flesh it would give you power I'm preaching about real power to live and over overcoming life to stop getting drug around by the devil you don't have to do that young people you can be full of the power of almighty God Hallelujah by accepting Jesus in faith uh Andrew Murray said this by accepting Jesus in faith as he offers himself to us he and his word we surrender ourselves completely to him to his every word so in in other words by accepting him in in the way he offers and the way he's offering it to you is through a surrendered life so you're not going to cheat him you're not just going to walk up and say I need some power over Devils so I Lord I believe the message well but what has it done in your life what have you allowed you think I'm going to you think I have the the low God would be saying to you you think I have the low character to give Heavenly power to you and you don't even have enough Zeal to spend an hour with me in prayer God would never the the the the tutor would never give that that kind of power out God's got too much character he knows that power apart from character is satanic doesn't mean you're the devil but it means Satan can get a hold of your life and use the power of God wrongly all right let me quickly move on I think I'm going to make it today a seed is not air with a Shug now we see that there are three in the Perfection God is perfected in threes now and that was in the Perfection of the Seed of Abraham was ishmail and Isaac and Jesus he's perfected in threes ishmail Isaac and Jesus ishmail coming from the Bond woman see Isaac coming from the free woman and both of them with sex but Christ Jesus coming from the Virgin with no sex amen see now that's how the church starts that's how it always starts and here we find the beginning of the promise of God being made manifest through a slightly doubted interrupted program of God so first of all Sarah slightly doubted the word and said to Abraham take take Hagar which they picked up Hagar in Egypt the Bible teaches us that brother Bram said that on tape that they picked up Hagar in Egypt and and and why were they in Egypt because Abraham was backslid he ran for it when when life got a little hard in the promised land oh come on Friends listen the Bible the Bible doesn't say Abraham never stumbled Bible says Abraham never stumbled at the promise I'm so glad of that cuz I've stumbled all kinds of times but I've never stumbled at the [Applause] promise and just like the Lord brought Abraham out and nearly nearly cost him everything he had and it gets Hagar and and I've said to this Israel is to this day paying for that because that brought forth ishmail and it brought forth a wild man and they're untamable and Israel's had to fight them ever since so don't do that you don't have to do it that's a word slightly doubted see and so you say all right so but but then Sarah was the right womb so now it's Abraham first it was the right seed in the wrong womb now it's the right seed in the right womb but it's still coming by sex so it's still not the not the not the Genesis it's not the original understand that started in Eve and so so we find out that that that Jesus comes perfect God is perfected he was perfected it does matter that the and brother R says that's what the church does it always starts that's how it always starts and here we find on what a promise slightly doubted oh I know the Bible says that but I don't think it means that to for me in this hour I know what it says about women you know in the Old Testament uh you know not wearing a garment that pertains to a man but that's the old Testament I know Paul said that a woman shouldn't cut her hair but that's Paul he was just an old woman hater and and and and that's the that's take but I believe in Jesus that's taking the word and trying to make it live when you're doubting the promise you got to take all the word see and so here we find the beginning of the promise of God being made manifest through a slightly doubted interrupted program of God and here's Sarah even to who the promise Sarah being a woman which is a type of the church gave doubt to the original program of God's promised word see just bypassing one little Iota changed the whole program this is this is exactly why the church even the true church we're not talking about the bride we're talking about the foolish virgin the remnant of the woman's seed this is why they missed the Rapture cuz they don't accept all the word of God they do accept Christ but it's a promise slightly doubted and because they don't and because of that they don't receive the new birth because there's no way to receive the new birth doubting any promise of God is there's no way no person in the Bible has ever found right standing in the presence of God with denying any part of his word now maybe it the whole thing wasn't revealed to them but whatever was revealed they accepted it in the ages they didn't have the full word but what they had they accepted it and that was enough to get them in the first resurrection don't brother Ram said don't say Luther didn't have the Holy Ghost he did don't say it was wasn't borning and he was even though he didn't have the whole word because you can't disbelieve what you don't know but when you can see it and God makes it plain you if you want to be born again you have to agree to it and let your life die out and come as a new a new creation am see so so he says um therefore we've got to take every word of God as thus sayith the Lord every word of God is true oops last one Church natural Church spiritual there is a church natural but these women here type and there's a church spiritual also so the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be hirs together they are twoo different separate times two different separate peoples under two different separate covenants so the church is is under the Lamb's Book the church is Under The Book of Life the bride is found in the LA the section of election in the Lamb's Book of Life that special section of election all right now so when we when we see this coming forth you know Paul says in Hebrews 121 wherefore seeing we also are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses see and I'm here to tell you something friends they're ready to be back Among Us I feel it the depths of my soul I believe that the world is is wrapping up and soon we'll be in glory oh this is a time to make your calling and election sure this is a time to check up this is a time to make sure the token not that you just have it but you have it on display that's the only thing the devil fears so you know so when so when brother brandham has given us those quotes that it's the queen it's the king and the queen that we read then then what will we do what is Our obligation I just said with Paul lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us how many will accept that say what sh what should we do St Paul and Paul would say purge yourself from ungodliness cast down vain imaginations flee youthful lust follow after righteousness it's then it's then it's then that the holy spirit will do the supernatural work of making the word to be spirit and life in your life amen that's the secret to fulfilling John 663 see the words that I give to you as Jesus said in St John 15 are logos but he comes right down in the seventh verse and now it's beginning to be something more than just the established word he's calling for you to become the word that's what I want his Spirit his life living within my life I want me out of the way oh God I want me out of the way oh I want to abide in him I'm I'm I'm wrapping up you still with me I want to finish can I do it I just need maybe 10 more minutes 15 at the most I'm sure I can see I can see the end we've talked a lot about Mary being the Prototype because remember it was ishmail I'm sorry it was Hagar then it was Sarah then brother brandham when he goes on to type it he gives the type that it's it's actually the bride it's you and I see who come by the ver virgin born word of God see and so so an Mary is actually the example for us to believe so the revelation of the word and our deep surrender to Christ right here at the Finish Line oh I wish I had a megaphone to the world right here at the Finish Line This is what is going to make us the Living Word that God can work through it's up to you friends or you want to be the Living Word word that God can work through you say yeah but but brother Jason Mary was highly favored what's the meaning of Grace the unmar favor she she's a type of you she couldn't produce that neither can you but she could believe it so can you God made it her into it he will you too Hallelujah you say oh I I I wish was there with Mary you are you are with Mary right now you're with Mary oh friends Mary being highly favored that was just a prototype for us because she could believe the impossible and I'm going to tell you something inspiration comes to the inspirable absolutely does so it's the Lamb's Book of his elected family see that's the one God is dealing with through the through the origin people people whose origin is from the word the the the same word that was with God and was God and then the next verse says the same was in the beginning with God it's not another Jesus it's a family brother brandham said when God said let us make man in our image he made his whole family you were right there in Genesis friends you were part of the word Jesus was the word you are in Christ he's the elected son I'm in Christ I came from him see so it's all the family of God whose origin was in Jesus at the beginning you know it's interesting because Scholars who are critics by the way generally speaking uh and I'm particularly talking about critics they claim they actually claim to be Christians but they actually claim claim that Jesus wasn't even Divine they claim that actually the real critics they claim that you know he brother B talks about how you know they said oh he just drank mandre weed and he didn't really die it was all a fake death remember that and they they teach that to this day it was all a fake death no he was just a man and that's gnosticism he was just a man and he in fact is after his fake death and then his fake Resurrection then he moved off to India and went up into India and you know married an Indian wife and settled down and had a family and raised children and died in obscurity that's what they actually believe now don't throw a RI a rock at me but you know they're they're right to a point he did go to India but not not in his body he went in the body of Thomas amen and he did have an Indian wife and he's still birthing wives in India today Hallelujah see it wasn't Jesus that died it was Thomas that died but Christ went into India in Thomas and he birthed an Indian nation of the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and he's still doing it today oh my friends I'm tell you they're scattered all around the world he's got disciples the lightning that started in the East has traveled to the west and we are observing it today I don't care what the critics say he lives I know he lives he lives in me oh my that same Jesus is alive today here he is in the furthest west amen I believe it we found out in our study that as brother brandham said there's another you I thought about that interestingly in a way that never occurred to me before for and it was almost amusing and I don't have a quote for it so you can throw it out if you want to but brother brandham said you know I found out there's another me he said there was another William brandham down in me now here's what we do know by the teaching of the word that the there's a one me that fails constantly there's another me that never does hallelujah and it's that other me that's got this me on a journey to a change yes oh Hallelujah there's another you oh I know you have mistakes but there's another you there's another you there's another one that doesn't disbelieve God's word and I thought to myself gee he's still sending them out two by two thought he sending them out two by two if if I'm not with anybody I'm with this old flesh but this ain't the real me Hallelujah there's another me that never doubts his word and always is an overcomer oh my brother brandham says here finally I got two slides left he says the Dynamics this is very familiar we read it a lot the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty friends we're so close to that rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies and now and then look what he says in this next one now the Dynamics of this great regime that they got built this big machine will work someday in the united Council of of the World Council of churches which will make a forcing see so so I can say to you today that that sure is moving at a pace then why would I not be so well I don't feel like him I don't care how you feel there's another you hallelujah it's not about this old man Hallelujah this world this body is not my home I got a Heavenly Body waiting Oh Glory to God friends this is exactly why that when the word of God when when the word of God comes to us it's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally can you witness that today say I can't even always explain it but I know whom I have believed you're going to need that kind of experience friends the deception is too great let me let me leave you with this as I go off the air you're going to need it yeah the deception that you face and that your children face is dire Jesus said there shall arise false Christ and false prophets they shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect a people so hypnotized by that Beast system that they're literally moving in concert with the ideology of the Beast himself as brother ma Matthew Watkins preached some time ago that's why it it's it's astonishing to us how can people read about the tribulation in this book and read what it does and read about the the false prophet and read about the Antichrist and how that he'll take over the world and the people will and how that the description is so clear how would they do it who in their right mind would do it that's just it they won't be in the right mind the very things that they're feeding off of right now yeah in Hollywood in social media in professional sports I'm here to tell you something something friends that stuff is a is a fountain of poison I understand we live lives I understand I get it we we have this connection and that connection but I'm here to tell you don't be deceived that Beast System is using that stuff to capture the minds of your family and your children social media is Rife with it oh no wonder we need a token applied home literally a false Revelation a great delusion as Jesus called it a great delusion so don't be caught off guard don't disregard this series nine Parts amen we're finishing today nine Parts don't be caught off guard the Lord has warned us that this is the hour when he's looking for total and complete surrender I want to do it how about you amen amen since I have the gene of God I can do it since I have the gene of God Mary's my Ken folk she's my family she's my kin only thing that separates us is time say oh I want to be there she wants to be here you understand as much as you want to go there that whole entire Heavenly Host is wanting to come back here they want to come back into bodies they want to come back on the earth hallelujah oh my I'm done I'm finished you can stand God bless you friends I think we've made our Point Clear overwhelming and repeated a lot of it enough and enough till I think the nail is clenched I just want my faith to be like her faith how about you amen the same word in me it was in her if that's true and the same anointing that was on her is on me and if that changed her mortal body did it did it change her mortal body sure did it not only changed her mortal body it filled her with the Holy Ghost gave her a word body she's living in now she's not the Queen of Heaven no the bride all down Through the Ages is the Queen of Heaven amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen say brother Jason after all that's over something for me brother Andrew after all that's over of coming You' convinced me that we've come to that final chapter and we have and the Earth is glad the Earth is Desiring to become new all nature is groaning for you and I to come into the fullness of adoption all the Earth is longing for it all those on the other side are longing for it God has literally rested the the last move on me and you amen gu volunteers today amen amen I'll take up that mantle Lord amen hands everywhere bow your heads with me Lord we realize that after it's all said and done and everything is finished then John says I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth I'm grateful for that Lord I'm Grateful to know that we are on our way there and nothing can by any means stop it I just lord it's not about your word getting stopped it's not about me losing my Redemptive position in Christ it's not about that it's not about me losing my Gene of God or or I've I've the Bible says I've passed from Death to life can never come into the the Judgment it's not about that Lord but it it's about this that some bring forth 30 some bring forth 60 some bring forth the 100 whatever you've ordained for me to be I want to be 100% of it may maybe you've only ordained some to be a 42 well then I if that's me I want to be 100% of that some maybe you've ordained to be a 78 maybe others a 96 maybe some Lord You've ordained to be a 100 then then I want to be whatever you want me to be I just don't want to come up short Lord I don't need to be more than I'm entitled to be I just want to be everything I'm entitled to be I thank you that I was able to finish this today I thank you that I believe in my heart that the teaching is there it's in nine Parts Lord It's it'll I'll stand on the day of judgment and give an account for it Lord I believe you taught it to me I believe that we underscored it with enough scriptures and enough quotes and I believe that Believers see it now Lord now my prayer is how many will crave it and desire it to the level that you're willing to say Lord less of me more of you less of me more of you till there's none of me left and it's all you I thank you today I thank you Lord as we prepare to change the order of the service and have a wonderful Victory Lord in a baptism but just before we
