TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; That's awesome. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Brother Luther, come on. [music] For you are great. [music] You do miracles so great. There is no one [singing and music] else like you. &gt;&gt; There is no one else like you. [music and singing] You are great. Do miracles so [singing and music] great. &gt;&gt; No one else. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. There is no one [music] else like you. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we come together in the name of Jesus Christ this morning, presenting ourselves before you, Father, Lord, that you could look to the cross and see white, pure and righteousness because of what you have done. We pray that your presence would just sweep through the building [music] this evening. Touch every ailing heart. Strengthen everyone. Encourage everyone, Father, to draw closer to you. For you are a good, good father. Lord, we love you this morning. We [music] pray that the words that would come forth would just be Holy Ghost inspired and feed us. Father, help the man to move aside. Lord Jesus. Lord, as we collect the tithes and offerings, I pray that you would bless the cheerful giver this morning, [music] we remember those that are fighting diseases, Father, cancers and lung things, [music] and Father, just ailments that come upon this weak pest house that we [music] dwell in.

[music] I feel the pool. I went to hear the word and with each line and praise he was drawing me to give a higher praise. There's a deep [music] call to the deep like a great magnet pulling me. [music] I know for sure that I've reached my goal cuz I feel the boom. [singing] [music] I feel the voice. [music] I hear the call. And I know his spirit [music] moving me to give my all. Amen. Oh, he speaks [music] to me and I [singing] &gt;&gt; Lord, please come [singing] and take control. &gt;&gt; I feel the &gt;&gt; I feel the &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I wonder if we could just go to the Lord in prayer. Master, how we thank you for that great pull of the word that we feel the pull in this hour. Lord, what would we do? The Bible said, "Had you not left us a seed, we also would be like unto Sodom and Gomorrah." I thank you, Lord, for the gospel that you sent to us, for the presence of the Holy Spirit, for the gene of the living God that lies within our soul. Master, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't stand a chance. We commit ourselves to you today for service. Now, we stand here before your people. Uh the vessel is quite unworthy, but you are worthy, Lord. And we're not here. I'm not here to give them my words, [music] only your words, Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray you'll bless the speaker and the hearer today. Give us hearing hearts. May we now just shut out the world and lay everything aside. The day will take care of itself. Sufficient is the day. It'll take care of itself. Lord, let us now arrest our mind from wondering thoughts and other activities. Now, we're coming down to be focused on your [music] word. So, I commit it to you now. Commit myself into your hands, Lord, for service to your kingdom. It to me, it's the greatest privilege, Lord, I could ever have. You gave me the greatest desire of my heart, Lord, since a young boy. This is all I ever wanted to be was your servant, Father. So, I commit it now. Commit myself into your hands and all the people for the word today. the hearing and receiving, the preaching, the hearing, the recognize, the recognizing, and the acting upon your [music] word. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. Praise the Lord. Want to um invite you to Isaiah chapter 14. And while you're turning there to Isaiah 14, we're going to just make a couple of quick announcements while I have you here before um the musicians are um dismissed to transition back around. Um you may notice um a new sign regarding the Sunday school class that takes place in the fellowship hall. You need to understand that this sign was approved by me. In case you see it and you wonder who had the audacity, it was approved by me. All right. Sunday school is 10:30 to to 11:15. Please refrain from using the fellowship hall during this time. If you need to place food in the fridge, please do so quickly and quietly. Whatever you do, don't be lingering out there when Sunday school is scheduled to start at 10:30. whether it has started or not. Clear the sun, clear the fellowship hall, please, and try to stay out of there until 11:15, unless you need to put food in there or you've got some other um official purpose. Amen. But we want to have our children be able to have an undisturbed lesson. Will that be all right? &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. Um we have a couple of prayer requests today and then I want to make one quick camp announcement. I want to ask you all uh for extra prayers uh for Sister Debbie. She made it here today. Amen. It didn't look promising, but the Lord was gracious. And she's suffering a lot from her hip, which has then which threw her gate off, which then threw her back out, which then causes the sciatica. So, you know, Brother Brandham said, when when the enemy thinks he's got you down, that's when he pours it on. So, um, she's been twice to an orthopedic. She's got one more appointment to go. And so, we just want to find the Lord's perfect mind. Will you do that? Amen. Praise the Lord. Sister Melissa would like a prayer cloth for a fellow teacher battling breast cancer diagnosis. So, um, to the brothers, the deacons, don't let me forget that. Wave at me. I've got it at the end of my notes, so hopefully I won't forget it. I want to make a quick camp announcement regarding camp. Um, so [clears throat] you're already aware that camp on the Sunday service on on October the 19th, we'll be at camp. So there won't be any Sunday service here. There'll be a Sunday service at camp which will be livereamed. But one of the things that I'm doing this year is I'm suspending the Wednesday prior and the Wednesday following camp. We always suspend the prior Wednesday because we basically have to take the church apart and all the brothers pull out all the equipment and all the instruments and everything and there's a big load up and so and then we've tried to do it on the Wednesday following camp but it's a mad dash to try to get everything back, get the church rebuilt and everybody feels like zombies already. The camp is taxing very very taxing. Amen. And we have loyal teams who have already been working for months just for those four days in the mountains with our young people. Um it's a it's it's it's a massive undertaking. It's we definitely are punching above our weight class. We're not a large church and when I walk around and look at what we pull off over there, I get scared to death looking at it. But every year the Lord comes on the scene and we have just a wonderful time. So, so to circle [snorts] back, Sunday the 12th will be the last service here until it resumes here on the 26th. There will be plenty of services. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; During those times, they just won't be held at 2608 Mossios Road. Amen. Is that pretty clear? &gt;&gt; And then, um, also a special announcement from the teams. Please, um, let's see which, let me get to it. Um yes. So this is concerning next Sunday. So not today, but this is for next Sunday when we do the load up. Following next Sunday's service, we have to take everything apart, load up the U-Haul, and please uh one brother sent it to me and he said, "Employ the people." I mean, implore the people, but it may be better to say employ the people, but nobody's getting paid. Implore the people. Amen. that we need all the help. Men, women, and children. Amen. So, um, so we want to everyone, everyone is needed. Make sure to specify brothers and sisters and children. We need all the hands we can possibly get. Amen. So, that'll be next Sunday. So, I hope that's clear. And, uh, we'll be pushing out um, messages on the church WhatsApp at any rate. So, you be in prayer for those things. Will you do it? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're happy today to have brother Jimmy here. Praise the Lord. And David and Michael are here. Now, they were just little guys since last time I saw him, so I'm not sure who's which. So, who? &gt;&gt; David. &gt;&gt; Which? &gt;&gt; Michael. David. Okay. So, David here. All right, everybody turn around. Michael's right here in the black shirt. Then Jimmy in the in the suit. And then David. I mean, yeah, David in a suit also. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's not hard to tell. Amen. Uh, whose boys they are. Praise the Lord. So, Sister Jennifer's family. Amen. [clears throat] Praise the Lord, Brother Jimmy. We've been trying to keep you, I mean, get you here for a long time. Amen. So, [laughter] Amen. Also happy to have the brother in the back and different ones. God bless you. We're happy to have visitors here. Amen. If I'm overlooking you, you forgive me. I'm bad for that. But, Amen. Let's look at our text in Isaiah chapter 14. Let's see. [clears throat] in Isaiah 14 and we'll just read a single verse and we'll let you be seated and we'll continue reading. Um, so brother Mark, I meant to start at Revelation 21. I'm sorry. Let's go to Revelation 21 1-7. In fact, I think that's what I sent the booth. Almost sure of that. [clears throat] I did. Yeah, my apologies. Revelation 21 1-7. Nothing like having a team ready and then you change change on a midstream. Amen. I appreciate uh our booth personnel, all the [clears throat] all of our wonderful teams and personnel. It's a camaraderie that's out of this world. Amen. Praise the Lord. Revelation 21 1-7. And we'll just catch this verse first verse. Want to preach to you today on Lucifer's competing claim. Lucifer's competing claim. Revelation 21 1-7. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. Father, we thank you for the beginning of reading in your word. And now, may your anointing be upon us as we look to go forward now. We go in your name in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. And uh we will continue uh reading our passage. Set all this out here to make sure that I don't forget anything. Amen. [clears throat] Verse two. Revelation 21 verse two. And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. Verse three. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; And he that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And he said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful. He that overcomemeth shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. Wonderful, wonderful promises. And this is a tremendous claim that God is making. I mean, he he didn't he didn't his language wasn't vague. He He's He's going to wipe away all tears. He's going to tabernacle himself with men. All the former things are going to be done away with. And whoever overcomes um will inherit all things and he'll be to them a god and they'll be to him a son. That's quite a claim. &gt;&gt; But now I want to take you today back to Isaiah chapter 14 because Lucifer has a competing claim against against God. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14 and we'll begin at verse 12. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning. How art thou cut down to the ground which d weakened the nations. For thou has set in thine heart, now here's his claim, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north. This a quite a counter claim &gt;&gt; to what we read in Revelation 21. &gt;&gt; I mean the the you know these are these are not mutually exclusive claims. They cannot both be true at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody's going to win and meet their claim, and somebody's going to lose and fail to meet their claim. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they're both claiming. &gt;&gt; Verse 14 again. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit, that they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms, that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, that opened not the house of his prisoners? All the kings of the nations, even all of them lie in glory, everyone in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raignment of those that are slain, thrust through with the sword that go down to the stones of the pit, as a carcass trotten under feet. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people. The seed of evildoers shall never be renowned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's interesting that the Bible would refer to Lucifer here being brought forth for slaughter and the world would see him as a man. Now, you know, there's nothing in the Bible that's accidental, but when I read that, it's not lost on me that remember that Lucifer is was an angel. He was an archangel was not a a human man. And so, the very fact that the Bible is showing that Lucifer in a perfect counterfeit operates through man just like the Holy Spirit operates through man. Amen. So God is a spirit and God lives in his family and and and we find that ONCE THE HOLY GHOST CAME on the on the earth. Then once again the word was made flesh in a many member bride JUST LIKE IT WAS MADE FLESH in Jesus of Nazareth and he went about doing good. But we know that HE WAS NEVER INTENDING. GOD WAS NEVER INTENDING TO stay bottled up in one man walking THE SHORES OF GALILEE GOING ABOUT DOING GOOD. NOW THE PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO STAY. THEY WANTED TO MAKE HIM A KING. AND HE KEPT SAYING TO THEM, "IT'S BETTER FOR YOU IF I GO AWAY." WE HAD THAT here recently. I think it was uh BROTHER BENNY PERHAPS WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT IT'S UH IT'S TO YOUR ADVANTAGE THAT HE SUFFER AND DIE. IT'S TO YOUR ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IF HE IF HE DIES THEN HE CAN RESURRECT AND IF HE RESURRECTS THEN HE CAN EMPTY PARADISE AND THEN IF HE ASCENDS AND COMES BACK THEN HE CAN GET THE WHOLE FAMILY. &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY THAT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS A REALLY GOOD THING AND YOU SHOULD SEEK IT WITH ALL THAT IS WITHIN YOU. IT IS WHAT ADOPTS YOU INTO THE FAMILY AND MAKES YOU A SON OF GOD THAT GOD PROMISED WHOEVER WOULD OVERCOME WOULD I WILL BE HIS GOD AND HE WILL BE MY SON. I KNOW LUCIFER MADE A COUNTER CLAIM BACK THERE THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. MY PROPHET OUTED HIM TOLD YOU THE SECRET IN HIS HEART. THAT WAS HIS CLAIM. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I'M MAKING ANOTHER CLAIM THAT I'M MAKING ALL THINGS NEW AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A people &gt;&gt; who ARE GOING TO BE MY FAMILY. THESE ARE THESE ARE SOME SERIOUS COUNTER CLAIMS. I DON'T THINK YOU COULD GET MORE POLAR OPPOSITES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Than the claim that Lucifer made versus the claim that God made. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you read Isaiah 14, it is it it it literally is a UM ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET DOWN AROUND VERSE FOUR AND ON. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DROP BACK AND read it, BUT WHEN YOU GO FOR GO from there, VERSE FOUR SAYS THAT THOU SHALT TAKE UP THIS proverb against the king of Babylon. So, right away, the prophet is going to speaking under inspiration IS GOING TO symbolize Lucifer because a LITTLE BIT LATER, 10 VERSES LATER, HE IDENTIFIES WHO HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HOW ART THOU fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer? Oh, wait. I thought he's TALKING ABOUT THE KING OF BABYLON. HE WAS THE KING OF BABYLON IS JUST A PLACEHOLDER. REMEMBER, IT'S SATAN OPERATING THROUGH PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; IS THIS THE MAN THAT DESTROYED THE WORLD? and and you know THE THE THE YOU DON'T FIND ANYBODY SAYING, "HEY, GOD, IT WAS ALL HIM. WE'RE JUST INNOCENT BYSTANDERS." BUT THE BUT BUT THE FACT IS THAT THEY ALLOWED SATAN TO HAVE A DOMINION IN THEIR MIND AND THEY CHOSE WHEN THEY KNEW GOD AS GOD. THE BIBLE SAYS THEY MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE NOT TO WORSHIP HIM AS GOD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BIBLE'S CLEAR on that. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES, UH, ATHEISTS WHO AND PEOPLE WHO HATE THE BIBLE, THEY THEY GO BACK AND THEY TALK ABOUT PREDESTINATION OR ELECTION. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND election by origin. It's why they it's why it's in Congress to them. But, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY, "HEY, YOU KNOW, UH, WHY WOULD YOU BLAME PHARAOH? WHY DOES PHARAOH HAVE TO end up in hell?" Because the Bible says Pharaoh descends down into the pit. &gt;&gt; Why? That's not fair. Because God hardened HIS HEART. BUT SIX TIMES AT LEAST FIVE AND MAYBE SIX BEFORE GOD EVER HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART THE FIRST TIME. FIVE OR SIX TIMES PRIOR TO THAT PHARAOH HARDENED HIS OWN HEART. &gt;&gt; See that's the scripture. &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ IT, READ all of it. See, SO WHEN JESUS COMES AND SAYS, YOU KNOW, UH, THUS IS FULFILLED IN YOU PHARISEES THE SAYING OF THE PROPHET, IN SEEING THEY SEE NOT, AND IN HEARING THEY HEAR NOT, LEST THEY SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS AND AND BELIEVE AND BE CONVERTED AND I WOULD HAVE TO HEAL THEM. &gt;&gt; BUT BUT HE GOES BACK AND JESUS ADDS AN ADDENDUM TO THE VERSE THAT THE PROPHET DIDN'T SAY. WHEN JESUS QUOTES IT, HE SAYS, "THEIR EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LEST THEY SHOULD SEE &gt;&gt; AND HEAR. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THIS IS WHERE PAUL GOES BACK TO THESE ANCIENT PEOPLE BECAUSE WHEN THEY KNEW GOD, THEY CHOSE NOT TO WORSHIP HIM AS GOD. THEY DIDN'T WANT GOD IN THEIR THINKING. AND THEREFORE, GOD SAYS, "OKAY, FINE. I GAVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY, BUT NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT MY WORD, YOU CROSS THAT LINE FOR THE LAST TIME, THEN I WILL BLIND YOU AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY WORD. I'LL HARDEN YOUR HEART AND YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE MY WORD. BUT YOU WILL BELIEVE SOMETHING ONLY IT'LL BE A LIE. YOU'LL BE BELIEVE A COUNTER CLAIM. YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH A COUNTERPERSON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT. AS PAUL SAID, MY FEAR OF THE CHURCH IS THAT YOU'LL FOLLOW ANOTHER JESUS WHO IS NOT ONE I PREACHED to you, &gt;&gt; a different one. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE SAY, "I JUST WANT JESUS." AND I SAY, "WELL, WHICH ONE?" &gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT THERE WAS ONLY ONE. NOT ACCORDING TO ST. PAUL, THERE WAS ANOTHER JESUS, A MAN-MADE CREATION OF ORGANIZED RELIGION. THIS VERY [screaming] KING OF BABYLON, WHICH WAS REALLY LUCIFER, IS BEHIND IT ALL. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HERE, FRIENDS, IN A IN AN EPIC BATTLE OF EPIC PROPORTION. AND THIS THING IS ANCIENT AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MULTIPLE MILLENNIA, BUT IT'S COMING TO A CLIMAX. &gt;&gt; AND SOMEBODY'S CLAIM IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO FORWARD. IT'LL EITHER BE LUCIFER'S OR IT'LL BE GOD'S. &gt;&gt; WHOSE CLAIM YOU WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH? &gt;&gt; ME, TOO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH GOD, YOU HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, WHEN HE GOES TALKING ABOUT BABYLON AND THEN YOU READ DOWN where where we read in our description, my goodness, you're not even going to GET A DECENT BURIAL. YOU'RE GOING TO DESCEND DOWN. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK NARROWLY UPON YOU. WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO LET YOU BE BURIED. YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE A COMPLETE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO HONOR YOU WITH A GRAVE. SEE, NOW TH THIS IS A LOT. THIS IS QUITE A LOT TO DO TO ONE NATION and its ruler WHEN YOU THINK OF BABYLON. UH AND IF IT WERE NOT THAT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE A VERY ANCIENT BEAST SYSTEM OF ANTICHRIST, IT WOULD SEEM LIKE UNEQUAL JUSTICE. &gt;&gt; The description of WHERE WE READ IN ISAIAH 14 SEEMS LIKE ALMOST CRUEL and unusual punishment uh disproportionate to the crimes that Babylon committed. REMEMBER THAT ANCIENT BABYLON WAS NOT THE ONLY oppressor recorded in history and IN FACT IN SCALE IT WAS NOT EVEN THE WORST TIME OF SUFFERING HUMANITY. UH SO WE ARE WITNESSING HERE IN ISAIAH 14 WHAT SURELY MUST NOT BE REFERRING TO AN ANCIENT NATION BUT WE'RE READING THE DEMISE OR LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS YOU'RE READING THE FINAL END OF LUCIFER'S REIGN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD IS DONE WITH him &gt;&gt; and I'm can't wait &gt;&gt; KNOW FROM GOD'S WORD OF COURSE that there are three ACTUALLY DESTRUCTIONS OF BABYLON. YOU HAVE DURING THE 6TH CENTURY BC 539 to be exact. Uh you have the ancient Babylonian Empire which we know was overthrown by the Meo Persian Empire. Now this is not to be confused with the the what they call the old Babylon which was pretty much 1100 more than a millennium uh previous. [clears throat] This was the time of Nebuchadnezzar and and and Beltazar and and and THIS WAS A RESURGENT BABYLON JUST LIKE NOW THAT'S NOT THAT SHOULDN'T YOU SAY YOU MEAN BABYLON existed 1100 years PRIOR TO THE ONE THAT THE MEO PERSIANS SACKED? YEAH. THAT WHAT YOU'RE READING THE ONE THE ME PER THAT THAT ONE ONLY LASTED LESS THAN A CENTURY &gt;&gt; AND IT'S IN THE BIBLE THE OTHER ONE IS IS JUST A FOOTNOTE IN HISTORY YOU SEE WHAT YOU REALIZE IS FRIENDS UM IS [clears throat] IF I SAY IT LIKE THIS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY ON GOD'S CALENDAR UNTIL YOU ARE &gt;&gt; UNTIL TIME MEETS PROPHECY &gt;&gt; AND GOD STARTS COUNTING AND HE PUTS MARKERS OUT SO THAT SO THAT HE CAN SO THAT HE KEEPS TRACK OF HISTORY AND AND OUR AND THE FAMILY CAN LOOK BACK AND LEARN, OH, THIS MEANT THIS AND THIS MEANT THIS AND THIS MUST BE WHERE WE ARE NOW. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; SAY, you don't HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT. DANIEL DID IT. &gt;&gt; DANIEL, BY THE STUDY OF BOOKS, HE LEARNED THAT, HEY, WE'RE ALMOST AT THE END. 70 YEARS IS COMING UP AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUT OF HERE IF THE PROPHECY IS TRUE. &gt;&gt; SO, [clears throat] IT'S A RESURGENT BABYLON. SEE, IT'S JUST LIKE IT'S JUST LIKE REVELATION 13 BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER THAT THAT AN BABYLON WHICH WAS SPIRITUAL BABYLON SPOKEN OF IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION, WE'LL GET to it in a minute. That that IS A RELIGIOUS SYSTEM. REMEMBER, IT WAS in Imperial Rome. IT WAS A A REPUBLIC. THEN BY THE TIME YOU GET TO A TO AUGUSTUS, NOW IT'S AN EMPIRE. AND IT AND IT'S IMPERIAL AND AND POLITICAL ROME ENDS. AND THEN PAP ROME COMES ON THE SCENE. AND THAT'S ALL HAPPENING OVER IN EUROPE BECAUSE THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT THAT BEAST SYSTEM ROSE UP OUT OF THE SEA WHICH WAS MANY PEOPLES, MULTITUDES, AND NATIONS. BUT WHEN YOU GET TO REVELATION 13, YOU GO ON DOWN INTO REVELATION 13, YOU FIND OUT THAT ANOTHER BEAST CAME UP THAT LOOKED LIKE A lamb &gt;&gt; and IT ROSE UP OUT OF THE LAND, NOT THE SEA WHERE THERE WERE NO ESTABLISHED CIVILIZED NATIONS. HE HAD AN INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. SO, IT'S JUST SATAN, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE HE GOT A WOUNDED HEAD &gt;&gt; AND BUT AND BECAUSE WHEN ROME FALLS AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE SUCCESSIVE UH YEARS OF OF THE PAPACY, BUT IT COMES ACROSS THE POND AND IT RESURGES HERE IN AMERICA. LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT'S THE WAY SATAN DOES. WHETHER HE'S OLD BABYLON OR WHETHER HE COMES BACK TO BE ANCIENT BABYLON OR WHETHER HE'S FINISHED IN EUROPE, BUT THEN HE COMES BACK HERE. LISTEN, WHETHER OR NOT THE HOLY GHOST CAME DOWN AND CLEANED UP YOUR LIFE AND BROUGHT YOU INTO THE PHONE, DON'T THINK SATAN WON'T TRY A RESURGENCE. &gt;&gt; DON'T THINK HE'LL JUST GO AWAY QUIETLY AND SAY, "OH, I LOST ANOTHER ONE." HE'LL CHASE YOU AND HOUND YOU AND TEMPT YOU. WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO? HE'S TRYING TO BRING YOU BACK UNDER HIS CONTROL. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I GOT THE HOLY GHOST." BUT YOU'VE GOT TO EMPLOY THE Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; first of all. YOU GOT TO FEED THE HOLY GHOST. MAKE HIM STRONG. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He feeds on the word. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So you needn't THINK THAT HE JUST BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT CLEANS YOU UP THAT SATAN WILL SOMEHOW GO AWAY IN QUIET DEFEAT. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THIS IS A RESURGENT BABYLON, NOT THE OLD BABYLON. UH AND AND SO BY BY THE TIME THE THE BABYLON COMES ON THE SCENE THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO HERE, UM YOU KNOW, GOD HAS GOT IT ON THE CALENDAR. SO, IT'S IMPORTANT that your life follow prophecy. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU BE the living WORD &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S THE ONLY LIFE THAT COUNTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; As far as God is concerned, it's the only LIFE THAT THAT THAT he he IS HE'S MOVING ACCORDING TO PROPHECY. SO, I I'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES I'LL GET TO HERE. BUT BUT BUT YOU REALIZE THEN THAT THAT AND AND NOW, OF COURSE, I WANT TO MAKE THIS I WANT TO SAY THIS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT all those lives of old Babylon weren't precious TO GOD BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT ALL LIFE is precious to God. SO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY DON'T COUNT, BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT GOD MOVES DIRECTLY ON THE SCENE WHEN TIME MEETS PROPHECY FROM HIS WORD. I MEAN, HE CAME TO ABRAHAM FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN WHEN THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH AND DISCERN THE SECRETS OF SARAH'S HEART. HE DIDN'T DO THAT IN CHAPTER 12 OR CHAPTER 13 OR 14 OR 15 BECAUSE THAT WASN'T ON THE CALENDAR OF PROPHECY. BUT WHEN THE WHEN TIME MET PROPHECY, HE CAME WALKING TO ABRAHAM IN THE COOL OF THE DAY. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T COME TO MOSES. MOSES TRIED TO OPERATE BECAUSE WHAT HIS MOTHER TOLD HIM, YOU'RE A SPECIAL CHILD. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A DELIVERER. HE TRIED TO MAKE THAT WORK, IT DIDN'T WORK. HE HAD TO RUN INTO THE WILDERNESS. BUT WHEN TIME MET PROPHECY AND HE'S WALKING DOWN A PATH AND SUDDENLY HE HEARS THE SOUND OF A CRACKLING FLAME. NOW [screaming] GOD IS ON THE SCENE. YES. Praise God. &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO JOHN IN THE EXACT SAME WAY WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE ONE TO COME FROM THE WILDERNESS. HE CAME TO AN UPPER ROOM ON EXACTLY THE 50TH DAY &gt;&gt; OF SHABBAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE FEAST OF PENTECOST. 50 DAYS EXACTLY AFTER THE PASSOVER AND AND FROM THE TIME HE'S MADE A SACRIFICE AND RISES FROM THE TOMB 50 DAYS LATER ON PENTECOST GOD COMES DOWN ON THE SCENE TO DO WHAT? TO DO WHAT? MAKE [screaming] HIS WORD LIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD HE CAME TO THE SEVEN CHURCH AGE MESSENGERS. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GLAD FOR THAT? &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T COME EARLY. HE DIDN'T COME LATE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, HE HAS COME TO THE BRIDE HERE AT THE END OF THE LAST AGE TO DO WHAT? TO CREATE IN HER? A VOICE FOR THE LAST AGE. &gt;&gt; A VOICE FOR THE FINAL AGE. YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T BECOME THAT. GOD [screaming] HAS COME ON THE SCENE &gt;&gt; TO TO CREATE IN YOU A VOICE OF THE FINAL AGE. &gt;&gt; I think I've made my point. I want to move on. SATAN WATCHES FOR THESE TIMES. That's why he THAT HE THAT'S WHY HE ALREADY HAS THE ENTIRE world under his control. &gt;&gt; But he won't leave you alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why BECAUSE HE ALSO WATCHES FOR THESE TIMES. HE ALSO HE WASN'T SURE THAT JESUS WAS THE ONE. IF YOU ARE, IF YOU ARE, IF YOU ARE. AND HE GOES ALL THE WAY TO CALVARY AND HE FINALLY SIGNS OFF ON DEATH TO TAKE HIM. ALL RIGHT. HERE. YEAH. LET ME SIGN LET ME SIGN THE EXECUTION ORDER. HE'S NOT the one. Don't worry about it. Take him. Big mistake. &gt;&gt; OH, HOW HE'D like to undo THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE HOW HE'D LIKE TO UNDO THOSE STRIPES THAT HEAL YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE CAN'T UNDO IT. AND IF YOU'RE SICK, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY BY HIS STRIPES, I AM HEALED. &gt;&gt; HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE BACK DEATH. BECAUSE IF HE COULD TAKE BACK DEATH, HE TAKES BACK A RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH. BUT I'M GLAD JESUS [screaming] DIED AND HE ROSE AND HE ASCENDED AND HE CAME DOWN INTO HIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE ARE AT THE END TIME AND SATAN HAS BEEN WATCHING ALL ALONG LIKE YOU HAVE. &gt;&gt; He's very KEEN TO THE SCRIPTURES. HE'S A HE'S A THEOLOGIAN OF THEOLOGIANS. HE WATCHES IT. You see, HE HE HAS THE WHOLE WORLD. HE'S THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE. THIS IS FULLY SATAN'S EDEN. NOW, HE'S HAD 6,000 YEARS. JUST LIKE GOD TOOK 6,000 years to BUILD HIS EDEN. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM SHOWS THAT NOW GOD HAS GIVEN Satan 6,000 years. &gt;&gt; These are things that make our day unique. You see, we don't have a different message than Paul. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A GREATER REVELATION THAN PAUL, &gt;&gt; BUT IN PAUL'S DAY, THAT CHURCH HAD TO GO INTO THE GROUND &gt;&gt; FOR ONE REASON, BECAUSE THE SEED HAD TO GO INTO THE GROUND AND DIE TO BRING FORTH. &gt;&gt; BUT IT ALSO ACCOMPLISHED GOD'S PROPERNESS AND THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T TRY TO TAKE SATAN OUT WHEN HE'S ONLY HAD 4,000 YEARS. &gt;&gt; He's going to GIVE HIM THE FULL 6,000 YEARS. HE'S GOING TO ALLOW HIM. HE'S GOING TO ALLOW SATAN TO GO BACK INTO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY AND PULL OUT HIS ANTIDOLUVIAN PLAYBOOK AND GO INTO ANOTHER DUST BIN OF HISTORY AND PULL OUT HIS SODOM AND GOMORRAH PLAYBOOK AND HE'S GOING TO MASH HIM UP AND HAVE AI WRITE HIM ONE BIG MANUAL AND HE'S GOING TO COME AFTER THE BRIDE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE WORD OF GOD IS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AND THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM. AND THE REASON HE HAS THE WHOLE WORLD AND WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE IS BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY THING HE FEARS. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO HIM BEING ABLE TO ASCEND THE THRONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S HOW GOD HAS [screaming] ORDAINED THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; TO BE PLAYED OUT IN MY LIFE, YOUR LIFE. THAT'S HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE GOD HAS IN YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not coming back to suffer the penalty of sin again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THAT HE DIED, HE DIETH NO MORE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SEE, HIS CONFIDENCE IS SO GREAT THAT HE ALREADY KNOWS ALL HE HAS TO DO IS COME ON THE SCENE AND HIS FAMILY WILL hear the certain sound. &gt;&gt; THEY WON'T LISTEN TO AN UNCERTAIN SOUND. MY SHEEP KNOW MY VOICE. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S MAN-MADE. I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. OH, BUT WHEN YOU HEAR WHEN YOU HEAR RECOGNIZING YOUR DAY AND ITS MESSAGE, SUDDENLY, OH, THAT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HIS ONLY OBSTACLE. YOU'RE THE ONLY THING THAT THREATENS HIM. YEAH. &gt;&gt; OH, I wish I wish that we could IN MOMENTS WHEN THE ENEMY COMES IN LIKE A FLOOD MAKES US TRIES TO MAKE US FEARFUL. &gt;&gt; SYMPTOMS OF THIS AND PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND EPISODES OF THIS AND UH THIS KIND OF A A THING GOING ON AND THAT GOING ON UNTIL IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SWALLOWED UP AND BURIED OVER BY THE WAVES AND AND REMEMBER THEY TRIED THAT ON JESUS. OH, BUT IF YOU COULD REALIZE THAT SATAN IS DOING THAT BECAUSE YOU THREATENED HIM. AND IF YOU COULD STAND UP LIKE JESUS DID IN THE BOAT AND SAY, "PEACE, BE STILL. I AM IN CHARGE HERE. I'M THE SON OF GOD. I'M THE ONE WITH THE WORD ON MY LIPS. IF I SPEAK, THAT'S LIKE GOD SPEAKING." &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT SATAN IS AFRAID. HE'S AFRAID YOU WILL RECOGNIZE WHO YOU ARE AND THAT YOU CAN DO THE MIGHTY WORKS BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOU [screaming] BECOME AN INVINCIBLE ARMY AND HE WILL NEVER GET HIS THRONE. &gt;&gt; HE'S AFRAID OF YOU, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. &gt;&gt; SO THE ANCIENT BABYLON CEASES TO EXIST. THE MEO PERSIANS TAKE IT, [sighs] but you can't you you can't end or kill the Antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; They ended that nation as a world power, BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THE ANTICHRIST SPIRIT. And so it IT IT SURVIVES. IT CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE WORLD THROUGH SUCCESSIVE EMPIRES, THROUGH THE MEO PERSIAN EMPIRE, THROUGH THE GRECIAN EMPIRE. DANIEL LAID IT ALL OUT IN PROPHECY VERY CLEARLY. It all fits perfectly. BUT FINALLY, DANIEL AFTER HE IS ABLE TO DISCERN THREE DISTINCT ANIMALS THAT ARE VERY CLEAR. THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE NATURAL. HE CAN SEE, YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS WHAT A LION IS. HE KNOWS WHAT AN EAGLE IS. HE KNOWS WHAT A BEAR IS. HE KNOWS WHAT A LEOPARD IS. HE'S GOT HE HE UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THESE THINGS, YOU UNDERSTAND? HE KNOWS WHAT A RAM IS. HE KNOWS WHAT A GOAT IS. DANIEL HAD NO TROUBLE IDENTIFYING THOSE THINGS. AND THEN suddenly he comes to a creature and it's like I don't know. &gt;&gt; I never seen anything like that. &gt;&gt; What does he look like, Daniel? WELL, HE'S HE'S TERRIBLE. HE'S GOT IRON TEETH AND HE'S BIG AND HE'S VERY FIERCE AND SCARY. OH, SURELY HE WON'T BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND UH THE OTHER BEAST. HE ANNIHILATES THEM. &gt;&gt; HE TAKES OVER THE WHOLE WORLD AND RUNS ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE END TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IT'S OBVIOUS THEN THAT IT REEMERGES LATER IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND AND AND THEN THAT FROM POLITICAL TO PAPEL AND THEN AT THE END TIME THE BOOK OF REVELATION WOULD IDENTIFY IT AS A WORLDWIDE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. known as Revelation 17:5, known as mystery Babylon, the great, the mother of harlots AND ABOMINATIONS OF the earth. SO IT'S CLEAR THAT HE HAS NOW COME ALONG AND THAT SPIRIT OF ANTICHRIST IS NOW WORKING IN A CHURCH THAT HAS GLOBAL INFLUENCE ALONG WITH ALL OF HER UH YOU KNOW NOT NOT NOT ONLY NOT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ALONG WITH ALL OF HER HIS HER OFFSPRING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S NOT JUST HER BUT SHE'S THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS. SO SHE HAS DAUGHTERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THOSE ARE ALSO CHURCHES. AND THAT AND THAT'S WHY GOD HATES ORGANIZED RELIGION. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY LUCIFER LOVES ORGANIZED RELIGION. &gt;&gt; HE LOVES ORGANIZED RELIGION BECAUSE ORGANIZED RELIGION IS CONTROLLED BY MEN. AND ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS GET IN THE MEN AND THEN HE CAN RUIN THE WORLD. I'M GLAD THAT GOD SENDS THE HOLY GHOST TO LEAD HIS CHURCH. AND IF A MAN WON'T FOLLOW THE HOLY GHOST, GOD WILL RAISE UP ANOTHER ONE WHO WILL FOLLOW THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THE HOLY GHOST WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. HE HAS NEVER BEEN DEFEATED. HE WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. HE HAS MADE A CLAIM [screaming] AND HE'S GOING TO SEE IT THROUGH. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; HE GOES FORTH IN ORGANIZED RELIGION. WE CAN SEE THAT IN DANIEL AND REVELATION VERY CLEARLY. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO teach on it today. BY EXTENSION, HE RULES ALL NATIONS AND PEOPLES OF THE EARTH WHO ACCORDING TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION ARE KNOWN BECAUSE THEY WORSHIP HER IMAGE. THEY TAKE HIS MARK AND THEY GO DOWN WITH HIM IN THE TRIBULATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE TRIBULATION PERIOD, THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF IT AS A TIME LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN. IN A MERE THREE AND A HALF YEARS, IT ENDS ALL LIFE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's quite a three and a half years. &gt;&gt; There's [snorts] been some very impactful GENOCIDAL ARMIES that have swept the world, conquered, POURED PEOPLE BY THE MILLIONS INTO GRAVES, AND THE ONES THAT LIVE WENT INTO SLAVERY. IN AND AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON UH TIME IMMEMORIAL SINCE SINCE TIME BEGAN &gt;&gt; SINCE SINCE NIMROD WAS THE FIRST ONE TO CARRY WAR TO HIS neighbors &gt;&gt; because that spirit of antichrist see &gt;&gt; and so SO WE FIND NIMROD CARRIES WAR TO HIS NEIGHBORS COMING OUT OF THE flood so it SO THREE AND A HALF YEARS BRINGS TO A GRUESOME END 6,000 YEARS OF mire and filth, of sin, &gt;&gt; WITH ALL NATURE GROANING TO BE FREE. ALL THE TRIBULATION ENDED A STATE OF SINFULNESS AND PERVERSION THAT HAS BEEN UNPARALLELED IN HISTORY, EVEN MORE THAN THE DAYS OF NOAH, EVEN MORE THAN THE DAYS OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH. AND IN FACT IS WHEN WE READ IT FROM THE BIBLE, WE FIND THAT IT ALL CONCLUDED AS A DARKNESS THAT covered the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A blindness AND AN INSANITY. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GO READ ISAIAH 60. A DARKNESS THAT COVERS THE WHOLE WORLD AND A GROSS DARKNESS, A BLINDNESS AND INSANITY SO DEEP THAT THAT THAT BEGINS TO CONTROL THE MINDS AND AND AND IT INFECTS THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND IT LITERALLY ACCORDING TO PROPHECY REACHES ALL CORNERS OF CIVILIZATION. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; I want an exodus. I'm looking for a third exodus. All nature groaning. A blindness AND INSANITY THAT IN FACT IS IS RUNS SO deep that literally this beast system. YOU'LL FIND THAT WHEN THE BRIDE IS GONE, WHATEVER RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE ARE LEFT ON THE earth are ACTUALLY A BLINDNESS OVERTAKES SOCIETY TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY HUNT THEM DOWN LIKE DOGS &gt;&gt; AND PUT THEM TO DEATH TO THE LAST MAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL WHO WOULD NOT BOW the knee after the bride has been taken in the rapture IN THE SHORT SPACE OF 42 months the world WOULD WITNESS. THINK ABOUT THIS. I CHANGED THIS SENTENCE SEVERAL TIMES FOR THE IMPACT I WANT IT TO HAVE ON YOU. IN JUST A SHORT SPACE OF 42 MONTHS, THIS IS HOW DEEP THE BLINDNESS GOES. THIS IS HOW PERVASIVE THE BLINDNESS IS. THAT IN JUST THE SPACE, THE SHORT SPACE OF 42 MONTHS, THE WORLD WILL WITNESS A COMPLETE EXTERMINATION OF ALL remaining righteous peoples, &gt;&gt; INCLUDING AND NOT LIMITED TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNWISE VIRGIN WHO WILL NOT WORSHIP HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE TRUE THE TWO GREAT PROPHETS OF GOD, MOSES AND ELIJAH, AND THE ENTIRE 144,000 ELECTED JEWS &gt;&gt; IN 42 MONTHS. &gt;&gt; THE COMPLETE EXTERMINATION. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GENOCIDE. THEY THREW THAT WORD AROUND TODAY. IT'S JUST A POLITICAL TERM. THIS IS GENOCIDE FOR REAL. &gt;&gt; WHERE IMAGINE LIVING IN A WORLD, NO WONDER GOD'S GOING TO DESTROY IT. IT WON'T HAVE ONE SINGLE SOLITARY RIGHTEOUS PERSON LEFT ALIVE. If you think the world can't get more crazy, you'd be wrong. Lastly, AND FINALLY, AT THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM, NOW WE'RE IN THE THIRD. WE HAD, you know, Babylon the ANCIENT DESTROYED AND THEN HE GOES THROUGH THE OTHER KINGDOMS AND HE ENDS UP IN Rome and HE BUILDS HIS IMAGE HERE IN REVELATION 13 UNITED STATES HERE. THEY HAVE AN IMAGE AND THEY CONTROL THE WORLD THROUGH COMMERCE. THEY DESTROY ALL OF THE RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE. AND LASTLY, THIRDLY, FINALLY AT THE THEN WE THEN OF COURSE AFTER THE TRIBULATION, WE GO INTO THE MILLENNIUM. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE millennium uh AND YOU HAVE THE GREAT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT WHERE THE FINAL SENTENCE OF EVERYTHING IS CARRIED out and the BEAST AND THE FALSE PROPHET ARE CONSUMED IN THE LAKE OF FIRE &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE CAST IN WITH DEATH AND HELL. HALLELUJAH. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU DEATH AND HELL WHEN ONCE THAT'S CAST IN AND ALL THINGS THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL WORD ARE CONSUMED FOREVER. AND THEN JOHN SAYS, I SAW A NEW HEAVEN &gt;&gt; AND A NEW EARTH. HALLELUJAH. AND GOD HIMSELF DWELLING WITH MAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE GREAT GOD OF CREATION. THINK ABOUT THAT FRIENDS. THE GREAT GOD OF CREATION, THE WHO SPOKE INTO EXISTENCE EVERYTHING BY HIS WORD AND NOW HE'S IN HIS COMPLETENESS THROUGHOUT ALL CREATION FROM THERE going forward. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER EVEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO and I was AND I I WAS CONFESSING TO YOU, YOU KNOW, WHEN I GET TO REVELATION 21 AND GOD HIMSELF SHALL DWELL AND I AND AND BE ON THE EARTH AND HE SHALL DWELL WITH MAN. AND I SAID TO YOU, IT'S THE ONLY PLACE IN THE BIBLE. IT DOESN'T SAY THAT ANYWHERE. IT'S AND and and I was, YOU KNOW, TRYING AND I THOUGHT, IT'S JUST CLOUDY. IT SEEMS MYSTERIOUS TO ME. I CAN'T SEEM TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. WHY IS IT THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THERE UNDER A NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH THAT HASN'T EXACTLY BEEN TO THAT LEVEL? AND SO, SO WE REALIZE THAT AND AND AS I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THAT, THEN I REMEMBERED AND I WAS STUDYING AND I THOUGHT, MY GOODNESS, how how childish. I REALIZED BROTHER BRANDHAM GAVE ME THE PERFECT CLUE AND LITERALLY SPELLED THE WHOLE THING OUT SO THAT IT JUST SUDDENLY MAKES SENSE TO ME. All right, you you with me? &gt;&gt; YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER 15 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; HEY, I used UP SOME OF MY TIMES FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS. THAT DON'T COUNT. &gt;&gt; Y'all haven't this. Y'all have like four services without me, so I should be able to preach double. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] SO, SO WE FIND THEN NOW THAT THIS GOD OF CREATION, THE SAME ONE WHO SPOKE IT ALL INTO EXISTENCE BY HIS WORD. SO IT SO WHEN WHEN WE I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE REASON I SEEM MYSTERIOUS I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK like because OKAY [clears throat] HE'S A SPIRIT BUT THEN THERE'S JESUS AND THEN IF HE'S I MEAN HOW THEN THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND BROTHER BRANDHAM MAKES SOME SOME STATEMENTS AND IF YOU DON'T TIE THEM ALL TOGETHER THEN THEY CAN BE SOMEWHAT CONFUSING. IT DIDN'T IT DOESN'T STOP MY SALVATION. DOESN'T GOING TO STOP ME FROM GOING TO THE RAPTURE. BUT I JUST I JUST THOUGHT TO MYSELF THERE THERE'S SOMETHING LAYING THERE. I'M SURE. AND AS I BEGIN TO PONDER THAT, I REALIZE IT'S NOT ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT FULLY LOOKS LIKE. YOU KNOW, HIS FORM or or WHAT FORM THAT IS OR HOW IT RELATES TO JESUS. BUT BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO NOTICE IS FIRST THING, LET ME GIVE YOU THIS CLUE IS THAT IT'S HIS PLAN OF REDEMPTION IS NOW FULFILLED. SO HIS PEOPLE, ALL THE NAMES IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE ARE REDEEMED. &gt;&gt; The earth is redeemed. &gt;&gt; EVERY PROMISE IS NOW MADE GOOD. SATAN HAS BEEN DESTROYED. DEATH AND HELL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. A NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH ARE NOW UNDERWAY. AND GOD HIMSELF, ALL OF HIS CHARACTER, ALL OF HIS, AS BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, ALL OF HIS CHARACTERISTICS, HIS REDEMPTIVE NAMES, ALL OF THOSE REDEMPTIVE NAMES, JEHOVAH GYRA, JEHOVAH RAFA, JEHOVAH SHALOM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO JEHOVAH NISSI, JEHOVAH SID CANOE, ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ARE ARE ARE NAMES THAT GOD THEY IDENTIFIED A CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM. JEHOVAH GYRA, THE LORD PROVIDES. JEHOVAH RAFA, THE LORD HEALS. AMEN. SO JEHOVAH SHALOM, HE IS OUR PEACE. JEHOVAH NISSI, HE'S OUR CAPTAIN. ALL RIGHT. SO, SO WE FIND THEN THAT NOW WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH, ALL THE NAMES ARE CALLED. ALL REDEMPTION IS FINISHED. ALL OF HIS REDEMPTIVE NAMES ARE NOW ON FULL DISPLAY. SEE, NOW BROTHER BRANDON PICKS THIS UP. WATCH THIS. HE DISTILLS IT PERFECTLY IN describing the progressive expression of Christ. CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED. HE SAYS, "BUT NOW YOU GET IT." HE WANTED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. THAT WAS HIS ONE OF HIS GREATEST THREE-FOLD purposes was to EXPRESS HIMSELF, IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH HUMAN BEINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. to reveal himself in Christ. FIRST, TO EXPRESS HIMSELF COMPLETELY, GOD IN CHRIST. SECOND, TO HAVE THE PREEMINENCE BY THIS in his church. See, now we're in the era of the Holy Ghost. He's got preeminence in his church. He had preeminence in Christ. &gt;&gt; HE PORTRAYED HIM IN ALL THE OLD TESTAMENT. AND THEN Jesus was a fulfillment OF ALL THAT. THAT'S WHY WHEN HE ROSE, THEY all rose. SEE? AND SO NOW HE COMES INTO HIS CHURCH BECAUSE HE'S GOT ANOTHER EXODUS COMING. THAT WAS THE SECOND EXODUS. MOSES WAS THE FIRST ONE. HIS RESURRECTION WAS THE SECOND ONE. BUT THERE'S A THIRD EXODUS THAT COMES 2,000 YEARS LATER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND SO SO WE FIND THEN HE SAYS, "SO SECONDLY, FIRST TO EXPRESS HIMSELF COMPLETELY, GOD IN CHRIST. SECOND TO HAVE THE PREEMINENCE BY THIS IN HIS CHURCH WHICH IS HIS BODY THE BRIDE TILL HE COULD HAVE THE PREEMINENCE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH THEM. &gt;&gt; All right. AND THIRDLY TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO ITS RIGHTLY POSITION THAT FELL BY SIN BY THE FIRST ADAM BACK TO WHERE HE WALKED IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING WITH HIS PEOPLE TALKED WITH THEM FELLOWSHIPPED WITH THEM. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING FRIENDS. HE'S TRYING TO GET BACK TO THAT PLACE. HALLELUJAH. GOD HIMSELF CAN COME DOWN. NOW THE HOLY GHOST CAN LIVE IN YOU, BUT JESUS FEET CAN'T CAN'T TOUCH CAN'T DON'T TOUCH THE GROUND. WE MEET HIM IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND AND SO THAT'S WHY JESUS CAN JESUS CAN WALK AROUND WITH US IN THE MILLENNIUM. BUT BUT THERE'S STILL ANOTHER EXPRESSION COMING. IT'S THE SAME GOD AT A GREATER EXPRESSION BECAUSE NOW THE EARTH HAS BEEN REDEEMED. NOW GOD CAN COME DOWN AND PUT HIS FULL FEET, HIS FULL EXPRESSION BACK ON THE EARTH AGAIN. HE'S GOT A REDEEMED PEOPLE. HE'S GOT A REDEEMED [screaming] EARTH. HE'S GOT A REDEEMED HEAVENS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS, "SO HE FOR TO THE GARDEN IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING WITH HIS PEOPLE TALKED WITH HIM, FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM. AND NOW NOW FOR RIGHT NOW SIN AND DEATH HAD SEPARATED THEM FROM HIS PRESENCE AND HIS ENTIRE EXPRESSION." HE SAYS THEN WHAT IS IT? It's now listen to this. This is real definitive. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? God in expression. It's Christ being revealed. AND HE IS THE WORD. And when THE WORD IS REVEALED, IT EXPRESSES ITSELF. THAT'S GOD'S PURPOSE FOR JESUS CHRIST WAS TO EXPRESS HIMSELF TO TAKE HIS OWN laws and live by his own laws, FULFILL HIS LAW BY DEATH. AND CHRIST, GOD DIED IN FLESH IN ORDER TO CONDEMN SIN IN THE FLESH THAT HE MIGHT BRING TO HIMSELF A GLORIOUS BRIDE REDEEMED BACK that will believe only in the word of God. SEE, SO THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS SO THAT AS HE SAID HERE, SO THAT HE COULD HAVE THE PREEMINENCE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH THEM. [snorts] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN THE BRIDE OF THE LAST AGE TO DO WHAT? TO BRING FORTH A WIFE UNTO HIMSELF. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, NOW YOU KNOW AND THERE AND THERE'S A NUANCE TO BE OBSERVED because when you WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THE bride you LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN IT LIKE THIS AND I GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT to confuse you. SO WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THE BRIDE BRIDE DEALS MORE WITH ESPOUSAL. PAUL SAID for I have espoused you remember to the Corinthians for I have espoused you to one husband. See, but I fear lest what happened to Eve happen to you. SEE? AND SO, SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM BREAKS IT DOWN. HE SAYS, SEE, when Adam, he was given a bride, BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO KNOW HER AS A WIFE, HE FOUND SHE HAD ALREADY FALLEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, THEN JEHOVAH, THE SAME THING. ISRAEL WAS A BRIDE FOR JEHOVAH. BUT WHEN HE CAME TO HAVE HER THE TO THE TO HAVE HIS BETROTHED AS A WIFE, HE FOUND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY CHOSEN A KING AND REJECTED HIM &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS POLLUTED. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, AND SO THEN WHEN JESUS, YOU CATCH IT, BROTHER BRANDHAM DEALS WITH THIS. HE SAID, "SO WHEN JESUS CAME, YOU KNOW, IN THOSE EARLY YEARS AND HE CAME TO RECEIVE A BRIDE AT NIKA TO MAKE HER A WIFE &gt;&gt; TO TO BRING FORTH A MARRIAGE, THEN HE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY POLLUTED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD ALREADY FALLEN. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? &gt;&gt; SO NOW WHAT MUST HE DO? HE MUST SIT BACK DOWN IN THE ETERNITIES, SEAL THE WORD UP UNDER SEVEN SEALS, MAKE A PROMISE HE WOULD UNVEIL IT AT THE END TIME AND START INTERCEDING TO GOD ON BEHALF OF THE IGNORANCE OF WHO? HIS FAMILY, HIS REDEEMED FAMILY, HIS BRIDE ALL THROUGH SEVEN AGES. BUT WE REALIZE IT WAS COMING DOWN TO THE END TIME FRIENDS. AND IT WASN'T IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T JUST BE HIS BRIDE. REVELATION 19:7, "LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE AND GIVE HONOR TO HIM, FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB IS COME, AND HIS WIFE HATH MADE HERSELF READY." HALLELUJAH. REVELATION 21:9, "AND THERE CAME UNTO ME ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS, WHICH HAD THE SEVEN VIALS FULL OF THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES." SO, WE KNOW THIS IS OUR DAY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE SEVENTH ANGEL THAT CAME WITH WITH MERCY AND WITH JUDGMENT. OH, HALLELUJAH. AND IT SAYS HE HE COMES AND AND HE SAYS HERE VERSE 9 WHICH HATH THE SEVEN VIALS FULL OF THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES AND TALKED WITH ME SAYING COME HITHER I WILL SHOW THEE THE BRIDE THE LAMB'S WIFE I IS SHE STILL THE BRIDE OF COURSE SHE'S HIS BRIDE THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY COME BUT YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE COME TO THE LAST [screaming] TIME OF THE LAST AGE AND NOW A BRIDE FOR SICK FOR 2,000 YEARS [screaming] THAT HE'S AND CALLING THOSE NAMES ON THE ROLL AND COMES TO THE END TIME AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS [screaming] WE DON'T GO TO THE WEDDING SUPPER TO GET MARRIED. WE'RE MARRIED RIGHT HERE. IT IS AN INVISIBLE UNION [screaming] OF CHRIST AND HIS BRIDE AND SHE'S NOW HIS WIFE AND HE CALLS HIS QUEEN &gt;&gt; TO COME AND STAND BY HIS SIDE. &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] GLORY. HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS, THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS WHAT GOD PROMISED [screaming] HIMSELF. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS MADE A COUNTER CLAIM &gt;&gt; AGAINST GOD'S CLAIM. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TODAY. I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS. WHOSE CLAIM do you want to be identified under? &gt;&gt; Do you WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED UNDER MAN-MADE RELIGION? DO YOU WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED UNDER SATAN'S ORGANIZED RELIGIOSITY THAT HAS A FORM OF GODLINESS AND DENIES THE LIVING POWER? I SAY, "NOT ME. AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE, I WANT THE WORD, THE WHOLE WORD, AND NOTHING BUT THE WORD BECAUSE I'M INVISIBLY. IT IS THAT VISIBLE UNION, THAT INVISIBLE UNION THAT LITERALLY BRINGS THE SLEEPING SAINTS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS [screaming] OUT OF THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE INVISIBLE UNION IS EXACTLY THAT. IT UNITES HEAD TO BODY. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT THING WHICH WE'VE OPERATED IN A SMALL MEASURE AT THAT TIME, IT'LL BE OF FULL POWER. AND EVEN EVEN HOW MUCH FULL POWER EVEN TO THE DEAD THAT'S BEEN DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS WILL COME UP OUT OF THE GRAVE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO PART OF THE BRIDE WHO ARE NOW HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH, FRIENDS. GLORY TO [screaming] GOD IN THE HIGHEST. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A CLAIM AND A COUNTER CLAIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You have to decide today who has your allegiance. &gt;&gt; Do you want your own way or do you want his way? [snorts] &gt;&gt; I recognize that he has come in this hour because time has met prophecy and I am here to be a fulfillment. See, that's why it then it made so much sense to me. I went, "Oh my goodness, I get it now. It's here." I was trying to figure out what's that going to look like. It that's that's missing the whole point. H HOWEVER THAT TURNS OUT, THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT. BUT THAT MISSES THE POINT THE PROPHET'S TRYING TO MAKE. [laughter] HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT THAT HE CAN COME AND DWELL BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE ARE FULLY REDEEMED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE ENTIRE GOD IS ON DISPLAY. THE ENTIRE FAMILY OF [screaming] GOD IS ON DISPLAY. AND THE EARTH, A REDEEMED EARTH, IS GOD ON DISPLAY BECAUSE HE ALWAYS FILLED ALL TIME, SPACE, AND ETERNITY. AND THEN, BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. [laughter] I STARTED TO PUT IN MY NOTES, I HAVE JUST ONE MORE THING, but I would offended the android guys. So, LET ME JUST SAY, BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. Because once you get there, then the the hidden mana and brother Brandham says, "What will that be?" That'll be the eternal unfolding of the mystery of God as he continues through the ceaseless ages. &gt;&gt; Friends, what a day, &gt;&gt; what an hour WE HAVE COME TO. WHAT A BLESSED TIME TO BE A BELIEVER. YEAH. YOU YOU THE CALENDAR DIDN'T COME TO YOU. YOU CAME TO THE CALENDAR. HALLELUJAH. JUST LIKE WHEN IT WAS EXACTLY 50 DAYS, THE THAT NUMBER ON THE CALENDAR WHEN CHRIST COMES AND ONE OF THESE MORNINGS THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE FE SEEING A LOT OF THEIR OLD LOVED ONES IN KITCHENS AND LIVING ROOMS AROUND THE WORLD. AND IT'S GOING TO BE ON FROM THERE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And we'll lift up off THIS EARTH. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, UH, SHE'S WAVING, HE SAID, WE'LL RISE UP AND WAVE GOODBYE. [screaming] [laughter] AH, HOW MANY WANT TO WAVE BEFORE THE LORD TODAY AND BE A WAVE OFFERING? SAY, "GOODBYE, OLD WORLD. GOODBYE." HALLELUJAH. LET'S STAND TO OUR FEET, FRIENDS.
