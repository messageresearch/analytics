I have a little testimony. Our brother preached surrounded on Sunday. So, Sunday afternoon, we're driving home and um you know, you don't want to text and drive or anything like that. I had a bee in the car. So, I was It came by and I opened the window, thought it got out driving it. It was It came back again. So, I looked over and I'm rolling down the window and she says, "Luther," and I look, I'm on cruise about 66, 67 miles an hour. totally off the road on 462 and it's a curve and I'm like and I I didn't think to hit my brakes to get the crews off or anything. I'm just like I just got to get to ease it back on the road. Well, what happens when you hit the asphalt? I was in the other lane facing 90° to the road trying to come back around. Uh you know, you don't want to overorrect. I'm not a a great driver. Just a good one. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But by the grace of God, we ended up back in our lane facing the other lane stopped and there was no cars coming at the time or else it would have been ugly. So we get straightened out and going. There's like a line of about 10 cars and the first car in line is like 20 mph with his hazards on and they probably had eyes about that big. You know, we just kind of drove by and said, "We're surrounded. I'm very thankful to God." Amen. You know, when you don't, you may not see it. Sometimes you may not even realize it. He's watching over you. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you and I'm so grateful to you, Father, for your watchful eye. I pray that you bless the service this evening. Bless the song service, Father, as we come to one of the sacraments that you've provided for us, one of the the duties, Lord, foot communion and foot washing. Father, Lord, we come with reverence, respect. We pray that you would be with us this evening, Father, guide us, bring us closer as a family under your hand. And Lord, as we collect the tithes and offerings, I pray that you'd bless the cheerful giver. Father God, there's you're just so much higher than we are. And I'm thankful for your watchful hand. Bless your people now. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Sing.

Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. He's worthy. Hallelujah. Amen. You can be seated just for a moment. We're going to um just have just a little presentation um just here uh just for a moment. Got two announcements I wanted to make. Both of them are youth related and I know these announcements have went out uh multiple times on WhatsApp and different groups. So uh we are using the uh PA system, the public address system to announce to the church and everybody who's streaming uh live and those that will listen to this. We just want to announce again our meetings uh the youth meetings that are coming up here on July 28th, 29th, and 30th. And so that's with brother Daryl Ward, July 28th, 29, and 30. We have a flyer there on what's on uh Facebook and also on YouTube. And that uh 28th service will just be a regular uh youth service here at the Church with Brother Daryl. And then the 29th, on the morning of the 29th, the Saturday, there will be activities at the YMCA, we have uh reserved and rented to have just a youth day with activities. A little too hot to be outside in July in Buford. So, we didn't want to go to the park, so we're going to have that there. Uh and then that night at 700 p.m. Correction, the flyer says 6, but it's actually at 7. So, the banquet is going to be at 700 p.m. 700 p.m. at Urban Brew. And so we'll we you can go on and get all the details for that. Then Sunday morning will be the main service with the whole church. And uh what is imperative is that we have dropped the numbers to be able to fit where we've the last two years we've I think we've registered 160 kids so that we're not doing that this year. We're we're going to fill it up at 85 Jay. Is that right Brad? 85 uh people kids total uh young people. And so our own youth, our own uh young people here need to make sure that you get on and you register um as soon as you can. It's a cost of $35 right on the flyer. If you don't have the information, get with Brother Brad. He sent it to the youth and the parents of the youth multiple times, but you want to make sure you get registered. Also, our youth camp is uh coming up. Going to be here before you know it. We're excited about that. And so, we just want to show you just a little presentation video. Um, go ahead and uh and get that ready to be played. If we could unmute the computer, make sure we got lots of volume. Amen. Show you this. Each generation has it own. at the word. We are not here for partial births. We not come to see a bunch of stillborn babies even. But we want real true born again sons and daughters of God that are quickened to life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. That'll put up power in you. that'll make the word live. If you and I could only see who we are today and you look around and the Lord I never know you're not. There's more with us than there are within the odds are hail your destiny has already been determined. You are going to make it. Bethl Tabernacle would like to invite you again to our third annual fall youth camp. We have been blessed in our endeavor to upgrade our facility this year and we're looking forward to sharing it with you. Carolina Point is located in the spectacular Blue Ridge Mountains just 45 minutes west of our former location. As in previous years, you can expect to enjoy exciting revival weekend filled with memorable chapel services and outpourings of the Holy Ghost as well as times of worship, instruction, and engagement activities. Our special guest speakers this year will be brother Donnie Reagan and brother Josh Bannon as well as special devotions and worship with brother Barry Coffee and brother Cadre Digs. There's an impressive number of activities and sports available on this campground including whiffle ball, botchi ball, basketball, volleyball and soccer, archery tag, frisbee golf, go-karts, and indoor rec center filled with ping pong and foosball tables, as well as the trail head to the peak of Sasa Press Mountain, which is the highest peak in South Carolina. One of the upgrades we're most excited about is the cafeteria building. It features a large open space designed for family style dining which can accommodate all campers at once. So no more need for separate meal times or wristands. Complete with immaculate dorms, a spacious chapel, and an easy to navigate campus. This campground is sure to facilitate an outstanding weekend. Camp will be held one week earlier this year from Thursday, October 19th through Sunday, October 22nd. Registration opens on June 19th and is $189 per person. Available spots will fill up quickly, so be sure to mark your calendar. The link to register can be found on our church website at bethl-tab.org, or our church youth website, bethl youthcamp.org. If you're an adult wishing to be part of our volunteer staff, please email us at info@ bethol youthcamp.org. We're in great expectation and anticipation for this year's special time in the presence of the Lord. We're believing that there will be a mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost to bring healing and restoration to fill and refill with the Holy Ghost and to bring total deliverance to the captives. We are confessing a total binding of the enemy and the loosing of God's children. We look forward to seeing you at Beth Youth Camp this year in Carolina Point. May God richly bless you. What was your favorite part of camp? Making new friends. Hanging out with everybody. Bonfire. Bonfire. Making new friends. Oo. Favorite part? Honestly, just seeing this beautiful fall around the lake. The friends and the bonfires. That's really the bonfire. A lot of confirmed things in my heart in the prayer line. The bonfires. Getting a closer walk with the Lord. Everything. Everything was amazing. Services, the views, not the walking. So, that was a good part, but everything else was amazing. The skip, that was really good. It was perfect. Definitely the services. Probably the services and hanging out with friends. Definitely the services. Absolutely. When the spirit of the Lord would move to watch the reaction of the people was priceless. Last night's service was awesome. The services and kayaking. The Saturday night service. The services. The services. What was your favorite part of the services? [Music] Praise the Lord. Amen. Looking forward to that. Amen. We're going to carry on with the um communion and footwashing service. I'm going to turn it back over to brother Matt just in a moment. I wanted to just uh give you a little bit of an update. I went back uh today for a follow-up visit. The u opthalmologist was very happy to say that uh it's continuing to improve and she can see improvement in all areas. And so that was a really really good report. Um, she did reemphasize that, you know, that uh that I do have certain restraints on me over the next six weeks because this is my second bout of shingles and I've got to make sure that it's completely defeated this time. I had had the plan to uh announce to you and actually even have already got one one session under my belt uh to take Sunday schools and Wednesdays and and do a teaching series. I am going to do that, but I uh better part of wisdom has suggested that I not try to do it while I'm still uh affected by this. I can't be up here. The last time the lights even the very next day on Monday, it had had a negative effect on me. So, amen. And try as I might, I have a hard time keeping that my pedal off my foot off the gas pedal. And um so I someone one brother said, "Well, you got an A+ for effort." And I said, "What?" He go, "Well, you got a B minus for execution." So so I said, "Well, I'll take it." But so so we we are going to do that. I've had many many many requests for that. And we are going to take some teaching series on that, but I'm going to have to wait. Uh so I'm going to stand down from all forms of ministry through the end of June, and the ministry team here will pick up the slack. I'm glad we have a ministry team. Amen. Who can do that for us. Amen. God, God bless you, brother Matt. Come and sing another song for us. Amen. As we carry on in the service. God bless you. [Music] Abundance of mats. Let's all stand and change the order of the service. Oh, the love of God is greater far than tongue or pain [Music] can ever tell. It goes beyond the highest star [Music] and reaches to the lowest hill. The guilty pair bow down with care. God gave his son to win his child. be reconciled and pardoned from [Music] is [Applause] Oh God, how rich and pure, how meureless. [Applause] and strong. It shall forever more endure the saints and a gel song. Would we with the ocean filled? [Music] And were the skies a parchment made? Were every soul on earth a queen and every man ascribe my dream to ride the love of God above. or drain the oak shain [Music] the hole. Though stretch from sky to sky. Oh God, how rich and [Music] how [Applause] and strong. It shall forever [Music] more. [Music] Amen. Don't you appreciate the love of God? Amen. I believe that's really what communion is all about. Amen. It's a love relationship. Amen. to have communion with our Lord. Amen. We want to sing the song together before we read the scripture in 1 Corinthians. Create in me a clean heart. Just had the song upon my heart. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew arise spirit within me. You want to make that a prayer? Sing that again with your hands raised. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew the right spirit within me. [Music] Here's my prayer, Lord. Cast me not away, and cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me, [Applause] but restore Lord, unto me all the joy of thy salvation. Oh, and renew arise spirit within me. One more time. Cast me not away. Lord cast me not away from thy presence. Oh, [Music] and take not thy whole spirit from me. God restore unto me [Music] all the joy. Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, and renew arise spirit within me. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You can be seated just for a moment. We're going to Amen and you can just keep playing that for me. I just wanted to um speak just for just a minute uh before we read the scripture and then we'll have brother Luther come. 1 Corinthians uh chapter 11, very familiar. You know, I thought of this word when I was even just contemplating today and just meditating knowing we'd have a communion service. And I believe communion is so important. It's it's uh one of the three ordinances that the Lord Jesus left us. Brother Brandham said, "I believe every Christian ought to partake of communion." Not miss it. Communion, not just communion, but footwashing also. And it's a way for us to express oursel to even the Bible, we're going to read it here in a moment, says, "Terry, one for another." And you know, when brother Brandon picks that up and he says, "What does that mean?" It means you're to wait on each other. that this is a time of examination. You know, it's it's a check or balance. The checks and balances that God puts in the church to keep it in order, to keep our lives in order. It's a it's a way for us to measure to measure ourselves against the word. It's a way for us to make our calling and election sure. It's a sober time. Communion's a a sobering moment uh just for us to examine our lives, examine our uh uh you know, our our ways. But at the same time, it's a more than that. It's the overarching principle is to remember the Lord. And so that's why we're here tonight is to remember not ourselves, but a perfect sacrifice, a perfect lamb who was sacrificed for us because we in ourselves, none of us would say that we're worthy to take communion. Brother Adam says, you know who's worthy to take communion? Any Christian is worthy to take communion. Any Christian. Now, that's a powerful statement. Any Christian's worthy to take communion, not your own worthiness, not in something that you look at yourself or uh how good you are or whether you measure up or not. But brother Brandham says if we take it unworthily, now we know that we're not worthy in ourselves. None of us are. I'd raise my hand and say yes. But that we are not trusting in our own worthiness. We're trusting in him. We're trusting in his worthiness that we have, now listen, all he says this, that we have died to our own thinking and just think his thoughts and live to everything that we believe he commands us to and look back and see what we're living and look our life over. You know, I spoke on that the last Sunday I spoke here. Church is a unique place so important and essential in our life. It's a place where we can contemplate, where we could come with open hearts and hear. No other place you'll go to to where the word, not a man, but the word is judging our lives. Now, that's what a real Christian wants to say, Lord, let your word judge me. As brother Brandham said, let me stand in judgment now so I'm not judged there. Let me receive my judgment here. And he says, we're to look at our lives to look back and see what we're living and to look over look over our life again. And if we're doing things that's not worthy of the gospel, then we shouldn't take communion. Wow. Now, Brother Brandham talks about that and he says, "If you're out here claiming one thing, but you're out in the barroom or you're telling dirty jokes or you're listening to rock and roll music and your life, you know, I'm not talking about mistakes, but you have a lifestyle that's that's not worthy of the gospel." And he says, "If you know, if you know, that's the Holy Spirit pointing to you." In other words, convicting saying, "You know you're not a real believer. you know that your life doesn't measure up. You're not you're just you know that you're not a real Christian. You're not living the life uh of Christ and you're not your life's not worthy of the gospel. He says if that's you and he says you look back and he says and he says then don't don't take communion. You know, that's amazing because if you think about that, the ordinance that's left in the church, that's something that to a real son or daughter of God, if you had sin in your life and something that would prevent you from taking communion, that ought to turn something on in you to say, "Lord, I want to turn my life around. I want to repent of all of my sins. I want to be a real believer." This is what communion should produce in our churches. It should clean us all out. Amen. We don't want none of the world. How many how many would I do identify and say we don't want the filthiness of the world in our church. Don't let it be found in me, Lord. Let me have a place of purity and holiness. Brother Brandham says, "But if you feel that you're living, that you look back and see that all your sins, and we've all got them, are confessed and under the blood, then you're supposed to take that. You're a part of it. You're a part of it. So that's why we're to examine ourselves, you know, because I can examine you and I could see maybe a perfect life, but you know, and and not not a able to discern your heart, not know you. None of us could discern each other. None of us could bring real conviction. We could look at the outside of someone and judge them. But you know, that's not what we're called to do. But with what you say, brother Matt, then what brings judgment to my life? The Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will convict you. I don't need to answer whether you you can take communion or don't take take communion. The Holy Ghost will answer that in your heart. The Holy Ghost will convict you and tell you, you know, you're not right. Or or you can say, "Lord, I know that I've sinned and I've made mistakes, but I want to confess them right now." And I want to walk worthy before you. First Corinthians chapter 11, let's all stand to our feet. For I have received of the Lord. Verse 3, 1 Corinthians chap 11. Those that have Bibles, that's wonderful. I'll wait for you just to First Corinth, 1 Corinthians chapter 11. I'll wait for you to uh to get to that. [Music] 1 Corinthians 11:23. I had it printed in my notes and not my scripture. Verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of who?" So who are we to remember tonight? Not ourselves. We're under the blood. We remember him. This do you in remembrance of me. And when he had given thanks. Verse 26. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. That's why it's important. But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. Notice this verse 32. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Who judges me? The word. That's my judgment. The word. We're not living up to the So you say, "Brother Matt, what happens if we're judged and we're not living up to the word?" Then the Lord chastens you. Not man, but God will chasen your life. That's what what we're reading right here. We're chasened of the Lord. And when the Lord chastens us, Brother Brandham said, "What does that mean?" It's not like a It's not just a whapon or a spanking, but Brother Brandham says he brings correction to our life. That's the purpose of chastening. It's to correct us. And I say, Lord, I want to be like David. I want to say, Lord, see if there be any wicked way in me. And if there is, Lord, correct my life. I want to be corrected. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another. Brother Brandham says this in the message communion in 1963. He says, "I pray for you that if there's some sin in you, some unrighteous deed or something that you've done as a believer, I pray that God will take it out of you, that he'll forgive you for it. and you pray for me that if there's something that I've done that I don't know just about, if I've done it and know it's wrong, I'd confess it right now, I'm fixing to because he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eat and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. We don't want the world in here. Amen, brother Brandon. This little spot of people that God has given us to worship with here, we want to keep ourselves clean. How many would raise a hand and say, "That's my desire." Clean from selfishness. Keep ourselves from sin. Live our lives clean from all the things of the world that we be not spotted with that. We want to be ready for the rapture. Now, Brother Brandham does something that I'm going to do here tonight just for a moment. And when he takes this scripture where in the very last one we read, "Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tar one for another." Here's what we're going to do as the prophet did. We're just going to pray silently. I'm not going to pray out loud. I want you to bow your heads with me. And I want you to pray for each other. And brother Brandham says, I want you to pray for each other and say, Lord, if there's any sin in my brother's life, any anything that wouldn't be like you, would you would you bring repent? Would you bring conviction to his heart and let him repent of it right now? Now, if you're doing that for for your brother and they're doing it for you and I'm doing it for you, I believe the Lord can honor that. Let's just take a moment and then we'll pray together just for a moment in silence here. Let it be, Lord Jesus. All of our sins, all of Lord, the things that where we don't measure up and we don't line up. Let it be, Lord, that all of our sins would be under the blood at this moment. Lord, I repent of it, Jesus. God of everything Lord that would be unlike you. anything in my heart, Lord. Let me take my opportunity right now to say, "Forgive me, Lord Jesus. May it be in the forgetfulness of your recollection." I pray, God, as we come together, Lord, to take communion as a family, cuz that's what this church is, Lord. All families, brothers and sisters, believers, and children of Christ. Lord, I pray God that you would just come and commune with us, Lord, now as we wait on you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord. Take not and take not thy holy spirit from me. [Music] Could you raise your hand now and sing it? Restore, restore us to me all the joy of thy salvation and renew and renew. Arise spirit. You want to sing that one more time to the Lord now as a prayer. Lift up your hands and your voice. Oh [Music] Lord, cast me not away from thy presence. Yes, Lord. Take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore [Music] unto me all the joy of thy salvation and renew and renew. the right spirit within me. [Music] Now, Lord, we just turn our eyes to you right now, God, as we prepare to take your supper, Lord, and remember you, Father. I pray that you'd come and accompany us, Lord, in this line. As people come and Father, and partake of, Lord, the elements, I pray, God, that your your spirit would just commune with us. May this be a special time, Lord, in your presence. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. We're going to start here with Sister Emily. When you come around, just uh make your way through here and then circle back around until we're going through it. And maybe if the musicians could dismiss, except for Sister Deborah, we'll get you last just to have a piano. Brother Matthew, why don't you sing also? Just if you could while we're taking communion, just sing some worship songs, something upon your heart. Okay. create clean. [Music] Oh God, [Music] and renew a right spirit within me. [Music] create me clean [Music] [Music] and renew a spirit within me. Oh, cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord. Take not thy holy spirit from me. restore [Music] to me. [Music] All the joy of thy salvation [Music] and renewing spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. [Music] Create in me a clean heart, oh God, [Music] and renew a right spirit within me. Oh, cast me away from my presence. Oh, take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me all the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. [Music] stand. [Music] Standing somewhere in the shadows you find Jesus. [Music] He's the only one who cares and understands. Standingwhere in the shadows, you will find him. And you'll know him by the nail prints in his hands. [Music] I shall know him. I shall know [Music] him as redeemed. By his side I shall stand. I shall know you. I shall know you by the prince of the nails in his hands. [Music] Standing sun in the shadows you find Jesus for you. He's the only one who cares and understands. Standing somewhere in the shadows you will find him and you'll know him by the nail prince in his hand. [Music] I shall know him. I shall know him. As redeemed by his side, I shall stay. I shall know him. I shall know him by the praise of the nails in his hands. [Music] I shall I shall know. Oh yes. [Music] I will stand. Oh. I shall know [Music] him. I shall know him by the praise of the name. John chapter 13 St. John. Just going to read this portion of scripture and then we'll dismiss the brothers. with the computer, the music, the pre-ervice music, if we could have that ready for when we dismiss St. John chapter 13. Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God, he riseth from supper, laid aside his garments, and took a towel, and gerted himself. After that, he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter said unto him,"Lord, dust thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter." Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou has no part with me." Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said unto him, "He that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet, but is clean every wit. And you are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore he said he, you are not all clean." So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garment and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know you what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them. This time we're going to dismiss the brothers to the fellowship poll. Man, they can go ahead and play that. Good.

We got some prayer requests we're going to look at here tonight. I'm just going to read them to you. Amen. It's our Wednesday night also prayer service. We're not going to gather. We're just going to read these and then we'll pray. Uh, Brother Bruce and Sister Linda Paris writes in and says, "Would you please remember a friend of ours who just lost her mom? Her name is Pamela Flynn. We trust the Lord Jesus is providing relief guarding the shingles and especially your eye. God bless you and we're constant. We're certainly looking forward to the communion service this evening. So I know brother Bruce, sister Linda, God bless you who are streaming. We certainly want to remember um a friend of theirs who just lost her mom Pamela Flynn. Brother Josh Mhouse writes in and says, "Hey, brother Jason. Requesting prayer tonight. I've been under the weather with a head, chest, and throat cold since Saturday." Amen. We want to remember our brother Josh. My aunt Lisa writes in and says Samuel is going to be rebaptized by Tom by brother Tom tonight after the preaching. Would you please pray the supernatural peace of God will settle over Samuel's mind and spirit and that the Lord will deliver him of all fear also that God will either fill or refill him with the supernatural outpouring of the Holy Ghost. And I pray for that. my memo also who I guess wrote the same thing in um just called me to tell me the uh that he's got a real serious need. Um and so we want to just take that very seriously uh that if the Lord doesn't touch him in a supernatural way and we believe in a supernatural God and I believe even in this prayer the Holy Spirit could go on the wings of this prayer and touch Samuel. He's a precious precious young man. if you don't know him, just a wonderful spirited boy. And the the devil is just trying to afflict him and attack his mind. And so we need we we desperately need the Lord to touch him in a supernatural way. Will you do that? Amen. Put your arm over on that person that's beside you. Let's just call on the Lord. Amen. For these requests, Lord Jesus. Father, right now we bind our faith together, Lord. Our licks of fire, God. Father, there's strength in numbers, Lord God, because it's more voices and faith, Lord, that we come together and your prophet said that faith accumulates, Lord. So right now, oh God, may you receive, Lord, the prayers that are being lifted up on behalf of these needs, Lord. Jesus, you see this need for Brother Bruce, Sister Paris's sister Linda Paris's friend, Lord, who lost her mom, Pamela Flynn. God of all comfort and grace, would you go to them right now, Lord Jesus? I pray that you would just touch her, Lord Jesus, in her mind or spirit. Brother Josh's body, Lord, who's home tonight, Satan, you're a liar and we come against you, thou foul spirit of sickness. I pray, God, that you would bring healing to my brother Josh right now. Lord, for Samuel, God, I pray, God, for a supernatural touch. Lord, there's other believers in Washington even now, Lord, that are preparing for service and tonight will be baptized. Lord, we believe that you're the God of the supernatural, that you care, Lord, about our needs and our affliction. Lord, you said that's what you were sent for, to bind up our wounds, to heal the broken, Lord God. And you know Samuel's mind, and you know the spirit of fear that's trying to come upon him. I curse that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, may on the wings of this prayer, an anointing of healing, would it come all over Samuel's body, Father, may the promises of your word be his tonight, Lord Jesus. We pray, Father, for every need, Lord, as we lift them up to you that didn't get a chance to write it down. Great Jehovah Gyra, would you come and meet the needs of your children?
