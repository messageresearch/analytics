[0:00] his glory with no one and that he says
[0:02] at the same time you'll be glorified so
[0:05] how is that how does that work it's
[0:07] because it's God's glory through us and
[0:10] in us and he wants his glory to seen it
[0:13] be seen in and through us so just these
[0:16] two words here are a whole series of
[0:20] sermons in themselves his glory in the
[0:23] bride
[0:24] and then it says the fruit of the Earth
[0:25] shall be excellent and comely for them
[0:28] that are escaped of Israel so what is
[0:30] what does he want from a bride he wants
[0:34] to produce seed he wants to produce his
[0:36] life on a multiplied form so the bride
[0:39] is going to take this word she's going
[0:42] to be the manifestation of that word and
[0:44] that word then is going to multiply in
[0:47] other words we're going to go out and
[0:48] we're going to get the the remaining of
[0:51] the predestinated seed we're going to
[0:52] call them and all those will come forth
[0:54] and bring forth fruit in their lives
[0:57] so then on the other on that's the
[0:59] that's the positive side that we see the
[1:02] negative side is that in our day we we
[1:06] have a day of feminism
[1:08] a day of uh
[1:11] women's Liberation is what they call it
[1:14] remember anytime you see the world use
[1:16] the term Liberation you can bet that
[1:20] it's exactly the opposite of that
[1:24] when you see Democrats speak about
[1:26] Freedom you can be sure that
[1:28] totalitarianism is coming
[1:30] what
[1:33] you see these things coming coming about
[1:36] in our day
[1:37] and what is what is it it's about it's a
[1:40] bondage to sin it's a bondage to evil a
[1:45] woman is not free by divorcing herself
[1:48] of what God created her to be
[1:52] she put she's putting herself in a
[1:54] position that ruins her and brings her
[1:57] to sadness depression sorrow
[2:01] Etc this is not
[2:04] being the one who wears the pants so to
[2:07] speak in the family is not what God has
[2:10] ordained for a woman to be
[2:13] and I'm getting way 20 screens ahead of
[2:15] myself so let me just
[2:17] let's go Ephesians 5 22 and 24 through
[2:21] 24.
[2:22] wives submit yourselves and to your own
[2:24] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[2:26] husband is the head of the wife even as
[2:27] Christ is the head of the church and he
[2:30] is the savior of the body therefore as
[2:31] the church is subject unto Christ so let
[2:35] the wives be to their husband their own
[2:37] husbands in everything
[2:40] amen so
[2:41] not a not a very fashionable verse right
[2:45] now and I'm sorry that's very hard to
[2:47] read uh people my age and older cannot
[2:50] read it young people probably can
[2:52] so I'm going to read it from my iPad
[2:55] here
[2:56] so this is from Lang's commentary on the
[2:58] scriptures just to give a picture here
[3:00] says the exhortation wives submit
[3:03] yourselves to your own husbands the
[3:06] Apostle had in this one precept of
[3:08] obedience for the wife a good and
[3:10] sufficient reason for defining the
[3:12] husband with your own this justifies the
[3:15] sharpening by which the command appears
[3:17] a natural one
[3:18] as to the Lord as you see there in the
[3:21] scripture
[3:22] submits yourself to your husband as unto
[3:25] the Lord right
[3:27] the singular requires according to the
[3:29] context a reference to Christ and as
[3:32] marks a reality behind the husband
[3:33] stands the Lord himself
[3:36] thus the obedience is characterized the
[3:39] obedience is to be rendered not to the
[3:41] husband as man but as to your own
[3:44] husband in and by whose person the Lord
[3:47] is honored who has established the
[3:49] relation whom the husband himself must
[3:52] obey
[3:53] hence it's not the husband as
[3:56] Lord
[3:57] so you see see there when you're as a
[3:59] wife when you are honoring your husband
[4:02] when you're submitting to your husband
[4:05] you're doing it unto the Lord that's
[4:07] your service to Christ right when you
[4:10] submit to your husband it's as unto the
[4:13] Lord just as
[4:15] when it says servants obey your masters
[4:18] right not with not as men Pleasers right
[4:21] we're to and and we're also to work
[4:23] heartily as unto the Lord right
[4:27] it doesn't mean the master is somehow so
[4:31] much greater and better and so forth
[4:34] that there's not an equality we know
[4:36] that there's no difference between a
[4:38] servant and a master a boss an employee
[4:40] there's no there's no there's no
[4:42] differing value but there's a different
[4:44] position there's a differing place it's
[4:47] not as though because the wife has to
[4:48] submit she has is lesser in value or
[4:51] lesser important in importance in the
[4:54] body of Christ or in the Family itself
[4:56] that's not what it's speaking about it's
[4:59] speaking about what her position is in
[5:03] the home what is God has designed her to
[5:05] be she's to submit to her own husband
[5:08] as unto the Lord in other words you're
[5:10] honoring and glorifying God when you
[5:14] submit to your husband
[5:16] right
[5:18] all right let me keep reading from the
[5:19] next screen verse 23 it says because the
[5:22] husband is the head of the wife
[5:25] so this designates generally every
[5:28] husband who has such is head of the
[5:30] definite wife
[5:32] Chosen and one by him the position of
[5:35] the husband is thus marked as of an
[5:38] organizing managing controlling and
[5:40] deciding character which is further set
[5:42] forth by the comparison immediately
[5:46] following
[5:47] as Christ also is the head of the church
[5:51] so it places him as parallel with the
[5:55] husband places Christ as parallel with
[5:57] the husband on on the head of the church
[5:59] the wife and the church then are placed
[6:02] as parallels right in a I think it's in
[6:05] Colossians 3 it says and husbands be not
[6:07] bitter against them it speaks of ruling
[6:10] with harsh rigor and like a dictatorship
[6:14] the Bible expressly commands don't lead
[6:16] your wife as a dictator
[6:19] right
[6:22] then in verse 24 it says nevertheless as
[6:27] the church is subject to Christ
[6:28] nevertheless means speaks of in spite of
[6:32] the difference between Christ and the
[6:34] husband right it's a the resemblance
[6:37] between the church and the right wife
[6:38] remains so it's it's like a adverse
[6:43] particle in the sentence nevertheless
[6:45] means I understand that Christ and the
[6:48] husband are exactly the same Christ is
[6:51] perfect without sin your husband is
[6:53] nevertheless the type stands right
[6:58] nevertheless your husband isn't perfect
[7:00] he makes mistakes and he'll Lead You
[7:03] imperfectly nevertheless
[7:05] nevertheless
[7:07] the church is sub as as the church is
[7:10] subject to Christ so let the wives be to
[7:13] their own husbands
[7:15] right if this strongly marks that this
[7:18] is reading from the commentary this
[7:19] strongly marks the analogy the verb is
[7:21] to be supplied as in verse 22. the
[7:24] emphasis rests on the final words in
[7:26] everything
[7:28] from such a command we are not to infer
[7:30] that the reference is to Christian
[7:31] wedlock
[7:32] this must indeed also be thoroughly
[7:35] correct neither the one or the other is
[7:37] to be accepted in everything is limited
[7:39] by the context of that to that which the
[7:41] husband as such commands and which the
[7:44] wife as such has to do but in neither
[7:46] contrary to the Lord
[7:48] Hodge says it teaches its extent not its
[7:51] degree it extends over all departments
[7:53] but is limited in all first by the
[7:55] nature of the relationship and secondly
[7:57] by the higher authority of God
[8:00] you see understand you understand be
[8:02] subject to your husbands in everything
[8:04] in other words it's that's a that's in a
[8:07] limited sense right it's in a limited
[8:09] sense as to what the relationship
[8:13] implies right so what the relationship
[8:16] implies is what the Lord implies it's
[8:19] not what we get to say it means it's
[8:21] what what that relationship implies and
[8:24] secondly the higher authority of God in
[8:26] other words if your husband commands you
[8:28] to do something contrary to scripture
[8:31] you're not obligated to obey your
[8:33] husband
[8:34] you're obligated to obey God
[8:38] but don't say that every time your
[8:39] husband speaks I'm obligated to obey God
[8:42] okay
[8:45] huh
[8:50] so let's look at the value of
[8:53] women that Jesus brings an incredible
[8:57] transformation
[8:59] Mark 15 41 understand there was not a
[9:02] single School in the days of Jesus that
[9:05] taught women the Torah
[9:09] yep today to this day you go to Israel
[9:12] and if you go to a worship place there's
[9:14] a barrier and there's a little tiny spot
[9:17] for the women to go worship and there's
[9:19] a big giant area for the men to worship
[9:22] even at the Western Wall big huge open
[9:24] area for the men to go little tiny area
[9:27] that the women have to go in this is the
[9:30] concept women don't have the same value
[9:33] in this system leading up to the time of
[9:36] Christ
[9:37] women were not it's even written by the
[9:39] rabbis don't teach other than what she
[9:42] has to do in her responsibility in the
[9:44] home do not about keeping it kosher and
[9:47] so forth don't teach her anything about
[9:49] the Torah she doesn't need to know
[9:53] so here we have Jesus coming setting
[9:56] things in order who also when he was in
[9:58] Galilee followed him and ministered unto
[10:00] him and many other women which came up
[10:02] with him unto Jerusalem we read this we
[10:05] just go right over it like whatever okay
[10:09] but this is a this is a this is a quite
[10:11] a statement that's made
[10:13] he has women that are following his
[10:16] ministry that are listening to his
[10:18] ministry and ministering unto him this
[10:20] is what kind of rap weird Rabbi is this
[10:23] no Rabbi has such a thing
[10:27] Mark 16 9-11 now when Jesus was risen
[10:30] early the first day of the week he
[10:32] appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of
[10:34] whom he had cast Seven Devils
[10:36] and she went and told them that had been
[10:38] with him as they mourned and wept and
[10:39] they when they heard that he was alive
[10:41] and had been seen of her believe not so
[10:44] even the disciples the same approach as
[10:45] the rest of the society a woman's
[10:47] telling us something
[10:49] it's not true
[10:51] we can't believe that this is not merely
[10:54] because
[10:55] they were mourning and they didn't
[10:56] understand it this was more than that
[10:58] this was the approach of society at the
[11:01] time a woman's a woman's testimony meant
[11:04] very little so Look what Jesus Does
[11:09] God could have ordered he could have
[11:11] ordained anyone to be there if if if we
[11:15] want to make the gospel true in that day
[11:18] because we consider it you know we're
[11:21] making a fake right he he swooned and
[11:24] then gets up and they're they're trying
[11:26] to make a fake surely they're not going
[11:27] to send a woman and even write about it
[11:30] they'll cover that up goodness don't say
[11:32] that that's offensive don't say the
[11:36] woman was the first to witness him no
[11:37] one will believe us
[11:39] this is too fantastic and yet Jesus
[11:43] appears first to Mary Magdalene what is
[11:46] he showing
[11:47] he's showing the value of a woman to him
[11:50] is just the same as a value of as a man
[11:54] her word her character her life to Jesus
[11:59] is exactly the same
[12:03] John 4 7.
[12:05] remember this starts with Jesus says I
[12:08] must needs go by Samaria
[12:14] why didn't you make a better choice God
[12:17] you should have appeared to the leader
[12:21] of the synagogue
[12:22] and met him that's not what he chose to
[12:25] do he chose to go to the people who were
[12:27] considered no value
[12:29] I mean talk about no value this is a
[12:31] prostitute
[12:33] this is a woman with
[12:35] many husbands
[12:37] that no one would listen to she couldn't
[12:39] even go to the well at the same time as
[12:40] the rest of the women because she was of
[12:42] ill repute and Jesus
[12:44] there was a predestinated seed there in
[12:48] that soul in that woman
[12:50] and he chose he chose to send her to
[12:52] tell her testimony
[12:55] the opposite of what the world would
[12:58] expect or anticipate or think was right
[13:00] but here he must needs go by Samaria
[13:03] because there's a woman
[13:04] that he had to redeem
[13:08] and she went and said come see a man
[13:10] which told me all things that ever I did
[13:12] is not this the Christ then they went
[13:14] out of the city and came unto him
[13:17] amazing
[13:21] so this is the value
[13:23] that the Lord Jesus we can continue on
[13:25] on this on this topic but even what what
[13:28] I what we read before that the world
[13:30] would consider my goodness husbands love
[13:33] your wives even as Christ loved the
[13:34] church wives submit to your husbands
[13:36] they think this is crushing women it's
[13:39] completely different than what Society
[13:41] had made for for women in that day and
[13:45] age in that day and age it didn't matter
[13:48] if you were a Greek or if you were
[13:50] Egyptian or whatever Society you were in
[13:52] women were property women were merely
[13:55] owned women were taken cast aside and
[13:59] used for whatever you wanted to their
[14:01] voice had no say in the home their their
[14:03] life was not worth the same as a man
[14:06] Jesus is and Paul are coming to show us
[14:09] there's a different way this is the re
[14:12] this is the redeemed way they're not
[14:15] showing us that a man doesn't have a
[14:17] role and a woman doesn't have a role
[14:19] this is what our modern theological
[14:22] seminaries are put moving forward today
[14:24] no it's all egalitarian and a woman can
[14:27] be a preacher and a woman can you know
[14:30] lead the home and be a leader and etc
[14:33] etc they think that's what Redemption
[14:36] the Redemption of Christ where it says
[14:38] there's neither Bond or free neither
[14:40] male nor female right neither Jew nor
[14:43] Greek so they think all relationships
[14:47] are set aside well Paul is writing to
[14:49] people there are Bond or free people
[14:52] there are Masters and slaves right
[14:54] that's not what's being said it's not
[14:57] saying that the there's these
[14:58] relationships are over with it's saying
[15:00] in Christ we look at things very
[15:03] differently we approach things very
[15:05] differently this is this is our approach
[15:07] we don't approach women and men as as
[15:09] though they have inequal value we don't
[15:12] approach slaves and Masters as though
[15:15] they're they have unequal value right
[15:18] everybody has the same value everybody
[15:20] has the same standing in Christ
[15:23] not everybody has the same role he goes
[15:25] through that in First Corinthians 12. it
[15:27] shows that even even within the body
[15:29] everybody has a different role not
[15:31] everybody's called to preach not
[15:32] everybody's called to speak with tongues
[15:34] not everybody's called to prophesy not
[15:36] everybody's called to a leadership
[15:37] position right everybody has a different
[15:39] gifting the way the Lord has ordained
[15:42] and the same applies to to the home
[15:45] to to Civil Life to all these different
[15:48] things to the leadership of the church
[15:49] God has ordained a very specific pattern
[15:53] and program for us to follow
[15:55] the gospel restores that and brings that
[15:58] to the place right place where it's
[16:00] supposed to be it's a relationship of
[16:02] love and honor
[16:04] just think about that a home with love
[16:07] and honor between the husband and wife
[16:12] I wish I could get to it today but I'm
[16:14] not going to get to it but the the
[16:16] one of the portions when I speak about
[16:18] this is that it's a it's a beautiful I'm
[16:22] going to try to find this I think it's
[16:24] important I'm going to come back there
[16:29] men and women are different
[16:32] at the very cellular level
[16:34] every cell is marked as either male or
[16:36] female
[16:38] men have denser bones larger hands
[16:40] greater muscle mass men tend to be more
[16:42] aggressive and as a result have a
[16:44] greater tendency to be attracted to
[16:45] conflict competition and Leadership
[16:47] women tend to be attracted to nurturing
[16:50] and relationship building
[16:53] men tend to come part compartmentalize
[16:55] women tend to connect everything men are
[16:58] wired As Leaders women are wired to
[17:00] nurture are the way I would put it is to
[17:02] influence
[17:04] right
[17:08] so I wanted to get that and then go back
[17:11] here
[17:14] likewise your husbands dwell with them
[17:16] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[17:19] the wife as unto the weaker vessel and
[17:21] is being heirs together of the grace of
[17:24] life that your prayers
[17:25] be not hindered so dwell with your wives
[17:30] according to knowledge what knowledge
[17:35] what knowledge should a husband have as
[17:38] he dwells with his wife
[17:40] she's a weaker vessel and your heirs
[17:42] together of the grace of Life airs
[17:44] together she's not inheriting the grace
[17:47] of life through you
[17:49] this was one time the idea
[17:52] there's the head of a household his CH
[17:54] his children his wife his slaves all
[17:57] inherit the grace of life through him so
[18:00] whatever he says that's what everybody
[18:01] has to do and they get the same benefits
[18:03] he's saying
[18:05] whether you are or not pal your wife is
[18:08] has inherited eternal life
[18:11] so you both have are inheriting it
[18:13] together your heirs together so
[18:16] understand that in the eyes of God you
[18:18] stand equally before him
[18:21] at the same time
[18:23] physically speaking she's a weaker
[18:25] vessel when we look at that word vessel
[18:27] we look at Second Corinthians 4 7 says
[18:30] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[18:32] vessels the act that the Excellency of
[18:34] the power may be of God and not of us
[18:36] now remember we go back to the very
[18:39] beginning we go back to the verses we
[18:41] read in Timothy
[18:43] that she he says I suffer not a woman to
[18:46] teach or usurp authority over the man
[18:49] right and she's she's to be in that
[18:51] position because why
[18:53] Adam was first formed then Eve so this
[18:57] is in God's very design
[18:59] it's not a result of the Fall it's not a
[19:02] result of sin God's very design is that
[19:05] the woman is a weaker vessel
[19:08] right and the man is a vice versa the
[19:11] band is a stronger vessel as I just read
[19:14] it's a very cellular level it's a very
[19:17] the way we are designed
[19:19] no matter how many times they try to
[19:21] tell you men I mean they sit in in
[19:24] Congress and they ashamed a young lady
[19:27] because she she was saying I was a
[19:31] swimmer and they put a man in in the
[19:33] team and we had to be all around this
[19:34] nonsense in the locker room and
[19:36] everything and of course they're he's
[19:39] stronger and better than we are right no
[19:42] matter how hard you try to make that not
[19:44] the case men are just merely stronger
[19:47] you look at tennis Serena Williams I
[19:50] think it is played against played and
[19:52] lost multiple times against the 220th
[19:56] ranked tennis player in men's so you see
[20:00] there's a there's a great difference
[20:02] between the strength of a man and a
[20:04] woman we're made differently we're made
[20:06] to have different positions right the
[20:08] man is to be there he's he's the one
[20:10] that should take the hits take the
[20:12] strikes take take the difficulties right
[20:16] he he shouldn't say and say oh my wife
[20:19] will my wife will take all that no we're
[20:22] to stand and be strong and take the
[20:25] difficulties take the trials and be
[20:28] there as a protector
[20:30] and our wife is there to be along our
[20:32] along our side and support us and all
[20:35] that and give us strength many times we
[20:37] as husband receive the strength of our
[20:39] wives because they they love us and they
[20:42] believe in us so they honor us and they
[20:44] try to help help us and push us along
[20:45] it's a beautiful thing
[20:47] that God does there doesn't mean she's
[20:50] weak spiritually or that she's supposed
[20:52] to be weak spiritually proverbs 31 shows
[20:55] us that completely different doesn't
[20:57] even mean she's supposed to be
[20:58] necessarily weak it's just that she is
[21:01] weaker than a man of course a woman
[21:03] should be I believe strong strong in
[21:05] faith
[21:06] ready to face trials together with her
[21:09] husband ready to face trials in her life
