========================================

we already been praying so i'm gonna just get right into it i'm glad to be here all right tonight by the grace of god i want to talk about protection it may sound kind of strange protection but i think as young people or young adults or whatever you want to call yourself it's very important to know that you're protected and to know how to stay protected and i just kind of want to use some examples to show you that everything has to fall on their level of protection you all agree like you take this house what's protecting us from the rain the roof this house will be in some stages no good if it didn't have a roof on it because everything in the house would be damaged by the elements so they put a roof on it to keep everything protected the the walls the furniture the people everything falls under the protection of the roof right so if you think about if this house didn't have a roof it would be subject to the rain snow which we very simply don't get but just all the different seasons and everything that happened and over time the elements will cause damage to everything that's in here because it's not protected even those chairs you sit there are protected like even this table is protected it may look like it's just wood but there's something they put over it to keep your hands and everything else from getting phones in it so there's a level of protection on it can you agree yeah even you as a human vessel there's a level of protection you're walking around with your insides your bones your your vessels uh your veins all these things are protected by what your skin you mean your brain is protected by what your skull so there's no matter no matter how you look at it we all fall under a level of protection so if god orchestrated things that simple what about us in our spiritual journey that there is a protection that god has given us but some of you are walking away from that protection because god one thing about god god gives us his word right he gives us his word his word is here to protect us and if you're not living according to god's word you're not protected so that means at any time the devil can do whatever he wants to do because you're no longer under that protection if we could go back to the to the very beginning god created adam and eve and we know that the enemy couldn't touch them why somebody talked to them why couldn't he touch them they were in a protected garden because they were protected just that simple as long what what kept them protected as long as they obeyed the word of god satan couldn't touch them yeah and you look at what satan brought once they got from behind that protection he brought sickness he brought pain he brought heartache he brought all these different things attributes of unbelief when they stepped from behind that protection so i say unto you you fall subject to all these same things when you come from behind the word like evidence yeah and she thought you know like most of you you would say well it's just my desire you know it's just something i have to overcome but this is the thing what are you doing to overcome what are you doing overcoming look these meetings we're having and and you've been and i commend this church i commend you all for having these these youth gatherings and and these youth meetings and being faithful and coming but what good is it if you're not living by what you hear right if you hear this word over and over again but but but there's something in you that pulls you from behind the word what is it trying to do it's trying to get you to a place to where you're no longer protected and once you're no longer under god's protection it's it's free reign for the devil to do whatever you want and i'm gonna show you some scripts from scripture where people got from behind god's protection and i kind of want to use some young people where they got from behind god's protection and it destroyed their life but before i get into that i always think about the story you know the prophet talked about uh a young girl y'all may may have heard me um refer to this before it was a young girl who grew up in a christian home but the prophet of god said she grew up in a christian home but she chose a whirly boyfriend so although she was in a christian home she never became a christian so she was hearing all the words she had good parents there protecting her how they protecting her by keeping her in a godly atmosphere a good christian home but see like some of you you desire the thing over the fence when god has has as christian parents a christian mama or daddy or whatever you may be you're in a good church what's happening he's trying to keep you protected yeah that's it's it's just very simple because there are things that the enemy is trying to he tries to set up he has trapped for you that you know nothing about until you get from behind that protection see eve didn't know listen eve partook of the forbidden fruit right yeah once she partook forbidden fruit she could never get back and then once she partook of it she started craving y'all understand that once she particularly for being fruit she was like wow i never tasted this before let me go give it to my husband so then what did she do she brought out from under that protection see so you have to be careful the things that you go through can easily influence somebody else and mess up their lives so when we're doing different things we're following what we say our hearts or our desires make sure it's something according to god's word amen because i believe the bible said i may not uh phrase this right but it says that uh the heart is wicked they say the heart is wicked who can trust it yes and i'm sure you i should i'm sure all of us have heard from time to time follow your heart right have you heard that young people have you heard that talk to me follow your heart young girls have you heard that follow your heart well let me tell you something let's make it real real plain follow your heart if you got the holy ghost because if you don't have the holy ghost your unconverted heart will lead you astray because you can be craving and desiring something that has nothing to do with god are you with me but he talked he talked about this he talked about this this young girl who she she grew up in a christian home but she chose a worthy boyfriend and that worldly god who knew nothing about god let me tell you something it's too often that we get in relationships and we're trying to save the person that we know we shouldn't even be talking to right or we're trying to save the person that we know they'll they don't even match up to the protection you're on are you with me because it's like this if you say you say well this person right here you know they're nice and they do so they die and i think they love god see that that thought right there tell you that is wrong the bible says don't be unequally yolked are you with me you know all right it's gonna get a little bit more sticky amen we're just getting started we're getting a little bit more stinky thank you lord you know because you know what i'm i'm to a place to where i'm tired seeing young people sitting in church and it's going in one ear and not the other amen they go they go to camp meetings we have good camps and word of god comes we get in prayer lines and we ask god for deliverance and we go right back to him what happens there's no change there's no change yet you still sit under the protection of who your parents but let's just think about it what if your parents weren't there what kind of life would you have i'm gonna show you in a little bit in the scripture and just just to show you how your parents feel and what how important this protection is let's just let let me show you how this thing works everybody in here got a mother right you know talk to me young people yeah everybody got them up right you know what your mother did when you were born she protected you she made sure you was fed right you know she made sure that you when you were thirsty you had something to drink she made sure when you were cold that you were warm she made sure that you were hot you you get cooled off well it was just something about her to protect you and your dad is in the house he's the same way it was just something about him where he always wants to protect you especially his girls it's just something about you know i'm just i'm missing my oldest girl right now she's married y'all a little daddy she's married joe's a good guy you know i thank the lord for him but i i you know i crack jokes about them because when they first started getting together i didn't really kind of know about it so when i'm playing with them i said joe use a snake but it's all it's all fun and games but but but but i i always say i always say to to young people or uh or to other christian people don't try to do what you see somebody else do because you may not make it you you might end up being an example trying to bring that worldly person into god you know what i mean it don't work out the same for everybody but you know like i was saying this girl she chose a whirly guy and this worldly guy who knew everything about the world and she grew up in a christian home but she never became a christian so she never became a christian what do you think was going to happen to her life she was going to follow the tendencies of the world and let me let me tell you this so will you if you never have a real experience with god you will go the way of the world and satan will destroy it there's no there's no other way to put it you can't stand in a neutral zone and say well i got good parents i come from a good home you know everything is okay but what are you craving because the thing that you're craving is what you're gonna go after yeah sure listen listen to this how many know what it means to have a desire okay now i want you to think about the things that you desire now how much of that is of god what you're craving with your desire listen desire desire means to wish or long for crave or want now you think about it if it's not of god you're craving that thing there's something inside of you that ain't gonna stop until it gets it yeah because you're craving it you're gonna do whatever you can do to get to it you want it there is a desire there that you longing for you know what it means alone for something when you long for something that means it has your heart yeah are you with me listen to express or wish to obtain and the reason why i like this definition because you even try to get spiritual with god they say lord you know you know my heart yeah he know your heart he know your heart ain't converted if you're craving the wrong things or we even will even say well lord lord why do you let this come my way yeah don't blame it on god listen say to ask or request but this is the one i like as a noun craving see i like words that you can use in a noun form or you're using a verb form you know you use you use uh desire as a noun and as a verb but as of now it says a longing or craving ask for something that brings satisfaction how many of you know what it means to be satisfied yeah you know everybody you know all right i'll tell you right now what you did this morning made you satisfied how many y'all went to school this morning number y'all ain't none of y'all in school [Laughter] but think about it when you got dressed this morning you have a certain clothes a blob or a dress a pair of jeans or shirt whatever it was you laid it out you ironed it you put it on you looked in the mirror and if it looked right what were you satisfied and you went you walked out that door with a level of satisfaction you know having a craving or desire is the same thing as that it's something you put on and you're not going to stop until you satisfy if it's something coming out of your spirit but you know back to this girl again this boy that she chose who wasn't a christian now she grew up in a christian home how many of y'all grew up in a christian home now you say brody why are you going this way because i want you to examine are you any different from her what makes you really different from this girl she grew up in a christian home but she chose a whirly boy and that whirly boy one day got her to smoke cigarettes i bet that she wasn't even looking to smoke cigarettes but that's the kind of guy she chose she was craving that kind of guy and all these other different all these other different doors were open based upon what she was craving now she didn't she probably didn't know right there cigarettes was gonna come along with that craving just that tall dark and handsome boy he also had a pack of cigarettes and then one day he probably was out talking and because she was craving him she stopped smoking with influence she started smoking with what was happening she was losing her protection now she's doing things that she wasn't raised to do and then one day it was out and they were having a good time and she didn't realize it he put some alcohol in the drink and she started drinking next thing you know now she's smoking cigarettes and she's drinking all of us came along with the boys she craved and then once he once he he got out with the cigarettes then he gathered with the drinking next thing he did he took advantage of her body now he got the whole package everything about it did you know what he did after that he dumped her look at what her craving got her look at what her desires got her desire made her lose all her protection as long as she was in that house raised by good christian parents listening to the word of god staying behind listen let me tell you something if you've got christian folks and if they're preaching a word to you they're trying to give you good christian standards what are they doing they're protecting you they're protecting you but what happens brother brethren say we fight so he said it's not god's will god's desire that anybody should go [Music] some of you got two roadblocks in your house one called mama and one called daddy and you fuss and fight with those road blocks because you craving something but once you get past those wrong blocks you're no longer protected anything can happen there and this young girl got so messed up just from that one boy she chose she turned into a prostitute then she turned into a junkie y'all know what a junkie is yeah she turned to the junction and while we own that there's no such thing as casual drugs right let me tell you something if i can say it like this if i can say it like this in our day the weed or the blood that was being smoked came from a tree it came from the ground but this stuff they smoking not come out of the laboratory yeah and it has so many chemicals in it so many things that makes your body crave to a place that you get hooked on it and then you can't get away from it because it's made in the laboratory and all these guys why you think they make it illegal because it's a business it's a business but what happened what happened this girl because of the guy she chose she turned to a prostitute you know what happened after that she went to jail and once she got in jail she started thinking about her protection she's like man i was raised better than us so she got hooked up with the nomination the catholic church and she she i think it's called good shepherd she got hooked up with them and she started getting her life back right and everything and let's watch you while she was in solitary confinement while she was in jail you know listen i always say this if you're doing wrong getting caught don't bring repentance right he didn't conscience mean you got caught correct and that's what happened with a lot of young people they get caught and they'd be like well you know i'm just i just want to do better i'm so tired don't take my phone you don't take my ass please you know you ain't sorry you just don't you just don't want them to alter your lifestyle correct but true repentance will take away that fact but that's what happened too often young people get caught doing their own thing and not just by your parents you get caught sometimes sitting in church and the preachers start preaching them and what is that that's god trying to bring you back under that protection yeah how often young people you've come to church you hear god talk to you talk to you let's make a real personal talk to you about things you have confessed to your parents that's how god works what i'm trying to show you what i'm trying to tell you is every secret you got god knows about him but god is so loving he'll come and express himself to you and let you know he knows to try to keep you protected but what we do is we push and push down we pushed all the way because we want that thing so bad and now she got what she wanted she got it and what she wanted turned into a drug addict turned into a smoker a drunk a prostitute and now she's trying to get it right she goes she goes to good shepherd she hook up with the with the people in jail you know in jail even when you're in jail you're gonna get some preaching you might think oh i'm in jail i can't hear you oh they don't see the chaplain you still get some preaching in jail you can't get away from god man but she's in jail and she tries to get her life together and once she she's like this is it i'm going back to god look at what made her eyes even turn back to god look at her life she didn't have to go that route she didn't have to go that route she grew up in a christian home that's what i'm saying to you what the world has to offer let me tell you a lot of it you don't want [Music] let's go back to that moment okay go back to the mamas listen what that mama do i'm gonna tell you what your mama did to you you was walking across the street anybody ever remember holding them on my hand or they got a hand and it's a busy road out there and you walk across the street and cars coming and she picked you up and threw you out there hit my bed i'm so sick of this baby i gotta alter my life because of this baby oh i'm running out of money because of this baby no they didn't do that you know what they did if you tried to run out there they grabbed you by your shirt and snatched you back why because they were your protector right how many of you ever remember falling down and one of your parents coming to you cuddling you or or get your womb together or making sure you wasn't hurt no more any of y'all remember that why didn't why didn't she just come over there and say wait wait what does it hurt what does it hurt and you like it they didn't do that what did they do they tried to make it better right why because there's something in them to protect you and i say i'll have to say this so if they would act like that when you were small and protect you why would you ever think now that you're older they wouldn't stop trying to protect you they're still operating under that same love remember the car was coming they didn't say hey just just go in here just go run them over i'm tired they didn't do that they snatched you out of danger they snatched you out of the way this is an example my pastor like to use is probably a good example because we had tony house what do you say who said you take a you take a uh uh a machine gun right and you can take that machine gun as an adult you can spray it all over the place because you know what it can do he said but you put that same machine gun and the baby in and baby walk around what you gonna do why because the baby doesn't know the power of that gun is home the baby doesn't know what the effect of what they're about to do can happen to other people yeah and that's how that's how we do as parents you can't see what we can see sometimes all we're trying to do is keep you protected all your passing and the different preachers in here all they're trying to do is keep you protected so this girl she's in good shepherd now and she she she uh per se gets her life right she gets out of jail and she's like i'm gonna live better but then she goes right back into the same old stuff again [Music] so much until all the stuff she was doing drove her to an insane insider she found herself in a crazy house y'all don't know anybody in the crazy house i'll tell you i think y'all know more people than y'all think yeah some of y'all friends stay in the crazy house you said brothers what you mean by that ain't no college standard in the house so anything goes any young man any uncle any unconverted father to his son go and experience life sow your wild enjoy yourself you only live once all he's doing is telling that boy just go kill yourself yeah right oh oh a mother who tells up tells her daughter just don't fall in love with one boy date at least 21st she's basically telling her daughter you just destroy your life yeah so really they're staying in a crazy house yeah spiritually speaking y'all go back and get to school and say yeah brother say you crazy yo a little bit to go but she got out of jail and she went right back into it and she went further into it why because the spirit was still there yeah she never got converted she never got real protection and now she found herself in an insane institution and brother brown comes in and look he comes in and what does he see what does he see he looks at her she's a beautiful young lady nice looking hair pretty eyes all that but emily she's messed up you don't want to be in that condition you got a nice hairdo you're dressing nice you're looking good but inside you messed up that's a miserable person yeah so she begins to tell brother brandon the story that's how we know it she told her to cry she told how her life got all messed up and all these things and it led her to insane institution and he actually said wouldn't you want to be a a wife and have children and everything and she's like yes i've always desired that and he got talking with him he said you know what stopping you from doing that she said it's a spirit there's a spirit in your life that's stopping you from living a a fully surrendered life for god she said i've always believed that see she always knew that she wasn't doing right but she would never surrender to but now her life is so messed up and this part against me why do you get to that point before you try jesus it's so much more satisfying when you don't have all that baggage right if i can be transparent it's so much more satisfying as a young man when you got to think about every other girlfriend you had comparing it to your wife yeah it's so much more satisfying as a young wife when you ain't got you you got to have mind battles about how he treated you versus the last boy treated you it's so much more satisfying when you stay protected but what they did they had a prayer meeting right there in the insane institution and she got down to pray like some of y'all do that camp she got down and prayed and it was a real sober moment and she she prayed and she lift her hands and she's like i'm delivered i feel like you all know what it's like to have a real breakthrough for those of y'all don't let me tell you what a real breakthrough a real breakthrough is when you don't desire those things that's a real break that means that spirit has left you and that craving that desire has left you and it's no longer there to make you do those things that you don't want to do all right let's look at some people in the bible amen praise god hallelujah uh before i before we turn the bible let me read this quote it says now we find this great enemy of god tonight now as long as they will believe that word i can never get to them so he's talking to satan satan knows as long as you believe the word he can't touch you because that's your protection as long as that little family in e keeps behind the word i can never touch them neither can he today see the same standard god laid out there for eve is the same standard for us as long as we stay behind the word the devil can't touch us the world is our protection he says neither can he today amen he's still blocked off can you believe that the devil is blocked off he'll be blocked off from your mind your body your spirit if you apply the word in your life he says i'll give you some you he says but if you can if you can use the same real good a strategy and just reason out he said i give some human reasoning because she's human and if i can just give human reasoning then we'll win the battle see that's what satan gives you with just a little bit of human reasoning you say well god you know my heart human reasoning satan and his angels but then if he would have stayed behind the word the enemy could have never touched him do y'all agree with that all right one thing i want you to understand tonight as i'm reading the scriptures this is not brother dean's words so don't walk out here saying brother dee said no the bible says amen the bible says how many y'all love god amen amen everybody everybody do you really i got a scripture i wanted to read but i'm just paraphrasing when i was around your age like this having bible study my mama had one big family bible probably like a big old bookshelf and and and unlike some of us well she her bible studies was on the tribulation period about getting left behind and some of y'all don't even know about that you've heard it in church but you ain't paying no attention there will be a rapture and there will be a the thing is you better decide which way you want to go because you get every opportunity now to stay protected but one day she asked me the same question i asked you you love god what kind of question is that of course i love god that's me not like i know i love god okay love god she turned me over to john your first john second john i wanted to take over john she said read and and the script don't paraphrase your scripture he said the scriptures say if anyone say they love god right we did we [Music] so if you say you love god and you're not keeping his commandments the scripture says you're alive and the truth now i don't know what that did for you but for me it hit me like a ton of bricks on the bricks why because i said i love god but then my life wasn't matching up so i really didn't love god sort of like the rich young ruler he said jesus what can i do to be perfect he said keep the commandments he said man i've done that for my youth but then he said go sell everything you gotta come follow me he couldn't do it so really he couldn't keep his command yeah i want to commit he couldn't keep okay let's go to uh i don't know if i want to read this let's let's read second second second 7 13. second samuel chapter 13. um this is the story between amnon and taymar a brother and sister daughter and david's son but david's son he had the hops for his sister and you know she was like nah nah go ahead come on [Music] was very persistent and just write write this if y'all gotta clean write the scripture down and go back and you can go back and read the whole the rest of it is i'm gonna kind of care for you for the sake of time but it's second samuel chapter 13. so what i did you know uh tamar rejected him so what am not did he was like look i got to get close to so what he did was he faked like he was sick so that she could come serve him and once he once he got along he was like you know i love you and he's pledging his love and all this stuff and on and on and she's like dude look at it you my brother cut that foolishness out you know what he he's still carrying all you know i love you and my heart and you know this and that and blah blah blah she's like whatever dude so he played like he was sick got him coming in just to to serve him and he said come just lie with me you know let's just fall in love and she's like no no no and he took advantage of him he took advantage of him and after he took advantage of her his feelings changed once he took advantage of it he got what he wanted he looked at and said you know what i can't even stand you get just just get out my presence as adults how often we see that happening in the world a young man he moves and he rules and tell a girl i love you and i do so not that till he gets what he wants and once he gets what he wants he's like man just just don't even call me no more i say to your name ig block twitter blocked snapchat blocked and now she's sitting there with a broken heart but the bible says she was defiant don't put yourself in positions you can't get out of but then you know what happened just to make it just make the story short her big brother found out about it absalon after that i said uh this ain't gonna happen you know what he did okay he killed his brother kill his brother for the foul on his sister now you got a whole house and an uproar because one brother couldn't control himself but we're talking about protection right and desire all right y'all go back and read that let's move on get your bibles and let's turn to um so we can kind of get out of here we know the story of samson amen very familiar what was samson's greatest problem it wasn't just women he wanted a woman his mom and daddy didn't approve of i'm gonna read it to you judge is 14. and listen listen to the mom and daddy trying to keep sampson protected judges 14 let's start at verse 2. he said he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman of of timnath of the daughters of the philistines you know the philistines of the enemy yeah right he knew this was the girl of the enemy he knew this was a girl he shouldn't even be thinking about but look he was crazy you know she probably was an instagram mom he said now therefore listen listen the audacity of samson knowing his parents don't agree he said he's seen a woman you see a woman she's from the daughter of the philistine and look what he will tell his parents now therefore get her for me the wife is that something how often you want your christian parents to go against their convictions and give you some worthiness just basically help you be unprotected no no listen what the dad said say then his father and his mother said unto him is there not a woman among the daughters of the brother basically like we tell y'all is there not a christian young man or a christian young girl in the message but you know sounds he said is there not a woman among the daughters of the brother or among all my people that thou goes to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistine and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleases me well you know what was happening right there samson was stepping from under that protection did he get him talked to him you know what else he got when he got he got his eyes plucked out and look just what matt this would always kill me about the story of samson right y'all know the story delilah was like if you love me you tell me your secret right i don't see that what you doing in the scripture go back and read it judges 14 all right y'all write this down go back and read it we talk about protection that's how delilah will play with him she used the word love and we just throw that around now like you know i love you you love me you know she says you love when you take your secret and sad to come up with a real little sandwich and tie my hands and she would do it [Music] tell me how to kill you it sounds to be like hey just tie my hand behind my back and she's like okay ty's everybody back why would you want to date somebody that's trying to kill you i ain't making this stuff up and she did at least three or four times sam said top time i have whatever put it in the braid or whatever put his hair in the brace sounds he had to pick the gates up and run up the hill and look at that because the guy was still on but every everything he told delilah how he would lose his strength basically this is how you kill me she will do it why would you want somebody like that to the place there's another scripture where the bible says samson got vexed all the stuff he was doing it wasn't bringing him no job it was just a game to him but he didn't realize this girl he was taken up with really was gonna try to kill him got to the place to where he was so blinded by his own cravings his own desires to sampson fell asleep after he told delilah his real secret with his head and her lap well that's dangerous now he's sleeping with the enemy and what happened she called them in they plucked samson out plucked samson eyes out all that because he didn't listen to his mama in the day he had got a warning according to the scripture he had gotten warned from his parents his parents were trying to tell him hey son stay protected no he got to play around with the loud you know his eyes got plugged out then he found himself in the dungeon they make his play laughing them playing with him at one point they couldn't chuck sounds you know why because he was living by a nazarite vibe he was protected are you with me he was protected and as long as he was protected the enemy couldn't touch him delilah couldn't touch nobody could touch him but once he got from behind that vibe he was just a regular person and so are we when we get from behind the word of god we're not better than anybody else samson's life was really a tragedy because he could have did so much more but he let a wicked woman steal his joy all right i don't know why i'm talking about relationships so much tonight hmm it's kind of interesting be careful who you choose yeah even the ones in your very own church because if they ain't converted they don't leave no good i'm gonna end with this one i'm gonna paraphrase this one we've all heard of solomon right silent with david's son the bible says he was the wisest man on the earth at that time but solomon was so wise he couldn't stay away from strange women and it was those strange women that caused his defeat god said stay away from those strange women solomon they're gonna turn your heart from me and that's exactly what happened even though he was the wisest man at that time he was so wise but not wise enough to listen to god's warning and protection don't ever think you got it all mapped out stay behind this word last one i'm gonna read luke 15 luke chapter 15. and we all know this story right here this is the story of the prodigal son you know that one right everybody no doubt i wonder if i pick one of y'all y'all tell me the story of the proper song cause you do you never heard it before but think about this this young man i'm a paraphrase story this young man grew up in a good christian house you know but then he started getting a little older it was him and his brother his dad didn't say much about his mama but i'm sure he had mama but now he's getting to the point where maybe he got his license and you know he got a good little job or whatever the case is and he's kind of tired of living in a christian atmosphere he kind of want to get out and do his own thing you know but he's not he's not he don't know what he's about to get into as long as he's at his father's house he's protected so he goes to his dad and he's like hey dad look here i want my money now i can't wait you died because i won't i want my insurance policy i don't even i won't everything right now i'm sure the scripture don't say but i'm sure your daddy probably tried to plead with him say son you really don't want to do this like yeah daddy i'm ready to just give just give it to me don't hold me no more i'm grown just give it to me so daddy gathered up all that he had for him gave it to him and let him go first thing he does he's getting hooked up with some worldly friends why don't we do that as soon as we get a little aged we get hooked up with the world or as soon as you know your parents start to trust you or give you a little leeway first thing you do is get hooked up with your worthy friends and you don't influence them they influence you and cause your house to get all messed up because you about to get somebody to protect you so now he got all his friends and you know he got all the money he's spending all the money everything you know he throwing the super bowl party he's doing it all he's doing everything he got barbecue wings he got everything hey come on daddy says all right it's all right they're gonna be there [Music] they say it's all right everything is good everything is good but but but he gets all this stuff and then he gets out with his friends they suck at him dry as long as he got money he got friends you know he's buying the drinks he's buying the food you know he's buying gas and buying everything the bible says this is what i want to read it says that not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living now you know his parents didn't teach him that his parents didn't teach him righteous living so where did he get it from probably something he been looking at on his phone probably some of you been watching on youtube something he been craving and once he got out there it became that you know he he wilding out he all into he's just having a good time the bible says riot is living it says and when he has spent all there was a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in one and you know what happened all his friends were gone yeah all the people that he thought was his butt you know what i'm gonna give you a secret for those of you who say you got friends right and and no doubt some of your friends might be in school or different things people whatever the case is if they i want i want to give you a test to show they're really your friends just choose one day and make your conversation about god every time they talk every time you talk bring up god whatever they say i said man you know uh what we're gonna eat for lunch today say well you know jesus turned water in the wine say well i want to think i wonder we got chick-fil-as they know i know one time in the bible we created some fish some bread just let your conversation be about god see if they get to know it and they ain't getting annoyed at you they get annoyed at the word and the word is who you are they get to know that you just try i told my my oldest girl one time i preached i preached a message about the blood and i i don't know if i'd be here but i took a black handkerchief and i sprayed it with clo rocks i sprayed it with clorox knowing that clorox was gonna make that black handkerchief white and i'm sure that that's the power of the blood the blood the blood can take away all your scenes so i told i told her i said hey pin this bag on your book track and see how many people ask you what happened to the right then you can testify you tell people but just just just think about your conversation is your conversation more of your protection or more of the things you're trying to get from under and this guy once he got riots living all of us everything he got nothing you know what he was about to do somebody take what was mine anybody know he had got so long he found himself with the pigs now how many of y'all will go down and sit down with pigs and say what we finna eat today that's how he got he got so low he was willing to eat sloth that's how long he got he lost all his protection but then he clicked in that moment when he was about to eat some flocking man i got a mama i got a daddy at home who loves me he got servants his servants he better listen i'm going back home and i'm challenging you tonight if you may be out there somewhere we want you to come back home come back home to a house where you're protecting a family where you're protected a church where you're protecting the atmosphere you're protected that's what this young man was coming back to he was coming back to that protection and as he was approaching what made the story so good he didn't come back home like hey man just you know what i supposed to be here he didn't come back like that he came back home he came back basically with his head by asking his daddy for mercy but his daddy what did he do he showed that same love like i'll talk about with the mom he showed that say no he said man you my son come on back in here you know give him a roll put a ring on his finger let's have a feast because my son was once blind now he can see he's come back home see there's nothing you can do that would make your parents stop loving you all they want you to do is just do it right live right take advantage of this lifestyle that they're giving you amen because it can turn out to be something really really great for you and this young man he repented came back home you know and his daddy blessed him and put him right back under the protection how many of y'all understood what i'm talking about i'm gonna stop right there and the just the just of my whole thought tonight is don't be in such a hurry to get from under this protection but while you're here take advantage of it really let god in so he can protect your heart let him in so he can protect your mind and your spirit you know he can protect your thoughts and everything about you let god in because he's the only one that can stop the devil in his tracks you know if we think about tonight these these youth meetings that we have and you know we come here and we do this faithfully but how many young people are really taking advantage of us it's more than just some good ham sandwiches some good cookies and some some fellowship the fellowship is good but there's a bigger picture there's a bigger picture you guys can take this to a whole nother level you can take this to a whole nother level and what i mean by i mean that by christ-centered life i know some of you depending on where is that you be like man i ain't going to i ain't gonna i don't want to go there i'm gonna go this time but if you feel like you're gonna have a little fun it's gonna be a good crowd or whatever it's gonna be you gonna come you're gonna you're gonna be but see there's something bigger than that god is trying to expose you to his fullest expose you to himself but you got to take advantage of it stay protected remember when your parents are talking to you remember mama didn't just take you and throw you out there in front of the car no she kind of [Music] she got it some of y'all swear i don't even realize it so y'all didn't realize this without your parents you wouldn't be walking they helped you walk y'all realize that they help you out if you didn't have a parent encouraging you to stand on your feet some of y'all to walk around right now [Music] but you crawled and you crawled into their parents stood you up they do your legs are strong enough and they say come on baby come on baby come on to me come up to me and you take a step why because you felt the love of that parent now you can't you don't know that we got pictures of it some of us got videos we got pictures of you taking your first steps and everything see that's the love a parent had but even when you failed they were there to catch you protected so what on god's green earth would make you think now they're not they don't have your best interest in mind [Music] this this this this this is what i want y'all to do close your eyes bow your head that's why i want to challenge you in your own time if you're struggling with anything i want you to go to that parent and just have a one-on-one with them talk to them about it they're not there to make you feel bad they're not there to put you on punishment what they're there to do is to keep you protected and the greatest love besides the great the the love of god is the love of a parent lover pastor or a good church atmosphere so if you're struggling with anything now is the time to let that go and that's god see there's life the devil the power of tone what comes out of your mouth can materialize you got the power right now to change your desires you got the power right now to step away from that thing that you've been craving see real sanctification is not just how you dress when wearing a dress or skirt or some long pants what if no real sanctification is when you don't desire those things anymore let's pray lord jesus follow us lord only you know the hearts of your children right now lord probably don't want to seem like we're harping on them and we're trying to make them feel and they're not worthy but lord we know what it means to be protected yes not even some of us are parents we we've gone astray when we had good parents leading us up in this truth but like samson we had our own desires we had our eyes on something that wasn't good for us and we got it lord not only did we get it we got those same scars to this day that we can remember when we went astray but by your grace you brought us back lord and now we're here lord over the groups of children and our families lord our church lord and you're giving us to protect love lord we pray over them lord we ask that you be merciful lord and that the spirit of pride don't take a hold of them and they don't think they know everything but that they got it all under control father i pray you give more grace lord even in our wrongs lord you made a way for us to be right lord i pray you touch each and every life in here right now lord each and every heart in here right now let us let us gather and go from just a gathering lord to an outpouring and outpouring in a feeling of your spirit lord for your ways are higher than our ways your thoughts are higher than i thought so and all we may have thought that we've come just to keep a schedule of the youth meeting but you brought us here for a purpose lord and lord god we pray lord that no man no thoughts of any man will get in the way of this moment right now but you will take your place on the hearts of your people lord we bind every evil spirit in the name of jesus christ that'll try to hide itself that'll try to slowly creep in and steal these children we bind it right now in jesus christ's name we buying every religious team that'll sometimes make them think just because they're in church they all right lord we pray that the holy spirit will come lord and move everything that's not like you i'm doing lord jesus just be merciful unto us give us grace lord to fulfill your will lord we pray lord there's something saying lord that will stick in the name of jesus christ lord not our will but let thy will be done in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] [Music] is he [Music] is [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] how great is our god [Music] is [Applause] [Music] my will sing how great is [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] how great is our god everybody [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] unto the lord [Music] right now in this moment if there's anything you're craving anything you're desiring that's pulling you out of the protection of god just lift your hands to god lift your hands to god and say lord you have to say it to me say it to god say it to the lord say lord take this away from me let it come out of your mouth let the confession come out of your mouth because confession is one of the most powerful words that god has given unto us a committal is one of the greatest weapons god has given to us you may not cannot get yourself out of it but give it to god don't be afraid to give to god as anything you're craving say lord i give this to you right now in the name of jesus christ god bless each and every head all [Music] you know the very thing that's pulling them that's trying to bring them from under under your protection and in the name of jesus christ we bind it right now amen and we give it over unto you lord amen lord and we pray father you would give them the grace and the will and the desire lord to commit that thing unto you amen lord and look for a change in their lives to look for a greater first in you lord and lord from this moment from this time on lord let them never crave that thing again amen in the mighty glorious name of jesus christ we pray and we thank you somebody say amen amen you believe god did it for you somebody saying man hey man somebody somebody give us a song i'm gonna get out the way so i just wanted to talk something i just wanted to talk to you guys one-on-one and the holy spirit i know without a shadow of a doubt and i just felt impressed to stop just for our young people here just for a moment to say from me to you guys this wasn't brother diggs this wasn't just brother dick so you came from columbia drove here and spoke to you like brother diggs has many times but that was the lord jesus and i want to make you i want to make you as aware as i'm aware how specific don't miss it don't miss it don't let it just roll i watched don't let it roll off your mind as all that's just brother diggs and and miss and just don't as as the bible says don't just be a hearer of the word you know we get good at hearing we're really good at hearing we hear a lot of sermons a lot of preaching here a lot of youth services a lot of good things are said we've had some powerful things said the last time brother was out there on the patio said some powerful things and i still remember remember brother diggs every time he's spoken at our church or something specific let me just stop and say tonight was even more different than that yeah and i know and i'm just going to speak real personal guys i don't normally do this but i'm just going to speak real personal and say i know i watched as the holy spirit began to speak and i watched i'm just going to say it like this i'll watch resistance on some of you and i know your mind was going to war and going to battle and i'm just going to go ahead and say this i didn't talk to other things now those of you who there are some of you who know exactly what i'm speaking about right now and some of you won't that's fine i promise i give you my word i didn't have a conversation with other things i was so blown away i texted another brother and said did you say something to brother diggs before he right before he came we'll miss before he came up here to speak to us nope not a word i know that's what some of you were thinking i'm positive you were thinking oh they had brother diggs they let him in on what's going on that he knows what's going on and so they said something to him i didn't say nothing what you watched was a blood hammer who yielded himself to the holy spirit the other day he sat over there at that table and said brother matt's what i want to speak of i want to talk about protections that sounds good brother davis i want to talk about this i didn't say nothing i sat there and listened and heard and watched brother dick just go down online and so i don't want you to miss it don't chalk this up as brother diggs just got lucky i think that ain't like that was divinely spoken specific to specific situations in this group so let me just reiterate just for a moment let me just reiterate and say listen to what you heard about boundaries brother diggs talked about protection and he gave us story after story and tamar and and samson and delilah and he talked about samson's parents you know what's incredible what's incredible is that samson looked at mom and dad but mom and dad are saying man come on samson what are you doing isn't there any girls from among our own people that you've got to go and take from the daughter of the philistines and samson says get her you know the problem was when you read that in judges 13 14 wherever you were reading from brother davis when you read that and samson's saying just get her and you're thinking what are you doing are you crazy samson what are you doing you know what the problem was is the problem with me when i was a teenager when i was your age i looked at mom and dad when mom and dad would sit me down and they'd tell me and if they point to something i had done something i was doing and they'd start to give me this lecture there we go here's the lecture and you look at them and that's just mom that's just dad they don't understand that's his mom that's his death you know what samson didn't recognize is that it wasn't mom and dad it was vessels of mercy right that were trying to put a roadblock in samson's leg to say turn around go the other way stop hazard road closed do not enter you ever seen those while you're driving down the road you see the yellow flashing light saying turn around stop don't enter road closed bridge is broken how many people are y'all know someone else gets in their car and just drives right through those barricades and just bam bam sandbags barrels going everywhere and they just go right through the right through the broken bridge you know anybody that does that no but i know people who do that when god puts barrier after barrier after barrier after barrier and then god sends a servant brother dicks and then he sends out another warning sign now i just want to stop here for a moment because i can't do what brother diggs did here tonight parents can't do tony and amber can't do jason amy stephen emily the rest of us brad and sarah we can't do we we have weapons that we use to attack the devil and and his and his and his workings in our own kid's life what brother diggs did we can't do i couldn't have said the same the things that brother dick said that meant the same thing to my own kids and even some of you but brother dave don't know you like i know you don't know you like your parents know you brother diggs wasn't privy to anything happening and yet the servant of the lord yielded himself so i just want to not i just didn't want us to sing and then we go about our business and we miss this moment when the lord is trying to use trying to speak so i just want to take just a moment and slow down for a second and say don't miss this word from the lord because it was direct it was direct and for some of you it was for every single one of you young old for every single one of you but i believe the holy spirit has the answer do you believe that young people the lord has the answer and it isn't mom and dad and you you think that they're just you know oh that's mom that's bad and they're just let me just stop and say there's there's no time there's no uh there's no moral uh you know authority speaking when i s when you when when i speak to you when you when your parents speak to you it isn't from some pers some position of moral authority that you know i'm so good and i'm so righteous and you're so wrong and you need to straighten up that's not why that's not why brother matt stops what he's doing could've just came up here and saying he closed the meeting it was good why i'm constrained to stop and and compel you is because i love you you know what love does when you love somebody that means you value who they are you value who they are as a person right and because i love you and i value who you are mike i value you noah caleb now started calling names i gotta call everybody i value all of you and because of that value that i hold for you because i love you then there's action that comes behind that to where i'll speak the truth even if it hurts your feelings and i am so thankful that god sends people in my life when i need to be corrected and i have friends who love me enough they can come and tell me the truth you know what a false prophet is a person who'll tell you everything you want to hear but a true prophet a true a true minister of the lord doesn't does he doesn't spare your feelings doesn't care if it's going to hurt you he's going to speak the truth and so because of love i'm constrained to say don't chalk this up don't let the devil rob you and think oh brother brother matt rachel amber tony someone said something i know someone brad sarah mentioned something they had a conversation for the days that didn't happen what happened brother diggs i heard brother dicks he sat here and he said man i just can't get off relationships and he stopped and said interesting never heard nick say that he couldn't get off of it you know why because the lord jesus now i've watched this i've watched brother dave's i could say over a dozen times come because he's got a gift in his life god gives gifts and i've watched brother diggs in our assembly over a dozen times come not knowing a thing drove straight out of work from columbia two hours gets the church gets in a pulpit and then he starts to speak direct words of things i spoke to my kids or me and my wife out of conversation and he repeats it the same way that i said it and he's black and i'm white and he don't talk like me he said the same way i said now you laugh but that's i'm serious brother dicks had said statements before and it's i've never brothered wouldn't say it like that but he said it just how i said it just so god can confirm to me and say that's not brother diggs that's me yeah i've watched that happen over and over and over and over again i want to say thank you brother biggs thank you for yielding and let the lord use you let's bow our heads all stand up bow your heads with me young people lord we just stop just for a moment not letting this moment lower because it's too special amen the devil would just want us to hurry and get past it move on but lord it's moments like these that we can stop and we can contemplate and lord you called us to do that your word teaches us to examine ourself to test ourselves see if we'd be in the faith to make our call to the election short so lord your word came here tonight it was very laser guided i believe lord jesus it's you it's not me it's not it's all of our effort lord and everything we're trying to do is trying to do anything we can to help these young people who we love so much that we've been right where they're at lord we're in the trenches fighting with them now we're not their enemy don't ever let the devil tell them that there's nobody here nobody working with the young people that's their enemy we put these kind of things on not to chastise not to not to rebuke lord that's not what it's about it's not pointing a finger and and and trying to condemn lord but because of love because we love them because we care for them because we value who they are lord then we hold gatherings like this we invite ministers and a brother comes and the word is spoken and even brother diggs didn't know why he was staying on what he was speaking about couldn't make sense of it lord but you do now god i just asked that you would allow each one of us who are just clay full of mistakes and failures and faults lord i pray that you'd be mindful as we raise our hands tonight as the man lord said i believe lord but help thou my unbelief raise my hand right now lord as brother diggs lord ask for a prayer and i'll say it again lord god as we bow before you and speak to you again may you search our hearts lord god there be anything that's pulling us trying to pull us out of the protection that you've ordained for our life may you rebuke the enemy in our life and we'll give you all the glory and the honor in jesus christ [Music] take not thy [Music] restore unto me the joy of our salvation [Music] and renew our right spirit [Music] created [Music] [Music] within me [Music] me [Music] and casting [Music] and take not thy holy [Music] restore unto me [Applause] [Music] let's give brother diggs a hand emerald now before we go i got to know what when brother dave was talking about what mom takes their baby and when you go to walk in front of you let's go i gotta know why abby raised her hand what is going on because i watched abby laughing then i watched tony giggle that i watched amber get up and walk over here we gotta know bro we gotta know the story trauma i am not a bad mom but there was this one time all right god bless you guys
