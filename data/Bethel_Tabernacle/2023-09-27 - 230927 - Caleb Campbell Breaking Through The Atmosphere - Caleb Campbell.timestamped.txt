[20:24] house of God tonight Saints amen
[20:28] good to be here let's just turn right
[20:30] into the word tonight we're going to
[20:31] open up our Bibles here in the
[20:34] Philippians 3.
[20:35] Philippians 3
[20:37] this thought has been burning heavy on
[20:39] my heart the last few weeks I pray it
[20:41] can be a a blessing and encourage our
[20:43] hearts tonight did we come expecting to
[20:45] hear from the Lord tonight amen praise
[20:48] the Lord we'll have two portions of
[20:50] scriptures we're going to open with
[20:51] first in Philippians 3 and then we'll
[20:53] turn over into Hebrews
[20:56] Philippians 3 and verse 7 we're going to
[21:00] start in verse 7.
[21:05] amen and it says
[21:11] but what things were gained to me those
[21:14] I counted lost for Christ
[21:17] yea doubtless and I count all things but
[21:21] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[21:24] of Christ Jesus my Lord
[21:26] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[21:29] things
[21:30] and do count them but dung that I may
[21:32] win Christ and be found in him not
[21:35] having mine own righteousness which is
[21:38] of the law
[21:39] but that which is through the Faith of
[21:41] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[21:45] by faith
[21:48] that I may know him and the power of his
[21:50] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[21:52] sufferings being made conformable unto
[21:55] his death if by any means I might attain
[21:58] unto the resurrection of the Dead
[22:00] not as though I had already attained
[22:03] either were already perfect but I follow
[22:06] after if that I may apprehend that which
[22:09] that for which also I am apprehended of
[22:12] Christ Jesus
[22:14] Brethren I count not myself to have
[22:16] apprehended but this one thing I do
[22:19] forgetting those things which are behind
[22:22] and reaching forth unto those things
[22:25] which are before so we have to reach
[22:27] forth into something but before we do
[22:29] that he says we have to forget those
[22:31] things that are behind he says then I
[22:33] press towards the mark for the prize of
[22:36] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[22:39] hey man I want to actually uh pick up a
[22:42] few verses of that in the NLT verse 12
[22:44] says I don't mean to say that I've
[22:46] already achieved these things or that I
[22:48] have already reached Perfection but I
[22:51] press on to possess that Perfection for
[22:53] which Christ Jesus first possessed me
[22:57] no dear brothers and sisters I have not
[22:59] achieved it but I focus on this one
[23:02] thing forgetting the past and looking
[23:04] forward to what lies ahead
[23:06] I press on to reach the end of the race
[23:10] and receive the Heavenly prize for which
[23:12] God through Christ Jesus is calling us
[23:14] let us all who are spiritually mature
[23:18] agree on these things
[23:19] if you agree disagree on some point I
[23:21] believe God will make it plain to you
[23:22] let's turn over in the scriptures to
[23:24] Hebrews the 11th chapter
[23:38] and the evidence
[23:40] for by it the elders obtained a good
[23:42] report through faith we understand that
[23:45] the worlds were framed by the word of
[23:47] God so that things which are seen were
[23:50] not made of things which do appear
[23:54] and I'd like to take a text for
[23:55] tonight's service out of those two
[23:56] scriptures titled breaking through the
[23:59] atmosphere
[24:05] Heavenly Father Lord God we just bow our
[24:07] hearts tonight before you Lord Jesus
[24:09] father we're just coming to you under a
[24:11] full surrender Lord we ask that you
[24:13] would come and break the bread of life
[24:15] to us tonight father we pray that you
[24:17] would anoint these words father we pray
[24:19] that you would anoint our ears Lord and
[24:21] I pray that Faith would pick up the
[24:22] words and take it and Seed into our
[24:24] hearts tonight father
[24:25] be with each one here tonight father we
[24:27] lord again we're just
[24:29] Lord we're striving father we're
[24:31] striving for something Lord we're
[24:33] pressing towards the mark father and
[24:35] tonight Lord we're we're here to press a
[24:37] little bit further Lord toward that Mark
[24:39] father we just lay aside those things of
[24:42] life we we came into these doors tonight
[24:44] Lord to hear from you father so we pray
[24:46] that you would speak to us you'd
[24:48] minister to our hearts Lord you'd move
[24:49] us out of the way father Lord and you'd
[24:52] come and anoint the service father we'll
[24:54] be careful to give you all the praise
[24:55] tonight Lord and we ask all these things
[24:57] in Jesus name amen I pray the Lord would
[25:00] add his Blessing to the reading
[25:06] thank you
[25:10] brother Branham comes down in this and
[25:12] the sermon countdown 1962 1964. he
[25:15] begins to describe to us the development
[25:16] of Transportation the achievements
[25:19] mankind made in science to move us
[25:21] further and further along in
[25:22] transportation he says paragraph 33 says
[25:24] now my text tonight is called the
[25:26] countdown now things all things in the
[25:28] natural are types of things in the
[25:30] spiritual we understand that see the
[25:32] natural only types the spiritual and as
[25:35] Believers we know that the natural
[25:36] things happening always type the
[25:39] spiritual things of our Lord Jesus he
[25:41] goes on to say in paragraph 52 but
[25:43] modern happenings is a forerunner of
[25:45] spiritual happenings now remember modern
[25:47] Runnings are forerunners of spiritual
[25:49] happenings the natural as the spiritual
[25:52] exactly each happenings accompany the
[25:55] other only improved over the other each
[25:57] thing that happens in the natural and
[25:59] the next thing that happens is an
[26:01] improvement when anything happens on
[26:02] Earth it is a warning to us that
[26:05] something is fixing to be happened from
[26:07] Heaven what does What man does on Earth
[26:10] by his achievement is something that God
[26:12] is fixing to do by his achievement to
[26:14] his church so when anything happens it's
[26:16] a warning to us that something is fixing
[26:19] to be from Heaven straight from a
[26:20] prophet he says so when we when we see
[26:22] God doing incredible achievements or
[26:24] when we see mankind doing incredible
[26:26] achievements in in science and on Earth
[26:29] we know God is fixing to do something
[26:32] Matthew 24 uh
[26:35] 24 says therefore be on alert for you do
[26:38] not know which
[26:39] day your lord is coming and just to set
[26:41] a little bit of a foundation tonight the
[26:43] prophet takes us through a journey of
[26:45] the ages to show the happenings of the
[26:47] Lord restoring uh restoring his family
[26:49] back to that Faith the fifth Church age
[26:51] messenger which was Martin Luther he
[26:53] shows was preaching justification the
[26:55] just shall live by faith and that age
[26:57] Martin Luther lived from 1483 to 1546
[27:00] and if you go back and you study the
[27:02] development of horse and Buggies there's
[27:04] history that it was actually a means of
[27:06] transporting goods all the way back into
[27:08] the ancient times but as a means of
[27:10] transporting vehicle to carry passengers
[27:13] didn't first appear until England in
[27:15] 1955 right after Martin Luther left the
[27:18] scene
[27:19] and just a few years after that
[27:21] messenger leaves the scene you see that
[27:23] natural achievement takes place in the
[27:25] form of horse and buggy moving further
[27:27] into the next stage was sanctification a
[27:29] man by the name of John Wesley brings a
[27:31] message that completely stood against
[27:32] the message of the day and that church
[27:34] age was the Philadelphian Church age the
[27:37] church age book page 331 brother random
[27:39] says now this is the sixth Church age in
[27:41] the eyes of God time is drawing to a
[27:43] close he will soon be coming back soon
[27:46] the cry will go forth as he comes and
[27:49] then he quotes that scripture in 20
[27:50] revelation 22 he says and he which is
[27:53] filthy let him be filthy still and he
[27:54] that is righteous let him be righteous
[27:56] still he that is Holy let him be holy
[27:58] still
[27:59] that righteousness that he's talking
[28:01] about which was in our opening text in
[28:03] Philippians 3 verse 9 is of God by faith
[28:07] not our own righteousness but his
[28:09] righteousness amen I know these things
[28:11] are familiar we're just laying a little
[28:12] bit of a foundation tonight 1962 brother
[28:15] Branham comes in uh the countdown he
[28:17] says now we look that when we come from
[28:19] the horse and buggy automobile airplane
[28:21] the church God has been able in
[28:24] spiritual line to achieve from
[28:26] justification through Luther
[28:28] sanctification through Wesley to the
[28:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost now see it's a
[28:33] type a shadow achievements what God has
[28:35] been able to do the natural achievement
[28:37] of man John Wesley lived in 1703 to 1791
[28:42] the first steam-powered engine came into
[28:44] production around 1672 but the first
[28:47] automobile that was capable of human
[28:49] Transportation was in 1769 right near
[28:52] the end of John Wesley's life and you
[28:55] see you see these things they they're
[28:56] typing the natural typing the spiritual
[28:58] each time the Lord gives a little bit
[29:00] more Revelation in the word the man gets
[29:02] a little bit more Revelation in the
[29:03] natural amen so there was even even when
[29:06] God does give a little bit more
[29:08] Revelation though there's always a
[29:09] maturing time that has to take place
[29:11] right along with that and the same thing
[29:12] happens in the natural when something is
[29:14] first invented and first created in
[29:16] first trademarked it takes a little bit
[29:18] of time for that thingy to come into
[29:19] production and takes a little bit of
[29:21] time for it to be perfected and used it
[29:23] took time for men to perfect the
[29:25] automobile
[29:26] you know when we see these things taking
[29:28] place on a grand scale you know that's
[29:30] the way God does things he waits till
[29:32] everything is lined up exactly according
[29:34] to what the way that he needs it and
[29:35] he's perfectly patient every time
[29:38] the same thing happens in our lives on a
[29:41] personal scale he calls us out of our
[29:42] sin you know we repent we accept Jesus
[29:45] Christ into our hearts the blood
[29:46] cleanses our sins and then we stand
[29:48] Justified but that's just the beginning
[29:50] then we move into our cleaning out the
[29:53] sanctification the cleansing amen the
[29:55] emptying out but then once we're empty
[29:57] we're not supposed to stay empty the
[29:59] Lord is just then ready to to fill you
[30:02] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost after
[30:04] you stand Justified after you've
[30:06] received that sanctification now you you
[30:08] now you're standing in the place where
[30:10] you can actually receive the baptism of
[30:12] the Holy Ghost
[30:15] in 1903 the Wright brothers embarked on
[30:17] their first successful attempt at flying
[30:20] their flight only lasted 12 seconds and
[30:23] the flight only went 180 feet but it was
[30:26] living proof that mankind was about to
[30:28] dive into unimaginable Heights 1906 just
[30:31] three short years later the Azusa Street
[30:33] Revival took place in Los Angeles
[30:34] California and there come Azusa brother
[30:37] random says this there come Azusa when
[30:38] they left the ground and hit then the
[30:40] air through the baptism of the Holy
[30:42] Ghost God took the church from an
[30:44] Earthbound Creed into a solo flight in
[30:47] the air just as the airplane come in the
[30:50] Holy Ghost come in right behind it see
[30:52] that's right justification the horse and
[30:54] buggy sanctification what was it what
[30:56] was it the automobile beginning to move
[30:58] along then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:00] you took off the ground got your feet
[31:02] off the air a got up in the air flying
[31:04] around in the heavenlies with the
[31:06] Heavenly gifts the speaking in tongues
[31:07] the Divine Healing them was still in the
[31:10] automobile and still riding in the horse
[31:12] and buggy they thought that that was the
[31:14] strangest thing that they had ever seen
[31:16] then people was having a fit but they
[31:19] got their feet off the ground
[31:21] God was able to bring to the church his
[31:24] achievement when he got a bunch of
[31:26] people standing still long enough that
[31:28] he could pour His Spirit into him what
[31:30] was it then and it wasn't just a few
[31:32] short years later that the first plane
[31:34] to ever carry passengers any amount of
[31:36] distance was invented and put into use
[31:38] then if you move a little bit further
[31:40] the world's first jet plane was
[31:42] established by a German engineer came by
[31:44] manned achievement around the 1930s you
[31:47] see it moving further and further in the
[31:49] spiritual brother Branham in 1933 the
[31:51] angel of the Lord sent a commission to
[31:52] him right there at the river just as
[31:54] John the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[31:56] first coming your message was sent to
[31:58] forerun my second coming oh my praise
[32:00] God for October 4th 1957 the Soviets
[32:03] launched the very first shuttle into
[32:04] space breaking into an entire New Era of
[32:07] travel April 1961 the first human to go
[32:10] out of the atmosphere and into space not
[32:12] long right after that the church Ages
[32:14] were preached not long after that the
[32:16] seals were preached amen people talking
[32:18] about the modern brother Branham says
[32:19] paragraph 70 in that same sermon they
[32:21] call that modern this is the modern
[32:23] according to the kingdom of God
[32:24] astronauts Glory the astronaut age sure
[32:27] Eagles God's prophets Rising on the
[32:30] scene how how thankful we are for that
[32:32] what is it spiritual manifestations of
[32:35] spiritual word becoming literally be
[32:38] fulfilled before us amen word of God
[32:41] manifested once was hard to understand
[32:43] now is made plain through the astronaut
[32:47] amen the position of the church that
[32:49] should be Plumbing the heavenlies not
[32:51] down here floating around through the
[32:52] clouds and buzzing like an airplane but
[32:54] something that's propelled by something
[32:56] something that sends it beyond anything
[32:58] that airplane could ever think of it's
[33:00] an astronaut amen that's the age we're
[33:03] living in friends spiritual astronauts
[33:05] now the astronaut can see the horse and
[33:07] the buggy or the automobile but the
[33:09] airplane things that the airplane
[33:11] couldn't even see because he's thousands
[33:13] of miles ahead of them he's so far ahead
[33:16] till they're 50 times the speed now you
[33:18] see why these people think they get
[33:19] crazy they can't understand it
[33:23] glory god say you see it thanks to God
[33:25] spiritual astronauts living so far above
[33:27] what even an airplane could think of he
[33:29] wants to take our thinking into New
[33:30] Heights and when you you know when you
[33:32] get into a space shuttle you are
[33:34] completely pressurized to the atmosphere
[33:36] of which you will enter as long as you
[33:38] stay in that vehicle and that vehicle
[33:39] that you're in stays pressurized and no
[33:41] outside elements hinder its path you see
[33:44] brother Branham when he comes and tells
[33:45] us this word that we're astronauts you
[33:47] know when a plane I have brother Matt
[33:48] say this I like to plagiarize other
[33:50] ministers brother Matt was saying this
[33:51] when a plane hits turbulence in the air
[33:54] the plane kind of shakes and it causes
[33:56] the people to get get nervous get get on
[33:58] board get nervous either flying they're
[34:00] flying in the clouds but then a little a
[34:02] little a little Shake happens and then
[34:04] they get nervous you see but when you
[34:06] when you're on a space shuttle you're
[34:08] moving so fast and so far above the
[34:10] turbulence that it doesn't have any
[34:12] effect on you anymore
[34:15] brother Adam says this in paragraph 108
[34:17] you see the progress of the church has
[34:19] followed the progress of time you know
[34:20] that and we've changed now from airplane
[34:22] to astronaut and there's got to be a
[34:25] change you see we've seen the three
[34:26] changes come in the progress of
[34:28] Transportation power always taking added
[34:31] power added power keep more and more and
[34:33] more why don't the airplane get up there
[34:35] he says it hasn't got the power to do it
[34:37] it isn't built for it it couldn't do it
[34:39] but the astronaut has the power the tube
[34:42] that he's in it has the power he's up
[34:44] there he goes up sends up by electronic
[34:46] by atoms which is far greater than
[34:48] gasoline or anything we're in another
[34:51] age he says
[34:54] what was happening there was man was
[34:56] having less and less control and the
[35:00] Machine was getting more and more
[35:02] powerful the horse and buggy they were
[35:04] in total control there was horses they
[35:06] were leading which way it went right the
[35:07] automobiles they took a little bit of
[35:09] gasoline a little bit of combustion a
[35:10] little bit more power you move into the
[35:12] airplane it moves miles above the
[35:14] automobile it would take you way further
[35:16] in less time but you see that's right
[35:19] there when there started to be a control
[35:20] tower you see when they started rising
[35:22] up higher in the clouds there started to
[35:24] have to be a control tower to to guide
[35:26] you where to go and and to tell you look
[35:28] you can't go that route because there's
[35:30] clouds in the way there's weather
[35:32] there's storms there's things that are
[35:33] going to get in your way and so when you
[35:35] get the Holy Ghost when you're baptized
[35:36] by the spirit of God there's things in
[35:38] your life that the control tower will
[35:40] tell you to avoid but God wants to take
[35:42] us higher than that he wants to take us
[35:44] where those things don't affect us
[35:45] anymore Hallelujah
[35:50] what was happening was something that
[35:52] was all together different the space
[35:54] shuttle opened up the door for so much
[35:56] more it wasn't they weren't controlling
[35:59] anymore their faith was solely in those
[36:02] instruments they had to rely on that
[36:05] control center to be their eyes and ears
[36:07] I thought this was so amazing scripture
[36:09] says that it'll be so that it'll through
[36:11] the narrow way brother random says you
[36:12] know in 1959 I quoted this in my in one
[36:15] of my Sunday schools but straight is the
[36:17] gate 1959 he says it'll be so few in
[36:19] that Rapture you know NASA's astronaut
[36:22] selection process had more than 12 000
[36:24] applicants their last selection and only
[36:27] 10 were selected that's not even one
[36:29] percent that is a fraction of a
[36:32] percentage oh he says in in in how can I
[36:35] overcome 1963 paragraph 66 he says oh my
[36:37] beloved friends don't let that door shut
[36:39] Jesus says As it was in that day so
[36:42] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[36:43] man thank you brother so shall it be in
[36:45] the coming of son of the man now there
[36:46] is somebody going to get caught outside
[36:48] this door now listen to this friends if
[36:50] attention here many of them might have
[36:52] good intentions and someday if such
[36:55] things will happen we'll go in with
[36:56] brother Noah because he's a fine fellow
[36:58] but you see it just caught a outside you
[37:02] see brother random sees as a prophet he
[37:04] sees the attitude of the people and he
[37:06] sees you know you know I I know that
[37:08] that I want to do right I know that I
[37:10] want to go to church I want I know that
[37:11] I want to live right I know that it's
[37:13] the truth but I just am not willing to
[37:15] completely give it all yet I I will one
[37:18] day I know I will one day but I'm not
[37:20] there yet and you see he says one day
[37:22] they'll be caught outside that door
[37:25] he really brings us down to earth some
[37:27] might have good intentions you believe
[37:28] the message you think it's a real nice
[37:30] thing you say Someday I'm gonna guilt my
[37:32] life right oh someday I'm going to go
[37:34] back to church someday I'm going to
[37:35] surrender my life to Christ but it's not
[37:37] for me now he says now think hard now
[37:40] this isn't me this is a prophet think
[37:42] hard now if you were laying around
[37:43] getting Dodie get in hurry because the
[37:46] door might close at any time
[37:49] amen he comes down to the next paragraph
[37:51] it's by one Spirit Romans 8 1 that we're
[37:53] all baptized into one body into the
[37:55] domain of that Kingdom one spiritual
[37:57] baptism no matter how good no matter how
[38:00] bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by
[38:02] Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only
[38:04] way you overcome It's all under that
[38:06] shed blood is Overcomers because you
[38:08] cannot overcome yourself it's he that
[38:10] overcome for you you are resting he said
[38:13] he says you know he's asking the
[38:15] question but brother Reno How will I
[38:17] know then brother random that I'm in
[38:18] there watch what kind of life that
[38:21] you're living just look around and see
[38:25] now because you can go and you can watch
[38:27] your life and you can live a pretty nice
[38:29] life but just look around and see if
[38:32] it's lived out of you automatically
[38:35] is this life being lived out of you
[38:45] have used out of you the way the prophet
[38:47] teaches us then something's wrong
[38:50] he says or you don't or or do you have
[38:53] to strain and pull see then you're doing
[38:55] it but don't try to do it did you ever
[38:59] try it he says yeah don't
[39:03] 1959 straight as they gate if I never
[39:05] preach another sermon in my life that is
[39:07] the truth there's just going to be a few
[39:09] people saved just remember that they're
[39:11] just a very few and and when I just kind
[39:13] of dramatized for a second you know you
[39:15] can read something like that and you can
[39:16] read straight As the gate narrow away is
[39:18] the way and you can get kind of
[39:19] discouraged in your heart because my
[39:21] goodness less than one percent but then
[39:23] he says you be one of them I'm not
[39:27] worried about anything else I'm just
[39:29] worried about being one of them I'm
[39:31] worried about my relationship with the
[39:33] Lord I'm worried I just want to be right
[39:35] with my Lord Jesus I just want to walk
[39:37] so closely with him I just want to live
[39:39] in such a Unity with him that there's
[39:42] nothing hindering me there's no clouds
[39:45] there's no turbulence there's no there's
[39:47] no weather that's hindering my past with
[39:49] the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:52] he says but you be lined up with God if
[39:55] your heart don't beat just with that
[39:57] Bible then there's something wrong
[40:00] there's something wrong no matter what
[40:02] your church says you can't go by you
[40:05] can't go in by that we believe in a
[40:07] message we believe God sent a prophet
[40:08] you cannot go in by what the church says
[40:11] you go in by what your revelation of
[40:13] what God in you is you go in by Holy
[40:17] Spirit baptism by one Spirit we're all
[40:19] baptized into God hallelujah this is the
[40:22] book that you'll be judged from the
[40:24] Bible stay right with it
[40:25] what simple directions from a prophet
[40:27] just a few only those that have that
[40:29] seal
[40:31] Hallelujah just settle it in your heart
[40:33] saints of God he goes on to say you know
[40:36] if it's not lived automatically just
[40:38] strained or do you have to strain and
[40:40] pull
[40:41] you know but glory to God Saints when
[40:44] you just know that you're resting in
[40:46] there then it's just a rest because
[40:47] you're just walking right where you know
[40:49] that God is Walking With You amen
[40:52] I want to take a little bit of a turn
[40:53] today
[40:54] when space shuttles are taken off
[40:56] there's actually a certain velocity that
[40:58] it takes a speed that the space shuttle
[41:01] has to attain before it can escape the
[41:03] Earth's enormous gravity oh my I was
[41:05] reading about this I just about have a
[41:07] jubilee this term is called escape
[41:09] velocity and this definition is straight
[41:12] from NASA's website the gravity of Earth
[41:15] is constantly trying to pull things down
[41:18] to the ground who else feels that way
[41:20] sometimes all the gravity of these
[41:22] things are trying to pull me down oh the
[41:25] Rockets are so heavy they need to be
[41:26] able to generate incredible speed NASA
[41:29] says to escape earthstrong's gravity and
[41:31] that speed is called escape velocity a
[41:35] rocket needs to be going about 25
[41:37] 000 miles per hour in order to escape
[41:40] Earth and get displace glory to God
[41:43] there's a pressure rising up in the
[41:45] world that outweighs anything ever in
[41:47] history the Bible prophesied about it if
[41:50] the gravity is this Earth the way of
[41:52] Satan trying to pull down pull you down
[41:54] and keep keep you down on the ground the
[41:56] principalities the powers the spiritual
[41:58] wickedness in high places those
[42:00] spiritual wickedness in high places oh
[42:02] they're they're working in the clouds
[42:04] they're in high places oh but the
[42:07] distractions are at an all-time high
[42:08] that the pressures are maybe almost
[42:10] unbearable whoever feels like that
[42:12] sometimes you just feel things are
[42:14] unbearable you feel like things are
[42:15] overwhelming you feel like there's just
[42:17] there's just
[42:18] nothing you can do
[42:21] but you see
[42:23] those spiritual astronauts God's elect
[42:25] the Bride of Jesus Christ they're
[42:27] getting ready to take their Heavenly
[42:29] fight Hallelujah and in order to escape
[42:31] the gravity the pulling down of weight
[42:33] it's going to take an escape velocity
[42:36] it's going to take what the prophet
[42:39] calls on astronaut faith
[42:42] and in order for any ship to really gain
[42:45] that amount of velocity right from this
[42:47] NASA website how much force are we going
[42:48] to need here we're measuring the force
[42:50] of thrust produced or as that is the
[42:52] force that pushes the rocket into space
[42:54] it has to produce a Thrust to escape the
[42:57] Earth's gravitational pull of 7.2
[43:00] million pounds of thrust to do that and
[43:04] as the fuel burns the shuttle actually
[43:06] gets lighter and less as it speeds up as
[43:11] it speeds up it reaches what they call
[43:12] supersonic speed and that's passing the
[43:15] speed of sound oh saints of God faith
[43:18] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[43:19] word of God and when you are going at a
[43:22] height and a depth in the word where
[43:25] you're hearing it and you're eating it
[43:26] and you're living it you you break past
[43:28] that barrier of sound Oh Glory to God as
[43:32] you begin to speed up you hear the word
[43:33] scraping away those last remnants of the
[43:36] world from you you start to reach this
[43:38] supersonic speed that the message of the
[43:40] hour is producing in our lives and then
[43:43] it takes more than it just than just
[43:45] going to church and having a
[43:47] relationship between this message has
[43:49] become more than you than just something
[43:51] in your life it's when it's crossed the
[43:53] threshold to being your life hallelujah
[43:56] it's when this message has become your
[43:59] life because it's God's word given to us
[44:02] to make a Rapture Hallelujah
[44:04] it should mean everything to us you see
[44:07] when you reach that speed it can create
[44:09] what they call a sonic boom which can
[44:12] produce a shock wave you see oftentimes
[44:16] those shock waves can cause damage to
[44:18] things around it you see the separation
[44:20] of the world the separation of Life can
[44:23] sometimes cause those shock waves in our
[44:25] life it severs relationship with friends
[44:27] maybe sometimes with family it breaks
[44:30] off those things that are holding you
[44:31] back the weights of sin the burdens the
[44:33] besetting things oh but in order for you
[44:35] to keep moving Higher and Higher and
[44:38] break through this atmosphere and into
[44:40] the next that supersonic speed has to be
[44:43] achieved
[44:44] glory to God as we speed up into our
[44:47] spiritual lives those hindrances will
[44:49] break away I promise you though friends
[44:51] you don't oh you don't want to keep
[44:54] those things anyway if it's holding you
[44:56] back from moving further with the lord
[44:58] it's not important anyway I promise you
[45:02] on the other side when you're reaching
[45:04] when you're shouting for Glory those
[45:05] things those besetting things will not
[45:08] be important to you at that time
[45:11] oh I'm moving a little further then it
[45:13] reaches this point called Max q and
[45:16] that's when you pass through an
[45:17] atmosphere that is extremely thick and
[45:20] the aerodynamic pressure is actually at
[45:23] its very highest
[45:25] oh my I believe that happens in
[45:27] Believers lives when the pressure feels
[45:29] seems like it's the very highest the
[45:31] aircraft now this is actually what
[45:33] happens in the space shuttle the
[45:35] aircraft has to actually slightly
[45:37] throttle back and it does that in order
[45:41] so that it knows that the vehicle can
[45:43] handle the loads as it breaks through
[45:45] that atmosphere oh you see the spiritual
[45:48] connection Saints sometimes we think
[45:50] when something happens in our life and a
[45:52] great trial comes our way our Humanity
[45:55] steps in and the devil throws mind
[45:56] battles your way oh my but that slow
[45:59] down that trial that you're going
[46:01] through God's using it to help you break
[46:04] through this thick atmosphere of life
[46:06] and take you into Resurrection with him
[46:10] oh my when tragedy comes in your heart
[46:12] breaks in half and you feel numb you
[46:15] feel like you can't comprehend anything
[46:17] he just Whispers in your sight Whispers
[46:19] in your heart he says my dear child I'm
[46:22] weeping with you
[46:23] I'm hurting with you but it won't be
[46:25] much longer
[46:27] oh you see my son he went through the
[46:29] greatest suffering any man could ever go
[46:32] through but without his death there
[46:34] could be no Resurrection oh and even
[46:37] though it's so hard now it won't measure
[46:39] up to the perfect place I have prepared
[46:42] for you my child
[46:44] and oh it just Whispers it says because
[46:46] I love you so much my word says that I
[46:48] will work it for your good so this thing
[46:51] that the enemy thinks in your life is
[46:53] breaking you down oh he thinks he's got
[46:56] you with oh it's just something to get
[46:58] you into that next atmosphere it's just
[47:00] something that's gonna take you further
[47:03] oh
[47:05] oh I feel that way sometimes
[47:07] oh saints of God I can just just
[47:09] dramatize this for a second oh can you
[47:12] just imagine sitting there all the
[47:14] Angels probably were just sitting there
[47:16] I just heard this quote this morning
[47:17] always as the angel sat there and
[47:20] watched his son being beat to death and
[47:23] he they watched it happen oh and I can
[47:26] just see Gabriel with a great sword
[47:28] right next to him and wormwood sitting
[47:30] right there and brother Brown dramatize
[47:32] it so perfectly in conferences and he
[47:34] just says oh then there comes there was
[47:36] a conference oh and hell of him oh he
[47:40] came down and he says oh he says my job
[47:43] oh he says he says oh are you willing
[47:47] are you willing to to bear this are you
[47:50] willing to bear this
[47:52] are you willing to go through this
[47:56] oh
[47:58] he says be it unto me
[48:01] oh he says not my will but thine will be
[48:04] done
[48:05] oh Saints
[48:07] oh it'll all make sense there
[48:10] just as it seems like you can't go on
[48:13] anymore as you as you begin to throttle
[48:15] back you begin to reach that point where
[48:18] where you know that you're just about
[48:20] ready to break through into that
[48:22] supersonic speed and you have to
[48:23] throttle back and those things are
[48:25] weighing you down you know and you have
[48:27] an assurance that those things are
[48:29] actually so that so that God can take
[48:32] you into that next phase
[48:36] oh saints of God and just just as you
[48:40] think it's slowing down it begins to
[48:42] throttle back up
[48:44] just as it reaches the point where it
[48:46] breaks from one atmosphere to the next
[48:50] as the fuel burns the shuttle gets
[48:52] lighter and less and it does something
[48:54] called jettison these rockets that help
[48:57] to get the space shuttle off the ground
[48:59] actually just detach it's such a cool
[49:02] process to watch you watch a space
[49:04] shuttle and you've got two rockets
[49:05] beside it and then you've got this
[49:07] enormous fuel tank on the back of it and
[49:09] as you begin to break through before you
[49:12] reach into that other atmosphere you
[49:14] actually have these two rockets that
[49:16] have expelled their fuel and they've
[49:18] done their job they've gotten you to
[49:19] where you need to go and then they expel
[49:22] and they drop off into the ocean and
[49:24] they just and they go pick them up as if
[49:26] it was not even ever attached to it in
[49:28] the first place
[49:30] then then once it gets a little bit
[49:32] further that main tank that carried most
[49:34] of the fuel finally detaches and it
[49:37] falls and it burns up in the atmosphere
[49:39] and what's incredible about the fuel
[49:41] tank is that it weighs nearly 20 times
[49:44] the space shuttle itself
[49:46] and it just falls back to Earth all
[49:49] those trials all those failures all
[49:50] those human flaws one day as you ascend
[49:53] up they're going to detach from you
[49:55] and never be with you anymore glory to
[49:59] God
[50:00] oh but you see until then God uses those
[50:04] things to perfect you he uses those
[50:06] things to train you Hallelujah
[50:08] and just like those astronauts have to
[50:11] trust that control tower and the
[50:13] autopilot you know I can just imagine
[50:15] when they get to that point of
[50:17] deceleration you know these are some of
[50:18] the most highly trained individuals in
[50:21] the world they go through thousands of
[50:24] hours of simulations and and they they
[50:26] do countless number of training in years
[50:29] and years of training before they ever
[50:31] even step foot into that space shuttle
[50:33] you see and then as you've been trained
[50:36] you you go up and you have to recognize
[50:38] because the the the the autopilot has
[50:42] control of that vehicle as it's
[50:44] ascending up but the but the astronaut
[50:46] can actually take control of it you see
[50:48] and I believe when they get up into that
[50:50] and I'm not sure I couldn't find
[50:52] anything on it but I believe probably
[50:53] when they get to that point of
[50:55] deceleration they're probably you know
[50:57] oh my this this is this is why am I
[51:00] slowing down I was supposed to be
[51:01] speeding up I need I need to speed up
[51:03] but you see they've been in so many
[51:04] simulations that their faith takes over
[51:07] and they trust that autopilot
[51:11] and when it gets to that point when we
[51:14] Face something in our lives that seems
[51:16] so trying
[51:17] We Trust in our autopilot to take over
[51:22] glory to God that's true Faith amen
[51:25] taking our hands off the wheel and
[51:27] allowing God to be the one in Supreme
[51:29] control of your life operating his life
[51:32] through you
[51:35] you know and that's reaching a point
[51:36] where his Divine Purpose outweighs our
[51:40] Earthly desires you see the works of God
[51:42] will come but the astronaut faith is
[51:45] something so simple you see we still
[51:47] have something called Free Will those
[51:50] astronauts can still take over that
[51:52] aircraft but they don't need to you see
[51:55] God is hiding himself in Simplicity God
[51:58] became Jesus humbled himself to this
[52:00] position where he had all the power in
[52:02] the entire world and yet at this time
[52:04] that he could have shattered the world
[52:06] he could have had his angels shatter
[52:08] everything he kept silent because there
[52:10] was a purpose in play for
[52:13] he did only the will of his father
[52:18] Colossians 1 verse 23 says if he
[52:20] continue in the faith grounded and
[52:22] settled and be not moved away from the
[52:23] hope of the Gospel which ye have heard
[52:25] and which was preached to every creature
[52:27] which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and
[52:29] made a minister who now rejoice in my
[52:31] sufferings for you and fill up that
[52:33] which is behind of the afflictions of
[52:35] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[52:38] which is the church whereof I am made a
[52:41] minister according to the dispensation
[52:42] of God which is given to me for you to
[52:45] fulfill the word of God even verse 26
[52:47] even the mystery which has been hid from
[52:50] the ages and from Generations but now is
[52:52] made manifest to his Saints to whom God
[52:55] would make known what is the riches of
[52:58] his glory
[52:59] of this mystery among the Gentiles which
[53:02] is Christ in you the hope of glory the
[53:05] mystery which was hid from the ages but
[53:07] now is made manifest Christ in you the
[53:10] hope of glory remember back to that
[53:12] quote the word of God man of the word of
[53:14] God manifested was once hard to
[53:16] understand now is made plain through
[53:19] that astronaut message brother Brennan
[53:21] brings amen It's Made Simple it's made
[53:23] plain God always makes it plain he hides
[53:26] himself in Simplicity always
[53:29] in Moon the Moon exploration the first
[53:31] flight to the moon the Apollo 11 1969
[53:34] happened right you know right after the
[53:36] end of brother branham's life NASA
[53:38] recently launched a project and that
[53:40] project is called Artemis project
[53:42] Artemis had its first launch in 2022
[53:45] when it successfully orbited the Earth
[53:47] and landed back in the Pacific Ocean the
[53:50] next scheduled takeoff for project
[53:52] Artemis I think it's a five-part series
[53:54] is in November 2024 and it will be what
[53:58] they call the furthest space exploration
[54:01] man has ever been on going further into
[54:05] space than ever achieved before in
[54:08] history
[54:09] you see it's typing the spiritual man's
[54:12] achievements always come close to when
[54:14] when God is achieving something brother
[54:16] random says this in uniting time in PSI
[54:17] 1963 you remember in the scripture what
[54:20] time is it Watchmen and the Watchmen
[54:22] come back and told him what hour it was
[54:24] see they kept time by the Stars Now
[54:26] isn't it strange that these stars were
[54:29] exactly in line for three men and nobody
[54:31] else saw it see just exactly in that
[54:34] line so now you can be it's so in line
[54:37] with the scripture see that when those
[54:39] stars become in unity United themselves
[54:42] together in this consolation three men
[54:44] also were United at the same time you
[54:47] can be so United with God in his word
[54:50] until these things become realities and
[54:53] you can see them and know that they are
[54:55] true see it's the sign of the time you
[54:58] might look over the top of it and say ah
[55:00] nonsense but it's the sign of the time
[55:03] amen going through a few quotes here
[55:05] this this evening if that's all right
[55:06] Amen brother random says it's a
[55:08] countdown 1962 paragraph 122 says oh I
[55:10] don't want Treasures of this Earth I
[55:12] have Treasures in Heaven thank God one
[55:14] day I stepped into that astronaut too
[55:16] but the body of Jesus Christ baptized in
[55:18] there by the Holy Ghost watching and
[55:20] waiting and listening at that countdown
[55:22] I see the Ages come by come by come by
[55:24] till the last age is counted off the
[55:26] next breath it's more than three minutes
[55:28] I mean less than three minutes science
[55:30] says it's three minutes for the earth to
[55:32] be bowed in time it's less than that the
[55:34] next breath of Jehovah is come out of it
[55:38] my people come up higher amen
[55:42] Psalms 86 11 says teach me thy way O
[55:45] Lord and I will walk in thy truth unite
[55:48] My Heart To Fear Thy Name
[55:50] there's this quote I read on on prayer
[55:53] and I read the other day it struck my
[55:55] heart it says you still may know you do
[55:57] not quite you still may know you still
[55:59] may say you do not quite see why a man
[56:02] who abides in Christ and in whom
[56:05] Christ's words abide should be allowed
[56:08] to ask whatever he wills and it shall be
[56:11] done unto him I answer you again it is
[56:14] so because it is in such a man as that
[56:17] there is a predominance of Grace which
[56:20] causes him to have a renewed will which
[56:22] is according to the will of God
[56:24] suppose a man of God is in prayer and he
[56:27] thinks that such is such a thing is
[56:28] desirable yet he remembers that he is
[56:31] nothing but a babe in the presence of
[56:34] his all-wise father
[56:36] and so he bows his will and asks as a
[56:39] favor to be taught what to will though
[56:42] God bids him ask what he Wills he
[56:44] shrinks and cries my Lord here is a
[56:47] request which I am not quite clear about
[56:49] as far as I can judge it is a desirable
[56:52] thing and I will it but Lord I am not
[56:54] fit to judge for myself therefore I pray
[56:57] thee give not as I will but as thou wilt
[57:01] oh my do you not see when we are in such
[57:04] a condition as this our real will is
[57:07] God's will
[57:09] deep down in our hearts we will only
[57:11] that which the Lord himself wills and
[57:13] what is this but to ask what will and it
[57:15] has done to us it becomes safe for God
[57:17] to say to the Sanctified Soul ask what
[57:19] that will and it shall be done unto thee
[57:21] he goes on to say
[57:23] uh the spiritual life is mastering him
[57:26] and so his aspirations Are Holy Heavenly
[57:29] god-like and will he and uh he has been
[57:34] made partaker of the divine nature and
[57:36] as a son is like a father so now in
[57:38] desire and will he is he is in line so
[57:42] close with God as the echo answers to
[57:44] the voice so does the renewed heart Echo
[57:48] the mind of the Lord our desires are
[57:51] reflected beams of the Divine will ye
[57:53] shall ask what ye will and it shall be
[57:55] done it's a beautiful representation of
[57:57] trusting God's will over our own will
[58:00] our will sometimes asks and expects a
[58:03] certain thing and then something
[58:04] contrary takes place but you see then I
[58:07] remember I'm just a babe in his presence
[58:09] glory to God and then what I and his
[58:11] will has a purpose that flies me above
[58:13] the clouds and into another world
[58:19] amen
[58:21] brother random says this some of the
[58:24] principles
[58:25] of Faith here there's a couple quotes I
[58:27] want to get to he says
[58:28] this quote so struck me the other day
[58:30] brother Brandon makes this statement
[58:31] from his opening text in Mark the 11th
[58:33] chapter the context from the scripture
[58:35] the scripture is Mark 11 22 I believe
[58:37] Jesus answering said unto them have
[58:38] faith in God verily I say unto you that
[58:41] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[58:42] be thou removed and be thou cast in the
[58:45] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[58:46] shall believe that those things which he
[58:48] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[58:50] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[58:53] you whatsoever things you desire you
[58:55] pray believe that you receive them and
[58:57] you shall have them when you stand
[58:58] praying forgive if you have ought
[59:02] against any that you that your father
[59:05] also which is in heaven May forgive your
[59:07] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[59:10] neither will your father which is in
[59:13] heaven forgive your trespasses this
[59:16] quote so struck my heart the other day
[59:18] brother random says this in perfect
[59:19] Faith he says now faith is based on
[59:23] forgiveness
[59:25] and then as we said this morning trying
[59:27] to get the church into a place to where
[59:29] they could really see Apostolic times
[59:32] moving Among Us that's what we all
[59:34] hunger for it's just laying right at the
[59:37] door we see it but we want to see more
[59:39] of it who wants to see more of it
[59:41] hallelujah it's saying on the door we
[59:42] want to see more of it we want it in
[59:44] such a flow that it'll be a help to us
[59:47] and it'll flow out to others that's what
[59:50] I want in my life I wanted to be a help
[59:51] to me so that it can flow out to others
[59:54] amen
[59:55] if you don't but it said but if you
[59:57] don't even follow those instructions
[59:59] from Jesus he says neither will your
[1:00:00] father forgive you in some in simple
[1:00:02] instructions you know just a definition
[1:00:04] I Googled on forgiveness in general it
[1:00:07] involves an intentional decision to let
[1:00:09] go of resentment and anger
[1:00:12] holding something towards somebody can
[1:00:14] actually grip you and hold a grip on you
[1:00:17] and that grip can become a hindrance in
[1:00:20] your life that keeps you from where you
[1:00:23] are called to be with God
[1:00:25] you know that forgiveness doesn't always
[1:00:27] have to involve another person either
[1:00:30] most cases it does but when it when it
[1:00:33] does and when it does it's not always
[1:00:35] easy to forgive it takes determination
[1:00:37] amen it takes you know most importantly
[1:00:40] it takes prayer and supplication and a
[1:00:42] willingness but true forgiveness also
[1:00:45] involves ourselves you know we as humans
[1:00:48] we make mistakes we make a lot of
[1:00:50] mistakes amen who else is with me who
[1:00:52] makes a lot of mistakes amen but the
[1:00:54] prophet said simple instructions faith
[1:00:57] is based on forgiveness and I and if we
[1:00:59] don't forgive others and if we can't
[1:01:01] forgive ourselves and let go of those
[1:01:04] things which are in the past in
[1:01:06] Philippians that have said that you know
[1:01:08] the Bible says that there is therefore
[1:01:10] now no condemnation to those who are in
[1:01:12] Christ Jesus
[1:01:13] and if you Fester unforgiveness towards
[1:01:16] a brother or a sister or if you have
[1:01:19] something condemning your heart brother
[1:01:21] Brenham says it and picks that up in in
[1:01:23] in perfect Faith he would tie in that
[1:01:25] scripture John 3 21 where it says uh if
[1:01:28] our hearts condemn us not then we have
[1:01:30] confidence then the if our hearts
[1:01:33] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:01:34] towards God so if our hearts condemn us
[1:01:37] then we can't have faith
[1:01:39] but if our hearts don't condemn us then
[1:01:42] we can have faith and then we can have
[1:01:44] confidence towards God but as long as
[1:01:46] you're doing things that's wrong you
[1:01:48] can't have confidence towards God you
[1:01:50] see you'll automatically know that
[1:01:51] you're wrong you'll automatically put
[1:01:53] yourself back there as a sinner by
[1:01:55] knowing you're wrong but when your heart
[1:01:56] don't condemn you and you know you are a
[1:01:58] Believer there's nothing between you and
[1:02:02] God you can ask what you will and it
[1:02:05] will be given because it's the word
[1:02:07] that's giving you to ask what you will
[1:02:09] Hallelujah
[1:02:11] I say we got a bunch of Bible Believers
[1:02:13] tonight amen those are some principles
[1:02:15] of Faith basic things that God wants to
[1:02:19] take us from here into those clouds and
[1:02:21] take us further into our Christian walk
[1:02:23] with him
[1:02:24] but in order to walk the way God wants
[1:02:27] to walk with us Philippians 3 brother
[1:02:29] brother and I count not myself to had
[1:02:32] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:02:33] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:02:35] and reaching those things which are
[1:02:37] before pressing towards the mark who who
[1:02:41] is pressing towards that Mark tonight
[1:02:42] with me we're pressing towards something
[1:02:45] but you can't even go into that first
[1:02:47] scripture that second verse if you if
[1:02:49] you move past that first one if you
[1:02:51] don't forget about those things you
[1:02:53] don't lay it before the Lord now that
[1:02:55] doesn't that doesn't escape girl
[1:02:56] repentance you have to repent in your
[1:02:58] heart brother random showed that later
[1:03:00] on in that perfect Faith uh sermon you
[1:03:02] know uh he was talking with someone and
[1:03:04] they came to the prayer line and he was
[1:03:06] saying I'm just paraphrasing but it's in
[1:03:08] that sermon and he was talking to him
[1:03:10] and he said you know he said uh you you
[1:03:11] have such and such but you know but you
[1:03:13] need to make this thing right first
[1:03:16] you you have such and such that you're
[1:03:18] praying for but you need to go make such
[1:03:19] and such right with so and so you need
[1:03:21] to you need to go and apologize you may
[1:03:23] write with your wife make it right with
[1:03:24] your husband we're familiar with that so
[1:03:26] you can never bypass the repentant side
[1:03:28] of things but once you've repented once
[1:03:31] you're once you once it's under covered
[1:03:33] under the blood then you can move past
[1:03:35] that thing you can you can lay it aside
[1:03:37] you can forget it you can forget all
[1:03:39] about it and then you can press towards
[1:03:41] that Mark
[1:03:49] brother Benham says in nineteen uh
[1:03:53] 63 how can I overcome
[1:03:55] the devil wants you to mind him
[1:03:58] the first he made his attack upon to use
[1:04:01] his great power which he knowed he was
[1:04:03] the word he knowed his position you
[1:04:05] believe he did I the son of man he
[1:04:07] knowed his position and Satan come and
[1:04:09] wanted to use his own power on himself
[1:04:11] to feed him want to defeat himself you
[1:04:13] know in his greatest Temptations
[1:04:15] he a man gets hungry he'll do almost
[1:04:17] anything he says he'll still Rob big
[1:04:19] borrow anything see he had the appetite
[1:04:21] and Satan used his first great major
[1:04:24] assault upon him to take his power that
[1:04:26] he had been given to overcome with and
[1:04:28] use it on himself
[1:04:31] he didn't use it on himself no he used
[1:04:34] it on others that's right he used it on
[1:04:36] others not himself it wasn't for him
[1:04:37] though he could have done it he
[1:04:39] certainly could have done it but you see
[1:04:41] how the devil gets the devil wants you
[1:04:43] to mind him
[1:04:46] he minded only what the father said to
[1:04:48] do that's right
[1:04:51] he goes on to say the thought runs
[1:04:53] deeper than what it's wrote see it's
[1:04:55] inspiration oh I'm sorry I missed him he
[1:04:57] said he said why Satan said it's written
[1:04:59] he'd give charge of the angels He said
[1:05:00] yeah but it's also written see there you
[1:05:02] are see he knew who he was Satan didn't
[1:05:04] the thought runs deeper than what it's
[1:05:06] wrote see it's inspiration the colonel
[1:05:08] is on the inside of it you see what it
[1:05:10] really is the thought runs deeper the
[1:05:13] devil wants us to mind him and get
[1:05:15] caught up in those things get caught up
[1:05:17] in the trials get caught up in the
[1:05:18] things that maybe we don't understand
[1:05:20] get caught up in what some what somebody
[1:05:22] did to you get caught up in what we did
[1:05:24] to somebody else amen get caught up in
[1:05:27] my past faults living with guilt when
[1:05:29] the Lord's already done forgotten about
[1:05:31] it don't let don't even mind that stupid
[1:05:34] devil when he comes around and he says
[1:05:36] you remember this what you did in your
[1:05:38] past you remember that you remember
[1:05:39] you're the biggest sinner I know he
[1:05:41] comes in my mind and says that quite a
[1:05:42] bit because I know I'm the biggest
[1:05:43] sinner I know but then I can just search
[1:05:45] in the scripture and say well there's no
[1:05:47] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[1:05:48] Jesus and the only way I can stand and
[1:05:50] have the kind of faith that God God
[1:05:51] wants me to have if I have a heart that
[1:05:53] doesn't condemn me and there's no
[1:05:55] condemnation so praise the Lord devil
[1:05:57] I'm not going to mind what you're going
[1:05:58] to say hallelujah we're not going to
[1:05:59] mind what the devil says tonight we're
[1:06:01] going to have faith in God we're going
[1:06:03] to move past those things Hallelujah
[1:06:08] let Christ be in you let the word work
[1:06:11] through you and mine what the father
[1:06:13] said do
[1:06:15] he says this 1963 calling Jesus on this
[1:06:18] he says what a secure feeling knowing
[1:06:20] and watching the Holy Spirit change your
[1:06:23] nature from a vile person amen then we
[1:06:25] know we've passed from Death unto life
[1:06:27] to see the Holy Spirit living in us his
[1:06:31] life that's what the holy spirit is does
[1:06:33] he with astronaut Faith he lives his
[1:06:36] life through you
[1:06:39] Paul said the one the life that I once
[1:06:42] lived I live no more oh not me but the
[1:06:44] Christ that lives in me
[1:06:50] brother Benham keeps going on and he
[1:06:51] says then he had passed from Death unto
[1:06:53] life and Christ was alive in him safely
[1:06:55] secured Christ was the one guiding the
[1:06:57] ship Paul just had to sit there and Obey
[1:07:01] him
[1:07:03] notice God will make our bodies oh so
[1:07:06] obey him that he said in John the sixth
[1:07:08] chapter he thinks he that eats my flesh
[1:07:10] and drinks my blood has everlasting life
[1:07:11] and I will raise him up at the last body
[1:07:13] think of it our bodies obey when we have
[1:07:16] no more control over it and it turns
[1:07:18] back to a spoonful of dust God will
[1:07:20] speak to that body and it'll raise up
[1:07:22] again in the likeness of the resurrected
[1:07:24] Jesus Christ so what are you worrying
[1:07:26] about tonight it's in the hands of God
[1:07:29] let go for he will raise it up in the
[1:07:31] last day he promised to do it that's
[1:07:34] thus saith the Lord it's written in his
[1:07:36] word amen he's calling come up a little
[1:07:40] higher and two his perfect word amen
[1:07:44] and we as we as we move into our
[1:07:46] position in Christ you know as he
[1:07:48] identifies himself in us as we re as we
[1:07:51] reach our escape velocity one day
[1:07:55] we'll find ourselves walking so closely
[1:07:58] with what the father's will is amen
[1:08:00] where we find ours we're not living in
[1:08:02] the automobile age anymore where we let
[1:08:04] differences hinder our walk or you know
[1:08:06] we let we let the the speed limits hold
[1:08:09] us back from as fast as we need to go
[1:08:11] where we don't fellowship with with one
[1:08:13] another because of differences or past
[1:08:15] hurts he's calling higher than even
[1:08:17] airplanes when when the turbulence and
[1:08:19] the cares of life where we let carnal
[1:08:21] living and we let worldly entertainments
[1:08:24] and we let the unnecessary distractions
[1:08:26] of the weather you know affect our lives
[1:08:29] the you know and he doesn't you know
[1:08:31] even in even in
[1:08:33] the airplane mentality of things the
[1:08:36] Mind battles that we have can get us off
[1:08:39] course
[1:08:41] it's when we let those failures get to
[1:08:43] us astronaut faith is when you're so
[1:08:45] hidden Christ that there is therefore
[1:08:47] now no condemnation to those who are in
[1:08:49] Christ Jesus and not just saying that
[1:08:51] repeating a verse but believing it the
[1:08:54] ups and the Downs the bad days they
[1:08:56] don't affect your destination your
[1:08:58] destination is set I've just got to
[1:09:00] reach my escape velocity
[1:09:02] the failures shouldn't affect us anymore
[1:09:05] the Mind battles are proof to me that
[1:09:07] I'm on my way up and the devil wants me
[1:09:09] to mind him
[1:09:11] but I'm already pressurized amen
[1:09:13] hallelujah nothing's gonna stop us to
[1:09:16] God be the glory
[1:09:19] amen we bring into captivity every
[1:09:22] thought Under The Obedience of the word
[1:09:23] of God we enter into the Fellowship of
[1:09:25] the suffering recognize that those
[1:09:27] things are happenings because as we get
[1:09:29] higher and higher we get into that
[1:09:32] pressurized State and it's actually
[1:09:33] shedding off that extra cargo that we
[1:09:36] don't need to take with us that jettison
[1:09:38] State when we reach a certain point all
[1:09:40] of our Earthly baggage will fall into
[1:09:43] this atmosphere and will our Ascent will
[1:09:45] continue
[1:09:46] my title for tonight was was breaking
[1:09:48] through the atmosphere it's not it's not
[1:09:51] just trying to get so deep with things
[1:09:53] that we run ourselves in circles trying
[1:09:55] to understand it's so it's a simple
[1:09:57] hidden life in Christ you hear the word
[1:10:00] you recognize it to be the word then you
[1:10:03] act upon the word by saying Amen to it
[1:10:06] by what pastor's been preaching on not
[1:10:08] just saying amen with our words but
[1:10:10] living it in our actions living it
[1:10:12] through our lives letting the holy ghost
[1:10:14] live it through you
[1:10:17] doing only the will of the father
[1:10:19] earnestly contending for that faith that
[1:10:22] was once delivered to the Saints the
[1:10:24] faith when when they were beaten and
[1:10:26] mocked for the cause of Christ they
[1:10:27] walked or I read that acts the other day
[1:10:29] they walked away rejoicing that they
[1:10:31] could partake in the sufferings of
[1:10:34] Christ you know when Stephen operated
[1:10:37] his faith by forgiving them as they were
[1:10:40] killing him and he went even further he
[1:10:43] interceded on their behalf to the Lord
[1:10:46] you know flying higher isn't always you
[1:10:49] know
[1:10:50] something's far-reaching it's actually
[1:10:52] stepping lower than you've ever been
[1:10:54] before
[1:10:55] those astronauts are some of the most
[1:10:57] highly trained in the world they go
[1:10:59] through some of the most training yet
[1:11:00] when they get into that vehicle and the
[1:11:02] autopilot takes over and and they're
[1:11:05] going in there Ascent in outer space
[1:11:06] they have to trust that autopilot amen
[1:11:10] just a few just a few more minutes here
[1:11:13] tonight Saints
[1:11:14] amen praise the Lord God is good praise
[1:11:17] God while I was studying this I got a
[1:11:19] little curious about that word Artemis
[1:11:21] you know that Space Project NASA is
[1:11:23] working on we were talking about come to
[1:11:25] find out that dates all the way back
[1:11:27] that word dates all the way back to the
[1:11:29] early church the city of Ephesus Artemis
[1:11:32] was an idol that people worshiped in
[1:11:35] Ephesus you know when Paul the Apostle
[1:11:37] Paul goes and visits the Ephesian Church
[1:11:39] age and he begins preaching Jesus acts
[1:11:41] the 19th Chapter there was actually a
[1:11:43] specific Idol that they were that they
[1:11:44] would worship and I think Demetrius was
[1:11:46] his name and he actually made money by
[1:11:48] by selling this Idol and then you know
[1:11:51] he got upset with Paul because Paul said
[1:11:53] you know we don't worship idols made by
[1:11:54] human hands We Worship the Lord Jesus
[1:11:56] Christ and it caused his business to
[1:11:58] uproar and then he got all upset about
[1:12:00] it that Idol's name was Diana which is
[1:12:03] actually the Latin name for Artemis
[1:12:06] it became so popular in the city of
[1:12:08] Ephesus that they built an entire Temple
[1:12:11] dedicated to worshiping this Idol and
[1:12:14] interestingly enough that temple in art
[1:12:16] of Artemis actually was so large in fact
[1:12:18] that it made its way to the Seven
[1:12:20] Wonders of the Ancient World at one
[1:12:23] point in history
[1:12:24] I don't think it's a coincidence that
[1:12:27] today in the last Church age one of
[1:12:29] man's greatest scientific achievements
[1:12:31] is named after something that was
[1:12:34] hindering God's First Church age message
[1:12:36] in the first message at the the book of
[1:12:39] Ephesus NASA has no idea that they're
[1:12:42] operating in the hands of God the war
[1:12:44] the world has no idea what's going on
[1:12:47] around us you know you see it I have
[1:12:48] people coming to work all the time you
[1:12:50] know that you know they say all these
[1:12:51] things about you know the politics and
[1:12:54] they say well you know we need to get
[1:12:55] this person into office we need to get
[1:12:57] do this and you know no we don't we
[1:12:59] don't know it's it's the pressures are
[1:13:01] rising we don't we don't need to do
[1:13:02] anything except get get hidden in Christ
[1:13:05] and get ready for our Heavenly Ascent
[1:13:07] Hallelujah
[1:13:09] she recognizes the bride recognizes what
[1:13:12] what's taking place
[1:13:15] you know brother Brandon we had quoted
[1:13:17] back earlier in countdown brother
[1:13:18] Brandon talks about at modern science at
[1:13:20] the time coming together and discussing
[1:13:22] that Doomsday Clock what he's referring
[1:13:24] to is actually what they call the
[1:13:25] bulletin of the atomic scientist and
[1:13:27] it's something that they do to this day
[1:13:29] and they had an article that they met
[1:13:31] together I think the beginning of this
[1:13:33] year and it says unprecedented Danger
[1:13:36] Russia Ukraine war pushes ionic Doomsday
[1:13:39] Clock closest to midnight ever it's been
[1:13:41] in history and that was the latest
[1:13:43] report in history all based on it's this
[1:13:46] this scientific achievement it's all
[1:13:48] based on on science advancements and
[1:13:49] nuclear advancements in 1962 it was
[1:13:52] three minutes to midnight the latest
[1:13:54] Council determined that it was 90
[1:13:56] Seconds To Midnight glory to God it's a
[1:13:58] scary thing for the world when you look
[1:14:00] at something like that but for God's
[1:14:02] people it's the countdown to go home
[1:14:06] glory to God pressures are rising oh but
[1:14:09] it just means our Ascent is starting to
[1:14:11] happen amen we're enjoying it today
[1:14:13] brother Branham says this he says we're
[1:14:15] enjoying it today sure we're in a great
[1:14:17] age paragraph 114 of the countdown 1962
[1:14:20] a great time an astronaut age God give
[1:14:23] us astronauts give us men and women
[1:14:25] daring men daring women what did John
[1:14:28] Glenn and them have to do when they
[1:14:30] stepped into that tube they were
[1:14:31] Pioneers God wants Pioneers to this word
[1:14:36] astronauts who will take the things that
[1:14:38] we have got and not be satisfied with it
[1:14:41] but we're going on God is making
[1:14:43] achievements and I just love how the
[1:14:45] prophet says this one of these mornings
[1:14:46] God's achievement of his astronauts
[1:14:49] that's climbed into Jesus Christ been
[1:14:51] born in there by the Holy Ghost filled
[1:14:53] with his power one of these mornings the
[1:14:55] whole universe will be screaming and
[1:14:57] wailing and gnashing of teeth see when
[1:14:59] they've missed it when the Great Eagle
[1:15:01] powered by the Holy Ghost in fire begins
[1:15:03] to spread her wings the astronauts will
[1:15:06] take off into the sky to go meet the
[1:15:08] bridegroom when the bride takes off and
[1:15:10] the astronaut power of God Almighty who
[1:15:13] sent Jesus Christ to the Earth in the
[1:15:14] form of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:16] glory to God has brought the church
[1:15:18] through these achievements he says get
[1:15:21] in my brother my sister get pressurized
[1:15:23] the pressure won't hurt you when you get
[1:15:25] in the inside and get pressure get in
[1:15:27] Christ and won't care what the world
[1:15:31] says they can never hit you anyway
[1:15:32] you're safe you're tucked in
[1:15:35] you know liftoff isn't going to be the
[1:15:37] kind of show that that NASA makes it to
[1:15:39] be on TV as we go up it'll be a thief in
[1:15:42] the night
[1:15:43] come to collect his little bride the
[1:15:45] little bride that's done everything you
[1:15:46] need they need to do to prepare for him
[1:15:48] amen I just want to be so hid in Christ
[1:15:52] Jesus tonight that he can manifest his
[1:15:54] life through me in these things
[1:15:57] amen let's just stand to our feet this
[1:15:59] evening
[1:16:05] you know as man is coming to a place
[1:16:08] where achievements are at an all-time
[1:16:10] high especially in nuclear warfare and
[1:16:13] space exploration you know the countdown
[1:16:15] is on
[1:16:21] and with all these things happening
[1:16:22] around the world the world coming to an
[1:16:24] end I'm finding my rest in where I am
[1:16:28] I've climbed into Jesus Christ born
[1:16:30] again by the spirit of God I just love
[1:16:32] how the prophet says that Born Again by
[1:16:34] the spirit of God filled his power don't
[1:16:36] mind the devil friends that's the devil
[1:16:38] that beeping that's the devil don't mind
[1:16:41] him home to see my Jesus amen you know
[1:16:44] one of the amazing things about the
[1:16:46] countdown process is that it has to be
[1:16:49] absolutely perfect
[1:16:51] when they go and they are getting ready
[1:16:53] to launch the space shuttle into space
[1:16:56] everything has to be in line I I watched
[1:16:59] this video the other day and I just
[1:17:01] thought it was so incredible of the
[1:17:03] countdown process and you hear every
[1:17:06] every person in their position and they
[1:17:09] say this position ready this position
[1:17:11] ready this position ready all the way
[1:17:14] down to the smallest detail the weather
[1:17:16] the engines the computer the flight the
[1:17:18] crew every single aspect has to be in
[1:17:22] place before they can initiate the final
[1:17:26] countdown
[1:17:28] that is what is happening right now the
[1:17:30] countdown to our Heavenly fight and now
[1:17:32] there's just a few things that haven't
[1:17:34] come into alignment perfectly yet
