TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we invite you to this into our presence father that you promised that where two or three were gathered in your name that you would be there and we're gathered in your name father so we expect you to be here we ask these things in your name the lord jesus christ amen now um we are y'all can be seated um we had some oh come on now my machine is acting up all right so uh y'all bear with us bear with me this morning i got scheduled to do the sound booth and the sunday school today so we're gonna not gonna have a screen for now um but uh the um so i expect y'all to have bibles um you know at church who'd have thought um so i'm gonna uh pull my my thing up here so we'll turn to james chapter 1 and verse 17. and uh y'all give me a give me a nod when you're when you got it everybody everybody good all right it says in every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning now for a title or my sunday school just to give you some idea of where i'm going um the title that i took today is the light of the world um and here we so in here in james it shows that uh says james or i'm sorry that god is the father of lights which is a interesting way of saying that um there are a couple things that this sort of implies is number one it implies that god is light obviously because if god is having is the father of lights then must be light um also implies that his children are lights right all of all of you are lights um and uh it's so i have just a couple bullet points i kind of want to go through as i read this scripture these are just the thoughts that kind of came to me so it's the light is originating with god but expressed through his children and so we we can take matthew chapter 5 and verse 14 you're the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and give it and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven and so we see that the the purpose right that the purpose of god's children is to be a light under the world that there would be a that the world would be covered in darkness and that the the children of god would light that world up by shining by being an example by living presenting light to the to the world because the purpose of this is because that all life starts with light okay um in genesis chapter one right in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth right he created stars that's light and his also said let there be light nothing on earth like the first day of creation of creating life on earth was let there be light right all light all life starts with light but we can take this in a spiritual aspect as well look at the burning bush right or paul getting knocked out of his saddle what happened to great light shown right in order for that for god to be revealed in that spiritual life to activate in in someone's heart that supernatural light of the of god's word has to flash across their their life and uh there's several i have a couple different quotes here where brother branham talks about this um says in uh we would see jesus says um all the father has given me and i'm just kind of skipping through these i'm not reading the whole quote just because for time's sake but um just some highlights it says all the father has given me will come and when the light flashes across that predestinated seed something takes place like that poor little adulterous woman that we spoke of tonight she was sick and tired of the way they were doing as far as we know she belonged nowhere but she had been foreseen by god and as soon as she seen that light flash even in face of the priests of that day who didn't know what it was like the blind man when he received his sight okay in sermon why it says and now god you put our names on the lamb's book of life before the foundation the world father god i pray tonight if there's any of that seed laying here in this church tonight i'm no judge you are i'm only responsible for preaching your word but if there's any of that seed here tonight lord i believe that light flashes over it it's got to come to life and then in jehovah jireh this is just god's seed materializing that's all his words coming down now when the light of god flashes across that quickly that seed recognizes it because it's born of god it's abraham's seed forenode by god that's why the light flashes is to catch that seed um can you play that video so the other thing that so you know i'd heard these quotes a lot um [Music] talk you know brother i'm talking about the light flashing across the seed and then i saw this is it is it playing it's kind of slow there's no audio or anything um there we go so this is a an egg cell being fertilized and right now they're using some different like light spectrum imaging so you can't really see it but in a minute it's going to show a you can read the the text here that when that egg is fertilized there is a flash of light that actually takes place and it'll show in a second so watch that's that's a grid of egg cells being fertilized automatically or is that's the moment of fertilization um the so here we see literally a seed the seed of human life a light literally must flash across it in order for for it to become alive um and the the the important one i don't know if they mentioned it but only a mature egg will will flash if an unmature egg that cannot is not prepared to bring forth life the light won't flash it won't happen it requires that like that flash of light is integral the chemical reaction that produces that flash of light is integral to that egg becoming a life and so you know when you see a type like this runs all the way through nature and the bible right this is this isn't something that you just kind of uh you know take for granted this is this is something that to me it's it really shows that this is a core pillar of the way god really built everything that everything from the plan of salvation to you know every living creature i mean even in animals this was the video here um you can take that down um but that video that was of humans but they'd originally figured this out decades ago with cows and it just takes a very long time to actually prove it happens in other animals too but point is all pretty much all life on earth this takes place all life takes place with a flash of light um and so likewise when uh you know like like i said with paul you know any child of god um i know i hadn't put this in my notes but i know when i got saved i was talking brother jason and when he said the right words that struck my life that just cut through all of my doubt and and really quicken that word when he said that i remember at the time it so stunned me because when he looked at me i saw a physical light flash in his eyes right like it's now maybe that might have happened for everybody but my point is the flash of light is associated so often times with that that seed becoming life now um i want to change gears a little bit here and talk about um uh this um let's see here all right so uh perseverance this is from perseverance it says every time you look at the moon it isn't the moon shining it's the sun shining on the moon if i just say moon what makes you shine it's just not me shining it's something shining on me i'm supposed to keep the light going in the absence of the sun and the church is a type of the moon we're supposed to reflect the light while the absence of the son of god because we are sons and daughters of god the lesser light and as long as we can see that moon see that moon reflects the same kind of light as the sun does oh it isn't the people it's god in the people so if if if if you want to spread eternal life to the people of the world the only way to do that is to be the light that flashes across their life right that's the only way to do it that's why god wants people to be the light of the world to to not be the candle under a bushel to be the the moon reflect in the darkness right when the sun is on the earth the world is light you don't you know it you don't need a flashlight or any kind of light because the the sunlight's everything you know when christ is on the earth you know that it wasn't as necessary for the people of god to be that light because the actual light was on the earth but within the absence of the sun that lea that's we have to be that light right the moon doesn't again the moon is only is reflecting the same light that is there in the daytime right just as a lesser version of it and what so often happens is you know there's the cycle of the moon right it's not always a full moon it's very bright in the full moon in fact um you know a lot of times when you've got a nice bright full moon it's almost like it's daytime out you know nice clear sky but a lot of times that that moon comes in cycles it doesn't always isn't always all bright and shiny sometimes it's obscured right well why is it why does it get dark well what happens is the world comes between the moon and the sun that's what happens and so if you're not shining to the world is only ever going to see the light of the sun in this dark day so long as the moon us can keep the world out from between us and god right the moment that the the world comes between you and and god is when you're stuck you stop shining right they're never gonna see that you right you there has to be that that clear channel um now uh let me come back up to up to here right okay so right so um i i want to pick up another side of this and that is likewise with you know the relationship between us and you know the just the general christians and god um is so often typed as the same as between a man and a woman right and um and if the type so a lot of the types are going to carry over so likewise if um actually let me let me come down and grab this because this is important before i go into that oh dear well that was a mistake i accidentally highlighted the entire paragraph and now i can't find what i'm looking for um okay well we'll just skip that for now um the the there's a particular quote um where uh brother branham says that um talking about prophets and reflectors um and uh he's talking about how every prophet is a perfect reflector and he just reflects the word of god he's not the prophet isn't presenting his own light he's only presenting the light that god shines on him and then reflecting that to the people so that people can see it and then at the end of that um at the end of that uh oh wait no i think i just found it um uh oh maybe i didn't oh well um anyways at the end of it it says uh he says and and he makes a statement he says and you are reflectors talking to the people that's an odd transition right he's talking about how prophets are these reflectors and then he looks at the people and says you're reflectors too right though though that that relationship between god and the people is one of the people ultimately conform to the light that they are that is being shined on them um i have here um uh where it talks about john um uh john the baptist had to eat the book in order to reflect the word that was in it right um and the ultimately what there's this sort of parallel where the the the the reflector is obtains the properties of the light source right but the light source is only going to be as bright as that reflector allows it to be um but i i wanted to pick up here where it's uh that parallel between man and woman christ and the bride and how of christ in the the parallel between the sun and the moon uh is christ and the bride likewise you can kind of transition that over into into marriages because um you know i'll read in ephesians chapter five and verse 22 why submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife and his christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now we unfortunately a lot of sisters get beat over the head with that scripture and it's ought to be that way um because he immediately sta uh transitions to husbands love your wives even as christ who loved the church and gave himself for it um i don't think any man has a position to beat his wife over the head with submit yourself if he is not willing to go die for her right like this isn't and and more importantly and i i would just change this a lot of men would have like because we're kind of wired this way like oh yeah i'll totally die for you but how many are willing to give their life there's there's a really big difference between giving your life giving your life doesn't always mean just going and dying right that's almost the easy thing to do right the hard thing is is is the grind is the day-to-day of dealing with issues and dying is over quick right you know giving your life for someone um it takes the rest of your life right like that's that takes 70 years you know this isn't this is this is um you know and uh and so just reading down it says so men love their wives even as their own bodies he that loveth his wife love loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord uh as the lord the church and so if the moon is a type of a woman and the sun is the type of the man and the moon only really reflects the light of the sun this is where we get quotes um that's like this if i can find it [Music] where brother branham makes a statement um uh it hears from choosing a bride and says again the kind of of a woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman and reflects his character and when he ties himself what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he marries i go to a man's office and he says he is a christian pen-ups all around on the walls and old boogie woogie music going on i don't care what he says i don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world what say if he would marry a chorus girl or what if he would marry a sex queen or just a pretty modern ricketta it reflects it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he took her to raise his children by and whatever she is that's the way she will raise those children so it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he is thinking of the future could you imagine a christian doing a thing like that no sir i could not a true christian will not look for such beauty queens and chorus girls and sex queens he'll look for christian character and um and uh this is from questions and answers on genesis um it says now i think that would uh get the man and woman now a woman is let me get this right good now so you can see it woman is subject to her husband and the bible says that a man should rule over his wife but um and i'm going to skip says um uh he says about the man he says you are going to have to answer for your wife but your wife is never going to have to answer for you you are the head of the woman and god is the head of man therefore he said let the man cut his hair because of christ and let the woman have her hair for it if she cuts it cuts her hair she dishonors her husband see that's what i mean by what the scripture says so the moon if the light you know if the woman is the type of the moon she's only ever going to reflect what's in that man's life in his heart you know this is so many times you'll see some you know if sister is struggling with something you know there's a there's a sort of a knee-jerk reaction a lot of times you see some sister come to church she's struggling with something the reaction's like oh that sister what's wrong with her she needs this that and the other no what's wrong with her husband right why oh you know that sister she's got come to church covered in makeup and you know her face and neck are two different colors and you can like everybody in the whole church could see it okay well what what happened to that poor sister what sort of what sort of of husband mistreated her and made her feel so unpretty that she has to go put some makeup on her face and and and to try to catch his attention because every other woman is right you know if if the wife is a reflection of the husband the you know if you see again you see a sister struggling with something i guarantee you what's actually going on is the is the man in her life is is not living up to his his calling not living up to the to the standard of what god has put in his called him to be and as a result you know we talk about the head being over the body well you know if when when a crime is committed you don't blame the body you know the bible talks about oh someone was murdered well their blood will be on the murderer's head right you know the body the hand might hold the knife that did the stabbing but the head is the what gets cut off right that's the that's the you know the head is where the consciousness that's where the where the responsibility lies what the body becomes is what the head has been feeding on right the head has the vision has all four of the five senses are in the head right um it's also where the eating happens right the body becomes subject you know what the what the mouth feeds on is what the body manifests right and so you have husbands again all to all this time anytime you have wives who are struggling with things i guarantee you it's the husband not living up to his potential and feeding on the wrong things not feeding on the word because if he was wives will like it just naturally happens that way like if it's all in accordance to god's word if the if the household is being run in the way it should be um the head ship is where the leadership is and if the leadership is is off course then he's going to lead everyone down into the ditch and so i want to that's why you know even so so much more for for for the men it's it's our duty to be the light right it's our duty to be the vision to to to shine that path you you know what what we as men feed on what we what we do with our lives what you know staying in the word you know studying the word is not just for the preachers um every christian has a duty to sharpen your sword right every christian has it has a duty to maintain your weapons you're a soldier in god's army you don't neglect your sword um or you will die like that's just how it works and um and if you if you if you don't well you know you're going to have hardship you're going to have struggles your family isn't going to work the way it's supposed to it's not going to work in the in the smoothness that um that that god would have for your life um and i just want to start to wrap up and kind of put a a bookend on this um this whole little thought kind of came because i saw a news article about an ancient artifact ancient chinese artifact that some archaeologists found it was all covered in dust and dirt and grime oddly enough they didn't find it in china they found it in a warehouse in chicago that it had originated in china and it was a mirror and there's the the museum in chicago um and they have a huge warehouse full of artifacts they said they had like a hundred thousand different ancient chinese artifacts and they have a whole section just on bronze mirrors um just thousands of them laying around well they're going through their archive and curating it and figuring out what they want to put on display and things like that and um by pure happenstance one of the curators noticed that there was a particular mirror that was very special looks identical to everything else the only thing that makes it special is the reflection that it produces okay now it's a special kind of mirror they used to make them back in the day not so much you could still buy them now but they're more of a novelty but back in the day they were kind of like a really rare thing and they were they're called a magic mirror and it looks just like a regular mirror it's a bronze disc they polish super smooth and to create a reflection but a magic mirror when you get it in sunlight so if you ever take like a mirror and say if like i took the light and i could angle just right you put a spot on the ceiling i could project a light spot if you take one of these magic mirrors and you it has to be sunlight no man-made light is bright enough to do this but the way that mirror is designed as long as the surface is clean there's no dust it's not grimy it's not covered in in carnal dirt you get it in the light of the sun right not some man-made light because man-made light won't do it you get it in the light of the sun that projection will be an image that's very been very carefully engraved in the surface of that reflector right that there was something when that thing was made when when god when god made a christian when god made the reflector there was a hidden image engraved and this particular one that they found in chicago by the way these are very rare um the chinese right the china only has like nine of them and they're considered national treasures every single one of them so the fact that they found one in chicago was kind of crazy but when this one they found in chicago the thing that it projected was the buddha right it was an image of the buddha their deity and so within people and it just so struck me like praise the lord we're reflectors with an image of deity inscribed in us that the world can't see it looks everybody is a reflector ever even the peop you know every every human reflects the things that you that you uh that you're around you know the uh in proverbs you know talks about as as face anthros answer his face in a pool of water so does the heart of man to man the people that are around you are you reflect those spirits of the people around you and everyone's a reflector and so there's lots of mirrors there's lots of mirrors but there's only some that have that image of deity hidden inside of them that it once they get in the light of the sun they'll reflect the image of deity right and so but the key here is that everybody has to make sure that you're in that light of the sun and that you're clean and not covered in dirt you know that your life stays pure and that you stay in connection with that with that sun and uh that's uh that's it for today we'll stand and have a word of prayer father we thank you for this little word that you've given us father asked you would and allow it to speak to the people and help them through the through their through their coming weeks and days and months that it would help somebody father and that they would be able to shine that light unto the people around them that that some some lost seed out there that's longing for you would have that light strike across that seat and bring it to life father that some someone would would take these words and maybe it would encourage them to just to not be a lazy light keeper and keep their their mirrors and reflectors polished that the the word not of any what light that we would have but that the light that you pre shine forth would reflect off of us and and encourage somebody else father we ask these things in your holy name of the lord jesus christ amen do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you
