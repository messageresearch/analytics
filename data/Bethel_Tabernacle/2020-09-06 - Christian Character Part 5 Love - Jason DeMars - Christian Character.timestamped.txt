[3:32] you will start with prayer father we
[3:35] just come to you now lord and we're so
[3:37] thankful

[3:48] earth are named

[3:53] what a privilege that is greatest
[3:55] privilege we have in our life

[4:23] fill us with you may more of you be
[4:25] manifested in our lives
[4:27] we commit ourselves to you in jesus name
[4:29] amen
[4:31] all right we're going to continue on our
[4:33] topic of
[4:34] christian character this is part 5
[4:38] and i'm going to probably spend the next
[4:41] few
[4:42] times we i i'm doing sunday school
[4:45] talking about love
[4:48] in the new testament there's four
[4:51] different
[4:52] kinds of love
[4:55] in the greek the first one
[4:58] is storge which speaks of family love
[5:03] then there's phileo which speaks of
[5:05] brotherly love or really friendship
[5:07] type of love then there's eros which is
[5:10] love between a couple
[5:13] and then there's agape which i would say
[5:16] is the love of god or unconditional love
[5:21] so uh in particular
[5:24] probably the next few times we'll be
[5:26] looking at love but also be looking
[5:28] at our love for one another
[5:31] as brothers and sisters in christ in the
[5:33] terms of friendship
[5:35] and studying friendship through the
[5:38] scripture
[5:38] but this time we'll be looking and
[5:40] focusing more on love
[5:43] just a comment before we go forward
[5:45] often we look at filio love
[5:47] and we describe it in regards to agape
[5:50] and we think of philia love as something
[5:53] um
[5:54] not necessarily negative but negative in
[5:57] regards to agape but
[5:58] it's not really a negative thing in the
[6:02] right
[6:02] context all of these loves are
[6:06] the kinds of loves that come that are
[6:08] blessings from god
[6:10] the song of solomon speaks about
[6:13] eros love
[6:16] the the bible is full of scriptures
[6:18] about the love of
[6:20] parents to children children to parents
[6:22] grandparents etc
[6:25] phileo brotherly love it's an important
[6:29] important kind of love but as christians
[6:32] agape
[6:33] love should be permeating everything
[6:36] that we do you know the world can love
[6:39] the way that they love but as christians
[6:42] our love
[6:43] our brotherly love our storge love our
[6:45] ear us love to our
[6:47] spouse should be infused with
[6:51] agape so with that said
[6:55] love is a word that is truly
[7:00] in the realm of being totally perverted
[7:04] in our day and age and especially
[7:06] english we so simplify
[7:08] the term love i love this steak i love
[7:12] my wife
[7:13] i love my friend i love my church i love
[7:17] this
[7:17] store i love these clothes
[7:20] and it's all the same word that we're
[7:23] using but the meaning
[7:24] is completely different and especially
[7:26] today
[7:28] um love
[7:31] is just a feeling you know
[7:34] the the you know in one time in in the
[7:37] history of the world
[7:38] when they talked about a marriage and
[7:39] they talked about love
[7:41] it wasn't in the realm of something you
[7:43] fall into i always
[7:45] get a kick out of you fall in love
[7:49] as though it's like it's a sickness that
[7:52] you
[7:53] catch and then well you can also get
[7:57] delivered of it you can fall out of love
[8:00] well that's not
[8:02] godly love that's what the world looks
[8:05] as love
[8:06] irreconcilable differences we couldn't
[8:08] just couldn't love each other anymore
[8:11] to a christian they don't know that
[8:13] doesn't even
[8:14] compute that kind of love
[8:19] the love that a christian has in his
[8:21] heart is
[8:23] as the scripture says shed abroad by the
[8:25] holy ghost it's romans 5
[8:27] 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because
[8:30] the love of god
[8:31] is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[8:34] ghost which is given
[8:35] unto us first of all god
[8:39] literally this means god is pouring out
[8:41] he's
[8:42] gushing another word another way it's
[8:46] translated is to run
[8:47] greedily it's like there's this
[8:50] great spilling out that is just
[8:54] covers us and is growing and growing and
[8:56] grow and it's still
[8:57] spilling out it's onward and and upward
[9:01] and growing
[9:02] in that sense to where it's in
[9:05] us and we experience god's love we feel
[9:08] god's love
[9:10] we feel transformed by that love and
[9:12] then because of that
[9:14] love goes out to others that's the
[9:17] source and basis of our love
[9:19] our love isn't based on well this person
[9:22] is nice
[9:23] i like i like this one but this one
[9:25] annoys me
[9:27] no the love that we have as christians
[9:29] is irregardless of any of those things
[9:32] we we know that we experience that we
[9:34] feel those things
[9:36] and yet we don't limit ourselves by
[9:39] those things we we say you know what
[9:43] god's love went deeper for me
[9:46] my love will go deeper for others
[9:50] first thessalonians 3 12 says in the
[9:53] lord
[9:54] make you to increase and abound
[9:57] in love one toward another and toward
[10:01] all men even as we do toward
[10:04] you i love that verse it's it's so
[10:08] important to understand
[10:09] he's saying the lord make you abound and
[10:12] increase
[10:13] so in other words we have to grow
[10:16] as our christian faith matures
[10:20] so does our love for others mature or
[10:23] it's it's supposed to if you truly have
[10:26] the sanctifying work of the spirit of
[10:27] god
[10:28] living in your heart then that's what's
[10:31] going to happen you're going to
[10:32] increase and abound in love
[10:36] agape love towards one another
[10:40] um before i go on if you if you google
[10:44] love what definition do you find
[10:48] you find an intense feeling
[10:51] of deep affection so what is the source
[10:56] of love according to modern
[10:59] view the modern viewpoint it's a feeling
[11:02] and guess what
[11:03] everybody knows feelings change
[11:06] feelings are strong sometimes feelings
[11:08] are weak sometimes
[11:09] you get frustrated sometimes you get
[11:11] angry other times
[11:13] you feel romantic towards your wife
[11:17] sometimes you feel angry sometimes
[11:19] these are feelings they come and they go
[11:23] that's not what love is that is
[11:26] absolutely not what love is
[11:29] love is so much deeper love is so much
[11:32] stronger
[11:34] um you know you look at
[11:37] even even if you look at webster's
[11:39] dictionary
[11:40] the old old version that noah webster
[11:44] put together in the early
[11:46] eighteen hundreds and he talks about
[11:48] love in a different way
[11:50] he says love is an affection of the mind
[11:53] excited by beauty
[11:54] and worth of any kind or the by the
[11:57] qualities of an object which
[11:59] communicate pleasure sensual or
[12:02] intellectual
[12:03] it is opposed to hatred love between the
[12:05] sexes is a compound affection consisting
[12:07] of esteem benevolence and animal desire
[12:10] love is excited by pleasing qualities of
[12:13] any kindness by kindness benevolence
[12:15] charity and by qualities which render
[12:17] social intercourse
[12:19] agreeable in the latter case love is
[12:21] ardent friendship
[12:23] or a strong attachment springing from
[12:25] goodwill and esteem and the pleasure
[12:26] derived
[12:27] from the company civilities and kindness
[12:30] of others it's much deeper
[12:33] and much better definition and yet i
[12:36] don't believe it's
[12:37] fully in line with scripture
[12:40] scripture goes above and be way above
[12:43] and way
[12:44] beyond what even webster is talking
[12:47] about
[12:49] matthew 5 43
[12:52] through 48
[12:56] jesus speaking in the sermon on the
[12:57] mount
[12:59] you have heard that has been said you
[13:01] shall love your neighbor
[13:03] and hate your enemy but i say unto you
[13:07] love your enemies bless them
[13:10] that curse you do good to them
[13:13] that hate you and pray for them which
[13:16] despitefully use you
[13:18] and persecute you this is a love that
[13:22] goes
[13:22] far beyond emotion
[13:26] you don't love someone
[13:30] that hates you based on an emotion
[13:33] your emotions immediately when someone
[13:36] hates you
[13:37] are hurt pain and
[13:40] probably wanting to lash out
[13:43] wanting revenge that's human
[13:47] the fallen human nature but christ is
[13:50] saying that's not
[13:51] what the spirit of god does in you
[13:54] that's not the natural
[13:56] reaction of a spirit-filled new creation
[13:59] in jesus christ
[14:01] your reaction our reaction should not be
[14:06] hatred our reaction should be love
[14:10] bless that someone's literally cursing
[14:12] you blaspheming your name throwing you
[14:15] out mate
[14:16] pushing you away making fun of you the
[14:18] response should be love
[14:19] what is love again we hear through the
[14:23] modern
[14:24] 21st century idea we should love
[14:27] well i should have an intense emotion
[14:29] towards this person
[14:32] it's not what it's saying it's saying
[14:35] what does it say right do good to them
[14:38] that hate you
[14:40] and pray for them which despitefully use
[14:43] you
[14:43] and persecute you it's not saying you're
[14:45] going to have an intense feeling of
[14:48] some kind of strange love towards the
[14:50] person
[14:51] though that might follow you you might
[14:54] be angry you might be upset
[14:56] but you know as a believer with the
[14:58] spirit of god inside of you
[14:59] my responses should be i'm going to do
[15:02] good to them
[15:03] i'm going to bless them you know you you
[15:06] hear people coming against you
[15:08] coming against what you stand for
[15:11] the response is i want to defend what
[15:13] i'm doing
[15:15] jesus doesn't say to do that he says
[15:18] bless them
[15:19] pray for them yes you you know we defend
[15:24] by the word but i think it goes way
[15:25] beyond
[15:27] just winning an argument it goes into
[15:31] truly loving that person the way christ
[15:34] loved us how did christ love us while we
[15:37] were yet sinners
[15:38] while we were enemies with god christ
[15:41] died for us he did
[15:42] what was necessary it wasn't merely that
[15:45] he felt
[15:45] what was necessary that's not what this
[15:47] is talking about what
[15:49] he did what was god's will for him to do
[15:53] for us
[15:55] verse 45 that you may be
[16:00] so you want to be sons and daughters of
[16:02] god
[16:05] then if you want to be children of your
[16:08] father which is in heaven
[16:09] then you have to do good to them they
[16:12] hate you and pray for those that
[16:13] despitefully use you and persecute you
[16:16] in other words if the spirit of god is
[16:17] living inside of you
[16:19] it's going to create this response and
[16:22] convict you and bring you to that place
[16:24] that this is the kind of love
[16:26] that you have for people
[16:30] for he makes his son to rise on the evil
[16:34] and on the good and sends rain on the
[16:37] just
[16:39] and the unjust god is good to
[16:42] people that curse him every day
[16:45] that don't even believe that he exists
[16:47] and are actively
[16:49] spending their entire life fighting
[16:52] against him and god continues here's
[16:56] food here's food for you here's
[16:57] here's here's things to meet your needs
[17:01] here's blessings and all the while
[17:04] they're cursing him and he's that's okay
[17:08] my goodness is trying to lead you to
[17:10] repentance
[17:14] for if you love them verse 46 if you
[17:16] love them which love you
[17:19] what reward have you do not even the tax
[17:22] collectors the same
[17:25] love people who are unlovable
[17:30] love people that despise you
[17:33] what reward do you have if you just love
[17:35] the people that are nice to you
[17:37] it's really easy for me
[17:40] to love people that are nice to me it's
[17:43] easy for all of us
[17:45] but being a christian it has to i mean
[17:48] the words that jesus are saying here
[17:51] are basically saying come on come on
[17:55] everybody you're just living a natural
[17:56] life
[17:58] there's something i'm calling you some
[18:01] greater things higher things bigger
[18:03] things
[18:05] i want you to be like me and we just go
[18:08] on and say okay well
[18:09] so-and-so's nice i like being around
[18:11] them i'll bless them i'll take care of
[18:13] them i'll help them
[18:14] but so-and-so annoys me and frustrates
[18:16] me forget them
[18:18] well what thank have you
[18:21] you're doing the same thing that the
[18:23] whole world does
[18:26] 47 and if you salute the word salute
[18:29] there
[18:30] doesn't just merely speak of a of a
[18:33] greeting hi
[18:35] it's to welcome them is to say hi
[18:38] and come in that in that sense it's
[18:41] talking about
[18:42] like welcoming strangers saying i'm
[18:45] gonna
[18:45] i'm gonna help you i'm gonna take care
[18:47] of you i'm gonna do
[18:49] do to you what you have need of being
[18:51] done i'm gonna take care of you
[18:53] if you salute your brethren welcome your
[18:56] brethren only
[18:58] what do you more than others do not even
[19:01] the public and so be therefore perfect
[19:04] even as your father which is in heaven
[19:08] is perfect my what a calling
[19:13] so love
[19:17] jesus is talking about love and he's
[19:18] describing and giving us clues what
[19:21] what this love is in these verses
[19:24] not an emotion look what love is love
[19:27] your enemies
[19:29] bless them that persecute you're you're
[19:31] praying for a blessing
[19:33] on the people that are coming against
[19:35] you
[19:36] do good to them that hate you provide
[19:38] for their needs if they have a need if
[19:40] they need help with something take care
[19:43] of them
[19:45] pray for them which despitefully use you
[19:47] make a portion of your time
[19:50] in prayer every day praying for people
[19:53] that are
[19:54] rude and mean and awful to you that you
[19:57] should dedicate yourself to that on a
[19:58] daily basis
[20:01] pray for them which despitefully use you
[20:03] and persecute you
[20:04] then what does he go on
[20:08] if you love those who love you what
[20:10] thank so it's love it's loving people
[20:12] that
[20:12] don't like you it's welcoming
[20:15] more than just those who are friendly to
[20:18] you
[20:19] it's welcoming the people that dislike
[20:22] you that are rude that talk behind your
[20:24] back
[20:25] that do things that frustrate you that's
[20:28] love
[20:30] okay i'm going to read a quote from the
[20:31] sermon influence
[20:33] november 14th 1963. and brother branham
[20:37] says this and so we find the people
[20:38] doesn't realize the presence of god
[20:42] you know they ought to be like david the
[20:44] man was after god's own heart he said
[20:46] the lord is always before me wherever he
[20:48] goes he remembers god is always before
[20:50] him
[20:51] he's on my right hand and i'll not be
[20:53] moved because god is on his right
[20:54] on his right hand reverence
[20:58] we ought to honor one another respect
[21:01] one another
[21:02] as brother sister and love one another
[21:04] with
[21:05] undying love you say well i just can't
[21:08] well just stay here a little longer and
[21:10] then you will like people too
[21:12] you will like people too you'll love
[21:14] those who doesn't love you
[21:17] that's really a good sign of
[21:18] christianity oh my isn't that beautiful
[21:21] that's a sign of christianity in you
[21:25] don't think about other people this is
[21:27] about me and you
[21:29] that's a good sign of christianity i'm
[21:31] going to add to brother branham in me
[21:34] when you can i love from your
[21:38] heart that's important it's not fake
[21:42] it's not a put on it's genuine from your
[21:45] heart
[21:46] love those who does not love you love
[21:50] the unlovable
[21:53] jesus said if you just do favors for
[21:55] those who do favors for you well
[21:57] the publicans do the same thing but see
[22:00] you must be kind to those who are unkind
[22:02] to you
[22:03] do good for those who would do evil to
[22:05] you always remember that keep that
[22:07] before you
[22:08] that god is watching you remember god
[22:10] was good to you when you were evil to
[22:12] him
[22:12] while you were yet sinners christ died
[22:15] for you
[22:17] very beautiful and profound challenging
[22:20] words
[22:22] from the sermon living dying buried
[22:24] rising coming in 19
[22:26] march 29 1959
[22:30] brother branham says this he showed what
[22:32] he did to the whole human race the way
[22:34] god
[22:34] represented himself in jesus christ he
[22:37] has expressed
[22:38] he expressed his opinion to the human
[22:40] race to forgive
[22:41] and to love those that were unlovable
[22:44] and i wonder on this easter morning how
[22:46] short we fall of that
[22:47] we could love those who love us but he
[22:49] loved those who did not love him
[22:52] he was the greatest the first
[22:54] representation of love that ever hit the
[22:56] earth
[22:57] and was despised of those who lived on
[22:59] the earth to whom he loved
[23:01] no man could ever love like him and no
[23:03] man was ever hated like him
[23:05] they hated him and despised him and
[23:06] rejected him
[23:08] but it did not stop his love the last
[23:11] when he was hanging on the cross
[23:14] after that life that he had lived had
[23:16] been done nothing but good things
[23:17] forgiving the guilty healing the sick
[23:20] just things that were good when his last
[23:22] breath on the cross with the vulgar
[23:23] mocking spit of them who stood by
[23:26] hanging from his sacred face he cried
[23:28] with a heart full of love father forgive
[23:30] them
[23:31] for they do not know what they do he
[23:34] could understand
[23:35] being god he understands that's why he
[23:38] could love us when we're unlovable
[23:40] because he's god and he understands
[23:42] living he loved me never lived a like
[23:45] like it because it was wrapped
[23:47] in his love and he calls us to the same
[23:49] love
[23:51] the same heart of compassion
[23:56] true love welcomes those who are
[23:58] despised and rejected
[24:00] true love does good to people who speak
[24:02] evil you of you and try to
[24:04] ruin you you know
[24:08] love is not merely an emotion love
[24:12] is also not merely corrective you'll
[24:15] hear people say that and focus on that
[24:16] well love is corrective that's the end
[24:18] of the story it's not the end of the
[24:19] story
[24:21] love is many other things read first
[24:23] corinthians 13 again
[24:25] if you think love is only corrective go
[24:27] so far beyond that
[24:30] love is corrective love does bring
[24:34] emotions
[24:36] but that's not its basis love's basis
[24:40] is that he loved me
[24:43] he came to me he put that love
[24:47] in me by the holy ghost luke 6
[24:50] 35 but love your enemies and do good and
[24:53] lend
[24:54] hoping for nothing again again the
[24:57] attitude of the heart the approach
[24:59] to people the approach to situations
[25:03] give to other people don't expect
[25:04] anything in return that should be our
[25:06] attitude
[25:07] i'm giving of myself i'm giving of my
[25:09] time i'm
[25:10] giving of my friendship and my
[25:13] expectation
[25:15] i don't expect anything in return
[25:18] you say how can we do that we need
[25:20] friends that
[25:21] give back we do we do
[25:25] but the fact is as christians we
[25:26] shouldn't be watching and waiting for
[25:28] that to happen
[25:29] we should take the yoke upon ourselves
[25:31] and the responsibility on ourselves and
[25:33] say i'm going to do good
[25:35] regardless of what people do to me even
[25:37] if i'm rejected and despised
[25:41] a hoping for nothing again and your
[25:42] reward shall be great
[25:44] and you shall be children of the highest
[25:46] for he is kind unto the unthankful
[25:49] and to the evil john 30
[25:52] john 13 verse 34 and 35
[25:57] a new commandment i give unto you that
[25:59] you love one another
[26:01] as i have loved you that you love
[26:04] also one another
[26:08] that verse is so
[26:11] all-encompassing we read that about
[26:13] marriage
[26:15] husbands love your wives as christ loved
[26:17] the church but here christ is telling
[26:19] his disciples and that's all of us love
[26:22] one another
[26:24] as i have loved you how much did he love
[26:26] you
[26:29] you know greater love has no man than
[26:30] this that he would lay down his life for
[26:32] his friends
[26:34] how much did christ love you what did he
[26:38] expect in return
[26:40] he was mocked he was rejected
[26:45] he was willing to do that we need to be
[26:47] willing to do that for each other
[26:50] we need to love one another just the way
[26:52] he did
[26:53] to us verse 35
[26:56] by this shall all men know
[27:00] that you are my disciples that you'll
[27:03] know
[27:03] all the doctrine
[27:08] no it doesn't say that not not
[27:11] saying that doctrine isn't important
[27:14] doctrine is important if you don't have
[27:15] the correct
[27:16] teaching of the bible you're not even
[27:18] really knowing who god
[27:20] is but that's not the point saying if
[27:22] you're my disciple
[27:24] there will be an outward manifestation
[27:26] that people could
[27:27] everyone can see and that is that you
[27:31] have love one to another you'll you'll
[27:34] be
[27:34] your life will be characterized by love
[27:36] for each other
[27:37] and love going out to those who hate you
[27:40] and despise you
[27:41] and people will say that's a christian
[27:46] those people are different in the token
[27:49] message brother branham says oh take
[27:51] take this solemnly we should love one
[27:54] another
[27:54] oh my we should be so in love don't
[27:57] never speak evil against one another if
[27:59] somebody makes a mistake
[28:01] pray for him right quick we're together
[28:04] in this
[28:04] with god we're brothers and sisters
[28:08] amen romans 12
[28:11] 9 and 10. i'm going to read it from the
[28:14] english standard version
[28:17] let love be genuine
[28:21] abhor what is evil hold fast
[28:24] to what is good love one another with
[28:27] brotherly
[28:29] affection that whole sentence is just
[28:31] one word
[28:32] love one another with brotherly
[28:34] affections it's fillo storgos
[28:36] is the word so it's filio and store
[28:39] ghost it's like
[28:40] it's saying there's a family and
[28:43] brotherly love that you should have for
[28:45] each other
[28:46] so it goes beyond merely uh
[28:49] what we love each other as friends it's
[28:51] like we're family
[28:53] like brother branham said we're together
[28:55] in this
[28:56] and we and we are we have to be so love
[28:59] one another with brotherly affection
[29:01] outdo one another in showing
[29:04] honor isn't that interesting it's almost
[29:07] like hey there's a competition going on
[29:09] here
[29:10] and the competition is this show honor
[29:15] uh honor each other win the competition
[29:19] and honor
[29:19] one another isn't that beautiful
