Brother, just pray over the offering also as you come. Amen. God bless you, buddy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Man, so we're going to couple of re reminders about church [music] order. Um had some discussions. So, um, like the cell phones, uh, unless you're part of, uh, the working [music] functions of the church sound booth or something, you should have your cell phones turned off. Now, before I became a deacon, I'm just going [music] to relax and talk. Um, I never brought my phone into the church to begin with, just because I had no need of it and I didn't want any [music] distractions. Um, so if you're texting somebody or if you're doing [music] something on eBay while you're in church, you're going to grieve the Holy Spirit, right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, [music] another thing we've all been taught, Brother Brandham said, that chewing gum in the sanctuary grieves the angel of the Lord. Um, [music] so if I was you, I would not come into the church chewing gum. Okay? whether you might hinder it for yourself or you may hinder it [music] for somebody else. [crying] Um, and we all get absent- minded. I'm not, you [music] know, um, if your heart is in the right place, you know, when you come in and I say something, I'm not I'm just I'm actually for your [music] good and for the good of everybody. So, uh, chewing gum is not allowed in the sanctuary. Okay. Um, now we have a nursery back there and we have a lot of lovely little babies and [music] we want to um, Brother Brandon was pretty clear on his church doctrine and church order. You know, if your baby's getting fussy and stuff like that, I'm not just going to say it tonight. I'm going to say it also on Wednesday. [music] Um, that's what the nursery is for. And the nursery and babies. And there may be instances where [music] grandma has to help or something, but toddlers and stuff like that don't need [music] to be going there playing. And church order needs to be maintained in the nursery also. It's not a place where okay, so the kids can go play. You have to mind your kids while they're in there, too. Um, another thing [music] is sometimes when people get out in front like it's 10 minutes to church time and stuff and they want to gather at the front door out in front of the sanctuary, out in front of the church. If you're talking loud and stuff, it comes right inside the church. You got people in here that are reading their Bible, praying. We're trying to make it a place to where the Holy Spirit will be comfortable. So, if you want to visit, don't visit by the front door of the [music] church. You can visit over there, over there. If it's 10 minutes, still church time, you should be in here anyhow. [music] Brother Brandham said a half an hour, but we're not we're not getting legal with it, but it's [music] we want to make this a place where the angel of the Lord and God is comfortable to [music] come. We want to rise higher. Okay? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get things get common with us. We talk a little bit. You know how brother Brandham said, you know, you know, you shouldn't be playing around or [music] fiddling around in church. You want to say God bless you. That's fine. But you sit down, read your Bible or pray. [music] That was what the prophet of the age talked about the church [music] before service. Um I love you. I didn't I heard a few amens and that's good. And I hope you all say an amen from your heart. Um we do want to make it a place where God is very pleased to come. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your grace this evening, Lord. We love you. We worship you and Father, we just come together. Lord, we come that you would come and be pleased with us. May our worship be in spirit and in truth this evening. Father, do not hold our iniquities against us. You said, "Blessed is the man to whom you [music] would not count iniquity, Father." And Lord, your bride comes in that category. We pray you forgive us for our shortcomings. And Lord, we lift you up this evening. We are expecting great things, a [music] wonderful time of fellowship in your word, of feeding that you would feed us and give us strength. [music] Father, Lord, we love you and worship you. As we collect the ties and offers, I pray that you bless the cheerful [music] giver. Lord, I don't want to forget the sick and the needy, those that are streaming that couldn't be here. Lord, I pray that you would bless them. Father, in Jesus [music] Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] How many come ready to have church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord another. Amen. [music] Amen. I'm not hearing. [applause] Amen. Amen. Amen. [singing and music] Amen. Just put me right here for a minute. Testing. Testing.

Do you sing the third one? &gt;&gt; No, we don't. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll just sing that one. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There's a day [music and singing] just out in front of us. I know surely come. [music] Oh, that [singing] eastern sky will open wide, revealing [music and singing] God's dear son. And I know from here to heaven is but the twinkling [music and singing] of an eye. In the midst of all his [singing] glory [music] comes the sweetest cry. Welcome [singing] home. I knew you'd [music] come. Welcome [music and singing] home. You're here for good. Look [music] around. Was it worth the wait? [music] Welcome home [music] to step through the gate. I believe at least for me I'll see [music] my mom [singing] and dad. Oh my brothers and my sisters everywhere [music] we look are friends. And the meetings [singing] will be precious. Those we've known [music] so dear. And no mortal ever likes of 20 [music] years. Welcome home. [music] I knew you'd come. Welcome [music] home. You're here for good. [music] Look around. Was it worth the wait? [music and singing] Welcome home. Step through [music] the gate. I know that when we get there, not supposed to cry. Oh, but I can't help but wonder. There'll be tears [music] in our eyes when we finally see our loved ones haven't seen [music] in years. And the Savior takes his nail [music] scarred hand, wipes away [singing] the tears, and says, "Welcome home. I knew you'd come. Welcome home. [singing] You're here for good. Look all around. Was it worth the wait? Welcome home. Step through the gate. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Welcome home. I knew you'd come. [singing] [music] Welcome home. You're here for good. [music] Look around. Was it worth [singing] the wait? [music] Welcome home. Step through the gate. Oh, look around. [music] What's worth the wait. Welcome home. [music] Step through the gate. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; It'll all be worth it then, won't it? &gt;&gt; They're having a little trouble out of this headset here, but that's all right. I tell you what, the devil just didn't want us to come. We had every kind of trouble you could think of. It seemed like I got a I was off today, but then I got a gas leak I had to go on. And then that kind of threw us a little bit late and then we hit traffic and we didn't know how late we were going to be. I told brother Matt, I said, "We'll get here sometime or another." And uh but we made it. I'm so glad. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now the headset's messed up, but I don't hardly ever use it anyway. Most time I use a pull pit mic, but we'll just try this handheld mic tonight. But it's good to be here. I see a lot of faces I know. A few of them I don't know, but God bless you. I'm Joe Howell. We uh pastor a church up in Byron, Georgia. And uh I've been pastoring there for about two years now. And used to be Jack Palmer's Assembly. And uh I see brother Brad back there. Are you motioning, Brother Brad? What are you motioning for? Oh, you just scratching your ear. &gt;&gt; Okay, I can do that. So, is it working now? &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. I don't have to hold this up. &gt;&gt; You got it now. All right. If you have your Bibles, why don't we stand and we'll read in the book of James. It's good you back there, brother. God bless you. Amen. Been a been a while since I've saw Brother Smith. Been a while since I've seen you, too, brother Tony, for that matter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good to see you. You know, he's one of God's ministers, too. &gt;&gt; Think we got another brother here, don't we, brother? Uh, who's the other brother that's a police officer? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. There you go. I was I see you back there now. Read. If you don't believe they're God's ministers, read Romans the 13th chapter. &gt;&gt; They are absolutely ministers of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, James the first chapter. We'll get straight to the word. Let's see. We got 10 minutes till 8. So, we don't want to hold you too long. I don't know about you, but that time change has just about put a whooping on me. It's feels like it's already close to nine. So, I know how you're feeling. So, all right. &gt;&gt; James chapter 1, we're going to start with verse 20. Verse 20. For the wrath of man workketh not the righteousness of God. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and supuruity. I don't I've never heard of that before except for the Bible. And I had to look it up. And it means overflowing. &gt;&gt; An overflowing of naughtiness. Boy, we could say we see that today, don't we? &gt;&gt; Supurity of naughtiness or overflowing. And receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we approach your word this evening, we just pray, Lord, that you would bless it, Lord. Just close my mouth, Lord, to any thought that I might have, dear Father, that's contrary to your word. And God, I pray that this precious word, Lord, would fall on the ears, oh God, tonight of your precious people, Lord, and they can receive it, Lord. It'd be a help to them. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You can be seated. So that was kind of a I was reading that the other night. Uh and I have read that scripture. Many of us read in James uh the first chapter how it says that uh you know if you sin and then uh when every man's tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and and enticed and then lust when conceived bringeth forth sin and then sin death. And then if you read on down, it's it's almost uh of course we know about the var God. There's no variableness in him or shadow of turning. &gt;&gt; I had one fell say that he was talking about God as being like a ying yang, a little bit of good, like black and white and there's a little bit of evil in God and a little bit of good in the devil. I said, "Buddy, you come too late to tell me that &gt;&gt; because the Bible tells me there is in him is no shadow at all." Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the father of light. So now I read that and it was uh it kind of struck me about that word called the engrafted word. I've never really thought about that, but it led me to turn to the book of Romans. If you would turn to the book of Romans, it's just back a couple books there just after the book of Acts. If you're not that familiar with it, find the book of Acts and you'll find the book of Romans just after that. Romans the 11th chapter. And then we'll read starting with the 13th verse. For I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them. Now some of you might say, "What is he saying there? He's saying that what he wants to do is is is cause the Jewish people &gt;&gt; to emulate. What emulate means? Means to act like, right? &gt;&gt; That I might provoke to emulation them which are my flesh. Who's he speaking of? The Jewish people. &gt;&gt; And save some of them. For if the casting, Listen to this now. If you're not taking notes, I encourage you to take notes. I know sometimes our minds drift. We're not going to be up here very long just for a few moments. But if you if you have a a notebook and a paper, write it down. Uh I found that that is a really good way to to listen to what the minister say. And it's something about when you hear it and you put it down on paper. If you could I've wrote notes in my Bible. Some say you write notes in your Bible. I sure do. I got them right here on the back part here if I don't have a piece of paper. But we all have cell phones. And don't tell me you don't. and we all have notes on there and you can take down and just write down notes. So, that's one time you you have permission to use your cell phones in church. Now, uh take notes and and listen to what uh write down the scriptures here and and it does help you. Uh I've learned that I talked to brother Jason and brother Jason tells me that he is an avid notekeeper. I he I believe he told me he's been taking notes ever since he was a teenage boy or maybe younger than that. And uh I can't I can't I don't have the same claim at all. But I have taken up that and it does really help you. Now for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be? But life from the dead. Isn't that wonderful? If them being cast away and cut off, amen, was the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be? Or when they are restored back into the fold. Amen. &gt;&gt; For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy. And if the root be holy, so are the branches. and have some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive speaking about us. He was talking to the Romans here. This is Paul a Jew speaking to these high-minded thought that they were better than the Jewish people Romans. &gt;&gt; And he said if if if some of the branches be broken off and thou you being a wild olive tree, &gt;&gt; that's the Gentile, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Were grafted in. Now that word is spelled a little bit different. G r a ff d. It's a little bit different from James. It said grafted, but it means exactly the same thing. It's past tense of being grafted in. If you were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree, boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou beest not the root, but the root thee. Now, I'm going to I'm going to break all this down in just a little bit. Thou wil say then the branches are broken off that I might be grafted in. Well, because now Paul stops there. He says, "Well," and you can see a pause. What that means is right. That's good. What you said is exactly right. They were broken off that we were grafted in. That's exactly right. Well, &gt;&gt; because of unbelief, they were broken off. And thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, &gt;&gt; but fear. So what he's telling them, don't beaughty. Don't think that you're something special, &gt;&gt; but fear &gt;&gt; because the same thing could happen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed, lest he also spare not thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when I was looking at this, I I was studying about grafting and and and and so we see what Paul is saying is and I got to look it up. Well, why did God graft in the gentile church? Yes, we were grafted in. Paul says here very plainly, we were grafted in. But when a farmer or a or a uh vine a vineyard keeper or if you have fruit trees especially this is this is when the grafting process takes place. Why were we grafted in? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the purpose of it? Well, now there's several reasons why grafting is is optimal. The first of which is if the branch becomes broken. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Diseased. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or just plain unfruitful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can be broken off in a storm. This was a wonderful tree. It was a good tree. I love this tree. It It's It's got a strong root system in it. And And a lot of farmers, they'll take a tree, say it's a it's a lemon tree. Let's just use a citrus. And And say it's a lemon tree, and it was a great tree, but it got a limb broken off. And it takes so long to plant another tree, for it to grow up and to come to fruition. But it's easier to take a branch and to attach it to an established root system already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for that to grow. Now, that's one purpose is to is to repair what was been broken off. Another thing is to accelerate fruit production. Sometimes they'll do that. They'll they'll graft in a branch to accelerate the production. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and so because it takes so long for a tree to grow up, they'll put it in there and and and that's what brings on the fruit. Now, um so what we see is what Paul is saying. Of course, this is the botany. This is a this is speaking of of the botney life and the farming and and and and so Israel being that original olive tree, &gt;&gt; that natural olive tree that was absolutely supernatural to start with. &gt;&gt; We all know that that God took Abraham &gt;&gt; and made a promise to him &gt;&gt; who his wife was barren. Abraham had no children AND HE MADE A PROMISE AND SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SON." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he didn't take any in consideration to the deadness of his own body. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Or the deadness of his wife's womb or the age or any of those things, but he believed God. Amen. He believed what God said. AND FROM THAT FAITH, &gt;&gt; God brought a supernatural man on the scene. Amen. Isaac was born. YOU SAY SUPERNATURAL. Absolutely supernatural. &gt;&gt; He was brought, it was a spoken word that was brought and placed into the womb of Sarah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It was spoken by Elohim himself. And it was BROUGHT TO PASS BY CHANGING ABRAHAM and Sarah back to a young man and a young woman. But not ONLY THAT, WHEN HE CHANGED HIM, he healed whatever was causing her to be barren to start with. So now she was changed from old to young and healed. What a supernatural man that was born. WHY? TO BRING ABOUT THE PURPOSE THAT GOD HAD SAID, ABRAHAM, your seed is going to be like the stars of heaven, like the sand of the sea. It was a spoken word coming to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Supernatural. And then from there came the lineage of of Jacob. Amen. And and and Israel and and and s of course and and and we see the prophets that came on the scene. We see the miracles that happened under Israel and that was that original that original tree. Amen. That original root system of the law and the prophets and and all that it was. But something happened. &gt;&gt; Something happened that when the Messiah came, &gt;&gt; they rejected the Messiah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but you know it wasn't all together for us. It was a wonderful thing &gt;&gt; that God blinded their eyes so that we Gentiles could be grafted in. &gt;&gt; Now what happens when you graft? So, you take a you take a branch and and you have to take a branch that is compatible with the tree. &gt;&gt; You can't take a pine branch and put on a peach tree. &gt;&gt; It's got to be of the same kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, you take this you take this branch and if it's cut off, then you you make it a little straighter and you and you cut it. And then you take the other branch and you put it together. Now, just putting it together, you can't just take a branch and just nail it to a tree and it's going to grow. &gt;&gt; It's got to be cut a certain way. &gt;&gt; And the and the what they call the cadmium. I had to study about this. I don't know about that. Some of you might know about horiculture and things like that, but the cadmium's the outside of the of the limb is where the bark is in the skin. So, that has to line up &gt;&gt; and and and you put it together. And there's a way that you cut it. There's different ways you can cut at an angle. You can cut it straight off, but an angle is a little bit better because when you cut at an angle, you have more surface. &gt;&gt; See, if you just cut it straight, you don't have as much surface. So, cut at an angle. Some even cut it in a V. They'll cut it and then they'll take the other one. They'll put them together like that. And then they bind it together and make sure that it's got a good connection. And and so when this happens, when this happens, it's not just nailing two pieces of wood together, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's literally the life that's in the branch that you have now attached &gt;&gt; is growing into the original tree &gt;&gt; at a molecular level, &gt;&gt; AT A CELLULAR LEVEL. THE VEINS in the water system IS GROWING TOGETHER. THE BARK IS NOW GROWING TOGETHER and it's now it is growing so that you cannot separate or distinguish between the branches. &gt;&gt; It's one is now the life of the original is now the life in THE NEW THAT'S PUT ON &gt;&gt; AND SO IS THAT ORIGINAL CHURCH. &gt;&gt; See when when Jesus died &gt;&gt; he redeemed he redeemed Israel. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; she was a his original wife? &gt;&gt; BUT BUT GOD DIVORCED ISRAEL BECAUSE of the pollution that she had, because of the corruption that she had, because of the WHORING THAT SHE DID time and time and time again. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when when God redeemed Israel, just as when Boaz redeemed Naomi, &gt;&gt; he got a gentile bride. &gt;&gt; You see, Ruth was never Ruth was never part of the redemption story, so to speak, as far as being PART OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; But but Boaz, when he redeemed Naomi, &gt;&gt; HE GOT A gentile bride, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when this little upstart group, &gt;&gt; started on the day of Pentecost, AMEN, &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST A FLEDGING, fledgling little group of people, &gt;&gt; THAT WAS BLOWING IN THE WIND OF THE HOLY GHOST MOVING. AMEN. COMING ALONG. JUST A LITTLE SEED that have been planted. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were planted on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; That seed. Hallelujah. that went into the ground. Amen. And was coming up that original seed, &gt;&gt; they were producing wonderful fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that original Jewish church had no longer was creating any fruit. No longer were they producing fruit. &gt;&gt; What they were producing was man's creeds, &gt;&gt; dogmas, ideas, traditions. They were producing everything except for that original word of God. Even though they were established into good soil, they were they were resistant to contamination. They were resistant to pesticides. They were resistant to all of these things, but they were not producing fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what happened? the husbandmen or Christ took it where they were cut off and he and he joined together that new little group of of believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; That new little church into that original that original tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now there's another thing that happens. There's another reason why people will graft on branches. you when you graft a branch on you share the traits of the original tree too. &gt;&gt; So it's not just all the new branch but it shares that original life. It shares the original traits of that tree &gt;&gt; and and the and how prolific it is of producing the fruit. It's got all that that limb can ever handle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got all that limb will ever need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so what is that? IT'S GOING BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL WORD. It's this little church that was grafted in Amen. &gt;&gt; of the of the New Testament church with the OLD TESTAMENT. BROTHER BANDHAM SAID THAT WAS LIKE A a eagle's wings. THE OLD AND NEW FLAPPING TOGETHER, TAKING THE LITTLE CHURCH ALL THE WAY TO GLORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Old and New Testament coming together. So now it's the traits of that original church coming and and the fruit being produced of the new church. Amen. Grafted in. &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe I'm boring. Some of you &gt;&gt; maybe some of you are I hope I'm not losing you. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to I'm trying to be as uh as thorough as I can &gt;&gt; with the grafting process. I'm just going to preach for just a few more minutes. Now when when the two are joined together it it the life starts growing in and that was where I I looked in James where it said that it was an engrafted word. &gt;&gt; Now you can graft with plants but there's also in the human body &gt;&gt; you can have a graft. You can have a skin graft if you get burned. If you They can take the skin from your leg and put it on your arm &gt;&gt; and it'll grow. Now, scientists don't know why. &gt;&gt; They can't understand life. All they know is if they put it there, it'll grow. It'll grow back and and it'll and when it starts growing, the blood vessels will go in there and the nerve endings will go in there and you can look at that and that is that is you. But now if you get your hip replaced, if you get implant, if you get a a dental implant or you get a a a new knee, &gt;&gt; yes, you've been implanted, &gt;&gt; but that's not part of you. &gt;&gt; It's metal or it's plastic or it's carbon or whatever it might be, but it's not you. That is not a graft. That's being implanted. &gt;&gt; But a graft is when it literally grows together and it becomes part of you &gt;&gt; and you become part of it. It's inseparable. And that is the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That once you once you believe this word &gt;&gt; and you take it into your heart, &gt;&gt; it's not just, well, I got it. I'm going to carry it. No, no, no, &gt;&gt; no, no. It's engrafted in you. &gt;&gt; IT'S GROWING INSIDE OF YOU. AMEN. YOU'RE PART OF IT. IT'S PART OF YOU. YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT. &gt;&gt; The engrafted word. Oh, I tell you, this word of God is so perfect. &gt;&gt; It's so perfect. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to tell you there's something about the English language that that I I study words sometimes and I get plum befuddled. &gt;&gt; I I don't understand how we come up with some of the words that we come up with and they don't even resemble the original meaning. Let let's just take the word commuter for just a second. Now, we all say that that means going to work, right? I'm a commuter. I I take the this is how this is my commute to work. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean go to work. &gt;&gt; If you look up the original word of commute, it means to lower or to reduce. &gt;&gt; You commute a sentence of a if a man had 10 years in prison, then the judge commutes his sentence to one year. So, the where the word commuter came from. I'm going to give you a little history lesson here. &gt;&gt; The word commuter was when they had the Long Island Railroad in New York and they wanted to bring people into the city to relieve congestion on the highways and the roads and the horse and buggies or whatever they had and all the manure. So in order to get the people to take the train, they uh they enticed them by commuting their fair. &gt;&gt; And so they became commuters &gt;&gt; because their fair was commuted. It was reduced from &gt;&gt; a penny to half a penny or whatever it was back then, &gt;&gt; I don't know, &gt;&gt; but it was it was commuted down. And so our vernacular now, our modern language, when we say commute, the first thing comes up, oh, travel to work. That's not what it means. &gt;&gt; But now we've made it mean that. &gt;&gt; So when I look in the Bible, just hold on to that thought for just a minute. When you look up the word cleave, now we know in the Bible it says that a man shall leave his father and his mother. I know we have some newlyweds here. Brother Gideon, I still call you a newlywed, brother Micah. Any more newlyweds here? Uh, two years or less. Anybody? Okay. Yeah, I forgot about y'all. All right. Oh, you back here. Okay. You got married. All right. Yeah, that's right. You supposed to be the devil in the play and you wasn't there. That's right. So, who who played the devil? Was that you? Good job. So now, so when you leave a father and mother and then you cleave unto your wife, that literally makes no sense. If you think about the word cleave. Now in the old English, they have taken that because of what the Bible says and they say, well, cleave means to join together and to separate. How in the world does that make any sense? &gt;&gt; It's a word they call it. I forget what it's called. You know how you have like different words, synonyms, homonyms. This is like the opposite M or whatever it is. It's words that it's a doesn't mean that it what that was was a a misunderstanding of what the word of God was saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what the word cleave means and we all know what's a meat cleaver. You cut meat. You separate it. The cleft of a rock is the root is a the root word is cleave. The cleft means it's separated. A hole in the rock, a a hiding place. Amen. A cloven hoof. That's also part of the word of cleave. It's a cloven hoof. It means a separated hoof. It's separated. Nowhere else in the English language does cleave mean to join together. &gt;&gt; There's nowhere except in that one scripture in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And here's the reason why. It is because before that you can be joined to your wife and you can be joined to your husband, there has to be a separating part. &gt;&gt; You have to leave your father and mother. You are cleaving from your family. You're cleaving from your good old buddies. You're cleaving from all of these things that held you a free man. Now you are now joining together. You are cleaving just like this. You She's cutting. You're cutting. You're joining together. And what happens? Are you two people? No. The Bible says you are one flesh now. Now you are one. You are joined together. Her life is your life. You live for her. She lives for you. &gt;&gt; AND YOU TAKE OUT OF THE EQUATION, brothers and sisters. We've got to close the back door. There's too many divorces even IN THIS MESSAGE. THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH, YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'll just go out the back door. You go find somebody else. I'll go find somebody else." It's too easy. &gt;&gt; BUT IT TAKES I call marriage a crucible. Marriage is a crucible to refine two people together. &gt;&gt; Because it it can be rough. &gt;&gt; There's hard times there. You are you are absolutely giving of yourself. &gt;&gt; When I got married, I put myself on the back burner. I had seven kids, so I wasn't even on the stove anymore after that. I was lucky to be on the grill out in the backyard. I was back burner nothing. I was way out no toaster maybe. But you have got to do that as a man. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what the number one cause of divorce is. Oh, some might say adultery. Well, yeah, that's a lot. That's right, brother. Who said selfishness? That's exactly right. It's selfishness because you when it comes right down to it, if you don't completely give of yourself &gt;&gt; and put the other person ahead of you, &gt;&gt; then you will put yourself first &gt;&gt; and that don't never come out good. &gt;&gt; Now, that's why you've got to cut you've got to cut off. Now, I'm not saying cut your family off. I'm not saying that. But don't sit there and criticize your wife's food and say it ain't nothing like mama makes. You're not gonna join together too good like that. Or if the husband uh don't do like the chores like her her wife thinks that he should. Well, daddy sure done everything for mama like that. You know what I'm saying? So, you've got to leave that and you have to cleave to each other. &gt;&gt; If you got buddies that trying to drag you out there, come on, man. Let's go do You can't do that anymore. you know, you can't do that anymore. And a lot of times you kind of find yourself, but that's the way God designed it. You've got to leave and you've got to cleave. &gt;&gt; You've got to cut off. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm getting ready to uh we're moving right on down here. And now, so, so cleave means to separate. We know that. But now, here's the thing about it, too. How do we join to this word of God? How do we join? THAT MEANS THAT SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE CUT IN US. &gt;&gt; If the word is grafted in, then there had to be a cut. There had to be an abrasion somewhere. You can't just take two sticks and put them together. It's got to be cut a certain way. It's got to be joined a certain way so that that life can flow in one to the other. &gt;&gt; That's good. And as long as you still love the things of the world, as long as you're still hanging on to those things of the world, and you don't cut those things off, you will never have the engrafted word living in you. &gt;&gt; It cannot grow. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a clean cut. It's got to be a clean cut from you. &gt;&gt; We already know that Christ was bruised. &gt;&gt; Christ was beaten. He was absolutely You couldn't even recognize him. He was beaten. So, he's already been cut, brother. He was the bleeding sacrifice. That's already happened. Now he's waiting on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you what does that. Ephesians 4 says that the word of God is sharp &gt;&gt; and it's quick. That means it's alive. &gt;&gt; It's a living word and it's powerful &gt;&gt; and it'll divide. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll cleave, won't it? &gt;&gt; The word of God will cut off of the things in your life that don't need to be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only now this ain't a one and done. This ain't a one and we don't come to church just one time and say, "Oh, bless God, I GOT IT." LET ME tell you something. Did you eat last week? &gt;&gt; Did it hold you to this week? &gt;&gt; You got to continually feed. And the word of God is the same way. And you have to continually feed. And every time you feed, guess what? That word is cutting. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's cutting something in you that ain't like God. It's cutting something. Because let me tell you something. If you're breathing, you got something in you that ain't like God. As long as we're in this flesh, as long as our heart's beating, you got something in you that ain't like God. And it's got to continually continually cut. The word of God is sharp, brothers and sisters. And it's a two-edge. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It'll cut right off. Now, I got to hurry up now. So this um this word that we believe, this message that we believe, &gt;&gt; we've heard all kinds of things lately. All kinds of folks that that just say we're a cult or say that we follow after a man. I've heard it all. I grew up having to defend it ever since I was a young boy. And it kind of sometimes you get a little weary of that. You know, &gt;&gt; people call you all kinds of things and they call you this that and the other and and but but there's one thing that I have learned that this message that we follow, this message that we believe was sent to us. Amen. By God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a message from God through his prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. If folks say, "Well, we can get it without a prophet." Good luck with that. Because Jesus never did one thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. except for going to the temple when he was 12 years old and talked to the rabbis. But there's not one account of anything that he ever did until he went to the prophet first. &gt;&gt; The word made flesh had to go to the prophet first. And that goes right back to Amos 3:7. God's word, it has to be the same. &gt;&gt; It doesn't change. Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but what he first shows it to his servants, the prophets." &gt;&gt; And so they say, "Well, uh, we don't why do we need a prophet?" Let me tell you what a prophet did is a prophet came and he had eagle eye vision &gt;&gt; and he and he when they were looking at two gods and three gods, he took that binocular and zeroed it right in and there's one God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and so this this word, this message is this right here. &gt;&gt; This is the message. You say, "Oh, it's a seven seal book. It's the church age book." That's right here. It's every this is the message &gt;&gt; that we believe is the word of God &gt;&gt; subtracting &gt;&gt; subtracting man's creeds &gt;&gt; dogmas &gt;&gt; that's good &gt;&gt; doctrines ideas and everything that doesn't look like that original &gt;&gt; anybody ever seen a movie after you read the book &gt;&gt; and you're like that's nothing like the book Why? BECAUSE THEY TOOK a artistic license. THEY TOOK THE BOOK AND the only thing that still resembled that book you read was the title of the movie. Everything else was like, "What in the where'd that come from?" &gt;&gt; Well, that's what they've done with the WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE TAKEN IT. JUST TAKE for instance, take this. I heard a man asking this question the other day on the radio. When Jesus told the disciples and he breathed on him and said, "Whosoever sins you remit, they're remitted. Whosoever sins you retain, they're retained." Well, that's where the Catholics get the priest's &gt;&gt; confessional from. &gt;&gt; On the surface, it looks like &gt;&gt; well, that's what he was saying that the church would have the power to forgive and the church would have this power and and that you could give it to Well, he was telling talking to Peter. He was the first pope. So, let let's just deduce it on down. The pope gives the the priest authority and the priest can go in there. But let me tell you where that garbage came from. came from Babylon when they would go in and they would confess and they would use it for extortion and they would use it for blackmail and it just all that Babylonian garbage came right on down and it's mixed in with the Christianity. See that's not the original. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HOW THAT WAS FULFILLED. Whosoever sins you remit, Jesus said in Luke 24 that the repentance and remission of sins MUST BE PREACHED FIRST IN Jerusalem in his name. &gt;&gt; AND PETER ON THE DAY OF Pentecost stood and they said, "What do we do?" &gt;&gt; You know how Peter remitted their sins? HE PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO THEM. HE PREACHED THE WORD TO THEM &gt;&gt; AND SAID TO REPENT, BE BAPTIZED, AND THEN YOUR SINS WILL BE REMITTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They've taken that completely out. So it looks nothing like that original word. IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE the original. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's man's ideas. It's man's creeds. It's just a surface. Not even scratching the surface hardly. &gt;&gt; And how does their sin retained? When they reject the word of God, &gt;&gt; when they reject the message &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; You don't believe. Therefore, your sin remains. Is that not what Jesus said? &gt;&gt; If you disbelieve, then your sin remains. And the only way to do it, I can't sit there and tell you your sins are forgiven you. I can by the word of God if you have met the requirements that the word of God has said &gt;&gt; and that's the only way &gt;&gt; now I've got to close. And now I know I done said it three times. Now I did want to leave you with this because it may be a little while before I get back here, but I wanted to say this that what is sin? It's unbelief. the but the root word of sin. How many's ever heard what the root word of sin is in the Greek in the Hebrew? Anybody ever heard that? Well, in the Greek, the word sin means hamarcia. That's a Greek word for it. You know what it means? It means to miss the mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It means you're off. &gt;&gt; In the Greek, the word is I mean in the Hebrew, it's shata. This means the same thing. &gt;&gt; It means to miss the mark. &gt;&gt; And and that makes so much sense. now is is more than that too. We all know that. But that's the word they used. It's missing the mark. It's missing and and and so who when everything was so out of kilter &gt;&gt; and every religion had their own brand and and everyone had it HAD TO BE SOMEBODY &gt;&gt; WHO COULD HIT THAT MARK EVERY single time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, I'm going to say this, and please, I'm going to I'm I'm going to preface it with saying that I don't mean this how it it may sound to you, but I don't know I don't know that brother Brandham knew that. I don't know if he knew that the root word of sin in the Greek was hamarcia. I never heard him say that. I don't know if he knew what the the root word of sin was in the Hebrew. I don't know if he knew that. Now, that's not I'm not putting anything I'm no in no way, shape, or form. not elevating myself. No, please don't misunderstand me. But I'm going to say that for this purpose and this purpose only. That even though he may not have known that that was the root word, his very life and his very nature bore out that he did not want to miss that mark. &gt;&gt; Everything that he did, every aspect of his ministry, he wanted to hit that mark every time. I'm going to read you a quote here that he said who said I love to shoot and the targets and here not long ago I was squirrel hunting down in Kentucky. There was I had a little model 75 rifle. It sounds I hope it don't sound sacrilegious to you to say this in the sermon but I will tell you I'm trying to make a point and this little rifle I trained it in and I've dealt and fooled with guns since I was a little kid. I love them. And I had this little model 75 till I could just every time hit a squirrel's eye at 50 yards with it. Now, I've heard brother Charlie Cox tell me testimony &gt;&gt; stood and told me that he never saw anybody shoot like brother Brandham. Now, he was raised in the eastern mountains of Kentucky and they that's how they lived. &gt;&gt; If you didn't shoot good, you didn't eat a lot of them. And you know, anybody that shoots, military men, Brother Charles, Brother Luther, and different ones, Brother Tony, and all and anybody shoots, you know that when you sight in a rifle, you're you're going to sit on on a sandbag, preferably. And preferably the wind ain't blowing and preferably it ain't raining and and preferably you're so all these things. And then you breathe, &gt;&gt; you wait for your breath. Sometimes you hold it, but you don't want to hold too long because your heart starts beating. So then you got to be real careful, especially them long shots. get way out there. So, they actually say the best shot in the world is a 15 year old girl. I've heard that because their hearts are smaller. They got good reflexes. &gt;&gt; But, but Brother Charlie said that brother Brandham could shoot standing offhanded. You know what offhand means? &gt;&gt; Standing up flatfooted, swaying, &gt;&gt; gun up and down, heartbeating, everything else, and nail thumbtacks at 50 yards every time. Amen. &gt;&gt; There ain't no way in the world I could do that. &gt;&gt; If I had an automatic 18 shot Marlin Model 60, I might hit that thumbtack once and that's after 18 shots and just like that right there. I may be able to do it, but brother Charlie Cox said he could do it every time. Now, he had this model this model 75. I believe it was a Remington or Winchester 75. He said, "I I had this model 75 to every time hit a squirrel's eye at 50 yards with it." I had a paper from the range down there signed up that driving nine bullets through the same hole &gt;&gt; at 50 yards on a rainy windy day. And I got it signed up and notorized. And that was the Lord helping me, of course, to do that. That's unusual. Yeah, I'd say nine shots through the same hole. And I started to shoot the squirrel. I find out I hit him somewhere else besides in the eye. I got nervous. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; His very nature of who he was. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to miss the mark. &gt;&gt; And you you say how oh that's got everything to do with it. &gt;&gt; That's who the man was. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to miss the mark. &gt;&gt; I tried again on paper and it wouldn't hit the target. It would hit within oh quarter of an inch. I'd call that good or half an inch something at 50 yards. But I know it would do better than that. That's the key. He knew. He had tasted and he had seen. He had already that that rifle had proved itself to him. He had been in the He had shot that gun and he knew what that gun could do. Amen. I'm gonna get to that. I done everything to the gun that I know how to do and nothing seemed to fix it up. Right. Now, it said here, he says, let's see. I might have just messed myself up. Hang on. We'll find it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go. Now, it says, "So, I wrapped it up in the box and sent it back to Winchester Company for examination &gt;&gt; for rebedding." That means take the barrel off, shave, if you need to shave down the stock and see what's going on with it, uh, and then put it back together. Rebetting. They wrote me a nice letter. I have it my file at home and it said Reverend Brandham said that rifle will group an inch at 25 yards. It's just a model 75. They didn't think there's much to it. &gt;&gt; They only said it'll do an inch. He had the paper notorized saying it would put a hole nine times through at 50 yards on a rainy windy day. That rifle will groove an inch at 25 yards. Said it's just a model 75. Said it's not a target gun. It's just a little plinker. and said, "You'll never get any better than that." Now, that was Winchester Company that made the gun and an inch at 25 yards and I drove nine straight holes at 50 yards. Now, here's my thought. My wife said, "Now look, Bill," she said, "if that company who made the rifle will just say that and it won't do no better than that, then who are you to say that?" I said, "Honey, here is here is what it is. I don't care what the company says. I've seen it do it &gt;&gt; and I know it'll do it. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And I sat down there when the other brethren were shooting at squirrels. Anywhere they wanted to hit them was all right. Midcenter back or anywhere. I sit under a tree and was crying. I said, "God, I'm so nervous. I can't hold myself together. Why did you make me a little nervous fellow like this?" And just I realized where I'm standing here. The Bible before me and a voice just as plain as you would hear mine said, "You were made thus &gt;&gt; for a purpose." &gt;&gt; Because until you know that rifle is going to zero once because if it zeroed once, it'll zero again. It's the same rifle. Therefore, I see it. If obeying this word, Amen. taking this rangefinder and bring it down to a place till I can see the same thing those apostles saw the same gospel they PREACHED IT'LL PRODUCE THE same results. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it did FOR THEM. IT'LL STRIKE THE TARGET every time. No matter what the church says and the people who claims to be I know it'll do it. Amen. Because there is what I want to look at that word to see that it's exactly in focus to see the same vision they saw and it'll do the same job that it did for them. IT'LL HEAL THE SICK. IT'LL RAISE THE DEAD. IT'LL CAST OUT DEVILS. IT'LL BRING FORTH the glorious church who is willing to seal their testimony with their own blood if it comes necessary to do that &gt;&gt; because it depends on what you're looking at. Now, if I had looked to what the Winchester company said, which is supposed to be the one that made the gun, then I'd have listened to them. But I know different. &gt;&gt; Now, if I looked to the church and they say, "Oh, them days IS GONE." AND THERE'S NO SUCH thing as that. See where you'd be? It'd be plum off of target. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if he is ever God, he is still God. He's always God. And he can't BE NOTHING ELSE BUT GOD. AND HE IS GOD ETERNAL. THEREFORE, WE WANT TO LOOK to that target. Not what target the church is shooting at, but what target that Christ is shooting at. Amen. And he did not miss the mark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, let me tell you something, brothers and sisters. He was wounded for my transgressions. He was bruised for my iniquity. Now, God, take my life, whatever it is in me that's not like you, God, and start cutting it out. Oh, I want to be JOINED TOGETHER WITH THAT WORD. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT LIFE CAN FLOW IN ME and through me. And I can produce the fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That has to be produced. &gt;&gt; This little bride will produce the fruit. &gt;&gt; She'll produce it. Amen. Grafted the engrafted word. Amen. Hit that target every time. &gt;&gt; Oh, it ain't just close enough. That's horseshoes and hang grenades. I want to hit that target every time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to God. Amen. [applause] Appreciate that. Amen. Did you appreciate that word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Joe. I know that's our certainly our desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to hit the mark. You know, I was hearing Brother Green tell a testimony, [clears throat] Brother Joe, was pretty powerful of uh being with Brother Brandham in a uh a tent while it was they were all snowed in. You just play something for me. um being in a tent. Uh they were all snowed in. Just an amazing personal story they told about just to show you what kind of man he was. And brother Green said that they had a dart board there. They were throwing darts. And he said that uh he'd watched Brother Brandham and he said, "Man, he would hit the bullseye every single time he threw that dart." &gt;&gt; And brother Green has it on his 8 millimeter camera. He took shot, took pictures of it. He said every time, he said, "Brother Brandon would would throw that dart." He said he'd hit the mark. [music] Hit the mark. Hit the mark. And he said after a while, he said every every, you know, now and then the the brothers would come inside and said, "Oh, let's play a game." And so, Brother Brandon would play the game with him. And he said, "But every time they played competitively, he'd miss every time." And he said [music] he wouldn't even be close to the target. And brother Green called on for a while and he said he was doing it on purpose by himself. He was hitting the he was just hitting the bullseye, but it was it was competitive. And so he asked him, he said, 'Brother Brandon, why are you doing that? He said, 'Brother Green, he said, 'If there's any joy in winning.' And [music] he says, 'Why don't I give you that kind, why don't I give you that joy? And it just spoke to brother Green so much about his character. [music] And he actually quoted um I think it's Galatians 5 and it talks about emulations and and brother Brandon takes that word and says it's overly competitiveness. And it was just showing you the character, you know, in [music] in a prophet that he just let them win. never told him that, but that was the kind of man he was. &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we give the Lord Jesus another hand? Give our brother Joe. Thank you, brother. Amen. [applause] Amen. Appreciated that so much. Why don't you gather? We [music] don't just have a It's only 8:35. And so we'll just make our way forward. Amen. And just take up these needs, different prayer [music] requests here. Be it unto [singing] me according to [music] thy word according to thy promises. Stand secure. Write upon [music and singing] my heart.

Brother Joe, I'll have you come and take these requests here. Brother Matthew Smith says, "Please pray for Katie tonight. Keep her in your prayer. She's [music] feeling poorly. We know that some uh sickness is still going around. So, we want to remember our sister Katie Smith. That's brother Matthew's wife. From brother Travis, my childhood friend named CB [music] Patterson is a few days or even hours away from passing away from cancer. He's 44 years old and has a family. Pray that the Lord will be merciful. Amen. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, just nausea, a severe headache, lightheaded. She like got a touch from the Lord. Amen. And also this need for brother Travis's childhood friend CB Patterson. My goodness. You know, Brother Brandham said, "You can't really pray for someone until you enter into their suffering." So, um I I could imagine, you know, what that family would be going through right now. So, we want to You believe that God is still a God of miracles? How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. We've watched God heal cancer before. Amen. God can do it. I want to uh bring also a need here tonight for a a work associate [music] of mine that I've worked with for years. Uh well, for about two years now and uh just uh see him just for an hour maybe every few days. Um conversation has always been very casual, just uh you know, never been able to have any time to speak to him. Um, but today we were just [music] talking and he started telling me about his situation he's in. He's 40. I want to say Jeremy's probably in his early 40s, about my age. And he um he uh had a heart transplant just &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh a few years ago. Very young to have that something in his family. Looks healthy. You never ever think that in a million years have you seen him. He he he works out every single day at four o'clock in the morning. found out [music] that was the main reason why uh he exercises and goes to the gym because they told him that would increase his odds of uh sustaining a heart transplant. It's one of the most dangerous surgeries you can have. Um not a even a great [music] survival rate from it. Uh well, I shouldn't say that, but a you know, one that you would think mortality rate is. It's a risky surgery. Um, [music] and so he told me that they they've told him that his his last doctor's visit doesn't look good and that in April they're going to give him his final followup and that if it continues to go the direction uh that he's going he will have to have another [music] heart transplant. And so he's real shook up over that. And he's also just uh his life is sort of uh you know uh already in a under a lot of pressure by different circumstances. So, I just told him, I said, "Jeremy," [music] I said, "I'm a Christian. I'm a believer." I said, "I might not have told you this, but I'm a minister." And I said, "And I believe in divine healing." And I testified to him about my hearing loss, the way the Lord supernaturally gave me back hearing, and also about um Marcus Humphrey who was healed of stage four cancer, Elena Butts, different ones that we know. and and you could just see the um the look in his face, you know, desperate times when someone's desperate like that, they grasp on to, you know, anything, any hope that [music] they can have it all. So, I just told him, I said, I just, you know, I want to tell you if if you'd be okay with it, I'd like to mention your name before our church tonight. It's funny, Brother Joe's preaching. He actually sort of knows he knows at least the [music] family, the dad there. And so, I I'll call his name, brother J. Uh his name is Jeremy Su. I think that's how you pronounce that last name, Su. Um, and so we want to remember him, Jeremy. Um, I told him, we'll pray. We'll believe that that in April when you go back for your followup, you'll have a [music] different report than what they're expecting. Amen. If anybody's here that would have an unspoken prayer request, something you didn't get [music] time to write down, why don't you just hold that up before the Lord, put your arm on your hand over on that person that's beside you. Let's not just let Brother Joe pray, but let's lift up our voices. The Lord wants to hear our voice, and prayer changes things. So, let's call on the Lord for these needs, right? We certainly believe the Lord is he's a healer. Amen. Let's just bow [music] our heads. Our kind, gracious heavenly father. Lord, as we come to you tonight at the close of this service, oh God, we've heard the word tonight. Lord, we've read the word. We've sung the songs. And Lord, we know dear Father, Lord, that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe this word, Father. We stand for it. Lord, we live for it. God, we know, Lord, that you are a healer. Lord, these needs that have come before us. Lord, the friend of brother Travis. [music] Oh God, &gt;&gt; Lord, we know that as far as physically and maybe the doctors have given him up, &gt;&gt; but God, we know, Lord, Father, that's when you come on the scene many times. And God, for your glory and for your honor, Lord, we just pray for this man, oh God, knowing, dear father, that nothing is too hard for you. God, may you move, dear father, is our prayer and heal the man for your glory. Lord, for sister Katie tonight. God, we pray for her. Lord, we just ask, oh God, that the sickness that she has, Lord, that your Holy Spirit, Lord, we just start at the top of her head, Lord, and burn out all the infection, all the sickness in her body, Lord, and may she be well for your glory. [music] And for this Mr. Su Lord, I just pray, Father, [music] as he was talking to brother Matt, Lord, and Brother Matt told him that we are believers. Lord, we know, dear Father, Lord Jesus, [music] that you are more than able, &gt;&gt; oh God, to heal this man, &gt;&gt; Lord, what a testimony it [music] would be, Lord, for for this little assembly, Lord. Lord, for this area, Lord, that he could proclaim, oh God, that this little church had prayer for him. The believers, the people that believe in Jesus Christ had prayer [music] for me. And now I'm a well man, oh God, for your glory, Lord. We pray that you would [music] touch him, Lord, and heal his body, dear father, is our prayer. And for the many hands that were lifted, Lord, you know, you know the need, Lord, behind each one, Lord. Lord, if it's financial, if it's sickness, Lord, if it's for a loved one, Lord, whoever it might be, dear Father, God, we just pray, Father, you would meet that need. And oh God, the many request at our little assembly also Lord. You know each one God. We just pray father tonight [music] Lord that L Lord we bring them before thee God. Lord not just uh not just wishful thinking Lord but a a absolute steadfast [music] assurance Lord that we believe oh Father that you will meet our every need. [music] And God we commit this to you in the name of Jesus Christ we [music] pray. Amen. Would there be a testimony, something someone wants to share? Amen. Before we go, Brother Luther, come home. Amen. God bless you all. Um, I have a screen porch in the back of my house and what I did, it's pretty simple testimony, but I had a a key up there so I could unlock my back door to get in the house. Well, [music] I don't know, three, four months ago, it disappeared. Then I looked, I thought maybe the rain or something washed it away. I had it hidden and I I couldn't find it. So last week I got locked out of my house because the back door what it does is the the dead bolts unlock but sometimes the knob will not unlock when you go out and I was dumping something out in the backyard. I come back in and I had to leave in like 15 minutes to go to work and u the front doors locked, the garage doors closed, my phone, everything is in the house and I'm like, "Oh my goodness, this is not good." So, I'm looking I I look on the ground out there. I'm like, and I did that before. I couldn't find it. And I So, then I started I tried to break into my house. It had some gardening tools in this green room. I can get [music] this bowl thing. I'm like, "No, that ain't working." So, I walk back out there and I'm looking on the ground. I'm going like, "Are you kidding me?" And it was the key. So, I get in the house. I was on work on time and everything. So, I was just very glad to get in the house. Amen. &gt;&gt; I do have a um Bruce Noak is a friend of mine. [music] He came to our wedding and stuff and um he's actually moving to Happy Valley. Not Happy Valley, but &gt;&gt; not the church, but what's &gt;&gt; Johnson City? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, um we're just he's starting a covert thing there with his daughter, and I send him devotions every single morning. We talk a little bit Sometimes you say, "Well, Brother Brandham seems a little hard here and there." He's a Lutheran, German Lutheran, as staunch as can be. &gt;&gt; You know, Johnson City, maybe he'll run across somebody that's just a little more staunch than he is. [laughter] God bless you all. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Anybody else have a testimony? Somebody, brother Enoch, go ahead. Pass that brother Enoch. &gt;&gt; Oh, sister also. Um, like one or two days ago, my dad wasn't feeling very well and he was not able to go to work and I was just real upset because my dad wasn't feeling very well. Dad doesn't get sick a lot. So, it just worries me. So, yeah. Um, so I had just been praying and praying and praying and just having faith. And the next day, Dad was fine like and He's right there. He's doing fine. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try and keep this one short even though it's been a long testimony. Um about 18 months ago, a little over 18 months ago. um well longer than that cuz [music] God moves in seasons and for a long season I had felt that I wanted to be home with my family and my children but the time wasn't right everything wasn't lining up but 18 months ago kind of tugged on my heart that it was time to get ready so of course you know being the great Christian I am I wanted to do it my way so that looked like well let me see if I can step down let me see if I can kind of figure out how I can do it whatever way. And um of course that all blew up in my face. So then I thought, okay, God's saying the opposite. I'm really thinking that I'm supposed to go, but I'm not supposed to go. So I'm just going to buckle down and do what I can do. That was probably about June. And God took my health and he said, "No, that's not the way I wanted to." And finally, I surrendered and he took care of it all. Um, so last Friday was my last day working at the government, which was, as anybody knew when I was talking to them, it was not a fun trial. It was like prison. Um, but God delivered me out of [music] that. And that's so wonderful. And I got two phone calls today. Well, one yesterday, one today. One of them was from one of my employees, and she said, [music] you know, you took you brought light in and you took it out when you left. And so she was which was great. That was such a testimony to me. And another one from a my first employer with the government, she called me out of the blue. I haven't talked to her in about 5 years. And she said the same thing. She said, "When you left, you took the light with you and it's never been the same." So I thank God for to be a living testimony that to people that would have never met him. And I thank [music] God that that season of my life is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Amen. [music] Anybody else? Nobody else. Sister Allison, give that back. Give that back to her. [snorts] So, on the first night of camp, um he said just say yes. And I felt something telling me [music] to pray for my friend beside me. And I kept pushing it off and pushing it off. And finally, I couldn't push it off anymore. So, I just said yes. And I started praying. And why I was praying, I was praying for her family and for whatever she was going through. And then the next day, she told me that she was struggling with her parents divorcing. &gt;&gt; She she wasn't um she was struggling with that and it really helped when I prayed for her and she said he gave her a touch from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Proves we always got to be sensitive. Amen. Sometimes it ain't us, it's the Holy Spirit tugging on our hearts. &gt;&gt; Um, one more. If there's one more. Hey, Sister Jen, go ahead. That's all right. I'll do one more. It's just fine. &gt;&gt; I always fight it when I fail to give a testimony. &gt;&gt; I'll get better. Um, since I've been since we've been here, [music] I've been battling something and I didn't understand what it was. And it just kept getting heavier and heavier and darker and darker and got to just a boiling point Sunday. And I was like, Lord, I'm I'm desperate here. I don't know what to do. And I didn't want to come back up again because I'd already come up. And brother Jason's like, "Doesn't matter how many times you you come again." And the Lord had laid on my heart the first Sunday when Sister Vicki was sitting over here [music] to pray for her. But I thought, I haven't seen her in almost seven years. We've both been through so much. I don't want to go over there and be dramatic because I know the second I hug her, I'm going to start crying. And uh so I I pushed it off that it got heavier or that's really when it started. And it got heavier after that. And then the next week she came back again and I had another opportunity and [music] it's you I'm just I I brushed it off and I what's it been four weeks and I came up and I honestly I wasn't coming to pray for her. I walked up here to get prayer for myself because I'm like man I'm in a dark place and I don't even know what to do anymore. I don't understand what I'm feeling, why I'm feeling this way. and came up here and I stood right here. And [music] anytime I go into prayer line, I just start praying for repentance and things like that. And [music] I found myself praying for her beside me. And I looked up and I realized I'd came up the wrong side and I didn't know if they would come over to me or if I needed to go over there. And [crying] in my heart I was just like, Lord, which way should I go? And I I felt him say, "Turn right." Vicki was beside me &gt;&gt; and I started praying for her and it's one of those times when you start praying and you hear yourself praying instead of you praying. And um everything I prayed for her, I had been battling. And by the time by the time I was done praying, I'd been delivered of everything that I needed. And I walked out just feeling like a different person. And [music] I mean there was even scriptures that I didn't even remember knowing that I needed for me that was coming through me and [music] it it wasn't me. We know that. But I just even the kids today um Adeline looked at me and she's like, "Mommy, you're different since Sunday." And I was like, "Oh yeah, how's that?" And then her and Titus both started telling me how different [laughter] I was. So maybe I need to repent to them, too. But just want to thank God for his mercy that even when we don't do the right thing the first time, he &gt;&gt; he still has. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Good testimonies tonight. Got some special friends, family here, brother James, Sister Faith. So good to have them. This is Anna's parents. So good to have them. And and we do this uh we've been doing this for ever. [music] testimonies on Wednesday nights uh just from a little bitty tiny church and I gave a everyone you know comes up like this and we've been doing it and I tell you what it's an encouragement to hear. You know I remember when Jason and Amy first moved here they thought do you all realize how profound some of these testimonies that are happening that God's doing. So you know the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. So you testify about what God does for [music] you. I believe the Lord that pleases him. Amen. Why don't you shake someone's hand before you go? Just greet them. We'll let you [music] go. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Make sure to make our visitors feel welcome.
